Abstract
Background: Single- and low- copy genes are less likely subject to concerted evolution, thus
making themselves ideal tools for studying the origin and evolution of polyploid taxa. Leymus is a
polyploid genus with a diverse array of morphology, ecology and distribution in Triticeae. The
genomic constitution of Leymus was assigned as NsXm, where Ns was presumed to be originated
from Psathyrostachys, while Xm represented a genome of unknown origin. In addition, little is
known about the evolutionary history of Leymus. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic
relationship, genome donor, and evolutionary history of Leymus based on a single-copy nuclear Acc1
gene.
Results: Two homoeologues of the Acc1 gene were isolated from nearly all the sampled Leymus
species using allele-specific primer and were analyzed with those from 35 diploid taxa representing
18 basic genomes in Triticeae. Sequence diversity patterns and genealogical analysis suggested that
(1) Leymus is closely related to Psathyrostachys, Agropyron, and Eremopyrum; (2) Psathyrostachys juncea
is an ancestral Ns-genome donor of Leymus species; (3) the Xm genome in Leymus may be
originated from an ancestral lineage of Agropyron and Eremopyrum triticeum; (4) the Acc1 sequences
of Leymus species from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are evolutionarily distinct; (5) North America
Leymus species might originate from colonization via the Bering land bridge; (6) Leymus originated
about 11-12MYA in Eurasia, and adaptive radiation might have occurred in Leymus during the period
of 3.7-4.3 MYA and 1.7-2.1 MYA.
Conclusion: Leymus species have allopolyploid origin. It is hypothesized that the adaptive radiation
of Leymus species might have been triggered by the recent upliftings of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau
and subsequent climatic oscillations. Adaptive radiation may have promoted the rapid speciation,
as well as the fixation of unique morphological characters in Leymus. Our results shed new light on
our understanding of the origin of Xm genome, the polyploidization events and evolutionary history
of Leymus that could account for the rich diversity and ecological adaptation of Leymus species.

Background
Leymus Hochst., a polyploid perennial genus in the wheat
tribe (Poaceae: Triticeae), includes about 30 species that
distribute in a wide range of ecological habitats over the
temperate and subtropical and tropic alpine regions [1-3].
The natural habitats of Leymus species range from coastal
to inland areas, including saline or alkaline lands, dry or
semi-dry areas, as well as shady and moist forests. Morphologically, Leymus species exhibit large variation with
absent (L. akmolinensis) to strong rhizomes (L. racemosus),
single (L. ambiguus) to multiple spikelets (L. cinereus) per
node, erectly involute (L. paboanus) to loosely flat (L. multicaulis) leaf, and subulate (L. innovatus) to lanceolate (L.
arenarius) to absent (L. duthiei) glumes [1,3-5].
The sectional delimitation of Leymus has been proposed
by different scholars (See Table S1, Additional File 1).
According to morphological characteristics, Tzvelev [4]
and Löve [1] divided Leymus into four sections: sect. Leymus, sect. Anisopyrum, sect. Aphanoneuron, and sect. Malacurus. Barkworth and Atkins [5] suggested that the North
American species of Leymus cannot be separated into sect.
Anisopyrum and sect. Aphanoneuron and recognized Leymus
as sect. Leymus and sect. Anisopyrum. Zhi and Teng [6]
divided Chinese Leymus into three sections: sect. Racemosus, sect. Leymus, and sect. Anisopyrum, and suggested that
central Asia might be the centre of diversity of the genus.
Based on ecological habitats, Yen and Yang [3] defined
three ecological sections of Leymus: sect. Arenarius, sect.
Pratensus, and sect. Silvicolus. While these studies add to
our understanding of subdivision of Leymus, phylogenetic
relationships among its species remain unclear. Moreover,
little is known about the evolutionary history of Leymus.
Cytologically, five ploidy levels were recognized in Leymus
species: tetraploid (2n = 4x = 28), hexaploid (2n = 6x =
42), octoploid (2n = 8x = 56), decaploid (2n = 10x = 70)
and dodecaploid (2n = 12x = 84) [1,5]. Leymus has its origin through a typical polyploidization process, which
might originate from allopolyploidy for ancestral entity
and then continuous autopolyploidy for higher polyploids [1,2]. All the Leymus species have two basic
genomes, Ns and Xm [7]. Previous studies based on morphology [1], cytogenetics [8], DNA hybridization patterns
[9], and DNA sequences (nrITS, trnL-F) [10,11] have
revealed that the Ns genome of Leymus was originated
from the genus Psathyrostachys. Despite decades of intensive efforts, there are still uncertainties regarding the origin of the Xm genome of Leymus. Based on morphological
characteristics, the Xm genome was presumed to be the St
genome of Pseudoroegneria [12] or the Eb genome of Thinopyrum bessarabicum [1]. Cytogenetic analysis suggested
that it was the Ee genome of Lophopyrum elongatum [13].
However, cytogenetic and DNA hybridization analysis
excluded the Eb and Ee genomes from the Leymus species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/247

[8,9,14]. Zhang and Dvorak [9] and Bödvarsdóttir and
Anamthawat-Jónsson [15] advocated that tetraploid Leymus species were segmental autotetraploids with the
genomes Ns1Ns1Ns2Ns2, derived from two distinct Psathyrostachys species. Wang et al. [7] designated the genomes
of Leymus species as NsXm until the source of Xm is identified.
Polyploidy, including autopolyploidy and allopolyploidy, is a simple speciation process. The success of polyploids is often attributed to their genomic changes
including genomic stability, chromosomal rearrangement, genome size and differential gene expression,
which allows polyploids to adapt to new ecological niches
or to be competitively superior to the parental diploids
[16]. A better understanding of the process of polyploidization and evolutionary history of polyploids is of widespread evolutionary interest [16]. Phylogenetic analyses
of chloroplast and nuclear DNA data have increased the
possibility to recognize polyploidy and hybridization in
plants [16-18]. However, the often relatively low variation
in chloroplast DNA at the intraspecific level have limited
the precision with which polyploidy can be identified
[17,19]. Single- and low- copy nuclear genes are less likely
subject to concerted evolution, thus making themselves
ideal tools for verifying the existence of suspected polyploids [20], identifying genome donors [18,21], demonstrating multiple polyploid origins [19], clarifying
hybridization events or introgression [18], and examining
gene evolution in polyploids [22]. Plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) catalyzes the first step in de novo fatty
acid biosynthesis. Southern hybridization and chromosome mapping indicate that a single copy of the Acc1 gene
is present in each of the group 2 homoeologous chromosomes in hexaploid wheat [23]. The Acc1 gene has been
successfully used to study the phylogenetic relationships
and evolutionary history of Triticum/Aegilops complex
[24], and the evolution of Panicum virgatum L. [25].
In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the single-copy
nuclear Acc1 gene for 29 Leymus polyploids and 35 diploid taxa representing 18 basic genomes in Triticeae. The
objectives were (1) to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of the Leymus species; (2) to demonstrate the evolution of Leymus; (3) to explore the origin of the unknown
Xm genome in Leymus; (4) to estimate the divergence
times for nodes within Leymus to document biogeographic diversification history of the genus.

Methods
Taxon sampling
Twenty-eight species and one variety of Leymus were
included in this study. They were analyzed together with
35 diploid taxa representing 18 basic genomes in the tribe
Triticeae. Sample information and GenBank accession

data were listed in Table S2 (See Additional file 2). The
seed materials of Leymus with PI and W6 numbers were
kindly provided by American National Plant Germplasm
System (Pullman, Washington, USA), and Leymus duthiei
var. longearistata was kindly provided by Dr. S. Sakamoto
(Kyoto University, Japan). The seed materials of Leymus
with ZY and Y numbers were collected from the field by
the authors of this paper. The plants and voucher specimens of the Leymus species are deposited at Herbarium of
Triticeae Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, China (SAUTI).
DNA Amplification, homoeologous sequence isolate, and
sequencing
DNA extraction followed a standard CTAB protocol [26].
The Acc1 gene was amplified with the Acc1-specific primers AccF1 (5'-CCCAATATTTATCATGAGACT TGCA-3')
and AccF2 (5'-CAACATTTGAATGAAThCTCCACG-3'),
and PCR was conducted under cycling conditions
reported previously [24]. To decrease the chance of PCR
drift and PCR selection, a 75 μl reaction mixture was separated into five reactions, and PCR products were pooled
together after amplification. The Acc1 sequence amplification was carried out in a 15 μl reaction mixture consisted
of 0.3 U of high-fidelity Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa
Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Dalian, China), 1× reaction
buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 μM of
each primer. PCR products were cloned into the pMD18T vector (TaKaRa) following the manufacture's instruction.

Cloning of PCR amplicons from single-copy nuclear genes
from allopolyploid species will isolate homoeologous
sequences from each nuclear genome [27]. Given that Leymus species contain the Ns and Xm genomes, PCR reactions will produce a heterogeneous mix of Acc1 sequences
from each Leymus polyploid. To separate the homoeologous sequence of Acc1 gene from each accession, we performed the following process. Firstly, approximately 20
positive clones from each accession were screened by
direct PCR using primer AccF1 coupled with M13R (on
the side of the cloning site in the plasmid). Secondly, an
Ns-type Acc1-specific primer, AccFn (5'-GAACCTGTGCTCATATGGTATATTA-3'), was designed and used together
with the reverse primer AccF2 to screen the Ns-type Acc1
sequences from above 20 positive clones with Acc1
inserts. Thirdly, the rest of positive clones including the
Xm-type Acc1 sequences were obtained. Finally, to determine whether the Xm-type of Acc1 sequences was the
result of a biologically relevant recombination, an Xmtype Acc1-specific primer, AccFx (5'-ACTGCAGGTATGTTCTTTT-3'), was designed and used together with the
primer AccF2 to amplify the Xm-type Acc1 sequences. The
cloned PCR products were sequenced in both directions
by TaKaRa Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Dalian, China). All

the sequences from Leymus species were determined at
least 5 independent Ns-type clones and 5 independent
Xm-type clones.
Alignments and test for substitution saturation
Multiple sequences were aligned using ClustalX [28], with
default options (gap opening/gap extension: 15/6.66),
and the alignments were refined manually in an effort to
maximize the positional homology. To reduce the size of
the matrixes and the possible impact of PCR artifacts,
unique substitutions in single clones were ignored and
several identical sequences were represented by a single
original sequence in alignments. In the initial phylogenetic analysis, the number of sequences used for alignment was reduced by keeping only one sequence if more
sequences of the same accession formed a monophyletic
group. Substitution saturation in the alignments was estimated by plotting pairwise rates of transitions and transversions against sequence divergence calculated under
TN93 model using the software DAMBE version 5.0.7
[29].
Nucleotide diversity estimate
To assess the divergence and genetic relationships
between polyploids and its diploid progenitor, nucleotide
diversity was estimated by Tajima's π [30], Watterson's θ
[31], the number of fixed differences (SF) and the numbers of shared polymorphisms (SS). Tajima's π quantifies
the mean percentage of nucleotide differences among all
pairwise comparisons for a set of sequences, while Watterson's θ is simply an index of the number of segregating
(polymorphic) sites. A fixed difference refers to the nucleotide site where all sampled sequences from one taxon are
different from all sequences from another taxon, whereas
a shared polymorphism occurs when two taxa have the
same two bases segregating at the same site [32]. Closely
related taxa are expected to harbor a relative higher level
of shared polymorphisms because the divergence event
has not lasted long enough to erase all ancestral polymorphisms. Tests of neutrality including Tajima's and Fu and
Li's D statistic were performed as described by Tajima
[30], and Fu and Li [33]. Significance of D-values was estimated with the simulated distribution of random samples
(1000 steps) using a coalescence algorithm assuming neutrality and population equilibrium [34]. These parameters
were calculated with DnaSP 4.10.9 [35] and ProSeq 2.0
[36].

We also examined demographic history in sampled Leymus lineages using mismatch distributions [37] and Fu's
Fs statistics [38] in the program DnaSP 4.10.9 [35]. Mismatch distributions are frequency distributions of
observed nucleotide pairwise differences, and allow to
infer whether lineages have undergone sudden or stepwise demographic expansion during historical periods

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:247

[37]. A unimodal mismatch distribution indicates a recent
expansion, a multimodal (including bimodal) mismatch
distribution indicates diminishing population sizes or
structured size. The Fu's Fs statistic is very sensitive to
demographic expansion [38]. Significance of Fs-values
was calculated with the simulated distribution of random
samples (1000 steps) [34].
Phylogenetic analysis
Three data matrixes, including exon + intron data, intron
data and exon data, were used separately to carry out phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted
using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference
(BI). ML analysis was performed using PAUP*4.0b10
(Swofford D L, Sinauer Associates, http://www.sin
auer.com). Bromus inermis Leyss. was used as the outgroup. The evolutionary model used for the three different
data matrixes was determined using ModelTest v3.0 with
Akaike information criterion (AIC) [39]. The optimal
models identified were GTR + G + I for the exon + intron
data, GTR + G for the intron data, and TIM + G + I for the
exon data. ML heuristic searches were performed with 100
random addition sequence replications and TBR branch
swapping algorithm. The robustness of the trees was estimated by bootstrap support (BS) [40]. ML bootstrapping
was performed with 250 replicates, each with three replicates of stepwise random taxon addition, using the same
model and parameters. BS-value less than 50% was not
included in figures.

Bayesian inference (BI) analysis was performed using
MrBayes v3.0 [41]. BI analyses of the exon + intron and
intron data matrixes were carried out under the same evolutionary model as ML analysis. For the exon data,
because the TIM + G + I model is not implemented in
MrBayes v3.0, we chose the closely related GTR + G + I
model instead. Four MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)
chains (one cold and three heated), applying MrBayes
default heating values (t = 0.2), were run for 3,800,000
generations for the exon + intron data, 2,000,000 generations for the intron data, and 9,000,000 generations for
the exon data, each sampling every 100 generations. The
first 9500, 4200, and 23000 trees were stationary discarded as "brun-in" for the exon + intron, intron, and
exon, respectively. The program Tracer v1.4 [42] was used
to examine the log likelihoods, ensuring that they were in
the stationary "fury caterpillar" phase. The remaining trees
were used to construct the 50%-majority rule consensus
trees. Two independent runs were performed to check
whether convergence on the same posterior distribution
was reached. The statistical confidence in nodes was evaluated by posterior probabilities (PP). PP-value less than
90% was not included in figures.

Network analysis
Taking the potential for reticulation in closely related lineages into consideration, phylogenetic network reconstruction method was used to study relationships between
ancestral and derived haplotypes. The median-joining
(MJ) network method was performed for this study
because of robustness compared to other network methods in simulation studies using known gene genealogies
[43]. MJ network has been successfully used to reveal specific progenitor-descendant relationships of polyploidy
Triticum within Triticeae [44].

MJ network analysis was generated by the Network 4.1.1.2
program (Fluxus Technology Ltd, Clare, Suffolk, UK). As
the program infers median-joining networks from nonrecombining DNA [45], the test of recombination was
performed using the GARD recombination-detection
method within the HyPhy package [46]. Building upon
this test, the exon data was used to generate MJ network
because of the absence of recombination signal in alignment (Log Likelihood = -1911.85; AIC = 4061.69), while
the exon + intron and intron data were not used to reconstructed MJ network due to potential recombination signal.
Divergence dating
The hypothesis of rate constancy was evaluated with a
likelihood ratio test comparing the likelihood scores from
the unconstrained and clock-constrained analyses. The
molecular clock was rejected because constrained and
unconstrained analyses differed significantly (χ2 = 205.94,
df = 88, P < 0.0001). Therefore, divergence times with
95% confidence intervals (C.I.) were estimated using
Bayesian relaxed molecular clock method, implemented
in BEAST v1.4.6 [47]. The lack of fossils for Triticeae precluded a direct calibration of tree topologies. Instead,
node dating of the intron data was estimated on the basis
of the intron region of the Acc1 gene clock of 0.0036 substitutions per site per MY (million year) [48]. Two relaxed
clock models, including uncorrelated lognormal and
exponential branch length distribution models, were used
to perform node dating. The final dating from the two
models was compared. MCMC searches were run for
10,000,000 generations under GTR + G model (with the
associated parameters specified by ModelTest as the priors), with the first 2,000,000 discarded as burn-in. The
searches achieved adequate mixing as assessed by the high
ESS values for all parameters, plateaus for divergence time
estimates over generations after burn-in. For all analyses
two independent runs were performed, the log files were
combined to check for convergence on the same distribution and to ensure adequate sample sizes, and viewed
using Tracer v.1.4 [42].

Results
Screening of homoeologous Acc1 sequences in Leymus
About 20 forward (5'-3' direction) clones were screened
from a plate of clones with putative Acc1 inserts by the
primer AccF1 and M13R. The Ns-type Acc1 sequences
were screened from above 20 forward clones by the
primer AccFn and AccF2, and the rest of clones were the
putative Xm-type Acc1 sequences. The primer AccFx and
AccF2 were further used to verify the presence of the Xmtype Acc1 sequences. Consequently, two distinct types of
Acc1 sequences (Ns- and Xm-type) were obtained from 24
Leymus species. Only one type of Acc1 sequence was
detected from Leymus multicaulis (Ns-type), L. coreanus
(Ns-type), L. ramosus (Xm-type), L. duthiei var.
longearistata (Xm-type) and L. akmolinensis (Xm-type). For
these five taxa, alternative genome type might be obtained
by more screens with extensive positive clones if they were
allopolyploidy origin. Another possibility is that one type
has been pseudogenized so that they are undetectable by
our primers. In addition, we also cannot rule out the possibility of autopolyploidy of all (or partial) five taxa with
only one type of Acc1 sequence.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/247

Acc1 sequence analyses
The DNA sequence of the Acc1 gene includes 8 exons and
7 introns, which was in agreement with previous studies
[24]. The sequence comparison from all the species studied here showed that the DNA sequence ranged in length
from 1391 bp to 1470 bp, and the DNA sequences in
most accessions were ~ 1440 bp in size. The aligned
sequence length of the exon + intron, exon and intron
data sets were 1549 bp, 696 bp and 857 bp, respectively.
The alignment of the exon sequence was unambiguous
without gaps. Many gaps, which resulted from indels
(insertion/deletion) within intron regions, were found in
the alignment of the exon + intron and intron data sets. In
particular, apart from the single nucleotide acid substitution and deletion, the Xm-type sequences of Leymus species and the sequences from Agropyron species and
Eremopyrum triticeum had a 4-bp TATA insertion at position 631-633 in the intron region compared to the
remaining sequences (See Figure 1 and Additional file 3).
A 33-bp insertion was detected for the Ns-type sequences
at position 1187-1219 in the intron region from 11 Leymus species (L. flexus, L. qinghaicus, L. leptostachys, L. pseudoracemosus, L. ovatus, L. pendulus, L. secalinus, L.

crassiusculus, L. duthiei, L. shanxiensis and L. yiwuensis) (See
Additional file 3).
Features of the exon + intron, exon and intron data
matrixes were listed in Table 1. As expected, due to strong
functional constraint, the levels of nucleotide variation in
exon region (150 variable characters, 9 transition mutations, and 3 transversion mutations) were lower than
those in intron region (407 variable characters, 25 transition mutations, and 19 transversion mutations). The ratio
of parsimony-informative characters and variable characters was 0.521 (intron), 0.496 (exon + intron), and 0.427
(exon), respectively. Plotting pairwise rates of transitions
and transversions against sequence divergence calculated
under TN93 model revealed a nearly linear regression,
indicating that the three sequence data sets showed no saturation effects.
Phylogenetic analyses
To reveal the putative genome donors of Leymus, the Acc1
gene sequences of all the polyploid species were included
in the phylogenetic analyses, together with 35 diploid taxa
representing 18 genomes in Triticeae (See Table S2, Additional file 2). At least 10 positive clones (including 5 Nstype and 5 Xm-type clones) were sequenced. In cases multiple identical sequences resulted from cloned PCR products of one accession, only one sequence was included in
the data set. Consequently, 89 unique sequences were
obtained and used for the phylogenetic and network analysis.

Three data sets (exon + intron, intron, and exon) were
used separately to perform phylogenetic analyses (ML and
BI). ML analysis of the exon + intron data yielded a single
phylogenetic tree (-Lnlikelihood = 8827.1373), with the
following estimated ML parameters: the assumed nucleotide frequencies A: 0.2432, C: 0.1830, G: 0.2152, T:
0.3586, the proportion of invariable sites = 0.1926,
gamma shape parameter = 0.8022. ML and Bayesian analyses of the exon + intron data recovered the same topology. The tree illustrated in Figure 2 was the ML tree of
posterior probabilities (PP) above and bootstrap support
(BS) below branches.
The phylogenetic tree showed that the Ns-type and Xmtype sequences from Leymus species were split into two
well supported clades, clade I and clade II (See Figure 2

and Additional file 4). The clade I included the Xm-type
sequences of Leymus and the sequences from Ag. cristatum,
Ag. mongolicum, and Er. triticeum. Three subclades (A, B,
and C subclade) with high statistical support were recognized in this clade. Subclade A included all the Leymus
species from North America and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, three Leymus species from other parts of central Asia
and one Leymus taxa from East Asia (100% PP and 73%
BS). Subclade B consisted of four Leymus species from
Xiangjiang of China and one Leymus species from Kazakhstan (100% PP and 75% BS). Subclade C contained
three Agropyron accessions and Er. triticeum (100% PP and
100% BS). Leymus komarovii was placed outside Subclade
A, B, and C. The clade II contained the Ns-type sequences
of Leymus and the sequences from Psathyrostachys. Two
subclades (D and E subclade) with high statistical support
were recognized within the clade II. Subclade D included
four Psathyrostachys species and all the Leymus species
except for those from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (100%
PP and 71% BS). Subclade E contained the Leymus species
from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (100% PP and 80%
BS). It was worth mentioning that the sequence in subclade E had a 33-bp insertion at position 1187-1219 (See
Additional file 4). Although subclade A, D and E were supported by high bootstrap values and posterior probabilities, the phylogenetic relationships among species within
these subclades were considered unresolved due to a high
number of zero-length branches.
ML analysis of the intron data yielded a single phylogenetic tree (-Lnlikelihood = 5903.3227), with the assumed
nucleotide frequencies A: 0.2250, C: 0.1823, G: 0.1755, T:
0.4172, gamma shape parameter = 0.9703. ML and Bayesian analyses of intron data generated the same topology.
The tree illustrated in Figure 3 was the BI tree of posterior
probabilities (PP) above and bootstrap support (BS)
below branches. This tree was highly congruent with the
tree inferred from the exon + intron data except for some
nodes presenting different statistical support (See Figure 3
and Additional file 5). Those polytomies observed in the
tree inferred from the exon + intron data (within subclade
A, D, and E) was not resolved with the use of intron data.
ML analysis of the exon data resulted in a single phylogenetic tree (-Lnlikelihood = 1877.7337), with the assumed
nucleotide frequencies A: 0.2630, C: 0.1880, G: 0.2688, T:
0.2802, the proportion of invariable sites = 0.4451,

gamma shape parameter = 0.9988. The ML trees showed
that the Ns-type and Xm-type sequences from Leymus species were split into two clades but with weak bootstrap
support (See Figure 4 and Additional file 6). BI and ML
analysis of the exon data recovered the similar topology.
Although basic topology based on the exon data was congruent with the tree inferred from the exon + intron and
intron data, many low resolution branches were showed.
Network analyses
To get better insights into the number of haplotypes of the
Acc1 sequence and their relatedness, the network reconstruction methods was employed. The exon data was used
to generate MJ network because no recombination signal
was detected in its alignment. Each circular network node
represents a single sequence haplotype, with node size
being proportional to number of isolates with that haplo-

type. Mv (median vectors representing missing intermediates) shows unsampled nodes inferred by MJ network
analysis, and the number along the branches shows the
position of mutations. Network loops represent either
true reticulation events or alternative genealogies in
closely related lineages.
Eighty-three haplotypes were derived from 89 sequences.
MJ network revealed higher levels of haplotype diversity
of exon region (See Figure 4 and Additional file 6). Two
distinct types of haplotypes (Ns- and Xm-type) of Leymus
species were recognized. The Ns haplotypes were four
mutational steps (at position 267, 268, 306, and 615)
away from the Xm haplotypes. In the Ns-type haplotype,
Psa. juncea and L. paboanus were placed at central branching points, while the haplotypes from the QinghaiTibetan Plateau formed one distinct group. In the Xm-

and L. ambiguus (LAMB2) were placed at central branching points. The Xm-type haplotype was closely related to
those from Ag. cristatum, Ag. mongolicum and Er. triticeum.
Nucleotide diversity between Leymus and its diploid
progenitor
The greatest pairwise distance among the Ns-type
sequences of Leymus ranged from 0.210 to 3.377%, while
the greatest pairwise distance among the Xm-type
sequences of Leymus ranged from 0.208 to 2.401%. The
levels of divergence between the Xm-type sequences of
Leymus and the sequences from Agropyron species and Eremopyrum triticeum was 4.477%. Sequence divergence
between the Ns-type sequences of Leymus and Ns
sequences of Psathyrostachys was 2.960%. The levels of

divergence between Ns-type and Xm-type sequences
within Leymus was 6.149%. These results indicated that
the Ns- and Xm-type sequences in Leymus species were

Estimates of nucleotide polymorphism, π and θ, were
shown separately for the Ns genome of Leymus and Psathyrostachys, and for Xm genome of Leymus (Table 2). The
number of polymorphic sites in the Ns genome of Leymus
was higher than that in the Ns genome of diploid Psathyrostachys. The estimates of Tajima's and Fu and Li's D statistic for Acc1 gene on the Ns genome of Leymus were 1.4676 (P < 0.05) and -2.5042 (P < 0.05), respectively,
while Tajima's D estimate on the Ns genome of diploid
species was 0.65817 (P > 0.10).
Thirteen shared polymorphisms and no fixed difference
were observed at Acc1 locus between the Ns-type sequence

of Leymus and that of Psathyrostachys, while equal numbers
of shared polymorphisms and fixed differences (Ss = 8, SF

Psathyrostachys than to Agropyron and Eremopyrum.

statistic of Acc1 sequences within subclade A, D, and E
were -12.3070 (P < 0.001), -7.0359 (P < 0.001), and 3.6640 (P < 0.001), respectively. These results indicate
that Leymus lineages species had undergone expansion
during its evolutionary history.
Node dating
Thirteen nodes were dated (nodes 1-13 in Figure 3 and
Additional file 5) using the intron region of the Acc1 gene
molecular clock of 0.0036 substitutions per site per MY.
Two age estimates with 95% confidence intervals based
on two different relaxed clock models were also presented
in Figure 3 (See also Additional file 5). Under a lognormal
relaxed clock, the coefficient of rate variation was estimated to be 0.752 (95% C.I., 0474-1.007), indicating that
the intron data was not strictly clock-like and relaxed
clock was appropriate. The age of divergence represent an
interval depending on the model of branch length distribution (each with 95% C. I.). Time calibration analysis
demonstrated that the age for the divergence of Leymus
was dated to 10.8-12.4 MYA (node 1 and 8). Two extensive radiations of Leymus were dated to 3.7-4.3 MYA (node
4 and 11) and 1.7-2.0 MYA (node 5 and 13), respectively.

Discussion
Phylogenetic relationships in Leymus species
Two types of Acc1 sequences, Ns- and Xm-type, were
obtained from nearly all the polyploidy Leymus species in
the present study. This allows phylogenetic relationships
among Leymus species to be elucidated on the basis of
orthologous comparison.

ITS data presented by Liu et al. [10] and Sha et al. [11]
showed that the Leymus species from North America were
grouped together with some Leymus species from central
Asia. By analyzing random amplified polymorphic DNA
polymorphism (RAPD), Yang et al. [49] suggested that the
Leymus species from North America were scattered in different subclades and grouped with those species from central Asia. The present Acc1 gene data showed that the
Leymus species from North America also did not group
together but placed scatteredly into one subclade (subclade A and D) including the Leymus species from central
Asia and East Asia. This indicates that the Leymus species
from North America is closely related to those from central Asia and East Asia.
Based on ITS sequence data, Sha et al. [11] reported that
L. racemosus, L. arenarius, L. ramosus and L. paboanus were
nested into one group, while L. angustus, L. tiancshanicus,
and L. karelinii were in another group. Anamthawat-Jónsson and Bödvarsdóttir [50] suggested that the northern
European L. arenarius was closely related to the central
Eurasian L. racemosus from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) evidence. In this study, the Acc1 gene data

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/247

revealed a close relationship of Xm genomes among L.
racemosus, L. arenarius, L. angustus, L. tiancshanicus, and L.
ramosus, which was partly congruent with previous study.
In the Acc1 gene tree, the Ns-type sequences of eleven Leymus species from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau were clustered distinctly in one clade, and the Xm-type sequences
of most Leymus species from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
were also grouped together. Exon analysis showed that the
Leymus species from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau were
radiated from a putative unsampled node. These results
suggest that the Ns-type sequences of Acc1 gene of Leymus
species from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and other parts
of central Asia, East Asia and North America were evolutionarily distinct.
L. komarovii was previously described as Hystrix komarovii
[3]. Ellneskog-Staam et al. [51] advocated that L. komarovii
most likely had one variation of StH genomes of Elymus.
Yen and Yang [3] regarded L. komarovii as section Silvicolus
of Leymus species (forest-dwelling) on the basis of ecological habitats. Morphylogically, L. komarovii is distinguished from other Leymus species by glume subulate,
often reduced at top, and awn equaling lemma boby.
Analysis of ITS sequences by Sha et al. [11] showed that L.
komarovii was placed at the base of the clade including all
sampled Leymus species. In this study, two distinct Acc1
sequences were obtained from L. komarovii. One sequence
was sister to the sequences of Psathyrostachys species and
the Ns genome sequence of Leymus species except for
those from the Qinghai-Tibetean Plateau, while the other
sequence was placed at the base of the clade I including all
the Xm genome sequence of Leymus and P/F genome
sequence. This result, in combination with morphological
and ITS sequence data, suggested that L. komarovii has the
NsXm genome of Leymus but with some variation.
Origin of Ns genome in Leymus
Meiotic pairing data from interspecific and intergeneric
hybrids [2,8] and molecular studies [5,11,52] had
revealed that the Ns genome of Leymus (NsXm) was originated from Psathyrostachys. Wakeley and Hey [53] pointed
out that closely related species are expected to harbor a relative higher level of shared polymorphisms than fixed differences. In this study, Leymus was grouped with
Psathyrostachys species, and shared polymorphisms and
fixed differences (Ss = 13, SF = 0) were observed. These
results indicate that Leymus is closely related to Psathyrostachys. Combined with previous cytological and molecular studies, it can be concluded that the Psathyrostachys
species served as the Ns genome donor during the polyploid speciation of the Leymus species.

The Ns genome is represented in all Leymus species. Psathyrostachys is the Ns haplome donor genus, which contains
approximately eight diploids (NsNs) or tetraploids (NsNPage 10 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:247

sNsNs) speices distributed in the Middle East, central Asia,
and northern China [3]. Based on DNA hybridization and
FISH analyses, Wang et al. [54] suggested that the Ns
genome of Leymus species may be originated from Psa.
juncea and Psa. lanuginosa, while Psa. fragilis and Psa.
huashanica were unlikely to be the donor species of the Ns
genome in Leymus species. The present MJ analysis
showed that all the exon haplotyes of Ns-type form a starlike radiation, and Psa. juncea was placed at central
branching points, indicating that Psa. juncea is likely
ancestral Ns-genome donor of Leymus species. The Acc1
gene genealogical structure may be related to the geographic ranges of Psathyrostachys species. Psa. juncea is
widely distributed in the former USSR, Mongolia, and
northwestern part of China, while Psa. fragilis, Psa.
huashanica and Psa. lanuginosa is restrictly distributed in
some regions of central Asia.
Polyploids often originate many times from independent
populations of their progenitor, especially when polyploids and their parental species coexist on a large geographic scale [55]. Wei et al. [56] reported that
considerable genetic heterogeneity was exhibited in accessions of Psa. juncea that have different geographical origins. On the basis of our Acc1 sequences, nucleotide
sequence diversity (π) of the Ns genome of Leymus was
higher than in the Ns genome of diploid Psathyrostachys,
indicating that the Acc1 sequence may evolve faster in the
polyploid species than in the diploids. Considering a
large-scale sympatric distribution between Leymus species
and Psa. juncea, another possible explanation for greater
diversity in the Ns genome of Leymus is that Leymus experienced recurrent hybridization with different populations of Psa. juncea. This possibility is further supported by
tests of selection history at Acc1 locus. Significantly negative values of Tajima's and Fu and Li's D statistic for the
Acc1 gene on Leymus Ns and Xm genome indicates that the
observed number of rare variations exceeds the expected
number in an equilibrium neutral model, which might
suffer from a genetic bottleneck created by polyploidization. Whereas Tajima's D estimate for the Acc1 gene on
diploid Ns genome was positive. These estimates are
indicative of an excess of rare variants in Leymus that could
be created by recurrent hybridization event or introgression of Ns-genome during polyploidization.
Possible Origin of the Xm Genome in Leymus
The genomic constitution of Leymus was assigned as
NsXm, where Xm represented a genome of unknown origin [7]. Three different genomes Ns [9,50], St [12] and
J(Eb) [1,2] have been suggested as Xm genome. Sun et al.
[13] suggested that Leymus secalinus might have 3-4 chromosomes from the Ee genome, and a very low homology
existed between the Ee and Ns genomes. Southern hybridization of genomic DNA and meiotic pairing in hybrids of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/247

Leymus species confirmed that Th. bessarabicum (Eb) or Lo.
elongatum (Ee) is not an ancestral genome of Leymus
[8,57].
In this study, the Xm-type Acc1 sequence, which is
homoeologous sequences of the Ns-type Acc1 sequences,
were obtained from nearly all the sampled Leymus species.
Genealogical analyses of the Acc1 gene indicated that the
obvious Xm genome specific clade (clade I) was distinct
from the Ns clade (clade II). The Xm-type sequence of Leymus was grouped with the sequences from Agropyron species and Eremopyrum triticeum. They had a 4-bp TATA
insertion, while this insertion was absent in the Ns-type
sequence of Leymus and other diploid species in Triticeae.
Recent genealogical analysis of chloroplast trnL-F
sequence in Leymus species suggested that five Leymus species from North America (L. ambiguus, L. cinereus, L. innovatus, L. salinus and L. trticoides) and two Leymus species
from East Asia (L. coreanus and L. komarovii) were clustered with Agropyron and Eremopyrum species (Sha et al.,
unpublished data). The close relationship between Agropyron and Eremopyrum species have been supported by
morphological analysis [58] and several molecular data
[21]. Previous studies based on cytogenetics [59] and
DNA sequence analyses [60] suggested the non-monophyletic origin of Eremopyrum. Our Acc1 sequence data
showed that Eremopyrum distans is differentiated from Er.
triticeum, and did not contradict the idea of paraphyly in
Eremopyrum. Despite the non-monophyly of Eremopyrum,
it is most likely that the Xm genome of Leymus species may
be closely related to the P genome from Agropyron and the
F genome of Eremopyrum. Equal numbers of fixed differences and shared polymorphisms (SF = 8, SS = 8) between
the Xm-type sequence of Leymus and the sequences from
Agropyron species and Er. triticeum were observed, which
could be the result of incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms after speciation events. Molecular
dating analyses suggested that the time to the most recent
common ancestor (tMRCA) of Leymus (excluded L. komarovii), Agropyron and Er. triticeum was dated to 7.7-8.9 MYA,
and the divergence of Agropyron and Er. triticeum was
dated to 4.3-4.6 MYA, implying that the divergence
between the Xm and P/F genomes might be prior to the
divergence between the P and F genomes. Given the
present data, it is hypothesized that the Xm genome of
Leymus species might have been originated from an ancestral progenitor which was closely related to Agropyron species and Er. triticeum.
Colonization of Leymus
The present results substantiate that the Ns genome of Leymus is originated from Psathyrostachys and suggest that the
Xm genome of Leymus is closely related to the P genome
of Agropyron and the F genome of Eremopyrum. In fact, Psathyrostachys, Agropyron and Eremopyrum are all distributed

in Eurasia (Most of species distributed in central Asia),
and most species of Leymus are distributed in central Asia.
Based on the morphological and geographic data, many
scholars suggested that the origin of the genus Leymus was
in central Asia [2-4,6].
However, several Leymus species are found mainly in the
mountains of North America [2,4,5]. Based on analysis of
chloroplast trnL-F sequences, Sha et al. [61] suggested that
the Xm genome lineages were suggested as the maternal
donor of four Leymus species from North America and two
Leymus species from East Asia. The present Acc1 gene data
also indicated that the Leymus species from North America
is closely related to those from central Asia and East Asia.
The occurrence of similar maternal donor and close phylogenetic relationship between North American and East
Asia Leymus species suggests a recent origin of North
American plants. Molecular dating based on the intron
data of the Acc1 gene suggested that the age of the most
recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Leymus was dated to
11-12 MYA, and divergence time among East Asia, central
Asia and North American species was dated to 6-8 MYA.
Of interest, our estimated divergence time of 3.7-4.3 MYA
(node 4 and 11) among most central Asia, East Asia and
North America species was prior to the initial breakup of
the Bering Land Bridge which was available for floristic
exchanges until about 3.5 MYA [62]. Therefore, it can be
suggested that North American Leymus species might originate from recent colonization via the Bering land bridge.
Adaptive radiation of Leymus
Polyploids usually have an advantage in colonizing new
habitats and ecological niches, a feature called adaptive
radiation [16,63]. Adaptive radiation are often characterized by short branch lengths, little sequence variation,
rapid speciation, and diverse morphology and ecological
habitats [63-67]. The present exon + intron and intron tree
showed several star-like topology (many short internal
branches connecting long external branches) within Leymus
species (subclade A, subclade D, and subclade E). The Acc1
gene sequence divergence was also generally relatively low,
ranging from 0.2% in many cases to 3.3% (subclade A,
0.3%-1.9%; subclade D, 0.2%-2.0%; subclade E, 0.3%1.3%), which resulted in low branching resolution in the
phylogenetic trees. The occurrence of a star-like radiation
was presented in the ML tree and MJ network of the exon
data. In addition, significantly negative values of Fs statistics and unimodal mismatch distributions within those
polytomies observed in phylogenetic tree suggest rapid lineage expansions. These results, in combination with the
fact that Leymus species exhibited large variation in morphological characteristics and habitats, indicate that adaptive radiation had occurred in Leymus.

Adaptive radiation might have been driven by specific
geographical events and climate oscillations [64]. Geolog-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/247

ical evidence indicates that extensive habitat changes
occurred in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and adjacent
areas due to the recent large-scale upliftings of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in Pliocene and climate oscillations in
the Quaternary within 5 MYA (The most notable
Pliocene/Pleistocene event is known as the Qingzang
Movement occurred 3.4 MYA, 2.5 MYA and 1.7 MYA,
respectively) [68]. The present molecular dating suggested
that Leymus have diverged in two extensive radiations during a period of 3.7-4.3 MYA and 1.7-2.1 MYA. Therefore,
it is suggested that the radiation of Leymus might have
been triggered by the recent uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan
Plateau and the Quaternary climate oscillations. This
hypothesis is further strengthened by the expansion of the
habitats of its current species. The habitats preferred by
most Eurasia Leymus species are cold and dry alpine
meadow, steppe desert and dry slopes. However, L. duthiei
grows in shady and moist forests in eastern part of the
Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Hengduan Mountainous
regions). Shi et al. [69] pointed out that both arid habitats
at higher latitudes and warm and moist climate conditions at lower latitudes might result from the uplifting of
the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. An et al. [70] suggested that
the drier climate as well as biological and ecological diversity in central Asia also resulted from the uplifting of the
Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Therefore, the rich geological
and ecological diversity of the plateau and adjacent areas
of central Asia, together with habitat isolation due to
changing climatic conditions during and after the uplifts
of the plateau, might well have promoted rapid speciation
and radiation of Leymus in small, isolated populations.
Wang et al. [66] considered that the rapid speciation and
radiation could have resulted in small numbers of
synapomorphic nucleotide substitutions and might promote the fixation of unique morphological characters in
some species. In this study, the Ns-type sequences of Leymus species from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau have evolutionarily distinguished from those from other parts of
central Asia, East Asia and North America. In particular,
the species from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau shared a 33bp insertion in the Ns-type sequences compared to Psathyrostachys species and other Leymus species. Morphologically, the Leymus species from the Qinghai-Tibetan
Plateau are distinguished from the other Leymus species by
leaf sheath glabrous, rachis and rachilla pubescent, and
glume shorter than spikelet, while L. duthiei differs from
the other species of subclade E by its highly reduced
glumes and loosely flat leaf.

Conclusion
In this study, two homoeologues of the single-copy
nuclear Acc1 gene were isolated from almost all the polyploid Leymus species and were analyzed with those of
nearly all the diploid taxa in Triticeae. Sequence diversity
patterns and genealogical analyses suggested that Leymus
is closely related to Psathyrostachys, Agropyron, and EremoPage 12 of 15

pyrum, which could shed new light on our understanding
of the origin of Xm genome, the polyploidization events
and evolutionary history of Leymus. Molecular dating, in
combination with geographic evidence and the distribution of diploid donor of Leymus, indicated that North
America Leymus species might originate from colonization
via the Bering land bridge. The Acc1 gene data analyses
also suggested that adaptive radiation might have
occurred in Leymus within a relatively short timeframe.
This might have promoted rapid sympatric or allopatric
speciation, and allowed the fixation of unique morphological characters in Leymus. Adaptive radiation might
have led to the rich diversity, the numbers of species and
widely ecological adaptation of Leymus species.
