Abstract
Background: Spermatogenesis is a late developmental process that involves a coordinated expression program in germ
cells and a permanent communication between the testicular somatic cells and the germ-line. Current knowledge
regarding molecular factors driving male germ cell proliferation and differentiation in vertebrates is still limited and mainly
based on existing data from rodents and human. Fish with a marked reproductive cycle and a germ cell development in
synchronous cysts have proven to be choice models to study precise stages of the spermatogenetic development and
the germ cell-somatic cell communication network. In this study we used 9K cDNA microarrays to investigate the
expression profiles underlying testis maturation during the male reproductive cycle of the trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss.
Results: Using total testis samples at various developmental stages and isolated spermatogonia, spermatocytes and
spermatids, 3379 differentially expressed trout cDNAs were identified and their gene activation or repression patterns
throughout the reproductive cycle were reported. We also performed a tissue-profiling analysis and highlighted many
genes for which expression signals were restricted to the testes or gonads from both sexes. The search for orthologous
genes in genome-sequenced fish species and the use of their mammalian orthologs allowed us to provide accurate
annotations for trout cDNAs. The analysis of the GeneOntology terms therefore validated and broadened our
interpretation of expression clusters by highlighting enriched functions that are consistent with known sequential events
during male gametogenesis. Furthermore, we compared expression profiles of trout and mouse orthologs and identified
a complement of genes for which expression during spermatogenesis was maintained throughout evolution.
Conclusion: A comprehensive study of gene expression and associated functions during testis maturation and germ cell
differentiation in the rainbow trout is presented. The study identifies new pathways involved during spermatogonia selfrenewal or rapid proliferation, meiosis and gamete differentiation, in fish and potentially in all vertebrates. It also provides
the necessary basis to further investigate the hormonal and molecular networks that trigger puberty and annual testicular
recrudescence in seasonally breeding species.

Background
The formation of male gametes, spermatozoa, occurs in
the testes by means of a highly coordinated differentiation
process called spermatogenesis that includes three phases.
Firstly, primary germ cells or spermatogonia actively
divide and after a fixed number of mitoses, differentiate to
become spermatocytes. During meiosis, spermatocytes
undergo DNA recombinations and then two successive
divisions to produce haploid spermatids. Finally, during
spermiogenesis, spermatids differentiate into mature,
motile spermatozoa. In addition to a complex germ cell
intrinsic genetic program, the entire spermatogenetic
process also strongly relies on numerous endocrine and
paracrine signalling pathways from testicular somatic cells
[1-5]. In mammals, this cellular communication network
that triggers efficient spermatogenesis notably involves
the production of androgens by Leydig cells in response to
the luteinizing hormone (LH) and the sustain of germ cell
survival and differentiation by the so-called "nurse" Sertoli cells, which are themselves responsive to both androgens and the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
Whereas these overall features of spermatogenesis appear
to have been conserved in vertebrates, a number of reproductive strategies have emerged throughout evolution,
leading to marked differences in terms of structural organisation of the testes or regarding the frequency, timing and
rate of spermatogenesis [6]. These spatio-temporal differences in the development of the germinal compartment
are believed to involve original regulatory events.
In seasonally breeding rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus
mykiss, spermatogenesis occurs during a marked annual
reproductive cycle during which the testis undergoes a
dramatic increase in size (from 0.05% up to 8% of the
body weight), while germ cells develop partially synchronously, to finally allow the massive production of sperm
within a short period of time once a year [7,8]. Many
efforts have been made in commercial fish farms to control reproductive cycles in order to obtain all-year-round
spawning fish or to prevent the slowing of growth linked
to sexual maturation. Successful results have been
obtained to some extent through manipulating the photoperiod or the hormonal status of fish. However, the
mechanisms underlying such effects are still poorly understood and these applications in broodstock management
remain limited to a few situations [9,10]. Further research
efforts concerning the cellular pathways involved during
spermatogenesis recrudescence are thus necessary if we are
to understand and control testis maturation in teleost fish
species. Moreover, the seasonally-driven testis development in trout provides a new model for deciphering the
hormonal and paracrine regulatory processes that govern
early germ cell proliferation and differentiation until spermatozoa secretion.

A microarray experiment investigating testicular gene
expression during the reproductive cycle in trout is
reported here. The use of entire gonad samples at various
stages together with isolated germ cells allowed us to follow expression patterns during testis development and
more importantly, to predict cellular origins of differentially-expressed genes. We also carried out a cross-species
comparison and identified a complement of evolutionary
conserved genes displaying very similar expression during
spermatogenesis in trout and mice. Finally, by using nontesticular trout tissue expression data we found potential
testis-specific genes that may have unique functions during spermatogenesis. Together with the confident annotations we provide for the genes represented on the trout
microarray, this dataset thus constitutes a necessary and
solid basis to further investigate the control of spermatogenesis in fish.

Results
Experimental design and overall microarray results
Trout spermatogenesis occurs seasonally in such a way
that all morphological and cellular events tend to be synchronized [11,12]. We thus used gonads at key stages in
the male reproductive cycle (Figure 1A-E) to study the
changes in gene expression underlying testis development. These included gonads at early stages containing
slowly-dividing type A spermatogonia (Stage I, Figure 1A)
or both type A and actively-dividing type B spermatogonia
(Stages IIa and IIb, Figure 1B), maturing testes containing
meiotic spermatocytes (Stage IIIb, Figure 1C) and postmeiotic spermatids (Stage V, Figure 1D) in addition to
growing numbers of spermatogonia and, finally, gonads
at a later stage, i.e. spawning testes, containing essentially
fully developed spermatozoa (stage VIII, Figure 1E). Additionally, fractions of isolated germ cells enriched in spermatogonia (Figure 1F), spermatocytes (Figure 1G) or
spermatids (Figure 1H) were used to identify the cellular
origins of measured expression signals.

Unsupervised hierarchical classification of the samples
(Figure 1I) clearly distinguished immature (Stages I, IIa
and IIb) and spawning (Stages VIII) gonads from isolated
germ cell fractions and maturing gonads undergoing meiosis and spermiogenesis (Stages IIIb and V, respectively).
The correlation observed between isolated germ cell samples and total testes harbouring active spermatogenesis is
not surprising given the large number of differentiating
germ cells that accumulate during testis maturation.
Inversely, the correlation observed between the early
stages and stage VIII is more intriguing: Gonads in the
early stages contain mainly spermatogonia under various
proliferation states together with somatic cells (i.e. Leydig,
Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells), whereas stage VIII
gonads are predominantly composed of mature spermatozoa and somatic cells (Figure 1H). Since spermatozoa

only contain very small amounts of RNA [13], expression
signals from stage VIII gonads are actually likely to represent the somatic complement of spawning testes. The
overall expression profiles from entire gonads thus
appeared consistent with the cellular events taking place
throughout the male trout reproductive cycle.

Annotation of the trout cDNA microarray
Genes/transcripts corresponding to the EST sequences
available for the 9024 clones spotted on the microarray
were annotated by searching for potential orthologous
genes in the genome of model fish species - for instance
Gasterosteus aculeatus, Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes and
Takifugu rubripes. Among the 8665 clones mapped on at

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:546

least one of these fish genomes (BLAT algorithm), 8647
were associated with Ensembl gene IDs. Overall, 8197
trout clones were thus confidently linked to a model fish
gene - i.e. with at least 2 EST hits across all 4 genomes
leading to the same Ensembl gene or to similar genes
encoding proteins belonging to the same family - and corresponded to 6661 non redundant (NR) genes. We next
used information from the Ensembl database to associate
clones with GeneOntology (GO) terms [14]. To increase
the somehow weak annotation of fish genes, GO terms
associated with corresponding mammalian genes were
also used. This inference was possible for 7065 clones for
which associated fish genes also had rat, mouse and/or
human orthologous genes, as predicted by the Ensembl
database (Compara, version 52). This strategy enabled us
to annotate 88% of the spotted clones in terms of "biological process", "molecular function" or "cellular component" annotations.
Identification of differentially-expressed genes during
trout testis spermatogenesis
A statistical analysis, based on the comparison of 38 samples hybridized onto 38 microarrays, was performed to
identify genes exhibiting significant changes in expression
during trout spermatogenesis. Among 7821 well-measured clones, 3379 were thus found to be differentiallyexpressed and corresponded to 2771 NR genes (Additional file 1). Their classification in 9 expression clusters
then allowed the identification of sequential events of
gene activation or repression during testis development
and/or germ cell differentiation. To further distinguish
somatic cell from germ cell transcripts we focused on
1694 highly differentially-expressed clones (1441 NR
genes; labelled "High differential" in additional file 1) for
which cellular origins can be more confidently inferred
(Figures 2 and 3). Note that the color-code used for heatmap representations reflects the signal intensity, i.e. the
expression level, of a given gene, ranging from not
detected (dark blue) to highly expressed (red). It therefore
allows not only to represent changes in expression for a
given gene, but also to compare expression levels between
genes.

At least 3 clusters corresponding to genes preferentiallyexpressed in somatic cells, as evidenced by their low or
null expression in isolated germ cell samples, could thus
be distinguished. Genes in cluster A (334 clones/284 NR
genes) are expressed in early developmental stages, then
decrease by a dilution-effect as germ cells accumulate
within the gonads (from stage IIb onwards) and finally
increase in stage VIII testes when very few germ cells, apart
from spermatozoa, are found within the testis (Figure 2).
In contrast to this archetypical somatic expression pattern,
genes in clusters B (160/133) and C (170/141) are
expressed at lower and higher levels in stage VIII gonads,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/546

respectively (Figure 2). These genes are therefore likely to
be subjected to differential expression regulations during
the reproductive cycle in comparison with cluster A.
Genes in cluster D (95/79) exhibit a somatic developmental expression pattern that is somehow similar to cluster A
but are, moreover, highly expressed in isolated spermatogonia (Figure 2).
Clusters E and F contain genes that are most highly
expressed in isolated spermatogonia but that could be distinguished on the basis of their developmental expression
pattern (Figure 3). Genes in cluster E (111/94) exhibit a
progressive decrease in expression as spermatogenesis
proceeds (from stage IIIb onwards) and might correspond
to weakly differentiated spermatogonia. In contrast, genes
in cluster F (202/154) transiently increase from stages IIb
to V and could correspond to more differentiated,
actively-dividing spermatogonia and early spermatocytes
that accumulate during the course of the reproductive
cycle (Figures 3).
Clusters G, H and I were found to contain genes expressed
within the germline or with expression peaking in meiotic
and post-meiotic germ cells. Cluster G (129/108) indeed
contains genes highly expressed in all germ cell types that
are also highly expressed in stage IIIb and V gonads (Figure 3). Cluster H (365/302) corresponds to genes more
specifically expressed in both spermatocytes and spermatids. Again, these transcripts are highly accumulating in
stage IIIb and V gonads (Figure 3). Finally, genes belonging to cluster I (128/116) are highly expressed within the
germline, especially in both spermatocytes and spermatids, but differ from clusters G and H as they do not show
a clear differential expression pattern during testis maturation (Figure 3).
Normalized expression data, expression cluster information and corresponding annotations are available for all
differentially-expressed trout clones in a searchable excel
spreadsheet provided in additional file 1. Note that the
expression profiles for 5 somatic genes (Amh, Dmrt1,
Slc26a4, Sox9a and Tbx1) were verified and confirmed by
qPCR experiments (Additional file 2). The comparison of
the 2 methods revealed that microarrays data tend to minimize the differences between experimental groups of
samples.
Functional mining of expression clusters highlights relevant
functions in trout testis development
We performed a GeneOntology term analysis to investigate the biological significance of the 9 expression clusters
described above. We found enriched functions in each
cluster that are consistent with known events occurring at
different stages of spermatogenesis and in specific cellular

mone or retinol metabolic processes (Akr1d1, Cyp17a1,
Cyp11a1, Dhrs3 and Dhrs9, Ece1, Hsd11b2). Additionally, a number of genes involved in the regulation of muscle contraction (Anxa6, Atp1a1, Gucy1a3, Myl9, Tpm1
and Tpm3) were found in this cluster and are possibly
expressed by contractile peritubular myoid cells. Cluster
B, which might correspond to somatic genes undergoing
down regulation as the testis matures, was found to con-

§

The somatic expression cluster A was thus found to be significantly enriched in genes coding for proteins involved
in hormone biosynthetic or catabolic processes, which
may originate from steroidogenic Leydig cells, including
some genes more specifically involved in C21-steroid horcompartments of the testis ("biological process" terms,
Figure 4).

tain many genes involved in various developmental processes. It included genes encoding extracellular matrix
constituents or organizers (Itga6, Col1a1 and Col1a2),
but also transcription factors (Bapx1, Pcgf2, Sox10 and
Tbx1) involved in skin and skeletal system morphogenesis or ondontogenesis. Genes in cluster C are highly
expressed in stage VIII testes and were notably found to be
involved in water transport and homeostasis, cAMP metabolic processes (Aqp4, Itnp, Timp2 and Vsnp), lactation
and secretion (Ank1, Agpat9, Canx, Cav2, Dgat1, Gars,
Glrx5 and Slc39a1). These biological processes appear to
be highly relevant functions for semen fluid constitution
and sperm hydration during spawning. Cluster D, which
corresponds to genes that might be expressed in both
somatic cells and spermatogonia, contains genes involved
in glycolysis (Aldoa, Eno1p, Eno3, Gapdh, Pgk1 and
Tpi1a), antigen processing and presentation (Cd74, B2m,
Mhc1uca and Mica) and the aldehyde metabolic process
(Tpia1, Aldh7a1 and Aldh9a1). Type A spermatogonia
cluster E was found to be enriched in genes involved in the
response to bacterium and ionizing radiation or terpenoid
metabolic process (Adh5, C10orf33, Dhrs4, Gpx3,
Hadha, Hamp1 and Tf). More interestingly, these genes
involved in double strand break repair (Xrcc4 and Xrcc6
and Msh2) may participate in specific checkpoints in
these cells to ensure the integrity of the transmitted
genome. Additionally, numerous genes were involved in
ribosome biogenesis (Aatf, Exosc5, Mina, Nmd3, Rplp0,
Rpsa and Wdr3), a function that was also found to be
enriched in cluster F. Cluster F is likely to correspond to
more differentiated spermatogonia and was found to contain genes involved in RNA metabolism, including mRNA
splicing, via spliceosome, RNA transport (Ckap5, Ddx39,
Dye, Nup43, Thoc4 and Xpo1), rRNA processing (Ddx56,
Dkc1, Eif4a3, Exocs7, Exocs8, Fbl, Nol5 and Utp14c) or
mRNA polyadenylation (Cpsf1, Cstf2 and Pabpn1),
which could be important for fine-tuning gene expression
in these cells. In agreement with the high proliferative
activity of these cells, a number of genes were also
involved in DNA metabolic processes, notably in the initiation of DNA replication (Mcm2-7, Orcl1 and Rpa4)
and nucleotide-excision repair, DNA gap filling or base
excision repair (Msh6, Pcna, Pold1, Rfc3, Rfc4, Ung and
Rpa4). Cluster G corresponds to genes widely expressed
within the germline that are involved in DNA replication
along with cell division, mitosis or mitotic cell cycle
checkpoint (Cdc2, Mad2l1, Ttk and Zw10). Furthermore,
genes involved in meiosis were found in cluster F (Fancd2,
Kif2c, Msh6, Psmd13, Spin1, and Utp14c), cluster G
(Psmc3ip, Rad50, Sycp3l, Ttk and Zw10) and cluster H as
well (Ccna1, Ccnb3, Cdc25c, Dmc1, Kif2c, Meig1, Nek2,
Topbp1 and Tsga2). Finally, whereas the meiotic/postmeiotic cluster H shared common biological functions
with cluster G (Cell division, mitosis and microtubulebased movement), it was also consistently and specifically

enriched in genes involved in microtubule cytoskeleton
organization, ciliary or flagellar mobility (Cetn3,
C14orf143, Dnah1, Dnah7, Dnah8, Dnah12, Fam179b,
Gabarap, Kif2c, LOC795513, Ndel1, Tekt3, Tekt4, Tubb1
and Ube2c) and spermatogenesis (Ccna1, Dmc1, Dnah9,
Dnajb13, Ggnbp2, Hist1h1d, Klhl10, Nme5, Ropn1l,
Sapg6, Spata4, Tegt, Tle3 and Txndc6). Only cluster I did
not show any specifically enriched biological processes
and its biological significance still remains unclear.
Taken together, the statistical enrichments obtained in
this GO term analysis validate our gene expression analysis and the annotation of trout genes. It can be noted that
concordant results were obtained at molecular function or
cellular component levels (Additional files 3 and 4) as
well as for conserved genes correlated with mice and for
testis-specific genes (see below and additional files 5 and
6).
Correlating gene expression during spermatogenesis in fish
and mammals
We next conducted a cross-species comparison to identify
evolutionary-conserved genes that would also exhibit
conserved expression during trout and mouse testis development. We used expression data corresponding to postnatal testis development in the mouse (GEO repository:
GSE12769), as the first wave of spermatogenesis occurs,
and compared the expression of 1105 differentiallyexpressed NR trout genes with their mouse orthologs.
Firstly, we selected mouse genes with significant expression (≥ overall median value) in at least one developmental stage and identified 1044 genes that were
differentially-expressed in trout and also consistently
detected in mouse testes, suggesting roles during testis
development or spermatogenesis for these genes in both
species. In addition, we performed a correlation test to
compare expression profiles in trout developmental stages
(I, IIb, IIIb and V) and mouse post-partum ontogeny (0,
8, 18 and 30 dpp). This enabled us to select 442 clones
(403 NR genes) that exhibit very similar developmental
expression patterns and covered most of the expression
clusters (Figure 5). Indeed, only genes in cluster C, whose
expression profiles depend mainly on stage VIII gonads (a
stage specific to highly cyclic fish species with no equivalent in mice), and in cluster I, which do not show important changes in expression during testis development,
were found to exhibit low correlated expression with their
mouse orthologs. Importantly, the genes selected by this
filtration on the basis of developmental expression profiles also exhibited a clear-cut expression pattern in testicular cells isolated from mice. These genes might therefore
be expressed in the same cell types in both species where
they are likely to exert similar functions. Furthermore, the
GO term analysis performed on 3 broad expression clusters (i.e. somatic, spermatogonia and meiotic/post-mei-

Figure 5
Correlated expression of conserved genes during spermatogenesis in trout and mouse
Correlated expression of conserved genes during spermatogenesis in trout and mouse. Expression profiles during
spermatogenesis in trout and mouse (datasets GSE12769 and E-TABM-130) were compared. Mouse orthologs of differentially
expressed trout genes were first identified using the Ensembl database and filtered to select only those genes with significant
expression in at least one mouse developmental stage (Signal intensity ≥ median value). A correlation test was then performed
to select genes with similar expression profiles (correlation ≥0.8) in trout and mouse developmental stages. Each line represents the expression signal of a trout clone and a corresponding mouse probeset. Gene expression in trout developmental
stages, trout isolated germ cells, mouse developmental stages and trout isolated testicular cells is sorted according to the 9
trout expression clusters (A-I). Roman numerals (I-VIII) indicate trout developmental stages whereas numeric numbers (0-35)
indicate mouse post-partum days. Samples used for the correlation test are indicated in red. Se = Sertoli cell; Sg = spermatogonia; Sc = spermatocytes; St = spermatids; Tu = mouse seminiferous tubules; Tt = mouse total testes. Log-2 transformed signal
intensities are shown according to respective scale bars.

otic) for these conserved genes, not only confirmed
previous results obtained for trout differentially-expressed
genes, but extended these findings (Additional files 5 and
6). A striking example is that of the transforming growth
factor receptor signalling pathway, for which 8 out of 9
differentially-expressed trout somatic genes were found to
have conserved expression during mouse spermatogenesis
(Bambi, Col1a2, Id1, Nfic, Nfix, Sptbn1a and b and
Smad7). Similarly, 5 of the 6 genes involved in sperm
mobility and/or fertilization that belong to the meiotic/
post-meiotic cluster were also found conserved during
mouse spermatogenesis (Gas8, HistH3, Klhl10, Pvrl3,
Ropn1l and Sapg6). This confirms that identifying genes
with evolutionary conserved expression is an efficient way
to highlight factors with important functions in a given
process.
Trout clones for which corresponding orthologous genes
exhibit correlated expression or are significantly expressed
during mouse spermatogenesis are labelled respectively
"Correlated" and "Expressed" in additional file 1.
Tissue profiling analysis reveals potential testis-specific
genes in trout
We used expression data from 5 non-testicular tissues
(ovary, liver, muscle, gill and brain) hybridized on the

same microarray to identify potential testis-specific genes
and found 121 clones (111 genes) expressed predominantly in the testis with low or no expression in all the
other tissues (Figure 6; labelled "Testis" in additional file
1). Only 23 of these potential testis-specific genes did not
pass the standard deviation filtration step, thus demonstrating highly specific gene expression, not only at tissue
level, but also at cellular level. Thirty four of these genes
belong to somatic expression clusters and include notably
2 genes that are crucial for male gonad development:
Dmrt1, a well-known sexually-dimorphic gene involved
in both Sertoli cell differentiation and spermatogenesis
maintenance [15], and Lhcgr, which encodes the receptor
for LH and chorionic gonadotropins [16,17]. This also
includes genes encoding receptors or extracellular proteins that may account for specific paracrine regulation
within the testis (Ca6, Enpp6, Gpc3, Gpr175, Lgi1b, Lrp1,
Podn, Tgfbr3 and Vmo1). The spermatogonia expression
clusters also contain 14 genes with apparently preferential
expression in the male gonad. Importantly, 6 of these
genes - Cpsf1, Ddx19, Exosc8, Mcrs1, Msi2 and Piwil2, the
latter gene encoding a stem-cell protein essential for germ
cell differentiation [18] - were again found to bear functions related to RNA processing or transport. Finally 73
genes with expression detected in the testis only were
found within the germline and meiotic/post-meiotic

Potential testis-specific genes as revealed by tissue-profiling analysis
Potential testis-specific genes as revealed by tissue-profiling analysis. Genes were selected on the basis of their high
expression (average signal intensity ≥3rd quartile) in at least one testicular sample and low or null expression (average signal
intensity < median) in 5 non-testicular tissues (Ovary, Liver, Muscle, Gill, and brain). Genes are displayed according to 3 broad
expression clusters (i.e. somatic, spermatogonia and meiotic/post-meiotic). Roman numerals (I-VIII) indicate trout developmental stages. Sg = spermatogonia; Sc = spermatocytes; St = spermatids. Log-2 transformed signal intensities are shown
according to the scale bar.

expression clusters: They consistently contained a number
of genes coding for proteins known to be important in
meiosis and/or spermatid development (Dmc1, Dnah9,
Dnajb13, Dnal1, Gmcl1, Nek2, Nme5, Spata4, Trip13
and Zw10). In addition they contained genes encoding
proteins localized on or involved in the mobility of flagella and cilia (c10orf63, c14orf143, Dnah8, Efhc1, Rshl3
and Ttll9) that are relevant sperm cell components. In
addition, several transcription factors and cell cycle regulators that could be important for the progression
throughout meiosis were found (Cdkn3, Lcmt1, Polr2i,
Smc4, Styxl1 and Xccr3). It can be noted that when exploring enrichment for GO annotations linked to potential
testis-specific genes, only terms related to meiosis or spermiogenesis were highlighted (Additional files 5 and 6), as
previously observed in mammals [19].
Attention should be given to genes expressed in the
female trout gonad as they are apparently also candidate
genes for the male gonad function. Importantly, 67 additional genes highly expressed in the testis were also found
to be expressed in the mature ovary (Additional file 7;
labelled "Gonad" in additional file 1), including some
genes already known to be important for meiosis or
oocyte differentiation (Ccna1, Nmp2, Psmc3ip and
Sycp3l). Also among this group of transcripts, a majority
were annotated with functions related to cell proliferation
or cell cycle regulation (Ada, Cdkn1c, Cks1b, Gsg2, Nasp
and Pdcd6), spindle formation and chromosomal positioning or structure (Kntc2 and Smc2), DNA replication
or repair (Cdt1, Mcm5, Nasp, Pold3, Recql5 and Rfc4)
that are all of obvious interest for germ cell development.
Candidate genes of interest in spermatogenesis regulation
To gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms that drive
spermatogenesis we focused on genes preferentially
expressed in the somatic cell compartment and may be
involved in cell fate commitment during early testis maturation or in driving germ cell differentiation throughout
the male reproductive cycle. This was performed by
searching for genes encoding transcriptional regulators
(corresponding to the following GO term "transcription
factor activity"; GO:0003700), growth factors (growth factor activity; GO:0008083), receptors for growth factors
(growth factor binding; GO:0019838 and "growth factor
receptor activity" terms) or a more general class of extracellular proteins (extracellular space; GO: 0005615) in all
4 somatic cell expression clusters. Expression profiles of
these genes are presented in figure 7.

We next performed in situ hybridization to localize
expression for some of the somatic genes selected above.
In order to validate our In Situ hybridization (ISH) protocol and the quality of the gonad samples we investigated
the expression of genes of known cellular origin. The gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/546

encoding the anti-Müllerian hormone, Amh, was strongly
detected in Sertoli cells in the early stages I-II (Cluster C;
Figure 8A) and, in agreement with its microarray expression profile, the staining progressively decreased in Sertoli
cells in maturing testes and at the spawning stage (data
not shown). The signal for Ddx4, the gene encoding the
Drosophila VASA homolog, was strongest in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes (cluster F; Figure 8B) and
decreased in subsequent germ cells in a similar way to the
microarray experiment signals. Finally, the strong signal
detected for Txdnc6 in both spermatocytes and spermatids (Figure 8C) confirmed its meiotic/post-meiotic profile (cluster H). Firstly, we investigated the expression of
Tcf23 (Cluster A), a gene encoding the basic helix-loophelix transcription regulator TCF23 (OUT), that we found
to be preferentially-expressed in both the testis and ovary.
Tcf23 staining was found at each developmental stage in
thin cells very closely associated with spermatogenetic
tubule borders (Figure 8D), which are likely to be peritubular cells. ISH performed on Igfb7, a gene encoding an
Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (Cluster A)
revealed its expression in the interstitial Leydig cells (Figure 8E). In addition, Igfbp7 mRNA was also detected in
endothelial cells from vessels (data not shown). Ghr2, a
duplicated isoform of the gene encoding the growth-hormone receptor (Cluster A), was found to be expressed in
stage VIII testes in large, round cells present in the interstitial tissue that are likely to be Leydig cells (Figure 8F).
Finally, the expression of Tgfbr3, which encodes the type
III TGF-beta receptor and that was only detected in the testis (Cluster A), was evidenced in interstitial Leydig cells in
stage II testes (Figure 8G). Overall these results further
confirmed our prediction of "somatic", "spermatogonial"
and "meiotic/post-meiotic" expression clusters.

Discussion
We have already applied preliminary large scale expression profiling (i.e., using 1K macroarrays) with the aim of
studying the underlying molecular mechanisms of testis
development at the beginning of the trout reproductive
cycle [20]. In the present study we have confirmed and
considerably extended previous findings, firstly by
increasing the number of genes covered by the microarray,
but also by refining the samples analysed, the gene annotation and the data-mining procedures. The use of testes at
various developmental stages highlighted several gene
activation or repression patterns throughout the reproductive cycle. In addition, using isolated germ cell populations we were further able to distinguish between
somatic cell expression clusters and those corresponding
to proliferating and differentiating germ cells. The identification of somatic genes was also reinforced by the use of
spawning testes. Indeed, due to a dilution-effect resulting
from the accumulation of germ cells, somatic gene expression decreased in maturing testes. On the contrary, in

stage VIII gonads, where no more transcriptionnally active
germ cells reside apart from a few spermatogonial stem
cells, somatic genes are not diluted anymore. Moreover,
this stage highlights somatic genes that undergo specific
regulation as testes mature: low expression in stage VIII
predicts their down regulation while high expression in

stage VIII predicts their up regulation. We have thus
reported the accurate spatio-temporal expression patterns
for hundreds of testicular transcripts associated with the
mitotic, meiotic and post-meiotic phases of germ cell
development as well as with the somatic compartment of
maturing testes in trout.

The establishment and description of transcriptomes
underlying spermatogenesis have been mainly limited to
a few mammalian species, especially in mice, rats and
humans [21]. The broadening of such approaches to other
vertebrates is important if we are to uncover the different
regulatory pathways triggering tubular development, spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal, rapid proliferation and
further differentiation of latter germ cells. In this respect,
the cyclical and progressive features of trout spermatogenesis make it an original and interesting model for studying
hormonal cues and paracrine communications sustaining
germ cell development. In comparison to mammals
where Sertoli cells sustain several generations of germ cells
at the same time, the cystic organization and synchronous
development of germ cell clones indeed make the trout
testes a convenient way of studying cellular communications involved in the specific steps of spermatogenesis.
The present dataset is likely to be of great utility in studying and identifying such networks. An important step forward will then be to understand how these networks are
regulated and what factors (such as sexual steroids or
other hormones) are responsible for the different expression profiles we have identified.
To gain a functional insight into the genes undergoing differential expression during the spermatogenetic process
we undertook a sophisticated annotation procedure of
trout clone cDNAs. This step is of particular importance
when studying species such as trout for which the genome
is not available and only little information exists in public
databases (e.g. only 861 RefSeq entries in NCBI release 34
and 1920 entries in UniProtKB release 15.0 for Oncorhynchus mykiss). The starting point of our procedure was the
use of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) instead of EST contigs that could lead to irrelevant annotations resulting
from assembling errors. The high sequence coverage of
trout clones, i.e. an average of 2.18 ESTs per clone,
allowed us to map most of the corresponding transcripts
on the genome of a closely related organism. For instance,
up to 90% of the trout clones were linked to a potential
fish orthologous gene in at least one of the 4 fish
genomes. When this first mapping step was achieved, the
use of mammalian orthologs and associated GO terms as
provided by the Ensembl database allowed us to improve
the somehow poor annotation of fish genomes. We
believe that this annotation pipeline is more accurate than
directly mapping trout sequences onto phylogenetically
distant species and that such a strategy should be used in
non-model species for which few genomic resources exist.
As a matter of fact, the different expression patterns we
conferred to the somatic compartment of the testis, the
proliferation phase of germ cells or their subsequent differentiation, were consistently associated with annotations that are in agreement with what we know about
these different testicular cell types and their biology. This

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/546

further validated the biological significance and our interpretation of identified expression clusters. Obviously,
some of the inferred orthologs and ontologies may still be
erroneous, due to either partial, supernumerary duplications in fish genomes [22,23] or simply incorrect orthological relationships and annotations provided by the
Ensembl database. Furthermore, even for accurately annotated and true orthologous genes, the biological processes
they are involved in may differ from one organism to
another. However, the use of statistical tests to investigate
the content of expression clusters bypasses these issues by
highlighting only relevant, either enriched or depleted,
GO terms.
The search for mammalian trout gene orthologs was also
carried out with the aim of comparing underlying expression programs in testis development and spermatogenesis
in fish and mice. Genes that exhibit similar expression
patterns in different species are very likely to play key roles
in a given process. Their expression conservation indeed
suggests that evolutionary forces act strongly on promoter
regulatory regions and corresponding transcriptional regulators so that the encoded proteins achieve their functions both in a specific cell type and at a precise
developmental stage. By comparing trout and mouse
expression data we were able to identify genes not only
expressed in the testes of both species but that display
similar developmental expression patterns. These
included genes more likely to be expressed in the germline
and that tend to accumulate during the course of the spermatogenetic process, but also somatic genes that exhibit
decreasing expression from puberty onwards as a consequence of their relative dilution. Here again the annotation was of great importance to compare expression
profiles of accurate pairs of genes. From this point of view,
it is important to note that the subgroup of correlated
genes contained a number of genes with one-to-many or
many-to-many orthologous relationships. Whereas this
category of orthologs may lead to false correlated genes is
still a possibility. We also believe that for such ambiguous
sequence-based orthologs, expression conservation is a
relevant way of identifying true orthologs at a functional
level. The complement of conserved genes we have
reported here is therefore likely to contain key factors fulfilling important functions during spermatogenesis that
have been maintained throughout evolution and deserve
special attention. On the other hand, the absence of correlation observed for a number of genes may underscore
original pathways that may account for specific regulations in each species. It could also reflect species-specific
features of spermatogenesis such as morphological organization and spatio-temporal development of the testis,
and may thus represent molecular events that are difficult
to detect or to observe in other species. However, it
remains hard to distinguish between genes exhibiting true

diverging expression profiles from discrepancies due to
either wrong orthological relationships or artefacts due to
the different technologies used to produce the two datasets.
Whereas several aspects of spermatogenesis such as events
associated with meiosis and spermiogenesis are well conserved across species, testis organization and biology differ on certain points between amniote (reptiles, birds,
mammals) and anamniote (fishes and amphibians) vertebrates [8]. Importantly, the number of spermatogonial
generations, i.e. the number of mitoses spermatogonia
undergo before meiosis, and the signalling regulating
their differentiation is more specific to each species. In teleost fish testes, the molecular mechanisms triggering testis
maturation are still poorly understood. A few growth factors that are produced by Sertoli cells and regulate germ
cell proliferation and fate have however been identified.
These include the TGF family members activin [24], antiMüllerian hormone (AMH) [25] and gonadal somaderived factor (GSDF) [26], as well as an ortholog of the
platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF)
[27]. Importantly, Amh expression was found to be inhibited by 11-ketotestosterone, a teleost fish-specific androgen, and this steroid-mediated suppression of AMH
action was sufficient to allow full completion of spermatogenesis in the eel [25]. This led AMH to be considered
as a spermatogenesis-preventing substance and suggested
that the initiation of meiosis in fish may occur through
the suppression of an inhibitory activity rather than direct
activation. In this regard, the cluster of somatic genes
exhibiting apparent down regulation during the reproductive cycle, which includes the Amh and Inhba genes themselves, is of peculiar interest (cluster B). In an attempt to
discover further factors that may sustain testicular maturation and could regulate spermatogonial cell proliferation
and the onset of meiosis, we focused on those genes
encoding extracelullar and transcription factors within the
somatic expression clusters. In addition to the aforementioned genes Amh and Inhba, several well-known genes
with important implications in testis development or
spermatogenesis could be found: Dmrt1 and Sox9a are
orthologs of mouse genes expressed in Sertoli cells and
encode key transcription factors for testis differentiation
[28,29]; Etv5 encodes a transcription factor, ERM, of
which the expression in adult Sertoli cells controls spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal in mice [30]; Inha
encodes a TGF family member that inhibits spermatogonia proliferation [31] and FSH production by the pituitary
gland through a negative regulatory loop. Furthermore,
we investigated the expression of previously uncharacterized factors in trout testes. Ghr2 encodes an isoform of the
growth hormone (GH) receptor and was found to be
expressed in Leydig cells. This localization is consistent
with our finding that GH regulates steroidogenesis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/546

around spawning [12,32]. This factor could also take part
in the local production of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1
(IGF1), which in turn might regulate the proliferation
and/or differentiation of spermatogonia as previously
proposed [33-35]. In addition, we have demonstrated that
Igfbp7, which encodes an IGF-binding protein, is
expressed in Leydig cells. This factor could therefore control the availability of other secreted factors and thus
modulate germ cell proliferation. IGFBP7 is indeed a
strong growth suppressor that can bind IGF1 and IGF2 as
well as activin [36,37]. Furthermore, IGFBP7 was shown
to inhibit activin-enhanced FSH-stimulated expression of
Cyp19a1 and to suppress estradiol production in rat granula cells [38]. This suggests that IGFBP7 could similarly
control the local production of steroids in the testis.
The large number of differentially-expressed genes we
have reported here, i.e. almost 46% of the genes analysed,
is most likely to reflect the important changes in cellular
composition throughout spermatogenesis and the wide
variety of underlying molecular and cellular functions in
this process. In particular, germ cells undergo an extraordinary cellular differentiation process and fulfil unique
functions in the organism. Their expression program
therefore significantly differs from that of somatic cells
and notably involves the expression of many testis specific
gene products. To address this issue in trout, we used
expression data from 5 non-testicular tissues to identify
transcripts only detected in the testes or the gonads. Not
surprisingly, most of these genes were expressed within
the germline, especially in the meiotic and post-meiotic
germ cells. However, a few of them were also found in
somatic expression clusters, notably including Dmrt1 and
Lhgcr, and may be involved in original pathways leading
to successful sustaining of germ cell development. We
investigated the expression of such a gene, Tgfbr3, and
found it was expressed in Leydig cells. Tgfbr3 encodes the
Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor type III
(TGFBR3 or betaglycan), which orchestrates the TGF-beta
superfamily signalling by binding both BMP and TGFbeta members [39]. Notably, TGFBR3 was shown to function as an inhibin co-receptor with activin receptor type II
(ActRII) and to mediate functional antagonism of activin
signalling by conferring inhibin sensitivity [40]. Betaglycan might thus play an important role within the testis in
regulating paracrine actions of activin and inhibin produced in response to gonadotropes. We also demonstrated that Tcf23, a gene detected only in gonads from
both sexes, was expressed by peritubular cells. Tcf23
encodes the basic helix-loop-helix factor TCF23 (also
called OUT), a transcriptional repressor involved in
myoblast differentiation in mammals [41], for which
expression in testicular contractile cells is thus relevant.
Tissue-specific expression is often correlated with important physiological roles for a gene in that tissue and the

testis and gonad specific genes we identified may have
important implications during spermatogenesis or testis
development. Besides, these testis-specific genes are also
of great interest to identify common cis DNA regulatory
elements responsible for their restricted expression in the
male gonad.

or growing numbers (Stage IIb, n = 4) of actively-dividing
type B spermatogonia - testes in early maturation stages
(April-May) also containing large numbers of meiotic
spermatocytes (Stage IIIb, n = 3) and post-meiotic spermatids (Stage V, n = 4) - finally, fully mature spawning testes producing milt (October) and containing essentially
mature spermatozoa (stage VIII, n = 3).

Conclusion
In this study we investigated the underlying expression
program in trout testis development and spermatogenesis
using cDNA microarrays. In addition to genes preferentially expressed in germ cells at each differentiation stage,
our expression profiling analysis has revealed several distinct somatic gene expression clusters that may sustain
germ cell survival and testis maturation throughout the
male reproductive cycle. Furthermore, to point out and
provide the community with the most promising and
important genes, we identified potential trout testis-specific genes as well as evolutionary-conserved genes
involved in spermatogenesis in vertebrates. In addition to
the accurate annotation of trout genes represented on the
microarray, our dataset represents a valuable and solid
base for further investigating the molecular mechanisms
involved in testis differentiation and the onset of spermatogenesis in fish.

Methods
Animals and sampling
Male rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were obtained
from the INRA experimental fish farm (Drennec, France)
where they were maintained under natural conditions of
light and photoperiod at 10°C under constant photoperiod. Experimental research on animal reported here was
performed in conformity with the principles for the use
and care of laboratory animals in compliance with French
and European regulations on animal welfare. Furthermore experimenters were delivered an authorization
given by the French "Direction des Services Vétérinaires"
to conduct or supervise experimentations on live animals.
Sampling was performed at several times throughout the
complete annual reproductive cycle (see below). Testes
were recovered, weighed to determine the gonadosomatic
index (GSI) and tissue were rapidly immersed in paraformaldehyde or Bouin's solution for further histological
analyses, or frozen until RNA extraction. Accurate determination of testicular developmental stages was achieved
by combining histological analysis of Bouin's solution
fixed samples (on the basis of the most differentiated
germ cell type present in the gonad) and GSI, as previously described in details [12,42].

The samples retained for the microarray experiment
included: - testes in early immature stages (FebruaryMarch) containing either exclusively slowly-dividing type
A spermatogonia (Stage I, n = 5); - rare (Stages IIa, n = 4)

Germ cell isolation
Germ cell isolation procedures were adapted from previously described protocols [43]. Briefly, pooled testes from
immature males (stages I-II) or from individuals in early
maturation staging (stages III-IV) animals were minced
into small pieces and digested using collagenase (2.2 mg/
ml) in Ca2+ free Hank's medium for 6 hours at 12°C,
under gentle agitation. Cell suspensions were rinsed in
L15 medium and gently shaken overnight in L15 medium
with 1% BSA. Cell suspensions were allowed to sediment,
the supernatants were discarded and the cell pellets were
gently homogenized in L15 medium with 1% BSA using a
Dounce homogenizer. The resulting cell suspensions were
filtered through nylon gauze (150 μm pore size) and subjected to an additional homogenization in a Dounce
homogenizer. The cell suspensions were filtered again
using nylon gauze (50 and 20 μm pore sizes) and pelleted
by centrifugation at 50 g for 10 and 5 minutes. The cell
pellets were resuspended in L15 medium with 1% BSA,
loaded onto 90% percoll gradients and centrifuged for 40
min at 500 g and 5 min at 50 g. The upper floating layers
were recovered, rinsed in L15 medium with 1% BSA and
filtered using nylon gauzes (20 μm pore size) prior to centrifugal elutriation (JE5 Beckman Instruments). Cell separation was performed at constant rotation speed (2000
rpm) and increasing flow rates (6.6, 7.8, 8.6, 9.5, 10.5,
13.5, 13-15.1, 19 and 21 ml/min) in L15 media with 1%
BSA. Collected fractions were rinsed and pelleted. An aliquot was transferred in Trizol reagent and stored at -80°C
for RNA extraction and transcriptome analysis (see
below). An aliquot of each fraction was also used for
microscopic observation after fixation in Bouin's solution,
double inclusion in agar then parrafin, 4 μm sectioning
and trichrome coloration. Spermatogonia-enriched samples (n = 6) were obtained by pooling 19 and 21 ml/min
elutriation fractions obtained from immature fish. They
contained 30 to 90% type-A spermatogonia and 70 to 0%
type-A and type-B spermatogonia, and included less than
10% Sertoli cells. Spermatocyte-enriched samples (n = 6)
correspond to 8.6 - 9.5 ml/min fractions obtained from
mature gonads. They contained ≥70% primary spermatocytes, contaminated with B spermatogonia or secondary
spermatocytes. Spermatid-enriched samples (n = 3) correspond to 6.6 and 7.8 ml/min pooled elutriation fractions
and contained ≥90% post meiotic cells.

cDNA microarray experiment
cDNA microarray construction
cDNA microarrays were generated using CRB GADIE
http://www-crb.jouy.inra.fr/ as previously described [44].
Briefly, 9023 rainbow trout cDNA clones from pooled-tissue libraries [45,46] were amplified by PCR using vectorspecific primers. PCR products were evaporated, resuspended in water and spotted onto nylon membranes (7.6
× 2.6 cm; Nybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences) using a
Biorobotics MicroGrid-II arrayer (Genomics Solution).
Spotted membranes were then denatured (150 mM
NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl), neutralised (1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
1.5 M NaCl), washed (2× SSC) and fixed (80°C for 2
hours, UV 120000 μJ).
RNA extraction and cDNA target synthesis
Total RNA was extracted from either entire gonads or isolated germ cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), quantified on a NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific) and
quality-controlled on a Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent). For
cDNA target labelling, 5 μg of RNA were reverse-transcribed for 2 hours at 42°C in presence of radiolabelled
dNTP (30 μCi [alpha-33P] dCTP, 120 μM dCTP and 20
mM dATP, dTTP and dGTP) using an oligo(dT) primer
and 400 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 46 μl. RNA was degraded at
68°C for 30 min with 1 μl of 10% SDS, 1 μl of 0.5 M
EDTA and 3 μl of 3 M NaOH. The reaction was then equilibrated (room temperature, 15 minutes) and neutralised
(10 μl of 1 M Tris-HCI and 3 μl of 2 N HCl).
Microarray hybridization and raw data production
Prehybridization of microarrays was performed in a
hybridization buffer (5× Denhardt's, 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS)
at 65°C for 4 hours. Labelled cDNA targets were denatured at 95°C for 5 minutes and incubated with microarrays for 48 hours at 65°C in the same buffer. Microarrays
were then washed three times for 1 hour at 68°C (0.1×
SSC, 0.2% SDS) prior to exposure to phosphor-imaging
plates for 65 hours. Plates were finally scanned using a
FUJI BAS 500 and signal acquisition was performed using
BZscan software [47]. Each microarray was also hybridized (but at 42°C) with a 33P-labelled oligonucleotide
(TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) that recognizes a vector
sequence in every PCR product to quantify the amount of
cDNA present in each spot.
Normalisation procedure
Raw expression data were first corrected for the amount of
spotted cDNA by dividing the sample signal of each spot
by its corresponding vector signal (Si/Vi) [48]. This procedure is efficient in correcting between-array spotting differences but also simultaneously biased results relative to
gene expression levels: sample signals corresponding to
low vector signals are indeed artificially increased in com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/546

parison to those with high vector signals which are minimized. To avoid this bias, the corrected sample signal of
each spot was further multiplied by the median vector signal of this same spot on all the arrays ((Si/Vi) × medVi).
Expression values were then Log-2-transformed and subjected to a quantile-quantile normalisation [49] using
AMEN software http://sourceforge.net/projects/amen/
[50]. Raw data as well as a normalised expression files are
available on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; GSE16029).
Statistical and cluster analyses
Overall similarities in gene expression across all samples
were first computed by means of supervised hierarchical
clustering using Cluster (uncentered correlation, average
linkage) and the corresponding dendogram was generated
using TreeView [51].

Non-informative clones for which the quantity of cDNA
spotted was too low (oligonucleotide signal < 3 times the
background level in more than 20% of samples) were
removed prior to statistical analyses. A permutation test
(F's statistic, FDR ≤5‰) was used to identify differentially-expressed transcripts during spermatogenesis by
comparing all sample groups to each other (Stage I, n = 5;
stage IIa, n = 4; stage IIb, n = 4; stage IIIb, n = 3; stage V, n
= 4; stage VIII, n = 3; spermatogonia, n = 6; spermatocyte,
n = 6; and spermatid, n = 3) as previously described
[19,52] using AMEN software. Highly differentiallyexpressed genes were selected on the basis of their standard deviation (SD ≥ 0.4) from the median expression of
selected samples (Stages I, IIIb, V, VIII, spermatogonia,
spermatocytes and spermatids). Differentially-expressed
transcripts were subjected to the PAM clustering algorithm
using AMEN software and grouped into 9 expression clusters according to both developmental stages and isolated
germ cell fractions. PAM algorithm was performed using
"standardized" signal intensities, so that genes were classified according to their relative expression profile. However for heatmap representations, "non-standardized"
signals were used to range genes according to their expression level within each cluster using the hierarchical classification algorithm. This heatmap representation is more
informative as it accounts for the range of dynamic expression of genes as well as for their co-regulation.
Tissue-profiling analysis
Expression data corresponding to normal adult ovary,
liver, muscle, gill and brain samples hybridized on the
same microarray platform were corrected as described
above. All expression files were then merged and subjected to a quantile-quantile normalization step. The
median cell type and tissue replicate expression values
were computed and an empirical approach was used to
identify preferentially-expressed transcripts in each tissue.

A transcript was considered expressed predominantly in a
given tissue if its normalized expression signal was in the
25% highest (≥3rd quartile) and in the 50% lowest (<
median) in all other tissues. Of note is that the median
signal intensity of a microarray is a commonly accepted
estimation of the background and that expression signals
under this value can thus be considered as not expressed
or at least not detected.
Functional data mining
Trout cDNA annotation strategy
All 20008 ESTs corresponding to the 9023 clones used for
the microarray were obtained http://www.sigenae.org and
mapped on the masked genome (RepeatMasker program)
of 4 model fish species (Danio rerio, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Orizias latipes and Takifugu rubripes) using the BLAT
algorithm [53] in RNA, DNA, translated RNA and translated DNA modes (minimal score ≥30 and identity
≥60%). For each EST, the best matches (best score plus
scores ≥0.95* [best score]) on each genome were retained
(Additional file 8). Each match was further associated
with exonic, intronic or intergenic regions of existing
genes (Ensembl gene ID) using the "ensGene.txt" file provided by the UCSC Genome Browser http://
genome.ucsc.edu/[54,55]. The corresponding Ensembl
protein family ID and the Ensembl gene IDs of Fish
orthologs were also extracted using the Ensembl BioMart
(version
52;
http://www.ensembl.org/index.html;
[56,57]). The genes matched by each EST in the 4 fish species were then compared and the number of times that
orthologous genes or genes from the same protein family
were found was counted (Confidence index "n" in additional file 1). Each clone was then annotated with the EST
exhibiting the highest confidence index "n". For these
genes, the corresponding gene name, description, and
their mouse, rat and human orthologs were also extracted
from the Ensembl database. Only clones for which the
retained EST exhibited a confidence index "n" ≥2 or that
matched at a distance of ≤500 base pairs from a predicted
Ensembl gene with a BLAT score ≥50 were further considered (Annotation status labelled "confident" in additional
file 1).
GeneOntology term analysis
GO terms ("biological process", "molecular function" and
"cellular component") associated with all retained
Ensembl genes as well as their fish, rat, mouse and human
orthologs were extracted using the Ensembl BioMart
(Ensembl version 52) and associated with the corresponding trout clones. Functional mining of expression clusters
was then performed by searching for overrepresented GO
terms (Gaussian hypergeometric test) in comparison with
the whole set of well-measured genes using AMEN software. To avoid gene redundancy and as the search for
trout orthologs was performed in 4 different species, only

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/546

one Ensembl gene ID was returned for each clone, using
the following order of preference depending on the information available for the species: Gasteosteus aculeatus,
Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes or Takifugu rubripes. Ambiguously annotated clones for which the corresponding EST
mapped several genes were not considered. GO terms
were considered as overrepresented when the p-value was
≤10-6 and ≥3 non-redundant genes bearing this term were
found within the corresponding cluster. To avoid redundancy between closely related terms an Ontology Specific
Information Rate (OSIR [50] cut-off of ≥0.95 was
selected).
Cross-species comparison
For each fish Ensembl gene ID, the mouse ortholog
Ensembl gene ID(s) and corresponding Affymetrix GeneChip probeset(s) (Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array) were
extracted from the Ensembl database (version 52; Additional file 1). Mouse data for postpartum testis development (GEO repository: GSE12769) and isolated testicular
cells [19](ArrayExpress repository: E-TABM-130) were
downloaded and pre-processed using the RMA normalization module with AMEN software. Sample replicates were
averaged and the following filtration procedure was
applied: Mouse genes with significant testicular expression levels (Signal ≥ background expression cut-off (overall dataset median)) in at least one developmental stage
and orthologous to trout differentially-expressed genes
were first selected. Among them, genes exhibiting highly
similar expression patterns (correlation coefficient ≥0.8)
between trout (developmental stage I, IIb, IIIb and V) and
mouse (day postpartum 0, 8, 18 and 30) were then
selected.
In situ hybridisation
Bacterial clones were obtained from the CRB GADIE
resource centre (Jouy-en-Josas, France) or the USDA
(Washington D.C., USA): tcay0040.e.21 (Amh),
1RT40G14_C_D07 (Ddx4), tcaa0002.a.02 (Txndc6),
tcbk0026.d.10
(Tcf23),
tcbk0016.d.20
(Igfbp7),
1RT91I23_A_E12 (Ghr2) and tcbk0046.o.19 (Tgfbr3).
Briefly, clones were grown in LB-ampicillin medium, plasmids were extracted and cDNA inserts were amplified by
PCR using vector-specific primers. PCR products were
purified and used as templates for digoxigenin (DIG)labeled probe synthesis using the Riboprobe® Combination system - T3/T7 RNA polymerase (Promega).

In Situ Hybridization experiments were performed on 5
μm sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed and paraffinembedded trout testes. After dewaxing and rehydration,
all the following steps were performed using the InsituPro
VS automate (Intavis Bioanalytic Instruments). Briefly,
sections were post-fixed (paraformaldehyde 4%, 20 min),
permeated for 20 min at 37°C with 1 μg/mL Proteinase K,

for 10 min in 50 mM glycine and post-fixed again (paraformaldehyde 4%, 10 min). Slides were then pre-hybridized for 2 hours at 60°C (formamid 50%, 2× SSC, 1×
Denhardt, dextran sulfate 10% and yeast tRNA at 250 μg/
mL) and hybridized for 12 hours at 60°C with 2 ng/μL of
DIG-labeled cRNA probes in the same buffer. After
hybridization, the sections were treated for 30 min at
37°C with RNase (10 μg/mL in 2× SSC), washed successively at 37°C in 2× and 0.1× SSC, coated for 40 min in
2% sheep serum and incubated for 2 hours with alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche
Applied Science; 1:1000) in 2% sheep serum. Slides were
finally rinsed, revealed for 12 hours with NBT/BCIP and
mounted in Mowiol solution.

qPCR validation of microarray expression profiles. Total RNAs (2 μg,
DNAse-treated) were submitted to reverse-transcription (RT) using random hexamer primers and MMLV reverse transcriptase for 2 hours at
37°C. Real-time PCR assays were performed on the StepOne™ Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using 1:120 diluted RT products and
the Fast SYBR® Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The amplification program consisted of an initial denaturation at 95°C for 20 seconds;
40 cycles of 95°C for 3 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds; and a final progressive increase of temperature (From 65°C to 90°C, 0.5°C/second) for
melting curve analysis. Cycle threshold (Ct) was manually setup and relative expression levels were normalised using an empirically designed reference gene, Rps15 (clone 1RT58B15_B_A08). Efficiency (95-105%) of
PCR amplification was verified using serial dilutions of pooled RT products and the melting curve analysis was performed at the end of each real
time PCR assay to control for specificity. Stage effects were determined
using a non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskall-Wallis test). Forward (FW)
and reverse (RV) primers were as follows: Amh (FW-GGGAATAACCATGCTATCCTGCTTAA; RV-CTCCACCACCTTGAGGTCCTCATAGT),
Dmrt1 (FW-GGACACCTCCTACTACAACTTCTA; RV-GTTCGGCATCTGGTATTGTTGGT), Rps15 (FW-CCTGGGGGAGTTCTCTATCACCT; RV-GGGATGAAACGGGAAGAATGTGT), Slc26a4 (FWCGGCACAAACATATACAGGAA; CCACCGTGACTCTCAATCGTTCT), Sox9a (FW-GTATTTCCAGTTCTTTCAGCCA; RV-TTTGCTATCTAGTTGTGTACGG), Sox9b (FWAGCAGCAGTTGGATTCTAAAGTC; RV-ACACTTCTCCTGTTCGTCTG), Tbx1 (FW-CTTCGGCTACTAGTGCTGTGGAA; RVCAACCTCCCAACCTTCTAACCTC). Roman numerals (I-VIII) indicate testicular developmental stages. GA and GB = type A and type B spermatogonia, repsectively; Sc = spermatocytes; St = spermatids. Log-2
transformed signal intensities from microarrays are also shown (Mean+SD, left panels).

Functional mining ("molecular function" and "cellular component")
of trout spermatogenetic clusters. Over-represented "molecular function" and "cellular component" terms from the GeneOntology (GO) were
identified in the 9 expression clusters shown in Figures 2 and 3 (A-I). Rectangles indicate the observed (left) and expected (right) numbers of genes
bearing the corresponding GO term whereas the number of genes exhibiting this GO term on the entire microarray is given on the left. Only GO
terms with a p-value ≤ 10-6 and for which at least 3 non-redundant genes
belonged to the cluster were considered as statistically-enriched. To avoid
redundancy between closely related terms an Ontology Specific Information Rate (OSIR) cut-off ≥0.95 was selected. Numbers in bold indicate a
statistical enrichment for a given GO term according to the scale bar.

Enriched GO terms associated with trout spermatogenesis expression
clusters. An Excel file containing all enriched GeneOntology terms ("Biological process", "Molecular function" and "Cellular process") for the 9
clusters shown in Figures 2 and 3. Only GO terms with a p-value ≤ 10-6
and for which at least 3 non-redundant genes belonged to the cluster were
considered as statistically-enriched, as previously mentioned. A low Ontology Specific Information Rate (OSIR) cut-off ≥0.05 was selected to allow
redundancy between closely related terms.

Tissue-specific gene expression in trout. Tissue-specific genes were identified on the basis of their high expression (average signal intensity ≥3rd
quartile) in at least one tissue (Testis, ovary, Liver, Muscle, Gill, or brain)
and low or no expression (average signal intensity < median) in the 5
other tissues. Testis and Gonad specific genes are displayed according to 3
broad spermatogenesis expression clusters (i.e. somatic, spermatogonia
and meiotic/post-meiotic). Log-2 transformed signal intensities are shown
according to the scale bar.
