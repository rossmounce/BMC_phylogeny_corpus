Abstract
Virtually all cases of cervical cancer are caused by persistent infections with a restricted set of
human papillomaviruses (HPV). Some HPV types, like HPV16 and HPV18, are clear and powerful
carcinogens. However, the categorization of the most weakly carcinogenic HPV types is extremely
challenging. The decisions are important for screening test and vaccine development. This article
describes for open discussion an approach recently taken by a World Health Organization
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs Working Group to re-assess the
carcinogenicity of different HPV types.

Background and rationale
As a group, human papillomaviruses (HPV) are proven
human carcinogens. But there are >> 100 HPV genotypes
and only a small fraction have any known carcinogenic
potential [1]. Therefore, moving from broad acceptance of
the carcinogenicity of persistent HPV infection to specific
conclusions about individual genotypes requires consideration of each type as an individual agent. Such a typeby-type evaluation proves to be very difficult, and
stretches epidemiology to its limits because of issues of
confounding and misclassification detailed below. However, as described in the accompanying article by Castle
[2], it is important for the development of screening tests
and vaccines to judge each HPV type separately; thus, it is
worth considering how well one actually can decide
whether a given HPV type is carcinogenic or not. This article describes an approach taken by a Working Group of
the World Health Organization International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC), when asked to re-assess for
official purposes which HPV types should be grouped as

carcinogens [3]. The process is described here to promote
needed debate on what an improved approach might be.
IARC formally considers the carcinogenicity of exposures
to humans. Whereas human carcinogenicity might best be
considered for some agents like HPV as a continuum of
probabilities without a clear breaking point, IARC classifies carcinogens categorically as carcinogenic (Group 1),
probably carcinogenic (Group 2a), possibly carcinogenic
(Group 2b), not classifiable (Group 3), or probably not
carcinogenic (Group 4). There has been very little experimental work on the carcinogenicity of HPV types except
for HPV16 and HPV18; thus, epidemiologic evidence has
been unusually important. Epidemiologic evidence for
the carcinogenicity of HPV was originally presented in
IARC Monograph Volume 64 [4], and was extensively
updated in IARC Monograph Volume 90 based on data
available as of February 2005 [5]. In February 2009, Volume 100b updated the data once again and it is this latest
update addressed here. For the purposes of IARC, epidePage 1 of 8

miologic evidence is categorized as sufficient, limited,
inadequate or suggesting lack of carcinogenicity. The epidemiologic data are combined with experimental evidence (in this case lacking for most HPV genotypes) to
arrive at the final Groups 1–4.
HPV carcinogenicity has been established most convincingly for cervical cancer, and this discussion will be limited to cervical carcinogenicity. To date, no HPV type has
been proven to be carcinogenic only at sites other than the
cervix.

HPV evolution as the guiding principle of HPV
behaviour (the high-risk clade)
HPV behaviour at the cervix is strongly correlated with
phylogenetic (i.e. evolutionary) categories [6]. All HPV
genotypes that are known to be cervical carcinogens
belong to the alpha genus in an evolutionary branching or

clade containing a few genetically related species (Figure
1). Epidemiologic data do not support cervical carcinogenicity for other species in the alpha genus or for other
genera. To save considerable space presenting null evidence, this section will not include data related to HPV
species alpha-1, -2, -3, -4, -8, -10 (other than HPV 6), -13,
or 14/15. These species contain HPV types that cause skin
or genital warts, minor cytologic atypia, and often no
apparent disease.
In Monograph 64 in 1995, HPV 16 (alpha-9) and HPV 18
(alpha-7) were classified as cervical carcinogens. HPV 31
and HPV 33 in alpha-9 were categorized as probably carcinogenic [4]. In 2005, the group of cervical carcinogens
(Group 1) was expanded to include the following 13
types: alpha-5 genotype HPV 51; alpha-6 genotypes HPV
56 and HPV 66; alpha-7 genotypes HPV 18, HPV 39, HPV

45, and HPV 59; and alpha-9 genotypes HPV 16, HPV 31,
HPV 33, HPV 35, HPV 52, and HPV 58 [5].
In the four years between Monograph 90 in 2005 and the
recent update, new evidence further supported that HPV
types in the high-risk clade of the alpha genus HPV type
cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer worldwide [7,8].
In case-control studies, the odds ratios associating cervical
cancer and its immediate precursor, CIN3, with HPV DNA
positivity for these types in aggregate has consistently
exceeded 50. It is persistent infections that are associated
with extremely high absolute risk of CIN3 and cancer. In
cohort studies, women who test negative to this group of
HPV types are at extremely low subsequent risk of CIN3,
cancer, and cancer death for more than 10 years [9-11].
Because persistent infection with a restricted group of
HPV types is a nearly necessary cause of cervical cancer, a
reconsideration of HPV and cervical carcinogenicity based
on the new data must decide whether any additional types
within the high-risk clade are also carcinogenic and
whether any types in that clade that were previously categorized as carcinogenic should be downgraded. The types
in the high-risk clade are listed in Table 1.

tions are present in a large minority of women, although
they might not be transmitted from the same partner or at
the same time. Given the existence of some very powerfully carcinogenic types, notably HPV 16 and HPV 18,
determining which weaker and/or less common types are
also carcinogenic becomes (for the epidemiologist) an
issue of confounding. None of the traditional approaches
to control of confounding are entirely successful. Because
HPV 16 causes approximately 50% of cases of cervical
cancer, logistic regression and similar approaches will parsimoniously attribute cases associated with both HPV16
and a less important type to HPV16. HPV 18 is the second
most important cervical carcinogen, responsible for
approximately 15–20% of cervical cancer of all histologic
types combined (and a higher fraction of adenocarcinomas). If a type occurs with either HPV 16 or HPV 18, its
association with cervical cancer might be confounded by
either of these powerful carcinogens. For types causing
only a very small fraction of cervical cancer, confounding
by any of the more important types is possible.

From a virologic perspective, the definitive proof of carcinogenicity of an HPV type is finding transcriptionally
active HPV in a tumour. HPV is not a "hit and run" carcinogen, and transcriptional activity is needed for maintenance of the cancer phenotype. In cervical cancer cell
lines, blocking transcriptional activity by antisense RNA
leads to apoptosis. This level of evidence is simply lacking
for virtually all HPV types. The vast body of evidence
relates simply to finding HPV DNA at the same time of
cervical neoplasia.

Dealing with confounding by exclusion, i.e. examining
the possibility of carcinogenicity of a more minor type
among cancer specimens that do not contain a more
important type, becomes a problem of misclassification.
This main epidemiologic criterion used for classification
of an HPV type as a carcinogen, finding the HPV genotype
as a single infection in a cervical scrape or biopsy specimen in a woman with cancer, might sometimes be too lax
and prone to error. Colposcopic biopsies and cytology
specimens can be misdirected and fail to obtain the critical cells, while contamination of scrapes and biopsies
from lower-grade lesions that often surround cancers can
detect types other than the causal one. Studies relying on
testing of microdissected cervical malignancies will
address these issues, but large-scale highly accurate data
are not yet available.

However, relying on testing of scrapes or biopsies, by
DNA testing, leads to difficulties. The alpha HPV types
share a common route of transmission and multiple infec-

Difficulty with control selection adds another level of
complexity in assessing carcinogenicity. Cervical cancer

ted at young ages usually become undetectable by DNA or
RNA assays and no sensitive serologic assay exists to measure HPV exposure. Consequently, odds ratios based on a
comparison of HPV prevalence at the time of case diagnosis to age-matched HPV point prevalence in controls do
not estimate true relative risks.
There is not much type-specific prospective data on the
carcinogenicity of individual HPV genotypes. The available studies have categorically shown the unique carcinogenicity of HPV 16 and, to a lesser extent, HPV 18 [9,12].
Khan et al. observed a risk for the remaining women positive by hc2 after excluding those positive for HPV 16 or
HPV 18 (including an unknown mix of the types 31, 33,
35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68) of only 3.0% (1.9–
4.2) compared with 0.8% (0.6–1.1) among women who
were HPV negative at baseline. Thus, there is not strong
and convincing long-term prospective evidence for individual HPV types other than HPV16 and HPV18.
Finally, the accuracy of detection of HPV genotypes differs
between the major PCR-based systems used to generate
most of the data [13]. Each of the systems shows differential sensitivity, and some have exhibited cross-reactivity of
detection. These detection issues are not critical for evaluating the most important HPV types, but make it difficult
to clarify the role of the most weakly carcinogenic and
least common ones.
With these caveats, the cervical carcinogenicity of the HPV
types listed above varies in strength in a continuum without clear breakpoint, from extremely strong (i.e. HPV 16
and, to a lesser degree, HPV 18) to weak, but still probably
carcinogenic in rare instances (e.g. HPV 68, see below).
Evaluators taking one extreme position could claim that
there is reasonable evidence for carcinogenicity of virtually all the types in the species listed above, extending further the list established in Monograph 90. Strict
interpreters of causal criteria could argue for a return to a
much more limited list. But based on current evidence, no
cut-point between sufficient, limited, and inadequate epidemiologic evidence is entirely defensible.

Approach taken by the IARC working group
Data Sources
The IARC Working Group chose the following pragmatic
approach to creating an imperfect cut-point between sufficient, limited, and inadequate epidemiologic evidence
for cervical carcinogenicity: Only types in the high-risk
clade were considered because data seemed grossly inadequate for all others. The most recent accumulated data on
type-specific HPV prevalence in cervical cancers were
drawn from a very large single project [7] and from metaanalyses performed by IARC ([8] updated by G. Clifford).
Excluded from consideration were high-grade precancer-

ous lesions (CIN3 and the more equivocal CIN2 which
occur in approximately 1% of screened women), which
often used as ethical surrogate endpoints in prospective
studies and clinical trials; there are now sufficient data for
invasive cancers and it appears that HPV types have different potential to progress from CIN2/3 to invasive cervical
cancer [14]. The background frequency of cervical HPV
infection in the general female population was estimated
from a large meta-analysis of HPV genotypes found in
women with normal cytology [15], as shown in Table 2.
Although women included in meta-analyses of cervical
cancer and normal cytology differed by age, region and
HPV testing protocols, it was considered the best method
to identify a reasonable threshold of confounding and
misclassification for each type. Ancillary analyses examining the issue of most important types by region were also
scrutinised.
Uniqueness of HPV16 and HPV18
Comparing the prevalences in women with normal cytology to the prevalences for cancers compiled by Smith et al.
(2007) (Table 2), obvious "case-control" differences can
be seen. The most clearly carcinogenic genotypes, HPV 16
and HPV 18 in particular, are more common among cancers and cytologically normal women (and even lowgrade lesions [16]). HPV 18 is especially common in adenocarcinomas [17], as are other members of the alpha 7
clade of which HPV18 is a member. The large amount of
data regarding HPV 16 and HPV 18 was thought to provide ample epidemiologic evidence of carcinogenicity
(leading to an overall classification of Group 1).
The 8 most important carcinogenic HPV types
Including HPV 16 and HPV 18, eight HPV types (alpha-7
types HPV 18 and 45, alpha-9 types 16, HPV 31, 33, 35,
52 and 58) are the most common types found in cancers
in both the IARC meta-analysis [8] and the ICO study [7],
in all regions of the world providing data. Though very
often found in non-invasive lesions, these types are all
much more common in cancer case specimens than in
controls, providing sufficient epidemiologic evidence of
carcinogenicity (Group 1).
The borderline carcinogens: using HPV 6 as an estimator of
residual confounding
To move beyond the most evidently carcinogenic eight
HPV types, the Working Group chose an estimator of the
percentage of cancers that might contain HPV DNA by
accumulated and unknown measurement errors alone.
The group made use of HPV 6 for this estimation. Specifically, HPV 6, the important and common cause of benign
condyloma acuminata (external genital warts) was considered to be a low-risk type, not classified as a cervical
carcinogen, which only uncommonly is detected in cervical cancer specimens. [Of note, it remains possible that

HPV 6, and other "low risk types" can cause cancer in
extremely rare virus-host circumstances.] When detected,
even without detection of a more likely causal type, the
Working Group judged that misclassification of some
kind was a more likely explanation than causality. As
given in Table 3, the best IARC estimate of detection of
HPV 6 in cervical cancers, not necessarily as a single infection, was judged to be 0.45%, 95% CI 0.35 – 0.56, based
on 14,912 cases of cancer ([8] updated by G. Clifford for
the Working Group). The Working Group pragmatically
made the following rule: An individual HPV type in the
high-risk alpha clade (i.e. one with an elevated prior probability of being carcinogenic due to analogy to closely
related viral types in the same or closely-related species)
was considered to have sufficient epidemiologic evidence
of carcinogenicity if its prevalence in cancers was 1) significantly greater than that of HPV 6, and 2) significantly
enriched in comparison to the background estimate for
the general population, i.e. women with normal cytology.
By this logic, four more types were categorized as having
sufficient epidemiologic evidence leading to their classifi-

cation as definite (Group 1) carcinogens: alpha-5 type 51
(1.16% of cervical cancer), alpha-6 type 56 (0.78%), and
alpha-7 HPV types 39 (1.29%) and 59 (1.28%).
Classification of other types in the high-risk clade
The remaining types in the high-risk alpha clade were considered, as a group, to have limited evidence to support
carcinogenicity. If phylogeny can be taken to predict
behaviour, it is possible that most of these types can very
rarely cause cancer. Indeed, many of the types have been
detected, albeit uncommonly (not significantly greater
than HPV 6), in cancers. There are not enough data, even
after testing of many thousands of specimens, to be sure
which ones are carcinogenic or not. Furthermore, some of
these types, namely 30, 34, 67, 85 and 97 have not yet
been studied in the IARC cervical cancer meta-analysis
approach. Nevertheless, within this group, there are two
types, alpha-7 type HPV 68 and alpha-11 type HPV 73, for
which the data are slightly stronger than for the others
despite methodologic challenges. One of the major PCRbased testing methods (SPF10) cannot distinguish these
two types because their amplicons using those primers are
identical [18]. Neither of these two types is optimally
detected by MY09-MY11 dot blot [19]. Nonetheless, the
data supporting the carcinogenicity of HPV 68 and HPV
73 are very suggestive although not sufficient. Ultimately,
the existence of a cell line whose immortalization is sustained by a subtype of HPV68 (ME180), led the Working
Group to classify HPV 68 as a probable carcinogen
(Group 2A). The rest were called possible (Group 2B).
Re-classification of HPV 66
Overall, the Working Group approach led to the re-classification from Monograph 90 of HPV 66 to possible
(Group 2B), although the epidemiologic evidence of carcinogenicity was previously judged sufficient (Group 1).
In the assembly of much more testing data from cancer
cases, HPV 66 has been found so rarely that its percentage
of detection is less than the relative percentage of detection among the general population. In the Working
Group review of each individual article, HPV 66 was
found as a single infection in cancers with extreme rarity,
well below the threshold of possible confounding and
misclassification.

Summary
There is no perfect way to categorize a continuum of carcinogenic potential. The Working Group arrived at the following conclusions, with a healthy scepticism concerning
the process:
a) Persistent HPV 16 infection is a uniquely powerful
human carcinogen.

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/4/1/8

b) HPV 18 is also important, particularly for adenocarcinoma.
c) Six additional types in alpha-7 (HPV 45) and alpha9 (HPV 31, HPV 33, HPV 35, HPV 52, HPV 58) comprise the remainder of the eight types that are the most
important globally, with some regional variation in
the etiologic fractions of cancers due to each type.
d) There are small and less certain, incremental etiologic contributions of another group of carcinogenic
types from alpha-5 (HPV 51), alpha-6 (HPV 56), and
alpha-7 (HPV 39 and HPV 59). Each causes a few percent at most of cervical cancer cases worldwide. There
has not been any large-scale study of regional variability for these uncommon types
e) There is an unresolved dividing line between the
HPV types with the weakest evidence judged to be sufficient and those judged to have highly suggestive yet
limited data (e.g. alpha-7 HPV 68 is categorized as
probably carcinogenic due to experimental evidence
while alpha-11 HPV 73 is possible).
f) The expanded data for HPV66 were re-evaluated and
the evidence was judged to be very limited now that
more cases have been studied showing that it is very
rarely found in cancers despite being relatively common in the newly collated data on women with normal cytology. HPV 53, also in alpha species 6, shows
the same pattern of relative common population prevalence with extremely rare cases of occurrence alone in
cancer. The Working Group noted that for these types
in particular, there could be harm to public health if
the types are viewed with excessive concern; including
these types as carcinogenic in screening assays would
decrease the specificity and positive predictive value of
the assays with virtually no gain in sensitivity and negative predictive value [20].
g) There are several types within the high-risk clade
that have extremely sparse or no evidence of carcinogenicity. For some types there are anecdotal but very
interesting cases that merit pursuit of additional carcinogenic types. There have been potentially underappreciated reports of alpha-9 type HPV 70 found as
single infections in cancer, but the supportive data are
sparse. There are only a few reports of HPV 67 in cancer [21-24], which is intriguing because this is the only
known type in the alpha-9 species that is not categorized as carcinogenic. For a few types in the high-risk
clade, no reports of invasive cancers with single-type
infections were found, but isolated reports might exist.

h) The possible role of immunosuppression in HPV
carcinogenicity was not emphasized in the Working
Group discussions. To cause cancer, an HPV infection
must persist and it is possible that some HPV types are
only weak carcinogens because they persist poorly. For
example, the carcinogenicity of alpha-5 type HPV 26
has been supported by a recent report of multiple periungual cancers in an immunosuppressed individual,
containing high viral loads and active transcription of
HPV 26 alone [25]. HPV 26 is an uncommon type;
perhaps the immunosuppression in this individual
was a significant contributor to carcinogenesis. As one
avenue of research, there should be more studies of
whether HPV types in invasive cancers in HIV-infected
individuals differ in type from the types found in
immunocompetent individuals [25].

Conclusion
When epidemiology serves as the science informing public health policy, its limitations must be acknowledged.
Weak causal associations with one HPV type are extremely
hard to prove in the presence of powerful confounding by
strong carcinogens like HPV16. A coming generation of
intensive molecular studies of microdissected cancers,
with examination of transcriptional activity, may clarify
the borderline between carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic HPV types. For public health purposes, the main
agents that merit consideration in screening tests and vaccines have already been identified.
