Abstract
Background: DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) activity is absent in many, but not all, disease
isolates of Neisseria meningitidis, as a consequence of the insertion of a restriction endonucleaseencoding gene, the 'dam replacing gene' (drg) at the dam locus. Here, we report the results of a
survey to assess the prevalence of drg in a globally representative panel of disease-associated
meningococci.
Results: Of the known meningococcal hyper-invasive lineages investigated, drg was absent in all
representatives of the ST-8 and ST-11 clonal complexes tested, but uniformly present in the
representatives of the other hyper-invasive lineages present in the isolate collection (the ST-1, ST4, ST-5, ST-32 and ST-41/44 clonal complexes). The patterns of sequence diversity observed in drg
were consistent with acquisition of this gene from a source organism with a different G+C content,
at some time prior to the emergence of present-day meningococcal clonal complexes, followed by
spread through the meningococcal population by horizontal genetic exchange. During this spread
a number of alleles have arisen by mutation and intragenic recombination.
Conclusion: These findings are consistent with the idea that possession of the drg gene may
contribute to the divergence observed among meningococcal clonal complexes, but does not have
a direct mechanistic involvement in virulence.

Background
Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia, is a common inhabitant
of the human nasopharynx, being asymptomatically carried by approximately 10% of the population [1,2]. There
is evidence for extensive horizontal genetic exchange in
populations of this antigenically and genetically variable
Gram-negative bacterium [3-7] but, despite the diversity
of carried meningococci, only a limited number of geno-

types – the hyper-invasive lineages – are responsible for
most reported disease [8]. These lineages have been identified by the techniques of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis [9] and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) [10]
as clonal complexes. In recent years, the ST-1 complex
(formerly subgroup I), ST-4 complex (subgroup IV), and
ST-5 complex (subgroup III) have dominated meningococcal disease in Africa and Asia, while members of the ST11 (ET-37) complex, ST-8 complex (cluster A4), ST-41/44

complex (lineage 3), and ST-32 (ET-5) complex have
caused most disease in other parts of the world. Meningococci occasionally cause epidemic outbreaks of varying
scale up to global pandemics, although at a given point in
time disease in a given geographical locale is often dominated by a limited number of clonal complexes [8].

isolates chosen to represent the known diversity of pathogenic meningococci [10]. The results suggest that, while
drg is present in some lineages but not others, this gene
has spread in the meningococcal population by horizontal genetic exchange, possibly after the introduction of the
drg gene from an exogenous source.

DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) is an enzyme
involved in the mismatch repair system of bacteria. During DNA replication, only the parental strand is fully
methylated by the enzyme, since methylation is not
immediate, allowing a mismatch on the newly synthesised strand to be excised and replaced [11]. Disruption of
Dam activity suggests that mismatch repair will be less
effective, potentially allowing the creation of frameshift
mutations in the homopolymeric or simple repeat motifs
within the promoter or coding regions of surface antigen
genes leading to the reversible switching of their expression state. This is an important mechanism found at bacterial loci that encode gene products that are
advantageous under certain conditions but not others;
such genes have been termed contingency loci [12]. There
is extensive evidence for such loci in the meningococcal
genome [13]. In particular, the ability to vary the expression state of surface-exposed cellular components is
important for within host adaptation, for example by
allowing evasion of the immune response in the
nasopharynx. These mechanisms are also important in the
occasional transition from harmless colonisation to invasive disease [14-16]. Examples of such loci described in
the meningococcus to date include: the capsular polysaccharide [17]; the Opc outer membrane protein [18-20];
pili [21]; the PorA protein [22]; and opacity proteins
[19,23].

Results

Dam methylation has been implicated in modifying the
virulence of a number of bacterial pathogens [24-26], but
its role in N. meningitidis has been contentious. Bucci et
al., 1999 [27] suggested that the absence of Dam activity
was responsible for high rates of phase variation in the
siaD capsule gene, resulting in an increased virulence of
some strains. In addition, the latter work suggested that all
pathogenic isolates lacked Dam activity, the dam gene
inactivated by the insertion of a putative restriction endonuclease, named 'dam replacing gene' (drg), with the genotypes dam+/drg- and dam-/drg+ being mutually exclusive.
However, two subsequent studies [28,29] have found no
effect. The drg gene encodes a restriction enzyme, NmeBII
that is similar to the Streptococcus pneumoniae DpnI restriction endonuclease which cleaves at GmeATC, but not at
GATC, sequences [30,31].
In the present study the prevalence of drg and its association with disease-associated isolates of N. meningitidis was
examined by a survey of its distribution in a collection of

Distribution of dam and drg among invasive meningococci
In all cases, there was an exact correlation with the presence of dam and the absence of drg, and vice-versa. Of the
84 isolates tested, 23 were indicated to be dam+/drg- and
61 to be dam-/drg+ by restriction analysis and PCR amplification (see Additional file 1). The presence of dam or drg
was associated with particular clonal complexes. Of the
hyper-invasive lineages included in the analysis, all ST-8
complex and ST-11 complex isolates were dam+/drg-, while
all of the representatives of the ST-1, ST-4, ST-5, ST-41/44,
and ST-32 complexes were dam-/drg+.
Diversity of drg gene fragment sequences
The level of nucleotide diversity, as represented by
number of alleles and polymorphic sites, along with the
p-distances seen within drg gene fragments was similar to
that seen with the housekeeping genes used for MLST
(Table 1), with a total of 19 different fragment sequences
(drg-1 – drg-19) present in this collection. The ratio of
non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS,
0.11) was also similar to that seen in the MLST gene fragments. Three drg gene fragments (drg-13, drg-14 and drg15) exhibited polymorphisms resulting in single base
frameshifts, two resulting in stop codons (Figure 1) and
one fragment (drg-16) had an insertion corresponding to
a 24-base direct repeat. The G+C content of drg at 42.4%
was lower than that of the housekeeping genes, which
were in the range 51.1–57.4%.

Split decomposition analysis of the drg fragment
sequences generated a star phylogeny with some net-like
phylogenetic structure involving the drg-2 allele (Figure
2). The distribution of the different drg sequences
amongst the clonal complexes is also shown in Figure 2.

Discussion
The meningococcus is an example of an accidental pathogen, a commensal organism that rarely causes disease and
which gains no evolutionary benefit from this process
[32]. A complete understanding of the diseases caused by
such organisms is dependent upon an appreciation of the
mechanisms by which harmless carriage develops into
invasive disease [33]. The observation that some meningococcal genotypes, the hyper-invasive lineages, are more
likely to cause disease than others [8,10] suggests that
comparative studies of disease-associated and carried
meningococci may identify genetic factors responsible for

disease [34]. In this context, the suggestion that the possession of a single genetic change, the insertion of the drg
gene at the dam locus, was essential for virulence in
meningococci [27] was attractive as it provided a single
characteristic associated with the disease phenotype. Further, this proposal provided a plausible mechanistic
explanation, namely the promotion of rapid switching of
expression of contingency genes, for example those
encoding the capsule which represents the best defined
meningococcal virulence determinant [35]. This is consistent with the evidence that inactivation of Dam has

been shown to affect rates of recombination and phase
change in other species [25,36].
The data presented here, however, do not support the contention that the drg insertion is preferentially associated
with disease-associated meningococcal isolates, even
those expressing serogroup B capsular polysaccharide.
There was no evidence of a difference between diseaseassociated and carried meningococcal isolates with 76%
(45/59) of disease-associated isolates and 75% (11/15) of
carrier isolates possessing the drg insertion. The isolate

collection employed by the present investigation was chosen to be globally representative of meningococcal disease
in the latter part of the 20th century, with multiple examples of each of the major hyper-invasive meningococci
identified over this period. When analysed by clonal complex, which identifies hyper-invasive lineages, it was
apparent that the drg insertion was absent from all of the
isolates representing the ST-8 and ST-11 clonal complexes,
both major hyper-invasive lineages but, conversely, drg
was present in all representatives of the hyper invasive lineages represented by the ST-1, ST-4, ST-5, ST-41/44, and
ST-32 complexes. This association was independent of the
serogroup expressed by the isolates and provided a likely
explanation of the earlier observations [27]. As meningococcal disease in a given locale at a given time tends to be
dominated by a limited number of clonal complexes [8],
it is likely from the results provided here that a given sam-

ple of disease-associated isolates collected from a given
locale will be uniform at the dam locus. At a given point
in time they may be dominated by drg containing meningococci, while at other times isolates without this insertion might dominate. For example, as both the ST-1 and
ST 32 complexes contain the drg insertion, this insertion
would be prevalent among the disease isolates recovered
by the pandemic outbreaks caused by these clonal
complexes [37,38]; conversely, the spread of ST-11
meningococci [39,40] would result in an increased prevalence of disease-associated meningococci without the drg
insertion. This observation highlights the importance of
assembling genetically defined isolate collections with a
prescribed sampling frame if comparisons of meningococci with potential for virulence are to be undertaken.

It has been suggested that the drg gene has been introduced into Neisseria from an exogenous source [30]. The
difference in the G+C% content of the drg gene compared
to the meningococcal housekeeping genes was consistent
with this idea; however, the levels of diversity among the
drg alleles, which was similar to that observed in the
meningococcal housekeeping genes, along with the
reported occurrence of drg in other Neisseria species [30],
suggested that this was a relatively old event predating the
emergence of present-day clonal complexes. The ratio of
non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS),
which was also similar to that observed in meningococcal
housekeeping genes, suggested that the drg gene had been
subject to stabilising selection for conservation of function since its putative introduction into the meningococcal population, although the possession of frame shift
mutations in some of the drg alleles demonstrated that, as
with N. lactamica, not all meningococci possessing the drg
insertion expressed the endonuclease [30]. In other
respects the distribution of the gene among clonal complexes and the patterns of nucleotide sequence variation
observed were similar to those seen in meningococcal
housekeeping genes, suggesting that it is subject to similar
selection pressures [41].
The presence of multiple methylation systems is a characteristic of the Neisseria and may be related to the transformable nature of these organisms [42]. Whole genome
comparisons of meningococci belonging to different
clonal complexes frequently yield different restriction
modification systems as the principal detectable genetic
differences [43,44]. It is attractive to speculate that the
genetic isolation of clonal complexes may be promoted
by such differences [45] and in this respect the insertion
of drg in the dam locus, replacing a methylase with an
endonuclease, may provide a potent barrier to genetic
exchange from dam+ to drg+ meningococci; indeed, while
there was evidence for the occasional horizontal genetic
exchange of drg alleles among the genetically diverse
meningococci that possess the insertion, there was no evidence for the transformational loss of drg from a given
clonal complex among the isolates examined here. This
concept of genetic isolation among lineages receives some
support from the possession of porB2 alleles by members
of the dam+ ST-8 and ST-11 complexes and porB3 alleles by
the clonal complexes with the drg insertion [9,39], but the
evidence for limitations in gene flow between these subgroups of meningococci is not at present conclusive.

Conclusions
While it is possible that the possession of the drg insertion
may influence meningococcal population structure, the
data presented here do not support a direct association of
this genotype with meningococcal virulence.

Methods
Bacterial isolates
The 84 isolates used in this study (see Additional file 1)
were a subset of a collection of 107 diverse meningococci
assembled to develop and validate the MLST scheme for
Neisseria meningitidis [10]. The collection included representatives of the major hyper-invasive lineages and has
been characterised at many genetic loci (full details of this
isolate collection are available at http://pubmlst.org/neis
seria/).
Restriction digestion of chromosomal DNA
The methylation status of the chromosomal DNA of each
isolate was determined by restriction digestion with the
restriction endonucleases DpnI, DpnII, and Sau3AI, followed by separation of the digestion products by agarose
gel electrophoresis. Each enzyme specifically recognises a
cognate target site of GATC and cleaves this site depending
on whether it is methylated or not: DpnI cleaves this target
sequence only when N6-methyladenine is present within
the recognition sequence; DpnII cleaves only unmethylated sites, and Sau3AI cleaves both methylated and
unmethylated target sequences.
PCR amplification and nucleotide sequence determination
The presence of the dam gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed using dam specific
primers, DamF1 (5' – TAAAATGGGCAGGCGGCA – 3')
and DamB2 (5' – CGTAAGGGGGATCGCAAT – 3'). These
amplify a 534 bp fragment from the 5' end of the dam
gene in dam+ strains but not from dam-strains. The presence of drg was determined by PCR using primers DrgF1
(5' – CATGAATTTATTTTTCGATA – 3') and DrgB2 (5' –
AATTTGCAACTGTTGGCG – 3') that bind to drg internal
sites and produce a 705 bp fragment in isolates containing
the drg gene. PCR amplification was also performed using
primer pairs Drg5F (5' – TGTCTAAAGAACTCAAAG – 3')
/ DrgB3 (5' – CGGTATCGAAAAATAAAT – 3') and Drg3F
(5' – ATCCATCCAATTTCCCCA – 3') / DamB5 (5' – AAATGCCGTCTGAA – 3') based on dam and drg coding regions
in order to confirm that dam inactivation was due to drg
insertion.

Amplicons corresponding to the drg gene were purified by
precipitation with poylethylene glycol and sodium chloride as described previously [46] and their nucleotide
sequences determined on both strands by cycle sequencing. BigDye™ terminators (ABI, Foster city, California) and
the same primers as used for amplification were employed
in the extension reactions and the labelled reaction products separated on an ABI 3700 automated DNA
sequencer. Each fragment was sequenced at least once on
each strand and the sequences assembled with the STADEN suite of computer programs. Each unique drg

sequence was assigned an arbitrary allele number in order
of discovery.
Data analysis
Percentage G+C was calculated using the program START
[47]. Split decomposition analysis of the drg gene fragments was performed using SPLITSTREE, version 3.1 [48].
The proportion of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions was calculated by the method of Nei and Gojobori [49] using the program MEGA2 [50].
