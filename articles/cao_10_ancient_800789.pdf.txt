The ancient function of RB-E2F Pathway: insights
from its evolutionary history
Lihuan Cao†, Bo Peng†, Lei Yao, Xinming Zhang, Kuan Sun, Xianmei Yang, Long Yu*

Abstract
Background: The RB-E2F pathway is conserved in most eukaryotic lineages, including animals and plants. E2F and
RB family proteins perform crucial functions in cycle controlling, differentiation, development and apoptosis.
However, there are two kinds of E2Fs (repressive E2Fs and active E2Fs) and three RB family members in human. Till
now, the detail evolutionary history of these protein families and how RB-E2F pathway evolved in different
organisms remain poorly explored.
Results: We performed a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of E2F, RB and DP (dimerization partners of E2Fs)
protein family in representative eukaryotic organisms. Several interesting facts were revealed. First, orthologues of
RB, E2F, and DP family are present in several representative unicellular organisms and all multicellular organisms we
checked. Second, ancestral E2F, RB genes duplicated before placozoans and bilaterians diverged, thus E2F family
was divided into E2F4/5 subgroup (including repressive E2Fs: E2F4 and E2F5) and E2F1/2/3 subgroup (including
active E2Fs: E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3), RB family was divided into RB1 subgroup (including RB1) and RBL subgroup
(including RBL1 and RBL2). Third, E2F4 and E2F5 share more sequence similarity with the predicted E2F ancestral
sequence than E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3; E2F4 and E2F5 also possess lower evolutionary rates and higher purification
selection pressures than E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3. Fourth, for RB family, the RBL subgroup proteins possess lower
evolutionary rates and higher purification selection pressures compared with RB subgroup proteins in vertebrates,
Conclusions: Protein evolutionary rates and purification selection pressures are usually linked with protein
functions. We speculated that function conducted by E2F4/5 subgroup and RBL subgroup proteins might mainly
represent the ancient function of RB-E2F pathway, and the E2F1/2/3 subgroup proteins and RB1 protein might
contribute more to functional diversification in RB-E2F pathway. Our results will enhance the current understanding
of RB-E2F pathway and will also be useful to further functional studies in human and other model organisms.

Background
The RB-E2F pathway is crucial for regulating cell cycle
progression and tumorigenesis [1]. Proteins that are
related to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor RB and
the E2F transcription factor are conserved in most
eukaryotic lineages, including animals and plants [2].
The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene was the first
tumor suppressor gene to be identified. RB-family members are generally believed to function through their
effects on the transcription of genes regulated by the

E2F proteins. In human, RB1 (pRb), RBL1 (p107), and
RBL2 (p130) constitute a small RB family [1,2].
E2F proteins, which share a conserved DNA binding
domain, can bind to overlapping sets of target promoters. In human, there are eight E2F genes (E2F1, E2F2,
E2F3, E2F4, E2F5, E2F6, E2F7, and E2F8) [2-4]. E2F1-6
all possess one E2F-TDP domain, and E2F1, E2F2, and
E2F3 are generally considered as the ‘active E2Fs’ on the
basis of their ability to potently activate transcription.
E2F4 and E2F5 are named as the ‘repressive E2Fs’,
which bind their targets coincident with their repression
in G0/G1, and only modestly activate transcription [3,4].
E2F1-5, combined with DP family proteins, can interact
with the ‘pocket protein’ family protein (RB1, RBL1, and

RBL2). DP family proteins, which contain one E2F-TDP
domain and one DP domain, are dimerization partners
of E2Fs. E2F6, also possessing one E2F-TDP domain but
no RB binding domain, can not bind to RB family proteins [5].
E2F7 and E2F8 own two E2F-TDP domains, and can
bind to DNA in the absence of interaction with a DP
subunit. However, they lack sequences required for RB
family protein binding [2-4].
We will use E2F1-6 family to refer to classic E2F proteins (E2F1, E2F2, E2F3, E2F4, E2F5 and E2F6), and
E2F7/8 family to refer to E2F7 and E2F8 proteins in this
manuscript.
During past two decades, a large number of studies,
mainly conducted on flies, worms and vertebrates
[2,6,7], have characterized the molecular properties and
functions of RB-E2F pathway. It has been revealed that
RB family proteins and E2F family proteins function in a
wide range of biological processes, including DNA replication, mitosis, mitotic checkpoint, DNA-damage checkpoints, DNA repair, differentiation, development and
apoptosis [2,6,7]. The functional conservation of RB-E2F
pathway in different organisms (human, mouse, worm
and fly) were found and reviewed [2]. Although, distributions of transcription factors including E2F, RB, DP
proteins were reported in eukaryotic lineages recently
[8], the detail evolutionary history of E2F family has not
been explored. The evolutionary history of RB family
had been investigated previously, but usually only with
limited organisms [9,10].
Taking the advantage that more and more genomes
had been completely sequenced, we probed the evolutionary history of RB-E2F genes in eukaryotic lineages.
Totally, 21 representative eukaryotic organisms were
selected for E2F, RB, and DP proteins identification.
There are 16 organisms from metazoan (Homo sapiens;
Canis familiaris; Bos Taurus; Mus musculus; Rattus norvegicus; Gallus gallus; Xenopus tropicalis; Danio rerio;
Tetraodon nigroviridis; Strongylocentrotus purpuratus;
Branchiostoma floridae; Ciona intestinalis; Caenorhabditis elegans; Drosophila melanogaster; Nematostella vectensis; and Trichoplax adhaerens), one choanoflagellate
(Monosiga brevicollis), two plants (Arabidopsis thaliana;
Oryza sativa), one social amoebae (Dictyostelium discoideum AX4), and one green algae(Ostreococcus tauri).
Previously, it was thought that RB-E2F pathway was
missed in fungi [2], and it was true for yeast (such as S.
pombe and S. cerevisiae). However, we found that some
fungi own E2F family and DP family proteins, for example: Encephalitozoon cuniculi, belonging to microsporidia which are once thought to be protists but now
known to be fungi [11], owns one E2F1-6 family protein
(gi (|19074054), and one DP family protein (gi|
19074276). However, no RB family protein is found in

E. cuniculi and other Fungi, and so RB-E2F pathway
might be not complete in fungi, we did not cover fungi
proteins in detail analysis.
It is worth to mention that several reasons made some
representative model organisms to be selected. The placozoan T. adhaerens, represents a primitive metazoan
form, and is a basal eumetazoan lineage that diverged
before the separation of cnidarians and bilaterians [12].
The sea anemone N. vectensis is a non-bilaterian animal,
a member of the phylum Cnidaria [13]. The unicellular
choanoflagellate (M. brevicollis) is the closest relatives of
metazoans, which represents a distinct lineage that
evolved before the origin and diversification of metazoans [14]. D. discoideum AX4, a soil amoeba, branched
from the lineage that ultimately led to the metazoa
before yeast but after plants, the social amoebae are
exceptional in their ability to alternate between unicellular and multicellular forms [15]. O. tauri is a genus of
unicellular coccoid or spherically shaped green alga, and
is the smallest known free-living eukaryote [16].
In this study, we explored particularly, (1) the distribution of RB, E2F genes in eukaryotic lineages; (2) the
details about gene duplication events and evolutionary
history of RB, E2F genes in metazoa; (3) different evolution rates and selection pressures in subgroup proteins
of RB, E2F family; (4) the function insights from the
evolutionary history of RB-E2F pathway.

Methods
Protein Sequence identification

Using Human E2F4, DP1, E2F7, and RB protein as a
query, we performed PSI-Blast searches (E-value less
than e-5 as cut-off) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Web site http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/ to screen the non-redundant protein database from 21 organisms [17]. All the new results were
used as queries to carry out a second round of BLAST
search, until no new sequence was found. BLASTP
search was also performed in Ensembl database http://
www.ensembl.org/ for above organisms. In addition,
TBLASTN searches were also carried out at (NCBI)
Web site. The collected protein sequences were then
analyzed by SMART [18] and Pfam [19] for domain
architecture.
As E2F1-6 family, E2F7/8 family, and DP family share
some sequence similarity, all of them own the E2F-TDP
domain, we use below criterions to classify them: all
E2F1-6 members only have one E2F-TDP domains, and
share more sequence similarity to human E2F4 than to
human E2F7 or DP1; All E2F7/8 members have two
E2F-TDP domains, and share more sequence similarity
to human E2F7 than to human E2F4 or DP1; all DP
family members have one E2F-TDP domain and one DP
domain, and share more sequence similarity to human

distance values for all protein sequences in each subgroup were computed. Then average values of group
pairwise distances were calculated. Pair Student’s T Test
was used as statistical evaluation. For group average Ka/
ks value comparisons, all Ka/ks values for all proteincoding DNA sequences in each subgroup were first
computed for further study.

DP1 than to human E2F4 or E2F7. Some retrieved
sequences were discarded on the basis of the following
criteria: (1) partial sequences or sequences resulting
from frameshifts in the underlying mRNA as a result of
cloning artifacts or possible aberrant alternative splicing;
(2) Protein sequences which did not contain almost the
entire E2F-TDP domain or RB domain (3) duplicated
database submissions of the same sequence; and alternatively spliced isoforms.

Results

Protein name used in this study

The origination and distribution of E2F1-6, E2F7-8, RB,
and DP family proteins in Eukaryotes

For proteins from H. sapiens, M. musculus, C. elegans,
D. melanogaster, A. thaliana, and O. sativa, we named
them by using their symbols in genbank. For proteins
from other organisms, which are unnamed in genbank,
we named them on the basis of their evolutionary relationship to human proteins. For all the proteins, we also
added their organisms as suffix. Abbreviations of organism names can be found after the conclusions section.
Phylogenetic analysis

Multiple alignments were performed by MUSCLE 3.6
[20] and Clustal X [21] with the default settings. Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were constructed by using
PHYML V.2.4 [22], with 500 bootstrap resamplings and
JTT setting, and Gamma parameter values were estimated from the data set using the Tree-Puzzle program
[23]. Bayesian inference (BI) was performed using the
MRBAYES (version 3) package [24], with a mixture of
protein evolution models, fixed rate, 100,000 generations, sampling every 100th generation and discarding
initial 25% trees.
Prediction of Ancestral Protein Sequences

Gapped Ancestral Sequence Prediction program (GASP)
[25] was used to predict ancestral sequences from phylogenetic trees and the corresponding multiple sequence
alignments.
Computing Protein distances and selection pressures

Pairwise distances between proteins were calculated in
MEGA 4.0 [26] with the amino acid Poisson correction
model, uniform rates among sites and lineages, pairwise
deletion. The protein-coding DNA sequences were collected from genbank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and
Ensembl database http://www.ensembl.org/. The protein-coding DNA sequences were aligned based on their
protein alignments at the web server http://www.bork.
embl.de/pal2nal/[27]. The codeml program in PAML
(3.0) [28] was used for estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates (Ka/Ks, Ka, Ks) in pairwise comparisons of protein-coding DNA sequences
with the Nei-Gojobori method [29]. For group average
pairwise distance value comparisons, all pairwise

Based on protein similarity searching and domain associations checking (Detail in material and methods section), E2F1-6, E2F7/8, RB, DP family proteins were
identified in representative organisms. At last, 70 E2F1-6
family proteins, 25 E2F7/8 family proteins, 34 DP family
proteins, and 41 RB family sequences were identified in
21 eukaryotic organisms (Figure 1). The accession numbers and sequences of all these proteins are listed in
additional File 1.
We found that unicellular organisms, D. discoideum
AX4, O. tauri, and M. brevicollis contain the representative orthologues of E2F1-6, DP, and RB family (figure 1).
Based on the phylogenetic relationship among fungi and
other organisms, the absence of RB and E2F genes in
some fungi (such as S. pombe and S. cerevisiae) might
due to gene losses in evolution. And as mentioned in
the introduction section, fungi E. cuniculi, own E2F
family protein (gi:19074054) and DP family proteins
(gi:19074276), but no RB family protein.
For the multicellular organisms, we found that all
multicellular lineages possess orthologues of E2F1-6,
DP, and RB family. E2F7/8 family genes were present
in protist M. brevicollis, animals, and plants. So E2F7/
8 family originated before the separation of protists,
animals, and plants. However, orthologues of E2F7/8
were not found in D. melanogaster, C. elegans, B. floridae, and S. purpuratus. We speculated that E2F7/8
family was not as indispensable as E2F1-6, RB, and DP
family.
Detailed Evolutionary relationship of the E2F, RB, and DP
family in metazoa

Phylogenetic analysis for E2F, RB and DP proteins from
representative eukaryotic organisms were carried out
(results could be found in additional File 2). However,
the higher sequence variation from distantly related
eukaryotic organisms disrupted the global phylogenetic
results, and made global phylogenetic trees not very
robust and reliable. As our main interest was on the
evolution of RB-E2F pathway in metazoa, the phylogenetic analyses on E2F, RB, and DP family in metazoan
organisms were performed, and the results were discussed in detail.

Figure 1 Distribution of RB-E2F proteins in 21 representative Eukaryotic organisms. The gene number of E2F1-6, E2F7/8, RB, and DP
family in 20 representative Eukaryotic organisms were listed. M. brevicollis, D. discoideum, and O. tauri are unicellular organisms. The phylogenetic
relationship of these organisms was drawn according to the results of proteome-based phylogeny [12,15]. The accession numbers and
sequences of all these proteins are listed in additional File 1.

Evolution of E2F1-6 family, E2F7/8 family proteins in
metazoa

There are 61 E2F1-6 family proteins identified in 16
metazoan genomes (Figure 1). Both maximum likelihood
method (ML) and Bayesian Inference method (BI) were
employed for phylogenetic analyses, E2F-Mb
(gi:167523471), the E2F protein from M. brevicollis, was
used as an outgroup. Both methods produced nearly
identical topologies (Figure 2).
In our analysis, E2F1-6 family proteins were divided
into E2F4/5 subgroup and E2F1/2/3 subgroup with high
statistical supports (Figure 2A). In vertebrates, the E2F1/

2/3 subgroup could be again divided into two classes:
E2F1/2/3-vert subgroup and E2F6 subgroup (Figure 2).
The genbank accession numbers of proteins in the
Figure 2 could be found in additional File 1. E2F1-6 family
proteins in Figure 2A were also summarized in Table 1.
It was found that the placozoan, T. adhaerens, owns
bone fide member E2F1/2/3-Ta (gi:196010483) in E2F1/
2/3 subgroup, and E2F4/5-Ta (gi:196012606) in E2F4/5
subgroup. Non-bilaterian animal sea anemone (N. vectensis), bilaterian invertebrates S. purpuratus, B. floridae,
and C. intestinalis all possess their representative genes
in E2F1/2/3 subgroup and E2F4/5 subgroup (Figure 2,

branches indicate ML bootstrap support (only greater than 50% values are labeled), and red numbers above branches indicate Bayesian posterior
probabilities (only these key branches are labeled). The scale bar shows the number of substitutions per site. The detail information for protein
names used in this figure can be found in materials and methods section. The accession numbers and sequence of all these proteins are listed
in additional File 1. (A) Phylogenetic analyses of E2F1-6 family, and E2F-Mb (gi:167523471) was used as the outgroup; (B) Phylogenetic analyses

According to results from Figure 2A, E2F1-6 family proteins (accession numbers from genbank or Ensembl database) identified in M. brevicollis and 16 metazoan
organisms were listed. The detail explains could be found in main text.

Table 1). This indicated that the first gene duplication
for E2F1-6 family happened before placozoans and bilaterians separation.
In vertebrates, the number of E2F1-6 family member
dramatically increased. All human E2F1-6 family proteins could found their direct orthologues in T. nigroviridis (Figure 2, Table 1), indicating all human E2F1-6
family proteins emerged in early vertebrates, and gene
duplications in E2F4/5 subgroup and E2F1/2/3 subgroup
happened before tetrapoda and teleostei divergence (Figure 2, Table 1). In detail, our results demonstrated that
human E2F1, E2F2, E2F3 and E2F6 emerged by gene
duplications of the common E2F1/2/3 subgroup ancestor. And E2F1/2/3 subgroup members from invertebrates T. adhaerens, S. purpuratus, B. floridae, and C.
intestinalis, which we named them as E2F1/2/3-Ta,
E2F1/2/3-Sp, E2F1/2/3-Ci, and E2F1/2/3-Bf, should be
recognized as the co-orthologues of human E2F1, E2F2,
E2F3 and E2F6 genes. Human E2F4 and E2F5 emerged

by gene duplications of the common E2F4/5 subgroup
ancestor. And E2F4/5 subgroup members from invertebrates T. adhaerens, N. vectensis, S. purpuratus, B. floridae, and C. intestinalis, which we named them as E2F4/
5-Ta, E2F4/5-Nv, E2F4/5-Sp, E2F4/5-Bf, E2F4/5-Ci,
should be recognized as the co-orthologues of human
E2F4 and E2F5 genes. It needs to be mentioned that
though E2F6 emerged together with E2F1, E2F2 and
E2F3 from E2F1/2/3 subgroup ancestor, it lost the RB
binding domain and did not function in classical RBE2F pathway [2], and we will not discuss it later.
Species-specific gene duplications and gene losses were
also found in E2F1-6 family in vertebrates. H. sapiens, C.
familiaris, M. musculus all own 6 members of E2F1-6
family, T. nigroviridis has 8 members of E2F1-6 family,
with two E2F4 (E2F4-1-Tn(ENSTNIT00000002389),
E2F4-2-Tn (ENSTNIT00000002758)) and two E2F6
(E2F6-1-Tn(ENSTNIT00000008935),
E2F6-2-Tn
(ENSTNIT00000013829)). There are 5 members of

Cao et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:55
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/55

E2F1-6 family in B. Taurus, with E2F5 orthologue absent;
4 members in R. norvegicus, with E2F2 and E2F5 orthologues absent; 5 members in G. gallus, with E2F2 orthologue absent; 4 members in X. tropicalis, with E2F2, E2F6
orthologues absent; 4 members in D. rerio, with E2F1
and E2F orthologues absent (Figure 2, Table 1).
It is a little surprise that so many gene losses happened in the E2F1-6 family in vertebrates. However, we
found that all vertebrates have at least one member
from E2F1/2/3 subgroup, and also one member from
E2F4/5 subgroup (Figure 2, Table 1).
The ancestral E2F gene duplication happened before
placozoans and bilateria separation. Therefore, bilateria
D. melanogaster and C. elegans should theoretically have
representative orthologues of E2F4/5 subgroup and
E2F1/2/3 subgroup. However, in our analysis, dE2F1Dm, dE2f2-Dm, efl-1-Ce, and efl2-Ce all failed to be
clustered into E2F1/2/3 subgroup or E2F4/5 subgroup,
possibly due to their high sequence divergence.
In the further analysis (such as Blast), we found that
dE2F2-Dm, EFL-1-Ce share more sequence similarity
with mammalian E2F4, E2F5 than with E2F1, E2F2,
E2F3. In contrast, dE2F1-Dm shares more sequence
similarity with E2F1, E2F2, E2F3 than with E2F4, E2F5.
In addition, conversation of exon-intron structure for
dE2F2-Dm, EFL-1-Ce, human E2F4, and E2F5 gene
(Figure 3, additional file 3) was also found. We speculated that dE2F2-Dm and EFL-1-Ce belong to E2F4/5
subgroup, while dE2F1-Dm belong to E2F1/2/3 subgroup. And this classification was also consistent with
results of previous functional studies which indicated
that EFL-1-Ce and E2F2-Dm usually functioned as
repressive E2Fs, while E2F1-Dm functioned as active
E2Fs [2]. For EFL-2-Ce, as no function was reported
and its sequence is highly diverged, we have no cues
whether EFL-2-Ce is a product of species-specific duplication from EFL-1-Ce or a function lost gene which
early derived from E2F1/2/3 subgroup. And we will not
discuss it later. In anyway, the representative functional
gene from E2F1/2/3 subgroup was absent in worm.
For E2F7/8 family (Figure 2), as mentioned in previous
section, E2F7/8 family originated in early eukaryotes.
However, orthologues of E2F7/8 subgroup were absent in
S. purpuratus, B. floridae, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster
(Figure 2B, Table 2). For E2F7/8 family, the first
gene duplication happened before tetrapoda and teleostei
divergence. By the way, protein E2F8-Xt (ENSXETG
00000004436), which did not have the first E2F-TDP
domain, and only have the second E2F-TDP domain, was
not covered in our evolutionary analysis.
Evolution of RB family and DP family proteins in metazoa

There are 36 RB family proteins identified in 16
metazoan genomes (Figure 1). Both ML method and BI

Page 7 of 21

method were employed for phylogenetic analyses,
RB-Mb (gi:167523296), the RB family protein from
M. brevicollis, was used as an outgroup. Both methods
produced nearly identical topologies (Figure 4). All the
RB family proteins in Figure 4 were also summarized in
Table 2.
RB family proteins were divided into RB1 subgroup
and RBL subgroup with high statistical supports in
metazoa (Figure 4). The placozoan, T adhaerens, owns
bone fide member RB1-Ta (gi:196012646) in RB1 subgroup, and RBL-Ta ((gi:196011866) in RBL subgroup.
No-bilaterian animal sea anemone (N. vectensis) only
possesses one gene of RB family, and was clustered into
RBL subgroup in ML and BI phylogenetic analysis, Bilaterian, S. purpuratus and B. floridae, also possess their
representative members in RB subgroup and RBL subgroup respectively. This indicated that the first gene
duplication for ancient RB gene happened before the
separation of placozoans and bilaterians. As the placozoans are thought to be diverged before the separation of
cnidarians and bilaterians, the absence of RB1 subgroup
orthologue in sea anemone (N. vectensis) is possibly due
to independent gene loss.
There are two RB family proteins, RBF1-Dm and
RBF2-Dm, in D. melanogaster, and one RB family protein, Lin35, in C. elegans. None of them can be classed
into any subgroup due to their high sequence divergence. As RBF1 and RBF2 are tightly clustered in our
tree, we tend to think that RBF1 and RBF2 were formed
by lineage specific gene duplication. Interestingly, we
found that fly RBF1 gene share an interspecies conserved exon with Human RBL1 and RBL2 genes (Figure
3, additional file 3), this data added the possibility that
RBF1 belong to RBL subgroup. As the evidence is still
limited, we do not class RBF1 into any subgroup in this
study.
According to Figure 4, the second gene duplication
occurred in RB family, but this only happened in RBL
subgroup, not in RB1 subgroup. This gene duplication
in RBL subgroup happened before tetrapoda and teleostei divergence, as H. sapiens and D. rerio possess
representative RBL1 and RBL2 genes respectively.
Human RBL1 and RBL2 gene emerged by gene duplications of the common RBL subgroup ancestor, and
representative RBL subgroup members from invertebrates T. adhaerens, N. vectensis, S. purpuratus,
B. floridae, and C. intestinalis, which we named them
as RBL-Ta, RBL-Nv, RBL-Sp, RBL-Ci, and RBL-Bf,
should be recognized as the co-orthologues of Human
RBL1 and RBL2 genes (Table 2). Gene losses of RB
family might also happen in some vertebrates. For
example, RBL2 orthologue were not found in
T. nigroviridis, and RB1 orthologue was not found in
X. tropicalis.

Figure 3 Conservation of exon intron structures in related genes from human, fly, and worm. The exon and intron structures of related
genes from human, fly, and worm are showed, (A): E2F1-6 family, (C): RB family, and Protein sequences alignments of the region with
interspecies conserved exons are also showed, (B): E2F1-6 family, (D): RB family. Boxes correspond to exons. Non-coding exons are shown in
grey. The interspecies conserved exons are labeled with red color. The size of introns and exons in nucleotides is shown. Introns and non-coding
regions are not drawn to scale. In the alignment, the protein sequences coded by interspecies conserved exons are labeled with blue color, and
amino acid residues overlap splice sits are labeled with red color. The exon intron structures information are got from ensemble data base, detail
of transcripts used for analysis are: E2F4-Hs: ENST00000379378; E2F5-Hs: ENST00000416274; E2F2-Dm: FBtr0081501; EFL1-Ce: Q9XX87_CAEEL
(Y102A5C.18); RBL1-Hs: ENST00000373664; RBL2-Hs: ENST00000262133; RB1-Hs: ENST00000267163; RBF1-Dm: FBtr0070146. The exon intron
structures of all E2F1-6 and RB Family genes from human, fly, and worm can be found in additional file 6.

For DP family (Figure 4, Table 2), all invertebrates
only have one orthologue of DP family. Similar to E2F7/
8 family, gene duplication for DP family happened
before tetrapoda and teleostei divergence. Incidentally, it
was found that species-specific gene duplications for DP
family happened in H. sapiens, M. musculus, and D.
rerio. For example: Human DP3-Hs (gi:189409125)
should be thought as the product of species-specific
gene duplication of human DP1-Hs (gi:6005900).
Repressive E2Fs (E2F4, E2F5) evolved slower than active
E2Fs (E2F1, E2F2, E2F3)

In ML tree, the branch lengths for E2F1/2/3 subgroup
proteins are longer than for E2F4/5 subgroup proteins
in E2F1-6 protein family. This indicated E2F1/2/3 subgroup may evolve more rapidly than E2F4/5 subgroup.

So we did a detailed investigation of evolutionary rates
of two subgroup proteins.
At first, the eukaryotic ancestral E2F sequence was
predicted using the full alignment of E2F sequences of
eukaryotic organisms and its phylogenetic tree by the
software GASP. The ancestral E2F sequence could be
found in additional File 4.
It was found that human E2F4 and E2F5 possess smaller
distance to the predicted ancestral E2F sequence or the
E2F-Mb (gi|167523471) compared with human E2F1, E2F2
and E2F3 (Figure 5A). However this kind of differences is
not significant, as the small substitution rate difference
could be partly masked by mutational saturation in comparisons between distantly related species. So we further
investigated the substitute rate in E2F1/2/3 subgroup and
E2F4/5 subgroup in more closely related organisms.

than E2F1 and E2F3 (E2F1:E2F4, P < 0.001; E2F3:E2F4, P < 0.001). (E) Ka/Ks values for E2F genes based on codon sequences from human and

subgroup and E2F3 subgroup (For E2F1:E2F4, P < 0.001; E2F2:E2F4, P < 0.001; E2F3:E2F4, P < 0.05.). Detail information could be found in

For invertebrates, based on the sequences data from 5
organisms (Ta, Nv, Sp, Ci, and Bf), we found that the
group average pairwise distance among the orthologues
in E2F4/5 subgroup were smaller than that in E2F1/2/3
subgroup (P <0.001, with pair Student’s T Test) (Figure
5B). In vertebrates, the distances between human E2F4,
E2F5 and their orthologues from other vertebrates (G.
gallus; X tropicalis; D. rerio; T. nigroviridis) were smaller
than the distances between human E2F1, E2F2, E2F3
and their orthologues respectively (Figure. 5C). As the
group average pairwise distance comparisons between
different genes general require these genes are derived
from a same collection of organisms, Gene losses for
E2F2 and E2F5 in several vertebrate organisms (Table 1)
make E2F2 and E2F5 was not suitable to compute their
group average pairwise distances and then make a statistical meaningful comparing in our study. For E2F1,
E2F3, and E2F4 gene in vertebrate, the sequences data
from 8 vertebrate organisms (Hs, Mm, Cf, Bt, Rn, Gg,
Xt, Tn) was used for analysis, we found that the average
group pairwise distance of E2F4 gene is smaller than
E2F1 and E2F3 (P < 0.001, with Pair Student’s T Test)
(Figure 5D). In general, we thought the slower evolvement of E2F4/5 subgroup compared with E2F1/2/3 subgroup was conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates,
Finally, the selection pressures on human E2F proteins
were examined by estimating the average ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks) at each
codon position. The codoning sequences alignments for
E2F family proteins, and detail the Ka/ks data could be
found in additional file 5 and additional file 6. We
found that E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 have severely reduced
selection in comparison with E2F4 and E2F5 in cordon
sequence comparison between human and mouse (Figure 5E). In four mammals (Bt, Hs, Mm, and Cf), we also
found that the group average Ka/Ks values for E2F4 was
smaller than the group average Ka/Ks values E2F1,
E2F2, or E2F3 with statistical support (P < 0.05, with
pair Student’s T Test) (Figure 5F). As E2F5 was absent
in Bt and Rn, E2F5 was not covered in group average
Ka/Ks value study.
RBL subgroup proteins evolved slower than RB1
subgroup proteins in vertebrates

For RB family proteins, eukaryote ancestral RB sequence
was predicted using the full alignments of all 39 RB like
protein sequences of eukaryotic organisms and its phylogenetic tree by the software GASP. The ancestral E2F
sequence could be found in additional File 3. However,
differences in the distance between three human RB
family proteins and the ancestral RB sequence or RBMb (gi:167523296) were small (Figure 6A).
In vertebrates, pairwise distances between human RB1,
RBL1, RBL2 and their orthologues in G. gallus,

Page 12 of 21

X. tropicalis, D. rario, T. nigroviridis were calculated. It
was found that RB1 homologue evolved more rapidly
compared with RBL1 homologue and RBL2 homologue
(Figure 6B). Based on the sequence data from 6 organisms (Hs, Mm, Cf, Bt, Rn, Gg, and Dr), We find that the
group average pairwise distance of RB1 gene was bigger
than the group average pairwise distances of RBL1 gene
or RBL2 gene (P <0.001, Pair T Test) (Figure 6C).
To check the selection pressure, we first investigated
Ka/Ks values by sequences comparisons between human
and other mammals (Figure 6D). The codoning
sequences alignments for RB family proteins, and detail
the Ka/ks data could be found in additional file 5 and
additional file 6. In 5 mammals (Bt, Hs, Mm, Rn, and
Cf), the average Ka/ks for RB1, RBL1, and RBl2 genes
were also investigated (Figure 6E). In general, RB1 gene
has higher Ka/Ks ratios in comparison with RBL1 and
RBL2 genes in mammals (P < 0.01, pair T Test). Thus
RB1 gene owns decreased selection pressure compared
with RBL1 and RBL2.

Discussion
Origination of the RB-E2F pathway and its possible
contribution for multicellular organisms emerging

In our analysis, it was found that E2F1-6 family, RB
family and DP family proteins are present in protist D.
discoideum, green agar O. tauri, choanoflagellate M. brevicollis. This suggested that E2F and RB proteins were
present in early ancestor of eukaryotes, and RB-E2F
pathway originated in ancestor of eukaryotes before animal, plant and protist separation. One interesting finding in our study was that all multicellular organisms we
checked owned orthologues from E2F1-6 family, RB
family, and DP family, which indicated that the RB-E2F
pathway is strongly conserved in multicellular
organisms.
The emergence of multicellular organisms from single-celled ancestors marks one of the most pivotal
events in life’s history, which occurred several times,
independently in different branches of the eukaryotic
tree [30,31]. It was usually thought genes involved in
cell-cell communication, cell adhesion and cell differentiation probably arose before, or concomitant with, the
origins of multicellularity [30,31]. Given that RB-E2F
pathway was found in all multicellular organisms we
checked, we speculated this RB-E2F pathway might contribute to multicellular emergence. At least the core
function of RB-E2F pathway (discussed in later) is consistent with this speculation. It was known that some
cells may continue to proliferate and some cells may differentiate and give out its previous proliferate ability
during the transition from unicellular organism to multicellular organism. The cycle controlling and/or differentiation function of RB-E2F clearly could contribute to

deviation values are showed as error bars. (D) Ka/Ks values for RB family genes deduced from sequences comparisons between human and

RBL2:RB1, P < 0.01), Detail information could be found in additional file 5 and additional file 6. Abbreviations used: Hs, H. sapiens; Mm, M.

this progress. In fact, it was found that the expression of
retinoblastoma orthologue was increased about 200
times when D. discoideum transited from unicellular to
multicellular form [32]. By the way, beside E2F and RB
proteins, some cycle regulatory components such as the
KIP/WAF-type CDK inhibitor, Cyclin D, BRCA1 and
BRCA2 are only found in plants and animals to the
exclusion of the yeast [33].
The ancient function of RB-E2F pathway: insights from its
evolutionary history

In this study, we mapped the evolutionary history of E2F
and RB proteins. We summarized the evolutionary history of E2F1-6, RB, DP, and E2F7/8 family by listing
their gene duplication events (Figure 7A). Ancestral E2F,
RB genes duplicated before placozoans and bilaterians
diverged, thus E2F family was divided into E2F4/5 subgroup and E2F1/2/3 subgroup, RB family was divided
into RB1 subgroup and RBL subgroup (Figure 7A, Table
2). In vertebrates, the genes number in E2F1-6, RB, DP
and E2F7/8 families increased by genes duplication
events, these duplications occurred no later than tetrapoda and teleostei divergence (Figure 7A, Table 1, and
Table 2). In general, we thought that the complexity
increase of RB-E2F pathway is compatible with the
increasing functional complexity in evolutionary history.
As mentioned in the results section, the fly dE2F1 was
classed into E2F1/2/3 subgroup, and fly dE2F2 and
worm EFL-1 was classed into E2F4/5 subgroup. This
classification was consistent with results of previous
functional studies [2]. As similar to repressive E2Fs
(E2F4/5 subgroup), fly dE2F2 can form stable repressor
complexes in conjunction with RBF1 and RBF2 [34],
worm EFL-1 was also reported to form a stable repressor complex which represses the expression of many
genes together with Lin35 [35]. And similar to active
EFs, dE2F1 reverses the effects of dE2F2 repressor complexes [36]. As to fly RBF1, RBF2, and worm LIN35, as
all of them have similar evolutionary distance to RB1
subgroup and RBL subgroup proteins, we do not classify
them into any subgroup (Figure.7A).
One intriguing finding in our study was that E2F4/5
subgroup protein share more sequence similarity with
the predicted E2F ancestral sequence than E2F1/2/3
subgroup proteins; E2F4/5 subgroup proteins evolved
slower and own increased negative selection pressure
than E2F1/2/3 subgroup. For RB family proteins, RBL
subgroup proteins possess increased negative selection
pressure compared with RB1 subgroup in mammals.
Protein evolutionary rates usually linked with protein
function [37,38]. The rate of evolution of a protein-coding gene depends primarily on the structural-functional
constraints that are intrinsic to the encoded protein
[37,38]. As to duplication genes, in neofunctionalization

Page 14 of 21

model, it was thought that original copy gene maintain
its ancestral function and keep the previous evolutionary
rate, the new copy if not pseudogenized or lost, may
acquire a new gene function. During this process of
acquiring a new gene function, the new copy gene
evolved faster than the original copy gene [39,40]. Thus,
based on significantly different evolutionary rates within
E2F family, we speculated that E2F4/5 subgroup proteins might mainly maintain the ancestral E2F function.
And for RB family, RBL1 and RBL2 gene was under
more strictly purification selection in mammals, we also
speculated the ancestral RB family function might also
mainly be represented by RBL subgroup proteins.
For RB-E2F pathway, it is general known that E2F1,
E2F2 and E2F3 are active E2Fs and E2F4 and E2F5 are
repressive E2Fs. RB family proteins are thought to function in cell cycle and cell differentiation. Though RB
family might share similar functions, different RB family
members might also function differently [2], only RB1
protein, but not RBL1 and RBL2, could interact to active
E2Fs (E2F-1, E2F-2 and E2F-3); RBL1 and RBL2 can
only interact to repressive E2Fs (E2F4 and E2F5) which
is much more abundant and functional in G0-arrested
cells than other E2F factors [2,41]. Interestingly, In C.
elegans, there is only one RB family protein Lin-35, Lin
35 is somewhat more closely related to human RBL2
and RBL1 (Lin-35 shares 20, 19, and 15% overall aminoacid identity with RBL2, RBL1, and RB1, respectively)
[42], previous studies did not reveal a cell-cycle role for
Lin35, Lin35 is not rate limiting for S-phase entry [43].
In dictyostelium, the RB family orthologue also reported
not function in cell cycle [32]. In Arabidopsis, local
reduction of expression of the retinoblastoma-related
(RBR) gene (homologue of human RB family) in roots
increases the amount of stem cells without affecting cell
cycle [44]. We speculated the ancient function of RB
family was mainly related to cell differentiation, but not
tightly related to cell cycle.
Functional studies in RB-E2F pathway also indicated
that the function conducted by E2F4/5 subgroup and
RBL subgroup proteins is extremely conserved. A key
finding about RB-E2F pathway came with the biochemical purification of native E2F-RBF complexes from D.
melanogaster embryo extracts (dREAM [45] and MybMuvB (MMB) [46]), and the repressive dE2F2, RBF1
and RBF2 are members of these complexes. Similar
complexes were subsequently purified from C. elegans
(DRM [47]), which contain Lin35 and EFL-1. For mammals, similar complex was also found (DREAM [48,49]
and lINC [50]). These complexes contain the repressive
E2F protein E2F4 or E2F5, and RBL subgroup protein
RBlL1 or RBL2. Human DREAM was found to bind to
more than 800 human promoters in G0 and was
required for repression of E2F target genes [49]. As to

the E2F1/2/3 subgroup and RB1 subgroup members, no
similar conserved protein complex was found till now.
Taken all together, it was temptation to think that the
function conducted by E2F4/5 subgroup and RBL subgroup might be more conserved than those function
conducted by E2F1/2/3 subgroup and RB1 subgroup.

Conclusions
The most important cell fate decisions, such as whether
to divide, differentiate or die, usually are very strictly
regulated. The RB-E2F pathway plays critical roles on
these fundamental cellular processes. We carried out
comprehensive evolutionary analyses for RB and E2F
family, our data demonstrated that E2F4 and E2F5 share
more sequence similarity with the predicted E2F ancestral sequence than E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3; E2F4 and
E2F5 also possess significantly lower evolutionary rates
and higher negative selection pressures than E2F1, E2F2
and E2F3. For RB family, the RBL subgroup proteins
evolved slower and also possess higher purification
selection pressures compared with RB1 subgroup proteins. We speculated that that ancient function of RBE2F pathway might mainly link with repressive E2F and
RBL subgroup proteins. And the active E2F and RB1
subgroup proteins might contribute more to functional
diversification in RB-E2F pathway. Our results will
enhance the current understanding of RB-E2F pathway
and will also be useful to further functional studies in
human and other model organisms.
Reviewer’s report 1
Pierre Pontarotti (UMR 6632 Université de Aix Marseille/
CNRS. Equipe Evolution biologique et Modélisation
France)

This article describes the phylogenetic analysis of three
gene families involved in the same pathway. The robustness of the phylogenetic analysis is proper, however I disagree with the title of the article that do not reflect exactly
the work carried out. Indeed the authors performed only a
classification. However I think that this classification of
protein families is helpful for the scientific community and
thus I recommend the paper to be published.
Author’s response: As the article also discussed much
about the ancient function of RB-E2F pathway, we still
kept the title “The ancient function of RB-E2F Pathway:
insights from its evolutionary history”
General remark

The paper is difficult to understand and should be clarified, in particular the fact that some duplications are
lineage-specific and other are older. The authors should
use terms such as in paralog or co-orthologs to make
the information clearer. I think that the paper should be
reworked and the concept and result clarified. I wonder
also if the authors should propose a new nomenclature,

Page 16 of 21

take as example this article: “Nme protein family evolutionary history, a vertebrate perspective by Desvignes et
al 2009”. This will clarify the issue.
Author’s response: We agree that it is a little difficult
to understand for some evolutionary relationship in
E2F1-6 family and RB family, as there were ancient gene
duplications and lineage-specific gene duplications in
E2F1-6 family and RB family. We use the term co-orthologues to describe some evolutionary relationships in the
revision, for example, E2F4/5 subgroup members from
invertebrates T adhaerens, E2F4/5-Ta, should be recognized as the co-orthologues of vertebrate E2F4 and E2F5
gene. We added two tables, similar to the article: “Nme
protein family evolutionary history, a vertebrate perspective by Desvignes et al 2009” [51].
In several instances, the phylogeny based only on
bases substitution could not be informative, therefore
other characters should be taken into an account, for
example exon intron organization (see for example page
10, third paragraph).
Author’s response: E2F and RB family protein
sequences from fly and worm usually diverged highly
and could not be clustered into subgroup in phylogenetic
analysis based on protein sequences. As the reviewer’s
suggestion, The Exon intron structure of E2F1-6 family,
RB family genes from fly, worm, and human were studied in this revision (figure 3, additional file 3). We
found that E2F2-Dm, E2FL1-Ce, E2F4-hs, and E2F5-hs
gene share some Exon intron structure similarity, which
support our speculation that E2F2-Dm and E2FL1-ce
gene should be classified into E2F4/5 subgroup. However,
For E2F1-Dm gene, no Exon intron structure similarity
with human E2F1/2/3 subgroup or E2F4/5 subgroup
genes were found. For RB family, we found that fly RBF1
gene share an interspecies conserved exon with Human
RBL1 and RBL2 genes (Figure 3), these data added the
possibility that RBF1 belong to RBL subgroup. As the evidence is still limited, we do not class RBF1 into any subgroup in this study.
My major problem concerned the figure 6 in which
the author indicate that for example that B Floridae is
the vertebrate ancestor. The entire lineage evolved,
some show, of course, more apomorphism or plesiomorphism than other, However none of the present day
specie is the ancestor of another present day specie.
Author’s response: We corrected these problems in
Figure 6 (Now is Figure 7).
The sentence page 11: “during the transition from
invertebrate to vertebrate” is also misleading. The
authors should write a second gene duplication occurred
in the RB family in the vertebrate lineage after their
separation with the amphioxus ancestor.
Author’s response: We corrected these problems. We
changed it to “The second gene duplication occurred in

Cao et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:55
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/55

RB family, but this only happened in RBL subgroup, not
in RB1 subgroup. This gene duplication in RBL subgroup
happened before tetrapoda and teleostei divergence, as
H. sapiens and D. rerio possess representative RBL1 and
RBL2 genes respectively”
Other comments

Lot of misspellings are present in this report. This start
with the first line of the paper where the word background is misspelled. In general vocabulary and grammar should be checked by a native English speaker.
Please ask to a native Anglophone to review the article
All the phylogenetic trees presented in the figures show
problems with the species branching For example; figure 1 E2F1 of Xenopus and Tetraodon form a monophylogenetic group; instead Xenopus should branch with
Gallus and mammalian. Moreover, the authors have to
check all the phylogenetic incongruence and comment
them.
Author’s response: We corrected several misspellings
which have been mentioned by three reviewers and also
asked one native English speaker to review this article.
We corrected the mistake about “Xenopus and Tetraodon form a monophylogenetic group”.
The phylogenetic incongruences sometimes are due to
protein sequence highly diverged in some organisms (such
as in S. purpuratus; C. intestinalis; C. elegans; and D.
melanogaster). We added some comments for these phylogenetic incongruences in the revision. For example,
According to Dr. Arcady Mushegian’s suggestion, we
added the protein sequences from the placozoan T.
adhaerens in our analysis. T. adhaerens is a basal eumetazoan lineage that diverged before the separation of cnidarians and bilaterians. As T adhaerens owns
representative members for RB1 subgroup and RBL subgroup. And N. vectensis possess representative member in
RBL1 subgroup, but no member in RB1 subgroup. Based
on the data in T. adhaerens, we speculated that this
absence of orthologue of RB1 subgroup in N. vectensis is
due to independent gene loss.

Reviewer’s report 2
Dr. Arcady Mushegian (Stowers Institute, Kansas City,
United States)

p.3 “Proteins that are related to the retinoblastoma
tumor suppressor RB and the E2F transcription factor...
have been missing from yeasts and other fungi” – this is
incorrect. Orthologs of retinoblastoma may be missing
from the fungi, but “proteins related” to retinoblastoma
are certainly there, i.e., any protein that contains a
BRCT domain.
Author’s response: We corrected this mistake, and we
mentioned that some fungi possess orthologues of E2F1-6
family and DP family, but no orthologue of RB family in
the introduction.

Page 17 of 21

p.5 E-value less than e-5 was used to collect the
homologs. At a more common default value of e-3, have
there been more matches, especially in the species that
the authors say lacked any homologs (e.g., fungi)?
Author’s response: As reviewer’s suggestion, using
human E2F4, E2F7, DP1, RB1 proteins, we performed
Blast searchings, with E-value less than e-3 as cut-off, in
NCBI data base. We got the same results in the organisms we checked. For Fungi, I will answer it below.
The authors do not mention Trichoplax adhaerens at
all. This is a shortcoming: even if Placozoa are not the
most primitive metazoan animal, it is still primitive
clade, perhaps close to the split of cnidaria and bilateria.
All hypotheses about what happened before or after the
latter split may gain additional evidence if this species is
included (genes are not very well annotated in Trichoplax, so some prediction by homology may be needed).
Author’s response: Thanks for the good suggestion. We
found Trichoplax adhaerens own two orthologues of
E2F1-6 family, and two orthologues of RB family, and
one orthologue of DP family. T. adhaerens are thought to
be diverged before the separation of cnidarians and bilaterians [12]. E2F and RB family proteins from T. adhaerens are now covered in analysis in the revision.
I would be happier if multiple fungi with complex
morphology were included in the analysis, not only
yeasts with what we know to be abbreviated genomes.
Author’s response: We did the Blast searching, with
human E2F4, E2F7, RB1, and DP as queries, in fungi
(taxid:4751) in NCBI database. In addition, domain
associations of all possible proteins were checked in
SMART and pfam database. In total, we found six proteins which belong to E2F1-6 family or DP family in
fungi. Below is the detail: Nosema ceranae BRL01 owns
one E2F1-6 family protein (gi:239605701), one DP family
protein (gi:239605391); Enterocytozoon bieneusi H348
owns one E2F1-6 family protein gi|169806750), one DP
family protein (gi|169806250); Encephalitozoon cuniculi
GB-M1 owns one E2F1-6 family protein gi|19074054),
and one DP family protein (gi|19074276), However, No
RB family protein was found in fungi. N. ceranae, E.
bieneusi, and E. cuniculi belong to the phylum Microsporidia, The microsporidia constitute a phylum of
spore-forming unicellular parasites. They were once
thought to be protists but are now known to be fungi
[10].
As our main interest is on RB-E2F protein evolution in
metazoa, and no RB family protein was found in fungi,
we did not cover these fungi E2F and DP protein in
detail analysis this time. However, we mentioned the
E2F1-6 family, and DP family proteins from E. cuniculi
in the introduction in this revision.
p.10, par.3 replace “homologue” with “orthologoue”
twice? All E2F family members are homologs by

Cao et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:55

definition. Similarly elsewhere in the manuscript, for
example the fourth paragraph on the same page.
Author’s response: we correct them and similar problems in elsewhere in the manuscript
p.16-17: “based on the significantly evolutionary rate
differences [should be: significantly different evolutionary rates] within E2F family and RB family, we speculated that E2F4/5 subgroup proteins might mainly
maintain the ancestral E2F function. And for RB family,
the ancestral RB family 17 function might also mainly
represent by RBL subgroup proteins.” – What those
ancestral functions might be, as opposed to derived
functions of the other family members? This is answered
very briefly in penultimate paragraph on p. 17, but
needs to be elaborated.
Author’s response: we change to “significantly different
evolutionary rates” as reviewer suggested, We add one
paragraph which was tried to describe about function
difference between RB1 subgroup and RBL subgroup, and
speculated that ancient function of RB family might be
linked with cell differentiation but not with cell cycle
controlling.

Reviewer’s report 3
Dr. Zhenguo Lin, Department of Ecology and Evolution,
The University of Chicago (nominated by Dr. Neil
Smalheiser)

The RB-E2F pathway is involved in several fundamental
processes of cellular activities, including regulating the
initiation of DNA replication. Disruption of the RB-E2F
pathway has been shown to be associated with all
human tumors. Therefore, it is of great interest to study
the origin and evolution of this pathway. The authors
reconstructed the evolutionary histories for the three
gene families (E2F, RB and DP) in this pathway. They
also found that different members in each of the RB and
E2F family might have experienced different selection
constraints. This study provides some new understandings about this important pathway.
Major comments

One of the major conclusions of this study is that
“E2F4/5 genes have “significantly lower evolutionary
rates” than E2F1/2/3, and RBL1/2 “also evolved slightly
slower compared with RB1 in vertebrates”. These conclusions are based on comparing values of protein divergence data or Ka/Ks. I do not know what criteria were
used to determine if the evolutionary rate is “significantly lower” or “slightly slower”. For example, the
authors also used “this kind of differences is not big,”
“no big difference was found in the distance” in Page 13.
Without any appropriate statistical inference, such
claims seem to be invalid. In addition, the authors only
compared human with other species to obtain protein
distances and Ka/Ks. I would suggest authors to

Page 18 of 21

calculate all pairwise distance values for all protein
sequences in each subgroup, and perform a statistical
evaluation to determine if two subgroups evolve under
significant different rates.
Author’s response: As the reviewer’s suggestion, we did
group average pairwise distance value comparisons, and
group average Ka/ks value comparisons, and perform
statistical evaluations.
For group average pairwise distance values comparisons, all pairwise distance values for all protein
sequences in each subgroup was first computed. Then
average value of group pairwise distances was calculated.
For group average Ka/ks values comparing, all Ka/ks
values for all protein-coding DNA sequences in each subgroup was first computed. Pair Student’s T Test was
used for statistical analysis. Considering the effect of gene
losses, we thought that the group average pairwise distances comparing between different genes general require
these genes are derived from a same collection of organisms. For E2F1-6 family, we did group average pairwise
distances comp comparison invertebrates, (Figure 5B),
and in vertebrate (Figure 5D), For RB family, we did
group average pairwise distances comp comparison in
vertebrate (Figure 6C), For group average Ka/ks values
comparison, we did them in E2F1-6 family (Figure 5F),
and in RB family (Figure 6E). In the new additional file
6, all the data about group average distances and group
average ka/ks values could be found.
In general, the E2F4/5 subgroup evolved significantly
slower than E2F1/2/3 subgroup(P < 0.001, with pair T
Test), For RB family, RBL subgroup proteins evolved
slower than RB1 subgroup proteins in vertebrates (P <
0.01, with Pair T Test)
The basal groups on the tree of E2F1-6 subfamily in
Fig 2A and Fig S3A are poorly resolved, therefore the
evolutionary relationships between the Monosiga brevicollis E2F genes with other E2F member remains
unclear. Under this condition, MbE2F gene could be a
member of either E2F1/2/3 group or E2F4/5 groups. So,
I am not sure if it is appropriate to use MbE2F as the
outgroup to infer that E2F1/2/3 group or E2F4/5
groups.
Author’s response: One reason for our using Monosiga
brevicollis E2F as the outgroup of Metazan E2F1-6
family was that M. brevicollis is the close relative of
metazoa, And we had tried many times, but we still
failed to classified M. brevicollis E2F genes into either
E2F1/2/3 group or E2F4/5 groups. When the E2F protiens from D. discoideum or plant were used as outgroups, the topology of E2F1/2/3 group or E2F4/5 groups
in metazoa do not change comparing with E2F from M.
brevicollis was used as the outgroup.
E2F1/2/3-Nv (gi:156371340) sequence is much shorter
than other E2F proteins, it contains only the N-terminal

Cao et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:55
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/55

domains and it is about ½ length of its orthologous
genes. The prediction of its CDS is probably incorrect. I
would suggest the authors to do TBLASTN against its
genomic sequence to obtain its complete sequence.
Otherwise, it is not a good idea to include partial
sequence in the alignment for tree building. In addition,
E2F3-Rn has the same problem. The authors need to
carefully inspect the alignments to detect obscure
sequences. Better trees are needed for better supports of
their conclusions.
Author’s response: We tried to do TBLASTN against
its genomic sequence using the E2F1/2/3-Ta
(gi:196010483) which is most similar to E2F1/2/3-Nv
(gi:156371340) in our analysis, But still good result. As
E2F1/2/3(gi:156371340) sequence contained the E2FTDP domain, and still be good cluster into E2F1/2/3
subgroup, so We kept it in analysis, For E2F3-Rn, We
rechecked it sequences in genbank and in ensembl data
base, In ensembl database, Rat E2F3 gene, LOC691420
(ENSRNOT00000050261), also only coded 245 AA.
When we did two sequence blast for mRNA sequences of
Human E2F3 (GI:16848011) and Rat E2F3
(GI:212549626), We found that a reading frame shift for
Rat E2F3 which induced rat E2F3 protein sequence had
been unexpected stopped in comparison with human
E2F3 mRNA.. In detail: the sequence at the position
1231-1254 of human E2F3 mRNA (GI:168480112) is
“CAA-GAT-ATT-CGA-AAA-ATT-AGT-GGC”,
the
sequence at the position 1045-1068 of Rat E2F3 mRNA
(GI:212549626) is “TCA-AGA-TAT-TCG-AAA-AATTAG-TGG”.
Minor comments

Page 5. “in additional” should be “in addition”, or
“additionally”.
Author’s response: we corrected it.
Page 8. First line” We found that all three unicellular
organisms, D. discoideum AX4, O. tauri, and M.brevicollis contain”. In fact, S. pombe and S. cerevisiae are also
unicellular organisms.
Author’s response: The fact is that some unicellular
organisms owns E2F, RB family protein, and some unicellular organisms (S. pombe and S. cerevisiae) not. We
removed the word “all”.
Page 8. Last line of first paragraph. “E2F7/8 family was
not as indispensable as E2F1-6, RB, and DP family” if it
is not your conclusion, reference is needed.
Author’s response: it is our conclusion.
Page 9, Second paragraph “did not function in classical RB-E2F pathway” any reference?
Author’s response: we added the reference.
Page 10, third paragraph “And this classification was
also consistent with results of previous functional studies.” any reference?
Author’s response: we added the reference.

Page 10, third paragraph “its sequence highly
diverged” should be “its sequence IS highly diverged”.
Author’s response: we corrected it.
Page 11. “RBF1 and RBF2 are formed by lineage specific gene duplication, and this gene duplication may not
happen very early” Only one arthropod species (fruit fly)
was used in this study, I agree that RBF1 and RBF2 are
formed by lineage specific gene duplication, but I am
not sure about “not happen very early”. The two
branches seem to be long; the duplication could happen
as early as before divergence of arthropods. Therefore,
without including more arthropod species, this conclusion seems to be under question.
Author’s response: we corrected it, and removed “ and
this gene duplication may not happen very early”
Page 14 “partly” should be “partially”
Author’s response: we corrected it.
