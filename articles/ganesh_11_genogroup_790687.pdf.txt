Abstract
Picobirnaviruses (PBV) are small, non-enveloped viruses with a bisegmented double-stranded RNA genome. In this
study a PBV strain, PBV/Horse/India/BG-Eq-3/2010, was identified in the faeces of a 10 month old weaned female
foal with diarrhoea in January 2010 from Kolkata, India. Surprisingly, sequence comparison and phylogenetic
analysis of a short stretch of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed close genetic relatedness (> 98%
nucleotide identity) to a human genogroup I PBV strain (Hu/GPBV1) detected earlier from the same part of India.
Our observations together with earlier findings on genetic relatedness between human and animal PBV warrant
further studies on zoonotic potential.
Introduction, Methods and Results
Picobirnaviruses (PBV) are small, non-enveloped viruses,
with a bisegmented dsRNA genome. PBV exists as either
a large genome profile (2.3 to 2.6 kbp and 1.5 to 1.9 kbp
for the segments 1 and 2, respectively) [1-3] or small genome profile (1.75 kbp and 1.55 kbp for the segments 1
and 2, respectively) [4,5]. The PBV capsid protein has two
main domains and forms a simple, spherical 33-41 nm
virion [6].
The genomic segment 1 of the prototype PBV strain,
Hy005102 was found to encode two open reading
frames (ORF1 and ORF2) [7]; ORF1 codes for a hydrophilic group of 224 amino acids of unknown function.
ORF2 has 552 amino acids that encode the capsid protein. The smaller segment 2 has a single ORF of 534
amino acids encoding the viral RNA dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp). Recently, additional sequence information of full or nearly full genome segments has been
made available in the public DNA databases for other
human strains [8,9] as well as a lapin [10] and a bovine
PBV strain [11].

Historically, PBV were first detected in the faecal specimens of humans and free-living rats (Oryzomys
nigripes) in 1988 from Brazil [1,12]. Thereafter, PBV
were detected in human faeces [7-9,13-16] and in a
wide range of animal species worldwide. Farm mammals
such as pigs, calves, foals, lambs, avians such as chickens, free-living mammals, companion and zoo animals, a
variety of wild birds and even snakes have been found
to shed PBV with or without diarrhoea [10,11,17-26].
The lack of a consistent pattern in PBV detection concomitantly in healthy [27] and diarrhoeic individuals
and animal species raises questions regarding the pathogenic potential of PBV, albeit they have been often
implicated in opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients [28-30].
The detection of the bisegmented dsRNA genome of
PBV by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and
silver staining [31], is one of the standard and reliable
laboratory diagnoses. Broadly reactive primer pairs for
RT-PCR [8] have served as an alternative to PAGE, for
molecular detection and characterisation of PBV. These
RT-PCR primers specifically amplify small fragments
within the RdRp gene, and are also capable of differentiating 2 major PBV genogroups, genogroup I and genogroup II. These primer sets were utilised in the present
study, where we report the detection and molecular

characterisation of an equine picobirnavirus detected in
a diarrhoeic foal. Further characterisation by sequencing
and phylogenetic analyses revealed that this equine PBV
strain belongs to genogroup I and clusters with an
Indian human and some Hungarian porcine PBV strains.
Seven faecal specimens were collected from adult
domestic horses and foals (Equus ferus caballus) with or
without diarrhoea from Kolkata, India during January
2010 as part of an ongoing study on picobirnavirus
infections (Table 1): two from foals, two from colts, and
one each from a filly, a mare and a stallion. The age of
hosts ranged from 9 to 72 months.
From 10% fecal suspensions, total RNA was extracted
for PAGE and silver staining [14,31]. Subsequently, the
viral RNA was amplified using the primers and algorithms described previously [8,14]. The amplicons were
purified and sequenced in both directions. The algorithm of nucleotide sequence editing and phylogenetic
analysis was done as previously described [14,15]. The
nucleotide sequence of the foal PBV strain, PBV/Horse/
India/BG-Eq-3/2010, was deposited in the DNA database (accession no. DDBJ: AB598401).
Screening of faecal RNA extracts by PAGE gave negative results. (Similarly, RT-PCR assay using the primers
[32] targeting the rotavirus VP4 and VP7 genes failed to
detect the group A rotavirus). However, a single faecal
specimen obtained from a 10 month old weaned female
foal was found to be positive for genogroup I PBV by
RT-PCR using the genogroup specific primer pairs [8].
Sequence analysis of the amplicon indicated the presence of genogroup I PBV strain. This PBV strain, PBV/
Horse/India/BG-Eq-3/2010, shared 70% nt and 66% aa
identity with the prototype genogroup I PBV strain, 1CHN-97 and only about 24% aa similarity to the prototype genogroup II PBV strain, 4-GA-91.
The nucleotide identities along a 170 bp stretch and
the partial length deduced amino acid identity (given in
parentheses) of gene segment 2 (stretch of 56 amino
acids) between the equine genogroup I PBV strain (PBV/
Horse/India/BG-Eq-3/2010) detected in Kolkata, India
and the related human and porcine PBV strains were

compared (Additional file 1: Table S1). In general, similarity values fell in the same range as described for other
genogroup I PBV strains in some recent studies [15]
except for a single Indian (Kolkata) human PBV strain
GPBV1 [15] (98% nt identity) and a few Hungarian porcine PBV strains [3] Po/D4/C-5/Hun; Po/D4/C-1/Hun;
Po/D6/C-19/Hun; and Po/C6/C-17/Hun (75-87% nt
identity). In addition, the deduced stretch of 56 amino
acids of our equine PBV strain and the majority of genogroup I PBV strains showed that 16 amino acids were
conserved (Additional file 2: Table S2).
The “proline” in aa position 13 (the position in the
alignment used for comparison) is conserved in all the
PBV strains analysed to date, whereas another proline
residue in aa position 25 was conserved in all other species except in bovine PBV strain Bo/RUBV-P. Similarly,
the “methionine” in aa position 30 was conserved in all
but two PBV strains: the human strain VS-22 identified
from the Netherlands and the bovine strain RUBV-P
from India.
Subsequently, the phylogenetic tree was constructed
with a cognate stretch of hitherto reported human, porcine, bovine, canine, murine and serpentine genogroup I
PBV strains (Figure 1) based on partial amino acid
sequence (56 amino acids) of genomic segment 2. This
analysis revealed that the PBV/Horse/India/BG-Eq-3/
2010 strain showed very close evolutionary relatedness
to the Indian (Kolkata) human PBV strain GPBV1 [15]
(100% aa identity) and a few Hungarian porcine PBV
strains [17] Po/D4/C-5/Hun; Po/D4/C-1/Hun; Po/D6/C19/Hun; and Po/C6/C-17/Hun (77-84% aa identity).

Discussion
PBV in horses has been reported earlier [18], however
this is the first description of an equine PBV strain at
the molecular level. Since, the number of samples taken
for this study was very small, this proportion cannot be
taken as an indication of prevalence or incidence of
PBV infection or disease association in domestic horses
in Kolkata, India. The length of the gene fragment used
for characterisation of PBV strains was relatively short,

thus conclusions on the evolutionary relationships
between any two PBV may have limitations.
In addition, PBV have 2 genome segments and there is
a theoretic possibility that genome segment reassortment may permit a large variety of the RdRp and capsid
gene combinations to rise. Despite these shortcomings,
this is the first study that provides evidence for genetic
relationship between human and equine PBV strains.
One alternative to explain the close genetic relationship between these heterologous strains is the common
exposure to PBV infection. PBV are commonly detected
in communal sewage and surface waters [33], thus consumption of water contaminated with PBV may provide
one way to acquire PBV by different host species.
Another possible explanation is that one host may serve
as source of infection for PBV to be transmitted to the
other host. Whether horses or humans are the primary
hosts for the particular strain that was found in this
study and in another study [15] remains to be carefully
investigated. Nonetheless, genogroup I PBV detected in
pigs in parts of Europe [17] and Latin America [20]
were closely related to human genogroup I PBV, suggesting the zoonotic potential of PBV strains.
Partial molecular characterisation and sequence analysis of human and animal PBV strains have shown that
distinct sequence heterogeneity exists among PBV,
implicating the importance of continued surveillance for
newly emerging variants. Full genome analyses of the
strains identified in the future may reveal the evolutionary mechanisms of PBV, pointing out the role of genetic
drift and reassortment on the overall genomic architecture and to the possible traits implicated in the host
range.
