Abstract
Background: The parvulin-type peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase Par14 is highly conserved in all
metazoans. The recently identified parvulin Par17 contains an additional N-terminal domain whose
occurrence and function was the focus of the present study.
Results: Based on the observation that the human genome encodes Par17, but bovine and rodent
genomes do not, Par17 exon sequences from 10 different primate species were cloned and
sequenced. Par17 is encoded in the genomes of Hominidae species including humans, but is absent
from other mammalian species. In contrast to Par14, endogenous Par17 was found in mitochondrial
and membrane fractions of human cell lysates. Fluorescence of EGFP fusions of Par17, but not
Par14, co-localized with mitochondrial staining. Par14 and Par17 associated with isolated human,
rat and yeast mitochondria at low salt concentrations, but only the Par17 mitochondrial association
was resistant to higher salt concentrations. Par17 was imported into mitochondria in a time and
membrane potential-dependent manner, where it reached the mitochondrial matrix. Moreover,
Par17 was shown to bind to double-stranded DNA under physiological salt conditions.
Conclusion: Taken together, the DNA binding parvulin Par17 is targeted to the mitochondrial
matrix by the most recently evolved mitochondrial prepeptide known to date, thus adding a novel
protein constituent to the mitochondrial proteome of Hominidae.

Background
Peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases, EC 5.2.1.8)
play a role in protein folding and function by twisting the
backbone of target proteins. PPIases are abundantly

expressed in virtually all organisms and all cellular compartments [1-3]. One subclass of PPIases are parvulins, a
group of enzymes involved in mitotic regulatory mechanisms and cell proliferation [4-8]. The human genome

contains two parvulin genes. One encodes the well studied mitotic regulator Pin1, which isomerizes phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs [9] and thereby is involved in a
variety of cellular processes and conditions such as cell
cycle regulation, cancer and Alzheimer's disease [10]; the
other, the Par14/PIN4 locus on chromosome Xq13.1,
gives rise to two protein species, Par14 and Par17 [8].
Par14 (also known as PIN4/EPVH/hPar14) [11,12] is
assumed to be involved in cell cycle progression or chromatin remodeling [13-15]. Par14-like protein sequences
are found in all multicellular organisms but are absent
from yeasts [2]. Although Par14 cannot rescue the lethal
phenotype of Ess1 deletion, which is the only parvulintype PPIase in yeast [16], Uchida and co-workers proposed a compensating function for Par14 upon Pin1 inhibition or deletion in mammalian cells [7]. Par14 displays
only very weak PPIase activity towards peptidic substrates
[12] and hence might also perform cellular regulatory
functions other than Pin1. The Par14 protein was initially
detected within the nucleus, cytosol and mitochondria of
human HEK 293 cells [11], but how this distribution was
accomplished remained to be determined. Its distribution
between the nucleus and cytosol [13,15,17] was described
to be regulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner
[13] and deletion studies pointed to a nuclear import signal within the positively charged N-terminal section [15].
Within the nucleus, Par14 was reported to bind to preribosomal ribonucleoprotein particles [17], and
sequence-specifically to bent double-stranded DNA [15].
The basic N-terminal part was indispensable for high
affinity DNA binding [15]. Such bent AT-rich segments of
DNA are supposed to dictate nucleosome positioning [18]
and play a role in transcription initiation.
Par17 is a recently described protein species [8] also
encoded by the Par14/PIN4 locus on chromosome
Xq13.1. Its elongated mRNA originates from alternative
transcription initiation and occurs in all human tissues
tested so far [8]. The 5'extension includes a 75 bp
extended open reading frame whose expression was confirmed by in vitro translation reaction and by Western
blotting of human HeLa and HepG2 cell lysates [8]. Due
to its molecular mass of 16.6 kDa, the novel parvulin was
denoted as Par17 following the E. coli Par10 and human
Par14 nomenclature. The longer parvulin protein is
encoded within the human genome but is absent from
rodent, bovine and non-mammalian genomes [8].
The present study shows that Par17 occurs only in
genomes from great apes species (Hominidae), but not in
those of other primates, as shown by parvulin sequences
from different primate genomic DNA samples. Par17 is
directed to mitochondria by the novel N-terminal domain
that functions as non-cleavable mitochondrial targeting
peptide. The protein associates with mitochondrial sur-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/37

faces and is transported into the matrix in a time and
membrane potential-dependent manner. Par17 binds to
double-stranded DNA at physiological salt concentrations
as Par14 does. Par17 is thus a Hominid-specific DNAbinding constituent of the mitochondrial matrix that has
not been detected in any recent mitochondrial proteomic
studies. In addition, the prepeptide represents the most
recently evolved functional mitochondrial targeting peptide known to date.

Results
Par17 occurrence in anthropoid genomic sequences
Within the human genome, the parvulin/PIN4 locus on
chromosome Xq13.1 encodes an elongated open reading
frame leading to the expression of Par17 [GenBank:NM_006223]. This elongation was already reported
to be absent from bovine and rodent genomes [8]. The
chimpanzee genome sequence [19] contained a gap at the
corresponding locus preventing a comparison to other
genomic parvulin sequences. Surprisingly, the macaque
genome that became publicly available at that time did
not contain an extended Par17. Therefore, further analysis
of the occurrence of an elongated parvulin within the
genomes of anthropoid species became of interest as
Par17's extension must have been acquired during anthropoid evolution.

As the presequence was not encoded by an additional
exon, but a 5' extension of exon 1, phylogenetic studies
could be performed on genomic DNA eliminating the
need for fresh primate material for mRNA isolation.
Genomic DNA from 10 different anthropoid species covering New World monkeys (owl monkey and cotton-top
tamarin), Old World monkeys (baboon, macaque and
African green monkey) and apes (gibbon, orang-utan,
gorilla, chimpanzee and human) were obtained from
ECACC. These genomic DNA samples originated from stable anthropoid cell lines. Primers were designed to fit to
primate sequences upon comparison of the human
genomic sequence with the macaque genome. A fragment
of the elongated exon 1 starting directly upstream of the
Par17 ATG and including part of the Par14 coding
sequence was PCR amplified from all these primate
sequences. Exon 3 is conserved in all mammals including
mouse, with only two amino acid exchanges between
humans and rodents, and was used as positive control.
Hence, genomic mouse DNA could serve as an ideal control for the existence of a parvulin gene (exon 3) and the
absence of an elongation (exon 1). Uniform PCR products
of the expected size were obtained in all reactions with
genomic DNA templates, except for mouse exon 1; these
products were all gel purified, cloned and sequenced. The
human and macaque sequences for exon 1 as well as
human, chimpanzee, macaque and mouse sequences for

exon 3 were identical to the respective Ensembl genomic
sequences.
DNA sequence alignments together with putative translation products are shown in Figure 1A,C for the analyzed
parts of exons 1 and 3, respectively, displaying high conservation within exon 3 and remarkable sequence changes
within exon 1. The Par17 N-terminal domain is preformed in the DNA sequences of all anthropoids; additional ATG codons at the putative starting position of
Par17 exist as well. However, they are out-of-frame in all
Old World and New World monkey species. Several mutational rearrangements shift the presequence in-frame with
Par14 allowing the expression of Par17 only in the Hominid sequences (Homo, Pan, Gorilla and Pongo). Although
the two ATG codons are in-frame within the Gibbon
sequence, an interspersed TAA stop codon prevents an
elongated open reading frame. The sequence changes
between different primate species are summarized in a
schematic representation of their phylogenetic relationship (Figure 1B).
The N-terminal extension of Par17 includes an amphipatic
α-helix
The Par17 protein differs from Par14 within the N-terminus by 25 additional amino acids. The N-terminal Par17
sequence from Met3 to Ala23 is predicted to adopt an αhelical conformation (Figure 2A) by the secondary structure prediction package NPS [20]. When drawn as helical
wheel, the amphipatic character of this part of Par17
becomes obvious, with Lys8, Arg12, Glu15, Arg18 and
Lys25 on the one side and Met3, Leu6, Leu7, Leu10,
Leu14 and Phe17 on the other (Figure 2B). The coupled
SNPs (Arg16Gln [NCBI-SNP:rs6525589] and Ser18Arg
[NCBI-SNP:rs7058353]) resulting in Q16R and R18S substitutions [8] within the predicted α-helix do not compromise the amphipatic character of the helix. We refer to
these isoforms from now on as Par17-QR and -RS.

Positively charged amphipatic N-terminal α-helices are
typical mitochondrial targeting signals [21]. Therefore, we
predicted Par17's cellular localization using the online
prediction tools Mitopred [22], Mitoprot [23], Predotar
[24], PSortII [25] and TargetP [26]. The respective values
for Par14, Par17-QR and -RS are given in Table 1. The 25
amino acid elongation is recognized as a mitochondrial
targeting peptide by Mitoprot and Predotar, but not by
PSORTII. By contrast, Mitopred classified Par14, Par17QR and -RS as mitochondrial. As it was not possible to
reliably predict Par17 localization by these prediction
algorithms, it became necessary to investigate the intracellular localization of parvulin proteins experimentally.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/37

Par17 is targeted to mitochondria within human cells
To determine the localization of the endogenous Par17
protein, an antibody against the N-terminal extension [8]
was used for Par17 detection in sub-cellular fractions.
HeLa cells were separated into cytosolic, nuclear, membrane and mitochondrial fractions, followed by Western
blotting. Par17 was detected as a 17 kDa protein species
within the mitochondrial and membrane fractions (Figure 3A). Purity of the mitochondrial fraction was demonstrated by blotting against cytochrome c. These data point
to an association of endogenous Par17 with mitochondria
or mitochondrial membranes.

To discriminate between Par17 and Par14 localization,
overexpression studies using EGFP fusions were performed. EGFP was C-terminally fused to Par17-QR and RS proteins and to Par14 as negative control. HeLa cells
grown on cover slips were transfected with the abovementioned constructs and stained with MitoTracker, a dye
that accumulates in mitochondria with intact membrane
potential. Fluorescence microscopic images of these constructs in HeLa cells are shown in Figure 3B; expression as
full-length proteins was verified by Western blot using an
anti-GFP antibody (Figure 3C). Par17-RS- and -QR-EGFP
co-localized with mitochondrial staining. Totals of 77 ± 5
and 63 ± 9% of EGFP fluorescence were measured to overlap with the MitoTracker signal for Par17-RS and -QR,
respectively. Par14-EGFP fluorescence is equally distributed throughout the cytosol and partially enriched in the
nucleus, as has been described previously [15,17]. Colocalization values were far lower for Par14-EGFP (11 ±
6%) and EGFP alone (4 ± 1%).
Therefore, the presequence seemed to be the determinant
for mitochondrial targeting, and the question arose
whether the Par17 N-terminus was necessary and/or sufficient for mitochondrial targeting. To investigate this,
EGFP was fused either to the presequence or to presequence coupled to the basic domain of Par17. Then, HeLa
cells were transfected with these constructs. Their EGFP
fluorescence overlapped with the MitoTracker signal to a
lesser extent than the full length Par17 constructs with colocalization ratios of 49 ± 8% for presequence-RS-basic
domain, 42 ± 11% for presequence-QR-basic domain, 29
± 15% for presequence-RS and 34 ± 13% for presequenceQR. As can be deduced from these data, the mitochondrial
association of Par17 is dependent on the presequence, but
the basic and PPIase domains enhance mitochondrial targeting. The transfected constructs and co-localization values are schematically depicted in Figure 3D. Taken
together, the cell fractionation studies and the localization
of parvulin EGFP fusions provide independent evidence
that Par17 isoforms are targeted to mitochondria.

Figure only encoded by genomic sequences of hominid species
Par17 is 1
Par17 is only encoded by genomic sequences of hominid species. A. Sequence alignment of Par17 sequences. Parvulin
exon 1 sequences were PCR amplified from genomic DNA of 10 different primate species. The resulting DNA sequences were
aligned with respect to the Par17 and Par14 ATG codons; the respective Bos taurus sequence was obtained from Ensembl and
aligned accordingly. Translated protein sequences in-frame with the respective ATG codons are given below the DNA
sequences with stop codons written in red. Within the genomic sequences of Homo sapiens and Macaca mulatta (obtained from
Ensembl), the Par17 ATG codons are immediately preceded by an in-frame stop codon. The Q16/R18 to R16/S18 coupled
SNPs that were described for the human sequence are highlighted in grey; comparison with the other primate sequences
reveals the QR form to be the ancestral one. Phylogenetic clades used in scheme B are indicated by boxes here and the respective abbreviations from B. B. Phylogenetic scheme of primate relationships and Par17 sequence features. The Par17 elongation
is preformed in sequence in all anthropoid genomic DNAs tested. Additional ATG codons at the putative starting position of
Par17 exist in all tested species, but are out-of-frame relative to the Par14 coding sequence in New World and Old World
monkeys. The gap of five nucleotides in New World monkeys shrinks to a gap of four nucleotides in Old World monkeys, still
preventing a continuous ORF with Par14. The upstream ATG codons are in-frame with the Par14 sequence in the clade of
apes, only. Within the gibbon sequence however, an in-frame stop codon prevents expression of an extended protein. This
stop codon has been sequenced in three independent clones. Thus, only Hominidae (Homo, Pan, Gorilla and Pongo) possess an
extended ORF that can lead to the expression of Par17. (The length of the branches in this scheme does not reflect any phylogenetic distances.) C. Exon 3 sequences were obtained as in A. Exon 3 sequences are highly conserved with only two amino
acid substitutions between human and cow or human and mouse, respectively. Amino acid exchanges relative to the human
sequence are in white on black. Phylogenetic groupings are indicated by boxes as in A.

sequence from Met3 to Ala23 is predicted to adopt α-helical conformation ("H") by different algorithms within the NPS prediction package, whereas the remaining part of this sequence is predicted to be random coil ("."). The PPIase domain starts at

large, hydrophobic residues highlighted in grey, basic residues in blue and acidic ones in red.

Par17 import into isolated mitochondria
If the Par17 presequence represents a classical mitochondrial targeting signal, Par17 would be expected to be
imported into mitochondria. However, a recent study
reported cell type-specific mitochondrial association, but
not import, of the related protein Pin1 [27]. Therefore, it
was interesting to differentiate between association and
import by invitro experiments with isolated mitochondria.
As Par17-QR- and -RS-EGFP fusions co-localized with
mitochondrial staining to the same extent within the
range of error, the following in vitro experiments were performed with the QR isoform only. Par17 and Par14 were
labeled by 35S-methionine incorporation and incubated
with isolated yeast mitochondria. Soluble protein was
separated from mitochondria and the mitochondrial pellet was subsequently washed with increasing salt concen-

trations followed by autoradiography (Figure 4A, left
panel). As positive control, the yeast porin efficiently integrated into the outer mitochondrial membrane and therefore exhibited a salt-independent association with
mitochondria, whereas GFP (as a negative control) was
not able to associate with mitochondria at any salt concentrations. Par17 associated with mitochondria and
could only be released to 50% upon washing with 600
mM NaCl, indicating tight association and/or import (Figure 4A, right panel). Interestingly, Par14 also associated at
low salt concentrations with mitochondria, but was efficiently released from mitochondria at physiological or
higher salt concentrations (80 mM NaCl corresponded to
physiological conditions within this experimental buffer
system [28]).

Par17 is targeted to mitochondria in human cells. A. Endogenous Par17 in sub-cellular fractions. HeLa cells were separated into cytoplasmic (Cyt), nucleic (Nuc), membrane (Me) and mitochondrial (Mito) fractions. Equal protein amounts were
separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with antibodies against the Par17 N-terminus
or marker proteins. Par17 was detected as 17 kDa protein species within the membrane and mitochondrial fractions. Par17
without fusion tags expressed in E. coli BL21 from a pET-41 vector was used as positive control (+). B. Cellular localization of

into HeLa cells grown on cover slips, stained with MitoTracker and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and 3D reconstitution. EGFP and MitoTracker fluorescence are shown as well as an overlay of these channels. White bar corresponds to 10 µm.
The position of the Z stack image (3–4 µm in height) is indicated within the respective overlay image. A pronounced overlap
between EGFP and MitoTracker signals is visible with the Par17-EGFP constructs that is not observed with Par14-EGFP or
EGFP alone. C. Expression of the transfected constructs within HeLa cells as full length proteins. Anti-GFP Western blot and
part of the Coomassie stained gel showing equal loading. All constructs were detected as full length protein species: Par17EGFP (44.1 kDa, arrow head), Par14-EGFP (44.1 kDa, arrow) and EGFP (26.9 kDa, asterisk). D. Co-localization values of different EGFP fusion constructs. The fraction of EGFP fluorescence overlapping with the MitoTracker signal (in percent) was determined using the Cell^P co-localization tool for the fusion constructs shown in B. In addition, co-localization values for EGFP
fusions of prepeptide and prepeptide coupled to the basic domain are displayed. All constructs containing the prepeptide were
both tested as QR and RS variants. Co-localization values are expressed in percent ± standard deviation for more than 10 cells.

Next, mitochondria isolated from human, rat and yeast
cells were used for proteinase K (PK) import studies,
where all protein associated with mitochondria is re-isolated by centrifugation. Any protein that is not protected
by translocation into sub-mitochondrial compartments
will subsequently be degraded by PK. Although both
Par14 and Par17-QR were degraded at 50 µg/ml PK (Figure 4B, left panel), at least 100 µg/ml PK were used
throughout the following import studies. Par17 was reisolated after incubation together with all types of mitochondria used (Figure 4B, right panel), again pointing to
an association of the protein with mitochondrial
organelles. Moreover, PK treatment showed that this
labeled protein reached a protease-protected compartment, indicating import. Par14 also associated with mitochondria, but was not imported as it was completely
degraded by PK.
Kinetic import experiments were then performed with different incubation times. Figure 4C shows the Par17
import into yeast and human mitochondria increased
with time. As absolute import efficiencies cannot be compared between mitochondria from different sources, we
used the fusion protein Su9-DHFR as positive control.
Import into yeast mitochondria was significant, but rather
low when compared to Su9-DHFR. However, Par17-QR
and Su9-DHFR showed similar import efficiencies upon
incubation with human mitochondria from the same
preparation.
To test for the dependence on the mitochondrial membrane potential, yeast mitochondria were incubated with
valinomycin either before or after the import reaction to
dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential. If
import depends on the membrane potential, mitochondria with the de-coupling agent added before import
would not import Par17 to the matrix. If this is not the
case, Par17 should be imported irrespective of when valinomycin was added. As seen in Figure 4D, Par17 is only
imported into mitochondria with intact membrane
potential (lane 2 vs 3: addition of valinomycin after and
before import, respectively). Therefore, the import of
Par17 is dependent on an intact potential across the inner
mitochondrial membrane.
To define the sub-mitochondrial localization of Par17
more precisely, a final set of import experiments were performed with reference proteins from different mitochondrial compartments. Par17 and the yeast porin, a
component of the outer mitochondrial membrane were
imported into rat mitochondria (Figure 4E). In a parallel
reaction mitochondria were subjected to hypo-osmotic
swelling, resulting in rupture of the outer membrane and
loss of the porin protein. Par17, however, remained protected from PK degradation – indicating that it is at the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/37

very least transported to the inner mitochondrial membrane. It can only be degraded by PK when the mitochondria are lysed completely by the addition of 1% digitonin.
The inner membrane protein Tim23 and the matrix protein Mge1, as controls for inner mitochondrial compartments, together with Par17 were then monitored during
stepwise lysis of mitochondria using digitonin. Identical
mitochondrial lysis reactions were performed for all three
proteins with increasing amounts of digitonin, analyzed
by autoradiography (Par17) or Western blot (Tim23 and
Mge1). At a concentration of 0.1% digitonin the inner
membrane protein Tim23 was already partially degraded,
while Par17 and the matrix protein Mge1 resist PK degradation (Figure 4F). Tim23 is known to display one PK sensitive domain to the inter-membrane space, [29] which
served as an epitope for the antibody used here. All three
proteins became susceptible to PK degradation when the
mitochondria were lysed completely by 0.2% digitonin.
Therefore, combined data obtained from in vitro experiments with yeast, rat and human mitochondria demonstrate the import of Par17 into mitochondria to be
dependent on the presence of the novel N-terminal
domain. In addition, Par17 was imported in a time- and
membrane potential-dependent manner to the mitochondrial matrix, but without concomitant processing of the
protein.
Par17 binds to double-stranded DNA at physiological salt
concentrations
Par17 and Par14 exhibit different N-terminal regions and
markedly different sub-cellular localizations. Therefore,
the question arose whether Par17 can be involved in similar cellular functions as the nuclear-enriched Par14, yet
within a different sub-cellular compartment: the mitochondrion. The highly conserved protein Par14 binds to
AT-rich double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) within the
nucleus [15], displays certain similarities to HMG proteins [13,15] and is assumed to be involved in transcriptional regulation. Hence, we tested whether binding
characteristics to dsDNA were retained between the different parvulins. Binding of Par17-QR and Par14 to DNA cellulose was studied using radiolabeled lysates. Bound
protein was eluted with increasing concentrations of KCl.
Only at salt concentrations between 100 and 200 mM KCl
was Par17-QR eluted from DNA cellulose (Figure 5A),
with a residual Par17 fraction even eluting at 500 mM
KCl. Par14 behaved in a similar manner. Porin was used
as negative control for DNA cellulose binding and was
already washed off with 0 and 50 mM KCl. A parallel DNA
binding assay was performed with Par17-QR, -RS and
Par14 as EGFP fusions expressed in HeLa cells. Gels were
quantified by densitometry, with good agreement with
the assay using radiolabeled proteins. From Figure 5B it
can be derived that Par17-QR, -RS and Par14 all were

Par17 import into isolated mitochondria
Figure 4
Par17 import into isolated mitochondria. A. Par17 and Par14 associate with mitochondrial surfaces in a salt-dependent manner. Yeast mitochondria were incubated
with 35S-methionine labeled Par17 and Par14 lysates for 15 min at 25°C; Porin and GFP lysates were used as controls. Mitochondria were separated from soluble protein
by the addition 500 mM sucrose buffer, subsequent centrifugation and additional washing in a 250 mM sucrose containing SEM buffer to ensure efficient separation of
mitochondria from lysate ingredients. Mitochondria were then suspended in buffer containing increasing salt concentrations (0, 80 and 600 mM NaCl) and re-isolated by
centrifugation. The samples within each panel including the respective reference sample (L, 20% for Porin and GFP, 50% for Par14 and Par17) were separated on the same
gel to allow direct comparison (M +, mitochondria added). The amount of associated radioactively labeled protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Mitochondrial association of Par14 and Par17 as displayed as bars on the diagram represent data normalized to the highest value including error bars (standard deviation for n
= 3). B. Par17, but not Par14, is imported into isolated human, rat and yeast mitochondria. Left. Par17-QR and Par14 35S-methionine labeled lysates were incubated with
different amounts of PK showing complete degradation of soluble parvulin proteins at a PK concentration of 50 µg/ml; at least 100 µg/ml PK were used for all following
experiments. Right. Radiolabeled Par17-QR was incubated with mitochondria from human Jurkat cells, rat liver or from yeast either with or without subsequent proteinase K (PK) treatment (at least 100 µg/ml for 10 min). Mitochondria were then re-isolated by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Par17
reached a PK protected compartment irrespective of the source of mitochondria indicating mitochondrial import. Par14, also present in this reaction, could be re-isolated together with mitochondria during centrifugation, but did not reach a protease-protected compartment. C. Time dependence of Par17 mitochondrial import. Mitochondria from yeast and human Jurkat cells were incubated with Par17-QR lysates for the times indicated followed by PK treatment. To assess relative import
efficiencies, lysates of Su9-DHFR (amino acids 1–69 from subunit 9 of Neurospora crassa ATP synthetase fused to mouse DHFR [28]) were imported into the same mitochondrial preparations for equal time intervals at identical reaction conditions. Import reactions of Par17-QR and mature Su9-DHFR were analyzed by autoradiography
and densitometric quantifications. Values were expressed as percent of added protein with correction for the different numbers of methionine residues in the precursor
and processed proteins of Su9-DHFR. D. Par17 import depends on the mitochondrial membrane potential. Import reactions were performed as in B (right panel). Mitochondria were treated with the uncoupling reagent valinomycin to dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential either before or after import reaction. Par17 was only
imported into mitochondria with intact membrane potential (without valinomycin; or when the uncoupling agent was added after import). E. Par17 reaches the inner
membrane of rat mitochondria. Porin and Par17-QR were imported into mitochondria isolated from rat liver. The outer mitochondrial membrane was removed by hypoosmotic swelling as indicated by the disappearance of the porin signal. The Par17 band however only disappeared upon complete lysis of mitochondria by digitonin indicating that Par17 was imported at least to the inner mitochondrial membrane. F. Par17 is imported into the mitochondrial matrix. Import reactions with yeast mitochondria were performed with increasing amounts of digitonin leading to stepwise lysis. The amounts of Par17-QR, the inner membrane protein Tim23 and the matrix protein
Mge1 were monitored in parallel samples using autoradiography for Par17 and Western blotting for Tim23 and Mge1. Tim23 is already degraded at a concentration of
0.1% digitonin, while Par17-QR and the matrix protein Mge1 resist PK. Degradation of these two proteins is only observed upon addition of 0.2% digitonin indicating that
Par17 is transported to the mitochondrial matrix. Gels (upper part) and densitometric analysis (lower part) are shown.

comparably eluted from dsDNA at 100, 200 and even 500
mM KCl, whereas EGFP without fusion was completely
eluted from the DNA cellulose beads at 50 mM KCl. Partial degradation of nucleic acids bound to the DNA cellulose beads used in these experiments by Benzonase
diminished Par17 binding (data not shown). This shows
that the Hominid-specific mitochondrial matrix protein
Par17 can bind to double-stranded DNA at physiological
salt concentrations.

Discussion
Import of Par17 into mitochondria
The recently described protein Par17 differs from the
highly conserved parvulin Par14 only by a novel N-terminal domain. In this study, endogenous Par17 was detected
in membrane and mitochondrial fractions, and EGFP
fusions of Par17 were targeted to mitochondria. The dye
used in these experiments (MitoTracker) is only accumulated by mitochondria with intact membrane potential.
As no differing mitochondrial staining was detected for
transfected cells as compared to untransfected ones, overexpression of Par17 seemed not to be toxic for HeLa cell
mitochondria. EGFP fusions of the two Par17 isoforms,
Par17-QR and -RS, were targeted to mitochondria with no
significant differences in their co-localization values with
MitoTracker. Therefore, only one isoform of Par17
(Par17-QR) was used for in vitro import experiments with
isolated mitochondria; these experiments clearly showed
human Par17 to be imported into the matrix of human,
rat and yeast mitochondria. In addition, association of
Par17 and Par14 proteins with mitochondrial surfaces
was shown irrespective of the origin of the organelles.
Consequently, most of the subsequent studies were performed with yeast mitochondria due to their experimental
advantages [30], showing the import of Par17 to be
dependent on intact mitochondrial membrane potential
and to increase with time. Finally, sub-mitochondrial
localization experiments showed that Par17 reached the
mitochondrial matrix. Rulten et al [11] have already
detected Par14 within the mitochondrial matrix using an
antibody against the PPIase domain. However, as this
domain is shared between the two proteins Par14 and
Par17, the signal is likely to have originated from Par17
and not Par14.

One puzzling observation was that in vitro imported as
well as endogenous Par17 within mitochondrial fractions
was not processed after mitochondrial import, which
would be expected for a classical targeting peptide. However, non-cleavable presequences have been described for
the HSP60 chaperonin 10 [31], rhodanese [32], 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase [33] and the beta-subunit of the human
electron-transfer flavoprotein [34]. Whether the negative
charge of Glu15 within the amphipatic helix prevents this
presequence being recognized by the matrix processing

to DNA. Radiolabeled Par17-QR and Par14 proteins were used for DNA
cellulose binding assays. Following incubation of dsDNA with protein
lysates, bound protein was eluted with increasing KCl concentrations. 20%
of lysate (Lys) and KCl fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Asterisk (*), unspecific band caused by free label. Prominent
signals for both, Par17 and Par14, are seen at 100 and 200 mM KCl. Porin

Quantitative analysis. Par17-QR, -RS and Par14 fused to EGFP as well as
EGFP without fusions were subjected to the DNA binding assay. Blots
were quantitatively analyzed by densitometry. Data from each experiment
were normalized to their sum. Standard deviations are given from duplicate experiments. Par17 and Par14 proteins were eluted from dsDNA cellulose at 100, 200 and to a lesser extent at 500 mM KCl pointing to similar
DNA-binding of the two parvulin proteins at physiological salt concentrations. EGFP without fusions was completely eluted from DNA cellulose at
50 mM KCl.

peptidase in analogy of yeast Leu9 [35] – another un-processed matrix protein with a glutamate at position 11 –
remains to be tested. Even as a non-cleavable presequence, the N-terminal domain was shown to be necessary for import, but the basic and PPIase domains increase
mitochondrial targeting.
Mitochondrial proteomic studies
As a mitochondrial protein, Par17 should have previously
been detected in one of the recently performed proteomic
studies on the constituents of the mitochondrial proteome. Although the yeast mitochondrial proteome has
been explored experimentally to about 80% coverage
using a variety of mass spectroscopy and tagging techniques [36,37], neither Par14 nor Par17 are encoded by
the yeast genome. Recent proteomic analysis of the yeast
mitochondrial proteome (PROMITO) identified two
novel PPIases (CPR1, [GenBank:NP_010439] and FPR1,

Page 9 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2007, 5:37

[GenBank:NP_014264]) [38] with no sequence similarities to the parvulins described in this study. Mitochondrial proteomes of mammalian species are assumed to be
considerably more complex [39], and their proportionate
coverage by proteomic methods is correspondingly low
[40,41]. The fraction of mitochondrial proteomes resisting identification by large-scale approaches tends to contain proteins that are expressed in low concentrations or
only under certain conditions [42] as well as hydrophobic, small and/or highly basic proteins [41] with isoelectric points (pI) above 8. With an mRNA level about 50- to
100-fold lower than that of Par14 [8] and a pI of 9.96,
Par17 hence represents a mitochondrial, low abundance,
basic protein having escaped detection within mitochondria, even in a recent proteomic study on the human mitochondrial DNA nucleoid [43]. Peptides contained in
either Par14 or Par17 have not been listed in any of the
studies mentioned above.
Evolution of the Par17 prepeptide within anthropoid
primates
The proteome of mitochondria has changed dramatically
during eukaryotic evolution, with proteins continuously
recruited to the mitochondria expanding the proteome of
this organelle and providing it with new functions or
adaptations [42]. Mitochondrial recruitment can occur by
exon duplication and exon shuffling, thereby exchanging
existing targeting signals between different nuclear genes
[42] as has been described, for example, for the rps11 gene
from Oryza sativa [44] or the plant cytochrome c1 precursor [45].

The contrary seems to be the case with Par17. The evolution of Par17's presequence follows the evolution of primates as can be derived from the DNA sequences
obtained in this study. Whereas the coding sequence for
Par14 is highly conserved within all primates, the presequence of Par17 evolved steadily from New World monkeys to great apes. There is no spontaneous occurrence of
a functional presequence as a result of an exchange with
other nuclear encoded genes as this sequence motif is not
found anywhere else in the human or macaque genomes.
Taken the estimated time scales for primate evolution
from Glazko and Nei [46] and Goodman et al [47], the
insertion leading to the 5' ATG codons to be in-frame with
the Par14 coding sequence was acquired not until the separation of Old World monkeys and apes about 23 ± 2 million years ago. Gibbons are known to have separated from
great apes about 16 million years ago. The introduction of
an interrupting TAA stop codon between the Par17 ATG
and the Par14 ATG must have occurred after this branching point, but a more exact time point cannot be concluded from these data. Thus, phylogenetic comparison of
genomic sequence data from 10 different primate species
confines the Par17 protein to Hominids, only. The prese-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/37

quence therefore represents the most recently evolved
functional mitochondrial targeting peptide known to date
as it was not acquired until the divergence of apes and Old
World
monkeys.
Another issue that can be addressed in light of the different genomic Par17 sequences is the occurrence of the different human Par17 isoforms QR and RS. From the
alignment in Figure 1A it can be derived that the isoform
with Gln16 and Arg18 is the ancestral one. Why humans
have acquired these coding SNP and if they serve any
function remains to be elucidated in the future.
Could the 5' UTR of parvulin mRNAs have had a function
for Par14 expression before it became a coding sequence?
The partially conserved upstream ATG codons and short
upstream open reading frames might have been involved
in translational (down-) regulation of Par14 expression as
has been described for other proteins [48,49]. In addition,
differing mRNA secondary structures of the parvulin 5'
UTR for several primates were predicted using the MFold
prediction server [50]. Within the non-Hominid primate
mRNAs, the sequence downstream of the first AUG codon
is involved in an extended mRNA stem loop. This putative
secondary structure is disturbed by the insertion leading
to the sequence found in apes. Therefore, we speculate
that mRNA secondary structure and/or translational regulation of Par14 was the evolutionary driving force for this
part of the parvulin mRNA before it gained a protein coding function in great apes.
The evolutionary transition from apes to great apes
involved significant remodeling of protein constituents of
mitochondria: cytochrome c oxidase subunits [51,52] as
constituents of the electron transport chain [53] as well as
ATP synthetase subunits [54] have undergone accelerated
changes during primate evolution. Par17 within the mitochondrial matrix now represents a novel protein constituent added to the Hominid-specific mitochondrial
proteome.
Par17 as mitochondrial DNA-binding protein
From the three PPIase families known, cyclophilinD and
FKBP-38 have already been shown to be recruited to mitochondria where they play a role at the permeability transition pore and in apoptosis, respectively [55,56]. However,
none of these PPIases is known to bind to doublestranded DNA (dsDNA). The present study however
shows that Par17 is able to bind to dsDNA at physiological salt concentrations in a similar way to Par14. Assuming that sequence specificity is not altered between Par17
and Par14, the 16569 base pairs comprising human mitochondrial genome [GenBank:AC_000021] was searched
for the following motifs that have been identified as tightest binders by Surmacz et al [15]: dsDNA octamers

Page 10 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2007, 5:37

TAAAAAAT, ATGAAAAT and ATAAAAAT. As octamers,
each of these motifs should statistically occur once in 65.5
kB of random sequence. As seven such motifs can be
found within the human mitochondrial RefSeq DNA
sequence, putative Par17 binding sites seem to be
enriched within the mitochondrial genome. A function
for Par17 in the context of mitochondrial DNA also seems
likely due to its similarities to HMG proteins [13,15] as
mitochondrial HMG proteins have been described very
recently [57].

Conclusion
The DNA binding parvulin protein Par17 is targeted to the
mitochondrial matrix by the most recently evolved mitochondrial prepeptide known to-date only occurring in
great apes species and man. Brain enlargement in primates has been paralleled by a significant remodeling of
the mitochondrial proteome. Hence, a novel protein constituent of the Hominidae specific mitochondrial protein
repertoire might have implications on the molecular
understanding of brain diseases and the evolution of
man.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis of genomic sequences
Genomic DNAs of the following species were obtained
from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC,
Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK): Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla,
Pongo pygmaeus, Hylobates sp., Papio hamadryas, Macaca
mulatta, Chlorocebus aethiops, Aotus trivirgatus and Saguinus
oedipus . Human genomic DNA as a positive control was
extracted from HeLa cells according to [58]. Genomic
DNA from C57 BL6/J mice was kindly provided by Dr

Cell fractionation and Western blotting
For cell fractionation, HeLa cells were grown to confluence in petri dishes in medium containing D-MEM, 1×
MEM and 1% FCS (all Gibco/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 37°C and 7.5% CO2, trypsinized and washed in
D-MEM. Cell pellets were separated into cytoplasmic,
nucleic, membrane and mitochondrial fractions using the
Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleic
fraction was resuspended in 200 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH
8.8. Equal amounts of protein (30 µg) were separated on
15% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 100 mA, 35
min. Following 30 min blocking with TBS-T 150 + 2% (w/
v) dry milk, membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C
with one of the following primary antibodies in TBS-T
150 + 2% milk: rabbit antiserum against the N-terminal
Par17 extension (Ab-EXT, [8], 1:200 dilution); mouse
anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12, Abcam, 1:200); rabbit HRP-conjugated anti-GAPDH (Abcam, 1:500). The
blots were then incubated with the respective HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed using ECL kits
(GE Amersham Bioscience, Freiburg, Germany) and CLXPosure X-ray film (Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany).
Construction and expression of EGFP fusion proteins

PCR products were EcoRI/BamHI cloned into the pEGFPN1 vector (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) and
were verified by sequencing.

For expression of parvulin EGFP constructs HeLa cells
were grown on cover slips in 12-well plates in HeLa cell
medium (as described above) to about 70–80% confluence. Transfections were performed using FuGene (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's

instructions and cells were allowed to grow for 40 h. Then
the medium was removed and cells were washed in PBS
pH 7.4 (Gibco/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). For
mitochondrial staining cells were incubated in a 100 nM
solution of MitoTracker orange (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 30 min, afterwards
washed in PBS and fixed in PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cover slips
were washed and mounted on microscope slides.
Image acquisition and data analysis
Image data were retrieved and analyzed with an Olympus
BX61 Microscope equipped with bandpass filter cubes, an
UPlan SApo 100× Oil objective, an F-View II camera and
the Cell^P software (all from Olympus, Hamburg, Germany, and SIS Soft Imaging Systems, Muenster, Germany). Deconvolution of Z-stacks was performed using
the nearest neighbor deconvolution algorithm with a haze
removal factor of 99%. Processing of the pictures and calculation of co-localization values were all performed
within the Cell^P software. In addition, cells were analyzed with a Leica DM IRB Confocal Microscope with TCS
SP 2 Confocal Scanner (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) to judge
the quality of the deconvoluted Z-stacks described above.
Isolation of mitochondria
Mitochondria from yeast were isolated from wild type
strain PK82 (MAT α, his4-713, lys2, ura3-52, trp1, leu2-3;
[61] grown in YPG medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2%
(w/v) bacto-peptone, pH 5.0, containing 3% (v/v) glycerol) following standard procedures [28,30]. Rat liver and
Jurkat cells mitochondria were obtained essentially as
published previously [62,63].
Import of proteins into isolated mitochondria
Radiolabeled Par17-QR, -RS, Par14 and control proteins
were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT T7
Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega, Mannheim, Germany) in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine (ICN Biomedical Research Products, Eschwege,
Germany). In sample sizes of 50–100 µl the radiolabeled
proteins were imported into isolated mitochondria as
described previously [28]. Under standard conditions, the
import assay contained BSA buffer (3% (w/v) BSA, 80 mM
KCl, 10 mM MOPS-KOH, pH7.2), 2–5 µl reticulocyte
lysate, 2 mM NADH, 1 mM ATP, 20 mM potassium phosphate and yeast mitochondria (30 µg mitochondrial protein). As import into isolated mammalian mitochondria
is generally less efficient compared to yeast mitochondria
[28,64], mammalian mitochondria were added at a
higher concentration (40 µg mammalian mitochondrial
protein). The import reactions were carried out at 25°C
and protein uptake stopped by incubation at 0°C. Nonimported proteins were either degraded by addition of
proteinase K at a final concentration of at least 100 µg/ml

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/37

and incubation for 10 min at 0°C or the samples were left
untreated. The protease was inactivated by addition of 2
mM PMSF and additional incubation for 5 min at 0°C.
Eventually, the mitochondrial membrane potential was
dissipated by addition of valinomycin (Sigma, Munich,
Germany) at a final concentration of 1 µM from a 100fold concentrated stock solution in ethanol. Selective
opening of the mitochondrial outer membrane was
achieved by incubation of mitochondria in EM buffer (1
mM EDTA, 10 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) for 20 min at
0°C (swelling). Alternatively, digitonin (Calbiochem/
Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was added up to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v). For association studies, mitochondria were separated from soluble protein by the
addition of SEM buffer (500 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10
mM MOPS, pH 7.2) and subsequent centrifugation. An
additional washing step in a 250 mM sucrose containing
SEM buffer was performed to ensure efficient separation
of mitochondria from lysate ingredients.
DNA binding assay
HeLa cells were transfected with Par14-, Par17-RS- and
Par17-QR-EGFP fusion constructs as described above and
lysed in 50 mM K-PO4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X, 1 mM
Pefablock (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), pH 7.0. Cells were
filled up to a total volume of 4 ml with dilution buffer (20
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
DTT, 0.1% Triton X, 37.5 mM (NH4)2SO4), disrupted by
ultrasonic and centrifuged to remove debris (20 min, 4°C,
4000 × g). DNA cellulose (0.25 g calf thymus DNA cellulose (Sigma, Munich, Germany)) was suspended in 3 ml
binding buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100
mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF and 0.1% Triton X)
and incubated rotating at 4°C overnight. A total of 850 µl
of cellulose suspension was transferred to a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube, washed with fresh binding buffer and
centrifuged (10 min, 4°C, 2000 × g) three times. The
supernatant was then replaced by 850 µl of cell lysate. The
suspension was incubated with rotating for 1 h at 4°C and
then centrifuged (2 min, 10000 × g, 4°C). The supernatant was stored at 4°C. The cellulose was washed successively with binding buffer containing increasing
concentrations of KCl. After each washing step the suspension was incubated and centrifuged as described above.
All supernatants were methanol/chloroform precipitated,
run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western
blotting using anti-GFP antibodies as described above.
Blots were analyzed quantitatively by densitometry using
Scion Image software [65].

The experiments were repeated using radiolabeled proteins instead of EGFP fusion constructs. Here, 50 µl of cellulose suspension and 5 µl of cell lysate as well as 50 µl of
the different binding buffers were sufficient. All incuba-
