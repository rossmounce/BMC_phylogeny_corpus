Abstract
Background: The Streptophyta comprises all land plants and six groups of charophycean green
algae. The scaly biflagellate Mesostigma viride (Mesostigmatales) and the sarcinoid Chlorokybus
atmophyticus (Chlorokybales) represent the earliest diverging lineages of this phylum. In trees based
on chloroplast genome data, these two charophycean green algae are nested in the same clade. To
validate this relationship and gain insight into the ancestral state of the mitochondrial genome in
the Charophyceae, we sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Chlorokybus and compared
this genome sequence with those of three other charophycean green algae and the bryophytes
Marchantia polymorpha and Physcomitrella patens.
Results: The Chlorokybus genome differs radically from its 42,424-bp Mesostigma counterpart in
size, gene order, intron content and density of repeated elements. At 201,763-bp, it is the largest
mtDNA yet reported for a green alga. The 70 conserved genes represent 41.4% of the genome
sequence and include nad10 and trnL(gag), two genes reported for the first time in a streptophyte
mtDNA. At the gene order level, the Chlorokybus genome shares with its Chara, Chaetosphaeridium
and bryophyte homologues eight to ten gene clusters including about 20 genes. Notably, some of
these clusters exhibit gene linkages not previously found outside the Streptophyta, suggesting that
they originated early during streptophyte evolution. In addition to six group I and 14 group II
introns, short repeated sequences accounting for 7.5% of the genome were identified.
Mitochondrial trees were unable to resolve the correct position of Mesostigma, due to analytical
problems arising from accelerated sequence evolution in this lineage.
Conclusion: The Chlorokybus and Mesostigma mtDNAs exemplify the marked fluidity of the
mitochondrial genome in charophycean green algae. The notion that the mitochondrial genome
was constrained to remain compact during charophycean evolution is no longer tenable. Our data
raise the possibility that the emergence of land plants was not associated with a substantial gain of
intergenic sequences by the mitochondrial genome.

Background
Green algae belonging to the class Charophyceae gave rise
to all land plant species [1,2]. In contrast to the large
diversity of land plants, only a few thousand charophycean species are living today. Charophycean green algae
and land plants form the lineage Streptophyta [3],
whereas all of the other extant green algae belong to the
sister lineage Chlorophyta [2]. Six monophyletic groups
are currently recognized in the Charophyceae: the Mesostigmatales [4] represented by the scaly biflagellate Mesostigma viride that has long been regarded as a member of
the Prasinophyceae (the earliest-diverging lineage of the
Chlorophyta) [5], the Chlorokybales represented as well
by a single species (Chlorokybus atmophyticus), the Klebsormidiales, the Zygnematales, the Coleochaetales and the
Charales [6]. A phylogeny based on the nuclear 18S rRNA
gene, the chloroplast atpB and rbcL and the mitochondrial
nad5 from eight land plants, 26 charophycean taxa and
five chlorophytes supports the notions that the Charales
are sister to land plants and that charophycean green algae
evolved progressively toward a more elaborated cellular
complexity, occurring sequentially as biflagellated unicells, cubical packets of a few non-flagellated cells (sarcinoid morphology), unbranched/branched filaments and
complex branched thalli with parenchymatous tissue
[4,7]. In this four-gene tree, the deepest branch is occupied by the Mesostigmatales, the Chlorokybales emerge
just after the Mesostigmatales, the Zygnematales are
resolved as the next divergence and finally, the Coleochaetales are sister to the clade uniting the Charales and land
plants. This branching order of charophycean lineages,
however, is not entirely congruent with phylogenetic studies based exclusively on concatenated organelle genes [812]; in particular, the position of the Mesostigmatales and
the identity of the charophycean lineage(s) that is sister to
land plants have raised controversies.
The debate about the position of the Mesostigmatales has
now been resolved [13,14]. The biflagellate Mesostigma
represented the earliest divergence of the Streptophyta in
the four-gene tree [4] and in single-gene trees based on
18S rDNA [15] and actin genes [16], whereas separate
phylogenetic analyses of large data sets containing concatenated chloroplast genes/proteins [8,9,17,18] or mitochondrial proteins [10] placed the Mesostigmatales
before the split of the Streptophyta and Chlorophyta.
Because the latter phylogenies included members of only
a few green plant lineages, sparse taxon sampling was suspected to be a possible cause of the conflicting results. We
recently generated and annotated the Chlorokybus chloroplast genome sequence and in the course of comparing
this sequence with all previously sequenced chloroplast
genomes, gathered compelling evidence for the affiliation
of Mesostigma with the Streptophyta [13]. This charophycean chloroplast genome remarkably resembles its Mes-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/137

ostigma homologue at various levels (size, gene content,
gene order and intron content) and interestingly, the Mesostigmatales and Chlorokybales form a robust clade representing the deepest branch of the Streptophyta in
phylogenies based on concatenated gene sequences.
Strong support for Mesostigma being nested within the
Streptophyta also comes from phylogenetic analyses of
125 nuclear-encoded proteins [14]; however, in this
investigation, the relationship of the Mesostigmatales
with the other charophycean groups could not be
addressed because the Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex (Zygnematales) was the only additional
streptophyte alga examined.
In the present study, we undertook the sequencing of
Chlorokybus atmophyticus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
with the goal of gaining better insight into the nature of
the mitochondrial genome in the last common ancestor
of all streptophytes. Given the abovementioned evidence
for the close affiliation of Chlorokybus and Mesostigma in
chloroplast phylogenomic trees, it was also of great interest to find out to what degree the Chlorokybus genome is
similar to its Mesostigma counterpart and to mtDNAs of
other charophycean green algae and land plants (in particular, bryophytes). Aside from Mesostigma [10], Chaetosphaeridium globosum (Coleochaetales) and Chara vulgaris
(Charales) are the only charophyceans whose complete
mtDNA sequences have been reported to date [19,20] and
compared with their homologues in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha [21] and the recently investigated moss
Physcomitrella patens [22]. The three charophycean
genomes are more densely packed with genes than their
bryophyte homologues, although all five genomes have a
similar coding potential. The higher degree of compaction
observed for charophycean genomes largely explains their
smaller sizes compared to land plant genomes. These
observations are consistent with the notions that the last
common ancestor of all streptophytes carried a relatively
small and gene-rich mitochondrial genome and that substantial expansion of the intergenic spacers coincided with
the emergence of land plants. Strikingly, at the gene
organizational level, the Mesostigma genome has retained
only traces of the numerous ancestral gene clusters preserved in other streptophyte mtDNAs. Gene order and
intron content in the Chara genome most resemble those
of land plant mtDNAs.
We report here that the Chlorokybus mitochondrial
genome differs dramatically from Mesostigma mtDNA at
the levels of size, gene order and intron content. Although
the Chlorokybus genome is substantially larger than any
other green algal mtDNA characterized yet, its gene organization features a pronounced degree of ancestral features.
Our findings provide new light into mitochondrial
genome evolution in the Streptophyta.

Results
General genomic features
The Chlorokybus mtDNA sequence maps as a circular molecule of 201,763 bp (Figure 1), with an overall A+T content of 60.2%. This sequence is 4.8-fold larger than its
Mesostigma counterpart [10] and is the largest among all
green algal mitochondrial genomes sequenced to date.
While the Chlorokybus mitochondrial genome is slightly
smaller (20 kb) than the mtDNA of rapeseed [23] and is
nearly two- to three-fold smaller than all six other
angiosperm mtDNAs whose complete sequences have
been reported thus far [24-29], its size exceeds those
observed for the mtDNAs of the liverwort Marchantia [21]
and the moss Physcomitrella [22] (Table 1). Considering
that this charophycean green algal genome encodes 70
conserved genes, its coding capacity closely matches those
of its homologues in the charophyceans Chaetosphaeridium (Coleochaetales) [19] and Chara (Charales) [20], the
bryophytes Marchantia and Physcomitrella [21,22] (Table
1) and the chlorophyte Nephroselmis olivacea (Prasinophyceae) [30]. The gene repertoires of angiosperm mtDNAs (see Table 1 in [20]) and other completely sequenced
green algal mtDNAs (see Table 1 in [31]) are more limited, featuring 12–61 conserved genes. The conserved
genes in Chlorokybus mtDNA represent 41.4% of the total
genome sequence, a coding density lower than those
observed for Marchantia and Physcomitrella mtDNAs
(Table 1). Ranging from 7 to 11,340 bp, the intergenic
spacers in the Chlorokybus genome have an average size of
about 1,690 bp. Repeated elements populate these
regions, with the relative abundance of such elements in
the genome (7.5%) being similar to that observed in
Marchantia mtDNA (Table 1). With six group I introns
and 14 group II introns, the Chlorokybus mitochondrial
genome is richer in introns than its Mesostigma and Chaetosphaeridium counterparts (Table 1). All group I introns,
with a single exception, contain an open reading frame
(ORF), whereas only two group II introns feature an ORF
(Figure 1).

Chlorokybus and Mesostigma compared to their streptophyte counterparts (Table 2).

Gene content
The Chlorokybus mitochondrial genome encodes three
rRNAs, 28 tRNAs, 17 ribosomal proteins, 21 ATP synthase
and respiratory chain components and a protein involved
in the Sec-independent translocation pathway (MttB).
The 5S rRNA lacks the atypical insertion of 26–27 nucleotides observed in the variable loop B of its Mesostigma
counterpart [10]. As reported for all streptophyte mtDNAs
sequenced thus far, the set of encoded tRNA species is not
sufficient to decode all of the 61 codons identified in the
genome, owing to the absence of one or more species that
can recognize the ACR codons specifying threonine.

Potential functions could be assigned to the proteins specified by the seven intron ORFs in Chlorokybus mtDNA;
however, BLASTP searches using as queries the proteins
predicted from the ten free-standing ORFs larger than 100
codons [Genbank:EF463011] revealed no significant
sequence similarity with any previously reported proteins.
We found that the ORFs located within the atp9 and cox1
group II introns (orf845 and orf755, respectively) each
encode a retron-type reverse transcriptase/type II intron
maturase, whereas all five group I intron ORFs encode
putative LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases. The protein specified by the rnl intron ORF (orf170) carries a single copy of the LAGLIDADG motif, whereas the products
of the remaining group I intron ORFs (orf260, orf274,
orf296 and orf301) feature two copies of this motif. Endonuclease activity specific for the cognate intron insertion
site has been demonstrated for the homologues of three
Chlorokybus intron ORFs located in positionally homologous introns in chlorophyte organelle genomes, i.e. for ICsmI [34], I-CreI [35] and I-CpaII [36].

The nad10 and trnL(gag) genes have not been previously
identified in streptophyte mitochondria (Table 2); however, these genes have been reported in members of the
Prasinophyceae, the earliest-diverging class of chlorophyte algae. Both genes are present in Ostreococcus tauri
[32]; in addition, nad10 has been found in the prasinophyte Nephroselmis [30] and also in the cryptophyte alga
Rhodomonas salina [33]. The gene repertoire of Chlorokybus
is most similar to those of Mesostigma and Chaetosphaeridium (Table 2); in total, seven gene differences distinguish
the latter two algae from Chlorokybus. The mitochondrial
gene distribution among streptophytes highlights no specific alliance between Mesostigma and Chlorokybus, i.e.
there are no genes that are uniquely missing or present in

Genome organization
At the level of gene organization, the Chlorokybus mitochondrial genome differs remarkably from its Mesostigma
counterpart and unlike the latter displays significant sim-

ilarity with Chaetosphaeridium and Chara mtDNAs as well
as with the mitochondrial genomes of the bryophytes
Marchantia and Physcomitrella (Table 3). Only four of the
conserved genes in the Mesostigma genome are arranged in
the same order in the Chlorokybus genome, forming two
conserved gene clusters (rpl6-rps13 and rps12-rps7) that are
vestiges of operons found in the bacterial ancestors of
mitochondria. These two pairs of ribosomal protein genes
also entirely account for the conservation of gene order
observed between the Mesostigma genome and those of
Chaetosphaeridium, Marchantia and Physcomitrella.
In contrast, a total of 20 to 22 genes forming eight to ten
conserved gene clusters account for the conservation of
gene order observed between the Chlorokybus genome and
its homologues in the Coleochaetales, Charales and bryophytes (Table 3). In Figure 1 are highlighted the eight clusters that the Chlorokybus genome shares with its
homologue in the moss Physcomitrella. These conserved
clusters, which encode about one third of the genes common to these genomes (20/61), comprise six gene pairs,
one triplet and one quintuplet. All gene pairs, except rps2trnF(gaa), have been identified in the mtDNAs of chlorophytes [30,37] or other eukaryotes, including the mtDNA
of the heterotrophic jakobid flagellate Reclinomonas americana [38]. The two other clusters have been detected only
as fragments (sdh3-sdh4-nad4L, rps1-atp8 and atp8-atp4) in
these genomes.
The Chara genome is the charophycean green algal
mtDNA that most closely resembles its land plant counterparts, with more than 86% of the genes common to
Chara and the two investigated bryophytes being part of

conserved clusters. The smaller number of clusters identified in the Chara/Physcomitrella comparison (10 clusters)
versus the Chara/Marchantia comparison (16 clusters)
indicates that more rearrangements occurred in the lineage leading to the liverwort Marchantia than in that leading to Physcomitrella. Using GRIMM, we estimated that
only 12 inversions would be required to interconvert the
mitochondrial gene orders of Chara and Physcomitrella
(Table 3).
Introns
The six group I introns in Chlorokybus mtDNA reside in
cob, cox1 (sites 732, 879 and 1119), rns and rnl at the same
gene locations as structurally similar mitochondrial
introns previously reported in charophycean green algae
and bryophytes (Figure 2). Most of these introns have also
homologues in chlorophyte mtDNAs [30,31,37,39,40].
The Chlorokybus cox1 intron at site 732 has homologues
not only in Chara, Marchantia, chlorophytes and land
plants but also in fungi [20]. This is the insertion site of
the mobile intron that angiosperms acquired on multiple
occasions [41]. Like its land plant, fungal and chlorophyte
counterparts, the site-732 Chlorokybus cox1 intron encodes
a double LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease; however, it
shares no specific relationship with fungal introns. The
maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony
(MP) trees inferred from the site-732 cox1 intron
sequences of 15 green algal/land plant taxa and four fungi
(169 sites corresponding to the intron core) were congruent in showing that the Chlorokybus intron affiliates with
its Chara and Marchantia counterparts and that the resulting clade occupies a sister position relative to that contain-

cryptophyte alga Rhodomonas salina [33]. Unlike the
orf606 of its Oltmannsiellopis counterpart [31], the orf755
of the Chlorokybus cox1 intron can be aligned with the
entire Rhodomonas cox1 intron ORF (orf762). The majority
of introns in Chlorokybus tRNA genes are inserted two
nucleotides upstream of the anticodon; only the trnS(gcu)
and trnI(cau) introns represent notable exceptions.
Instead of being located in the anticodon loop, the insertion site of the trnS(gcu) intron lies within the anticodon
arm (six nucleotides upstream of the anticodon), whereas
that of the trnI(cau) intron occurs in the TψC arm. In this
context, it is interesting to mention that, in the chloroplast
genomes of land plants and charophycean green algae
belonging to the Charales, Coleochaetales and Zygnematales, a number of group II introns in tRNA genes are also
inserted two nucleotides upstream of the anticodon [11].
Only the streptophyte chloroplast introns found in
trnV(uac) occur at the same gene location as one of the
Chlorokybus mitochondrial group II introns. Despite this
positional homology, our sequence comparisons uncovered no specific relationship between the Chlorokybus
mitochondrial trnV(uac) intron and its chloroplast counterparts.

Four of the group II introns in Chlorokybus mtDNA lie in
protein-coding genes (atp9, cox1, cox2 and cox3), whereas
the remaining ten introns reside in tRNA genes (Figure 2).
Only two of these introns, those in trnG(ucc) and
trnS(gcu), are known to have homologues at identical
positions in the corresponding mitochondrial genes of
other charophycean green algae and/or land plants (Figure 2). In the case of the ORF-containing cox1 intron at
site 879, positional and structural homologues carrying a
similar ORF have been identified exclusively outside the
Streptophyta, i.e. in the chlorophyte Oltmannsiellopsis
viridis [31], the brown alga Pylaiella littoralis [42] and the

Repeated elements
As estimated with RepeatMasker, repeats represent 7.5%
of the Chlorokybus mitochondrial genome sequence (Table
1). Although there is a similar proportion of repeats in
Marchantia mtDNA, such sequences are less abundant in
the mitochondria of the moss Physcomitrella and the three
other charophycean green algal mitochondrial genomes
investigated to date (Table 1). The Chlorokybus repeats are
generally located in intergenic regions and comprise both
tandem and dispersed sequence elements.

In the case of the tandem repeats, 11 different repeat units
ranging from 4 to 28 bp in size and present in 2 to 39 copies per locus were identified (see Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 1 for a list of the tandem repeat units and
a description of their features). The tandem repeats made
up of units smaller than 11 bp are dispersed in the Chlorokybus genome, occurring at up to 249 distinct loci. With
regard to the dispersed repeats, 11 different units were
identified (see Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 2
for the sequences of the dispersed repeat units), with at
least two (AATGCA and GGGCTGC) being clearly related
to some of the repeat units constituting the tandem
repeats (ATGCA, TGCA, GGGCTGCACT and GGGCT).
The sizes of the units featured by the dispersed repeats
range from 6 to 8 bp and the numbers of perfectly identical copies vary from 29 to 520 (see Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 2 for the copy numbers of the dispersed
repeat units). In addition to the latter copies of dispersed
repeat units, we find a large number of copies carrying a
single mismatch in their sequences. Similar or distinct

repeat units often associate to form longer repeats, including stem-loop structures. None of the repeated units
reported here were found to be identical to those present
in the Chlorokybus chloroplast genome [13].
Phylogenetic analyses
To determine the phylogenetic position of Chlorokybus as
inferred from mitochondrial genomic data, we analyzed
an amino acid data set containing a total of 4,024 sites
using the ML method (Figure 3). This data set was derived
from 18 protein-coding genes common to the mtDNAs of
13 green algal/land plant taxa and three non-green algae.
As expected, ML analysis strongly supported the placement of Chlorokybus within the Streptophyta; however, the
precise relationship of this charophycean green alga with
Mesostigma could not be determined with confidence. The
best ML tree identified a weakly supported clade uniting
Chlorokybus and Mesostigma at the base of the Streptophyta. In alternative tree topologies, Mesostigma was
found either as sister to all streptophytes or before the
divergence of the Streptophyta and Chlorophyta. The
branch leading to Mesostigma is markedly longer than that
leading to Chlorokybus, suggesting that long-branch attraction artefacts are responsible for the positioning of the
former alga outside the Streptophyta. Consistent with this
notion, MP analysis, which is known to be more sensitive
to long-branch attraction [43], provided very strong support (93% bootstrap support) for Mesostigma representing

Discussion
Highly variable gene density in charophycean
mitochondrial genomes
The large size and spacious intergenic spacers of the Chlorokybus mitochondrial genome represent unusual traits. At
201,763 bp, this 70-gene encoding mtDNA is three- to
five-fold larger than the three other previously characterized charophycean genomes, all of which have approximately the same number of conserved genes (Table 1).
Moreover, it is about twice as large as its homologue carrying 57 conserved genes in the chlorophyte Pseudendoclonium akinetum (Ulvophyceae), the largest green algal
mitochondrial genome sequence reported so far [40].
With intergenic spacers accounting for 41% of its
sequence, Chlorokybus mtDNA is now also recognized as
the most loosely packed green algal mitochondrial
genome (Table 1). Of particular interest is the close resemblance of this charophycean genome with the mtDNA of
the bryophyte Marchantia with regards to size, gene content, gene density and abundance of repeats [21]. As is the
case for bryophytes, the intergenic sequences in Chlorokybus mtDNA have no recognizable homology to any
known sequences in public databases, suggesting that the
increased size of these regions is largely accounted for by
expansion of endogenous sequences. In angiosperms, a
significant fraction of the mtDNA size (Arabidopsis, 1.1%
[27]; sugar beet, 2.1% [24]; tobacco, 2.5% [26]; wheat,
3.0% [29]; rapeseed, 3.6% [23]; maize, 4.4% [28]; rice,
6.3% [25]) is accounted for by sequences derived from the
chloroplast genome. The important variation in gene density reported here thus indicates that mitochondrial
genome evolution in charophycean green algae is less uniform than previously thought. This unexpected finding
challenges current concepts that the mitochondrial
genome was constrained to remain compact during the
evolution of charophycean green algae and that this evolutionary pressure became relaxed when land plants
emerged [20]. Two waves of mitochondrial genome
expansion have been documented during land plant evolution: one coinciding with the transition from charophycean green algae to land plants and the other with the
emergence of angiosperms [20,44].

The prominent size and low gene density of the Chlorokybus genome sequence are compatible with two evolutionary scenarios. First, as suggested earlier [20], it is possible
that the mitochondrial genome of the last common ancestor of all streptophytes featured a very compact gene
organization such as those observed in the Mesostigma and
Chara genomes and that intergenic regions enlarged independently and convergently in the basal charophycean
lineage leading to Chlorokybus and the late-diverging strep-

tophyte lineage leading to bryophytes. Genome expansion in specific lineages has also been proposed to explain
the atypical mtDNA size and relatively low gene density
observed for the ulvophyte Pseudendoclonium [40]. In
agreement with this notion, the more compact 56,761-bp
mtDNA of Oltmannsiellopsis viridis [31], a representative of
a separate early-diverging lineage of the Ulvophyceae, falls
within the size range observed for members of the three
other chlorophyte classes [30,32,37,45]. Although the
abovementioned scenario for streptophyte mtDNA evolution is supported by the finding of densely packed mtDNAs in most investigated chlorophytes (see Table 1 in
reference [31]), other algae [33,42,46-49] and unicellular
eukaryotes from other lineages [50], the currently available distribution of gene density for charophycean mitochondrial genomes does not rule out the possibility that
the ancestral streptophyte mitochondrial genome was less
compact than previously assumed and that intergenic
spacers contracted independently in the lineages leading
to Mesostigma and Chara. If correct, this second evolutionary scenario predicts that the emergence of the earliest
diverging land plants was not necessarily accompanied
with a substantial gain of sequences. Mitochondrial
genome sequences from more charophycean green algae,
in particular from members of the Klebsormidiales, Zygnematales and additional lineages from the Coleochaetales will be required to fully understand the dynamics of
mitochondrial genome evolution in this algal group.
Contrasting evolutionary trends of the mitochondrial
genome in the Chlorokybus and Mesostigma lineages
Our recent analysis of three distinct sets of chloroplast
genome data (gene order, gene content and sequences of
concatenated genes) revealed that Chlorokybus is closely
related to Mesostigma [13]. In light of this close relationship, our finding that the Chlorokybus mitochondrial
genome differs considerably from its Mesostigma counterpart not only in gene density but also in gene order came
as a surprise. No specifically shared genomic features
could be identified in these charophycean mitochondrial
genomes. On the other hand, the substantial differences
in intron content displayed by Chlorokybus and Mesostigma
mtDNAs were anticipated considering that the variable
intron distributions previously reported for charophycean
algae and bryophytes are consistent with numerous gains
of lineage-specific introns by each genome (see Figure 2
and [20,22]). In this context, it should be mentioned that
the mobile group I introns found at site 2593 within the
Chlorokybus and Mesostigma rnl genes (Figure 2) cannot be
necessarily regarded as a shared character, as an homologous intron is present at the same location in Nephroselmis
mtDNA [30]. The presence of a large number of group II
introns in tRNA genes is unique to the Chlorokybus mitochondrial genome. Because eight of these ten tRNA
introns lie at the same site within the anticodon loop, it is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/137

possible that they arose through proliferation of a founding intron in the Chlorokybus lineage (perhaps the
trnG(ucc) intron that is also found in Chaetosphaeridium
mtDNA) and that they diverged substantially in sequence
following their insertion in different tRNA genes.
The Chlorokybus mitochondrial genome has retained
numerous ancestral characters at the gene content and
gene organizational levels. This genome is the most generich among the green algal mtDNAs sequenced thus far
and features two genes that have not been reported to be
mtDNA-encoded in streptophytes prior to our study
[nad10 and trnL(gag)], thus bringing to 75 the number of
genes making up the gene repertoire of the common
ancestor of all streptophytes (Table 2). Of these genes,
seven (rpl2, rps1, sdh3, sdh4, yejR, yejU and yejV) are not
found in the Chlorophyta. The mitochondrial genome
sequences currently available for chlorophytes suggest
that the gene repertoire of the common ancestor of these
algae was more limited and included 70 genes, only two
of which are not present in the Streptophyta [rnpB and
trnT(ugu)].
Like its bryophyte counterparts, the Chlorokybus mitochondrial genome has maintained several ancestral gene
clusters even though short repeated sequences and spacious intergenic regions increase opportunities for gene
rearrangements [44,51]. On the other hand, clear evidence that rearrangements affected a few ancestral clusters
comes from the observation that the Chlorokybus genome
has not preserved the eubacteria-like arrangement of the
ribosomal protein genes corresponding to the contiguous
S10, spc and α operons of Escherichia coli (the cluster corresponding to the 11-gene segment delimited by rps10
and rps11 in Marchantia) as well as the nad5-nad4-nad2
cluster, both of which are found in the Chaetosphaeridium,
Chara and the two bryophyte genomes. Interestingly,
some of the eight to ten clusters shared by Chlorokybus and
other streptophyte mtDNAs (Table 3) exhibit gene linkages [rps2-trnF(gga), trnP(ugg)-sdh3 and nd4L-trnY(gua)]
that have not been documented outside the Streptophyta,
suggesting that they arose very early during streptophyte
evolution.
Evidently, the Chlorokybus and Mesostigma mitochondrial
genomes were shaped by divergent forces acting at multiple levels. First, let us consider the gene content and more
particularly, the genes lost specifically in each of these
charophycean lineages. The Chlorokybus gene repertoire
lacks only one of the 65 genes present in Mesostigma mitochondria [trnR(acg)] and according to the gene distribution currently available for charophycean green algae and
bryophytes (Table 2), this gene was lost uniquely in the
Chlorokybus lineage. Aside from nad10 and trnL(gag), all
but one (rps8) of the four mitochondrial genes that are

Page 8 of 12

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:137

present in Chlorokybus but missing from Mesostigma represent gene losses unique to the Mesostigma lineage (Table
2). With respect to gene organization, the Mesostigma
mitochondrial genome shows even more differences with
its Chlorokybus homologue. In sharp contrast to all other
completely sequenced streptophyte mtDNAs, ancestral
gene clusters are virtually absent from Mesostigma mtDNA
(Table 3), implying that extensive gene rearrangements
took place in this charophycean lineage. In fact, gene shuffling events were so extensive that they disrupted the continuity of the nad3 gene within the two group II introns,
giving rise ultimately to the scattering of the three exons
and trans splicing of the introns at the RNA level [10].
Considering that gene rearrangements in organelle
genomes are often associated with repeated sequences
[44,51], the absence of such elements from Mesostigma
mtDNA might suggest that short repeats once existed as
integral components of the mitochondrial genome but
disappeared almost completely during streamlining of the
intergenic regions. Gene rearrangements are not the only
major, lineage-specific evolutionary events that marked
the Mesostigma genome. In parallel, the rate of mtDNA
sequence evolution accelerated in the Mesostigma lineage,
leading to difficulties in correctly positioning this alga in
mitochondrial phylogenomic trees (Figure 3).
The evolutionary pattern displayed by the Mesostigma
mitochondrial genome is in some ways reminiscent of the
'reduced derived' pattern described for the mtDNAs of the
chlorophyte green algae belonging to the Chlamydomonadales (Chlorophyceae) [39,52-54] as well as for the
mtDNA of the enigmatic chlorophyte Pedinomonas minor
[30]. The latter pattern is characterized by reduction of
both genome size and gene content and by acceleration of
primary sequence evolution [30,50]. The reduced derived
mtDNAs completely sequenced thus far vary from 15 to
25 kb in size (see Table 1 in reference [31]), encode 12 to
22 genes and display a number of derived characters at the
levels of their gene organization and structure. Clearly, the
sequence acceleration reported here for the tightly packed
Mesostigma mitochondrial genome is a genomic trait
shared by all reduced derived mtDNAs. But whether the
evolution of this trait was connected with events of
genome reduction and limited gene losses in the Mesostigma lineage remains unknown.

Conclusion
In uncovering remarkable differences in size and gene
organization between the 201,763-bp Chlorokybus mitochondrial genome and its 42,424-bp Mesostigma counterpart, the study reported here provides new insights into
mitochondrial genome evolution in the Streptophyta.
Before this study, the prevailing view was that the ancestral streptophyte mitochondrial genome resembled the
Mesostigma genome in being tightly packed with genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/137

and that this trait was shared with other charophycean
green algae. Our findings raise the possibility that the
mitochondrial genome of the last common ancestor of all
streptophytes bore resemblance to Chlorokybus and bryophyte mtDNAs with regard to size and gene density,
implying that the emergence of land plants was not necessarily associated with a substantial gain of intergenic
sequences. Mitochondrial genome sequences from a
broader range of charophycean green algae will be
required to determine whether the unusually large size of
the Chlorokybus genome reflects an ancestral or a derived
trait.

Methods
DNA cloning, sequencing and sequence analysis
Chlorokybus atmophyticus was obtained from the
Sammlung von Algenkulturen Göttingen (SAG 48.80)
and grown in medium C [55] under 12 h light/dark cycles.
A random clone library was prepared from 1500- to 2000bp fragments derived from a fraction containing both
chloroplast DNA and mtDNA using the pSMART-HCKan
(Lucigen Corporation, Middleton, WI) plasmid [20].
DNA templates were generated with the QIAprep 96 Miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Canada) and
sequenced as described previously [56]. Sequences were
edited and assembled using SEQUENCHER 4.2 (Gene
Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). Genomic regions not
represented in the clones analyzed were sequenced from
PCR-amplified fragments. The fully annotated mitochondrial genome sequence has been deposited in [Genbank:EF463011].

Genes and ORFs were identified as described previously
[57]. Introns were modelled according to the nomenclatures proposed for group I [58] and group II [59] introns.
Homologous introns were identified by BLASTN searches
[60] against the non-redundant database of National
Center for Biotechnology Information. Repeated
sequences were identified with REPuter 2.74 [61] using
the -f (forward) and -p (palindromic) options at minimum lengths of 30 bp and were classified with the Comparative Repeat Analysis program [62]. Number of copies
of each repeat unit was determined with FINDPATTERNS
of the Wisconsin package version 10.3 (Accelrys, San
Diego, CA, USA) or FUZZNUC in EMBOSS 2.9.0 [63].
Stem-loop structures and tandem repeats were identified
using PALINDROME and ETANDEM in EMBOSS 2.9.0,
respectively. Genomic regions containing non-overlapping repeated elements were identified with RepeatMasker [64] running under the WU-BLAST 2.0 [65] search
engine.
Analysis of genome rearrangements
A custom-built program (Patrick Charlebois, Claude Lemieux and Monique Turmel, unpublished data) was used to

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:137

identify the gene clusters that are conserved in selected
pairs of streptophyte mtDNAs. The numbers of gene permutations by inversions in pairwise mtDNA comparisons
were inferred using the GRIMM web server [66]. In these
analyses, the order of all genes/pseudogenes shared by
each mtDNA pair was investigated. In the pairwise comparisons involving Marchantia mtDNA, one copy of the
duplicated trnMf(cau) gene (the copy between atp4 and
rnl) as well as one copy of the duplicated trnY(gua) [the
copy between trnR(ucu) and trnR(acg)] were excluded
from the data set.

protein sequences was derived as described previously
[20] from all protein-coding genes shared by these
genomes. Phylogenetic analyses of the data set were carried out using ML and MP methods. ML trees were computed with PHYML 2.4.5 [67] under the WAG+Γ+I model
of amino acid substitutions and bootstrap support for
each node was calculated using 100 replicates. MP trees
were inferred using PROTPARS in PHYLIP 3.65 [68] and
confidence of branch points was assessed by bootstrap
percentages after 100 replications.

A data set of intron sequences inserted at site 732 within
the cox1 gene (169 sites corresponding to unambiguously
aligned regions of the intron core) was analyzed using ML
and MP methods. These analyses were performed with
PAUP*4.0b10 [69] using a uniform rate of substitutions
across sites. ML trees were inferred under the HKY model.
Bootstrap support was assessed after 100 replications.
