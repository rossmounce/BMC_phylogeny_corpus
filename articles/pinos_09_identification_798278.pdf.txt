Abstract
Background: The human Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) gene, located at 17p13.1, comprises, at least, two
different transcription units regulated by two different promoters. The first transcription unit begins with the exon 1
sequence and is responsible for the production of plasma SHBG by the hepatocytes, while the second begins with an
alternative exon 1 sequence, which replaces the exon 1 present in liver transcripts. Alternative exon 1 transcription and
translation has only been demonstrated in the testis of transgenic mice containing an 11-kb human SHBG transgene and
in the human testis. Our goal has been to further characterize the 5' end of the SHBG gene and analyze the presence of
the SHBG alternative transcripts in human prostate tissue and derived cell lines.
Results: Using a combination of in silico and in vitro studies, we have demonstrated that the SHBG gene, along with exon
1 and alternative exon 1 (renamed here exon 1A), contains four additional alternative first exons: the novel exons 1B,
1C, and 1E, and a previously identified exon 1N, which has been further characterized and renamed as exon 1D. We
have shown that these four alternative first exons are all spliced to the same 3' splice site of SHBG exon 2, and that exon
1A and the novel exon 1B can be spliced to exon 1. We have also demonstrated the presence of SHBG transcripts
beginning with exons 1B, 1C and 1D in prostate tissues and cell lines, as well as in several non-prostatic cell lines. Finally,
the alignment of the SHBG mammalian sequences revealed that, while exons 1C, 1D and 1E are very well conserved
phylogenetically through non-primate mammal species, exon 1B probably aroused in apes due to a single nucleotide
change that generated a new 5' splice site in exon 1B.
Conclusion: The identification of multiple transcription start sites (TSS) upstream of the annotated first exon of human
SHBG, and the detection of the alternative transcripts in human prostate, concur with the prediction of the ENCODE
(ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements) project, and suggest that the regulation of SHBG is much more complex than
previously reported.

Background

Methods

Sex hormone-binding globulin is a dimeric glycoprotein
that transports sex steroids in the blood and regulates
their access to target tissues [1]. Human SHBG gene is
localized in the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p13.1),
in a region characterized as hotspot for genetic recombination, gene amplification, and integration of foreign
genomes [2,3]. In humans, the SHBG gene is constituted
by a minimum of two different transcription units regulated by, at least, two different promoters [4]. The first
transcription unit is responsible for the production of
plasma SHBG by the hepatocytes, and begins with the
exon 1 sequence, which encodes for a leucine rich signal
secretion peptide. This transcription unit is regulated by
the promoter 1 sequence that contains several binding
sites for liver enriched transcription factors [4,5]. The second transcription unit begins with the alternative exon 1
sequence, which replaces the exon 1 present in the liver
SHBG transcripts, and is regulated by an alternative promoter sequence [4,6], that proved to be very active when
it was transfected in the GC2 mouse germ cell line [7]. The
alternative exon 1 is found approximately 1.9 kb
upstream of the exon 1 sequence, and does not contain an
ATG in frame with the SHBG nucleotide coding sequence.
It has been hypothesized that transcripts beginning with
the alternative exon 1 could potentially initiate translation in the first ATG in frame found in exon 2, which
encodes for the methionine 30 of the mature plasma protein [4,7].

Cell cultures
Human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC3, DU-145
and PZ-HPV7 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). LNCaP, PC3 and
DU-145 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium
(PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), containing 10%
fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories), and supplemented
with penicillin/streptomycin, sodium pyruvate and modified Eagle media with non-essential aminoacids as recommended. PZ-HPV-7 cells were grown in KeratinocyteSFM Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented
with 2.5 μg of EGF and 25 mg of bovine pituitary extract
(both from Invitrogen). The hepatocarcinoma cell line
HepG2 and the kidney carcinoma cell line Hek 293 were
also obtained from ATCC and were grown and maintained in DMEM (PAA laboratories) containing 10% fetal
calf serum, and also supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, sodium pyruvate and modified Eagle media
with non essential aminoacids.

The presence of SHBG mRNA has been demonstrated in
human liver, brain, cardiac myocytes, adrenal glands, testis, prostate, mammary glands, placenta, fallopian tube,
endometrium and granulose-lutein cells of the ovary [6,814]. However, transcription and translation of SHBG
alternative exon 1 have only been shown in the testis of
transgenic mice containing an 11-kb human SHBG transgene and in the human testis [6], resulting in a SHBG isoform that binds androgens and estradiol with high
affinity, and accumulates in the acrosome of developing
sperm [4].

Bioinformatics
Using FirstEF: first exon and promoter prediction program
for human DNA http://rulai.cshl.edu/tools/FirstEF/[19],
we analyzed 900 nucleotides of the genomic sequence
upstream of the characterized alternative exon 1 TSS, in
order to identify potential SHBG 5' exons. To recognize
potential exonic splicing enhancers of SHBG 5'exons, we
used the combination of the following programs: RegRNA
http://regrna.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/, ESEfinder 3.0 http://
rulai.cshl.edu/tools/ESE/[20], and RESCUE-ESE http://
genes.mit.edu/burgelab/rescue-ese[21]. To predict SHBG
5' exons secondary structure we used the MFOLD program
http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/mfold-sim
ple.html[22].

In the prostate, the presence of SHBG mRNA and protein
has been described in epithelial and stromal cells [15,16].
However, the transcription unit responsible for the synthesis of these SHBG mRNAs has not been characterized
and it is unknown whether the protein found in the
human prostatic tissues is translated locally or results
from extravascularization of the liver secreted protein, as
described in other tissues [17]. Our goal in the present
study has been to identify novel SHBG TSSs since, as indicated by the ENCODE project, about two-thirds of the
genes in the 1% of the analyzed human genome had
unannotated 5' extensions [18], and determine which
SHBG transcription units are active in human prostate.

Human prostate samples
Human prostate samples were obtained from the nontumoral tissue of patients with prostate carcinoma at the
T2/T3N0M0 stage, submitted to radical prostatectomy.
The informed consent was obtained in all cases, in keeping with Institutional Ethics Committee requirements.
The histology of the prostate specimens was evaluated by
the urological pathologist (Dr. de Torres).

5' Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)
5'RACE was performed using the FirstChoice® RLM (RNA
Ligase Mediated)-RACE Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) with 10
μg of total RNA from DU-145 and LNCaP cells as template, and reverse primers complementary to the fifth (5'
TGAGATCTCGGCCTGTTTGTC 3') and third (5'
AGGCCTGCCGTCTCGAAGTCCC 3' for nested PCR)
exon of SHBG gene. First round of PCR amplification consisted of 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 20 sec,
annealing at 59°C for 30 sec, and extension at 72°C for

45 sec. Nested PCR amplification was performed at the
same conditions for 36 cycles. PCR products were cloned
into the pCR®2.1-TOPO using the TOPO TA Cloning® kit
(Invitrogen). The inserts were amplified by PCR, purified
with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and
sequenced using an ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Wellesley, MA).
Identification of orthologous SHBG first exons in different
species
To identify the orthologous sequences of alternative
human SHBG first exons, we used the blastn, discontiguous megablast and megablast web interfaces of NCBI
(expected threshold: 10; match/mismatch scores: 2,-3;
gap costs: existence 5 extension 2), the NCBI Trace Archive
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi? and the
UCSC Genome Browser http://genome.ucsc.edu/, and
searched through the following database entries:Pan troglodytes [GenBank: NW_001226908.1] and NBCI trace id

RNA extraction, RT-PCR and Real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from LNCaP, PC3, PZ-HPV7,
HepG2 and Hek 293 cell lines, and from human prostate
tissue samples, using the RNeasy Mini/Midi Kit 50 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA from rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines CW 9019 and RH 30, and from the
neuroblastoma cell line imr 32, was kindly provided by
Dr. Josep Roma, and total RNA from the breast cancer cell
lines MDA-MB 468, BT 474 and T47D was kindly provided by Dr. Maurizio Scaltriti. Two μg of RNA from each
sample were reverse transcribed using Superscript II H(Invitrogen), at 42°C for 50 min. One μl of the resulting
cDNA was amplified in a 25 μl reaction in the presence of
Taq polymerase (Ecogen, Barcelona, Spain) or TaKaRa LA
Taq™ (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). The PCR amplification was performed in non-saturating conditions using
the primer pairs described in Table 1. Each PCR was performed in triplicate. The PCR products were resolved by
electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and purified, cloned
and sequenced as described above.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/59

For real-time PCR, one μl of the cDNA was amplified in a
20 μl reaction using Quantitect™ SYBR® Green PCR kit
(Qiagen), with forward primers that recognized exons 1A,
1B, 1C and 1D and a common reverse primer for exon 3
(Table 1). The reactions were performed in triplicate,
using the universal thermal cycling parameters (Applied
Biosystems). Data were calculated as the means ± SE, for
each SHBG alternative exon. The relative expression levels
were calculated in relation to the levels of alternative exon
1A, according to the formula 2 -ΔCT, where ΔCT is the difference in threshold cycle (CT) values between the target
and the internal control (S18 gene) using one-way
ANOVA.P values < 0.05 were considered significant.

Results
"In silico" identification of an additional SHBG first exon
With the use of the FirstEF program, three potential first
exons were predicted in the genomic sequence -858/+132
respective to the described alternative exon 1 TSS [23]:
one in the negative strand of the chromosome 17
(7471406–7471590), with a genomic size of 185 nucleotides and a predicted exon probability of 0.982, that corresponded to the second exon of the SAT2 gene (exon
prediction 1); and two in the positive strand in the same
orientation of the SHBG gene (Figure 1A). Of the two predicted exons in the positive strand, one corresponded to
the previously described alternative exon 1 (Figure 1A,
exon prediction 2) [9,23], localized on the chromosome
17 genomic sequence 7471905–7472194, and with a predicted exon probability of 0.982; and the other corresponded to a putative previously non described SHBG
first exon of 65 nucleotides in length, situated at -278/343 respective to the alternative exon 1 TSS, and localized
on the chromosome 17 genomic sequence 7471760–
7471824 (Figure 1A, exon prediction 3). The predicted 3'
end of this exon is perfectly defined by the consensus 5'
splice site CTG/gtaagt (Figure 1B). According to the
FirstEF program, the novel potential SHBG first exon is
contained in a CpG island of 202 nucleotides in length
localized on the chromosome 17 genomic sequence
7471654–7471855 (Figure 1A). We named this novel
putative SHBG first exon, exon 1B, and therefore we
renamed the SHBG alternative exon 1 as exon 1A.

In order to find out if exon 1B is expressed in prostate tissues and cell lines, we performed a PCR with a forward
primer corresponding to the beginning of the predicted
exon 1B (Figure 1B, primer ii), and a reverse primer of
exon 8. Using the cDNA obtained from the LNCaP cell
line and from human prostate samples, we amplified a
major band of approximately 1200 bp (Figure 1C), which
once cloned and sequenced, corresponded to the predicted exon 1B sequence followed by exons 2–3–4–5–6–
7–8. The analysis of the sequence showed that all the

exon-exon junctions resulted from splicing of consensus
splice sites and that exon 1B transcripts used the same 3'
splice site of exon 2 as exon 1 and exon 1A transcripts.
Aiming to determine whether exon 1B TSS was localized
further 5' upstream of the sequence predicted by the FirstEF
program, we designed three additional forward primers of
exon 1B, situated -90, -70 and -39 nucleotides from the predicted exon 1B start site and performed PCR amplification
using a reverse primer against exon 3 and cDNA from the
LNCaP cell line. Using the primer situated -39 nucleotides
from exon 1B predicted start site (Figure 1B, primer i), we
obtained a major PCR product (Figure 1D), which, once
sequenced, consisted of a 39 nucleotide extension of the
exon 1B in its 5' end, followed by exons 2–3. This data
allowed us to extend the exon 1B sequence to the nucleotide 7471721 of the chromosome 17, resulting for a characterized exon of 104 nucleotides in length (Table 2).
To provide further evidence of the exon 1B expression, we
analyzed the databases from other species and identified

two mRNA sequences, one in Macaca fascicularis [GenBank: AB169062], and one in Macaca mulatta [GenBank:
XR_013781.1]. The Macaca fascicularis mRNA sequence
derived from a testis cDNA library and included an orthologous sequence of 36 nucleotides located upstream of the
5'splice site of the human exon 1B, and the Macaca
mulatta mRNA sequence included the orthologous 21
nucleotides upstream of the 5'splice site in humans. Furthermore, in both Macaca mRNAs, the human 5' splice
site was not found due to the presence of a GG sequence
instead of the GT donor nucleotides of the human
sequence, and therefore exon 1B and exon 1A are present
in these mRNAs as one unique exon (Figure 1E).
Identification of additional SHBG first exons using 5'RLMRACE
To further characterize the 5' end of the SHBG gene, we
used the FirstChoice® RLM-RACE kit to identify 5'capped
SHBG transcripts from total RNA of the DU-145 and
LNCaP cell lines. To perform the first round of the 5'
RACE, we used a forward outer primer that recognized the

adapter sequence linked to the 5' end of capped mRNAs,
and a reverse primer against exon 5 (Figure 2A). Nested
PCR was performed using a forward inner primer of the
adapter sequence and a reverse primer recognizing exon 3
(Figure 2A). In the DU-145 cell line, the two rounds of
amplification resulted in one major product of 300 nucleotides approximately (Figure 2B), that, after cloning and
sequencing, corresponded to two different and novel
SHBG mRNAs. One RACE product (Figure 2C, RACEfrag
1; 311 nucleotides) contained a novel SHBG first exon of
107 nucleotides followed by exons 2–3, and the other
RACE product (Figure 2C, RACEfrag 2; 279 nucleotides)
consisted of a different and novel first exon of 75 nucleotides, also followed by exons 2–3. In the LNCaP cell line,
the two rounds of amplification resulted also in one
major band of 300 nucleotides approximately (Figure
2D), that after cloning and sequencing, corresponded to
two different transcript sequences of 289 and 341 nucleotides (Figure 2E, RACEfrags 3 and 4). Both transcripts
include an alternative SHBG first exon previously introduced in the public databases by Kahn and collaborators
as exon 1N [GenBank: EU352656], followed by exons 2
and 3. However, these two RACEfrags contain two different TSS in their 5' end, resulting in an exon of 137 nucleotides when TSS 1 (Chr 17: 7458018) is used, and an exon
of 87 nucleotides when the transcription starts at TSS 2
(Chr 17: 7458070) (Figure 3A). These sequences are also
27 and 79 nucleotides shorter than the sequence of the
exon 1N (164 nucleotides), as the TSS of the later was
located at the nucleotide 7457989 of the chromosome 17.
Even so, the two variants of the alternative first exon
found in the RACEfrags 3 and 4 and the exon 1N share the
same 3' end and the same 5'splice site (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the 5' end of exon 1N partially overlaps with the
sequence of the novel first exon identified in the RACEfrag

2 (Figure 3A). However, based on our 5'RACE data, the
TSS found in the RACEfrag 2, although it is localized further 5'upstream of the TSS described for exon 1N, does
not extend the 1N sequence in the 5' end because it uses a
different 5' splice site, and, therefore, generates a different
5' exon (Figure 3A).
Since we have obtained three different alternative first
exons in four different RACEfrags, we have named them
following their 3' to 5' position in the positive strand of
the chromosome 17: exon 1C (RACEfrag 1), exon 1D
(RACEfrags 3 and 4) and exon 1E (RACEfrag 2). Exon 1C
is found in the chromosome 17 genomic sequence
7471362–7471468, 253 nucleotides upstream of the
characterized exon 1B 5' end; exon 1D (previously called
exon 1N) is located in the chromosome 17 sequence
7458018/070–7458154, 13.35 kilobases upstream of
exon 1C 5' end; and finally, exon 1E is situated just 13
nucleotides upstream from exon 1D TSS (Figure 3B, Figure 4 and Table 2). The analysis of the exon-exon junctions of all RACEfrags sequences, indicated that exons 1C,
1D and 1E were all spliced to exon 2 using the same 3'
splice site as exons 1, 1A and 1B (Figure 3C). A complete
overview of the characteristics of the different SHBG alternative first exons is illustrated in Table 2.
Phylogenetic comparison of the SHBG alternative first
exons
A search in public databases has led to the identification
of the orthologous sequence of exon 1A in the following
placental mammals: Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee), Gorilla

E) The cloning of the major band generated RACEfrag 3 and RACEfrag 4 products. Insert and M13 flanking sequence size are

comparison of apes and Old World monkey sequences
showed a 100% sequence identity between humans and
chimpanzees, and a calculated 97% sequence identity
between humans, orangutans, baboons and rhesus
macaques. However, a much less homology is found
between humans and horses (calculated sequence identity
of 51%); humans and dogs (49%) and humans and mice
(44%). The 5'splice site is only conserved in apes and Old
World monkeys.
The alignment of the human exon 1B sequence with the
sequences of Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus,
Papio hamadryas, Macaca mulatta, Equus caballus, Oryctolagus cuniculus (rabbit), and Mus musculus showed a 96%
sequence identity between humans and chimpanzees,
and a 88–83% sequence identity between humans, gorillas, baboons and rhesus macaques (Figure 5B). Much less
homology was found between humans and horses (51%),
humans and rabbits (37%) and humans and mice (39%).
Exon 1B 5' splice site is only conserved in humans, chim-

panzees, gorillas and orangutans, and is not found in the
Old World monkeys baboons and rhesus macaques, and
neither in horses, rabbits and mice (Figure 5B).
The alignment of the human exon 1C sequence with the
orthologous sequences of Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus,
Papio hamadryas, Macaca mulatta, Equus caballus, Sus scrofa
(pig), Bos taurus (bovine), Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus (rat) showed a 100% sequence identity with chimpanzees, 90% with orangutans, 95% with baboons, and
96% with rhesus macaques (Figure 6A). There is also a
high sequence identity with horses (86%), bovines
(79%), pigs (78%), mice (69%) and rats (71%). Therefore, and in contrast to exons 1A and 1B, exon 1C is not
only conserved in apes and Old World monkeys, but in
horses and pigs. However, it is not conserved in cows,
mice and rats.

the different SHBG transcription units in prostate tissues
and prostate cancer cell lines, we performed RT-PCR using
specific forward primers for each of the alternative first
exons, as well as an exon 3 forward primer, to determine
the global SHBG expression.

Activity of the SHBG transcription units in human prostate

has been previously reported [15,16], none of these studies took into account the nature of the transcription unit

The analysis of cell lines using a specific exon 3 forward
primer, showed that all the prostate cell lines analyzed
expressed SHBG, with LNCaP and PZ-HPV-7 cells presenting higher relative amounts of total SHBG mRNA comPage 9 of 17

contrary, when the exon 1A upper primer was used, the

cancer cell lines (Figure 7A). As in the case of exon 3 forward primer, the use of exon 1D forward primer showed
that the relative amounts of this transcript were higher in

the 5' consensus splice sites of both first exons and the
consensus 3' splice site of exon 2 were used (Figure 3C).
However, when exons 1A or 1B were spliced to exon 1
(Figure 7A, band β), although the 5' consensus splice sites
of exon 1A and 1B were the same, two different 3' splice
sites of exon 1 were used, that we named a and b (Figure
7D). While exon 1A was found to be spliced only to the 3'
splice site b, exon 1B was alternatively spliced to both a
and b splice sites (Figure 7D). Additionally, it was also
observed that when exon 1A primers were used, a lowerthan-expected band was detected (Figure 7A; γ band), that
once sequenced corresponded to SHBG transcripts were
exon 1A was spliced to exon 2 and exon 4 was skipped.
Using exon 1D primers, a lower-than-expected band was
also observed, but in this case, its sequence determined
that it corresponded to an unspecific RT-PCR product. No
SHBG sequences with non-canonical 5' and 3' consensus
splice sites were obtained in any case.
When the activity of the different SHBG transcription
units was analyzed in prostate samples, we detected the
presence of the ones containing exon 1, 1A, 1B, 1C and
1D in all the samples analyzed (Figure 7B), but exon 1E
transcripts were not amplified with RT-PCR. As in the case
of the prostate cancer cell lines, upper-than-expected RTPCR bands were detected (Figure 7B, β band) that, once
sequenced, corresponded to specific SHBG transcripts
whose exon 1A and 1B sequences were followed by the
exon 1 sequence using the 3' splice sites a and b (Figure
7D). In the case of exon 1B transcripts, two different β
bands were observed (Figure 7B; β1 and β2 bands) corresponding to the use of the 3' splice sites a (β1) and b (β2).
To determine whether transcription of these novel SHBG
isoforms was restricted to prostate, human non-prostatic
cell lines were analyzed by RT-PCR. The results revealed
that transcripts containing exon 1B were present in cell
lines derived from cervix carcinoma (HeLa), rhabdomyosarcoma (CW 9019 and RH 30), and breast cancer
(MDA-MB 468, T47D, and BT 474) (Figure 7C), but were
almost undetectable in the hepatocarcinoma cell line
HepG2, in the kidney cell line Hek 293, and in the neuroblastoma cell line imr 32 (Figure 7C). As in the case of
prostate cell lines and tissues, the upper-than-expected
band corresponding to transcripts where exon 1B is followed by the exon 1 sequence, was also detected in the RH
30, HeLa and HepG2 cell lines. Specifically, in the RH 30
cell line, transcripts containing exon 1B-exon 1 were more
abundant than exon 1B-exon 2 transcripts (Figure 7C).
The transcription unit containing exon 1C was identified
in HeLa, HepG2, Hek 293, CW 9019, RH 30 and imr 32
cells, but no detectable levels were found in any of the
breast cancer cell lines analyzed (Figure 7C). Furthermore,
in cell lines where levels of exon 1C SHBG mRNA were
higher (CW 9019 and imr 32; Figure 7A), full length exon

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/59

1C transcript sequence was detected by nested PCR, using
primers directed against exons 1C – 8 for the first round,
and exons 1C – 5 for the second round (Figure 8A). The
major product found in the first round (1.2 kb), coincided
with the expected size of the full-length transcript from
exon 1C to exon 8 (Figure 8B). The 1.2 kb PCR band from
both cell lines were excised from the gel, purified and
pooled to use it as template DNA for the second round
PCR. Direct sequencing of the second round PCR product
demonstrated that the 635 nucleotide sequence contained
the exon 1C followed by exons 2, 3, 4 and 5 (Figure 8C).
Finally, the transcription unit of exon 1D was detected in
all cell lines analyzed, but very few levels were found in
the imr 32 and MDA-MB 468 cells (Figure 7C). The fulllength of transcripts beginning with exon 1D has been
previously reported by Kahn and collaborators as exon 1N
SHBG transcript [GenBank: EU352670].
The analysis of the relative abundance of the alternative
1B, 1C and 1D transcripts compared to 1A in LNCaP, PC3
and PZ-HPV7 prostate cell lines as well as in HeLa cells by
real-time PCR showed that the levels of exon 1B transcript
were significantly higher in PC3 and PZ-HPV7 cells, and
of exon 1D transcript in PZ-HPV7 cells (see Additional file
1).

Discussion
Recent reports in the framework of the ENCODE Project
indicated that more than two thirds of the interrogated
genes present additional TSSs upstream of their annotated
first exons [18]. The analysis of 44 regions totaling 30 Mb
or 1% of the human genome sequence showed that there
is a coding protein gene every 62 kb, and that the novel
TSSs often mapped upstream loci, since the newly identified TSSs localized on average 186 kb upstream of the
most 5' annotated exons [18,24]. Additionally, an increasing number of reports indicate that many eukaryotic genes
possess multiple transcriptional promoters associated
with alternative first exons [25-28]. In this context, we
decided to characterize the 5' end of the human SHBG
gene.
In chromosome 17, where SHBG is localized, alternative
splicing has been described to occur extensively, with an
average of 5 transcripts per gene, and it has also been
shown that in this chromosome, 76.6% of the genes display, at least, two transcripts [29]. In the present study, we
have used in silico and in vitro approaches in order to identify novel 5' SHBG alternative first exons. Using the FirstEF
program we identified a potential novel SHBG first exon
in the positive strand of chromosome 17, situated -278
nucleotides upstream of the TSS of the SHBG alternative
exon 1. We named this potential novel SHBG first exon,
exon 1B, and therefore we renamed the previously
described alternative exon 1 [23] as exon 1A. Using RT-

PCR, we confirmed the presence of SHBG exon 1B transcripts in prostate tissues and cell lines. The length of exon
1B was 104 nucleotides (7471721–7471824), but a 5'
extension can not be excluded, since its TSS has not been
identified yet. Exon 1B overlaps with the nucleotides 169–
66 of the 5'UTR sequence of the SAT2 gene [GenBank:
NM_133491.2]. As the SAT2 gene is situated in the negative strand of the chromosome 17, SHBG and SAT2 genes
would produce natural sense-antisense pair transcripts
that overlap head to head. Moreover, the analysis of the
SHBG 5'genomic sequence with the FirstEF program indicates that exon 1B is contained in a CpG island of 202
nucleotides of length (7471655–7471855). In this regard,
it has been estimated that over 20% of human transcripts
might form sense-antisense pairs [30] and also that CpG
island promoter regions are commonly associated with
bidirectional promoter activity (approximately 15% of
the imprinted genes have associated antisense transcripts)
[31,32]. One example is the Gabpa-Atp5j genes in mouse,
which contain two over-lapping promoters in each direc-

tion [33]. When this condition occurs in yeast and bacteria, there is potential for transcriptional interference [34],
and it has also been postulated that, in these CpG bidirectional promoters, the activity of one promoter might
influence the epigenetic state of the other [33].
Using 5'RLM-RACE with cDNA obtained from DU-145
and LNCaP cells, we identified two additional SHBG first
exons that were named exons 1C and 1E, and two different sequences corresponding to the previously described
exon 1N. These two sequences resulted from two different
TSSs, generating exon sequences 27 and 79 nucleotides
shorter than exon 1N. We renamed these exon sequences
as exon 1D.
Exon 1C has a length of 107 nucleotides and is localized
253 nucleotides upstream of exon 1B. As in the case of
exon 1B, it also overlaps with the SAT 2 gene, specifically
with the complete coding sequence of exon 3 and with 44
and 10 nucleotides of intron 3 and intron 2 respectively.

The TSS identified by 5'RACE, with T as the nucleotide +1,
is displaced just one nucleotide from a consensus Inr element or Cap motif (pyrimidine, pyrimidine, A(+1), N, T/
A, pyrimidine, pyrimidine, where N is any nucleotide)[33]. Exon 1D has a length of 137 or 85 nucleotides,
depending on which TSS is used, and is localized 13.35
kilobases 5' upstream of exon 1 TSS. Exon 1E has a length
of 75 nucleotides and its 3' end is situated only 13 nucleotides upstream of the TSS1 of exon 1D. It overlaps with
the intron 1 sequence of the FXR2 gene [GenBank:
NM_004860.2], situated also in the negative strand. This
overlap was previously described in rat chromosome 10,
where a GC rich sequence in the alternative promoter of
rat SHBG overlapped with the 5' UTR of the FXR2 gene
[35]. These and our results, suggest that the 5' end of the
SAT2 and FXR2 genes present a broad range of TSSs in the
opposite strand, corresponding to the SHBG gene.
TATA boxes have been described to be six-fold more common in genes with single promoters than in genes with
alternative promoters, and it has been suggested that
strong TATA boxes might be incompatible with alternative
promoters [36]. However, in exon 1E there is a TATAA
sequence situated 30 nucleotides upstream from the TSS1
of exon 1D, probably regulating its transcription initiation. TATA-box directed transcription is normally associated with a sharply defined TSS situated 30–31
downstream from the TATA sequence. In contrast, TATAindependent promoters normally present a much broad
distribution of TSSs [33], suggesting that exons 1B, 1C and
1E might present additional TSSs than the ones presented
here. Furthermore, while TATA-box promoters are normally associated with tightly regulated transcripts with a
strong bias toward postnatal activity [33,36], broad TSS
promoters and CpG promoters are associated with ubiquitous transcripts, and, in the case of genes with alternative promoters, with a weak bias toward prenatal
transcription [33,36]. These data suggests a differential
usage of the SHBG alternative promoters through different stages of development.
The full-length of transcripts beginning with exon 1B and
1C has been demonstrated. In the case of exon 1C transcript, although the size of the product of the first round
PCR suggests that exons 6 and 7 are included in the fulllength transcript, it has only been possible to sequence it
from exon 1C to exon 5.
We have shown the presence of exon 1B, 1C and 1D transcripts in prostate cell lines and tissues as well as in several
non-prostatic cell lines. These results support that the
activity of these different transcription units is not
restricted to prostate, as it would be expected for 1B and
1C transcripts, since their promoters do not contain a
TATA sequence. As for the 1D transcripts, the activity of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/59

the putative TATA promoter remains to be proven. With
regard to the relative abundance of the alternative transcripts, real-time PCR assays showed that the highest levels corresponded to the exon 1B transcript in the four cell
lines analyzed. Although differences in primer efficiency
could not be completely excluded, it would be interesting
in the future to elucidate the meaning of these variations.
All the SHBG exons identified by 5'RACE in this study are
very well defined in their 3' end by consensus splice sites
sequences (AG/GTRAGT), and they are all spliced directly
to the 3'splice site of exon 2, as it was previously described
for SHBG exon 1 and exon 1A [9]. However, when RTPCR was performed in prostate cancer cell lines and prostate tissues using specific primers for exons 1A and 1B,
two different 3'splice sites of exon 1 were used, a and b,
both presenting a consensus -AG/G sequence for U2AF65
protein binding, but lacking a clear polypyrimidine tract
and branch point. None of this alternative first exons contain in their sequence an ATG in frame with the SHBG
coding sequence, suggesting that they act as 5' UTR
sequences regulating the translation efficiency from the
first ATG in frame of exon 2, which encodes the methionine 30 of the transcripts that begin with exon 1. In this
regard, it has been reported that stable mRNA secondary
structures in the 5'UTR region (≥-35 kcal/mol) can
decrease considerably the translation efficiency by affecting ribosomal recruitment and positioning at the initiation codon [37]. The MFOLD program served us to predict
a hairpin stability ≥-40 kcal/mol for exons 1A, 1B, 1C and
1D (TSS1), and -35,8 kcal/mol for exon 1E, supporting
that the secondary structure of the different alternative
first exons could affect translation efficiency.
The functional significance of these novel alternative
SHBG transcription units will rely on the demonstration
of their protein coding capacity or of their action as natural antisense transcripts of genes located on the opposite
DNA strand. We tested the former possibility by using different antibodies against SHBG, and detected bands of the
expected size in human prostate samples but not in prostate cancer cell lines by Western blot analysis (data not
shown). Our preliminary data of transient transfection
experiments of different alternative SHBG full-length constructs showed that these transcripts are indeed translated,
but their translation efficiency are negatively regulated
depending on each specific 5'UTR sequence, as predicted
by the MFOLD program. Further studies are required to
fully assess and understand the contribution of the use of
these alternative transcripts and their probable alternative
promoters to regulate transcription and translation, as it
has already been demonstrated for other genes [28]. As for
the second possible action, the discovery of novel 5'SHBG
exons that overlap with the SAT 2 and FXR 2 sequences
(exons 1B, 1C, 1D and 1E) suggests that SHBG-SAT 2 and

SHBG-FXR 2 genes might be mutually regulated by transcriptional interference.
The phylogenetic comparison of the human SHBG alternative first exons with different vertebrate mammalian
species showed that exons 1C, 1D and 1E are highly conserved across the species, but exon 1A and specially exon
1B, are by far less conserved. The variation in the degree of
conservation of the different SHBG alternative first exons
parallels the degree of conservation of their 5' splice sites:
while the 5'splice site of exons 1A and 1B are only conserved within primate species, the ones of exons 1C, 1D
and 1E are conserved in primate and non-primate species.
These data suggest that 1A and 1B are recently evolved
exons, with higher evolutionary turnover rate, especially
exon 1B, which was created about 25 million years ago,
when apes diverged from Old World monkeys.
The estimation of the total number of human proteincoding genes falls between 20000–25000 [38,39],
whereas those of simpler organisms as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans are not much lower,
with 13000 and 18000 genes respectively [38]. It was
hypothesized that functional diversity of this limited
number of genes is necessary to create the highly elaborated systems necessary for mammalian live [38]. Alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage are welldescribed mechanisms that produce an elevated number
of protein-coding and non-coding transcripts from a single gene locus. In the framework of the ENCODE project
it was observed that 86% of the interrogated multi-exon
gene loci in the ENCODE regions presented alternative
splicing generating > 5.4 transcripts per gene [18]. Our
analysis showed that, at least, one additional transcription
unit (exon 1B) aroused in apes, due to a single nucleotide
change that generated a new 5' splice site in exon 1B.

Conclusion
In the present study, we have identified three novel alternative SHBG first exons (exons 1B, 1C and 1E), and further
characterized an alternative SHBG first exon previously
introduced in the public databases (exon 1D). We have also
demonstrated the activity of the transcription units containing exons 1B, 1C and 1D in human prostate tissues and
prostatic and non-prostatic cell lines. In view of these
results, it will be necessary to determine the significance of
these alternative TSSs in terms of regulation of expression
of SHBG or overlapping genes on the opposite strand.
Additionally, it would be interesting, in the future, to ascertain whether the appearance of a SHBG alternative transcript in humans confers any evolutionary advantage.
