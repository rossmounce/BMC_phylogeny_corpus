Abstract
Background: The A3243G mutation in the tRNALeu gene (UUR), is one of the most common
pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in France, and is associated with highly
variable and heterogeneous disease phenotypes. To define the relationships between the A3243G
mutation and mtDNA backgrounds, we determined the haplogroup affiliation of 142 unrelated
French patients – diagnosed as carriers of the A3243G mutation – by control-region sequencing
and RFLP survey of their mtDNAs.
Results: The analysis revealed 111 different haplotypes encompassing all European haplogroups,
indicating that the 3243 site might be a mutational hot spot. However, contrary to previous

findings, we observed a statistically significant underepresentation of the A3243G mutation on
haplogroup J in patients (p = 0.01, OR = 0.26, C.I. 95%: 0.08–0.83), suggesting that might be due to
a strong negative selection at the embryo or germ line stages.
Conclusion: Thus, our study supports the existence of mutational hotspot on mtDNA and a
"haplogroup J paradox," a haplogroup that may increase the expression of mtDNA pathogenic
mutations, but also be beneficial in certain environmental contexts.

Background
The mitochondrion is unique in that its bioenergetic and
biosynthetic systems are assembled from two different
information storage and retrieval systems: the nuclearcytosolic system, expressing nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial genes, and the mitochondrial system, expressing mitochondrial DNA-encoded genes. Maternally
inherited, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes the 12S
and 16S mitochondrial rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13
polypeptides, which form essential subunits of OXPHOS
enzyme complexes [1,2].
Over the past twenty years, genetic variations in mtDNA
have been linked to a number of multifactorial diseases
and aging [3], however, a large number of mutations were
considered neutral and used to define haplogroups in
order to investigate human origins [4], migrations, and
demographic events [5]. Indeed, human populations can
be divided into several mtDNA haplogroups on the basis
of specific nucleotid polymorphisms scattered throughout
the mitochondrial genome, reflecting mutation events
accumulated over time by a discrete maternal lineage.
Thus, for example, 95% of Europeans belong to 10 major
haplogroups [6] while 100% of Native Americans belong
to 5 major haplogroups [7,8].
Several recent studies have pointed out the possible
impact of haplogroups on mitochondrial physiology.
Indeed, Ruiz-Pesini et al. [9] revealed a possible impact of
haplogroups on the oxidative phosphorylation activity
that facilitates human adaptation to colder climates,
resulting in regional enrichment of specific mtDNA lineages (haplogroups). Moreover, haplogroups have been
shown to play a role in the phenotypic expression of diseases [10]. Indeed, a link has been observed between haplogroups and various disorders and phenotypes; for
example, the haplogroup may influence the disease
expression of a mitochondrial pathogenic mutation, such
as T14484C and G11778A, found in Leber hereditary
optic neuropathy (LHON) [11-15].
The A3243G mutation [16-18] on the tRNALeu gene
(UUR) is one of the most common mitochondrial DNA
mutations worldwide and in France (unpublished data
from the French mitochondrial disease network). The
phenotypic expression of this mutation is quite variable,

ranging from mild to severe clinical phenotypes. Indeed,
while mtDNA the A3243G mutation is usually associated
with the MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy,
encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes:
MIM 540000) or MIDD (maternally inherited diabetes
and deafness: MIM 520000) [19]. This mutation is also
found in patients without any typical symptoms, but who
had clinical manifestations ranging from a mixture of
chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia symptoms,
to strokelike episodes, cardiomyopathy, and progressive
kidney disease [20-23].
Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to
explain the phenotypic expression of this mutation, such
as a reduced association of mRNA with ribosomes, possibly due to the tRNALeu (UUR) aminoacylation defect
[24]. However, Kirino et al. recently proposed that a wobble modification deficiency resulting in defective translation could be a key molecular factor responsible for the
phenotypic features of MELAS that would explain why the
different MELAS-associated mutations produce indistinguishable clinical features [25].
Several studies suggested that certain mtDNA haplogroups affected the phenotypic expression of this mutation [26,27], but Torroni et al. and Deschauer et al.
recently concluded that European mtDNA backgrounds
did not have any substantial impact [28,29], however,
these studies involved only a small number of individuals
or poorly-defined populations. Thus it was impossible to
confirm the relationship between mutations responsible
for pathological conditions and haplogroups. Indeed, as
mentioned by Samuels et al. [30], large cohorts are
required to identify a reliable connection with complex
human diseases and geographical variations in haplogroup frequencies.
In order to elucidate the relationships between mtDNA
the A3243G mutation and mitochondrial genetic backgrounds, we used RFLP and sequencing to determine haplogroups of 142 patients diagnosed as carriers of the
A3243G mutation by the French mitochondrial disease
network.

Methods
A3243G patients
Screening for mitochondrial diseases was carried out by
the French mitochondrial disease network. This network
is made up of all the laboratories involved in genetic and
biochemical diagnosis of mitochondrial pathologies in
France. These laboratories collect samples from all French
patients suspected to be affected by mitochondrial diseases, as the French health-care system makes it possible
for each individual to receive appropriate treatment. Over
the past fifteen years, 1,667 patients have been diagnosed
as carriers of a mitochondrial mutation. Patients showing
symptoms of MELAS, deafness, or mitochondrial diabetes
were tested for the A3243G mutation, using standard procedures. Among the cohort of individuals diagnosed as
carriers of the A3243G mutation over this period, we have
listed 142 unrelated patients tested by laboratories in University Hospitals of Angers, Bordeaux, Caen, Grenoble,
Lyon, and Paris. All these patients carried the A3243G
mutation and presented a mitochondrial pathology (General phenotype are presented in Table 1). Despite we have
detected qualitatively for all the A3243G patients the presence of heteroplamy (between 80 to 40%), the precise
percentage of heteroplasmy was not available for all the
patients. Genetic analyses were carried out with the appropriate consent of the patients.
Analysis of the haplogroups
Each patient's DNA was extracted from blood or muscle
using phenol/chloroform or Qiagene® QIAAmp DNA kit.
For each patient, the mitochondrial DNA control region
was amplified using the following primers: L15832 (light
chain, nps 15838–15858) and H408 (heavy chain nps
408–429). The amplification product were purified using
ExoSAP-IT® technology. Finally, starting from position
16050, at least 725 pb of the mitochondrial DNA control
region were double-strand sequenced using an ABI Prism
BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit
(Perkin Elmer®). The same primers were used for amplification and sequencing, L15832 and H408, together with
2 additional primers: L16200 (light chain, nps 16194–
16217) and H263 (heavy chain nps 263–285). Each individual was also tested for the presence of a polymorphism
in position 7028 by digestion with the AluI restriction
enzyme after amplification with primers L6909 (light
chain, nps 6890–6909) and H7115 (heavy chain nps
7115–7131).

This made it possible to identify each individual's haplotype and haplogroup markers. The individuals' haplogroup affiliation was determined on the basis of recent
studies involving total sequencing of mtDNA [31-34]
(Figure 1, Table 1). Affiliations to the main European haplogroups were confirmed by standard RFLP tests (UK:
12308HinfI; JT 4216NlaIII; J: 13704Bsto1; T: 15606AluI;

H7025AluI V 4577NlaIII; X:14465AccI; W: 8994HaeIII; I:
4529HaeII) on diagnostic positions for the haplogroups
on the mtDNA coding segment (Figure 1). We have used
the new haplogroup nomenclature recently proposed by
A. Torroni, A. Achilli, V. Macaulay, M. Richards, and HJ.
Bandelt [5] in order to classify the patients in haplogroups.
Control Population and Statistics
The patient's haplotype diversity was compared with a
French population sample (210 individuals) [35]. Indeed
this study was based on a similar methodology leading to
a similar haplotype resolution.

The distribution of carriers of the A3243G mutation
among the haplogroups was compared with frequencies
observed in a sample of the French population consisting
of 1,385 individuals [36]. Each haplogroup was tested as
a possible risk factor for developing the pathology, initially against the rest of the population, then versus haplogroup H. Statistical comparisons were carried out on
each haplogroup in turn, using standard "Khi 2" methods
without correction. The relative risk estimated for each
haplogroup was defined by the "odds ratio" method, with
a confidence interval calculated by the Miettinen method
[37].

Results
1 – Haplotypes and Phylogenetics (Figure 1)
mtDNA D-loop sequencing and RFLP analysis of the coding sequences revealed 111 different haplotypes, among
the 142 unrelated carriers of the A3243G mutation
(reported on Table 1 and in genbank-National Center for
Biotechnology Information with the accession numbers:
to EU519009 at EU519150). The ratio of haplotypes to
individuals was calculated as 0.78, similar to the value of
0.81 obtained in Dubut et al [35]. The most common haplotype in our population, which is the most common in
french population sample, present in 13 individuals (haplotype n°3), differed from the rCRS sequence by a single
transition in position 16519. We also found 11 pairs of
individuals with the same haplotype and 4 triplets. These
haplotypes are also regularly present in the French population sample [35]. Thus the diversity of the population of
the A3243G mutation carriers was apparently, qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that of the French population as a whole.

We were also able to classify 139 patients out of 142 in
haplogroups with no ambiguity. For the 3 remaining individuals, a set of 4 RFLP tests (12308Hinf1; 4216NlaIII;
7025Alu I; 4577NlaIII) was carried out in order to proceed by elimination.

Partial MELAS syndrome patients are patients who present some, but not all of the typical MELAS symptoms. - Detailed haplogroups [5] and haplotypes

For individuals 31, 43, and 61, the absence of digestion of
site RFLP 7025 indicated that they belonged to haplogroup H, despite the absence of polymorphism A73G on
the D-loop, another characteristic of haplogroup H. The
analysis of the 4 RFLP of these 3 individuals clearly
excluded them from the other European haplogroups.
Individual 31 also had polymorphisms 16162 and 16209,

known to be associated with an A73G reversion [38].
These three individuals were, therefore, classified in haplogroup H.
The range of haplogroups was extremely wide and
included the typically European haplogroups H, R0a,
HV0, V, J, T, T1, K, U2, U5, U4, I, X, and W, as well as N1a

Phylogenical repartition of the 111 different haplotypes observed in the 142 A3243G carriers. The phylogenic

and N1b, plus two representatives each of African haplogroup L2, and Asian haplogroup D (figure 1). The presence of the last two haplogroups is not unexpected, since
African mtDNAs are not uncommon in France and members of Asian super-haplogroup M are sporadically identified in Europe [36].
2 – Haplogoup frequencies observed among A3243G
patients
The Figure 1 represents the patients distribution on a phylogenetic tree of the European population based on recent
total sequencing studies of mitochondrial DNA [33]. The
wide distribution of our patients on this tree confirmed
our haplotype observations, i.e.: the existence of a great
number of mutation events A3243G.

In light of these results (Table 1, Figure 1), we investigated
whether there was a difference in distribution among haplogroups of the patient population carrying the A3243G
mutation compared to the reference population. We
therefore compared the distribution of the 142 A3243G
mutation carriers among European haplogroups with the

frequencies obtained for 1,385 unrelated French people
[36].
For the purposes of statistical comparison, we collected
individuals in phylogenetic clusters centered on superhaplogroup R. This point was chosen as it corresponded
to the node where the R line, which represents 90 % of the
French population, divides off from the rest of the human
phylogeny. We then analyzed whether each cluster constituted a risk factor compared to the rest of the population.
We tested the 4 largest clusters representative of a phylogenic reality, as well as the haplogroups or smaller subhaplogroups, so that we could use Khi2 without correction (Table 2).
Super-haplogroup R0 (formerly PreHV*)
Haplogroup R0 included 81 patients (Figure 1), i.e. 57.0%
of the A3243G mutation carriers. The slight overrepresentation (OR: 1.21, C.I. 95%: 0.85–1.71) of this haplogroup
was not significant (p = 0.29) (Table 1). To obtain more
detailed results, we applied the same tests to all sufficiently large sub-clusters of R0, i.e. haplogroups H and

HV0. This revealed an overrepresentation of haplogroup
HV0 (formerly pre-V) (OR: 1.83, C.I. 95%: 0.96–3.47),
however this result is not clearly significant (p = 0.06).
Individuals in haplogroup HV0 had 12 distinct haplotypes, which would seem to exclude the possibility that
overexpression of this haplogroup was due to a single
mutation event. The frequency of haplogroup H did not
seem significantly different from that observed in the control population (p = 0.73). In view of the lack of data on
the proportions of H sub-haplogroups in the French population, as well as the considerable variation in the frequency of sub-haplogroups in Western Europe [32], we
decided not to subdivide this haplogroup.
Super-haplogroup UK
22.5% of our patients were identified as belonging to haplogroup UK, which was not significantly different from
the French population (p = 0.86, OR: 1.04, C.I. 95%:
0.69–1.57). As in the case of haplogroup R0, we tested for
significant differences in the sub-clusters of this haplogroup, however, there was no significant difference for
sub-clusters U5 (p = 0.60), U1811 (p = 0.51), or K (p =
0.70).
Super-haplogroup OTHER
All the patients who were not in super-cluster R were classified in super-haplogroup OTHER. This was, therefore, a
broadly paraphyletic group, including haplogroups: N1, I,
W, X, M, and L. 13 patients were classified in this haplogroup. The comparison of this cluster with the "OTHER"
group of the reference study has detected no significant
difference (p = 0.89, OR = 0.96, C.I. 95%: 0.53–1.75)
Super- haplogroup JT
Haplogroup JT represented 11.3% of our study population, and was, therefore, slightly underrepresented (p =
0.12, OR = 0.66, C.I. 95%: 0.38–1.13). J haplogroup, with
only 3 individuals, seemed very significantly underrepresented among our patients (p = 0.01, OR = 0.26, C.I. 95%:

0.08–0.83). Moreover, these 3 patients can be caracterised
by a later onset (between 20–40 years) but with no specific symptomatology, toward the MELAS patients. There
was not, apparently, any significant difference in haplogroup T (p = 0.79, OR = 1.08, C.I. 95%: 0.59–1.98). The
underrepresentation of Haplogroup JT was apparently,
simply due to underrepresentation of J.
Using haplogroup H as a reference
We also tested whether each cluster constituted a risk factor in comparison to a single reference haplogroup. As
presented by van der Walt et al. [39] using a reference haplogroup is more homogeneous than the sum of the various haplogroups. In addition, it was possible to compare
each haplogroup variation between the control population and our patients with the variation in the same reference haplogroup. The choice of haplogroup H as a
reference was based on the fact that it did not seem to vary
significantly between the control and patient populations.
In addition, the haplogroup H was the most widely represented in the French population. The results of this analysis (Table 3) confirmed the absence of variation for
clusters OTHER, UK, and T (p > 0.6) and emphasized the
underexpression of J (p = 0.02, OR = 0.27, C.I. 95%: 0.08–
0.87). Moreover, the overexpression of HV0 is no more
observed (p = 0.10, OR = 1.73, C.I. 95%: 0.89–3.36).

Discussion
The A3243G mutation, located on the tRNALeu gene
(UUR) [16], is one of the most common mitochondrial
DNA mutations worlwide. The phenotypes associated
with this disease are highly variable and heterogeneous.
The impact of mitochondrial genetic background is
increasingly being considered, in explanation of the phenotype variability common to pathogenic mitochondrial
mutations. Each phenotype would, therefore, consist of
one main pathogenic mutation, associated with secondary mutations, which modulate the expression of the

have any impact on the phenotype of an individual who
does not carry the main mutation and are, therefore, generally considered to be polymorphisms.
Progress in mitochondrial phylogeny has made it possible
to classify mitochondrial genotypes (haplotypes) in
monophyletic lines (haplogroups). Thus, two mitochondrial haplotypes in the same haplogroup will have the
same phylogenetic background and, therefore, share a certain number of polymorphisms [5].
To determine whether these polymorphisms have an
impact on pathogenic mitochondrial mutations, previous
studies investigated the statistical correlations between
pathogenic mutations and mitochondrial haplogroups
[10]. Most of these studies have been carried out with very
small cohorts. The largest cohort of bearers of the same
mutation from a single population to date consisted of 67
Italian patients with mutation 11778 [12]. Previous European research into the A3243G mutation analyzed data
from 35 Spains [29], 11 Finns [40], and 7 Dutch [15]. As
suggested by Samuels et al [30]; in order to make informative statistical analysis, this type of study requires a maximum number of patient carrying the same pathogenic
mutation within the same population. To overcome this
difficulty, the present study included almost all the
patients diagnosed by the French mitochondrial pathology network in recent years. Besides including a large
number of unrelated patients (142), this made it possible
to study a population of patient spread all over the French
territory. Furthermore, the French health care system provides access to treatment to all individuals living in
France, so our results are not biased by the possible
recruitment of specific sub-classes of the population.
Appearance of the A3243G mutation
The present study showed that the A3243G mutation carriers were distributed among all the haplogroups commonly found in the European population. This may

suggested that the A3243G mutation appeared many
times, as hypothesized in previous studies [15,29,40].
Moreover, the genetic diversity of our population is quantitatively and qualitatively similar to that of the French
population. The population of patients carrying the mutation A3423G did not, therefore, seem to have been
affected by founding events, but, on the contrary, to be
due to a large number of independent mutation events.
In a similar analysis of LHON pathology, it was suggested
that the number of independent mutation events could be
assimilated to the number of different haplotypes [12].
Indeed, the haplotypes found in the patient population
were found at random in a sample of the reference population. Similarly, the haplotypes found in our patient population were also present in our reference sample. The
presence of these haplotypes in the reference population
indicated that most of the 3243 mutation events had
appeared independently in haplotypes existing in the
healthy population.
Furthermore, the most common haplotype in our population (n°3) was associated with separate H sub-haplogroups [38], which are also very common in the French
population. Therefore, it is highly probable that the
patients who had this same haplotype resulted from several independent mutation events. Following analysis of
111 haplotypes, we therefore suggest that at least 111
A3243G transition events have occurred recently in the
French population.
Antonio Torroni et al [29] suggested classifying the
A3243G mutation as a "severely deleterious" mutation,
according to the Douglas Wallace classification [41]. This
category includes heteroplasmic mutations that produce a
very handicapping phenotype, transmitted only over very
few generations. Our results confirmed this classification
of the A3243G mutation. In this "severely deleterious"
mutation scenario, individuals affected by the A3243G

mutation on 16.3/100,000 [42] would seem to result
mainly from recurrent mutation phenomena, rather than
founding effects associated with mutation transmission
and propagation phenomena.
This large number of independent mutation events is
apparently linked to the existence of a mutation hot spot
on tRNA leucine 1 [43,44]. Indeed, 24 "probable" pathogenic mutations, including 7 "confirmed", have been
identified on the Mitomap Website for tRNA leucine 1
(where the A3243G mutation is located), which is 70 base
pairs long. This level of mutation seems particularly high
compared with tRNA leucine 2, where only 5 "probable"
pathogenic mutations have been identified, including
only 1 "confirmed". tRNAleu 1 and tRNAleu 2 have
approximately the same length and the same function, so
the higher mutation rate of tRNAleu 1 may be due to its
second function. Indeed the sequence of tRNAleu 1 is
implied with the mTERF factor in a mitochondrial DNA
transcription termination zone; furthermore, this transcription mechanism has been shown to involve the formation of two loops [45]. It is, therefore, possible that this
mechanism blocking mitochondrial RNA-polymerase
(mtRPOL) activity is also able to reduce the accuracy of
DNA-polymerase γ.
Taken together, our findings demonstrated the absence of
a decrease in diversity within the patient haplogroups.
This indicated that mitochondrial genetic background
had no impact on mutation events and did not, therefore,
affect the mutation rate of position A3243G.
Impact of mitochondrial genetic background
Although genetic background does not affect the frequency of mutation 3243, it may modulate its expression.
We compared the distribution of 142 unrelated French
patients affected by the A3243G mutation among European haplogroups, with that of the French population
sample of 1,385 individuals described by Richard et al.
The distribution of the A3243G mutation carriers among
European haplogroups revealed a significant difference in
J haplogroup compared to the French population. These
differences apparently demonstrated a link between haplogroups and the A3243G mutation and, therefore, that
mitochondrial genetic background had an impact on the
A3243G mutation. These findings are apparently in contradiction with a previous study involving 35 Spanish
patients [29], however, the lack of differences in the Spanish cohort may probably due to the small size of the samples.

The impact of genetic background on mutation T14484C,
which is related to LHON pathology, was more striking, as
75% of the carriers of this mutation belonged to J haplogroup. However, the significant presence of the A3243G

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/41

mutation in all European haplogroups may be explained
by a combination of 3 factors: (i) a high mutation rate;
(ii), the absence of polymorphisms related to European
haplogroups located directly on tRNAleu 1, which makes
it impossible to compensate or aggravate directly this
mutation; (iii) tRNA function itself, necessary for the traduction of all the mitochondrial genes, which makes it
impossible to have a global compensation by the presence
of a polymorphism located on a single gene.
J haplogroup was markedly underrepresented among the
A3243G mutation carriers. There are different possibilities
to explain this observation. It might be possible that (i)
this combination produced a phenotype not commonly
considered to be from mitochondrial origin. Then, these
patients would not be studied for mtDNA mutations and
they would form part of other patient populations.
J haplogroup could also (ii) be a protective genetic background. However, this hypothesis is relatively improbable
for several reasons. First, tRNA leucine is not affected by
any polymorphisms linked with J haplogroup, so it is difficult to hypothesize compensation in terms of tRNA leucine conformation. Second, as explained in the previous
paragraph, is highly improbable that the related polymorphisms of J are able to produce a global compensation of
the A3243G mutation. Finally, if the A3243G mutation
were attenuated in J haplogroup, due to its high mutation
rate, it could be identified in the sample of healthy fullysequenced individuals belonging to J haplogroup (Mitomap). However, if we did not find it, the hundred of
mtDNA J published sequences that we have now are not
enough to find this combination on the general population. For example, if the A3243G frequency was 16 out of
100,000 individuals (1 out of 6,250) and the population
frequency of the haplogroup J is around 10%, 62,500
individuals should be sequenced to find the mutation in
the general population.
In light of these facts, we put forward a third hypothesis,
(iii): the association of J haplogroup and A3243G is lifethreatening, and therefore lethal to the embryo or germ
line. This hypothesis agrees more closely with previous
findings that associate J with a number of diseases, such as
LHON [11-13], diabetes [46], and optic neuritis [47] (Figure 2). The life-threatening action of J haplogroup has
been suggested to have resulted from an accumulation of
non-synonymous polymorphisms on the cytochrome b
gene [12]. These complex III damages affects, more specifically, the CoQ binding sites, thus upsetting the proton
pump Q cycle and, finally, Oxidative Phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) coupling (Figure 2) [2,9]. Some authors suggested that this OXPHOS uncoupling characteristic was an
ancient mitochondrial adaptation to the cold, as it promoted heat production [8]. The same authors suggested

that this uncoupling would reduce ROS production, leading to a lower gradual mitochondria degradation
observed in aging. This could explain the overrepresentation of J among populations of people over 100 years
[48,49].
Taken together, these points emphasize the paradox of
haplogroup J, which may promote the expression of mitochondrial mutations in certain individuals, but also be
beneficial for others. Figure 2 summarizes what we named
"J paradox", showing the impact of polymorphisms in J
haplogroup on the OXPHOS level, their implications on
an individual level, and their impact on the distribution
of populations studied within the phylogeny. This paradox, already described by D.C. Wallace, E. Ruiz-Pesini,
and A. Torroni (importance of cytochrome b, relationship
between long lifespan, adaptation, and predisposition for
diseases), clearly indicates that the distribution of J haplogroup in a patient population could vary considerably
and, above all, that this distribution could provide information on the type of mutation and the mechanism
involved.
Thus, the effect of a slight decrease of the mitochondrial
activity (from a genetic or environmental origin) would

be amplified by polymorphisms related to J, resulting in a
high proportion of J haplogroup in the patient population. In the case of a more deleterious mutation (as presented here), amplification of the pathology resulted in a
lower viability of J-3243 patients, and therefore a low proportion of J among patients with this severe pathology.

Conclusion
Taken together, these findings show that the A3243G
mutation has appeared independently on many occasions
in the French population, thus confirming the presence of
a mutation hot spot on tRNA leucine 1. Inter-haplogroup
differences in mitochondrial genetic backgrounds apparently had no impact on the mutation rate of position
3243. However, there is a link between the haplogroup,
especially J haplogroup, and expression of the mutation.
Our study confirmed the susceptibility of this haplogroup
to the expression of pathologies of mitochondrial origin.
If the Western Eurasian haplogroup J appears to be associated to the prevalence of the A3243G mutation, it is
highly provable that other haplogroups from other
regions of the world could be associated. In this sense, two
different studies found, first, a higher frequency of the 9
bp deletion in Taiwan MELAS patients [26] and, second,
an overrepresentation of the T16189C polymorphism in

These results highlight the importance of analyzing mitochondrial genetic background when studying mitochondrial diseases. Indeed, patients' haplogroups could be a
part of the diagnostic procedure for mitochondrial diseases, in order to obtain a clearer understanding of their
modulation mechanisms, and therefore adjust the diagnosis.
