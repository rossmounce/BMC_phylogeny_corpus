Abstract
Background: Alpha 2 macroglobulin (A2M; also known as ovostatin), a homotetrameric protein with four disulfidelinked subunits, has the unique feature of inactivating/inhibiting most known proteases including serine-,
threonine-, cysteine-, aspartic- and metalloproteases. In chickens, A2M has been identified and characterized
biochemically, but little is known of its functional role(s) in the oviduct, hormonal regulation of expression or its
expression in ovarian carcinomas in chickens. Therefore, we investigated estrogen regulation of A2M gene
expression during development of the chicken oviduct, and its expression in normal and cancerous ovaries from
chickens.
Methods: To determine tissue-specific expression of A2M in chickens, we collected various organs from male and
female chickens and performed RT-PCR analyses. To examine A2M gene expression in the oviduct of 1-week-old
female chicks that received a subcutaneous implant of 15 mg DES in the abdominal region for 20 days, we
performed RT-PCR, qPCR and in situ hybridization analyses using cDNAs from control- (n = 5) and DES-treated
oviducts (n = 5), and then each segment of the oviduct from DES-treated chicks. To determine if A2M is a
biomarker of ovarian cancer in hens, we collected cancerous (n = 10) ovaries from a total of 136 chickens which
had completely stopped egg-laying and performed RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses.
Results: We found that A2M is most abundant in the chicken oviduct, specifically luminal (LE) and glandular
epithelia (GE), but it was not detected in any other tissues of either sex. We then determined that DES
(dietylstilbestrol, a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen) increased A2M mRNA only in LE and GE of the oviduct of
chicks. Further, expression of A2M was most abundant in GE of endometrioid adenocarcinoma of cancerous, but
not normal ovaries of hens.
Conclusions: Collectively, results of the present study indicate that A2M is novel estrogen-stimulated gene
expressed in LE and GE of the chicken oviduct and may be used for monitoring effects of therapies for ovarian
cancer in laying hens.

Background
The alpha 2 macroglobulins (A2M) are proteins in
blood that act as protease inhibitors in mammals [1-4].
In humans, the A2M gene is a single-copy gene located
on chromosome 12p12-13 that encodes for a functional

homotetramer protein with disulfide-linked 180-kDa
subunits [5,6]. Even though A2M is produced predominantly by the liver, it may also be expressed in the
reproductive tract, heart, and brain, and may have
important roles in many physiological processes and
medical illnesses including Alzheimer’s disease [4,7,8].
Of particular note, A2M increase in blood serum of
women with inflammatory and neoplastic lesions of the
ovary [9]. It also stimulates production of activin and

inhibin in pre-ovulatory follicles [10,11] and controls
coordinate changes in uterine vasculature during pregnancy [4]. In addition, Umans et al. reported that A2mdeficient mice were viable and produced normal size litters with normal sex ratios over three generations [8].
Moreover, A2M regulates the function of cortical granule
proteases and other trypsin-like proteases activated in sea
urchin eggs during fertilization [12]. In chickens, A2M is
also known as an ovostatin or ovomacroglobulin. It is
found in the oviduct and egg white, but not in other tissues or serum [13] and it has a strong anti-collagenase
activity [14,15]. However, little is known about regulation
of its expression by steroid hormones in the oviduct or
its expression in normal and cancerous ovaries.
As the primary female sex hormone, estrogen regulates reproductive behavior. It is responsible for proliferation and differentiation of several cell types
associated with osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, and reproductive carcinomas [16-21]. The
chicken oviduct is well-known as an excellent research
model for studies of organ development and hormonal
responsiveness [16]. During development of the chicken
oviduct, estrogen stimulates proliferation and cytodifferentiation of epithelial cells to tubular gland cells and
expression of oviduct-specific genes [22,23]. However,
progesterone interferes with normal estrogen-mediated
cytodifferentiation of tubular gland cells [24-27]. Estrogen also affects calcium metabolism for eggshell formation and ovipositioning or egg laying [28,29]. In
addition, estrogen administration to sexually immature
chicks stimulates growth of the oviduct by inducing cellular hyperplasia and hypertrophy [16,30]. The mammalian oviduct undergoes diverse biological changes in
response to sex steroids during the estrous cycle and
early pregnancy as these actions are pivotal to establishing an optimal microenvironment for events ranging
from gamete transport to early embryonic development
[31]. To investigate the biological actions and signaling
pathways of estrogen, the chicken is one of the best animal models [16]. Indeed, steroid hormones are involved
in many physiological and developmental processes
accompanying modification of tissue-specific and conditional control of gene expression and homeostasis
[16,32]. Although general effects of estrogen and progesterone on the reproductive tract of vertebrates are well
documented, details of their interactions that affect cell
signaling pathways in avian species are unclear.
The objectives of this study were to: 1) determine tissue- and cell-specific expression of the A2M gene in
chickens; 2) determine whether estrogen regulates
expression of A2M during oviductal development in
chicks; and 3) compare expression of A2M in normal
and cancerous ovaries from laying hens. Results of this
study indicate that A2M is a novel estrogen-stimulated

gene during development of the chicken oviduct and
that it may be an initial candidate gene for further study
of the development of epithelial ovarian cancer in hens.

Methods
Experimental animals and animal care and use

The experimental use of chickens for this study was
approved by the Institute of Laboratory Animal
Resources, Seoul National University (SNU-070823-5).
White Leghorn (WL) chickens were subjected to standard management practices at the University Animal
Farm, Seoul National University, Korea with respect to
management of hens for reproduction, incubation of
eggs and rearing of chicks, as well as standard operating
protocols in our laboratory. All chickens had ad libitum
access to feed and water.
Tissue samples
Study one

Following euthanasia of mature WL hens, tissue samples
were collected from brain, heart, liver, kidney, muscle,
small intestine, gizzard, ovary, oviduct and testis of 1- to
2-year-old males (n = 3) and females (n = 3). Subsets of
these samples were frozen or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for further analyses. Frozen tissue samples were
cut into 5- to 7-mm pieces, frozen in liquid nitrogen
vapor, and stored at -80°C. The other samples were cut
into 10 mm pieces and fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). After 24 h, fixed tissues were
changed to 70% ethanol for 24 h and then dehydrated
and embedded in Paraplast-Plus (Leica Microsystems,
Wetzlar, Germany). Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 μm.
Study two

Female chicks were identified by PCR analysis using W
chromosome-specific primer sets [33]. Treatment with
DES and recovery of the oviduct were conducted as
reported previously [34,35]. Briefly, a 15 mg DES pellet
was implanted subcutaneously in the abdominal region
of 1-week-old female chicks for release of hormone for
20 days [34,36,37]. Five chicks in each group were
euthanized using 60%-70% carbon dioxide. Subsets of
these samples were frozen or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for further analyses. Frozen tissue samples were
cut into 5- to 7-mm pieces and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The other samples were cut into 10- to 15-mm
pieces and fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS
(pH 7.4). After 24 h, fixed tissues were changed to 70%
ethanol for 24 h and then dehydrated and embedded in
Paraplast-Plus (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 μm.
Study three

In this study, a total of 136 chickens (88 chickens over
36 months of age and 48 chickens over 24 months of

Lim et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:137
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/137

age), which had completely stopped laying eggs were
euthanized for biopsy and cancerous (n = 10) ovaries
were collected. As a control, normal (n = 5) ovaries
were also collected from egg-laying hens. We examined
tumor stage in 10 hens with cancerous ovaries based on
characteristic features of chicken ovarian cancers [38].
In three hens, ovarian tumor cells were classified as
Stage III as they had metastasized to the gastrointestinal
tract and superficial surface of the liver with profuse
ascites in the abdominal cavity. In five hens, the tumors
had metastasized to distant organs such as liver parenchyma, lung, gastrointestinal tract and oviduct with
profuse ascites, so these were classified at Stage IV
tumors. The other two hens did not have tumors in any
other organs; therefore, their ovarian tumors were classified as Stage I. Subsets of these samples were frozen or
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for further analyses. Frozen tissue samples were cut into 5- to 7-mm pieces and
frozen in liquid nitrogen. The other samples were cut
into 10 mm pieces and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS (pH 7.4). After 24 h, fixed tissues were changed to
70% ethanol for 24 h and then dehydrated and
embedded in Paraplast-Plus (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Epithelial ovarian cancers in chickens were classified
based on their cellular subtypes and patterns of cellular
differentiation with reference to ovarian malignant
tumor types in humans [38].
RNA isolation

Total cellular RNA was isolated from frozen tissues
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. The quantity
and quality of total RNA was determined by spectrometry and denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis,
respectively.
Sequence analysis

For pair-wise comparisons, the amino acid sequences of
A2M genes from each species were aligned using Geneious Pro Version 5.04 [39] with default penalties for
gap and the protein weight matrix of BLOSUM (Blocks
Substitution Matrix).
Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis

The level of expression of A2M mRNA in various
organs from chickens, including the oviduct, was
assessed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR as described
previously [40]. The cDNA was synthesized from total
cellular RNA (2 ug) using random hexamer (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and oligo (dT) primers and AccuPower®
RT PreMix (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea). The cDNA was
diluted (1:10) in sterile water before use in PCR. For

A2M, the sense primer (5’-CTG GCT CAC TGC CTT
TGT GT-3’) and antisense primer (5’-CCG TCA ACT
TCC TTT GCT GA-3’) amplified a 405-bp product. For
GAPDH (housekeeping gene; glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), the sense primer (5’-TGC CAA
CCC CCA ATG TCT CTG TTG-3’) and antisense primer (5’-TCC TTG GAT GCC ATG TGG ACC AT-3’)
amplified a 301-bp product. The primers, PCR amplification and verification of their sequences were conducted as described previously [40]. PCR amplification
was conducted using approximately 60 ng cDNA as follows: (1) 95°C for 3 min; (2) 95°C for 20 sec, 61°C for
40 sec, and 72°C for 1 min for 35 cycles (A2M), 30
cycles (GAPDH); and (3) 72°C for 5 min. Then, equal
amounts of reaction product were analyzed using a 1%
agarose gel, and PCR products were visualized using
ethidium bromide staining. The amount of DNA present
was quantified by measuring the intensity of light
emitted from correctly sized bands under ultraviolet
light using a Gel Doc™ XR+ system with Image Lab™
software (Bio-Rad).
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis

Total RNA was extracted from each oviduct of control and
DES-treated chicks using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and purified
using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Complementary DNA
was synthesized using AccuPower® RT PreMix (Bioneer,
Daejeon, Korea). Gene expression levels were measured
using SYBR® Green (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and a
StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The GAPDH gene was simultaneously analyzed as a control and used for normalization
of data. Expression of each target gene and GAPDH was
analyzed in triplicate. Using the standard curve method, we
determined levels of expression of the examined genes
using the standard curves and CT values, and normalized
them based on GAPDH expression levels. The PCR conditions were 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C
for 20 sec, 60°C for 40 sec, and 72°C for 1 min using a
melting curve program (increasing the temperature from
55°C to 95°C at 0.5°C per 10 sec) and continuous fluorescence measurement. The ROX dye (Invitrogen) was used
as a negative control for measurements of fluorescence.
Sequence-specific products were identified by generating a
melting curve in which the CT value represented the cycle
number at which a fluorescent signal was significantly
greater than background, and relative gene expression was
quantified using the 2-ΔΔCT method [41]. For the control,
the relative quantification of gene expression was normalized to the CT of the control oviduct.
In situ hybridization analysis

For hybridization probes, PCR products were generated
from cDNA with the primers used for RT-PCR analysis.

Lim et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:137
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/137

The products were gel-extracted and cloned into
pGEM-T vector (Promega). After verification of the
sequences, plasmids containing gene sequences were
amplified with T7- and SP6-specific primers (T7:5’TGT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG G-3’; SP6:5’CTA TTT AGG TGA CAC TAT AGA AT-3’) then
digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probes were transcribed using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN). Tissues were collected and
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The tissues were
embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm on APEStreated (silanized) slides. The sections were then
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated to diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water through a graded series of alcohol. The sections were treated with 1%
Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and washed two times
in DEPC-treated PBS. After washing in DEPC-treated
PBS, the sections were digested with 5 μg/ml Proteinase K (Sigma) in TE buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50
mM EDTA, pH 8.0) at 37°C. After post-fixation in 4%
paraformaldehyde, sections were incubated twice for 5
min each in DEPC-treated PBS and incubated in TEA
buffer (0.1 M triethanolamine) containing 0.25% (v/v)
acetic anhydride. The sections were incubated in a prehybridization mixture containing 50% formamide and
4× standard saline citrate (SSC) for at least 10 min at
room temperature. After prehybridization, the sections
were incubated with a hybridization mixture containing 40% formamide, 4× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate
sodium salt, 10 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 1 mg/
ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2 mg/ml RNase-free bovine serum albumin and denatured DIG-labeled cRNA probe for
overnight at 42°C in a humidified chamber. After
hybridization, sections were washed for 15 min in 2×
SSC at 37°C, 15 min in 1× SSC at 37°C, 30 min in
NTE buffer (10 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl and 1 mM
EDTA) at 37°C and 30 min in 0.1× SSC at 37°C. After
blocking with 2% normal sheep serum (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, INC.), the sections were incubated
overnight with sheep anti-DIG antibody conjugated to
alkaline phosphatase (Roche). The signal was visualized
by exposure to a solution containing 0.4 mM 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 0.4 mM nitroblue
tetrazolium, and 2 mM levamisole (Sigma).
Statistical analyses

Differences in the variance between control and DEStreated oviducts were analyzed by analysis of variance, and differences between means were subjected
to Student’s t test. The probability value of P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) was used for statistical
analyses.

Results
Multiple sequence alignment, pairwise comparisons, and
phylogenetic analysis

The chicken A2M gene was found in the genomic
region spanning 35,791 bp on chromosome 1. The gene
consists of 35 exons and the mRNA has 4,715 bp
encoding a protein with 1,454 amino acid residues. The
primary sequence of chicken A2M was compared to
those of some mammalian species. In pairwise comparisons of chicken A2M with eight other vertebrate species,
chicken A2M protein has moderate homology to mammalian A2M proteins (42.4-45.4%, Table 1). In particular, chicken A2M protein contains the highly conserved
macroglobulin 1 (MG1) and MG2 domains, A2M family
N-terminal region, and A2M receptor binding domain
found in mammalian A2M proteins (Additional file 1,
Supplemental Figure S1). In the phylogenetic tree generated from primary sequences of available vertebrate
A2M proteins, chicken A2M was placed between mammalian and amphibian species consistent with the general pattern of molecular evolution in vertebrates
(Additional file 2, Supplemental Figure S2).
A2M mRNA expression in chickens (study one)

To determine tissue-specific expression of A2M mRNA
in chickens, we collected various organs from male and
female chickens and performed RT-PCR analysis. As
shown in Figure 1, A2M mRNA is abundantly expressed
in the oviduct and, to a lesser extent, in the brain of
female chickens. However, specific expression was not
detected in any other organs analyzed for either sex.
Therefore, further studies focused on A2M in the
chicken oviduct.
Localization of A2M mRNA expression in the chicken
oviduct

The oviduct of egg-laying hens includes the infundibulum (site of fertilization), magnum (production of

Figure 1 Expression of A2M in various organs of male and
female chickens. Results of RT-PCR analysis using cDNA from
different organs of male [A] and female [B] chickens indicate that
A2M mRNA is expressed abundantly in the oviduct and, to a lesser
extent, in the brain of female chickens. However, specific expression
was not detected in any other organs analyzed for either sex.

components of egg-white), isthmus (formation of the
soft shell membrane), and shell gland (formation of the
egg shell). Using RT-PCR analysis, it was determined
that A2M mRNA is expressed abundantly in the infundibulum, magnum, and isthmus of the chicken oviduct
(Figure 2A). At a lower abundance, A2M mRNA is also
expressed in the shell gland. In addition, in situ hybridization analysis revealed that A2M mRNA is most abundant in glandular epithelium (GE) of the magnum but
expressed to a lesser extent in GE of the isthmus and
luminal epithelium (LE) and GE of the shell gland (Figure 2B). Little or no mRNA was detected in stromal
cells, blood vessels, immune cells or myometrium
(smooth muscle) of the oviduct.
Effects of DES on A2M mRNA expression in the chicken
oviduct (study two)

Oviduct-specific and cell-type specific expression of A2M
in the oviductal segments of hens suggested regulation by
estrogen during development of the oviduct in chicks.
We reported that DES induces development and differentiation of the chicken oviduct [35] and discovered candidate genes regulating oviduct development in chickens
[30]. Therefore, we examined A2M gene expression in
the oviduct of 37-day-old chicks that received a subcutaneous implant of 15 mg DES in the abdominal region for
20 days [35]. We performed RT-PCR analyses using
cDNAs from control- (n = 5) and DES-treated oviducts
(n = 5), and then each segment of oviducts from DEStreated chicks (Figure 3A and -3B). In addition, as illustrated in Figure 3C, qPCR analysis revealed that DES stimulated a 22-fold increase (P < 0.001) in A2M mRNA in
oviducts as compared to oviducts from control chicks.
DES treatment also stimulated a 123-fold increase (P <
0.001) in A2M mRNA in the magnum (Figure 3D).

Further, in situ hybridization analyses revealed abundant

increase in oviductal A2M mRNA as compared to control chicks.

Differential expression of A2M mRNA in normal and
cancerous ovaries of hens (study three)

It was next determined if A2M is a biomarker of ovarian
cancer in laying hens which is the only animal model
that spontaneously develops epithelia-derived ovarian
cancer at a high rate as occurs in women [42]. As illustrated in Figure 5B, RT-PCR analyses indicated that
A2M mRNA expression was abundant in endometrioid

carcinomas (lane 2, -3, -6, and -7), which is characterized by glandular patterns resembling those of the endometrium, but there was little or no expression of A2M
in serous, mucinous or clear cell carcinomas and normal
ovaries (please see Additional file 3, Supplemental Figure S3). Further, in situ hybridization analysis revealed
abundant A2M mRNA localized predominantly to GE of
cancerous ovaries, but not LE, stroma or blood vessels
(Figure 6).

Discussion
Results of the present study are the first to demonstrate
tissue- and cell-specific expression of A2M mRNA in
oviducts from normal chickens and to identify high
levels of expression of A2M gene in cancerous ovaries
of laying hens. Expression of A2M mRNA is unique to
the chicken oviduct. In humans, A2M is synthesized primarily in the liver [43,44] and as a major plasma protein, it makes up roughly 8-10% of the total protein in
human blood [45,46]. However, in chickens, A2M (also
known as ovomacroglobulin or ovostatin) is synthesized
in the oviduct and found in egg whites [14,47,48].
Indeed, the magnum segment of the chicken oviduct
synthesizes and secretes components of egg-white such
as ovalbumin, conalbumin, lysozyme, and ovomucoid
[49] and the isthmus is the site of formation of the soft
shell membrane. As illustrated in Figure 2, A2M mRNA
was most abundant in GE of the magnum and isthmus,
but also expressed to a lesser extent in both LE and GE
of the shell gland. Given the high level of expression of
A2M in these two segments of the oviduct, A2M may
interact with other proteases to maintain a balance of
proteases and protease inhibitors involved in egg formation after ovulation.

and birds [36]. In general, the biological actions of estrogen are mediated by its cognate receptors, estrogen
receptors alpha and beta which activate and recruit a
variety of transcription factors that bind to estrogen
response elements in the 5’ upstream region of target
genes [16,17]. Indeed, several steroid hormones, including estrogen, are involved in many physiological and
developmental events requiring modification of cell-type
and tissue-specific gene expression [16,32]. Consistent
with these results, we reported that exogenous DES
affects growth, development and differentiation of the
chicken oviduct [35] and discovered candidate genes
and pathways regulating oviduct development in chickens [30]. In this study, DES induced A2M mRNA in GE
of the infundibulum, magnum, and isthmus of the chick
oviduct. These results indicate that A2M is likely regulated by estrogen in the oviduct and that it is likely
involved in growth, differentiation and function of the
chicken oviduct.
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
among woman [50-52], but it is rarely diagnosed at an
early stage [53]. Therefore, over 75% of woman diagnosed are at an advanced stage of the disease because it
is generally asymptomatic [54] and there is no specific
biomarker(s) for early detection [38,55]. Although
genetically manipulated rodent models have been used
to elucidate some aspects of the etiologies and pathogenesis of ovarian cancer, the non-spontaneous feature
of their ovarian cancer limits its clinical application
[38,56,57]. Meanwhile, the laying hen is a unique animal
model for research on human ovarian cancer, because
laying hens spontaneously develop epithelial cell-derived
ovarian cancer as occurs in women [38,42,58]. We
found that lysosomal cysteine cathepsin B (CTSB) [59]
and serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade B, member 11
(SERPINB11) (unpublished data) are highly expressed in
cancerous ovaries of hens. In the present study, as for
SERPINB11, A2M is predominantly localized in endometrioid carcinoma, but there was little or no expression in serous, mucinous or clear cell carcinomas and
normal ovaries (Figure 5A and-5B). In addition, A2M
mRNA is abundant in GE of cancerous ovaries, but not
in LE, stroma or blood vessels. These results strongly
support the idea that proteases and their inhibitors play
fundamental roles in a wide variety of biological events
including cancer progression and metastasis due to their
capacity to degrade extracellular matrix proteins [60].
Although human A2M is a well known major cytotoxic
factor in serum which inhibits the DNA synthesis in
mouse ovarian tumor cells [61,62], Hawkridge and coworkers [63] reported that A2M increased in plasma

Lim et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:137
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/137

over a 6 month period in laying hens with late-stage
epithelial ovarian cancer. This result provides proteinlevel evidence for up-regulation of a predicted form of
A2M in plasma of laying hens that developed Stage IV
ovarian cancer as compared to concentrations in plasma
of healthy control laying hens. Collectively, our current
results indicate that A2M is likely involved in gland
morphogenesis and angiogenesis in chicken carcinogenesis. Alternatively, it is possible that A2M interacts reciprocally with other proteases in cancerous ovaries of
chickens as it exhibits some inhibitory activity against a
variety of proteinases (including serine-, cysteine-, aspartic- and metalloproteinases) [64].
Results of the present study indicate that A2M is a
novel estrogen-regulated gene during development of
the chicken oviduct and that it is likely a critical regulator of growth and developmental aspects of epithelial
cells of the ovaries of laying hens as they transition
from normal to a cancerous state. These results also
provide a roadmap for our future research to investigate
the precise role(s) of A2M in underlying mechanisms
responsible for estrogen-mediated development of the
chicken oviduct and as a biomarker to assess the effectiveness of therapies for endometrioid-type ovarian cancer in laying hens.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1. Multiple sequence
alignment of chicken, mammalian and amphibian A2M proteins. (A) The
protein sequences of A2M from chicken (Gallus gallus), human (Homo
sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), orangutan (Pongo abelii), rhesus
monkey (Macaca mulatta), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus),
cow (Bos taurus) and frog (Xenopus laevis) were aligned using Geneious
Pro Version 5.04 [39] with default penalties for gap and the protein
weight matrix of BLOSUM (Blocks Substitution Matrix). Chicken A2M
protein has moderate homology to mammalian A2M proteins (42.445.4%) and contains the highly conserved MG1 and MG2 domains, the
A2M family N-terminal region, and the A2M receptor binding domain
found in mammalian A2M. Shaded sequences indicate identical amino
acid sequences among all species examined. Dashes represent gaps
among the sequences. The conserved functional domains in A2M
proteins were identified using the Pfam-A family matrix and NCBI
conserved domain database.
Additional file 2: Supplemental Figure S2. The phylogenetic tree
generated from alignments of primary sequences of chicken, mammalian
and amphibian A2M proteins. Results of phylogenetic tree analysis
indicated that chicken A2M was between mammalian and amphibian
species consistent with the general pattern of molecular evolution in
vertebrates. Bootstrap values from 1,000 replicates are shown at the
appropriate branches.
Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure S3. Histological types of
ovarian cancers in chickens used in this study. Briefly, clear cell
carcinoma showed vacuolated cells consisting of nuclear atypia. Serous
carcinoma was a solid mass of cells with nuclear atypia. Endometrioid
carcinoma had many glands and mucinous carcinoma was differentiated
around the stromal region. Each image shows two different regions
within each type of carcinoma. Legend: Lane 1, clear cell carcinoma;
