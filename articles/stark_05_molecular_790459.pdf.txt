Abstract
In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, there has been significant progress in understanding the
molecular and cell biology of SARS-CoV. Some of the milestones are the availability of viral genome
sequence, identification of the viral receptor, development of an infectious cDNA clone, and the
identification of viral antigens that elicit neutralizing antibodies. However, there is still a large gap
in our understanding of how SARS-CoV interacts with the host cell and the rapidly changing viral
genome adds another variable to this equation. Now the SARS-CoV story has entered a new phase,
a search for preventive strategies and a cure for the disease. This review highlights the progress
made in identifying molecular aspects of SARS-CoV biology that is relevant in developing disease
prevention strategies. Authors conclude that development of successful SARS-CoV vaccines and
antivirals depends on the progress we make in these areas in the immediate future.

Introduction
Following reports of the last case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in July 2003, there has
been remarkable progress in several areas of research on
the molecular identification of the pathogen and its
pathogenesis, replication, genetics, and host immunogenicity, as well as elegant epidemiological studies. The
sequence of epidemiological events that unfolded early in
the outbreak gave researchers a glimpse into the first new
pathogen of the era of globalization. As the year 2002
drew to a close, multiple reports of an "infectious atypical
pneumonia" caught public health officials across the
globe by surprise and suggested that a new human pathogen had emerged in the Guangdong Province in China
[1]. By the end of February 2003, this outbreak of SARS
had infected almost 800 patients and caused 31 deaths in

the Province [2]. One month later, the disease had spread
throughout Asia and into Europe and North America. This
epidemic eventually affected more than 8000 people and
resulted in approximately 800 deaths worldwide, with
mortality rates reaching over 40% in certain populations
[3,4].
Electron microscope analysis quickly identified the putative SARS agent as having features associated with coronaviruses. The SARS agent was later unambiguously
identified as a new coronavirus member and named
SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5-7]. Coronaviruses are
enveloped, plus-stranded RNA viruses with the largest
RNA genomes known (on the order of 30 kb). Coronaviruses have long been important in the world of veterinary
viral diseases. However, previously known human

coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 cause
only minor health problems such as the common cold
and gastrointestinal diseases. In contrast, the SARS-CoV
pathogen causes fever, pulmonary edema, and diffuse
alveolar damage in severely affected individuals (collectively termed severe acute respiratory syndrome) [8].
SARS-CoV is also a unique coronavirus in that, to date, it
is the only member known to cause severe morbidity and
mortality in humans [8]. Demonstration that SARS-CoV
can cause serious public health problems has focused
attention on the need to understand the viral replicative
strategy and devise prophylactic measures.

In the wake of the SARS epidemic, a number of excellent
review articles on the clinical and molecular aspects of
SARS epidemiology have been published. These reviews
have focused primarily on rapid advances made in the
identification and characterization of SARS-CoV genomes
as well as describing the etiology of the virus and clinical
features of the disease [19-21]. Now the SARS-CoV story
has entered a new phase, a search for preventative strategies and a cure. In this review, we highlight the progress
made in revealing the molecular aspects of SARS-CoV
biology and how such information may lead to strategies
for disease prevention.

The clinical symptoms of SARS are those of a lower respiratory tract infection and are accompanied by damage to
the lungs [6,9,10]. Gastrointestinal involvement is also
common, with more than 20% of patients presenting with
watery diarrhea [11]. Fecal samples from SARS patients
taken up to 25 days after onset of disease contain viral
RNA, which suggests viral shedding through the bowels
[5]. Liver dysfunction has also been reported based on
observed necrosis in hepatocytes [9,12]. Post-mortem tissue examination of SARS patients has found the virus
presence in lung, bowel, lymph node, liver, heart, kidney,
and skeletal muscle samples [13]. The primary mode of
SARS-CoV transmission is airborne via droplets [14,15].
However, there are also reports of the presence of replicating virus in blood cells (peripheral blood mononuclear
cells) and in the small and large intestine [11,16]. Alternative modes of transmission, such as blood-borne or fecaloral are therefore possible.

Brief overview of the SARS-CoV genome

The virus has been isolated from wild animals (Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs) found in the animal
markets of Guangdong, China [17]. The actual natural reservoir for SARS-CoV is still unknown. Once transmitted to
humans, SARS-CoV appears to evolve to facilitate to
human-human transmission. Sequence analysis of different SARS-CoV isolates from early in the epidemic show
deletion events occurring in open reading frame 8 (Orf 8)
[18]. Identical deletions in Orf 8 have also been seen in
animal coronaviruses supporting the idea that SARS-CoV
was introduced to humans via an animal intermediate. In
addition to deletion events occurring early and late in the
epidemic, a slowing of missense mutations is seen over
time, with the most extensive changes occurring in the S
protein during the early stages of the outbreak [18]. This
suggests the virus has undergone some level of adaptation
but has ultimately stabilized at a time in the epidemic
where SARS-CoV has become more virulent. Deciphering
the evolutionary passage of this virus will undoubtedly
provide valuable information on preventing future
outbreaks.

Coronaviruses are subdivided into three groups based on
genetic and serological markers [22]. Groups I, and II
infect mammals while group III is specific for avian species. Group I members are the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and epidemic diarrhea virus
(PEDV), feline and canine coronavirus (FCoV and CCoV),
and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Group II
includes porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis
virus (HEV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine,
equine, and rat coronavirus (BCoV, ECoV, and RtCoV),
and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Group III
includes the turkey coronavirus (TCoV), pheasant coronavirus and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).
Although most closely related to Group II coronaviruses,
SARS-CoV, with some of its unique genetic features, represents a distinct phylogenetic group [22-24].
To date, approximately 61 SARS-CoV genomic sequences
have been analyzed representing different phases of the
epidemic (early, middle, and late) and two isolates
obtained from palm civets [18]. The SARS-CoV genomic
RNA is approximately 30 kb and is organized into 13 to
15 open reading frames (ORFs) [25-27]. The SARS CoV
structural gene arrangement follows the same pattern as
most coronavirus genomes: 5'- Replicase (ORF 1a)-Protease (ORF 1b)-Spike (S)-Envelope (E)-membrane (M)Nucleocapsid (N)-3' [27]. However, in contrast to other
coronaviruses, two ORFs of unknown function are located
between the S and E ORFs and 3–5 ORFs are located
between M and N. In addition, despite the evolutionary
overlap between SARS-CoV and Group II coronavirus
genome sequences, the SARS genome lacks a gene for
hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein, which is common
to a majority of Group II coronaviruses [25]. For an excellent pictorial representation of SARS-CoV genome with
functions (or lack of) assigned to each ORF, please refer to
the recent review by Tan et al [21]. A significant milestone
in SARS-CoV molecular biology was the construction of a
SARS-CoV full-length cDNA-containing plasmid from
which infectious viral RNA can be produced [28]. This
development facilitates the study of SARS-CoV gene

Virology Journal 2005, 2:35

functions and should promote the elucidation of function
for ORFs whose function is still unknown [29]. Although
it has been the perception that these ORFs are not essential for viral replication, they may play a role in the manifestation or severity of disease.

Progress in SARS-CoV genome-based
evolutionary biology
RNA viruses utilize a variety of mechanisms to exchange
their genetic repertoire. The viral RNA dependent RNA
polymerases (RdRP) have a built in error rate that allows
diversification of the genomic sequence as replication
proceeds. Estimates put the error rate of an RdRp at 10-3 to
10-5 per nucleotide [30]. Coronaviruses also undergo high
rates of RNA recombination, providing an additional
mechanism by which the viruses can rapidly amplify
genomic diversity. The SARS-CoV polymerase gene has a
recombination breakpoint, suggesting multiple genetic
origins for this molecule. [31]. These evolutionary mechanisms may have facilitated the adaptation of the animalborne SARS-CoV ancestor to the human host, suggesting
that such events in the future could lead to a virus with
increased pathogenicity for humans or one capable of
infecting multiple species. Recent evidence indicates that
the human-adapted SARS virus has crossed into another
species. Sequence and epidemiological analyses revealed
that a SARS-CoV isolated from a pig was derived from a
human strain. Complete nucleotide sequencing of the pig
virus isolate (designated TJF) and an S gene-based phylogenetic tree analysis revealed a closer relationship with
human SARS-CoV isolates than with animal coronaviruses [32].

Progress in cell biology of SARS-CoV: Signaling
pathways
Successful viral replication depends upon the ability of
the virus to subvert cellular processes to their advantage
and counteract cellular defense mechanisms. Such viruscell interactions represent potential targets for the development of virus-specific antiviral drugs, therapeutics, and
prophylactic vaccines. Different viruses, based on their
target cell types and entry pathways, differ in their cellular
exploitation mechanisms. The mechanism of SARS virus
pathogenesis in vivo may reflect both the effect of viral replication in target cells and host immune responses. The
molecular basis for SARS-CoV replication, the signaling
pathways affected, and the inflammatory responses provoked by viral infection are not yet clearly understood.
Progress in these areas should lead to more effective preventive strategies to counter SARS-CoV infections.
It has been shown that the SARS-CoV N protein selectively
activates the Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) signal transduction pathway, which regulates a wide variety of cellular
processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/35

apoptosis [33]. Such viral induced modifications of the
AP-1 pathway may play a significant role in the viral replicative strategy. Recently, another group demonstrated
that the S protein alone induces AP-1 activation and that
the region from 324–688 amino acids within the S protein is essential for AP-1 activation-dependent IL-8 induction [34]. Another SARS-CoV protein, the U122 ORF of
unknown function (also known as X4), was shown to be
produced in virus infected Vero E6 cells and expression of
this protein alone was shown to induce apoptosis in cell
culture [35,36]. This raises the question of how apoptosis
of SARS-CoV infected cells is balanced in order for the
virus to survive and propagate (Figure 1). This has been
addressed to some extent in recent studies which indicate
that SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells induces both
pro-apoptotic [activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)] and anti-apoptotic [activation of the
protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt)] signaling pathways, although Akt induction appears to be insufficient to
prevent the virus-induced apoptosis [37,38]. Exactly how
SARS-CoV manipulates these cellular signaling pathways
to facilitate viral replication remains to be determined.
As mentioned above, IL-8 induction was shown to be
dependent upon AP-1 activation by SARS-CoV S protein
and in this process NF-κB was not involved [34]. This may
partially explain the clinical observation of dramatic
cytokine storm (high serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8) and
inflammation responses observed in SARS patients in the
acute stage associated with lung lesions; it has been also
suggested that the elevations of IL-6 and IL-8 due to SARSCoV infection of the respiratory tract can induce the
hyper-innate inflammatory response [39]. It is established
that cellular MAPKs regulate AP-1 activation-dependent
IL-8 induction in viral infections [40-42]. In SARS-CoV
infection, the IL-8 induction signaling pathway is perhaps
related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as
anti-ACE2 antibodies inhibit IL-8 induction/release [34].
ACE2 is the cellular receptor for the SARS-CoV and the
receptor-binding sites on the virion are located in the 12–
672 amino acid region of the S protein [43].

Current advances towards SARS-CoV
prevention strategies
During the SARS outbreak that occurred in 2002–2003,
the spread of the disease was primarily controlled by strict
quarantine protocols and patient-isolation measures as
well as by broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral regimens with or without administration of corticosteroids
[44,45]. Since then, the wealth of information that has
emerged on SARS-CoV molecular and cellular biology, as
updated in the preceding sections of this review, now
offers potential avenues for developing more efficient
anti-viral as well as vaccine strategies.

The balance of cell survival and cell death in response to SARS-CoV infection
The balance of cell survival and cell death in response to SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV is shown approaching a cell with
ACE2 receptors (blue "Y"s) on the surface. The virus enters the cell, uncoats, and the viral RNA is replicated and translated.
The SARS-CoV U122 protein induces apoptosis in cells. SARS-CoV S and N proteins each can activate the cellular AP-1 protein, which regulates apoptosis, as well as other cellular processes. AP-1 also activates IL-8, a cellular cytokine. SARS-CoV
infection induces both MAPK (pro-apoptotic) and Akt (anti-apoptotic) pathways. How this balance between cell survival and
apoptosis is maintained is yet unknown. Cellular proteins are labeled in blue, viral proteins in black.

a. Antiviral agents
Coronavirus genome structure and major gene-product
functions have been known for years, but since they cause
mild disease, selection of the virus-specific antiviral drugs
was not a priority in the past. The SARS-CoV epidemic
changed this selective view. Tan et al, 2004, tabulated a
screen of available antiviral agents against SARS virus in
detail in their recent review [46]. The obvious molecular
targets for SARS-CoV antiviral agents are the viral
polymerase/replicase, protease, receptor, the viral mRNA

cap-1 methyl transferase and NTPase/helicase [47-54]. In
addition, a 32-nucleotide long, highly conserved RNA
structure in the 3' untranslated region of coronaviruses
and astroviruses was identified [55]. This structure resembles the 530 loop of 16s rRNA involved in translation initiation suggesting a possible role for this element in
sequestering host translation machinery. The tertiary
interactions of this structure create a tunnel lined with
negative charge where Mg2+ can bind. This unique structure presents an attractive target for tunnel binding antivi-

ral drugs [55]. Finally, since the functional details of most
coronavirus replicase gene products are not known,
random screening of potential antiviral compound libraries will be a key area of drug discovery for SARS virus in
the near future [47].
b. Vaccine development
Vaccines are the best and least expensive prophylactic
measures against pathogens that cause epidemics in
humans. The fact that high titers of virus neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV are found in sera of patients recovering
from infection and that those infected with the virus show
improvement after passive antibody administration suggests a SARS-CoV vaccine is possible and points toward
antibody based treatments for the disease [47,56-58].
However, in developing SARS CoV vaccines, there are lessons to be learned from the world of veterinary CoV vaccines. In a review by Saif, it was pointed out that
coronaviruses in general target mucosal surfaces and
therefore eliciting local (mucosal) immunity is a major
consideration in the development of SARS-CoV vaccines;
this largely depends on the type of vaccine, delivery systems, and immuno-modulatory adjuvants used [59]. Further, immunity against animal CoV is usually short term,
necessitating periodic boosting, which in the end may not
be sufficient to prevent re-infection.

Despite these potential pitfalls in the development of a
human vaccine, efforts to develop a vaccine to prevent
another SARS outbreak are underway. Several laboratories
around the globe are working at an unprecedented pace to
develop a SARS vaccine utilizing essentially two different
types of SARS-CoV-derived immunogens, 1) inactivated
whole virus, and 2) SARS-CoV encoded N and S proteins
using recombinant DNA methods. The possibility of producing an engineered live, attenuated SARS-CoV has also
been considered.
1. Inactivated whole virus
Takasuka et al (2004) have reported that subcutaneous
administration of UV-inactivated purified SARS-CoV virion elicits a high level of humoral immunity, resulting in
long-term antibody secretion and memory B cells [60].
The antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike
(S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of the virus. The inactivated virus also induced regional lymph node T-cell proliferation and significant levels of cytokine production
upon restimulation with inactivated virus in vitro [60].
These studies suggest that whole-killed virion may have
the potential as a candidate antigen for SARS vaccine to
elicit both humoral and cellular immunity. When SARSCoV inactivated by beta-propiolactone was used as antigen in mice and rabbits, the animals elicited antibodies
against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) present in the
S1 region of SARS-CoV. These antibodies effectively inhib-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/35

ited the S-protein mediated SARS-pseudovirus entry up to
50%, suggesting the potential of the inactivated SARSCoV as antigen for vaccine development [61]. Depletion
of RBD-specific antibodies from patient or rabbit immune
sera by immunoadsorption, significantly reduced the
virus neutralizing ability of the sera, suggesting that the
RBD epitope in the S protein is a critical determinant in
developing vaccine strategies [62].
2.1. Cloned N protein
The N protein of SARS-CoV appears to be more conserved
than S and M proteins and it has been suggested that this
protein may play a role in cell-mediated immunity in
SARS-CoV infections and also is an important viral antigen for the early diagnosis. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice
with a SARS-CoV N protein expressed by an E1/partially
E3-deleted, replication-defective human adenovirus 5 vector was shown to produce potent SARS-CoV-specific
humoral and T cell-mediated immune responses, suggesting the potential of this construct to be used as SARS-CoV
vaccine [63]. Along the same line, intra-muscular immunization of BALB/c mice with a plasmid DNA construct
encoding the full-length N protein was shown to elicit
serum anti-N antibodies and spenocyte proliferative
responses against the N protein [64]. The immunized
mice also produced strong delayed-type hypersensitivity
(DTH) and CD8 (+) CTL responses to the N protein, suggesting that the N protein is not only an important B cell
immunogen, but also can elicit broad-based cellular
immune responses [64]. In another novel strategy, the N
protein was expressed in the cytoplasm of Lactococcus lactis
bacterium and the N-expressing bacteria were administered to mice by intranasal or oral route [65]. In this case,
significant levels of N-specific IgG in the mice sera were
detected, suggesting that the engineered bacteria may
serve as a mucosal vaccine against SARS-CoV [65].
2.2. Cloned viral S spike protein or, S-containing pseudovirions
Although immunization with inactivated viral vaccine
provides significant protection in animals against challenge with certain corresponding pathogenic CoVs, in the
case of SARS-CoV there remains the threat of introducing
live virus into the environment from partially inactivated
vaccine, as there are no validated and effective inactivation measures developed yet. To circumvent this obstacle,
Chen et al have introduced the S protein into the deletion
III region of the live, attenuated modified vaccinia virus
Ankara (MVA) vector [66]. This recombinant virus elicits
potent neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and monkeys and the major epitope is mapped to the virus receptor-binding region [66]. In another approach, it has been
demonstrated that co-expression of SARS-CoV S, M and N
expression plasmids in human 293T cells result in the formation of SARS-CoV pseudoparticles (virus-like particles
or VLPs) [67]. These findings help us understand the viral

morphogenesis as well as offer a safer alternative to using
live, replicating SARS virus in the development of
vaccines.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/35

depends on the progress we make in these areas in the
immediate future.

Competing Interests
3. Attenuated live virus
The third possibility is a genetically engineered version of
live SARS-CoV for traits such as attenuated phenotype,
increased immunogenicity, and safe handling (out of
BL3+ facility). A full-length SARS-CoV cDNA-containing
plasmid has been developed from which synthetic infectious viral RNA can be produced [28]. This system allows
for the functional analysis of each gene in the context of
infection and can be used for making attenuated strains
for vaccine development.

Conclusions: Limitations to current SARS
vaccine strategies
SARS-CoV clearly has pandemic potential. Although
progress in SARS-CoV molecular and cell biology research
has been remarkable, there remain clear limitations
regarding vaccine development due to a lack of complete
understanding in the areas of animal models of the disease as well as host immune responses to the evolving
molecular diversity of this newly emerged human virus.
Caution is warranted when utilizing experimental data
originating from one SARS-CoV strain infection in one
animal species or cell line in the development of a human
vaccine. The rapid development of an effective SARS-CoV
vaccine depends upon continuing basic research.
A study on the evolving S protein molecular diversity in
SARS-CoV isolates and its unexpected profound immunofunctional effects illustrates this point [68]. The S protein
exhibited minor genetic diversity among 8 strains transmitted during human outbreaks in early 2003. Synthetic
versions of these S variants with human preferred codons
were tested for 1) their ability to bind the receptor (hACE2), and 2) their sensitivity to antibody neutralization with
viral pseudotypes. In these sets of experiments, substantial
functional differences were found in S derived from a
Guangdong province case -isolate and two palm civets
isolates. Antibodies that neutralized most human isolatesderived S proteins unexpectedly enhanced entry mediated
by the civet virus-derived S proteins [68]. This novel
observation emphasizes the need to understand the
molecular potential of the SARS-CoV genome in developing vaccines to prevent human disease. As mentioned previously, studies also point to the fact that variability in the
S protein from early to late disease outbreak stages has
been detected [18]. There is a large gap in our understanding of how SARS-CoV interacts with the host cell and the
rapidly changing genome of SARS-CoV indicates the
potential variability of such interactions [25]. Development of successful vaccines against SARS virus therefore

The author(s) declare that they have no competing
interests.
