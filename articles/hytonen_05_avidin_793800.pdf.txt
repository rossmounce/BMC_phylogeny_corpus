Abstract
Background: The chicken avidin gene family consists of avidin and several avidin related genes
(AVRs). Of these gene products, avidin is the best characterized and is known for its extremely high
affinity for D-biotin, a property that is utilized in numerous modern life science applications.
Recently, the AVR genes have been expressed as recombinant proteins, which have shown different
biotin-binding properties as compared to avidin.
Results: In the present study, we have employed multiple biochemical methods to better
understand the structure-function relationship of AVR proteins focusing on AVR2. Firstly, we have
solved the high-resolution crystal structure of AVR2 in complex with a bound ligand, D-biotin. The
AVR2 structure reveals an overall fold similar to the previously determined structures of avidin and
AVR4. Major differences are seen, especially at the 1–3 subunit interface, which is stabilized mainly
by polar interactions in the case of AVR2 but by hydrophobic interactions in the case of AVR4 and
avidin, and in the vicinity of the biotin binding pocket. Secondly, mutagenesis, competitive
dissociation analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were used to compare and study the
biotin-binding properties as well as the thermal stability of AVRs and avidin. These analyses
pinpointed the importance of residue 109 for biotin binding and stability of AVRs. The I109K
mutation increased the biotin-binding affinity of AVR2, whereas the K109I mutation decreased the
biotin-binding affinity of AVR4. Furthermore, the thermal stability of AVR2(I109K) increased in
comparison to the wild-type protein and the K109I mutation led to a decrease in the thermal
stability of AVR4.
Conclusion: Altogether, this study broadens our understanding of the structural features
determining the ligand-binding affinities and stability as well as the molecular evolution within the
protein family. This novel information can be applied to further develop and improve the tools
already widely used in avidin-biotin technology.

Background
Avidin from eukaryotic chicken together with streptavidin
from prokaryotic Streptomyces avidinii share an unique
property not seen in any other known proteins, an
extremely high affinity (Kd ≈ 10-15 M) to its natural ligand,
the water-soluble vitamin D-biotin [1,2]. High affinity
and stability of the free and complex forms of (strept)avidin and biotin [1], the easy attachment of biotin to various target molecules [3] and the non-obtrusive chemical
nature of biotin are currently exploited in numerous
(strept)avidin-biotin based life science applications [4].
Avidin is postulated to exist throughout the oviparous vertebrates [5-7] and has long been known to be the operational biotin-harvester in chicken egg-white, comprising
about 0.05% of the total protein [1]. Recently, avidin
related genes (AVRs) highly similar to avidin (91–95%
identity at the nucleotide level) have also been found in
the chicken genome [8-10], suggesting that in addition to
avidin AVRs may also play a role in biotin-harvesting.
AVRs seem to have functional promoter regions [11] and
are located in close vicinity of the avidin gene on the
chicken male-sex chromosome Z [10,12]. Interestingly,
the total number of AVRs is likely to vary between different individuals and even between different cells of the
individual chicken [13]. The function of the AVR gene
products is unknown, however, since the proteins
encoded by them have not yet been isolated from chicken
although mRNAs of AVR1, AVR2 and AVR3 are found
during inflammation [11].
Since the avidin gene of chicken is the only cloned avidin
gene within the vertebrates [14], structure-function and
protein engineering studies have long been concentrated
on it [15-24]. The three-dimensional structure of chicken
avidin has already been determined, too [25,26]. The bacterial homolog of avidin, streptavidin, is also well characterized: the gene encoding steptavidin has been cloned
[27], its structure solved [28] and several studies on the
biochemical properties and protein engineering of
streptavidin have been reported [17,29-34].
In order to characterize the proteins encoded by the AVRs,
avidin related proteins (AVRs) have recently been produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system
and have been demonstrated to be functional biotinbinding proteins like chicken avidin [35]. AVRs do, however, show unique features when compared to avidin. The
AVRs differ from avidin, with respect to glycosylation and
charge properties, and all AVRs except AVR2 contain an
uneven number of cysteine residues in their sequence,
which can form inter-subunit disulphide bridges in addition to the intra-subunit disulphide bridges also seen in
avidin [35]. Interestingly, the biotin-binding affinities of
AVRs have been reported to vary over a wide range of val-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/5/28

ues, AVR4 being almost as efficient a biotin binder as avidin [35,36] and AVR2 showing the lowest affinity for
biotin [35]. AVRs, like avidin, have been found to be very
stable proteins, too; AVR4 has clearly higher thermal stability than avidin [35,36]. Recently, we have been able to
produce avidin and some AVRs in Escherichia coli, too
[37]. The 3D-structure of AVR4 has been recently determined [38], and we have been able to produce chimeric
forms of avidin and AVR4, which retained their high
biotin affinity and showed improved thermal stability
[39].
In this study, we have determined the high-resolution Xray crystal structure of AVR2 in complex with the natural
ligand, D-biotin. By using site-directed mutagenesis and
recombinant expression techniques combined with structural studies, we have been able to characterize some of
the structural factors responsible for the varying biochemical properties of the members of the chicken avidin protein family. The results may be utilized in avidin protein
engineering aiming to fine-tune the ligand binding properties and thermal stability of AVRs and their chimeric
forms in experiments needed to expand the tools available in the area of avidin-biotin technology. This study provides insight into the molecular evolution within the
avidin family, too.

Results
Production and mutagenesis of proteins
Several
different
AVRs,
AVR2,
AVR2(I109K),
AVR4(K109I), AVR6, and a novel avidin mutant K111I,
were efficiently expressed either in insect cells or using a
bacterial expression system as summarised in Table
1 [37,40]. Since wild type AVR6 was found to form oligomers in solution via disulphide bridges (data not
shown), Cys-58 of AVR6 was mutated to Ser based on the
alignment of AVR6 with AVR2 and AVR4 (Figure 1). The
resulting protein AVR6(C58S) (hereafter referred to
AVR6), as well as all of the other studied proteins, were
found to form avidin-like tetramers according to analysis
by size exclusion chromatography (Table 2) and confirmed to be pure and homogenous using SDS-PAGE. The
elution time of AVR2 was slightly different from that of
avidin and of the other studied AVRs, which can partially
be explained by the different charge properties of these
proteins: AVR2 has a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.7
compared to 9.6 for AVR4, 6.9 for AVR6 and 9.7 for avidin. The effect of glycosylation is also clearly seen by the
varying elution times in gel filtration analysis (Table 2) for
AVR2-b produced in bacteria (no glycosylation) and from
insect cells (two potential glycosylation sites; both utilized to some extent [35]).

Purification of AVR2 and AVR6 on the 2-iminobiotin column was inefficient and therefore biotin affinity

chromatography was used to isolate these proteins. In
order to confirm the quality of the protein and correct
cleavage of the bacterial signal peptide used in the production of AVRs in E. coli, the molecular weight of AVR2-b
was determined using ESI-MS. The Mr (14310.0 ± 0.3 Da)
determined from the experimental data using four charge
states correlates well with the expected Mr of 14307.8 Da.
The final product from E. coli expression carries three
additional residues (QTV) at the N-terminus as previously
reported for avidin produced using the same method [37].
In a previous study, the K109I mutation of AVR2 was
hypothesised to be at least partially responsible for the
lower biotin-binding affinity of AVR2 when compared to
other AVRs and avidin [35]. In order to validate this suggestion, we subjected AVRs to mutagenesis. The mutation
I109K was introduced into AVR2 to increase its biotinbinding affinity. Likewise, the mutation Lys→Ile was
introduced into both AVR4 and avidin in order to crossvalidate the hypothesis and lower the biotin-binding
affinity of AVR4 and avidin. Gel filtration analysis showed
that all of the mutated proteins corresponded to tetramers
(Table 2).
X-ray structure of AVR2
The X-ray structure of AVR2-b in complex with D-biotin
was determined at 1.4 Å resolution. The structure determination statistics are summarized in Table 3. As expected
based on the sequence alignment (Figure 1), AVR2 has an
overall three-dimensional structure similar to those of avidin [PDB:1AVD] [26] and AVR4 [PDB: 1Y52] [38]. Each
monomer in the homotetrameric protein has a β-barrel
fold of eight β-strands with one end of the barrel adapted
to bind D-biotin (Figure 1C).

Although AVR2 shares many structural features with avidin and AVR4, there are clear differences in their functional properties (Table 2, Figure 4). The most distinctive
structural differences are found around the terminal carboxylate group of D-biotin. In avidin, atom O10B of the
terminal carboxylate group of D-biotin is hydrogen
bonded to the backbone nitrogen atoms of Ala-39 and
Thr-40 of the L3,4 loop [26], whereas in AVR4 there is
only one polar contact between the O10B atom and the
backbone nitrogen atom of Asp-39 of the L3,4 loop [38].
In AVR2, the O10B atom of D-biotin forms an additional
hydrogen bond to the NE2 atom of Gln-97. Moreover, in
avidin, the O10A atom of the carboxylate group of biotin
is hydrogen bonded to the OG atoms of Ser-73 and Ser75, while in AVR2 and AVR4 there is only one hydrogen
bond to the OG atom of Ser-71 (equivalent to Ser-73 in
avidin).
A few differences are also found around the central
aliphatic segment and the bicyclic ring system of D-biotin.
Leucine in avidin (Leu-99) and AVR4 (Leu-97) is replaced
by glutamine in AVR2 (Gln-97), and threonine in avidin
(Thr-77) and AVR4 (Thr-75) is replaced by Ser-75 in
AVR2. The side-chain atoms of Gln-97 of AVR2 not only
interact with the valeryl segment of D-biotin, as in the case
of the corresponding Leu in avidin and AVR4, but also
with the carboxylate group of D-biotin (see above). The
corresponding residue in AVR4 and avidin is leucine, but
glutamine is also found aligned at the equivalent position
in other AVRs. The presence of the polar head group of
Gln-97 in AVR2 also affects the type and conformation of
the neighbouring residues, such as Ser-73, Leu-99 and
Arg-112 as well as Ile-109 from another subunit. These
residues line the entrance of the biotin-binding pocket: i)
Ser-73 of AVR2 has two alternative rotamers unlike in the

addition, Ile-109 of AVR2 is located next to Trp-108, a residue known to be important for biotin binding [17,30],
but Ile-109 does not appear to alter the conformation of
this residue significantly in comparison to avidin and
AVR4. All of these differences are located at the open end
of the biotin-binding pocket and are very likely responsible for the varying biotin binding properties of avidin,
AVR2 and AVR4. Moreover, although D-biotin adopts a
very similar conformation in avidin, AVR2 and AVR4, the
biotin-binding network is not identical (Figure 2).
The 1–3 subunit interface (numbering according to Ref.
[25]) is also markedly different in amino acid composition in AVR2 in comparison with avidin and AVR4. In avidin, the subunit contacts are established between the
hydrophobic amino acid residues Met-96, Val-115 and
Ile-117 [25,26], which are in contact with the same set of
residues from a neighbouring subunit. In AVR2, only
valine (Val-113 in the AVRs) is conserved, while Met-96
and Ile-117 of avidin are respectively substituted by the
hydrophilic residues Lys-94 and Asn-115 in AVR2 (Figure
1A). In the crystal structure of AVR2, the side chain of Lys94 can exist in two alternate rotamers, which are hydrogen
bonded either to the side-chain oxygen atom of Asn-115
or to the main-chain oxygen of Val-113, both from a
neighbouring subunit (Figure 3). Asn-115 is also in contact with Asn-115 from a neighbouring subunit. In AVR4,
Ile-117 of avidin is substituted by Tyr-115, the latter interacting strongly with Tyr-115 of an adjacent subunit and
through a hydrogen bond to Lys-92 [38].
Comparative analysis of avidin family proteins
Previously, it has been found that AVR6 forms intermonomeric disulphide bridges [35]. Gel filtration analysis of
AVR6 revealed that these disulphide bonds are formed
between tetramers, thus causing further oligomerization

of the protein (not shown). Consequently, we introduced
the C58S mutation into AVR6, which successfully blocked
oligomerisation, and used this mutated protein form in
the comparative analyses in the present study.
The overall charge of AVR2 (pI ≈ 5) is very different when
compared to that of avidin and AVR4 (pI ≈ 10). The
number of ionic bonds in avidin is seven per subunit,
whereas three salt bridges are seen in AVR4 [38]. In the
AVR2-biotin complex, four intra-subunit salt bridges are
detected: Asp-39-Arg-112, Glu-89-Arg-120, Lys-92-Asp117 and Arg-98-Asp-107.
Biotin dissociation analysis
Of the proteins studied, the fastest [3H]biotin dissociation
rate was found with AVR2, while the slowest rate was
measured for avidin (Figure 4). Ile-109 is found close to
the biotin-binding site in AVR2, whereas all other proteins
in avidin family [35] have lysine at the equivalent position. In order to test the effect of Ile-109 on the biotin
dissociation rate, the AVR2(I109K) mutant was produced.
The resulting mutant had a significantly slower dissociation rate than the wild-type protein. AVR6, in turn,
showed a dissociation rate constant in between the values
observed for the two AVR2 forms. The dissociation rate
constant for AVR4, measured in a previous study [39], was
somewhat higher when compared to that of avidin. When
Lys-109 of AVR4 was mutated to isoleucine according to
the sequence of AVR2, the rate of dissociation increased as
expected, but biotin binding of the resulting protein was
still stronger than for the mutated AVR2 form. Similarly,
the analogous mutation K111I in avidin increased the
biotin dissociation rate compared to the wild-type protein. Hence, the analyzed proteins can be sorted according
to their biotin-binding affinities (as the biotin dissociation rate decreases, biotin binding strengthens): AVR2 <

Differential scanning calorimetry
The thermostability of avidin, AVR2, AVR4 and AVR6
were measured using DSC analysis (Table 2). In this analysis, AVR2 showed higher thermostability than avidin.
The measured Tm (91.3°C) was between the values measured previously for avidin (83.5°C) and AVR4 (106.4°C)
[36]. As expected, the thermal stability of AVR2 increased
in the presence of biotin (Tm = 112.5°C), similarly as
reported for avidin, AVR4 and streptavidin [22,36,42].
The I109K mutation significantly stabilised AVR2, resulting in a 6.3°C increase in Tm as compared to the wild-type
protein. The reverse mutation, K109I in AVR4 and K111I
in avidin, led to destabilisation of the proteins, resulting
in a 1.9°C and 7.0°C decrease in the Tm, respectively.
Interestingly, AVR6 showed slightly higher thermal stability (Tm = 87.7°C) than avidin (Tm = 83.5°C) in the
absence of biotin, while in its presence the Tm of AVR6
(114.0°C) was raised significantly but remained lower
than that measured for the avidin-biotin complex (Tm =
117.0°C).

mined for AVR6. AVR4 has a similar temperaturedependency of the biotin dissociation rate as avidin, and
the K109I mutation did not significantly change the temperature-dependency although it clearly increased the
biotin dissociation rate constant (Figure 4B). The equivalent mutation K111I in avidin resulted in a nearly twofold increase in the biotin dissociation rate over a temperature range of 40–60°C (Figure 4B).

The biotin dissociation data, measured at various temperatures, were analysed using the global fit method
described elsewhere [41]. The resulting dissociation rate
temperature-dependency model was compared to the one
previously measured for avidin [39]. The analysis revealed
a different temperature-dependency for AVR2 in comparison to avidin (Figure 4B). The mutation I109K caused a
shift in the temperature-dependency of AVR2-biotin dissociation, resulting in a model resembling that deter-

In the present study, we have used targeted mutagenesis
and X-ray crystallography combined with the comparative
analysis of thermal stability and ligand-binding kinetics
to dissect the functional properties of the chicken avidin
protein family. The high-resolution structure of AVR2, a
close relative of avidin, provides new insights into the
biotin-binding mechanism of the avidins and serves as a
new source of knowledge for protein engineering studies,
too.
In order to understand the observed differences in the
biotin-binding affinities and thermal stabilities within the
avidin protein family, the crystal structures of avidin [26],
AVR2, and AVR4 [38] were compared, all in complex with
D-biotin. Overall, these proteins share high structural
similarity and their ligand-binding sites within the eightstrand β-barrel resemble each other. The most distinctive
structural differences are found around the terminal carboxylate group and central valeryl segment of D-biotin. In
the AVR2 structure, D-biotin is in contact with the L3,4
loop as in the case of avidin [26] and AVR4 [38], but also
in contact with the side-chain atom of Gln-97 unlike the
avidin or AVR4 complexes where leucine is found at the
equivalent position. Glutamine is conserved in all of the

112, which is slightly displaced with respect to the corresponding residue seen in AVR4 and avidin. Then again,
the conformation of Arg-112 may be altered due to interactions with the AVR2-specific Ile-109, too. Ile-109 of
AVR2 respectively corresponds to Lys-109 and Lys-111 in
avidin and AVR4. In AVR2, Ile-109 resides close to Trp108, which is known to be important for biotin binding
[17,30], but the conformation of Trp-108 does not seem
to be significantly affected by Ile-109. Yet another
sequence difference, whereby Thr-77 of avidin and the
corresponding threonine of AVR4 (residue 75 in the
AVRs) is substituted to Ser in AVR2 does not appear to disrupt hydrogen bonding to the sulfur atom of D-biotin.
However, this substitution enlarges the binding cavity
around bound biotin (Figure 2) and hence contributes to
the lower affinity of AVR2 for biotin. The biotin-binding
network is not identical in avidin, AVR2 and AVR4 despite
the similar conformation that D-biotin adopts in all of
these structures. In general, the polar contacts with Dbiotin seem to be much more variable than the hydrophobic ones, which are highly conserved, indicating their
important role in the biotin-binding process. In line with
this, the importance of hydrophobic residues for biotinbinding of streptavidin has been demonstrated experimentally [30]. Moreover, the interactions of avidin, AVR2
and AVR4 with the carboxylate group of D-biotin are
clearly less conserved than the interactions with the central aliphatic valeryl segment and the bicyclic ring system
of the tetrahydrothiophenic and ureido rings buried
deeper within the biotin binding pocket [26,38,43].

Biotin dissociation analysis
Biotin dissociation analysis. (A) Temperature-dependence of biotin dissociation rates measured by the [3H]biotin
dissociation assay. Radiobiotin dissociation rate constants
measured for the proteins are plotted as a function of temperature. The models for dissociation rate constants
obtained by global fit analysis [41] are shown by lines and the
determined individual dissociation rates by symbols. The dissociation rate constants determined previously for avidin and
AVR4-b are also shown [39]. (B) Relative dissociation rate
constants of the AVRs and avidin mutant K111I compared to
that of avidin. The individual dissociation rates as well as global fit analysis models of the dissociation rate are divided by
the dissociation rate constants of avidin obtained from global
fit analysis. The data are plotted using a logarithmic y-axis.

AVRs except for AVR4 [35], resides 3.3 Å away from Dbiotin in the AVR2 structure, and a hydrogen bond may
form between Gln-97 and biotin even though the angle is
not optimal. In addition to D-biotin, Gln-97 seems to
form a hydrogen bond with Ser-73, which exists in two
alternative conformations. The presence of Gln-97 in
AVR2 probably affects the conformation of nearby Arg-

Based on the temperature-dependence of the biotin dissociation rates and relative biotin dissociation rate constants
(Figure 4), the order of the biotin binding affinities is as
follows: AVR2 < AVR6 < AVR4 < avidin. These results are
in line with the previous ligand-binding analyses performed for AVRs using an optical biosensor [35]. Furthermore, the presence of an isoleucine residue at sequence
position 109 in AVR2 rather than lysine seems to be the
most dominant difference affecting biotin binding in
comparison to AVR6. However, this sequence variation
does not explain the differences in the biotin-binding
properties of AVR2 versus AVR4. This was confirmed by
analysing the AVR4(K109I) mutant, which showed significantly stronger interactions with biotin when compared
to wild-type AVR2. Moreover, the equivalent mutation
K111I in avidin affected only slightly the dissociation rate
constant of avidin. The temperature-dependency model
suggests even slower dissociation rates at low
temperatures for the mutant compared to wild-type avidin (Figure 4B). The different effects of the Lys→Ile mutation on avidin versus AVR4 may reflect differences at the
L3,4 loop of avidin and AVRs. Although the AVR2-biotin
dissociation rate was over 5000-fold higher at 20°C than
that of avidin and thus showed significantly lower biotin-

binding affinity than avidin, the thermal stability of AVR2
in the absence of biotin is higher (Tm = 91.3°C) than for
avidin (Tm = 83.5°C). Higher thermal stability is notable
and may have a functional role.

parison with the other AVRs, this region in AVR4 shares a
higher level of similarity with avidin. This likely correlates
with the high, avidin-like biotin-affinity of AVR4 versus
the lower biotin-affinity of the other AVRs [39].

The biological role of AVRs is unclear; avidin is thought to
work as a biotin-harvester in chicken egg-white, thus
preventing growth of biotin-dependent organisms [1].
The lower biotin-binding affinity and higher stability of
AVR2 raises the question if AVR2 has any biological role
similar to avidin. The expression of avidin is induced in
chicken during inflammation in various tissues and
mRNAs of some AVRs, including AVR2, have been
detected during inflammation [11]. This suggests that
AVR2 (and the other AVRs) may play a role in inflammatory reactions.

Ligand binding to avidin and streptavidin can be considered as an extreme discovery of nature in the sense of
affinity and free energy [45]. The structural complementarity between biotin and its binding site in (strept)avidin is
almost perfect, which together with the numerous hydrogen bonds that are formed between (strept)avidin and
biotin is the basis for the extraordinary tight binding
[25,28]. Thus, it is not surprising to find that a small perturbation in this highly perfected system can reverberate
as a major change in the biotin binding kinetics. It is
known that the high biotin-binding affinity of (strept)avidin is dominated by extremely slow ligand dissociation
rates, especially in the case of avidin.

The conformation of the L3,4 loop of AVR2 was found to
strongly resemble that of AVR4 [38]. In avidin, this loop
is disordered in the absence and ordered in the presence
of D-biotin [25]. In contrast, the L3,4 loop of AVR4 was
previously found to be in an nearly identical, fixed conformation both in the absence and presence of D-biotin [38].
The latter situation seems to be true for all AVR proteins,
since the L3,4 loop per se, as well as the neighbouring
sequences between the β3 and β5 strands, are highly conserved within the AVR family but quite different from
avidin [35]. Recently, this region was transferred to avidin
from AVR4 [39]. The resultant chimeric ChiAVD showed
better thermal stability (Tm = 96.5°C) than avidin (Tm =
83.5°C) [39] and, interestingly, the observed stability of
AVR2 (Tm = 91.3°C) and its mutant AVR2(I109K) (Tm =
97.6°C) was similar to that of ChiAVD. Hence, in addition to the 1–3 subunit interface, the region between the
β3 and β5 strands of AVR2 is likely to affect the stability of
the protein (Figure 3). This view is supported by our preliminary results of engineered dual chain avidins suggesting only slightly better stability for the AVR2-type 1–3
interface compared to the 1–3 interface of avidin
(Hytönen et al. unpublished results).
The present study provides novel knowledge of the structural characteristics of AVR proteins. Avidin related proteins are considered as an individual branch in the
evolutionary tree of avidins in chicken [44]. Based on the
results of the current study (Figure 5), AVR2 and AVR6
seem to be functionally closely related to each other, supporting the previous phylogenetic analysis [44]. It seems
that the critical difference, isoleucine at position 109 in
AVR2 in comparison to lysine in avidin and the other
AVRs, has arisen after the divergence of AVR4 and the rest
of AVRs. This sequence difference also explains why AVR2
has the lowest observed biotin-binding affinity among the
AVRs. All AVRs have a region between β3 and β5 strands,
which is quite different from that in avidin [35]. In com-

Conclusion
The high-resolution structure of AVR2 combined with the
ligand binding data broadens our understanding of the
general principles of ligand-binding processes. Furthermore, the structural information can be employed as a
basis to create improved tools for biotechnology. This was
demonstrated in a previous study, where chimeric forms
of avidin and AVR4 showed improved properties compared to the native proteins [39].

Methods
Production and mutagenesis of proteins
Proteins were expressed using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus
expression system in Sf9 insect cells in biotin-free media
as previously reported [40]. Bacterial expression in BL21(AI) (Invitrogen) was also used for protein expression
as described in Ref. [36]. The proteins were isolated using
affinity chromatography with an 2-iminobiotin or biotin
matrix (Affiland S. A., Belgium) as described earlier [17].
Biotin was used as the capture ligand for AVR2, AVR2-b,
AVR2(I109K) and AVR6-b, and for these proteins elution
was achieved using acetic acid. The recombinant proteins
investigated in this article are summarised in Table 1.
Crystallization and data collection
Minimal Screen 12 [46], a sparse matrix protein crystallization screen [47], was used to search for suitable conditions for crystallization of AVR2-b with the vapor
diffusion hanging drop method at 22°C. An orthorhombic crystal with approximate dimensions of 0.15 × 0.1 ×
0.1 mm was obtained within three weeks using equal
volumes (1 µl) of sample solution containing 0.5 mg/ml
protein in 50 mM NaPO4 (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl and
well solution containing 0.1 M Na-citrate (pH 4.6) and
1.5 M NH4PO4. Before crystallization, the AVR2-b –
biotin complex was prepared by adding biotin to the pro-

tein solution in a molar ratio of 5:1, respectively, followed
by incubation at 4°C for 1.5 hours. For data collection,
the AVR2-b crystal was cryoprotected with 20% glycerol
(v/v) and 2 M lithium sulfate just prior to flash-freezing in
a 100 K nitrogen stream (Oxford Cryostream). Diffraction
data were collected from a single crystal at the ESRF beam
line ID14-1, Grenoble at 100 K using an ADSC Q4R CCD
detector. Data were processed with programs of the XDS
program package [48]. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 3.

Structure determination
The X-ray structure of AVR2-b was solved using the molecular replacement method and programs from the CCP4i
suite [49]. The space group (P212121) of the AVR2-b crystal was ascertained by Amore [50] and molecular replacement was done with Molrep [51]. A tetramer (biological
unit) composed of only main-chain atoms and based on
a high resolution X-ray structure of avidin (Airenne,
Hytönen et al. unpublished; [PDB:1VYO]) was used as a
trial model. The best solution (correlation coefficient =
0.291) from molecular replacement was selected as the

input for automatic model building with ARP/wARP [52].
After adding side chains separately for each monomer A to
H using the guiSIDE mode of ARP/wARP, the model was
refined with Refmac5 [53], and modified and rebuilt with
O [54]. Solvent atoms were added to the model with the
automatic procedure of ARP/wARP [55] and the ligand
biotin was built with the ARP/wARP LigandBuild program
[56]. Sulfate ions and glycerol molecules were built either
manually in O or with the aid of the program Coot [57].
The AVR2-b structure was analyzed with the programs
PROCHECK [58] and WHATIF [59]. Structure determination statistics are summarized in Table 3. The coordinates
and structure factors of AVR2-b have been deposited in
the Protein Data Bank with entry code [PDB:1WBI].
Biotin dissociation analysis
The dissociation rate constant of AVR2-b, AVR2(I109K),
AVR4(K109I), AVR6-b and AVD(K111I)-b for [3H]biotin
was measured at various temperatures as previously
described [60]. [3H]Biotin was purchased from Amersham. The data were analysed by using the global fit
approach as shown by Hyre et al. [41], in which the temperature dependence of the dissociation rate constant is
modelled by the Eyring equation.
Differential scanning calorimetry
The thermal stability of AVR2, AVR2-b, AVR2(I109K),
AVR4(K109I), AVR6-b and AVD(K111I) was studied
using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as previously described [61]. The melting point of protein unfolding was determined from thermograms measured in a
buffer containing 50 mM NaPO4 (pH 7.0) and 100 mM
NaCl. Proteins were also analysed in the presence of
biotin (three-fold molar excess of biotin per protein
subunit).
Size exclusion chromatography
Gel filtration experiments were performed as described in
Ref. [23] with a Superdex HR 10/30 column using 50 mM
NaCO3 (pH 11.0), 150 mM NaCl as the liquid phase. The
column was calibrated using IgG (158 kDa), BSA (68
kDa) and ovalbumin (44 kDa) as molecular weight
standards.
Mass spectroscopy
The molecular weight of AVR2-b was measured with a
Micromass LCT Electronspray ionization TOF Mass spectrometer essentially as described previously [37]. Samples
were dialysed against water and diluted 1:1 with acetonitrile. The final protein concentration was 7 µM and
the pH was adjusted using formic acid (0.2 %). Positive
ions were detected using the default parameters (source
temperature 100°C, desolvation temperature 120°C, RF
lens voltage 750 V, extraction cone voltage 6 V, sample

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/5/28

cone voltage 50 V, capillary voltage 3800 V) and the sample was injected at a rate of 20 µl/min.
Phylogeny inference
Avidin-related sequences were aligned using MALIGN
[62,63]. One-thousand bootstrap variations [64] of the
alignment were generated using SEQBOOT and distance
matrices produced using a structure-based scoring matrix
[62,63]. Trees were produced using NEIGHBOR, and the
consensus tree produced using CONSENSE. SEQBOOT,
NEIGHBOR and CONSENSE are programs from the
PHYLIP package [65,66].
Miscellaneous methods
The multiple sequence alignment shown in Figure 1A was
created using the program MALIGN [62,63] of Bodil [67]
and edited with Corel Draw11. The protein representations in Figure 1, 2, 3 were made with the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System [68] and edited with the programs
Gimp and/or Corel Draw11. Cavities were calculated with
Surfnet [69] using 1.4 Å and 3.0 Å radii for minimum and
maximum gap spheres, respectively. The electron density
map shown in Figure 1C and 1D was calculated with programs of the CCP4i suite.

Authors' contributions
The biochemical studies of AVD and AVRs were mainly
carried out by VPH and JAEM in the group of Prof. MSK at
the University of Jyväskylä and Tampere. JAEM performed
also the mutagenesis analyses. HK had an important role
in crystallizing the AVR2, whereas KKH and TKMN carried
out the DSC analyses. JH had a major role in the expression and purification of the studied AVD and AVRs. TK
performed most of the 3H-biotin dissociation analyses
and MSJ made the phylogenetic inference analysis. The
structural analysis of AVR2 was made mainly by TTA in
the Structural Bioinformatics Laboratory led by the group
leaders MSJ and TAS.
