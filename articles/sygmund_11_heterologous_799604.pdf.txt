Abstract
Background: FAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) currently raises enormous interest in the field of
glucose biosensors. Due to its superior properties such as high turnover rate, substrate specificity and oxygen
independence, GDH makes its way into glucose biosensing. The recently discovered GDH from the ascomycete
Glomerella cingulata is a novel candidate for such an electrochemical application, but also of interest to study the
plant-pathogen interaction of a family of wide-spread, crop destroying fungi. Heterologous expression is a
necessity to facilitate the production of GDH for biotechnological applications and to study its physiological role in
the outbreak of anthracnose caused by Glomerella (anamorph Colletotrichum) spp.
Results: Heterologous expression of active G. cingulata GDH has been achieved in both Escherichia coli and Pichia
pastoris, however, the expressed volumetric activity was about 4800-fold higher in P. pastoris. Expression in E. coli
resulted mainly in the formation of inclusion bodies and only after co-expression with molecular chaperones
enzymatic activity was detected. The fed-batch cultivation of a P. pastoris transformant resulted in an expression of
48,000 U L-1 of GDH activity (57 mg L-1). Recombinant GDH was purified by a two-step purification procedure with
a yield of 71%. Comparative characterization of molecular and catalytic properties shows identical features for the
GDH expressed in P. pastoris and the wild-type enzyme from its natural fungal source.
Conclusions: The heterologous expression of active GDH was greatly favoured in the eukaryotic host. The efficient
expression in P. pastoris facilitates the production of genetically engineered GDH variants for electrochemical-,
physiological- and structural studies.

Background
FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH, EC
1.1.99.10, D-glucose:acceptor 1-oxidoreductase) was first
discovered in 1951 in Aspergillus oryzae [1] but remained
a relatively little investigated enzyme. In the following
decades, only a few FAD-dependent GDHs were characterized from the bacterium Burkholderia cepacia [2], the
larvae of the moth Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm)
[3] and the fly Drosophila melanogaster [4]. Since the
application of FAD-dependent GDH as electrode catalyst
in glucose biosensors [2] and for biofuel cell anodes [5]

was published and promoted, more attention was drawn
to this enzyme, and new members were identified and
characterized, e.g. from the fungi A. terreus [6], A. oryzae
[1,7,8] and Penicillium lilacinoechinulatum [9]. The
advantages of FAD-dependent GDH for their use in glucose biosensors are high turnover rates and a good stability. Moreover, its oxidative half-reaction is unaffected by
oxygen, whereas the oxygen turnover in glucose oxidasebased electrodes reduces the electron yield and produces
hydrogen peroxide which degrades the biocatalyst. In
comparison with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)dependent GDHs a lower redox potential of FAD-dependent GDH is noteworthy. Two big producers of glucose
biosensors, Abbott and Bayer, already implemented
FAD-dependent GDHs in some of their products. A
novel member of the small family of FAD-dependent

GDHs was recently discovered in the plant pathogenic
fungus Glomerella cingulata (anamorph Colletotrichum
gloeosporoides) and characterized [10]. It is an extracellular, glycosylated enzyme showing a narrow substrate specificity with b-D-glucose and D-xylose as substrates,
which are oxidized at the anomeric carbon atom. The
electrons are transferred to quinones, phenoxy radicals,
redox dyes and iron complexes such as ferricyanide and
ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate, but not to molecular
oxygen. The biological function of this GDH is still
unclear but a role during fungal attack on the host-plant
is proposed. By reducing quinones and phenoxy radicals
GDH is able to neutralize the action of plant laccases,
phenoloxidases or peroxidases, which are used by
infected plant tissues to parry the fungal attack.
Despite the enormous biotechnological relevance of
FAD-dependent GDHs there are only scarce reports
about their heterologous expression. The catalytic subunit of a bacterial GDH from Burkholderia cepacia was
successfully expressed in E. coli. [11]. In contrast, expression levels and productivity for five putative FAD-dependent GDHs from several Aspergillus species in E. coli
varied significantly [12]. To our knowledge no eukaryotic
expression system was tested and published so far for the
expression of FAD-dependent GDHs. We demonstrate
that G. cingulata GDH (GcGDH) can be heterologously
expressed in P. pastoris as well as in E. coli, but with a
big difference in the efficiency - expression levels are
much higher for the eukaryotic system. In addition,
recombinant GDH was compared with the enzyme isolated from its natural source to investigate if their differences in molecular and catalytic properties.

Results
Expression of G. cingulata glucose dehydrogenase in E. coli

To evaluate the influence of the N-terminal GcGDH
sequence on the amount of soluble, active GcGDH
expressed in E. coli, three nucleotide sequences coding for
GDH with varying N-termini were cloned into pET-21a(+)
for expression in E.coli under control of the T7 promoter.
Plasmid GC1 encodes the full length GcGDH including its
native signal sequence. For plasmid GC2 the nucleotide
sequence of the mature protein was cloned right after the
start codon, and GC3 contains a truncated version starting
8 amino acids upstream of the FAD binding motif
(GXGXXG). The resulting expression vectors were transformed into E. coli expression strains Rosetta 2, T7
Express and T7 Express (pGro7), and cells carrying the
plasmids were cultivated in MagicMedia sic! at 20°C. Cultures were harvested at an optical density at 600 nm of
approximately 15 and disrupted using a French press. The
protein concentration of the cleared lysate varied between
6 to 12 mg mL-1. Lysates were tested for GDH activity
using the standard DCIP enzyme assay.

Page 2 of 9

Under the tested conditions active GcGDH could only
be detected in the T7 expression strains co-transformed
with the plasmid pGro7 coding for chaperones. Of the
three tested constructs, GC1 showed the highest volumetric activity (10 U L-1 (DCIP); 5.5 U L-1 (FcPF6)) in the
fermentation medium supplemented with L-arabinose.
GDH activity was lower (3.3 DCIP U L-1; 2.0 FcPF6 U L-1)
for GC2 and no detectable GDH activity was measured for
GC3. Activities were around five times lower without arabinose induction of the chaperones. The cell pellet
obtained after disruption was tested for the existence of
inclusion bodies using SDS-PAGE. The majority of proteins found in the insoluble fraction were of the molecular
mass of GcGDH (68 kDa). Refolding experiments were
performed with inclusion bodies obtained from the
expression experiment yielding the highest amount of
soluble GDH. Samples were taken after 1, 12, 24 and 48 h
of incubation in various refolding solutions containing
FAD, but no activity could be detected from the tested
refolding conditions.
Production and purification of recombinant GcGDH in
P. pastoris

The P. pastoris expression plasmid pPICGcGDH was
constructed by cloning the nucleotide sequence including the native GcGDH signal sequence into the pPICZaA expression vector under control of the methanolinducible AOX promoter. Transformed P. pastoris X-33
cells were checked for integration of the expression cassette into the genome by colony-PCR, and five positive
transformants were tested for expression in a smallscale experiment. The best producing clone pPIC-GC1
(2400 U L -1 GDH activity) was selected for further
studies.
Production of the enzyme was carried out in a 7-liter
stirred and aerated bioreactor (Figure 1). The initial glycerol batch phase lasted for 19.5 h and produced 66.6 g L-1
of wet biomass. During the 4 hours of the transition phase
from glycerol to methanol the wet biomass further
increased up to 99 g L-1. At this time a volumetric activity
of 1900 U L-1 was already detected. After the transition
phase, a methanol feed was started and regulated manually
to maintain a steady DO reading of 15%. Levels of wet biomass reached 149 g L-1 during this induction phase, and
the concentration of soluble protein in the culture supernatant increased from 80 to 300 mg L-1. Volumetric GDH
activity in the culture supernatant reached a maximum
value of 48,000 U L -1 , corresponding to 57 mg of
recGcGDH per litre of medium. After 50.5 h the fermentation was ended since the specific GDH activity in the culture supernatant started to decline.
The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity
using a two-step purification protocol employing hydrophobic interaction chromatography and anion exchange

chromatography (Table 1). Strict pooling of only the
purest fractions resulted in a moderately high yield of
71%. After purification, a bright-yellow protein solution
was obtained and the purity was analyzed by SDSPAGE. The final recombinant GDH preparation had a
specific activity of 836 U mg-1.
Molecular and catalytic properties

The molecular mass of recGcGDH produced in P. pastoris
was determined by SDS-PAGE, which showed a broad
and diffuse band between 88 and 131 kDa (Figure 2). After
deglycosylation under denaturing conditions using
PNGase F, a single, sharp band with an estimated molecular mass of 67 kDa was obtained. The typical flavoprotein
spectrum shows the same characteristics as the spectrum
of wild-type GcGDH with almost identical FAD absorption maxima at 381 and 459 nm (Figure 3). These peaks
disappear upon reduction of the enzyme by adding
D-glucose.
The thermal stability of the recGcGDH was preliminary investigated by determining the temperature
optimum which was found at 46°C. For GDH
expressed by G. cingulata (produced according to

[10]) the temperature optimum was 48°C. In a more
detailed investigation using the ThermoFAD technique
to derive thermal unfolding transition values (Tm) for
different pH values and buffer substances (Table 2),
recGcGDH showed a pH-dependent thermal stability
with the highest Tm values in the acidic range of 4.5
to 6.4. The maximum Tm value of 56°C was measured
in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 and in 50
mM MES buffer pH 5.8. The activation energy was
calculated to be 19.5 kJ mol-1 from initial rates in the
range of 26 to 51°C and is quite similar to the naturally produced GDH (21 kJ mol-1).
The kinetic properties of recGcGDH were determined
for the two best substrates that were identified for wildtype GDH, D-glucose and D-xylose. In these experiments ferrocenium was used as electron acceptor in
saturating concentrations. The apparent catalytic constants were determined both at pH 5.5 and 7.5 and
compared with those measured for GDH isolated from
its natural source G. cingulata (Table 3, [10]). The
molecular and catalytic properties of the recombinant
enzyme overexpressed in P. pastoris are identical to
those of the wild-type enzyme.

Discussion
Recently the purification and characterization of a novel
FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase produced by the
plant pathogenic fungus G. cingulata and its proposed
role in plant pathogenicity were published [10]. The
reported features of this GDH are of interest in two
respects: (i) to elucidate the role in the mechanism of
plant-pathogen interactions during the infection process

and (ii) in electrochemical applications [13,14]. To facilitate biochemical and structural studies as well as engineering of G. cingulata FAD-dependent GDH, the
heterologous expression of GcGDH was investigated. To
target potential problems with the expression of a heavily glycosylated eukaryotic flavoprotein in a prokaryotic
host several approaches were taken. Along with expression of GcGDH with varying N-termini under mild

conditions (auto inducing minimal media, 20°C) we also
tested different E. coli expression strains for their suitability to express soluble and catalytically active GcGDH.
The effect of the N-terminal amino acids on the
expression levels of a fungal FAD-dependent GDH in E.
coli was shown in the US patent 7,741,100 [15]. Expression levels could be increased approximately 10-fold by
deletion of the signal sequence of A. oryzae GDH.
Therefore, GcGDH was expressed in full length and
with the native signal sequence removed. A third, truncated N-terminus was designed according to a sequence

oxidoreductase family. The N-terminal sequences that
were successfully used for the expression of A. oryzae
GDH [15] and the flavin domain of Phanerochaete chrysosporium cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) in E. coli
[16] seem to be highly conserved in these closely related
proteins. The analogous sequence MTAYDYIVI was
therefore chosen as N-terminal sequence for the third
variant of GcGDH. Surprisingly, although in a prokaryotic expression host, expression levels of GcGDH were
highest with the full-length protein, which included its
own signal sequence. For the variant lacking the signal
sequence the volumetric activity decreased three-fold,
and no activity was detected for the third and shortest
construct. For all tested expression constructs the fraction of GDH protein found in inclusion bodies (as
judged by SDS-PAGE) was high. For the rather closely
related P. amagasakiense glucose oxidase (GOX) refolding experiments from inclusion bodies were successful,
retrieving ~10% of the totally aggregated GOX in an
active form [17]. Although the same or slightly modified
conditions were used, the same result could not be
reproduced for GcGDH. We conclude, that although
GOx is the phylogenetically closest relative of GDH
[10], the structure of GDH is different enough not to
favour cofactor reconstitution under the same or similar
conditions.
In addition to in vitro refolding of incorrectly folded
protein several other methods have been described in

literature for promoting the synthesis of active recombinant protein in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction rather
than as inclusion bodies [18,19]. Increased amounts of
the chaperone system GroEL/GroES in the cytoplasm
apparently reduces the accumulation of aggregated
GcGDH in the cell, leading to small amounts of active
soluble GcGDH. The supply of tRNAs for 7 rare codons
by the strain Rosetta 2, showed no beneficial effect on
the expression of GcGDH. This, however, was to be
expected since codon analysis of the gcgdh gene revealed
no sequences that could affect the transcriptional or
translational efficiencies.
A further strategy to reduce the in vivo aggregation of
recombinant GcGDH in E. coli was to use slow growth
and weak inducing conditions. To this end, the cultivation temperature was lowered to 20°C and an auto-inducing medium (MagicMedia) was used. It was shown
previously that yields of a target protein as well as cell
mass can be increased substantially by using such mild
conditions [20]. Cell densities were increased up to 30 g
L-1 compared to 10 g L-1 obtained by the standard LB
medium. Even though all these considerations were
taken into account for the expression of GcGDH in E.
coli a volumetric activity of10 U L-1 could be produced
under optimized conditions. Since expression rates in P.
pastoris were much higher no effort was made to purify
GcGDH from E. coli cultures.
When using the eukaryotic expression system, GcGDH
could be expressed extracellularly in high yields using the
native signal sequence, which indicates that this signal
sequence is properly recognized and processed by the
yeast. A final volumetric activity of 48,000 U L-1 and a
space-time yield of 24 mg L-1 d-1 could be achieved by P.
pastoris. This is a 70-fold improvement of the space-time
yield compared to the wild-type producer. The cultivation yielded a total of 57 mg L-1 of recombinant protein,
which corresponds to ~20% of total extracellular protein.
The purification protocol resulted in a protein preparation of high purity (as checked by SDS-PAGE) with a

specific activity of 836 U mg-1, which is comparable to
the wild type preparation (840 U mg-1,,[10]). Since the
first purification step already yielded a protein of high
specific activity (833 U mg -1 ) the procedure might be
reduced to a one-step purification. All (bio)physical and
catalytic properties studied for recGcGDH are essentially
identical to those of the wild-type enzyme isolated from
the original source G. cingulata (Table 3, [10]). The high
degree of glycosylation of recombinant GcGDH (approx.
65% as judged from SDS-PAGE, Figure 2) is also found
in native GcGDH (approx. 70%, [10]). These values are
certainly an overestimation by SDS-PAGE, which is
known to smear bands of glycosylated proteins, but the
range of the bands of native (95-135 kDa) and recombinant (88-131 kDa) GcGDH are nearly identical. The temperature optimum for recGcGDH is 46°C and close to
the previously reported value for an FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase from A. terreus (50°C) [14].
This study reports and compares the successful heterologous expression of Glomerella cingulata GDH in P.
pastoris and E. coli. The glycosylation of this protein
seems to play an important role for folding into the correct conformation, as already shown for other proteins
as well [21]. This makes the eukaryotic host more suitable for the production of recGcGDH, which displays
properties that are essentially identical to those of the
wild-type enzyme [10]. The expression in E. coli has the
advantage that glycosylation-free GcGDH can be
obtained, which is useful for e.g. crystallization studies.
However, for this application the production in the prokaryotic host has to be optimized further to provide sufficient amounts of protein.

Conclusions
The suitability of a eukaryotic and a prokaryotic expression system for the heterologous overexpression of an
extracellular fungal glucose dehydrogenase is tested by
this study. The expression of GcGDH in P. pastoris provides a suitable method for the easy preparation of

Sygmund et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:106

sufficient amounts of GDH as well as genetically engineered GDH variants for further applications in electrochemistry, for structure/function studies or for the study
of plant-pathogen interactions of this attractive novel
enzyme.

Methods
Strains and media

P. pastoris X-33 is a component of the EasySelect Pichia
Expression Kit and was obtained from Invitrogen. Chemical competent E. coli strain NEB 5-alpha was purchased from New England Biolabs (NEB) and used for
maintenance and propagation of plasmids. E. coli
expression strains Rosetta 2 and T7 Express were
ordered from Novagen and from New England Biolabs,
respectively. E. coli cells were cultivated in LB-medium
(peptone from casein 10 g L -1 , yeast extract 5 g L -1 ,
NaCl 10 g L-1) containing 100 mg L-1 ampicillin and/or
30 mg L-1 chloramphenicol. Low Salt LB-medium (NaCl
reduced to 5 g L-1) was used when zeocin (25 mg L-1)
was used as selection marker. MagicMedia sic! E. coli
expression medium (Invitrogen) was used for expression
studies in E. coli. P. pastoris transformants were grown
on YPD plates (yeast extract 10 g L-1, peptone 20 g L-1,
dextrose 10 g L -1 , zeocin 100 mg L -1 ) and the Basal
Salts Medium (Invitrogen) was used for fermentation.
Chemicals and Vectors

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, Fluka, Roth
or VWR and were of the highest purity available. Primers were from VBC-Biotech and nucleotide sequences
are shown in Table 4. Restriction enzymes and T4-ligase
were purchased from Fermentas, Phusion polymerase
from NEB and the yeast expression vector pPICZaA
from Invitrogen. The plasmid pET-21a(+)from Novagen
was used for expression in E. coli. Plasmid pGro7
encoding the chaperones GroEL and GroES was purchased from TAKARA Bio Inc. (Japan).
Heterologous expression in E. coli

The published plasmid pGC1 [10] was used as template
for the amplification of GcGDH cDNA (JF731352) with
three different forward primers (GC-GDHndeIfw1 - 3)
and the reverse primers GC-GDHnotIrv1. The three

resulting nucleotide sequences encoded GcGDH with
varying N-termini. Both the PCR fragments and the
expression vector pET-21a(+) were digested with NdeI
and NotI and ligated using the Rapid DNA Ligation Kit
from Fermentas. Correct insertion of the genes and the
absence of mutations were checked by DNA sequencing
and verified plasmids were transformed into E. coli
Rosetta 2, E. coli T7 Express and E. coli T7 Express carrying the plasmid pGro7. In order to compare the
expression levels of GcGDH with these 9 different
expression strategies, small-scale cultivation in 125-mL
baffled shaken flasks filled with 30 mL media were performed at 20°C. To reduce time-consuming steps such
as monitoring optical density (OD) prior to induction or
adding appropriate inducers, the autoinducing MagicMedia (Invitrogen) was used for this comparative study.
Chaperone co-expression was tested both with 1 mg
mL -1 L-arabinose for induction and without added
inducer.
All cultures were grown at 37°C for 5 h and then
further cultivated overnight at 20°C. Cell suspensions
were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the cell
pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM potassium
phosphate buffer pH 6.5 supplemented with 5.7 mM
PMSF), and disrupted by using a French Press. The crude
extract was cleared by centrifugation (4000 × g, 30 min,
4°C), the supernatant was tested for GDH activity by the
colorimetric DCIP assay, and the pellet was analyzed for
insoluble GDH by SDS-PAGE. Refolding experiments
were done according to the protocol of the Renaturation
Basic Kit for Proteins (Sigma). Additionally, flavin adenine dinucletide (FAD) was added to the renaturing solution at a concentration of 50 μM.
Heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris

GcGDH-encoding cDNA was amplified using the primers
GC-GDH-BstBI+SS and GC-GDH-NotI. The PCR amplicon was digested with Bsp119I and NotI and cloned into
the yeast expression vector pPICZaA. The resulting plasmid pPICGcGDH was linearized with MssI and transformed into electrocompetent P. pastoris X-33 cells
prepared according to the operating instructions and
applications guide of the MicroPulser electroporation
apparatus (Biorad). Transformants were selected on YPD
zeocin plates, and the integration of the gene was
checked by colony PCR with the primers AOX-fw and
GC-seq-rv1. Five positive colonies were selected for
expression studies in baffled shaken flasks. Pre-cultures
(50 mL) were grown overnight at 30°C in YPD medium
containing 50 mg L-1 zeocin. After approximately 16 h of
growth the pre-cultures were transferred into 1-L baffled
shaken flasks containing 300 mL of BMMY medium.
Methanol (0.5% v/v final concentration) was added regularly (approximately every 12 h) while incubating at 30°C

and shaking at 150 rpm. Samples were taken every day
and analyzed for protein concentration and GDH activity.
Enzyme production and purification

Recombinant GcGDH was produced in a 7-L glass vessel
fermenter (MBR) filled with 4 L of medium (Basal Salts
Medium). After autoclaving, the pH of the medium was
adjusted to 5.0 with 28% ammonium hydroxide and
maintained at this pH for the entire fermentation process. The fermentation was started by adding 0.4 L (9%
v/v) of preculture grown on YPD medium in 1-L baffled
shaken flasks at 125 rpm and 30°C overnight. The cultivation was executed according to the Pichia Fermentation Guideline of Invitrogen and enzyme production was
induced with methanol. At the transition phase from glycerol to methanol feed the protocol was altered according
to Zhang et al. [22]. At the end of the glycerol batch
phase methanol (0.2% v/v) was injected aseptically into
the fermenter, and the glycerol feed faded out by a linear
ramp 20 g L-1 h-1 to 0 g L-1 h-1 over 4 h. Once the dissolved oxygen concentration spiked, the methanol feed
was started. It was regulated to keep a stable dissolved
oxygen concentration of 15%. The cultivation temperature was 30°C, the variable airflow rate was around 6 L
min -1 , and the agitation was set to 800 rpm. Samples
were taken regularly and clarified by centrifugation. The
pellet was used to determine wet biomass. GDH activity
and extracellular protein concentration were assayed in
the supernatant.
The fermentation broth was clarified by centrifugation
(6000 × g; 30 min; 4°C) and saturated ammonium sulfate solution was slowly added to give a 60% saturated
solution. Precipitates were removed by ultracentrifugation (30,000 × g; 15 min; 4°C) and the enzyme was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a
400-mL PHE Sepharose 6 fast flow column (chromatographic equipment and materials from GE Healthcare
Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mM phosphate buffer
pH 7 containing 60% (saturation) ammonium sulfate.
Proteins were eluted within a linear gradient from 60 to
0% ammonium sulfate in 8.5 column volumes (CV, 3.4
L) and collected in 50 mL fractions. Active fractions
were pooled and diafiltrated using a hollow fiber crossflow module (Microza UF module SLP-1053, 10 kDa
cut-off, Pall Corporation). The partially deionized
enzyme solution (3 mS cm-1) was applied to a column
packed with 100 mL DEAE-Sepharose FF, previously
equilibrated with 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Proteins were eluted within a linear salt gradient from 0 to
2 M NaCl in 10 CV (1 L). The pooled fractions were
concentrated and the buffer was exchanged by diafiltration to 50 mM MES pH 5.8, and the enzyme solution
was filter sterilized, aliquoted and stored at -30°C.

Enzyme assays and protein determination

Glucose dehydrogenase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically using 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP, ε520 =
6.9 mM-1 cm-1) as electron acceptor. The reaction was
followed for 180 s at 30°C in a Lambda 35 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer). The DCIP-based assay
contained (final concentrations) 50 mM sodium acetate
buffer, pH 5.5, 300 μM DCIP and 100 mM D-glucose.
Alternatively, ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate (ε300 =
4.3 mM -1 cm -1 ) was used as electron acceptor for the
determination of the catalytic constants to enable measurements in the range of pH 5.5 and 7.5. One unit of
GDH activity was defined as the amount of enzyme
necessary for the reduction of 1 μmol glucose or electron
acceptor per min under the assay conditions [10]. It is
noted that DCIP is a two-electron acceptor, but the ferrocenium ion a one-electron acceptor. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using
a prefabricated assay (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as standard.
Molecular properties

SDS-PAGE was carried out using Mini-PROTEAN TGX
precast gels with a denaturing gradient of 4-15%. Protein
bands were visualized by staining with Bio-Safe Coomassie (Bio-Rad). Dual Color Precision Plus Protein Standard
(Bio-Rad) was used for mass determination. All procedures were done according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. To estimate the degree of glycosylation
homogenous recGcGDH was treated with PNGase F
(NEB) under denaturing conditions according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The spectrum of homogeneously purified recGcGDH was recorded at room temperature from 250 to 550 nm in both the oxidized and
reduced state using a U-3000 Hitachi spectrometer
(Tokyo, Japan). GDH was diluted in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 5.5 to an absorbance of ~1.5 at 280 nm and the
spectrum was recorded before and shortly after the addition of glucose to the cuvette. The temperature profile of
activity for wildtype and recombinant GDH was determined in parallel by measuring the average GDH activity
over 5 min from 25 to 62°C in temperature controlled
DCIP assays.
ThermoFAD analysis

The Thermofluor-based ThermoFAD method [23] was
used to monitor protein unfolding for analysis of thermal stability of recGcGDH in a set of 22 different buffers, each at 50 mM, over a pH range from pH 4.5-9.0.
Buffers used can be seen in Table 4. The method takes
advantage of the intrinsic fluorescence of the FAD
cofactor, and does not depend on fluorescent dyes.
recGcGDH was diluted in buffer to a final concentration

of 1 mg mL-1 and subsequently analyzed in triplicates in
50 μL aliquots per well. A real-time PCR cycler (iCycler, Bio-Rad) providing a MyiQ Optics Module, and
SYBR-Green filters (523-543 nm) was used to record
the signals. The samples were heated in 0.5°C steps (20
s per step) from 30° to 95°C. The fluorescence signal
was measured at the end of each step.
Steady-state kinetics

Apparent kinetic constants for D-glucose and D-xylose
were determined with ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate
as electron acceptor at a fixed concentration of 200 μM
using glucose in the range of 1-100 mM, and xylose in
the range of 100-1500 mM. Constants were calculated
using nonlinear least-squares regression by fitting the
observed data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Sigma
Plot 11, Systat Software).
