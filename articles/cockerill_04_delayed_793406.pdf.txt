Impact factors – love them or loathe them, as a publisher
it is difficult to ignore them. The number one question
that BioMed Central gets asked by potential authors is
"What is the impact factor of the journal XXXXXX?".
The scientific community has come to regard impact factors, calculated by the Institute for Scientific Information
(ISI), as providing a quantitative and largely objective
guide to which journals publish the best research.
Although many problems can result from naïve reliance
on journal impact factors as a quality metric (especially
when attempting to compare different fields) [1], the perception of many scientists is that, to get recognition and
career advancement, they must publish in a journal with
a good impact factor.

The problem
An impact factor is defined by a simple calculation: "The
impact factor is calculated by dividing the number of current citations to articles published in the two previous
years by the total number of articles published in the two
previous years."[2].
This presents a major obstacle to publishers of new journals, since even the best journal won't have a proper
impact factor for three years. But this situation is even
worse than it sounds, as the clock only starts ticking when
ISI starts "tracking" the journal.

When does ISI start tracking the journal? It depends…
According to ISI, the factors it uses to decide when to start
tracking a journal include:
· how many articles the journal publishes
· how many competing journals ISI already tracks in
the same discipline
· the previous citation record of the journal's editorial
board
· the previous citation record of the authors who
publish in the journal
· the number of times the journal has been cited in
journals that are already tracked by ISI
Unfortunately, despite good intentions, this selectivity on
ISI's part has the unintended consequence of concealing
the success of new journals. A case in point is BMC Bioinformatics. Since it published its first article in 2000, this
journal has rapidly established itself as one of the most
active and successful in its field (see Figure 1).
However, since ISI only began tracking BMC Bioinformatics in 2002, this will not translate into an official impact
factor until June 2005, when the 2004 impact factors are
released.
All is not lost, however. Johannes Stegmann noted in correspondence to Nature [3] that it is possible to calculate an
unofficial impact factor for any journal, even if it is not
officially tracked by ISI, by making use of the information

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/93

in ISI's cited reference database which includes the entire
reference list of all tracked journal articles, and therefore
includes citations of journals which are not themselves
tracked. Using this method, the 2003 impact factor for
BMC Bioinformatics can be estimated as follows:

Unofficial 2003 impact factor for BMC Bioinformatics
Impact factor = 235/48 = 4.896

As Table 1 shows, this "unofficial" 2003 impact factor for
BMC Bioinformatics already compares very favourably with
that of more established journals.

The journals listed are a selection of the journals that most frequently
publish and/or cite bioinformatics-related articles.
Note that the figure listed for BMC Bioinformatics is not an official
impact factor, but an estimate, based on ISI's data, of what the impact
factor would be, if it were calculated.

This estimated impact factor places BMC Bioinformatics in
the top 5% of all journals covered by ISI. Yet an author
reviewing the 2003 Journal Citation Report from ISI would
have no idea that the journal BMC Bioinformatics was so
highly cited.

Figure of
Growth 1 the journal BMC Bioinformatics
The chart shows the number of articles published in BMC Bioinformatics, and the number of times the journal has been
cited, over the time span 2001-3.

The number of articles on which this calculation is based
is relatively small. The official impact factor, which is
expected to arrive in mid-2005, may be significantly
higher or lower, but it seems clear that it will be
respectable.
BMC Bioinformatics is not alone in facing this problem:
there are many other recently launched journals, both
from BioMed Central and from other publishers, whose
impressive citation record is not currently captured by the
impact factors listed in ISI's Journal Citation Report. It is
an unfortunate fact that this may needlessly dissuade
many authors from publishing in these new journals, and
thus may serve to hold back innovation in science
publishing.

What can be done?
After many years of having the field of citation analysis
largely to itself, ISI is finally facing the prospect of serious
competition. The increasing use of standard XML formats
by publishers mean that citation analysis is no longer a
daunting logistical challenge. It is simply a question of
number crunching.
Citation tracking data for Open Access content is already
available through Citebase [4], and the usefulness of this
free service will grow as the amount of Open Access content increases. Meanwhile, CrossRef (the full text linking
service) is also now collecting article reference lists from
publishers for 'forward linking' purposes [5], and these
could in future potentially also be used to calculate
impact-factor-like metrics. In addition Elsevier is now
working on Scopus [6], a bibliographic database/citation

analysis service that the publisher claims will offer
broader journal coverage than ISI.
With luck, this competition may give ISI just the spur it
needs. BioMed Central's recommendation is that ISI
should reconsider its policy on citation tracking, and
should introduce a policy of immediately tracking any
peer-reviewed journal that meets basic quality standards
and which can provide reference list data in an appropriate form to allow automated analysis. By doing this, ISI
would provide a valuable impartial service to the scientific
community.
