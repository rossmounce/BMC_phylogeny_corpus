Abstract
Background: This study reports progress in assembling a DNA barcode reference library for
Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera ("EPTs") from a Canadian subarctic site, which is the
focus of a comprehensive biodiversity inventory using DNA barcoding. These three groups of
aquatic insects exhibit a moderate level of species diversity, making them ideal for testing the
feasibility of DNA barcoding for routine biotic surveys. We explore the correlation between the
morphological species delineations, DNA barcode-based haplotype clusters delimited by a
sequence threshold (2%), and a threshold-free approach to biodiversity quantification-phylogenetic diversity.
Results: A DNA barcode reference library is built for 112 EPT species for the focal region,
consisting of 2277 COI sequences. Close correspondence was found between EPT morphospecies
and haplotype clusters as designated using a standard threshold value. Similarly, the shapes of taxon
accumulation curves based upon haplotype clusters were very similar to those generated using
phylogenetic diversity accumulation curves, but were much more computationally efficient.
Conclusion: The results of this study will facilitate other lines of research on northern EPTs and
also bode well for rapidly conducting initial biodiversity assessments in unknown EPT faunas.

Background
Despite 250 years of taxonomic effort and the description
of about 1.7 million species, it is believed that most species remain undescribed [1,2]. Perhaps even more importantly, barriers to the identification of the known species
are substantial. Most groups are studied by a few specialists, and even specialists regularly encounter specimens

that cannot be reliably identified because diagnostic traits
only reside in a particular sex or life stage. Because of such
complexities, there is no region on the planet where a
comprehensive registry of biodiversity is currently possible. The present study aims to break this barrier by bringing a molecular tool and taxonomic expertise to bear on a
single geographic region to construct a reference library of

DNA barcodes [a short standardized gene fragment used
for species identification, see 3]--both to connect life
stages and sexes and to create an identification system
based on DNA sequences that is easily transmissible to
anyone with access to sequencing technology.
This study represents the first in a series that has the goal
of assembling a DNA barcode library for all eukaryote species at Churchill, Manitoba. This site was selected for analysis because its fauna has seen substantial taxonomic and
ecological studies, reflecting its location as the most easily
accessible site in the Canadian subarctic. Furthermore, its
northerly position should aid the assembly of a comprehensive library because species richness [4] and genetic
diversity [5] are lower here than at more southerly sites.
An additional factor promoting the use of this site lies in
the fact that Churchill is home to one of the major
research facilities in the Canadian subarctic, both enabling our work and ensuring that a barcode library will
gain broad usage in the support of other research. Despite
the factors facilitating analysis, the assembly of a comprehensive barcode library for all eukaryote species at this site
will require a substantial effort, as the local biota may
include as many as 10,000 species.
The present investigation begins the assembly of a barcode library at Churchill by examining 3 of the 15 insect
orders which occur there: Ephemeroptera (mayflies),
Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Trichoptera (caddisflies)
("EPTs"). Although the earliest studies on these groups
began at Churchill more than 60 years ago [6], the species
count is modest. Just 13 mayfly, 16 stonefly, and 18 caddisfly species have been reported from the Churchill area.
The present study has the primary goal of assembling a
comprehensive barcode library for EPT species at this site.
We additionally test how the molecular delineation of
COI (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) barcode haplotype clusters compares with the morphological
species concept and how any difference may affect the
construction of taxon accumulation curves, useful tools
for assessing biodiversity and indicating the completeness
of biotic surveys [7]. Through this work, we provide a first
insight into the feasibility of applying DNA barcoding in
biodiversity registration of a region even if taxonomic
expertise is unavailable. Updated species checklists,
detailed discussions of species boundaries, and faunistic
analysis are considered in a companion paper [8].

Results
Barcoding analyses and DNA barcode reference library
A total of 1500, 564, and 213 COI sequences were recovered from 1644, 565, and 227 Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, and Plecoptera specimens, respectively (see Table S1
in Additional file 1). The failure to generate sequences for
9% of Trichoptera and 6% of Plecoptera specimens was

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/30

not correlated to taxonomic identity, as the failures
involved individuals belonging to morphospecies with
sequence records in the dataset. Thus, no additional optimization of analytical protocols was undertaken for these
two groups. The success rate in generating COI sequences
in mayflies rose from 89.4% to 99.8% upon employing
the newly designed reverse mini primer (MEPTR1-t1, see
Materials and Methods). For example, its use reversed the
consistent failure of PCR amplification in one mayfly species, Paraleptophlebia praepedita (Eaton), that was encountered using routine barcoding primers (LepF1/LepR1 and
LCO1490/HCO2198).
Detailed information about each voucher specimen (taxonomic assignment and identifier, repository, collection
details, image, COI sequence, and tracefiles) is available
in the Barcode of Life Data System [9] in a series of publicly accessible projects 'Ephemeroptera of Churchill',
'Plecoptera of Churchill', and 'Trichoptera of Churchill
2002/2004/2005/2006/2007'. COI sequences are also
published in GenBank under accession numbers
GU113533-GU115809.
Barcode divergence and species diversity
Sixty-eight caddisfly, 37 mayfly, and 7 stonefly morphological species were discovered during this study, the
majority of which were new records for the region. We
found that members of 7 species groups, representing 16
morphospecies, were easily confused in field sorting due
to subtle diagnostic characters or uncertainty in the identification of females or larvae (Figs. 1, 2 and 3, highlighted
in green blocks. See Table S2 in Additional file 2 for distance values). However, these taxa were readily detected
by barcodes and their species status was supported by further morphological scrutiny [8].

Deep interspecific divergences at COI were present
between most Churchill EPT morphospecies (Figs. 1, 2
and 3, and see Table S3 in Additional file 3). Sharing of
barcodes by different species was not observed, and all
morphospecies formed monophyletic clusters in the NJ
tree. However, several morphospecies possessed relatively
high intraspecific COI divergences (those with intraspecific divergences larger than 2% are highlighted in red on
terminal branches, Figs. 1, 2 and 3). The search for morphological differences between these deeply divergent lineages was not productive. However, many clusters in
question were represented by only a few identifiable individuals (typically males), prohibiting a comprehensive
search for diagnostic morphological characters. Although
these deeply divergent barcode haplogroups may reflect
cryptic species, additional sampling of specimens and/or
independent molecular markers is required to draw solid
conclusions [10].

Red and pink bars in the outer circles represent the maximum intraspecific divergence and minimum distance to nearest neighbour, respectively, of the corresponding species
shown in the circular tree. The heights of the two distance
bars are proportional to the distance values (see Table S3 in
Additional file 3). Two possible cryptic caddisfly species, Limnephilus sansoni and Cheumatopsyche campyla (Ross), are highlighted in yellow blocks.

In all species except the caddisfly Limnephilus sansoni
(Banks) (Fig. 1, highlighted in yellow block), no overlap
of the maximum intraspecific divergence and the minimum distance to its nearest neighbouring taxon was
observed (Figs. 1, 2 and 3, represented in red and pink
bars in outer circles, respectively). In 74%, 78%, and 86%
of the Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, and Plecoptera species, respectively, the minimum distance to the nearest
neighbour was more than ten-fold greater than the maximum intraspecific divergence, including species with relatively high intraspecific divergence.
Barcode clusters vs. morphological species
To test the correlation between barcode clusters and morphospecies (but not to define species, see Materials and
Methods), we used an arbitrary 2% threshold to delimit

lineages, to be used in the construction of species accumulation curves. This molecular delineation resulted in a
similar but not identical conclusion regarding the number
of taxonomic entities present in each order (see Table S1
in Additional file 1), with all discrepancies involving the
species possessing high intraspecific COI divergences (Fig.
4). For example, there were 68 trichopteran morphospecies but 77 barcode clusters. Species accumulation curves
based on barcode clusters and morphospecies were very
similar, both in shape and taxon diversity (Fig. 5). These
similarities reflect the fact that both methods are measuring nearly the same information in all three taxonomic
groups. Thus, for the EPTs of Churchill, barcode clusters
delineated with a 2% threshold provide a close estimation
to the morphological species concept employed by experienced taxonomists. The rescaled phylogenetic diversity
(PD) curves, a threshold-free concept of genetic diversity
that is measured by total branch lengths in a tree [[11], see
Materials and Methods for details], followed a very similar
shape to the species accumulation curves, but rose more
rapidly initially and then leveled off, a pattern consistent
across the three orders. Finally, the completeness of the
biodiversity survey as suggested by the trend of each curve
is highly congruent for all three biodiversity quantification methods.

Discussion
Assembling the barcode reference library for the Churchill
EPTs
The clustering pattern of COI barcodes generated from
nearly 2,500 specimens provided a swift overview of
Churchill's EPT diversity. DNA barcodes also greatly facilitated the grouping of individuals into putative species,
which were subsequently validated through morphological scrutiny by taxonomic experts. Consequently, these
COI barcodes have become vouchered reference
sequences for the EPT groups at Churchill. Despite the fact
that taxonomic revisions may be necessary for several species, e.g., Oecetis ochracea (Curtis), O. inconspicua
(Walker), and Fallceon thermophilos (McDunnough) complexes [8], future taxonomic revisions will not compromise the efficiency of species identification using DNA
barcodes. Unnamed species and unidentifiable individuals/life stages can also be registered in the barcode library
and will be subsequently linked to a specific name when
a new species description or identifiable material becomes
available.

Although built at one locale, the Churchill EPT barcode
reference library is informative for a much broader geographic range of North America. For example, 22 of the 68
Churchill caddisfly species possess Holarctic distributions, and another 21 are broadly distributed in the Nearctic. Many of the latter species occur at southerly sites,
reflecting their derivation from lineages that survived the

Pleistocene glaciation in southern refugia [12]. Interestingly, the COI sequences for conspecifics from different
regions are usually very similar in the EPTs (Zhou, unpublished). Of course, the full understanding of the effects of
isolation in southern regufia and the role of subsequent
postglacial range expansion on COI divergence patterns in
widespread Nearctic aquatic insects requires widespread
sampling and statistical investigation, which has only
been performed in a few taxa [e.g., [13,14]]. Nevertheless,
the Churchill barcode reference library remains valuable
for identifying EPT species with transcontinental distributions, especially when it is combined with libraries built
from samples collected at other geographic localities in
North America. These libraries already provide good coverage for the most common species, the ones that are regularly encountered in biodiversity surveys and biological
ecosystem assessments. Ongoing targeted surveys in New
Brunswick, Ontario, and in the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina are contributing to the extension of this continental library.
A novel approach to registering biodiversity and to
revealing new species
Limited access to taxonomic expertise has become a serious impediment to large-scale biodiversity surveys. The
present study shows that a comprehensive DNA barcode
library built on expertly identified specimens enables fast

and accurate species identification by anyone with access
to sequencing facilities. Both standard Sanger sequencing
for barcoding individual samples and massively parallel
pyrosequencing for analyzing bulk environmental samples will undoubtedly become more widespread and less
expensive over time, facilitating ecological and monitoring applications of the barcode library. Continued interaction with the taxonomic community during barcodebased biodiversity and monitoring studies, involving submitting specimens with novel sequences for determination or revision, will ensure the growth and maintenance
of a high-quality database.
Furthermore, the close correspondence between morphospecies and barcode clusters indicates that biodiversity
surveys in new regions need not depend upon immediate
access to taxonomic expertise. Instead, preliminary evaluations can be made using barcodes. Obviously, deeper
understanding of natural communities--the major goal of
biological surveys--requires establishing the linkage
between each barcode cluster and its Linnaean name to
access the biological information that has been accumulated through past studies. However, barcode sequences
alone provide an excellent overview of species diversity,
enabling measures of alpha and beta diversities that
would otherwise only be available after intensive taxonomic study. Latin names will become available for barcode clusters when new records are compared to existing
reference barcode libraries or when no match exists following taxonomic investigation of barcoded specimens.
Barcode data can actually speed the process of taxonomic
assignment by partitioning a large collection of specimens
into a much smaller number of genetic clusters whose taxonomic status can then be assigned. Because of this fact,
barcoding will certainly accelerate the construction of taxonomic systems for groups of little-studied life and aid
revisionary efforts on lineages that are well known. We see
these efforts as complementary.
To designate species or not
In this study, we employed randomized phylogenetic
diversity accumulation curves to test the completeness of
our sampling efforts on three insect orders. This approach
has several key advantages. Foremost, because it is a
threshold-free approach, it makes no assumptions about
species boundaries, allowing its application to any group,
even those lacking a taxonomic system. As would be
expected, PD curves initially rose with a steeper slope than
the taxon accumulation curves, whether morphospecies
or barcode clusters. This difference reflects the fact that
each taxon is treated as equivalent in taxon curves, while
more distantly related species contribute more branch
length and are, hence, more heavily weighted in the PD
analysis. Barring this difference, the different curves had
remarkably similar shapes. However, because the calcula-

barcode library for all species in these orders, this library
will be immediately useful for biodiversity, ecological,
and monitoring studies involving both sexes of adults and
all immature stages.
This study has demonstrated that DNA barcoding holds
great promise as a tool for rapid biodiversity assessment in
unknown faunas. A very close correspondence was
observed between morphospecies as determined by taxonomic experts and barcode clusters designated using a
standard sequence threshold. Several cases of proposed
splitting may reflect cryptic species, which will be
explored in a future contribution [8]. Rapid assessment of
biodiversity will aid the selection of sites of special conservation value and will help to focus the efforts of taxonomists in revising and characterizing the diversity of life.

tion of total PD curves is far more computationally intensive, barcode cluster accumulation curves are the more
efficient way to assess rapidly the completeness of the
biotic surveys.
Prior to drawing a general conclusion about the utility of
PD curves in biotic surveys, several additional explorations should be performed. Different taxonomic groups
from varied geographical regions should be tested. For
example, tropical regions with much greater species diversity should be investigated as they may possess a higher
proportion of intermediate branch lengths, due to lower
extinction rates. In such settings, the advantages of PD
accumulation curves over barcode cluster or thresholdbased methods may become apparent. Other taxonomic
groups could also display different branching patterns
and should be explored. Nevertheless, the pattern of tight
clustering within species and much longer branches
among species seems to be general across a broad range of
animal groups [3,15], including those inhabiting subtropical and tropical environments [16,17].

Conclusion
This study has generated a DNA barcode reference library
for three insect orders--Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and
Trichoptera at one site in the Canadian subarctic. While
we are working towards establishing a comprehensive

Collection site, materials, and identification
Churchill is situated at the confluence of the Churchill
River and Hudson Bay [18]. This region is characterized by
a long, harsh winter and short flight season for aquatic
insects [6]. The area represents an ecotone between northern boreal forest and subarctic tundra habitats.

Mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly specimens were collected
in the Churchill region from 2002 to 2007. Average daily
air temperatures at Churchill in June and September are
typically lower than 7°C [19], conditions that are unsuitable for flight by most caddisflies [20]. As a result, most
collecting activities for caddisflies occurred from late June
to late August of 2006 and 2007. Mayfly samples were
intensively collected during the last two weeks of July in
2007, while stoneflies were contributed by researchers
conducting various bio-surveillance projects in this area
from mid-June to mid-August of 2006 and 2007. A wide
range of lentic and lotic habitats were sampled, including
the Churchill River, tundra ponds, lakes, small streams,
and pools on rock bluffs near the margin of Hudson Bay.
Adult samples were collected using UV light traps, aerial
nets, Malaise traps, and pit-fall traps. Larval samples were
collected using a kicknet and by handpicking. Adult specimens were pinned or preserved in 95% ethanol while all
larval samples were kept in 95% ethanol. EPT specimens
are deposited in the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario, University of Guelph, at the University of Manitoba, and in
the University of Minnesota Insect Collection.
Sequencing of COI barcodes for most EPT samples collected during 2002-2006 was conducted before taxonomic experts became involved so all individuals in the
collections, including dominant species, were sequenced.
Therefore, DNA barcodes should largely reflect the relative
abundances of species in the obtained samples. Speci-

mens were subsequently sorted into groups based on their
COI clustering patterns. Morphological identification was
carried out independently for each of the barcode cluster
series after DNA analysis. Additional EPT specimens collected in 2007 were identified before DNA analysis and
were combined with the library.

DNA analysis and sequence analysis
COI sequences were generated at the Canadian Centre for
DNA Barcoding, University of Guelph. Standard barcoding protocols were followed [21]. Typically, a single leg
was used for the extraction of genomic DNA using an
AcroPrep™ 96 1 ml filter plate (PALL) with 3.0 μm Glass
fiber. DNA was eluted in 40 μl of dH2O. Full-length COI
barcodes (658 bps) were amplified using two primer sets:
LepF1 (5'-ATTCAACCAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3')/LepR1
(5'-TAAACTTCTGGATGTCCAAAAAATCA-3') [22] and
LCO1490 (5'-GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3')/
HCO2198 (5'-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3')
[23]. MLepF1 and MLepR1 primers [16] were employed
when full-length PCR amplification was not successful. A
new reverse mini-primer, tagged with a M13 tail,
MEPTR1-t1
(5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACGGTGGRTATACIGTTCAICC-3') was paired with LCO1490-t1
to recover the first 325 bps of the 5' terminus of barcode
region. This primer set proved to be effective in EPTs, particularly mayflies.

morphospecies assignments in species with >2%
intraspecific divergence in COI barcodes (in all other
cases, the two delineation methods agreed with each
other). Clades of focal species were detached from the original haplotype NJ trees presented in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 and reassembled to a pruned tree using the Interactive Tree of Life
[29]. The number in parentheses next to the haplotype name
indicates the number of sequences sharing the haplotype.
The square brackets to the right of the tree represent the
haplogroup delineated by a 2% threshold.

COI sequences were aligned in MEGA 4.0 [26] using the
integrated ClustalX method with default parameters. The
amino acid translation was examined to ensure that no
gaps or stop codons were present in the alignment.
Unique haplotypes for each species were recognized using
analytical tools available at the "DNA Barcoding Tools"
website http://www.ibarcode.org[27]. These haplotypes
were then imported into MEGA for tree construction
using the Neighbour-Joining method with pair-wise deletion of missing sites and Kimura-2-Parameter (K2P) distance [28] options. A Newick format tree was exported
from MEGA and was annotated using an online tool for
phylogenetic tree display--Interactive Tree of Life [29].
Genetic distances were obtained using sequence analytic

Randomized taxon accumulation curves based on molecular and morphological taxon delineations and total phylogenetic diverFigure 5
sity
Randomized taxon accumulation curves based on molecular and morphological taxon delineations and total
phylogenetic diversity. Taxon accumulation curves based on barcode haplogroups and morphospecies were constructed in
EstimateS V.8.0 using 50 random replicates and default settings. The phylogenetic diversity (PD) accumulation curve was constructed in R using the packages APE and CAIC (see Methods and Additional file 4). PD values were multiplied by a scaling factor so the end points of the PD and barcode threshold curves would be the same, aiding comparison of the shapes of these
curves. As more Churchill EPT individuals are sampled, biodiversity accumulates at a similar rate regardless of how it is quantified, suggesting that all methods applied here could be used in biodiversity assessment. Barcode clusters are more rapidly
obtained and efficiently analyzed than morphospecies or total PD.

tools ("Nearest Neighbour Summary") provided in BOLD
using K2P distances for all sequences longer than 350 bps.
Testing barcode cluster delineation and the morphological
species concept
The morphological identifications employed in this work
are based on current nomenclature for each taxonomic
group. All valid species are morphologically distinguishable from others and possess consistent diagnostic character sets, even though barcode sequences may show
distinctive groups within such morphological species. To
aid the discussion, we refer to the units recognized
through morphological study as 'morphospecies'
throughout this paper.

To test how patterns of genetic divergence at COI correspond to morphological species concepts, we estimated
the Churchill EPT species diversity based on the similarity
and clustering pattern in their COI barcodes independent
of taxonomic assignments. We employed an arbitrary
threshold of 2% sequence divergence to draw boundaries
for barcode haplotype clusters. This arbitrary threshold is
selected due to the fact that intraspecific divergences
observed in a variety of groups rarely exceed this value [see

[3,22], and [30]]. Although exceptions have been
observed in some taxa [e.g., [31,32]], we emphasize that
the species definition used in this work is not based on
any genetic threshold, but on concordant evidence from
morphology and barcode similarity. We seek only to
determine if such a simple delimitation of mitochondrial
COI haplogroups for Churchill's EPTs could be informative in evaluating the trend and completeness of general
biological sampling, even if taxonomic expertise were not
available.
Taxon accumulation curves were constructed to assess the
degree of completeness of this survey and to compare the
results that would be obtained with and without access to
taxonomic expertise. Randomized accumulation curves
were built based on morphospecies determined by taxonomists (XZ, LMJ, and RED) and on barcode clusters as
delimited using a 2% threshold, using EstimateS V.8.0
[33] with 50 randomization replicates and default settings.
Additionally, the correspondence between these two
measures and the total phylogenetic diversity was
explored. DNA sequences were formatted for the program

R version 2.8.1 [34] and analyzed using the packages APE
[35] and CAIC [36]. A Neighbour-Joining tree based upon
K2P distances and pair-wise deletion was reconstructed.
For each tip number, ranging from 1 up to the total sample size of individuals, tips were randomly sampled 1,000
times. At each replicate, total phylogenetic diversity was
calculated and then averaged across randomizations for
each tip number. A detailed protocol along with all commands used is provided in Additional file 4. Resulting
phylogenetic diversity values were multiplied by a scaling
factor to allow their presentation on the same scale as the
species accumulation curves, aiding comparison of their
shapes.
