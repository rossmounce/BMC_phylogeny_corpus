Abstract
Background: Genes that are co-expressed tend to be involved in the same biological process.
However, co-expression is not a very reliable predictor of functional links between genes. The
evolutionary conservation of co-expression between species can be used to predict protein
function more reliably than co-expression in a single species. Here we examine whether coexpression across multiple species is also a better prioritizer of disease genes than is co-expression
between human genes alone.
Results: We use co-expression data from yeast (S. cerevisiae), nematode worm (C. elegans), fruit
fly (D. melanogaster), mouse and human and find that the use of evolutionary conservation can
indeed improve the predictive value of co-expression. The effect that genes causing the same
disease have higher co-expression than do other genes from their associated disease loci, is
significantly enhanced when co-expression data are combined across evolutionarily distant species.
We also find that performance can vary significantly depending on the co-expression datasets used,
and just using more data does not necessarily lead to better prioritization. Instead, we find that
dataset quality is more important than quantity, and using a consistent microarray platform per
species leads to better performance than using more inclusive datasets pooled from various
platforms.
Conclusion: We find that evolutionarily conserved gene co-expression prioritizes disease
candidate genes better than human gene co-expression alone, and provide the integrated data as a
new resource for disease gene prioritization tools.

Background
In the past few years several bioinformatic tools and
approaches have been developed to assist medical genetic
researchers in positional candidate disease gene identification (reviewed in [1]; see also [2-5]). Several tools use
functional genomics to prioritize candidate genes located
within disease-associated genomic loci by evaluating
functional relationships between known disease genes

and positional candidate genes [6-8]. These tools are
based on the premise that genes which are involved in the
same disease phenotype are likely to be functionally
related [1,9,10]. This has indeed been shown to be the
case as evidenced by the fact that these tools all perform
better than random expectation in the prediction or prioritization of candidate disease genes. Nevertheless, not all
types of functional genomic data perform equally well in

terms of sensitivity and specificity [2,7,8]. Microarray
expression data have wider coverage than other highthroughput genomic data such as protein-protein interactions, as genome-scale expression analyses are readily and
routinely performed with them. Additionally, they are less
biased toward better studied genes than gene function
annotation or literature mining, although the latter
approaches fare better at prioritizing disease candidate
genes [2,7,8]. Therefore, given the large coverage of coexpression data and their complementarity to functional
annotation and literature mining, it is of importance to
maximize the disease gene predictive value of this type of
data.

non-causative candidate genes from the same disease loci.
Using co-expression data from five eukaryotic species –
baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), nematode worm
(Caenorhabditis elegans), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster),
mouse (Mus musculus) and human – we investigated the
effect of evolutionary conservation on the ranking of the
disease gene pairs, finding that evolutionary conservation
of co-expression does indeed improve disease gene ranking. Therefore, exploiting evolutionary conservation
could potentially improve the performance of co-expression data in existing disease candidate gene prioritization
tools [2,6-8], which might in turn improve the prioritization of less well-studied genes.

Several bioinformatic candidate disease gene prioritization tools already incorporate microarray-based coexpression data [2,6-8,11,12]. This approach is based on
the assumption that if two genes are functionally related
then their expression should vary concordantly across tissues and under different circumstances, and proposes that
their expression profiles should therefore be correlated.
For candidate disease gene prioritization, the use of coexpression analysis is preferable to the use of tissue-specific gene expression patterns, as it is a better predictor of
functional relatedness between genes [13].

Results

However, co-expression data can be applied more comprehensively than is currently implemented by these
tools. One important and currently underexploited
approach is to incorporate co-expression data from other
species. One might expect that while human co-expression data are the most relevant for disease gene prioritization, evolutionary conservation of co-expression can be
used to enhance the reliability of identified co-expression
relationships. The premise is that co-expression relationships that are maintained across phylogenetically distant
organisms must be under selective pressure, and should
therefore be functional – a premise that has indeed been
confirmed in several previous studies [14-17]. Though
one tool already includes multi-species co-expression data
[11], the improvement in disease gene ranking performance due to the exploitation of evolutionary conservation
has not yet been investigated.
We therefore investigated the predictive value of conserved co-expression for candidate disease gene prioritization. To this end we analyzed how well co-expression
between known and candidate disease genes could prioritize positional candidate disease genes. We restricted our
analysis to known disease genes from genetic diseases
containing at least two known causative genes. We constructed artificial loci of 100 candidate genes around the
known disease-causing genes, and investigated the tendency of these causative genes to have higher co-expression with other known causative genes compared to the

Evolutionary conservation of co-expression improves
disease gene ranking performance
We investigated how well disease genes tend to rank relative to non-causative candidate disease genes when
ranked according to co-expression with other genes
known to cause the same disease. We combined coexpression scores across species using orthology relationships from the euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous Groups
(KOG) database [18]. The co-expression scores are thus
based on these KOGs rather than on individual genes (see
methods section for further details). We used expression
data from human, mouse, fruit fly (D. melanogaster),
worm (C. elegans) and baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae) assembled from the Gene Expression Omnibus database [19]
and the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Foundation
[20] Gene Atlas expression data. For this study we used
artificial disease loci containing 100 genes per locus. Testing with 50, 100 and 200 genes per locus does not make
much difference though smaller loci tend to perform
slightly better than larger loci (data not shown). Only disease gene pairs with co-expression scores unlikely to occur
randomly in the corresponding dataset (i.e. more than 2
standard deviations from the dataset randomization
mean) were included in the final rankings. This process
implicitly weighs the scores according to the number of
species involved, as the random score distributions are
narrower for datasets combining more species. The standard deviations of these randomized distributions range
from 0.051 for the five-species combined dataset to
between 0.057 (yeast) and 0.094 (mouse) for the individual single-species datasets. Therefore, a given correlation
score is more likely to be considered significant in a multispecies dataset than in a single-species dataset.

Genes whose co-expression is conserved through evolution have been shown to have stronger functional ties
than genes whose co-expression is not [17]. Therefore,
conserved co-expression between species should improve
disease gene ranking over co-expression in one species
alone. Such a trend is indeed apparent (Figure 1). Both for

Evolutionary conservation of co-expression improves disease candidate gene prioritization performance over human-only coFigure 1
expression
Evolutionary conservation of co-expression improves disease candidate gene prioritization performance over
human-only co-expression. The disease gene rank histogram shows the relative proportions of disease genes scoring in different rank bins based on co-expression with known disease genes causing the same disease. Disease gene rank indicates its
degree of co-expression with known disease genes, relative to those of the other locus candidate genes. Evolutionary conservation results in a much higher proportion of disease genes ranking in the top 10% of the locus candidate genes and fewer in
the mid-regions of the lists. A) Disease gene rank histogram. B) Cumulative proportion of disease genes detected as the coexpression rank threshold is decreased from 1 to 0.

human and for multi-species KOG-based co-expression
sets, disease gene pairs generally score in the upper half of
the co-expression rankings for the KOG-mappable genes
in the disease loci and are significantly better than random expectation (medians 0.64 and 0.69 for human-only
and conserved co-expression sets respectively; p << 10-16
for both sets, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Therefore, the
causative disease gene in a candidate locus will generally
rank higher than the other locus candidate genes. Furthermore, the multi-species combined co-expression set performs significantly better than the human-only coexpression set (medians 0.64 and 0.69 respectively, p <
10-6, Wilcoxon rank sum test), indicating that the use of
evolutionary conservation can significantly improve coexpression-based candidate disease gene ranking.
Given that co-expression-based disease gene ranking is
only sensible if there is a non-random co-expression relationship between the disease genes, we further narrowed
down the analysis to only those disease gene pairs that are
likely to be genuinely co-expressed, having scores that are
unlikely to occur randomly in their datasets. This substantially improves the rankings (Figure 2), at the expense of

reduced coverage (695 versus 3286 disease gene rankings). Both the human-only and the conserved co-expression datasets now rank the disease genes very high
(medians of 0.87 and 0.93 respectively), with the conserved co-expression still significantly outperforming the
human-only co-expresssion (p < 10-11, Wilcoxon rank
sum test). A much higher proportion of disease genes is
now ranked in the top 10% of the candidate gene lists,
and the use of evolutionary conservation increases this
proportion by almost half, from 31% to 44% of the
ranked disease genes.
Disease gene ranking improved by co-expression
conservation at different evolutionary distances
Evolutionary conservation across multiple species clearly
improves the disease gene ranking performance of gene
co-expression. However, what influence might different
evolutionary distances have on this improvement? Is the
evolutionary distance between human and mouse sufficient to improve co-expression performance, and is yeast
biology so divergent that it would reduce rather than
improve performance? To examine the role of evolutionary distance on the disease gene ranking performance of

gene co-expression, we conducted pairwise comparisons
in which we compared the ranking performance human
co-expression with co-expression conserved between
human and each of the other species. For all pairwise
comparisons except the human-yeast comparison, evolutionary conservation significantly improves co-expression-based disease gene ranking compared to using only
data for human genes (Figure 3, Table 1). Surprisingly,
even human-mouse conservation improves disease gene
ranking despite the relatively short evolutionary distance
between these two species.
In contrast to the other species, co-expression conservation with yeast does not significantly improve disease
gene ranking (Table 1). For this species pair yeast-only coexpression performs best, outperforming even the combined human-yeast set at ranking human disease genes
(albeit not significantly; p = 0.26). This is primarily due to
specific disease types involving housekeeping processes
such as metabolism (congenital disorder of glycosylation,
glycogen storage disease) and DNA repair (xeroderma pigmentosum) which consistently score well particularly in
the yeast set. As yeast co-expression already performs very
well, the combination with human co-expression may not
yield much extra information. However, this performance
comes at the expense of much reduced coverage of disease

genes relative to the other sets, which all have a similar
coverage (550 disease gene rankings for the human-yeast
set, versus ~3000 for human-mouse, human-fly and
human-worm sets). It is thus evident that despite the large
evolutionary distance between these two species, yeast coexpression is still effective at ranking human disease genes
for those genes that have orthologs in both species.
Disease gene ranking performance is dependent on coexpression data used
We initially used the multi-species co-expression dataset
from Stuart and colleagues [21], but this resulted in limited disease gene ranking performance. We suspected that
the extensive pooling of expression data from different
platforms might have a negative impact on performance.
Therefore, we created our own custom multi-species coexpression dataset, in which we restricted ourselves to a
single microarray platform per species. Consistent with
the findings of others [22,23], this single platform
approach resulted in significantly better performance,
even when using only the four species included in the Stuart et al. dataset (Figure 4). Though both datasets tend to
rank disease genes highly, the new (GEO/GNF) dataset
performs significantly better than the larger and more
inclusive dataset from Stuart and colleagues (p < 10-10,
Wilcoxon rank sum test) without loss of coverage (3286

relative expression levels of genes across conditions and
not in total gene expression levels, we normalized all
expression values according to the total expression level of
the microarray sample (see methods section for further
details). This reduces systematic biases between samples
due to differences in total expression levels and highlights
the expression relationships between genes per sample,
resulting in up to 5% improvement in candidate disease
gene ranking (data not shown).

In this study, we show that we can increase the predictive
value of co-expression for disease gene prioritization by
exploiting evolutionary conservation, despite the variations in the biology of the species compared. Given a genuine co-expression relationship between the disease
genes, using conserved co-expression to prioritize candiKOG−based disease gene rankings (Hs, Dm, Ce, Sc)

date disease genes can reduce the number of genes to be
tested over sevenfold compared to using a random ranking of the candidate disease genes, as the correct gene will
be found on average after testing 7% of the candidates
(the median disease gene rank is 0.93) instead of 50%
(Figure 2). Encouragingly, even human-mouse conservation can lead to a substantial improvement in disease gene
ranking performance, despite the relatively short evolutionary distance between these two species (Figure 3).
This means that improvements in specificity can be
gained without large losses in sensitivity, as most human
genes have mouse orthologs.
An interesting finding is that large pooled datasets which
combine as many expression data as possible from various experiments and platforms can actually result in
reduced co-expression performance relative to smaller but
more coherent expression datasets (Figure 4). Microarray
data are notoriously variable between independently generated datasets while they are somewhat more consistent
between experiments using the same platform [22,23]. In
order to minimize dilution of the co-expression signal
when combining data from many different sources a
weighting scheme is required, such as using the co-expression overlap between different sets to weigh the relevance
of the co-expression value [25]. Our results are consistent
with these previously reported findings, as our single-platform-per-species dataset ranks disease genes significantly
better than the more inclusive pooling approach adopted
earlier by Stuart and colleagues [21]. An alternative explanation would be that their expression sets are of lower
quality or are less representative of the relationships
between disease genes, but there is no reason to assume
that either of these is the case. This underscores the fact
that combining as many data as possible does not necessarily lead to an improved performance of co-expression
data for disease gene prioritization, so it is therefore not a
trivial finding that combining data from different species
does.
Another reason why the larger sets do not perform as well
as the smaller sets could lie in the use of correlation coefficients to determine genetic relatedness. Correlation coefficients estimate expression coherence across all
conditions surveyed, but even functionally related genes
may not have coherent expression patterns across all tissues and conditions. The larger the datasets, the greater
the potential for irrelevant conditions to mask the coexpression relationship that a group of genes has under a
limited set of conditions. Therefore, a biclustering-based
approach [26,27] may yield more refined co-expression
relationships between genes, and is a potential avenue for
future improvement of co-expression-based disease candidate gene prioritization.

Conclusion
We analyze here the predictive power of gene co-expression for disease gene prioritization and identify factors
that affect it, such as evolutionary conservation. We show
that co-expression data from other species have predictive
power for human disease gene prioritization, and that
evolutionarily conserved gene co-expression can improve
disease gene prioritization over human-only gene coexpression. In addition, we show that platform consistency is important and that smaller but more cohesive
datasets can outperform larger pooled datasets. Though
we only examined disease gene ranking, these findings
have broader relevance for the use of microarray coexpression data in functional genomics. We provide these
conserved co-expression data as a new resource that can
be used in disease gene prioritization programs, particularly those that integrate several different data types.

Methods
Disease data
We used the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM) [28] Morbid Map as a source of genetic diseases
and known disease genes. We restricted our analysis to
those diseases with two or more known disease genes.
There were 890 known disease genes (727 distinct genes)
for 177 diseases in our dataset. Artificial disease loci were
constructed around these known disease genes based on
localization information from the Ensembl database [29],
by taking the required number of neighboring genes centered on the disease gene. These genes were then translated to HGNC gene IDs [30] or KOG IDs [18] depending
on the analysis. This means that the locus genes used in
the analyses are a subset of the Ensembl genes in the locus,
depending on how many could be mapped to their relevant IDs. We used artificial loci of 100 genes, which is representative for the average candidate disease locus, as the
OMIM heterogeneous disease loci have a median of 88
genes per locus. In addition, we investigated the use of 50and 200-gene artificial loci, as well as actual associated
loci from OMIM Morbid Map, but do not consider them
further as their results did not differ substantially from
those of the 100-gene artificial loci.
Expression data processing
Initially we used the multi-species expression data used by
Stuart and colleagues in their functional analysis of conserved co-expression [21]. This dataset contains expression data for human, fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster),
nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and baker's yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genes. These expression data
had already been normalized and were therefore not further processed prior to their use in the co-expression calculations.

However, due to limited performance of this dataset in
ranking disease genes we created a new multi-species coexpression dataset involving expression data from these
four species and mouse (Mus musculus). For human and
mouse expression data we used the gcRMA-normalized
Gene Atlas expression sets generated by the Genomics
Institute of the Novartis Foundation [20], as this is an
often-used and well-constructed expression dataset. The
expression values were log2-transformed to increase
robustness and emphasize the variation between the
lower expressed genes relative to the more highly
expressed ones. Lacking similar standard expression datasets for the other species, the expression data for fruit fly
(Drosophila melanogaster), nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database [19] of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI). In order to maximize consistency of
the expression data, only one expression platform was
used per species. As these expression data are normalized
in different ways in different experiments, we used the raw
signal intensity data (Affymetrix CEL files) rather than the
normalized expression data. This further restricted the
data available to us, as these raw data are not required for
submission of expression data to the GEO database and
are not included with all datasets. Only experiments with
at least 10 microarray samples were considered. We ended
up with 357 samples in 12 experiments for yeast, 242
samples in 8 experiments for fly and 123 samples in a single experiment for worm (Table 2). For within-array normalization we used the Robust Multi-array Averaging

(RMA) algorithm [31] as implemented in the R statistical
software bioconductor library [32]. However, our
between-array normalization was done by normalizing
for total sample expression (see below), as we found this
to yield better results than RMA-normalizing per experiment (data not shown). Total expression normalization
prevents spurious correlation due to differences in total
expression level between samples. For the yeast and fly
datasets, data were pooled across all experiments before
total expression normalization and calculation of the coexpression correlation coefficients.
The Affymetrix probe set expression levels were translated
to gene expression levels, and for genes that were represented by multiple probe sets the median was taken. These
genes were further filtered according to gene sets used
(Table 3). Both GEO and GNF datasets were further normalized according to total sample expression level by
dividing each gene expression value by the mean expression value of all considered genes in the microarray sample. This further minimizes spurious correlations due to
differences in total expression level between experimental
conditions or across tissues.
No artificial cut-off was used to filter out noisy low expression values, or to define presence or absence of gene
expression in a sample. This is not necessary, as we are
using correlation between expression profiles rather than
absolute expression levels. The inclusion of non-biologically significant noise should not result in spurious correlations between genes, and if there is a correlation

between low expression values then they are probably not
merely noise and should not be filtered out.
It should be noted that while we used log2-transformed
signal intensity values in a multi-species study involving
different microarray platforms, and not relative abundances as Liao & Zhang did [16], our analysis does not suffer from the same problems that led them to use relative
abundances. We do not directly compare expression values between different microarray platforms. Instead, these
expression values are converted to co-expression values
for each platform separately. This process involves only
within-platform signal intensity comparisons. The
between-species – and therefore between-platform – comparisons are done at the co-expression level and involve
comparisons of Spearman rank correlation coefficients.
Co-expression score calculations
We used Spearman rank correlation coefficients as the
microarray signal intensity values were not normally distributed. For the GEO datasets comprising several experiments (the fly and yeast sets), these data were pooled
before gene pair co-expression correlation coefficients
were calculated.

In order to be able to compare co-expression relationships
between species, we used the gene orthology relationships
as defined by the euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous
Groups (KOG) database [18]. We chose to use KOGs
instead of a metagenes-based approach such as was used
by Stuart and colleagues [21] in order to maximize coverage, as KOGs not only contain bidirectional best hits but
also closely related paralogs. The gene to KOG mapping
was done using the STRING database version 6.1 [33].
Mapping of the protein IDs used in STRING to the gene
IDs used on the microarrays was done using Ensembl
BioMart [34]. Of the 13955 human genes with expression
data used in this study 8186 could be mapped to KOGs.
A single pair of KOGs can have multiple co-expression values if one or both of them contain multiple genes per species. In such a case these co-expression scores need to be
combined into a single co-expression score representative
of all pairwise combinations of genes in the two KOGs
(Figure 5). We accomplished this by taking the mean of all

13282
17948
6563

such gene pair co-expression scores, resulting in a single
KOG-based co-expression score (within-species averaging).
In order to incorporate evolutionary conservation into the
final co-expression scores, we took the mean of the species-specific KOG-based co-expression scores over all species considered (between-species averaging). For the
comparison between human and multi-species conserved
co-expression the union of all the sets was taken for maximal coverage – i.e. all KOG-based co-expression scores
were used regardless of which species were represented in
the KOGs.
Disease gene ranking analyses
We investigated the co-expression ranking performance
between candidate disease genes and known disease genes
for each pair of disease genes causing the same disease
(Figure 6). To this end we ordered all co-expression values
between a known disease gene and the genes in a candidate disease locus, and scored the relative rank (0–1) of
the actual causative gene in the resultant list. If the causative gene was at the top of the list it was assigned a relative
rank of 1.0, and if at the bottom it received a relative rank
of 0.0. A score of 0.5 indicates an equal number of more
highly co-expressed and less highly co-expressed non-disease genes in the candidate locus, and is equivalent to random expectation. For each disease each causative gene was
sequentially treated as the known disease gene and tested
against all the other loci.

To avoid ranking candidate disease genes which do not
have any co-expression relationship with each other at all,
we randomly permuted the co-expression datasets used to
determine the random distribution of co-expression
scores for each dataset. We then excluded all disease gene
pairs for which the co-expression score fell within 2 standard deviations of the randomization means. These distributions all had co-expression scores with a mean of
approximately zero and standard deviations ranging
between 0.05 and 0.09 depending on the dataset. Multiple randomizations always resulted in almost identical
score distributions per dataset due to the large numbers
involved.

Procedure for calculating conserved co-expression scores
Procedure for calculating conserved co-expression scores. The procedure is illustrated using an example involving
KOGs KOG0011 and KOG3438 between human and fly. KOG0011 contains two genes in each species (RAD23A, RAD23B
and FBgn0026777, FBgn0039147 in human and fly respectively) while KOG3438 contains one in human (CKS1B) and two in fly
(FBgn0010314 and FBgn0037613). For each species a KOG0011-KOG3438 co-expression (thick purple and green arrows)
correlation is calculated by taking the mean of all gene-gene combinations (thin black arrows) for the two KOGs. The mean of
these species-specific KOG-pair correlations (thick vertical orange arrow) is taken to represent the final multispecies
KOG0011-KOG3438 co-expression correlation. This co-expression value is used for all relevant gene-pairs as their KOGbased co-expression score. If co-expression is conserved in both species then this value will be high, if it is high in only one species it will be intermediate, and if it is low in both it will be low.

To investigate the influence of evolutionary conservation
on disease gene pair ranking performance, humanderived co-expression data were compared with co-expression data averaged across all five species included in the
study. Additionally, pairwise species comparisons were
performed comparing human-only co-expression data
with pairwise conserved co-expression between human
and mouse, fly, worm or yeast.
In order to test for the effect of averaging gene-gene coexpression within KOGs, the performance of the GNF

human expression set when using KOG-based co-expression was compared to its performance when using genebased co-expression.
Tools
The R statistical software package [35] was used for the
microarray data processing and the Spearman rank correlation calculations, as well as for statistical tests and data
plotting. For performance reasons, small custom-written
C++ programs were used to average the gene-gene correlation coefficients into KOG-KOG correlation coefficients,

Figure gene ranking procedure
Disease 6
Disease gene ranking procedure. Co-expression Spearman correlation coefficients (SCC) are determined for all candidate
disease genes from a disease locus with known causative gene (E) and another gene known to cause the same disease (A). The
SCCs are ranked, and the ranks are subsequently normalized to the 0.0–1.0 range. The relative position of the causative gene
in the locus (E) is determined. This procedure would subsequently be repeated with E as known disease gene and A as candidate disease gene. For each disease, each gene is treated as a candidate disease gene in turn and its co-expression is successively compared to all other genes known to cause the same disease, leading to a list of scores per disease.

and the per-species KOG-KOG correlations into cross-species KOG-KOG correlation values. Python scripts were
written for the disease gene correlation coefficient ranking
analyses. All scripts and source code are available on
