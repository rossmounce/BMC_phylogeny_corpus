Abstract
Background: Sesame (Sesamum indicum) is one of the most important oilseed crops with high oil contents and
rich nutrient value. However, genetic improvement efforts in sesame could not get benefit from molecular biology
technology due to poor DNA and RNA sequence resources. In this study, we carried out a large scale of expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) sequencing from developing sesame seeds and further conducted analysis on seed storage
products-related genes.
Results: A normalized and full-length enriched cDNA library from 5 ~ 30 days old immature seeds was
constructed and randomly sequenced, leading to generation of 41,248 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) which then
formed 4,713 contigs and 27,708 singletons with 44.9% uniESTs being putative full-length open reading frames.
Approximately 26,091 of all these uniESTs have significant matches to the counterparts in Nr database of GenBank,
and 21,628 of them were assigned to one or more Gene ontology (GO) terms. Homologous genes involved in oil
biosynthesis were identified including some conservative transcription factors regulating oil biosynthesis such as
LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), PICKLE (PKL), WRINKLED1 (WRI1) and majority of them were found for the first time in
sesame seeds. One hundred and 17 ESTs were identified possibly involved in biosynthesis of sesame lignans,
sesamin and sesamolin. In total, 9,347 putative functional genes from developing seeds were identified, which
accounts for one third of total genes in the sesame genome. Further analysis of the uniESTs identified 1,949 nonredundant simple sequence repeats (SSRs).
Conclusions: This study has provided an overview of genes expressed during sesame seed development. This
collection of sesame full-length cDNAs covered a wide variety of genes in seeds, in particular, candidate genes
involved in biosynthesis of sesame oils and lignans. These EST sequences enriched with full length will contribute
to comparative genomic studies on sesame and other oilseed plants and serve as an abundant information
platform for functional marker development and functional gene study.

Background
Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) belonging to the family
pedaliaceae [1] is one of the most ancient self-pollinated
oilseed crops. Sesame is one of oilseed crops with the
highest oil content of up to 62.7% (average 52%) in
seeds of sesame cultivars and accessions [2] when seed

oil contents of other major oil crops peanut (Arachis
hypogaea), oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and soybean
(Glycine max) contain up to 54.0% (average 50%) [3], up
to 46% (average 39%) [4] and up to 27.9% (average 20%)
[5], respectively. Although recent intensive selection
(imposed on natural variation or hybridization offspring)
aided with high throughput Near-infrared spectroscopy
for seed oil content determination with no seed damage
can lead to more than 50% in oilseed rape, it is still
lower than that having existed in sesame accessions for
long time. Furthermore, sesame seed is highly nutritive
in protein contents of the seed dry weight (25%) and

has distinctive flavor. Sesame oil has excellent stability
due to the existence of the natural antioxidants such as
lignans sesamin, sesamol, sesamolin and sesaminol produced during seed development [6]. These natural antioxidants help to improve health qualities such as
inhibiting Δ5-desaturase in mammals, enhancing vitamin
E bioactivity, and inhibiting proliferation of human cancer cells [7-10]. Sesame lignans may also play a role in
sesame resistance to insect pests and microbial pathogens [11].
The study on synthesis of high oil content and these
antioxidants is poor, partly because of poor DNA and
RNA sequence resources. At present, there are only
about 3,000 sesame EST sequences available in GenBank
[12]. Lack of sequence information and poor understanding of related synthetic biology have hindered
genetic improvement on these economic characters as
well as high unsaturated fatty acids contents in sesame.
Thereby, our objective in this study was to build a large
set of EST collection from developing seeds of sesame.
After construction of a normalized full-length cDNA
library, we carried out large scale sequencing of the
library and obtained more than 40,000 ESTs from developing seeds of high oil content Chinese sesame cultivar
Zhongzhi 14, and further performed bioinformatics analysis on the ESTs with focus on those involved in oil
and lignin biosynthesis. These sequence information will
serve as the public-accessible fundamental resources for
generation of molecular markers, genome annotation,
gene discovery in sesame and comparative genomics
study on oil contents of major oilseed crops.

content and early maturation were analyzed for accumulation of oil, fatty acids and lignans. The results indicated
that the two cultivars have different oil contents but similar profiles of fatty acid compositions (Figure 1). Both cultivars started quick increase in oil contents from 10 days
after pollination to maturation and oil accumulation
reached their peak at about 25 days. Therefore sampling
time was determined as 5, 20 and 30 days after pollination.
Considering annual productivity (1321.5 kg per hectare of
Zhongzhi 14, compared to 425 kg per hectare of Miaoqian) and oil content of seeds, Zhongzhi 14 was selected
for construction of cDNA library enriched in full-length
coding sequences [13] and EST sequencing.
The primary titer of the cDNA library was 1 × 10 6
cfu/mL with more than 90% recombinant clones
revealed by X-Gal/IPTG screening and a small-scale
quality assessment was performed prior to commencement of large-scale sequencing [13]. Plasmid DNAs
were automatically prepared from the cDNA clones and
sequenced from the 5’ end by the Sanger method.
In total, 41,248 ESTs from single-pass 5’ sequencing of
45,569 cDNA clones passed the quality control for high
confidence base call with an average read length of
approximately 570 bp (Figure 2). The overall sequencing
success rate was 91%. The EST sequences generated in
this study were deposited in GenBank with the accession
numbers JK045130-JK086377. The GC content of the
EST sequences was approximately 42.86%. Approximately 32.8% of the 41,248 sequences appeared twice or
more times.

To understand accumulation of oil and lignan, and determine time of sampling developing seeds for EST sequencing, two sesame (S. indicum) cultivars Zhongzhi 14 with
high oil content and its contrast Miaoqian with low oil

After screening of low-quality DNA and trimming of
vector sequences, Phrap program [14] was used to cluster the EST sequences and produce a uniESTs data set
which comprised 4,713 tentative unique contigs (TUCs,
see Additional file 1) and 27,708 tentative unique singletons sequences (TUSs, Table 1). The number of ESTs in

cDNA sequences, only 1,360 sesame uniESTs are matched
to A. thaliana seed genes (338 genes) [16] and 20% of
these genes were involved in translation, ribosomal proteins synthesis, and 17% in posttranslational modification,
protein turnover, chaperones. Only 1% of these genes
were related to lipid transport and metabolism category.

the TUCs ranged from 2 to 92 and there are more than
65.5% contigs with 2 ESTs, 18.2% with 3 ESTs and
15.2% with 4-10 ESTs.
Among these uniESTs sequences, 80.6% had significant
matches to sequences in the non-redundant protein
database (Nr) with an E value cut-off equal or less than
10 -5 . Comparison of our uniESTs data set with the
sesame EST sequence in GenBank using BLASTN
demonstrated that only 349 uniESTs (1.1%) in our data
set had significant matches to 903 sesame ESTs in GenBank (E-values ≤ 10-5) (Relevant information of these
uniESTs was listed in Table 2).
Comparison of the sesame uniESTs against the A. thaliana proteome database using BLASTX indicated 40% of
these uniESTs with significant matches to those from A.
thaliana (E-values ≤ 10-5). Based on identification of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of protein (COGs) [15] (Figure 3), 10,575 uniESTs (33.0%) of sesame seeds were
assigned to COGs by BLASTX. The proportion pattern of
each COG subcategory was similar between sesame and
A. thaliana seeds [16] (Figure 3). In these two sets of

The full-length open reading frames (ORFs) in the uniESTs data set were identified. Homology search of the
32,421 uniESTs using BLASTX identified uniESTs with
relatively high similarity (E-values ≤ 10-5) to known genes,
where the sesame sequences, each had a start codon at a
position similar to the protein sequence in GenBank, form
a data set of putative full-length ORFs (44.9%). Furthermore, the codon usage table (Table 3) for the full-length
sesame ORFs was generated using CODONW. The
sesame (S. indicum) codon usage table containing 14,669
codons showed the GC content of the predicted coding
region (46.7%) and the GC frequency at the third position
(46.4%). The analysis was the first version of sesame
codon usage table which was not presented in the Kazusa
codon usage database http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/.
Gene ontology annotation

A total of 18,549 uniESTs were successfully annotated
with Gene ontology (GO) terms using Blast2GO program [17]. An additional 3,079 sequences were then
annotated using InterProScan program [18]. Overall, a
total of 21,628 uniESTs were annotated with 111,600
GO terms distributing among the three main GO categories. 9,347 tentative unique genes (TUGs) representing 21,628 uniESTs across the various GO terms were
examined with WEGO [19] (Table 4).
Under the category Biological Process, subcategories
“cellular process” and “metabolic process” accounted for
approximately 49.5% and 46.2% of the annotations for
the TUGs, respectively, reflecting activeness of these
processes. There are an overlap which is largely represented by the cellular metabolic process (37.1%) in the
two subcategories and in the subcategory “metabolic

process,” primary metabolic process (36.4%), macromolecule metabolic process (27%) and biosynthesis (19.6%)
account for large proportions, suggesting active metabolism of storage substances such as oil, lignan and proteins. In correspondence to these processes, in the main
category Molecular Function, 41.8% of the TUGs annotations were grouped into the subcategory “binding” and
40.2% in the subcategory “catalytic activity” (Table 4).
Analysis of ESTs involved in oil biosynthesis in
developing sesame seeds

Comparative analysis indicated that the most redundant
genes related to biosynthesis of fatty acid and oil in sesame

included ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), plastidial long-chain acyl-CoA
synthetase (LACS), stearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD), acetylCoA carboxylase (ACC), ketoacyl-CoA reductase (KAR),
oil-body oleosin (OBO), diacylglycerol acyltransferase
(DGAT) etc. 496 uniESTs candidates were homologous to
Arabidopsis oil-related genes (Arabidopsis Lipid Gene
Database http://www.plantbiology.msu.edu) [20](Additional file 2). Of these, 71 uniESTs were mapped to the
sesame genome sequence (Additional file 3 for DNA
sequences of these genes) and just 12 genes like PDHC,
OBO and LACS are homologous to those in the public
sesame ESTs database (Additional file 2).

In the “fatty acid synthesis in the plastids pathway”
[20], most of the key enzymes were found in our data
set, such as the PDHC, ACC, plastidial acyl carrier protein (ACP) and KAR, except an important enzymes malonyl-CoA: ACP malonyltransferase (MCMT). After
blasting against the whole sesame genome assembly, we
found that most of these genes had lower copy numbers
than those in Arabidopsis, except one gene encoding
beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (KAS I) which have 2
copies whereas the genomes of Arabidopsis has 1 copy
(see Additional file 2 and Additional file 3). KAS I catalyzes the elongation of fatty acid synthesis for the carbon chain from C4 to C16, and played a crucial role in
chloroplast division and embryo development [21]. The
main components of sesame seed oil, oleic acid and
linoleic acid, continuously increased up to about 80% of

total fatty acids in the mature seeds (Figure 1). Some
uniESTs related to these fatty acids elongation and desaturation in sesame were first reported in this study, such
as putative full-length uniESTs encoding ketoacyl-ACP
synthase II (KAS II) SAD and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) oleate desaturase (FAD2) which played important
roles in the process of the conversion of 16:0-18:0 and
desaturation.
Triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis occurs at the ER
and probably involves in reactions in the oil body as
well [20]. Only four major genes, DGAT1, phosphatidylcholine: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT), OBO and
caleosin, were detected, which involved in the last step
of the TAG synthesis reaction and oil body formation in
the pathway of synthesis and storage of oil. DGAT1 and
PDAT have been known as the very important genes

greatly affecting oil body formation and oil content [22].
OBO and caleosin were believed to facilitate mobilization of the TAG storage reserves [23,24].
Of 361 (3.9%) annotated uniESTs with putative transcription factor activity, 8 uniESTs were identified
involved in oil accumulation, and they are homologous
to A. thaliana transcription factor (TF) LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (AtLEC1), PICKLE (AtPKL) and WRINKLED1
(AtWRI1), respectively, suggesting their conservation
and importance in transcriptional regulation of the fatty
acid biosynthetic pathway. Of these TFs, putative sesame
LEC1 (SiLEC1) and SiWRI1, like those in Arabidopsis,
are single copies after blasting against whole sesame
genome assembly (Additional file 3 for DNA sequences
of these genes) and the sequence similarity of the two
genes are 47% and 43% between sesame and Arabidopsis, respectively (Additional file 4). AtLEC1 positively
regulates AtWRI1 and a large repertoire of fatty acid
synthetic genes and several glycolytic genes [25]. Overexpression of AtWRI1 in Arabidopsis increased TAG
content in transgenic plants [26] and overexpression of
AtLEC1 and its orthologs in canola (B. napus) caused
an increased fatty acid level in transgenic plants [27].
These homologs identified in sesame may have similar
functions in oil biosynthesis.
Analysis of ESTs involved in lignan biosynthesis in
developing sesame seeds

Two major oil-soluble lignans, sesamin and sesamolin
[28] were quantitatively determined in the seeds of two
cultivars (Zhongzhi 14 and Miaoqian) with contrast oil
contents. Total lignan (sesamin and sesamolin) content

was detectable 15 days after pollination and continuously accumulated until seed maturation (Figure 4).
Interestingly sesamin content continuously increased
from 15 days after pollination to seed maturation while
sesamolin increased to its highest level at 20 days after
pollination, and sesamin content was almost as twice as
that of sesamolin at 30 days after pollination (Figure 4).
In these two cultivars, it is clear that lignan formation
was developmentally regulated [29,30]–lignan accumulation and seed development (maturity) keep the same
pace. With seed development, the conversion ratio into
sesamolin decreased whereas sesamin accumulation
increased (Figure 4).
The antioxidant lignans, sesamin and sesamolin, are
biosynthesized via the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
pathway [29,30]. In the pathway, tyrosine or phenylalanine is first converted into coniferyl alcohol which then
undergoes stereoselective coupling to give pinoresinol,
and further pinoresinol is metabolized in maturing seeds
to piperitol, sesamin and sesamolin which are catalysed
by O2/NADPH cytochrome P450s in the reactions 10,
11, and 14 where methylenedioxy bridges are formed
(Figure 5) [29,30].
One hundred and 17 ESTs, corresponding to 7 EC
numbers (EC1.1.1.195, EC 1.14.13.-, EC 1.14.13.11, EC
1.2.1.44, EC 1.6.2.4, EC 2.1.1.68, EC 6.2.1.12) (Figure 5),
were identified possibly involved in the biosynthesis of
sesame lignans during seed development according to
KEGG blast result. Compared to the Arabidopsis database, 94 ESTs were homologous to 32 genes of Arabidopsis. In the GenBank database, there are just 12
sesame ESTs homologous to 4 uniESTs of our dataset

ESTs (45 putative uniESTs). There are 5 copies of the
gene encoding COMT in the sesame genome (Additional file 6 for DNA sequences of these genes), but this
gene is absent in the genomes of Arabidopsis and soybean. Surprisingly, neither phenylalanine ammonia-lyase
nor tyrosine ammonia-lyase encoded ESTs were
detected in the sesame seed ESTs. Thirty five ESTs of
putative NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase were
identified, which involve in the important steps of
sesame lignan production, including a gene encoding
CYP81Q1 known for dual methylendioxy bridge formation on pinoresinol to produce sesamin via piperitol
[31]. Because little information is available about
enzymes for reactions from sesamin to sesamolin and
from piperitol to sesamolinol [32], ESTs responsible for
these enzymes was not able to be identified.
EST-derived simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers

SSRs) have limited the efficiency of sesame molecular
breeding [35]. Hence development of a large collection
of EST-SSR will be very important source. In total,
1,688 uniESTs containing 1,949 non-redundant (NR)
SSRs were identified from 32,421 uniESTs. The uniESTs
represented about 17.428 Mb of genic sequences. A
total of 226 sequences contain more than one SSR. The
EST-derived NR SSRs were represented by mono-, di-,
tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotide repeat motifs. This corresponds to an overall SSR density of approximately one
SSR per 8.9 kb or one SSR-containing sequence in 5.2%
of the NR EST sequences. About 8.3% of the SSRs identified were compound SSRs, which were defined as two
neighbouring repeats located less than 10 nucleotides
apart in a single sequence. The frequencies of the SSR
motifs identified from 32,421 uniESTs were summarized
in Table 5. Based on the distribution of SSR motifs, AG/
CT motifs represented the most abundant dinucleotide
repeat motifs (about 68%). The most common trinucleotide repeat motifs are, AAG/CTT (21%) and the most
abundant tetranucleotide repeat motifs are the AAGT/
ATTC (13%) (Figure 6).

Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences were sowed
in two neighbouring plots of a field in the institute
farm. Flowers were tagged in the early morning of the
flower opening days. Developing capsules were harvested at 5-50 days or 30 days for early mature Miaoqian after pollination and seeds were immediately
isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction or dried for seed chemical determination. Frozen
seeds were stored at-70°C until use.
Method for determination of sesame seed fatty acid

Fresh sesame seeds isolated from capsules were dried
and ground for solvent extraction (soxlhet method).
Fatty acid composition of oil was determined by the GC
method according to the National Standards methods of
China GB14489.3-1993-T, GBT 17376-2008, and
GBT17377-2008 (the Official Methods and Recommended Practices of China). Heptadecanoic acid (17:0)
was added to each sample as an internal standard. Oil
contents were calculated from the total fatty acids
contents.
HPLC analysis of lignans

Conclusion
This study provided a set of ESTs enriched in full-length
coding sequence generated from developing seeds. The
number of these ESTs is more than 12.4 fold of the total
number of entries for sesame in GenBank. From this set of
ESTs, 9,347 putative functional genes from developing
seeds were identified, accounting for one third of total
genes in the genome. Most of the transcripts are the first
representatives from sesame seeds. Most key enzymes and
regulatory factors involved in fatty acid metabolism were
found in our data, especially the enzymes responsible for
the main unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, TAG synthesis
reactions and oil body formation. Some conservative TFs
significantly regulating oil synthesis were also identified.
These provide a foundation for future comparative analysis of oil biosynthesis of different oilseeds. The uniESTs
associated with biosynthetic enzymes of sesame lignans,
sesamin and sesamolin, were identified and this information will be helpful for further studies on sesame lignan
production. This large number of ESTs, half of them with
full-length, have been used for sesame genome annotation
in our sesame genome sequencing project and will be useful resource for the functional gene analysis and molecular
marker development of traits such as contents of oil, fatty
acids and lignan in sesame and for comparative genomics
study of seed oil biosynthesis in different oilseed plants.

Lignans were determined by the HPLC method according to the National Standards methods of China NY/T
1595-2008. Sesamol was used as internal standards for
calculating the percentage recovery of lignans.
RNA extraction

Total RNA was isolated from developing seeds of
sesame (cv. Zhongzhi 14) 5, 20, 30 days after pollination,
respectively, and mixed in the same proportion, with
TRIzol reagent (Gibco-BRL) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Poly A + RNA isolation was performed using PolyA Tract Isolation System (Promega,
USA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Generation of ESTs

Construction of a normalized cDNA library enriched in
full-length sequences was reported [13]. The titer of
unamplified cDNA library was about 1.0 × 106 cfu/mL.
The percentage of recombinants was 100%. The results
of gel electrophoresis showed fragments ranged from
700 bp to 2,000 bp, with an average length of 1,800 bp.
The cDNA clones were cultured for plasmid DNA preparation manually. Automated cycle sequencing was
performed by the Sanger method using T3 universal primer and BigDye Terminator (Applied Biosystems, USA)
or ET Terminator (Amersham Pharmacia Bioscience,
USA).

Non-redundant SSR motifs were derived from 32,421 uniESTs.

the vector and adapter sequences, followed by EST-trimmer http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.De/misa/download/est_trimmer.pl to eliminate 3’ polyA and 100 bp EST reads.
Phrap program was used to cluster the overlapping
ESTs into contigs. Groups that contained only one
sequence were classified as singletons. The edited EST
was translated into six reading frames and compared
with the non-redundant protein database at the National

Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the
Arabidopsis thaliana Database at The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) http://www.arabidopsis.org/
using BLASTX program with the default settings (NCBI,
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). BLASTN program was
used to compare our nucleotide sequences with the
sequences in the EST database in GenBank. BLASTX
and BLASTN results with E-values cut-off 1e-10-5 were
treated as ‘significant matches,’ whereas ESTs with no

Assignment of GO terms

Gene Ontology (GO) terms were assigned to UniESTs
by using Blast2GO [17] and summarized according to
their molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components. The software performed BLASTX
similarity search against the GenBank non-redundant
protein (Nr) database, retrieved GO terms for the top
12 BLAST results and annotated the sequences based
on defined criteria. A weightage based on the default
Evidence Code Weights was also used to determine
the GO terms annotated. In order to increase the
number of sequences annotated by GO terms, additional information and GO terms were obtained by
comparing the sequences to the InterPro database
using the InterProScan tool [18]. More detailed functional annotations were performed by mapping tentative unique genes (TUGs) to the Gene Ontology
Consortium structure which provided a structured and
controlled vocabulary to describe gene products
according to three ontologies: cellular components,
biological processes and molecular functions. The distribution and percentage of TUGs in each of the GO
terms were calculated. The GO terms were compared
and visualized using WEGO http://wego.genomics.org.
cn[19]. The percentage of 100 was defined as the total
number of TUGs that were assigned GO terms. However, the percentages of the subcategories did not add
up to 100% because many genes were involved in different classes of function and therefore annotated by
multiple GO terms.
