Abstract
Background: Aphids possess bacteriocytes, which are cells specifically differentiated to harbour
the obligate mutualist Buchnera aphidicola (γ-Proteobacteria). Buchnera has lost many of the genes
that appear to be essential for bacterial life. From the bacteriocyte of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon
pisum, we previously identified two clusters of expressed sequence tags that display similarity only
to bacterial genes. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that they are encoded in the aphid genome.
In this study, in order to assess the possibility of lateral gene transfer, we determined the full-length
sequences of these transcripts, and performed detailed structural and phylogenetic analyses. We
further examined their expression levels in the bacteriocyte using real-time quantitative RT-PCR.
Results: Sequence similarity searches demonstrated that these fully sequenced transcripts are
significantly similar to the bacterial genes ldcA (product, LD-carboxypeptidase) and rlpA (product,
rare lipoprotein A), respectively. Buchnera lacks these genes, whereas many other bacteria,
including Escherichia coli, a close relative of Buchnera, possess both ldcA and rlpA. Molecular
phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that the aphid ldcA was derived from a rickettsial
bacterium closely related to the extant Wolbachia spp. (α-Proteobacteria, Rickettsiales), which are
intracellular symbionts of various lineages of arthropods. The evolutionary origin of rlpA was not
fully resolved, but it was clearly demonstrated that its double-ψ β-barrel domain is of bacterial
origin. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that ldcA and rlpA are expressed 11.6 and 154fold higher in the bacteriocyte than in the whole body, respectively. LdcA is an enzyme required
for recycling murein (peptidoglycan), which is a component of the bacterial cell wall. As Buchnera
possesses a cell wall composed of murein but lacks ldcA, a high level of expression of the aphid ldcA
in the bacteriocyte may be essential to maintain Buchnera. Although the function of RlpA is not well
known, conspicuous up-regulation of the aphid rlpA in the bacteriocyte implies that this gene is also
essential for Buchnera.
Conclusion: In this study, we obtained several lines of evidence indicating that aphids acquired
genes from bacteria via lateral gene transfer and that these genes are used to maintain the obligately
mutualistic bacterium, Buchnera.

Background
Aphids are hemipteran insects that have close associations
with various lineages of microorganisms. Most aphid spe-

cies harbour the obligate mutualist (usually called primary symbiont), Buchnera aphidicola (γ-Proteobacteria),
within the cytoplasm of specialized cells called bacterio-

cytes [1-4]. Since the initial infection more than 100 million years ago [5], Buchnera have been subjected to strict
vertical transmission through host generations, and the
mutualism between Buchnera and their host has evolved
to the point that neither can reproduce in the absence of
the other. Buchnera cannot proliferate outside bacteriocytes and, when deprived of Buchnera, the host insects suffer retarded growth and sterility, as they are obligately
dependent on Buchnera for the supply of essential nutrients they cannot synthesize, and which are scarce in their
diet of phloem sap [4,6-9]. During the process of co-evolution with the host, Buchnera has lost a number of genes
that appear to be essential for bacterial existence (the
genomes of Buchnera range from 420 to 650 kb in size and
contain 400 to 600 genes; [10-13]); this raises the question of how Buchnera survive within the host bacteriocyte.
One of several possible explanations for the absence of
these genes is that some genes were transferred from the
genome of an ancestor of Buchnera to the genome of an
aphid ancestor and are now expressed under the control
of the host nucleus. Such lateral gene transfer (LGT)
should take place in the germ line for the transferred gene
to be inherited through the generations of the recipient.
During most of their life stages, Buchnera are confined
within bacteriocytes, which are segregated from germ
cells; however, the symbionts are freed from the maternal
bacteriocytes before being transmitted to the next generation. In cases of parthenogenetic reproduction, Buchnera
cells are transferred into the parthenogenetic blastodermstage embryos; Buchnera are localized proximal to the host
germ cells during early development of the host. Moreover, in cases of sexual reproduction, Buchnera enter sexual
eggs at the pre-cellularization stage; at this stage, there are
no membranous barriers between Buchnera and the germ
lines [14,15]. Such localization of Buchnera cells proximal
to host germ lines might provide opportunities for the
LGT from Buchnera into the germ lines.
In addition to Buchnera, a number of aphid strains harbour other maternally transmitted intracellular bacteria,
such as Rickettsia (α-Proteobacteria), Spiroplasma (Mollicutes), and various γ-proteobacterial microbes, including
Hamiltonella defensa, Regiella insecticola, Serratia symbiotica,
and Arsenophonus species [16-28]. These 'secondary symbionts' are often shared between divergent insect lineages.
For example, Hamiltonella and Arsenophonus are observed
in scattered strains and species of aphids, psyllids, whiteflies and planthoppers [22,24,29]. Wolbachia lineages (αProteobacteria, Rickettsiales) are observed in a wide variety of arthropods [30-32], though only one case of infection has been reported in aphids [23]. These suggest that
secondary symbionts undergo horizontal transfer among
matrilines within and between species. They are also
transmitted vertically [16-28], but this appears to be
achieved in a less tightly controlled manner in compari-

son to the case of Buchnera [1]. Whereas Buchnera exist as
passive symbionts within their hosts, which in turn have
evolved mechanisms to maintain and transmit the Buchnera [14,15,33], secondary symbionts overcome host
immune responses and invade various types of host cells,
including germ cells [1,18,21,23,25,27,34]. Thus, there
are likely to have been frequent opportunities for aphids
to acquire genomic fragments from these symbiotic bacteria during evolution.
We previously performed transcriptome analysis of the
bacteriocyte of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, to elucidate the host mechanisms required to maintain Buchnera
[33]. This study identified a number of aphid genes that
are highly expressed in the bacteriocyte. Among them, two
genes (corresponding to the cDNA clusters R2C00193
and R2C00214, which consist of 10 and four expressed
sequence tags, respectively) exhibited similarity only to
prokaryotic genes, and not to those of extant Buchnera lineages. Southern blot analysis confirmed that they are
encoded in the aphid genome.
In the present study, we show the detailed analysis of the
phylogenetic positions, domain structures, and expression profiles of these genes, thus revealing their evolutionary history and functional roles.

Results
Full-length sequencing of cDNA clones
In the previous study, the sequences of the transcripts corresponding to the cDNA clusters (unigenes) R2C00193
and R2C00214 were not fully determined, as the cap-trapper cDNA clones were sequenced only from the 5' end. In
the present study, all the cap-trapper clone inserts relevant
to these unigenes were amplified by PCR using vector
primers (T3 and T7) and sequenced from both ends to
obtain full-length sequences. In the case of R2C00214, all
of the four clones had an identical sequence of 1312 bp
encoding a polypeptide of 226 amino acid residues (Figure 1). Full-length sequences for R2C00193 were approximately 1 kb in length, with slight variations mainly in the
putative untranslated regions (UTRs). They encoded a
polypeptide of 220 amino acid residues (Figure 2). These
full-length unigenes are hereafter referred to as
R2C00214F (DDBJ: AB435382) and R2C00193F (DDBJ:
AB435384 and AB435385), respectively.
Putative LD-carboxypeptidase
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search demonstrated that the product of R2C00214F has significant
sequence similarity to the bacterial enzyme LD-carboxypeptidase (LdcA), and the microcin C7 self-immunity
protein (MccF) that are produced by Gram-negative bacteria (Figure 1A). The top BLAST hit for the R2C00214F
product was the hypothetical protein WD1015 [Wolbachia

annotated; however, the analysis of the conserved
domains of the gene product performed using the CDsearch at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website indicated that the gene encodes the
bacterial LdcA belonging to the peptidase S66 family
(pfam02016, E = 1 × 10-47). The subordinate hits were
either LdcA or MccF, the latter of which mediates resist-

ance against microcin C7, an antimicrobial peptide that is
secreted by enterobacteria and inhibits the growth of bacterial species phylogenetically related to the producing
strains [35]. The mechanism through which MccF mediates resistance against microcin C7 is uncertain; however,
MccF belongs to the peptidase S66 family, and all the residues required for LdcA activity are conserved in it [36].
Thus, in this paper, we collectively refer to these proteins
belonging to the S66 family as 'LdcAs'. Putative orthologs
of R2C00214F are found in a variety of bacteria, but not

in eukaryotes, except for the fungus Gibberella zeae (RefSeq: XP_383840), implying that the two distantly related
organisms, namely, the aphid and the plant pathogenic
fungi, independently acquired ldcA from a bacterium via
LGT. We discuss this possible mode of inheritance via LGT
below.
R2C00214F appeared to lack the sequences required to
encode the middle region of canonical LdcAs (Figure 1).
To check the corresponding genomic sequences, the preliminary genome assembly of the pea aphid (Acyr_1.0)
was screened using R2C00214F as the query sequence.
The entire coding sequence (CDS) of ldcA was located in
a single scaffold; however, the genomic DNA had a
sequence corresponding to the middle region of the LdcAs
that was missing from the R2C00214F gene product. This
suggests that the sequence fragment represents an intron
of the R2C00214F gene (Figure 1). In order to search for
splice variants, we further amplified cDNAs for the aphid
LdcA by RT-PCR using specific primers and determined
their sequences. Unexpectedly, the amplified cDNAs
essentially consisted of a single type of sequence variant
that contained a sequence (402 bp = 134 amino acids)
corresponding to the middle region of LdcA. This long
form of the transcript (DDBJ: AB435383) encoded a 360amino acid-long polypeptide sequence, while the short
form (R2C00214F, DDBJ: AB435382) encoded a 226amino acid-long polypeptide sequence (Figure 1). The
long form and the short form appeared to be splice variants as cap-trapper libraries rarely contain inappropriate
artifacts that do not reflect the mRNA structures in vivo
[37,38]. The terminal dinucleotides of the insertion
sequence were GT-CG, which is similar to the canonical
splicing signal GT-AG. It has previously been verified that
the GT-CG set can also be used as a splicing signal [39].
The short form of the transcript was not detected by RTPCR; this might, at least in part, reflect the low level of
expression of this truncated form of the transcript in the
sample used in the study. The inconsistency might also be
due to some bias in constructing the cDNA library in the
previous study and/or in the RT-PCR employed in the
present study.
Figure 1B shows the intron-exon boundaries of the aphid
ldcA gene. The long-form transcript consists of two exons
and a single intron. Only the second exon encodes the
open reading frame (ORF) of the protein. The short-form
transcript consists of three exons and two introns; the
middle region of the second exon of the long-form transcript is spliced out as the second intron. These exon/
intron organizations were verified by PCR cloning.
The long-form transcript was also characterized by BLAST
similarity search. Once again, the top BLAST hit was the
hypothetical protein WD1015 (Wolbachia wMel) (RefSeq:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/12

NP_966741) (E = 5 × 10-81). The subordinate hits were
similar to those obtained with the short-form transcripts,
but with much smaller E-values. The amino acid sequence
of the long-form transcript exhibited 45% and 24% identity to the LdcA proteins of Wolbachia wMel and
Escherichia coli, respectively (Figure 1A). Three catalytically
active sites identified in Pseudomonas LdcA (Ser-126, His304, and Glu-227) [36] were conserved in the aphid LdcA
(Figure 1A). No other domain structure was observed in
the protein.
Putative rare lipoprotein A
The BLAST search revealed that the R2C00193F gene
product is significantly similar to a bacterial protein, rare
lipoprotein A (RlpA) (Figure 2A, 2B). The top BLAST hit
was a putative RlpA family protein [Bradyrhizobium sp.
BTAi1
(α-Proteobacteria,
Rhizobiales)]
(RefSeq:
YP_001239851) (E = 9 × 10-15), and essentially all of the
subordinate hits were thus annotated rare lipoprotein A.
Homologous sequences of the pea aphid putative rlpA
gene were observed in various bacteria, but not in eukaryotes, except for two other aphid species, Aphis gossypii
(GenBank: DR391796) and Toxoptera citricida (GenBank:
CD450666). Domain analysis revealed that the region
detected by the similarity search corresponds to the double-ψ β-barrel (DPBB) fold, which is the domain conserved in RlpA proteins. Although the function of RlpA is
not well understood [40], the DPBB fold is suspected to be
an enzymatic domain [41].

Using RT-PCR cloning, two types of sequences were identified. As expected, these sequences corresponded to the
transcripts originally found in the sequence cluster of
R2C00193F (DDBJ: AB435384 and AB435385). These
contained putative full CDSs encoding 220-amino acid
polypeptide sequences (Figure 2A, 2B). These sequences
appeared to be from distinct alleles, with two nucleotide
discrepancies in their CDSs resulting in a single amino
acid difference (denoted with an asterisk in Figure 2A).
Three other domain structures were observed in the pea
aphid putative RlpA (Figure 2A, 2B). At the N-terminal
region, a eukaryotic signal peptide motif was identified.
BLAST search of the remaining sequences revealed that
two regions adjacent to the DPBB domain are similar to
the inhibitor cysteine-knot (ICK) motif of three antimicrobial peptides – Alo-1, Alo-2, and Alo-3 – of the harlequin beetle Acrocinus longimanus (Swiss-Prot: P83651,
P83652, P83653) [42] (Figure 2C). The ICK motif
presents a unique knotted topology of three disulphide
bridges, with one disulphide penetrating through a macrocycle formed by the other two disulphides and interconnecting the peptide backbones [43]. The ICK family
proteins are relatively small (typically less than 40 residues in length), and are found in various lineages of

eukaryotes including plants, molluscs, arachnids and
insects, exhibiting various biological activities such as
toxic, antimicrobial, and insecticidal activities [42,43].
This motif was observed also in the putative ORFs of two
other aphid transcripts. However, the domain has never
been found in bacterial proteins, including RlpA.
To reveal the exon/intron structure of the pea aphid putative rlpA, a preliminary genome assembly of the pea aphid
(Acyr_1.0) was screened using R2C00193F as the query
sequence. The pea aphid rlpA locus was split into two distinct scaffolds (Figure 2B). The rlpA gene consists of three
exons and two introns. The first exon contains the eukaryotic signal peptide, the second contains one of the
cysteine-rich domains, and the third contains the DPBB
domain and another cysteine-rich domain. The boundaries of the protein domains were consistent with the locations of introns. The chimeric structure of the aphid RlpAs
might have come into being as the result of exon-shuffling
[44] involving prokaryotic and eukaryotic elements.
Pea aphid ancestor acquired ldcA via LGT from a
Wolbachia-like bacterium
The amino acid sequence of the aphid putative LdcA was
subjected to molecular phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3).
The phylogenetic tree demonstrated with robust statistical
support (98% in NJ; 97% in ML; 1.0 in Bayesian) that the
aphid gene is most closely related to the clade of LdcAs of
rickettsial bacteria, especially Wolbachia (RefSeq:
NP_966741) and Orientia tsutsugamushi (RefSeq:
YP_001248242). This branching pattern can be most simply explained by the hypothesis that the aphid acquired
ldcA via LGT from Wolbachia or some other rickettsial bacteria, many of which are known to be intracellular symbionts of insects. The putative orthologous gene detected in
the plant pathogenic fungus G. zeae was distantly related
to the aphid ldcA (Figure 3); this further suggests that the
ancestors of A. pisum and G. zeae independently acquired
the genes from different lineages of bacteria.
Common ancestor of three species of aphids acquired rlpA
via LGT
The amino acid sequences of putative RlpAs of A. pisum,
A. gossypii, and T. citricida were subjected to molecular
phylogenetic analysis with RlpAs of various bacterial lineages (Figure 4). The highly conserved DPBB domains were
aligned and used for this analysis. The phylogenetic positions of aphid RlpAs were not clearly resolved with a high
level of statistical support. However, to date, no rlpA genes
have been observed in any eukaryotes, except aphids.
Moreover, the phylogenetic tree showed that the aphid
rlpAs are monophyletic and that the phylogenetic relationships were congruent with the species tree of aphids
[45]. This suggests that the common ancestor of these
three aphid species acquired the rlpA gene from a bacte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/12

rium via LGT. The relatively low resolution of the phylogenetic positions of the aphid rlpA may be partly due to
the high evolutionary rate of the aphid lineages (see
below).
Aphid rlpA encodes a functional protein
To test the integrity of the functionality of the aphid
RlpAs, KA/KS ratios of the DPBB-encoding sequences of
aphid rlpAs were calculated. The ratios between A. pisum
and A. gossypii, and between A. pisum and T. citricida were
0.45 and 0.30, respectively. Both of the ratios were significantly smaller than 1 (p-values were 0.02 and 0.001,
respectively). This indicates that the aphid genes are not
pseudogenes, but are functional and contribute to the fitness of the insects. However, the KA/KS values were somewhat higher than those of other bacteria [for example,
0.03, Nitrosomonas eutropha (RefSeq: NC_008344) vs.
Nitrosomonas europaea (RefSeq: NC_004757); 0.04, Yersinia mollaretii (RefSeq: NZ_AALD01000017) vs. Yersinia
bercovieri (RefSeq: NZ_AALC01000036); the KS values
between other pairs were saturated]. This indicates that
the selective constraints on amino acid substitutions in
the DPBB domains are 8 to 15 times more relaxed in
aphids than bacteria, under the assumption that synonymous sites evolve neutrally.
ldcA and rlpA are highly expressed specifically in the
bacteriocyte
To examine the expression profiles of ldcA and rlpA, we
quantified their transcripts in the bacteriocyte and in the
whole body using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Figure
5). The results clearly demonstrated that ldcA and rlpA are
actively transcribed in the bacteriocyte. Transcripts for
ldcA and rlpA were 11.6 and 154-fold more abundant in
the bacteriocyte than in the whole body, respectively. It is
also notable that the copy numbers of their transcripts in
the bacteriocyte were comparable to those of the control
transcript encoding ribosomal protein L7 (RpL7), indicating that their expression levels are relatively high. High
levels of expression of these genes in the bacteriocyte
strongly suggest that they are not only functional, but they
play important roles in maintaining the symbiotic relationship with the obligate mutualist, Buchnera.

Discussion
Aphids have recruited genes from bacterial genomes via
LGT
We have obtained strong evidence for two cases of bacteria-to-insect LGT. The genes encoded in the aphid genome
that are expressed in the bacteriocyte were demonstrated
to be significantly similar only to the bacterial genes, ldcA
and rlpA. Quantitative RT-PCR further verified that these
genes are highly expressed in the bacteriocyte. The
orthologs of such genes are absent in Buchnera, the obligate mutualistic bacteria that are harboured in the bacteri-

ocytes. These findings imply that the aphid ldcA and rlpA
have compensational functions to support the survival of
Buchnera.
Although until recently it was believed that LGT plays an
important role exclusively in the evolution of unicellular
organisms, especially prokaryotes [46-48], the accumulating genomic data is now revealing that LGT also affects the
genomic content of multicellular eukaryotes with segregated germ cells. DNA sequences with significant similarity to genes of Wolbachia, an endocellular rickettsial
bacterium, have been observed in the genomes of a wide
range of arthropods and filarial nematodes [49-52]. Wolbachia is a maternally transmitted endosymbiont that can
enter the germ line of host animals [34], which facilitates
bacterial DNA transfer to the host nucleus. However,
many of the transferred Wolbachia genes appear to be in
the process of pseudogenization, and even intact "genes"
are not expressed at a significant level [51,52], implying
that these transferred genes do not confer novel functions
on the host organisms.

The cases discovered in the present study are especially
interesting in that these transferred bacterial genes not
only retain their functionality, but are highly expressed in
the bacteriocyte, which is the cell that harbours Buchnera.
The molecular phylogenetic analysis clearly indicated that
the aphid ldcA is closely related to that of Wolbachia, and
of other rickettsial bacteria. Although infections of Wolbachia and Rickettsia are sporadically observed among the
aphid species [17,23,25], the ISO strain that was used in
the present study lacks such symbionts [33]; this suggests
that the previous infection left only a transferred gene as a
footprint, while the source bacterium disappeared. With
regard to rlpA, it was clearly demonstrated that this gene
also was of bacterial origin, but its phylogenetic position
has not been fully resolved.
Eukaryote-type structures of the genes and transcripts
Recent studies have revealed that LGTs from bacteria can
occur in metazoa [49-52]. However, these transferred
genes cannot function unless they obtain eukaryotic promoters, since the gene expression systems of prokaryotes
and eukaryotes differ. The likelihood of promoter acquisition seems very low, as suggested by the previously
reported lack of expression of laterally transferred genes
[51,52]. The aphid ldcA and rlpA are highly expressed in
the bacteriocytes, clearly indicating that these genes have
acquired eukaryotic promoters, although the mechanism
of promoter acquisition has yet to be determined. The
cDNAs for the aphid ldcA and rlpA were originally
observed in a cDNA library constructed by the cap-trapper
method that targets the 5' cap structure and 3' poly-A tails
of eukaryotic mRNAs [37,38]. This suggests that both the
mRNAs for the aphid ldcA and rlpA have the 5' cap structure and 3' poly-A tail that bacterial mRNAs lack. Indeed,
polyadenylation signals (AAUAAA) are observed in the 3'UTR of the transcripts. Screening of the genome scaffold
followed by PCR cloning revealed that the genes have spliceosomal-type introns. This type of intron has not been
observed in bacterial genes, suggesting that these genes
acquired introns after they were transferred into the aphid
genome.
LdcA may be used to control Buchnera
LdcA is an enzyme required for recycling murein (peptidoglycan), a component of the bacterial cell wall. LdcA
releases the terminal D-alanine from L-alanyl-D-glutamylmeso-diaminopimelyl-D-alanine, which contains turnover
products of murein. The disruption of E. coli ldcA results
in bacteriolysis during the stationary phase, indicating
that the reaction is essential for bacterial survival [53]. In
the mutant, due to a defect in murein recycling, the unusual murein precursor uridine 5'-pyrophosphoryl Nacetylmuramyl-tetrapeptide accumulates, and the overall
cross-linkage of murein decreases dramatically. This is
interpreted as a reflection of the increased incorporation

Page 9 of 13

BMC Biology 2009, 7:12

of tetrapeptide precursors that can only function as acceptors and not as donors in the cross-linking reaction.
Buchnera has cell walls composed of murein [54], but it
lacks ldcA [10]. Although the evolutionary origin of the
aphid ldcA seems to be from rickettsial bacteria and not
from Buchnera, it is intriguing to note that this gene is
highly expressed in the bacteriocyte. Aphids may control
the proliferation of Buchnera using ldcA, which was
recruited from another symbiotic bacterium that previously had resided in aphids.
Chimeric structure of putative RlpA
The molecular phylogenetic tree indicated that the LGT of
rlpAs occurred before the divergence of the three aphid
species. On the basis of fossil records, this divergence is
inferred to date back to more than 50 million years ago
[45,55]. Even if the transferred genes successfully acquire
sequence elements that allow their expression, contribution of the genes to the host fitness, or strategies enabling
the selfish propagation of the genes, would be required for
the maintenance of the transferred genes in the host
genome for such a long period of time. The functional role
of the rlpA in any bacteria is not well understood; however, RlpA suppresses the E. coli mutant of Prc that cleaves
the C terminus of FtsI [40], suggesting that rlpA plays an
important role in bacteria. Domain analyses revealed that,
in addition to the conserved DPBB domain, the aphid
RlpA has three other domains that are not found among
bacterial orthologs. This implies that RlpA might have
gained novel functions that are yet to be determined.
Although the function of RlpA is not well understood, the
high level of expression of the aphid rlpA in the bacteriocyte implies that this gene is also essential for Buchnera.

Conclusion
In this study, several lines of evidence indicated that
aphids acquired genes from bacteria via LGT, and are
using such genes to maintain the obligately mutualistic
bacteria, Buchnera. Phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that one of the genes was derived from a rickettsial
bacterium that is closely related to the extant Wolbachia.
This is the first report of functional genes that were laterally transferred from symbiotic bacteria to metazoa. The
cases presented here are of special interest in that these
transferred bacterial genes not only retain their functionality, but are highly expressed in the bacteriocyte that is
differentiated so as to harbour Buchnera, which lack such
genes.

Methods
Aphids
Strain ISO, a parthenogenetic clone of the pea aphid
Acyrthosiphon pisum which is free from secondary symbionts including Wolbachia, was used in this study. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/12

insects were reared on Vicia faba at 15°C in a long-day
regime of 16 hr light and 8 hr dark. Parthenogenetic apterous adults (12 to 15 days old) were used for the experiments.
Cloning of the pea aphid genes
Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole body of the
pea aphid using a DNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was
extracted from bacteriocytes and first strand cDNA was
prepared as described previously [33]. PCR was performed using various sets of gene specific primers (Additional file 1). PCR products were either purified and
sequenced directly or cloned using the pGEM-T easy vector system (Promega).
Characterization of gene products by similarity searches
Homologous protein sequences and conserved domains
were detected by BLASTP similarity searches at the website
of the NCBI using deduced amino acid sequences as queries [56]. The presence and location of signal peptides
were predicted using the program SignalP 3.0 [57]. Statistical tests of homology between two amino acid
sequences were conducted with bl2seq. Default parameters were used except for the matrix (-M), set to
BLOSUM80, the gap existence penalties (-G), set to 11,
and the theoretical database size (-d), set to 127,836,513,
the size of Swiss-Prot release 55.0.
Molecular phylogenetic analysis
Multiple protein sequences were aligned using the program package MAFFT 5.8 [58], followed by manual refinement. Amino acid sites corresponding to alignment
gap(s) were omitted from the data set. Only unambiguously aligned amino acid sequences were used for the
phylogenetic analysis. The aligned sequence data are
shown in Additional file 2.

Phylogenetic trees were inferred by the neighbour joining,
the maximum likelihood and the Bayesian methods.
Neighbour-joining trees were constructed using the program package Xced [59]. The distance matrix was estimated by the maximum likelihood distance method
assuming the JTT model with among-site rate heterogeneity. The bootstrap probability for each node was calculated by generating 1000 bootstrap replicates. Maximum
likelihood trees were estimated using the program package RAxML [60]. In the analysis, the JTT model was used
as a substitution model for amino acids. To incorporate
the effect of among-site rate heterogeneity, a mixed model
(one invariable rate plus Γ distributed rates) was used. The
support values for the internal nodes were inferred by
1000 bootstrap replicates. In the Bayesian inference, we
used the program MrBayes 3.1.2 [61]. The JTT +Γ +Inv
model was used as a substitution model. In total, 4100
trees were obtained (ngen 410,000, samplefreq 100), and

the first 2000 of these were considered as the 'burn in' and
discarded. We checked that the potential scale reduction
factor was approximately 1.00 for all parameters and that
the average standard deviation of split frequencies converged towards zero. KS and KA values were calculated as
described previously [62]. Statistical significance of the
obtained KA/KS value was tested against a bootstrap distribution of KA/KS values, which was generated by 10,000
bootstrap resamplings of codons from the original alignment.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was isolated from whole bodies and bacteriocytes of
12 to 15-day-old parthenogenetic apterous adults using
TRIzol reagent, followed by RNase-free DNase I treatment. Each whole body sample and bacteriocyte sample
was derived from one individual and a batch of bacteriocytes that were collected from about 10 individuals,
respectively. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using
pd(N)6 primer and PrimeScript reverse transcriptase
(Takara). Quantification was performed with the LightCycler instrument and FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green
I kit (Roche), as described previously [33]. The primers
used were: ldcA-677F (CAACCTGACGCTAGTCGAGAACT), ldcA-758R (CACGTCCTCCAAGAACACGAT),
rlpA-449F (CGGCGGACGGTAAGGTAAT), and rlpA529R (ACTGTACCGGGCCTGTGTTC). The running
parameters were: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles
of 95°C for 10 s, 55°C for 5 s, and 72°C for 4 s. Results
were analyzed using the LightCycler software version 3.5
(Roche), and relative expression levels were normalized to
mRNA for the ribosomal protein RpL7. Statistical analyses
were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test.
