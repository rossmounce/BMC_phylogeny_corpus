Abstract
Background: The complexity of the problem of the origin of life has spawned a large number of
possible evolutionary scenarios. Their number, however, can be dramatically reduced by the
simultaneous consideration of various bioenergetic, physical, and geological constraints.
Results: This work puts forward an evolutionary scenario that satisfies the known constraints by
proposing that life on Earth emerged, powered by UV-rich solar radiation, at photosynthetically
active porous edifices made of precipitated zinc sulfide (ZnS) similar to those found around modern
deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Under the high pressure of the primeval, carbon dioxide-dominated
atmosphere ZnS could precipitate at the surface of the first continents, within reach of solar light.
It is suggested that the ZnS surfaces (1) used the solar radiation to drive carbon dioxide reduction,
yielding the building blocks for the first biopolymers, (2) served as templates for the synthesis of
longer biopolymers from simpler building blocks, and (3) prevented the first biopolymers from
photo-dissociation, by absorbing from them the excess radiation. In addition, the UV light may have
favoured the selective enrichment of photostable, RNA-like polymers. Falsification tests of this
hypothesis are described in the accompanying article (A.Y. Mulkidjanian, M.Y. Galperin, Biology
Direct 2009, 4:27).
Conclusion: The suggested "Zn world" scenario identifies the geological conditions under which
photosynthesizing ZnS edifices of hydrothermal origin could emerge and persist on primordial
Earth, includes a mechanism of the transient storage and utilization of solar light for the production
of diverse organic compounds, and identifies the driving forces and selective factors that could have
promoted the transition from the first simple, photostable polymers to more complex living
organisms.

Background
- ....without parent by spontaneous birth
Rise the first specks of animated earth.
Erasmus Darwin, Temple of Nature, 1802 [1]
The problem of the origin of life is central to biology. It
has been repeatedly addressed by scholars, including the
above-quoted Erasmus Darwin and his famous grandson
Charles, who wrote in his letter to J.D. Hooker of February
1, 1871: "It is often said that all the conditions for the first production of a living organism are now present, which could ever
have been present. But if (and oh! what a big if!) we could conceive in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and
phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, &c., present, that a proteine [sic] compound was chemically formed ready to undergo
still more complex changes, at the present day such matter
would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have
been the case before living creatures were formed" [2]. Fifty
years later, Oparin has suggested, in the first comprehensive scenario of the abiogenic origin of life (abiogenesis),
that the primordial reducing atmosphere could have
favoured the spontaneous formation of proteinaceous bodies that could aggregate into coacervates (protocells) [3,4].
Independently, Haldane, building upon the achievements
of virology, proposed that the life started from bacteriophage-like molecules synthesized under the influence of
the Sun's radiation in the primordial "hot dilute soup"
[5]. It has been repeatedly demonstrated [6-17] that simple building blocks such as amino acids or nucleobases
could form from simpler compounds, provided that
energy was delivered as UV light or electric discharges (see
[18-36] for surveys of research on the origin of life, and a
section below devoted to the more detailed consideration
of particular concepts).
The initial, rather general Oparin-Haldane's concept of
abiogenesis has been gradually replaced by a mosaic of
specific hypotheses that either emphasize the "replication
first" principle or build upon the "metabolism first"
assumption. The "replication first" concept implies that
the emergence of the first replicating entities (replicators)
preceded metabolism; it is represented by the RNA World
scenario that implies that RNA-like molecules capable of
both self-reproduction and simple metabolism were the
first inhabitants of Earth [37-73]. The "metabolism first"
idea suggests that life started as a system of interacting
chemical cycles and the first replicators appeared later, see
refs. [23,27,29,30,36,74-84] for consideration of the controversy between the two concepts. Elsewhere, we have
argued that the "replication first" and "metabolism first"
concepts complement rather than contradict each other
and have suggested that life on Earth started with a
"metabolism-driven replication" [85]. We have also

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

emphasized that the virtually unlimited number of tentative scenarios of the origin of life can be dramatically
reduced by the simultaneous consideration of a variety of
external constraints (boundary conditions) [85].
Here I invoke further (bio)energetic, physical, and geological constraints that are related to abiogenesis. As a solution that satisfies these constraints, I put forward an
evolutionary scenario in which life on Earth emerged,
powered by solar irradiation, within porous edifices of
hydrothermal origin that were built of photosynthesizing
zinc sulfide (ZnS) crystals, in the "Zn world".
Energetic, physical, and geological constraints on
abiogenesis
Energetics: Requirement for utilizable energy flow(s)
Living organisms can exist only when supported by energy
flow [86-92]. Because of the obvious requirement for
energetic continuity, the energy flows that deserve attention in an evolutionary context are those that remain constant on the evolutionary relevant, geological timescale.
This consideration discounts the evolutionary importance
of occasional energy inputs such as impact bombardment,
atmospheric electric discharges, and shock waves. The primordial atmosphere on Earth is assumed to be dominated
by carbon dioxide [25,93-100]. Hence, energy was initially needed to reduce CO2 to organic compounds that
could participate in prebiological syntheses [34]. Currently, the fixation of CO2 by living organisms is supported by two energy fluxes: the communities at the
Earth's surface depend, via photosynthesis and its products, on solar light [101], whereas the biotopes at the sea
floor can also exploit the redox potential difference
between the reduced hydrothermal fluids and oxygenated
ocean waters [102]. Accordingly, some scholars have considered solar radiation to be the driving force of abiogenesis [5,85,103-112]. Others have hypothesized that
chemical or redox disequilibria at the sea-floor hydrothermal vents [113-123] or at the surface of sea-floor iron
minerals [124-130] could have driven the emergence of
the first organisms. As argued in more detail elsewhere
[85], a direct analogy between primordial life and modern
deep-sea biotopes is not possible, since the redox energy
span of > 1 eV between the reduced compounds of hydrothermal fluids and the sea-dissolved oxygen became
exploitable only after the ocean waters – only 2 Ga ago –
were saturated by oxygen, a by-product of cyanobacterial
photosynthesis [101,131,132].

The very lack of oxygen in the primordial atmosphere
should, however, favour light-driven chemical syntheses.
Without the ozone shield, the solar light reaching Earth
contained a UV component that was 10–1000 times
stronger than it is today [133,134] and could have driven
diverse chemical reactions, in particular carbon fixation.

The major constituents of the primordial atmosphere
(CO2, N2, CH4, and water vapour [25,93-100]) let UV rays
with O > 240 nm through [133]. The fossils of phototropic
communities, which apparently flourished as far back as
3.4–3.5 Ga [25,135-139], also indicate that the primordial atmosphere was transparent to solar light. Hence, no
other known energy source could compete with solar irradiation in terms of strength and access to the whole of the
Earth's surface.
Mauzerall has introduced an important additional constraint by noting that the energy requirements of the first
living beings had to be compatible with those of modern
organisms [109]. He argues that "the ur-cell would be simpler, but it would also be less efficient". More rigorously
speaking, the intensity of the energy flux(es) that supported the emergence of life should be either comparable
with the intensity of modern life-supporting energy flows
or stronger. At least two UV-driven abiogenic processes of
CO2 reduction are known to proceed with an efficiency
comparable to that of modern photosynthesis. On the
one hand, the photo-oxidation of ferrous iron ions in
solution can lead to the reduction of CO2 [10]; for example, Borowska and Mauzerall have observed a light-driven
formaldehyde formation in the presence of dissolved ferrous hydroxide with a quantum yield of 2–3% [140]. On
other hand, a UV-driven synthesis of diverse organic compounds from CO2 has been demonstrated at the surface of
broad-band semiconductors [141-149]. Such semiconductors not only photoreduce CO2 but, depending on the
initial substrates, can also photocatalyse a wide set of
diverse organic reactions [144,150-152]. Several naturally
occurring minerals, in particular TiO2 (anatase/rutile),
WO3 (wolframite), MnS (alabandite), and ZnS (wurtzite,
sphalerite), possess the properties of broad-band semiconductors and can photoreduce CO2 [107,143,151,153158]. The highest quantum yield of 80% has so far been
reported for CO2 reduction to formate at the surface of
colloidal ZnS particles [144,145].
Physics: Photostability of nucleotides
RNA and DNA are polymers of similar sugar-phosphate
units, with each sugar moiety (ribose in RNA or deoxyribose in DNA) carrying one of four different nitrogen bases
(nucleobases). The specific feature that is shared by all
nucleobases is their unique photostability [159-165].
Since this trait is not related to the storage of genetic information, several authors [105,112,133,159,164,165] have
noted that this property could have been of some use
when the UV flux at the surface of primordial Earth was
much stronger than it is now [133,134]. Nucleobases
apparently can absorb excess energy quanta from sugarphosphate moieties and protect them from photo-dissociation [166]. This feature explains why the UV damage to
the backbones even of modern RNA and DNA molecules

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

is 103–104 times less frequent than destruction of nucleobases themselves [159].
Based on a Monte-Carlo simulation of primordial photochemistry [112], we have proposed an evolutionary scenario in which the relative enrichment in increasingly
complex RNA-like polymers could be attributed to their
higher photostability in a UV-irradiated environment,
with UV-quenching nucleobases protecting the sugarphosphate backbones from photo-dissociation. It was
posited that the photostability could increase further
owing to the stacking of nucleobases and the formation of
Watson-Crick pairs [85,112], see also below.
In modern organisms, the continuous victimization of
nucleobases is a well-known problem that is counteracted
by sophisticated repair systems [167]. At the earliest steps
of evolution, repair systems were absent, so the photodestruction of nucleobases could have hindered the selection of the first replicators. The photodestruction of
nucleobases could be, however, prevented by radiationabsorbing templates. Many minerals can take up radiation
energy from the adsorbed photoactive compounds. For
example, montmorillonite particles have been shown to
protect catalytic RNA molecules (hairpin ribozyme 1)
from UV-induced damage: after a UV-irradiation, the selfcleavage activity of the montmorillonite-adsorbed
ribozyme molecules was three times higher compared to
that of the molecules irradiated in the absence of
montmorillonite [168]. With ZnS crystals, the excitation
transfer from adsorbed dye molecules to a template has
been shown to proceed within picoseconds [169], i.e.
much faster than the typical intrinsic characteristic time of
photodestruction (e.g. ~20 Ps for adenosine monophosphate [170]). Hence, in the evolutionary context, the first
photostable RNA-like polymers had better survival
chances at the surfaces of those minerals that could efficiently absorb the radiation energy.
Geology: Requirement for hydrothermal settings
In addition to abundant chemical elements such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, biological systems
contain a number of microelements, often at levels far
exceeding those in the surrounding environment (see
[171] for a comprehensive survey). In particular, transition metals are often involved in enzyme catalytic centres
[90,172]. The concentration of such metals in modern
cells is many orders of magnitude larger than that in sea
water (see Table 1); the ion accumulation is accomplished
by sophisticated transport systems and demands ion-tight
membranes to prevent the escape of trapped metal ions
out of the cell [173,174]. However, the ion-tight membranes, as argued elsewhere [175,176], seem to be a relatively late evolutionary acquisition. Here we encounter a
paradox. On the one hand, the emergence of metal-con-

lower because the rising hot fluids mix, while still under
the sea floor, with the cold ocean waters that are pressed
into the seabed by the overlying water column. Those
peripheral chimneys that eject fluids with temperature in
the range of 200°C to 300°C are covered by porous precipitates of sphalerite (ZnS), with additions of other
sulfides such as galena (PbS) and alabandite (MnS)
[102,180,182]. This change in chemical composition is
due to the fact that upon cooling, the sulfides of iron and
copper precipitate much faster than those of zinc and
manganese [183]. Accordingly, when the temperature of
hydrothermal fluid is less than 300°C, the sulfides of iron
and copper precipitate already below the sea floor, inside
the moulds of hydrothermal systems, so that the transition metal ions that reach the surface are predominantly
Zn2+ [184]. The difference in the precipitation rates manifests itself also in the chemical composition of those vent
chimneys that eject both Fe2+ and Zn2+ ions. The throats of
such chimneys are formed of promptly precipitating FeS
and CuFeS2, while their outer surfaces are coated by the
more slowly precipitating ZnS [179,181].

The table is compiled from data presented in [90,102,172,173].

taining RNA and protein domains – as a result of their
eventual stabilization by available transition metal ions –
implies an abundance of these ions. On the other hand,
the equilibrium concentration of such ions in sea water is
very low (see Table 1). This paradox is routinely resolved
by invoking hydrothermal settings as potential cradles of
life [113-123,177]. In such systems, which currently cluster around the mid-ocean ridges and deep-sea submerged
volcanoes (seamounts) – where hot magma chambers
occur near the seabed – water circulates down into the
crust, becomes heated, and then rises up. When water is
overheated to more than 400°C, it can leach metal ions
from the crust. These ions are then brought to the surface
by hot hydrothermal fluids, so that the steady-state concentrations of metal ions at the orifices of hydrothermal
vents may exceed the equilibrium concentrations because
of this continuous supply [102,178].
Since hydrothermal fluids are rich in H2S, the interaction
of metal-rich hot hydrothermal fluids with cold ocean
water leads to the precipitation of metal sulfide particles
that form "smoke" over the "chimneys" of deep-sea
hydrothermal vents [102,178]. These particles eventually
aggregate, settle down, and, ultimately, form porous,
sponge-like structures around the vent orifices [179-181].
The vent systems have a zonal structure [102,178,182]:
pyrite (FeS2) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) are found in the
centre, where the temperature of hydrothermal fluids is
the highest (~350°C; the water at the sea floor remains
liquid even at such high temperatures because the pressure is above 200 bar [102]). At the periphery of hydrothermal fields, the temperature of hydrothermal fluids is

The zonal structure is remarkably conserved between the
modern hydrothermal vent systems and the ancient volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits of hydrothermal
origin. VMS deposits can reach many kilometres in diameter, and date back to the Archean period [185-187]. The
ancient VMS deposits have pyrite (FeS2) and chalcopyrite
(CuFeS2) at their centres being encircled by consecutive
halos of, e.g., pyrite-chalcopyrite-sphalerite, sphaleritegalena-alabandite, and, finally, chert [185,187].
ZnS crystals: Unique traits
The above listed constraints, when considered simultaneously, identify crystalline ZnS as the single compound
that (i) can serve as an efficient photocatalyst capable of
reducing CO2 with a quantum yield of up to 80%, (ii) can
promptly absorb UV quanta from the adsorbed organic
compounds, preventing their destruction, and (iii) is a
major constituent of hydrothermal vent systems, being
typically found at their outer surface and/or periphery.

The evolutionary scenario that is given below suggests that
porous ZnS formations of hydrothermal/volcanic origin
performed several functions, being involved in the primeval photosynthesis of the first metabolites, in the
(photo)selection of the first RNA-like polymers, and in
their protection from photodestruction.

Rings join to rings...
Erasmus Darwin, The Temple of Nature, 1802 [1]
Initial geological settings
After the primary hydrogen atmosphere of Earth had
escaped into space, the so-called secondary atmosphere
built up with volcanic gases; this atmosphere was, most
likely, dominated by CO2, with smaller amounts of N2,
CO, and H2, similar to that on modern Mars and Venus,
where CO2 still makes up 95% of the atmosphere [25,93100]. As the Earth's surface gradually cooled, water vapour
started to condense into the first oceans. The atmospheric
pressure at the surface of primordial Earth has been estimated to reach several hundred bars; therefore ocean formation could have started when the surface was still very
hot [94,97,100]. Zircon data indicate the presence of the
first continent(s) by 4.2 Ga [188]. Hydrothermal activity
of some type would have been established promptly,
driven by thermal convection. Most likely, the initial convection systems did not form a continuous chain of midocean ridges as they do now but a pattern of "hot spots"
similar to modern volcanic island arcs [93,95,189]. The
activity of these hydrothermal/volcanic systems was
accompanied by surges of hot hydrothermal fluids to the
surface. Owing to the initial atmospheric pressure of t
100 bar (see [94,100], and cf. with the pressure of 95 bar
at the surface of modern Venus), very hot hydrothermal
fluids enriched by dissolved metals could discharge
directly to the surface of the first continents. This situation
differed fundamentally from the modern one, since today
such hot fluids can reach the continental surface only as
steam (at the points of volcanic or geyser activity), losing
their metal content on the way. Taking into account the
slow precipitation of ZnS under high-pressure conditions
[183] and the abundance of Zn in the Earth's crust [90],
one can expect a major delivery of Zn-enriched hot fluids
to the surface of the first continent(s). Zinc could even
have been the dominant transition metal in the continental hydrothermal fluids when the atmospheric pressure
changed in the range from ca. 100 bar to ca. 10 bar (this
would correspond to the temperature of hot fluids reaching 300°C – 200°C, respectively, cf. with the above
described situation at modern hydrothermal vents).
Hence, it is possible that the large areas of first continent(s) could have been covered by porous ZnS precipitates of hydrothermal origin. These ZnS edifices should

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

have been accessible to solar UV radiation at the surface of
continents and in shallow waters surrounding them (see
Fig. 1). Hereafter, the term "sub-aerial" is used to denote
illuminated settings where the UV-rich solar light could
have served as an energy source for primordial syntheses
(see also [25,114,177]).
ZnS-mediated photosynthesis
In the absence of an ozone layer, the UV component of
solar radiation would have driven the reduction of CO2 at
the ZnS-covered surfaces. Since these surfaces were
formed by precipitated ZnS particles (see Fig. 1), similar to
those used in the aforementioned experiments with the
photosynthetically active "colloidal" ZnS crystals
[144,145], the reduction of CO2 may have proceeded with
a high quantum yield under the high atmospheric CO2
pressure. Zinc sulfide is a very powerful photocatalyst
that, besides reducing CO2, is capable of driving diverse
reactions of carbon- and nitrogen-containing substrates
[144,150,152,190-192]. Such substrates could build up in
the atmosphere, be generated by photochemical reactions
in the water phase [24,106,109], accompany volcanic
extrusions [193] and hydrothermal fluids [123], or be
brought by meteorites [194]. They could have then participated in further photocatalyzed transformations at the
ZnS surfaces.
First settlers in the ZnS world
Electrically charged products of photosynthesis, e.g. negatively charged carbonic acids, would have been attracted
by the complementary charges at the ZnS surfaces of mineral compartments. These molecules could have interacted with each other at the catalytic surfaces of
continuously operating porous ZnS photoreactors, yielding even more intricate carbon- and nitrogen-containing
molecules. The more complex molecules would, generally, have absorbed more light and been more vulnerable
to UV quanta. Still, in certain cases, the increase in chemical complexity may have been accompanied by an
increase in photostability. Indeed, the destruction of a
chemical compound by a light quantum starts with the
"trapping" of its energy by a particular chemical bond, followed by an increase in the energy of this bond and its
eventual dissociation [195]. However, if the absorbed
energy is spread over many bonds, then the probability of
bond cleavage drops dramatically. Such a spreading of
excitation energy occurs in systems that contain conjugated bonds (so-called S-systems with alternating single
and double bonds); the spreading is facilitated by a ringlike (aromatic) molecular structure. All nucleobases
belong to such ring-like, conjugated systems [159]; the
lifetime of their excited states (~100 fs [164]) is extremely
short even for S-systems; this short life time would additionally have decreased the probability of photodestruction. As discussed above, the UV-resistance of S-systems

Right: Precipitation of FeS and ZnS nanoparticles (black and grey spots, respectively) around a primeval, sub-aerial hot spring. Note that ZnS and FeS particles precipitate at different distances from the spring. The picture is based upon data from [102,119,179,181,183]; see the main text for
further details. Left: A schematic presentation of reactions within a photosynthesizing ZnS nanoparticle, as combined with an
energy diagram; the scheme is based on refs. [145,149,190,278]. Initially the absorption of a UV quantum leads to the separation of electric charges. The electrons migrate in the crystal until they are trapped at the surface; the trapped electrons can
reduce a CO2 molecule either via two one-electron transfers [144] or, possibly, in a concerted two-electron reaction. The
electron vacancy (hole) is initially reduced by the S2- ion of the crystal; the ultimate electron equilibration, as discussed in the
main text, requires external electron donors, e.g. H2S. Note that, for simplicity of presentation, the one-electron and two-electron reactions are not discerned; see the main text for further details.
could increase further upon their stacking together and/or
adsorption to radiation-absorbing minerals.
Hence, at illuminated ZnS surfaces, the UV-resistant, ringlike compounds could survive as stacked aggregates of
"rings joined to rings" (quoted from [1]). A relative
enrichment in such stacks, as well as their stabilization by
covalent linkages, could be driven by a number of factors,
namely, the UV-resistance of polymerized and stacked Ssystems [112,164], the potential to utilize the energy of
UV quanta for photopolymerization [11,12,196], the
ability of Zn2+ ions to catalyze the polymerization
[197,198], and the low dielectric permittivity of the surface-adjoining water layers [199] that may have favoured
condensation reactions. In addition, a regular mesh of
electric charges at the ZnS surface, by attracting reactants
and arranging them appropriately relative to each other,
may have made the polymerization thermodynamically
more favourable than in bulk water [124]. Then, however,
the resulting polymers should have stayed confined to the

surface [200]. In the context of a UV-irradiated environment such confinement could be considered a rescue
since an eventual detachment of a primordial polymer
from the energy-absorbing ZnS surface would have led to
faster photodestruction. At the same time, while prevented from detachment from the surface, the molecules
would have been able to diffuse along the surface, to interact with each other, and to form aggregates, which is a precondition for the abiogenic emergence of increasingly
complex structures.
The scenario outlined above should yield two fundamentally different populations of molecules, namely surfaceconfined, relatively complex structures capable of efficient
discarding excess radiation energy (hereafter referred to as
zymes), and continuously photosynthesized simpler
organic molecules – the future metabolites – that stored the
solar energy in their covalent bonds.

First replicating entities
The eventual elongation of zymes would promote their
entropy-driven folding at the surface. In addition, an
increase in their amount would encourage interactions
between them. Both factors may have led to the formation
of hydrogen bonds within zymes and/or between different zymes. Clustering of zymes may have been favoured
by high pressure [201] and periodic drying events, e.g. in
tidal regions [18,202], resulting in a kind of natural
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-like process [203]. The
UV-stability of double RNA strands, owing to hydrogen
bonding, is much higher than that of single-stranded
RNAs [159,164,204-206]. Therefore those S-systems may
have been selected – from the initially larger set of compounds – which could make multiple hydrogen bonds
with each other. Ultimately, this selection would have led
to a relative enrichment of complementary nucleobases,
including those that we know now. It is plausible that the
S-systems could have been initially linked in various
ways. It would appear that one of these constructs, the one
with ribose-phosphate units connecting the stacked
nucleobases, attained the ability for self-replication and
was, because of this, retained by evolution.

Unlike occasional self-replication events, a systematic,
accurate replication is thermodynamically demanding
[207] and would require special machinery that could
consist of several folded polymers resembling modern
transfer RNA (tRNA) or ribosomal RNA (rRNA). It is
unlikely that we would ever be able to reconstruct all the
steps that led to the formation of first replicators (see but
refs. [44,52,54,58,60,65,67,72,208,209] for tentative scenarios). We can, however, try to make guesses on the
selective forces underlying their emergence. At least two
factors deserve note:
1) Nucleobases quench the UV quanta by converting
the energy into heat. The heating, however, is not
harmless. Using the approach of Dancshazy and coworkers [210], it is possible to surmise that a single UV
quantum should locally heat a 100-unit RNA-like polymer by tens of degrees Celsius. Even if the absorbed
energy can be promptly transmitted to a template,
local heating of the template can eventually cause
ablation of the molecule [211]. In the UV-irradiated
environment, both outcomes could lead to polymer
deterioration. Overheating, however, can be avoided
by channelling part of the energy into work. For example, those zymes that could serve as antennas and use
the UV energy, e.g., for connecting nucleotides
together (as hypothesized by Skulachev [111]) had
better survival chances. This selective advantage of
"working" polymers over the "idle" ones is general in
nature: it is applicable not only to the first ribozymes,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

but also to the first proteins, as discussed in the next
section.
2) A population of RNA-like polymers adsorbed at a
ZnS template could gather light and therefore enhance
the yield of the photocatalysis. Since the hydrothermal
ZnS structures are highly porous [179-181], the pores/
compartments that contained efficient replicators and,
hence, an increasing number of UV-absorbing zymes
could produce more metabolites, which, in turn,
could be used to build new replicators, resulting in a
kind of positive feedback.
As first pointed out by Horowitz [212], and as our simulations showed ([112]; see also the section on energetics
of the Zn world below), an abiogenic formation of complex molecules (e.g. long polymers) would imply the presence of an overwhelmingly larger amount of simpler
molecules of the same type (shorter polymers). The first
replicators could therefore utilize the available shorter
fragments; with time, they could acquire the ability to
attain building blocks by cleaving the (phosphor)ester
bonds in other surface-adsorbed zymes. Owing to this
development: (i) a coupling mechanism could be established that, with some modifications, has been in use ever
since – the polymerization of RNA and DNA is still driven
by cleavage of the phosphoester bonds in ATP; and (ii) the
genuine fight for survival could begin, since each replicator became a potential prey for others.
Emergence of proteins and enzymes
Generally, the thermodynamics of primordial syntheses
of polymers, and in particular of polypeptides, has been
deemed a riddle since the respective condensation reactions, which are accompanied by the release of water molecules, should be unfavourable in water (see e.g. refs.
[83,213] for further discussion of this point). A closer
inspection of modern metabolic chains offers a way out of
this conundrum. Although biological syntheses are
indeed accompanied by the release of water molecules,
they never proceed "for free", but are coupled to thermodynamically favourable, exergonic reactions, e.g. of ATP
hydrolysis, which require water. Hence, if (i) there were
substrates that could be hydrolyzed and (ii) a thermodynamic coupling between syntheses and hydrolyses could
be established – then the primordial syntheses could proceed without violating the laws of thermodynamics.

In this framework, the emergence of new synthetic pathways could proceed in two steps, as follows. First, a
(ribo)zyme capable of cleaving a new type of chemical
bond – in a thermodynamically favourable reaction –
would have emerged. Then, the ability to make this particular type of chemical bond could develop as a reversal of
the new catalytic pathway, provided that coupling with

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

some exergonic reaction (e.g. a phosphate group transfer
or a hydrolysis of a phosphoester bond) could be established.
In the ZnS settings, photosynthetically produced polycarbonic compounds, inorganic polyphosphates, RNA-like
oligomers, and diverse low-molecular-weight phosphorylated derivates could serve as cleavage substrates for the
first synthases. The reducing equivalents that would be
needed for some synthetic reactions were continuously
generated at the illuminated ZnS surfaces; nucleotide-containing redox cofactors, such as NADH, NADPH, FAD,
and FMN [22,214-216], could have emerged as mediators
that picked up the photoexcited electrons from photoactive ZnS surfaces and delivered them to the respective
ribozymes.
After the emergence of the first replicators capable of connecting amino acids by peptide bonds, the synthesis of
first, random polypeptide sequences at nucleotide and/or
ZnS templates could begin. Without considering the elusive chemical details, it seems fitting, as in the previous
section, to focus on selective factors that could drive the
emergence of the first polypeptides. They may have been
recruited to perform functions that did not require a particular amino acid sequence but only the ability of a
polypeptide to bind to a replicator, e.g. via the protein
backbone groups [209]. Such a binding, for example,
could protect the backbone of replicators from hydrolysis
or cleavage. In addition, the bound polypeptides could
absorb heat into which the energy of UV quanta was converted, therefore protecting the replicators from thermal
damage. It is noteworthy that, if a protecting polypeptide
could eventually discard excess energy by funnelling it
into a chemical reaction, then the probability of denaturation would have become lower. Those replicators that
could synthesize proteins capable of supporting catalysis
by (ribo)zymes [67] or catalyzing useful chemical reactions themselves may have got an advantage. Eventually
such a selection could establish a correspondence
between the nucleotide and amino acid sequences, see
[46,47,53,58,67,73,217,218] for tentative scenarios on
the evolution of genetic code and protein synthesis.
The first colonization wave
The ZnS precipitates would have attenuated the UV component of solar light, thus providing shade for the inhabitants of the lower-lying compartments. Hence a stratified
system could be established with the illuminated upper
layers accounting for maximal photosynthesis, and lower,
less productive, but more protected layers providing shelter for the first replicating entities in their pores. The
porosity of the ZnS precipitates [179,180] would have
enabled metabolite transport between the layers. Moreover, the sponge-like inner structure could eventually ena-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

ble variable hydration of the compartments that may have
served as an additional selective factor. Both the gradient
of light and the interlayer metabolite exchange are typical
of modern stratified, seashore phototrophic communities
(e.g. stromatolites [25,93,139]).
Those consortia of replicators that were able to couple
useful syntheses with exergonic chemical reactions could
have became relatively independent of upper, photosynthesizing layers and could penetrate the depths of their
porous habitats. This penetration can be considered the
first wave of the Earth's colonization by living organisms
that eventually evolved from replicating zymes. This colonization would have been supported by exchanges of
metabolites between the illuminated strata and those that
were deeper and darker. In the darkness, direct contact
between the RNA-like "bodies" of replicators and the radiation-absorbing ZnS template was no longer crucial, so
that the replicators could evolve into life forms that were
enclosed in protein envelopes resembling modern viruses
[62,70,219].
The energetics of these communities consisted in the
interplay between the continuous ZnS-mediated photosynthesis and the increasingly complex heterotrophy of
the first organisms. This heterotrophy may have been
based on coupling the exergonic breakdown of photosynthetically produced metabolites with endergonic
(bio)synthetic reactions. This same interplay of photosynthesis and heterotrophy still drives the majority of terrestrial communities today.
The fall of the Zn world
Upon further decrease in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and, accordingly, in atmospheric pressure, the
delivery of Zn-rich fluids to the surface of continents
would have gradually ceased, so that fresh, photosynthetically active ZnS surfaces could no longer form in sub-aerial settings. After that, ZnS-rich hydrothermal edifices
could persist only deeply at the sea floor, ultimately clustering around the mid-ocean ridges. The organisms that
remained confined to the sub-aerial settings would have
found alternative ways to reduce CO2. Moreover, in the
absence of a zinc supply, they were forced to confront
unfamiliar minerals, in particular those containing iron.
At that time the dominating transition metal ion in sea
water would have been Fe2+ [90,220,221]. Iron, unlike
zinc, is redox-active and can generate harmful hydroxyl
radicals [222-225]. It would seem that the expatriates of
the Zn world had to be full-fledged organisms with reliable replication machinery, robust metabolism, and protective envelopes. The story of how they could populate
the Earth is beyond the problem of the origin of life
proper and hence remains out of the scope of this com-

munication; this topic, however, is addressed in the
accompanying article [226].
Validation of the hypothesis

First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;
These, as successive generations bloom
New powers acquire and larger limbs assume.
Erasmus Darwin, The Temple of Nature, 1802 [1]

The search for a solution to the origin of life puzzle is hindered by the impossibility of providing an ultimate experimental proof, namely to (re)produce life from scratch de
novo (see e.g. [58,218]). In view of this obstacle, Wächtershäuser [227] has suggested that the hypotheses on the
origin of life could be validated by rigorous application of
Karl Popper's principles of testing scientific theories
[228,229]. Popper wrote: "We may if we like distinguish four
different lines along which the testing of a theory could be carried out. First there is the logical comparison of the conclusions
among themselves, by which the internal consistency of the system is tested. Secondly, there is the investigation of the logical
form of the theory, with the object of determining whether it has
the character of an empirical or scientific theory, or whether it
is, for example, tautological. Thirdly, there is the comparison
with other theories, chiefly with the aim of determining
whether the theory would constitute a scientific advance should
it survive our various tests. And finally, there is the testing of
the theory by way of empirical applications of the conclusions
which can be derived from it" (quoted from ref. [229]). The
core of Popper's approach is the idea of falsification, i.e.
putting a hypothesis to the test by making testable predictions and checking them. The falsification tests of the Zn
world hypothesis, because of their key importance, are
described in a separate accompanying article [226]. Here I
consider only the empirical supporting evidence, the
internal consistency of the hypothesis, and the relation of
the posited concept to other hypotheses on the origin of
life.
Supporting evidence
Below, the supporting data are organized along the steps
of the above-presented evolutionary scenario. One outstanding feature, however, deserves preferential treatment
since it is crucial for almost every one of these steps. This
feature is the unique ability of ZnS crystals to store radiation energy (see [144,230-233] for reviews). This property
manifests itself in phosphorescence (afterglow), so that
ZnS – widely known as "phosphor" – is used in numerous
devices, from various types of displays to 'glow in the
dark' items. ZnS is a broad-band n-type semiconductor
with a gap band energy of 3.2–3.9 eV (depending on the
particular crystal structure). When radiation strikes such a

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

semiconductor, it may excite an electron and consequently leave a "hole" (see Fig. 1). If the energy of the radiation quantum is larger than the band gap energy, the
electron reaches the so-called conduction zone and can
move inside the crystal. Ultimately, the electron can
recombine with the hole. However, if the electron gets
into an energy trap (see Fig. 1), then the recombination
can proceed only slowly, under the condition of thermal
activation [234]. In pure ZnS, the atoms at the surface can
trap electrons [234,235], particularly if the semiconductor
interacts with a polar solvent such as water. At the surface,
a photoexcited electron loses part of its energy owing to
the interaction with the molecules of the solvent and,
accordingly, is prevented from returning into the bulk of
ZnS. In addition, recombination may be prevented by
prompt replenishing the hole with an electron coming
from a potent electron donor ("hole scavenger"). The
trapped electron then remains confined to the surface
until an external electron acceptor, e.g. a molecule of CO2,
picks the electron up, see [144,190,234,236] for reviews.
Small nanocrystals of ZnS and of its chemical "twin" CdS
have been found to behave as quantum dots – systems
with physical properties intermediate between those of
bulk materials and single molecules [144,234,237-242].
Accordingly, these nanoparticles have drawn much attention as promising fluorescent labels for biology, so that
the interaction of proteins and nucleic acids with the CdS
and ZnS quantum dots has been intensively studied (see
[242-248] for reviews). It is noteworthy that the ZnS particles obtained from hydrothermal vent plumes could
pass through 200 nm filters [249] and, hence, can be reasonably categorized as nanoparticles.
Initial geological settings
An overall picture of primordial Earth, as based on available data, has been given in Section 2.1. The question that
is crucial for the Zn world scenario is whether atmospheric pressure was in the range of 10–100 bar when life
on Earth emerged (at this pressure range, hot hydrothermal fluids surging at sub-aerial settings would have been
enriched in Zn; see above). It is generally accepted that life
on Earth was unlikely to emerge before the end of the
impact bombardment 3.9 Ga ago [25,26,80,93,95,96].
Since reliable biogenic fossils are dated to 3.4–3.5 Ga
[135-139], life is believed to have emerged from 3.9 to 3.5
Ga [25,26,34,80,93,95,96]. Concerning the primordial
atmospheric pressure, the following estimates have been
put forward. Atmospheric pressure before condensation
of the first ocean ca. 4.4 Ga ago has been estimated as
t200 bar; this ocean condensation would have lowered
the pressure to about 100 bar [94,100]. Accordingly, each
evaporation of ocean that may have been caused by massive bombardment from 4.3 to 3.9 Ga would have transiently increased the atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric

Page 9 of 39
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

pressure 3.3 Ga ago has been estimated to have been in
the range of 2–6 bar, depending on the assumed concentration of methane in the atmosphere [97]. It is remarkable that these estimates are compatible with the
atmospheric pressure values in the range from ca. 100 bar
to ca. 10 bar in the time window from 3.9 to 3.5 Ga.
Hence, the time window when the hydrothermal ZnS
could precipitate at sub-aerial settings overlaps with the
time window when life is believed to have emerged on
Earth.
The conditions under which the first cells emerged could
be read from the chemical composition of cellular cytoplasm that apparently tends to maintain the ancient
chemical milieu [25,34,84,85]. Archaeal, bacterial, and
eukaryotic cells all show elevated concentrations of potassium, magnesium, phosphate, and certain transition
metal ions (see Table 1). The elevated amount of transition metals, as already noted, could be attributed to the
emergence of life in hydrothermal settings [25,93,113115,177]. Not in contradiction with this attribution, the
elevated amounts of K+ and Mg2+ might reflect the
involvement of volcanic activities: elevated and positively
correlated amounts of potassium and magnesium are typical of certain volcanic rocks [250].
The high phosphate concentration in cells might indicate
the abundance of phosphorus compounds in the primordial waters [85,251,252]. Since the concentration of phosphate in sea water is low (the phosphates of Ca and Mg are
poorly soluble in water), it has been argued that more
reduced compounds such as hypophosphite (phosphinate, PO22-) and/or phosphite (phosphonate, PO33-),
which have better solubility in sea water, could have been
abundant in the primeval, more reduced ocean [252258]. This suggestion is supported by findings of diverse
systems of hypophosphite and phosphite oxidation in
prokaryotes (see [259] for a review).
The high extent of hydrothermal Zn delivery to the surface
of Earth during the earliest stages of its history is reflected
in the association of present day major zinc ore deposits
(built of ZnS) with Archean oceanic spreading centres and
island arc terrains [260,261].
In summary, these features point to environments similar
to those in which VMS deposits originated (see [187,262]
for reviews). The largest VMS deposit is believed to be the
Iberian Pyrite Belt, which is 200 km long and 40 km wide.
The oldest VMS deposits discovered so far, dated 3.2–3.5
Ga, are at the Pilbara Craton of West Australia
[25,263,264]. Remarkably, besides its huge zinc content
(zinc lenses) [265,266], the Pilbara Craton also contains
filamentous microfossils [267,268]. It is tempting to speculate that the Pilbara Craton could serve as a rough model

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

of an environmental setting where life could have
emerged earlier, at the end of the Hadean, when ZnS
could precipitate, because of high atmospheric CO2 pressure, within reach of solar UV radiation.
Photosynthesis in the Zn world
The ZnS-mediated photosynthesis of diverse organic compounds from CO2, in view of its potential practical application, has been studied intensively, starting in the early
1980s [144-146,232,236,269-273]. Besides the reduction
of CO2 to formate (see Fig. 1 for a scheme), the photosynthesis of dicarbonic, tricarbonic, and tetracarbonic acids
has also been shown [146,155]. Yanagida and co-workers
have reported the photoreduction of diverse acyclic and
cyclic ketones to the corresponding alcohols [274,275]
and the ZnS mediated formation of diethylamine from
ethylamine [192]. It is noteworthy that the highest quantum yields of CO2 photoreduction, in the range of 10–
80%, were obtained, by various research groups
[144,145,148,149,155,273], with ZnS nanoparticles –
analogues to those ejected by hydrothermal vents. These
nanoparticles are particularly photosynthetically active
since the probability of electron trapping at the surface
increases with the surface/volume ratio [241,276]. Studies
of the photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 at p-type
semiconductors showed that at high CO2 pressure the rate
of reduction was principally limited only by light intensity
[277].

While studying photochemical hydrogen production in
suspensions of ZnS particles (with quantum yields reaching 90%), Reber and Meier found that the most stable,
long-lasting hydrogen production was observed when a
mixture of sodium sulfide and sodium hypophosphite
was used as a hole scavenger [278]. This system appears to
be very interesting in the evolutionary context. Here the
accumulation of disulfide ions (S2 2-) that could be caused
by sulfide (S2-) oxidation by photogenerated hole (h+) via
a sulfide anion radical (S-) as an intermediate according
to the equations

S 2− + h + → S < −
S < − + S < − → S 2−

was prevented by the reductive action of hypophosphite
that yielded phosphite, so that sulfide was recycled:
−
−
S 2− + H 2PO 2 + 3OH − → 2S 2− + HPO 3 + 2H 2O
2

After all the hypophosphite wass consumed, hydrogen
formation proceeded further, although slower, owing to
the further oxidation of phosphite into phosphate [278]:

The high efficiency of (hypo)phosphite as a hole scavenger was also demonstrated by Kanemoto and co-workers,
who studied, in addition to the photogeneration of
hydrogen, the photoreduction of CO2 by ZnS [273]. As
already noted, hypophosphite and phosphite may have
been abundant in the primordial ocean [252-254,256258] and could participate in the primeval photosynthesis. Moreover, phosphate ions, ultimate products of the
(photo)oxidation, owing to their affinity to metal sulfides
[279], would have remained adsorbed at the ZnS surface,
providing a specific phosphate-rich reaction milieu.
The aforementioned photo-oxidation of sulfur aniones
can eventually lead to disruption of the ZnS crystals and
release of Zn2+ ions that could not be completely prevented even by efficient hole scavengers [271]. In the context of primordial photochemistry, such a photocorrosion
would have led to the continuous rejuvenation of the ZnS
surfaces and the formation of fresh (photo)catalytic interfaces. In addition, photocorrosion would have continuously released Zn2+ ions, keeping their concentration at
the illuminated ZnS surfaces high.
Besides reducing organic compounds and catalysing condensation reactions, semiconductors can drive the photoreduction of dinitrogen to ammonium. This reaction
has been demonstrated with preparations of CdS [280]
and TiO2 [281-284]. The photoreducing capacity of ZnS is
higher than that of CdS and TiO2 [154,190], and therefore
one would expect that primordial ZnS systems were capable of reducing dinitrogen to ammonium as well, thus
complementing the ammonium content of hydrothermal
fluids. The interaction of formate, produced upon CO2
reduction, with ammonium could yield formamide,
which could serve as a universal building block for the
(photocatalyzed) synthesis of both nucleobases and
amino acids [285].

would expect that complex organic compounds would
break into pieces in outer space. This is not the case;
instead, the "pieces" join together at surfaces to build
complex aromatic S-systems that apparently are more stable than simpler compounds against diverse types of cosmic radiation.
Senanayake and Idriss showed that TiO2 surfaces catalyzed a UV-powered transition of formamide into nucleobases [196]. These results document the ability of
seemingly "destructive" UV light to drive syntheses of
increasingly complex compounds at semiconducting surfaces.
Sutherland and co-workers have obtained activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides from cyanamide, cyanoacetylene,
glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, and inorganic phosphate
in a reaction that bypassed free ribose. The synthesis
yielded activated ribonucleotide E-ribocytidine-2',3'cyclic phosphate as a major product and several co-products [17]. Prolonged irradiation of this mixture by 254 nm
UV-light caused the destruction of various co-products
and the partial conversion of E-ribocytidine-2',3'-cyclic
phosphate into E-ribouridine-2',3'-cyclic phosphate. The
authors concluded that there must be some (photo)protective mechanism functioning with the two natural
nucleotides but not with other pyrimidine nucleosides
and nucleotides [17].

Taken all together, these data support the suggestion that
porous ZnS edifices, when formed at the UV-irradiated
surface of primordial Earth, could photoreduce CO2 and
other chemical compounds. On a geological scale, the
productivity of this photosynthesis may have been
immense.

The reason for the particularly high photostability of
nucleobases has recently been clarified [164,165,288293]. Two types of photochemical reaction paths, which
lead to an extremely fast transition from the excited state
into the ground state, have been identified, namely (i) the
torsion of certain C-N bonds of rings and (ii) the de-protonation of azine or amino groups [164,292,293]. Both
mechanisms require nitrogen atoms in the rings, which
might explain the rather counter-intuitive (for a CO2dominated environment) selection of nitrogenous compounds as constituents of RNA. More recently, it has been
argued that the high photostability of nucleobases is not
affected by their alkylation; such alkylated, mostly methylated, derivates (known as minor nucleobases) are found
in the structures of tRNA and rRNA [294]. Together, major
and minor nucleobases could represent the initial pool of
primeval photostable compounds from which the major
nucleobases were gradually selected by evolution [22].

First settlers in the ZnS world
The suggested accumulation of complex but photostable
S-systems in the UV-illuminated environments is in agreement with the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in meteorites [194,286], as well as with the reported
synthesis of nucleotides from simpler precursors at the
outer surfaces of Russian spacecraft [287]. Generally, one

To survive, the RNA-like oligomers should be resistant not
only to solar UV light but also to the (photo)chemical
activity of ZnS itself. The reducing potential of photoexcited ZnS is in the range of between -1.0 V and -2.0 V,
depending on the crystal structure [149,154,295]. This is
low enough to reduce CO2 (see Fig. 1), but insufficient to
reduce any of the nucleobases that all have reducing

Page 11 of 39
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

potentials of less than -2.0 V [296,297]. On the other
hand, as indicated by the energy diagram of Fig. 1, the
holes that are formed in photoexcited ZnS have an oxidizing potential of > 2 V [154,190] and can potentially oxidize almost any adsorbed organic molecule, including
nucleobases or nucleotides. Such an oxidation, however,
is unlikely for two reasons. First, since ZnS is an n-type
semiconductor, the holes, unlike electrons, are not mobile
[298]. Second, ZnS contains intrinsic electron donors,
namely sulfur anions (S2-), which should "outrun" external electron donors and reduce the immobile holes, yielding sulfur anion radicals, S- [298,299]. The formed Sradicals could either dismutate according to eq. 2, with
the formation of disulfide anions [300], or they could be
reduced by external hole scavengers (see eqs. 3 and 4 and
[278]), or they could interact with organic compounds
yielding their sulfo-derivates; in any case, however, they
should not be able to oxidize nucleobases or nucleotides
that all have oxidizing potentials above 1.2 V at neutral
pH [301].
Photochemical damage from ZnS was also unlikely.
Nucleobases absorb light at 260–270 nm and emit it at
300–310 nm [159,302]. ZnS nanoparticles absorb light in
a broad range up to approx. 350 nm and emit light at
420–470 nm [144,303]. Therefore the radiation energy
could be transferred from the adsorbed nucleotides to a
ZnS template (and thus contribute to the CO2 reduction),
but not in the reverse direction. Hence, the quanta directly
absorbed by the ZnS templates would not damage the
adsorbed RNA-like replicators.
Besides nucleobases, the primeval RNA-like polymers
may have contained ribose and phosphate entities. Ribose
may have been abundant as one of the products of the
autocatalytic "formose" reaction, which was discovered by
Butlerov in 1861 [304] and which yields a mixture of pentoses and hexoses from formaldehyde. Although Butlerov's reaction remains the only known autocatalytic
reaction that does not require specific catalysts, the importance of this reaction for prebiological syntheses has been
questioned since the yield of ribose in the product mixture
is usually low. Recent studies have shown, however, that
the yield of ribose can be selectively enhanced by the presence of phosphate in the reaction medium [305], by UV
illumination [16], and by conducting the reaction in the
presence of catalytic mineral templates [306]. More
recently, it has been demonstrated that the yields of pentoses increase to 60% and those of the ribose proper rise
to 20% in the presence of a zinc-proline complex as a catalyst [15]. The Zn world settings may have favoured autocatalytic ribose formation from photosynthesized
substrates by providing mineral templates, UV irradiation,
and plenty of Zn2+ ions as catalysts.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

It has been argued that biological stereoselectivity (homochirality), i.e. the utilization of only particular optical isomers by living organisms, could have begun from the
selection of a particular D-isomer of ribose – since nucleobases and phosphate groups are non-chiral [307]. Generally, homochirality cannot be completely explained in
the framework of the "primordial soup" concept [3-5],
because stereoisomers are chemically indistinguishable in
a homogenous solution. At a surface, however, the properties of two stereoisomers could differ [307], as first
pointed out by Goldschmidt, who has suggested that mineral surfaces were involved as templates in abiogenesis
[35,308]. The two other tentative mechanisms of primordial stereoselectivity are (i) photoselection by polarized
UV light (see [309] and references therein), and (ii) enantiomeric autocatalysis (see [310,311] for reviews). An
example of this latter mechanism is the Soai reaction,
where heteroaromatic aldehydes react with organo-zinc
compounds, yielding respective alcohols, which in turn
serve as asymmetric catalysts for their own formation. If
one of the substrate enantiomers is present even in small
excess, the autocatalytic reaction can yield the corresponding product with up to 95% enantiomeric excess [312314]. Although the mechanism of the Soai reaction
remains unclear, Zn2+ ions might be important – zinc-proline complexes were also shown to mediate stereoselective
catalysis of aldole reactions in water [315]. At this point it
is appropriate to mention that the Zn world settings could
support all these mechanisms of stereoselectivity by providing (i) electrically charged surfaces with regular patterns of positive and negative charges, (ii) Zn2+ ions that
could build potentially catalytic complexes with diverse
organic compounds, and (iii) UV light that would become
polarized after passing through the ZnS crystals [316].
These factors resemble strikingly the aforementioned features that increased the ribose yield in the autocatalytic
Butlerov's reaction. Although the relative importance of
the above-named features for prebiological stereoselective
and/or autocatalytic syntheses of D-ribose and other sugars remains unclear, they can be experimentally tested: the
stereoselective (photo)catalysis of diverse organic reactions at the surface of ZnS is an established approach in
photochemistry [191,317-320].
Turning to the suggestion that the primordial waters were
enriched not in phosphate but in the better soluble phosphite, it is worth noting that phosphate and/or phosphite
groups may have catalyzed prebiotic syntheses
[17,32,305,321,322], serve as bridges upon connecting
nucleobases with metal sulfides [279,323], participate in
UV-driven photochemical reactions [324], prevent
hydrolysis of the first oligomers [325], and interact with
diverse organic molecules, yielding their phosphorylated
derivates [252,326]. It is tempting to speculate that the
oxidation of phosphite ions, as hole scavengers, upon

Page 12 of 39

ZnS-mediated photosynthesis (see above) may have been
coupled with their involvement in polymerization reactions as catalysts, yielding surface-confined oligomers
connected by phosphate groups [252,255,327].
The Zn world concept is consistent with a direct assembly
of polynucleotides at ZnS surfaces either from stacked
nucleobases, ribose molecules, and phosphate/phosphite
linkers or, perhaps, even from simpler parts (as exemplified by Sutherland and co-workers [17]). It is plausible
that diverse (photo)synthetic pathways may have been
realized at the ZnS surfaces with the output being essentially determined by photoselection of most stable compounds.
The light-induced energy transfer between adsorbed
organic dyes, single nucleotides, and polynucleotides on
the one hand, and ZnS/CdS templates on the other hand,
has been intensively studied [242-244,247,328]. In one
case at least, it has been quantified that an organic dye fac
tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium, when adsorbed on a ZnS
surface, can serve as an antenna and increase the amount
of quanta captured by ZnS [329]. This result supports the
possibility of a positive feedback between the number of
UV-light-absorbing zymes in a ZnS compartment and the
yield of photosynthetically produced metabolites.
DNA and RNA are capable of long-range energy transfer
along stacked nucleobases, over tens of nucleotide pairs
[330-333]. In the context of the primordial Zn world, this
property could have been useful: if a UV quantum hit a
nucleotide having no direct contact with an energyabsorbing template, then, owing to the coupling between
the stacked and paired nucleobases, the excess energy
would still have promptly sunk into the ZnS substratum.
The suggestion that RNA-like polymers could bind, via
negatively charged phosphate groups, to ZnS surfaces is
supported by the ready adsorption of nucleic acids on the
ZnS/CdS nanoparticles [243,247,328,334-340] The
assembly of RNA-like polymers at the ZnS surface should
be greatly facilitated by the complementary match
between the patterns of electrically charged groups at the
surfaces of polynucleotides and ZnS, respectively. Such a
matching was shown for the CdS nanoparticles, which
formed spontaneously from added cadmium salts in the
presence of polynucleotides as templates [341,342]. This
match may have a straightforward explanation: the distance between the positively charged Cd2+/Zn2+ ions of
0.58/0.54 nm, respectively, in the nanoparticles
[343,344] is similar to the distance of 0.58–0.59 nm
between the phosphate groups in the RNA backbone
[345].

Wächtershäuser has suggested that a regular mesh of electric charges at the surface may have made the primeval
polymerization thermodynamically more favourable by
attracting reactants and arranging them appropriately relative to each other [124]. De Duve and Miller have countered him by noting that if the polymerization at the
surface was thermodynamically more favourable than in
the bulk solution then the polymers could not detach
without "paying" the respective energy fee and would
have remained confined to the surface [200]. As argued
above, such confinement would have prevented photodestruction of the polymer molecules and favoured their
interactions at the ZnS surfaces. It is worth noting that a
mechanism of thermodynamic confinement is actually
exploited by nature upon the synthesis of ATP from ADP
and inorganic phosphate by membrane ATP synthases.
While the free energy of ATP synthesis in water is about
+50 kJ/mol, molecules of ATP build up spontaneously in
the enzyme active site, the reaction being facilitated by a
positively charged arginine residue [346,347]. The molecules of ATP, however, remain tightly bound: they can
leave the catalytic pocket only after the free energy of
membrane potential is used to open the pocket and to
reorient the arginine residue; ATP can then dissociate into
the water phase [346]. The phosphate group in ATP is
linked by a phosphoester bond that is similar to those
connecting the nucleotides in RNA and DNA. Hence, as
compared to a reaction in a bulk-water phase, the formation of phosphoester bonds can indeed be favoured when
the reactants are appropriately arranged and a positive
charge is present nearby.
Orgel and co-workers have studied the polymerization of
guanosine 5'-phosphorimidazolide on a polycytidylic
acid template in the presence of a variety of metal salts
[198,348]. They found that "none of the metal ions investigated behaved like Zn2+ in favoring the formation of the naturally occurring 3'-5' linkages" (quoted from [198]). A
specific role of Zn2+ ions in shaping the proper 3'-5' linkages follows also from the recent work of Hadley and coworkers. They selected deoxyribozymes that could ligate
RNA and found that the native 3'-5' linkages were built
only by those deoxyribozymes that were dependent on
zinc [349]. In addition, mostly 3'-5' bonding has been
observed upon the radiation-driven polymerization of
nucleotides at the surface of volcanic rocks [350]. Hence,
both Zn2+ ions and mineral templates seem to favour the
formation of proper 3'-5' bonds.
The emergence of longer RNA strings could have proceeded not only via polymerization but also through
spontaneous rearrangements of RNA sequences that may
progress in the absence of any enzymes or ribozymes
[351-353]; such rearrangements may have dramatically
accelerated evolution [57,354].

In sum, the (photo)catalytic properties of Zn2+ ions and
Zn-containing substances could have shaped the first life
forms. While the photochemistry of ZnS crystals could
have governed the nature of photosynthesized compounds and that of their photo-derivates, the catalytic
properties of Zn2+ ions may have determined the particular traits of the first (bio)molecules, such as the choice of
3'-5' linkages for RNA polymers.
The first replicators and the emergence of proteins and enzymes
Earlier, while hypothesizing on the selective advantage of
paired RNA strands over those unpaired in primordial
UV-illuminated settings [112], we built on empirical evidence of the higher UV stability of double-stranded RNA
samples as compared to single-stranded ones [204-206].
Recently, the physical background of this higher photostability has been clarified. For the nucleotides that form a
Watson-Crick pair, the lifetime of the excited state has
been estimated to be as low as a few femtoseconds
[355,356], i.e. ca. one hundred times shorter than that of
single bases [159-163]. This extremely short lifetime has
been attributed to excited-state deactivation via electrondriven proton shuttling between the bases [357-359]. It is
noteworthy that other possible (not Watson-Crick) conformers of paired nucleobases have not shown these
unique photochemical properties [355]. It has been suggested "that the biologically relevant Watson-Crick structures
of GC and AT are distinguished by uniquely efficient excitedstate deactivation mechanisms which maximize their photostability" (quoted from [164]).

It is necessary to emphasize that neither the high photostability of single nucleobases [159-165,288-293], nor the
even higher stability of their Watson-Crick pairs
[164,355,356], nor the aptitude for long-range energy
transfer along stacked nucleotides [330,333,360] have
anything to do with the current functioning of RNA and
DNA in the transfer of genetic information. All these
traits, however, support the suggested involvement of UV
light as a selecting factor during the initial stages of evolution [105,112,133,159,164]. This selection pressure
would have favoured the relative enrichment of photostable aggregates built of paired RNA-like strands with a
potential for self-replication.
The idea of primeval RNA-based self-replicating aggregates got additional support from the work of Lincoln and
Joyce who presented a system of two ribozymes that catalyzed synthesis of each other from a total of four oligonucleotide substrates. These cross-replicating RNA enzymes
underwent self-sustaining exponential amplification in
the absence of proteins or other biological materials [72].
The data on specific affinity of various proteins to the ZnS/
CdS nanoparticles [243,246,361-364] suggest that ZnS

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

surfaces could serve as templates for the synthesis of the
first polypeptides or as baseplates for the first protein synthases. A primeval RNA machine capable of making peptide bonds has been recently unveiled by Bokov and
Steinberg based on a detailed analysis of the structure of
the modern ribosome [73]. As the first protein synthases
most likely began by generating random polypeptides
[73], it might be useful to consider – in a search for tentative sequence-independent functions of the first proteins
– the traits that are common for all polypeptides. To perform sequence-independent functions, the first polypeptides should have been able to interact with
polynucleotides via their backbone atoms. Carter and
Kraut have suggested that a protein chain can fit into the
minor groove of an RNA helix, with hydrogen bonds
being formed between the ribose 2'-hydroxyls and carbonyl oxygen atoms of peptide bonds, in an interaction that
is RNA-specific and is not possible in the case of DNA
[365]. Indeed, hydrogen bonding between the protein
backbone oxygen atoms and the ribose 2'-hydroxyls has
been found in many RNA-protein complexes [366]. This
ability of proteins to block the 2'-hydroxyls of ribose entities may have increased the life span of primordial RNA
polymers. The aforementioned ability of Zn2+ ions to catalyze the formation of proper 3'-5' linkages [198,349]
implies the ability of Zn2+ ions also to catalyze cleavage of
these linkages. Butzow and Eichhorn have noted that the
Zn2+-catalyzed cleavage of RNA starts from the binding of
a Zn2+ ion between the 2'-hydroxyl group of ribose and
the phosphate group [367]. It is tempting to speculate that
the first polypeptides could protect the RNA molecules
from metal-catalyzed cleavage by preventing the binding
of Zn2+ ions to the 2'-OH groups of ribose.
The (photo)stability of polynucleotides and proteins, as
argued by Sobolewski and Domcke [164], is ensured by
reversible proton relocation within picoseconds between
the Watson-Crick-paired nucleotides and along the protein hydrogen bonds, respectively. In other words, the
reshuffling of protons along hydrogen bonds can
promptly split a large "captured" energy quantum into
many small, non-hazardous heat quanta, both in nucleic
acid polymers and in proteins [164]. In a UV-irradiated
environment, this feature should favour the selection of
structures with many intrinsic hydrogen bonds, such as
paired RNA or DNA strands, protein D-helices and Esheets, as well as hydrogen-bonded RNA-protein aggregates. Turning to the previously discussed relation
between the stability of polymers and their ability to perform work, the shuttling of protons along hydrogen
bonds might be considered as a kind of work that could be
carried out at picoseconds, i.e. much faster than any bond
dissociation could take place. It is noteworthy that the
acid-base catalysis, seemingly prevalent in ribozymes and
enzymes [368-371], consists of proton relocation(s)

Page 14 of 39

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

between the donor and acceptor groups [372-374].
Accordingly, the selection of hydrogen-bonded systems as
more (photo)stable ones could have paved the way to the
first catalytic centres, first in ribozymes and then in proteins.
Several authors, based on quite different premises, have
argued that the first genetically coded amino acids were
the neutral and acidic, starting from glycine, alanine,
valine, and aspartate, with the positively charged amino
acids being added later [46,47,53,375,376]. In the
absence of positively charged amino acids, metal ions
and, in particular, Zn2+ ions, could have been recruited by
the first enzymes as catalytic Lewis acids (Manfred Eigen,
personal communication).
In summary, the illuminated ZnS settings may have contributed to the emergence of first replicators and enzymes
by favouring the formation of photostable, hydrogenbonded structures, by serving as templates upon syntheses, and by providing Zn2+ ions as potent catalytic cofactors.
Colonization waves
Chetverin and co-workers have introduced and studied
RNA colonies that grew and propagated on gels or other
solid media provided that RNA replicases and ribonucleoside triphosphates were present [351,377,378]. It has
been explicitly noted that such experimental systems
might, in fact, model the amplification and propagation
of the first replicators in primordial environmental settings [57,351,354]. Further indications of primeval RNA
life might be the participation of tRNA molecules as catalysts in several metabolic reactions (see [23] and references therein) and interactions of RNA molecules with
metabolites [379,380], in particular in the case of riboswitches [381,382].

As argued by Koonin and co-workers, viral hallmark genes
shared by many groups of RNA and DNA viruses – but
missing in cellular life forms – might be relics from the
pre-cellular RNA/protein world [61]. Moreover, the specific affinity of many metabolic enzymes to RNA
[383,384] could also stem from the life forms that were
built of RNA and proteins.
Last but not least, porous, inhabited ZnS settings still persist around deep-sea hydrothermal vents; their dwellers,
mostly archaea, have been characterized on several occasions [179,181].
At the end of this chapter, it is fair to note that a large part
of the cited evidence comes from nanotechnology
research in which ZnS/CdS nanoparticles are paradigmatic objects of study. Still, while sifting through the lit-

the
interaction
of
nucleobases,
polynucleotides, and proteins with ZnS/CdS nanoparticles (see e.g. [242-244,246,247,328,334-342,361364,385]), it is difficult to avoid the impression that the
"intrinsic affinity of (poly)nucleotides for semiconductor surfaces" (quoted from ref. [334]) is particularly specific. In
the framework of the Zn world scenario, it is tempting to
speculate that, while interacting keenly with the ZnS/CdS
surfaces, the biological polymers might recall their evolutionary past.
Evolutionary continuity in the Zn world
A scenario for the evolution of a complex system must
consist of plausible elementary steps, each conferring a
distinct advantage (Darwinian continuity principle; see
also ref. [27,67,218]). Furthermore, these steps also have
to be physically plausible, which implies, in addition to
the correspondence with physical laws, the continuity of
underlying mechanisms and driving forces. Below, the
interplay between the Darwinian and physical continuities in the Zn world is considered in more detail.
Multifarious energetics of the Zn world
Admittedly, the least physically plausible step in the available origin of life scenarios is the abiogenic emergence of
complex polymers capable of replication and catalysis. As
discussed above, at least one type of polymer should have
been continuously emerging under primeval settings to
enable a selection of first catalytic entities that could gradually develop an ability to synthesize other types of polymers. Based on the aforementioned arguments, these
primary polymers could be related to modern RNA. The
synthesis of RNA and DNA molecules in modern organisms is driven by the hydrolysis of ATP molecules and carried out by sophisticated enzyme systems. Turning to the
primordial Earth, one has a typical "chicken and egg" paradox: on the one hand, high-yield polymerization would
seemingly have required specific machinery for coupling
with exergonic reactions, yet, on the other hand, this
machinery was likely to have been absent before the first
catalytic polymers have emerged. One of the virtues of the
Zn world scenario is the possibility to funnel UV energy
into polymerization reactions. In addition, the thermodynamically very favourable oxidation of phosphite to phosphate could potentially provide free energy. Furthermore,
the polymerization at ZnS surfaces could be more favourable than in the bulk-water phase (see above). Nevertheless, it is unclear whether these factors alone could have
been sufficient for maintaining a notable steady-state
population of RNA-like polymers – needed as starting
material for further evolutionary transformations. The
results of our earlier Monte-Carlo simulations of primordial photochemistry [112], suggest one more, rather paradoxical, way to channel external energy into the synthesis
of increasingly complex compounds.

The aim of the simulations was to quantify the significance of the UV protection mechanism for the evolution
of primordial RNA-like polymers by computer modelling
of the polymerization of sugar-phosphate monomers in
the presence of nucleobases.
1) "Dark" simulations (with "virtual" UV light
switched off and a polymerization constant of > 1)
yielded polymers that, as expected, did not carry
nucleobases, since the equilibrium constant of their
attachment to the sugar-phosphate units was taken, in
accordance with the actual situation, as <<1 (see [112]
for further details). Despite a high polymerization
constant, the elongation of polymers was not unconstrained. The explanation as suggested by D.
Cherepanov (personal communication) is the following: if a linear polymer contains n monomers, the
binding of new monomers can proceed only at the
two terminal positions, while dissociation can implicate any bond, i.e. it can proceed at (n-1) positions.
Hence, the probability of dissociation should increase
with the value of n and prevent the formation of excessively long polymers. This straightforward consideration, as well as the simulation results, discount the
common belief that the longer polymers could have
built up solely by means of their postulated higher stability against hydrolysis as compared to shorter polymers (see e.g. [386]).

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

Result no. 4 is physically trivial because it follows from
the enabled channelling of the virtual solar energy into
the synthetic reactions. However, the increase in the relative fraction of longer, nucleobase-carrying polymers
solely in response to switching on the UV protection
(result no. 3) is not trivial at all, because in this case the
utilization of radiation energy for synthesis was not "permitted". Here, the increase in the fraction of complex polymers was due to the breakage of the less photostable
molecules by the virtual UV light. Since the number of
molecules in the Monte-Carlo simulation was limited, the
relative fraction of more photostable and, accordingly,
more complex polymers increased. Therefore – and this is
the key point – the enrichment in more complex RNA-like
polymers was driven by the photo-dissociation of their
less stable counterparts, in the absence of any direct coupling between the energy flow and the synthetic reactions.

3) With the UV protection "switched on" (so that the
binding of a nucleobase to a sugar-phosphate unit
decreased the probability of UV breakage by a factor of
30), the length of formed polymers increased dramatically. Even more importantly, under these conditions
the fraction of nucleobase-carrying sugar-phosphates
increased significantly (up to ~0.5; see [112]).

From the experimental viewpoint, the results of this modelling might be related to the aforementioned finding of
Sutherland and co-workers that prolonged UV illumination of the reaction medium containing a set of pyrimidine nucleotides and nucleosides led to the enrichment of
photostable natural nucleotides on account of non-natural compounds [17]. From the theoretical viewpoint, the
described mechanism of "indirect" energy utilization
might be related to the so-called Landauer principle. Rolf
Landauer, while working for IBM, demonstrated that,
contrary to common belief, information per se could be
created in a reversible way, i.e. "for free". Further analysis
has shown, however, that energy would then be required
to erase all the intermediate steps of such a reversible computation from the computer memory [387-390]. Accordingly, the creation of information requires energy in any
case, but the energy can be utilized in two different ways:
(i) for creating the information itself and/or (ii) for erasing the "garbage" from the system. It is noteworthy that
the need for "erasing energy" arose because Landauer had
considered a physically realistic computer with a limited
number of memory units. At least on this point, Landauer's formalism corresponds to our Monte-Carlo simulation that also invoked a limited number of building
blocks [112].

4) We also simulated the effect of the partial funnelling of UV energy into the condensation reactions by
assuming that with a probability as small as 9 × 10-8 a
photogenerated radical could bind a nucleobase in a
proper, productive way. The resulting boost for the
formation of oligonucleotides was remarkable concerning the length of the formed polymer chains and
the extent of nucleobase incorporation into the oligomers, so that the long polymers were built predominantly from nucleobase-carrying sugar-phosphate
units (i.e. nucleotides; see [112]).

Several authors have argued recently that the physical
model of Landauer might be related to biology, in particular to creating and maintaining increasingly complex life
systems [92,391-393]. As noted by Danchin, "creation of
information requires many steps, it starts from a given complex
of dynamic interacting entities, that progressively transforms
into variants, among which some have a higher information
than that of the original complex" [92]. It would seem that
this quotation is equally applicable to computation processes and to the evolution of first RNA-like polymers on
primordial Earth. Then, however, the emergence of

2) After turning the virtual UV light on and in the
absence of UV protection, with UV quanta being able
to cleave the sugar-phosphate bonds, the polymerization yield dropped severely, and the extent of nucleobase incorporation in the polymers remained close to
zero.

Page 16 of 39
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

increasingly complex RNA-like polymers could be driven
by the energy-consuming, selective erasing of less "perfect" variants. Danchin writes that this type of selection
process has to "actively discriminate between entities that are
in some degree functional and those that cannot function. This
is because the process needs to avoid destroying the elements
that carry increased information, and this is where energy
comes in. Energy has to be consumed to make innovations stand
out, in a discriminant process: energy is used to prevent degradation of functional entities, permitting destruction of the nonfunctional ones" (quoted from [92]). It is noteworthy that
Danchin has invoked Landauer's formalism to describe
the aging phenomena. Still, this approach seems to be
applicable to the primordial RNA-like polymers in the Zn
world, provided that we consider the more photostable
constructs as "functional" ones and the solar UV radiation
as the selecting and erasing energy input. In fact, since the
more complex, longer polymers have more opportunities
to fold or aggregate with the formation of UV-stable double strands, the increase in photostability should be coupled with the increase in complexity and, accordingly, in
the information content (see also below). Incidentally,
the interplay between supporting and erasing energy
fluxes, which is apparent in the case of photostable RNAlike molecules, might represent the physical essence of
biological evolution (see [92,394,395] for related discussions).
In any case, the competition between the RNA-like oligomers should have been tough in the primeval Zn world.
The ZnS compartments (pores) could accommodate only
a limited number of polymers, so that the enrichment of
more photostable polymers – driven by the photo-dissociation of the less fit ones – must have been pronounced.
In addition, the survival of a molecule depended not only
on possession of apt UV quenchers but also on binding to
a mineral template capable of absorbing excess radiation
energy, so that primordial polymers would have competed for free surface patches. In this competition, the
RNA-like polymers that, as argued above, could match the
ZnS surfaces electrostatically would have gained an
advantage.
It is possible to conclude that in the Zn world the energy
of solar UV radiation may have been utilized in three different, although complementary, ways, namely: (i) for a
high-yield, ZnS-mediated photosynthesis of diverse
organic compounds, (ii) for fortuitous photopolymerization events, and (iii) for relative enrichment of the photostable, surface-adsorbed RNA-like polymers via the
systematic photo-dissociation of more labile molecules.
Reproduction and replication in the Zn world
A few authors have noted that the origin of life could be a
two-step process, with the emergence of the first replica-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

tors being facilitated by the pre-existence of out-of-equilibrium settings favouring their formation (see e.g.
[27,396,397] and references therein). Dyson has hypothesized that the emergence of the first life forms capable of
error-free replication may have been preceded by simpler
reproducing systems where interacting chemical cycles,
supported by external energy sources, could reach homeostasis and persist over time. He has even speculated that
such reproducing systems could have evolved and
attained complexity comparable to that of modern cells
[398]. The Zn world settings can be considered out-ofequilibrium and reproducing, with their persistence being
guaranteed by the hydrothermal activity of Earth and by
solar energy. The precipitation of ZnS around hot springs
would have led to a continuous reproduction of new,
empty compartments [61,176,219] where the selection of
replicators could proceed on a geological timescale. In
such settings, photostable compounds could have continuously emerged and undergone photoselection for millions of years, until their particular mutual interaction
yielded an aggregate capable of robust self-replication.
The emergence of life can therefore be considered not as
an accident, but as a natural outcome of the interplay
between solar radiation and particular geothermal processes on primordial Earth.
The role of reproducing, illuminated ZnS settings may
have been in enabling the (photo)selection of the first
replicating entities. Hence, this solar-powered selection
may have been a link between abiogenic reproducing systems and the first replicators.
The origin of meaningful complexity in the Zn world
Since the organisms, and not the polynucleotide molecules, are the subjects of evolution, some authors have
noted that nucleotide strings (e.g. the genes that code particular proteins) are meaningless unless the machinery
that translates the DNA/RNA-coded information into the
final products is explicitly taken into account, see [399401]. The Zn world scenario suggests how the biological
meaning could emerge gradually, being driven by
(photo)selection, with the more photostable systems
gaining selective advantage upon each step. Indeed, if we
could trace, in a UV-irradiated environment, the fate of
two RNA-like polymers of the same length and the same
information content (see [402,403] for surveys of relevant
definitions), we may find that the polymer that could fold
into a structure with more double-stranded segments and/
or to bind tightly to an energy-absorbing template could
endure more hits by UV quanta. Therefore each polymer
could be characterized by its (i) intrinsic complexity
related to the probability of its emergence [402,403] and
(ii) extrinsic complexity, the value of which would reflect
its survival chances in given settings and could change
depending on conditions. The more stable constructs,

Page 17 of 39
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

with higher complexity, would have had longer lifetimes
and be steadily present in relatively larger numbers.
Hence, they would have had more chances to interact with
other stable constructs to form even more elaborate aggregates. At the moment when one such aggregate begins to
replicate itself, the complexity of its constituents, thus far
related to their survival chances in a UV-irradiated environment, becomes biologically meaningful. At the very
same moment, the nucleobases – which were hitherto acting solely as efficient UV-protecting units – become the
letters of the genetic alphabet. In this framework, the
"meaning", in the biological sense, is intrinsically coupled
with the survival chances under given circumstances and
thus can precede the emergence of the translation machinery (that could have gradually developed later; see e.g.
[46,47,58,67,73] for tentative scenarios).
Since polynucleotides do not last long in nature, replication can be considered as a way to preserve (accumulate)
information before an information carrier – a polynucleotide strand – eventually breaks down because of thermal
fluctuation or (photo)cleavage. It is likely that the first
replicating systems invoked linear polymers because the
replication of branched polymers – as a logical alternative
– may have been mechanistically impracticable.
In summary, we have an example of a Darwinian function
co-option [404]: the "irreducible complexity" of the first
replicators can still be reduced by suggesting that their
simpler "ancestors" underwent selection for a different,
less structurally demanding aptitude (namely for their
ability to survive in a UV-irradiated environment).
Physical continuity of life
Living organisms are routinely considered as systems that
sustain themselves by converting "few" high-quality
energy quanta into "many" low-quality, thermal quanta,
this process being accompanied by entropy production,
see [87,90,209,405]. These high-quality (or high-energy)
quanta are those that contain portions of energy large
enough to drive chemical reactions, such as the quanta of
light in the UV and visible ranges or the energy portions
that are released upon redox reactions. In such a framework, biological evolution could be understood as a way
to optimize the utilization of high-energy quanta
[90,209].

The evolution of energy conversion at the earliest evolutionary stages, e.g. in the RNA world, as well as the driving
force(s) beyond this evolution have remained, however,
undefined. In modern organisms, the conversion and
storage both of the energy of light and of chemical energy
are carried out by membrane enzymes that catalyze
sophisticated chains of redox reactions (see e.g. [176,406408] for reviews). It is noteworthy that (known) natural

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

ribozymes cannot store either the energy of light or the
redox energy [68]. Not surprisingly, the traditional concept of the RNA world has circumvented the question of
exploiting the external energy fluxes.
Before addressing this question, it is useful to realize that
the ability of high-energy quanta to drive chemical reactions does not require these reactions to be useful. For a
living organism, the outcome from capturing a UV quantum may have been hazardous rather than beneficial. In
the Zn world, where surface-confined photosynthesized
molecules could not escape solar UV light, the first RNAlike polymers may have initially been selected not for
their ability to exploit the high-energy quanta but for the
ability to discard them promptly or, in other words, to
"process" them without undergoing photodamage. The
ability to discard the energy quanta is less structurally
demanding than the ability to exploit them, so, as argued
above, this ability may already have been inherent in simple organic molecules. It is tempting to suggest that the
common energetic denominator of living organisms –
throughout the whole evolutionary time span – may have
been, not the ability to exploit high-energy quanta, but
the ability to "deal" with them – in a general sense.
This suggestion makes it possible to follow a continuous
evolutionary thread from the origin of life event to the
modern struggle of mankind for energy. At the beginning
of this thread, the first RNA-like polymers could have
emerged as systems capable of discarding potentially hazardous high-energy quanta without undergoing damage.
The energy requirements of the first replicators could have
been covered by the breakdown of "nutrients" produced
in photosynthetic but abiogenic reactions. The first heterotrophic organisms, while retaining the ability to discard
excess energy, could have gradually developed abilities to
control the high-energy quanta and to use them. It is plausible that solar energy, besides serving as a selective factor,
may have occasionally promoted chemical reactions (e.g.
as happens in natural photolyases [409,410] or in an artificial deoxyribozyme with photolyase activity [411]). The
funnelling of high-energy quanta into useful reactions
may have been profitable per se and, in addition, could
have prevented undesirable overheating and denaturation. However, only the emergence of biogenic dielectrics,
namely proteins and phospholipid membranes, enabled
the storage of the energy of light in the form of charge-separated states, physically analogous to those involved in
ZnS-mediated photosynthesis (see Fig. 1 and the accompanying article [226]). This development may have paved
the way to the first phototrophic organisms in which
membrane-embedded, energy-converting systems could
have developed, supposedly, from the UV-protecting
membrane proteins of the first cells [226,412]. It is noteworthy that modern chlorophyll-carying proteins, besides

Page 18 of 39
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

being involved in the storing and utilization of solar
energy, retain the ability to protect cell DNA from the
residual UV component of solar radiation [413], thus
resembling the nucleobases that, in addition to serving as
the letters of genetic code, continue to protect DNA and
RNA backbones from UV damage [159]. In this framework, the gradually attained ability to exploit high-energy
quanta of light can be considered as an evolutionary
younger, as compared to their deactivation, and more
sophisticated way of dealing with them. As the accessible
energy assets ran out, living organisms had to "acquire
new powers" (quotation from [1]), i.e. increase their complexity, if they wanted to access and exploit new energy
sources (see [21,90,209] for detailed considerations of
this point).
In summary, the emergence of life on Earth may be traced
to the successful attempt of particular (hetero)cyclic molecules to overcome, in a joint effort, the hazards of solar
UV rays that they could not escape.
Relationship to other hypotheses on the origin of life
The suggested scenario invokes elements from different,
even seemingly contradicting, hypotheses on the origin of
life. This should not be surprising, since each of these
hypotheses builds upon empirical data and/or certain theoretical bases. Accordingly, these empirical observations
and theoretical considerations have to be accounted for
by any scenario that claims to serve as a platform for further discussions in the field.

Oparin's hypothesis of a heterotrophic origin of life
implied that the initially established metabolism could
have resembled fermentation [3,4]. The rationale behind
this supposition (see [26,28,29,34] for further development of this view) was straightforward: fermentation is a
simple mode of metabolism that is inherent in the most
primitive anaerobic organisms. We now know that catalytic chemistry beyond the breakage or formation of covalent bonds is indeed the least structurally demanding; in
most cases only acid-base catalysis is involved, often
enhanced by metal atoms [368-371]. Not surprisingly,
reactions of this type can be catalyzed even by ribozymes,
unlike many other chemical transformations that can be
performed only by proteins. The Zn world scenario builds
on this rationale and suggests that primordial metabolism, as catalyzed by the first ribozymes and enzymes,
constituted a set of chemically simple transformations
where reactions of bond breakage were coupled with reactions of bond formation, perhaps being mediated by
group transfer events. Oparin, however, did not treat primordial energetics explicitly [3,4]. The formation of the
first polymers was suggested to proceed spontaneously,
without coupling to energy flow. Without such coupling,
however, an unsupported formation of long polymers

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

would contradict the laws of thermodynamics, as routinely noted by critics of Oparin's idea (see e.g. [83]). In
contrast, the Zn world scenario invokes solar UV light as
an energy source both for prebiological syntheses and for
(photo)selection.
Haldane, in addition to a fermentation-like metabolism,
which he postulated independently of Oparin, suggested
that "the first living ... things were probably large molecules
synthesized under the influence of Sun radiation" (quoted
from [5]). Hence, on this point Oparin's and Haldane's
hypotheses differ. In addition, Haldane argued that the
complexity of the first organisms should be compatible to
that of bacteriophages, thus anticipating some aforementioned modern views related to the RNA world concept
[61,62,219]. On all these points, there is an agreement
between the Zn world concept and Haldane's hypothesis.
Nonetheless, Haldane suggested that life emerged in the
homogenous phase (it was he who mentioned the "hot,
dilute soup"). In contrast, the Zn world concept considers
primeval life as a surface-confined phenomenon.
The Zn world concept is in accord with the RNA world
(RNA life) hypothesis [37-73]; the RNA-based life forms
may have inhabited the photosynthesizing, porous ZnS
edifices that could help to (photo)select first RNA organisms, provide a shelter and nourish them. RNA organisms
most likely inhabited the Zn world only in the beginning,
being followed by RNA/protein life forms. Concerning
RNA research, the involvement of ZnS surfaces suggested
here implies that, upon modelling or simulating primeval
events, electrically charged ZnS surfaces may be explicitly
invoked as supporting (photo)catalytic templates (see
also [414]). With their assistance, replication could have
been carried out by relatively simple aggregates of RNAlike polymers. In addition, the first systems of protein synthesis, owing to supporting ZnS templates, may have been
fundamentally simpler than their modern counterparts
(see also [73]). The gradual decoupling from the ZnS surfaces and the emergence of enclosed organisms would
have required more complex devices, such as primeval
ribosomes, which, however, had time to evolve gradually
from more simple predecessors – by recruiting new parts
to functionally replace the ZnS baseplates.
The Zn world scenario incorporates elements from some
"metabolism first" concepts, in particular from the "Pyrite
world/Pioneer organism" concept of Wächtershäuser,
who put forward a detailed concept of a two-dimensional
primordial life on iron disulfide (FeS2, pyrite) surfaces at
the sea floor [124-130]. The Zn world scenario exploits
the suggestion of Wächtershäuser that the mineral surfaces may have promoted the abiogenic syntheses of the
first polymeric molecules. In addition, the Zn world
model builds upon the idea of Russell and co-workers on

Page 19 of 39
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

porous chimneys of the deep-sea hydrothermal vents as
incubators for the first life forms [115-123]. In contrast
with these two concepts, the Zn world scenario considers
zinc sulphide – instead of iron sulfides, which can generate potentially harmful hydroxyl radicals [223,224] – as
the "mineral of life", and locates the first life settings at the
illuminated surface of Earth. Moreover, the suggested
metabolism in the Zn world, which combines abiogenic
photosynthesis with the primitive heterotrophy of the
first replicators, is fundamentally different from the
(bio)chemical mechanisms that were postulated for the
two "iron-sulfide" worlds and based upon iron-catalyzed
redox reactions (see the accompanying article [226] for
more details on this point).
Kuhn and Waser have noted that the pores of primordial
rocks could have served as compartments upon the evolution of the first RNA molecules [45]. A related attempt to
merge the FeS compartments with the RNA life has
recently been performed by Martin and co-workers
[117,219], who have suggested that "within a hydrothermally formed system of contiguous iron-sulfide (FeS) compartments, populations of virus-like RNA molecules, which
eventually encoded one or a few proteins each, became the
agents of both variation and selection" (quoted from [219]).
Experimental evidence of polynucleotide accumulation in
simulated pore systems has been provided by Braun and
co-workers [415]. The idea of porous natural settings as
incubators for the first RNA-like life forms is used in the
Zn world scenario. It, however, suggests that the function
of "honeycombed" ZnS settings was not limited to compartmentalization but also included photosynthesis of
metabolites, (photo)selection of most fit polymers, and
(photo)catalysis of diverse reactions. In addition, the Zn
concept implies that colonization of these settings by first
life forms proceeded from the illuminated, photosynthesizing top to the bottom, in contrast to the scheme of Martin and co-workers in which life propagated from the
bottom, "secure" part of the deep-sea hydrothermal FeS
vent to the surface.
A few authors [19,416,417] have stressed the potential
importance of high radioactivity on primordial Earth for
the origin of life, albeit without suggesting how the energy
of ionizing radiation could be used for biochemically relevant syntheses. The Zn world scenario incorporates such
a mechanism: ZnS crystals can trap and transiently store,
in a form of charge-separated states, diverse kinds of radiation energy, namely X-rays, electrons (as in displays), Dparticles (ZnS was introduced as the first inorganic scintillator by Sir William Crookes in 1903), and so on. The
excited electron(s) could then drive the CO2 reduction at
the surface of ZnS crystals. Hence, ZnS crystals show a
unique ability to convert diverse kinds of energy into the
chemical energy of organic compounds. Taking into

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

account the high radioactivity level on primordial Earth,
the ZnS edifices would have worked as natural converters
of radioactive energy into reduced carbon and nitrogencontaining metabolites. The high-energy radiation could
have penetrated deeper into the ZnS edifices than the
solar UV light and, in addition, could have supported the
ZnS photoreactors during the night hours.
Nonetheless, it is necessary to emphasize that the major
source of energy for primordial life was solar light, since
its energy, according to available estimates, was many
orders of magnitude larger than that of ionizing radiation
(see e.g. [19,20,34,109]). In addition, the unique photostability of polynucleotides indicates that they were shaped
by evolution under the selective pressure of solar light.

Conclusion
Nurs'd by warm sun-beams in primeval caves
Organic Life began beneath the waves.
Erasmus Darwin, The Temple of Nature, 1802 [1]

The suggested Zn world scenario (i) identifies the geological conditions under which "primeval caves" made of
photosynthesizing nanoparticles could emerge and persist on primordial Earth, (ii) comprises a mechanism by
which these particles could use "warm sun-beams" for the
production of diverse organic compounds, (iii) attributes
the selection of primordial RNA-like polymers to their
particular photostability, and (iv) indicates the driving
forces and selective factors that might have promoted the
transition from the first simple polymers to more complex
living organisms.
The Zn world scenario shows how the "metabolism first"
and "replication first" concepts can be reconciled and
combined. The scenario comprises a mechanism of the
continuous abiogenic photosynthesis of metabolites and
their further conversion by ZnS-confined replicating entities.
The suggested concept invokes (photo)selection as a driving force – in the straightforward physical sense – in the
emergence of increasingly complex biopolymers.
In addition, the Zn world scenario is detailed enough to
enable falsification tests, as exemplified in the accompanying article [226].
Last but not least, the idea that life may have emerged
within photosynthesizing, luminescent crystals – which
gathered the light of the harsh Hadean Sun during the day
and glittered through the nights – is aesthetically appealing.

Reviewer 1
Arcady R. Mushegian, Stowers Institute for Medical
Research, Kansas City, MO, and Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics, and Immunology, University of
Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA

This is the first of two extremely interesting, thought-provoking manuscripts that discuss the hypothesis of the "Zn
world" in which Life on Earth may have emerged. Both
papers are elaborately argued and well (or, at times, beautifully) written.
The first paper leans heavily on (bio)physical and geological data, which is the area outside of my expertise. I have
nominated Simon Silver to review it and have only brief
remarks of my own. I have reviewed the second paper in
much more detail.
p. 8 ln 14–17 "The evolutionary development from simplest prokaryotes to mammals is accompanied by a comparable increase in complexity, see e.g. [30,399]. This
increase is routinely explained by Darwin's natural selection mechanism: more complex organisms emerge owing
to their selective advantage over simpler predecessors
[51,67,92,404]."
-- this whole discussion is not central to the theme, but,
since the authors mentions it, there are certainly recent
fundamental contributions to the topic that provide nonselective explanation for several crucial transitions in the
process, most notably Michael Lynch's alternatives.
Author's response: The sentence has been deleted upon the
streamlining of the manuscript. Still I fully agree with this comment of the Reviewer.
Reviewer 1
p. 20 "It is noteworthy that if a protecting polypeptide
could eventually discard excess energy by channeling it
into a chemical reaction, then the probability of its own
heat denaturation became lower; accordingly, the survival
chances of the host replicator (that produced this peptide
by using its own strand as a template) should increase."

is it not much later in evolution?
Author's response: The phrase in parentheses has been deleted.

Reviewer 1
Manuscript as a whole: There is no discussion of the effect
of various concentrations of the Zn ion on the stability of
the phosphoester bond. (Fe2+ ions are mentioned on pg
17 of the second paper, but not Zn2+ ions). Even if the
effect is negligible, this should be reviewed.

Author's response: This is a very important point. Since Zn2+
ions can catalyze the formation of proper 3'-5' linkages
[198,349], they should also catalyze the cleavage of these linkages. Indeed, Zn2+ ions have been shown to catalyze the cleavage of phosphoester bonds, particularly at high temperatures
[367,418,419]. It is necessary to emphasize that the Zn world
concept does not imply that primeval oligomerization was
driven by Zn2+ ions as one-way catalysts – these cannot exist.
Instead, the Zn world concept suggests, following the ideas of
Wächtershäuser [124], that the accumulation of primeval
RNA-like oligonucleotides could proceed because it was thermodynamically favourable. This could be due to a combination of
several factors, namely electrostatic matching, high atmospheric pressure, the potential to utilize the energy of light, photoselection, and so on. Therefore, Zn2+ ions could accelerate the
reactions but not affect their direction. However, the "life span"
of primordial RNA-like polymers could have been increased if,
after formation, they gained protection from the Zn2+ catalyzed
cleavage. In the revised manuscript, I discuss how the first
polypeptides, by blocking the 2'-OH groups of ribose entities,
may have prevented the binding of Zn2+ ions to these groups
and, hence, the chain cleavage.
The mechanism of polynucleotide cleavage by iron is quite different. Here, the predominant damage comes from harmful
hydroxyl radicals that could be produced in the presence of
redox-active Fe2+/Fe3+ ions [222,223,225]. Because Fe2+ ions
are photoactive [24,109], the danger from hydroxyl radicals
should be especially high in illuminated settings. Bearing in
mind the expected high solubility of Fe2+ ions in the primeval
waters of 10-5–10-6 M [90,221,420], we believe that Fe-rich,
illuminated settings would have been hostile for pre-cellular life
forms that, unlike modern organisms, had no protection from
hydroxyl radicals (see also the accompanying article [226]).

Reviewer's report 2
Simon Silver, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA (nominated
by Arcady Mushegian)
The two manuscripts by A.Y. Mulkidjanian and M. Galperin are a useful contribution to this long human effort
(and a basic essential human need) to understand who we
are and how we got here. The effort goes back at least to
the ancient Greeks and with more modern developments
starting with Louis Pasteur's demonstration of the absence
of "spontaneous generation" of life in our time and then
75 years later A. I. Oparin taking some colloid physical

chemistry and making for the first time a plausible scientific model of the Origin of Life. Then the Miller and Urey
experiments (here in Chicago) with electrical sparks as
energy showed one can synthesize small organic amino
acids and other basic building blocks of biopolymers by
abiogenic mechanisms, given the required energy.
There were three stages of the origin of life that should be
defined better than Mulkidjanian does:
(a) Pre-biotic or abiotic, "pre-cellular" synthesis of building subunits of future biopolymers. This is not really the
Origin of Life but something abiotic, a bit earlier and
eventually leading to life, which starts with The First Cell.
That is what is discussed in these papers. There are basically two current models for prebiotic small molecule
organic chemistry and physical chemistry (which all agree
is all that is needed) to progress to life. These can be
divided roughly in to metabolism-first or self replicationstarts-Darwinian evolution.
(b) The First Cell comes next and was (in our replicationoriented thinking) a ribozyme surrounded by a liposome
(neither of which alone is alive). A source of external
energy – undoubtedly metal cation redox derived – was
the third requirement for the first cell [33]. Once the early
Earth had these replicating primitive cells, Darwinian evolution and selection would lead inevitably to metabolism
and the diversity of living cells we recognize today. The
current authors disagree, but it is unclear whether the disagreement is fundamental or merely a matter of emphasis.
This has been a field of multiple ideas but no consensus
for most of the last 50 years. As one example lack of consensus, our 2005 paper seems to have had no influence on
others thinking along alternative pathways. The First Cell
lacked ribosomes, and therefore lacked proteins (e.g. The
First Cell had no enzyme catalysts and no metabolism, as
we understand now that these). It lacked ATP and other
familiar high-energy phosphate-bond small intermediates. The early ZnS structures hypothesized by Mulkidjanian would be outside the First Cell, and might indeed
contribute importantly to prebiotic accumulation of macromolecular precursors. However, once the primitive First
Cell arose and evolution started, the cell membrane
would block ZnS from the early cytoplasm.
(c) To go from The First Cell to The Last Universal Ancestor of Bacteria, Archaea, and then the first Eukaryotic cells
(which formed by fusion of a couple or more prokaryotes)
required evolution and invention of all of the familiar
macromolecular nucleic acid and protein synthesis
machinery and metabolism that is common to all current
living cells, over the relatively brief period of a couple
hundred million years, a short time back then over 3 billion years ago. The Genetic Code needed to evolve. There-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

fore Mulkidjanian is wrong on a small point that his ZnS
photosynthetic mechanisms would do anything at all
toward explaining how the three domains of life split,
after basically all cell biology was invented by evolution.
One should be clear and explicitly state that the "photosynthesis" referred to here is unrelated to biological photosynthesis, which came much later; early life was
dependent, however, on metal ion redox chemistry; and
was either utilized light (i.e. was photosynthetic) or not.
Author's response: The three stages in the origin of life, as envisioned by the Reviewer, might serve as an instrumental model
in some cases; the respective article [33]is cited in the revised
manuscript. Generally, however, the evolution of life seems to
be a more complex phenomenon. For example, viruses do not fit
into this scheme at all. The very existence of viruses, which on
the one hand are mostly built of nucleic acids and proteins but
not lipids, and on the other hand seem to precede cellular life
forms in evolution [62], challenges the idea of the First Cell
that lacked proteins. This is one of the reasons why I base the
Zn world hypothesis upon the "standard" sequence of events,
namely RNA o proteins o membranes.
It seems plausible that the zinc-rich settings could directly affect
the first life forms even after the emergence of membranes. The
transition from membrane-lacking to membrane-encased life
forms is connected with the following "chicken and egg" paradox: while a lipid membrane would be useless without membrane transporting systems, the respective membrane proteins
would need membranes to evolve. We have tackled this paradox
by combining structural and phylogenetic analyses and have
suggested that the evolution of membrane transporters started
from simple amphiphilic proteins capable of being incorporated
into the membrane and of forming oligomeric pores and that
chemiosmosis, particularly the proton-based type, was an evolutionary latecomer [175,176,421]. The porous membranes
would still be leaky to Zn2+ ions. We discuss this topic in a section devoted to the metallome of the Last Universal Common
Ancestor of the accompanying article [226].
The mechanism to funnel the free energy of the Sun into the
biosphere is envisioned as the abiogenic photosynthesis of
diverse organic compounds that could then be processed by photoselected replicating entities. Accordingly, I suggest, following
the views of Oparin [3] and Haldane [5] on this point, that the
simple (bio)chemical processing of photosynthesized compounds (a kind of fermentation) could have preceded chemiosmosis. The relation between the abiogenic and biogenic
photosyntheses is discussed in the accompanying article, in a
section devoted to decline and fall of the Zinc world. [226]. We
emphasize their fundamental similarity and argue that (bacterio)chlorophyll-based photosynthesis took over the function
from ZnS-mediated photosynthesis.

Reviewer 2
It is nice to acknowledge here L.E. Orgel (1927–2007),
who worked and thought productively and long on these
questions. Orgel helped establish reluctantly and unintentionally that there never has been agreement of among the
(accurately said by Mulkidjanian to be) "many scenarios"
for the Origin of Life. It is implausible and unlikely to
think that this new additional model of "A Zinc World"
will add to or replace the currently popular RNA World
[17] or that it will simplify and make the current alternatives fewer. Mulkidjanian is also wrong if he thinks one
can experimentally "falsify" (as Karl Popper hopefully,
but erroneously influenced a generation of mostly-British
and German scientists) what happened nearly 4 billion
years ago by current efforts mostly of analysis and argumentation, and not direct experimentation. The situation
concerning understanding of the Origin of Life seems
more like Thomas Kuhn taught us about other realms of
science: ideas disappear only when the people who like
them die and are replaced by younger people with differing ideas. A contemporary of L.E. Orgel, H. Morowitz
together with younger colleagues [36] has a new popular
report that lays out the issues nicely and also demonstrates that the current two efforts by Mulkidjanian and
Galperin will not succeed in simplifying the alterative
ideas. Trefil, Morowitz, and Smith [36] agree with Mulkidjanian and Galperin that metabolism came first, before
hereditary polymer replication (this is where we primarily
disagree) and they quote Albert Szent-Gyorgi (1893–
1986) that Life is nothing but an electron looking for a
place to rest. Redox chemistry and electron transport
along pathways that conserve energy are essential to the
Origin of Life as to contemporary life: on that we all agree.
But the rest seems far indeed for consensus thinking.

There are major scientific groups and gatherings about
these topics, so there really are "establishment views"
(http://www.google.com is excellent and see the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life and http:/
/www.panspermia.org). But there is no consensus. There
is instead wide range of interest and a wide range of ideas
to which The Zn World is one more useful model.
Author's response: The suggested concept of a Zn world complements the RNA world model by suggesting a physically and
geologically plausible habitat for RNA-based life forms. Furthermore, the recent data of Sutherland and co-workers on the
elevated photostability of natural nucleotides [17]support, in
fact, the Zn world concept. It seems necessary to emphasize here
that the "replication first" models, such as the RNA world,
leave biologists happy but cannot completely satisfy those with a
background in physics or physical chemistry who realize that
RNA life would be thermodynamically implausible unless coupled to some utilizable energy source. In contrast, the "metabolism first" schemes are favoured by some physicists, chemists,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

and geologists, but these cannot convince the majority of biologists who simply cannot accept life without replication. By combining these currently duelling models, the Zn world concept
may, hopefully, satisfy physicists, chemists, and geologists as
well as biologists.
I am not the first to apply a Popperian approach to the origin of
life problem (see e.g. [58,227]). This approach is based not
only on falsification tests but also on experimentation. Therefore in the current article, I cite a wealth of experimental data
in support of the suggestion that ZnS-mediated primordial photosynthesis could have powered the emergence of life. In the
accompanying article [226], a separate section is devoted to the
analysis of potentially feasible experimental tests of the Zn
world concept.
I appreciate the reference to the review of Morowitz and coworkers [36]; this review is cited in the revised manuscript.

Antoine Danchin, Unit of Genetics of Bacterial Genomes,
Department of the Genomes and Genetics, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France (Nominated by Eugene Koonin)
Photosynthetic origin of life in the Zn world, part 1, which
I had to review is a compendium of two widely different
topics.
A. This is a review article on multiple theories of the origin
of life
B. This is a particular theory of a mineral origin of life,
where Zinc containing minerals played a central role.
While I have only limited objections to part B (which I
will detail below), I think that part A should be substantially modified to make a consistent piece of reflection on
the origin of life.
Preliminary. The subject « origin of life » is not a standard
scientific topic, as much of what can be proposed cannot
be directly amenable to experimental approaches. In particular, even if we can produce plausible scenarios that
would be short in time, the time lapses necessary to test
them would be much longer than a human lifetime. This
does not mean impossibility, but this implies that a fairly
large section of what one can propose is of the domain of
opinion rather than truth (to follow the Greek tradition).
As we can only oppose an opinion to an opinion, my
arguments will mainly be aiming at making the proposed
work of higher quality, even when it will not fit my own
opinion.
It is of interest to start from Erasmus Darwin, but to state
that the problem of origin of life started with him is so

inaccurate that it is really surprising that such a sentence
could have been written. The author needs to say that he
chose to start the question with Erasmus Darwin (presumably to make an amusing side-comment to the Darwin year).
Author's response: In the revised manuscript, this sentence has
been rewritten.
Reviewer 3
Immediately after this beginning, the author makes a very
common erroneous confusion between reproduction and
replication. While he quotes later on in the paper Freeman
Dyson, he should have read (and followed) his demonstration that these are not at all the same, and that reproduction must have predated replication. This is, in fact, a
major point for any scenario of the origin of life. I suspect,
in fact, that quite a few of the references quoted in this «
review » part of the paper have not been read carefully by
the author. Perhaps should he restrict his references to
papers he read in-depth. This would certainly make his
review of models of scenarios of the origin of life less
fuzzy and more accurate and incisive. In fact, rather than
presenting a historical account of some scenarios (which
may be interesting for philosophy of sciences, but not for
a scientific article), the author should make a rational construct of all those theories. Once again, I think that the
way things have been presented by Freeman Dyson is a
model of what could (should) be done. This is a model of
clarity.

Instead the author states: « We have argued that the "replication first" and "metabolism first" concepts complement rather than contradict each other and have
suggested that the life on Earth started from a "metabolism-driven replication" ». I am afraid that this lacks
proper rationality, and I would suggest him again to go
back to Dyson, and re-think his scenario.
Author's response: In the revised version of the article, this
review section has been deleted. The section in which the Zn
world concept was compared/related to other concepts on the
origin of life has been somewhat expanded and moved to the
end of the article. The relation between reproduction, metabolism, and replication is now considered in more depth.
Reviewer 3
Of course I would have liked to have also suggested the
author to read my books " L'œuf et la poule, histoires du
code génétique, Fayard 1983 – The Chicken and the Egg,
stories of the genetic code " (translated into Japanese and
Portuguese, not English) and « Une Aurore de Pierres. Aux
origines de la vie, Le Seuil, 1990 – A dawn on stones. At
the origins of life. » but it is in French (and translated into
Portuguese, but not, unfortunately in English). Too bad,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

but this is life. So, I will have to summarise my arguments
here.
Author's response: The book Une Aurore de Pierres. Aux origines de la vie [23]proved to be very useful indeed and is now
cited in the text.
Reviewer 3
The problem of the scenarios, as remarked by some
authors (in particular Graham Cairns-Smith, in his
Genetic Takeover) is that they have to decide about initial
conditions. The soup cannot be a good one, as it is a poisonous soup (there is a need for selecting relevant compounds), and furthermore, as it lack essential
components: coenzymes first (as they are the basis of metabolic pathways), then nucleotides (nucleobases are
meaningless), basic amino acids, and long chain fatty
acids, to chose a few of the essential ingredients. It must
also avoid containing molecules that are too close to the
ones retained later on. No scenario which does not take
these constraints at their onset are or significant interest.
Typically, the very fact that the author is not aware of these
constraints (which, by the way, place metabolism first, for
a reason complementary to that given in Dyson's demonstration) is shown in the fact that, for example, he writes
about « adenine monophosphate » (p.10, l.5). It is absolutely not trivial to make a nucleotide, in particular
because ribose is an extremely unstable molecule. And
this implies a steady state process to make it...

Author's response: "Adenine monophosphate" has been
replaced by "adenosine monophosphate".
Concerning the stability of nucleotides: Sutherland and coworkers have recently demonstrated the potential to make pyrimidine nucleotides from cyanamide, cyanoacetylene, glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, and inorganic phosphate by
circumventing the stages of single nucleobases and ribose [17].
Their synthesis yielded activated ribonucleotide E-ribocytidine2',3'-cyclic phosphate as a major product and several co-products. Prolonged irradiation of this mixture by 254 nm light
caused the destruction of various co-products and the partial
conversion of ribonucleotide E-ribocytidine-2',3'-cyclic phosphate into ribonucleotide E-ribouridine-2',3'-cyclic phosphate.
The authors concluded that there must be some (photo)protective mechanism functioning with the two natural nucleotides
but not with other pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides. They
write that "the mechanism provides a means whereby ...the two
activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides needed for RNA synthesis,
can be enriched relative to other end products of the assembly
process" [17]. They have even claimed that "the prebiotic synthesis of activated pyrimidine nucleotides should be viewed as
predisposed" [17]. This result is a clear-cut evidence that photoselection was a potential driving force behind the emergence
of the first biological (macro)molecules.

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

Concerning the steady-state processes: I do not question their
primacy. On the contrary, I argue that ZnS-mediated photosynthesis was the primary, steady-state process that supported the
emergence of life. Unlike the postulated reactions at pyrite surfaces [124], which remain elusive, ZnS-mediated photosynthesis has been repeatedly shown to proceed with high yield at
moderate temperatures [144,149,272].
However, I do not share the view of Dyson and others who consider the systems of interacting steady-state flows as alive. As we
have argued elsewhere [85], it would seem more reasonable to
date the origin of life to the establishment of the first replicating
systems.
Reviewer 3
Now, a second part of any scenario, needs to state where
we start, and from what data. If genetic takeover happened, then we are witnessing palimpsests (as suggested
by Steve Benner) and there is not much hope, except for
purely educated guesses. In contrast, if we still can have
archives, then we could start from extant metabolism.
This was the idea of Sam Granick and later on of Gunter
Wächtershäuser (who ignored Granick, which made difficult uncovering his remarkable work: it took me several
years to stumble upon that work). Here, the idea is to
remark (which the author apparently ignores) that anabolism is very special in that it is essentially made of molecules carrying negative charges, often phosphate. Sulfur is
also an essential component (as it remains for the
author), associated to iron and to the idea of electron
transfers (a neat idea with the prevailing conditions on
Earth, when oxygen was not there, so that reversible electron transfers could be quite efficient).

Author's response: Indeed, many metabolites carry negative
charges, and we have extensively discussed this point in our previous article [85]. In the revised manuscript, it is now explicitly
mentioned that photosynthetic reduction of CO2 yields negatively charged molecules that could remain confined to the ZnS
surfaces.
Reviewer 3
Now, curiously (in fact I do not exactly understand why,
as this would fit quite well with a model where zinc would
play the role I think iron played) the author tries to discard the idea of surface metabolism. This is however, to
my view, one of the most indisputable scenarios explaining how life could have led to a constructive metabolism.
Granick, Wächtershäuser and I should include myself,
argue very strongly for that step as the basis of selection
(much needed to avoid the poisonous broth) and or
polymerisation. True that Miller and De Duve (for reasons which are obscure to me, except that surfaces led to
much less interest in sparks and the like) tried to discard
the idea of surfaces by stating that chemical reactions on a

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

surface would simply preclude separation from the surface of the polymers: this is a completely far-fetched argument, ignoring (purposedly?) that the polymerisation is
not driven, in most cases by enthalpy, but by entropy
(because of elimination of a water molecule, which goes
in the solution: exactly the opposite of what would happen in the solution, where polymers would tend to be
unstable unless the medium is highly compartmentalised,
with a role on water activity). Their argument cannot be
retained. Worse, I think that De Duve should have, on the
contrary, built up his theory (which is excellent) of the
role of thioesters, on surfaces: 4-phosphopantetheine
would be the swinging arm to make many complex compounds including the much wanted long fatty acids !!!
This is what I tried to demonstrate in my books (and in
the short summary I published in English, with a conjecture on the synthesis of nucleotides [74]).
Author's response: The idea of surface chemistry is not discarded. In contrast, I build upon the works of Wächtershäuser
in this respect and argue that the syntheses of polymers could
proceed at ZnS surfaces where the first RNA-like polymers were
protected from photodamage. In the Zn world, therefore, the
selection was not a one-step process but a two-step process: first,
electrostatically preferred molecules adsorbed at the ZnS surfaces and could participate in diverse photochemical reactions,
and next, those product molecules that were particularly photostable (e.g. oligonucleotides) were photoselected. As noted
above, a photoselection of natural nucleotides has just been
experimentally demonstrated by Sutherland and co-workers
[17]. Thus, I consider the surface confinement of first polymers
as a pre-condition of their survival in a UV-irradiated environment.
I do not think that it is possible to rebuff the argumentation of
De Duve and Miller [200], because their reasoning was based
on a straightforward application of energy conservation law.
The mechanism of the membrane ATP synthase – as is considered in the article – exemplifies that, if the free energy ('G) of
a particular synthetic reaction differs in two environments, then
a portion of free energy – equal to the difference between the
two respective 'G values – should be "invested" to transfer the
reaction product between the two environments. But, and this
is the point that I have tried to emphasize, the displacements
within the particular environment can proceed "for free". In
other words, the polymers would not remain bound at the sites
of their polymerization (as De Duve and Miller have envisioned), but rather could diffuse along the surface and interact
with other polymers.
Reviewer 3
So much for these points: if I go on, I will write a new
book! Just one final point: the author writes " The living
organisms are evolving, dissipative systems that can exist
only being supported by energy flow ", this is either trite

Page 25 of 39
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

or wrong (or both) and this rests on a completely wrong
view of the way entropy fluxes are involved in Nature. The
author (and I can send him the paper) should read the
remarkable paper of Rolf Landauer " Inadequacy of
entropy and entropy derivatives in characterizing the
steady state " published in Physical Review A, in august
1975. He would certainly think twice, delete this sentence
(which does not bring anything more than fuzzy words to
his demonstration) and omit any reference to Prigogine
anyway. This would not harm his work, quite the contrary.
Author's response: It would seem that there is some misunderstanding on this point. If I understand properly, the Reviewer
means that Prigogine was wrong while suggesting that dissipative structures tend to reach states with minimal entropy production. Landauer showed in his paper that this rule is not
general and is valid only in some cases that are close to equilibrium [422]. The living systems are far from equilibrium, and
therefore this rule is most likely not applicable to them in any
case. I have been long aware of this controversy between Prigogine and his opponents, and therefore these ideas of Prigogine
were not even mentioned in the original manuscript. I refer to
Prigogine in another relation. Prigogine has repeatedly argued,
in his many articles and books, that the emergence of ordered
complexity in nature requires continuous supporting energy
flow and out-of-equilibrium settings. Since some hypotheses on
the origin of life simply ignore this point, I find it worthy to
emphasize that life could not emerge either "for free" or in an
equiponderated primordial soup – and cite Prigogine in this
respect. Nevertheless, I have somewhat changed the respective
wording to avoid any misinterpretations.
Reviewer 3
Now, I come to his opinion about zinc as central to the
origin of life. This is based on an idea, worth investigating,
placing light at the centre of energy management. Why
not, this certainly happened with cyanobacteria and
before. Why not very early on. I have no major objection
to the generality of the idea. However I do not think that
the way the author involves nucleobases is convincing.
Light needs to be, indeed, coupled to energy, and electron
transfers are cases in point. This may place heme or related
molecules in the limelight, but also ... iron. Certainly not
nucleic acids. In contrast, I would certainly accept ZnS
(but I did not have access to the second paper, where falsification tests are proposed). Photosynthesis in a Zn
world, why not, and this apparently would happen as a
mineral surface metabolism (so that I did not really
understand why the author was so much against the idea).
But I would not easily accept nucleobases as primitive: as
I stated above I think nucleotides must be made more or
less directly, and I proposed a scenario which sees them as
a leak of a general process of nitrogen fixation. This might
well work in a Zn world.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

Author's response: While being quite happy that the Reviewer
has no major objection to the idea of abiogenic ZnS-mediated
photosynthesis, I would like to reiterate that I am not against
the idea of surface "metabolism" (see above).
I readily agree that it is difficult even to imagine a spontaneous
formation of nucleotides in the "primeval broth" from occasionally formed nucleobases, ribose molecules, and phosphate
groups. The Zn world concept, however, does not require the
formation of single nucleotides in solution. The concept implies
that polynucleotides could directly assemble at the ZnS surfaces
from simpler building blocks. In the aforementioned work of
Sutherland and co-workers, the viability of such syntheses has
been experimentally demonstrated [17]. In this way, the step of
mononucleotide synthesis could be bypassed. The survival of the
entire polymeric constructs could then be guaranteed by their
extreme photostability. In this framework, single nucleotides
could have first appeared as cleavage products of the polynucleotides.
Reviewer 3
Second, I would urge the author to think of replication as
secondary to metabolic reproduction, where peptides
were present first (this is what I tried to demonstrate in my
"The chicken and the egg" book (see above)). Also, the
author, once again, needs to think of the origin of coenzymes! This can certainly be included in his scenario.
Nucleic acids are latecomers, they came first as surface
substitutes, then discovered that rather than being substrates they could become templates. There I am interested by the idea that Zn favors formation of 3'-5' bonds
(which is indeed a very difficult feat, normally favoured
by the presence of peptides).

Author's response: In fact, I think (and write) about replication as a phenomenon that was secondary to the reproducing,
steady-state flows of energy and matter (although I think the
word "metabolism" might be misleading in relation to abiogenic processes).
The "metabolism first" models, however, have certain difficulties in explaining the transition to the first replicating entities.
For example, Dyson has suggested a multistep model with the
reproducing but not replicating cells emerging first and followed
by nucleotide-based replicators initially as parasites of these
cells and then as their symbionts [398]. However, neither the
(bio)chemical origin of the replicators nor the selection factors
that could favour their emergence were addressed. In contrast,
the Zn world model considers photoselection as a force that, by
driving the emergence of photostable entities built of stacked
and paired nucleotides, could have paved the way to the first
self-replicating systems.
Therefore, I cannot agree that nucleic acids were latecomers. In
the literature, many arguments are in favour of RNA-first sce-

Page 26 of 39
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

narios, the majority referring to the ability of RNA molecules,
but not proteins, to replicate; I do not want to repeat this argumentation here. One more argument, based on selection criteria, can still be invoked. One can presume that nucleobases, as
well as amino acids, could be selected for their particular tasks
because of specific properties that were useful under given circumstances and were shared by all nucleobases and amino
acids, respectively. The common property of nucleobases is their
extreme photostability. Hence it has been repeatedly hypothesized that they were selected because of this property (see
[17,85,159,165] and references therein). The respective selective factor, solar UV irradiation, is abiotic, so that the selection
could have started before the origin of life. The common property of amino acids is the presence of amino and acidic groups
that allow them to join into polypeptide chains. The selection for
this property, however, implies the existence of devices that
could connect amino acids by peptide bonds. In modern organisms, this function is routinely performed by RNA-based
machines (ribosomes); it is even now becoming clear how these
machines could evolve from simpler RNA constructs already
capable of peptide bond formation (see [73] and references
cited therein). This consideration, in my opinion, strongly supports the RNA-first schemes.
Reviewer 3
Finally, a word about the quotation by the author of the
work of Rolf Landauer. It happens that I was lucky enough
to meet him before he passed away, and to discuss much
of the questions involving entropy and information (he
showed to me how Prigogine was completely wrong, for
example, see his paper cited above). The important point
here is to see that if creation of information is not a real
problem, accumulation of information is. And this
requires an energy source. It is most likely, to my view,
that this was originally performed by a mineral such as
polyphosphate, which is quite metastable, and later on
perhaps by nucleotides and polynucleotides (such as what
is seen in the management of energy in the degradosome
today, see my Phylogenetic view of ribonucleases [423]).

Author's response: The energetics of the accumulation of information is a very important point. Since polynucleotides are not
eternal, replication per se can be considered as a means to preserve (accumulate) information before an information carrier
– a polynucleotide strand – eventually breaks down because of
thermal fluctuation or (photo)cleavage. In the manuscript, several tentative energy sources for replication are considered. Initially, the replication could be supported by the
thermodynamically coupled cleavage of available polynucleotides – "failed" information carriers, in the given context. The
cleavage of inorganic polyphosphates, as suggested by the
Reviewer, could provide energy as well; chemically, this reaction is similar to the cleavage of polynucleotides. This possibility
is now mentioned.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

Reviewer 3
Well. To complete this review, I think that the author
should reorganise it completely, shorten some of his
points and take into account really seriously the reflection
of Freeman Dyson, which he places only at the end of his
text.

Of course as much of what I wrote is opinion (doxa), I
have no strong reluctance for the publication of this work.
Author's response: The text has been streamlined, and the discussion of Dyson's views has been expanded. In the revised
manuscript, photoselection is explicitly considered as a possible
bridge between reproduction and replication.

Reviewer 4
Dieter Braun, Systems Biophysics, Functional Nanosystems, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, München,
Germany (Nominated by Sergey Maslov)
While I am sympathetic to the core idea presented, I cannot support the manuscript at this stage for publication.
This decision stems from a number of questions I would
have liked to have answered and, to a considerable degree,
to the vast length of the manuscript. The amount of novel
information by far does not warrant the length of the
manuscript, which, together with the second part, is rather
a book manuscript than a scientific paper. The strain put
on both the reader and the referee by the length is not
acceptable.
I would like to urge to shorten the manuscript to at least
half of its length by omitting review-like passages, rather
vague ideas and a large amount of repetitions in the text.
I will indicate sections which I consider not very helpful
as I will walk through the text. Being an experimental biophysicist, I am not used nor happy to adapt to novelistic
manuscript sizes for the publication of a mere hypothesis.
I only see the need for exceptions for detailed experimental results or detailed theoretical treatments. But even
without paper publishing, there is the need for shortness
due to time limitations of the readers (and the referee). I
could not check enough references well enough as I usually like to do due to their sheer number.
Author's response:
Being an experimental biophysicist myself, I usually use a more
laconic style while describing experimental results, see e.g.
[424]. The standard style, however, is not wholly applicable to
a hypothesis paper on the origin of life. Nonetheless, I have
attempted to address the concerns of the Reviewer wherever possible.

Page 27 of 39
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

Reviewer 4
First, for a hypothesis paper, the manuscript does a good
job in collecting literature for a specific scenario, namely
UV-triggered biosynthesis on Zn-surfaces. Also the focus
on possible physical boundary conditions is the way to go
in origin of life research in my viewpoint. The paper's discussion will lead to new experiments, which is a good
thing.

That said, I think the author is a bit 'pushy' on his proposal – calling it Zn-World as if Zinc would be a common
biological molecular construction. Also saying in the
introduction that the Zn world proposal "... resolves the
conflict between the "metabolism first" and the "replication first" concepts of abiogenesis, which are suggested to
reflect the two facets of the Zn world, namely the continuous abiogenic photosynthesis of metabolites and their
further conversion by the ZnS-confined replicating entities." may be correct on the first, but sketchy to say the
least on the second.
Author's response: The tag "Zn world" was chosen to emphasize that the (photo)chemical properties of Zn2+ ions and Zncontaining substances could have shaped the first life. While
the photochemistry of ZnS crystals could have governed the
nature of photosynthesized compounds and that of their photoderivates, the catalytic properties of Zn2+ ions may have determined the particular traits of the first (bio)polymers, e.g. the
choice of 3'-5' linkages for RNA strands.
Reviewer 4
Why the author chooses to make far-fetched connections
to very old literature (Erasmus, Darwin's pond, to give two
examples), I do not understand. Literature from times
where the molecular basis of biology or thermodynamics
was not understood can only be lucky to make a proper
proposal, but is not helpful to be repeated in current literature.

Author's response: I quote the older literature to express my
deep respect for scientists who could make suggestions that were
correct from the viewpoint of thermodynamics in "times where
the molecular basis of biology or thermodynamics was not
understood". Ironically, some hypotheses on the origin of life
that were put forward during the last decades appear shaky
from the thermodynamic viewpoint.
Reviewer 4
I am missing a discussion on whether clouds have
obscured early earth or whether land mass and shallow
waters have existed at all on the early earth. This would
substantiate two fundamentals of the concept.

Author's response: Clouds, if there were any at that time,
should have consisted of water. Water is transparent to UV

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

beams (of wavelength > 200 nm [425]). Therefore, one can
become tanned even on a cloudy day.
The presence of the first continents already at 4.2 Ga
[188]implies a shoreline around them and water patches at
their surface, in particular at sites of volcanic or geothermal
activity.
Reviewer 4
Another question I am missing in the manuscript is in
which geometry and location the author sees the UV radiation not being absorbed by porous rock or sedimentation layers. As it stands, the argument is basically restricted
to surface water some meters deep and rock structures
some micrometer thin.

Author's response: Taking into account the expected interplay
between the continuous precipitation of ZnS and photocorrosion, I would instead estimate the thickness of the habitable
layer as being several millimetres (similar to that of modern
microbial mats built up of phototrophic prokaryotes).
In addition, I would like to note that the ZnS-covered areas
could spread over hundreds of square kilometres – owing to the
high thermal activity of the young Earth.
Reviewer 4
Above relates to the puzzle I have how a Zn world should
accumulate and trap their molecules by a nonequilibrium
process and at the same time be fully exposed to UV radiation. I guess, exposure to UV inherently means that the
molecules synthesized diffuse then out into the open
waters?

Author's response: As noted in the revised manuscript, the photosynthesized molecules should be electrically charged and
could adsorb at the surface of ZnS (see also [85]). In addition,
the porous structure of ZnS precipitates should constrain the
diffusion of photosynthesized molecules out into the open waters
(see the structure of modern ZnS precipitates in [179-181]).
Moreover, as discussed in relation to the works of Wächtershäuser [124,126], the molecules that were polymerized at the
surface would remain confined to the surface.
Reviewer 4
The author takes "Mauserall has introduced a major additional constraint by noting that the energy requirements
of the first living beings had to be compatible with that of
modern organisms [109]. He argued that "the ur-cell
would be simpler, but it would also be less efficient" " to
the conclusion "More rigorously speaking, the intensity of
the energy flux(es) that supported the emergence of life
should be either comparable with the intensity of modern
life-supporting energy flows or even stronger.". I do not
see such a strict logic connection, since it assumes that the

Page 28 of 39

Biology Direct 2009, 4:26

biomass production should have been equal. It would be
helpful here if the authors would clarify his understanding of "intensity" (i.e. number of photons) as opposed to
for example "wavelength" (i.e. the energy gap).
Author's response: Here I would just like to quote David Mauzerall: "The ur-cell would be simpler, but it would also be less
efficient. A crude number for this energy flux is 10 mwatts per
gram of biocarbon. In anticipation of the stress on photochemistry, this flux can be normalized to energy flux per area, using
the area of a 'typical' prokaryote cell ~10 P2 and its weight of
carbon, 0.1 ng. This number is 0.01 mwatt per cm2. Table 1
shows the energy sources of the primitive earth. It is clear that
only solar photon energy is sufficient for the continuing evolution of life." The quotation is taken from [109], in which the
table referred to can be found.
Reviewer 4
At the core of the argument is the finding that DNA/RNA
can get rid of harder light quanta by the hydrogen bonding of the bases. However why then are the bases constructed such that they absorb UV radiation with good
efficiency at all? The absorption cross section is so large
that it is even used for DNA quantification. I would guess
that one could probably readily design molecules which
would combine both a lower UV absorption and – if they
do still absorb one – get rid of the energy with similar
mechanisms. Am I missing something here?

Author's response: Lower UV absorption of a chemical compound means that a passing UV quantum is captured not by the
first molecule on its way but, say, by the tenth molecule. But
then this tenth molecule still has to cope with the entire energy
of the UV quantum. As long as organic molecules are considered, deactivation of a UV quantum requires prompt spreading
of its energy over many bonds (therefore conjugated bonds are
needed) and an efficient sink for energy (here several diverse
mechanisms might be involved [164,165]). In the absence of
conjugated bonds, the energy of UV quanta will "gather" at the
"weakest" bond and eventually break it. As a result, the quantum yield of photodamage might be much higher for a compound with low absorption of UV than for a compound with
high UV absorption and many conjugated bonds. Goosen and
Kloosterboer [166]have shown that the release of phosphate in
response to 254 nm light was 10 times slower in the case of adenosine monophosphate (AMP, a highly UV-absorbing compound) than in the case of glycerol 2-phosphate (which barely
absorbs at 254 nm). It would seem that, in a kind of trade-off,
the increased absorption cross section was over-compensated by
increased photostabilty in the case of AMP. In this framework,
all means that increased the spreading of excitation energy
without increasing the absorption cross section would be
strongly favoured by evolution. The stacking of nucleotides, as
well as their pairing, would result in the spreading of excitation

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/26

energy over a larger number of chemical bonds without increasing the absorption cross section.
Reviewer 4
It would be useful if the author could also comment on
the "Lost City" type vents as his arguments on page 10
apparently only applies to so called "black smokers".

Author's response: Lost City-type vents were found at depths of
~700–800 m (see [102]for a review). Their hydrothermal fluids were cooler than those of black and white smokers (45°C–
75°C versus 250°C-350°C). Not surprisingly, these fluids
were depleted of any transition metals and were low in H2S. It
is not clear how metabolism of any type could emerge under
such conditions in the absence of transition metals as catalysts.
Reviewer 4
Beginning with about page 15 the manuscript tends to
become highly repetitive or very vague in its argumentation. I would like to point to "low density" parts of the
manuscript in the following. Shortening there would
make the manuscript much more accessible.

The repetitive sections of the manuscript start at page 15.
I will give a short list where I see strong repetitions:
- 15.22–16.2: Spreading excitations were mentioned
before
- 16.3–16.11: highly repetitive
- 22.17–23.15: I do not see why the paper needs to cite
Popper here.
- 23.18–24.28: I see this as repetitive review of thoughts
formulated before
- 25.23–27.15: Many repetitions, things of review character and not adding much to the hypothesis proposed
- 27.16–28.8.: Highly repetitive
- 29.21–29.27 was mentioned before
- 34.20–35.13 is quite repetitive
- 37.4–37.11 was mentioned before
- 39.3–40.15: I do not understand why we need a review
of Oparin and Haldane here.
- 42.13–46.14 is both repetitive and vague
- 46.23–47.18 was said before quite often

quantified. Therefore, I have used as my basis quantitative data
obtained with ZnS crystals and adsorbed organic dyes [329].

- 50.5–50.12 is repetitive

Reviewer 4
- 37.20–37.24: It is not clear to me what colonization
waves have to do with the "Zinc" world.

Author's response: Hopefully, the repetitions are less frequent
in the revised manuscript.
Reviewer 4
There are rather vague ideas:

- 17.7–17.17: The conclusion that dsRNA-selection leads
to replications systems is not well documented.
Author's response: Regretfully, I cannot document better the
properties of the first replicating entities that emerged more
than 3.5 Ga ago. However, the self-replicating RNA system, as
presented recently by Lincoln and Joyce [72], consists of
ribozymes that are built of paired RNA strands.
Reviewer 4
- 18.1–18.12: The should-heating of a hundred 'unit'
RNA-like polymer should be complemented by more
data, for example by the time scale and photon rate over
which the tens of degrees are applied. I would think there
is a difference between bleaching and thermal damage.
The subsequent conclusions in the manuscript are in my
view far fetched.

Author's response: The estimate from [210], which I have
used, was calculated for an ensemble of bacteriorhodopsin molecules, each being hit by one quantum of visible light. I would
strongly encourage a corresponding quantitative analysis for
RNA molecules and UV light quanta.
Reviewer 4
- 18.19–22.15: Much of what is written here is rather
hopeful speculation and uses imprecise language.

Author's response: Indeed, the story of how the first proteins
could have emerged is hopeful speculation. However, the field
is developing fast. In the revised manuscript, I invoke the justpublished seminal work of Bokov and Steinberg [73] and use
more precise language.

Author's response: From a biological viewpoint, the transition
from the Zn world to modern life has to be envisioned in an evolutionary scenario.
Reviewer 4
- 48.4–48.22: Both is the hypothesis presented here vague
and I also do not see a connection to the Zn-World.

Author's response: The Zn world concept has two major constituents, namely ZnS-catalyzed photosynthesis and the UV
selection of most photostable polymers [112]. Accordingly, the
emergence of the first information-carrying polymers as a result
of photoselection is a legitimate topic of the Zn world scenario.
Reviewer 4
Also, a strange reference is "in accordance with the "rings
joined to rings" scenario of Erasmus " on page 16.4 which
can hardly be taken seriously.

Author's response: In my opinion, the expression "rings joined
to rings", taken from the work of Erasmus Darwin [1], adequately describes the emergence of the first RNA-like polymers.
Their formation should have invoked both the stacking of ringlike nucleobases and their Watson-Crick pairing.
Reviewer 4
Much more detail would be in my opinion necessary to
relate the presented scheme of UV absorption to X-rays.
Much more reaction surface could be gained at the subsurface. However we only read "Taking into account the high
radiation level ... converters of radioactive energy into
reduced carbon and nitrogen containing metabolites."
Some more elaboration on this point would be very helpful.

Author's response: Radiation chemistry is not my field of expertise. A more detailed analysis of the "radio-synthesis" of organic
compounds within ZnS edifices might be a worthwhile task.

Reviewer 4
- 33.23–34.2: I cannot see the biological evidence which
supports the connection between dye sensitization on
ZnS surfaces with "zyms" helping in adding the yield of
metabolite production.

Reviewer 4
Last but not least I find the last sentence of the paper
rather revealing: what could the aesthetics of minerals to
do with a scientific argument on the origin of life?

Author's response: Although the photochemical interactions
between polynucleotides and ZnS/CdS quantum dots have been
actively studied, the light-gathering function of polynucleotides
in such systems, to the best of my knowledge, has not yet been

Author's response: Aesthetic criteria are of great importance in
scientific research, see e.g. [426]. For example, my initial opposition to the idea of abiogenesis at the floor of the Hadean ocean
[117], when I first heard about it, was purely aesthetic. I simply

Page 30 of 39

did not like the idea of the origin of life being in complete darkness. Only later on I realized the (bio)chemical shortages of this
scenario and, at the same time, learned to appreciate the seminal idea of Russell and co-workers on inorganic metal-sulfide
compartments as incubators for the first life forms. As a result,
initial aesthetic opposition could be transformed into a scientific
context.

Reviewer 4
I know that the open refereeing process makes it risky to
raise the voice (the scientific exchange has many possible
for punishment) – but without accepting criticism there is
no progress in science.

Author's response: I fully agree with this statement by the
Reviewer. A major advantage of the open review procedure is
that referees are free to express their own opinions on the subject. As a result, the open exchange of ideas between authors
and reviewers has its own value.
