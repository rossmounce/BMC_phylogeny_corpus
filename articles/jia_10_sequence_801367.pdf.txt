BRLF1 gene in nasopharyngeal and gastric
carcinomas

Abstract
Background: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has a biphasic infection cycle consisting of a latent and a lytic replicative
phase. The product of immediate-early gene BRLF1, Rta, is able to disrupt the latency phase in epithelial cells and
certain B-cell lines. The protein Rta is a frequent target of the EBV-induced cytotoxic T cell response. In spite of our
good understanding of this protein, little is known for the gene polymorphism of BRLF1.
Results: BRLF1 gene was successfully amplified in 34 EBV-associated gastric carcinomas (EBVaGCs), 57
nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) and 28 throat washings (TWs) samples from healthy donors followed by PCRdirect sequencing. Fourteen loci were found to be affected by amino acid changes, 17 loci by silent nucleotide
changes. According to the phylogenetic tree, 5 distinct subtypes of BRLF1 were identified, and 2 subtypes BR1-A
and BR1-C were detected in 42.9% (51/119), 42.0% (50/119) of samples, respectively. The distribution of these 2
subtypes among 3 types of specimens was significantly different. The subtype BR1-A preferentially existed in
healthy donors, while BR1-C was seen more in biopsies of NPC. A silent mutation A/G was detected in all the
isolates. Among 3 functional domains, the dimerization domain of Rta showed a stably conserved sequence, while
DNA binding and transactivation domains were detected to have multiple mutations. Three of 16 CTL epitopes,
NAA, QKE and ERP, were affected by amino acid changes. Epitope ERP was relatively conserved; epitopes NAA and
QKE harbored more mutations.
Conclusions: This first detailed investigation of sequence variations in BRLF1 gene has identified 5 distinct
subtypes. Two subtypes BR1-A and BR1-C are the dominant genotypes of BRLF1. The subtype BR1-C is more
frequent in NPCs, while BR1-A preferentially presents in healthy donors. BR1-C may be associated with the
tumorigenesis of NPC.

Background
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus that infects over 90% of the world population. As
the causal agent of infectious mononucleosis, EBV is also
tightly associated with various malignancies, including
Hodgkin’s disease, Burkitt’s lymphoma(BL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC), and B and T cell lymphomas in
immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS patients
and organ transplant recipients[1,2]. It is also responsible
for some gastric carcinomas (GC). The EBV infection is
found in 80-100% of gastric lymphoepithelioma-like

carcinoma cases and 2-16% of common types of gastric
adenocarcinoma [3-6]. In Northern China this rate is
about 7.0% according to our previous study [7].
After primary infection, EBV establishes a lifelong,
asymptomatic state in B cells. However, EBV can periodically reactivate and replicate in a lytic manner [8].
Understanding how viral latency is disrupted is a central
focus in herpesvirus biology. Induction of the switch
from latency to lytic cycle is associated with expression
of immediate-early (IE) protein Rta (R transactivator),
the product of the BRLF1 gene [9]. Rta is a 605-amino
acid (AA) protein with unknown cellular homologues.
The N-terminus of Rta contains an overlapping DNA
binding (AA 1 to 320) and dimerization (AA 1 to 232)
domain that does not correspond to any described DNA

binding motif previously [10]. The transcriptional activation domain is found in the C-terminal region of the
protein. An obligatory acidic activation domain (AA 520
to 605) contains highly conserved hydrophobic residues
that are predicted to form alpha helices [10]. A weaker
accessory activating domain contains two proline-rich
subregions (AA 352 to 410 and 450 to 500).
ZEBRA, the product of EBV BZLF1 gene, had been
thought to be the only viral protein capable of initiating
the lytic cycle [11-14]. In recent years Rta has been found
to be able to disrupt latency through activating Zp, the
promoter of BZLF1, leading expression of ZEBRA, and
thereby stimulation of early lytic genes, DNA replication,
and late gene expression [9,15,16]. There are a number of
interesting differences between the induction of lytic EBV
infection by BZLF1 and that by BRLF1. Zalani S, et al. [17]
reported that Rta can disrupt viral latency in an epithelial
cell-specific manner (in contrast to the ability of ZEBRA
to disrupt latency in B cells), and the mechanisms leading
to disruption of EBV latency appear to be cell-type specific. Also, it has been demonstrated that BRLF1, not
BZLF1, requires activation of the p38 and c-Jun stress
MAP kinase pathways for induction of lytic EBV infection
[18], and also requires PI3 kinase activation [19].
Several components of the immune system contribute
to the highly efficient control of virus replication and
proliferation of immortalized, EBV-infected cells in
healthy individuals, and probably the most important
components are HLA-restricted specific cytotoxic
T lymphocytes (CTLs). As EBV can switch directly from
the latent state into the lytic cycle without any expression of further latent proteins [20], CTL directed against
latent proteins might not be able to prevent the ongoing
viral replication. Therefore, CTL directed against
immediate-early (IE) proteins is a pivotal step to control
the virus lytic activation. Rta has been demonstrated to
have multiple epitopes recognized by EBV-specific CTL
[21,22]. Delineation of sequence variations of CTL epitopes may help the development of an effective control
of EBV replication and cell proliferation.
A notable feature of EBV-associated malignancies is
variation in incidence and the proportion of EBV-positive
tumors in different geographic regions [23,24]. The disparity is poorly understood. To explore the potential
association of the EBV-associated malignancies with integrated EBV sequence variations, as well as the possibility
of a CTL-based control of EBV replication and cell proliferation, we analyzed the sequence variation of EBV
BRLF1 gene in EBVaGCs, NPCs and healthy donors.

Results
Sequence variation of BRLF1 gene

The sequence of BRLF1 gene coding 605 AAs was successfully amplified in 34 EBVaGCs, 57 NPCs, and

28 TWs, respectively. All the sequences were compared
with the prototype B95-8 sequence. Nucleotide changes
were detected in 31 loci, 14 of which resulted in AA
changes. Among the 17 loci with silent nucleotide
changes, one (at 103654) was detected with an A/G
interchange in all the specimens tested. The translated
AA mutations from the sequence variations were summarized in Figure 1. According to the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 2), 5 distinct subtypes of BRLF1 were identified
among the observed 119 specimens, namely subtype
BR1-A, BR1-B, BR1-C, BR1-D, and BR1-E. Two subtypes, BR1-A and BR1-C, were found to be dominant in
the total specimens.
The subtype BR1-A, which was represented by
NPC87, was detected in 42.9% (51/119) of samples.
Forty specimens in this subtype had 2 common coding
changes: 377(Ala®Glu), 542(Ser® Asn), while 6 specimens only had residue 377, 5 specimens only had residue 542 changes. Interestingly, residue 489 caused
different AA changes among different specimens,
namely, Gln®Arg in 28 specimens, Gln®Lys in 21 specimens. Besides these 3 residues, 3 isolates (TW165,
TW121, and NPC6) showed Val®Ile interchange at residue 479. Silent changes in this pattern were detected in 3
residues: 486(CCG®CCA), 510(GAA®GAG), 572
(CCC®CCA) (data not shown). The prevalent AA mutations at residues 377, 489 and 542 of this subtype were
identical to the GD1 strain, which is a representative
EBV strain isolated from NPC patients in Guangdong,
China [25]. Also, the BRLF1 gene in C666-1 cell line,
which was established from an undifferentiated NPC
biopsy in Southern China [26], harbored only these three
mutations.
The second common subtype BR1-C (represented by
NPC57) was detected in 42.0% (50/119) of samples. This
subtype contained 3 common signature residues: residue
273 (Arg®Met), 316(Lys®Glu), 542(Ser®Asn). Additionally, some isolates showed one or more additional
sequence variations at other positions. Residues 284
(Gly®Ser), 288(Thr®Ser), 371(Pro®Gln) coexisted in
22 specimens, while 23 specimens contained residue 371
only; one specimen (GC95) contained residue 288 only.
At residue 489, 22 specimens had Gln/Arg interchange;
9 specimens had Gln/Lys interchange. An interchange
Tyr/His at residue 292 was detected in 22 specimens;
interchange Val/Ile at residue 479 in 19 specimens. This
subtype involved 16 silent mutations in different isolates
(data not shown).
The rest 3 subtypes were only detected in small numbers of specimens. The subtype BR1-B shared 2 common AA substitutions: residues 273(Arg®Met), 316
(Lys®Glu). Additional Gln/Arg interchange at residue
489 was detected in 6 specimens. The subtype BR1-D
was detected in 5 specimens, which had 5 common

Figure 1 Observed BRLF1 sequence variations in EBVaGC, NPC biopsies and TWs of healthy donors in Northern China. The numbers in
the first row correspond to the amino acid positions and the numbers in the second correspond to the nucleotide positions, under which the
B95-8 prototype amino acid and nucleotide sequences are listed. Different patterns are noted to the far left column, while the specimens
showing identical sequences to each other are listed by a representative isolate in the second column. The following numbers separated by “/”
denote the number of the identical sequences from EBVaGC, NPC and TW, respectively. Only sequences different from B95-8 are indicated. The
small letters denote the nucleotide, and the amino acids are denoted by capital letters. The GD1 sequence was taken from EBV genomes
AY961628 [25]. C666-1 and SNU-719 were two EBV-positive cell lines [26,27], whose sequences were obtained by using PCR-direct sequencing
method.

406(Leu®Phe), 414(Gly®Val). The last subtype BR1-E,
which is represented by the strain GC4, had the same
AA sequence with the prototype B95-8, except for a
silent mutation at 103654. This subtype was only found
in 3 EBVaGCs. The BRLF1 gene in EBV-positive GC
cell line SNU-719, which was established from a Korea
GC patient [27], also showed conserved sequence.

TWs. BR1-C was found in 50 specimens (42.0%), including 12/34 (35.3%) EBVaGCs, 30/57(52.7%) NPCs, and 8/
28 (28.6%) TWs. The present rate of BR1-A in TWs
(67.8%,19/28) was significantly higher than in EBVaGCs
(38.2%,13/34) or NPCs (33.3%,19/57); while, BR1-C was
seen more in NPCs (52.7%,30/57) than in EBVaGCs
(35.3%,12/34), or in TWs (28.6%,8/28) (P = 0.0019).
Variation analysis in BRLF1 functional domains

Distribution of BRLF1 subtypes in EBVaGCs, NPCs, and
TWs

The frequency of BRLF1 subtypes in EBVaGCs, NPCs,
and TWs of healthy donors was summarized in Table 1.
Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the difference
of the BRLF1 subtypes among the EBVaGCs, NPCs, and
the TWs. Two subtypes, BR1-A and BR1-C, were dominant in the tested specimens. BR1-A was detected in
42.9% (51/119) of total specimens, that were 13/34
(38.2%) EBVaGCs, 19/57 (33.3%) NPCs, 19/28 (67.8%)

As an important transactivator, BRLF1 gene harbors 3
vital functional domains: dimerization, DNA binding,
and transactivation domains [10]. The AA mutations in
BRLF1 functional domains were summarized in Table 2.
In this study, the domain of dimerization (AA 1 to 232)
was found to be stably conserved, where no AA mutations were detected (data not shown). Five residues
(273, 284, 288, 292 and 316) were detected to have AA

mutations in the DNA binding domain. The prevalent
mutations in this domain were found in residue 273
(R®M) and 316 (K®E). The mutation R®M at residue
273 affected 50% (17/34) of EBVaGCs, 66.7% (38/57) of
NPCs, 32.1% (9/28) of TW isolates; the mutation K®E
at residue 316 affected 52.9%(18/34) of EBVaGCs, 66.7%
(38/57) of NPCs, 32.1% (9/28) of TW isolates. The distribution of mutation R®M at residue 273 was significantly different among 3 types of specimens (c2 = 9.28,
P < 0.01; EBVaGC vs NPC: c2 = 2.47, P > 0.05;
EBVaGC vs TW: c2 = 2.01, P > 0.05; NPC vs TW: c2 =
9.05, P < 0.01); likewise, mutation K®E at residue 316
was distributed differently among 3 types of specimens
(c2 = 9.08, 0.01 <P < 0.05; EBVaGC vs NPC: c2 = 1.70,
P > 0.05; EBVaGC vs TW: c2 = 2.70, P > 0.05; NPC vs
TW: c2 = 9.05, P < 0.01). In contrast, the transactivation domain was detected to have more AA mutations.
Three residues, 377, 489, and 542, were the prevalent
mutation loci. Mutation S®N at residue 542 affected
most of the isolates (21 of 34 EBVaGCs, 50 of 57 NPCs,
and all the TWs). The rest mutations in this domain
affected the weaker accessory activating subregions (AA
352 to 410 and 450 to 500).
Variation analysis of CTL epitope sequences among EBV
isolates

Sixteen CTL epitopes in Rta were identified in previous
studies [22,28], 3 of which showed variations in the
detected isolates. Variations of CTL epitopes were summarized in Table 3. The QKE epitope was affected by
an S®N change at position 14 of the epitope, and
existed in the majority of the specimens (21 EBVaGCs,
50 NPCs, and 28 TWs). Mutation A®E at position
three of the NAA epitope was detected in 11 EBVaGCs,
20NPCs, 18TWs, while the epitope ERP was relatively
conserved; only 2 mutations P®S, L®F were detected
in 4 NPCs, 1 TWs. The most common mutation S®N
in QKE epitope was distributed differently in 3 sample
groups (c2 = 17.66, P < 0.01; EBVaGC vs NPC: c2 =
8.37, P < 0.01; EBVaGC vs TW: c2 = 13.55, P < 0.01;
NPC vs TW: c2 = 3.75, P > 0.05). Likewise, the

distribution of mutation A®E in NAA epitope was significantly different (c2 = 8.14, 0.01 <P < 0.05; EBVaGC
vs NPC: c2 = 0.07, P > 0.05; EBVaGC vs TW: c2 =
6.29, 0.01 <P < 0.05; NPC vs TW: c2 = 6.48, 0.01 <P <
0.05).

Discussion
In this study we analyzed the sequence variations of
BRLF1 gene in 34 EBVaGCs, 57 NPCs and 28 TWs in
healthy donors. To our knowledge, this is the first
report about the polymorphism of BRLF1 gene from
multiple tissues.
Based on the phylogenetic tree, we identified 5 distinct
subtypes of BRLF1 gene in the specimens of Northern
China. Two subtypes, BR1-A and BR1-C, were dominant
in the specimens observed. In this study, subtype BR1-C
was seen more in biopsies of NPC. It can be speculated
that a substrain of EBV with this subtype infects NPC
more frequently and this subtype may be more associated with the tumorigenesis of NPC in Northern
China. Feng et al. [29] demonstrated that BRLF1 is specifically expressed in NPC tumor cells. Further studies
of BRLF1 polymorphism in wider areas and functional
studies of subtype BR1-C will help our understanding
about the association between specific BRLF1 gene subtypes and EBV associated malignancies. Unlike subtype
BR1-C, the incidence of BR1-A was significantly higher
in healthy donors (67.8%) than that in EBVaGC (38.2%)
or NPC group (33.3%), suggesting that this subtype was
the dominant subtype of BRLF1 in healthy populations
in the area studied. The prevalent mutations of this subtype were completely identical to the GD1 strain [25]
and the EBV strain in NPC cell line C666-1, which were
both established from Southern China. Unfortunately,
we were unable to compare the prevalent rates in our
samples with that in Southern China, because the distribution data of BRLF1 subtypes is not available for the
populations in Southern China. Interestingly, a silent
mutation A®G at 103654 was found in all the wild isolates, suggesting this interchange may be a specific marker of the EBV strains in local area and the local EBV

strains may stem from a common ancestral virus different from the other BRLF1 groups.
The AA mutations in the functional domains and CTL
epitopes from this study suggest that not only BRLF1
gene subtypes, but also mutations in functional domains
and CTL epitopes exhibit specific distribution among 3
sample groups.
As a transcriptional activator, Rta plays an important
role in the switch from latency to a productive infection.
Three domains, dimerization, DNA binding, and transactivation, contribute to this function. In this study, we
found the dimerization domain was highly conserved
without any AA mutations, suggesting its critical function in the lytic activation. DNA binding domain was
mainly affected by mutation R®M at residue 273 and
K®E at residue 316 and these changes were significantly higher in NPC. R®M at residue 273 may be of
great importance because interchange from hydrophilic
to hydrophobic amino acid may alter the affinity of protein with DNA, while mutation at position 316 may
contribute less to the change of the capacity of DNA
binding, according to the results of Manet, E and colleague[10]. Although multiple AA mutations were detected
in the transactivation domain, only one mutation at residue 542, which was located in the absolutely essential 90
C-terminal AAs for the protein’s transcriptional activation, may have a significant impact on the transcription
activity [10]. It may be of significance because it has
been reported that variations in EBV-interacting molecules might alter DNA binding and transcription activity
and thus may contribute to the tumorigenesis of EBV
associated malignancies [30]. Interestingly, these 3 dominant mutations (R®M at residue 273, K®E at residue
316 and S®N at residue 542) affecting functional
domains were all included in the subtype BR1-C, but
the two mutations at residues 273 and 316 were not
detected in the isolates of subtype BR1-A at all (0/119).
The subtype BR1-A is preferentially present in healthy
donors, while BR1-C is more frequent in NPCs. Moreover, the two mutations at residues 273 and 316 in
BR1-C were seen more in NPC. These observations
indicate that these two AA mutations may be of great
importance in the carcinogenesis of NPC. These two
mutations can also be potentially used as a gene marker
to distinguish subtype BR1-A from other subtypes in the
area observed.
Studies have shown that EBV can elicit strong CTL
responses which direct against a limited number of viral
proteins [31-33]. Focus has been on the mutations of
CTL epitopes in EBV latent-expressing proteins for their
important roles in the associated malignancies, while little is known about the proteins which are expressed in
the lytic phase. In the present study, we found 3 of 16
identified CTL epitopes of Rta were affected by AA

Page 6 of 8

mutations (Table 3). Epitope ERP was affected in a few
isolates; while epitopes NAA and QKE were frequently
affected by mutations, with relatively lower mutation
rates in malignant groups (EBVaGC or NPC) than in
healthy donors. This was contrary to the general belief
that the viral strains associated with malignancies can
evade immune surveillance by altering amino acids
within CTL epitopes [34]. CTL directed against immediate-early (IE) proteins is a pivotal step to control the
virus lytic activation. The sequence analysis to all
known Rta CTL epitopes provides valuable information
for choosing target epitopes for control of EBV lytic
activation.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have identified 5 distinct subtypes of
BRLF1 in Northern Chinese EBV isolates in multiple
clinical specimens. The subtype BR1-C is more frequent
in NPCs, while BR1-A preferentially presents in healthy
donors. Mutation analysis in functional domains and
CTL epitopes revealed specific distribution of mutations
among 3 specimen groups. The impact of these alterations on functions of Rta and immunological recognition
of EBV is potentially interesting and needs more functional studies. Further investigation in extended areas
and EBV associated diseases will enhance our understanding of BRLF1 gene polymorphism and their association with tumors.
Materials and methods
Specimens, cells and DNA extraction

Thirty-four EBVaGCs, 57 NPCs, 28 TWs and 2 EBV
positive cell lines (GC cell line SNU-719, NPC cell line
C666-1) were used in this study. Tumor tissues of GCs
and NPCs were collected from major hospitals of
Shandong Province in the Northern China, a non-endemic
area of NPC. The infection of EBV in GC and NPC tissues
was determined by EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) 1 in
situ hybridization, as described previously [35]. TWs were
collected from the healthy donors in the same geographic
regions. The EBV-positive TWs were determined by the
BamHI W fragment positive signals, using PCR with a
BamHI W specific primer pair [36]. EBV positive cell lines
SNU-719 and C666-1 were maintained in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) [26,27].
The B95-8 cell line was used as a source of the prototype
EBV genome. All the carcinoma patients as well as the
healthy individuals gave an informed consent for the
study and the study was approved by the Medical
Ethics Committee at the Medical College of Qingdao
University, China.
DNAs used in this study were extracted from fresh
specimens and cell lines by using the standard method
with proteinase K digestion and phenol-chloroform

purification. QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit (QIAGEN
GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was used to extract the DNA
from paraffin-embedded tumor tissues.
Amplification of DNA

Specific oligonucleotide primers flanking the BRLF1
gene were designed for nested PCR (Table 4). In each
set of PCR, DNA from EBV-positive B95-8 cell lines
was used as positive control, and nuclease-free distilled
water served as negative control. For the amplification,
the first round polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 1 ×
PCR reaction buffer, 100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.5 μM
of each primer, 200 μM of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, and 1 U Pfu Taq polymerase (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). PCR amplification
was performed with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5
min. Then, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s,
annealing at 55°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 1 min.
A final elongation step at 72°C for 10 min was also conducted. BRLF1-A1 combined with BRLF1-A2 (splice1),
BRLF1-B1 with BRLF1-B2 (splice2) and BRLF1-C1 with
BRLF1-C2 (splice3) as the outer primers. When necessary, 2 μl of the PCR product were taken for a second
round of PCR, using internal primers: BRLF1-A2 combined with BRLF1-A3 (splice1), BRLF1-B3 with BRLF1B4 (splice2), and BRLF1-C3 with C4 (splice3). In order
to prevent contamination, several measurements were
taken, such as frequently changing gloves and cleaning
the equipment, using aerosol-resistant pipette tips for
PCR, and performing different procedures in separate
areas. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose gel.

Sequencing analysis of PCR products

PCR products were purified using a gel extraction kit
(QIAEX II; QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany), under
the conditions specified by the manufacturer. PCR
amplified fragments were sequenced by means of a
Prism ready reaction Dyedeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster, USA).
Data analysis

The sequence data were checked for any homology in
BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and were compared with
the B95-8 prototype strain. Alignments between sequences
were analyzed using DNA Star software (DNASTAR, Inc,
version 5.0). The sequences from representative samples
were used to draw a phylogenetic tree. Either c2 test or
Fisher’s exact test (2-sided) was performed to determine
the distribution difference of the EBV variations among
the EBVaGCs, NPCs, and the TWs from the healthy
adults. Significance was set at P value < 0.05.
