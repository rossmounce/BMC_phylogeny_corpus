Abstract
Background: The laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) is an important model for studying many
aspects of human health and disease. Detailed knowledge on genetic variation between strains is
important from a biomedical, particularly pharmacogenetic point of view and useful for marker
selection for genetic cloning and association studies.
Results: We show that Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in commonly used rat strains are
surprisingly well represented in wild rat isolates. Shotgun sequencing of 814 Kbp in one wild rat
resulted in the identification of 485 SNPs as compared with the Brown Norway genome sequence.
Genotyping 36 commonly used inbred rat strains showed that 84% of these alleles are also
polymorphic in a representative set of laboratory rat strains.
Conclusion: We postulate that shotgun sequencing in a wild rat sample and subsequent
genotyping in multiple laboratory or domesticated strains rather than direct shotgun sequencing of
multiple strains, could be the most efficient SNP discovery approach. For the rat, laboratory strains
still harbor a large portion of the haplotypes present in wild isolates, suggesting a relatively recent
common origin and supporting the idea that rat inbred strains, in contrast to mouse inbred strains,
originate from a single species, R. norvegicus.

Background
Genetic variation exists between individuals (or strains) of
all organisms and it makes up the genetic basis for phenotypic differences between individuals. In addition, genetic
variation functions as a valuable resource for mapping
phenotypic traits in model organisms. Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant form of
genetic variation and therefore dominate high-resolution
genetic mapping strategies. Moreover, numerous well-per-

forming high-throughout SNP detection technologies
have been developed, like oligonucleotide array-based
technology,
mass-spectrometry-based
technology
(MALDI-TOF), and sequence-based technology (pyrosequencing, DHPLC) [1], which makes automated SNP
detection favored above the more labor-intensive detection of microsatellite markers [2].

Since the availability of its genome, the laboratory rat is
gaining influence as a genetic model organism [3]. In
addition, over 200 well-characterized inbred strains that
are models for a wide variety of human diseases are available [4,5]. However, the availability of genetic tools, like
a dense genome-wide SNP marker set, is still subordinate
compared to other commonly used model organisms.
This is illustrated by the number of entries in dbSNP, the
central SNP repository of NCBI [6]: the amount of human
(>10,000,000), chicken (>3,000,000), and mouse
(>500,000) entries surpass the amount of rat entries
(>43,000) spectacularly. In search for rat SNPs, experimental [7,8] and computational [9] approaches have
been employed, but these efforts primarily resulted in
SNPs associated with coding regions. For genetic mapping
purposes, a much denser marker set, preferentially equally
distributed over the genome, is required.
Laboratory rat strains are thought to be established from a
limited number of founder animals originating from a
domesticated wild population [10,11]. The value of
inbred strains emanates from the close genetic uniformity
that facilitates phenotyping and genotyping. In principle,
inbred strains are selectively bred for certain traits from a
genetically diverse pool, comprising diverse genetic information about the trait. However, since many of the current rat strains were derived from common ancestral
stocks and simply inbred to increase genetic uniformity,
inbred strains clearly share alleles [12]. Although such
simplified models are essential for biomedical research,
modulating effects on the clinical manifestation of a trait
resulting from genetic heterogeneity in a population can
only be studied to a limited extent in F1 hybrids. The use
of a carefully chosen selection of inbred strains may
address this issue, but the choice depends on knowledge
on the relationship between the strains and hence the
degree of genetic variation. Alternatively, wild-derived
strains may be good alternatives to introduce sufficient
genetic variation in laboratory experiments [13,14].
Based on a preliminary observation that alleles from laboratory rat strains are frequently detected in wild-derived
samples, we developed a wild rat-based SNP discovery
approach. The method consists of shotgun sequencing of

a wild rat-derived genomic library followed by comparison with the published rat genome (strain Brown Norway). Genotyping commonly used rat strains for newly
identified SNPs revealed that 84% of SNP-alleles (and
87% of all genetic variation) occurring between BN and a
single wild individual is also represented in one or more
laboratory strains. A user-friendly webtool allows exploration of the genetic variation between any arbitrary combinations of two strains that were used in this study, making
all information directly available for experimental use.

Results
Wild rat-based SNP discovery
It is generally believed that commonly used rat strains
originate from a wild-derived founder population of limited size [10]. To examine whether polymorphisms found
in laboratory strains are still represented in individuals of
the wild population, we typed two wild-derived samples
for confirmed SNPs of the CASCAD database [9]. Interestingly, about 53% of alleles (n = 147), which were confirmed to exist in laboratory strains, were also represented
in wild 1, wild 2 or both (not shown). Hence, a preselection of highly likely candidate SNPs could potentially be
made by genotyping wild individuals and comparing the
sequences to the rat genome sequence (Brown Norway).

Accordingly, we performed random shotgun sequencing
on a genomic library of a wild rat (wild 1). We generated
shotgun traces (814 Kbp) by bidirectional sequencing of
about 1,600 colonies (Table 1). 85.5% of the reads (2545/
2975; Table 1) could be mapped to a unique location in
the Brown Norway rat genome using BLAT [15], resulting
in the automated identification of nearly 5,000 ambiguous nucleotide positions (potential polymorphisms).
Manual inspection of the sequencing reads reduced this
set of potential polymorphisms to a set of 746 real SNPs
and 122 indels. The average SNP rate between BN (BN/
SsNMcw; genome sequencing project) and this single wild
rat is estimated to be about 1 per 900 bp and, hence, discovery of a novel SNP can be expected every second shotgun read. A subset of the discovered SNPs was verified and
genotyped in 36 commonly used strains (including BN).
To this end, we designed primers for 451 SNP-containing
amplicons (about 300 bp) of which 416 (92.2%) were

tions, one 3-bp substitution, one 5-bp substitution, and
861 SNPs, of which only one was tri-allelic. The amplicons are randomly distributed over the genome (Fig. 1).
We observed heterozygous positions in the outbred
strains, but unexpectedly some were also found in the
inbred strains (for detailed information: [see Additional
file 1] or [6]). For our analysis, we considered these loci to
be polymorphic as compared to the BN genome sequence.
From the 746 shotgun-based candidate SNPs, 685 were
located in the 416 PCR amplicons that worked, and 485
(71%) were reconfirmed by resequencing (shotgunbased; Table 2). Strikingly, for 408 (84%) of the confirmed SNPs, the wild rat allele is also present in one or
more commonly used strains, with only 36 (7.4%) being
specific to BN (Table 2). Of the remaining 77 (16%) SNPs,
wild rat alleles are not present in any of the 36 selected
strains and could be considered wild rat-specific. These
results illustrate that shotgun sequencing one wild individual efficiently identifies shared polymorphisms among
commonly used rat strains.

successfully read by unidirectional sequencing of the PCR
products, resulting in roughly 119 Kbp high quality
sequence per strain or individual (Table 1).
Wild rat-derived SNP characteristics
The verification of 746 candidate SNPs by ampliconbased resequencing in 36 inbred rat strains and three
wild-derived samples (wild 1, 2, and 3) revealed 960 polymorphisms, consisting of 90 indels, seven 2-bp substitu-

While genotyping by resequencing, 358 novel SNPs were
discovered that were not identified in the shotgun
sequencing experiment (genotyping-based; Table 2).
About 39% (139) of this set can be accounted for by differences in the sequence coverage between the shotgun
reads and the resequencing genotyping reads (Table 2),
whereas the remaining part of this set is strongly biased
towards SNPs that are not polymorphic between BN and
wild rat 1 and thus could not have been discovered in the
shotgun experiment. Interestingly, about 37% of the
newly discovered SNPs are polymorphic between the
shotgun sequenced wild rat and any of the inbred strains
(Table 2). When considering all SNPs that are polymorphic in the set of 36 commonly used laboratory strains, of
the majority (66%) the wild rat allele is found back in one
of the strains (total; Table 2) and this percentage increases
only slightly (70%) when two other wild individuals
(wild 2 and 3) are included in the analysis. This indicates
that wild rat-based SNP discovery is already highly efficient using a single wild sample.
Based on the genotyping results, the SNP rate between BN
and the shotgun sequenced wild rat (wild 1) is 1 SNP per
190 bp (626 SNPs/119 Kbp). The SNP rate within the 36
rat strains, including BN, is 1 in 158 (Table 2;
45+204+505 SNPs/119 Kbp) and the SNP rate in the
entire experiment, including the wild rat (wild 1), BN, and
the other strains is 1 in 141 bp (Table 2; 843 SNPs/119
Kbp). To compare wild rat inter-individual variation with
the inter-strain variation for commonly used inbred
strains, we calculated the number of SNPs that are polymorphic when comparing arbitrary combinations of 3
strains. Genotyping of 861 SNP positions in the three wild

rats resulted in 438 polymorphic positions, whereas the
most polymorphic combination of inbred strains in this
experiment (BN, BH, and SHR) yielded 427 SNPs. This
indicates that three random, but potentially related,
Dutch wild rats are about equally polymorphic as three
carefully selected inbred strains. Inclusion of wild isolates
from other locations worldwide may increase the efficiency of the SNP discovery approach.
Intraspecific phylogenetic network
Relationships among different rat strains have been determined previously by phylogenetic tree reconstruction
based on microsatellite markers [16,17]. However,
intraspecific relationships for laboratory strains are often
very challenging to determine, due to small genetic distances and complex gene flow. The resulting multitude of
plausible trees is best expressed by a network, which displays alternative potential evolutionary paths in the form
of cycles [18]. We used Network software (v4.111
Reduced-Joining, [19]) to construct a spatial network,
based on 861 SNP markers in 36 rat strains and three wild
rat individuals (Fig. 2). The three wild individuals are
grouped together, possibly due to the geographic and possibly genetic relation between the samples, but in accordance with the last paragraph of the previous section, they
appear relatively unrelated as compared to the set of
inbred strains.

The majority of the SNPs (485 of 861) was selected for
being polymorphic between wild 1 and BN. As a result,
different BN substrains (BN/Ztm, BN/Crl), depicted as a
double-sized end node because of high similarity, and different wild rat individuals (wild 1, wild 2, and wild 3) are
grouped together as the outliers. Several strains that are
known to be closely related (source RGD-strains: [20]) are
also grouped together, like DA and COP or SS and SR.
Interestingly, WKY is also an outlier, indicating that
besides BN, this strain can be utilized as an alternative
mapping strain. WKY is already commonly used as a normotensive control strain in genetic mapping of blood
pressure quantitative trait loci [21]. WKY is known to be

closely related to SHR and these strains are indeed
grouped together (Fig. 2). Additionally, BDII and BDIX
are related and BDE is an RI strain from E3. These strain
combinations are also grouped together. Wistar is contributing to a large subset of these strains, like WKY, WC,
BDII, MWF, LEW, and WF, which contributes to the complexity of the network structure.
Data availability
The use of genetic markers for mapping traits in rat strains
has been exploited for long time already. Current marker
sets in rats are mostly limited to microsatellites [22,23],
which are not abundantly available and are commonly
detected in a more laborious way than SNPs. In this study,
we have determined a total of about 35,000 genotypes
(about 960 loci in 36 inbred strains), out of which the vast
majority are SNPs. This data is accessible via a versatile
webtool [24]. Pairs of strains of interest can be selected
and explored on presence of verified genetic variation.
Besides a graphical representation of the location of the
SNPs on a genome map, primer sequences that were successfully used in our experiments are also provided. In a
pairwise comparison matrix (Table 3), we plotted the
absolute number of polymorphic positions for each of the
(sub-)strains or individuals used. Interestingly, for some
strains different alleles are observed in substrains (e.g.
BN/Crl differs from BN/Ztm at 4 positions), in line with
previous observations [8].
Simulation experiment wild rat-based SNP discovery
To get insight in the benefits of using wild rats in SNP discovery studies, we simulated larger scale experiments
based on the results obtained in the experiments
described above. Shotgun sequencing of 814 Kbp resulted
in the identification of 485 SNPs. For 408 of those, the
wild rat allele was also represented in laboratory rat
strains and hence of interest for research purposes. The
maximum amount of SNPs that can be discovered by fully
sequencing this single rat is calculated by multiplying the
SNP frequency (408/814,440) with the rat genome size
(2,48 Gbp), which is 1,252,911 SNPs. Since none of our

shotgun reads were overlapping, we can calculate the relation between shotgun sequencing reads of the wild rat and
the amount of SNPs that will be found by scaling up this
methodology, assuming random distribution of 400 bp
shotgun reads over the genome (Fig. 3a). One million
shotgun reads of a single wild rat would already result in
the discovery of 200,000 novel SNPs that are polymorphic
in commonly used rat strains. This simulation indicates
that a relatively small sequencing effort could potentially
result in a vast expansion of the amount of genetic variation for the rat.
Because shotgun sequencing was only done in the wild rat
1, we cannot make a direct comparison between wild ratbased SNP discovery and SNP discovery based on rat
strains separately. However, a similar simulation experiment can be performed by treating the genotyping resequencing as shotgun reads. For wild 1, this would result in
the identification of 577 SNPs as compared to the BN
genome sequence. For 539 of those, the wild rat allele is
found back in one of the inbred strains. For the combination of three strains most polymorphic as compared to BN
in this experiment, the latter number would be 304, 292,
and 287 for AUG, SHR, and WF, respectively. Simulations
based on these numbers show that it requires nearly two
times as much shotgun sequencing in different inbred
strains separately to discover the same amount of SNPs
that can be found using the wild rat shotgun sequencing
approach. It should be mentioned that parallel shotgun
sequencing of all 36 inbred strains until saturation has the

potential to yield 1.6 times as many SNPs as compared to
the wild-derived approach (Fig. 3b). An advantage of
using inbred strains for SNP discovery is that the genotype
of the strain is immediately known. Nevertheless, reconfirmation of the SNP or genotyping of other strains of
interest may be necessary anyway, minimizing the relevance of this advantage.

Discussion
An increase in the amount of documented genetic variation for the rat will be essential to allow for high-resolution genetic mapping of the many inherited traits that
have now been described for a wide variety of rat inbred
strains. In addition, insight into genetic variation between
rat strains provides valuable information on genetic relationships between strains, which can be instrumental to
dissect the genetic basis of phenotypic differences. The
wild rat-based shotgun sequencing method described
here provides an efficient approach to generate such a
dense map of genetic variation. To be able to benefit from

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:170

haplotype-based mapping approaches [25-28] a high
marker density is needed to first reliably define haplotype
blocks in strains of interest [29]. For the mouse, it has
recently been announced that 15 inbred strains will be
fully resequenced to achieve this goal [30]. With extreme
dense genotype maps, it may even become possible to
clone traits by haplotype-based in silico mapping [25], but
to achieve this, it is estimated that complete sequences of
over 50 strains are needed [29]. Although densities
needed for these approaches are not reached, we do show
here that wild rat-based SNP discovery is potentially much
more effective than shotgun sequencing different inbred
strains. We propose that the most effective SNP discovery
strategy for the rat would be one based on shotgun
sequencing of a single wild-derived sample and subsequent low-cost high-throughput genotyping of the resulting candidates in the laboratory strains of interest. Many
other model organisms are currently undergoing full coverage sequencing and SNP discovery in these organisms
will become increasingly important, especially for those
organisms that are selectively bred for specific traits, such
as cow and pig. Pilot experiments using for example wildderived swine samples could be performed to test whether
it is eligible to efficiently transfer the wild isolate-based
SNP discovery strategy to other organisms.
Our results do provide insight in the genetic descent of the
laboratory rat. It is generally accepted that current rat
strains underwent two major genetic bottlenecks. First,
they originate from a small founder population of domesticated wild rats and second, they were selectively inbred
to obtain homogeneity [11]. The three Dutch wild rats
used in this study are potentially relatively closely related
as compared to wild rats from different parts of the world,
but the genetic variation between them is mostly larger
than or sporadically equal to any combination of three
inbred strains, indeed suggesting the existence a common
genetic bottleneck for laboratory strains. In addition, the
laboratory rat does not show an extensive polymorphism
rate in the MHC (major histocompatibilty complex) as
compared to other species [31], like human, cattle etc.
Cramer et al. has analyzed the MHC of wild rats and compared the data with those from inbred strains [32]. In line
with our observation, there were not many new haplotypes.
We observed that wild rat genetic variation is to a large
extent represented in the inbred strains, which is in sharp
contrast to genetic variation in wild-derived mouse strains
that is mostly unique [33]. Contrary to classical mouse
inbred strains, where multiple subspecies contribute to
the genetic make-up [13,34] and recent mouse strains,
derived from different Mus species [35], laboratory rat
strains are most likely descending from a single rat species, Rattus norvegicus [10].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/170

An independent study using 42 microsatellites in German
and Japanese wild-derived samples showed that the
genetic profiles were quite divergent, partially owing to
different geographic locations [36]. Our study involved
only Dutch wild rats, suggesting that the inclusion of wild
rats from different parts of the world could result in even
more efficient SNP discovery, although it also remains to
be demonstrated what proportion of the additional discovered alleles is present in the inbred strains and if a geographic bias for this exists.
When multiple SNPs are present per locus/amplicon,
independent haplotypes can be discerned. The genetic
variation identified here is mostly organized in a limited
amount of haplotypes per locus (Table 4). Theoretically,
an amplicon containing two or three SNPs can be represented by four and eight haplotypes, respectively, but in
our dataset the vast majority of amplicons harboring multiple SNPs is represented by only two or three haplotypes
(Table 4). Again, these observations suggest the existence
of a common and small founding population with very
limited haplotype diversity and/or a very narrow genetic
bottleneck before inbred strain selection. The observed
small genetic basis in a wide selection of laboratory rat
strains does not mimic genetic variation in the human
population and as a result, studies and pharmacological
tests in rat models neglect potential modulatory effects
caused by genetic variation. Although the use of F1 crosses
and mosaic populations [37] could address this issue, our
data suggests that wild-derived rats may be very useful to
this end, since a large amount of all genetic variation
present in a large selection of inbred strains, is already represented in a limited number of individuals. Therefore, it
would be very interesting to investigate genetic variation
in recently domesticated inbred [38] and outbred rats
such as wild-type Groningen rats (WTG) [39]. Alternatively, careful selection of inbred strains based on genotyping data and subsequent random breeding may also
expose the wild side of laboratory rats.

Conclusion
We describe a SNP discovery platform for the rat that is
based on two steps. First, candidate SNPs are discovered
by shotgun sequencing a wild rat, followed by genotyping
laboratory strains of interest. We show that 84% of alleles
in wild rats as compared to the sequenced Brown Norway
rat genome are also represented in a set of 36 laboratory
strains. Hence, the approach described here would be an
efficient strategy for the discovery of novel informative
SNPs in the laboratory rat. Inclusion of other wild samples, preferably from different locations in the world
could result in an even more effective SNP discovery platform, as the three wild rats in our study, caught in relative
close vicinity to each other, were already more polymorphic than the most polymorphic combination of carefully

selected inbred strains. Based on the more than 34,000
genotyping datapoints obtained in this study, we postulate two things. First, laboratory rats originate from a single rat species, and inbred stains are relatively closely
related with a limited number of haplotypes, reflecting
known genetic bottlenecks in strain establishment. Second, wild rats have the potential to represent the degrees
of genetic variation as present in the human population
much more efficiently than a random selection of inbred
strains. This makes them or wild-derived strains potentially well-suited for studying modulatory effects of
genetic background variation on specific phenotypes,
such as behavior or responses to drug treatment.

Methods

Wild rat 1 (Rattus norvegicus) was caught in the canals of
Utrecht and kindly provided by the Pest Control Service of
the City of Utrecht (Utrecht, The Netherlands). Wild rat 2
was trapped in Gassel, a village located approximately 100
km south-east of Utrecht and was kindly provided by Tien
Derks (Gassel, The Netherlands). Wild rat 3 was caught in
a basement in Amsterdam, located 50 km north of Utrecht
and kindly provided Romke Koch (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Rat strains BN/Crl and Crl:Wistar (outbred) were
obtained from Charles River The Netherlands. Liver samples of commonly used rat strains ACI/Ztm, BDE/Ztm,
BDII/Ztm, BDIX/Ztm, BDV/Ztm, BH/Ztm, BN/Ztm, BS/
Ztm, DA/Ztm, E3/Ztm, F344/Ztm, LE/Ztm, LEW/Ztm,
LOU/CZtm, MNS/Ztm, MWF/Ztm, NAR/Ztm, OM/Ztm,
PAR/Ztm, R33/Ztm, WC/Ztm, WF/Ztm, WKY/Ztm were
provided by D.W. (Hannover Medical School, Germany)
and liver samples of strains AO/OlaHsd, AUG/OlaHsd,
BUF/SimRijHsd, COP/Hsd, DA/OlaHsd, LUDW/OlaHsd,

PVG/OlaHsd, RP/AEurRijHsd, SHR/NHsd, SR/JrHsd, SS/
JrHsd, WAG/RijHsd and 2 individuals of Hsd:SD (outbred) were kindly provided by Harlan (Horst, The Netherlands). Samples were lysed overnight in 20 ml lysis buffer,
containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 200 mM of NaCl, 0.2%
of SDS, 5 mM of EDTA, and 100 Âµg/ml of freshly added
Proteinase K at 55Â°C under continuous rotation. Tissue
debris was spinned down for 20 min at 10,000 Ã g and
supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitated by
adding an equal volume of isopropanol, mixing and centrifugation for 20 min, 10,000 Ã g at 4Â°C. The supernatant
was removed by gently inverting the tube and the pellets
were washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 1000 Âµl
water. The concentration was measured by Optical Densitometry at 260 nm.
Wild rat-derived genomic library construction and shotgun
sequencing
Sheared wild rat-derived genomic DNA of approximately
1â2 Kbp in size was cloned into the SmaI-site of pUC19.
Fractions of the glycerol stock of the transformed library
(E. coli DH10B) were plated on LB-plates containing 50
Âµg/ml ampicilin, 200 Âµg/ml IPTG, and 0.01% X-gal for
standard blue/white screening on inserts. White colonies
were picked in 20 Âµl water. Lysis occurred at 95Â°C for 10
min. 5 Âµl of 5Ã diluted lysate was used for the PCR reaction. For PCR, universal M13 primers were used, namely
M13F:
TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT,
M13R:
AGGAAACAGCTATGACCAT. PCR, sequencing and
cycling conditions were similar as for strain genotyping,
described below. Sequencing was performed using universal M13 primers.

PCR conditions for strain genotyping
PCR was carried out using a touchdown thermocycling
program (92Â°C for 60 sec; 12 cycles of 92Â°C for 20 sec,
65Â°C for 20 sec with a decrement of 0.6Â°C per cycle, 72Â°C
for 30 sec; followed by 20 cycles of 92Â°C for 20 sec, 58Â°C
for 20 sec and 72Â°C for 30 sec; 72Â°C for 180 sec;
GeneAmp9700, Applied Biosystems) and contained 30â
50 ng genomic DNA, 0.2 ÂµM of each forward primer and
0.2 ÂµM of each reverse primer, 400 ÂµM of each dNTP, 25
mM Tricine, 7.0% Glycerol (w/v), 1.6% DMSO (w/v), 2
mM MgCl2, 85 mM Ammonium acetate pH 8.7 and 0.2 U
Taq Polymerase in a total volume of 10 Âµl.

Simulation model for wild rat-based SNP discovery
To estimate the number of SNPs to be discovered by the
wild rat resequencing approach we performed computer
simulations using the observed sample-specific polymorphism frequencies and the rat genome size of 2.48 Gbp as
an input. We used a Monte-Carlo method for the placement of N 400-bp shotgun reads to the genome and calculated the total size of genome covered by N shotgun
reads. To obtain a conservative estimate by assuming low
heterozygosity in wild-derived strain the estimate of
number of SNPs is given by product of covered genome
size and polymorphism rate.

Sequencing reactions, purification, and analysis
PCR products were diluted with 25 Âµl water and 1 Âµl was
directly used as template for the sequencing reactions.
Sequencing reactions, containing 0.25 Âµl BigDYE (v3.1;
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 3.75 Âµl 2.5Ã
dilution buffer (Applied Biosystems) and 0.4 ÂµM universal M13 primer in a total volume of 10 Âµl, were performed
using cycling conditions recommended by the manufacturer (40 cycles of 92Â°C for 10 sec, 50Â°C for 5 sec and
60Â°C for 120 sec). Of sequencing products, 5 Âµl was purified by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 40 mM
sodium-acetate and analyzed on 96-capillary 3730XL
DNA analyzers (Applied Biosystems), using the standard
RapidSeq protocol. Sequences were analyzed for presence
of heterozygous mutations using PolyPhred [40], followed by manual inspection of the polymorphic positions.

Automation
All PCR and sequencing reactions were set up on a Tecan

Mapping of shotgun reads and SNP discovery
Shotgun reads were assigned to positions in the RGSC 3.1
rat genome assembly using blat search [15]. Shotgun
reads that complied with our mapping criteria, namely
those having at least 80 identical bp for the best hit and
no more than 60 identical bp for second blat hit were
retained for further analysis. Blast nucleotide sequence
alignments between shotgun read and corresponding
genomic segment were used for discovery of single base
variations (including single base indels). A site was treated
as polymorphic only in the case when it has identical 5'and 3'-flanks of at least 5 bp. A custom designed webapplication was employed for manual chromatogram
inspection and confirmation of a correct shotgun base-call
for every polymorphic SNP locus. Primer design for resequencing was performed using a local web-interface [41]
to the PRIMER3 program [42].
