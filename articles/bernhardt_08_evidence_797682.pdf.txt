Abstract
Background: Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the means by which the cell translates DNA sequence into
protein according to the rules of the genetic code. A credible proposition is that tRNA was formed
from the duplication of an RNA hairpin half the length of the contemporary tRNA molecule, with
the point at which the hairpins were joined marked by the canonical intron insertion position found
today within tRNA genes. If these hairpins possessed a 3'-CCA terminus with different
combinations of stem nucleotides (the ancestral operational RNA code), specific aminoacylation
and perhaps participation in some form of noncoded protein synthesis might have occurred.
However, the identity of the first tRNA and the initial steps in the origin of the genetic code remain
elusive.
Results: Here we show evidence that glycine tRNA was the first tRNA, as revealed by a vestigial
imprint in the anticodon loop sequences of contemporary descendents. This provides a plausible
mechanism for the missing first step in the origin of the genetic code. In 448 of 466 glycine tRNA
gene sequences from bacteria, archaea and eukaryote cytoplasm analyzed, CCA occurs
immediately upstream of the canonical intron insertion position, suggesting the first anticodon
(NCC for glycine) has been captured from the 3'-terminal CCA of one of the interacting hairpins
as a result of an ancestral ligation.
Conclusion: That this imprint (including the second and third nucleotides of the glycine tRNA
anticodon) has been retained through billions of years of evolution suggests Crick's 'frozen
accident' hypothesis has validity for at least this very first step at the dawn of the genetic code.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Dr Eugene V. Koonin, Dr Rob Knight and Dr David H
Ardell.

Background
Di Giulio has argued persuasively that tRNA evolved from
the duplication of a hairpin half the length of the contemporary molecule, based on the homology between the 5'
and 3' halves of tRNA [1,2]. This has been supported by a
statistical analysis of the 5' and 3' halves of contemporary

tRNA by Widmann et al. (2005) which concluded that
their results 'support the hypothesis that the modern
tRNA cloverleaf arose from a single hairpin duplication
prior to the divergence of modern tRNA specificities and
the three domains of life' [3]. Di Giulio has suggested that
this hairpin origin has been preserved in the division of

some contemporary tRNA genes into two 'halves' by the
canonical intron insertion point between positions 37
and 38 in the anticodon loop, just one nucleotide downstream of the anticodon triplet [1].

duplication origin [12]. In order to confirm this preliminary finding we have analyzed the glycine tRNA gene
sequences from two online databases.

Results and discussion
From the experiments of Schimmel [4] it appears possible
that, prior to the emergence of coded protein synthesis,
there existed up to eleven hairpins with 3'-CCA termini
and particular stem nucleotides, allowing for specific aminoacylation (as has been demonstrated for hairpin analogues of eleven contemporary tRNAs; see Table 1, middle
column). Aminoacylated hairpins might have participated
in noncoded protein synthesis [5], or the hairpins could
have acted as 'handles' for amino acids that functioned as
cofactors [6], or, possibly, both could have been true.
Each of the hairpins was likely in equilibrium with its
duplex due to the symmetry of hydrogen bonding interactions. As shown in Figure 1, these partial duplexes appear
to be the forerunners of tRNA. Or, as Di Giulio has noted,
'...hairpin structures are apparently such close precursors
to tRNA molecules that, in a sense, they imply them' [7].
(Interestingly, in contemporary biology hairpin structures
of RNA give rise to many functional entities, such as protein binding motifs in mRNA and precursors to microRNAs.) However, the decisive event in the formation of the
first tRNA was almost certainly the ligation of the two hairpins (Figure 1, top right).
It is widely believed that the contemporary standard
genetic code has evolved from a simpler predecessor, and
that only a subset of the current 22 amino acids were originally encoded [8]. On the basis of an analysis of theories
of the origin of the genetic code, Trifonov [9] has produced a 'league table' of when amino acids were incorporated into the code, extending from the likely earliest to
the latest (providing a clue to which was the earliest
amino acid, Trifonov had previously found glycine to be
the most frequent amino acid amongst matching residues
in probable ancestral sequences of homologous proteins
between prokaryotes and eukaryotes [10]). The amino
acids listed according to Trifonov's proposed incorporation into the genetic code from earliest to latest are shown
in Table 1, left column. This order has been given some
support by a statistical analysis by Jordan et al. [11] of the
relative rate of amino acid gain/loss in orthologous proteins, where six out of eight amino acids found to be
decreasing in frequency are those predicted by Trifonov
[9] to have been incorporated into the genetic code at an
earlier stage, and eight out of twelve found to be increasing in frequency [11] are those predicted to have been
recruited later [9].
In previous work, we have found suggestive evidence of a
residual CCA sequence in the anticodon loop sequences
of contemporary glycine tRNAs, indicative of a hairpin

We have analyzed 466 glycine tRNA gene sequences from
bacteria, archaea and eukaryote cytoplasm taken from
Sprinzl and Vassilenko [13] (see Methods section for further details). Of these, 96% (448) have the sequence CCA
occurring immediately upstream of the canonical intron
insertion position. We have also analyzed > 200 mitochondrial and chloroplast glycine tRNA gene sequences
taken from [13] and [14]. Of these, almost 100% (208 of
209) have the sequence CCA occurring immediately
upstream of the canonical intron insertion position. The
data are consistent with our starting hypothesis [12] that
the first anticodon (NCC for glycine) was derived from
the 3'-terminal CCA of one of the interacting hairpins as a
result of an ancestral ligation event (Figure 1), and imply
that an 'accident' [8] lies at the heart of the genetic code
(see below).
As shown in Figure 1 (top left and middle), in our proposal
two hairpins would be in monomer-dimer equilibrium
before the seminal ligation event fixed them in the duplex
form. Each form could be aminoacylated with glycine by
an RNA predecessor of a modern aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (Figure 1, bottom left and middle). The ligated
duplex glycine RNA evolved into the modern glycine
tRNA, but in this proposal has also experienced expanded
evolution by duplication and mutation to give rise to the
other tRNAs (right bottom).
A consensus sequence of the anticodon arm derived from
the 466 bacterial, archaeal and eukaryote cytoplasm glycine tRNA gene sequences taken from [13], together with
a cloverleaf representation of the consensus sequence of
136 mammalian mitochondrial glycine tRNA genes taken
from [14] are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2A gives the nucleotide frequency at positions 27–43 of the modern glycine
tRNA gene sequences from bacteria, archaea and eukaryote cytoplasm. The conservation of the anticodon loop at
positions 35 and 36 of the anticodon itself, and position
37 (adjacent to the canonical intron insertion point) are
clearly indicated. The conservation of U33 is almost certainly due to its role in forming the characteristic U-turn
structure of the anticodon loop [15]. Figure 2B shows the
conservation in the anticodon loop of the more restricted
subset of the mammalian mitochondrial glycine tRNAs
[14] (100% conserved in positions 33–38 encompassing
the anticodon and intron insertion position, except for
position 36 where perfect conservation is disrupted by a
single sequence indicated to be from Physeter catadon
(sperm whale), which has a UCU anticodon; this expands
glycine codons to include AGA and AGG, in the standard

Proposed hairpin duplication origin of tRNA
Proposed hairpin duplication origin of tRNA. Hairpin monomer (top left) is in equilibrium with partial duplex (top middle),
both of which are able to be specifically aminoacylated with glycine by the RNA predecessor of contemporary glycyl-tRNA synthetase (bottom left and middle). The defining moment in the origin of tRNA was the ligation of the partial duplex, which created
a covalently joined molecule (top right), anticodon loop, and anticodon from the 3'-terminal CCA sequence of the upstream
hairpin [1,2,32]. Mutations (principally in the central loops) produced the precursor to contemporary glycine tRNA (bottom
right). Subsequent duplication and mutation to re-evolve the amino acid-specific RNA operational code sequences of the other
amino acid-accepting hairpins (with accompanying mutation of the anticodon) led to a proliferation of tRNA sequences and,
eventually, coded protein synthesis.

code the codons for arginine). While more significant variation within the isolated subgroup of mitochondrial and
chloroplast tRNAs would not have negated our proposal,
it is compelling that this has not occurred.
In order to investigate further the antiquity of the CCA
sequence in the anticodon loop of glycine tRNA, a phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the 466 glycine
tRNA gene sequences from bacteria, archaea and eukaryote cytoplasm taken from [13]. Figure 3 shows a representative phylogenetic relaxed neighbour joining tree. It
was not possible to identify an ancestral glycine tRNA
gene sequence, but despite this the results were intriguing
and suggestive. The tRNA gene sequences not containing
an anticodon loop CCA are localized on isolated branches
rather than spread throughout the tree, suggesting the loss
of the CCA sequence is more likely a derived rather than
ancestral character. The loss of this sequence in two sets of
tRNAs can be explained by independent events. Firstly, in
7 sequences from Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus
epidermidis (Figure 3, blue branch), a subset of glycine
tRNAs from these two species, A37 has been replaced by a
pyrimidine. If this substitution has the effect of weakening
the anticodon-codon interaction, it may have functioned
to exclude these tRNAs from being used in ribosomal protein synthesis consistent with their involvement now in
non-ribosomal protein synthesis of the bacterial cell wall
[16] (it has been proposed that a purine in position 37

functions to stabilize the adjacent anticodon-codon interaction through base stacking on to the anticodon-codon
helix [17]). Secondly, in 8 sequences from the hyperthermophilic archaeal species Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanopyrus kandleri and Pyrococcus sp. (Figure 3, red branches),
A37 has been replaced by G, perhaps because of a general
increase in G+C content in the tRNA and rRNA of these
species [18]. There are three other sequences not containing an anticodon loop CCA that appear to be isolated
examples, but in these cases their origin is unclear.
Schimmel's experimental work [4] suggests up to eleven
aminoacylated hairpins (including one specific for glycine) might have been in existence prior to the advent of
the tRNA molecule (Table 1, middle column). Why should
glycine have been the first amino acid encoded? The
assignment may have been made due to the relative prevalence of the various amino acids on the prebiotic, and
possibly even biotic earth. Although the nature of the primordial earth's atmosphere is controversial, in recent
experiments Miller and colleagues have shown that electric discharge stimulation even within an atmosphere containing 5% O2 (in 47.5% N2/47.5% CO2) produces small
quantities of amino acids 'consisting almost entirely of
glycine and racemic alanine', if analyzed in the presence
of an antioxidant [19]. Why should the codons GGN
(complementary to the NCC anticodons) have been the
first assigned codons? As suggested by Eigen and Schuster,

the GGN codons/NCC anticodons may have been
selected first due to the relative strength of the G-C hydrogen bonding interaction [20].
What might have caused the ligation event? As shown in
Figure 1 (top middle), the ends of the partial duplex would
have been juxtaposed. Therefore, ligation may have
occurred spontaneously, possibly catalyzed by a coordinated Mg2+ ion. However, we suspect that the ligation was
catalyzed by an ancestor of a self-splicing group I or II
intron, for the following reason. The conservation of an
intron insertion site between different organisms is often
taken to imply descent from a common ancestor. For
example, self-splicing group I introns found at the same
position in leucine tRNAs in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria are taken as supporting the bacterial origin of these
plastids [21,22]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suppose that protein-spliced tRNA introns, usually found
between nucleotides 37 and 38 in contemporary eukaryotes and archaea, have likewise descended from a common
ancestor, possibly a group I or II intron that was located at
this same position and was involved in the ancestral ligation event. This is consistent with the proposal that selfsplicing group I and (possibly) group II tRNA introns are

the most ancient introns, perhaps arising some 3,500 million years ago [23].
Regardless of the mechanism, ligation of the two hairpins
would have been a critical step for the creation of a prototRNA molecule, proto-anticodon loop and (possibly at a
later point) the anticodon itself. As a result of this seminal
event, a single proto-tRNA was formed, which subsequently went on to re-evolve the sequences of the other
hairpins already present, possibly by a process of duplication and mutation (Figure 1, bottom right). The idea of a
'bottleneck' through which only a single proto-tRNA
passed has also been made by Wolf and Koonin, and
explains the observation that contemporary tRNAs appear
to be descended from a single ancestral molecule [24].
Others have also concluded that tRNA has evolved from a
single ancestral molecule, including Ellington et al. [25]
and, as previously discussed, Widmann et al. [3], although
this is not a view shared by Di Giulio [26].
Our observations and proposal clearly have major implications for the origin of the genetic code, of which there
are five main theories:

and eukaryote cytoplasm, taken from [13]. Branches including tRNA gene sequences not containing an anticodon loop CCA
sequence are shown in colour, and indicated by the particular labels (with number of sequences in brackets).

1. The stereochemical hypothesis holds that the assignment of anticodons/codons to amino acids was based on
stereochemical affinity, that is, specific anticodon/codon
sequences bind to specific amino acids [8]. Although the
route from such an association to the structure of tRNA,
with its widely separated anticodon and amino acid binding site, is far from clear [25], the theory has gained
ground with the discovery of anticodon and/or codon
sequences in putative amino acid binding sites of in vitro
selected RNA aptamers. A correlation has been found for
seven of eight amino acids tested, with aptamers binding
glutamine not exhibiting this correlation [27] (Table 1,
right column). It is perhaps significant that so far no aptamers have been found that bind the 'earliest' amino acids (a
point also made by Wolf and Koonin [24]), although it
has been pointed out that achieving specific binding of
aptamers to a small amino acid such as glycine could be
difficult, due to the simplicity of its R group (H) and lack
of unique chemical groups with which it might present as
a binding motif. Naturally occurring glycine-binding

riboswitches have been discovered however in a variety of
bacterial species in the 5'-UTR of the gcvT operon that contains genes involved in glycine degradation [28]. The conserved sequences of these riboswitches contain no glycine
anticodon sequences. While a single glycine codon is
found at one of the binding sites, two of its three nucleotides are part of a stem structure and so not immediately
available for direct interaction with the amino acid [28].
2. The coevolutionary hypothesis holds that codons have
been reassigned to 'new' amino acids on the basis of biosynthetic descent from precursor amino acids, with Wong
suggesting by this reasoning that glycine, alanine, aspartic
acid, glutamic acid and serine were the earliest amino
acids [29].
3. The adaptive hypothesis proposes that the genetic code
has evolved in such a way so as to minimize the effects of
mutation, with the result that similar amino acids have
related codons [30].

Page 6 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:53

Knight et al. [31] have argued that these three theories
(above) are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and each
could have resulted in a code where chemically similar
amino acids are assigned to related codons. Certainly, the
coevolutionary and adaptive hypotheses concern the
code's evolution rather than its origin, and thus are compatible with our theory of a 'frozen accident' at the dawn
of the genetic code.
4. Others [e.g. [4,32-35]] have postulated an ancestral link
between the genetic code and the operational RNA code,
which occurs in the acceptor stem of contemporary tRNAs
[4]. This code, which has been termed the second genetic
code [36], comprises the three to four terminal base pairs
of the stem plus the adjacent discriminator base, and
determines specific aminoacylation by contemporary
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. This code is the basis of
Schimmel's work with aminoacylatable hairpins [4]. It is
possible that as part of the hairpin duplication event that
produced tRNA, the ancestral operational RNA coding
sequence was duplicated and subsequently evolved to
become both the contemporary operational RNA code
sequence and the anticodon. Rodin et al. [33-35] identify
the first three positions of the acceptor stem of contemporary tRNA as being homologous to the anticodon triplet
even though, as they themselves admit, 'straightforward
analysis failed to uncover any traces of homology in this
case' [35]. Despite this, they have produced a mechanism
for the elaboration of the genetic code by the production
of tRNAs containing complementary anticodons. Again,
while we believe such a mechanism could have been
involved in the code's evolution, the question of how the
code began still remains unanswered. We support the
premise that the hairpin duplication origin of tRNA holds
the key to the origin of the genetic code, but from a
slightly different perspective. As mentioned, on the basis
of homologies with contemporary glycine tRNAs, we
believe the first anticodons were derived from the 3'-terminal CCA of the upstream hairpin rather than from the
adjacent ancestral operational RNA code sequence.
5. Crick's 'frozen accident' hypothesis was originally presented as an explanation for the 'universality' of the
genetic code, although at the time he proposed it he
acknowledged the possibility of some natural variation
[8]. This variation and its extent, particularly in mitochondria, has become evident only more recently [37]. In its
extreme form the frozen accident theory proposes that the
assignment of codons/anticodons to amino acids was
completely random, but once made was locked in place
due to the hugely deleterious effect any changes would
have had on cell proteins. However, this extreme form of
the theory is not supported by a non-standard code being
found in organisms like the yeast Candida albicans [38]
and the ciliates Tetrahymena thermophila and Paramecium

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/53

tetraurelia [39]. Although it is now widely accepted that
the genetic code as a whole is not frozen and at least partially free to evolve, perhaps this is not true for all sections
of the code. Our work suggests the NCC glycine anticodons (derived from the 3'-CCA hairpin terminus) have
been retained through billions of years of evolution. In
addition, A37 (also part of the anticodon loop CCA
sequence; see Figure 2A) has been retained, due perhaps,
as previously discussed, to its ability to stabilize the adjacent anticodon-codon interaction (this position is normally occupied by either A or G [15]).
Finally, the conclusion reached from our study that glycine was the first amino acid incorporated into the genetic
code is in agreement with Trifonov's analysis of ancestral
protein sequences [10] and comprehensive review of the
various and varied theories of the origin of the genetic
code [9], Miller's experimental findings [19], and Jordan
et al.'s analysis of amino acid gain/loss in contemporary
proteins [11].

Conclusion
The origin of the genetic code has attracted many theorists
and resulted in almost as many theories for healthy and
vigorous debate. Our hypothesis speaks to the seminal
first step and is dependent upon tRNA originating from
the ligation of RNA hairpins with 3'-CCA termini. The
ligation was likely carried out by an ancestor of a selfsplicing group I or II intron, with the ligation point having
been retained as the most common position for proteinspliced introns in contemporary archaeal and eukaryote
tRNAs. In terms of this framework, we have uncovered a
previously overlooked feature of contemporary tRNA
sequences that potentially explains the very first step in
the origin of the genetic code. That this feature has been
retained over four billion years of evolution supports
Crick's hypothesis of a frozen accident, at least for this first
step in the origin of the genetic code. Our theory has an
elegant simplicity for providing the code's first 'stake in
the ground' and provides a clear link between the anticodon loop CCA sequence found in nearly all contemporary
glycine tRNA molecules and the proposed mechanism of
hairpin duplication.

Methods
tRNA databases
The analysis of glycine tRNA gene sequences from bacteria, archaea and eukaryote cytoplasm used the Compilation of tRNA sequences and sequences of tRNA genes
[13], which includes the Genomic tRNA Compilation, a
compilation of cytoplasmic tRNA gene sequences derived
from sequences of complete genomes included on DNA
databases (approximately 7600 tRNA gene sequences
from 131 complete genomes, covering bacteria, archaea,
and higher and lower eukaryotes, published up to Sep-

tember 2004) and the Compilation of tRNA Genes, a
summary of the published sequences of tRNA genes
which were sequenced individually, including approximately 350 sequences of cytoplasmic tRNA genes that are
not included in the Genomic tRNA Compilation.
The analysis of glycine tRNA gene sequences from mitochondria and chloroplasts used the Compilation of tRNA
Genes section of the Compilation of tRNA sequences and
sequences of tRNA genes [13] in conjunction with MamittRNA: Compilation of mammalian mitochondrial tRNA
genes [14], which currently contains 3064 tRNA gene
sequences from 150 fully sequenced genomes available
on GenBank database (NCBI).
All sequences were inspected manually in order to remove
duplicates, with the result that each tRNA gene sequence
is included in the respective analyses only once, unless the
same sequence occurs in more than one species.
Figure 2A was adapted from an image generated by WebLogo software available from [40]. Figure 2B was taken
from [14].
Phylogenetic analysis
For the phylogenetic analysis, the same 466 glycine tRNA
gene sequences (taken from [13]) were used as for the
anticodon arm analysis. Clearcut software [41] was used
to generate the relaxed neighbour joining tree files, which
were visualized using FigTree software [42].

sizes and rationalizes disparate evidence, observations
and claims: that modern tRNAs originated by duplication
of a primordial hairpin, that the position of tRNA introns
after position 37 is well-conserved in all domains of life,
that glycine is widely acknowledged to be encoded early
in the genetic code, that experimentally, acceptor stem
hairpins may be glycylated by modern-day glycyl-tRNA
synthetases, and of course that glycine is universally
encoded by GGN codons.
Additionally, although the authors do not raise this point,
their hypothesis could explain the nucleotide distribution
of the so-called "cardinal" nucleotide 37, 3' to the anticodon, which is nearly universally some modification of A,
or much less frequently a modification of G, which is also
a purine.
As compelling as all of this, we (the readers) must openly
address the logic of the authors' arguments in the face of
alternative possible explanations, and in particular, critically assess the direct evidence that they present for their
case. We must also bring out tacit assumptions where necessary and attempt to evaluate them critically.
We are accustomed to applying well-understood models
of sequence evolution to statistically evaluate similarity
due to homology. However, in doing this with tRNAs we
must be very careful, as these molecules violate the
assumptions of these conventional methods – owing to
their small size and intense functional constraint. For further discussion and reference of this issue for tRNAs please
refer to Widmann et al [3].

The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Reviewers' reports
Reviewer 1: David Ardell, University of California, Merced
In this concise and well-written manuscript, Bernhardt
and Tate present their case that the tRNA anticodon loop
originated in part by duplication of a hypothetical NCCA
3' overhang of a primordial hairpin that was the ancestor
of modern tRNAs. They assert that the universally conserved C35, C36 and A37 features of modern glycine
tRNAs are therefore homologous to the CCA tail of modern tRNAs, and that – by implication (by the Principle of
Continuity, using Crick's name for it) – glycine was the
first amino acid encoded in the genetic code and assigned
to GGN codons.

There are many reasons why this is a compelling argument, because, as documented by the authors, it synthe-

The chief alternative explanation – to homology – for
common features of different molecules is that they have
common functional constraint. Of course, some – perhaps many – functionally constrained characters in tRNAs
may ultimately be explained by common ancestry anyway. That is because they could have arisen by the "freezing" of specific random "accidents." By "accident" we
simply mean that other variants of certain traits may have
had at one time comparable fitness, but that then,
through the evolutionary refinement and augmentation
of function, other components of the biological system
those traits interact with become co-adapted to specific
variants, locking them in so that they could function well
together. Thus, in a kind of biological symmetry breaking,
historical accidents may become frozen and acquire novel
functional constraint by exaptation.
Authors' response: We would agree that random accidents
provide 'opportunity' in the sense of "a combination of circumstances favourable for the purpose" [43], that then, through
'evolutionary refinement and augmentation of function', can
indeed become functional constraints. In terms of the nascent
anticodon-codon interaction and the subsequent evolution of

coded protein synthesis, the proto-anticodon loop (N)CCA
sequence created by the ligation of the two hairpins may have
been absolutely required (the requirement for a purine in position 37 is discussed further in a later response to this reviewer).
Coded protein synthesis was not predestined. As argued by others, it must have arisen in small, incremental steps, each of
which had a selective advantage in itself (or, at least, was evolutionarily neutral) in order to be maintained. In fact, in terms
of the functional requirements for the development of coded
protein synthesis, a better descriptor than 'frozen accident' for
what we are proposing might be 'necessary' or 'essential accident'. We acknowledge that coded protein synthesis could possibly have arisen by an alternative mechanism, in which case
the presence of the (N)CCA sequence in the proto-anticodon
loop may not have been required. However, we would assert
that the appearance of this sequence constituted an essential
pre-step for the advent of coded protein synthesis as it is seen
today.
The major evidence presented by the authors for their
hypothesis is the nearly universal conservation of C35,
C36 and A37 among glycyl tRNAs and identity of the CCA
sequence with the CCA tail. They do not attempt any further demonstration of extended similarity of the anticodon loop to the 3' half of the acceptor stem, or indeed
statistically reinforce the underlying specific hypothesis of
tRNA origin by hairpin duplication due originally to Di
Giulio. So their argument relies strongly on prior work,
forcing us to evaluate some of that as well.
Authors' response: Apart from the highly conserved CCA
sequence, we have not found extended similarity of the anticodon loop to the 3' half of the acceptor stem in glycine tRNAs.
However, it is perhaps interesting to note that a cloverleaf
formed by the ligation of hairpins (as well as the hairpins themselves) based on the anticodon arm consensus sequence in Figure 2A, i.e. with the sequence 5'-AGCU...GCC/UUNCCA-3',
would be able to form the two terminal base pairs of the (acceptor) stem: U33-A38 and C/U32-G39 (underlined).
I must add at this point that the mitochondrial evidence
that they present is entirely superfluous to their claims.
The origin and divergence of mitochondria happened
long after the origins of tRNA and the genetic code. Therefore, mitochondrial variation or lack thereof can shed little light on their hypothesis. Putting it another way, if
mitochondrial glycyl tRNA genes lacked these features,
this could have been written off as a derived peculiarity of
mitochondria that neither supports nor undermines their
claims.
Authors' response: In response to this criticism, we have separated the analysis for cytoplasmic and organellar tRNAs.
However, although mitochondrial sequences may not tell us
about the origins of tRNA, the fact that the anticodon loop CCA

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/53

is retained in these and chloroplast sequences enforces the argument that this sequence has indeed been 'frozen' in place in
contemporary tRNA sequences: CC due to its fundamental
importance in coding for glycine, and A37 due to its probable
role in strengthening the anticodon-codon interaction through
base stacking [17].
Now surely, the absolute conservation of C35 and C36
nucleotides among glycyl-tRNAs is not surprising since
there are no alternative genetic codes involving glycine.
Authors' response: There are a number of alternative genetic
codes, for example in Candida albicans [38] and the ciliates
Tetrahymena thermophila and Paramecium tetraurelia [39],
not to mention in mitochondrial genomes [37]. Interestingly,
however, in none of these are the GGN glycine codons reassigned to another amino acid, indicating that the assignment of
(N)CC anticodons to glycine has been frozen in place. In fact,
this is true for the entire bottom row of the genetic code table,
which contains codons with the sequence GNN, including the
codons for alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and valine as
well as glycine, all of which are believed to be 'early' amino
acids (see Table 1, left column).
Furthermore, the near universality of A37 among glycyltRNAs is in fact superseded by the overwhelmingly high
incidence of A37 in a majority of tRNA classes in eukarya
and bacteria [15,44]. This so-called cardinal nucleotide
has been discussed by Yarus [45] as playing a role in an
"extended anticodon". Yarus showed that post-transcriptional modifications of A37 (and the minor variant G37)
are correlated in E. coli with anticodon sequence, particularly position 36. This observation was generalized
through sequence analysis to many more species of bacteria by Saks and Conery [44]. Archaea also always have a
purine at this position, although the average frequency of
G37 is much higher [15].
These modified purines at position 37 have a wealth of
well-characterized functions in translation. They are
involved in stabilizing the openness of the anticodon
loop [46], constraining the motional dynamics of the
anticodon stem-loop to better function in codon pairing
[47], and stabilizing the interaction of position 36 with
the first base of the codon [48]. Finally modified purines
at position 37 are important for maintaining translational
reading frame [49].
Do these facts invalidate the author's claims? Not necessarily, for the reasons I outlined above: historically oncearbitrary states of tRNAs may become functionally constrained through co-adaptation of other components of
the translational apparatus. But until somebody demonstrates that translation could equally well have evolved
with other nucleotides, say pyrimidines at the cardinal

position instead of purines (more commonly A), the possibility remains that A37 in glycine is nearly inevitable for
other reasons besides the one that the authors claim.
Putting it another way, an important question is whether
purines at position 37 are exaptations of a frozen accident
or whether only purines could do the jobs they do in
tRNAs.
Authors' response: The fact that only purines could do the job
they do at position 37 in no way invalidates our argument. No
doubt A37 has been 'frozen' in place in contemporary tRNAs
because it provides a compelling functional advantage in stabilizing the anticodon-codon interaction [17]. We believe it must
have been in this position from the beginning, as it would have
been in an anticodon loop formed in the way we have proposed
by the ligation of two hairpins with 3'-CCA termini. Had it not,
the anticodon-codon interaction, and indeed protein synthesis
itself, may not have arisen. It would be hard to overstate the
centrality of the anticodon-codon interaction, which is at the
very heart of the mechanism of protein synthesis. A purine (A
or G) in position 37 is required to stabilize this interaction and,
in fact, enable it to occur. Equally, and as we have commented
in the manuscript, an NCC anticodon was required for the
establishment of the nascent anticodon-codon interaction due
to hydrogen bonding considerations [20]. This can also be seen
in the case of the glycine tRNAs from Staphylococcus aureus
and Staphylococcus epidermidis which have been co-opted for
the role of cell-wall synthesis and are unable to function in
ribosomal protein synthesis [16]: they have a pyrimidine rather
than a purine at position 37. Pertinent to this point, an analysis
of the post-transcriptional modification of N37 is also instructive. It has been proposed that such modification serves to
strengthen anticodon-codon interactions involving weaker A-U
base pairs relative to those involving G-C base pairs [50]. Interestingly, of a set of post-transcriptionally modified tRNAs taken
from three species where the structures of almost all tRNA
sequences with their modifications have been elucidated
(Escherichia coli (bacteria), Haloferax volcanii (archaea) and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (eukaryote cytoplasm)), none of the
nine glycine tRNAs have a modified A37, the lowest proportion
of any tRNA (Additional file 1, part A). It has been suggested
that early tRNA molecules contained no modified nucleotides
[8]. If this is correct, the earliest anticodon-codon interactions
would not have depended on post-transcriptional modification,
with such modification possibly being introduced at a later stage
of genetic code evolution (perhaps with the advent of protein
enzymes) in order to utilize additional codons/amino acids.
Significantly, the glycine tRNAs from the three organisms
described above have the lowest average number (6.2) of posttranscriptionally modified nucleotides in the molecule as a
whole compared with the other tRNAs (Additional file 1, part
B). While the fact that glycine tRNAs have a C at position 36
(the five tRNAs with the lowest proportion of modified N37s all
belong to the bottom row of the genetic code table, meaning they
possess C36) might provide an explanation for an unmodified

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/53

nucleotide at position 37 [45], the relative lack of modification
of the glycine tRNA molecule as a whole can not be explained
on this basis. Despite relying on a slightly different argument,
it suggests that glycine tRNA represents an early tRNA that did
not require extensive post-transcriptional modification to function.
Then what are we left with? I am a bit hungry for further
demonstration of the underlying hypothesis that tRNAs
originated by duplication of a primordial hairpin, ultimately ancestral to both the D and T arms of modern
tRNAs. With this underlying hypothesis strengthened, one
is more likely to consider seriously the authors' claims.
The primordial hairpin duplication origin of tRNAs is a
large and fairly complicated body of literature and I did
not evaluate it exhaustively. I will focus on two papers that
are easiest to understand because they most directly use
well-understood methods: those are Di Giulio [51] and
Widmann et al [3]. Di Giulio [51] used parsimony-based
methods to study the similarity of the 3' and 5' halves of
reconstructed ancestral tRNA sequences. Besides the
intrinsic limitations of the parsimony analysis as noted in
Widmann et al [3], there are biases in ancestral sequence
reconstruction (ASR) with either parsimony or likelihoodbased methods. In fact another study that used ASR to
reconstruct ancestral tRNA sequences found that they did
not even fold properly into the canonical secondary structure [52].
It is worth noting that objections of a quite similar nature
have also been raised about the means by which Jordan et
al [11] reported universal trends in amino acid compositional gain and loss in proteomes, which is cited by the
authors in support of their hypothesis. These objections
were raised by Goldstein and Pollock [53]. Incidentally,
and perhaps in support of the authors, similar claims to
Jordan et al [11] were made using entirely different methods and comparisons by Ivanov [54].
Widmann et al. [3] took an alternative approach to assess
the question of paralogy of the two halves of the tRNA cloverleaf. They compared the distributions of similarity of
actual extant 5' and 3' halves of tRNAs to those expected
from a null model of random tRNAs. My chief objection
to this otherwise excellent approach is that their null
model of random tRNAs (generated by a shuffling procedure) are not filtered or verified to actually fold into a
minimum free energy cloverleaf structure. It is possible
that the requirements of this structure place additional
constraints on sequence variation that would reduce the
significance of their results.
Authors' response: We would agree with the reviewer that
the hairpin duplication origin of tRNA has not been proven, but
we believe it is a credible hypothesis. Problems with phyloge-

netic analysis of tRNA may be due partly to a loss of evolutionary signal across 4 billion years of evolution in what are very
short sequences of RNA [3]. We would also wish to make the
following points:
1. The hairpin duplication theory for the origin of tRNA seems
to us to be based primarily on two separate strands of evidence:
the presence of a canonical intron insertion position between
nucleotides 37 and 38 in the middle of the molecule, at the
position one would expect if indeed tRNA were formed from two
similarly-sized halves; and the experiments of Schimmel et al.
demonstrating that hairpins containing 3'-CCA termini are
able to be specifically aminoacylated by contemporary aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, indicating, in light of the structural relationship between hairpins and the tRNA cloverleaf (see Figure
1) and on the basis of the Principle of Continuity, that such
hairpins were the precursors to tRNA. That these two lines of
evidence so beautifully complement and support each other, we
believe, adds considerable weight to the theory that tRNA originated from the duplication of hairpins that were able to be specifically aminoacylated at their 3'-CCA termini, and perhaps
participated in some form of noncoded protein synthesis.
2. Point 1 notwithstanding, there is some disagreement in the
literature as to whether tRNA was formed from a hairpin duplication or from the ligation of two different hairpins [3]. It
should be noted that the ligation of two identical hairpins is not
actually required for our argument. All that is necessary is that
both hairpins contained 3'-CCA termini, one of which was
incorporated into the nascent anticodon loop at the position we
have proposed. The reason we have discussed the mechanism in
terms of hairpin duplication is that it seems the simplest due to
considerations of symmetry (see Figure 1). As we know, however, nature is not always simple or symmetrical!

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/53

hairpin duplication, and that other specificities arose
from this original activity.
Several lines of evidence would make this argument more
compelling.
First, although CCA is found next to the intron positions
in a majority of tRNA-Gly sequences, this does not necessarily mean that this is the ancestral state. Building a phylogenetic tree of the tRNA sequences and demonstrating
that the earliest-diverging branches have CCA would be
reassuring (i.e. it is necessary to show that the earliestdiverging groups don't retain some rare but ancestral alternative). Rooting the tree is an issue if it is assumed that
other tRNAs branch from within modern tRNA-Gly
sequences, but several methods are available and should
be used.
Authors' response: In response to this helpful critique we
have revised our manuscript to include Figure 3, a phylogenetic
tree of genomic glycine tRNAs. This figure shows that the 18
sequences not containing the anticodon loop CCA sequence are
on isolated branches of the tree rather than spread throughout,
indicating that this is a derived character, although the tree
does not provide evidence of the ancestral glycine tRNA
sequence.

In summary, the ideas in this paper are internally consistent and sound, and pull together many disparate facts. In
my opinion, however, the exclusive evidence for the
authors' specific claims is not overwhelmingly strong, and
more could be done to bolster their claims.

Second, some evidence that tRNA-Gly is the ancestral
tRNA would be helpful. Again, trees could be built with a
sample of tRNAs of different specificities. If other tRNA
specificities branch from within tRNA-Gly, we would
expect standard tests for monophyly on tRNA-Gly
sequences to fail. If, however, tRNA-Gly sequences are
monophyletic and branch from within some other specificity, the hypothesis would not be supported. Again, this
analysis will be complicated by difficulties in rooting and
in building a tree with so few characters, so a negative
result will not be conclusive, but clear patterns, if
obtained, could greatly aid in confirming or disconfirming the hypothesis.

Reviewer 2: Rob Knight, University of Colorado
In this paper, Bernhardt and Tate propose an interesting
new mechanism for the origin of the genetic code from
primordial glycine tRNAs. Although speculative, the
paper suggests that tRNAs might have had a monophyletic
origin from duplication and divergence of tRNA-Gly, primarily because CCA occurs immediately upstream of the
intron in the vast majority of tRNA-Gly sequences examined (this pattern could be due to the inclusion of the terminal CCA in a duplicated hairpin, as has been proposed
by several authors). As Gly is encoded by GGN codons,
this pattern would automatically introduce a glycine anticodon adjacent to the intron position. The authors conclude that glycine was the primordial tRNA, produced by

Authors' response: This has been attempted but without clear
patterns emerging, and so the results have not been included in
the paper. However, some support for glycine tRNA being the
ancestral tRNA has been provided recently by Fujishima et al.
(2008) [55]. Carrying out a phylogenetic/network analysis of
1953 archaeal tRNAs, they found that archaeal glycine tRNA
might represent the ancestral sequence. Although starting from
a different set of suppositions than ours (they believe that the
split tRNA genes of Nanoarchaeum equitans represent the
ancestral state of tRNA, rather than being derived from introncontaining tRNAs as we would argue), they conclude that
'minigenes encoding 5' and 3' tRNA sequence of tRNAGly were
the origins of other tRNA genes in the very early stage of tRNA
evolution'.

Third, some justification for why CC rather than CA
became the first fixed anticodon seems necessary (as both
CC and CA would be present in all sequences duplicating
the terminal CCA). There are several arguments based on
thermodynamics and/or inspection of the canonical
genetic code table that could be advanced here, although
none stands out.
Authors' response: Although we have not included with our
proposal a possible sequence for the first anticodon loop, it
seems reasonable to believe that the CCA sequence has always
been in its current location, with (N)CC in the anticodon position. This is because seven nucleotide loops such as the anticodon loop interact predominantly through the central three
nucleotides [17]; positions 35 and 36 seem to be particularly
important for the strength of the anticodon-codon interaction,
which with CCA in its current position are occupied by 'C's,
providing two strong G-C interactions. Also, (as elaborated in
our responses to the first reviewer), it appears likely that an A
(or G) is required in position 37 in order to stabilize the anticodon-codon interaction by base stacking on the anticodoncodon helix [17]. Therefore CCA in its current position fulfills
two important requirements for enabling a strong intermolecular interaction. In contrast, (C)CA in the anticodon position
would probably have required a modified nucleotide in position
37 in order to stabilize the anticodon-codon interaction (due to
the presence of an 'A' at position 36), as previously discussed.
In the contemporary genetic code the (C)CA anticodon occurs
in tryptophan tRNA, which usually has a modified nucleotide
at position 37 (Additional file 1, part A).
Some minor points
It might be useful to exclude chloroplasts and mitochondria on the grounds that we know these sequences are
derived (from within the cyanobacteria and the alphaproteobacteria respectively), and therefore cannot tell us
about origins. However, examination of these sequences
separately, because they can be rooted with outgroups
from free-living bacteria, could be useful for testing
whether the CCA is maintained by selection in modern
tRNA-Gly sequences.

Authors' response: As already noted, the mitochondrial and
chloroplast data support the argument that the anticodon loop
CCA sequence has been frozen in the vast majority of all glycine
tRNAs. The fact that only 1 of 219 of the glycine tRNA gene
sequences analysed from mitochondria and chloroplasts does
not possess an anticodon CCA demonstrates this sequence has
been maintained in these lineages.
The issue with SELEX against glycine isn't coupling to the
column (indeed, Gly columns are typically used as counterselections in amino acid selections), but rather the
belief that a single H side-chain provides a target that will
be very difficult to bind specifically given the steric issues

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/53

with the linker and any protecting group used for the carboxyl or amine (depending on how the amino acid is coupled to the column).
Authors' response: This point was originally unclear in the
manuscript and has now been modified.
Selections against a Gly column to the exclusion of other
aminoacylated columns are thus not likely to generate
aptamers that bind free Gly in solution with reasonable
specificity. It is possible that this could be worked around
using the Breaker lab's allosteric selection paradigm,
which allows selection of sequences that bind targets free
in solution, although this technique can only isolate very
high-affinity binders that might not be relevant to the
code's origin (much worse Kd's are available through the
affinity chromatography approach). However, to my
knowledge, these experiments have not been attempted.
Reviewer 3: Eugene Koonin, National Center for
Biotechnology Information, NIH
This article proposes a very specific hypothesis on the origin of the first steps in the evolution of the genetic code.
According to Bernhardt and Tate, tRNAGly was the first
tRNA to evolve, and more specifically, it evolved via the
duplication of an RNA hairpin containing a 3'-CCA
sequence and subsequent ligation of the two half-tRNAs
that created the anticodon. The ligation, according to the
hypothesis, was catalyzed by the evolutionary predecessor
of the group I self-splicing intron that is present in the
anticodon loop of tRNAGly. The tRNAGly is supposed to
have given rise to the rest of the tRNAs, presumably, via a
series of duplications – these subsequent steps are not
really discussed in the paper but rather implied by Figure
1.

Authors' response: We have revised the manuscript to
include mention of the evolution of the original glycine tRNA
into tRNAs specific for other amino acids by a process of duplication and mutation.
This may sound harsh but, for the sake of clarity, I will
state my position in straightforward terms: to me, this is
more of a free-wheeling speculation than a useful hypothesis. There are, I believe, three lines of argument marshalled in support of the hypothesis: i) glycine is widely
believed to be one of the first, primordial amino acids, ii)
according to Di Giulio's hypothesis, tRNAs evolved by
duplication of "clover leaf halves", iii) tRNAGly contains a
nearly universally conserved CCA sequence that is located
in the anticodon loop and next to the universal intron
insertion site. The first argument is reasonable but nonspecific and weak; in any case, glycine could not have
been the only primordial amino acid, and it is not at all
clear why tRNAGly should have come first. The second

argument that is presented in the present manuscript
almost as an established fact is only a hypothesis itself,
and not a particularly strong one; again, regardless of its
validity, it says nothing about glycine specifically. The
third argument is central to the article and is the only one
that stems from actual sequence analysis. Unfortunately,
the conservation of this CCA sequence is a simple consequence of the fact that all tRNAGly contain CC in the 2nd
and 3rd positions of the anticodon, and this in turn is a
straightforward consequence of the structure of the
genetic code. Why glycine is encoded by GGX is an interesting question, and the answer may or may not be frozen
accident but there seems to be no connection with the
possible presence of the CCA-OH acceptor sequence in
the primordial hairpin that gave rise to tRNAGly. To me,
this key proposal of the present paper is arbitrary.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/53

number of disparate theories/findings and produces a logical
evolutionary scenario. Rather than being unfalsifiable, subsequent observations or experiments that gave proof that tRNA
did not arise by a hairpin ligation, or that the canonical intron
insertion position is not ancestral, or that glycine was not an
early amino acid would all throw serious doubt on our proposal.
4. We agree with the reviewer that, 'Why glycine is encoded by
GGX is an interesting question', and believe that our hypothesis
offers a plausible explanation.

The problems that, in my view, invalidate this paper are
by no means unique, but rather, common to many ideas
on the origin of life. The problem is extremely hard, and
the temptation to engage in free speculation is strong and
understandable. Unfortunately, this does not provide for
a useful, let alone falsifiable hypothesis.
Authors' response: Our responses to the first reviewer are relevant to the issues raised here. To summarize:
1. We are proposing that the first (glycine) tRNA arose within
an environment containing up to 11 different RNA hairpins,
each aminoacylated with a specific amino acid [4] (Table 1,
middle column). If tRNA has evolved from a single ancestral
molecule, there must have been one that came first. Why glycine tRNA? As previously discussed, a number of theories on the
origin of the genetic code (reviewed and summarized by Trifonov [9]), based on a range of suppositions, place glycine as
the first, or in the first group of amino acids incorporated into
the genetic code (see also [10,11,19,20]).
2. Schimmel's experimental work [4] on aminoacylatable hairpins supports and strengthens Di Giulio's theory of the hairpin
origin of tRNA [1,2,32]. A large number of authors in addition
to Di Giulio have proposed theories of the hairpin origin of
tRNA. Of these, Ohnishi [56], and Nagaswamy and Fox [57],
as well as Di Giulio [32], have proposed a hairpin ligation
model with incorporation of the 3'-CCA terminus of the
upstream hairpin in the anticodon loop of the resultant tRNA,
however at different locations to our proposal.
3. Our finding of a highly conserved CCA sequence in the anticodon loop of 96% of contemporary glycine tRNA genes from
bacteria, archaea and eukaryote cytoplasm forms the crux of our
hypothesis. It seems to us that the presence and precise position
of this sequence provides a possible clue to the identity of the
first tRNA and the origin of the genetic code. Rather than being
arbitrary, we would argue that our theory brings together a
