Abstract
Background: When organismal phylogenies based on sequences of single marker genes are
poorly resolved, a logical approach is to add more markers, on the assumption that weak but
congruent phylogenetic signal will be reinforced in such multigene trees. Such approaches are valid
only when the several markers indeed have identical phylogenies, an issue which many multigene
methods (such as the use of concatenated gene sequences or the assembly of supertrees) do not
directly address. Indeed, even when the true history is a mixture of vertical descent for some genes
and lateral gene transfer (LGT) for others, such methods produce unique topologies.
Results: We have developed software that aims to extract evidence for vertical and lateral
inheritance from a set of gene trees compared against an arbitrary reference tree. This evidence is
then displayed as a synthesis showing support over the tree for vertical inheritance, overlaid with
explicit lateral gene transfer (LGT) events inferred to have occurred over the history of the tree.
Like splits-tree methods, one can thus identify nodes at which conflict occurs. Additionally one can
make reasonable inferences about vertical and lateral signal, assigning putative donors and
recipients.
Conclusion: A tool such as ours can serve to explore the reticulated dimensionality of molecular
evolution, by dissecting vertical and lateral inheritance at high resolution. By this, we mean that
individual nodes can be examined not only for congruence, but also for coherence in light of LGT.
We assert that our tools will facilitate the comparison of phylogenetic trees, and the interpretation
of conflicting data.

Background
Phylogeny in a context of LGT
The Tree of Life has long been a central metaphor of evolutionary theory, and is a useful framework upon which to

build a natural classification. However, understanding the
phylogeny of species from gene trees is a very challenging
task, both technically and conceptually.

First, not all genes are useful phylogenetic markers. Paralogs resulting from gene duplications occurring prior to
the divergence of the organismal lineages being studied
can easily confuse an analysis, as would happen, for
instance, when unknowingly constructing a tree for mammals based on hemoglobin sequences from some species
and myoglobins from others. For different reasons (see
[1] for a detailed review), orthologs themselves must be
scrutinized carefully. Notably, the phylogenetic signal in
genes can be reduced by their limited size, radiative (starlike) evolution they may have undergone or the phenomenon of mutational saturation. Much of the time, the
quality of phylogenetic signal is too low to resolve all of
the problems under consideration in a single analysis.
Multiple gene trees are often then exploited because interestingly, in each gene tree, some nodes may in fact receive
significant support. Increasing the number of markers
might then resolve the full tree, piecemeal. However,
before accepting these individual relationships as solid,
the phylogenetic quality and congruence between markers must also be tested.
Artifacts of tree reconstruction or the use of an inappropriate evolutionary model can lead to robust but artifactual
groupings in gene trees. Recombination events producing
mosaic genes can also blur phylogenetic trees and may
produce controversial groupings. As a consequence, software has been developed to test that the signal carried by
a single gene is not self-contradictory [2,3]. But even nonmosaic orthologs for different genes can be in conflict,
when one of them has been laterally transferred.
This last source of conflicting signal is a major concern. All
living systems from viruses [4] to eukaryotes [5] can participate in the transfer of genetic material. Lateral transfer
occurs within domains of life, but also across domains, for
different markers. There is now broad general agreement
that lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a major force in the evolution of prokaryotes [5-7]. Additional evidence suggests
that gene transfer might also be an important evolutionary mechanism in protist evolution [8]. For instance,
Andersson et al. [9] recently reported that alanyl-tRNA
synthetase had been transferred from Nanoarchaeota to
Diplomonads and Parabasalids. The same authors [10]
showed that LGT has affected both eukaryotes and
prokaryotes with respect to glutamate dehydrogenase.
One may choose to ignore conflicting signal as if it were
noise, even if legitimate evolutionary events underlie it. If
such a choice is made, incompatibilities between different
trees can be resolved by supertree [11-15] or a posteriori
consensus approaches [16]. Supertree methods assemble
an input set of separate phylogenetic trees with shared
taxa into a larger tree [13,17] (or several trees). By fitting
variously supported clades together, they allow large phy-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/27

logenies based on different characters to be constructed
rapidly and have been applied to a broad range of species
[18]. Consensus approaches, such as obtained by concatenating sequences [19] or by averaging over a large number
of genes [20] produce resolved phylogenies by overwhelming noise with signal that is presumed to be systematically congruent and historically true, though weak.
However, if this "noise" is in fact bona fide phylogenetic
signal, then the tree cannot display a historical picture of
evolution: internal nodes do not accurately represent the
evolutionary process. It might be useful in taxonomy,
indeed represent the best possible compromise for taxonomic purposes, but such a graph could do little to satisfy
our understanding of molecular evolution. The averaging
employed by these methods irons over what are perhaps
the most interesting wrinkles.
However, it should still be possible to make progress
towards the deeper goal of understanding genome and
organism history, if we are willing to abandon the formalism of the tree, itself just a convenient metaphor for genealogical relationships. Horizontal inheritance, as
complicated as it is to deal with within the constraints of
the Tree paradigm, is simply a facet within a more realistic
model of genealogy yet to develop fully. SplitsTree [2] and
its kind are excellent at representing this higher dimensionality, though the webs that it draws are still just
graphs of relationships. Little about evolutionary history
can be gleaned from these graphs, though they do suggest
compelling hypotheses.
Here, we are interested in retracing evolutionary history as
much as possible, attending to both the vertical and horizontal axes of inheritance. We do not think that LGT
should be dismissed as noise and discarded in the construction of a phylogeny, but neither do we wish to abandon the concept of vertical inheritance, which by the very
nature of cell division, must be a factor in genealogy, overwhelmingly so in the short term. Instead of forcing each
gene to fit a given model, therefore, our aim is to extract
as much of a gene's phylogenetic information as we can,
vertical and horizontal inheritance modes included, and
cross-reference the information with that obtained from
other genes. We call the resulting graphs syntheses, because
they have both tree-like and web-like parts [21]. In doing
so, we reckon as the supertree users, consensus makers or
concatenation advocates do that recognizing the vertical
backbone of a synthesis graph is an important part of the
task, but nevertheless, just a part of the ultimate goal of
phylogenetics.
Using phylogenetic tree comparison to suggest LGT
This exercise requires an accurate identification of LGT.
Many methods researching similarity/dissimilarity among

Page 2 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:27

genes exist to assess the occurrence of LGT [5,8,22], with
varying reliability. Koski and Golding [23] showed that
best BLAST hits do not necessarily represent the closest
sequence relatives, casting doubt on the reliability of
BLAST based approaches (at least when done naively).
While Daubin et al. [24] showed that, in the bacterial
realm at least, results from genome content and compositional approaches to detect LGT cannot always be taken as
evidence for genetic exchange. In fact, it seems that phylogenetic analysis, even if it is more time consuming and
might fail to detect transfers between more closely related
organisms [5], is still one of the most reliable ways to
investigate LGT [25]. Indeed, observing a close and robust
phylogenetic relationship between gene sequences of distantly related organisms to the exclusion of gene
sequences of more closely related organisms likely indicates LGT [26]. Alternative explanations, still possible a
priori, would be artifacts of tree reconstruction, or complicated cases of reciprocal gene loss.
Highlighting conflicting signal between presumably correct gene trees is necessary in identifying LGT, although
tree comparison is not trivial. Broad comparisons can be
conducted between pairs of trees to determine if they are
significantly different [15,27]. For instance, the incompatibility of different topologies can be assessed by an AU test
for a given gene, using maximum likelihood estimates
[28]. However, such global comparisons only indicate
that there is a disagreement between the history of genes,
not what this disagreement is. An alternative pruning of
selected taxa and subsequent statistical tests of incongruency [29-31] can be attempted to identify the species misplaced in one of the two trees, considering one tree as a
reference. Species to be pruned are generally chosen after
an observation of bootstrap support values [32], as those
robustly located in different parts of the trees under comparison. If the incongruence persists after these taxa have
been removed, those species are then generally not considered responsible for the incompatibility between the
trees. Conversely, if the pruning of species with significantly different locations in the trees eliminates incongruence, then these species could be considered as recipients
of LGT, if no artifact is otherwise suspected of causing
their odd placement in one of the topologies. In practice,
this pruning approach is generally time-consuming and
inefficient, due to the high number of possible pruning
combinations, exacerbated by a possible misinterpretation of results due to taxon-sampling effects.
Recently, Addario-Berry et al. [33] implemented a promising comparison between a reference tree and a gene tree,
overcoming some of these difficulties. Interestingly, their
program posits lateral transfer schemes and scenarios to
rationalize the differences between trees. These evolutionary scenarios, based on LGT, provide an explicit and accu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/27

rate description of possible transfer events. In addition to
the identification of a recipient species, they suggest a
donor species, in the reference tree or outside of it. To do
so, they estimate the minimum number of transfers necessary to explain disagreements between the pair of trees.
This is done using the following criterion: since A and B
are siblings in the gene tree, either the ancestral gene AB
must have been present in the last common ancestor of A
and B in the species tree or a lateral transfer event has
occurred from the A lineage to the B lineage (or vice
versa). At present, this method compares only one gene
tree against the reference tree, and only if they include
exactly the same taxa. In addition, it works only for rooted
directed trees, which unfortunately limits its application.
Notably, the requirement of strictly bifurcating trees forbids the collapse of unsupported nodes, thus greatly exaggerating the difference between trees.
In this paper, we revisit Addario-Berry et al.'s search for
evolutionary scenarios to describe LGT but also insist on
the detection of common vertical features among trees.
We propose a pair of programs for dealing with multiple
phylogenetic tree comparison, against a given reference
tree. These trees may (or may not) differ in their species
content, topological relationships, label positions, bootstrap support, and branch lengths.

Implementation
Horizstory
Comparing trees for two different genes amounts to
exchanging branches within the first genes' tree (editing
it) to match another's, and assessing the relative likelihood of this scenario. The topological comparison of phylogenetic trees is inherently difficult, as the number of
possible edit paths (where one rearranges the branches of
one tree to match another's) increases rapidly with the
number of differences between trees. Where edits are individually independent, they may furthermore occur in any
order within an edit path (evolutionary scenario), thus
exploding their number factorially. Without resorting to
heuristics and its inherent approximations, and without
constraining the types of possible edits (apart from those
that are biologically impossible: LGT with one's ancestor),
we are therefore limited to comparing trees that are relatively similar. However, if one abandons the constraint of
assuming that trees are fully resolved [33], which is most
often not the case, then many apparent differences disappear and the problem becomes more tractable. One
should be concerned with explaining only robust differences between trees, which can be determined by bootstrap support, for example, in ML phylogenies.

It is also important to compare the right trees, which
amounts to a wise choice of reference tree against which
test trees (typically gene-based trees) are compared. A

good reference tree may be one that minimizes the overall
number of differences it finds when matched with a variety of test trees; thus references based on concatenated
sequences, supertrees, or genomic phylogenies should be
most suitable for this purpose. Still, one might be uncertain about the exact choice of reference tree (or its optimal
rooting), where alternatives are equally attractive. One
could then use each candidate reference tree in turn as a
reference against the set of test trees, and measure the
extent of LGT predicted with each choice. This may suggest that one reference tree is better than another in this
context, a result interesting on its own with respect to the
issue of organismal phylogeny and the "true" tree.
Our approach to the comparison of phylogenetic trees,
with the purpose of detecting lateral gene transfer (LGT)
as well as determining the degree of concordance of vertical inheritance relationships, makes use of a recursive procedure
of
consolidation
and
rearrangement.
Consolidation involves the simplification of identical
topological features (vertical inheritance relationships) by
collapsing such features [for example, a triplet-taxon relationship (("A","B"),"C") in common to both trees is collapsed to the single-taxon "((A,B),C)"]. This is followed in
a second step by the collapse of compatible topological
features. A compatible feature is, for example, a relationship of (("A","B"),"C") in the reference tree and an unresolved relationship of ("A","B","C") in the candidate tree,
leading to " [A,B],C]". Compatible features do not necessarily support vertical relationships, but neither do they
provide evidence for lateral gene transfer. Once the pair of
trees to be compared is thus simplified, each of the candidate tree's leaves is moved to every alternative node in its
tree in turn, with each move being tested by consolidation. Where simplification is possible (where the topologies can further converge), the move is productive and
launches another pathway of rearrangement, where further rearrangements and simplifications are tried until the
pair of trees can converge to identity, or until the pathway
is abandoned. A pathway is abandoned, if, for example, it
would require more steps than another pathway already
explored.
We suppose that a rearrangement that can bring a pair of
trees closer to one another topologically, is equivalent to
"undoing" an event of lateral gene transfer. The position
from which a taxon had to be moved in order to make the
trees more similar is taken to be the LGT donor, whereas
the taxon being moved is then the recipient. Given that
rearrangement reconstitutes reference topologies (vertical
inheritance relationships), presumed LGT targets are disqualified from suggesting such relationships by being
pruned from the trees prior to the next recursive
rearrangement.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/27

Last but not least, rearrangement pathways must go to
completion in order to be reported, resulting in full convergence of the pair of trees, but some edit distances are
shorter than others, and suggest a smaller number of LGT
events. For reasons of evolutionary parsimony as well as
computational economy, this conservative route should
be preferred.
Our scenarios can include different kinds of LGT events.
Events of LGT may be nested, or otherwise intertwined,
needing reversal by multiple rearrangements. The clade
founded by an LGT donor may have subsequently had its
species membership obfuscated by later exchanges of
genetic material, yielding an unnatural assemblage of
nomenclatural tags (species labels) in a presumed lineage.
We distinguish such intermediary groupings in our output
using an asterisk, indicating an ambiguity in deducing the
root taxon, that being the actual organism that served as
LGT donor. We also found it necessary to indicate (using
a prime mark) when an LGT event cannot be attributed
directly to a clade found in the reference tree, but rather to
a phantom sister of that clade. This signals a 'basal transfer', which is observed when a taxon migrates out of its
own clade to sit just outside of that clade in the candidate
tree. Since LGT cannot occur with one's ancestor, the best
explanation in a context of LGT is that the taxon received
genetic material from a sister clade which happens not to
be represented among the taxa in the dataset under investigation. Other nomenclatural marks in our program's
output, mentioned above, include the parenthesis indicating an identical topological feature, and the square
bracket indicating a compatible topological feature. The
program's output thus consists of a list of the rearrangement pathways and the consequently deduced vertical
and lateral (LGT) features. The frequencies of these features are also summarized in the output for each the pair
of trees, and a global summary is presented for all pairs of
trees analyzed.
For various reasons, a user might have a collection of trees
to compare that include different taxa, or a user might
more generally wish to exclude specific taxa from certain
individual phylogenetic analyses. Where trees have different complements of taxa, pruning of taxa outside of the
intersection of the two sets is done automatically. Where
a pair of trees includes common taxa that the user wishes
to exclude from analysis explicitly, he or she need only
supply files listing which taxa should be excluded, either
globally (applied to the reference tree and all of the candidate trees), or locally (applied to the reference tree and a
candidate tree on a one-by-one basis). Pruning might be
prescribed if, for example, one suspects causes other than
LGT to be responsible for some of the differences between
a pair of trees, such as long branch attraction. Absence of
such files indicates that no pruning is desired.

We have successfully tested Horizstory with many different sets of real data, including hundreds of trees with 13
species and several dozen trees with over 27 species. Simple and nested LGTs simulated by manual modifications
of a reference tree were also correctly reported in the
scenarios.
Lumbermill
Lumbermill is a phylogeny editor, written in Java, for
drawing trees and syntheses, using Horizstory output as
input. It realizes our notion of synthesis (see Fig. 2) by
first representing a vertical phylogram as its backbone.
Line thickness is drawn in proportion to the percentage of
genes supporting a given grouping; common patterns of
vertical inheritance are thus easy to identify. (The assumption here is that over the short term, vertical inheritance is
the dominant pattern). Overlaid onto this backbone are
links that represent presumed LGTs, completing the
synthesis.

The images trees or syntheses are highly editable, allowing
the user to change fonts and line colours to provide a customized view of the data. The order of a node's descendants can be swapped. The backbone can be rerooted on
another node or even unrooted. To help describe events in
the synthesis, nodes are labeled numerically by distance
from the root then alphabetically from top to bottom. In
addition to this, each link is interactive, and when clicked
on, displays information such as the proportion of genes
inherited along this link, and their names.
Often, multiple equally parsimonious LGT scenarios are
proposed by Horizstory in order to explain differences
between a given gene tree and the reference topology.
Lumbermill allows the user to restrict the display of individual LGT events to those suggested by a specified minimum fraction of the scenarios, such as 1.0 (strict
consensus) or values greater than 0.5 (majority rule). One
can also elect to omit the display of specific LGTs for some
genes in Lumbermill, such as when the conflicting signal
involving this gene is found to be due to some cause other
than lateral gene transfer.
Putative LGT events are drawn as arrows originating from
a donor (indicated by a circle) and terminating at a recipient. Since the exact time at which a transfer occurred cannot be determined, the relative order of multiple arrows
on any given segment is irrelevant, as is the position of an
arrow on the segment. In order to avoid clutter in busy
regions of the tree, we chose to extend segments to provide more room. Such artificially extended segments are
drawn as dotted lines so as not to confuse them with
actual branch lengths (solid lines).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/27

When genes have apparently been inherited from a taxon
missing from the reference tree, we insert a basal group in
the tree where appropriate. This donor, a contemporary
clade absent from the current dataset and that may or may
not have since gone extinct, collects all of the LGT events
originating from outside of a represented clade. It is
meant as a convenient catchall, and where multiple LGTs
appear to originate from such a given basal group, it is
understood that different donors may actually have contributed genes independently.
Our method allows for nested LGT scenarios, where a
compound donor in the evolutionary scenario for a gene
is not represented as an organismal clade in the reference
tree. In this case, one cannot therefore point to an actual
donor for the gene at this intermediary step in the scenario, since its identity is ambiguous, appearing to parent
species from different clades. Lumbermill deals with such
organismal assemblages by indicating several candidate
donors all leading to the same target. It is assumed that
the LGT event in question involved a single donor parenting one or more species in this assemblage, or when a
basal group is also indicated, a single donor related to the
parent of one or more of the species in the assemblage.
These LGT involving such intermediate assemblages are
represented using a double-headed arrow.

Results
We provide an example for four genes of the gamma-proteobacterial core compared with the gamma-proteobacterial species tree [34], deduced from a simultaneous study
of 205 genes by Lerat et al. (Our previous critique of this
tree [21] was focused on its statistical support, not its biological reasonableness). In order to illustrate the workings
of Horizstory on a simple example, Figure 1 displays the
analysis of a tree for the virulence factor MviN against this
proposed gamma-proteobacterial species tree. The two
steps required to transform the MviN tree into one compatible with the reference tree are in fact equivalent in the
two scenarios shown (differing only in hypothetical intermediates), and can thus be represented more simply in
the user-interface layer of our software, Lumbermill,
described above.
Among their 205 markers, Lerat et al. [34] identified two
proteins, the virulence factor MviN and the biotin synthase BioB, for which the position of Pseudomonas aeruginosa conflicted with the species tree. Our example (Fig. 2)
includes these two genes, with two more randomly chosen from among the remaining 203 of Lerat et al.'s set: a
putative ORF and N6-adenine-specific methylase. It
shows that some but not all recent divergences are reasonably supported by the set of four genes that contributed to
this synthesis (e.g., the monophyly of the endosymbionts

thickness of an internal branch corresponding to the frequency of its support across the whole dataset. Putative LGT events
are in orange, connecting donors (circles) with recipients (arrowheads); where there are multiple possible donor candidates,
these converge onto a double arrowhead (see text). Where the apparent donor of a gene falls outside of the taxa included in
the analysis, one is created as a basal group taxon, indicated in light blue. In order to avoid graphical congestion, branches in the

example, displays the following message: 3A: set006r, branch length:0.03755, thickness:0.25, files supported: mvin.tre:2/2,
where support for the node is 2/2 for mvin.tre (both edit paths support the node), and 0 (unsupported) for hypoprot.tre,

thick link), whereas deeper nodes are generally not so well
supported, suggesting that this reference tree is not robust.
This is consistent with the fact that mutational saturation
of molecular sequences contributes to the erasure of phylogenetic information as time progresses [35], and several
reports indicate that even with large amounts of data, the

resolution of deep phylogenies will continue to be elusive
[36,37].
Lumbermill displays both the support for a clade as well
as the putative shuffling of genes with other clades, and
can therefore begin to address this issue. For instance,

Estimate of genomic mosaicism. This application screenshot displays a table indicating the degree of vertical and of horizontal
inheritance inferred for each node in the synthesis (see Fig. 2). The middle two columns of the table summarize the distribution
of vertical (blue) and of lateral (orange) support for the segment immediately preceding each node, and the vertical and lateral
support for the whole string of segments leading to a particular node, respectively. For example, B. aphidicola shows a 14%
degree of accumulated mosaicism since the tree's root (from the small sample of genes used in this analysis), but no recent
mosaicism (in the segment preceding its divergence from W. glossinidia, node 5A). Numerical values for the proportions are

Figs. 1 and 2 show that the ancestor of enterobacteria (represented by Y. pestis, E. coli, S. enterica, B. aphidicola and W.
glossinidia) acquired its copy of MviN from a sister group
of the gamma-proteobacteria by LGT, and subsequently
the non-endosymbiotic enterobacteria donated this gene
to P. aeruginosa. Fig. 2 also shows that a copy of BioB was

influenzae.

synthesis. The information is displayed in two columns:
the first represents lateral transfer occurring since the previous node only, while the second shows a cumulative
estimate of all LGTs since the origin. Such summaries can
address the issue relating phylogenetic distance with propensity for exchange, known to exist within "species"
[41,42] and postulated for larger clades [43,44].

Conclusion
Many estimates, described in the help file of Lumbermill
(available online), are also implemented in Lumbermill
to help investigate the distribution of the phylogenetic
signal in the synthesis, to get information about the processes of LGT and a rough description of genetic mosaicism
by node, as presented in Fig. 3. This last feature of Lumbermill addresses concerns raised by important publications [38-40], describing organisms as chimerae.
Although a tree-like framework can still be appropriate to
relate species for which no mosaicism is detected, a web
[2] or a synthesis such as ours is required where mosaicism is evident. Fig. 3 displays the relative proportion of
vertical inheritance (in blue) and of lateral transfer (in

Horizstory and Lumbermill constitute a pair of phylogenetic tools to compare multiple trees, and to display this
comparison in a useful and flexible format. The software
is freely available to the community and downloadable
from http://coffee.biochem.dal.ca, and it will continue to
be built upon in order to add further summary analyses.
Already, we believe that they provide important information to the evolutionary biologist such as the frequency
and direction of putative LGT events. We also gain information on the number of lateral exchanges undergone by
each gene, the uniqueness of the LGT event (a unique
event generates a thin horizontal link) or the fact that
some species exchanged multiple genes on a regular basis

(thick horizontal lines). Finally, we can assess the robustness of a tree's backbone. One could use these analyses in
order to explore the evolution of phylogenetic signal and
the relative power of phylogenetic methods to solve a
given taxonomic issue. By proposing specific LGT events,
our system may furthermore bracket the temporal coexistence of lineages, given that LGT can only occur between
contemporary species. Otherwise, one cannot know much
about the temporal coincidence of anything but extant
species, where fossil evidence is lacking. This may be combined with ecological and biogeochemical hypotheses,
and thereby help to understand the propagation of biological innovation throughout evolutionary time.

100%), but the reference tree need not include such information. Our method requires trees to be rooted, but can
deal with multifurcated trees.

whether or not the node should be collapsed. For example, a weak feature (A,B) below threshold in ((A,B),C) collapses to (A,B,C).

*Project name: Horizstory and Lumbermill
*Project home page: http://coffee.biochem.dal.ca/ (all
programs and test files alternatively available from EB
upon request)
*Operating system(s): Platform independent (Horizstory
requires a command line interface)
*Programming languages: Horizstory – C++, Lumbermill
– Java
*Other requirements: C++ Compiler (Horizstory), Java
1.4.0 or higher (Lumbermill)
*License: Horizstory – GNU GPL, Lumbermill – none
*Any restrictions to use by non-academics: Horizstory –
none, Lumbermill – none
note: Horizstory was designed and tested using gcc 3.3,
available at http://gcc.gnu.org/

-r: The index, within the listOfTreeFiles, of the reference
tree's file. The reference tree is assumed to be topologically
resolved and rooted; where the user wishes an unresolved
feature (a multifurcation) within the reference tree, a
branch length of 0.0 can be specified. Bootstrap values
may or may not be present in the tree; if present they are
ignored unless 0, which again serves to collapse a node.

-t: When trees are quite different, many pathways of rearrangement might be found that can transform a candidate
tree into a topology compatible with the reference tree. In
some of these pathways, exotic LGT events might be proposed that are not proposed by the majority of other pathways. This parameter, therefore, allows one to limit the
summary output of the program to LGT that are suggested
by at least a certain fraction of the pathways, e.g. 0.1.
-bias: One may wish to minimize or to maximize proposed events of LGT involving nested groups or basal
groups. The analysis is first done to minimize the length
of a rearrangement scenario, but then the output can be
filtered by one of the following options if desired.
n: consider paths with the minimum number of nested
groups, from among the set of shortest edit paths.

Application details
Whereas Lumbermill has an intuitive graphical user interface, Horizstory is a command-line C++ program whose
options we describe below. Its signature is:

np: consider paths with the minimum number of nested
groups, and of those, with the minimum number of phantom sisters.

HorizStory -f listOfTreeFiles -r indexOfReferenceTree -m
minimumBootstrap [-t fractionThreshold] [-bias twoLetterCode] [-s timeLimitPerTreeInSeconds] [-v]

nP: consider paths with the minimum number of nested
groups, and of those, with the maximum number of
phantom sisters.

where square brackets indicate optional parameters; the
default fraction threshold is 0.0, the default bias is none,
the default time limit is 86400 s (1 day), and the default
verbose mode (the -v option) is false.

N: consider paths with the maximum number of nested
groups.

-f: Names a file that first specifies the number of entries
(e.g., 7), then specifies that number of file names, representing a reference tree and trees to be tested against it, in

-s: The user may specify a time limit for the analysis of
each tree, in seconds. Tests on pairs of randomly generated trees indicate that processing time is exponential,

...and so on (Np, NP, p, pn, pN, P, Pn and PN).

O(cn), with the number of differences in the trees after initial consolidation, n, with c = 6.1, and on our test system
(a 2.0-GHz PowerPC G5), with O being approximately
1.5 µs. Where a pair of trees must be compared, but the
required time is prohibitive, the user may opt to increase
the minimum bootstrap (-m) requirement, in order to
compare only the most resolved portions of the trees.
-v: When specified, this parameter enables verbose output
to the terminal window. It does not affect the output
printed to file.
"Pruning files" are given the identical name of the referenceTree, but appended with ".pru", for global prunings, or
are given the identical name of a candidate tree
(appended with ".pru") for local prunings. The file specifies the number of taxa to be pruned, followed by that
number of taxon names.

Authors' contributions
EB originated the study and provided critical feedback to
DM, who implemented Lumbermill, and to RLC, who
implemented Horizstory. WFD contributed to the writing
