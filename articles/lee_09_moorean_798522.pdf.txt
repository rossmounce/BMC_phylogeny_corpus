Abstract
Background: The mass extirpation of the island of Moorea's endemic partulid tree snail fauna,
following the deliberate introduction of the alien predator Euglandina rosea, represents one of the
highest profile conservation crises of the past thirty years. All of the island's partulids were thought
to be extirpated by 1987, with five species persisting in zoos, but intensive field surveys have
recently detected a number of surviving wild populations. We report here a mitochondrial (mt)
phylogenetic estimate of Moorean partulid wild and captive lineage survival calibrated with a
reference museum collection that pre-dates the predator's introduction and that also includes a
parallel dataset from the neighboring island of Tahiti.
Results: Although severe winnowing of Moorea's mt lineage diversity has occurred, seven of eight
(six Partula; two Samoana) partulid tip clades remain extant. The extinct mt clade occurred
predominantly in the P. suturalis species complex and it represented a major component of
Moorea's endemic partulid treespace. Extant Moorean mt clades exhibited a complex spectrum of
persistence on Moorea, in captivity, and (in the form of five phylogenetically distinct sister lineages)
on Tahiti. Most notably, three Partula taxa, bearing two multi-island mt lineages, have survived
decades of E. rosea predation on Moorea (P. taeniata) and in the valleys of Tahiti (P. hyalina and P.
clara). Their differential persistence was correlated with intrinsic attributes, such as taxonomy and
mt lineages, rather than with their respective within-island distribution patterns.
Conclusion: Conservation efforts directed toward Moorean and Tahitian partulids have typically
operated within a single island frame of reference, but our discovery of robust genealogical ties
among survivors on both islands implies that a multi-island perspective is required. Understanding
what genetic and/or ecological factors have enabled Partula taeniata, P. hyalina and P. clara to
differentially survive long-term direct exposure to the predator may provide important clues
toward developing a viable long term conservation plan for Society Island partulid tree snails.

Background
Oceanic islands have never been connected to continental
landmasses and receive their terrestrial biotas solely
through trans-oceanic dispersal and subsequent in situ
diversification [1]. Hot spot archipelagoes, in particular,
are fecund cladogenic settings, and these chronologically
arrayed island chains frequently accumulate species-rich
endemic radiations that are of exceptional interest to evolutionary biologists [2-4]. Because they have evolved in
isolation, endemic island species often lack highly developed defensive or competitive abilities [5-7], and this
renders them exceptionally vulnerable to introduced continental competitors and predators [1,8,9].
One of the most pronounced recent cases of oceanic
island mass extirpation has involved the rapid extinction
in the wild of the large majority of the 61 described
endemic Society Islands partulid tree snails (4 Samoana
and 57 Partula species) following the deliberate introduction of the alien carnivorous land snail Euglandina rosea
[10-13]. The rationale for the introduction was a biological control program aimed at another alien mollusc, the
giant African land snail, Lissachatina fulica, and the predator was released on Tahiti in 1974, on Moorea in 1977,
and on other Society Islands in the 1980s and 1990s [14].
Euglandina rosea's devastating effect on non-target Society
Island endemic tree snail populations is best documented
for the island of Moorea [10,15]. Within a decade, all 9
Moorean partulids (7 Partula and 2 Samoana species) were
deemed extirpated, but prescient interventions led to the
successful establishment of off-island captive populations
for most of the island's Partula species in international
zoos and universities [15-17]. Five endemic Moorean Partula species (P. taeniata, P. suturalis, P. tohiveana, P. mooreana and P. mirabilis) have been successfully maintained in
captivity for over two decades by The Partulid Global Species Management Programme, and two species (P. exigua
and P. aurantia) are extinct [13]. No captive populations
exist for Society Island Samoana species. In 1994, an experimental reestablishment of captive-reared P. taeniata, P.
suturalis and P. tohiveana was attempted by releasing them
into a 20 × 20 m2 predator-proof snail field reserve erected
in a Moorean valley. However, field maintenance issues
led to repeated predator incursions and the experiment
was terminated in 1998 [18].
The loss of the Society Island's endemic tree snails is compounded by their scientific prominence as the subject of
classic studies in zoology, population biology and evolutionary genetics for over a century [19-24]. Moorean Partula spp., in particular, were the focus of much of this
research, and have been intensively studied by B. Clarke,
J. Murray, M. Johnson and their associates over a number
of decades. The resulting picture is a complicated one in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/204

which six of the seven morphologically and ecologically
well-defined Moorean species collectively formed two
species complexes: 1) P. taeniata and P. exigua; 2) P.
suturalis, P. tohiveana, P. mooreana and P. aurantia. The seventh species, P. mirabilis, could hybridize with either complex [22]. Moorean Partula spp. showed a potential for
gene flow, either directly or indirectly, among all seven
taxa, resulting in a lack of concordance among morphology, molecules and degree of reproductive isolation [2528].
All Moorean partulid species were thought to be extirpated in the wild by 1987 [15] and, until recently, it
looked as if Society Island partulids would survive only in
captivity [13]. However, intensive on-going field surveys
have detected scattered relict populations on a number of
islands, including seven on Moorea. A relict Moorean
population of Samoana attenuata has been monitored
since 1996 by C. Hickman, and this species also persists
on Tahiti [14,29] and on Raiatea [30]. Six surviving populations of the Moorean endemic Partula taeniata have been
detected since 2000. This latter species was formerly distributed throughout the island and exhibited regional variation in shell phenotype [31], allozyme profile [32] and
mitochondrial (mt) genetic structure [25,27].
The primary goal of our study was to assess genealogically
the remnant wild Moorean partulid populations by placing them in a phylogeographic framework. A single island
phylogenetic perspective is insufficient because Samoana
attenuata has a multi-island distribution [33] and Partula
taeniata contains divergent mt lineages that collectively
form robust taxonomically polyphyletic clades with different subsets of Moorean and Tahitian congeners
[25,34]. Moorea and Tahiti are neighboring islands separated by a mere 17 km of ocean. They are the largest members of the Society Island archipelago's eastern
"Windward Islands/Iles du Vent" sub-group and support
all of the sub-group's partulid populations. Moorea is the
older of the two, and allozyme and morphological analyses have identified it as the source of Tahiti's Partula species [35], although there may have been some backmigration from Tahiti to southern Moorea [26]. Our goal
therefore was to build a combined Moorean/Tahitian
phylogeny that incorporated extant wild populations,
extant captive populations and historical museum samples, the latter collected by J.B. Burch in 1970, prior to the
introduction of Euglandina rosea.
A recent phylogenetic study of Tahitian wild, captive and
historical museum tree snails found that at least some
members of all five primary historical Tahitian Partula mt
clades remain extant, primarily in montane refuge populations [36]. This result was somewhat unexpected, given
that three of Tahiti's eight Partula species are extinct [13].

However, Society Island partulid taxonomic designations
are predominantly conchological [20,21], and they are
often poorly-corroborated by molecular markers,
although this is further complicated by incongruence
among genetic marker sets [25-28,36,37]. In this present
study, we were particularly interested in testing for cryptic
genealogical links among surviving Windward Island partulid populations on Moorea and on Tahiti. Our results
show that although much of Moorea's tree snail mitochondrial diversity (including one of the primary tip
clades) has been lost, a surprisingly representative genealogical sub-sample collectively persists in captivity, in the
wild on Moorea and, in the form of five phylogenetically
distinct sister lineages, on Tahiti.

Results and discussion
Windward Island Overview
Combining our novel data (82 distinct haplotypes from
161 snails) with preexisting mt COI datasets [30,36,37]
produced a total Windward Island genotyped partulid
sample size of 457 snails. Although this malacofauna has
experienced extreme extinction pressure in recent decades,
access to museum and captive specimens enabled us to
incorporate genotypes from six extinct species (three
Moorean) as well as from the five extirpated species (four
Moorean) that persist in captivity [13]. Consequently, we
have almost complete nominal species taxonomic representation: 16 out of the 17 Windward Island taxa listed in
a recent study [13] in addition to the endemic Tahitian
Samoana burchi. The missing species, Partula cytherea, has
not been seen since its 1920's discovery on a remote Tahitian interior mountain slope [38] and it is now presumed
extinct [13].

Figure 1 gives an overview of the Windward Island partulid mt COI phylogeny recovered. The most trenchant topological feature was the well-supported reciprocal
monophyly of Samoana and Partula taxa, which corroborated numerous lines of anatomical [33,39], allozymic
[35,40] and nuclear rDNA [41,42] evidence of their distinctiveness. In the Partula clade, the basal Windward
Island lineages were exclusively Tahitian, and the Moorean haplotypes formed six tip clades, three of which
(Moorea 1–3) contained the large majority of the island's
haplotypic diversity and occupied the most derived portion of Windward Island tree space (Figure 1). The
remaining three Moorean tip clades (Moorea 4–6) were
interspersed with Tahitian lineages, and two of them
formed robust exclusive sister relationships with Tahitian
tip clades: Moorea 4 and Tahiti 5; Moorea 5 and Tahiti 1.
The most robust internal stem branch supported approximately half of the Partula clade treespace (Moorea 1–4;
Tahiti 5) and, with the exception of P. nodosa (Tahitian
clade 3; [36]), its taxonomic composition was consistent
with Murray et al's [25] most common Windward Island

Partula mt RFLP genotype (A). The absence of major
clades exclusive to captive and wild samples (Figure 1)
implied that the reference museum collection may be
broadly representative of pre-collapse 1970 Moorean Partula mt diversity. Nevertheless, two divergent extant haplotypes (one from a wild P. taeniata on the summit of Mt.
Tohiea; the other from a captive P. s. vexillium sampled in
Fareaito) lack 1970 phylogenetic matches (Figure 1).
Detailed discussion of each Moorean tip clade follows
below.
Moorean Clade 1
Figure 2 gives a fine-scale view of Moorean Clade 1, showing the taxonomic identity and the geographic origin of
each constituent snail genotyped for mt COI. Focusing
first on Moorean haplotypes, this clade was taxonomically
polyphyletic, but in a topologically structured manner.
Derived Moorean lineages, comprising approximately
80% of this clade's topology, were exclusively composed
of Partula taeniata (widely distributed across the island)
and P. exigua (Figure 2). These two species readily hybridize under laboratory conditions [22] and collectively form
the P. taeniata species complex [23]. Clade 1 basal lineages
were sourced from the south central part of the island and
most were obtained from P. mooreana and P. tohiveana,
both members of the P. suturalis species complex [23].
This basal segment of Clade 1 treespace was broadly congruent with the P. taeniata/P. mooreana/P. tohiveana mt
Cytochrome B clade previously recovered from many of
the same southern localities [34]. Although P. exigua is
extinct, P. taeniata Moorean Clade 1 lineages persist both
in captivity and in three central/south island wild populations: Haumi and Maatea valleys, as well as on upper
slopes of Mt. Tohiea (Figure 2). Basal Clade 1 lineages of
P. mooreana and P. tohiveana survive only in captivity but
a remnant wild P. taeniata population persists in Morioahu valley (Figure 2).

Moorean Clade 1 lineages initially appeared to be
restricted to that island because no constituent haplotypes
had been encountered in Lee et al's [36,37] extensive genotyping of Tahitian wild, captive and historical museum
tree snails. However, four Tahitan snails from a recently
discovered extant population of Partula clara in Tiapa Valley (unsampled by Burch in 1970) all shared a haplotype
that surprisingly nested firmly within Moorean Clade 1,
sister to a Moorean Puutu Valley population of P. exigua
(Figure 2). Crampton recognized the Tiapa (Aoua, in his
terminology) Valley population as a distinct subspecies, P.
clara incrassa, stating that it was extraordinarily distinct
from nominal conspecifics in adjacent valleys in that it
had longer thinner shells, peculiar color morphs including
unique banded mutants, thinner shells and lips and some specimens with a trace of a pillar tooth [20]. Our extant wild
Tiapa Valley snails are conchologically indistinguishable

from Crampton's voucher specimens of P. c. incrassa (see
Additional File 1) and the haplotype they carry is phylogenetically distinct from all other Tahitian partulids (Figure 1), including members of the primary P. clara/hyalina
clade in adjacent valleys [37]. Snails bearing Moorean
Clade 1 mitochondria therefore appear to have established a discrete founder population in this Tahitian valley, where they now represent the only surviving partulids
(T. Coote pers. observ.), and this clade remains tenuously
extant on both Moorea (P. taeniata) and Tahiti (P. c.
incrassa), as well as in captivity.
Moorean Clade 2
Prior to the introduction of Euglandina rosea, three Moorean species (Partula taeniata, P. suturalis and P. mirabilis)
had two areas of sympatry, the smaller occurring on the
Mt. Rotui Peninsula [22,23]. We obtained a well-supported and phylogenetically distinctive mt clade (Moorea
Clade 2) from a sub-sample of 1970 Mt. Rotui Peninsula
(Matapoopoo Valley) P. mirabilis and P. taeniata specimens (Figure 3). This polyphyletic result was unsurprising
because P. mirabilis can hybridize with both P. taeniata
and P. suturalis species complexes [22]. Moorean Clade 2
appears to have been restricted to the Mt. Rotui Peninsula
(Figure 3) and was not represented in the captive populations, none of which were sourced there. However, this mt
lineage remains precariously extant; five biopsies from a
nearby surviving population of P. taeniata, discovered by
C. Hickman in 2002, all produced a Clade 2 haplotype
(Figure 3). These survivors persist in an unusual mangrove
fern micro-habitat fringing Opunohu Bay, exhibit a variety of shell-color morphs, and may be protected from Euglandina rosea incursions by a brackish water moat (C.
Hickman unpubl. observ.).
Moorean Clade 3
This major endemic Moorean clade was recovered from
11 out of 13 Burch 1970 sampling stations and was
present in high frequencies in central and eastern parts of
the island (Figure 4). Moorean Clade 3 was almost exclusively (36/40 snails) composed of P. suturalis (including
nominal subspecies) and P. aurantia, both members of the
P. suturalis species complex [23,32] that readily hybridized in the laboratory [22]. The other Clade 3 taxon consisted of four Matapoopoo Valley specimens of Partula
mirabilis propinqua [22], two of which shared a haplotype
with Puutu Valley P. suturalis specimens (Figure 4). A
notable feature of this clade was the conspicuous absence
of P. mooreana and P. tohiveana, the remaining two members of the P. suturalis species complex [23]. They placed
instead within Moorean Clade 1, together with members
of the P. taeniata species complex (Figure 2; [34]). It may
be pertinent that P. mooreana and P. tohiveana showed little or no ability to hybridize with P. suturalis under laboratory
conditions
[22].
Those

incompatibilities, coupled with their observed mt phylogenetic distinctiveness (Figures 2, 4; [34]), undermine the
case for inclusion of P. mooreana and P. tohiveana in the P.
suturalis species complex.
Both Partula aurantia and P. m. propinqua are now presumed extinct. Two P. suturalis subspecies survive in captivity. They were originally sourced from one central
valley (P. s. vexillum: Fareaito; see topological placement
in Figure 1) and two southern valleys (P. s. vexillum: Vaianai; P. s. strigosa: Maatea), but none of the genotyped captive specimens bore Moorean Clade 3 mt lineages (Figure
4). It would appear that Moorean Clade 3, a major
endemic component of the island's historical partulid mt
tree space, may well be extinct.
Moorean Clade 4
Eight individuals of Partula taeniata nucleola sampled from
a northwestern Moorean valley (Faatoai) by J. B. Burch in
1970 all carried a haplotype (Moorean Clade 4; Figure 5)
that was phylogenetically divergent from all other genotyped Moorean museum and captive partulids, including
captive P. t. nucleola sourced from that same valley (Moorean Clade 1; Figures 1, 2). Goodacre also recovered two
divergent P. taeniata mt haplogroups from independent
historical Faatoai Valley samples [27]. One haplogroup
was relatively rare in Faatoai, but widespread throughout
the island, as is Moorean Clade 1 (Figure 2); the other was
predominant in western valleys, including Faatoai and
Moruu [27]. A newly discovered remnant Moruu Valley
population of P. taeniata provided the first Moorean phylogenetic match to the Burch 1970 P. t. nucleola lineage
(Moorean Clade 4; Figure 5). We therefore consider it
likely that our Moorean Clade 4 and Goodacre's P. taeniata western haplogroup [27] both represent the same lineage and that, though absent from captive populations, it
still remains extant in Moruu Valley.

Viewed from a single-island perspective, Moorean Clade 4
seems relatively unimportant: it lacks on-island sister lineages, represents a minor component of the island's historical partulid mt tree space, had a restricted original
distribution and is not represented in captive populations
(Figures 1, 5; [27]). However, taking a multi-island perspective revealed these Moorean Partula taeniata mt lineages to be part of a larger mt clade with a substantial
Windward Island, and regional archipelagic distribution.
Moorean Clade 4 has a robust and exclusive sister relationship with a major Tahitian mt lineage comprising two
nominal species, Partula hyalina and P. clara (Tahitian
Clade 5; Figures 1, 5; with the exception of the Tiapa Valley population of P. c. incrassa, Figure 2). Tahitian P.
hyalina and P. clara snails have also proven to be differentially resistant to Euglandina rosea predation. Although
these two nominal taxa collectively represented only circa

Tahitian haplotypes were recovered from genotyped

extant wild and captive Tahitian P. hyalina and P. clara
snails and also from extant P. hyalina anthropogenic
founder populations in the Cook and Austral Islands, two
neighboring hot spot archipelagoes (Figure 5; [36,37]).

phylogenetically-distinctive mt lineage (Moorea 4 + Tahiti
5) therefore survive tenuously in the presence of Euglandina rosea on Moorea and on Tahiti and thrive in its
absence on the Cook and Austral archipelagoes (Figure 5;
[37]).
Moorean Clade 5
A second phylogenetically-distinct Moorean mt lineage
(Moorean Clade 5) with a robust Tahitian sister clade was
recovered from museum samples of Partula suturalis vexillium and from museum and captive samples of P. mirabilis, all sourced from northwest/central valleys (Figure 6).
The P. s. vexillium snails from the northwestern valley Faatoai placed firmly in Moorean Clade 5 (Figure 6), unlike
their Moorean Clade 3 conspecifics sampled across the
northcentral and northeast of the island (Figure 4). Moorean Clade 5 museum samples also contained P. mirabilis
from both of its geographically-disjunct [22] populations:
Mt. Rotui (Matapoopoo Valley) and central Moorea
(Mouaroa Valley). Murray and Clarke found that both P.
mirabilis populations hybridized readily [22], and this is
consistent with our finding of a very close mt phylogenetic
association among this taxon's Matapoopoo and
Mouaroa clade 5 snails (Figure 6). Nevertheless, it should
be kept in mind that the Matapoopoo P. mirabilis 1970
sample was highly heterogeneous in its mt lineage com-

position. It also contained snails with Moorean Clade 2
haplotypes (Figure 3; shared with P. taeniata) as well as P.
m. propinqua individuals bearing Moorean clade 3 haplotypes (Figure 4; shared with P. suturalis and P. aurantia).
These results corroborate Murray and Clarke's view [22] of
P. mirabilis as a species that could hybridize with both P.
taeniata and P. suturalis species complexes.
Moorean Clade 5 is now apparently extirpated in the wild,
but a constituent haplotype survives in a captive P. mirabilis population, originally sourced from Fareaito Valley
(Figure 6). Taking a multi-island perspective, Moorean
Clade 5 is part of a larger and phylogenetically-distinctive
Windward Island mt lineage that incorporates an exclusive Tahitian sister clade: Tahiti 1 (Figures 1, 6; [36]) and
that collectively has a taxonomic composition consistent
with Murray et al's [25] mt RFLP genotype "P". Tahiti
Clade 1 contained two nominal species, P. affinis and P.
otaheitana, had an island-wide distribution, and two
known populations persist: P. affinis in captivity and a
remnant montane population of P. otaheitana on Mt.
Atara (Figure 6; [36]). Unlike the two other nested Moorean/Tahitian Partula spp. clades (Figures 2, 5), snails
bearing this multi-island mt lineage appear incapable of
surviving in Windward Island valleys in the presence of
Euglandina rosea.

Murray et al. [25] found that southern Moorean populations of Partula suturalis had a highly distinctive mtDNA
RFLP genotype that differed markedly from conspecific
northern populations. Our limited sampling of southern
P. suturalis confirmed this result. We recovered a divergent
tip clade (Moorea Clade 6; Fig 7) from captive lines of two
subspecies sourced from Maatea and Vaianai Valleys,
together with a single P. s. strigosa snail sampled in 1970
from Hotutea Valley (Figure 7). The other four 1970
Hotutea P. s. strigosa individuals genotyped from that
same sampling station (276) placed in Moorean Clade 3

that S. attenuata survives on Moorea and that all three taxa

phyletic, including the multi-island taxa; Figure 8). Samoana and Partula lineages therefore appear to have
experienced quite distinct patterns of cladogenesis in the
Windward Islands and, post Euglandina rosea introduction, they also have experienced differential patterns of
extirpation and survival. This is a particularly interesting
result, given that these three taxa were originally much
scarcer than co-occurring Partula species in the Society
Islands [33].

primary clades) and among the two islands, apart from a
small number of relatively minor issues such as the presence of the Tahitian species Partula nodosa within the primary Windward Island mt RFLP lineage [25]. We are
therefore confident that our historical reference Moorean
dataset probably contains the primary Moorean lineages
and that it can be used to assess what fraction of the
island's endemic mt treespace has survived in captivity
and/or in the wild.

Summary discussion

Our Windward Island dataset yields a novel, and somewhat complex, multi-island genealogical perspective on
Moorean partulid survival. Only one of eight historical
Moorean partulid tip clades (six Partula spp.; two Samoana
spp.) is extinct. Unfortunately, the extinct lineage (Moorea Clade 3) encompassed the bulk of the P. suturalis species complex, and lacked Tahitian sister lineages (Figures
1, 4). The seven extant clades exhibited a heterogeneous
spectrum of persistence: on Moorea, in captivity and also
on Tahiti (Moorean Clade 1); on Moorea, with sister lineages on Tahiti, on other archipelagoes, and in captivity
(Moorea Clade 4); on Moorea, with sister lineages on
Tahiti (S. attenuata); on Moorea (Moorea Clade 2); in cap-

One of the primary challenges faced in constructing a
meaningful phylogeny of a largely extirpated fauna concerns the issue of comprehensiveness; how confident are
we that our historical reference samples contain the primary Moorean endemic lineages? Although our taxonomic sample of Windward Island Partulidae was almost
complete, this in itself was insufficient because of the poor
correlation of nominal taxonomy with molecular markers
[26]. Nevertheless, our novel results were in good agreement with previous independent mt characterizations of
these taxa [25,27,28,34], both within Moorea (e.g., geographic distributions and taxonomic composition of the

preserve multiple mt clades that have been extirpated at
lower altitudes

tivity, with sister lineages on Tahiti and also in captivity
(Moorea Clade 5); sister lineages on Tahiti (S. diaphana);
in captivity (Moorea Clade 6).
Our assessment of Moorean partulid survival comes with
an obvious caveat concerning its broader utility; do these
results have relevance to understanding historical Moorean partulid whole organism genealogies, and their
present day conservation status? Fortunately, this did not
appear to be an issue for Windward Island Samoana species where there was excellent taxonomic/mt lineage congruence (Figure 8). However, Society Island partulid
taxonomy may be poorly corroborated by molecular
markers and, in addition, different nuclear (allozymes
and nRNA) and organellar genetic marker sets may also be
incongruent [25-28,36,37]. Although we cannot address
this issue directly using allozymes or high-resolution
nuclear markers, two lines of indirect data indicate that
our museum, captive and remnant wild mt genealogies do
have broader biological and conservation significance.
First, the taxonomic composition of our clades is in good
agreement with the results of Moorean breeding experiments [22], e.g., reproductive compatibility of P. taeniata
and P. exigua; compatibility of P. suturalis and P. aurantia;
incompatibility of P. mooreana and P. tohiveana with P.
suturalis, compatibility of P. mirabilis with both P. taeniata
and P. suturalis. Second, the ability of Partula spp. populations to persist on Moorea and in Tahitian valleys in the
long-term presence of Euglandina rosea appears to be correlated with both taxonomy and mt phylogeography.
Gerlach [44] proposed that impaired predator performance at altitude would allow the persistence of Society
Island partulids in montane refuges and we see evidence

[36]. Moorea has a much smaller montane (> 1000 m)
habitat than Tahiti and there is no part of the island where
a representative sampling of the original in-situ diversity
(taxonomic and/or mt lineage) has survived. This can be
readily visualized by comparing the distribution pattern
of surviving Partula taeniata populations (Figure 9; locations 1–6) with the pre-Euglandina rosea introduction distribution maps of the island's species of Partula [23].
Although the two widespread Moorean species, Partula
taeniata and P. suturalis, originally had almost identical
over-lapping distributions on Moorea [23], all six known
surviving populations of Moorean Partula are exclusively
composed of P. taeniata. Differential survival is also evident among mutually exclusive mt clades: Moorean
Clades 1, 2 and 4 for P. taeniata (all of which persist in the
wild); Moorean Clades 3, 5 and 6 for P. suturalis (all of
which are apparently extirpated in the wild). There is no
apparent correlation of survival with altitude on Moorea:
extant P. taeniata are found at sea-level (Opunohu Bay), at
lower altitudes (Maatea Valley, 180 m), and also just
below (1150 m) the summit (1207 m) of Mt. Tohiea, the
highest point on the island (Figure 1).
Predation models predict extirpation of Partula spp. populations within 3 years of initial Euglandina rosea contact
[45]. Snails bearing four Moorean mt lineages (Clades 2,
3, 5 (+ its sister clade Tahiti 1) and 6) meet this prediction
in that they have not persisted in the presence of the predator, surviving in the wild only in insulated micro-habitats such as the Opunohu Bay mangrove fern enclave
(Moorea Clade 2; Figure 3) or in a high altitude montane
refuge (Tahiti Clade 1; Figure 6; [36]). In contrast, snail
populations bearing one of two multi-island mt lineages
(Moorea Clade 1; Moorea 4 & Tahiti 5) have successfully
survived three decades of direct exposure to the predator
on Moorea and in many Tahitian valleys.
It is unclear at present what biological attributes, genetic
and/or ecological, underlie this differential persistence:
Crampton [20,21] documented relatively higher fecundities in Partula hyalina and P. clara (Tahiti Clade 5), but not
in P. taeniata (Moorean Clades 1, 4). Detailed field studies
of the surviving populations are urgently required and
these may yield clues toward developing a viable longterm conservation plan for Society Island partulid tree
snails. Goodacre's mt population study of P. taeniata historical populations documented the presence of a pronounced cline involving a western haplogroup (probably
our Moorean Clade 4) and an island-wide haplogroup
(probably our Moorean Clade 1) in northwestern valleys
that was not corroborated by variation in 6 polymorphic

A magnified view of the Samoana mt COI clade (Figure 1). It shows the topological placement and distribution of
Burch 1970 museum specimens together with those of extant wild samples. These include S. diaphana (Moorea and Tahiti, photograph of extant Tahitian snail by B. Holland); S. burchi, (Tahiti only, photograph of extant snail by T. Coote) and S. attenuata
[Moorea and Tahiti, photographs of extant wild snails by C. Hickman (Moorea) and T. Coote (Tahiti)]. A mt genotype obtained
from a surviving Raiatean population [30] is also included. Note that S. attenuata is known to persist in additional Tahitian valleys [14]. Support levels are given above branches; Bayesian posterior probabilities (> 70) on the left and maximum parsimony

allozyme loci [27]. It is therefore possible that surviving P.
taeniata populations bearing these two mt clades may
share common sets of hypothetical nuclear genomeencoded "resistance" traits, but this remains to be determined. Irrespective of the underlying mechanisms, the
differential resilience exhibited by P. taeniata, P. hyalina
and P. clara identifies them as the most promising captive
candidate lineages for future Windward Island reestablishment attempts.

Conclusion
Conservation efforts directed toward Moorean and Tahitian partulids have typically operated within a single
island frame of reference [14,18,29]. However, there is an
increasing appreciation among conservation biologists for
the importance of evolutionary and ecological processes
in effective conservation planning [46] and the multi-

island genealogical relationships of Moorean partulid
taxa (Figure 1), specifically the presence of five phylogenetically-distinct sister lineages on Tahiti, provide a
broader Windward Island evolutionary perspective on
Moorean tree snail survival. Our results imply that, for
many endemic partulid lineages, it may be apt to consider
Moorea and Tahiti in a more integrated fashion, where
proposed conservation initiatives on one of the islands
are evaluated within a collective Windward Island genealogical context. This may be especially pertinent in the
case of the genealogically-linked surviving lineages of P.
taeniata, P. hyalina and P. clara, but it is also potentially
relevant for conservation measures involving Thaitian
montane refuges where snails with robust phylogenetic
ties to extirpated Moorean lineages still persist (Figure 6).
Multi-island genealogical perspectives will probably
prove to be of proactive conservation value not only for

the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ)
where foot tissues were lyophilized and shells retained as
vouchers. We selected 125 lyophilized Moorean individuals for genotyping based on Crampton's species and subspecies-level taxonomy (Figure 10; Additional File 3).
From 1980 to 1985, emergency field sampling of six populations (Figure 9) led to the establishment of a number
of captive Moorean tree snail lines [15,17]. Sixteen captive
snails representing five Moorean Partula species [P. mirabilis, P. mooreana, P. tohiveana, P. taeniata (subspecies P. t.
nucleoli, and P. t. simulans) and P. suturalis (subspecies P.
s. vexillum and P. s. strigosa)] were supplied by the International Partulid Conservation Programme for genotyping.
From 2002–2006, a small number of biopsied tissue samples were obtained from extant Moorean populations,
preserved in 95% ethanol and forwarded for genotyping
(Figure 10). These included a specimen of Samoana attenuata from immediately below the Afareaito Partula
Reserve in the upper Oponuhu Valley and specimens of
newly discovered Partula taeniata populations from a variety of locations: Maatea, Haumi and Moruu valleys; a
mangrove fern habitat in Opunohu Bay; and two temporally distinct (2002, 2006) samples from just below (1150
m) the summit (1207 m) of Mt. Tohiea, the highest point
on the island (Figure 9, Additional File 3). Biopsies from
newly discovered extant Tahitian populations of P. clara
(Tiapa Valley), S. attenuata (Haapupni Valley) and putative S. burchi (Mt. Atara, Mt. Aorai) and S. diaphana (Mt.
Aorai, Mt. Pihaaiateta) that were not included in previous
studies [36,37] were also genotyped.

Sampling
See Figure 10 for an overview of the sampling locations
and the taxonomic identity of partulid snails genotyped in
this study. Voucher information is available in Additional
File 3 together with sampling details for previously genotyped partulid snails [30,36,37] incorporated into the
phylogenetic analyses.

Molecular Data
Total genomic DNA was isolated using a DNeasy Tissue
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
A 655 nucleotide (nt) mt COI target fragment was amplified with GoTaq DNA Polymerase (Promega, Madison,
WI) using the ''universal'' primer pair LCO1490/
HCO2198 [49] and a negative control (no template) was
included in each amplification run. After 2 min denatuation at 95°C, an initial annealing temperature of 65°C
was decreased by 2°C/cycle (30 sec denaturing at 95°C,
40 sec annealing and 1 min extension at 72°C) until the
final annealing temperature (45°C) was reached and subsequently maintained for an additional 30 cycles. Doublestranded products were isolated on 1% agarose gels,
excised over UV light, and extracted using a QIAquick gel
extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Both strands of the
amplified fragments were directly cycle-sequenced, using
the PCR primers, by the University of Michigan's Sequencing Core Facility. All DNA sequences obtained have been
deposited in GenBank (EU832996–EU833099).

J. B. Burch and associates sampled Moorean partulids in
October 1970 at 13 stations (Figure 9). Specimens of all
nominal Moorean partulid species except for Partula
tohiveana and Samoana attenuata were airmailed alive to

Phylogenetic analyses
The resulting chromatograms were edited by comparing
both strands using Sequence Navigator 1.0.1 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). COI sequences were aligned

Windward Island partulids, but also for the critically
endangered terrestrial biotas of many other Pacific hot
spot archipelagoes [47,48].

easily due to an absence of indels. Maximum likelihood
(ML) analyses were performed using PAUP*4.0b10 [50]
under the TVM+I+G model of sequence evolution, the
best-fit model selected by Akaike Information Criterion
implemented in Modeltest 3.7 [51]. Likelihood parameters [base frequencies (A = 0.3300, C = 0.1064, G =
0.1354, T = 0.4282); rate matrix (1.1933, 27.6197,
1.8944, 0.4618, 27.6197, 1); shape of gamma distribution = 1.2494; proportion of invariable sites = 0.5742]
found in Modeltest were used and heuristic searches were
employed by using a neighbor-joining starting tree and
nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) branch swapping.
The partulid genus Eua, restricted to central Pacific islands
in Samoa, American Samoa and Tonga, was used as the
outgroup [42]. Initial searches found two ML trees with a
log-likelihood (ln L) value of -9968.9197. Both trees were
further used as starting trees for another round of heuristic
search and a single ML tree (ln L = -9967.6214) was recovered.
Bayesian posterior probabilities and parsimony bootstrap
were employed to measure nodal support. Parsimony
bootstrapping [52] was done with the "fast" stepwiseaddition option for heuristic searches (1000 replicates)
using PAUP*. Bayesian analyses were performed using
MrBayes 3.1.2 [53] set for the GTR+Γ+I model. Model
parameters were treated as unknown and were estimated
for each analysis. Four chains were run simultaneously for
1,000,000 generations and trees were sampled every 100
cycles. Posterior probability values were estimated by generating a 50% majority rule consensus tree after the burnin period of 2,000 using PAUP*.
