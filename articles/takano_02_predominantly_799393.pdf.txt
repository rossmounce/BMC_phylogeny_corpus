Abstract
Background: Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis is due to an expanded polyglutamine tract
in huntingtin, but the specificity of neuronal loss compared with other polyglutamine disorders also
implies a role for the protein's unknown inherent function. Huntingtin is moderately conserved,
with 10 HEAT repeats reported in its amino-terminal half. HD orthologues are evident in
vertebrates and Drosophila, but not in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans or Arabidopsis
thaliana, a phylogenetic profile similar to the NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family transcription factors,
suggesting a potential functional relationship.
Results: We initially tested the potential for a relationship between huntingtin and dorsal by
overexpression experiments in Drosophila S2 cells. Drosophila huntingtin complexes via its carboxylterminal region with dorsal, and the two enter the nucleus concomitantly, partly in a
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and Nup88-dependent manner. Similarly, in HeLa cell extracts, human
huntingtin co-immunoprecipitates with NF-kB p50 but not with p105. By cross-species comparative
analysis, we find that the carboxyl-terminal segment of huntingtin that mediates the association with
dorsal possesses numerous HEAT-like sequences related to those in the amino-terminal segment.
Thus, Drosophila and vertebrate huntingtins are composed predominantly of 28 to 36 degenerate
HEAT-like repeats that span the entire protein.
Conclusion: Like other HEAT-repeat filled proteins, huntingtin is made up largely of degenerate
HEAT-like sequences, suggesting that it may play a scaffolding role in the formation of particular
protein-protein complexes. While many proteins have been implicated in complexes with the
amino-terminal region of huntingtin, the NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family transcription factors merit further
examination as direct or indirect interactors with huntingtin's carboxyl-terminal segment.

Background
Huntington's disease (HD) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of the most abundant neuronal population in the striatum, medium-sized

spiny projection neurons, as well as more diffuse neuronal loss in the rest of the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex
[1]. The major determinant of HD pathogenesis is an expanded polyglutamine tract in huntingtin, a large 350 kD

protein that is widely expressed in both neuronal and
non-neuronal cells [2]. Similarly expanded polyglutamine
tracts in other proteins also cause neurodegenerative disorders, but with different neuronal populations being lost
in each case [3]. The evident importance of protein context in determining neuronal susceptibility indicates a role
for huntingtin's normal structure or function in the specific pathogenesis of HD [4–9].
Human huntingtin is notable for contributing to the definition of HEAT (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein
phosphatsase 2A, TOR1) repeats, degenerate ~38 amino
acid motifs that normally appear in tandem arrays with
each unit consisting of two helical domains separated by
a non-helical region [10]. The crystal structures of the
PP2A PR65/A subunit and β-importin show these proteins to be composed almost entirely of 15 and 19 HEAT
repeats, respectively, which form a flexible solenoid-like
structure as they cooperate to mediate a number of different protein-protein interactions central to the proteins'
functions [11–16]. Despite its large size, the 10 HEAT repeats of human huntingtin located in approximately the
amino-terminal one-half of the protein were the only distinct functional motifs recognized, providing limited
clues to the protein's function [10,17]. However, the amino-terminal segment of huntingtin has been reported to
interact with more than two dozen proteins that implicate
it in such diverse processes as signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, RNA splicing, intracellular trafficking and cytoskeletal function [18,19].
Huntingtin's phylogenetic profile implies that it participates in biological pathways that exist in vertebrates and
insects, but not in yeast, nematode or plants [20,21]. This
phylogenetic profile is similar to that of the NF-kB/Rel/
dorsal family proteins, which regulate a variety of biological processes including neuronal survival and hematopoiesis [22–24], a process also dependent on huntingtin
[25]. This similarity led to us to test the potential for a relationship between Drosophila huntingtin and dorsal in a
Drosophila S2 cell overexpression system, where the carboxyl-terminal region of huntingtin was shown to associate and enter the nucleus jointly with dorsal, partly in a
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and Nup88-dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation of huntingtin and NF-kB
from HeLa cell extracts raises the potential for an analogous complex involving the human proteins. The apparent lack of functional motifs in the carboxyl-terminal
huntingtin segment that mediates the association with
dorsal led us to re-examine the distribution of HEAT-like
motifs, aided by cross-species comparison. Our findings
indicate that the huntingtin proteins are composed predominantly of degenerate HEAT-like sequences distributed across the entire protein, suggesting that huntingtin
may act as a scaffold in facilitating the formation of a va-

riety of functional complexes, analogous to other HEAT
repeat proteins. It is likely that such complexes may include NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family members and other direct
or indirect huntingtin interactors, but vary in constitution
depending on cell type, physiological state and intracellular localization.

Results
Concomitant nuclear accumulation of dorsal and the carboxyl terminal fragment of Drosophila huntingtin
Transfection of pPac-FLAG-Dorsal [26] into Drosophila S2
cells produced two patterns of expression, with approximately half of the transfected cells, respectively, showing
a predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 1a) or nuclear (Fig 1b)
distribution of FLAG-dorsal expression. Upon LPS stimulation, essentially all transfected cells showed nuclear accumulation of FLAG-Dorsal (data not shown), indicating
the presence of the LPS-responsive dorsal nuclear import
pathway [27,28]. By contrast, transfection of the myctagged carboxyl-terminal Drosophila huntingtin construct,
pIZ-Dhd2194C-myc (defined in Fig. 6a), always showed a
predominantly cytoplasmic distribution of expression
(Fig. 1c). Surprisingly, co-transfection of pPac-FLAG-Dorsal and pIZ-Dhd2194C-myc showed that both products
accumulated in the nucleus in every double-transfected
cell (Fig. 1d). pIZ-Dhd3126C-myc also showed the same
phenomenon, but not pIZ-DhdN605-myc, pIZ-DhdN84myc, or pIZ-DndN2193-myc (defined in Fig 6a, data not
shown), suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal conserved
region of huntingtin is crucial. Clearly, over-expression of
dorsal promoted nuclear accumulation of Dhd2194Cmyc, as pIZ-Dhd2194C-myc alone never showed detectable nuclear accumulation even after LPS stimulation (data
not shown). Similarly, Dhd2194C-myc enhanced FLAGDorsal nuclear accumulation, since all double-transfected
cells showed nuclear accumulation of FLAG-Dorsal, in
contrast with about half the cells transfected with FLAGDorsal alone.
The carboxyl-terminal fragment of Drosophila huntingtin
enters the nucleus with dorsal partly in a LPS- and Nup88dependent manner
To test whether coincident nuclear accumulation of
Dhd2194C-myc and FLAG-Dorsal (Fig. 1b) resulted from
concomitant entry of both proteins into the nucleus we
added a prenylation-mediated membrane-targeting motif
[29], Cys-Lys-Met-Leu sequence at the end of Dhd2194Cmyc, generating pIZ-Dhd2194C-myc-CKML. Co-transfection of pIZ-Dhd2194C-myc-CKML and pIZ-NLS-GFPlacZ showed a cytoplasmic distribution of Dhd2194Cmyc-CKML (Fig. 2a). When pIZ-Dhd2194C-myc-CKML
and pPac-FLAG-Dorsal were co-introduced, the cells did
not show clear nuclear accumulation of the products, but
instead exhibited a dot-like pattern of staining (Fig. 2b).
Some dots were positive for both proteins, indicating that

When pPac-FLAG-Dorsal encoding FLAG-tagged dorsal was transfected into S2 cells, approximately half of the transfected
cells had predominantly cytoplasmic distribution of FLAG-Dorsal (a) and the remaining half showed predominantly nuclear distribution (b). FLAG-Dorsal was detected by anti-FLAG M5 antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG. DNA staining
with TOTO-3 determined the nuclei. c, When pIZ-Dhd2194C-myc encoding the myc-tagged carboxyl-terminal fragment of
Drosophila huntingtin, Dhd2194C-myc, was introduced, the product was predominantly distributed to the cytoplasm. As a control, nuclei were determined by co-transfection of pIZ-NLS-GFP-lacZ encoding a SV40 nuclear localization signal-green fluorescence protein-lacZ chimeric protein [49] detected by anti-lacZ antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG. Dhd2194Cmyc was detected by anti-myc antiserum A-14 and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG. d, Co-expression of FLAG-Dorsal and
Dhd2194C-myc causes prominent nuclear accumulation of both proteins. The same observations were made using pIZ-HADorsal and pIZ-FLAG-Dorsal (data not shown).

Drosophila huntingtin and dorsal. a, Dhd2194C-myc-CKML has a prenylation-mediated membrane-targeting motif, CysLys-Met-Leu sequence, derived from Drosophila ras protein, at the end of Dhd2194C-myc. Co-transfection of pIZ-Dhd2194Cmyc-CKML and pIZ-NLS-GFP-lacZ showed cytoplasmic distribution of Dhd2194C-myc-CKML. b, Co-expression of
Dhd2194C-myc-CKML and FLAG-Dorsal causes dot-like staining without apparent nuclear accumulation of both proteins. c,
LPS stimulation to the cells expressing Dhd2194C-myc-CKML and FLAG-Dorsal caused nuclear accumulation of both proteins.
The same phenomena were observed using another prenylation motif construct, pIZ-Dhd2194C-myc-CAAC (data not
shown).

Dhd2194C-myc-CKML associated with FLAG-Dorsal but
the prenylated derivative did not promote dorsal's nuclear
accumulation. Upon stimulation with LPS, both proteins
accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 2c), suggesting that
Dhd2194C-myc-CKML and FLAG-Dorsal entered the nucleus concomitantly.
To examine this phenomenon with reference to known
mechanisms of dorsal nuclear import, we used Gal4 as a
potential competitive inhibitor of FLAG-Dorsal nuclear
translocation, based on the demonstration that dorsal and
Gal4 specifically require the same nucleoporin, Nup88, to

enter the nucleus in selected tissues [30]. Dhd2194C-myc
and FLAG-Dorsal were expressed in the Gal4-UAS system
[31] by co-transfection of pUAS-Dhd2194C-myc, pUASFLAG-Dorsal, and actin5C-Gal4 [32]. Cells positive for
Dhd2194C-myc or FLAG-Dorsal must be expressing Gal4
protein. The triple-transfected cells showed primarily cytoplasmic distribution of FLAG-Dorsal (Fig. 3a), although
a fraction appeared in the nucleus in some cells (Fig. 3b),
suggesting either that some FLAG-Dorsal nuclear import
is not subject to Gal4 inhibition or that the Gal4 effect is
incomplete. Dhd2194C-myc did not appear in the nucleus (Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b), indicating a greater inhibitory ef-

The concomitant nuclear
accumulation of Dhd2194C-myc and FLAG-Dorsal was not observed. Although a fraction of FLAG-Dorsal was distributed to
the nucleus (a), it was mostly distributed to the cytoplasm (b). Apparent nuclear accumulation was not observed. c, LPS stimulation caused concomitant nuclear accumulation of FLAG-Dorsal and Dhd2194C-myc even in the presence of Gal4. d, Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using proteins extracted from S2 cells expressing FLAG-Dorsal (lane 1:
input, and lane 3: immunoprecipitated products by anti-myc A14 antiserum), and those expressing FLAG-Dorsal and
Dhd2194C-myc (lane 2: input, and lane 4: immunoprecipitated products by anti-myc A14 antiserum). The proteins were
expressed by Gal4-UAS system. Detection was performed with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. FLAG-Dorsal were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-myc A14 antiserum in the presence of Dhd2194C-myc (lane 4), but not in the absence of Dhd2194C-myc (lane
3).

fect of Gal4 on Dhd2194C-myc nuclear accumulation.
With LPS stimulation, both proteins accumulated in the
nucleus (Fig. 3c), suggesting that the concomitant nuclear
translocation of Dhd2194C-myc and FLAG-Dorsal involves both LPS-dependent signalling and Nup88.
We next performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments
to determine whether Dhd2194C-myc and FLAG-Dorsal
were physically associated, either directly or indirectly.
FLAG-Dorsal was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-myc
A14 antiserum from lysate of cells transfected with
Dhd2194C-myc and FLAG-Dorsal, but not with FLAGDorsal alone (Fig. 3d), indicating that Dhd2194C-myc
and FLAG-Dorsal were present in the same complex.
Association of native huntingtins with dorsal and NF-kB
To evaluate endogenous huntingtin, rabbit polyclonal
anti-Drosophila huntingtin antisera, 1893 and 1894, were
used for Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. These antisera recognize over-expressed full-length
Drosophila huntingtin and amino-terminal fragment, and
also detect endogenous huntingtin as an approximately
400kDa protein (Fig. 4a,4b). The staining pattern of S2
cells was predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 4c), even after
LPS stimulation (data not shown). However, when FLAGDorsal accumulated in the nucleus after LPS stimulation,
approximately 30% of the cells showed nuclear huntingtin staining (Fig. 4d), indicating that combined dorsal
overexpression and LPS treatment significantly alter endogenous huntingtin's nuclear entry, nuclear retention or
epitope accessibility.

The association of Drosophila huntingtin with dorsal suggested that human huntingtin might similarly associate in
a complex with NF-kB. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa cell extracts with anti-huntingtin antibodies, MAB2166 and MAB2168. Human NFkB subunit, p50, but not p105, was specifically detected in
the immunoprecipitates by anti-NF-kB antiserum, sc-114
(Fig. 5a). The co-immunoprecipitation was enhanced by
TNF-alpha treatment (Fig. 5b). These results suggest that
NF-kB associates with huntingtin after dissociation from
its inhibitory protein, IkB, when NF-kB is available for
translocation to the nucleus.
Vertebrate and Drosophila huntingtins contain HEAT-like
repeats throughout their entire lengths
In view of the association of huntingtin with a NF-kB/Rel/
dorsal family member in both fly and vertebrate, we
sought the presence of conserved functional motifs by
cross-species comparison in the carboxyl-terminal region
and throughout the proteins. We have previously cloned
and submitted to GenBank a 3584 amino acid Drosophila
HD homolog largely identical to other reported sequences
[33] (Fig. 6). Comparison with the Prosite HEAT profile

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/3/15

revealed only sub-significant matches to two HEAT motifs
(amino acids 58–95 and 1326–1364) because of the extensive sequence diversity in these repeats. To capture this
diversity, we employed MEME (Multiple EM for Motif
Elicitation) [34] to construct ungapped motifs (represented as position-dependent probability matrices) from
known HEAT repeats and searched the GenBank nr protein database with MAST [35].
MEME motifs, trained with known huntingtin HEAT repeats from the amino-terminal segment, or with nonhuntingtin HEAT repeats, efficiently detected the corresponding huntingtin HEAT repeats and other HEAT-containing proteins. However, they also frequently revealed
significant matches to additional HEAT-like sequences in
the original proteins, including some in huntingtin's carboxyl-terminal region. Consequently, we performed an iterative analysis of vertebrate huntingtin HEAT repeats as,
after each round, we incorporated newly implicated
HEAT-like sequences from huntingtin into species-specific and cross-species MEME motifs. This iterative approach
culminated in the detection of 36 HEAT-like sequences in
the vertebrate huntingtins, extending across the entire
protein (Fig. 6a). The consensus secondary structure prediction for these HEAT-like sequences is a pair of helical
domains, separated by a non-helical spacer (Fig 6b).
These findings are consistent with Andrade et al. [36,37]
who recently reported a few additional HEAT repeats in
the vertebrate huntingtins, detected by a homology-based
iterative gapped alignment procedure (REP). Our data
suggest that huntingtin is largely made up of HEAT-like sequences, perhaps explaining the lack of other recognizable functional motifs.
Neither the MEME motif representing all vertebrate huntingtin HEAT-like sequences nor the REP program [37] efficiently detects equivalent sequences in Drosophila
huntingtin. However, an iterative process using MEME
motifs based on Drosophila HEAT repeats, sometimes in
concert with fish HEAT-like huntingtin sequences, revealed 28 HEAT-like sequences in Drosophila huntingtin,
again spanning the entire protein (Fig 6). Four of these
(D1, D13, D16, and D28), located in appropriate order
and position within the protein, could be related directly
to corresponding vertebrate HEAT-like sequences (H2,
H12, H16, and H35) using cross-species MEME motifs
representing individual vertebrate HEAT-like sequences.
The consensus secondary structure prediction for the 28
Drosophila HEAT-like sequences (Fig 6b) indicates a conservation of structure despite divergence in primary sequence.

Discussion
The HEAT-like repeats that we found in the vertebrate
huntingtins overlap both the originally identified HEAT

repeats and a few additional HEAT repeats, detected by a
homology-based iterative gapped alignment procedure
(REP), as well as identifying novel, apparently related segments [10,36,37]. We refer to the repeats detected by the
iterative MEME approach as HEAT-like because the search
process assumes a fixed length for all sequences and therefore does not produce gapped segments optimized to the
original definition of HEATs. Rather, it detects stretches of
fixed length related to a motif trained with known HEAT
motifs that are not specifically aligned by homology and,
therefore, it has the potential to reveal degenerate HEATrelated segments. The HEAT-like motifs are almost evenly
distributed in human huntingtin from amino-terminus to
carboxyl-terminus. Their preponderance perhaps explains
the lack of any other significant structural motifs detected
in this very large protein. Considering the degenerate na-

ture of HEAT repeats, it is likely that additional HEAT-like
motifs may still remain unidentified in the huntingtins.
This is particularly true of Drosophila huntingtin, where,
unlike in the vertebrates, the iterative search process could
not benefit from comparison of multiple sequences from
different species within the same phylum. Thus, despite
being slightly longer than the vertebrate proteins, Drosophila huntingtin revealed fewer overall HEAT-like sequences. Indeed, the detectable sequence homology
between Drosophila and vertebrate huntingtins is only segmental, whereas the vertebrate huntingtins are similar to
each other over their entire lengths (Fig. 6a). However, the
HEAT-like motifs of Drosophila huntingtin are also distributed evenly, irrespective of the regions of similarity with
vertebrate huntingtins, indicating that overall structures
of Drosophila and vertebrate huntingtins are likely to be
more similar than might expected from the comparison of
primary amino acid sequence. This also suggests that Drosophila huntingtin's HEAT-like sequences are more similar
to each other than to vertebrate HEAT-like sequences, perhaps indicating a degree of co-evolution of individual repeats within the same protein.
To date, there are no data concerning huntingtin's tertiary
structure. The large number of HEAT-like sequences in
huntingtin raises the possibility that huntingtin may have
a solenoid-like structure that acts as a scaffold for guiding
multiple protein-protein interactions, similar to PP2A
PR65/A subunit in phosphatase complexes and importinβ and transportin in nucleocytoplasmic transport [11–
16]. In this scenario, huntingtin might be expected to be
present in complexes with different protein compositions
in different cell types, physiological states and cellular locations. This view is consistent with numerous studies in
mammalian systems in which huntingtin has been found
to complex with different proteins, to reside in different
subcellular compartments in the cytoplasm and nucleus,
and to display different reactive epitopes in different locations within the same cell [8,18,19,38,39].
We initially chose to test the possibility that dorsal, the
prototypical Drosophila NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family member,
might be capable of joining huntingtin in a complex because both protein families show the same phylogenetic
profile. We demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal, but
not amino-terminal fragments of Drosophila huntingtin
and full-length dorsal associate and translocate into the
nucleus in S2 cells. Although the experimental condition
involved an artificial over-expression system, their concomitant movement into the nucleus was influenced by
LPS stimulation and by the presence of GAL4, which are
known to influence native dorsal nuclear translocation
[27,28,30], suggesting that the over-expressed carboxylterminal fragments of Drosophila huntingtin might reflect
some aspects of the physiological behaviors of the native

predicted a 3584 amino acid polypeptide with four regions of greatest sequence identity with human huntingtin (noted by horizontal lines, aa residues and %identity). The polyglutamine and polyproline stretches present in the amino terminal region of
human huntingtin (noted as a red bar) are absent from Drosophila huntingtin. The positions of 28 HEAT-like sequences are
shown as vertical lines in Drosophila, with the first and last numbered as D1 and D28, respectively. The positions of 36 HEATlike sequences in human huntingtin are similarly designated, from H1 to H36, with corresponding locations in other vertebrate
huntingtins shown below. These sequences are referred to here as HEAT-like, as they were not defined by the same homology
considerations originally used to define HEAT repeats and do not always precisely match their reported start and end-points.
Vertebrate huntingtin HEAT-like sequences were identified by iterative MAST searches of the nr protein database, beginning
with a MEME motif of 38 amino acids trained with the 10 published human huntingtin HEAT repeats (corresponding with the
regions of H3-5, H9-12, H18-19, and H21). All matches in vertebrate huntingtins with position p values < 10-4 were used to
create 6 species-specific MEME huntingtin motifs, along with one combined cross-species MEME motif, each of which was used
in the next round. Shuffling the sequences in the training sets or attempting an iterative search process with random segments
of proteins not reported to contain HEAT motifs produced either no motif or no significant additional matches. MEME motifs
were also created using 436 HEAT repeats from a wide variety of proteins [36,37] as well as from subsets of these representing importin (HEAT_IMB), adaptin (HEAT_ADB) and PP2A (HEAT_AAA) families. The vertebrate huntingtin HEAT-like
regions (detected in one or more species) by these motifs were: HEAT: 2–6, 9–12, 16, 19, 30, 36; HEAT_IMB: 2–4, 6, 12, 17;
HEAT_ADB: none, HEAT_AAA 2–5, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 28, 30, 34–36. Drosophila huntingtin HEAT-like sequences were identified by similar iterative searches, seeding the initial species-specific MEME motif with 4 Drosophila huntingtin segments (HEATlike sequences 1, 10, 13, 19) that showed significant matches with the HEAT_IMB importin MEME motif. During the iterative
searching, additional MEME motifs were also generated using the combination of Drosophila and fish HEAT-like sequences. Individual MEME motifs created from each group of 6 vertebrate HEAT-like sequences revealed a direct correspondence (noted in
green) between vertebrate segments 2, 12, 16 and 35 and Drosophila segments 1, 13, 16 and 28, respectively. It is likely that
Drosophila huntingtin contains additional undetected HEAT-like sequences, as our search process could not benefit from comparison with more closely related species, as was possible among the vertebrates. b, Consensus secondary structures for both
human and Drosophila HEAT-like sequences (probability of helical structure, pH_sec, for amino acids 1–38) were predicted
using PhD without alignment and revealed a pair of helical regions separated by a non-helical region.

protein. This view is supported by the co-immunoprecipitation of human huntingtin with NF-kB p50. The actual
nuclear translocation process of NF-kB is not understood
and nucleocytoplasmic transporters for NF-kB have not
been identified, though the presence of the typical NLS in
the conserved Rel-homology domain has implicated the
importins [22]. Dorsal nuclear import processes have
been shown to be complicated and varied, with one recent
study supporting a potential importin-independent route
for dorsal nuclear translocation involving Nup88 [27,40–
43]. The association of Drosophila huntingtin with LPSand Nup88-dependent dorsal nuclear translocation and
its structure of multiple HEAT-like motifs make it a tempting speculative candidate for a nucleocytoplasmic transporter, among other potential functions. Our observation
that endogenous Drosophila huntingtin showed infrequent nuclear accumulation compared with the carboxylterminal fragments, could suggest that, like importins, its
presence in the nucleus might be transient, with a rapid return to the cytoplasm after dissociation from the dorsalcontaining complex. Although we cannot yet address the
behavior and function of native full-length fly huntingtin
under physiological conditions, our data suggest that a
potential role for huntingtin in NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family
signalling should be further explored in both fly and vertebrate systems.
Finally, considerable effort has been focused in both human and model systems on the generation and potential
toxicity of amino-terminal cleavage fragments of huntingtin in HD [44–47]. This is due to the presence of the polyglutamine segment near the amino-terminus and the
large number of interacting proteins that have been defined for this portion of huntingtin. More recently, the destruction by protease cleavage of full-length huntingtin,
which has anti-apoptotic properties, has been suggested
to play a role in accelerating pathogenesis [5,45,48]. As
NF-kB is involved in neuronal survival and death [22,23],
our findings suggest that further studies are also needed to
determine whether the carboxyl-terminal huntingtin fragments released by cleavage of full-length huntingtin
might also play a role in pathogenesis via an effect on NFkB/Rel/dorsal family signalling.

Conclusions
Delineation of the normal structure and functions of
huntingtin proteins may disclose features that underlie
the specificity of neuronal cell death in HD. Cross-species
comparison revealed that fly and vertebrate huntingtins
are both large proteins made up predominantly of degenerate HEAT-like motifs similar to those found in solenoidlike scaffolding proteins that organize protein-protein
complexes. The NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family transcription factors are candidates for association with huntingtin in such
complexes and for co-transport to the nucleus, based on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/3/15

overexpression experiments in Drosophila S2 cells. These
findings suggest a potential physiological role for huntingtin in NF-kB/Rel/dorsal family transcription factor signalling pathways, and possibly in nuclear transport that
will require detailed examination in both fly and vertebrate systems and in models of HD.

Methods
cDNA cloning
A search of the Drosophila Expressed Sequence Tag Database (Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, [http://
www.fruitfly.org/]) identified an EST clone, LD23533, as
encoding a peptide with similarity to an amino-terminal
region of human huntingtin (amino acid position 48–
136). With LD23533 as an initial probe, a series of cDNA
screenings was performed using Drosophila embryo UniZAP XR (Stratagene), embryo λgt10, and larval λgt11
cDNA libraries (Clontech). To assemble the consensus
cDNA sequence, every position of the cDNA sequence was
determined in at least 2 independent cDNA clones to
make sure that at least 2 independent clones have identical sequences. There were 6 sites of sequence variations,
which were thought to be polymorphisms, since each of
the variations was confirmed in at least 2 independent
clones. One polymorphism (A6792G) caused an amino
acid substitution (T2243A), two (C5807G, A6194C) were
neutral, and three (C11261T, T11282C, A11298G) occurred in the 3 prime untranslated region.
Sequence analyses
Similarity searches for homologous proteins were performed against nr (NCBI, [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]),
yeast (Saccharomyces genome database,
[www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/]), C. elegans (Sanger Center,
[www.sanger.ac.uk]), Drosophila (Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, [www.fruitfly.org]), and Arabidopsis (The
Arabidopsis Information Resource,
[www.arabidopsis.org]) databases. Pair-wise sequence alignments were
performed by blast2
[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/
bl2seq/bl2.html] with BLOSUM90. Searches for protein
motifs were performed with PROSIT [www2.ebi.ac.uk/
ppsearch/], Pfam [www.sanger.ac.uk/Pfam/], BLOCKS
[www.blocks.fhcrc.org/blocks/], and Prosite Profile
(Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research,
[www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/software/PFSCAN_form.html]).
MEME and MAST [34,35] were used to construct HEATlike motifs and search the nr protein database [www.meme.sdsc.edu]. Searches for huntingtin HEAT repeats were
also carried out with REP [37] [www.embl-heidelberg.de/
~andrade/papers/rep/search.html/]. This site also provided alignments of 436 HEAT repeats from many different
proteins and of the subsets HEAT_IMB, HEAT_ADB and
HEAT_AAA. Secondary structure predictions were carried
out with PhD and PROF [www.maple.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/].

Imaging
S2 (ATCC) and HeLa (Clontech) cells were maintained in
DS2 (Cellgro) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (Gibco)
media, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, at 23° C and at 37° C in 5 % CO2, respectively.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma)
and TNF-alpha (Sigma) stimulation were applied to S2
cells at 10 µg/ml for 1 hr, and HeLa cells at 20 ng/ml for
30 min, respectively. Transfection was performed using
Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer's instruction. For immunostaining, S2 cells
were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 25 min. After
permeabilization with 0.1% Triton-X, primary antibodies
were applied. Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes)
