Abstract
Background: iTRAQ is a proteomics technique that uses isobaric tags for relative and absolute
quantitation of tryptic peptides. In proteomics experiments, the detection and high confidence
annotation of proteins and the significance of corresponding expression differences can depend on
the quality and the species specificity of the tryptic peptide map database used for analysis of the
data. For species for which finished genome sequence data are not available, identification of
proteins relies on similarity to proteins from other species using comprehensive peptide map
databases such as the MSDB.
Results: We were interested in characterizing ripening initiation ('veraison') in grape berries at the
protein level in order to better define the molecular control of this important process for grape
growers and wine makers. We developed a bioinformatic pipeline for processing EST data in order
to produce a predicted tryptic peptide database specifically targeted to the wine grape cultivar, Vitis
vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, and lacking truncated N- and C-terminal fragments. By searching
iTRAQ MS/MS data generated from berry exocarp and mesocarp samples at ripening initiation, we
determined that implementation of the custom database afforded a large improvement in high
confidence peptide annotation in comparison to the MSDB. We used iTRAQ MS/MS in conjunction
with custom peptide db searches to quantitatively characterize several important pathway
components for berry ripening previously described at the transcriptional level and confirmed
expression patterns for these at the protein level.
Conclusion: We determined that a predicted peptide database for MS/MS applications can be
derived from EST data using advanced clustering and trimming approaches and successfully
implemented for quantitative proteome profiling. Quantitative shotgun proteome profiling holds
great promise for characterizing biological processes such as fruit ripening initiation and may be
further improved by employing preparative techniques and/or analytical equipment that increase
peptide detection sensitivity via a shotgun approach.

Background
The field of protein discovery through mass spectrometry
(MS) continues to grow rapidly but the number of species
for which finished (i.e. > 98% complete) whole genome
sequence data are available is currently not keeping pace.
For a large number of laboratories worldwide studying
proteomes in 'non-mainstream' organisms, annotations
of tandem mass spectra data must rely on open reading
frame (ORF) predictions from expressed sequence tag
(EST) data from their species of interest or a phylogenetically close relative. ESTs generated from single pass
sequencing reactions are frequently not full length and the
reading frames are unknown. Proteolytic peptide
sequence databases derived from multiple, truncated predicted ORFs per each of thousands of ESTs can hamper the
ability of search engines such as MASCOT [1] and algorithms such as Paragon in ProteinPilot software [2] to
make statistically robust protein identifications from MS/
MS spectrum data [3]. Protein identifications from MS/
MS spectra may be further complicated when the EST data
that are used to build a peptide sequence database are created based on one genotype for a given species. We report
here on the development of scripts for the generation of a
predicted tryptic peptide sequence database based on EST
data in grapevine. Our computational approach accounts
for multiple open reading frames, truncated predicted
ORFs, and the presence of N-terminal signal peptides, and
may be useful for MS/MS-based protein discovery in any
species for which EST data are available.
Quantitative protein expression profiling analyses in
plants have increasingly implemented stable isotopic
labeling as an advance or complement to two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) methods. Isotope
coded affinity tagging (ICAT) reagents are used to covalently label cysteine residues with heavy or light hydrogen
or carbon in two complex peptide samples, for example,
wild type versus mutant genotypes. The ICAT chemistry is
used to purify labeled peptides via affinity chromatography and then samples are mixed and subjected to LC-MS/
MS [4]. One of the first reports on an ICAT application in
plants was in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) where relative
expression in monosomic deletion mutants was used to
begin to clarify the influence of ancestral genomes on differential seed protein expression for breeding applications
[5]. The ICAT technique is limited, however, by the tagging of cysteine residues only, as well as the need for affinity purification of labeled peptides; invariably,
information is lost through these steps. An improvement
to the ICAT technique involves the labeling of amine
groups using a set of four or more isobaric tags. The
advantages of this technique, isobaric tagging for relative
and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), are that most peptides are labeled, no affinity purification step is required,
and the isobaric nature of the tags allows co-elution of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/50

identical peptides that are differentially tagged, thereby
enriching detection sensitivity and accuracy in comparison to ICAT [6]. Few reports of iTRAQ implementation in
plant proteome studies have been reported but pioneering
work in this field has been successful, for example, in further defining the organellar proteome in Arabidopsis [7],
characterizing pathogen defense mechanisms in Arabidopsis [8], and clarifying micronutrient stress responses in
barley (Hordeum vulgare) [9].
We were interested in characterizing ripening initiation in
grape berries at the level of differential protein expression
in order to better define the molecular control of this
important process for grape growers and wine makers.
Grape berry ripening is non-climacteric and ethylene does
not act as a major signal initiating this process, as it does
in climacteric species such as tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). Abscisic acid (ABA), hexoses, and brassinosteroids
(BRs) have previously been implicated in non-climacteric
ripening regulation but how these and potentially other
signaling pathways interact to effect major changes in
berry biochemistry at ripening initiation is poorly understood. The tissues in the grape berry consist of the seeds,
the mesocarp (flesh), and the exocarp (skin); the pericarp
refers to the mesocarp and exocarp, collectively. Primary
and secondary compounds important for grape and wine
products begin to accumulate in the exocarp and/or the
mesocarp at ripening initiation [10], so we considered
that it was important to evaluate changes in the berry proteome separately in these tissues. To date, a limited
number of reports on proteome profiling in grapevine
and grape berries have been published in which 2DGE
was employed [11-14]. We considered that the iTRAQ
technique could be useful in surmounting some technical
limitations encountered with 2DGE and allow us to detect
a greater number of proteins per sample. In this report, we
demonstrate the application of our computational
approach to tryptic peptide sequence database development from a large collection of grapevine EST data and
validate its usefulness by showing improved detection
and annotations of MS/MS data derived from grape exocarp and mesocarp total protein extracts. We further provide new quantitative information on differential protein
expression during ripening initiation in grape berries. This
is the first report in which iTRAQ has been used to study
differential protein expression in any fruit.

Methods
Plant material
Grape clusters were sampled from V. vinifera cv. Cabernet
Sauvignon clone 15 grafted on rootstock 101-14 in a commercial vineyard near Osoyoos, British Columbia, in the
2004 and 2005 seasons. Sampling dates during each season were focused on the developmental stages undergoing
ripening initiation. Clusters were sampled on a single date

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:50

in 2004, August 12th, which was the timing of approximately 50% ripening initiation based on a turning pink
color phenotype. For the 2005 season, the ripening initiation stage was sampled over a longer period (August 10th
through August 16th), since in this growing season, ripening advanced slowly due to lower atmospheric temperatures. Five clusters from five different vines were sampled
in each season and snap frozen directly in liquid nitrogen
in the vineyard and then transported on dry ice to UBC
Vancouver where they were stored at -80°C.
Individual grapes from each of the 2004 and 2005 clusters
were developmentally staged based on a visual pigmentation assessment and were segregated for each season into
green, pink/turning, fully turned red, and fully turned
purple phenotypic classes. For the 2005 samples, green
grapes were only taken from clusters collected on August
10th, since for this date and August 12th there was no visible change in color present in any of the grape clusters.
Thirty grapes of similar sizes per pigmentation class per
year were segregated for experimentation. Prior to total
protein extraction, individual grapes were partially
thawed in gloved hands and then, using a forceps, the exocarp tissue was carefully peeled away from the mesocarp
and placed immediately into liquid nitrogen. Seeds were
then carefully removed while keeping the remaining mesocarp tissue frozen in liquid nitrogen. Exocarp and mesocarp samples were ground to a powder under liquid
nitrogen and then used for total protein extractions.
Tissue preparation for protein extraction
Preparation of exocarp tissue samples for protein extraction was performed according to a previously described
protocol for olive leaf [15] with some modifications
described here. The procedure was carried out on ice and
centrifugations were performed at 4°C. Throughout the
procedure, each wash was done by complete resuspending
of the tissue pellet. Four hundred mg of powdered exocarp
tissue was placed in a 2 mL G-tube (Fisher Scientific Canada, Ottawa, ON). The tissue was suspended in 1.5 mL of
a cold (-20°C) ethyl acetate:ethanol (1:2 (v:v)) solution
by vortexing for 30 s; the ethyl acetate:ethanol extraction
was previously found to be useful for removing pectins as
well as pigments such as chlorophylls [16]. Following centrifugation for 3 min at 21000 × g, the supernatant was
removed and the ethyl acetate:ethanol extraction and centrifugation steps were repeated on the remaining tissue.
The sample was next extracted twice with cold (-20°C)
100% acetone by vortexing and centrifuging, as before.
Subsequently, the tissue with added acetone was transferred from the G-tube to a mortar using a 1 mL pipette
with the tip end excised to increase diameter and then the
acetone was evaporated from the tissue at room temperature. After the addition of 1/3 vol of white quartz sand
(Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) to the tissue, it

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/50

was ground to an even finer powder. The powder was
transferred back to a clean 2 mL G-tube by suspending the
tissue in 1.5 mL of cold (-20°C) TCA:acetone (1:9 (v/v))
and vigorously mixed and centrifuged, as before. Extraction with 10% TCA:acetone was repeated five to seven
times, or until no more anthocyanins (red-pigmented flavonoids) could be extracted from the tissue. This was followed by three washes with chilled (4°C) 10% TCA in
water by vigorous mixing and centrifugation, as before, to
extract the pectins and remaining anthocyanins from the
tissue. After this, the tissue was washed twice with cold (20°C) 80% acetone and centrifuged, as before. Protein
extraction was performed after drying the tissue pellet to
completion in a speed vacuum extractor (SPD131DDA,
Thermo Scientific, Milford, MA, USA).
For the preparation of the mesocarp tissue, the same procedure for the exocarp was used with the following modifications. Three g of starting material was used per sample
and the first extractions up to the grinding step with white
quartz were done in 50 mL Oakridge tubes. Since some
protein can be extracted from the mesocarp via TCA:acetone extraction alone [14], a 20 min incubation time at 20°C was introduced after the first 100% acetone step and
included in the subsequent TCA:acetone containing steps
to ensure that all of the protein remained precipitated. In
the TCA:H2O step, the 20 min incubation was done on
ice. Since no anthocyanins are present in mesocarp, only
two TCA:acetone extractions were carried out for the mesocarp tissue.
Total protein extraction
Two hundred to 300 mg of pre-extracted and dried exocarp or mesocarp tissue contained in a 2 mL G-tube was
extracted by resuspending the pellet in 0.75 mL cold Trisbuffered phenol, pH 7.9. Then, 0.75 mL of dense SDS
buffer (30% sucrose, 2% SDS, 0.1 M Tris-HCL, pH 8.0)
was added. The mixture was vortexed for 30 s and incubated on ice for 40 min with intermittent vortexing. The
phenol phase containing the protein as the top phase was
separated by centrifugation at 21000 × g for 5 min and
transferred into a clean 2 mL G-tube. The remaining SDS
phase was re-extracted with another 0.75 mL Tris-buffered
phenol and incubated for 20 min before centrifuging and
subsequent transfer and combination of the two phenol
phases. Protein was precipitated by adding a minimum of
5 vol cold methanol plus 0.1 M ammonium acetate to the
combined phenol phase. Precipitation was carried out at 20°C for 30 min or overnight. After centrifugation at
21000 g for 10 min, the pellet was washed twice with cold
methanol containing 0.1 M ammonium acetate and subsequently with 80% acetone twice. Pellets were next dissolved in 200–300 μL fresh buffer containing 6 M urea,
2% CHAPS, 5 mM EDTA, and 30 mM HEPES, pH 8.1, to

obtain a concentration of approximately 1.0 μg/μL. Careful sonication on ice was used to dissolve the samples.
Protein quantitation was done using a bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) absorption assay (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd.,
Oakville, ON) and read in a Victor V plate reader (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Woodbridge, ON,
Canada) equipped with a photometric filter of 560 nm
and 10 nm bandwidth. The quality of each protein sample
was checked via SDS-PAGE; all samples were devoid of
indications of degradation and showed good resolution
with low background. Total protein samples were then
shipped on dry ice to the University of Victoria-Genome
BC Proteomics Centre in Victoria, BC, for iTRAQ analyses.
Using a second BCA assay, each protein sample was requantified just before aliquoting 100 μg of each sample
for iTRAQ labeling steps.
Experimental design and labeling of peptides with iTRAQ
reagents
The experimental design consisted of the four developmental stages described earlier for each of exocarp 2004,
mesocarp 2004, exocarp 2005, and mesocarp 2005. Two
biological replicates were employed for each stage and tissue for the 2005 samples, whereas one 2004 sample was
used for each stage of mesocarp or exocarp. An additional
technical replicate was carried out for exocarp 2004, representing separate iTRAQ labeling reactions and analyses
starting from the same protein sample.

Labeling of peptides with iTRAQ reagents (Applied Biosystems Canada, Streetsville, ON) was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations as follows.
One hundred μg of each protein sample in a maximum
volume of 200 μL was precipitated overnight using 100%
acetone and dissolved in 20 μL of denaturing buffer containing 1 μL denaturant and 2 μL reducing reagent (TCEP)
as provided in the iTRAQ kit, followed by vortexing and
incubation at 60°C for 1 h. One μL of cysteine blocking
solution (MMTS) was then added to each sample, followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min.
These protein samples were digested overnight with
trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 37°C. iTRAQ
labeling was carried out by adding iTRAQ reagents 114,
115, 116, and 117 to either the exocarp or the mesocarp
samples representing the four developmental stages,
green, pink/turning stage, red/fully turned, and purple,
respectively. Subsequently, these four samples were mixed
by vortexing and further incubated at room temperature
for 1 h.
The four iTRAQ-labeled peptide samples were pooled
together, diluted 1:10 with cation exchange sample buffer
(A) containing 25% acetonitrile in 10 mM KH2PO4, and
then adjusted to pH 3.0 using phosphoric acid. Because of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/50

this acidification step, it is important to remove pectins
prior to total protein extractions; we found in previous trials that the pectins likely polymerized and precipitated
out of solution, converting samples mostly to a gelatinous
state unsuitable for further analyses (data not shown). The
combined peptide mixture was fractionated by strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography on a BioCAD workstation (Applied Biosystems), using a 4.6 mm × 20 cm
polysulfoethyl aspartamide column (PolyLC Inc, Columbia, MD, USA). First, the mixed samples were loaded in
buffer A at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Once completely
loaded, the column was washed for 20 min with buffer A.
Peptides were eluted by a linear gradient of 0 to 350 mM
KCl in buffer B (20 mM KH2PO4, 25% acetonitrile, pH
3.0). Sixty-nine fractions were collected over the course of
70 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Of these fractions, only
12 fractions containing the eluted labeled peptides as
measured by optical density monitoring at 214 nm were
chosen for analysis on a 2 h LC-MS/MS program. The fractionated samples were reduced to 150 μL in a speed-vac
(Thermo-Savant, Holbrook, NY, USA) and transferred to
autosampler tubes (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry
The samples were analyzed for identification and quantitation on a QSTAR Pulsar i hybrid tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system (Applied Biosystems, MDS
Sciex), fitted with a nano-electrospray ionization source
(Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) using a 10 μm fused silica
emitter tip (New Objectives, Woburn, MA, USA) and
interfaced with an integrated LC system consisting of a
Famos autosampler, SwitchOS II switching pump, and
Ultimate micropump (LC Packings). Individual fractions
containing peptides were injected onto a 300 μm × 5 cm
C18 PepMap guard column (5 μm, 100A; LC Packings),
resolved using a 75 μm × 150 mm analytical column (3
μm, 100A; LC Packings), and eluted using an automated
binary gradient (200 nL/min) from 100% buffer A (2%
acetonitrile (ACN), 0.05% formic acid in H2O) to 40%
buffer B (0.05% formic acid in 98% ACN) in 40 min, then
from 40% to 80% buffer B for 5 min. MS time of flight
(TOF) scans were acquired from m/z 400 to 1200 for one
second with up to two precursors selected for MS/MS from
m/z 100 to 1500 using information-dependent acquisition at 2.5 seconds per scan; rolling collision energy was
used to promote fragmentation.
Custom predicted tryptic peptide database
A schema showing the pipeline for production of the predicted peptide database in support of this subsection is
shown in Figure 1. All publicly available EST data for each
Vitis species (AS, all sequences), including those from all
V. vinifera (wine grape) cultivars, were downloaded in
August 2007 as FASTA files from the National Center for

Schema of the workflow in construction of the predicted peptide database based upon Vitis spp. ESTs. Steps in
EST selection (yellow), EST curation (orange), contig assembly (green), and translation, start methionine prediction, tryptic
cleavage site prediction, and removal of predicted truncated N- and/or C-terminal peptides (blue) are shown. The in-house
"GrapeGen" EST database was derived from the V. vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and Muscat Hamburg cDNAs [17]. Where a
CS EST was duplicated between the Genbank and in-house databases, the Genbank EST was removed and the EST from the inhouse database, containing the phred scores, was used for clustering. CS = Cabernet Sauvignon ESTs; MH = Muscat Hamburg
ESTs; Vv = Vitis vinifera; Wild = Vitis spp. ESTs other than V. vinifera. A key to the codes used in 'Cluster ORF ID' and 'Protein
Annotation' in Additional files 1 through 8 is presented in Additional file 10 and may be printed out as a quick reference when
examining the iTRAQ results; tissue types (i.e. CS_) are described in Methods and Additional file 10.

Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, MD, USA).
These data were parsed on the basis of reported Vitis species of origin with the vast majority being from V. vinifera
cultivars. Since we were specifically interested in studying
the proteome in V. vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon (CS)
pericarp tissue, an additional, more rigorous approach to
the parsing of the CS ESTs was carried out in order to
reduce or eliminate the potential for subsequent assembly
of paralogous CS sequences into invalid contigs, thereby
striving to strengthen the validity of protein identification
in our iTRAQ experiments. CS ESTs were obtained from

the NCBI Genbank database or from an in-house EST
project [17] and subdivided into the following categories
based upon the reported source tissues for the cDNAs
used for single pass sequencing: Whole berry including
seed (CSB), berry without seed (pericarp, CSP), skin without seed or flesh (exocarp, CSE), seed only (CSS), and
other tissues (CSO) including leaf, flower, tendril, and
root. Because the in-house ESTs were also present in the
NCBI Genbank database, the corresponding entries in
Genbank were removed since the Genbank entries do not
have sequence quality (phred [18]) scores. The following

files containing EST data comprised each of the above
mentioned groups: VV (VV.fasta representing all V. vinifera ESTs including in-house ESTs); WS (WS.fasta including ESTs from all available wild species, V. aestivalis; V.
cinerea × V. riparia; V. cinerea × V. rupestris; Vitis hybrid
(species not indicated in Genbank); V. labrusca; V. pseudoreticulata; V. riparia; V. rotundifolia; V. shuttleworthii), CSO
(Bud.fasta; Flower_leaf _root.fasta; Leaf_blade.fasta; Petiole.fasta;
Root.fasta;
Flower-Pre-bloom.fasta;

Fruit_with_seeds_removed.fasta;
Fruit_without_seeds.fasta), CSE (Fruit_skin.fasta), and
CSB (Berry.fasta; Fruit.fasta).
Sequences were processed using cross_match (minmatch
12, penalty -2, minscore 20; http://www.phrap.org) and
trim2 (G. Williams, http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/
release/5.0/emboss/apps/trimseq.html) in order to
remove vector sequences as well as ambiguous nucleotides at the sequence ends. To successfully perform the
above cleanup analyses, phred quality scores were used
where available; otherwise, 'place-holder' quality scores
were generated for any sequences for which no phred
scores were available, as was the case for most of the ESTs
in Genbank. Place-holder quality scores were also used
later in the cluster assembly process as discussed in more
detail, below. Following the cross_match and trim2
processing, the sequences were further trimmed using Perl
scripts designed in-house to eliminate known invalid
sequences (e.g. microbial sequences, simple sequence
repeats) and trim polyA/T tails, if present in a given
sequence. PolyA/T stretches were limited to 12 bp in order
to prevent subsequent chimeric contig assembly based on
those repeats. If polyA was followed by a > 30 bp stretch
of AC, AT, GC, or GT repeats, the polyA stretch was
trimmed to 12 bp and all sequence 3' to this was discarded; if polyT was preceded by a > 30 bp stretch of AC,
AT, GC, or GT repeating sequence, the polyT stretch was
trimmed to 12 bp and all sequence 5' to this was discarded. If polyA started at least two thirds of the EST
sequence length, it was trimmed to 12 bp; if polyT started
at less than one third of the EST sequence, it was trimmed
to 12 bp. Any part of a sequence that started or ended with
> 30 bp of repeats of AC, AT, GC, or GT was deleted. If a
sequence started or ended with 'N's (indicating ambiguous base calls), the 'N's were deleted and the corresponding quality scores were also removed.
To better ensure that contig assemblies were based on
high quality nucleotide sequence data, percent 'N'
(ambiguous base call) content was determined for each
sequence. If the percentage was > 0.3 (i.e. four or more
'N's per 1000 bp), the flanking 100 bp regions where

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/50

scanned for 'N's and, if present, were trimmed to exclude
the 'N's, thereby lowering the total 'N' percentage.
Sequences shorter than 200 bp were trimmed to the first
and last occurrences of an 'N'. For resulting sequences
longer than 50 bp, the 'N' percentage was recalculated
and, if still > 0.3%, a record of the sequence was made.
Each of these sequences was then compared with other
sequences in a combined dataset using BLASTN to determine its uniqueness. If a given sequence was already represented in the dataset by another sequence with a lower
'N' content, the sequence in question was eliminated.
The curated sequence datasets were next clustered using
PCAP software [19] with parameters of 95% overlap identity and 60 bp overlap length [17]. PCAP was used instead
of CAP3 in order to take advantage of parallelized processing. Parallelization provided the ability to distribute each
dataset assembly workload across 100 CPUs for significantly faster processing time. The PCAP assembly program
was modified and recompiled with EST_flag set at 1 (the
default is 0, which indicates genomic reads). The PCAP
assembly step was followed by a series of post-assembly
steps (bdocs -y 100 -z 0, bclean -y 100 -w 1, bcontig -y 100
-p 95, bconsen -y 100 -z 0 -p 95, bform -y 100). We performed two clustering permutations in order to test the
effects of database design on peptide identification using
our iTRAQ data. First, we clustered all sequences together
to create the "AS" database, including WS, VV, and all CS_
files; all sequences were weighted evenly. Second, CSB,
CSE, CSP, CSO, CSS, WS, and VV (including CS
sequences) were clustered separately with higher weighting (place-holder scores) placed on CS sequences in the
VV build and the original phred scores retained for the inhouse CS sequences. Weighting was accomplished by
assigning higher quality scores such that when polymorphisms were encountered by PCAP in an assembly, preference was given for selection of the CS nucleotide for the
resulting contig. Following assemblies, the generated contigs and singletons were merged into one file for each
dataset (AS, CSB, CSE, CSP, CSO, CSS, VV, WS). Any
sequences longer than 2500 bp were suspected to be chimeric, so they were parsed to a separate file, translated in
all 6 frames, and peptides with a minimal size of 80
amino acids before a predicted stop codon were submitted to a BLASTX search against the nr database. The resulting multiple peptides predicted within long contigs were
coded with "LC", as well as with "F" for the translational
frame, with the frame number (either positive for forward
or negative for reverse) and the peptide number designated from among the multiple peptides (separated by a
period from the frame number).
A BLASTX analysis was next performed on each contig and
singleton sequence against the nr database in order to
identify the best frame for subsequent in silico translation.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:50

The frame identified via BLASTX analysis was then used to
generate the predicted ORF (i.e. amino acid translation)
for a given contig or singleton. In order to further curate
predicted ORFs, each was subjected to in silico cleavage at
any 'unknown' amino acid ('X') or stop codon and then
compared to a similarly generated list of peptides from the
corresponding best scoring protein sequence identified in
the BLASTX search. The 'best peptide' was then identified
in the translation frame as the peptide with an exact
match to the BLASTX peptide. If no such peptide could be
identified, the longest peptide generated by in silico cleavage of the sequence at each occurrence of an unknown
amino acid and/or stop codon was used. All sequences
which resulted in "no hit found" in the BLASTX results
were subsequently translated in all six frames and
appended to the end of the 'best peptide' file. In all cases
where a six-frame translation was applied, the resulting
peptides (designated as 'NH' in the database) were
cleaved in silico at every unknown amino acid and/or stop
codon and only those sequences 80 amino acids or longer
were kept.
The resulting list of 'best peptides' for each of the
sequences was then subjected to BLASTP analysis using
the UniProtKB database in order to determine the
sequence identity. The five highest BLASTP hits for each
query sequence were aligned using an in-house Perl script
to identify putative N- and/or C-termini. If no consensus
site could determined for an N- or C-terminus via alignment with similar sequences, then these sequences were
trimmed at the tryptic digestion site nearest to the ends of
the predicted ORF to eliminate potentially truncated predicted tryptic peptides from the database. The parameters
programmed into the scripts included: 1) BLASTP e-values, where E = H indicates a less significant hit (> 1e-05)
and E = L indicates a stronger hit (E ≤ 1e-05), 2) the difference in length of the Vitis query sequence versus each of
the top five subject sequences, and 3) the length of the
exact match of amino acids to the top hit. These parameters improved automation of accurate predictions of
methionine (M) sites and identification of likely fulllength amino acid sequences without requiring manual
inspection of the BLASTP results. Sequences identified
with a predicted methionine at the N-terminus were
coded with '(M)'. Determinations of C termini were done
based on a small range cutoff (± 2) of amino acids
between the stop codon in each top hit and the predicted
stop codon in each corresponding Vitis ORF; if the difference was greater than two amino acids and deemed
unclear, the C-terminal end of the predicted ORF was
trimmed at the nearest upstream tryptic cleavage site.
The detailed process, above, was applied to each data set
individually (AS, WS, VV, CSO, CSS, CSP, CSE and CSB).
In preparation for the merger of the datasets, the CS tis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/50

sue-specific sequences were analyzed for uniqueness
based on comparing each sequence to every other
sequence and discarding all shorter sequences for each
exact match. Once all CS duplicate sequences were
removed, this dataset was merged with the remaining two
sets, VV and WS. This final set consisting of all of the
sequences was then subjected to yet another uniqueness
test where each sequence was compared to every other
sequence but this time CS sequences where intentionally
not removed, even if an exact duplicate existed in either
the VV or the WS set and was of greater length. This
allowed for preferential retention of the CS sequences in
order to keep information about the tissue of origin of a
detected protein. Out of a total of 113243 sequences submitted to the uniqueness test, 52394 were identified with
CS duplicates present due to the preferential retention of
those sequences. From the resulting sequences, only those
that started with a predicted methionine were then submitted for SignalP analysis http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/serv
ices/SignalP/ and processing which allowed for the identification and ultimate trimming of signal peptides giving
rise to predicted mature protein sequences. Those
trimmed sequences that had a predicted cleavable targeting signal were coded '(SP)'. After removal of the predicted signal peptides, a final uniqueness test was
performed.
Analysis of MS/MS data
iTRAQ MS/MS data were analyzed using ProteinPilot software v. 2.0.1 (Applied Biosystems) for both tryptic peptide identification and quantification. The peptides and
corresponding relative abundances were obtained in ProteinPilot using a confidence cutoff (called a 'Prot Score')
of > 1.3 (> 95%). Database searching for each sample was
done on predicted tryptic peptide sequence data using
either the MSDB database (Release 20063108, Hammersmith Campus of Imperial College London) or in-house
databases (Vitis_spp_ORF_db_v1.0, untrimmed, or AS
databases). Annotations and annotated protein names
indicated in ProteinPilot output files were coded to indicate several parameters specific to the ORF identified as
well as the EST or contig from which the ORF sequence
was predicted.

iTRAQ data representing the four ripening initiation
stages in each of the three exocarp samples (2004, 20051, 2005-2) were combined into a single tab delimited file.
Likewise, iTRAQ data representing each of the three mesocarp samples (2004, 2005-1, 2005-2) were combined
into a second tab delimited file. Duplicate entries among
exocarp or mesocarp files were identified using an inhouse script in the R environment with 'Custom ORF ID'
as the search string. Then, ratiometric data at each of the
three comparisons using 'green' as the reference stage (i.e.
pink/green; red/green; purple/green) were averaged prior

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:50

to export for cluster analyses. Entries with the same name
but different template cDNA sources were not averaged
since these may represent isoforms from different source
tissues and/or cultivars. We chose to cluster all proteins
detected in the exocarp or mesocarp in order to capture all
information on expression patterns detected, without
restricting our analyses to only those proteins that were
replicated amongst the individual exocarp or mesocarp
files. K-means clustering into four partitions was carried
out on ratiometric data for the exocarp and mesocarp files
separately using MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) software
(The Institute for Genome Research; http://www.tm4.org/
mev.html). We used a 1.5-fold threshold for biological
significance which was validated by consistencies between
trends in protein expression presented here as increasing
or decreasing with corresponding patterns of gene expression identified in previous publications (see Figure 4 legend for citations).

Results
Protein detection and annotation
In order to strengthen the ability of MS/MS spectra annotation software such as ProteinPilot to accurately identify
peptide sequences in complex total protein samples, we
performed weighted clustering on a large EST collection
generated from Vitis spp. to create the most cultivar-specific peptide map database possible for Cabernet Sauvignon. In addition, we created Perl scripts in order to find
the N and C termini in translated ORFs or otherwise to
carry out trimming at known tryptic digestion sites. This
was done to help decrease the number of incorrectly
annotated, non-tryptic (i.e. truncated) N- and/or C-terminal peptides incorporated into protein abundance quantitations. To further increase the number of identifiable
peptides, our in-house scripts searched all of the predicted
ORFs designated as containing a likely start methionine
using SignalP to identify and remove putative N-terminal
signal peptides, resulting in a database containing mature
protein sequence data for the predicted full length proteins.

To assess whether the custom tryptic peptide database
improved protein discovery, we examined the number of
high confidence proteins and peptides identified by ProteinPilot using this database versus a common approach
to annotation, a search of the MSDB. We performed this
analysis on two iTRAQ data sets, mesocarp 2005-1 and
exocarp 2005-1, derived from four stages of Cabernet Sauvignon berries at ripening initiation. At a confidence level
of 95% (p < 0.05), 1424 proteins were identified in the
mesocarp using the custom database, whereas only 1184
proteins were identified in a search of the same data set
using the MSDB (Table 1). At a confidence level of 95%,
1493 proteins were identified in the exocarp using the custom database, whereas 1390 proteins were identified in a
search of the same data set using the MSDB (Table 1).
These results indicate that in these two iTRAQ data sets,
the use of the custom tryptic peptide database improved
high confidence protein discovery by 20.2% and 7.4%.
The number of high confidence peptides detected using
the custom database was 1.9-fold and 1.8-fold higher in
mesocarp and exocarp, respectively, in comparison to
searches of the same iTRAQ data sets using the MSDB
(Table 1). The greater difference in the number of high
confidence peptides versus proteins detected using the
custom database in comparison to the MSDB indicates
that the most important impact of implementing the custom database was that it afforded the identification of
more high confidence peptides per protein than could be
achieved using the MSDB.
The effects of weighting and trimming on high confidence
peptide and protein detection were analyzed using the
2005 exocarp iTRAQ data set. We performed a second
build of all Vitis spp. ESTs using PCAP. For the purposes
of this comparative analysis, all ESTs in this second build
were equally weighted for consensus sequence determination using an arbitrary phred score; no higher weighting of
Cabernet Sauvignon-derived ESTs was used. This
unweighted Vitis EST database was then used to generate
a second predicted tryptic peptide database, including

trimming of end-truncated peptides, as before. The
number of high confidence peptides and proteins
detected were similar using the ORF databases created
from the weighted versus the unweighted EST databases
(Table 1), suggesting that the effect of simple nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) among the Vitis spp. ESTs is ultimately negligible at the level of peptide identification via
MS/MS in grapevine. The effectiveness of trimming predicted end-truncated peptides, on the other hand, was evident in the increased number of peptides identified (Table
1) by ProteinPilot in searches of the trimmed (default)
ORF database versus a third, untrimmed custom Vitis ORF
database that we created for this comparison by omitting
the trimming step shown in Figure 1; both of these databases were weighted for Cabernet Sauvignon ESTs in the
original PCAP builds. These findings indicate that automated searching for the best predicted methionine start
site and removing truncated N- and/or C-terminal tryptic
peptide sequences in predicted ORFs based upon EST data
increases the ability of MS/MS spectra annotation software to identify peptide sequences with high statistical
confidence.
Technical and biological replication of expression ratios
Proteins identified in iTRAQ data sets from two technical
replicates were analyzed. Two 100 μg aliquots from the
same total protein sample, exocarp 2004, were separately
labeled with iTRAQ reagents, subjected to nanoLC-MS/
MS, and the custom predicted tryptic peptide database
was searched with the resulting spectra using ProteinPilot.
Only proteins that were detected in each of the four ripening initiation stages were retained for the comparative
analysis. In-house custom scripts written in R language
[20] were employed to detect protein entries that were
duplicated in the two ProteinPilot output files representing the technical replicates, using 'Custom ORF ID' as the
search string. Out of a total of 1741 proteins detected in
both iTRAQ data sets, 507 or 29% of these proteins were
detected in both files (Additional file 1), whereas the
remainder were unique to either technical replicate with
547 proteins in one file and 687 proteins in the other. We
were interested in estimating consistency in trends in
expression data along ripening initiation for each replicated protein entry that we detected (Additional file 1).
We determined that strict estimation of replicability via
Pearson's correlation coefficient or concordance correlation coefficient analyses of expression ratios did not provide relevant quantitative information (data not shown),
since even small deviations in expression ratios can result
in poor correlative data. We considered that identifying
consistent trends in protein accumulation above an arbitrary cutoff such as 1.5-fold was most relevant for the purposes of discovering protein candidates for hypothesis
formulation related to ripening control. As an alternate
approach to correlation estimation, a replication scoring

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/50

system was devised, whereby expression ratios identified
by manual inspection as differing by less than log2(0.3)
for each duplicate protein entry for at least two of the
three ratios received a score of 1, expression ratios differing by between log2(0.3) and log2(0.6) for at least two of
the three ratios received a score of 2, and expression ratios
differing by log2(0.6) or greater for at least two of the three
ratios received a score of 3. The mean replication score for
the 507 duplicated protein entries in the technical replicates was determined to be 1.7 ± 0.7 (Additional file 1);
17% of the protein entries received a score of 3. These data
indicate that if a 1.5-fold change or greater is considered
as biologically relevant, over 80% of duplicate protein
entries but only approximately one quarter of all proteins
detected in two technical replicates would be expected to
be identified as significantly changing along ripening initiation with similar quantitative trends, based on the technical replicates analyzed here.
Proteins identified in iTRAQ analyses of two biological
replicates, exocarp 2004 and exocarp 2005-1 were next
analyzed in an identical manner to the two technical replicates. Out of a total of 2187 proteins detected in the two
iTRAQ data sets, 718 or 33% of these proteins were
detected in both files (Additional file 2), whereas the
remainder were unique to either biological replicate with
733 proteins in one file and 736 proteins in the other. The
same replication scoring system was implemented for
proteins detected in both iTRAQ data sets (Additional file
2) as was done for the technically replicated proteins
(Additional file 1), above. The mean replication score for
the 718 proteins common to both biological replicates
was determined to be 1.6 ± 0.7 (Additional file 2); 12% of
protein entries received a score of 3.
To further explore the biological significance of replicability analyses, proteins common to either the technical replicates (Additional file 1; 507 proteins) or the biological
replicates (Additional file 2; 547 proteins) were compared
and it was determined that 343 protein entries were common to the technical replicates and the biological replicates, i.e. were detected in all three data sets analyzed for
replication (Additional file 3); we considered this
approach as valid since all data analyzed here were
derived from the exocarp. The technical and biological
replication results indicate that the 'shotgun' LC-MS/MS
approach employed here with iTRAQ-labeled exocarp
total proteins is capable of repeatedly identifying approximately one third of the total number of proteins, whether
they are technical or biological replicates.
Expression profiling of proteins along grape berry ripening

(91 proteins), increasing gradually (621 proteins), not
changing significantly (1156 proteins), or decreasing (570
proteins), respectively, from the green through the fully
turned ripening initiation stages (Figure 2). Additional file
4 lists proteins by cluster number along with corresponding log2-transformed ratiometric data for each protein
entry. Ratiometric data were calculated relative to the
green stage for each of the pink/turning, red, and purple/
fully turned stages. Several protein isoforms significantly
increasing along ripening initiation were identified with
annotated functions in anthocyanin flavonoid biosynthesis and storage (e.g. flavanone-3-hydroxylase, flavonoid3'-hydroxlase, flavonoid-3'5'-hydroxylase and its associated cytochrome b5 protein, anthocyanin synthase,
anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyl transferase, putative anthocyanin O-methyltransferase), defense (e.g. pathogenesis-

related protein 4, thaumatin (VvTL1)), and cell expansion
(e.g. expansin, aquaporin). Conversely, several components of the photosynthetic machinery were identified as
decreasing greater than 1.5-fold along ripening initiation,
which is consistent with a reduction in photosynthesis at
this period of berry development.
We mined the exocarp data (Additional file 4) for proteins
that were increasing in abundance relative to the green
stage and annotated as enzyme or transporter components of pathways leading to hypothesized regulators of
ripening initiation in grapes, ABA, glucose, and BR. A
putative LytB (IspH) protein (Q9FEP0; Adonis aestivalis cv.
palaestina) increased 1.6-fold in abundance and is
responsible for the last step of the plastidic pathway to
isopentenyl diphosphate (IDP), leading in part to the pro-

duction of the plant hormones, ABA and gibberellic acid.
Other proteins of this MEP pathway were also detected
but only as slightly increasing in abundance along ripening initiation. An isopentenyl-diphosphate δ-isomerase I
protein was detected as increasing 2-fold along ripening
initiation (Q39472; Clarkia breweri; Q6EJD1; Pueraria
montana); this enzyme controls a major early step in isoprenoid biosynthesis and is likely localized to the chloroplast. We identified one component specific to the ABA
biosynthetic pathway, a protein similar to violaxanthin
de-epoxidase from tea (Q8S4C2; Camellia sinensis), which
was stably expressed along ripening initiation. Cytosolic
IDP, potentially also formed in the plastid and exported
to the cytoplasm, is incorporated in the biosynthesis of
BRs. A putative grapevine ortholog to a BR biosynthetic
protein from pea, PsLKB, (Q9ATR0; Pisum sativum), was
identified as increasing 1.6-fold, peaking at the third (red)
stage tested. A grapevine hexose transporter (VvHT6;
Q4VKB3) was identified as increasing 1.5-fold, which is
consistent with hexose accumulation during ripening initiation. Few proteins annotated with signal transduction
functions were detected in any of the four clusters that
could hypothetically be involved in ABA, glucose, and/or
BR signaling. Abscisic stress response protein (VvASR;
Q94G23) was previously implicated in cross-talk between
ABA and glucose signaling [21]; expression data were variable, with some isoforms increasing up to 4-fold along
ripening initiation and others showing stable expression.
A putative pirin protein of unknown function increased
4.5-fold along ripening initiation. A putative ortholog to
the Malus spp. TTG1 WD40 repeat protein (Q9M610),
which has previously been implicated in Arabidopsis in
the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis [22], was
detected as increasing, indicating that VvTTG1 could play
a similar role in the grape exocarp; a caveat is that the confidence level for VvTTG1 unique peptide detection was
less than 95%. Curiously, we did not identify peptides
representing VvMYBA1, which is highly expressed at the
transcriptional level during ripening initiation and
encodes a transcription factor previously demonstrated to
positively regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in
grape [23].
Four clusters were generated for the mesocarp in which
trends in protein accumulation were increasing strongly
(58 proteins), increasing gradually (502 proteins), not
changing significantly (1148 proteins), or decreasing (491
proteins), respectively, from the green through the fully
turned ripening initiation stages (Figure 3). Additional file
5 lists proteins by cluster number along with corresponding log2-transformed ratiometric data for each protein
entry, relative to the green stage. Similar to the exocarp
data, we identified > 2-fold accumulation of several protein isoforms annotated with functions in cell enlargement (e.g. expansins, aquaporins), fruit softening (e.g.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/50

polygalacturonase, pectate lyase) and defense (e.g. pathogenesis-related proteins) concomitant with a significant
reduction in proteins inhibitory to fruit ripening (e.g.
polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein).
We mined the mesocarp data (Additional file 5) for proteins annotated as enzyme or transporter components of
pathways leading to ABA, glucose, and brassinosteroid
accumulation. We detected VvNCED2 (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 2; Q5SGD0) increasing over 2-fold
along ripening initiation, which represents expression of
a key committed step specifically in ABA biosynthesis in
the plastid [24]. A protein annotated as ABA glucosyltransferase increased 1.25-fold along ripening initiation
in the mesocarp. As in the exocarp, an isopentenyldiphosphate δ-isomerase I was detected as increasing 2fold along ripening initiation (Q6EJD1; Pueraria lobata),
plus, a putative cytosolic isoform was detected as stably
expressed (Nicotiana tabacum; Q9AVG7) [25]. Farnesyl
diphosphate synthase, a cytoplasmic enzyme leading to
the BR biosynthetic pathway via squalene biosynthesis,
was detected in the mesocarp as increasing 1.4-fold along
ripening initiation. A putative grapevine ortholog to the
BR biosynthetic protein in pea, PsLKB, (Q9ATR0; Pisum
sativum), and in cotton, GhDWARF1 (Q2QCX8; Gossypium hirsutum), was detected as increasing 1.4-fold. The
hexose transporter, VvHT6, was detected as increasing 2fold, similar to its expression pattern that was detected in
the exocarp. We mined the mesocarp data further to identify proteins annotated with signal transduction functions. No plasma membrane receptor candidates were
identified as increasing but several were identified as not
changing or decreasing along ripening initiation, most
notably a receptor-like kinase similar to PERK1-like protein from rice (Q6ZIG4) that decreased 1.5-fold at the
onset of pigment accumulation to 2.5-fold at the purple
stage; this PERK1-like protein was also identified as significantly decreasing in the exocarp (Additional file 4). The
same pirin protein identified in the exocarp was similarly
detected as increasing in the mesocarp along ripening initiation. Inconsistent iTRAQ data were obtained for VvASR
in the mesocarp with isoforms showing an increase, stable
expression, or strong down-regulation.
A custom script written in the R environment was used to
search for proteins common to the combined exocarp and
mesocarp files (Additional files 4 and 5) using 'Custom
ORF ID' as the search string. Protein isoforms detected in
common between exocarp and mesocarp (1147 in total)
are shown in Additional file 6. Protein isoforms detected
only in exocarp (1149 in total) are shown in Additional
file 7. Protein isoforms detected only in mesocarp (905 in
total) are shown in Additional file 8. Isoforms of anthocyanin flavonoid biosynthetic proteins were only detected
in the exocarp, which is consistent with induction timing

of exocarp and mesocarp for proteomic analyses. Additional file 9 shows the source tissues and number of
unique high confidence peptides per protein for those
proteins indicated here in the Results section and in Figure

Discussion
The iTRAQ data obtained with exocarp and mesocarp
total proteins confirmed previous ratiometric transcript
abundance data for key components of ABA and BR biosynthesis, as well as the influx and accumulation of sugars
during ripening initiation (Figure 4). We confirmed for
the first time the strong accumulation of several components of anthocyanin biosynthesis at the protein level,

including a putative anthocyanin O-methyltransferase.
The detection of VvNCED2 accumulation confirmed previous real-time RT-PCR data [26] and further supports a
role specifically for this NCED family member in ABA biosynthesis in the mesocarp during berry ripening initiation.
Based on the sensitivity limitations to the shotgun proteomic technique employed here, we cannot conclude
that VvNCED2 accumulation, activity, and, consequently,
ABA biosynthesis are localized to the mesocarp;
VvNCED2 may be expressed in the exocarp but we did not
detect it. The previous detection of ζ-carotene desaturase
transcripts in the exocarp [27] argues against a model in
which ABA is synthesized in the mesocarp and transported to the exocarp whereupon it activates, in part,
anthocyanin biosynthesis. If the primary site of ABA production in the developing fruit is the seed, however, and

ABA transported from the seed to the surrounding pericarp is an early signaling event initiating ripening, as we
have previously hypothesized [26], it is reasonable that
the first tissue in the pericarp in which ABA is synthesized
is the mesocarp, given its closer proximity to the seed than
the exocarp. It remains to be determined whether a gradient in ABA biosynthesis during early ripening stages pro-

ceeds from the seed through the mesocarp and, finally, in
the exocarp. The presence and possible moderate accumulation of a putative ABA glucosyltransferase indicates that
an attenuating mechanism for the ABA signal may operate
during ripening initiation to control ABA homeostasis
[28]. The accumulation of the pirin protein is also intriguing, given this protein's previously demonstrated interac-

tion with G-protein alpha in Arabidopsis seeds and a
potential role in modifying ABA action via negative feedback control [29].
We used a relatively new quantitative MS/MS-based
approach, iTRAQ, to advance our understanding of differential protein expression underlying non-climacteric ripening initiation in grape berries. The iTRAQ approach
offered several advantages over 2DGE methods for protein discovery, including increased detection sensitivity
based on our findings reported here in comparison to previous reports on grape berry proteomics. By using strong
cation exchange and reverse phase column microcapillary
chromatography coupled with nanospray MS/MS detection with total protein extracts from grape berries, we were
able to resolve three-fold or more proteins per sample
than would be expected using 2DGE [11,12,14]. One current limitation to an MS-based proteomic approach with
grapevine is that there are no finished genome sequence
data for grapevine, although two projects [30,31] are
undertaking assembly and annotation from which a high
quality ORFeome database can eventually be derived.
Although there are over 300,000 Vitis spp. ESTs deposited
in Genbank, V. vinifera is a highly heterozygous species
[31]; therefore, we considered that it might be important
to weight builds of these ESTs via manipulation of phred
scores so as to favor sequence data corresponding to our
cultivar of interest, Cabernet Sauvignon, when SNPs were
encountered by PCAP, where applicable for a given contig
assembly. Although we determined that weighting ESTs to
the genotype of interest for EST assembly provided no
clear advantages in this study, we conclude that producing
a tryptic peptide database targeted to Vitis sequences and
including removal of predicted truncated peptides
improved protein detection and annotation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that a tryptic peptide database
based on finished Pinot Noir whole genome sequence
data will be valid to implement for proteome studies with
any V.vinifera cultivar or Vitis species, with the exception
of cases where deletions have occurred in the Pinot Noir
homozygous line [30].
We chose to not include genome sequence data available
for V. vinifera cv. Pinot Noir [30,31] due to significant
gaps in current assemblies and the potential for inaccurate
automated gene predictions. Until grapevine genome
sequence assembly and annotation are finished, we propose that the predicted ORF database presented here will
be of value to the grapevine community in two significant
ways. While gaps exist in the genome sequence assemblies, the protein database presented here may provide
information for 'missing' proteins either not yet predicted
from the Pinot Noir genome sequence data and/or other
Vitis spp. not represented in the Pinot Noir genome
sequence data, e.g. due to chromosomal deletions. Fur-

ther, protein predictions based upon expressed sequences
(ESTs) represent 'real' proteins, so our database could
potentially be used to validate ORF predictions based on
whole genome sequence data alone.
While iTRAQ labeling coupled with nanoLC-MS/MS
proved overall to be an advance over 2DGE in sensitivity
and quantitation, consistent detection of predicted protein sequences between technical or biological replicates
from grape exocarp was limited. Consistency in trends in
ratiometric data along ripening initiation for those proteins that were detected in replicate exocarp samples was
further limited. Inconsistent ratiometric data for some
proteins detected in both biological replicates may represent differences in expression due, for example, to variability in seasonal growing conditions and not technical
variability. Nonetheless, limited replicable detection of
proteins among biological samples for technical reasons
is commonly encountered with liquid chromatography
and MS-based proteomics [32] and could arise from variation in preparation of total proteins and/or iTRAQlabeled peptides from sample to sample. Underlying the
apparent variation arising from sample preparations are
constraints on detection imposed by the mass spectrometer, both with respect to the dynamic range of the instrument and the nature of selections of peptides in the first
MS by the MS software for export to the collision cell prior
to amino acid detection via the second MS. Furthermore,
our finding that two thirds of the replicated exocarp proteins were detected both in technical and biological replicates may have reflected the higher probability of
detecting these mainly abundant, housekeeping-type proteins in any given total protein sample using a shotgun
approach.
Over-sampling of abundant peptides in digested total protein samples is a limitation of the shotgun approach to
quantitative proteomics [33] and likely precluded our
ability to discover more proteins annotated with signal
transduction functions that could regulate ABA, BR, and
hexose responses during ripening initiation. In order to
increase detection sensitivity of low abundance regulatory
proteins using shotgun proteomics techniques, it will
likely be helpful to isolate membrane and nuclear proteins separately from cytoplasmic proteins prior to digestions. Affinity chromatography of berry protein extracts
using antibodies directed against abundant proteins such
as thaumatin detected in both exocarp and mesocarp may
also improve detection sensitivity for low abundance proteins by selectively removing these proteins prior to
iTRAQ labeling steps. Similarly, advances in detection
sensitivity in devices such as the Fourier transform ion
cyclotron resonance MS (FTICR-MS) [34] should allow us
to delve deeper into the grape berry proteome in order to
better understand the molecular control of non-climac-

teric ripening in this species. Nonetheless, the searchable
quantitative data presented here on over 3000 proteins
detected in two separate berry tissues along four ripening
initiation stages can serve as a framework public resource
contributing towards our understanding of the dynamic
grapevine proteome.

Conclusion
We determined that a predicted peptide database can be
derived from grapevine EST data using advanced clustering and trimming approaches and successfully implemented for quantitative proteome profiling. We
demonstrated in grapevine that by implementing a predicted peptide database targeted to an organism of interest, a significant increase in the number of high
confidence peptides identified and annotated from MS/
MS data was gained in comparison to more commonly
used MSDB searches. Furthermore, by using a shotgun
quantitative proteomics approach in combination with a
targeted predicted peptide database, we showed that
greater numbers of high confidence peptides were
detected than would be expected using 2D gel electrophoresis techniques. We verified for the first time at the
protein level, quantitative expression patterns for components of isoprenoid and flavonoid metabolism important
for grape compositional chemistry, as well as identified
new signal transduction candidate proteins associated
with non-climacteric ripening initiation in grape berries.
