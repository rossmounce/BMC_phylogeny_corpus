Abstract
Background: Complete genome sequences of the Astroviridae include human, non-human
mammalian and avian species. A consensus topology of astroviruses has been derived from
nucleotide substitutions in the full-length genomes and from non-synonymous nucleotide
substitutions in each of the three ORFs. Analyses of synonymous substitutions displayed a loss of
tree structure, suggesting either saturation of the substitution model or a deviant pattern of
synonymous substitutions in certain virus species.
Results: We analyzed the complete Astroviridae family for the inference of adaptive molecular
evolution at sites and in branches. High rates of synonymous mutations are observed among the
non-human virus species. Deviant patterns of synonymous substitutions are found in the capsid
structural genes. Purifying selection is a dominant force among all astrovirus genes and only few
codon sites showed values for the dN/dS ratio that may indicate site-specific molecular adaptation
during virus evolution. One of these sites is the glycine residue of a RGD motif in ORF2 of human
astrovirus serotype 1. RGD or similar integrin recognition motifs are present in nearly all astrovirus
species.
Conclusion: Phylogenetic analysis directed by maximum likelihood approximation allows the
inclusion of significantly more evolutionary history and thereby, improves the estimation of dN and
dS. Sites with enhanced values for dN/dS are prominent at domains in charge of environmental
communication (f.i. VP27 and domain 4 in ORF1a) more than at domains dedicated to intrinsic virus
functions (f.i. VP34 and ORF1b (the virus polymerase)). Integrin recognition may play a key role in
astrovirus to target cell attachment.

Background
Human astrovirus has been recognized as the second
most common cause of diarrhoea among children under
5 years old [1]. In animal and bird farms, an astrovirus
infection is fatal for a considerable part of the livestock
[2,3]. The family of Astroviridae is divided in two genera:

Mamastrovirus (mammalian astroviruses) and Avastrovirus
(avian astroviruses). The pathogen is a non-enveloped virion with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of approximately 6.8 kb in size [4]. The virus genome contains three
open reading frames designated ORF1a (2.8 kb), ORF1b
(1.6 kb) and ORF2 (2.4 kb). Translation of ORF1b

depends on translation of ORF1a by a ribosomal frameshift mechanism [5]. The primary translation products are
processed into the virus protease (ORF1a) and the virus
polymerase (ORF1b). ORF2 encodes a structural protein
that is intracellularly processed at the C-terminal part by
caspase protease, by which genome packaging and virus
particle release is promoted [6]. As part of the released
virus particle, ORF2 protein is processed further by trypsin
to acquire the mature capsid proteins VP34 and VP27/25,
a process accompanied by a considerable increase of virus
infectivity [7]. Consensus on the post-translational
processing routes of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 polyproteins has not yet been attained [8,9].
An inventory of evolutionary relationships among astroviruses has been published confirming the topology that is
generally accepted for the astroviruses and pointing to a
strong selection against non-synonymous substitutions
[10]. Phylogenetic analyses based solely on the synonymous substitutions resulted in loss of tree structure due to
the shortening of specific ancestral branches in trees of all
ORFs. Avian, sheep, and human virus species appeared to
be virtually equidistant in these trees. Such a loss of tree
structure or tree compression may be interpreted either as
the result of saturation of synonymous substitutions or to
a peculiar pattern of synonymous substitutions that is typical for specific members of the astrovirus family. To
address this issue, we analyze the astrovirus genes by
means of nucleotide substitution models based on maximum likelihood approximation because these models are
better suited for the estimation of mutational rates in
highly divergent genes than models relying on the JukesCantor correction for multiple hits at the same site.
Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood
(PAML3.14) [11] offers a set of sophisticated models to
assess the extent of (non-) synonymous substitutions in
genes. The current status of the PAML programs displays a
profound documentation for the inference of sites and
branches prone to molecular adaptation and is supported
by validated statistics [12-14]. For instance, adaptive evolution is observed in the hemagglutinin gene of human
influenza virus type A [15].
Applying PAML to the genes of the complete astrovirus
family, we show that tree compression (shortening of
ancestral branches) can be ascribed to deviant rates of synonymous mutation at discrete regions of ORF2 in certain
astrovirus species. Tree compression is absent in ORF1a
and ORF1b as revealed by PAML due to its ability to
include more evolutionary history. Sites that tend to
escape from purifying selection correlate to protein
domains dedicated to environmental communication
rather than to replication and assembly of the virus.
Finally, we propose that integrin recognition of ORF2

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/25

domains plays a key role in the process of cell binding by
astrovirus.

Results
(Non-) synonymous substitutions in astrovirus genes:
branch models
The values for dN/dS of the branch model applied to the
astrovirus ORFs are all far below the value of 1 (Table 1),
by convention considered as the lower limit for positive
selection. In fact, dN/dS values do not exceed 0.16, except
for ORF2 in the cat and human4 isolates (0.1904 and
0.2610, respectively). Obviously, purifying selection is
very dominant in branches specifying astrovirus species.
The individual values of dN and dS may be more easily
interpreted in a tree format (Fig 1) than as raw data in a
table. Unrooted dN and dS trees are part of PAML's output
and have been constructed by pasting the dN and dS values from Table 1 as branch length onto the amino acid
tree topology supplied to PAML as input tree file.

The dN trees of the three ORFs (Fig 1A) are in close agreement with the widely accepted astrovirus phylogeny
[10,16-21]. The ORFs evolve independently and mutational rates are lower in ORF1b than in ORF1a or ORF2 as
indicated by the different scale bars. Also, the relative
lengths of the individual branches mimic those in trees
inferred by other means. For instance, the sequence of
ORF2 in human astrovirus serotype 4 is known as the
most distant among the human ORF2 sequences [19].
Apparently, the alignment attained by the multi-step
MUSCLE procedure (see Materials & Methods) displayed
an average accuracy and is at least as good as more laborious ClustalW based protocols, despite the sequence diversity typical for the astrovirus data set.
Synonymous rates of mutation in astrovirus genes differ
from non-synonymous mutational rates by as much as
one to two orders of magnitude as indicated by the dN/dS
ratio in Table 1 and the scale bars in Fig 1B. Nevertheless,
dS trees of ORF1a and ORF1b based on synonymous substitutions are close to the corresponding trees derived
from non-synonymous substitutions or amino acid
replacements. Loss of tree structure [10] or tree compression caused by the virtual disappearance of ancestral
branches can hardly be observed illustrating the power of
the substitution model to incorporate multiple hits at the
same site. In contrast, loss of tree structure and shortening
of ancestral branches is observed in the dS tree of ORF2
and appears to be due to enhanced accumulation of synonymous substitutions in ORF2 sequences of the astroviruses of pig, sheep, mink and turkey compared to viruses
in humans, cats and both avian nephritis viruses.
The ORF2 regions coding for the virus capsid proteins
VP34 and VP27 may differ in the accumulation of synon-

The virus isolates available for analysis of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 are mentioned in the first column and specified by their accession numbers.
With respect to ORF2, one representative per human serotype was included. Separate values for dN and dS of the species' tip branches as well as
their ratios are presented for each ORF, individually. Values for dN/dS exceeding 0.15 are in italics. Ancestral branches were not included.

ymous substitutions. To test this, the ORF2 alignment was
divided in two portions based on the cleavage by trypsin.
VP34 is slightly more conserved than VP27, but most
ORF2 values are close to the average of the corresponding
values for VP34 and VP27 (Table 2). Indeed, dN trees of
VP34 and VP27 (not shown) are nicely deep-rooted and
nearly identical to the dN tree of the complete ORF2 (Fig
1A). By contrast, dS values of sheep virus capsids increase
from 36.5 in VP34 to 64.4 in VP27, while these values
decrease from 53.3 to 12.3 in mink. In pig, the difference
is even more dramatic, 60.6 in VP34 and only 4.8 in VP27.
Both turkey isolates exchange their dS values of about 20
and 33 for VP34 and VP27, respectively. Trees with values
for synonymous substitutions pasted as branch lengths
onto the same topology more clearly show the speciesspecific differences in synonymous mutational rates
between VP34 and VP27 (Fig 2). With respect to VP34,
tree compression is due to high values of dS in pig, sheep,
mink and turkey, similar to the results for ORF2. In the dS
tree of VP27, however, the sheep virus and to a lesser
extent both turkey viruses are responsible for tree compression. The viruses of pig and mink are essentially conforming the human, feline and avian viruses. Apparently,
the VP34 and VP27 domains tolerate considerable differences with respect to the extent of synonymous mutational rates as estimated by means of PAML. Similar to
ORF1a and ORF1b, the domains VP34 and VP27 of ORF2

display mutually independent patterns of molecular evolution.
Currently, it cannot be excluded that even PAML encounters saturation-related problems at high rates of mutation
in a properly aligned set of sequences [22]. However, this
may only be a partial explanation to the large variation of
synonymous mutational rates in adjacent domains of specific astrovirus genes and genomes.
Site models: dN/dS values in relation to domain functions
Site models of CODEML allow for the estimation of dN/
dS ratios at individual codon sites in an alignment of
sequences. Because of the skewed astrovirus population â
large distances between the few clades and overrepresentation of closely related human virus species â statistical
support was taken only from the Bayes-Empirical-Bayes
(BEB) output [14]. With respect to ORF2 of the human
virus species, we confined the analysis to one virus representative per human serotype (except for H1). All three
ORFs display sites that tend to escape from purifying
selection (Table 3). Posterior mean values of dN/dS for
BEB-selected sites are between 1 and 1.5 in all ORFs with
high standard errors and low posterior probabilities. Conventionally, a dN/dS value of 1 marks the transition from
neutral evolution to weakly positive selection. BEBselected sites (dN/dS = 1) are not distributed randomly in

ORF1a and ORF2 but appear to cluster. This is more easily
observed when all sites are plotted as a string of local dN/
dS values of the ORF's codons superimposed on a map of
virus functions embedded in the ORF as described in literature and/or predicted by servers (Fig 3). In ORF1a (Fig
3A), clusters with relatively high dN/dS values are located
around amino acid 620, at position 775, 777 and 812â
817. The 614â624 cluster maps near the N-terminus of
the nsp1a-4 domain. The exact position of this N-terminus is still under debate, being either T568 or I655 [8,23].
A coiled coil, a nuclear localization signal and a death
domain for the induction of cellular apoptosis are found
in this region [24]. Also, this part of ORF1a displays
enhanced amino acid variability and may be prone to Oglycosylation and phosphorylation. The BEB-selected sites
between 775â814 mark the borders of the interspecies

hypervariable region (760â838) that also harbors the
peptide that is deleted by cell culture adaptation of the
virus [25]. At the C-terminus, the ribosomal frame-shift
signal is decorated with a BEB-selected threonine residue
next to a predicted motif for retention at the endoplasmic
reticulum. As expected from the branch model analysis
(see above), sites with dN/dS values less than 0.1 constitute a large majority in ORF1a.
The dN/dS distribution in ORF1b illustrates the power of
purifying selection even more dramatically (Fig 3B).
Nearly all sites in the conserved polymerase domain have
dN/dS values far below 0.25 to 0.3 being the transition
region from purifying selection to neutral evolution. Outside the conserved domain, but within the virus polymerase, the asparagine residue at position 160 shows a

The Bayes-Emperical-Bayes (BEB) output of the CODEML NSsites model 8 for nucleotide substitution allows the selection of codon sites (as amino
acids) with a posterior mean value for dN/dS â¥ 1 and provides a standard error as well asa value for posterior probability. The position of the
selected amino acid in the alignment has been converted into the location in the H1Z25771 polyprotein. "Selection" in the ORF2 panel refers to the
limitation of one representative per human serotype in ORF2 analyses.

The dN/dS profile of ORF2 polyprotein (Fig 3C) clearly
shows the distinction between capsid functions either
dedicated to virus replication and assembly or involved in
environmental communication. The N-terminal VP34
protein is involved in the packaging of virus RNA.
Replacement of the much conserved threonine residue at
position 227, for instance, abolishes the formation of
virus particles due to loss of the ability to bind virus RNA
[26]. Nearly all sites in mature VP34 are under strong purifying selection, indicating the involvement of VP34 in
conserved virus functions. Mature VP25/27 encoded by
the C-terminal part of ORF2 constitutes the virus' spike
protein and carries the region of serotypic antibody recognition (580â606). Variation is beneficial for immune
escape and sequence homology decreases to levels that
locally even hamper a proper alignment of the available
data set. As a result, dN/dS values tend to increase towards
neutral evolution. The limited data set prevents a statistical discrimination between sites with dN/dS values = 1
due to either weak but bona fide positive selection or
merely site-specific heterogeneity. However, clusters of
sites with dN/dS values exceeding 1 can be observed. The
region 440â476 contains four amino acid residues with
dN/dS values of about 1.2 and constitutes the N-terminal
part of VP25. At the C-terminus of VP25 (633â681), 12
amino acids display dN/dS values = 1, with Q670 having
the highest dN/dS value of 1.481 Â± 0.205 with a posterior
probability of 0.953. Finally, two residues (I741 and
N775) with dN/dS values of about 1.2 reside in the C-terminal part of ORF2. Proteolysis by caspase of this region
is the first step in the maturation process of the ORF2
polyprotein [6]. RNA packaging and cellular release can-

not occur without cleavage by caspase, which in turn is
probably activated by the death domain in ORF1a.
Cell attachment by integrin recognition
The glycine residue at position 573 in ORF2 is among the
top three of all sites having a dN/dS value of 1.441 Â± 0.264
and a posterior probability of 0.901. Surprisingly, this
Gly573 is identified by PROSITE as the core residue of a
RGD tripeptide being a recognition sequence for cellular
attachment to an integrin-type cell surface receptor [27]. It
seems a paradox that a site prone to adaptive molecular
evolution also participates in an important replication
function. However, integrin binding can also be fulfilled
by similar motifs, for instance KGD, RHD, NGR and LDV,
and may be enhanced by synergy sites like the tripeptide
RNS [28]. RNS, KGD and RHD oligopeptides are absent in
the collection of ORFs2, but the integrin-binding motifs
RGD, LDV and NGR are present in astrovirus ORF2 except
for Turkey1 (Table 4). Most of these putative integrinbinding sequences are located in VP34 rather than in the
spike protein VP25. The LDV tripeptide is located at position 183 and NGR is present (sometimes even in duplicate) at the positions 17 and 51 of VP34 (H1Z25771
numbering).

Discussion
Previous research showed that avian astrovirus species displayed different topologies in trees based on either synonymous or non-synonymous substitutions suggesting a
deviant pattern of synonymous substitutions specifically
in these species [10]. More specifically, tree compression
due to shortening of ancestral branches caused loss of res-

olution among the non-human mammalian and the
avian species in all ORFs leaving solely the human serotypes properly resolved. Recently, we demonstrated a
switch in the recent evolution of Astroviridae driving the
synonymous codon usage in genes of specifically the nonhuman mammalian viruses towards the mean codon
usage in genes of their hosts [21]. The present study
employs phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood
approximation to assess the extent of (non-) synonymous
mutational rates at the expense of tree-building capacity.
Fortunately, there is consensus in literature on the phylogenetic topology of astrovirus species derived from amino
acid replacements or non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions [10,16-21]. This provides the opportunity to decorate a tree carrying this consensus topology with the
branch lengths estimated by PAML for synonymous or
non-synonymous substitutions in astrovirus ORFs. By
these means, we obtained standard-like trees without significant compression for astrovirus ORF1a and ORF1b,
despite the large extent of synonymous substitutions in
the non-human species. Apparently, substitution models
subjected to maximum likelihood approximation tolerate
considerably higher levels of mutational saturation than
"classic" substitution models relying on the Jukes-Cantor
correction for multiple hits at the same site and hence
allow the inclusion of significantly more evolutionary history during phylogenetic analysis. Improvement of dN
and dS estimation is the result.
With respect to astrovirus ORF2, the tree based on nonsynonymous substitutions is very much standard-like,
whereas the tree based on synonymous substitutions
clearly suffers from compression due to the extended
branch lengths of pig, sheep, mink and turkey astrovirus
species. A bipartition of ORF2 into the two regions encoding the VP34 and VP27 capsid proteins shows that the
branch extension of these species is observed in the VP34
domain, but confined to sheep and the turkeys in VP27.
In mink and particularly pig, enhanced rates of synonymous mutation are present in the VP34 domain, but
absent in the VP27 domain of ORF2. At present, we cannot offer a proper explanation for this species- and
domain-specific enhancement in the rates of synonymous
mutation. The consistency of dN trees with data in literature [10,16-20] argues against an improper alignment of
the astrovirus sequences. It is conceivable that the substitution model applied reaches its limit at a certain level in
the rate of mutation. However, VP34 carries the majority
of elongated branch lengths, but is slightly better conserved than its ORF2 colleague VP27. The avian clade may
pose a biological argument relevant to the problem. As
shown above, turkey astroviruses consistently do and
avian nephritis viruses do not display branch length
extension indicating a possibly relevant difference
between these species. Investigation at the source of the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/25

sequences involved has pointed out that the sequences of
turkey species have been determined by RT-PCR of virus
RNA extracted directly from stools and organs [18,29],
whereas RNAs of avian nephritis virus have been prepared
from cell-culture supernatants after three consecutive
rounds of plaque purification before being subjected to
RT-PCR amplification [30]. It has already been mentioned
that adaptation of human astroviruses to grow in continuous cell lines induces a 45-nucleotide deletion near the
3'-end of ORF1a [25]. In coronavirus, mutations have
been associated with isolation and passage in primate cell
lines [31,32]. In conclusion, selection at the level of isolation and purification as well as mutation at the level of
propagation may affect the difference between the rates of
synonymous and non-synonymous substitution in astrovirus genes. Future research may address this issue.
The relationship between negative and positive selection
carries an antagonistic character. Random mutations that
may be a menace to intrinsic virus functionality are
meshed during cycles of virus replication and propagation
and are subsequently removed from the virus population
leading to conservation of the sequences involved. Astrovirus protease, polymerase and VP34 are exemplary for
this process of negative or rather purifying selection. Positive selection of substitutions on the other hand occurs in
response to environmental changes and hence is also designated as molecular adaptation or adaptive molecular
evolution. Obviously, sites prone to positive selection
may be expected at domains in charge of communicative
functionality like host range and immune response. It is
therefore not surprising that sites belonging to the predicted serotypic epitope and to the putative RGD site for
cell attachment in astrovirus ORF2 as well as to the two
variable regions in astrovirus ORF1a display dN/dS values
indicative for weak positive selection. The two clusters
with dN/dS values >1 at the borders of VP25 may mark
adaptive responses to maintain the structure of the virus
spike protein allowing variability in the central part of
VP25 that carries the serotypic epitope. The range of neutral evolution (0.3 < dN/dS < 1) is not very popular in
astrovirus ORFs indicating that during evolution astrovirus has reached equilibrium between purifying selection
and molecular adaptation.
Our attempts to correlate positively selected sites with
virus functions also resulted in the identification of an
RGD recognition motif for cellular attachment present in
ORF2. In all astrovirus species (except Turkey1 isolate), an
integrin recognition motif is found in ORF2. One of these
(NGR) is located near the N-terminus. Bass and Qui [7]
have shown that the aminoterminal 70 amino acids of the
astrovirus ORF2 polyprotein can be deleted without consequences for virus assembly. Remarkably, they demonstrated this property for human astrovirus serotype 1

being the only species with all three integrin-binding
motifs present in the sequence. Data on the process of cell
entry by astrovirus have not been reported since 1992
[33]. Although experimental support is lacking, we tend
to propose that integrin recognition plays a key role in
astrovirus to target cell attachment.

Methods
Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML)
Sequences of astroviruses were obtained from GenBank
and annotated previously [10]. Recently obtained
sequences of mink [3] and human serotypes 4 and 5 [34]
were also included in the present study. GenBank accession numbers are mentioned in Table 1 (Results section).
The genomes of the astrovirus species include many
human species with high sequence homology and few
non-human mammalian and avian species, which are
very divergent. Initial charges of PAML 3.14 for the estimation of (non-) synonymous rates of mutation in astrovirus genes demonstrated the need of a proper alignment
of astrovirus sequences to avoid unconnected Markov
chains, likelihood convergence problems and a collapse
of the substitution model. Therefore, a novel strategy was
developed to obtain properly aligned astrovirus sequences
(Fig 4). In order to avoid overrepresentation of human
astrovirus species (ORF2 analyses only), we included one
specimen per human serotype except for human serotype
1. Besides a few point mutations, the human virus species
Z25771 differs from L23513 (and from the other astrovirus species as well) by the presence of the oligopeptide
that was reported to be deleted by cell culture adaptation
of astrovirus [25]. Multiple sequence comparison by logexpectation (MUSCLE) [35] was used for the alignment of
the polypeptide chains encoded by each astrovirus reading frame. A multi-step procedure was used. Firstly, three
separate protein alignments were generated from the
human, non-human mammalian and avian virus species,
respectively. Secondly, these three alignments were combined into a single alignment file for each astrovirus ORF
by means of the profile-profile operation of MUSCLE.
Thirdly, refinements were introduced manually (BioEdit)
[36] with special attention to sites near alignment gaps.
An amino acid neighbor-joining tree was constructed in
MEGA [37] and stored in newick format.

The PAL2NAL program was used for the conversion of a
sequence alignment of proteins into the corresponding
codon-based nucleotide alignment [38] that in turn was
used for input into the CODEML module of PAML3.14
[11]. Most CODEML settings have been adapted from the
small lysozyme data set of Yang [39]. The parameter-richness of the substitution model was effectively reduced by
choosing F3x4 for CodonFreq and by attaching foreground labels to tip branches of the input tree instead of
allowing a free determination of all these parameters. The

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/25

choice F3x4 specifies the use of the correct nucleotide frequency for each of the different codon positions in the
ORF involved [21]. Tree and branch labels were inspected
for their integrity (TreeViewX) [40]. In order to apply the
site models of CODEML, the parameter "model" was set
to zero and "NSsites" was set to 0, 1, 2, 7 and 8 specifying
different models of dN/dS variation to run in one batch
[41].
This multi-step MUSCLE procedure for optimal sequence
alignment required considerably less manual refinements
than a one-step ClustalW alignment. It takes the PAL2NAL
program only a few seconds to convert a collection of
nucleotide sequences into a multiple sequence alignment
of codons corresponding to the parent amino acid alignment. A single charge of 200 PAML iterations takes 4 to 24
hours of calculation on a P4/2.8 GHz with 504 MB of
RAM under XP/SP1 depending on the length of the alignment and the number of species. Values of dN and dS in
the branch models and of the ratio dN/dS in the site models of CODEML represent the number of (non-) synonymous substitutions per (non-) synonymous site corrected
for multiple hits at the same site according to the PAML
model in charge.
Server support and program downloads were received
from CBS [42], PROSITE [43], PAML [44], MUSCLE [45]
and PAL2NAL [46].
