Abstract
Background: To combat the pandemic of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), a successful vaccine will need
to cope with the variability of transmissible viruses. Human hosts infected with HIV-1 potentially harbour many viral
variants but very little is known about viruses that are likely to be transmitted, or even if there are viral
characteristics that predict enhanced transmission in vivo. We show for the first time that genetic divergence
consistent with a single transmission event in vivo can represent several years of pre-transmission evolution.
Results: We describe a highly unusual case consistent with a single donor transmitting highly related but distinct
HIV-1 variants to two individuals on the same evening. We confirm that the clustering of viral genetic sequences,
present within each recipient, is consistent with the history of a single donor across the viral env, gag and pol
genes by maximum likelihood and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo based phylogenetic analyses. Based on an
uncorrelated, lognormal relaxed clock of env gene evolution calibrated with other datasets, the time since the
most recent common ancestor is estimated as 2.86 years prior to transmission (95% confidence interval 1.28 to
4.54 years).
Conclusion: Our results show that an effective design for a preventative vaccine will need to anticipate extensive
HIV-1 diversity within an individual donor as well as diversity at the population level.

Background
A successful HIV-1 vaccine would be designed based
upon the antigenicity of transmissible viruses. At the
global level, multiple subtypes with evidence of on-going
evolution [1] result in a level of diversity that has
already frustrated all efforts to synthesize a universal
HIV-1 vaccine [2]. Additionally, substantial virus diversity develops within a single host during chronic infection [3], and it is unclear which viral variants are
transmissible to a new host. Recent efforts have concentrated on inferring variant transmissibility by

characterizing the precise genetic and antigenic features
of viruses found during very early stages of infection
[4-9].
Single viral variants are detected in a significant proportion of new HIV-1 infections in vivo, indicating a
profound genetic bottleneck [6,10]. The degree of
genetic bottleneck has been associated with the route of
transmission [11-13]. Another factor associated with the
number of infecting variants is the presence of genitourinary infections [10]. Together, these data suggest that
differences in the degree of genetic bottleneck are
related to variations in mucosal defence and its integrity.
However, the actual mechanism of this genetic bottleneck remains unclear, and studies may be confounded
by variations in both the risk of transmission among
donors and the diversity of transmissible virions within
donors [9]. The highest risk of transmission occurs

during primary infection when the population size of
infectious virus peaks [14]. However, viral diversity
within the acutely-infected donor is limited, potentially
making transmitted viruses indistinguishable in the recipient [4-6,11,15].
Furthermore, genetic analysis has also indicated that
mucosal defence and integrity are not the only explanations for the apparent genetic bottleneck. Demographic
models have been developed that avoid unsupported
prior assumptions about the degree of genetic bottleneck [16]. Viral variability was compared [9] in gag and
env genes after transmission in mother-to-child transmission cases and in men who have sex with men
(MSM). Viral variability after transmission was not consistently associated with the route of transmission [9]. In
addition, a severe genetic bottleneck may be a sufficient,
but not a necessary, condition for random transmission
of genetic variability [9].
If transmission of viral variability is not random, then
transmission may occur by natural selection [17,18].
However, transmissibility has not yet been associated
with specific viral characteristics. Most new, sexuallytransmitted HIV-1 infections are CCR5-tropic [4,19],
but this may reflect biased representation of these variants in genital fluids [20,21]. In eight cases of heterosexual transmission of subtype C [22], transmitted
variants tended to have fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNLGSs) and shorter hypervariable loops
than the average variant in the donor host. In addition,
recipient env-pseudotyped virus was more susceptible to
neutralization by donor serum than donor env-pseudotyped virus [22]. A study of 35 subtype A cases from
Kenya, and 13 subtype B cases from the USA [23] found
that recently-infected persons had viruses with shorter,
less-glycosylated V1V2 loops compared with a database
of viruses [23]. However, studies of subtype B have not
shown a consistent decrease in hypervariable loop length
or the number of PNLGSs [24,25]. Therefore, there is
no firm evidence that natural selection determines
transmission of viral variants.
Animal models of HIV infection that use the closelyrelated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) have also
demonstrated that many different variants circulating
within the host are transmissible. A low-dose, intrarectal
inoculum of SIV was given to 18 rhesus macaques [26]
to mimic physiological concentrations. Although
between one and five variants initiated new infections,
the viruses transmitted to all macaques collectively
reflected the diversity within the inoculum [26]. Another
study [27] demonstrated a stochastic pattern of V1V2
variant transmission from an inoculum. Therefore, a
broad range of viruses circulating in a single donor may
be potentially transmissible at any one time, consistent

Page 2 of 14

with the hypothesis that transmission of viral variants is
a random process.
To demonstrate that this lack of predictability is also
true for HIV-1 transmission in humans, we present an
unusual case consistent with a clinical history of one
male having transmitted significantly divergent HIV-1
variants to two recipients on the same evening. We
show that, as with macaques, diversity in early infection
is limited and compatible with transmission of a single
variant to each recipient, but also that a single donor
can transmit two very different HIV-1 strains contemporaneously. Furthermore, we do not find any evidence
that this between-host genetic divergence is evidence of
selection pressure from either humoral or cellular
immunity during or since transmission. Finally, if transmission is a random process, we hypothesize that a protective vaccine would need to cover the breadth of
transmissible variation within individual donors as well
as population-wide diversity.

Results and Discussion
Case history of a single, third party exposure and recent
seroconversion

Two adult males, P1 and P2, reported a single sexual
encounter each with the same third-party that occurred
on day 0 (Figure 1). P1 and P2 reported subsequent
exposure only to each other prior to enrolment in the
Short Pulse AntiRetroviral Therapy at HIV seroConversion (SPARTAC) trial. Despite repeated efforts, the
third-party donor could not be traced. On day 6 postexposure, P1 presented to his primary care physician
with symptoms compatible with HIV seroconversion.
On day 25, P1 tested positive for HIV-1 by ELISA with
an incident result on a detuned ELISA, suggestive of
recent infection [28,29]. P2 had a positive HIV-1 PCR
and negative HIV-1 ELISA on day 22, and on day 35
was p24 positive, but negative by Murex ELISA (R&D
Systems, UK) [30]. The Murex ELISA was repeated on
day 56 and had become clearly positive. Although, the
Murex ELISA was positive in P1 earlier than in P2, the
result was consistent with reported between-host variability in both the duration of the pre-viraemic phase and
the timing of the appearance of markers of seroconversion [30,31]. Therefore, clinical and laboratory evidence
supported recent seroconversion in P1 and P2.
P1 and P2 were sampled on the same day when they
enrolled in the SPARTAC trial, 63 days post-exposure.
Both participants were randomized to receive no therapy. Plasma for sequencing was re-sampled on the same
date from both participants, on day 235 post-exposure.
P1 reported exposure to a fourth party after day 63 and
before day 235. Evidence of HIV-1 super-infection in P1
was seen on plasma collected at day 235 (data not

Figure 1 Clinical data for P1 compared with that of P2. The a.
CD4+ counts (/mm3) and b. log viral loads (copies/ml) for P1 (blue)
and P2 (red) are shown. P1 and P2 were exposed to the same third
party on day 0. P1 remained off therapy for 930 days post-exposure
whilst P2 progressed more rapidly and commenced HAART 249
days post-exposure. Plasma for baseline sequencing was collected
on day 63 but the CD4+ count or VL were not recorded. At day
245, P1 was diagnosed with acute HCV infection and had evidence
of super-infection in plasma collected at day 235, having been
exposed to a fourth person after day 63.

shown). On day 245, P1 was diagnosed with acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (Figure 1) having been
negative for HCV by PCR and antibody on day 29. He
commenced treatment with ribavirin and interferon
after day 245. Therefore, all time-points after day 63
were excluded from further phylogenetic analysis.
The CD4+ count and plasma viral load values for P1
and P2 are shown in Figure 1. Despite the same exposure, P1 and P2 followed different clinical courses. P1
maintained a CD4+ T cell count greater than 350 cells/
mm 3 during the first 310 days of untreated infection
compared with P2, who had only two CD4+ readings
greater than 350 cells/mm 3 over the first 249 days of
infection. The plasma viral load for P1 was consistently
lower than P2 after day 96, with the exception of a second peak reading in P1 taken on day 249, after the
detection of HIV-1 super-infection and acute HCV
infection. Therefore, P2 appeared to progress more
rapidly than P1.

Further clinical laboratory evidence was consistent
with the history of a single donor because the time
window for one participant to have infected the other
was short. Participants P1 and P2 were both positive
for p31 antigen on Western Blot on day 63. Therefore,
the minimum estimated time since the onset of detectable viraemia (> 50 copies/ml) of approximately 47.4
days [30,31]. Thus, the estimated maximum pre-viraemic phase for either participant was 15 to 16 days.
Since, the estimated pre-viraemic phase for HIV-1 lasts
between 7 and 25 days [30-33], one participant could
have infected the other only between day 7 and day 9
post-exposure to the third party. However, peak viral
load in acutely infected subjects is reached 7 or more
days after the onset of detectable viraemia [6,12,34]
and the infectiousness of a donor MSM is low if his
viral load is 400 copies/ml or less [35]. Therefore,
while the laboratory evidence did not exclude this
alternative scenario, it was unlikely that one participant
infected the other.
Sequences for phylogenetic analysis obtained from
multiple viral genes

If P1 and P2 had indeed been infected by the same
third person on the same night, we expected that viral
sequences sampled from one recipient would be highly
similar, or even identical, to sequences sampled from
the other recipient. We sampled fragments of three different HIV-1 genes, 63 days post-exposure (Figure 2).
The gene fragments were located within the env, gag
and pol genes. We sampled an env fragment from the
start of the gp160 coding region to the end of the gp120
coding region (HXB2 nucleotide position 6225 to 7757)
by single genome amplification (SGA)[4-6,12,13,36].
After 5% gap-stripping with GapStreeze, the env gene
fragment alignment was 1305 base pairs in length. The
more conserved gag p24 to p6 (HXB2 1471 to 1976)
and pol Reverse Transcriptase (RT, HXB2 2643 to 3428)
gene fragments were sampled by bacterial cloning [37].
We included reference sequences from individuals in
the same geographical area and demographic risk
group, drawn from the SPARTAC trial and the St
Mary’s Hospital Acute Infection Cohort [38], as well as
the LANL UK reference database. Trees were rooted
with outlier sequences from different HIV-1 subtypes
and non-M groups in the LANL database. Sequences
from both participants clustered with subtype B reference sequences in phylogenetic analyses of all three
genes. GenBank accession numbers for sequences from
the SPARTAC trial UK cohort and the St Mary’s Hospital Acute Infection Cohort in this study are FJ645274 to
FJ5645360, JF440652 to JF440693, JF499738 to
JF499786, JF506093 to JF506179, and JF692885 to
JF693023.

Figure 2 Trees generated for phylogenetic cluster analysis. Phylogenetics cluster analysis was carried out using day 63 viral sequences from
P1 and P2. Zoomed-in images of trees are shown in Figure 2 for the env fragment in a. and b., the gag fragment in c. and d., and the pol
fragment in e. and f.. Results from two different methods of cluster analysis are shown for each fragment: ML (PhyML) trees in a., c., and e., and
Bayesian MCMC based consensus trees in b., d., and f.. Terminal nodes represent sequences sampled from P1 (blue circles) or P2 (red circles), as
well as reference sequences. Env sequences for P1 and P2 were sampled by SGA and represent gap-stripped alignments 1305 nucleotides in
length. Gag and pol fragments were sampled by bacterial cloning. The full tree images can be viewed in Additional Figures 1 and 2. All scale
bars show 0.05, equivalent to 5% divergence. ML bootstrap values or Bayesian MCMC based posterior probabilities for the clustering of P1 and
P2 are given as percentages next to the common ancestor node.

Between-host phylogenetic analysis supports the clinical
history of a single donor

By both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
MCMC based analyses, sequences from P1 and P2 were
highly related and clustered to the exclusion of all other
sequences, consistent with a common donor (Figure 2,
Additional Files 1 and 2). We demonstrated the statistical support for the robustness of the cluster by both
methods (Figure 2 - ML bootstrap values for three
genes were: env 100%, gag 99.9% and pol 99.3%, and
Bayesian MCMC based posterior probabilities were:
100% for env, gag and pol). We could not use phylogenetic inference to exclude the possibility that one participant infected the other, since such techniques cannot
prove the direction of transmission in a forensic sense

[39]. For example, we could not exclude the possibility
that two strains were transmitted to one participant
and that an initially infectious strain was out-competed
to extinction prior to day 63. However, results from
other studies suggested this was unlikely [5,6,13,40,41].
Therefore, phylogenetic analyses were consistent with
the clinical history that a single, third party contemporaneously transmitted the divergent strains that
infected P1 and P2.
Significant between-host divergence observed in
transmitted HIV-1 env and pol genes

We measured the inter-host distance for stem branches,
which are the internal branches separating the withinpatient sequences. For the gag gene fragment, which we

English et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:54
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/54

expected to be the most conserved fragment, the interhost distance was 0.54% by ML analysis (Figure 2c). The
inter-host distance for the env fragment, which we
expected to be the least conserved of the three, was
3.81%(Figure 2a). For the pol fragment, the inter-host
distance was 1.93% (Figure 2e). The inter-host distance
for env contrasts with the smaller mean distance within
each participant. For env, the mean within-patient distance was 0.54% by ML analysis in both participants
across the gap-stripped 1305 nucleotide alignment, consistent with the history of recent infection (Figure 2a).
In addition, sequence analysis of day 235 plasma also
failed to detect env or pol sequences from P1 in P2 and
vice versa (data not shown). Therefore, despite sharing
highly similar gag genes, consistent with the clinical history of a common origin, P1 and P2 appeared to be
infected with remarkably different env variants and, to a
lesser extent, pol variants.
Current implementations of ML and Bayesian tree
analysis do not model gaps or non-aligned regions informatively [42]. As phylogenetic analysis of the env region
meant removing gaps and non-aligned portions, we
compared full-fragment, non-stripped env sequences
from P1 and P2 with the baseline consensus sequence
for P1 in a Highlighter plot (Figure 3). There was
sequence homogeneity within both P1 and P2, compatible with a single strain initiating a recent infection for
each. However, there were multiple sites of variation
when P1 was compared with P2. Secondly, we quantified
the percentage phylogenetic signal-to-noise (STN)[43] in
env. We compared our full env fragment with gaps to
the same fragment with 5% gap-stripping. The percentage STN between P1 and P2 was 70.7% to 24.3% in the
unstripped env fragment and 62.0% to 30.7% for the
stripped env. Nevertheless, the percentage STN in the
stripped alignment between hosts was greater than in
previous studies of multiple-variant transmissions in this
genomic region [6,12]. Our analyses indicated that there
was a small loss of between-host phylogenetic signal in
env by stripping gaps or poorly aligned regions. However, stripped env fragment alignments contained a
higher percentage STN than either the shorter gag alignment (49.4% to 50.5%) or shorter pol alignment (4.2% to
35.5%). The gag and pol fragment alignments did not
require stripping. Noise ≥ 30% was consistent with a
phylogenetic cluster [44,45], but we needed to quantify
between-host evolution prior to transmission by another
method.
Env divergence quantified by estimating the tMRCA

To quantify pre-transmission evolution, we estimated
the time since divergence of the two env variants infecting P1 and P2 by calibrating the sequence evolution rate
for the env C2V5 region of gp120 against another

dataset and by measuring the degree of within-host
diversification since transmission [3,15]. Using Bayesian
MCMC based inference, we estimated the inter-host distance as the time to the most recent common ancestor
(tMRCA) which was 2.82 years (95% confidence interval:
1.28 to 4.54 years) of viral evolution (Figure 4). We
repeated this analysis with different priors (Additional
File 3). All of these results were consistent, and the
common ancestor of the HIV-1 env genes infecting P1
and P2 was estimated to have existed at least 1.14 years
prior to transmission, either in a chronically infected
donor or in a recent previous host. These estimates
were again consistent with the clinical history of a single, third party having infected both P1 and P2, and that
highly divergent sequences could be transmitted by a
single donor within a very short period of time.
Potential antigenic variation in the gp120 proteins

not answer whether each patient received divergent variants at random or whether there was selection at

transmission. Transmission of divergent env gp120 variants could be due to hard selection for differences in
antigenicity in each recipient. Hard selection involves
selective mortality of variants [46]. In rhesus macaques,
SIV envelope proteins appear be under hard selection at
transmission due to neutralizing antibodies [47].
Attempts have been made to infer the antigenicity of
HIV-1 envelope proteins to neutralizing antibodies from
the number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites
(PNLGSs) in gp120 [22,48]. Therefore, we hypothesized
that differences in the number of PNLGSs in gp120
would indicate potential between-host differences in
viral antigenicity.
We compared PNLGSs within inferred amino acid
sequences for gp120 from P1 and P2 using N-Glycosite
(Figure 5). P1 had a mean of 24 PNLGSs (range 23 to
25). P2 had a mean of 29 PNLGSs (range 28 to 29).
Firstly, we looked for positions where P1 and P2 were
identical. P1 and P2 shared PNLGSs in 100% of
sequences at 17 positions. To demonstrate that this
degree of identity was consistent with a phylogenetic
cluster, we compared these sequences with 242 unrelated sequences. We studied 87 full-length, inferred
amino acid sequences for gp120 sampled from other
SPARTAC participants at trial baseline by population
sequencing, as well a 155 subtype B sequences from the
LANL database sampled during acute infection. The
combined SPARTAC/LANL reference sequences had

100% PNLGS predictions at only one site, located in C1.
Greater than 90% of the reference sequences had a
PNLGSs at only seven positions. We concluded that the
degree of similarity between P1 and P2 was consistent
with a phylogenetic cluster due to transmission from a
single donor.
We then looked at the positions that were not 100%
identical, to see if there was any evidence of potential
hard selection in each recipient during transmission. In
particular, we focussed on the V1V4 region that is
implicated in susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies.
Previous studies of this region have suggested that fewer
PNLGSs in this region increases the susceptibility of
highly related strains to neutralizing antibody
[22,24,25,49]. We found a higher mean number of
PNLGSs across V1V4 in P2 (24 sites, range 23-25) than
P1 (19 sites, range 18-20; p < 0.0001, unpaired T-test).
These data indicated that there could be a difference in
susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies between these
two strains, consistent with a non-random model of
transmission.
No autologous or cross-neutralization observed despite
potential antigenic variation

We hypothesized that differences at PNLGSs might
equate to differences in neutralization that would
explain the transmission of divergent env variants
[22,24,25,49]. Therefore, we investigated whether the
viral isolates from P1 and P2 had different neutralization
profiles. Viruses pseudotyped with full-length day 63 env
sequences from P1 and P2 were tested against

English et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:54
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/54

autologous or heterologous serum from each participant
sampled at day 186 post-exposure. However, the env
pseudotypes for both P1 and P2 were only poorly neutralized or cross-neutralized (half maximal inhibitory
concentration, IC50, of serum ≤ 1:20, Additional File 4).
Therefore, it seemed unlikely that a humoral response
was responsible for the detection of different env variants in P1 and P2, consistent with transmission being a
random process.
However, envelope proteins are not only potentially
under immune selection at transmission but also
might be selected for an increased ability to enter
cells. We used the data from our neutralization assay
to estimate the infectivity of the env pseudotyped
viruses in vitro. Pseudoviruses derived from P1
sequences were approximately 2.5 times (P < 0.05)
more infectious in vitro than pseudoviruses from P2,
after normalization to reverse transcriptase levels
(Additional File 5). We noted between-host diversity
in C2C4, including differences in glycosylation. C2C4
encodes discontinuous regions involved in CD4 and
co-receptor binding [50-52]. Inferred gp120 protein
sequences were analysed with several algorithms that
were evaluated by Low and colleagues [53], to detect
differences in predicted co-receptor usage and minimize the possibility of missing CXCR4/CCR5 dual-use
variants. However, these algorithms predicted that all
sampled viruses from P1 and P2 would use CCR5.
Our experiment was not specifically set up to test
infectivity so all these results must be interpreted with
caution. In addition, potential differences in infectivity
do not explain why both viruses were able to cause
productive infection in different individuals. Therefore,
we found no evidence to reject a random model of
transmission.
HLA Class 1 restricted responses and potential selection
pressure around transmission

We also investigated HIV-1 specific cellular immune
responses, to exclude another potential source of hard
selection in each participant that might influence our
results. Clinical progression and viral load have been
associated with host HLA Class I type in chronic infection [54-56]. HLA Class I restricts the ability of host
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to recognize and
destroy infected cells. Furthermore, sequencing studies
have detected evidence consistent with escape from
CTL responses within weeks of HIV-1 infection [57].
The role that CTLs play in preventing established viral
infection in humans remains unclear. However, vaccination of rhesus macaques to produce detectable CTL
responses is associated with partial protection from
infection [58], and HIV-1 specific CTL responses have
been detected in persons who remain PCR/ELISA

Page 7 of 14

negative despite high-risk exposure [59-61]. Therefore,
we hypothesized that CTL responses during and after
transmission were a potential source of hard selection in
P1 and P2.
Firstly, we compared the Class I HLA type of P1 and
P2 with the clinical data to see if there was evidence of
selection. P1 possessed HLA-A*0201, A*2402, HLAB*1402, B*3543, Cw*0102, Cw*0802; P2 possessed HLAA*0101, A*2901, B*0801, B*5001, Cw*0602, Cw*0701.
Neither participant possessed HLA types that are
strongly associated with protection from progression in
chronic infection [62,63]. However, P2, who progressed
quickest, possessed the HLA-A*0101 B*0801 haplotype
that is associated with more rapid progression [64].
Therefore, we hypothesize that host factors contribute
to the different clinical outcome in these participants
and that the viruses had been under different selection
pressures since transmission.
Detectable CTL responses do not explain between-host
divergence in env

We investigated whether different CTL responses could
have influenced detection of divergent variants in our
study. Phylogenetic analysis assumes neutral evolution
rather than natural selection [44]. Therefore, we compared viral sequence data and g-interferon ELISpot data
from each participant to see if cytotoxic T lymphocyte
responses since transmission may have accounted for
observed between-host divergence in env [65,66].
Sequence data were available for the two env gp120
optimal peptides against which P2 had a significant
response: TVYYGVPVWK (HXB2 gp160 30-46) and
SFEPIPIHY (HXB2 gp160 202-221). The inferred amino
acid sequences for P1 were identical to the wild-type
peptides at these epitopes: TVYYGVPVWR and
SFEPIPIHY. P2 was also infected with wild-type
TVYYGVPVWR, as well as both wild-type and mutant
SFEPIPIHK sequences. Therefore, between-host genetic
differences in env could not be attributed to detectable,
env-directed CTL responses, and our data were still
consistent with transmission of env variants being a random process.

Conclusions
We have quantified for the first time significant,
between-host genetic divergence in HIV-1 variants that
are likely to have been transmitted by a single donor to
two recipients on the same night. Furthermore, these
data indicate that currently it is not possible to predict
which of the many HIV-1 variants circulating at the
time of transmission will successfully seed a new infection. If transmission is a random process, then this
represents a major hurdle that any HIV-1 vaccine design
will need to overcome.

Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)

Participant HLA type was determined to the oligo-allelic
level using Dynal RELITM Reverse Sequence-Specific Oligonucleotide kits for the HLA-A, -B and -C loci (Dynal
Biotech). To obtain four-digit typing, Dynal Biotech
Sequence-Specific priming kits were used, in conjunction
with the Sequence-Specific Oligonucleotide type.

For env, viral RNA was reverse transcribed using the
SuperScript III Kit (Invitrogen, UK) to produce cDNA.
15 μl of viral RNA was added to 1.5 μl dH2O, 1.5 μl primer OFM19 [6] (concentration 20 μM) and 1.5 μl
dNTPs (concentration 10 mM). The mix was heated to
65°C for 5 min followed by 4°C for 1 mins to anneal the
primers to the RNA. The reverse transcription (RT)
reaction mix (5xBuffer: 6 μl, DTT: 1.5 μl; RNaseOUT
1.5 μl; SuperScript III 1.5 μl) was then added to make a
final volume of 29 μl. The reaction mix was heated to
50°C for 60 min, followed by 55°C for 60 min and finally
75°C for 10 minutes. For gag and pol, viral RNA was
reverse transcribed using the Reverse-iT 1 st Strand
Synthesis Kit (Abgene, UK). 18 μl of viral RNA was
added to 1.5 μl primer (random decamers and oligodT
supplied with the kit, concentration 20 μM). The mix
was heated to 75°C for 5 min followed by 4°C for 2 min
to anneal the primers to the RNA. The RT reaction mix
(5×Buffer: 6 μl; dNTPs: 3 μl concentration 10 mM;
RTase Blend 1.5 μl) was then added to make a final
volume of 30 μl. The reaction mixture was heated to 42°
C for 60 min followed by 75°C for 10 min. The HIV gag
and pol genes were amplified by separate PCR reactions
as described in detail elsewhere [67]. The HIV env genes
were amplified by PCR using a protocol for single genome amplification as described in detail elsewhere [5,6].

Separation of PBMCs and plasma

Single genome amplification

360 participants, 151 of whom were from the UK or Ireland, were recruited to the Short Pulse AntiRetroviral
Therapy at HIV seroConversion (SPARTAC) trial
(ISRCTN number 76742797; EudraCT number 2004000446-20). Two male individuals from the UK cohort,
P1 and P2, were identified on clinical history as having
epidemiologically-linked infections: they were partners
and had shared a sexual encounter with a single, third
male on the same night. P1 and P2 were enrolled in the
trial on the same day and followed up at the Jefferiss
Trust Clinic, St. Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London,
UK. They were both randomized to receive no therapy.
Ethics Statement

This study has been approved by the Multicentre
Research Ethics Committee (MREC). All participants
provided written informed consent before participating
in this study.
HLA typing

Peripheral blood mononucleocyte (PBMC) and plasma
samples were separated from fresh EDTA blood by
Ficoll/Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. For
PBMC collection, blood was diluted with R10 solution:
RPMI 1640 (Sigma UK) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS;
Sigma, UK), 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin mix
and 2 μM L-glutamine. The mixture was then layered
over Lymphoprep separation medium (Gibco, UK). Samples were centrifuged at 100 × g at room temperature.
The resultant layer of PBMC was removed and washed.
1 ml aliquots containing 5 × 10 6 cells were stored in
cryotubes in liquid nitrogen at -180±C. For plasma collection, blood samples were prepared as above with dilution with R10, and the resulting plasma was collected in
1 ml aliquots and stored at -80±C.
Viral RNA extraction

1 ml aliquots of frozen plasma were used for each
extraction. The plasma was centrifuged at 1600 × g and
4±C for 1 hour to pellet the virus. Excess plasma was
removed and the pellet was resuspended in 140 μl of
remaining plasma. RNA was then extracted with the
QIAamp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen, UK) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Single genome amplification (SGA) of env was carried as
described elsewhere [5,6]. A 30% cut-off for positive
wells was used [5,6,36].
Bacterial cloning

Bacterial cloning was carried out for gag and pol using
the TOPO TA “One Shot” Cloning Kit for Sequencing
(Invitrogen, UK). Purified PCR products were ligated
into the pCR4-TOPO vector. Escherichia coli were
mixed on ice with the ligation mix and then transfected
by heat shock at 42°C for 30 s. Cells were immediately
removed to ice and then added to SOC medium (Invitrogen, UK) and placed on a shaking incubator at 37°C
and < 1 × g for 1 hour. Cells were then spread on plates
of 1× lysogeny broth (LB) agar (Sigma, UK) containing
0.1 μ g/ml ampicillin (Sigma, UK) and incubated overnight at 37°C. Negative controls were included. Colonies
were then selected and added to individual wells containing 2× LB medium (Sigma, UK) with 0.05 μ g/ml
kanamycin (Sigma, UK). The wells were incubated on a
shaking incubator overnight at 37°C and < 1 × g. Bacteria were lysed and minipreps of clonal plasmid DNA
(pDNA) were prepared using the Montage Miniprep96
Kit (Millipore, US).

Sequencing

Sequencing of population PCR, SGA and bacterial cloning DNA products was performed using BigDye technology in a 96-well plate. For population PCR and SGA
products, 3 μl DNA was added to a mix containing 0.8
μl BigDye Terminator (Applied Biosystems, UK), 1.5 μl
5× sequencing buffer (Applied Biosystems, UK), 2 μl of
primer (3.3 μM) and 2.7 μl dH2O. For bacteria-cloned
pDNA, 4 μl of miniprep was added to a mix containing
1 μl BigDye Terminator, 1.5 μl 5× sequencing buffer, 1
μl of primer (3.3 μM) and 3.5 μl dH2O. The following
cycling conditions were used: 96°C for 30 s, then 30
cycles of 96°C for 30 s, 50°C for 15 s and 60°C for 4
min. DNA for sequencing was precipitated on ice with 2
μl 3M sodium acetate, 10 μl dH2O, 50 μl ice-cold 100%
ethanol for 5 min at -20°C, centrifuged at 600 × g for 80
min at 4°C, washed twice with ice-cold 70% ethanol and
run on an ABI 3700 sequencer.
Sequence alignment

All sequences were manually edited using Sequencher
v4.8 (Gene Codes Corporation, US) and manually
aligned using Se-Al v2.0a11 [68,69]. For env alignment,
sequences were first aligned with MUSCLE v3.7 [70] followed by manual alignment. Sequences containing stop
codons or frameshifts were deleted prior to subsequent
analysis. Where appropriate, reference sequences were
obtained from the Los Alamos National Laboratory
(LANL) HIV sequence database [71]. For env, which
contains many gaps and poorly aligned regions, gap
stripping was undertaken first with GapStreeze set to
5% [72]. In GapStreeze, the user sets a gap tolerance
between 0% and 100%. A value of 5% will cause all columns in the alignment to be deleted if more than 5% of
sequences contain a gap at that position. Sequences
were manually edited in Se-Al v2.0a11 before and after
gap-stripping.
Between-host phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences sampled from
P1 and P2 was carried out by several methods across
the env, gag and pol gene-fragments. Prior to gap-stripping with GapStreeze, a likelihood mapping [45] analysis
was run to ensure phylogenetic signal within env was
significant. Likelihood mapping was implemented in
Tree-Puzzle v5.3.rc7 [73] and the env fragment was
screened from the beginning of the coding start region
to the end of gp120 (HXB2 nucleotide position 6225 to
7757). Additionally, full nucleotide sequences for the
fragments from all three genes were visually screened in
Highlighter [74], and the inferred protein sequence were
screened visually using Jalview v2.6 [75,76]. Phylogenetic
trees were initially constructed using the maximum likelihood (ML) method with PhyML v3.0 software [77],

Page 9 of 14

and visualized in FigTree v1.3.1 [78]. We chose the substitution model that gave the highest likelihood with
PAUP*v4.0 [79]: the generalized time reversible (GTR)
model incorporating estimates of the proportion of
invariant sites (I), and the shape parameter of a gamma
distribution [80]. ML branch support values were
obtained by non-parametric bootstrapping using PhyML
v3.0 (1000 replicates). Finally, phylogenetic analysis
using a Bayesian MCMC based method was implemented in Mr Bayes v3.1.2 [81,82]. An unconstrained branch
length (exponential) prior was used to avoid enforcing a
molecular clock [44]. MrBayes v3.1.2 was run in duplicate for at least 50,000,000 steps for env and pol, sampling trees every 1,000 steps. MrBayes v3.1.2 was run in
duplicate for at least 100,000,000 steps for gag, sampling
every 10,000 steps. Convergence was assessed with Tracer v1.5 [83] with all parameter estimates having effective sample sizes (ESSs) of > 300, because a high ESS
reflects a low degree of correlation among samples [44].
The consensus tree for each gene, with posterior probabilities for branch support, was generated and visualized in FigTree v1.3.1.
Inferring the tMRCA using a relaxed molecular clock

To determine the time to the most recent common
ancestor (tMRCA) of the sequences isolated from the
two participants, we used a Bayesian MCMC based
approach. We tested our assumption that all of the
observed evolution in env within the viral sequence sets
from each participant had occurred within each host by
demonstrating a star-like intra-host phylogeny, and confirming that intra-host divergence by ML was consistent
with that predicted for early, monophyletic infection
against other datasets [3,5,6,12,15]. We used a normal
tMRCA prior for the sequences within each participant,
calibrated to a mean of 63 days since exposure (standard
deviation 1 day). We ran BEAST v1.5.4 [84] for at least
100,000,000 steps, sampling every 10,000 steps, and
employing an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock to
allow for rate variation among branches [15,44,85-87].
Rate variation may occur if the two variants evolved at
different rates, before or after transmission [15,44]. The
substitution model was the GTR model. The underlying
demographic model was the Bayesian skyline plot with
10 steps, and was used as a flexible prior on the distribution of the inter-node intervals on the sampled phylogenetic topologies [15,44,85-87]. Convergence was
assessed with Tracer v1.5, and all parameter estimates
had ESSs of > 300 [15,44,85-87]. Convergence was not
achieved when using estimated transmission time as the
only prior; the ESSs for the prior and posterior probabilities remained < 100 after 300,000,000 steps
[15,44,85-87]. To deal with this issue, a posterior mean
rate of substitution prior was estimated from the

English et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:54
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/54

posterior mean rate of another dataset, for a fragment of
the env C2V5 region [15]. This mean rate prior was normally distributed, with a mean of 8.18 × 10-3 substitutions per site per year (standard deviation of 1.15×10-3
substitutions per site per year) [15]. The hypervariable
regions were cut to be consistent with the original dataset after consultation with the authors [88]. To achieve
convergence, our relaxed-clock analysis also required
the full-length C2V5 fragment, rather than the part-fragment used in the reference dataset that was missing the
5’ end of the C2 region [15].
To determine the sensitivity of our results to the
choice of prior, we also analysed the data under a strict
molecular clock, calibrating the time of transmission to
the same prior as under the relaxed molecular clock,
but not enforcing a strong prior on the rate [15,44]. We
performed this analysis for C2V5 and our entire 1305
stripped env fragment. The mean rate prior from the
reference dataset was necessary for the, relaxed clock
analysis to converge, but our tMRCA estimate was
robust to this choice of prior, as the most important
prior for the tMRCA estimate was the time of transmission. Although calibration to the time since transmission
may lead to an overestimate of the posterior substitution
rate estimate [15], other studies have found that this
effect is small for monophyletic infections [6,12]. Both
strict-clock and relaxed-clock analyses using the gag and
pol fragments failed to achieve convergence after
300,000,000 steps, and no reference datasets were available for calibration of evolution in these fragments.
Potential N-linked glycosylation site analysis

We compared potential N-linked glycosylation sites
(PNLGSs) between inferred amino acid sequences for
the SGA samples env in from P1 and P2, using N-Glycosite [89].
Neutralization and infectivity assays

HIV env genes were amplified from reverse transcribed
viral RNA, restriction-cloned in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen,
UK) and co-transfected into 293T cells with an env deficient backbone, nl4.3Δenv (Dr M. Pizzato, University of
Geneva). Virus-containing supernatants were harvested,
assayed for reverse transcriptase activity [90], and
titrated onto the HIV permissible cell-line, TZM-BL
(also known as JC53-BL) using previously described
techniques [91] with the following modifications: cell
monolayers were fixed with 0.2% gluteraldehyde, stained
with an X-gal substrate and air dried. Infected cells were
counted with an AID v2.9 EliSpot plate-counter (AID
GmbH, Germany). To test serum-mediated neutralizing
responses, 400 focus forming units (FFUs) of titratedpseudovirus were incubated with serial dilutions of heat
inactivated autologous sera from participants.

Page 10 of 14

Neutralization was calculated as the percentage-reduction of FFUs compared to virus-only controls.
IFN-g ELISpot assay

100 μl of 0.5 μ g/ml mouse anti-human IFN-g monoclonal antibody solution (Mabtech, Sweden) was added to
each well on an ELISpot plate (Millipore, US). Frozen
PBMCs were rapidly defrosted and then pipetted into 10
ml of a solution containing RPMI 1640 and pig skin
gelatine (PSG) with added DNAse (Sigma, UK). The
solution was centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min. The
PBMCs were resuspended in 20 ml of R10 solution and
incubated overnight at 37±C. Cells were then counted
and resuspended in a volume of R10 solution to give a
final concentration of 5 × 105 cells per 100 μl. The ELISpot plate was washed three times with 200 μl per well
of phosphate buffered solution (PBS; Gibco, US) containing 1% FCS. Peptides were added to the appropriated wells, with a final concentration of each peptide
being 10 μM. We used overlapping 15 mer peptides
covering HIV-1 proteins gag p17 and gag p24 as well as
optimal epitopes covering gag, pol, nef and env proteins.
100 μl of PBMC suspension was then added to each
well. Duplicate negative controls were prepared, containing R10. Duplicate positive controls were prepared,
containing 5 μ g/ml PHA-P (Sigma, UK). The plate was
incubated for 16 hours at 37±C. The PBMCs were then
discarded and the plate was then washed seven times
with PBS. 100 μl of 0.5 μ g/ml biotinylated anti-human
IFN-g monoclonal antibody (Mabtech, Sweden) was
added to each well. The plate was incubated for 90 min
at room temperature. The antibody was then discarded
and the plate washed seven times with PBS. 100 μl of
0.5 μ g/ml streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase
(ALP; Mabtech, Sweden) was added. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 40 min. The streptavidinALP was then discarded and the plate washed seven
times with PBS. 100 μl of substrate solution from the
ALP conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad, US) was added to
each well. The plate was incubated at room temperature
for 10 min, or until a colour change was noted in the
positive control well. The plate was then washed with
ordinary tap water and dried. Spots were counted on
the AID version 2.9 EliSpot plate-reader. The normalized magnitude of the response (NMOR) was calculated
as follows [92]:
NMOR = Mexp − (¯ neg + 3 × SDneg ) − 50
x

Where Mexp is the number of spots in the experimen¯
tal well, xneg is the mean number of spots in the negative control wells, and SDneg is the standard deviation of
the negative control wells. NMOR is always a positive
integer and all negative values are set to 0.
