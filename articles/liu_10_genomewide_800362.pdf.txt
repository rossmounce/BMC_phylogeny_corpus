the phospholipase D gene family in Poplar and
Grape

Abstract
Background: The Phospholipase D (PLD) family plays an important role in the regulation of cellular processes in plants,
including abscisic acid signaling, programmed cell death, root hair patterning, root growth, freezing tolerance and
other stress responses. PLD genes constitute an important gene family in higher plants. However, until now our
knowledge concerning the PLD gene family members and their evolutionary relationship in woody plants such as
Poplar and Grape has been limited.
Results: In this study, we have provided a genome-wide analysis of the PLD gene family in Poplar and Grape. Eighteen
and eleven members of the PLD gene family were identified in Poplar and Grape respectively. Phylogenetic and gene
structure analyses showed that the PLD gene family can be divided into 6 subgroups: α, β/γ, δ, ε, ζ, and φ, and that the
6 PLD subgroups originated from 4 original ancestors through a series of gene duplications. Interestingly, the majority
of the PLD genes from both Poplar (76.5%, 13/17) and Grape (90.9%, 10/11) clustered closely together in the
phylogenetic tree to the extent that their evolutionary relationship appears more tightly linked to each other, at least in
terms of the PLD gene family, than it does to either Arabidopsis or rice. Five pairs of duplicated PLD genes were
identified in Poplar, more than those in Grape, suggesting that frequent gene duplications occurred after these species
diverged, resulting in a rapid expansion of the PLD gene family in Poplar. The majority of the gene duplications in
Poplar were caused by segmental duplication and were distinct from those in Arabidopsis, rice and Grape. Additionally,
the gene duplications in Poplar were estimated to have occurred from 11.31 to 13.76 million years ago, which are later
than those that occurred in the other three plant species. Adaptive evolution analysis showed that positive selection
contributed to the evolution of the PXPH- and SP-PLDs, whereas purifying selection has driven the evolution of C2PLDs that contain a C2 domain in their N-terminal. Analyses have shown that the C2-PLDs generally contain 23 motifs,
more than 17 motifs in PXPH-PLDs that contain PX and PH domains in N-terminal. Among these identified motifs,
eight, (6, 8, 5, 4, 3, 14, 1 and 19) were shared by both the C2- and PXPH-PLD subfamilies, implying that they may be
necessary for PLD function. Five of these shared motifs are located in the central region of the proteins, thus strongly
suggesting that this region containing a HKD domain (named after three conserved H, K and D residues) plays a key
role in the lipase activity of the PLDs.
Conclusion: As a first step towards genome wide analyses of the PLD genes in woody plants, our results provide
valuable information for increasing our understanding of the function and evolution of the PLD gene family in higher
plants.

periods of stress by employing specific responses underpinned by defined modifications of their cellular processes. Phospholipase D (PLD) plays an important role in

root hair patterning, root growth, freezing tolerance and
other stress responses [1]. PLD hydrolyzes phospholipids
into a head group alcohol and phosphatidic acid (PA),
which is an important intracellular messenger in plants,
microorganisms and mammals [2].
The gene encoding PLD was first identified in plants
more than 50 years ago [3], but did not receive detailed
attention until the 1980s [4,5]. Multiple PLD genes
encoding isoforms that could be classified into different
subgroups with distinct biochemical, regulatory and catalytic properties have now been identified. Six Arabidopsis
PLDs (α, β, γ, δ, ε and ζ) have been characterized molecularly and biochemically and can be differentiated depending on their requirements and/or affinities for Ca2+,
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and free
fatty acids [6,7]. The predominant isoenzyme is the αtype PLD, which can be detected in both the leaves and
seeds of plants and is responsible for the majority of the
baseline PLD activity found therein. PLDα does not
require phosphoinositides for its activity when assayed in
the presence of mM levels of Ca2+ ions. It exhibits optimum activity at pH values between 5 and 6 and at high,
non-physiological Ca2+ concentrations between 30 and
100 mM [8,9]. In contrast, the β, γ, δ and ε PLD isoenzymes from Arabidopsis show their highest activity at μM
Ca2+ concentrations and require the presence of PIP2 to
be fully active [10]. The activity of plant PLDζ appears to
occur independently of Ca2+ ions, but requires PIP2 to
selectively hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine. In rice, an
additional isoenzyme, PLDφ, has been identified but
poorly characterized as of yet [11]. The PLD gene family
encodes proteins with a number of cellular functions. For
example, it has been suggested that PLDβ is involved in
the regulation of seed germination and may act as a negative regulator of defence responses and disease resistance
in rice [11,12], whereas PLDδ has been shown to play an
important role in drought-induced hydrogen peroxide
synthesis, responses to freezing and UV irradiation, and
in the reorganization of microtubules at plasma membrane [1,13].
Despite these apparent differences in their biochemical
functions, all the eukaryotic PLDs share the presence of
an N-terminal phospholipid-binding region and two
highly conserved C-terminal domains where two catalytic HxKxxxxD (HKD) motifs interact to promote the
lipase activity [14,15]. The plant PLD family can also be
divided into two further subfamilies (C2 and PXPH)
based on the composition of their N-terminal phospholipid-binding domains. The C2-PLD subfamily comprises
PLDs containing a C2 domain in their N-termini, while
the N-termini of those of the PXPH-PLD subfamily contain both a phox homology (PX) domain and a pleckstrin
homology (PH) domain. The C2, PX and PH domains

Page 2 of 15

have been implicated in protein-protein interactions, but
perhaps their best described function involves their ability to modulate membrane targeting of proteins. The C2
domain of the C2-PLDs mediates the localization of soluble proteins to membranes by binding phospholipids in a
Ca2+ dependent manner [16], while the PX and PH
domains of the PXPH-PLDs have been shown to mediate
membrane targeting and are closely linked to polyphosphoinositide signalling [17]. The C2-PLDs only exist in
plants, whereas the PXPH-PLDs exist both in plants and
other organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans and
Homo sapiens. Presumably, the genes encoding the C2PLDs and their progenitors have been lost from the evolutionary lineages leading to animals and fungi [18]. Furthermore, one additional small PLD subfamily (SP-PLDs)
exists in which members comprise PLDs possessing an
N-terminal signal peptide in place of the usual C2 or
PXPH domains and the resulting specific cellular localizations may relate to their particular physiological functions in modulating plant growth, development and
defence [11]. The isoforms α, β, γ, δ, and ε are C2-PLDs,
the ζ isoform is a PXPH-PLDs and the φ isoform is a SPPLDs.
The PLD gene family had been well studied in Arabidopsis and rice. However, there is far less information
about this family for woody plant species such as Poplar
and Grape. The recent provision of draft genome
sequences for Poplar and Grape offered the opportunity
to investigate the PLD gene family in these species. In this
study, we first identified the PLD gene family members in
Poplar and Grape and then performed detailed evolutionary analyses of these identified genes in comparison with
those existing in Arabidopsis and rice.

Results and Discussion
PLD gene family in Poplar and Grape

In order to identify members of the PLD gene family in
Poplar and Grape, the corresponding sequence information from Arabidopsis was used to perform multiple
searches of the relevant DNA databases using the blast
and tblastn algorithms, keyword searches and protein
domain searches. The Poplar and Grape sequences
returned by such searches were confirmed as encoding
PLDs by using the programs PFAM and SMART. Following this strategy, we identified 18 genes encoding PLDs in
Poplar (including a pseudogene) (Table 1) and 11 PLD
genes in Grape (Table 2). These numbers where similar to
the number of PLD genes present in the rice (17 PLD
genes) and Arabidopsis (12 PLD genes) genomes. Since
there was no standard annotation assigned to these newly
identified genes, we assigned each of them an identity
based on the order of their location on each of either the
Poplar or Grape chromosomes.

Based on the presence of C2, PX and PH motifs within
their N-terminal domains, all the PLD family members in
Poplar and Grape were assigned to two main subgroups,
C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs. Additionally, one gene encoding an SP-PLD with an N-terminal signal peptide replacing the C2, PX and PH domains was identified for each of

these species. Corresponding SP-PLD genes were also
found in other species, including Caenorhabditis elegans
(CAE72017, NP_504824), Dictyostelium discoideum
(XP_637114), Homo sapiens (AAH00553, AAH15003)
and rice (Os06g44060).

Chromosomal location of PLD genes on Poplar and Grape
genomes

17 from Poplar (excluding the pseudogene PtPLD18), 11
from Grape, 12 from Arabidopsis and 16 from rice [6,11]
(Figure 3). A phylogenetic tree based on protein
sequences was constructed using the neighbor-joining
(NJ) method with p-distance and complete deletion
option. For statistical reliability, we conducted bootstrap
analysis with 1000 replicates. The NJ phylogenetic tree
showed that all the PLD genes from the four higher plants
divided into 6 well-supported clades (bootstrap values
from 64% to 100%). Among these, the previously classified β and γ isoforms clustered closely together and were
not explicitly separated from each other. Accordingly, the
tree clades were classified into six subgroups, α, β/γ, δ, ε,
ζ and φ (Figure 3). Among these, the α subgroup constituted the largest clade containing 19 members, and the β/
γ subgroup formed the second largest clade containing 12
members (bootstrap value, 100%). Additionally, the β/γ
and δ subgroups further clustered forming a larger clade
and implying that they originated from a common ancestor by frequent gene duplication. Among these subgroups, the α, β/γ, δ, ε comprised C2-PLDs while the ζ
and φ subgroups comprised PXPH-PLDs and SP-PLDs.
Interestingly, although phylogenetically members of the ε
subgroup comprised C2-PLDs, they appeared somewhat
divergent from this class of PLDs and were indeed intermediary between the C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs. Distinct
from the other C2-PLDs, PLDε appeared to possess the
C2 structural fold, but this contained none of the acidic
amino acid residues thought to be involved in Ca2+ bind-

Chromosomal location analyses showed that PLD genes
of Poplar and Grape were dispersed throughout the
respective genomes. Five Poplar PLD genes were localized to unassembled genomic sequence scaffolds and
thus were not mapped to any particular chromosome. In
Poplar, chromosomes I, II, VI and XVIII were found to
possess two PLD genes each, and each of chromosomes
III, V, X, XIII and XIV to possess a single PLD gene (Figure 1). For Grape, 11 PLD genes were found to be present
on 8 of the 19 chromosomes; chromosomes II, V, XII, XV
and XVIII were all found to possess one PLD gene each,
whereas chromosome IV, IX and XI possessed two PLD
genes each (Figure 2).
Phylogenetic relationships of PLD gene family in Poplar
and Grape

In order to classify the PLD genes identified for Poplar
and Grape and investigate their evolutionary relationships, their derived protein sequences and those of Arabidopsis and rice [6,11] were subjected to phylogenetic
analyses. One rice PLD gene, OsPLDκ (Os02g02790), was
excluded from the analysis since it appeared to encode a
protein missing one HKD domain at its C-terminus, indicating that this gene may be a pseudogene or constitute
either a sequencing or assembly error. After excluding
other cases of such pseudogenes or incorrectly assembled
genes, a total of 56 PLD genes were used in the analyses,

ing, suggesting that the phospholipid binding of PLDε is
less Ca2+-dependent than the other C2-PLDs [19]. This
feature of the PLDε C2 domain appeared to be conserved
between Poplar, Grape and Arabidopsis. Surprisingly,
PLDε does not appear to exist in rice.
Structural analyses can provide valuable information
concerning duplication events when interpreting phylogenetic relationships within gene families. Thus, the
exon/intron structure of each member of the PLD family
was analyzed (right panel in Figure 3). The number of
exons determined for members of the PLD gene family
ranged from 2 in OsPLDα6 to 22 in PtPLD16. Most members within the individual subgroups shared similar
intron/exon numbers and predicted coding sequence
(CDS) lengths, consistent with the phylogenetic classification of the PLDs into the subgroups depicted in the left
panel of Figure 3. For example, both β/γ and δ subgroups
included members with 9-12 exons with CDS lengths of
between 792 to 1296 codons, consistent with the observation that they originated by continuous gene duplication.
Interestingly, the genes VvPLD9 and VvPLD10 appeared
longer than the other members of the β/γ and δ subgroups because of the presence of a single long intron
that contained repeated retrotransposon elements [20].
Similarly, members of the α and ε subgroups possessed 34 exons, with some introns extended by retrotransposon
elements, suggesting that they also had a common ancestor. Members of the ζ subgroup which comprised PXPHPLDs, were distinct from the C2-PLDs clade in that they
possessed between 19 to 21 exons (except AtPLDζ2 that
had 16 exons), suggesting an independent evolutionary
lineage. Similarly, all members of the PXPH-PLD φ subgroup had 7 exons, also implying they originated via an
evolutionary path separate to that of the C2-PLDs. Thus,
the phylogenetic and gene structure analysis suggested
that the 6 PLD subgroups originated from 4 ancestors via
a series of gene duplications.
PLD genes from each of the subgroups were found in all
four species of the higher plants examined with the
exception of members of the two small subgroups, ε and
φ, which were absent in the rice and Arabidopsis
genomes, respectively. Presumably, the main subgroups
of the plant PLD gene family were established before the
dicot-monocot lineage parted and before further division
of the dicotyledonous non-woody and woody herbaceous
lineage. The majority of the PLD genes from Poplar
(76.5%, 13/17) and Grape (90.9%, 10/11) clustered more
closely together in the phylogenetic tree than they did
with those from Arabidopsis and rice (Figure 3), suggesting that two woody plants had a closer evolutionary relationship than with the non-woody herbaceous dicot and
the monocot [21]. Five pairs of Poplar PLD genes
(PtPLD10 and PtPLD4, PtPLD17 and PtPLD15, PtPLD6
and PtPLD3, PtPLD13 and PtPLD2, and PtPLD16 and
PtPLD8) formed 5 well-supported subclusters (bootstrap

values of 100%) (left panel in Figure 3), indicating that
they were evolutionarily very closely related. Each pair of
genes in each of the 5 subclusters had very similar structures (right panel in Figure 3), indicating that they originated from relatively recent gene duplications. Four of
these five subclusters also clustered relatively closely with
a similar Grape PLD gene. At least one pair of Grape PLD
genes (VvPLD7 and VvPLD8) clustered sufficiently
closely to suggest that they too arose from a recent duplication event. This Grape subcluster also clustered closely
with a PLD gene from Poplar. Collectively, these results
indicate that frequent gene duplications occurred following the divergence of the Poplar and Grape species and
that in Poplar this resulted in a rapid expansion of the size
of the PLD gene family.
Evolutionary patterns of PLD gene family in Arabidopsis,
rice, Poplar and Grape

Segmental duplication, tandem duplication and transposition events such as retroposition and replicative transposition are the main reasons for gene family expansion
[22]. Two tandem PLD gene duplications have previously
been identified in Arabidopsis (AtPLDγ2-AtPLDγ1AtPLDγ3) and rice (OsPLDα3-OsPLDα4-OsPLDα5)
[6,11]. Chromosomal location analyses of the PLD gene
family in Polar and Grape showed that the majority of the
genes appeared randomly scattered throughout the
genome with the exception of one pair of Grape PLD
genes (VvPLD7/VvPLD8) which were tightly co-located
and thus most likely resulted from a tandem duplication
(Figure 2). This suggests that tandem duplication is not a
major contributory event leading to the expansion of the
PLD gene family in higher plants. Thus, we hypothesized
that, at least in Arabidopsis, rice, Poplar and Grape, segmental duplication and transposition events may have
played a more leading role in the evolution of the PLD
gene family.
To validate this hypothesis, we first selected 13 paralogous PLD gene pairs from the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3)
and subsequently explored the degree to which the protein-coding genes flanking each paralogous pair were
similar. There were 5 pairs of paralogous PLD genes identified in the phylogenetic tree for Poplar (Figure 3). The
identities of the genes flanking both sides of all 5 pairs of
the paralogous Poplar PLD genes were found to be highly
conserved (Table 3), suggesting that all of the paralogous
PLD genes in Poplar arose from segmental duplication
events. Similarly, in rice the protein-coding genes flanking each of the three pairs of PLD paralogous genes identified (OsPLDβ1/OsPLDβ2, OsPLDα1/OsPLDα2, and
OsPLDδ2/OsPLDδ3) were found to be conserved (Table
3). To better explore the mechanisms of the PLD gene
family expansion in Grape, a phylogenetic analysis of only
Grape PLD genes was used to identify paralogous gene
pairs (see Additional file 1). Two additional gene pairs

(VvPLD1/VvPLD10 and VvPLD9/VvPLD11) were thus
identified and protein-coding gene identity was found to
be highly conserved in the regions flanking the genes
VvPLD1 and VvPLD10. Similarly, in Arabidopsis one PLD
gene pair (AtPLDα1/AtPLDα2) with conserved proteincoding genes in their flanking regions was identified
(Table 3).
Taken together, these findings indicate that the mechanisms underlying the gene duplications that have contributed to the expansion of the PLD gene family differ
between the four higher plants examined. In Poplar, segmental duplication accounted for the majority of the gene
duplications identified. In evolutionary terms, most of
these Poplar PLD gene duplications appeared to have
occurred relatively recently and may be associated with
novel functional divergence and adaptation. However, in
Arabidopsis, rice and Grape, both segmental duplication
and transposition events appear to have contributed to
the duplication of the PLD genes. It is worth noting that
some 41.4% of the Grape genome is composed of repetitive/transposable elements [20]. Thus, it is prudent to
propose that transposition events could have been an
important factor governing the expansion of PLD gene
family in this species.
To estimate the evolutionary dates of the segmental
duplication events, Ks was used as the proxy for time and
the conserved protein-coding genes flanking the PLD
gene pairs were thus subjected to Ks calculation (Table 3).
The protein-coding genes flanking the 5 pairs of duplicated genes in Poplar had very consistent mean Ks values
(from 0.2059 to 0.2505), suggesting that the segmental
duplication events in this species occurred within the last
11.31 to 13.76 million years. This time period is subsequent to the time at which the evolutionary lineage of
Poplar and Arabidopsis divided, circa 100-120 million
years ago (Ma), and is consistent with the time (13 Ma)
when a recent large scale genome duplication event is
thought to have occurred in Poplar [23]. The implication

is that, relative to other species, the rapid expansion of
the PLD gene family in Poplar resulted from higher order
genome level processes.
The PLD gene segmental duplication in Grape was estimated to have occurred about 25.09 Ma (mean Ks =
0.7527), which is similar to when this was observed in
Poplar. The observation that there are fewer PLD genes in
Grape compared to Poplar may be due to the fact that
Grape experienced two genome wide duplication (GWD)
events during evolution compared to three in Poplar
[24,25].
For rice, the segmental duplication event was estimated
to have occurred between 69.41 to 76.70 Ma, which is
subsequent to the time of divergence of the monocots
and eudicots (170-235 Ma), but precedent to the time of
the origin of the grasses (55-70 Ma) [26-28]. The earliest
observed segmental duplication event occurred in the
PLD genes of Arabidopsis around 88.39 Ma. It is interesting, therefore, that despite similar levels of GWD, Arabidopsis has comparably fewer PLD genes than Poplar. It is
likely that this may due to the fact that the Arabidopsis
genome has subsequently suffered a high level of gene
loss [20,29].
Functional divergence and driving forces for genetic
divergence

Site-specific shift rates (Type-I functional divergence)
reflect the difference in the evolutionary rate of change of
specific amino acid sites in proteins following gene duplication [30,31]. In order to detect the Type-I functional
divergence occurring in the PLDs, we determined the differences in the site-specific evolutionary rates of amino
acid changes between the C2-PLD and PXPH-PLD clades
(Figure 3) using the program DIVERGE. The results
showed a significant evidence of type I functional divergence between the C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs (θI = 0.64,
P < 0.01, see Additional file 2). When the threshold values
of posterior probability (Qk) were set to either 0.80 or

Liu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:117
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/117

0.90, 75 and 40 amino acid sites, respectively, were determined to be associated with the functional divergence of
the C2- and PXPH-PLDs (see Additional file 2).
Positive Darwinian selection has been reported to be
associated with gene duplication and functional divergence. To explore whether positive selection drove evolution of the PLD gene family, the coding regions of
thirteen PLD gene paralogs from Arabidopsis, rice, Poplar and Grape were subjected to sliding window analyses.
The nonsynonymous (dN)/synonymous substitution (dS)
ratio (ω = dN/dS) is generally used to identify positive
selection. A dN/dS (also known as Ka/Ks) ratio >1, <1
and = 1 indicates positive, negative, or purifying selection, and neutral evolution, respectively [32]. We calculated the dN/dS ratios for all the paralogs depicted in the
phylogenetic tree reported in Figure 3 with a sliding window of 300 bp and a moving step of 50 bp. The resulting
pairwise comparison data showed that all the paralogous
genes have dN/dS ratios of <1 except for the comparisons
OsPLDα4 vs. OsPLDα5 and OsPLDβ1 vs. OsPLDβ2 (see
Additional file 3), strongly suggesting that the PLD gene
family had mainly experienced strong purifying selection
pressure. Here, the action of such purifying selection on
the duplicated Poplar PLD genes supports the observation that the rapid expansion of the PLD family in this
species resulted from higher order genome level processes. The gene pair, OsPLDα4 and OsPLDα5, clustered
closely together (bootstrap values of 100%) and exhibited
very similar exon/intron structures (Figure 3), suggesting
that they were derived from relatively recent gene duplication event. The gene pair OsPLDβ1 and OsPLDβ2 also
appeared to be similarly derived. Pairwise comparisons
between OsPLDα4 and OsPLDα5 and between OsPLDβ1
and OsPLDβ2 exhibited ω values >1 in some regions,
especially in the N termini of the proteins (see Additional
file 3), suggesting that a more recent episode of positive
selection has occurred after the gene duplication event.
To further investigate the evolutionary selection pressures acting on the PLDs, a site-specific model was formulated using the Codeml program of PAML 4.0 [33]
with sequences from the C2-, PXPH- and SP-PLD clades.
Consistent with the pairwise comparison results, when
using the robust codon-substitution model in PAML,
purifying selection was also determined to have acted on
the C2-PLDs (see Additional file 4). Such a selection pressure may indicate that strong functional constraints have
a bearing on the evolution of the C2-PLDs, supporting
the notion that this group of the PLDs have important
and essential roles in the regulation of plant cellular processes. Conversely, the concept that purifying selection is
the main evolutionary mode of amino acid change in the
C2-PLDs, along with the fact that the majority (12/13) of
duplicated PLD genes belong to this clade, implies that
C2-PLD gene duplication is unlikely to be associated with

Page 8 of 15

the formation of PLDs of either novel or divergent function.
In contrast, positive selection was observed to have
occurred during the evolution of the PXPH-PLDs and
SP-PLDs. Weak (ω = 1.34) and strong (ω = 8.14) positive
selections were determined to have acted on the PXPHPLDs and SP-PLDs, respectively. Although not reaching
significant levels (posterior probabilities >0.90), one (site
627) and 3 (sites 3, 18 and 23) positively selected amino
acid sites were identified in the PXPH- and SP-PLDs,
respectively (see Additional file 4).
Plants possess relatively few PXPH- and SP-PLD genes
in comparison to the numbers of C2-PLD genes found in
their genomes (Figure 4). Thus, the positive selection that
has acted on the PXPH- and SP-PLD genes may imply
that their functional diversification has resulted from the
need to adapt to a changing environment.
Domains and Motifs analyses in PLD gene family

The proteins encoded by the newly identified Poplar and
Grape PLD genes were subjected to protein domain analyses. The program hmmpfam in HMMer [34] was used
initially to identify the major domains of the PLD proteins. Such domain analyses for Arabidopsis and rice
PLDs has been previously performed [6,11]. Here, the
analyses showed that the all the PLDs in Poplar and
Grape possessed the two characteristic and structurally
conserved HKD domains essential for their lipase activity. As in the case of Arabidopsis and rice, the Poplar and
Grape PLDs could be classified into the three subgroups
(C2-, PXPH- and SP-PLD), based on the presence of the
subgroup-specific domains (Figure 4). As expected, in
their N-terminal regions the C2-PLDs contained one C2
domain while the PXPH-PLDs contained both PX and
PH domains and an N-terminal signal peptide was identified in each of the SP-PLDs (Figure 4).
Such domain search tools are suitable for defining the
presence or absence of roughly recognisable domains, but
they are unable to recognize either smaller individual
motifs or more divergent patterns. Thus, we used the
motif search tool MEME/MAST to mine for more
detailed motif information (see Additional file 5) in the
PLDs of the four higher plants examined. The thirty
motifs identified by MEME were annotated by InterProScan [35]. The result showed that, except for motifs
20, 25, 27 and 29, the majority of these domains were
functionally associated with PLD activity (see Additional
file 6). For analytical convenience, we divided the data
into parts covering three regions of the PLDs: the N-terminal region before the first HKD domain, the middle
region including the region in and between the two HKD
domains, and the C-terminal region after the second
HKD domain (Figure 5).
The N-terminal region of the C2-PLDs contained 10
motifs, compared with 6 motifs in the same region of the

PXPH-PLDs (Figure 5A). Four motifs found in the N-termini of the C2-PLDs (20, 17, 24 and 12) appeared specific
to this PLD clade (see Additional file 7) and have been
suggested to take part in the formation of an eight
βstrand switch involved in Ca2+-binding [36]. Motifs 28
and 29 appeared to be specific to the PX domain and
motif 30 to the PH domain of the PXPH-PLDs (see Additional file 8), and are thought to be associated with the
binding of phosphatidylinositol lipids [36]. One observed
exception was AtPLDγ3 that contained an additional
motif, 13, in the C2 domain. Additionally, in OsPLDα7,
PtPLD10, PtPLD14, VvPLD5, AtPLDα3, AtPLDε and
AtPLDγ2 the C2 domain appeared to have lost either one
or two of the four motifs mentioned above that are associated with the binding of Ca2+ (see Additional file 5). The
N-terminal region of the C2-PLDs, the region behind C2
domain (referred to as the post-C2 region) usually
included the 6 motifs 22, 10, 6, 8, 9, and 15. A degree of
loss of some of these motifs was observed in some of the
C2-PLDs from each of the four species examined. For
example, AtPLDε, VvPLD5, VvPLD2, PtPLD14, PtPLD17,
PtPLD6, PtPLD3 and OsPLDα7 appear to have lost either

one or both of motifs 22 and 15 (see Additional file 5). In
contrast, no motif loss was observed in the PXPH-PLDs,
possibly due to the small number of members of this subgroup and the relatively small number of motifs in the Nterminal region of these PLDs. Both the C2-PLDs and
PXPH-PLDs shared two conserved motifs, 6 and 8,
implying a crucial role for these in PLD function.
The middle region of the PLDs contained 11 and 7
motifs in the C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs, respectively.
There appeared to be a relatively higher level of conservation in this region between the C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs
as they shared 5 motifs (5, 4, 3, 14 and 1). The middle
region of the C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs started from the
C-terminal ends of motifs 15 and 26, respectively, and
ended with motif 1 that formed the HKD2 domain. The
C-terminal sequences of motifs 15 and 26 are identical
and, together with motif 5, formed the HKD1 domain
(see Additional file 9). Thus, these two sections of the
middle region appeared identical in both the C2-PLDs
and PXPH-PLDs (Figure 5A). Comparative sequence
alignment of the two HKD domains revealed that the
HKD1 domain sequence was relatively more diverse than

Figure 5 MEME/MAST domain analysis and schematic diagram for main motif structures of PLD genes. Panel A shows the motif structures of
the PLD genes in three parts: the N-terminal region before the first HKD domain, the middle region including the region in and between the two HKD
domains, the C-terminal region after the second HKD domain. Panel B shows the regular-expression sequences of the thirty motifs.

that of the HKD2 domain (Figure 6, see Additional file 9).
Both the HKD1 and HKD2 domains contained three
highly conserved amino acids (6H, 8K and 13D), implying
that these have a key functional importance within these
domains. It would appear that the two HKD domains
have co-evolved within the PLD family. Phylogenetic
analysis of the HKD1 and HKD2 domains, respectively,
produced two trees that exhibited similar topology (see
Additional file 10) to that revealed by the same analysis of
the PLD gene family. The HKD domain trees clustered
similarly into 5 subgroups, with gene members clustering
in an almost identical fashion to that observed when the
full length PLDs were so analysed.
Three other motifs (4, 3 and 14) in the middle region
were also shared by both the C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs.
Motif 4 contained a regular-expression sequence
"[GK]GPR[EQ]PWHD[LIV]H[CS][KR][IL][ED]GPA[YW

]DVLTNFE[QE]RWRK[AQ]G[G][PW][KD]GLVK" (Figure 5B) which is thought to form the binding site of PIP2.
Variations in the sequence of this motif exhibit different
PIP2 binding affinity [8,37,38]. Sequence alignment of
motif 4 from the individual PLDs showed that 73.2% (30/
41) of the amino acid sites were highly conserved with 10
of them being fully conserved, suggesting that they may
play an essential role in the binding of both C2-PLDs and
PXPH-PLDs to PIP2 (see Additional file 11). Motif 3 contained a regular-expression sequence "IYIENQ[FY]F"
(Figure 5B). The seventh amino acid of this regularexpression sequence, Phe (F), appeared in all PXPHPLDs, but was often substituted by Tyr (Y) in the C2PLDs (see Additional file 12). This short sequence was
only found in the PLD family members, and has been
postulated to increase the rate of catalysis and ensure
substrate specificity [8]. This suggests that the sequence

"IYIENQ[FY]F" may be almost as critical as the HKD
motif for PLD activity [39,40]. In addition, motif 14 was
also found in both the C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs (see
Additional file 13). Four amino acid sites in this motif
were shown to be highly conserved, especially the eighth
amino acid, tyrosine, which was fully conserved. With the
exception of these four conserved amino acid sites, the
remainder of motif 14 exhibited a high degree of
sequence polymorphism.
Apart from these shared motifs, the C2-PLDs and
PXPH-PLDs possessed a number of clade-specific motifs
within their middle regions. The C2-PLDs had 5 such
motifs (21, 27, 11, 2 and13) and the PXPH-PLDs one
motif, 23 (Figure 5A). The C2-PLD-specific motif 2 contained a core triplet of amino acids, "ERF", followed by a
highly conserved hydrophobic region, "VYVVV" (see
Additional file 14). in AtPLDα1, this motif was reported
as being able to bind to the Gα subunit of the Arabidopsis
heterotrimeric G protein [41]. When the sequences of
motif 2 from the different C2-PLDs were aligned, the ERF
triplet appeared to be relatively more conserved than the
"VYVVV" region. However, mutations that have occurred
in OsPLDα7, AtPLDγ2, and OsPLDδ2 changed the second residue of the ERF triplet from the basic amino acid
R into the non-charged amino acids S, N and Q, respectively, implying a possible change in the ability of these
PLDs to bind to the heterotrimeric G protein Gα subunit
[41].

In the C-terminal region, the C2-PLDs contained 4
motifs (25, 7, 19 and 16) and the PXPH-PLDs 2 motifs (18
and 19) (Figure5), thus sharing the single motif 19.
Overall, 8 motifs (6, 8, 5, 4, 3, 14, 1 and 19) were shown
to be shared by both the C2- and PXPH-PLDs subgroups,
implying that they are likely to be necessary for PLD
function. The majority of these conserved motifs
appeared to exist in the middle region of the PLDs,
strongly suggesting that the two HKD domains in this
region play a key role in the lipase activity of the PLDs.

Conclusion
In this study, we have provided a genome-wide identification and analysis of the PLD gene family in Poplar and
Grape. Eighteen and 11 members of the PLD gene family
were identified in Poplar and Grape, respectively. Phylogenetic and gene structure analyses showed that the PLD
gene family can be divided into 6 subgroups (α, β/γ, δ, ε,
ζ, and φ) and that these 6 PLD subgroups originated from
4 original ancestors through a series of gene duplications.
Phylogenetically, the majority of the PLD genes from
Poplar (82.8%, 14/17) and Grape (90.9%, 10/11) clustered
particularly closely, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship between these two species. Five pairs of duplicated PLD genes were identified in Poplar, more than
those identified in Grape, suggesting that frequent gene
duplication occurred after the species diverged resulting
in a rapid expansion of the PLD gene family in Poplar.

The majority of gene duplications in Poplar appeared to
have been caused by segmental duplication, distinguishing it from the other three plant species, Arabidopsis, rice
and Grape, where both segmental duplication and transposition events appeared to have contributed to the
duplication of the PLD genes. Furthermore, the PLD gene
duplications in Poplar were estimated to have occurred
between 11.31 to 13.76 Ma, substantially later than the
time when duplications occurred in the other three plant
species (25.09 to 88.39 Ma). Adaptive evolution analysis
showed that purifying selection has driven evolution of
the C2-PLDs, whereas positive selection has contributed,
at least in part, to the evolution of the remaining PLDs,
especially after gene duplication.
The PLD gene family is divided into two main subfamilies, C2-PLDs and PXPH-PLDs, and one smaller subfamily, SP-PLDs. Motif analyses show that the C2-PLDs and
PXPH-PLDs generally contain 23 and 17 motifs, respectively. Among these, 8 motifs were shared by both the C2and PXPH-PLDs subfamilies, implying that they may be
necessary for PLD function. The majority of these shared
motifs exist in the middle region of the PLDs, suggesting
that the two HKD domains also play a core role in PLD
activity.
This detailed analysis of the PLD gene family in these
two woody plants has provided the data that will form the
basis for future hypothesis-driven experiments involving
either loss- or gain-of-function studies aimed at clarifying
the role of the different PLDs in the growth, development
and survival of Poplar and Grape. Thus, this new knowledge of the PLD gene family in these species may lead to
the possibility of modulating PLD gene expression and
function in order to control specific aspects of the physiology and development of woody plants.

Methods
Identification of PLD gene families in Poplar and Grape

To identify members of the PLD gene family in Poplar
and Grape, multiple database searches were performed.
Arabidopsis PLD gene sequences were retrieved from
http://www.arabidopsis.org and used as queries to perform repetitive blast searches against the Poplar Genome
(V1.1) database http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1_1/
Poptr1_1.home.html and the Genoscope Genome Project
Grape genome database http://www.cns.fr/. Blast
searches were also performed against nucleic acid
sequence data repositories at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov. Genes annotated as "Phospholipases D" or "PLD"
were also collected by keyword searches in Genbank.
Additionally, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) search
was performed in the proteome databases of Poplar and
Grape using HKD domain HMM profiles (PFAM,
PF00614). Profile searches were performed using the
HMMER 2.3.2 software package [34]. All protein

Page 12 of 15

sequences derived from the candidate PLD genes collected were examined using the domain analysis programs, PFAM http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ and SMART
http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/ with the default cut off
parameters. Gene sequences with two HKD domains
were considered to be members of the PLD gene family.
Pseudogenes were determined according to their gene
annotation or when their coding sequences were obviously terminated by premature stop codons.
Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of PLD gene family

PLD gene sequences were aligned using the program
Clustal X with BLOSUM30 as the protein weight matrix.
The program MUSCLE (version 3.52) was also used to
perform multiple sequence alignments to confirm the
Clustal X data output [42]. Phylogenetic trees based on
the protein sequences of the PLDs were constructed
using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method of the program
MEGA4 [43] with p-distance and the complete deletion
option parameters engaged. The reliability of the trees
obtained was tested using bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. Images of the phylogenetic trees were also drawn
using MEGA4.
Chromosomal location and Gene structure of PLD genes

PLD gene chromosomal locations were determined using
the Poplar genome browser http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
Poptr1_1/optr1_1.home.html and Grape genome
browser http://www.cns.fr/externe/Genome Browser/
Vitis/, respectively. Gene intron/extron structure information was collected from the genome annotations of
Poplar and Grape from NCBI.
Protein Motif analysis

In order to investigate protein motifs in more detail, the
PLD protein sequences were analyzed using the MEME/
MAST software http://meme.sdsc.edu/[44,45]. The functional annotation of the identified motifs was implemented by InterProScan http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
InterProScan/.
Analysis of PLD gene expansion patterns

Segmental (chromosomal segments) duplication, tandem duplication (duplications in a tandem pattern) and
transposition events result in gene family expansion [46].
Transposition occurs when a segment from one chromosome becomes unaligned with the corresponding segment from the other chromosome. Because it is difficult
to identify transposition events based on gene sequence
analysis, in this study we focused on the processes of segmental and tandem duplication. To categorize expansion
of the PLD gene family, we examined the chromosomal
locations of all members of this family in Arabidopsis,
rice, Poplar and Grape. Tandem duplication was characterized by multiple gene family members occurring
within either the same or neighboring intergenic regions.

A method similar to that of Maher et al. [47] was used to
identify segmental duplications. First paralogous PLD
genes were identified at the terminal nodes of the phylogenetic tree. Next, 10 protein-coding genes upstream and
downstream of each pair of paralogs were obtained from
the annotated genomes of Arabidopsis, rice, Poplar and
Grape. Lastly, the similarity between the genes flanking
one PLD gene and those flanking the other PLD gene in
each pair of paralogs was determined. A pair of paralogous PLD genes was considered to have originated from a
duplication event if both resided within a region of conserved protein-coding genes.
Calculating Ks to date the duplication events and adaptive
evolution analysis of PLD gene family

Pairwise alignment of nucleotide sequences of PLD paralogs was performed using Clustal X1.83. Gaps in the
alignments were removed manually by Bioedit. The Ka
and Ks values of the paralogous genes were estimated by
the program K-Estimator 6.0 [48]. To better explain the
patterns of macro-evolution, estimates of the evolutionary rates were considered extremely useful. Assuming a
molecular clock, the synonymous substitution rates (Ks)
of duplicated genes would be expected to be similar over
time [49]. Thus, Ks could be used as the proxy for time
and the conserved flanking protein-coding genes was
used to estimate the dates of the segmental duplication
events. The mean Ks value was calculated for each of
duplicated gene pairs and then used to date the duplication events. Ks values greater than 2.0 were discarded in
order to avoid the risk of saturation. The Ks values were
then used to calculate the approximate date of the duplication event(T = Ks/2λ), assuming clock-like rates (λ) of
synonymous substitution of 1.5 × 10 -8 substitutions/synonymous site/year for Arabidopsis [50], 6.5 × 10 -9 for rice
[51], 9.1 × 10 -9 for Poplar [52], and 6.5 × 10 -9 for Grape
[53]. To investigate whether Darwinian positive selection
was involved in driving gene divergence after duplication,
first Sliding Window analysis (300 bp window, 50 bp
slide) was performed on the coding regions of paralogous
PLD genes from the four plant species studied and was
then used to calculate the Ka/Ks ratio. Subsequently, the
codon-based site model of codeml in PAML [33] was
used to perform adaptive evolution analysis on the three
different types of PLD genes separately.
