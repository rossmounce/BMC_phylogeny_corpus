Abstract
Background: Although recent reports on congenital malaria suggest that the incidence is
increasing, it is difficult to determine whether the clinical disease is due to parasites acquired before
delivery or as a result of contamination by maternal blood at birth. Understanding of the method
of parasite acquisition is important for estimating the time incidence of congenital malaria and
design of preventive measures. The aim of this study was to determine whether the first Plasmodium
falciparum malaria disease in infants is due to same parasites present on the placenta at birth.
Methods: Babies born to mothers with P. falciparum parasites on the placenta detected by PCR
were followed up to two years and observed for malaria episodes. Paired placental and infant
peripheral blood samples at first malaria episode within first three months of life were genotyped
(msp2) to determine genetic relatedness. Selected amplifications from nested PCR were sequenced
and compared between pairs.
Results: Eighteen (19.1%) out of 95 infants who were followed up developed clinical malaria within
the first three months of age. Eight pairs (60%) out of 14 pairs of sequenced placental and cord
samples were genetically related while six (40%) were genetically unrelated. One pair (14.3%) out
of seven pairs of sequenced placental and infants samples were genetically related. In addition,
infants born from primigravidae mothers were more likely to be infected with P. falciparum (P <
0.001) as compared to infants from secundigravidae and multigravidae mothers during the two
years of follow up. Infants from multigravidae mothers got the first P. falciparum infection earlier
than those from secundigravidae and primigravidae mothers (RR = 1.43).
Conclusion: Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites present on the placenta as detected by PCR
are more likely to result in clinical disease (congenital malaria) in the infant during the first three
months of life. However, sequencing data seem to question the validity of this likelihood.
Therefore, the relationship between placental parasites and first clinical disease need to be
confirmed in larger studies.

Background
About 300,000 foetal and infants deaths and 2,500 deaths
of pregnant women are attributable to malaria [1]. Poor
outcome for both mother and foetus is associated with
pregnancy malaria and results in premature delivery,
intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal mortality, anaemia, abortion, low birth weight and death of the mother
[2,3]. Moreover, perinatal malaria infection may cause
cord parasitaemia, early neonatal malaria, as well as neonatal malaria. When the placenta is infected with malaria
parasites, transplacental transmission of the parasites can
occur, although the born infant may remain asymptomatic and healthy [4].
Congenital malaria infection refers to diagnosis of malaria
parasites in the newborn within seven days of birth, or
later if there is no possibility of postpartum infection by
either mosquito bite or blood transfusion. On the other
hand, neonatal malaria may be defined as symptoms
attributed to malaria parasites in the erythrocytes of an
infant within the first twenty-eight days of life [5]. The
mechanism of transplacental passage of this infection is
not clear. Many reports on congenital malaria have been
published, showing that the incidence has recently
increased. However, it is difficult from reported cases to
determine whether this represents infection of the foetus
before delivery or contamination by maternal blood at
birth producing a replicating infection in the newborn.
Infants below three months of age have been reported to
have less incidence, severity, parasitaemia and death from
malaria [6]. The current study was carried out to determine whether the first falciparum infection of infants
within the first three months of life arose from congenitally acquired placental infection, in view of providing
useful information on the understanding of the source of
parasites in congenital malaria and development of
immunity in infants at risk of acquiring malaria.

Methods
Study area
The study was conducted at Muheza District Designated
Hospital, in Muheza District, north-east Tanzania.
Muheza district, (5°42' S and 38°48'E) has a human population of 278,405 and the inhabitants are mainly
involved in subsistence agricultural production. The district is served by one district hospital, three health centres
and 32 dispensaries. The lowland areas of the districts are
areas of intense transmission [7]. The entomologic inoculation rate in the area has been described as approximately
34 in the highlands and 400 infected mosquito bites each
year in the lowlands [8].
Study population
The study population comprised of mothers aged between
18 and 45 years who had placental Plasmodium falciparum

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/1/117

parasites and their respective neonates. Recruitment of the
study participants was done from September 2002 to September 2005 from maternity ward at Muheza DDH and
1,022 mother-neonate pairs were screened. Mothers diagnosed with placental parasitaemia identified in a blood
smear by microscopy and their respective neonates were
enrolled in the study. Mothers with evidence of chronic or
debilitating illness, such as recent significant weight loss,
chronic diarrhoea, or history of chronic illness were
excluded. All infants born from mothers diagnosed with
placental parasitaemia were seen at birth and at two-week
intervals for two years for full clinical examination and
blood sampling, either at the Muheza Designated District
Hospital or at the Projects sponsored mobile clinics that
rotated through study villages on a weekly basis. Written
informed consent was obtained from the mother prior to
recruitment into the study.
Demographic information on maternal age, village of residence, gravidity, history of intermittent presumptive
therapy (IPT) against malaria during pregnancy, abortion
or miscarriage;as well as baby information on birthweight
and gestation age were collected by trained nurses at
enrollment. Bed net usage was assessed by village health
workers during clinical visits and onsite home visits. The
study protocol was approved by the International Clinical
Studies Review Committee of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes
of Health, and ethical clearance was obtained from the
Institutional Review Boards of Seattle Biomedical
Research Institute and the National Institute for Medical
Research in Tanzania.
Sample collection
Blood samples of study mothers diagnosed positive for P.
falciparum by microscopy were collected by the project
staff nurses from placental tissues, umbilical cord and
through either finger or heel prick of new born infants.
Placental blood samples were obtained after delivery by
mechanically grinding full thickness placental tissue [9].
Cord blood was collected by cannulation of the thoroughly cleaned umbilical vessels while keeping the cord
clamped. Blood samples from healthy infants were collected by heel prick every two weeks and at the time of any
illness through mobile clinics until when they presented
with first infection. In order to determine the outcome of
placental malaria, all infants from mothers diagnosed
with placental parasitaemia were followed for two years.
All placental samples from these mothers tested P. falciparum positive in their thick smears and all infants born
from these mothers who presented with parasitaemia
within three months from birth were selected for further
analysis by PCR. In order to analyse the phenomenon of
malaria infections of neonates via transmission across the
placental, matched umbilical cord blood samples were

examined in thick blood smear and further analysed
whether negative by Giemsa stain or not. About 10 μl of
blood samples were bloated on 0.5 × 2 cm strips of 3 MM
Whatman filter papers and dried in a laminar flow hood.
After drying, the filter papers were packed in small individual plastic bags to avoid contamination and stored at
room temperature until needed for analysis.
Extraction of parasite DNA and PCR amplification
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood collected on 3
MM Whatmann filter papers using Generation® capture
card kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, USA). The DNA
was amplified in two nested PCR using oligonucleotide
primers of the 5' and 3' conserved regions as described by
[10]. The details of two sets primer sequences used in the
PCR for DNA amplification are shown in Table 1. PCR
conditions included 94°C-1 min, 50.3°C-1 min, 72°C-45
sec., × 40, 72°C-5 min, 4°C-hold. In both reactions nest
one and two PCR, reaction volumes ranged between 25 μl
to 50 μl and the final concentration contained,5 mM Tris
HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mg of gelatin per ml, 2.5
mM MgCl2, 200 μM mixture of dNTPs (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), and 0.25 U/μl of Taq polymerase
(Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). To each PCR tubes, 5
μl of DNA was added in primary reaction and 2 μl was reamplified in the nested PCR reaction and carried out in a
PTC®-100 Peltier. The expected lengths of the bands were
509 bp and 750 bp and the previously established DNA
positive control sample used was 3D7. In all PCR reactions a negative control sample with no template DNA
was used.
Gel electrophoresis
Gel electrophoresis was performed on nested PCR products to confirm the presence of PCR amplicons size of
interest. Placental-cord pair, placental-infants first parasitaemia and placental-cord and infants first parasitaemia
samples were run in parallel in the 2% agarose gel in 100
ml of 1 × TBE (100 mM Tris, 100 mM borate and 5 nM
EDTA) solution. The gels were stained with 0.5 μg/ml
ethidium bromide final concentration and the similarities
and differences of the bands size was visualized by ultraviolet light. Fragment sizes were estimated using a DNA
size marker (10 μl of 100 kb ladder, GeneRuler™DNA ladders). Nest two PCR products with single bands were purified by QIAquick PCR product purification kit using

microcentrifuge before sequencing. For samples which
presented more than one band (more than one genotype), the gel were cut along those bands that share the
size, purified by QIAquick Gel extraction kit and then
sequenced.
Sequencing method
DNA sequencing was done on nest two amplicons [11]. In
preparation for sequencing, excess dNTPs and unincorporated primers were eliminated from DNA by purification
using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). DNA
sequencing was performed by fluorescence-based technique with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 377
automated DNA sequencer. The purified PCR products,
one prepared template were sequenced for each msp2 and
the second template were sequenced if differences were
found between the two derived sequences.
Data analysis
Data were analysed using STARTVIEW statistical package.
Descriptive analysis used to evaluate the means of the different variables. Paired t- tests were used to analyse and
determine significance relationship between difference
observed variables. Regression plots that showed the variability around means of different variables and P value <
0.05 in the analysis was considered to be significant. Chisquare test was used to determine the proportional of the
placental parasitaemia among gravity (primigravid,
secundigravid and multigravid). A DNASTAR Program
was used to analyse the sequencing results and all results
were compared with msp2 sequences in Plasmodium
genome resources or Plasmodium database (PlasmoDB) by
Basic Logical Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) so as to
determine if each individual sequence matched with concordant msp2 gene of P. falciparum sequences previously
deposited.

Results
Study population
By using PCR, placenta malaria was identified in 95 out of
100 microscopy-positive mothers and out of these 40
(42.1%) were primigravidae, 31 (34.7%) secundigravidae
and 24 (25.2%) multigravidae. The mean weight of 95
babies born from placental malaria was 2.9kg with the
range of 2–4.3 kg and 14.9% babies were below average
birth weight while the mean gestation age was 36.3 weeks

(range; 32–40 weeks). Seventy-six out of 95 (79.8%)
infants were born before the normal gestation age. Infants
born from mothers diagnosed with placental malaria during delivery, presented with the first clinical malaria at the
mean age of 11 weeks (range; 8–64) weeks.
The prevalence of P. falciparum infection in placental, cord
blood and infant's peripheral blood at first parasitaemia
as diagnosed by microscopy and PCR are presented in
Table 2. However, five (0.5%) of placental blood samples,
which were positive by blood smear were negative by PCR
regardless of repeat procedure. Twenty-three placental
and five infant's peripheral blood sample had multiple
infections (more than one strain of msp2 genes).
Sequencing
Fourteen pairs of placental and cord blood samples that
shared the same band size following PCR were sequenced
and analysed using DNASTAR program. Sequenced samples were paired based on similarities using Megalign program. Eight (60%) out of 14 pairs were genetically related
while six pairs (40%) were genetically unrelated by the
difference of few nucleotides estimated at 10%. In addition, seven pairs of infant's samples at first parasitaemia
and corresponding placental samples shared same band
size by PCR and were sequenced. Upon megalignment,
one pair (14.3%) was genetically related by 100% while
six pairs (85.7%) were genetically unrelated.

Comparisons of P. falciparum genotypes between and
within pairs were also made. The comparison was
between PCR results by looking at the bands which shared
the same sizes, and sequencing results through alignment
of the sequences in the phylogenetic tree. Some of the
msp2 genes observed to be sharing the band size by PCR,
had sequences not closely aligned in the tree. Nevertheless, pairs that were genetically related or closely genetically related by PCR were closely arranged in the tree
leaves. Analysis from Plasmodium database (PlasmoDB)
by Basic Logical Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) indicated
that all samples originated from the msp2 gene of P. falciparum.
Placental malaria outcome
The prevalence of placental malaria which lead to symptomatic first parasitaemia significantly decreased as the

gravidity increased (Regression coefficients, t = 4.8, P <
0.001) (Figure 1). Infants born from primigravidae were
significantly more likely to be infected with P. falciparum
(regression coefficients, t = 5.5, P < 0.001) as compared to
infants born from multigravidae. It was observed that 8
out of 18 (44.4%) infants that presented with clinical
malaria within three months after birth were from multigravidae mothers. Infants diagnosed with cord malaria by
PCR were observed to be more susceptible to P. falciparum
infection in their early life as compared to the infants that
were cord negative, with the relative risk (RR) of 2.6 (Figure 2).

Discussion
Malaria during pregnancy may results in foetal exposure
when malaria parasites are transmitted across the placenta. In this study, prevalence of cord malaria as diagnosed by PCR was 6%. This result differs with findings by
Kassberger [12], who reported 17 of the 37 (46%) of cord
blood samples to be positive by PCR, while Motoi [13]
diagnosed cord malaria in one baby (0.33%) by PCR, but
not detected by blood smear. Prevalence differences
between these studies could be due to confounding factors like geographical location. Studies in Africa suggest
that 7–10% of newborn may have malaria in their cord
blood though may not show evidence of active infection.
High number of PCR positivity in the cord blood samples
can be explained by the high sensitivity of the PCR technique [14,15], compared to microscopy. In additional,
malaria parasites macromolecules and not live parasites
cross the placenta and may be detected by PCR [12].
Surprisingly in this study, five of placental samples which
were positive by microscopy were negative by PCR. Possible explanations include low concentrations of DNA in

the placental samples, presence of point mutations at the
positions where the msp2 specific primers anneal and the
presence of haemoglobin in the DNA extracts [12].
The msp 2 gene can share PCR band sizes but is not an
indication that the two parasites are necessarily genetically related. The sequencing results indicated that the
diversity occurred due to the existence of clonal diversity
in the study population. The differences between msp2 of
P. falciparum parasites in the population of the analysed
samples (observed between and within placental, cords
blood and infants first parasitaemia) may be explained by
the structural diversity in the msp2 gene, which is due to
the central domain containing repeats that vary in
number, length and sequence as previously proposed [1619].
More than one P. falciparum parasite strain (multiple
infections) may sequester in the placenta while only one
strain crosses the placental and can be detected in the cord
blood [12,20,21]. This may partly be explain the observation of placental and cord blood sample pairs that were
genetically unrelated upon sequencing. The described
method of cord blood sample collection was designed to
minimize possible cord blood contamination with placental blood and its unlikely that cord blood contamination had significantly contributed to the observation
which indicates that at least one strain from the presented
complex infection in the placenta crossed to the cord. The
stage of pregnancy at which parasites cross the placenta is
unknown. Therefore, the majority of pairs (placental and
infants), which were generically unrelated, may be partly
or wholly attributed to P. falciparum population from the

placenta to the cord, which causes clinical malaria in
infants.
The findings from this study confirm that the parasite
were congenitally acquired from the placenta suggesting
that although neonates are thought to be immune to
malaria, a proportional of them do get the disease as a
result of transplacental transmission. Some explanation
to the absence of parasites in the new-born includes the
failure of parasites to grow in cord blood and fast elimination of parasites from the foetal circulation [22,23].
Findings from this study and others [24] suggest that placental malaria especially for primigravid may increase
malaria risk in offspring. Overall, offspring of placental
malaria positive mothers and infants diagnosed with cord
malaria experienced their first parasitaemia at a significantly younger age. The risk of early first parasitaemia is
highest among offspring of multigravid. This concurs with
the findings from a previous study by Mutabingwa [24].
The reason may be that among primigravidae, the pronounced inflammatory response to placental malaria
could confer protection by reducing parasitaemia [25]. In
Malawi, high placental parasite densities were associated
with increased risk of cord blood parasitaemia [4], supporting the conjuncture that congenital malaria could
account for the relationship between placental malaria
and susceptibility of infants [26]. In this study, more
primigravidae were infected with malaria parasites than
multigravidae, indicating the former to be at a higher risk
than the later group. These observations are consistent
with the findings of previous studies in malaria- endemic
regions where among several factors gravidity independ-

ently influenced the occurrence of placental malaria
[27,28]. It has been suggested that multigravid mothers
develop malaria antibodies, which block adhesion of parasites to chondroitin sulphate A receptors in the placenta
in subsequent pregnancies [29].
Placental malaria has been observed to have a negative
outcome to the newborn. We observed similar negative
outcome in this study where the mean gestation age were
below the normal range (37 – 40) weeks in most infants
born from mothers with placental malaria [30]. These
findings suggest that women who had pre-term delivery
could have been due to parasitization of placenta. The
observation is consistent with the findings of previous
studies [28,31]. However, some studies have reported
conflicting results [28]. Low birth weight was associated
with parasitization of the placenta. A similar association
was observed elsewhere in malaria endemic sub-Saharan
Africa [1,32]. The mean birth weight and low birth weight
in this study were higher than those reported previously
by other investigators [27,28,33]. Differences in these
reports could be due to several factors, such as intensity of
infection, proportion of primigravidae and or severity of
infection, maternal nutrition are also important causes of
low birth weight [34].

Conclusion
In conclusion, transplacental transmission of P. falciparum
that may lead to congenital malaria does occur as previously reported. The occurrence has important consequences for foetal and newborn development. Direct
infection to the foetus could contribute to prematurity,
low birth weight or increase likelihood of early and subsequent infant infections. However, the genetic unrelatedness of P. falciparum, which was detected in the placenta
and infants below three months of age, signifies a rarity of
congenital malaria and could be associated with the
occurrence of maternal malaria. Further investigation of
these relationships with assessment of other potential
confounders, as well as their impact on infant's mortality
and morbidity need to be done. Malaria prevention measures in pregnant women such as insecticide-treated nets
and intermittent presumptive treatment should be a priority for malaria control programmes to prevent low birth
weight, anaemia, intrauterine growth retardation, premature delivery and neonatal malaria.
