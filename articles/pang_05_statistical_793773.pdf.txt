Abstract
Background: The inference of homology from statistically significant sequence similarity is a
central issue in sequence alignments. So far the statistical distribution function underlying the
optimal global alignments has not been completely determined.
Results: In this study, random and real but unrelated sequences prepared in six different ways
were selected as reference datasets to obtain their respective statistical distributions of global
alignment scores. All alignments were carried out with the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and
optimal scores were fitted to the Gumbel, normal and gamma distributions respectively. The threeparameter gamma distribution performs the best as the theoretical distribution function of global
alignment scores, as it agrees perfectly well with the distribution of alignment scores. The normal
distribution also agrees well with the score distribution frequencies when the shape parameter of
the gamma distribution is sufficiently large, for this is the scenario when the normal distribution can
be viewed as an approximation of the gamma distribution.
Conclusion: We have shown that the optimal global alignment scores of random protein
sequences fit the three-parameter gamma distribution function. This would be useful for the
inference of homology between sequences whose relationship is unknown, through the evaluation
of gamma distribution significance between sequences.

Background
Sequence alignment is a central problem in computational molecular biology. Every branch of molecular biology- from database search, phylogeny reconstruction to
protein structure prediction- takes sequence alignments as
its foundation. The functional and/or structural properties
of a new sequence could be predicted from its degree of
similarity with some clearly defined and known
sequences. If the similarity between two sequences is statistically significant and does not simply stem from

sequence repeats of low complexity, then the two
sequences are likely to be homologous and thus may have
similar functions and/or structures.
To understand whether an observed sequence similarity
implies indeed a functional or evolutionary link, or is just
a chance event is the central problem for the evaluation of
the statistical significance of sequence alignment scores.
The basic question to be answered is: what is the probability that a similarity score as great as that actually observed

in a comparison between real sequences could have arisen
by chance, when sampling from suitably-defined populations of random unrelated sequences? This question is
generally addressed by analyzing the distribution of optimal alignment scores from random or real but unrelated
sequences [1], which is the approach applied in this
research.
Accurate statistical estimate for similarity searches for
local alignments has been studied comprehensively [1-4],
and the Gumbel distribution is used to estimate the statistical significance for local alignments [5]. However, we
still lack a complete theoretical solution to the optimal
global alignment between sequences, due to the fact that
global alignment scores grow proportionally to the length
of the sequences and small changes in the scoring system
can produce a different alignment [6].
Abagyan and Batalov suggested that global alignment
scores between unrelated protein sequences followed the
Gumbel distribution [7]. However, since the scoring system that they used favoured local alignments, these alignments they produced may not be global but local.
Dayhoff et al (1978) and Dayhoff et al(1983) evaluated
global alignment scores for randomized sequences (maintaining the amino acid composition and sequence length
of the real sequences) using their log-odds scoring matrix
at PAM250 and a constant gap penalty. The distribution of
the resulting scores matched a normal distribution [8,9].
Webber and Barton used sequences belonging to different
folds of the SCOP database whose percent identity to each
other is less than 40 to analyze the distribution of global
alignment z-scores between sequences [10]. They found
that the gamma distribution describes the distribution of
z-scores better than either the normal or Gumbel
distribution.
The determination of homolog is also affected by the reference datasets used for statistical estimation. Lipman et al
analyzed the distribution of scores among 100 vertebrate
nucleic acid sequences and compared these scores with
randomized sequences prepared in different ways [11].
When the randomized sequences were prepared by shuffling the sequence to conserve base composition, the
standard deviation was approximately one-third less than
the distribution of scores of the natural sequences, thus
leading to an overestimate of the significance if such randomized sequences were used for a significant test. When
sequences were locally shuffled for randomization, the
standard deviation was similar to that of the natural
sequences.
In this research, we chose 6 different ways to generate random and real but unrelated protein sequences as reference
datasets for significance estimation. Four scoring matrices

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/257

were applied for global alignments. The PAM120 and
PAM250 matrices were selected because they imply different evolutionary time [8], and the BLOSUM50 and
BLOSUM62 matrices were selected for their sound performance in database search [12,13]. Most alignments
were carried out with the affine gap penalty (see Methods)
as it penalizes less for additional gaps, which is more reasonable. The resulting alignment scores were then fitted
with three distributions to obtain the statistical characteristic of the global alignment scores.

Results
Derivation of distributions with different sequence sets
We have generated random and real but unrelated
sequences in six different ways as reference datasets. The
datasets are abbreviated as LAC, LCA, GS, LS, SMP and
RUS sequences respectively. The definition of the abbreviations can be found in the List of Abbreviations Used
below.

In general the three-parameter gamma distribution performs the best in the goodness of fit test with the distribution of global alignment scores. When the shape
parameter of the gamma distribution is sufficiently large,
the gamma distribution closely approximates a normal
distribution. Thus the normal distribution agrees with the
data as well. The Gumbel distribution deviates from the
alignment score distribution over the majority of the score
frequencies, however its performance gets a little better for
the LS sequence set than for the other sequence sets.
The distributions of global alignment scores of the LAC,
LCA and GS sequence sets are similar (Figure 1). The
three-parameter gamma distribution defines the empirical
distributions extremely well. The fitting quality of the normal distribution is better than that of the Gumbel distribution, but both of them diverged from the majority of
the global alignment frequencies.
For the LS sequence sets the majority of the empirical
score frequencies disagree with the normal or Gumbel distributions, whereas the three-parameter gamma distribution describes the alignment data extremely well (Figure
2). It also can be seen that the performance of the Gumbel
distribution is better with this sequence set than with the
others.
The distribution of alignment scores of the SMP sequence
set is quite different. The empirical score distribution of
sequences generated with the PAM120 mutation probability matrix and aligned with the PAM120 log-odds scoring matrix is different from those generated with the
PAM250 matrix. Both the gamma and normal distributions fit the score frequencies of the former well (Figure

3), whereas for the latter, the normal distribution disagrees with the majority of the score curve.

the same time the performance of the normal distribution
for curve fitting improves slowly (Table 2 and Table 3).

Most of the score distributions of the RUS sequence set
agree well with the gamma distribution, no matter what
the sequence length is. Although there are occasions when
no distribution agrees perfectly well with the score distribution, the three-parameter gamma distribution is still
the closest to the empirical distribution (Figure 4).

The difference of window size for local shuffling
The impact of the window size of local shuffling approach
on the gamma distribution was also studied (Table 4).
The result shows that when the window size increases, the
shape parameter of the fitted gamma distribution
decreases and the fitting performance of the normal distribution gets worse.

In database search, it is always the sequences, with higher
scores (i.e., tail of the distribution), are of interest. So the
score frequencies were also plotted against the natural logarithm of scores at the tail of the distribution (Figure 5). It
shows clearly that the gamma distribution outperforms
both the normal and Gumbel distributions even at the
tails of those distributions.
The effect of sequence length on the theoretical
distribution
We chose the LAC sequence set to analyze the impact of
the sequence length on the gamma distribution because
the amino acid composition of the LAC sequence set is the
same. The result shows that the shape parameter of the fitted gamma distribution increases and scale parameter
decreases gradually as the sequence length increases, at

The impact of scoring scheme
The effects of the four scoring matrices are minor on the
distribution of global alignment scores. The only exception is the empirical distribution of the SMP sequence set
aligned with the PAM120 log-odds scoring matrix, in
which the normal distribution performs as well as the
gamma distribution.

Discussion
Dayhoff et al (1978) and Dayhoff et al (1983) evaluated
global alignment scores for randomized sequences generated as our LCA sequence set using the PAM250 log-odds
scoring matrix and a constant gap penalty [8,9]. The distribution of the resulting scores matched a normal distribution. We tried both constant and affine gap penalty for

the LCA sequence set and found that the distribution of
optimal scores of the LCA sequence set agrees better with
the gamma distribution than with the normal
distribution.
Webber and Barton took sequences of different folds with
less than 40 percent identity from the SCOP database for
global alignments and fitted the z-scores to peak
distributions [10]. They found that the gamma distribution describes the alignment scores between different
folds better than either the normal or Gumbel distribution. The problem is that the derivation of z-scores
requires additional alignments to be calculated, and the zscore carries with it an implicit and possible incorrect
assignment of significance by the normal distribution.
The score distribution of the SMP sequence set simulated
from the evolution of the ancestor sequence at PAM120 is
an exception. The fitted shape parameter of the gamma
distribution is very large, and the normal distribution fits
with the data equally well. This is because sequences generated with the PAM120 mutation probability matrix are
around 40 percent similar with each other, so they can

hardly be viewed as random sequences for distributional
statistical analysis.
This study specifies three-parameter gamma distribution
as the theoretical distribution of global alignment scores
of random protein sequences. It could be used for the
inference of homology between sequences whose relationship is unknown through significance evaluation.
One issue worth exploring further is to formulate a function taking sequence length, scoring scheme and amino
acid composition into account so that rapid statistics conclusion is reached.

Conclusion
The global alignment optimal scores have been regarded
as normal [7] or Gumbel distributed [8]. We have shown
here that the normal distribution holds only for
sequences simulated with the PAM120 matrix, while the
Gumbel distribution disagrees with the optimal alignment score frequencies for all sequence sets in this
research. The study shows that the three-parameter
gamma distribution describes the random sequence alignment scores better than the normal or Gumbel distribu-

Methods
Dataset
The SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) database
[14] provides a detailed and comprehensive description
of the structural and evolutionary relationships between
all proteins whose structure is known [15]. The classification is on hierarchical levels that embody the evolutionary
and structural relationships. The hierarchy of the database
from top to bottom is fold, superfamily and family. Proteins that share clear evolutionarily relationship are clustered in families, those that have low sequence identities
but whose structural and functional features suggest that a
common evolutionary origin is probable are placed
together in superfamilies. Proteins are defined as having a
common fold if they have the same major secondary
structures in the same arrangement and with the same

topological connections. The SCOP 1.65 (released on
December 2003) was used in this study. It contains
40,452 domains organized in 2,327 families, 1,294 superfamilies and 800 folds. These domains correspond to
20,619 entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [16].
The amino acid compositions of all the sequences in the
SCOP 1.65 were calculated as shown in Table 1. The
amino acid composition in Table 1 was taken as the
average amino acid composition of proteins for random
sequence generation.
10 pairs of sequences with different sequence lengths50aa, 100aa, 200aa, 300aa, 400aa, 500aa, 600aa, 700aa,
800aa and 1200aa-were randomly chosen from the SCOP
database to be managed with different approaches
described below. The SCOP identifies of the 10 pairs of
sequences are: d1aqt_1 a.2.10.1, d1gjja1 a.140.1.1,
d1foka3 a.4.5.12, d1mk7d1 a.11.2.1, d1hx9a1 a.102.4.1,

are less than 10 percent identity to each other, another
with sequences whose E-value with one another is greater
than 10, and the third with 800 sequences each represents
one fold in the SCOP 1.65.

Sequence randomization approaches
1) Maintaining the sequence length and average amino acid
composition (LAC)
Sequences were generated as strings of independent characters where the amino acid in any position is proportional to its composition in proteins (Table 1) with a
given sequence length.

The sequence lengths in the three subsets vary from 23aa
to 1504aa. As global alignment between sequences of
highly different sequence lengths is not appropriate, we
extracted sequences of similar length in each filtered
sequence set further. 300 sequences of 50aa, 100aa,
200aa, 300aa and 400aa were extracted respectively from
each of the filtered sequence set, and the tails of longer
ones were cut off.

2) Maintaining the sequence length and the amino acid composition
of the authentic sequences (LCA)
The amino acid compositions of the two authentic
sequences were calculated and random sequences were
generated retaining both the distributions of the amino
acid composition and the sequence length of the original
sequences.
3) Global shuffling or permutation (GS)
Each residue in the authentic sequences is randomly repositioned anywhere in the sequence, so that both the
amino acid composition and sequence length were
maintained.
4) Local shuffling or permutation (LS)
The sequence is broken into n/w windows (n denotes the
length of the sequence and w is the length of the window,
typically 5â20 residues) and the residues in each window
are randomly shuffled. Both the sequence length and the
local amino acid composition are retained with this
approach. We selected four window sizes-5aa, 10aa, 15aa
and 20aa- to compare their effects on the statistical
distributions.
5) Simulation of the mutational process (SMP)
To get sequences of a known evolutionary distance, we
simulated the mutational process of the ancestor
sequence. First, the PAM1 mutation probability matrix is
multiplied by itself 120 or 250 times to get the PAM120
and PAM250 mutation probability matrices. The matrices
provide information about each amino acid stayed
unchanged or substituted by any other one at the given
evolutionary distance. Then the fate of each residue in the
new sequence was determined according to the PAM120
or PAM250 mutation probability matrix through computer simulation [8].
6) Real but unrelated sequences (RUS)
The SCOP database also provides filtered sub datasets
selected with different criteria, such as sequence identity
percentage, E-value, or different hierarchy representatives
[17]. We chose three subsets, one in which the sequences

Alignment algorithm
We wrote a C program for all the global alignments in this
study. The program implements the Needleman-Wunsch
dynamic programming algorithm [18] and penalized on
end gaps.

For the LAC and SMP sequence sets, two sequences were
generated at a time and global alignments were carried out
between them, this process was repeated 10,000 times.
For the LCA, GS and LS sequence sets the first sequence
was aligned with 5,000 randomizations of the second,
then vice versa. Global alignments were carried out
between every pair of the 300 sequences for the RUS
sequence set.
Scoring scheme
As the evolutionary distance of the SMP sequence set is
known, the scoring matrix matching the giving
evolutionary time was chosen for the alignments. For
other sequence sets two matrices, the PAM120 and
PAM250 from the PAM series and another two, the
BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62 from the BLOSUM series
were employed. The respective gap open/extension penalty combination for the PAM120 is -16/-4, PAM250 -11/
-1, BLOSUM50 -10/-2, BLOSUM62 -7/-1, as recommended by Vingron and Waterman, Mount, and Pearson
[6,19,20]. Gap extension penalty is added for the first gap.

We also used constant gap penalty of -10 for the PAM250
matrix for the LAC and LCA sequence sets.
Curve fitting
Optimal global alignment scores of the different sequence
sets aligned with different scoring scheme were fitted with
the Gumbel, normal and three-parameter gamma distributions respectively. Methods of moments were used for
the estimation of the parameters of the optional
distributions.

The probability density function of the gamma distribution is given as
