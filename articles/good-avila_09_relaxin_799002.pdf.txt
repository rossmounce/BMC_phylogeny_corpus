Abstract
Background: In recent years, the relaxin family of signaling molecules has been shown to play diverse roles in
mammalian physiology, but little is known about its diversity or physiology in teleosts, an infraclass of the bony
fishes comprising ~ 50% of all extant vertebrates. In this paper, 32 relaxin family sequences were obtained by
searching genomic and cDNA databases from eight teleost species; phylogenetic, molecular evolutionary, and
syntenic data analyses were conducted to understand the relationship and differential patterns of evolution of
relaxin family genes in teleosts compared with mammals. Additionally, real-time quantitative PCR was used to
confirm and assess the tissues of expression of five relaxin family genes in Danio rerio and in situ hybridization used
to assess the site-specific expression of the insulin 3-like gene in D. rerio testis.
Results: Up to six relaxin family genes were identified in each teleost species. Comparative syntenic mapping
revealed that fish possess two paralogous copies of human RLN3, which we call rln3a and rln3b, an orthologue of
human RLN2, rln, two paralogous copies of human INSL5, insl5a and insl5b, and an orthologue of human INSL3,
insl3. Molecular evolutionary analyses indicated that: rln3a, rln3b and rln are under strong evolutionary constraint,
that insl3 has been subject to moderate rates of sequence evolution with two amino acids in insl3/INSL3 showing
evidence of positively selection, and that insl5b exhibits a higher rate of sequence evolution than its paralogue
insl5a suggesting that it may have been neo-functionalized after the teleost whole genome duplication.
Quantitative PCR analyses in D. rerio indicated that rln3a and rln3b are expressed in brain, insl3 is highly expressed
in gonads, and that there was low expression of both insl5 genes in adult zebrafish. Finally, in situ hybridization of
insl3 in D. rerio testes showed highly specific hybridization to interstitial Leydig cells.
Conclusions: Contrary to previous studies, we find convincing evidence that teleosts contain orthologues of
four relaxin family peptides. Overall our analyses suggest that in teleosts: 1) rln3 exhibits a similar evolution and
expression pattern to mammalian RLN3, 2) insl3 has been subject to positive selection like its mammalian
counterpart and shows similar tissue-specific expression in Leydig cells, 3) insl5 genes are highly represented and
have a relatively high rate of sequence evolution in teleost genomes, but they exhibited only low levels of
expression in adult zebrafish, 4) rln is evolving under very different selective constraints from mammalian RLN.
The results presented here should facilitate the development of hypothesis-driven experimental work on the
specific roles of relaxin family genes in teleosts.

Background
The relaxin family of peptides belongs to the insulin
superfamily and includes a group of signaling molecules
that share similar gene and protein secondary structures.
The genes have two exons that code for a prepropeptide
consisting of a signal peptide, followed by B-, C-, and Achains. Prohormone processing and activation occurs by
removal of the C-chain by prohormone convertases that
cleave at dibasic junctions [1]. In the mature peptide, six
cysteine residues form three disulfide bonds that give this
superfamily its distinctive secondary protein structure. In
most mammals, the relaxin family consists of two relaxin
peptides, RLN and RLN3, which share the receptor binding domain RXXXRXXI/V and four insulin-like peptides,
INSL3, INSL4, INSL5, and INSL6, which have a less conserved motif [2]. Additionally, relaxin family peptides
activate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) while other
members of the insulin superfamily signal via tyrosine
kinases [3].
The hormone RLN was the first member of the family to
be studied in detail [2]. Originally characterized as a
reproductive hormone [4], RLN is now implicated in
diverse physiological processes, via its role in stimulating
the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
which degrade extracellular matrix proteins and cause tissue remodeling [2]. By this action, the hormone is
involved in parturition where it softens the connective tissues of the reproductive tract and prepares the mammary
glands for lactation [2]; RLN has also been found to be
involved in diverse processes involving tissue remodeling
such as wound healing, angiogenesis and tumor formation [5,6]. In mammals, the RLN gene tandemly duplicated to give rise to two additional members of the family,
INSL4 and INSL6, both of which are poorly understood,
but which are both predominantly expressed in placenta
and testis [7]. A more recent duplication of the RLN gene,
specific to humans and anthropoid apes, resulted in primates having two copies of RLN, called RLN1 and RLN2,
with RLN2 being functionally equivalent to the RLN in
other mammals [2]. More recently, other members of the
relaxin family have been identified: RLN3 was found to be
expressed in the brain and testis of rodents and to exhibit
high sequence conservation across mammalian species
[8,9]. This led to predictions that RLN3 may function as a
neuropeptide [8], which has received some empirical support because the peptide has been shown to be involved
in the modulation of feeding activities, body weight regulation and in stress coordination, learning and memory
[10,11].
Another member of the relaxin family, insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), attracted the attention of andrologists after
it was discovered to play a crucial role in testicular descent
in young males of human and mice [12]. There is also evi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/293

dence that INSL3 is a survival factor for male and female
germ cells in mammals [12,13]: it is expressed in significant amounts in testicular Leydig cells, while in females
the distribution of INSL3 producing sites is less specifically localized, detected mainly in ovarian follicular theca
cells [12]. However, the receptor for INSL3, RXFP2, has
been identified in a broad range of tissues: brain, kidney,
muscle, testis, thyroid, uterus, lymphocytes and bone
marrow [12]. One of the least understood members of the
relaxin family is INSL5, which was originally identified
from analyses of expressed sequence tags in the human
genome [14], and its expression has been detected in fetal
brain, pituitary and colon as well as in the cortex of the
thymus gland [15,16]. The receptor for INSL5, RXFP4, is
broadly distributed in the human body, but the colon
appears to be the most prominent site of RXFP4 mRNA
expression. This is consistent with current hypotheses that
it is involved in gut contractility and neuroendocrine signaling [15,16]. Thus, collectively, the relaxin family is
revealing itself to be a group of peptides primarily
involved in reproductive processes in mammals, and at
the same time plays a broader role in other aspects of
mammalian physiology.
Investigation on relaxin family peptides outside mammals has been limited. Relaxin-like peptides have been
found in the testis, ovary, and/or alkaline glands of three
species of sharks [17-21] and in bird testis [22]. However,
there are only a few physiological studies on the expression of relaxin in teleosts [23,24], which are an infraclass
of the bony fishes, and comprise 96% of the 26,000 rayfinned fish species and ~ half of all vertebrates on the
planet [25].
Molecular estimates indicate that the common ancestor of
teleosts and tetrapods existed ~ 450 million years ago
(mya) [25,26]. A whole genome duplication (WGD), that
occurred early in teleost evolution, ~ 350 mya, is hypothesized to have contributed to the rapid divergence of the
group in part because of the opportunities that WGD's
offer for acquisition of new gene functions [27,28]. After
gene duplication, newly derived paralogous sequences are
assumed to share similar functions to the ancestral gene.
However, over time, the genes may be non-, sub- or neofunctionalized [29,30]. Because the teleost WGD event is
ancient, examination of the proportional frequency and
consequences of non-, sub- and neo-functionalization in
teleosts have provided important insights into the role of
gene duplication in vertebrates [31-35].
There have been two previous bioinformatics studies on
the relaxin family [9,36]. Neither study focused on the
molecular evolution nor expression of the family in teleosts, but they both included sequences of relaxin family
genes from teleosts. Additionally, Park et al. [36] per-

formed a syntenic data analysis of relaxin family genes in
vertebrates and found that the common ancestor of teleosts and tetrapods harboured three independent relaxin
family loci (RFL): RFLA - INSL5-like genes, RFLB - RLNlike genes and RFLC - RLN3-like genes. In this paper we
expand upon these previous studies by including 32
relaxin family gene sequences from eight teleost species
and by focusing our analyses on understanding the specific forces influencing orthologous and paralogous gene
copy evolution of relaxins in teleosts. To this end, detailed
analyses of teleost relaxin family genes were performed to
assess the number of orthologous and paralogous
sequences of relaxins in teleosts, their syntenic relationship to human relaxin family genes, the strength of purifying versus diversifying selection, the role of positive
selection at the codon level, the relative expression of
relaxin family genes in adult Danio rerio using real-time
quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the site-specific expression
of insl3 in D. rerio testis using in situ hybridization.

Results
Teleosts possess relaxin family sequences which are
orthologous to four human relaxin genes
The syntenic data analysis showed that the six copies of
relaxin family sequences analysed in the five teleost species are linked to four loci: two loci are syntenic to human
INSL5, termed RFLA by Park et al. (2008), and harbour
teleost insl5a and insl5b (Figure 1A); a locus syntenic to the
human relaxin cluster (RLN2/RLN1/INSL4/INSL6) termed
RFLB (Figure 1B), contains teleost rln; the locus syntenic
to human RLN3, RFLCI, contains rln3a and rln3b (Figure
2A), and the locus syntenic to human INSL3, RFLCII, contains teleost insl3 (Figure 2B). RLN3 and INSL3 are ~ 3.8
Mb apart on human chromosome XIX, but they are not
linked in teleosts; the genes linked to rln versus insl3 in teleosts split near the equivalent map position at 16 or 17
Mb of human chromosome XIX. A strong support was
shown for the orthology between human and teleost
relaxin family genes (Figure 1 and 2, Additional File 1:
Table S1), although the linkage map for the human
relaxin cluster containing RLN1, RLN2, INSL4 and INSL6
was less dense than that for the other chromosomes
(Additional File 1: Table S1). Thus, of the six relaxin family genes in teleosts, four were present in the common
ancestor of humans and teleosts and two arose as a result
of the WGD in teleosts (Figure 3).
Phylogenetic analysis reveals that all teleost relaxin family
genes except relaxin group with their mammalian
orthologues
Using the nucleotide alignment (Figure 4), hierarchical
likelihood ratio tests indicated that the Tamura 3-parameter + Î (with a = 1.24) model was the most appropriate
model of DNA sequence evolution. This model was used
for the minimum evolution tree based on the first two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/293

codon positions (Figure 5). For the Bayesian trees, the
GTR + Î model of sequence evolution was employed, and
partitioning and unlinking the three codon positions
revealed that the rate of change was approximately four
times higher at the third compared to first and second
codon positions (0.51, 0.40 and 2.00 respectively) and
that the gamma parameter was 0.98 for the first two positions, but 5.06 for the third position. Hierarchical likelihood tests of the amino acid models included in ProTest
v. 1.0.6 and Bayesian methods both strongly supported
the WAG + Î (a = 0.60) model of amino acid sequence
evolution which was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic
relationship among amino acid sequences (Additional
File 2: Figure S1). Although the topology of the Bayesian
partitioned DNA sequence tree was similar to the Bayesian tree based on amino acid data, the saturation of the
third base position lowered confidence in the Bayesian
Posterior Probabilities (BPP) and led to some problems of
long-branch attraction: the two trees shown are the distance (minimum evolution) tree based on DNA (Figure 4)
and the Bayesian topology based on the amino acid
sequences using the WAG + Î model of sequence evolution (Additional File 2: Figure S1).
The phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the DNA
sequence data support the presence of four relaxin family
groups in teleosts with reasonably high bootstrap support
1) rln3a and rln3b (81%) 2) rln (91%) 3) insl5a and insl5b
(86%) and 4) insl3 (50%). All teleost relaxin family genes
cluster with their mammalian orthologues as identified
through the syntenic data analyses except teleost rln,
which is sister clade to rln3 with high bootstrap support
(91%) and exhibits, overall, a closer resemblance to these
sequences (Figure 4) than to its true orthologue, mammalian RLN. The three frog sequences cluster with their
orthologue basal to the teleost clade: in particular the X.
tropicalisrln sequence shows greater similarity to teleost rln
than to mammalian RLN. The BPP support for the Bayesian tree reconstructed with amino acid sequences gave
similar results and statistical support (Additional File 2:
Figure S1) to that based on DNA sequence data, with the
main exception that teleost insl3 sequences have higher
BPP support (74%) than based on the DNA sequence but
they do not group with mammalian INSL3.
Teleost relaxin family genes are subject to different levels
of purifying selection
The two-cluster test was performed on the topology
shown in Figure 5 and identified the following groups as
having differential rates of evolution 1) teleost rln3a and
rln3b exhibited accelerated evolution compared to mammalian RLN3, 2) teleost insl5 and insl3 independently
exhibited accelerated evolution compared to teleost rln3a,
rln3b, rln and mammalian RLN3 and 3) teleost insl5b
showed accelerated evolution relative to insl5a.

Synteny 1 (see previous page)
Synteny maps. Synteny maps comparing the orthologues of the relaxin family loci (RFL) and the genes flanking them in
humans (H. sapiens) and five species of teleosts (G. aculeatus, D. rerio, T. nigroviridis, T. rubripes and O. latipes). 1A) RFLA locus
contains the INSL5 gene in humans and its teleostean paralogues, insl5a/insl5b; 1B) RFLB locus in humans hosts four relaxin family genes, namely INSL6, INSL4, RLN2 and RLN1; in teleosts this locus is represented by rln gene found as a single copy in all of
the analyzed teleost genomes except for D. rerio, in which it is absent; 2A) RFLCI locus is represented by RLN3 in humans, and
its paralogues, rln3a/rln3b in teleosts; 2B) RFLCII locus hosts INSL3 in humans, while 3 of the 5 studied teleosts contain single
copy orthologues, insl3. The chromosome number (in Roman numerals) and map position of each gene in humans are given on
the right. On the left, the genes orthologous to the human RFL are shown by orange hexagons in the central shaded section,
and RFL paralogue that arose via the whole genome duplication shown as a white hexagon. Genes flanking the RFL that are syntenic in humans and teleosts are indicated by orange rectangles; the map position of each gene in teleosts is listed in Additional
File 1: Table S3. Tandem duplicate copies of genes appear as two rectangles. Genes shown as white rectangles are genes identified on the same chromosome but in more distant locations (Additional File 1: Table S1). The genes PDE4B/SLC35D1/SERBP1/
RPE65 (RFLA); JAK2 (RFLB); TNPO2/RFX1/ASF1B/SLC27A1/GLT25D1 (RFLCI); and MED26/NR2F6/UNC13A/KCNN1/MAST3 (RFLCII)
were all retained in duplicate in 3 or more species (Additional File 1: Table S1). One gene, NXNL1 RFLCI) was retained tandemly duplicated in 3 species. Three of the 4 RFL linkage groups contained a copy of JAK, and 2 of the 4 contained copies of
PDE, SMARCA, RFX and MAST genes.

The average value of dn/ds within each relaxin family gene
or within the B- and A-chains ranged from 0.05 (rln3b, Achain) to 0.48 (insl5b, A-chain) in teleosts and from 0.04
(RLN3, B-chain) to 0.78 (INSL6, B-chain) in mammals
(Table 1). Values were generally lower in the B- compared
to the A-chain. No gene was found to exhibit, overall, evidence of positive selection in which dn/ds > 1. In general,
teleost rln3a, rln3b and rln had few non-synonymous
changes in both the B- and A-chains; their dn/ds ratios
were less than 0.10 indicating that they are under strong
purifying selection comparable to mammalian RLN3
which had a dn/ds ratio of 0.08. Teleost insl5a exhibited
similar and moderate levels of purifying selection to
mammalian INSL5, with the dn/ds ratio in teleosts (0.25)
being similar to that in mammals (0.23). On the other
hand, teleost insl5b exhibited weaker purifying selection
with an overall dn/ds ratio of 0.40, and having dn/ds ratios
more than twice that for insl5a in the B- (0.34) and Achains (0.48). Teleost insl3 exhibited similar (0.37) overall sequence divergence to insl5b. Although insl5b and
insl3 are the teleost genes under the weakest evolutionary
constraint (a result also supported by the molecular clock
analyses), they are under stronger purifying selection than
mammalian RLN and INSL6, which have dn/ds ratios of
0.64 and 0.46 respectively, with the B-chain of mammalian INSL6 exhibiting the highest rate of dn/ds at 0.78.
The branch-site model A analyses indicated that only insl3
exhibited evidence of codon-specific selection within teleosts or mammals. The null model was rejected when both
teleosts and mammals were used as the foreground
branch and two amino acids were identified as being subject to positive selection with Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB)
values of > 0.95. Using teleosts as the foreground lineage,
site 27 in the B/C cut site, which is valine/leucine in teleosts but tryptophan in mammals, shows evidence of pos-

itive selection. Setting mammalian INSL3 to the
foreground branch, identified site 21 in the B-chain,
which is fixed as valine in mammals but to serine in teleosts, is also under positive selection (Table 2). An additional 10 sites were identified by the branch-site model as
being potential sites of selection but none had BEB values
>0.95. However, it is interesting to note that of the 12 sites
identified by the model, 3 are in the B/C cut site (Table 2,
Figure 4).
Quantitative PCR analysis showed evidence of significant
expression of rln3a/rln3b and insl3 genes in the gonads and
brain of zebrafish
DNA sequencing of the products amplified using qPCR
confirmed the identity of all D. rerio amplification products (not shown). The results of the expression analyses of
relaxin family genes in D. rerio indicated that rln3a and
rln3b are predominantly expressed in the brain, although
rln3b was also expressed in the gonads, while rln3a was
not (Figure 6). Additionally, the data strongly support a
role for insl3 in both ovary and testes with additional
expression of insl3 in the brain and gill: the expression of
insl3 was not significantly lower than that of the housekeeping gene, b2m, in ovary, and was only marginally
lower than b2m in testis (data not shown). Lastly, the
results showed little evidence of expression of either insl5a
or insl5b in any tissue: insl5a was expressed in most tissues
(except heart) at low levels while insl5b showed uniformly
low, essentially negligible, expression (Figure 6).
In situ hybridization identified expression of insl3 in
zebrafish testis in Leydig cells
A strong and specific signal of insl3 mRNA was observed
in the interstitial area in the Leydig cells (Figure 7A).
Higher magnification showed that the cytoplasm of these
cells was strongly labeled while the nucleus remained

RPE65 (RFLA); JAK2 (RFLB); TNPO2/RFX1/ASF1B/SLC27A1/GLT25D1 (RFLCI); and MED26/NR2F6/UNC13A/KCNN1/MAST3 (RFLCII)
were all retained in duplicate in 3 or more species (Additional File 1: Table S1). One gene, NXNL1 RFLCI) was retained tandemly duplicated in 3 species. Three of the 4 RFL linkage groups contained a copy of JAK, and 2 of the 4 contained copies of
PDE, SMARCA, RFX and MAST genes.

unstained (Figure 7B). Positive cells formed clusters that
were often arranged around blood vessels. There were no
apparent (rostro-caudal or dorso-ventral) gradients in
staining intensity in an adult testis, and all Leydig cells
appeared to be labeled strongly. However, although not
properly quantified yet, it is possible that the size of the
Leydig cell clusters is larger in the periphery than in central areas of the testis. The intratubular area, containing
Sertoli and germ cells at different stages of spermatogenesis, remained unlabeled. Taken together, these findings
suggest that insl3 is a reliable Leydig cell marker in
zebrafish testis tissue. No signal was observed with the
sense cRNA insl3 probe (data not shown), indicating the
specificity of the antisense probe generated against the
sequence of zebrafish insl3 mRNA.

Discussion
Reconstructing the evolutionary relationship among
relaxin family genes in teleosts and tetrapods has highlighted the difficulties of determining orthologous and
paralogous relationships in ancient gene families using
phylogenetic data alone, in particular for small, relatively
quickly evolving genes [25,26]. Previous phylogenetic
studies on relaxin family genes [9,36] have also found a
poor resolution of relaxin family genes, particularly in teleosts: by including more teleost species we find that only
teleost rln failed to group with its mammalian orthologue
and this is evidently due to very different selective pressures operating on the gene in the two groups (see discussion below). Using syntenic mapping data, we identify
that the six relaxin family genes in teleosts are orthologous
to four mammalian genes: RLN3, RLN, INSL5 and INSL3
with two of the genes, INSL5 and RLN3, containing paralogous copies in teleosts, insl5a/insl5b and rln3a/rln3b (Figure 3). These results are similar to those presented by Park
et al. [36] with the exception that we find evidence that tel-

eosts possess an orthologue to INSL3, while they argue
that INSL3 arose via duplication from RLN3 after the
divergence of teleosts from tetrapods. We therefore propose that the relaxin family genes that were first identified
as RLX3a-3f by Wilkinson et al. [9] be named based on
their orthology to the mammalian counterparts: rln3a/
rln3b, rln, insl5a/insl5b, and insl3 respectively (Table 3).
We encourage the adoption of this nomenclature, since
there is currently considerable confusion regarding the
identity of relaxin family peptides in teleosts on publically
available databases.
In teleosts, these relaxin family genes are subject to strong
or moderate purifying selection: rln3a, rln3b and rln are all
similar in sequence and highly conserved, insl5a exhibits
a slightly faster rate of molecular evolution, and insl3 and
insl5b exhibit the highest levels of molecular evolution in
teleosts, the latter having a significantly faster rate of evolution than its paralogue insl5a. Using the branch-site
model A test, we find evidence that one codon in teleost
insl3 and another in mammalian INSL3 have been subject
to positive selection. Lastly, we find evidence that five of
the six relaxin family genes present in the model organism
Danio rerio are expressed in one or multiple tissues, especially brain and gonads and that insl3 is specifically
expressed in interstitial Leydig cells in zebrafish testis. The
significance of these results will be discussed first within
the context of the comparative analysis of orthologous
relaxin family genes in teleosts and mammals and then
with respect to the evolution and expression of paralogous relaxin family genes in teleosts.

Origins of relaxin family genes in teleosts (bottom) and humans (top) determined by synteny map analyses
Origins of relaxin family genes in teleosts (bottom) and humans (top) determined by synteny map analyses.
The ancestral Relaxin Family Loci (AncRFL) that are hypothesized to have been present in the common ancestor of teleosts and
humans (tetrapods) are shown in the middle. We infer that AncRFLC duplicated giving rise to RFLCI (rln3) and RFLCII (insl3)
prior to the divergence of teleosts and tetrapods. Names for the RFL proposed by Park et al. (2008) are given in brackets and
underlined, those not used by Park et al., but inferred from this analyses are given in brackets with a dotted underline. The
whole genome duplication (WGD) event resulted in two copies (paralogues) of each of the relaxin family genes in teleosts.
AncRFLA gave rise to INSL5 and two paralogues in teleosts, insl5a and insl5b. AncRFLB was the predecessor of three human
genes INSL4, INSL6 and RLN2, while the latter additionally underwent a recent duplication in primates producing RLN1. In teleosts, the RFLB gene, rln, is assumed to be orthologous to human RLN2. AncRFLC is hypothesized to have diverged into two loci:
RFLCI harbouring RLN3 and the teleostean paralogues, rln3a and rln3b, and RFLCII, harbouring INSL3 and insl3. Duplicated copies
of insl3 and rln in teleosts are believed to have been lost due to non-functionalization.
Relaxin family genes: teleosts versus mammals
Teleost rln is more similar in sequence to rln3 than to its mammalian
orthologue RLN
Teleost rln was found in 4 of the 5 species for which the
whole genome was available but it is, surprisingly, absent
from the D. rerio genome. The close identity of teleost rln
to rln3, and yet its striking difference from mammalian
RLN, suggest that the gene has been subject to different
evolutionary pressures in the two groups. Several processes could potentially have caused this such as: 1) teleost
rln has retained the ancestral function of the gene while
mammalian RLN has diversified in function or 2) teleost
rln has undergone convergent evolution with rln3. Certainly there is support for the hypothesis that mammalian
RLN has diversified in function: it exhibits the highest rate
of molecular evolution of any of the relaxin family genes
except INSL6 and it has duplicated giving rise to four fast-

evolving paralogues in humans and anthropoid apes RLN1, RLN2, INSL4 and INSL6 (Figure 1B), all of which
are produced by human reproductive tissues [37,38].
Thus, the clustering of mammalian RLN with its linked
paralogues, rather than with teleost rln, arises in part
because the clade has a higher rate of evolution and more
recent common ancestry than the clade harbouring teleost
rln. This hypothesis is also supported by the phylogenetic
clustering of frog and teleost rln sequences (Figure 5).
However, the identity of the B-domain of teleost rln with
rln3 suggests that some factor such as shared receptor
binding domains may have selected for them to retain the
same sequence. Until the receptors of teleost relaxin family genes are known and the physiological role of teleost
rln understood, it will be difficult to assess this hypothesis.
Although the physiological role of relaxin in mammals is
primarily associated with the reconstruction of connective

For each gene, either teleosts or mammals were used as the foreground branch on which the alternate (alt) hypothesis of positive selection was
compared to the null model (Ï = 1, fixed). The proportion of sites subject to purifying (p0), nearly neutral (p1) and positive selection (p2) and the
estimate of Ï (Ï2) in the free model are all given as is the Likelihood (L) of the model. The codon positions (using D. rerio as the reference
sequence) of the sites estimated to be subject to positive selection are indicated where significant. The null and alternative models are significantly
different when 2 Î L > 3.841. *For rln3, the models were not statistically different.

The proposed names for the six teleost RFL are given along with the nomenclature used for the orthologous genes in humans, and the
nomenclature proposed by Park et al. (2008) and Wilkinson et al. (2005) in Takifugu rubripes and Danio rerio for teleost relaxin family genes. Park et
al. (2008) propose that teleosts do not have an insl3 orthologue. They suggest that insl3 adopted its role in mammals after the divergence of
Amphibia, and refer to the ancestral insl3 locus in amphibians as RFLCII.

tissue during reproduction [2], the gene is involved in several pathways not specific to reproduction, e.g. metalloproteinase activation, wound healing and reduction of
fibrosis in non-reproductive tissues, that may reflect the
ancestral role of the gene and its potential action in teleosts.
Teleost insl3 shows a similar spatial pattern of expression to
mammalian INSL3
Since the descent of testicles from the abdominal cavity is
solely specific to therian mammals, insl3 is postulated to
have adopted this specialized role prior to the emergence
of marsupials [36]. Park et al. [36] propose that the duplication of RFLCI, that gave rise to RFLCII harbouring
INSL3, occurred prior to the divergence of amphibians
and mammals but after the divergence of teleosts from
tetrapods. They base this conclusion on the putative
absence of an INSL3-like orthologue in fish. However, by

studying more fish species, we find convincing syntenic
evidence that the duplication of RFLCI and RFLCII
occurred prior to the divergence of fish and tetrapods (Figure 3). Indeed, our qPCR results show that insl3 was the
most abundantly expressed relaxin in D. rerio and that it
was highly expressed in both ovary and testis, exhibiting
only marginally lower expression levels than the housekeeping gene. The in situ hybridization results additionally showed that insl3 is expressed in the interstitial area of
D. rerio testis (i.e. in Leydig cells) but is completely absent
from the intratubular section (containing Sertoli and
germ cells). This pattern of Leydig cell-specific staining
has also been identified for Cyp17a1 [39] and for 3Î²HSD
[40], both Leydig cell proteins involved in zebrafish germ
cell sexual differentiation.

respectively, during early therian evolution allowed for
INSL3 to adopt its specific role in testicular descent in
mammals: they further show that the gene products of
RFLCI (rln3a and rln3b) activate both rxfp1 and rxfp2 in
teleosts. A role for codon-specific positive selection in the
evolution of the insl3 gene was also found in this study:
insl3 was the only relaxin family gene which exhibited evidence of lineage and site-specific selection in teleosts and
mammals. Two amino acids were found to show evidence

of positive selection at the 95% significance level when
teleosts or mammals were used as the foreground lineage,
although a total of twelve sites were included in the most
probable posterior model. Interestingly, three of these
twelve sites were in the B/C dibasic junction. Prohormone
convertases activate hormones by cleaving dibasic chain
junctions; our results suggest that different expression patterns between mammalian and teleost relaxin family
genes may be mirrored by these convertases [41,42].

Overall, our data support Park et al.'s [36] conclusion that
the co-evolution of INSL3-RXFP2 may have allowed
INSL3 to adopt its particular role in mammalian testicular
descent, but we also show that INSL3-like genes are
present in teleosts and that they are also involved in Leydig cell differentiation.
Teleost rln3 paralogues show similar gene sequence and expression
to mammalian RLN3
Examining the spatial and temporal expression of rln3
paralogues, Donizetti et al. [23] recently found evidence
for the expression of both genes in adult zebrafish brain.
Additionally, they found expression during larval stages
for rln3a in the nucleus incertus and for rln3b in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) matter, the latter being implicated
in vocal communication in fish. Our qPCR results in adult
zebrafish are consistent with theirs, and the putative role
of RLN3 as a neuropeptide involved in feeding, body
weight regulation, stress coordination, learning and memory [10,11]. Interestingly, while we find significant expression of rln3b in the ovary, Donizetti et al. [23] showed
evidence of expression of rln3b in the testis but not the
ovary of adult zebrafish. Even though the difference
between the expression of rln3b in the two sexes deserves
further attention, the hypothesis that rln3 performs a dual
function in teleosts is supported by the work of McGowan
et al. [43]. They found evidence for the involvement of
RLN3 in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in mice,
suggesting that it may be a signal linking nutritional status
and reproductive function. Collectively, these data suggest
that rln3 (RLN3) may play similar roles in teleosts and
mammals, which is further supported by its high degree of
sequence conservation between the two groups [[9], this
study].
Both teleost insl5 paralogues are well represented but, as in
mammals, their role(s) are unclear
Seven of the eight examined species of teleosts harboured
insl5a genes, and all the species for which the whole
genome had been sequenced, additionally contained the
paralogous sequence insl5b. Despite its presence in the
genome, the qPCR data in D. rerio were more ambivalent.
While some expression of insl5a was found in several tissues, particularly brain and gill, only very low expression
of insl5b was found in the examined adult zebrafish tissues.
Evolution and expression of paralogous genes, rln3 and insl5, in
teleosts
Our data show that rln3a/3b and insl5a/5b arose by duplication after the tetrapod-teleost divergence. It has been
proposed that duplicate gene copies may 1) accumulate
nonsense mutations in regulatory or gene elements and
become non-functionalized, 2) diverge in the tissue or
timing of expression compared to the ancestral copy and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/293

become sub-functionalized, or 3) acquire new functions
and be neo-functionalized [30]. Theory suggests that
duplicated genes are most likely to be lost or sub-functionalized [44], and genome wide scans indicate that
about 80%-85% of teleost genes were non-functionalized
after the WGD [29,45]. The relative rates of sub- versus
neo-functionalization are difficult to determine, in part
because sub-functionalization may lead to neo-functionalization over long evolutionary timescales [46]. Additionally, changes associated with sub-functionalization
often occur in promoter regions that regulate timing or
control of gene expression and studies that examine the
rate or pattern of molecular evolution in the protein coding region alone may not detect sub-functionalization
[44].
The data presented here suggest that the paralogous copies
of rln3 and insl5 may have been subjected to different
forces of "functionalization" post-duplication. The paralogues rln3a and rln3b, exhibit similar patterns of molecular evolution consistent with sub-functionalization of the
duplicated copy. Our qPCR data indicate that rln3b is
expressed in the brain and ovary while rln3a is expressed
only in the adult zebrafish brain. This result is consistent
with the findings of Donizetti et al. [23] although they
additionally find evidence of distinct differential expression of these two paralogues during zebrafish embryogenesis. Seemingly, the pattern observed in adult zebrafish for
rln3 paralogues differs somewhat from the classical definition of sub-functionalization because sub-functionalized
copies are expected to diverge in temporal or spatial
expression but collectively span the ancestral expression
patterns, although our results are consistent with other
data on the expression of paralogous genes [45,46]. On
the other hand, the duplicated copies of insl5 appear to be
subject to different selective pressures. The molecular
clock analyses revealed that insl5b has had an accelerated
rate of evolution compared to insl5a, and the average
value of dn/ds was more than twice as high in the B- and
A-chains of insl5b compared to insl5a, a pattern identified
for other duplicated teleost genes believed to have undergone neo-functionalization [45]. Support for the contention that insl5a, rather than insl5b, has retained the
ancestral function is further given by the syntenic data
analyses in which many of the genes linked to INSL5 in
humans are preferentially linked to insl5a (Figure 1A). The
low levels of expression for insl5a and even lower levels
for insl5b suggest that either 1) we have not identified the
main tissues of expression for these genes and/or 2) they
are expressed at developmental stages not included in this
preliminary analysis (adult male and female zebrafish): in
the future this will be explored using more detailed qPCR
studies.

Conclusions
We find that teleosts harbour orthologues of four mammalian relaxin family genes: RLN, RLN3, INSL3 and
INSL5. Two of the orthologues exist as paralogous duplicates in teleosts (rln3a/rln3b and insl5a/insl5b) probably as
a result of the WGD event that occurred early in the evolution of teleosts. By combining the bioinformatics and
expression analyses performed in this study we can draw
the following conclusions about each teleost relaxin gene:
1) both rln3 paralogues exhibit similar evolution and
expression to mammalian RLN3 and the paralogous copies appear to have been sub-functionalized, 2) teleost insl3
has evolved moderately quickly like its mammalian counterpart and shows similar tissue-specific expression in Leydig cells, has undergone site-specific codon selection in
both teleosts and mammals, and additionally exhibited
high expression in the ovary of teleosts, 3) insl5 genes are
well represented in teleosts, insl5a exhibits similar rates of
evolution to insl3, while insl5b shows accelerated evolution compared to insl5a and may have been neo-functionalized, 4) molecular evolutionary analyses indicate that
teleost rln is operating under very different selective constraints from mammalian RLN, and appears to mimic rln3
in its sequence evolution. Taken together, these results
underscore the diverse roles that relaxin family peptides
must play in teleosts: further experimental work is needed
to shed light on the similarities and differences of their
physiological roles in teleosts.

Methods
Nomenclature of teleost relaxin family genes
Wilkinson et al. (2005) identified six copies of relaxin in
Takifugu rubripes and called them RLX3a through RLX3f.
Recently, using both syntenic and phylogenetic data, Park
et al. (2008) estimated that the ancestor of tetrapods and
teleosts harboured three relaxin family loci (RFL): RFLA hosting INSL5-like genes, RFLB - containing RLN-like
genes and RFLCI - including RLN3-like genes; they suggest
that the duplication of RFLCII that gave rise to INSL3
occurred just prior to or after the divergence of Amphibia.
These previous studies included 11 [9] and 14 [36] teleost
sequences, and focused on resolving the phylogenetic and
molecular evolutionary patterns of the relaxin family in
tetrapods. Here, by searching the genomic databases of
five completed teleost genomes, and including 32 teleost
sequences, our results generally support the conclusions
of Park et al. [36], except that we find that teleosts harbour
an orthologue to human INSL3, indicating that the duplication of RFLC occurred prior to the divergence of teleosts
and tetrapods. The phylogenetic and syntenic data analyses presented below indicate that the genes originally
called RLX3a-3f by Wilkinson et al. [9] pertain to four
relaxin family loci and are more accurately named rln3a,
rln3b, rln, insl5a, insl5b, and insl3 respectively. The orthologous relationship of these genes to human relaxin family

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/293

genes and their equivalence in the nomenclature of
Wilkinson et al. [9] and Park et al. [36] is provided (Table
3).
Sequence identification and syntenic relationship of
relaxin family genes in teleosts
Publicly available databases were searched for relaxin
family homologues in the five teleost species for which a
significant region of the genome has been sequenced:
Tetraodon nigroviridis version 7 (Jaillon et al., 2004, http://
www.ensembl.org/Tetraodon_nigroviridis/Info/Index ),
Takifugu rubripes version 4 (Aparicio et al. 2002, http://
www.ensembl.org/Takifugu_rubripes/Info/Index ), Danio
rerio version 6 (The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio and as available at Ensembl, http://www.ensembl.org), Oryzias latipes
version 1 (Medaka Genome Project, http://dol
phin.lab.nig.ac.jp/medaka) and Gasterosteus aculeatus version 1 http://www.ensembl.org/Gasterosteus_aculeatus/
Info/Index . The sequences were first identified by using
the algorithms BLASTP and TBLASTN to search for the following D. rerio B-chain protein sequences: YGVKLCGREFIRAVIFTCGGSRW
(rln3b),
RTVKLCGREFIRAVVYTCGGSRW (insl5a), and VRVKLCGREFVRTVVASCGSFRV (insl3). High-scoring hits (>
65% sequence identity over the entire region) were identified and then the upstream and downstream regions of
the candidate relaxin family genes were searched for complete open-reading frames and other relaxin motifs, such
as the conserved A-chain structural motif (CXXXCX8C),
the B/C and C/A dibasic junctions, and the B-chain relaxin
receptor binding motif RXXXRXXI/V, as well as general
gene structure before being included in the data analyses.
In total 26 genes were identified from these five genomes,
23 of the genes are annotated and identified as belonging
to the RLN/INSL family in Ensembl (release 54); all of the
relaxin family genes exhibited the expected gene structure
for the family, complete open reading frames even
through the post-translationally cleaved C-peptide. The
Ensembl gene ID of these 23 genes as well as the location
of all 26 genes is given (Release 54, Appendix Table two).

All known mammalian relaxin sequences were obtained
from Homo sapiens RLN1, RLN2, RLN3, INSL3, INSL 5 and
INSL 6; Mus musculus RLN, RLN3, INSL3, INSL5 and
INSL6; Rattus norvegicus RLN, RLN3, INSL3 and INSL6;
and Canis familiaris RLN, RLN3, INSL3 and INSL6 from
GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ , and all known
relaxin sequences from Xenopus tropicalis were included.
Additionally, six relaxin family genes were identified from
other teleost species from cDNA or EST databases at NCBI:
Oncorhynchus mykiss rln3a and insl5b; Pimephales promelas
rln3b and insl3; and Salmo salar rln3a and insl5a (Appendix
Table two) such that a total of 32 teleost relaxin family
genes were included. Mammalian sequences for INSL4

were not included in the analysis because the gene contains a large insertion, is present only in mammals, and
was the subject of a previous bioinformatic analysis [9].
A syntenic analysis of the relationship between teleost and
mammalian relaxin family genes was performed by identifying the position of up to ten genes both up- and downstream of the focal genes in D. rerio, T. nigroviridis, T.
rubripes, O. latipes and G. aculeatus. Syntenic maps were
constructed based on the information regarding the location of genes available from Ensembl's BioMart data mining tool http://www.ensembl.org/multi/martview and, as
needed, verified using the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics
web server http://genome.ucsc.edu.
Phylogenetic analyses
For all sequences, the location of the signal peptide was
determined using SignalP 3.0 [47] using default settings
and then the sequence was removed. Sequence alignment
was accomplished by manually aligning the translated Band A-chain conserved motifs and twin dibasic motifs, the
latter correspond to the protease cleavage sites between
the B/C and C/A chain (Figure 4). The sequence between
the two twin dibasic motifs was removed before alignment, because it contained the non-conserved intron and
C-chain, but the entire B- and A-domains plus the four
amino acids at the B/C and C/A protease cleavage sites
were included since the latter could be potential targets of
selection (Figure 4). Relaxin family members have classically been distinguished by the presence of the receptor
binding RXXXRXXI/V motif on the B-chain; however, this
is not specific enough to identify individual teleost relaxin
family genes. Therefore, sequence motifs for the B-chain
and dibasic cut sites were identified to characterize potentially important structural and functional residues and to
aid in distinguishing teleost relaxin family genes (Additional File 1: Table S3). Teleost rln3a, rln3b and rln share
an identical strongly conserved B-chain motif that is also
shared by mammalian RLN3 but teleost rln differs from
teleost and mammalian RLN3 in its C/A dibasic motif.
Teleost insl5a and insl5b are less conserved than rln3a,
rln3b and rln and contain unique but related B-chain and
dibasic motifs. Finally, insl3 contains the least conserved
B-chain but has specific dibasic processing sites that distinguish it from the remaining relaxin family genes (Additional File 1: Table S3).

The most appropriate model of nucleotide sequence evolution was identified using likelihood ratio tests as implemented in Model Test [48]. The phylogenetic relationship
among nucleotide sequences was reconstructed using the
optimality criteria of both minimum evolution and Bayesian methods as implemented in MEGA 3.1 [49] and
MrBayes 3.12 [50] respectively. Preliminary analyses indicated that variation at the third position was saturated and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/293

confounded resolution at deep internal nodes. Therefore,
trees based on nucleotide data were reconstructed in
MrBayes by partitioning the data into first, second and
third codon position, and allowing each partition to
evolve at its own rate with its own shape (gamma) parameter, or by including only the first two positions when
minimum evolution was the optimality criteria. The relationship among amino acid sequences was also reconstructed using Bayesian methods available in MrBayes
3.12 [50] and the appropriate model of amino acid
change was determined using hierarchical likelihood tests
as implemented in ProTest version 1.0.6 [51] or by Bayesian methods. For the Bayesian analyses, the model of
amino acid change was examined by allowing the parameter space explored by the MCMC algorithm in MrBayes to
include eight different amino acid models (prset = mixed)
and then choosing the model with the highest posterior
probability as the best available model. For the Bayesian
analyses of both the amino acid and nucleotide data, the
MCMC algorithm was run with four simultaneous chains
that sampled from the posterior distribution every 300
generations; trees sampled before the cold chain reached
stationarity based on plots of the maximum likelihood
scores were discarded as "burnin" while sampling continued until convergence was achieved based on the average
standard deviation of the split frequencies and the potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) as given in MrBayes. Statistical confidence in the deduced evolutionary trees was
assessed by examining the Bayesian Posterior Probabilities (BPP) on the majority-rule consensus tree containing
branch lengths for the Bayesian analyses or by bootstrapping the sequences for 1000 generations for the minimum
evolution analyses.
Evidence for selection at the gene and codon level
To test whether the rates of molecular evolution were
homogeneous across gene families, the two-cluster test
was employed [52]. This test identifies those clades/genes
that have significantly different rates of substitution based
on an a priori hypothesis about which clades should be
examined. Here, the rate of evolution was compared in
nine clades: teleost rln3a, rln3b, rln, insl5a, insl5b and insl3
and mammalian RLN3, INSL3 and INSL5, while mammalian RLN and INSL6 were used as outgroups. The twocluster test was conducted on the phylogenetic tree generated using minimum evolution using the program TPCV
in LINTREE and only those comparisons with Z-scores
high enough to give a p < 0.01 were taken as significant.

To assess the strength of purifying selection among genes,
we calculated the average proportion of mutations leading
to synonymous (ds) versus non-synonymous (dn) changes
for all orthologous relaxin family sequences separately in
teleosts and mammals. The ratio of dn/ds was calculated in
MEGA 3.1 using a Nei-Gojobori model of nucleotide sub-

Page 16 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:293

stitution [49]. Pairwise comparisons between teleost
relaxin family genes were performed and average dn/ds
values calculated across the entire gene, or for only the Bchain and A-chains; additionally the codon-based Z-test
was used to determine if dn/ds within each gene or gene
region was significantly different from 1.0 using bootstrapping to estimate the variances [49]. Because dn/ds values are calculated pairwise and the average value from all
pairwise comparisons reported, the same five teleost species (those for which the whole genomes were available)
and four mammalian sequences were included in these
analyses.
Positive selection is often restricted to specific lineages
and a few amino acid sites, therefore, we further employed
the branch-site model A [53] to look for evidence of
codon-specific positive selection on orthologous gene
families in teleosts versus mammals. The application of
this model requires that the user specify a priori which
branch is being tested for evidence of positive selection,
the so-called foreground branch, while the remaining
groups are defined as background branches. Tests of positive selection were made by comparing the branch-site
model A in which Ï (dn/ds) â¥ 1 (alternative hypothesis) to
the model A in which Ï = 1 fixed (null hypothesis) and
setting the foreground branch to the base of the clade containing the relaxin family orthologue in teleosts and the
background branch was set to the same orthologue in
mammals or vice versa [54]. Analysis of the branch-site
model A was done using CODEML from the PAML package (PAML v. 4.2); models were compared using the Likelihood Ratio Test with 1 degree of freedom and, where
significant, the posterior probability that a codon was
under positive selection was estimated using the Bayes
empirical Bayes (BEB) procedure [55].
Expression of relaxin family genes in zebrafish using realtime, quantitative PCR
We tested for the expression of rln3a, rln3b, insl5a, insl5b
and insl3 in D. rerio, which lacks rln (Appendix, Table
two), using real-time, quantitative PCR (qPCR). Total
RNA was extracted from the brain, heart, gill, gut, ovary,
testis, and eye of adult zebrafish using the Aurum total
RNA mini kit (BioRad) and first strand cDNA synthesized
from 5 Î¼g of total RNA with oligo dT and random hexamer priming (iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit, BioRad).

The relative transcript abundance of the five relaxin family
genes in D. rerio across tissues was then calculated via
qPCR using a MiniOpticon Real-Time detection system
(BioRad). Oligonucleotide primers for rln3a, insl5a and
insl3 were taken from Wilson et al. (2008), while those for
rln3b and insl5b were designed using PRIMER3 software
[56]. The primers selected for rln3b were: F:5'-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/293

CGGCTCTCGTAGTGTGTCTG-3'and R:5'-CCTGTTCACCTTGTCCCAGT-3' and for insl5b were: F: 5'GCTCAGGCACAGAAAGGTCT-3'
and
R:
5'GCTGGAGTCCTGTGCTTCTC-3'. The iQâ¢SYBRÂ® Green
Supermix kit was used according to the manufacturer's
suggested protocols (BioRad). Standard curves were generated for all of the used primers to compute the amplification efficiency values for each primer set. The
insignificant difference observed among the calculated
efficiency values permitted us to calibrate Ct values of the
target relaxin family genes in each tissue relative to their
expression in eye (low abundance transcript, used as the
calibrator in the equation below), and normalize them to
a reference, housekeeping gene (b2m), previously shown
to exhibit consistent expression across sexes, tissues and
developmental stages in D. rerio [57]. This further allowed
us to determine the relative fold increase of each relaxin
gene relative to the housekeeping gene according to the
ÎCt , target (calibrator â test )
formula: 2 ÎCt , ref (calibrator â test ) [58]. Each gene was

tested three times and standard errors were calculated so
that comparisons could be made across genes and tissues
using the coefficient of variation (CV) where:

(5'-CCGGGGGGTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGTACTGAATCAGTT CATTCATGGTGCA-3'; containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence
[underlined]). The ~ 450 bp PCR product was gel purified,
and served as a template for digoxigenin-labeled cRNA
probe synthesis. For digoxigenin-RNA labeling by in vitro
transcription, 500 ng PCR product was incubated at 37Â°C
for 2.5 h in a 20 Î¼l reaction volume containing 4 Î¼l 5 Ã T3/
T7 RNA buffer (Invitrogen), 2 Î¼l 0.1 M DTT, 1 Î¼l (29.7
units/Î¼l) RNAguard (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT, USA)
and 2 Î¼l 10 Ã DIG RNA labeling mix (Roche), and either
2 Î¼l (50 units/Î¼l) T3 RNA polymerase (Epicentre; for
sense cRNA probe synthesis) or 2 Î¼l (50 units/Î¼l) T7 RNA
polymerase (Epicentre; for antisense cRNA probe synthesis).

To visualize cellular expression sites of insl3 mRNA in
zebrafish testis, whole mount in situ hybridization was
performed on zebrafish testicular tissue, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4), as described by WesterPage 17 of 19

Briefly, tissue was treated with 20 Î¼g/ml proteinase K
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 37Â°C for 20 min. Moreover, after postfixation and before pre-hybridization, an acetic anhydride
(0.25% in 0.1 M triethanolamine; Merck) treatment was
included to reduce background. After termination of NBT/
BCIP (Sigma-Aldrich) staining with 3 consecutive PBS
washings, tissue was examined with a binocular connected to a digital camera.

Authors' contributions
SVG-A. Oversaw the project, performed the phylogenetic,
dn/ds, molecular clock, synteny, and codon selection analyses and wrote the bulk of the final paper. SY performed
the qPCR laboratory work and analyses, helped with the
synteny analyses, drew the synteny figures and helped
with the literature search and writing and editing of the
manuscript. SH helped collect the sequences, trimmed
and aligned them, and devised the teleost gene motifs and
helped write a previous version of the paper. JB performed
the in situ hybridization analyses and helped with revising
the manuscript, PG and JO both helped collect the original sequences and JO tabulated most of the information
in Appendix 1, BW helped edit the manuscript and initiated the study. All authors have read and agreed to the
final version of the manuscript.
