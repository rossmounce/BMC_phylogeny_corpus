Abstract
Background: Neurotrophins and their Trk and p75NTR receptors play an important role in the
nervous system. To date, neurotrophins, Trk and p75NTR have only been found concomitantly in
deuterostomes. In protostomes, homologues to either neurotrophin, Trk or p75NTR are
reported but their phylogenetic relationship to deuterostome neurotrophin signaling components
is unclear. Drosophila has neurotrophin homologues called Spätzles (Spz), some of which were
recently renamed neurotrophins, but direct proof that these are deuterostome neurotrophin
orthologues is lacking. Trks belong to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family and among RTKs,
Trks and RORs are closest related. Flies lack Trks but have ROR and ROR-related proteins called
NRKs playing a neurotrophic role. Mollusks have so far the most similar proteins to Trks (Lymnaea
Trk and Aplysia Trkl) but the exact phylogenetic relationship of mollusk Trks to each other and to
vertebrate Trks is unknown. p75NTR belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)
superfamily. The divergence of the TNFR families in vertebrates has been suggested to parallel the
emergence of the adaptive immune system. Only one TNFR representative, the Drosophila
Wengen, has been found in protostomes. To clarify the evolution of neurotrophin signaling
components in bilateria, this work analyzes the genome of the crustacean Daphnia pulex as well as
new genetic data from protostomes.
Results: The Daphnia genome encodes a neurotrophin, p75NTR and Trk orthologue together
with Trkl, ROR, and NRK-RTKs. Drosophila Spz1, 2, 3, 5, 6 orthologues as well as two new groups
of Spz proteins (Spz7 and 8) are also found in the Daphnia genome. Searching genbank and the
genomes of Capitella, Helobdella and Lottia reveals neurotrophin signaling components in other
protostomes.
Conclusion: It appears that a neurotrophin, Trk and p75NTR existed at the protostome/
deuterostome split. In protostomes, a "neurotrophin superfamily" includes Spzs and neurotrophins
which respectively form two paralogous families. Trks and Trkl proteins also form closely related
paralogous families within the protostomian RTKs, whereby Trkls are absent in deuterostomes.
The finding of p75NTR in several protostomes suggests that death domain TNFR superfamily
proteins appeared early in evolution.

Background
In mammals, four paralogous neurotrophins play a role
in embryonic neural development[1], adult neuroplasticity[2,3] and regeneration[4] of the nervous system: Nerve
Growth Factor (NGF), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor
(BDNF), Neurotrophin 3 (NT3) and Neurotrophin 4/5
(NT4/5). The neurotrophin signaling system is also
involved in the immune system[5]. The biological effects
of the neurotrophins are mediated by three paralogous
Trks (TrkA, TrkB, TrkC) belonging to the Trk family of
Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTK) as well as by the 75 kDa
neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. Each Trk receptor preferably binds to a different neurotrophin, whereby TrkA,
TrkB and TrkC can be activated by NGF, BDNF/NT4/5 and
NT3 respectively. In contrast, the p75NTR receptor is non
selective and has a similar affinity for all neurotrophins.
Additional functional complexity results from formation
of heterodimeric complexes between p75NTR and TrkA,
TrkB or TrkC. These complexes alter the signaling properties of both partners of the complex[6]. Paralogues of
p75NTR, known as neurotrophin receptor homologue
NRH1 in fish, birds and amphibians, and NRH2 in mammals also form complexes with, and alter signaling by
TrkA, TrkB and TrkC. The multiplicity of neurotrophins
and Trk receptors in vertebrates apparently arose as a
result of two rounds of genome duplications that occurred
at the root of vertebrate evolution, the first duplication
occurring before the emergence of agnathan fish and the
second occurring after the emergence of cartilaginous fish
[7-9]. The NRH paralogues of p75NTR may have been
generated by a similar mechanism[10]. If the multiple vertebrate paralogues of the components of the signaling system arose by genome duplication events what was the
evolutionary origin of the genes that were duplicated by
those events?
Until recently, the neurotrophin/Trk/p75NTR signaling
system was not found outside the vertebrates. Indeed, no
component of this signaling system was present in the
genome sequence of two protostomes, the insect Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [11]. An invertebrate deuterostome, the tunicate
Ciona intestinalis did not have the signaling system either,
which led to hypothesize that neurotrophins, Trks and
p75NTR were vertebrate innovations. This hypothesis was
challenged, however, when the genome of two additional
invertebrate deuterostomes, the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae (amphioxus)[12,13] and the echinoderm
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (purple sea urchin)[14,15]
were shown to include the neurotrophin/Trk signaling
system in their sequence. Analysis of genomic data from
Strongylocentrotus as well as EST data from another invertebrate deuterostome, the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii (acorn worm) additionally identified a p75NTR in
both of those species[10]. This suggested that the neuro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/243

trophin/Trk/p75NTR system arose at least at the root of
deuterostomes[8,10]. Clues to an earlier origin of the neurotrophin/Trk/p75NTR system arise from proteins in
some protostomes bearing homology to either one of the
signaling components of the neurotrophin/Trk/p75NTR
system. Nevertheless, none of the neurotrophin/Trk/
p75NTR homologues have so far been found concomitantly in a protostomian species. Moreover, when a
homologue of a component of the neurotrophin/Trk/
p75NTR signaling system has occasionally been
described, its phylogenetic relationship to either the neurotrophin or Trk, or p75NTR, has remained uncertain. For
example, insects have structural neurotrophin homologues called Spätzle (Spz) proteins[16]. In Drosophila, 6
Spz proteins have been identified and are named Spz (or
Spz1), Spz2, 3 etc. Spz proteins share a sequence homologous to the characteristic cysteine knot which is known
to induce the particular neurotrophin three dimensional
fold[17]. Because Spz, Spz2 and Spz5 proteins are organized in the same way as neurotrophins, with a signal peptide and a pro-domain that can be proteolytically
removed from the mature protein containing the Cys
knot[18], Zhu et al. [19] recently investigated their function in the Drosophila nervous system. The researchers
demonstrated that Drosophila Spz, Spz2 and Spz5 have
neurotrophic properties comparable to neurotrophins. In
the Zhu paper, Drosophila Spz2 and Spz5 were renamed
Drosophila Neurotrophin 1 (DNT1) and Drosophila Neurotrophin 2 (DNT2) respectively, but the exact phylogenetic
relationship of Spz, DNT1 and DNT2 to deuterostome
neurotrophins could not be resolved. Whether Spzs signal
through Trk receptors, which would be expected if they
were neurotrophin orthologues is also not known, and
the sequence of a Trk receptor orthologue has so far not
been found in flies. Spz, the representative of the Spz family is moreover known to signal through the Toll receptor,
a receptor involved in the nervous and innate immune
systems and in dorso-ventral patterning in the Drosophila
embryo[20,21].
Trks are modular protein receptors consisting of a conserved extracellular part, a transmembrane domain and a
cytoplasmic part. The cytoplasmic part contains a tyrosine
kinase domain which is common to many representatives
of the RTK family, to which Trks belong. Among RTKs,
Trks and RORs share the most similar tyrosine kinase
domain[22]. In insects where Trks have not been found,
RORs (Drosophila ROR and a Drosophila ROR-like protein
called Neurospecific Receptor Kinase (NRK)) have been
shown to have a neurotrophic role[23]. As for protostomian Trk-related sequences, the closest related Trk receptors have been found in mollusks. In the mollusk Aplysia
californica, a protein called ApTrkl was found to have a
tyrosine kinase domain most similar to that of Trk receptors than to any other tyrosine kinase domain[24]. ApTrkl

is also expressed, like Trks, in sensory neurons. Nonetheless, the ApTrkl ectodomain and long intracytoplasmic Cterminal extension are totally unrelated to the Trk family
of neurotrophic receptors. Accordingly, ApTrkl is not
responsive to mammalian neurotrophin stimulation but
to serotonin. In another mollusk, the snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a Trk related receptor called LTrk, which is specifically expressed in the central nervous system, was found
to have most of the characteristics of vertebrate Trk receptors[25,26]. Like ApTrkl, LTrk has a tyrosine kinase
domain more related to Trks than to any other RTK. In
addition, the LTrk extracellular part displays characteristics of a vertebrate Trk including a leucine rich repeat
(LRR) motif flanked by two cysteine clusters. In this extracellular part, however, LTrk lacks two immunoglobulin
(Ig) domains of the C2 type, which are a major interface
for neurotrophin binding in vertebrates. LTrk has instead
an Ig-like domain of the C1 type, which is exclusively
common to molecules involved in immune system function, such as immunoglobulins, major histocompatibility
complex molecules and T cell receptors. The phylogenetic
relationship of Lymnaea Trk and Aplysia Trkl to each other
and to deuterostome Trks is not well understood and neurotrophin like ligands have not been found so far in mollusks.
Finally, no p75NTR has been reported in protostomes.
Despite being a neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR does not
belong, as do Trk receptors, to the RTK family. Instead
p75NTR is a member of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) Superfamily (SF) (TNFRSF) [27]. To date, the
only TNFRSF representative in protostomes is the Drosophila TNFR Wengen[28]. Wengen has some degree of
similarity to p75NTR but it lacks a so-called "death
domain" in the intracellular part of the protein. The death
domain is present in p75NTR orthologues and in a few
vertebrate TNFRs. In this study, the genome of Daphnia
pulex was investigated for components of the neurotrophin/Trk/p75NTR signaling system. The search was
subsequently extended to other protostomes by surveying
genbank nucleotide and EST data, as well as the recent
genome sequences of Capitella sp. I, Lottia gigantea and
Helobdella robusta. The Daphnia genome encodes a neurotrophin, a p75NTR and a Trk orthologue together with
Trkl, ROR and NRK-RTKs. Drosophila Spz1, 2, 3, 5, 6
orthologues as well as two new groups of Spz proteins
(Spz7 and Spz8) are also present in the Daphnia genome.
Neurotrophin signaling components are also found in
other protostomes and the evolution of these components in the bilateria is discussed.

Results and discussion
Neurotrophin and Spz genes in Daphnia and protostomes:
Evolution in the bilateria
Daphnia Spz genes
Daphnia Spz genes
In insects, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and
the mosquito Aedes aegypti, 6 Spz genes, numbered from 1
to 6 have been characterized, whereby the so-called Spz
(or Spz1) is viewed as the Spz family representative. Spzs
are the closest neurotrophin related proteins in protostomes, and Drosophila Spz2 (DNT1) and Spz5 (DNT2)
are also termed "neurotrophins" although the orthology
to vertebrate neurotrophins has not been strictly demonstrated[19]. Searching for a neurotrophin/Trk/p75NTR
system in Daphnia included a quest for Spz genes.
tBLASTN with, as queries, the amino acid sequences defining the Cys knot (also called C-106) of the 6 insect Spz
paralogues yielded Daphnia sequence hits to the insect
Spzs with low e-value. Further analysis revealed putative
Daphnia pulex sequences for Spz, Spz2, 3, 5 and 6 respectively and these were named Dappu-Spz1, Dappu-Spz2,
Dappu-Spz3, Dappu-Spz5 and Dappu-Spz6. Spz4 was not
found in the Daphnia pulex genome, but Dappu-Spz3
could be orthologous to both Spz3 and Spz4. Indeed,
Spz3s and Spz4s form very close families within Spzs and
phylogenetic analyses in this manuscript with both Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) show
that Spz3s and Spz4s cluster via a node supported by high
ML bootstrap and BI posterior probability (pp) values
(83% and 1 respectively). These values are similar to those
supporting nodes for other respective Spz paralogues (e.g
node for Spz5s is supported by ML bootstrap: 90% or BI
pp: 1). Moreover, a ML analysis places Dappu-Spz3 with
Drosophila, Aedes and Ixodes (tick) Spz3, with 65% bootstrap values, while BI places Dappu-Spz3 closer to Anopheles gambiae (mosquito) and Drosophila Spz4, but with low
pp value (0.59) (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Results for the
search of Daphnia Spz paralogues are summarized in
Table 1 which includes also the scaffold coordinates of the
genes, the models predicting the Spz genes and the genbank numbers of supporting ESTs. In addition to known
Spz paralogues, searching the Daphnia genome with insect
Spz2s as queries yielded multiple additional hits with low
e-values. The Spz2-like sequences were mostly located on
Scaffold 9, but also on other scaffolds (Table 1). For the
purpose of this analysis, only Spz2-like sequences with
supporting ESTs, were catalogued and further considered.
To understand the relationship of the additional Spz2-like
sequences to other Spz genes and to the neurotrophins,
phylogenetic trees were derived from an alignment of the
sequence stretch defining the Cys knot (called C-106 for
Spz proteins). The reason for only analyzing the Cys knot
was that Spz genes can undergo differential splicing and in
some cases, such as for Drosophila Spz, alternative splicing
results in a high plasticity of the protein N terminal region

prior to the Cys knot [29]. Without enough knowledge of
the full repertoire of Spz splice variants in Daphnia and
other species, the use of the Cys knot encoding sequence
was devised. This approach was also taken to characterize
Spz paralogues in Aedes aegypti[30]. Because Spz6
sequences are longer than the other Spz paralogues in the
C-106 region, their sequences had to be truncated to allow
a correct alignment. An arrow head at amino acid 102
within the alignment in Figure 3 shows the junction
where Spz6 sequence fragments were removed. Figure 3
depicts only a portion of the sequences used for the phylogenetic analysis and is for illustration purposes only. The
full alignment used for the phylogenetic analysis is
appended to this manuscript as supplementary material
"see additional file 1". In order to conduct unbiased analyses, phylogenetic trees including and excluding Spz6
were done, and both have the same topology (the tree
without Spz6 is not shown as it is redundant). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted with either ML or BI. Figure
1 and/or Figure 2 depict the best BI tree topology where
Spz6s are included. Support values for the nodes obtained
by both ML and BI figure on the tree, whereby BI pp values
figure directly above the branches, while ML bootstrap
values are depicted below the branches. In the phylogenetic analysis, Dappu-Spz2, 3 (or 3-4), 5 and 6 cluster
with their respective arthropod orthologues with over
80% ML bootstrap values and with constant BI pp values
of 1. The orthology of Dappu-Spz1 to other Spz1 (or Spz)
orthologues is less supported, but phylogenetic analysis
indicates that the Dappu-Spz1 belongs to the Spz family,
yet differs from all the other known Daphnia Spz paralogues, in particular Spz2s. The pattern formed by the
Cysteines within the Cys knot of Dappu-Spz1 suggests
that Dappu-Spz1 is a putative Spz (Spz1) orthologue.
Indeed, apart from an extra Cys adjacent to the fifth Cys
which is responsible for the Cys knot, Spzs (Spz1s) and
Spz2s have the particularity of having no additional Cys
than those forming the Cys knot, within the Cys knot
domain. Since Dappu-Spz1 has the typical Cys arrangement of Spz1s and Spz2s and Dappu-Spz1 can be ruled
out as a Spz2 orthologue, Dappu-Spz1 is probably a Spz1
orthologue presenting a high degree of sequence divergence to known Spz1s.
In the phylogenetic analysis, the Spz2-like sequences that
were retrieved by tBLASTN using Spz2 as query form two
groups of sequences. Representatives of the first group
were named Dappu-Spz7A, 7B etc. while representatives
of the second group were named Dappu-Spz8A, 8B etc. to
distinguish them from the 6 Spz representatives known to
date.
Daphnia Spz7s and Spz8s define new Spz paralogues in crustaceans
To check whether Spz7 and/or Spz8 sequences could be
found in other species than Daphnia, tBLASTN searches

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/243

were conducted on genbank with representatives of the
Spz7 and Spz8 groups. The search recovered EST
sequences from crustaceans only and the latter clustered
with either group in the phylogenetic tree. Spz7 sequences
cluster together at a node supported by an ML bootstrap
value of 59% and a BI pp value of 0.99. Spz8 sequences
also respectfully cluster together with an ML bootstrap
value of 64% and a BI pp value of 0.92. An alignment of
some of the sequences used for the phylogenetic tree is
shown in Figure 3. Genbank numbers of crustacean ESTs
other than Daphnia, falling into the Spz7 or Spz8 groups
are indicated in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) and in the
alignment (Figure 3) next to the species name. The large
number of Spz7 and Spz8 (six and eight sequence representatives respectively in Daphnia, or more (since only
genome predictions with supporting ESTs were considered)) suggests an expansion of these genes in the Daphnia
genome and perhaps in crustaceans, as both sequence
types were also found for example in Artemia franciscana
(brine shrimp) and Lepeophtheirus salmonis (salmon
louse). If the genome assembly is correct, some Spz7
genes, such as for example Dappu-Spz7D, are duplicated
as identical copies either on different scaffolds or as a tandem on a unique scaffold (Table 1). Tandem gene duplications have been shown for genes under high selective
pressure, such as for example, duplication sweeps in the
Culex pipiens mosquito driven by insecticide treatment[31] or tandem duplications in fish antifreeze proteins as a way to adapt to cooling water temperatures[32].
Because Spz, the representative of the Spz family is
involved in innate immunity, the expansion of Spz7 and/
or 8 genes could be driven by an immune related ecological response. If this is the case, this could explain why
many ESTs encoding such genes are derived from Daphnia
individuals subjected to stress (Table 2). Spz7 and Spz8
representatives have a conserved Cys within the sequence
stretch between Cys III and IV defining the Cys knot (Figure 3). This Cys is also found in Spz3, but not in other Spz
paralogues. Spz7 representatives have an additional Cys
between Cys IV and V of the Cys knot, and the latter additional Cys is unique to Spz7 proteins when compared to
other Spz paralogues. Spz7s and Spz8s have some degree
of similarity to Spz2 proteins, since using Spz2s as queries
for tBLASTN searches enabled their finding. Some of the
"non-Daphnia" ESTs encoding Spz7 and Spz8 proteins
were described as Spz2-like in genbank. This is somewhat
supported by phylogenetic trees obtained by BI. In BI

by the presence of additional Cys, but also because they

Daphnia neurotrophin gene and homologues in the protostomes
Predicted Daphnia neurotrophin protein
Searching Daphnia pulex ESTs in the NCBI database by
tBLASTN with Strongylocentrotus neurotrophins as queries,
yielded a partial Daphnia EST ([GenBank:FE359769.1],
[GenBank:FE359768.1]) with high similarity to neurotrophins. The EST sequence was translated into a peptide
sequence and used to tBLASTN search gene predictions on
the Daphnia genome whereby enabling to recover the full
sequence on scaffold 1 (Dappu-94262). The recovered
sequence was distinct from all the Spz sequences
described above (Figure 5). In vertebrates, neurotrophins

are encoded as a precursor containing a signal sequence, a
propeptide and the mature neurotrophin. Analysis of the
Daphnia pulex neurotrophin candidate (Dappu-NT) with
the signal sequence prediction software SignalP 3.0 predicts a most likely signal sequence cleavage site between
position 25 and 26 (VNA|QR). Analysis of the sequence
with the propeptide prediction tool ProP identifies a most
probable propeptide cleavage site at position 116
(HNHRLVR|SR). An alignment of Dappu-NT with other
deuterostome neurotrophins also shows that the six characteristically spaced Cys residues for disulfide bonding are
present (Figure 3 and Figure 5). Dappu-NT does not have
the C-terminal extension characterizing Spz2s (including
Drosophila NT2) (Figure 4).
Genomic organization of the putative Daphnia neurotrophin
In vertebrates, the overall genomic organization of neurotrophin genes is similar. Neurotrophin genes have one
large major exon of approximately one kb encoding the
entire neurotrophin precursor. The precursor major exon

is preceded by one or more smaller upstream exons. The
Dappu-NT gene is particular since predictions suggest that
the precursor is encoded by 6 exons (Figure 6). The exons
are not segmented according to the signal peptide,
propeptide and mature protein. The signal sequence and
part of the propeptide sequence are encoded by the first
exon. The rest of the propeptide is also split into two additional exons and so is the sequence encoding the Cys knot
which comprises four exons. Although vertebrate neurotrophins are encoded in a more compact genomic structure than Dappu-NT, it is noteworthy to point out that the
genome of Strongylocentrotus (sea urchin), an invertebrate
deuterostome, encodes two neurotrophin types. The first
is the recently described Sp-NT (depicted as "sea urchin
NT" in Figure 2 and Figure 3). Sp-NT shares the same
intron-exon characteristics as vertebrate neurotrophins.

[GenBank:

2 and Figure 3) has a precursor sequence encoded by several exons, like the Daphnia neurotrophin, but with a different intron-exon arrangement (not shown).

Other putative protostome neurotrophins
The discovery of a putative neurotrophin gene in Daphnia
pulex along side Spz genes prompted to ask whether these
genes could be found in other protostomes. Search of genbank sequence data with Dappu-NT as query, did not
yield orthologous sequences in flies. ESTs of high similarity to the Dappu-NT were however identified in the ticks
Rhipicephalus microplus and Ixodes scapularis (arachnid
arthropods). A sequence fragment encoding only part of
the Cys knot of the mature neurotrophin was found for
Rhipicephalus [Genbank: FG579776.1] while longer and
respectively overlapping ESTs were retrieved for Ixodes.
Some of the Ixodes sequences were derived from the synganglia, a central nervous system structure [e.g. Genbank:
EL516713.1] and the longest EST [Genbank: EL516713.1]
encoded a putative signal peptide, prodomain as well as a
neurotrophin Cys knot structure in the predicted mature
protein. The Ixodes neurotrophin sequence was moreover
found along side Ixodes ESTs encoding different Spz paralogues, such as a putative Ixodes Spz1 [Genbank:
EW823171.1] and Spz3 [Genbank: EW797276.1]. This
suggests that neurotrophins and Spzs are present within
several classes of arthropods including crustaceans and
arachnids. It is generally accepted that protostomes comprise two groups of animals, the ecdysozoa (comprising

lophotrochozoans, but the limited amount of representatives with complete genetic data in this group makes it too
early to conclude that Spzs are absent.

To verify the relationship of the putative protostome neurotrophin sequences of Daphnia, Ixodes, Rhipicephalus,

sequences were phylogenetically analyzed with both pro-

described previously) and deuterostome neurotrophins.

which is distinct from that formed by the "neurotrophin

strongly supported both by a ML bootstrap value of 97%
and a BI pp value of 1. This implies that neurotrophin and
Spz families form paralogous families and in the same

time suggests for the first time that protostomes have deuterostome neurotrophin orthologues (Figure 2).
Evolution of neurotrophin/Spz genes in the bilateria
Spz and neurotrophins form two closely related paralogous families
in the protostomes
The phylogenetic analyses presented in this work, show
that Spzs and neurotrophins form two paralogous families in the protostomes. Figure 3 shows an alignment of
the Cys knot of the major Spz paralogues, to neurotrophins from protostome, invertebrate deuterostome,
and vertebrate origin. Three sites, which are numbered in
reference to the alignment in Figure 3, distinguish the
neurotrophin and Spz families. The first is Pro13 (highlighted in bright red, Figure 3) which is conserved in all of
the Spz peptide sequences, but not found in the neurotrophins. The second is an aromatic residue in Spz proteins at position 133 (Phe or Tyr (in dark red, Figure 3)),
which is replaced by an Ile or Val in neurotrophins.
Finally, Trp 130 (blue) is not found in any Spz proteins,
yet it is conserved in all neurotrophins (except for the
Branchiostoma, "amphioxus NT", that has a Tyr). Despite
these three differences, Spzs and neurotrophins share the
six Cys forming the Cys knot in neurotrophins as well as
Gln44 whose side chain (in neurotrophins), contributes a
crucial hydrogen bond to the tertiary structure. Three
hydrophobic sites at position 26, 133 and 135 (indicated
below the alignment by an H in Figure 3) which locate to
the hydrophobic core of the neurotrophins are also common to Spzs and neurotrophins. These similarities and
the recent results of Zhu et al. showing that Spzs and neurotrophins have similar functions, argues that the two
families are closely related[19]. When the Spz and neurotrophin families diverged, and where they originate in the
bilateria, is difficult to pinpoint. Spz genes have not been
found in deuterostomes, so if they were already present at
the protostome/deuterostome split, they were probably
lost in the deuterostome lineage. Alternatively, Spz genes
could have evolved from duplications of an ancestral neurotrophin-like gene somewhere in the lineage leading to
the protostomes.
Evolution of neurotrophins in the bilateria
In the phylogenetic trees, protostome neurotrophins fall
into several groups. Ecdysozoa arthropod neurotrophins
cluster together (Rhipicephalus, Ixodes and Daphnia) while
another group is formed by the Lophotrochozoa (Lottia,
Capitella and Helobdella) neurotrophins. The invertebrate
deuterostome neurotrophin sequences used for the tree
include those of a Cephalochordate (Branchiostoma
(amphioxus in Figure 2)), a Hemichordate (Saccoglossus
(acorn worm, Figure 2)) and an Echinoderm (Strongylocentrotus (sea urchin, Figure 2)). Echinoderms and Hemichordates are closely related and form a clade called
Ambulacraria. The two previously described Strongylocen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/243

trotus neurotrophin paralogues were included in the phylogenetic analysis. Only one neurotrophin has been
described for Saccoglossus but search of the genbank EST
database for the purpose of this study revealed two different ESTs that were arbitrarily called "acorn worm Nta"
([GenBank:FF527248.1] undescribed so far) and "acorn
&
[Genworm
Ntb"
([GenBank:FF505731.1]
Bank:FF504966.1]) [8,10]. The genome of Saccoglossus is
still unavailable, so the full repertoire of neurotrophins in
this genome cannot yet be investigated. In the tree, ambulacraria neurotrophins form two groups, in accordance
with the two Strongylocentrotus neurotrophins. The Strongylocentrotus neurotrophin Sp-NT2 ("sea urchin NT2" in
Figure 2), which does not have the canonical intron-exon
organization of vertebrate neurotrophins forms a group
with the two Saccoglossus neurotrophin ESTs ("acorn
worm NTa" and "acorn worm NTb"). The latter group is
more closely related to the protostome neurotrophins, as
it diverges between the two groups formed by Ecdysozoa
and Lophotrochozoa neurotrophins in the tree (Figure 2).
The canonical Strongylocentrotus neurotrophin Sp-NT
("sea urchin NT" in Figure 2), which shares the same
intron-exon organization as vertebrates, clusters closer to
Branchiostoma ("amphioxus NT", Figure 2) and the vertebrates in the tree, consistent with what would be expected
for an invertebrate deuterostome neurotrophin. The
genome of Saccoglossus is not released, so it is not possible
to know if this genome encodes an additional canonical
neurotrophin type, which would in turn cluster with SpNT.
The presence of two Strongylocentrotus (Echinoderm) neurotrophins, one more protostome like (Sp-NT2 ("sea
urchin NT2", Figure 2)), and the other more vertebrate
like (Sp-NT ("sea urchin NT", Figure 2)), may indicate
interesting evolutionary transitions occurring at the stem
of the deuterostome lineage. The first transitions may be
small changes in the protein tertiary and quaternary structure. Sp-NT2 ("sea urchin NT2" in Figure 3) has a Pro at
position 136 in the alignment (Figure 3) which is not
found in Sp-NT ("sea urchin NT"), yet conserved in some
protostome neurotrophins and in all Spz proteins. Pro
136 is at the interface between associated Spz monomers
when dimerization occurs and is probably conserved in
Spzs for structural reasons. The replacement of Pro136 by
other residues in canonical deuterostome neurotrophins
may have changed the interface presented by each monomer for dimerization. Sp-NT2 ("sea urchin NT2") also has
an additional Cys adjacent to the fifth Cys knot, as does
the Saccoglossus "acorn worm NTb", which is reminiscent
of some Spz paralogues, and which, together with Pro136
allows tight homodimmer formation by covalent
disulfide bonding. Finally, Sp-NT2 ("sea urchin NT2")
and "acorn worm NTa" and "b" have an Asn at position
18 in the alignment (Figure 3) which is common to many

Page 12 of 26

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:243

Spz proteins but strictly replaced with an Asp in all canonical neurotrophins (highlighted in blue, Figure 3).
Remarkably, Asp18 (18 = alignment Figure 3 numbering,
and equivalent to mammalian neurotrophin Asp30) has
been shown to be important for tertiary structure stability,
and in particular, stability of a beta-hairpin loop formed
in neurotrophins by residues 18-22 (18-22 in the alignment, and equivalent to mammalian neurotrophin residues 30-34)[33].
The other transition that may have occurred at the stem of
the deuterostome lineage is the occurrence of gene duplications and the adoption by one of the duplicates, of a
more compact genomic structure. The precursor sequence
of Sp-NT2 is split into several exons, as is the precursor of
Daphnia neurotrophin and Spzs. The canonical neurotrophin paralogue Sp-NT in Strongylocentrotus, however,
has a precursor encoded by one exon like vertebrate neurotrophins. The two Strongylocentrotus neurotrophins
could have arisen from the duplication of an ancestral
gene at the base of the deuterostome lineage whereby one
or several duplicates retained a more ancestral character
leading to Sp-NT2 ("sea urchin NT2") and Saccoglosssus
"acorn worm NTa" and "b", while another type of duplicate adopted a more compact genomic organization. (The
genetic organization of the Saccoglossus genes will be interesting to examine in this respect). The gene(s) with ancestral character could have been lost before the divergence
of the Cephalochordates on the lineage leading to the vertebrates, leaving a canonical neurotrophin to duplicate via
genome duplications along the lineage leading to the vertebrates. It is noteworthy in this regard that neither protostome neurotrophins nor deuterostome invertebrate
neurotrophins share a closer relationship to any of the
vertebrate neurotrophin paralogues (NGF, BDNF, NT3
and NT4/5). In the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) the vertebrate genes form a tight cluster. In the alignment, all vertebrate neurotrophins share Thr116 (highlighted in green,
Figure 3). Thr116 which is known to form hydrogen
bonds across a beta hairpin is not found in any of the
invertebrate homologues, thus defining a vertebrate neurotrophin-like characteristic.
Trk and Trk-related families in the protostomes and
evolution in bilateria
The Daphnia and protostome Trks
Daphnia Trk receptor predicted peptide structure
Searching the Daphnia genome with deuterostome Trks
and with the protostome Lymnaea Trk yielded a unanimous result. A putative Trk receptor for Daphnia pulex
(Dappu-110423) was found on Scaffold 74 (Dappu V1.1
draft genome assembly/scaffold_74:471874-476291).
The predicted Daphnia Trk, named Dappu-Trk, has a
canonical vertebrate structure at every level (Figure 7). The
extracellular region of Dappu-Trk shares a common archi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/243

tecture with the extracytoplasmic domain of vertebrate
Trk receptors. It consists of two consecutive Leucine Rich
Repeats (LRRs) (Figure 7, italics) flanked by cysteine-rich
clusters (Figure 7, bold), followed by two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (Figure 7, underlined). LRRs and
cysteine-rich clusters have been reported to participate in
ligand binding: TrkB splicing variants lacking LRR motifs
are unable to bind any TrkB ligands[34]. The major interface for neurotrophin binding, however, is the second Iglike domain, where specific residues come into direct contact with the ligand[35]. Both Ig-like domains are of the
C2 type in vertebrates, Branchiostoma and Daphnia, and
the most C-terminal pole, which belongs to the second Iglike domain, contains asparagine residues with structural
roles for ligand-receptor interactions (N364 and N375 in
Dappu-Trk, Figure 7, grey underlined).
On the cytoplasmic side, Dappu-Trk includes a tyrosine
kinase (TK) domain that has all the key residues necessary
to carry out its function as a catalytic receptor. Like its vertebrate counterparts, it contains the signature pattern of
class II tyrosine kinase receptors DIYSSDYYK (Figure 7,
grey background). Within this short amino acid sequence,
three tyrosine residues (Y755, Y759 and Y760; Figure 7,
black background) constitute the putative auto-phosphorylation activation loop. A presumptive ATP-binding
region is located at the N-terminal pole of the TK domain
and contains a conserved lysine (K606, Figure 7, black
background) responsible for binding ATP. In addition,
two potential phosphorylation sites for cAMP/cGMPdependent kinase proteins lie in positions comparable to
those in vertebrates: RYS at the juxtamembrane intracytoplasmic part preceding the TK domain and RKFT following the activation loop within the TK domain (Figure 7,
black background). In vertebrates, the former motif is a
binding site for SNT, a protein involved in neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth pathways[36]. Also
present in Daphnia Trk is the docking site for Shc, an adaptor protein which in vertebrates activates the Ras-Raf-Erk
and PI3kinase-AKT signaling pathways involved in neuronal survival and differentiation events. It is identically
placed, preceding the tyrosine kinase domain (Y531, Figure 7, black background). Remarkably, at the furthest C
terminus of the protein, outside the TK domain, Daphnia
Trk has a tyrosine (Y874), which in mammals serves as the
docking site for PLC, whose transduction pathway leads
to initiation and maintenance of long-term potentiation
events[6]. Contrarily to vertebrates, this tyrosine is absent
in invertebrate deuterostomes (Branchiostoma floridae and
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). In this respect, it is noteworthy that out of the two mollusk Trk-like proteins (LTrk
and ApTrkl), which share with Trks some of the intracellular region comprising the tyrosine kinase domain, LTrk
but not ApTrkl has the vertebrate equivalent tyrosine for

could either be ancient and lost in specific lineages, or that
it occurred independently in several lineages. Two questions are important in this respect, and these are whether
LTrk or DaphniaTrk can in fact activate the PLC gamma
pathway and if the tyrosine residue which has been shown
to be absolutely necessary for PLC gamma activation can
do this alone outside a consensus vertebrate sequence
[P(VIS)YLD(IV)L(GE)] in this region of the protein.
Daphnia Trk receptor genomic structure
The theoretically predicted Daphnia Trk (or Dappu-Trk)
transcriptional unit consists of 16 exons which are
depicted in Figure 8. For clarity, Daphnia exons are numbered in Roman characters, while vertebrate and Branchiostoma (amphioxus Trk in Figure 8) exons are numbered
in Arabic numbers. The first five exons in Daphnia Trk
exhibit the same domain arrangement as vertebrate and
amphioxus Trk receptors. The signal peptide and the Nterminal cysteine-rich cluster are coded by the first exon,
while the LRR are spread among exons II, III and IV, leaving the C-terminal cysteine-rich cluster in exon V. Like vertebrate Trk proteins, and in contrast to amphioxus Trk, the
first Ig-like domain of Daphnia Trk is encoded by two
exons (exons VI and VII).

The second IgC2 domain in Daphnia Trk is also encoded
by 2 exons (Daphnia Exon VIII and IX) unlike vertebrate
and amphioxus Trks. Exon IX also spans the extra-juxtamembrane sequence of the receptor and covers what is
part of vertebrate exon 8, 9 and 10. The extracellular juxtamembrane region in amphioxus and vertebrate Trks is
encoded by distinct exons to those bearing the second Ig.
In vertebrates, exons 9 and 10 encode the extracellular
juxta-membrane region, while in amphioxus Trk a single
compact exon encompasses vertebrate exons 9 and 10.
Interestingly, human Trk exon 9 encodes a short amino
acid sequence alternatively spliced in several of the Trk
isoforms described in vertebrate species. The presence or
absence of this short amino acid sequence is tissue specific
and affects ligand preference. Human and rat TrkAI isoforms, which lack six amino acids in this region (encoded
by exon 9), are expressed in non-neuronal tissues and
bind only NGF, while TrkA-II isoforms, which contain the
six amino acid insertion, are localized in neuronal tissues
and can interact with both NGF and NT3 [37]. The
absence of this mini-exon in amphioxus and Daphnia Trks
suggests that Trks may have acquired more ligand flexibility in the lineage leading to the vertebrates. The transmembrane region of the Daphnia Trk protein and the first

The upper part of the diagram shows the different domains of the protein while the three diagrams below show the exon organization relative to these domains in vertebrates, amphioxus (Invertebrate deuterostome) and Daphnia (Protostome).

phosphorylation site for cAMP/cGMP-dependent kinase
proteins, RYS, are encoded by Daphnia exon X. Daphnia
exon X aligns to vertebrate exon 11, with similar intronexon boundaries. Vertebrate exons 12 and 13 align to
Daphnia exon XI which is more compact and spans not
only the tyrosine responsible for Shc recruitment Y533
(covered by exon 12 in vertebrates) but also part of the
tyrosine kinase domain (encoded by vertebrate exon 13).
The breakpoint between exon XI and XII in Daphnia corresponds to the breakpoint between human Trk exon 13
and 14 centrally located in the ATP binding residue K606.
The tyrosine kinase domain and the intracytoplasmic Cterminus are distributed over five exons (Daphnia exons
XII, XIII, XIV, XV and XVI). Daphnia exon XII corresponds
to vertebrate exon 14, while Daphnia exon XIII does not
span as much peptide sequence as vertebrate exon 15 and
does not include the autophosphorylation sequence. This
sequence is present instead in the next Daphnia exon XIV.
The breakpoint between exon XIV and XV corresponds
roughly to the breakpoint between vertebrate exon 16 and
17. In vertebrates, the C-terminal of the tyrosine kinase
domain and the tyrosine responsible for PLC gamma
docking are encoded by one exon (exon17). In Daphnia,
these entities are encoded by two separate exons (exon XV
and XVI). The intron-exon organization of Daphnia Trk,
with more exons than amphioxus Trk, and several intron-

exon boundaries that are conserved with vertebrate Trks,
reopens the question on how the ancestral organization of
the Trk gene looked like.
Daphnia Trk is a deuterostome Trk orthologue
To establish the relationship of Dappu-Trk to deuterostome Trks, phylogenetic trees were generated with ML and
BI. The trees were derived from full length sequences of
Dappu-Trk, Lymnaea Trk and Homo sapiens Trks, as well as
from full length sequences of closely related RTKs like
RORs, NRKs and Aplysia Trkl [38] "see additional file 2".
The phylogenetic analysis (Figure 9A) results in a Trk
group including Dappu-Trk, Lymnaea Trk and the Homo
sapiens Trks (human TrkA, B and C). The node for the Trk
group is supported by high ML bootstrap (100%) and BI
pp values (1) and distinguishes Trks (including DappuTrk) from other RTKs. It is noteworthy that the Lymnaea
Trk clusters within the Trk group, despite differences in its
extracellular part.
Search for other protostomian Trks
The presence of a putative Trk orthologue in Daphnia suggested that Trks could perhaps be found in other protostomes. tBLASTN of genbank, with the Daphnia sequence
did not yield any Trks in flies, but a search on the Capitella
and Lottia genomes gave promising results. The Capitella

Page 15 of 26

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:243

and Lottia genes retrieved from the respective genome
sequences are incomplete and may have errors particularly in the first half of the sequences. This could be due to
missing sequence data and/or assembly problems. For
both Capitella and Lottia, the sequence encoding the signal
peptide and the first Cys cluster expected for Trks is lacking. A rather complete LRR is present at the N terminal of
the Capitella amino acid sequence, while the Lottia
sequence begins at what could be the end of the LRR. Both
Lottia and Capitella sequences present a Cys Cluster after
the LRR followed by a sequence encoding an IgC2
domain, similar to deuterostomes and Daphnia in this
respect, but different from Lymnaea Trk (which is a Mollusk representative like Lottia). Indeed, Lymnaea Trk does
not have an immunoglobulin domain in this region.
What could be remnants of a second IgC2 domain (or an
incorrect IgC2 sequence due to errors) follows the first
IgC2 in Lottia and Capitella. Deletions occur, however, relative to the Daphnia sequence in this region, particularly
in Capitella. The deletions are most important in the
region after the two Asn residues which are known to
interact with neurotrophin ligands in vertebrates. Lymnaea
has an immuglobulin of the C1 type in this equivalent
region. Presently, it is difficult to judge whether the deletions are "true" in evolutionary terms, or if they represent
sequence errors, because in Capitella, the transmembrane
domain which should follow the second Ig is absent and
there are deletions relative to Daphnia in what should be
the extracellular and intracellular regions immediately
surrounding the transmembrane domain. The Lottia Trk
sequence has a recognizable transmembrane domain.
Despite possible errors in the first halves of the Lottia and
Capitella sequences, the sequences encoding the intracellular part of the receptor prior to and within the tyrosine
kinase domains meet the expectation for Trk sequences.
Prior to the tyrosine kinase domain, the the NPxY motif is
present in both Lottia and Capitella sequences. Also, the
tyrosine kinase domains of both Lottia and Capitella have
the typical autophosphorylation sequence [D(V/I)(S/
T)(S/T)DYYR]. At the furthest C-terminus of the proteins,
outside the TK domain, Lottia and Capitella Trks have a
tyrosine equivalent to the mammalian Trk PLC docking
site.
Phylogenetic analysis of Trk receptors in the bilateria
The sequence of the mollusk Lottia Trk appeared to be
more similar to Daphnia and deuterostome Trks in the
encoded extracellular domain, than to Lymnaea Trk,
another molluskan Trk. The Lottia genome was therefore
searched with the Lymnaea Trk as query, to check for the
presence or absence of a Lymnaea Trk type (with an IgC1
in the extracellular domain) in Lottia. The Lymnaea Trk
type could not be found in Lottia. Because of some uncertainties remaining regarding the first respective halves
(encoding N terminal) of the Capitella and Lottia Trk

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/243

sequences, phylogenetic trees were derived from tyrosine
kinase domains only (Figure 9B). The phylogenetic analysis also included closely related RTK tyrosine kinase
sequences (RORs, NRKs and Trkl) as well as the tyrosine
kinase domains of Daphnia and deuterostome (Branchiostoma (amphioxus in Figure 9B), Strongylocentrotus (sea
urchin), Homo (human), Gallus (chicken) and Danio
(zebrafish)) Trks "see additional file 3" (Figure
9B)[12,39,40]. The orthology of Daphnia, Capitella, Lymnaea and Lottia tyrosine kinase domain to deuterostome
Trks is supported by BI and ML. The node supporting the
Trk family within the RTKs has a ML bootstrap value of
90% and a BI pp value of 1. Within the Trk tree, vertebrate
Trks cluster together. Invertebrate Trks do not bear any
closer relationship to any vertebrate Trk A, B or C paralogue. Despite the fact that Lottia and Lymnaea have different extracellular domains, the molluskan Trk tyrosine
kinases cluster together with high support and are closely
related to the Capitella and Daphnia Trks (Figure 9B). The
finding of Trks in some protostomes but not in Drosophila
and Caenorhabditis suggests that Trks are ancient but have
been lost in some lineages. The finding of two IgC2
domains on the extracellular side of Daphnia Trk
(ecdyzosoan) and at least one IgC2 domain (and possibly
traces of another) in Capitella and Lottia (lophotrochozoa)
suggests that a Trk bearing all the characteristics of deuterostome Trks was probably present before the protostome/
deuterostome split.
Daphnia Trkl receptor and a Trkl-related lineage in the protostomes
Before the discovery of the Dappu-Trk, the closest protostomian related Trks were the Lymnaea Trk (which now
appears to be a Trk orthologue) and the Aplysia Trkl. The
search of the Daphnia genome with vertebrate Trks and
Lymnaea Trk yielded the previously described Dappu-Trk
gene. Investigating the Daphnia genome for Aplysia Trkl
sequences however, uncovered a Trkl homologue in Daphnia (Dappu-235827). When Aplysia Trkl was first reported,
it was described as having the tyrosine kinase domain
most similar to vertebrate Trks but less so than Lymnaea
Trk. The precise phylogenetic relationship between Lymnaea Trk and Aplysia Trkl is so far not known, but the existence of a putative Trkl protein in Daphnia led to
hypothesize that Trks and Trkls could form two paralogous families in the protostomes. Despite a strong similarity to Trks in the intracellular region, Trkl bears little
similarity to Trks in the extracellular domain of the receptor. In Aplysia Trkl, the initiating Met is followed by a relatively small ectodomain including the fragment of an
EGF domain. The ectodomain is followed by a single
transmembrane region, a tyrosine kinase domain and a
long C-terminal extension.

The Aplysia Trkl also differs from Trks in that it does not
have a precursor sequence with a signal peptide.

Analysis of the putative Daphnia Trkl (Dappu-Trkl),
revealed the absence of a signal peptide, as in Aplysia Trkl.
The extracellular domain of Dappu-Trkl has an EGF
domain which is followed by a transmembrane domain
and a tyrosine kinase domain on the intracellular side
(Figure 10). The Tyrosine kinase domain includes the
NPxY signaling motif found in Aplysia Trkl and Trks. Like
Aplysia Trkl, Dappu-Trkl has a C terminal extension after
the tyrosine kinase domain, but this extension is shorter.
Phylogenetic trees derived from BI and ML analysis of the
full length sequences (Figure 9A) group Daphnia and Aplysia Trkl together. The Daphnia/Aplysia Trkl node is separate
from a highly supported Trk node (ML bootstrap: 100%
and BI pp: 1) regrouping Homo (human in Figure 9A),
Lymnaea and Daphnia Trks. In the trees with the full length
sequences, the Trkl and Trk family nodes are nonetheless
grouped by a common node (ML bootstrap: 94% and BI
pp: 1) suggesting that Trkls and Trks are more closely
related to each other than to ROR and NRK RTKs. Search
for Trkl RTKs was performed on the Lottia and Capitella
genomes. tBLASTN with Trkls as queries, gave hits for a
fragment encoding a Capitella tyrosine kinase domain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/243

with low e-value, but the sequence was too short to
include the characteristic EGF domain so it was not further analyzed. A full sequence was found on Lottia Scaffold 225, and this sequence is partially supported by an
EST [Genbank: FC759201.1]. tBLASTN searches against
NCBI ESTs helped recover a number of Trkl sequences
from insect arthropods (Apis mellifera (honey bee): [Genbank: XM_001121533.1], Nasonia vitripennis (jewel
wasp): [Genbank: XM_001602328], Acyrthosiphon pisum
(pea aphid): [Genbank: XM_001944304.1]), but not
from flies. All the insect sequences encode a number of
conserved Cys for an EGF domain on the extracellular
side, a transmembrane domain and a tyrosine kinase
domain on the intracellular side. The tyrosine kinase
domains of Trkls, although very similar to Trks, have subtle differences, which separate them from Trks, RORs and
NRKs in ML or BI trees derived from the tyrosine kinase
domain sequences only (Figure 9B). The finding of a Trkl
lineage helps to resolve the so far unclear relationship
between Lymnaea Trk and Aplysia Trkl, whereby these two
proteins represent two closely related families in the protostomes. It was surprising to find Trkl in insects because

Trkls have not been found in flies. Because Daphnia, a
crustacean arthropod, has both Trkl and Trk, Trks and
Trkls are likely to have disappeared along some arthropod
lineages.
The Daphnia ROR and NRK receptors and their protostome
homologues
Daphnia and protostome RORs
All previous analyses in this work were mostly aimed at
showing that Trk orthologues are present in some protostome representatives. For this, RORs and NRKs were used
as references in the phylogenetic analyses. Indeed, a part
from Trkl, these RTKs have tyrosine kinase sequences closest related to Trks. In Drosophila, Trk and Trkl receptors
have not been found, but ROR plays a neurotrophic role.
Hanks classification of the membrane spanning protein
tyrosine kinases regroups Trk and ROR receptors in a single class, since among all the different protein tyrosine
kinases their respective tyrosine kinases are most similar
to each other than to any other protein tyrosine
kinase[22]. To define the relationship of Daphnia Trk and
Trkls relative to ROR proteins, a putative ROR protein was
sought in the Daphnia genome. One gene prediction on
scaffold 128 (Dappu-203169) appeared as a good ROR
candidate and was named Dappu-ROR (Figure 11). RORs
are characterized by an N terminal Cys rich region followed by a kringle domain in their extracellular part.
Aside from this, the extracellular part is quite variable
depending on the species. For example, Drosophila ROR
has an additional Cys rich region prior the conserved Cys
rich region and kringle domain, while Strongylocentrotus
and Homo RORs (depicted as sea urchin and human ROR
in Figure 12) have one to two N terminal IgC2s prior to
the conserved Cys rich region and Kringle domain (Figure
12). In the extracellular part of the Daphnia ROR, one Nterminal IgGC2 precedes the canonical Cys rich region
and Kringle domain, similar to human ROR. The protein
has a transmembrane domain followed on the C terminal
side by a tyrosine kinase class II domain. The latter tyrosine kinase domain contains the characteristic YXXDYY
phosphorylation site as well as potential SH2 binding
sites (Figure 11). The full length Dappu-ROR was aligned
to full length sequences of other RORs as well as Trks,
Trkls and NRKs. Phylogenetic trees were derived from the
alignment by BI and ML. In the trees with BI analysis,
RORs form a distinct protein family (BI pp 1) (Figure 9A)
but the unity of this family is not as well supported by ML,
which nevertheless places individual ROR representatives
outside the other families formed by Trk, Trkl, and NRK
(not shown). RORs were also sought in protostomes that
had been previously shown to have a Trk, or Trkl. For
Capitella and Lottia, a genome search against gene models
retrieved two predicted ROR gene candidates (Lottia:
jgi|Lotgi1|128683|e_gw1.62.3.1;
Capitella:
jgi|Capca1|52072|gw1.14.82.1). tBLASTN searches on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/243

the NCBI database also uncovered putative RORs for
arthropods: Acyrthosiphon (pea aphid) [Genbank:
(honey bee) [GenBank:
XM_001948569], Apis
XM_397058] and Nasonia (jewel wasp) ROR [Genbank:
XM_001601258]. The Capitella, Lottia, Acyrthosiphon and
Apis ROR sequences encode the same extracellular
arrangement as Daphnia and human RORs (ie One IgC2
followed by a Kringle domain). The Nasonia ROR has no
Ig domains in the extracellular part, but just a Kringle
domain as in Drosophila ROR. In trees compiled with the
sequence portions encoding the tyrosine kinase domains
only, BI strongly supports RORs forming a single family of
proteins paralogous to Trks, Trkls and NRKs (Figure 9B).
Daphnia and protostome NRKs
NRKs are so far not very well described outside flies, and
have not been reported in deuterostomes. Drosophila NRK
(Dnrk) has an extracellular organization reminiscent of
RORs, yet a tyrosine kinase domain more closely related
to Trks than ROR[38]. Dnrk is expressed specifically in the
developing nervous system during embryogenesis. Daphnia also has an NRK called YasNRK which is described
elsewhere (Yasuhiro Shiga)[41]. Like RORs, NRKs were
used as references, to investigate protostome Trks. Following the same approach as with RORs, NRKs were sought
for the protostomes that were shown to have a Trk or Trkl
protein sequence. NRKs have a cys rich region followed by
a Kringle domain in their extracellular part. After the
transmembrane domain, the intracellular tyrosine kinase
domain of the Drosophila NRK has the particularity of having two tandemly repeated putative ATP-binding sites
which are reminiscent of Dtrk, another Drosophila RTK. A
number of putative NRK sequences were retrieved from
the NCBI nucleotide database, including those of Apis
(honey bee) [Genbank: XM_391863], Nasonia (jewel
wasp) [Genbank: XM_001601666] and Acyrthosiphon (pea
aphid) [Genbank: XM_001942924.1]. A putative Lottia
NRK was found in the Lottia genome assembly (Scaffold
53),
while
a
putative
Capitella
NRK
(jgi|Capca1|161686|estExt_Genewise1.C_10213)
was
retrieved from searching gene predictions in the Capitella
genome. Insect (Apis, Acyrthosiphon, Nasonia) sequences
encoded an extracellular region with the same organization as the insect Drosophila. Daphnia has an immunoglobulin preceding the kringle domain on the N
terminal. In Lottia and Capitella, the N terminal consists of
an IgC2, followed by an Ig and the consensus Kringle
domain (Figure 12). Instead of having two ATP consensus
sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, all the newly found
sequences (including Daphnia) had only the second ATP
site equivalent, and this site had a very conserved
sequence "GQGAFG". In phylogenetic trees (Figure 9)
derived from either full length or tyrosine kinase
sequences, NRKs form a family of proteins. The node supporting this family has an ML bootstrap value of 100%

an ML bootstrap value of 96% and a BI pp of 1 for tyrosine

far in deuterostomes.
Evolution of Trk and Trk-related RTKs in the bilateria
The finding of Trk orthologues in the protostomes suggests that a Trk protein was already present at the protostome/deuterostome split. The absence of a Trk in
Drosophila has been attributed to a lesser need for plasticity of the insect nervous system[42]. This may not be the
case for all arthropods as reflected by the Daphnia Trk. The
additional finding of a Trkl family of protein in the protostomes, which is very closely related to Trks, suggest that
protostomes have a complex array of Trk related proteins,
including NRKs, which are not found in deuterostomes.

P75NTR genes in the protostomes and evolution in the
bilateria
p75NTR in Daphnia and other protostomes
The finding of a neurotrophin and Trk receptor in Daphnia
prompted to ask whether a p75NTR could be present in
this species. Despite being a neurotrophin receptor,
p75NTR does not belong, as do Trk receptors, to the RTKs.
Instead p75NTR is a member of the TNFRSF. TNFRSF
members have one to four repeats of cysteine-rich
domains (called CRD) in their extracellular domain.
Except for the Cys residues, the CRDs show very low
sequence conservation between the various TNFRSF. The
cytoplasmic regions of the receptors show considerably
more diversity in sequence and size than the extracellular
regions. There are no common intracellular motifs found
in all members of the TNFR superfamily except for some
domains such as the TRAF2-binding domain, which is
required for both NF-κB activation and JNK activation, or
a domain of ~ 80 amino acids called the "death domain"

for caspase activation. To date, no TNFR proteins (including p75NTR) have been found in protostomes, except for
the Drosophila TNFR Wengen[28]. Wengen lacks a so
called "death-domain" in its protein intracellular part,
which is present in p75NTR orthologues and in less than
one third of vertebrate TNFRs. Because the majority of vertebrate TNFRs do not have a death domain and because
Wengen has so far been the only known protostome
TNFSFR, it has been suggested that the ancestral configuration of TNFRS could have been "death-domain
less"[27]. tBLASTN searches on the Daphnia genome
sequence with Strongylocentrotus Sp-p75NTR as a query,
resulted in two hits. The first was a Daphnia sequence on
scaffold 9 (Dappu-98375) with a short part of the
sequence encoding some of the CRDs but the rest of the
sequence encoding no recognizable transmembrane or

intracellular domain. The second hit however, was a
Daphnia sequence with high similarity to p75NTRs. The
p75NTR Daphnia gene (Dappu-313202), which was
named Dappu-p75NTR is on Scaffold 8 (Dappu V1.1
draft genome assembly/scaffold_8:1094314-1104821),
and has many of the features of p75NTR as shown in an
alignment of Daphnia-p75NTR to p75NTR sequences
from Xenopus (frog) and Homo (human), as well as frog
NRH1, a vertebrate paralogue of p75NTR (Figure 13). The
alignment reveals that Dappu-p75NTR has only three
CRDs in its extracellular part, instead of four CRDs commonly found in deuterostomes. Moreover the three CRDs
are theoretically encoded by a single exon, suggesting that
if differential splicing of the gene should occur, it should
not affect the number of CRDs. In this respect, Dappup75NTR differs from some vertebrate p75NTRs, such as

mouse and human in Figure 13), where the extracellular
domain of p75NTR consists of four CRDs that are not
encoded by a single exon. In these vertebrates, the N terminal CRD is encoded by exon 2, while the three consecutive CRDs are encoded by exon 3. p75NTRs of Gallus,
Mus and Homo can be differentially spliced and the full
length p75NTR (FL-p75NTR) can be co-expressed with a
shorter p75NTR (s-p75NTR) lacking exon 3, whereby
missing three of the four CRDs[43]. The function of sp75NTR is not well understood. Despite the difference in
genomic organization and number of CRDs, Daphnia
p75NTR has most of the characteristics of a vertebrate
p75NTR, including a transmembrane domain with high
similarity to the deuterostome p75NTRs. Moreover Daphnia p75NTR has a death domain in the intracellular part,
which is absent in Drosophila Wengen [28]. The search for
p75NTR was extended to other protostomes and a
p75NTR was found in Capitella genome gene predictions
(jgi|Capca1|227322|estExt_fgenesh1_pg.C_1670017).
The genome sequence was supported by several ESTs
([Genbank: EY550456.1], [Genbank: EY616051.1], [Genbank: EY616050.1], [Genbank:EY550457.1]). Searching
gene predictions in Lottia also uncovered a p75NTR
(jgi|Lotgi1|172616|fgenesh2_pg.C_sca_137000030) and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/243

several ESTs also supported the genomic sequence ([GenBank:FC767772.1],
[GenBank:FC644258.1],
[Gen[GenBank:FC577631.1],
Bank:FC591712.1],
[GenBank:FC639457.1], [GenBank:FC573898.1]). The
Capitella p75NTR is missing parts of the first N terminal
CRD. The Lottia p75NTR has four CRDs and is very conserved relative to the vertebrates. The finding of p75NTR
concomitantly with a Trk and a neurotrophin in representative species of the ecdysozoa and lophotrochozoa
within the protostomes, as well as their existence in the
deuterostomes suggests that all ligand receptor components for neurotrophin signaling were present before the
protostomes and deuterostomes diverged.
Evolution of p75NTR in the bilateria
The finding in several protostome representatives of
p75NTR, a TNFRSF member endowed with a death
domain suggests that death domain TNFRSF could have
appeared early in evolution.

While p75NTR was the first TNFRSF member to be discovered, and its sequence characterized the TNFRSF CRDs,
the phylogenetic relationship of p75NTR to other TNFRSF
is not well understood. p75NTR has several features that
distinguish it from other members of the TNFRSF. While

TNFRSF proteins bind to tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) ligands, p75NTR binds to neurotrophins
which are structurally unrelated to TNFSF proteins. In vertebrates, over 20 TNFRSF members have been identified,
most of which function in the immune system. The multiplicity of TNFRSF representatives has been suggested to
arise from multiple rounds of duplications in concert with
the appearance of adaptive immunity in evolution[27].
Aside from functioning in the immune system, p75NTR
has a role in ectodermal development and this function is
shared by few TNFRSF members such as Troy, and the
EDA receptors (EDAR and XEDAR). Sequence alignment
indicates that Troy, EDAR and XEDAR fall within a subfamily of structurally similar TNFSF proteins. Although
p75NTR does not have greater overall sequence similarity
to Troy than to other TNFRSF proteins, p75NTR and Troy
have been shown to share a very similar transmembrane
domain. Compared to vertebrates, a small fraction of
TNFRSF members were identified in invertebrate deuterostomes, such as Strongylocentrotus and Saccoglossus.
Among these, p75NTR, p75NTR-like and Troy sequences
were present, suggesting that the duplication separating
the p75NTR gene lineage from the Troy/XEDAR/EDAR
lineage had already taken place at the root of the deuterostomes[10]. Although the ligand for Troy is unknown,
XEDAR and EDAR are known in vertebrates to bind to two
different isoforms of EDA, a protein with typical features
of the TNFSFs. This may suggest that within the TNFRSF,
neurotrophin binding receptors (p75NTR) diverged from
portential TNFSF binding receptors at least at the stem of
the deuterostome lineage, if not earlier. Prior to the current finding of p75NTRs in protostomes, the only TNFR
representative known in protostomes was Drosophila Wengen[28]. Wengen has some degree of similarity to p75NTR
but also similarity to TNFR1 and XEDAR, which are receptors for TNFSF members. A ligand for Wengen, called
Eiger has been reported, and Eiger is most similar to EDA,
which is the XEDAR ligand. Eiger is clearly a TNFSF member and is not related to neurotrophins. tBLASTN searches
against gene predictions on the Daphnia genome sequence
with Drosophila Wengen as query, yields a hit with a relatively high e-value (0.044) to a gene prediction on scaffold 4 (Dappu-305473). The genomic sequence is
supported by several ESTs ([Genbank: FE377316.1],
[Genbank: FE348619.1]) and it encodes a TNFR domain
protein which like Wengen lacks a death domain. In addition to this gene, partial ESTs in Daphnia present high similarity to the Eiger/EDA gene ([Genbank: FE337796.1],
[Genbank: FE355401.1]) and encode a TNF domain. The
ESTs are represented in the genomic sequence on scaffold
9. Although the evolution of the TNFRSF is beyond the
scope of the present study, these preliminary results may
suggest that Wengen and p75NTR are paralogues. Since
Wengen binds to a TNFSF member, future research will be
needed to investigate whether protostomian p75NTRs can

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/243

indeed bind to protostome neurotrophins. If so, this may
indicate that the prerequisites for separate evolution of
TNFRSF binding to neurotrophins and TNFRSF binding to
TNFSF members were already established before the protostome/deuterostome split.

Conclusion
In this work, the genome sequence of Daphnia pulex[41]
provides the first evidence for components of the neurotrophin/Trk/p75NTR signaling system in a protostome.
Also, for the first time, Daphnia represents an organism
where the genome encodes both Spz proteins and a neurotrophin, thus allowing a clarification of the relationship
between neurotrophin and Spz proteins as paralogous
families. Two new Spz protein families (Spz7 and Spz8)
are moreover described, and representatives of these families are found in other crustaceans. Spz7 and Spz8 proteins are represented in Daphnia by 14 or more
representatives, suggesting that the genes encoding these
proteins could be under selective pressure. The Daphnia
genome also reveals the most conserved Trk relative to the
deuterostomes found so far in a protostome. The Daphnia
Trk is found along side a Daphnia Trkl which is orthologous to Aplysia Trkl. The search of other genomes and ESTs
derived from several protostome species reveals moreover
that Trk and Trkl form closely related paralogous families
in the protostomes within a "Trk/Trkl family" that is paralogous to NRKs. This highlights a previously unsuspected
complexity in Trk and Trk related receptors in protostomes. For the first time, the Daphnia genome presents a
protostome p75NTR receptor and the p75NTR is subsequently shown to exist in other protostomes. Thus the
neurotrophin signaling ligand and receptors were probably already present before the protostome/deuterostome
split. The finding in protostomes of p75NTR, which is a
TNFRSF member endowed with a death domain, reopens
the question as to whether the TNFRSF ancestral configuration was "death domain less" as previously suggested[27]. It will be interesting to see whether a
protostomian p75NTR functions in the immune system,
the nervous system or both. Moreover, because Wengen,
the other known protostomian TNFRSF member binds to
a TNFSF ligand, it will be interesting to find out if and how
protostomian p75NTRs bind to neurotrophins. Also, in
contrast to Trks which bind neurotrophins with high
selectivity, p75NTR binds indiscriminately to neurotrophins, so future work may reveal whether p75NTR
binds to Spzs. The presence of the neurotrophin/Trk/
p75NTR signaling system in Daphnia highlights the
importance of Daphnia for phylogenetic studies, but also
as a medical model, since neurotrophins, Trk receptors
and p75NTR are involved in the nervous system, the
immune system, and in various diseases[44] ranging from
Alzheimers[45] to cancer[46,47], including parasite infection[48].

Methods
Search for new genes
tBLASTN searches[49] were done against NCBI database
ESTs http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and also against the
Daphnia pulex, Lottia gigantea, Helobdella robusta and
Capitella Sp. I genome data made available from US
Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute http://
www.jgi.doe.gov/Daphnia[50]. Information available on
wFleaBase http://wFleaBase.org was also used. Searches
on the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) website were done
against all gene prediction models, and gene predictions
from different software were aligned to each other as well
as to EST sequences when available, to select the best prediction. When the models appeared incorrect based on
knowledge of related sequences from the same gene family or superfamily, tBLASTN searches were done directly
on the scaffold sequences. The genome browser from the
JGI website was used to view the position of identical
sequence duplicates on a given scaffold or different scaffolds. Additional analyses of the genes predicted, such as
the presence of signature sequences in the translated
polypeptide, were sought with prosite http://
www.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/. Domain architecture
comparisons were generated by SMART http://
smart.embl-heidelberg.de/. Potential signal peptidase
cleavage sites on translated gene sequences were mapped
with SignalP 3.0 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/
[51] and prediction of arginine and lysine propeptide
cleavage sites was performed using ProP 1.0 http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ProP/[52].
Alignment and Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences to be used in phylogenetic analysis
were translated to amino acid sequences and the amino
acid sequences were aligned with MUSCLE[53]. The
nucleotide sequences were subsequently aligned by
RevTrans[54], using the MUSCLE amino acid alignment
as a template. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with
two different methods, maximum likelihood (ML) and
Bayesian inference (BI). ML tree estimation was done
using RaxML-VI v.7.0.0[55,56]. BI analyses were performed using MrBayes 3.1.2 [57,58]. Gaps and N's were
treated as missing data.

The ML analysis consisted of 100 independent runs on the
original alignment using RAxML under the GTRMIX substitution model (re-estimated all free model parameters)
with estimated rearrangement settings, a rate category
value of 25 and randomized MP (maximum parsimony)
starting trees. This model implies an initial tree inference
under the GTRCAT model and thereafter evaluates the
final tree topology under the GTRGAMMA model until
the likelihood values are stable. Branch support was
assessed with 1000 non-parametric bootstrap replicates
under the GTRMIX model (random number seed =

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/243

180874) and plotted on the ML tree with the best likelihood value. For the BI analyses, MrModeltest v.2 [59] was
used for search of best fit models for each codon position;
In the RTK tree based on full length sequences (Figure 9A)
positions 1 and 2 followed the (GTR+I+G) while position
3 followed the (HKY+I+G) of the Akaike information criterion (AIC). In the RTK tree based on sequences encoding
the tyrosine kinase domains only (Figure 9B), positions 1
to 3 followed the (GTR+I+G) model. In the Neurotrophin/Spz tree (with Spz6 included), position 1 and 2
followed the (GTR+I+G) model while position 3 followed
(GTR+G) (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The BI analyses consisted of four million generations in two parallel chains
executed in three separate runs. The seed number was
180874. The first 2500 trees were discarded as "burn in".
