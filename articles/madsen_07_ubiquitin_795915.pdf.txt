Abstract
The human genome encodes several ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain proteins (UDPs). Members of this
protein family are involved in a variety of cellular functions and many are connected to the ubiquitin
proteasome system, an essential pathway for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. Despite their
structural similarity, the UBL domains appear to have a range of different targets, resulting in a
considerable diversity with respect to UDP function. Here, we give a short summary of the
biochemical and physiological roles of the UDPs, which have been linked to human diseases
including neurodegeneration and cancer.

Introduction
Ubiquitin is a small and phylogenetically conserved
eukaryotic protein known to covalently modify proteins
and thereby mark them for destruction by the 26S proteasome [1]. This process, termed ubiquitylation, is also
involved in the regulation of many other cellular processes including endocytosis and transcription [1].
Ubiquitin ligation is accomplished in multiple steps [2],
the first of which involves ATP-dependent activation of
ubiquitin by a ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1). Second,
the activated ubiquitin is transferred to a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2). A ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) then
associates with both the ubiquitin-charged E2 and the
substrate, facilitating the formation of an isopeptide bond
between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and an amino group
(typically a lysine residue) either directly on the target
protein or on the last ubiquitin moiety of an attached

polyubiquitin chain [2]. Several such rounds of conjugation yield substrates carrying chains of ubiquitin moieties,
which may be elongated further by the action of a ubiquitin chain elongation factor (E4) [3]. Combinations of E2
and E3 enzymes (of which there are hundreds encoded in
the human genome) primarily provide the substrate specificity of the ubiquitylation system [2].
The formation of polyubiquitin chains is a reversible
process and several deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs)
play important roles in trimming the chains on target proteins [4].
Different ubiquitin lysine residues are used in the formation of polyubiquitin chains, with various outcomes. For
example, whereas Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains target proteins for degradation by the 2.5 MDa 26S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner [5], linking through

Lys63 plays a role in NFκB-signalling and the formation
of Lewy bodies in patients with Parkinson's disease [6-8].
Modification of proteins with a single ubiquitin moiety
(monoubiquitylation) also plays an important role,
namely in endocytosis and transcription [9].
Ubiquitin is a stable and compact protein consisting of
two α-helices and five β-strands arranged in the order
ββαββαβ to form the ubiquitin superfold [10]. Recently,
several ubiquitin-like proteins have been identified,
which despite a relatively low sequence similarity, all display the ubiquitin superfold [11]. These proteins are generally divided into two groups: ubiquitin-like modifiers
(UBLs) and ubiquitin-like domain proteins (UDPs) [12].
In addition to ubiquitin itself, the group of UBLs can
become covalently attached to substrate proteins in a similar manner to ubiquitylation, and includes proteins such
as NEDD8, SUMO, FAT10 and others. Despite their similarities, the assorted UBLs are implicated in different cellular functions [12]. However, we shall not discuss them
further here, but instead focus on the group of UDPs.
The UDPs are responsible for recruitment of ubiquitylated
substrates to the proteasome [13] and bind to the 26S proteasome in a UBL-dependent manner [14]. Hence, it was
thought that the UBL domain is a general proteasome
binding domain. However, recently it was demonstrated
that some UDPs do not interact with the proteasome [15].
Thus, despite their structural similarities to each other and
ubiquitin, UDPs display striking differences on the functional level. Here we give a brief overview of a selection of
UDPs involved in human diseases.

UBL/UBA domain proteins
UDPs that contain one or more ubiquitin binding UBA
(ubiquitin-associated) domain (figure 1) in addition to a
UBL domain are called UBL/UBA domain proteins. The
yeast proteins Rad23 and Dsk2 are the best characterized
members of this group.
Precipitation experiments have shown that the UBL
domain of both Rad23 and its human homologue
(HHR23) interacts directly with the 26S proteasome in
vitro[14], while the UBA domain interacts with ubiquitin
[13]. UBL/UBA domain proteins were therefore proposed
to function as substrate shuttles, transporting ubiquitylated proteins in the cytosol from E3 enzymes to the 26S
proteasome [16]. This shuttle model was recently confirmed in vitro by biochemical experiments, which showed
that UBL/UBA proteins are essential for degradation of a
proteasome substrate [17]. Since most proteasome substrates, including cell cycle regulators, oncogenes and
tumour suppressor proteins [1], are probably directed to
the proteasome via the UBL/UBA proteins, drugs targeting
these proteins may prove useful in treating cancer.
Despite the fact that none of the UBL/UBA proteins are
essential in yeast, combined loss of Rad23, Dsk2 and the
proteasome's ubiquitin receptor Rpn10/S5a results in
mitotic arrest [13]. This indicates that though UBL/UBA
proteins are redundant and have overlapping substrate
specificity, some seem to be relatively specific for certain
target proteins. This has already been shown by pulsechase experiments for certain cell cycle-related proteins,
such as Sic1 and Cln2 [17]. Therefore, specific rather than
general targeting of UBL/UBA proteins could be a more
effective approach in cancer therapy.

In precipitation experiments the UDPs Rad23, Dsk2 and
their human orthologues HHR23 and ubiquilin-1 interact
with the 26S proteasome in a UBL domain-dependent
manner [13,18,19]. However, within the 26S proteasome,
the UDPs appear to have distinct binding preferences. For
example, yeast Rad23 and Dsk2 interact with the proteasome subunit Rpn1/S2 [20,21], whereas human HHR23
interacts with the second ubiquitin interaction motif
(UIM) of human Rpn10/S5a [18], which is not present in
yeast Rpn10/S5a [21].
Both Ufd2 (an E4) and the 26S proteasome associate with
the Rad23 UBL domain in a mutually exclusive manner in
vitro[22]. One might therefore speculate that Rad23 associates with Ufd2, possibly inhibiting its E4 activity, while
binding the ubiquitylated substrate via the UBA domains.
Eventually, Rad23 will dissociate from Ufd2 and dock at
the 26S proteasome, thus delivering the ubiquitylated
cargo [23].
In addition to the 26S proteasome and ubiquitylated substrate, HHR23 also interacts with ataxin-3 in vitro, a protein
involved
in
the
development
of
the
neurodegenerative Machado-Joseph disease [24]. Similar
to deubiquitylating enzymes, ataxin-3 contains ubiquitin
interaction motifs (UIMs) and a protease domain. Surprisingly, the HHR23 UBL domain was found to interact
with the protease domain of ataxin-3 rather than with one
of the UIMs [24,25]. Since ataxin-3 also associates with
both the proteasome and polyubiquitin chains, it may
recruit ubiquitylated substrates to the proteasome [26].
However, ataxin-3 is also a substrate of the E4 enzyme
Ufd2 [27] and perhaps of HHR23 [22,23]. Therefore, further studies are necessary to understand the physiological
background of the ataxin-3–HHR23 interaction.

UBL/UBA domain proteins in disease
Alzheimer's disease
Ubiquilins 1–4 are human homologues of yeast Dsk2.
Ubiquilin-1 and ubiquilin-2 both bind the proteasome
[19] and, interestingly, have both been linked to Alzheimer's disease, since they were proposed to bind presenilins and localize to Lewy bodies and neurofibrillar tangles
[28]. Moreover, genetic variations in the ubiquilin-1 gene
are proposed to substantially increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease [29]. The generation of the C-terminus of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is dependent on
presenilins. Mutations in presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 lead
to an increased ratio of β-APP42 to β-APP40 (also known
as Aβ42 and Aβ40) from amyloid β-precursor protein
[30]. Accumulation of these Aβ peptides outside the cell
leads to amyloid plaques, a major lesion in Alzheimer's
disease [31]. The presenilin–ubiquilin interaction was
mapped to the C-terminal UBA domain of ubiquilin-1
[28]. However, in these studies, in which ubiquilin fusion

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/S1/S1

proteins were used to precipitate in vitro translated presenilins, SDS-PAGE of the precipitates revealed a slowly
migrating smear. It is therefore likely that only ubiquitylated presenilins can interact with ubiquilin-1. It is also
possible that ubiquilin-1 only interacts with ubiquitylated
γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors [32].
In order to efficiently transmit synaptic signals, the
amount of GABAA receptor at inhibitory synapses is
tightly regulated [32,33]. This is maintained by the internalization of the receptor at clathrin-coated pits [34].
Ubiquilin-1 binds GABAA receptors and facilitates their
membrane insertion by increasing the stability of the
intracellular pool [32]. Based on these data, it is feasible
that the UDP only interacts with ubiquitylated GABAA
receptors. As proteasomal degradation of the receptors
was not observed, ubiquilin-1 may therefore also function
in endocytosis [32]. Accordingly, it has been reported that
ubiquilin-1 interacts with Eps15, an essential component
of the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway [35]. Eps15
contains two UIMs, and ubiquilin-1 binds to the one that
is closer to the N-terminus. Besides Eps15, other UIMcontaining proteins linked to the endocytic pathway also
bind the UBL domain of ubiquilin-1 [35]. Although these
proteins co-localize with ubiquilin-1, they were not found
in endocytic compartments, but in cytoplasmic aggregates
or aggresomes. Thus, ubiquilin-1 may be involved in the
sequestration of certain UIM-containing endocytic proteins to ubiquitin-rich aggregates [35]. This is consistent
with the finding that ubiquilin-1 and ubiquilin-2 localize
to ubiquitin-positive structures and are both present in
aggresomes [36]. It is possible that ubiquilin-1 targets
aggregated, ubiquitylated proteins as well as UIM-containing endocytic proteins to aggresomes. This hypothesis
was recently strengthened by knockdown and overexpression studies that revealed a possible dual function of the
ubiquilin-1 UBL domain [37]. These studies suggest that
under low levels of polyglutamine protein aggregation,
ubiquilin-1 shuttles ubiquitylated proteins to the proteasome, while under higher levels of protein aggregation, the
proteasome may become overloaded and alternative functions of the ubiquilin UBL domain enhanced, for example, interaction with Eps15 to promote trafficking of
protein aggregates to the aggresomes (figure 2) [37]. Once
the aggregated proteins reach the aggresome, their toxicity
is reduced by their efficient autophagic removal [38].
Spinocerebellar ataxia
Ubiquilin-4 is linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 1
(SCA1) [39], an inherited neurodegenerative disease,
which primarily affects the brainstem, spinocerebellar
tracts and cerebellar Purkinje cells. The disease is caused
by an expansion of a polyglutamine stretch within the
SCA1 protein, ataxin-1. Similar to other UBL/UBA proteins, ubiquilin-4 binds the proteasome subunit Rpn10/

The role of ubiquilin in protein degradation in mammalian cells
The role of ubiquilin in protein degradation in mammalian cells. Under normal conditions, when only low amounts of
protein aggregates are present in cells (a), ubiquilin shuttles ubiquitylated proteins to the 26S proteasome via a UBL-dependent
interaction with the Rpn10/S5a UIM domain. When cells contain larger amounts of aggregated protein (b), the proteasome
becomes overloaded, leaving the ubiquilin UBL domain to interact with other cellular UIM proteins. These include Eps15,
which instead promotes transport of aggregation-prone proteins to the aggresome. The figure is based on the model of Heir et
al.[37].

S5a via its UBL domain and polyubiquitin chains via its
UBA domain [39,40].
Juvenile Parkinsonism
Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) is an
early onset and slowly progressing disease, the most common cause for which is mutations in the PARK2 gene
encoding PRKN2 (also known as parkin) [41-43]. PRKN2
contains a UBL domain and two E3-type RING-finger
motifs (figure 1), and localises to the cytoplasm and centrosome/aggresome [44]. Accordingly, it was shown that
PRKN2 is a functional E3 and that pathological mutations
in PARK2 impair its catalytic activity [45-47]. Several
PRKN2 substrates have been identified, including the synaptic vesicle-associated GTPase CD-Crel-1, Cyclin-E, the
α-synuclein-interacting protein synphilin, PaelRl and glycosylated α-synuclein [46,48-51]. Thus, loss of PRKN2
may result in the accumulation of its substrates, leading to
the death of dopaminergic neurons. Supporting evidence
comes from experiments in which over-expression of the
PRKN2 substrate PAELR1 led to cell death in neuroblastoma cells, an effect which could be rescued by wild-type
but not mutant PRKN2. [49]. Moreover, glycosylated αsynuclein was found to accumulate in the brain of
PRKN2-deficient AR-JP patients [50].

Although most of the pathogenic missense mutations
cluster to the RING domain-containing C-terminus of
PRKN2, a few mutations have also been identified in the
UBL region. NMR interaction studies have identified an
interaction between the PRKN2 UBL domain and the proteasome subunit Rpn10/S5a, an observation not made
with the pathogenic PRKN2 mutant R42P [52]. However,
since in vitro precipitation assays failed to confirm the
interaction [52], its significance is questionable. More
recent evidence lends support to these doubts, since it was
shown by immunoblotting that PRKN2 catalyses Lys63linked ubiquitylation of synphilin-1 in vivo[53]. Though
Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains can support proteasomal degradation [54,55], this type of modification is also
associated with endocytosis [56], indicating that perhaps
PRKN2 exhibits proteasome-independent functions.
Additionally, precipitation experiments demonstrated
that PRKN2 binds Eps15 in a UBL domain-dependent
manner [57]. Upon treating fibroblasts with epidermal
growth factor (EGF), PRKN2 mediates ubiquitylation of
Eps15 and thereby delays internalization of the EGFreceptor (EGFR). In PRKN2-deficient cells, however,
endocytosis of EGFR is accelerated. Since EGFR stimulates
neuronal survival via Akt pathway signalling, its accelerated endocytosis in mutant cells may lead to inefficient
Akt signalling and reduced neuronal survival, resulting in
AR-JP [57].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/S1/S1

PRKN2 can also be destabilized by pathogenic mutations
within its UBL domain [58]. However, a truncated version
of PRKN2, without the UBL domain, was dramatically stabilised when compared with full-length PRKN2. The first
six residues of the UBL domain were found to be responsible for destabilizing PRKN2 [59]. Thus, the PRKN2 UBL
domain harbours a destabilization signal responsible for
its rapid turnover. Interestingly, there is a truncated
PRKN2 isoform in humans, synthesized from an internal
start codon, which lacks the UBL domain. The functional
significance of this PRKN2 isoform and its stability is still
unclear.
Von Hippel-Lindau disease
Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant cancer, which manifests as angiomas of the retina,
hemangioblastomas of the CNS and renal clear cell carcinomas [60]. Patients with VHL disease harbour a germ
line mutation in one allele of the tumour suppressor gene
encoding the nuclear and cytoplasmic VHL protein [60].
VHL is the substrate binding component of the multisubunit E3 CBCVHL (Cullin–Elongin-BC–VHL) [61]. In addition to VHL, the E3 complex contains the structural
component Cullin-2, the catalytic subunit RBX1 (ROC1)
and Elongin-B and -C [61].

CBCVHL catalyses the ubiquitylation of hypoxia-inducible
transcription factor α (HIFα and several other substrates
[62,63]. Under normoxic conditions, HIFα is ubiquitylated by the CBCVHL complex, leading to low levels of
HIFα and therefore moderate expression of HIFα target
genes [61]. Inactivation of VHL causes accumulation of
HIFα, leading to increased transcription of HIFα target
genes, most of which are angiogenic factors. This in turn
causes extensive proliferation of capillaries, a crucial step
in tumour development in VHL disease [61].
Elongin-B and -C are also found in other CBCs, where
they either link other VHL-box proteins and Cullin-2, or
SOCS-box proteins and Cullin-5 [64]. Additional functions of Elongin-B, besides its role as adapter component
of CBCs, are yet to be documented, as are the functions of
its UBL domain (figure 1).

UDP disease models
Yeast has proved to be an excellent model system for the
study of the UBL/UBA proteins. However, developing
transgenic mouse models will further reveal important
functional aspects of their molecular functions. A knockout is already available in Rad23b (Mhr23b), the murine
orthologue of RAD23B (HHR23B) [65], which displays
impaired embryonic development and a high rate of neonatal death. In surviving animals, a variety of abnormalities are observed, including retarded growth, facial
dysmorphology and male sterility [65].

To date, two Park2 knockout mouse models have been
reported [66,67], both of which are viable and fertile. The
morphology and viability of dopaminergic neurons in
both strains was also unaltered, even in aged animals,
though behavioural abnormalities including a reduced
exploratory behaviour were observed. Moreover, the
mouse mutant model Quaking has been reported as a
spontaneous Park2 knockout, which additionally lacks
the PRKN2 co-regulated gene Pacrg[68]. Homozygote
quaking mutants are characterised by dysmyelination in
the CNS, resulting in phenotypes including movement
disorders, tremors and seizures [68].
In Drosophila, the loss of park (homologue of PARK2)
results in reduced cell size and number, infertility,
reduced lifespan, movement and flying disorders, and
increased sensitivity to oxidative stress [69]. However,
even as adults, these park mutant flies do not display agedependent neuron loss in the brain.
Collectively, the mouse and Drosophila PRKN2 models
will serve as an invaluable tool for understanding the biological role of PRKN2 and may provide important clues to
the molecular mechanisms of Parkinson's disease.

UDPs as drug targets
Inhibitors of the 26S proteasome, such as bortezomib, are
successfully being used in the treatment of certain cancers
[70]. However, drug targeting of UDPs certainly has several potential advantages over the use of proteasome
inhibitors since such drugs would likely be more specific.
Devising efficient inhibitors for non-enzymatic proteins
such as the UBL/UBA proteins is more difficult than for
proteins with enzyme activity, which can be assayed in
high-throughput screens. Nonetheless, recent chemical
genetic screens in Xenopus extracts performed by Verma et
al. at Caltech have identified a group of relatively small
molecules, called ubistatins, which inhibit the turnover of
cyclin-B and the cdk-inhibitor Sic1 in vitro by inhibiting
the binding of ubiquitylated proteins to substrate shuttles
[71]. Accordingly, biochemical assays revealed that the
ubiquitin-independent degradation of the proteasome
substrate ornithine decarboxylase is not affected by
ubistatins indicating that ubistatins may provide a more
specific alternative to proteasome inhibitors in cancer
treatment. A much more detailed knowledge of the specificity of UBL/UBA proteins and other proteasome co-factors will be necessary before development of drugs
targeting UBL/UBA proteins can occur and thus alleviate
the neurological disorders associated with these proteins.
As for many loss-of-function mutations in disease-connected E3 enzymes, it is difficult to envision small molecules that could reactivate the mutant PRKN2 and thereby

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/8/S1/S1

promote neuronal survival in patients suffering from ARJP. However, a gene therapeutic approach to replace the
dysfunctional PARK2 gene with a wild-type copy could
perhaps provide a cure in the future.
In the case of von Hippel-Lindau disease, small molecule
activators of mutant VHL may be able to sustain HIFα
degradation and prevent tumour angiogenesis. However,
it was found that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 protects
certain VHL substrates from proteasomal degradation
[72] and cycloheximide decay assays revealed that HIFα is
degraded by a VHL-independent mechanism in the presence of Hsp90 inhibitors [73]. Hsp90 inhibitors, such as
benzoquinone ansamycin 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), could therefore be exploited in
the treatment of patients with renal carcinomas, an idea
currently being assessed in multi-institutional phase I trials [73]. For a review on Hsp90 inhibitors in drug development, please refer to Maloney and Workman [74].

New frontiers in drug discovery
It is evident that the UBL/UBA proteins and PRKN2
appear to be directly involved in the etiology of cancer
and neurodegenerative diseases. Although this is by no
means a general feature of the UDPs, it highlights the
importance of the ubiquitin system in maintaining an
appropriate intracellular protein milieu.
With respect to the UBL/UBA proteins, one major issue
that remains unresolved relates to their specificity.
Though some details of their substrate selectivity have
emerged [17], a more comprehensive picture is needed in
order to fully validate them as drug targets. The same is the
case for many of the other UDPs encoded in the human
genome [11], some of which may also be involved in
human disease.
In relation to PRKN2, identifying novel substrates of its E3
activity and resolving its proteasome-dependent and/or independent functions (especially relating to endocytosis,
trafficking and signalling via Eps15) may shed some light
on the molecular mechanism of Parkinson's disease and
hopefully lead to novel therapeutic approaches.
