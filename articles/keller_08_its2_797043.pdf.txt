Abstract
Background: Within Chlorophyceae the ITS2 secondary structure shows an unbranched helix I,
except for the 'Hydrodictyon' and the 'Scenedesmus' clade having a ramified first helix. The latter two
are classified within the Sphaeropleales, characterised by directly opposed basal bodies in their
flagellar apparatuses (DO-group). Previous studies could not resolve the taxonomic position of the
'Sphaeroplea' clade within the Chlorophyceae without ambiguity and two pivotal questions remain
open: (1) Is the DO-group monophyletic and (2) is a branched helix I an apomorphic feature of the
DO-group? In the present study we analysed the secondary structure of three newly obtained ITS2
sequences classified within the 'Sphaeroplea' clade and resolved sphaeroplealean relationships by
applying different phylogenetic approaches based on a combined sequence-structure alignment.
Results: The newly obtained ITS2 sequences of Ankyra judayi, Atractomorpha porcata and
Sphaeroplea annulina of the 'Sphaeroplea' clade do not show any branching in the secondary
structure of their helix I. All applied phylogenetic methods highly support the 'Sphaeroplea' clade as
a sister group to the 'core Sphaeropleales'. Thus, the DO-group is monophyletic. Furthermore,
based on characteristics in the sequence-structure alignment one is able to distinguish distinct
lineages within the green algae.
Conclusion: In green algae, a branched helix I in the secondary structure of the ITS2 evolves past
the 'Sphaeroplea' clade. A branched helix I is an apomorph characteristic within the monophyletic
DO-group. Our results corroborate the fundamental relevance of including the secondary
structure in sequence analysis and phylogenetics.

Background
Taxonomists face inconsistent or even contradictory clues
when they examine the affiliation of organisms to higher
taxonomic groupings. Several characters may yield alternative hypotheses explaining their evolutionary back-

ground. This also applies to the taxonomic position of the
Sphaeropleaceae [1-23]. Different authors affiliate the
green algal family by morphological characters to either
ulvophytes or chlorophytes, until amendatory Deason et
al. [10] suggested that the Neochloridaceae, the HydrodicPage 1 of 12

tyaceae and the Sphaeropleaceae should be grouped as
Sphaeropleales within the chlorophytes, since all of them
have motile biflagellate zoospores with a direct-opposite
(DO) confirmation of basal bodies.
Subsequently, other taxonomic lineages (the 'Ankistrodesmus' clade, the 'Bracteacoccus' clade, the 'Pseudomuriella'
clade, Pseudoschroederia, the 'Scenedesmus' clade, Schroederia and the 'Zofingiensis' clade) were added to this biflagellate DO group, because they show molecular affiliation to
either Neochloridaceae or Hydrodictyaceae [24].
Although nowadays most authors agree that the DO
group is monophyletic, until now no study pinpointed
the taxonomic linkage of the name-giving 'Sphaeroplea'
clade to the remaining 'core Sphaeropleales' persuasively
with genetic evidence [6,23], i.e. the sister clade remains
unclear [15,24]. Likewise, with respect to morphology,
studies of 18S and 26S rRNA gene sequences neither
resolve the basal branching patterns within the Chlorophyceae with high statistical power nor corroborate a
monophyletic biflagellate DO group without ambiguity
[6,23].
Müller et al. [25] obtained moderate statistical support for
the close relationship of the 'Sphaeroplea' clade and the
'core Sphaeropleales' with profile distances of 18S and
26S rDNA. In this study we followed and expanded their
methodology with a very different phylogenetic marker.
The internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), the region of
ribosomal RNA between the 5.8S rRNA gene and the large
subunit (26S rDNA) has proven to be an appropriate
marker for the study of small scale phylogenies of close
relatives [26-29]. The sequence is in contrast to the bordering regions of ribosomal subunits evolutionary not
conserved, thus genetic differentiation is detectable even
in closely related groups of organisms. By contrast, the
secondary structure seems to be well conserved and thus
provides clues for higher taxonomic studies [27,30-33].
Secondary structure information is furthermore especially
interesting within the Chlorophyceae, because van Hannen et al. [34] described an uncommon branching of ITS2
helix 1 within the genera Desmodesmus, Hydrodictyon [35]
and Scenedesmus. It is not known when this feature
evolved and whether it is, as we expect, an apomorphic
feature for the DO-group. It is obvious that phylogenetic
statements should be improvable by inclusion of structural information in common sequence analysis. For
example, Grajales et al. [36] calculated morphometric
matrices from ITS2 secondary structures for phylogenetic
analyses, but treated information of sequence and structure as different markers. Here we combine sequence with
structural information in just one analysis. Aside from the
biological problem, we address the pivotal question of a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/218

methodological pipeline for sequence-structure phylogenetics using rDNA data.

Methods
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
Extraction of genomic DNA from cultured cells of Ankyra
judayi, Atractomorpha porcata and Sphaeroplea annulina was
done using Dynabeads® (DNA DIRECT Universal, Dynal
Biotech, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. PCR reactions were performed in a 50 μl reaction volume containing 25 μl FastStart PCR Master (Roche
Applied Science), 5 μl gDNA and 300 nM of the primers
ITS3 (5'-GCA TCG ATG AAG AAC GCA GC-3') and ITS4
(5'-TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC-3') designed by White
et al. [37].

Cycling conditions for amplification consisted of 94°C
for 10 min, 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and
72°C for 45 s, followed by a final extension step of 10 min
at 72°C. PCR products were analysed by 3% agarose gel
electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.
PCR probes where purified with the PCR Purificaton Kit
(Qiagen) and where quantified by spectrometry. Each
sequencing probe was prepared in an 8 μl volume containing 20 ng DNA and 1.25 μM Primer. Sequencing was
carried out using an annealing temperature of 50°C with
the sequencer Applied Biosystems QST 3130 Genetic Analyzer by the Institute of Hygiene and Microbiology (Würzburg, Germany).
ITS2 secondary structure prediction
ITS2 secondary structures of the three newly obtained
sequences were folded with the help of RNAstructure [38]
and afterwards manually corrected. All available 788 chlorophycean ITS2 sequences were obtained from the NCBI
nucleotide database. The ITS2 secondary structure of
Atractomorpha porcata was used as template for homology
modelling. Homology modelling was performed by using
the custom modelling option as provided with the ITS2Database [30-33] (identity matrix and 50% threshold for
the helix transfer). Forty-nine species representing the
chlorophycean diversity were retained and used as comparative taxa in inferring phylogenies (Table 1). For this
taxon sampling, accurate secondary structures of
sequences were now folded by RNAstructure and additionally corrected using Pseudoviewer 3 [39]. We standardized start and end of all helices according to the
optimal folding of the newly obtained sequences.
Alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Using 4SALE [40,41] with its ITS2 specific scoring matrix,
we automatically aligned sequences and structures simultaneously. Sequence-structure alignment is available at
the ITS2 database supplements page. For the complete

alignment we tested for appropriate models of nucleotide
substitution using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
as implemented in Modeltest [42]. The following PAUPblock was used for all maximum likelihood based phylogenetic analyses with PAUP* [43]: Lset Base = (0.2299
0.2415 0.2152) Nst = 6 Rmat = (1.4547 3.9906 2.0143
0.1995 3.9906) Rates = gamma Shape = 1.1102 Pinvar =
0.0931;. A maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was performed with a heuristic search (ten random taxon addition replicates) and nearest neighbour interchange (NNI)
[44].
Maximum parsimony (MP) [45] was accomplished with
gaps treated as missing data and all characters coded as
"unordered" and equally weighted. Additionally, we clustered taxonomic units with neighbour-joining (NJ) [46]
using maximum likelihood distances. Furthermore, with
MrBayes [47] a Bayesian analysis (B) was carried out for
tree reconstruction using a general time reversible substitution model (GTR) [48-50] with substitution rates estimated by MrBayes (nst = 6). Moreover, using ProfDist, a
profile neighbour-joining (PNJ) tree [51,25] was calculated using the ITS2 specific substitution model available
from the ITS2 Database. PNJ was also performed with predefined profiles (prePNJ) of all the clades given in Table 1.
For clade 'Scenedesmus' two profiles were used for groups
'true Scenedesmus' (Scenedesmus except S. longus) and
'Desmodesmus' (Desmodesmus and S. longus). We performed a sequence-structure profile neighbour-joining
(strPNJ) analysis with a developmental beta version of
ProfDist (available upon request). The tree reconstructing
algorithm works on a 12 letter alphabet comprised of the
4 nucleotides in three structural states (unpaired, paired
left, paired right). Based on a suitable substitution model
[40], evolutionary distances between sequence structure
pairs have been estimated by maximum likelihood. All
other applied analyses were computed only on the
sequence part of the sequence-structure alignment. For
MP, NJ, PNJ, prePNJ and strPNJ analyses 1.000 bootstrap
pseudoreplicates [52] were generated. One hundred bootstrap replicates were generated for the ML analysis. Additionally we used RAxML at the CIPRES portal to achieve
1.000 bootstraps with a substitution model estimated by
RAxML [53]. All methods were additionally applied to a
50% structural consensus alignment cropped with 4SALE
(data not shown). The individual steps of the analysis are
displayed in a flow chart (Fig. 1).

and thus only the first one was used for further analysis.
According to folding with RNAstructure, ITS2 secondary
structures of the three newly obtained sequences did not
exhibit any branching in their helix I (Fig. 2) as it is
described for the 'core Sphaeropleales', i.e. helix I was
more similar to those of the CW-group and the 'Oedogonium' clade. Helix I of Sphaeroplea annulina was explicitly
longer (9 nucleotides) than those of the other newly
obtained algae. Due to this insertion, for Sphaeroplea, a
branching pattern was enforceable, but would have lower
energy efficiency. However, the additional nucleotides are
not homologous to the insertion capable of making an
additional stem (Y-structure) found in the 'Scenedesmus'
and the 'Hydrodictyon' clade (approximately 25 bases).
ITS2 sequence and secondary structure information
ITS2 sequence lengths of all studied species ran from 202
to 262 nucleotides (nt), 235 nt on average. The GC contents of ITS2 sequences ranged from 36.84% to 59.92%,
with a mean value of 52.42%. The number of base pairs
(bp) varied between 64 and 89 bp and averaged 77 bp.
The cropped alignment (50% structural consensus)
showed that 23% of the nucleotides had at least a 50%
consistency in their pairings. Compensatory base changes
(CBCs) as well as hemi-CBCs (all against all) range from
0 to 16 with a mean of 6.6 CBCs (Fig. 2). Sequence pairs
lacking CBCs were exclusively found within the same
major clade.

Results

Characteristics in a conserved part of alignment
In agreement with Coleman [28], the 5' side part near the
tip of helix III was highly conserved including the UGGU
motif [54,55,30], likewise the UGGGU motif in case of
Chlorophyceae. We selected a part of the alignment at this
position with adjacent columns (Fig. 2) to verify the suggested conservation. Having a closer look at this part of
helix III, in our case, it showed typical sequence and structural characteristics for distinct groups. Studied species of
the 'Oedogonium' clade possess at position 3 in the selected
part of the alignment an adenine and in addition at positions 3–5 paired bases. In contrast, the CW-group solely
possessed three consecutively paired bases in this block,
but not the adenine. A typical pattern for clades of the
DO-group was a twofold motif of 3 bases: uracile, adenine
and guanine at positions 7–9, which is repeated at positions 11–13. This could be a duplication, which results in
a modified secondary structure. In addition, the 'core
Sphaeropleales' ('Hydrodictyon' clade and 'Scenedesmus'
clade) showed an adenine base change at position 6, compared to all other clades.

New ITS2 sequences
GenBank accession numbers for newly obtained nucleotide sequences are given in Table 1 (entries 1–4). The two
ITS2 sequences of Sphaeroplea annulina (Roth, Agardh)
strain SAG 377-1a and strain SAG 377-1e were identical

Phylogenetic tree information
The PAUP* calculation applying maximum Parsimony
included a total of 479 characters, whereas 181 characters
were constant, 214 variable characters were parsimony-

directly access sequences and structures deposed at the ITS2 Database. The sequence-structure alignment was derived by
4SALE [40]. Afterwards several phylogenetic approaches were used to calculate trees: NJ = neighbour-joining, PNJ = profile

ones.
The resulting trees (Fig. 3 and 4, Table 2) of all performed
analyses (NJ [PAUP* and ProfDist], PNJ, prePNJ, strPNJ,
ML [PAUP* and RAxML], MP, B) yielded six major clades:
the 'Dunaliella', the 'Hydrodictyon', the 'Oedogonium', the
'Reinhardtii', the 'Scenedesmus', and the 'Sphaeroplea' clade.
All of them were separated and – except for the 'Scenedesmus' clade – highly supported by bootstrap values of 83–
100%, respectively by Bayesian posterior probabilities of
0.86–1.0.
The 'Hydrodictyon' clade, the 'Scenedesmus' clade and the
'Sphaeroplea' clade form one cluster that was strongly
supported by high bootstrap values of 67–96% (node
"g"). The three clades composed the DO-group. The
opposite cluster included the 'Dunaliella' and the 'Reinhardtii' clade, forming the CW-group. The 'Oedogonium'
clade was chosen as the outgroup [56]. Both clusters (CWgroup and 'Oedogonium' clade) were strongly supported
by bootstrap values of 84–100% (nodes "i" and "h").

Except for the Bayesian analysis (least support for node
"c"), all applied methods yielded node "e" as the weakest
point within the basal (labelled) branches (Table 2),
which presents the relationship between the 'Hydrodictyon'
and the 'Scenedesmus' clade on the one hand and the
'Dunaliella', the 'Oedogonium', the 'Reinhardtii' and the
'Sphaeroplea' clade on the other hand. The phylogenetic
tree resulting from neighbour-joining analysis by PAUP*
(Fig. 3) did not support node "e" at all, but strongly supported the remaining labelled branches. The maximum
likelihood analysis by PAUP* (Fig. 4) did not encourage
node "e" either. Both maximum likelihood methods did
not even support nodes "a" ('true Scenedesmus' compared
to remaining clades) and "c" ('Scenedesmus' opposite to
remaining clades). All other basal branches were supported by this method.
Varying neighbour-joining analyses by ProfDist (NJ, PNJ,
prePNJ, strPNJ) supported all basal branches – except for
the weakest node "e" (average support) – with very high
bootstrap support values of 84–100%. The maximum Parsimony method gave average support (63 and 62%) for

The table supplements Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. Node "g" supports a monophyletic DO group and is printed in bold letters. Software used: ProfDist and
PAUP*. Models of substitution: ITS2 = GTR with ITS2 substitution matrix, Modeltest: TVM+I+G with estimated parameters. Phylogenetic analysis:
NJ = neighbour-joining, PNJ = profile neighbour-joining, prePNJ = profile neighbour-joining with predefined profiles, strPNJ = sequence-structure

node "c" and "e" and high bootstrap values (80–100%)
for the remaining basal clades. The Bayesian analysis
offered posterior probabilities of 0.72 for node "c" and
0.86–1.0 for the remaining basal nodes. For further sister
group relations see Fig. 3 and 4.
In comparison, the topology of the phylogenetic tree
based on the 50% cropped alignment did not change, but
the bootstrap support values were lower in all cases (data
not shown).

Discussion
The internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) is required in
ribosome biogenesis [57-59] and its gradual removal
from mature rRNA is driven by its specific secondary structure [60,59].

rDNA and 18S rDNA data, but the relationship between
the 'core Sphaeropleales' and the Sphaeropleaceae
remained unclear. However, in their studies, Ankyra,
Atractomorpha and Sphaeroplea clustered in a monophyletic clade named Sphaeropleaceae. We confirm this
'Sphaeroplea' clade with all three genera being strongly separated from other clades. As a result of a Bayesian analysis
on a combined 18S and 26S rDNA dataset Shoup and
Lewis [61] also found the Sphaeropleaceae as the most
basal clade within the Sphaeropleales, but again the analysis lacked a strong backing. Beside these difficulties the
'core Sphaeropleales' were already shown to be monophyletic with high certainty [6,25,62,61,23].

Using three newly obtained ITS2 sequences from Ankyra
judayi, Atractomorpha porcata and Sphaeroplea annulina
(Sphaeropleaceae) in this study we aimed to pursue two
consecutive questions concerning the phylogenetic relationships within Chlorophyceae. (1) What is the phylogenetic position of the newly sequenced algae relative to the
'core Sphaeropleales' and could the biflagellate DO-group
be regarded as monophyletic? (2) How does the secondary structure of the new ITS2 sequences look like and is an
autapomorphic feature of the secondary structure associated with the monophyletic DO-group?

The DO-group (Sphaeropleales including the 'Sphaeroplea'
clade) as emended by Deason et al. [10], for which the
directly opposed basal body orientation and basal body
connection features are verified [63-65], is now strongly
supported by molecular phylogenetic analyses. There was
already evidence of an extended DO-group [6,66,67],
however, for some groups ultrastructural results are still
lacking, and even though the collective basal body orientation and connection imply a monophyletic DO-group,
until now no molecular phylogenetic analysis could show
this with solid support [6,62,24,23]. We demonstrate for
the first time with robust support values for the equivocal
nodes that the 'core Sphaeropleales', the 'Sphaeroplea'
clade, and the Sphaeropleales are monophyletic.

Considering the question (1) Buchheim et al. [6] and
Wolf et al. [23] approached the problem with 18S + 26S

Regarding question (2), for all structures of the 'Hydrodictyon' and the 'Scenedesmus' clade, helix I shows the typical

Neighbour-joining phylogeny of the Chlorophyceae based on comparison of ITS2 rRNA sequences and structures
Neighbour-joining phylogeny of the Chlorophyceae based on comparison of ITS2 rRNA sequences and structures. The tree is unrooted, but the 'Oedogonium' clade is most likely appropriate as outgroup [56]. Sequences of the 'Sphaeroplea' clade were sequenced for this study and shown in bold letters. The phylogenetic tree is calculated by neighbour-joining
with PAUP* [46,43] for an alignment with 52 taxa and 479 characters. The substitution model was set to TVM+I+G with
parameters estimated by Modeltest [42]. Bootstrap values of basal branches are given for profile neighbour-joining with predefined profiles (ProfDist with ITS2 substitution model) [51,31]. Branch thickness is dependant of Bootstrap values calculated
with four distance methods: neighbour-joining (PAUP*), neighbour-joining, complete profile neighbour-joining and sequencestructure profile neighbour-joining (all three ProfDist with ITS2 substitution model).

Phylogeny of chlorophyte ITS2 sequences and structures based on distances of a Bayesian analysis. The alignment contained 52 taxa and 479 characters. The suggested outgroup is the 'Oedogonium' clade [56]. Sequenced species are
shown in bold ('Sphaeroplea' clade). Substitution models and tree distances were calculated with MrBayes [47]. Posterior probabilities are shown for basal branches. Branch thickness is dependant of Bootstrap values calculated with maximum likelihood
(PAUP* with TVM+I+G, RAxML) [42,53,43] and maximum Parsimony (PAUP*) (see legend). Resulting parameter of performing MP are L = 1231, CI = 0.4427, HI = 0.5573, RI = 0.7264, RC = 0.3216.

branching (Y-structure). Initially, An et al. [68] proposed
a secondary structure model with an unbranched helix I
for ITS2 sequences of 'Scenedesmus' clade members. Thereafter, van Hannen et al. [34] updated the model by folding
the nucleotide sequences based upon minimum free
energy and found a branched helix I as the most energetically stable option. The branching is result of an insertion
of approximately 25 nucleotides capable of folding as an
individual stem within the 5' end of the first helix. However, ITS2 sequence and secondary structure information
of further 'core Sphaeropleales' members, e.g. the 'Ankistrodesmus' clade and the 'Bracteacoccus' clade, lacks hitherto. In contrast, the Y-structure is absent within the
'Sphaeroplea' clade and any other investigated group so far.
Thus this feature is – contrary to our expectation – not an
autapomorphic character for the biflagellate DO-group as
a whole but for the 'core Sphaeropleales'.
Regarding future work, the resolution among the main
clades of Chlorophyceae was statistically poorly supported in previous studies [68,15,6,23]. Pröschold and
Leliaert [24] reviewed the systematics of green algae by
applying a polyphasic approach, but did not yield a clear
resolution regarding a sister taxon to the Sphaeropleales.
Since they are not yet available, ITS2 sequences of chaetopeltidalean and chaetophoralean taxa could not be
included in the present study and therefore the phylogenetic relationships between the main Chlorophyceae
clades remain open. We recommend involving sequence
and secondary structure information of chaetopeltidalean
and chaetophoralean ITS2 sequences in future studies to
find out if the monophyletic biflagellate DO-group could
be further extended to a general monophyletic DO-group
containing quadri- and biflagellate taxa. A genome-wide
approach
indicates
that
Sphaeropleales
and
Chlamydomonadales are sister taxa, however only a few
organisms are included in this study [56]. An additional
uprising question is when the Y has evolved within the
'core Sphaeropleales'. This could be resolved by inclusion
of other members (e.g. Bracteacoccus) in further studies.
The two major reasons contributing to the robust results
presented here are the change of the phylogenetic marker
and the inclusion of secondary structure information. In
contrast to previous phylogenetic work concerning Chlorophyceae, this study is based on the ITS2, which offers a
resolution power for relationships from the level of subspecies up to the order level, because of their variable
sequence but conserved secondary structure [26,30-33].
Hitherto commonly used markers in contrast are a lot
more restricted. Using 4SALE [40] with implemented
structure consideration, we could achieve for the first time
a global simultaneously generated sequence-structure
alignment (c.f. Fig. 1) yielding specific sequence and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/218

structural features distinguishing different algae lineages
(c.f. Fig. 2).

Conclusion
In summary, the powerful combination of the ITS2 rRNA
gene marker plus a multiple global alignment based synchronously on sequence and secondary structure yielded
high bootstrap support values for almost all nodes of the
computed phylogenetic trees. Thus, the relationship of
Sphaeropleaceae is here resolved, being a part of the
Sphaeropleales representing the monophyletic biflagellate DO-group. Furthermore, we could elucidate a
branched helix I of ITS2 as an autapomorphic feature
within the DO-group. This feature could be found only in
the 'Hydrodictyon' and the 'Scenedesmus' clade. Our results
corroborate the presented methodological pipeline, the
fundamental relevance of secondary structure consideration, as well as the elevated power and suitability of ITS2
in phylogenetics. For a methodological improvement it is
suitable to ameliorate the alignment algorithm in further
considering horizontal dependencies of paired nucleotides, and moreover in future ITS2 studies it is suggested
to include sequence and secondary structure information
of hitherto not regarded taxa to resolve the chlorophycean
phylogeny.
