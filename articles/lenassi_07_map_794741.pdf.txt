Abstract
Background: Hortaea werneckii is one of the most salt-tolerant species among microorganisms. It
has been isolated from hypersaline waters of salterns as one of the predominant species of a group
of halophilic and halotolerant melanized yeast-like fungi, arbitrarily named as "black yeasts". It has
previously been shown that H. werneckii has distinct mechanisms of adaptation to high salinity
environments that are not seen in salt-sensitive and only moderately salt-tolerant fungi. In H.
werneckii, the HOG pathway is important for sensing the changes in environmental osmolarity, as
demonstrated by identification of three main pathway components: the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) HwHog1, the MAPK kinase HwPbs2, and the putative histidine kinase osmosensor
HwHhk7.
Results: In this study, we show that the expression of HwHOG1 in salt-adapted cells depends on
the environmental salinity and that HwHOG1 transcription responds rapidly but reciprocally to the
acute hyper-saline or hypo-saline stress. Molecular modelling of HwHog1 reveals an overall
structural homology with other MAPKs. HwHog1 complements the function of ScHog1 in the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae multistress response. We also show that hyper-osmolar, oxidative and
high-temperature stresses activate the HwHog1 kinase, although under high-temperature stress
the signal is not transmitted via the MAPK kinase Pbs2. Identification of HOG1-like genes from
other halotolerant fungi isolated from solar salterns demonstrates a high degree of similarity and
excellent phylogenetic clustering with orthologues of fungal origin.
Conclusion: The HOG signalling pathway has an important role in sensing and responding to
hyper-osmolar, oxidative and high-temperature stresses in the halophilic fungi H. werneckii. These
findings are an important advance in our understanding of the HOG pathway response to stress in
H. werneckii, a proposed model organism for studying the salt tolerance of halophilic and
halotolerant eukaryotes.

Background
Solar salterns represent an extreme environment, with
high concentrations of NaCl, occasional rapid changes in
water activity, low oxygen concentrations and high UV
radiation [1]. These environments are inhabited mostly
by bacteria and archea, but also by certain algal and fungal
species [2-4]. These extremophilic fungi are represented
by a group of melanized fungi, the so-called black yeasts
Hortaea werneckii, Phaeotheca triangularis and Aureobasidium pullulans, and by the non-melanized fungi Wallemia
sebi, W. muriae and W. ichthyophaga. These fungi form a
new group of eukaryotic halotolerant and halophilic
fungi, with H. werneckii (Dothideales, Ascomycota) being
the predominant species. H. werneckii is also the prevailing species at environmental salinities above 3.5 M NaCl
[3].
The ability of H. werneckii to cope with extreme changes in
environmental salinity is also demonstrable under laboratory conditions, with a defined range of growth in batch
cultures from 0.0 M NaCl to saturated salinity (5.5 M
NaCl) in the media, and a broad growth optimum from
1.0 M to 3.0 M NaCl. High adaptability and salt-tolerance
are properties that make H. werneckii a highly appropriate
model system for studying salt tolerance in eukaryotes [5].
It has previously been shown that H. werneckii has distinct
mechanisms of adaptation to high-salinity environments
that are not seen in salt-sensitive and only moderately
salt-tolerant fungi [6]. The most relevant differences studied to date are in plasma membrane composition and
properties [7], osmolyte composition and accumulation
[5,8], and the maintenance of low intracellular potassium
and sodium ion levels [9].
Multiple signalling pathways allow organisms to respond
to different extracellular stimuli and to adjust their cellular machinery to changes in their environment. The sensing of environmental osmolarity changes is vital for cell
survival. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the pathway for the
sensing of these changes and responding to them is
known as the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signalling
pathway, one of the best understood mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. MAPK cascades are ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms and are composed of three
sequentially acting kinases. In response to an extracellular
stimulus, a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) phosphorylates and activates a MAPK kinase (MAPKK); this then
phosphorylates and activates a MAPK. In the case of the
HOG pathway, upon osmotic stress, the transmembrane
osmosensors Sho1 and Sln1 stimulate this pathway
through two distinct mechanisms, each of which leads to
the activation of the key MAPK Hog1. Together with Ypd1
and Ssk1, the histidine kinase Sln1 forms a phospho-relay
cascade, which transfers the signal to the MAPKK Pbs2
and its downstream MAPK, Hog1. Alternatively, Pbs2 can

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/3/1/3

be activated through the Sho1-Ste20-Ste11 branch
(reviewed in [10-12]). Phosphorylated Hog1 controls the
transcription of a family of osmo-responsive genes,
including glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase [13-15].
Although this Sln1 and Sho1 stimulation is redundant for
promoting growth on high-osmolarity media, the Sln1
pathway is specialized for responses to conditions of
modest osmolarity [16].
The HOG pathway has classically been considered as specific to osmotic stress, although recent studies have
revealed new functions for this MAPK route. Evidence suggests that heat shock can activate Hog1 through the osmosensor Sho1 [17]. Alternatively, Sln1 can be activated by a
drop in temperature [18] or by citric-acid stress [19]. It has
also been shown that basal activity through the HOG
pathway contributes to the regulation of cell-wall composition [20]. Additional functions have been identified for
HOG-homologous pathways in other species. In Candida
albicans, Hog1 has been implicated in the response to oxidative stress through the Sln1 branch. In the fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the Sty1 pathway drives the
transcriptional response to stimuli like osmotic stress,
heat shock, cold stress, and oxidative and UV injury
(reviewed [21]).
In H. werneckii, the presence of the HOG pathway was
demonstrated by identification of homologous genes of
the main components of the pathway: the MAPK
HwHog1 [22], the MAPKK HwPbs2 and a putative histidine kinase osmosensor HwHhk7 (our unpublished
data). Although the HwHog1 protein shows high homology to S. cerevisiae Hog1, important differences in both
activation and localization of the phosphorylated and
non-phosphorylated forms of HwHog1p have been seen
[22]. The present study was aimed at further defining the
role of HwHog1 in response to stress, by using functional
complementation of HwHOG1 genes in S. cerevisiae
mutants (Δhog1, Δpbs2) and by exposing the transformants to various stresses. We hypothesized that the HOG
pathway of H. werneckii mediates not only high-osmolarity signals, but also responses to other environmental
stresses, such as UV irradiation, high temperature, high
pH, and oxidative stress, all typical of saline environments. Here, we present evidence confirming the involvement of the HOG pathway in the multi-stress response of
H. werneckii.

Results and Discussion
Expression of HwHOG1 in salt-adapted cells depends on
environmental salinity and responses to saline stress
In a previous study by Turk et al. [22], the H. werneckii
Hog1 homologue protein (HwHog1) was identified. An
in vitro kinase assay demonstrated that in contrast to S. cerevisiae, where Hog1 is activated even at very low salt con-

centrations, HwHog1 is fully active only at extremely high
salt concentrations. In the present study, we examined
how different NaCl concentrations in the growth media
affect the expression of the HwHOG1 gene in cells adapted
to 1.0 M, 3.0 M and 4.5 M NaCl and in salt-stressed cells.
The transcript levels of HwHOG1 were examined by
reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. As shown in Figure 1A,
the transcript levels of HwHOG1 show a U-shaped profile,
with approximately 5-fold and 4-fold induction at 1.0 M
and 4.5 M NaCl, respectively, compared to the low level
of gene expression seen at the moderate salinity of 3.0 M
NaCl, which has been previously reported to be the optimal physiological condition for H. werneckii [5]. The transcriptional response of HwHOG1 to acute salt stress was
relatively fast, reaching the first 2-fold change in transcript
levels after 30 min, for both hyper-saline (3.0 M → 4.5 M
NaCl; Fig. 1B) and hypo-saline (3.0 M → 1.0 M NaCl; Fig.
1C) stress. After the acute hyper-saline stress, the highest
HwHOG1 transcript levels were seen after 60 min, showing an approximately 3-fold induction, as compared to
the basal level of the transcript; this then rapidly declined.
After the acute hypo-saline stress, the lowest HwHOG1
transcript levels were seen after 30 min, showing an
approximately 2.5-fold repression. Following the first
acute stress response for both of these stresses, a slow but

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/3/1/3

continous increase in HwHOG1 transcript levels was seen
after 90 min, suggesting the starting phase of the adaptive
response, which probably contributes to the levels of the
transcript seen in the adaptation study (Fig. 1A). Reciprocal transcriptional response of HwHOG1 as seen from the
results of hypo/hyper-saline stress experiments could be
connected with the action of the general stress response
elements (STRE), previously identified in the promoter
region of HwHOG1 [22]. Hog1 is regulated at different
levels in different organisms. While in S. cerevisiae the activation of Hog1 is regulated at a posttranscriptional level
[23], in Aspergillus nidulans, HOG1 gene is upregulated
with exposure to high concentrations of salt [24]. In H.
werneckii, the salt-responsive regulation of HwHog1
appeared to be at both levels, posttranslationally by phosphorylation [22], and as seen in the present study, at the
level of transcription.
Molecular modelling of HwHog1 reveals an overall
structural homology with the MAPK fold
The HwHOG1 open reading frame (ORF) encodes a 359amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of
46 kDa and with all of the conserved regions that are specific for the MAPKs, such as the common docking (CD)
domain at the C-terminal end, a TGY phosphorylation

fold-inductions of HwHOG1 on cDNA levels are expressed as means (± standard deviations) of three independent experiments
relative to 3.0 M NaCl in adapted cells, or relative to the time point 0 min in stressed cells.

motif at amino-acid residues 171–173, and an Asp in the
active site [22].
To further examine the possible rearrangements of these
key structural elements of HwHog1p, the three-dimensional (3D) model of the full-length HwHog1 protein was
calculated using the MODELLER programme [25], based
on crystallographic structure of murine p38 MAPK as a
template [26], a functional and structural homologue of
S. cerevisiae Hog1. This approach to comparative protein
modelling was based on the satisfaction of spatial
restraints [27] implemented in the MODELLER programme. Since the template structure for homology-based
modelling was more than 40% identical to the sequence
of the target (47.43% homology), the model created
should have about 90% of the main-chain atoms comparable with the X-ray structure [25]. This calculated 3D
model of the structure of HwHog1 demonstrated the well
defined overall fold of the MAP kinase superfamily. The
superposition of the HwHog1 model on the murine p38
template revealed a strong overlap, particularly within the
conserved regions and with the active-site amino-acid residues of the phosphorylation "Lip" (Fig. 2A). Compared
to the template structure, the topologically less overlapping region is a portion in the N-terminal domain that
consists mainly of β-sheets. The phosphorylation Lip and
the docking groove (CD domain) are exposed on opposite
sides of the protein surface (Fig. 2B). The phosphorylation
Lip in HwHog1 (LARIQDPQMTGYV) consists of 13
amino-acid residues (Fig. 2C), exactly as does the Lip in
p38 (LARHTDDEMTGYV). The structural positioning of
the critical phosphorylation residues of Thr171 and
Tyr173 within the Lip of HwHog1 shows complete steric
agreement with Thr180 and Tyr182 of p38, although
these Lip regions share only 69% amino-acid identity.
There is also an excess net negative charge in the p38 Lip
as compared with the HwHog1 Lip, due to the absence of
glutamate and aspartate in this region of HwHog1.
Although the HwHog1 contains a proline residue in the
phosphorylation Lip, this does not disturb the architecture of the Lip. Therefore, the phosphorylation site
sequence of Thr171-Gly172-Tyr173 makes the essential
surface turn.
The architecture of the CD domains of the MAPK docking
grooves is structurally less conserved between HwHog1
(LAPYHDPTDEPEAQ) and p38 (FAQYHDPDDEPVAP),
most probably due to the additional proline residue in
HwHog1 (Fig. 2D). However, the three negatively charged
amino-acid residues (Asp304, Asp307 and Glu308 in
HwHog1) that are critical for docking interactions in p38
are structurally completely aligned between these MAP
kinases.

HwHog1 complements ScHog1 function in the multi-stress
response
To confirm that the HwHOG1 gene is a true functional
homologue of the yeast HOG1 gene, and to determine
whether the activation of HwHog1 requires the MAPKK
Pbs2, we carried out functional complementation assays.
The S. cerevisiae wild-type or hog1 and pbs2 mutant strains
were transformed with either the pRD53-HwHOG1 plasmid or the empty vector and selected on YNB-Ura+Gal
plates supplemented with different salt and sorbitol concentrations. As shown in Figure 3A, HwHOG1 successfully
complemented the S. cerevisiae hog1 phenotype, as the
cells expressing HwHog1 grew only slightly slower than
the S. cerevisiae wild-type strain on 1.0 M NaCl, 1.0 M KCl,

0.2 M LiCl and 1.5 M sorbitol plates (Fig. 3A, upper panels). These data not only demonstrate that the cells
expressing HwHog1 have restored tolerance to sodium
and potasium ions and to sorbitol, but also that the osmotolerance was restored only in the presence of the MAPKK
Pbs2 (Fig. 3B). To check the expression levels of Hog1 and
HwHog1 in transformed strains, we performed immunoblot analyses of Hog1 proteins from S. cerevisiae cell
lysates. As shown in Figure 3B, the Hog1 protein levels
were the same in all of the HOG1-containing strains, confirming that the effects seen are not the consequence of
different amounts of the Hog1 protein in the cells, but
rather the type of Hog1 expressed. We therefore conclude
that the HwHog1 kinase is a true homologue of S. cerevisiae Hog1, and that the signal triggered by increased
osmolarity transfers to Hog1 via the upstream MAPKK
Pbs2, as has already been shown for the salt-sensitive S.
cerevisiae.
Recent studies on Hog1 of S. cerevisiae, C. albicans and Sc.
pombe have suggested that this protein can also be activated in response to heat shock, cold stress, oxidative
stress, and UV injury [18,21]. To test the response of
HwHog1 to these alternative stresses, we analyzed the
growth of S. cerevisiae wild-type or hog1 and pbs2 mutant
strains exposed to UV, high pH, H2O2, and low and high
temperatures. As shown in Figure 3A (lower panels),
HwHog1 is evidently less efficient in response to UV stress
than wild-type S. cerevisiae. However, as has been shown
previously in viability studies where both yeasts were
exposed to UV irradiation, the black yeast H. werneckii is
much more resistant to UV irradiation than S. cerevisiae.
The highest viability of melanized H. werneckii cells was
achieved in the stationary phase, where the melanin is
most dense (personal communication, N. Gunde-Cimerman). Considering both sets of data, we can speculate that
melanin is the main UV protectant in H. werneckii, and
that activation of the HOG signalling pathway is not
involved in the UV stress response.
In contrast, the HOG signalling pathway does appear to
be important in oxidative stress. As shown in Figure 3A, S.
cerevisiae expressing HwHog1 are more resistant to H2O2
than are the wild-type cells. Furthermore, this depends on
the presence of the MAPKK Pbs2. The ability of H. werneckii to combat oxidative stress has been recently
addressed, again, using hydrogen peroxide as the reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-generating compound. Exposure to
H2O2 resulted in a decrease in H. werneckii viability at
extremely high salt concentrations, suggesting that the
level of ROS degradation and resistance determine the
upper limits of the salt tolerance of H. werneckii [28]. Our
data here suggest that the response to oxidative stress in H.
werneckii is also mediated via the HOG signalling pathway.

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/3/1/3

Additionally, HwHog1 appears to mediate the response to
high-temperature stress (Fig. 3A, lower panels). Although
wild-type S. cerevisiae cells did not grow better in the presence of HwHog1, HwHOG1 complemented the S. cerevisiae hog1 phenotype. Interestingly, amongst all of the
stresses used in the present study, only the heat-shock
response is independent of the Pbs2 protein, with growth
in the pbs2 mutant strain being the same as in both the
wild-type and the hog1 mutant.
These data suggest that heat-shock signals that activate
HwHog1 are transmitted via a pathway distinct from the
classical HOG pathway in which this MAPK and the scaffold protein Pbs2 have crucial roles. High temperature is
stressful for H. werneckii, as has been shown by ecological
studies. Recently, a novel strain of H. werneckii was isolated from solar salterns in the Dominican Republic.
There were only a few isolates, but they showed optimal
growth at 32°C [2]. Other salterns with typically lower
environmental temperatures, on the other hand, are
much more dominated by the black yeasts, and primarily
by H. werneckii. These selected genotypes grew much better at lower temperatures (around 26°C), indicating that
high tempertures represent additional stress for these species [3]. Activation of HwHog1 could therefore be of general importance in regulating the transcription of the gene
set that is involved in combating high-temperature stress.
In contrast, lower temperatures in the environment are
less stressful for H. werneckii, and therefore in this case
HwHog1 is not activated upon low-temperature exposure.
The exposure of cells to elevated pH in the environment
does not appear to be connected with HOG pathway activation either, as mutants with the empty vector grew as
well as mutants expressing HwHog1 in conditions of
high-pH stress (Fig. 3A, lower panels).
Hog1-like MAPKs from halotolerant fungi share a high
degree of similarity with orthologues of fungal origin
Since very little is known about Hog1 protein orthologues
from extremophilic fungi, we also sought HOG1-like
genes in the following fungi isolated from solar salterns:
the halotolerant A. pullulans, the halophilic P. triangularis,
and the xerophilic W. sebi, W. muriae, and W. ichthyophaga, the last being the most halophilic fungi known to
date, with an obligate requirement of at least 1.7 M NaCl
[29]. Using the multiple sequence alignment function in
ClustalW, HwHog1 and the translated partial Hog1
sequences from the halotolerant/halophilic fungi were
aligned with Hog1 proteins from the salt-sensitive S. cerevisiae, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, C.
albicans, Neurospora crassa, and Yarrowia lipolytica, and also
the moderately halotolerant Debaryomyces hansenii and
the halotolerant Eurotium herbariorum (Fig. 4). The overall
alignment showed very high sequence conservation and
establishes a high-quality consensus sequence of the fun-

gal Hog1 proteins. The phosphorylation site sequence
Thr-Gly-Tyr was completely conserved across all of the
fungi studied (Fig. 4, black arrows), and the high conservation level extended further over the entire activation
loop containing the phosphorylation Lip. The most heterogenous part of the aligned sequences preceeds the CD
domain and is approximately 50 amino-acid residues in
length. The region of the CD domain itself was somewhat
variable, although the YHDP [T/S]DEP consensus motif
contains the three essential negatively charged amino-acid
residues (underlined) that are critical for the docking
interactions of the MAPK with downstream effectors.
Interestingly, among the fungi studied, only Hog1 from
W. ichthyophaga was an exception regarding the separation
of these three acidic amino-acid residues. In place of the
Thr/Ser separator, WiHog1 contains glutamate, which
results in a sequence motif that is more similar to the
mammalian p38 isoforms than the fungal Hog1 orthologues. The deduced protein sequences of WmHog1 and
WsHog1 were completely identical. Since large molecular
distances were seen in the large subunit (LSU) rDNA
sequences of W. ichthyophaga and W. sebi, and in the
sequences of the rDNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS1
and ITS2) of W. ichthyophaga on the one hand and W.
muriae and W. sebi on the other, it is possible that the
genus Wallemia in fact comprises a complex of several
phylogenetically remote genera, with the taxa in-between
being extinct or not having been isolated yet [29].
A functional phylogenetic tree based on the amino-acid
alignment of the Hog1 sequences from the above-mentioned fungi was generated using the neighbour-joining
method implemented in ClustalW (Fig. 5). According to
the amino-acid sequences, the fungi isolated from solar
salterns are grouped into two clusters. The first is represented by halotolerant-to-extremely-halotolerant black
yeasts of the order Dothideales. The second cluster is composed of the genus Wallemia, with the halophilic W. ichthyophaga being distinct from the more xerophilic W.
muriae and W. sebi. As expected, S. cerevisiae, C. albicans
and D. hansenii were grouped together in the Saccharomycetales cluster.

Conclusion
In this study, we have demonstrated that the HOG signalling pathway has an important role in the stress response
of H. werneckii, a highly halotolerant fungal species isolated from solar salterns. This pathway was activated not
only in response to hyper-osmolar stress, but also to oxidative and heat stress, both typical of this extreme environment. Signals triggered by hyper-osmolar and
oxidative stress were seen to be transmitted via the
MAPKK Pbs2, the activator of the HwHog1 kinase. However, this was not the case for the high-temperature stress,
in which Pbs2 appeared to have no key functional role.

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/3/1/3

Our data show that HwHog1 is a true homologue of
Hog1, a key MAPK of the HOG signalling pathway in S.
cerevisiae. The 3D model of the full-length HwHog1 protein revealed an overall structural homology with other
known MAPKs.
We have also shown that the Hog1-like MAPKs from other
halophilic/halotolerant fungi isolated from the solar salterns share a high degree of similarity with orthologues of
fungal origin. A phylogenetic tree based on the aminoacid alignment of fungal Hog1 sequences showed good
agreement with the taxonomic structure of the fungi studied.
Our findings thus provide an important advance in our
understanding of the response via the HOG pathway to a
variety of different environmental stresses. Furthermore,
this study builds on our understanding of the stressresponse mechanisms in H. werneckii, an increasingly useful model organism for studying the mechanisms of salt
tolerance in eukaryotic cells.

Methods
Strains and growth conditions
The cultures of Hortaea werneckii (MZKI B736), Phaeotheca
triangularis (MZKI B748), Aureobasidium pullulans (EXF
150), Wallemia sebi (EXF 757), W. muriae (MZKI B952)
and W. ichthyophaga (EXF 994) were from the culture collections of the Slovenian National Institute of Chemistry
(MZKI) and the Department of Biology, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana (EXF). The cells were grown
at 28°C in a rotary shaker (180 rpm) in defined YNB
medium, containing 0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base
(Qbiogene), 0.08% (w/v) complete supplement mixture
(CSM) (Qbiogene), 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulphate and
2% (w/v) glucose in deionized water, with NaCl added at
the concentrations indicated, and the pH adjusted to 7.0.
The cells were harvested in the mid-exponential growth
phase by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min. For the
saline-stress experiments, H. werneckii cells were grown in
YNB with 3.0 M NaCl to an optical density at 600 nm
(OD600) of 0.7, and then the medium was replaced with
either 1.0 M NaCl-YNB for the hyposaline stress, or by 4.5
M NaCl-YNB for the hypersaline stress. Aliquots of the cell
suspensions were removed before the application of the
stress and at 10, 30, 60, 90 and 240 min of stress. The cells
were separated from the growth medium by fast filtration
through a 0.45-μ m-pore filter and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The reference salt-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae

MAPKs from the halotolerant fungi A. pullulans, P. triangularis, W. ichthyophaga, W. muriae, and W. sebi were aligned with the corresponding regions of the Hog1 protein from S. cerevisiae [GenBank: P32485], D. hansenii [GenBank: Q9UV50], H. werneckii
[GenBank: AAM64214], A. fumigatus [GenBank: XM_747571], C. albicans [GenBank: Q92207], C. neoformans [GenBank:
AAM26267], N. crassa [GenBank: AF297032], Y. lipolytica [GenBank: CAG79982], and E. herbariorum [GenBank: AAK25816]
using the ClustalW programme. The output was graphically presented using the JalView programme implemented in ClustalW.

Reverse-transcription PCR
The total RNA contents of the H. werneckii cells were isolated using the TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), according to
the manufacturer instructions. The RNA was extracted
from 200–300 mg of mid-exponential phase cells grown
in salt-free YNB medium or in media with 1.0 M, 3.0 M
and 4.5 M NaCl. The same protocol was used for the cells
exposed to hypersaline and hyposaline shock. For the synthesis of cDNA, the RNA was first treated with DNase I
(Fermentas). One μg of DNA-free RNA was used for 20 μL
of the reverse transcription reaction using Superscript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer
primers (Promega), according to the manufacturer protocols.

Phylogenetic tree of deduced Hog1-like MAPKs in the haloPhylogenetic tree of deduced Hog1-like MAPKs in
the halotolerant fungi and other fungal representatives. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with the neighbour-joining method [36] based on the amino-acid
sequences, using the MEGA 3.1 programme [37], and arbitrarily rooted with W. ichthyophaga. The numbers at the
nodes are bootstrap confidence values based on 1,000 replicas. The phylogenetic tree was subjected to a Poisson correction. The saltern-inhabiting halotolerant fungi are
indicated by the grey boxes.

strains were obtained from the Euroscarf Yeast Deletion
Strain Collection, Germany.
Amplification of HOG1-like genes from the genomes of the
halotolerant fungi
Highly purified fungal genomic DNA was isolated from
mid-exponential phase cells grown in YNB media without
salt using a phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol method
modified for DNA isolation from filamentous fungi, as
previously described [30]. Partial sequences of the HOG1
orthologues from the halotolerant fungi were amplified
with touch-down PCR using the degenerate primers 5'AAR CAY YTI MGI CAY GAR AA-3' and 5'-ARD ATC TCI
SWR TAC ATC AT-3', corresponding to the conserved
amino-acid regions in the alignment of the known Hog1
fungal orthologues. Fifty ng of genomic DNA were used as
templates in 50 μL PCR reactions with Gotaq DNA
polymerase (Promega). PCR was performed by 22 touchdown cycles with an annealing temperature from 55°C to
44°C, followed by 22 cycles with annealing at 44°C. The
PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega) and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences have
been deposited in the GenBank database under the following
accession
numbers:
PtHOG1
[GenApHOG1
[GenBank:EF158007],
Bank:EF158008],

PCR with Gotaq DNA polymerase was performed using 1
μl cDNA for the 25 μl PCR reactions with primers specific
for HwHOG1 (5'-CGC AAA TGA CCG GTT ACG TCT
CGA-3' and 5'-CAG ATC CGC ATC GTT GAA GGA CCA3') and H. werneckii 28S rRNA (5'-CAT CAC TGT ACT TGT
TCG CTA TCG GTC-3' and 5'-GTA ACG GCG AGT GAA
GCG GC-3'). Hw28SRR was used as an internal standard
to control for variations in product abundance due to differences in individual RT-PCR reaction efficiencies. The
thermal cycling was programmed for 25 cycles, each consisting of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 63°C and 30 s at 72°C. We
empirically determined that the 25th cycle lies within the
optimal linear range of amplification by measuring the
concentrations of the PCR products also after the 22nd,
24th, 26th and 28th cycles. The PCR products were resolved
in agarose gels, documented by MiniBis (DNR BioImaging Systems), and the band intensities quantified with the
TotalLab gel analysis programme (Non-linear Dynamics).
Functional expression of HwHOG1 in S. cerevisiae and
stress-tolerance assays
For expression of HwHOG1 in S. cerevisiae, the corresponding ORF was amplified from H. werneckii cDNA
using the primers 5'-GGA TCC ATG GCG GAA TTC GTA
CGT G-3' and 5'-GGT ACC CTA ACC GGC CAC CGT GTC
AT-3' containing BamHI and KpnI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The resulting product was cloned into
BamHI/KpnI sites of the pRD53 low-copy-number plasmid (CEN, ARS, URA3, GAL1/10 promoter, AmpR), resulting in the pRD53-HwHOG1 plasmid. The cloned
HwHOG1 sequence was verified by sequencing. Yeast cells
were grown overnight in YPD media at 30°C in a rotary
shaker (180 rpm), to mid-exponential phase. They were
then transformed with 1 μg of the pRD53-HwHOG1 construct, using the alkali-cation yeast transformation kit
(Qbiogene), according to the manufacturer protocol. The
transformants were selected on YNB plates without uracil

(YNB-Ura). This media is the same as for YNB, except
CSM lacking uracil was added instead of the CSM mix.
For the stress-tolerance assays, positive colonies were
grown overnight to mid-exponential phase in YNB-Ura
medium, adjusted to an OD600 of 0.5, 10-fold serially
diluted (1–104 dilutions) with fresh medium, and spotted
in 3 μL onto YNB-Ura+Gal plates supplemented as indicated (NaCl, KCl, NaCl + pH 8.5, LiCl, sorbitol, pH 8.5).
The YNB-Ura+Gal plates contained 2% (w/v) galactose
instead of glucose. For the UV stress, the YNB-Ura+Gal
plates with spotted cultures were exposed to a UV dose of
50 J/m2. For the oxidative stress, the cultures were exposed
to 50 mM H2O2 for 2 min prior to plating. For the cold
shock, the YNB-Ura+Gal plates were incubated at 10°C,
and for the heat shock, at 37°C. Otherwise the plates were
incubated at 30°C for 3–5 days and the images were later
acquired by scanning.
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
Denaturated S. cerevisiae cell lysates were prepared as previously described [31]. Protein concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry at 590 nm by the Bradford
method with the Nanoquant reagent (Roth). Before loading, an amount of the cell fractions equal to 25 μg of protein was boiled for 5 min in 5× protein-loading buffer
(Fermentas). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in
10% NuPAGE polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Roth). Immunodetection
with polyclonal goat anti-Hog1 antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and polyclonal rabbit anti-goat secondary
antibodies conjugated with HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were performed using the ECL detection system
(Pierce).
Homology-based 3D molecular modelling
The 3D model of HwHog1 was built by homology-based
protein structure modelling with the MODELER 8v2 programme [25], which implements comparative modelling
by satisfaction of spatial restraints [27]. The input was the
crystallographic template structure of murine p38 [PDB:
1P38] and the HwHog1 sequence was aligned with this
structure. Ten slightly different 3D models of HwHog1
with all of the non-hydrogen atoms were obtained as output. The minimum-energy 3D model of HwHog1 was
chosen for the interpretation. This model was derived by
minimizing violations of distance and dihedral angle constraints extracted from the template structure. The 3D
model constructed passed the tests of the PROSAII [32]
and PROCHECK [33,34] programmes.
