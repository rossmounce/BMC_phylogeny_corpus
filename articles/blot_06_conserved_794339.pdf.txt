Abstract
Background: Retrovirus particles emerge from the assembly of two structural protein
components, Gag that is translated as a soluble protein in the cytoplasm of the host cells, and Env,
a type I transmembrane protein. Because both components are translated in different intracellular
compartments, elucidating the mechanisms of retrovirus assembly thus requires the study of their
intracellular trafficking.
Results: We used a CD25 (Tac) chimera-based approach to study the trafficking of Moloney
murine leukemia virus and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus Env proteins. We found that the cytoplasmic
tails (CTs) of both Env conserved two major signals that control a complex intracellular trafficking.
A dileucine-based motif controls the sorting of the chimeras from the trans-Golgi network (TGN)
toward endosomal compartments. Env proteins then follow a retrograde transport to the TGN
due to the action of a tyrosine-based motif. Mutation of either motif induces the mis-localization
of the chimeric proteins and both motifs are found to mediate interactions of the viral CTs with
clathrin adaptors.
Conclusion: This data reveals the unexpected complexity of the intracellular trafficking of
retrovirus Env proteins that cycle between the TGN and endosomes. Given that Gag proteins
hijack endosomal host proteins, our work suggests that the endosomal pathway may be used by
retroviruses to ensure proper encountering of viral structural Gag and Env proteins in cells, an
essential step of virus assembly.

Background
Retroviruses are surrounded by a lipid envelope acquired
by the virus from cellular membranes through a budding
process. Anchored in this lipid envelope are the viral envelope glycoproteins (Env), which are heterodimers
between a transmembrane subunit (TM) and a covalently
or non-covalently attached extracellular subunit (named
SU for surface). Both subunits emerge from the cleavage
of a single type-1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein
precursor (for review on retrovirus structural protein synthesis, see [1].
The Gag proteins precursor, simply referred to here as
Gag, is the only viral structural protein that is both necessary and sufficient to produce virus-like particles (VLPs)
by budding into the extracellular medium, even in the
absence of Env [2,3]. However, VLPs devoid of Env are
non infectious since Env glycoproteins are necessary for
the attachment of the virions to their receptor(s) and subsequent fusion of viral and target cell membranes leading
to virus entry. The Env precursor is co-translationally
anchored in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum
and then follows the trafficking of transmembrane and
soluble proteins along the secretory pathway. By contrast,
Gag is synthesized by free ribosomes in the cytosol, before
being able to bind to internal membranes through signals
in its amino-terminus. Given that both structural components are being translated in different subcellular compartments, some specific mechanisms must account for
their encounter at the site of virus assembly and budding.
Studying the precise steps of the intracellular trafficking of
envelope glycoproteins should then bring some understanding as to how they encounter Gag in cells. In the case
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Env, it has been
shown that the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the TM subunit
contains several motifs that regulate Env trafficking. A
tyrosine-based motif (YxxΦ where Φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino-acid) has been implicated in Env endocytosis
after its arrival at the cell surface by mediating interaction
with the AP-2 clathrin adaptor complexes [4-7]. A dileucine-based motif (consensus sequence LL or LΦ) has also
been shown to control some post-Golgi trafficking step by
recruiting the AP-1 adaptor complexes [5,8]. Finally, HIV
Env is also able to undergo a retrograde endosome to
trans-Golgi network (TGN) route through the interaction
of a diaromatic YW motif, located in the cytoplasmic
domain of Env, with the TIP47 protein [9].
The intracellular transport of HIV Env glycoproteins has
been extensively examined, however little is known about
the trafficking of envelope glycoproteins of retroviruses
that do not belong to the lentivirus genus. The cytoplasmic tails of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) and
Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env possess a

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/62

tyrosine-based motif that is able to target them to the
basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK cells [10].
Dileucine- and tyrosine-based motifs in the CT of bovine
leukemia virus (BLV) Env are responsible for low surface
expression of Env, although the details of Env intracellular
trafficking were not elucidated [11]. We have shown in a
previous study that engrafting the CTs of different retrovirus Env to the carboxy-terminus of the CD25 reporter
molecule leads to specific intracellular trafficking pathways of the resulting chimeras [12]. Indeed, HTLV, BLV
and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) CD25 chimeras are endocytosed after reaching the cell surface, whereas chimeras
containing either MLV or Mason-Pfizer monkey virus
(MPMV) CT appeared mainly retained inside the cells in a
Rab6-positive Golgi or post-Golgi compartment.
In this study, we aimed to precisely define the intracellular
routes followed by MLV and MPMV envelope glycoproteins. Using the same CD25 chimera-based approach, we
found that these proteins accumulated in the TGN as a
result of a dynamic transport involving a retrograde route
from endosomes to the TGN. A membrane proximal
dileucine-based motif and a more distal tyrosine-based
motif conserved between both CTs governed this peculiar
trafficking. The dileucine-based motif is implicated in the
sorting of the chimeras at the level of the TGN, whereas
the tyrosine-based motif is required in the retrograde
transport step. We also documented that both motif
mediate in vitro interaction with clathrin adaptors, linking
their functional role in Env trafficking with their capacity
to physically interact with cellular trafficking machineries.

Results
CD25-MuLV and CD25-MPMV chimera accumulated in
the TGN
We have previously shown that engrafting the cytoplasmic
tail of either MLV or MPMV envelope glycoprotein to the
carboxyl-terminus of the CD25 protein induced the intracellular retention of the resulting chimeras [12]. Both chimeras colocalized at steady state with the small GTPase
Rab6, a protein distributed between the Golgi apparatus
and the TGN [13,14].

To define more precisely the intracellular site of accumulation of the chimeras, we treated transiently transfected
HeLa cells with cycloheximide, which acted by preventing
new synthesis of proteins. CD25-MuLV and CD25-MPMV
chimeras appeared then mainly concentrated in a tubularshaped perinuclear compartment as well as in dots dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (figure 1, CD25 panels)
whereas the control CD25 protein accumulated at the cell
surface (data not shown and [12]).
We then compared the distribution of the chimeras with
those of different intracellular markers: the Mannose-6-

phosphate receptor of 46kDa (MPR46) that cycles
between the TGN and late endosomes and is mainly localized in the TGN at steady state [15], internalized cyanin3conjugated transferrin that reveals the general early and
recycling endosomal pathway and Lamp1, a marker of lysosomes [16]. CD25-MLV and CD25-MPMV did not colocalize with either endocytosed transferrin or Lamp1,
indicating that they do not accumulate in the endocytic
pathway (figure 1B and 1C). By contrast, both proteins
showed extensive colocalization with MPR46 revealing
that their intracellular compartment of retention is the
TGN (figure 1A).
A dileucine- and a tyrosine-based motifs are both required
for the TGN localization of CD25-MuLV and CD25-MPMV
chimeras
To define the motifs in MLV and MPMV cytoplasmic tails
important for this peculiar localization, we compared
their primary sequences (figure 2A). The two sequences
shared 10 amino acids conserved in position, amongst
which two clusters fit potential conventional sorting signals: the dileucine-based motifs 3LV4/3LM4 and the tyro-

sine-based motif 23YHQL26/23YHRL26 in MLV and MPMV
sequences respectively (where 1 is the position of the first
amino-acid in each viral cytoplasmic tail). MPMV cytoplasmic tail possesses a second tyrosine-based motif
(35YLTL38) that is not conserved in the MLV cytoplasmic
domain.
To investigate the implication of these putative sorting
motifs in the trafficking of the chimeras, we produced a
diversity of point mutations in the cytoplasmic tails by
site-directed mutagenesis (figure 2B). We then analyzed
the effects of these mutations on the intracellular localization of the resulting mutated chimeras. Mutation of the
tyrosine 23 to serine in either MLV and MPMV CT provoked a relocalization of the chimeras to peripheral dots
dispersed throughout the cytoplasm that do not colocalize with MPR46 (figure 3A). By contrast, mutation of the
distal 35YLTL38 tyrosine-based motif in MPMV cytoplasmic tail had no effects (figure 3A lower panels). Changing
the leucine 3 into a serine resulted in a partial shift of the
localization of the chimeras from the TGN to peripheral
dots and the mutated chimeras still colocalized to some

extent with MPR46 (figure 3B). Finally, MLV and MPMV
chimeras mutated on both leucine 3 and tyrosine 23
mainly accumulated at the plasma membrane (figure 3C),
thus behaving as the control CD25.
Thus, extensive localization of the CD25-MLV and the
CD25-MPMV chimeras in the TGN required both the
dileucine-based motif in position 3 and the tyrosinebased motif in position 23. By contrast, the tyrosine-based
motif in position 35 of the MPMV cytoplasmic tail does
not play a significant role in the TGN localization of the
protein.
CD25-MLV and CD25-MPMV with mutated dileucine- or
tyrosine-based motifs accumulate in different endocytic
compartments
We then assess whether the changes in localization of the
CD25-MLV and CD25-MPMV chimeras that we observed
after mutating either the dileucine- or the tyrosine-based
motif revealed a relocalization of the protein in endocytic
compartments. We used internalized transferrin as a
marker of early/recycling endosomes, Lamp1 as a marker
of lysosomes and dextran internalized for 30 minutes and
chased for an equivalent amount of time to reveal late
endosomal compartments.

Chimeras with mutations in the dileucine-based motif
showed partial colocalization with the three markers of
the endosomal pathway (figure 4A, 4B and 4C, arrows).
Colocalization of chimeras with Lamp1, however, is
weaker than with endocytosed transferrin or dextran.
Thus, the fraction of L3S mutated chimeras that is delocalized from the TGN is redistributed throughout the endosomal pathway. By contrast, chimeras bearing the Y23S
mutation did not colocalize with either transferrin or
Lamp1 (figure 5A and 5C), indicating that they are absent
from early/recycling endosomes or lysosomes. However,
these mutant proteins did colocalize to some extent with
internalized and chased dextran (figure 5B, arrows). Thus,
mutation of the tyrosine-based motif in position 23
induced the relocalization of both CD25-MLV and CD25MPMV chimeras in non well-defined late endosomal
compartments.
Internalization of chimeras from the plasma membrane is
mainly driven by the tyrosine-based motif in position 23
That the chimeras are mainly detected in intracellular sites
at steady state could either reflect an active retention of the
proteins within the cells or their slow recycling to the
plasma membrane followed by their rapid internalization. We thus wanted to determine whether the chimeras
could be endocytosed from the plasma membrane. To
that extent, we compared the abilities of the different WT
and mutant chimeras to allow uptake of monoclonal antiCD25 antibody. Transiently-transfected HeLa cells were

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/62

then incubated for 30 min at 4°C with anti-CD25 antibody and shifted or not at 37°C for 30 additional minutes. For each chimera, we then compared the amount of
anti-CD25 antibody remaining at the cell surface after 30
minutes at 37°C relative to the amount of anti-CD25 at
the cell surface at time 0.
After 30 minutes, approximately 50% of bound antiCD25 antibody was internalized in cells expressing either
CD25-MLV or CD25-MPMV chimeras. This is similar to
the amount of CD25 internalized in cells expressing
CD25-TFR, a control chimera containing the well defined
YRTF endocytic signal of the transferrin receptor (figure
6A and 6B). By contrast, the CD25 control protein that
lacks specific internalization signals or viral cytoplasmic
tail does not allow measurable uptake of anti-CD25 antibody. This indicates that viral cytoplasmic tails in CD25MLV and CD25-MPMV chimeras contain specific internalization signals.
Mutation of the dileucine-based motifs in MLV or MPMV
chimera did not impair the capacity of the proteins to
mediate specific uptake anti-CD25 antibody (fig 6A and
6B; L3S). By contrast, chimeras bearing the Y23S mutation
had a decreased ability to allow anti-CD25 antibody
retrieval from the cell surface (figure 6A and 6B). Chimeras bearing both L3S and Y23S mutations behave like the
single Y23S mutant indicating that the lack of detectable
effects of the single L3S mutation was not due to redundancy with the Y23 tyrosine-based motif.
Altogether, these results indicate that CD25-MLV and
CD25-MPMV chimeras are internalized from the plasma
membrane, and that the tyrosine-based motif in position
23 acts as their main endocytosis signal.
The tyrosine-based motif in position 23 drives a retrograde
transport step toward the TGN
The steady state TGN localization of proteins like MPRs,
furin or TGN38 is the results of a complex trafficking
involving a retrograde transport from endosomes to the
TGN [15,17]. We thus assessed the capacity of MLV and
MPMV cytoplasmic tails to target the chimeras to the TGN
following their internalization in endosomes.

One hour after their internalization from the cell surface,
anti-CD25 antibodies taken up by either the CD25-MLV
or CD25-MPMV chimera were found concentrated in a
perinuclear region of the cells (figure 7A). Both chimeras
then extensively colocalized with MPR46, indicating that
they reached the TGN (figure 7A). By contrast, anti-CD25
taken up by the control CD25-TFR construct that follows
the recycling pathway of the transferrin receptor did not
colocalize with MPR46 (figure 7A), indicating that both
MLV and MPMV cytoplasmic tails contain specific infor-

Mutation of the dileucine motif in position 3 did not drastically affect the capacity of the chimeras to be targeted to
the TGN following internalization (Figure 7B). By contrast, chimeras mutated in the tyrosine-based motif in
position 23 appeared localized in dispersed dots throughout the cytoplasm after their internalization. No colocalization was then apparent with MPR46 (Figure 7C).

Effectsto be retrieved from themutations on the chimeras
Effects of the L3S and/or Y23S mutations on the chimeras ability to be retrieved from the plasma membrane. HeLa cells were cotransfected with GFP vector and
with the appropriate A MLV or B MPMV chimera cDNA.
Cells were then incubated for 1 hour at 4C with anti-CD25
antibody before being either shifted for 30 min at 37°C or
not. Anti-CD25 stainings were revealed using phycoerythrine-conjugated secondary antibodies. Stained cells were analyzed using flow cytometry excluding the none transfected
GFP-negative cells. We then plotted the percentage of internalization as the ratio between the CD25-associated fluorescence that disappeared during the 30 min uptake at 37°C and
the CD25-associated fluorescence at time 0. CD25 is the reference protein without any viral cytoplasmic tail (negative
control) and CD25-TFR is the CD25 reference protein in the
cytoplasmic tail of which the well described YTRF endocytosis motif of the transferrin receptor has been inserted (positive control).

Altogether, these data indicate that the TGN localization
of the MLV and MPMV chimeras is the result of a complex
trafficking involving retrieval of these proteins from endosomal compartments towards the TGN. This last step is
driven by the tyrosine-based motif in position 23 that is
conserved between both retroviruses.
MLV cytoplasmic tail interacts with adaptor protein
complexes (AP) 1, 2 and 3
To better understand the molecular basis of the intracellular sorting of the viral chimeras, we assessed the ability of
the viral CT to physically interact with components of the
adaptor protein complexes AP-1, AP-2 and AP-3 in a yeast
two-hybrid assay. Because we have shown that both MLV
and MPMV Env share the same trafficking, we decided to
restrict our biochemical analysis to one virus. Thus, MLV
CT was fused to the N-terminus of the LexA binding
domain (BD), whereas the µ1, γ and β1 chains of AP1, the
µ2, α and β2 chains of AP2 and the µ3, δ and β3 chains of
AP3 were fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD). MLV
CT did not interact with γ or β1 subunits of AP1, α or β2
subunits of AP2, or δ and β3 subunits of AP3 in yeast twohybrid system (data not shown). By contrast, MLV CT
bound to µ1, µ2 and µ3 medium chains as indicated by
the expression of the HIS3 reporter gene, which allows cell
growth in the absence of histidine (figure 8A, 8B and 8C).
However, interaction with µ2 only appeared after 72
hours growth (figure 8B), whereas interaction with µ1 and
µ3 were present after 30 hours growth (figure 8A and 8C),
indicating that binding to µ2 was weaker than the other
interactions.

Mutation of the tyrosine in position 23 completely abolished interaction of the MLV CT with all three µ1, µ2 and
µ3 chains of AP complexes (figure 8A, 8B and 8C). On the
contrary, mutation of the leucine in position 3 did not
affect interaction with any of the µ chains (figure 8A, 8B
and 8C). These results therefore indicate the tyrosine 23 is
critical for binding of the MLV cytoplasmic tail to the isolated µ subunits, and further demonstrate the specificity
of these interactions.
We then examined whether a GST fusion of the MLV CT
was able to recruit the whole preformed AP complexes

The tyrosine-based motif in position 23 allows the chimera to follow a retrograde route from endosomes to
TGN. HeLa cells were transfected with A wild type, B L3S mutated or C Y23S mutated chimeras. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide for 2 h. Chimeras present on cell surface were stained with the anti-CD25
antibody at 4°C for 1 hour and cells were then shifted at 37°C for another hour. After fixation, internalized anti-CD25 was
revealed using FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, and MPR46 was revealed as in figure 1.

Interaction
Interaction of the MLV TM-CD with µ1, µ2 and µ3 subunits in the yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast reporter
strain L40 was co-transformed with plasmids encoding Gal4 AD-µ1, µ2 and µ3-adaptin (A, B and C, respectively), and plasmids encoding lexA BD fused to either the wild type (WT) or mutated (L3S, Y23S) cytoplasmic tail of MLV. Cotransformants
were analyzed for histidine auxotrophy. They were patched on medium with histidine and then replica-plated on medium without histidine (- His medium). Growth in the absence of histidine indicates interaction between hybrid proteins. The positive
control was the interaction between Ras and Raf proteins which bind to each other efficiently (lane 4, lower patch in panels A,
B, C). Binding specificity was verified by the absence of interaction between the retroviral cytoplasmic tails (WT, L3S and Y23S)
and the Gal4AD alone (none).

from HeLa cells lysates. AP1, AP2 and AP3 complexes
were revealed using antibodies to γ-adaptin, α-adaptin
and δ-adaptin, respectively. Immunoblot analysis of the
cellular proteins retained on GST-MLV beads indicated
that AP1, AP2 and AP3 bound specifically to the viral cytoplasmic tail (figure 9A, 9B and 9C). Mutation of either the
tyrosine 23 or the leucine 3 affected the binding of the
resulting GST-MLV to the AP2 complex (figure 9B). Interestingly, mutating the leucine 3 strongly affected the binding to AP1 and AP3, whereas mutation of the tyrosine 23
had no effect (figure 9A and 9C).
We thus showed that MLV cytoplasmic tail interacts not
only with the µ chains of clathrin adaptors type 1, 2 and
3, but also associates with the AP complexes from cell
lysates. Optimal interaction with AP2 requires both the
dileucine- and the tyrosine-based motif in position 3 and
23, respectively. On the other hand, interactions with AP1
and AP3 complexes depend only on the dileucine-based
motif.

Discussion
In this study, we analyzed the intracellular trafficking of
two oncoretroviral envelope proteins, these of MLV and
MPMV retroviruses. Their peculiar trafficking resulted in
the dynamic intracellular retention of the proteins in the
TGN and was driven by the association of two conventional sorting signals conserved in position between the
two envelope glycoprotein cytoplasmic tails: a membrane
proximal dileucine-based motif (3LV4/3LM4 in MLV and
MPMV sequences respectively) and a more distal tyrosinebased motif (23YHQL26/23YHRL26).
To evaluate the roles of the CT of MLV and MPMV envelope glycoproteins in regulating their trafficking, we used
an approach based on the study of chimeras between the
whole CD25 chain and the cytoplasmic tail of retroviral
Env proteins. Study of CD25 chimeras is a broadly used
approach to assess the role of the cytoplasmic tail of different cellular proteins in their trafficking [17-19]. We and
others have used this approach to study the trafficking of
different retroviral glycoproteins [5,9,11,12]. Using CD25
chimeras permitted us to conduct a comparative work and
to avoid complications inherent to the use of native viral
envelope glycoproteins such, as shedding of the SU subunit in the extracellular medium or cytopathogenic effects
due to envelope induced cell-cell fusion. Importantly, we

previously demonstrated that native viral glycoproteins
displayed the same intracellular trafficking as their chimeras counterparts, thus legitimazing the use of this
approach [8,9,12].
We previously showed that CD25-MLV and CD25-MPMV
chimera appeared retained in an intracellular tubularshaped perinuclear compartment [12]. We now show that
this compartment is distinct from the early/recycling
endosomes or lysosomes and is enriched with the MPR46
protein. MPR46 mediates the transport of lysosomal
enzymes from the TGN to endosomal prelysosomal compartments. After delivery of its cargo in acidic compartments, MPR returns to the TGN [20]. At steady state,
MPR46 is found in the TGN, although a fraction may be
found in endosomes [21,22]. We therefore concluded that
the majority of CD25-MLV and CD25-MPMV localized in
the TGN.
The TGN localization of both chimeras was dependent on
the integrity of two sorting motifs. Mutating the dileucinebased motif in position 3 resulted in a partial delocalization of the chimeras throughout the endosomal pathway,
without affecting their capacity to follow the retrograde
route to the TGN when internalized from the plasma
membrane. By contrast, mutation of the tyrosine-based
motif in position 23 totally abolished the TGN localization of the chimeras, as well as their ability to be retrieved
from endosomes to the TGN. The Y23S mutated chimeras
then appeared accumulated in an endosomal compartment. Because this compartment was stained after internalization of dextran followed by a chase and was distinct
from the early/recycling endosomes and lysosomes, we
conclude that it must represent some late endosomal
compartment. This compartment, however, did not contain CD63, a typical marker for late endosmes/multivesicular bodies (data not shown) and its exact nature remains
to be identified. Regardless, these data allow us to propose
the following model for the complex intracellular trafficking of the CD25-MLV and CD25-MPMV chimeras:
While exiting the biosynthetic pathway at the TGN level,
the chimeric proteins are sorted to a specific late endosomal compartment. This sorting step involves the dileucine-based motif and mutation of this motif results in
misrouting the proteins throughout the endosomal pathway (Table 1). Alternatively, Env proteins can also reach

the late endosomal compartment after internalization
from the plasma membrane. Once the chimeras reach the
specific late endosomal compartment, their tyrosinebased motif in position 23 mediates their trafficking in a
retrograde pathway up to the TGN. If the tyrosine-based
motif is mutated, the chimeras accumulate in the late
endosomal compartment (Table 1). On the contrary, the
wild type chimeras continuously cycle between endosomes and the TGN. The fact that chimeric proteins
appear accumulated in the TGN at steady state indicates
that the limiting step of their trafficking is the sorting
event at the TGN level. Lastly, chimeras that make it to the
plasma membrane are being internalized and delivered
back to the TGN, both steps implicating the tyrosinebased motif in position 23 (Table 1).
This model is reinforced by the biochemical study we conducted on the MLV tail. Indeed, GST pull down assays
confirmed that the dileucine-based motif is important for
interaction with AP1 and AP3 complexes that are implicated in sorting cargos at the TGN level (review in [23]),
whereas the tyrosine-based motif is somehow dispensable
for this process. On the contrary both dileucine- and tyrosine-based motifs are important for the optimal recruitment of the AP2 complexes that function in endocytosis
[24]. However, the direct interaction we detected in yeast
two-hybrid between MLV cytoplasmic tail and the µ2
chain of AP2 appeared weaker than interaction with µ1 or
µ3. This is consistent with our findings that trafficking of
CD25-MLV chimeras is mainly restricted between intracellular compartments and that the MLV tyrosine-based
signal is not optimized for the binding to the AP2 complexes. These findings nevertheless indicate that when the
chimeras eventually reach the plasma membrane, they
can be cleared from cell surface following endocytosis.
Our biochemical data does not elucidate how the tyrosine-based motif in position 23 mediates the retrograde
route of the CD25-MLV and CD25-MPMV chimeras from
late endosomal compartment to the TGN. One retrograde
transport pathway to TGN involves the AP1 clathrin adaptor [25,26]. In our yeast two-hybrid experiments, we elucidated an interaction between the µ1 chain of AP1 and
MLV cytoplasmic tail. This interaction depended on the
integrity of the tyrosine-based motif in position 23. In our
GST pull down assay, however, the tyrosine 23 appears
dispensable for the interaction with AP1 complexes. These
contrasting results might indicate that, although the tyrosine-based motif is capable to bind the isolated µ chains
of AP complexes in the yeast two-hybrid system, it might
not be able to mediate the interaction with the whole AP1
complex. Alternatively, it is also possible that the interaction of the MLV and MPMV Env CTs with AP1 complexes
during the retrograde transport might involve additional
informations, like other determinants located in the Env

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/62

CTs. Another possibility is that the tyrosine-based motif
functions in the retrograde transport by recruiting other
adaptors than AP1. Indeed, different retrograde pathways
have been described for the furin and MPRs proteins. Retrograde transport of the furin protein involves an interaction of an acid cluster of amino-acids with the adaptor
protein PACS1 [27,28] while retrograde transport of the
MPRs requires either interaction of a motif constituted by
two successive aromatic amino-acids (MPR46) or by prolines (MPR300) with the TIP47 adaptor [29,30]. None of
these kinds of motifs can be found in either MLV or
MPMV cytoplasmic tails suggesting that these viral proteins follow a different retrograde route using an
unknown mechanism or use new motifs to interact with
these adaptors. Formal demonstration of this would however require more biochemical analysis to directly test the
interaction of MLV and MPMV cytoplasmic tails with
PACS1 and TIP47.
Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that Epsin R can
recruit clathrin either directly or through AP1 [31-34].
This recruitment is important for an AP1-independent retrograde pathway followed by TGN38 and MPR300 [35].
Because it has proposed that Espin R may function as a
cargo adaptor [36], further studies should also assess the
putative relationship between Epsin R and the retrograde
transport mediated by MLV and MPMV cytoplasmic tails.
The dileucine 3- and tyrosine 23-based motifs in MLV and
MPMV cytoplasmic tails are very similar to each other in
term of sequence and are conserved in position (Fig 2).
Nevertheless, MLV and MPMV infect different hosts,
belong to two different retrovirus genuses and appear
highly divergent on a phylogenetic tree. We can thus postulate that these two motifs and the intracellular trafficking they regulate must be essential for efficient replication
and propagation of these viruses. We and others have
shown that, regardless of whether they are from the
oncoretrovirus or the lentivirus family, all retrovirus envelope glycoproteins follow complex intracellular routes
[5,8-10,12]. It has been proposed that these different
intracellular trafficking routes were part of mechanisms
allowing the virus to escape the host immune response by
limiting the amount of antigenic envelope glycoproteins
at the cell surface of infected cells. Thus, a simian immunodeficiency virus bearing a mutation in the tyrosine-based
endocytosis signal of its envelope glycoproteins is attenuated in vivo [37], although envelope incorporation into
virions and virions infectivity are both normal in vitro
[38]. Moreover, mutation of the same tyrosine-based
endocytosis signal in HIV enhances the immunogenicity
of a vaccine preparation, in correlation with enhanced
surface expression of the protein [39]. However, the fact
that the intracellular trafficking pathways we describe are
much more complex than just endocytosis suggests that

Page 14 of 19

Retrovirology 2006, 3:62

they play other roles than just limiting the amount of
envelope glycoproteins present at the cell surface.
In the last few years, it was demonstrated that the Gag
polyproteins of retroviruses hijack various host proteins
and use them for assembly and budding of particles
(reviewed in [2,3]). All the cellular factors described so far
to participate in this phenomenon are proteins that function in different stages of the endosomal trafficking:
Nedd4 [40-42], Tsg101 and other ESCRT-1 components
[40,42-44], AIP1/ALIX [45], AP2 [46] and AP3 [47].
Growing number of evidence indicate that Gag proteins
are transported along the endosomal pathway prior to
assembly and budding [42,47-56]. Thus, targeting envelope glycoproteins in the endosomal pathway might help
Env encountering Gag and being subsequently incorporated in the nascent virion. That Env glycoproteins constantly traffic in a cycling pathway between TGN and
endosomes as we described here would furthermore allow
them to wait inside the cell until they encounter the Gag
proteins in endosomes, and are subsequently rerouted to
be incorporated into budding particles.
Supporting this hypothesis, it has been shown that HIV-1
envelope glycoproteins also follow an anterograde/retrograde pathway and that this trafficking step is required for
optimal incorporation of Env into virions and subsequent
infectivity of the virus [9]. We also found that bovine
leukemia virus envelope cytoplasmic tail possesses dileucine- and tyrosine-based motifs that drive its trafficking in
a TGN-endosome cycling pathway (Blot et al, unpublished data). Finally, the tyrosine-based motifs in position
23 in the cytoplasmic tail of MLV and MPMV envelope
glycoproteins, which we found are necessary to maintain
the protein in the endosomes to the TGN retrograde route,
are also necessary for efficient incorporation of Env into
virus particles [57,58].
Finally, regulated Env intracellular trafficking might also
be important for intracellular Gag sorting and subsequent
efficient virus release. Indeed, it has been shown that Env
can influence Gag intracellular localization for both MLV
[53] and MPMV [48]. MLV can be released in a polarized
manner and this process depends on the integrity of the
tyrosine-based motif in Env CT [10,59]. MPMV follows
the Type-D assembly pathway in which Gag pre-assembled in the cytoplasm. It has been recently shown that preassembled MPMV Gag are localized on pericentriolar
microdomains and Env is required to promote Gag transport out of this perinuclear site [48]. It will thus be of great
interests to test the importance of Env tyrosine-based and
dileucine-based motifs in this process. It was long thought
that the whole process of retrovirus assembly occurs at the
plasma membrane of infected cells. Accumulating evidence now complicates this simple scheme and suggests

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/62

that retroviruses developed strategies ensuring the specific
sorting of their structural proteins into intracellular compartments. These complex routes may be viewed as a funnel, concentrating the different structural components of
the viruses from their synthesis sites dispersed throughout
the cell towards a unique platform of assembly. The discovery of such mechanisms may provide new targets to
develop antiretroviral drugs. Understanding the precise
mechanisms that underlie the transport of viral proteins
inside the cells and their interactions with host cell factors
during assembly and budding appears then as an important future challenge for retrovirology.

Conclusion
We found here that two unrelated retroviruses, MLV and
MPMV, share the capacity to acutely regulate the trafficking of their envelope glycoprotein inside the cells. Env
intracellular trafficking involves a cycling loop between
the TGN and endosomes. Due to the presence of dileucine- and tyrosine-based motifs conserved in sequence
and position in MLV and MPMV Env cytoplasmic tails,
Env interact with clathrin adaptors. Thus, both structural
Gag and Env proteins hijack the host cell machinery
involved in trafficking in the endosomal pathway, which
could be used as an assembly platform.

Methods
Plasmids and cells
The CD25, CD25-TFR, CD25-MLV and CD25-MPMV chimeras were previously described [12]. Mutagenesis was
performed by PCR using the Quickchange™ Site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions and plasmids were then sequenced by
automatic sequencing (sequencing core facility, Institut
Cochin, Paris, France). The amino acid sequences of the
resulting chimeric proteins are shown in Fig. 2B.

HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS), gentamycine and 2 mM L-glutamine. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium
phosphate procedure. For indirect immunofluorescence
assays, 2.104 cells plated per well of 24-well plates were
transfected with 300 ng (steady state analysis) or 500 ng
(antibody uptake assays) plasmid. The total quantity of
DNA was normalized to 1 µg by adding empty vector
(pcDNA3). For flow cytometry analysis, 7.105 HeLa cells
plated in 100 mm dishes were co-transfected with 4 µg of
chimera encoding plasmid and 2 µg of pEGFP1 vector
(Clontech), which allowed the detection of transfected
cells by the expression of green-fluorescent protein (GFP).
The total amount of DNA was normalized to 10 µg by
adding empty vector.

Antibodies and Fluorescent Reagents
The 7G7B6 and 2A3A1H monoclonal antibodies (MAb)
directed to CD25 were obtained from ascites fluids (gift of
A. Dautry-Varsat, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The antiMPR46 is an affinity purified rabbit serum provided by S.
Höning (University of Göttingen, Germany)[22]. The
anti-Lamp 1 MAb coupled to FITC was purchased from
Pharmingen (San Diego CA, USA). The transferrin receptor was revealed using cyanine 3-conjugated human transferrin (gift of A. Dautry-Varsat, Institut Pasteur, Paris,
France). The FITC-conjugated dextran was purchased
from Molecular Probes.
Intracellular staining and confocal microscopy
Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells grown on glass
coverslips (Polylabo, France) were treated with cycloheximide (500 µM) (Sigma) for 3 h before fixation for 15 min
in PBS-4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, and
quenching for 15 min in PBS-0.1 M glycine. Cells were
then permeabilized for 40 min with PBS containing
0.05% saponin and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
(permeabilizing buffer). CD25 chimeras and human
MPR46 marker were co-stained using the anti-CD25
7G7B6 MAb (ascites fluid, 1/500 dilution in permeabilizing buffer) and anti-MPR46 affinity purified rabbit antiserum (1/500) for 1 h. After washes, the staining was
revealed using FITC-coupled goat anti-mouse Ig and cyanine 3-coupled goat anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., 1/300). Cells were mounted in
mowiol (Calbiochem, California, USA) and examined
under a confocal microscope (MRC-1024, Bio Rad). All
images presented are single slices from median sections of
cells.

For colocalization with Lamp-1, cells were saturated using
non immune murine sera (1/100, in permeabilizing
buffer) following the CD25 staining. Lamp-1 was then
revealed by a 1 h incubation with 1/50 dilution of FITCconjugated anti-lamp-1 MAb (Pharmingen, CA, USA) in
permeabilizing buffer complemented with a 1/50 dilution of non-immune murine sera. Late endosomal compartments were revealed by incubating living transfected
cells with FITC-conjugated dextran (2 mg/ml in complete
medium) for 30 min at 37°C followed by a 30 min chase
using complete medium, whereas early/recycling compartments were stained after a 30 min internalization of
cyanin3-conjugated transferrin (100 nM in serum free
medium). Cells were then fixed and CD25 chimeras were
revealed as described above.
Flow cytometry
Cells were collected 48 hours after transfection by incubation with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA for 10 min, pelleted
and suspended in ice-cold PBS. They were then incubated
for 1 h with the anti-CD25 2A3A1H MAb (ascites fluid, 1/

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/62

2000) in 100 µl of PBS at 4°C, washed 2× with chilled
PBS, and stained with phycoerythrine conjugated goat
anti-mouse Ig (Caltag, California, USA) for 1 h at 4°C.
The cells were washed and fixed in PBS containing 2% formaldehyde (FAD), and analyzed by flow cytometry after
gating on the GFP-positive population.
Internalization assay
Transfected cells were collected as described above, incubated with the anti-CD25 2A3A1H MAb (ascites fluid, 1/
2000) for 1 h on ice, and washed in chilled PBS. Cells
were then either kept at 4°C (t = 0) or shifted to 37°C for
30 min, rapidly cooled to 4°C and washed once (t = 30).
MAbs bound to the cell surface were then revealed by
incubation with phycoerythrine-coupled goat anti-mouse
Ig for 1 h at 4°C. After two washes with chilled PBS, cells
were fixed in PBS-2% FAD and analyzed by flow cytometry. GFP-negative cells were excluded from the analysis.
The internalization of chimeras was estimated as follow:
[(mfit = 0)-(mfit = 30)]/[(mfit = 0)-(mfineg)] × 100, where mfit
is the mean fluorescence intensity of cells harvested after
incubation for either 0 min or 30 min at 37°C and mfineg
is the background staining without primary antibody.
Analysis of the retrograde transport
For analysis of the endosome-to-TGN retrograde transport, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with 500 ng
chimera expressing vectors and analyzed 48 h after transfection. Cells were treated 2 h with cycloheximide (500
µM) and incubated with the 7G7B6 MAb (1/500 in
chilled PBS) for 1 h on ice. Then cells were shifted at 37°C
in complete medium containing cycloheximide for 1 h,
fixed and permeabilized as described above. The TGN
compartment was revealed by anti-MPR46 affinity purified rabbit serum (1/500), followed by a co-incubation of
FITC conjugate anti-mouse Ig (1/300) and cyanine 3 conjugate anti-rabbit Ig (1/300).
Yeast two-hybrid assays
DNA fragment encoding MLV cytoplasmic tail (amino
acid residues 1 to 33; Figure 2A) was generated by PCR
and cloned in frame with the LexA binding domain (BD)
into the pFBL2-3 vector, a gift of J. Camonis (Institut
Curie, Paris), (pFBL-MLV). Point mutations of the tyrosine 23 and leucine 3 residues were introduced by PCRbased site-directed mutagenesis using the appropriate
primers to generate the following constructs: pFBL-MLVL3S, pFBL-MLV-Y23S. Mutations were verified by DNA
sequencing. Plasmids for expressing the µ1, γ and β1
chains of AP1 complex, the µ2, α and β2 chains of AP2
and the µ3, δ and β 3 chains of AP3 fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD) in the pACTII vector were kindly provided by J. S. Bonifacino (NIH, Bethesda, MD) [7] and M.
Robinson (University of Cambridge, Cambridge) [60].

were co-transformed with the indicated LexA BD and Gal4
AD expression vectors, and plated on selective medium
lacking tryptophan and leucine. Double transformants
were patched on the same medium and then analyzed for
histidine auxotrophy by replica-plating on selective
medium lacking tryptophan, leucine and histidine [5].
GST-pull down assays
DNA fragment containing the cytoplasmic tail of MLV was
obtained by PCR and cloned in-frame with GST (glutathione S-transferase) into the pGex-2TH vector to generate
pGex-MLV. Point mutations of the essential L3 and Y23
residues were introduced by PCR and the following constructs were obtained: pGex-MLV-L3S, pGex-MLV-Y23S.

Bacterially-expressed GST chimeric proteins and unfused
GST (control) were purified and immobilized on GSHagarose beads as previously described [5]. Coomassie blue
staining of polyacrylamide gel was used to control that the
beads were coated with the same amount of GST recombinant proteins. GST-fusion proteins (5 µg) immobilized
on GSH-agarose beads were incubated 1h at 4°C in PBS
containing 2 mg/ml BSA and 0.05% Tween. HeLa cells
were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM
NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). HeLa cell lysates
corresponding to 2.5.107 cells were incubated overnight at
4°C with 5 µg GST fusion proteins or GST control immobilized on GSH-agarose beads. The beads were then
washed five times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were
eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE and revealed by Western
blotting with anti-γ adaptin mAb (Transduction laboratories), anti-α adaptin mAb (clone 100/2, Sigma) and antiδ adaptin mAb (Transduction laboratories).
