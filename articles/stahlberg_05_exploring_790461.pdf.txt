Abstract
Background: Microarray analysis is attractive within the field of endocrine research because regulation of gene
expression is a key mechanism whereby hormones exert their actions. Knowledge discovery and testing of hypothesis
based on information-rich expression profiles promise to accelerate discovery of physiologically relevant hormonal
mechanisms of action. However, most studies so-far concentrate on the analysis of actions of single hormones and few
examples exist that attempt to use compilation of different hormone-regulated expression profiles to gain insight into
how hormone act to regulate tissue physiology. This report illustrates how a meta-analysis of multiple transcript profiles
obtained from a single tissue, the liver, can be used to evaluate relevant hypothesis and discover novel mechanisms of
hormonal action. We have evaluated the differential effects of Growth Hormone (GH) and estrogen in the regulation of
hepatic gender differentiated gene expression as well as the involvement of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins
(SREBPs) in the hepatic actions of GH and thyroid hormone.
Results: Little similarity exists between liver transcript profiles regulated by 17-α-ethinylestradiol and those induced by
the continuos infusion of bGH. On the other hand, strong correlations were found between both profiles and the female
enriched transcript profile. Therefore, estrogens have feminizing effects in male rat liver which are different from those
induced by GH. The similarity between bGH and T3 were limited to a small group of genes, most of which are involved
in lipogenesis. An in silico promoter analysis of genes rapidly regulated by thyroid hormone predicted the activation of
SREBPs by short-term treatment in vivo. It was further demonstrated that proteolytic processing of SREBP1 in the
endoplasmic reticulum might contribute to the rapid actions of T3 on these genes.
Conclusion: This report illustrates how a meta-analysis of multiple transcript profiles can be used to link knowledge
concerning endocrine physiology to hormonally induced changes in gene expression. We conclude that both GH and
estrogen are important determinants of gender-related differences in hepatic gene expression. Rapid hepatic thyroid
hormone effects affect genes involved in lipogenesis possibly through the induction of SREBP1 proteolytic processing.

Background
The completion of human and rodent genome sequences
[1-3] has brought the post-genomic era to the field of
endocrine research. Detailed genetic maps of the main
endocrine models can now be used to study the molecular
basis of endocrine disease and the molecular mechanisms
of hormone actions. The possibility to explore expression
data of thousands of genes across multiple experimental
paradigms promise to rapidly increase our understanding
of biological systems [4,5]. The acquisition of experimental data at a genomic scale requires high throughput technologies such as DNA microarray analysis. Microarrays
enable the simultaneous assessment of expression levels
of tens of thousands of gene products in an ease to perform assay. Microarrays are especially attractive to the
field of endocrine research because regulation of gene
expression is an important mechanism whereby hormones exert their physiological actions. This is obvious in
the case of steroid and thyroid hormones, which use intracellular receptors belonging to the nuclear receptor family
of transcription factors [6]. Peptide hormones also regulate gene expression after activating complex cascades of
intracellular signaling events upon binding to transmembrane receptors [7]. If the relation between hormones and
the expression of different genes could be annotated, the
abundant knowledge concerning endocrine physiology
might be used to clarify the biological function of those
genes. On the other hand, because expression profiles are
rich in information, they are suitable to study the complex
and pleitropic actions of hormones.
Here we analyzed a compilation of rat liver expression
profiles from experiments designed to study gender and
hormone actions in order to provide novel insight into
the mechanisms of action of specific hormones. The dataset used in this study comprises the actions of thyroid hormone (T3), 17-α-ethinylestradiol and GH in liver. The
data is freely available from the Endocrinology Gene
Expression Database – http://www.cmm.ki.se/EndoGED
and have also been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/. Using this collection of microarray data, we analyzed the differential
contribution of estrogens and GH to the regulation of gender differentiated liver gene expression. We also compared
the actions of GH and T3 in liver and found a small overlap comprising genes involved in lipogenesis suggesting
the common regulation of SREBP transcription factors.
The regulation of SREBP1 by GH and thyroid hormone
was analyzed.

Results
Exploring hormonal regulation of gene expression in liver
Several expression profiles where compiled and used to
obtain insight into the hormonal regulation of liver physiology. The following six experiments were analyzed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/5/8

together (Table 1): 17-α-ethinylestradiol treatment of
male rats, infusion of bGH in young (3 month) male rats
[8], infusion of hGH in old (2 years) male rats [9], bGH
treatment of primary hepatocytes isolated from young
male rats, comparison of female and male rats [8], and the
rapid effects of T3 treatment of hypothyroid mice [10].
The following questions were formulated: Can expression
profiling be used to clarify the physiological actions of
hormones in the liver? Can promoter analysis of hormonally regulated genes provide novel insight into the mechanism of hormone actions? It should be noted that our
intentions were not to exhaustively explore the data set
but rather to illustrate the utility of microarray data mining in endocrine research. The experiments included in
this analysis were not specifically designed to answer the
questions formulated in the present study although they
are sufficient to test our hypotheses. This mimics the situation when the experimental biologist try to derive knowledge from a set of disparate experiments performed in
different laboratories, using different experimental
designs and microarray technologies. Importantly, we
have taken all possible measures to minimize systematic
experimental errors. All the arrays used for analysis have
been fabricated in house from a unique set of PCR products and these have been validated in numerous studies
[7-15]. The protocols for labeling and data analysis were
also similar along all the experiments. Within each of the
experiments included in this analysis, we have accounted
for biological variability by independent replication of the
measurements using RNA from individual animals.
Unsupervised clustering algorithms were first used on the
entire dataset to gain a global view of different hormone
actions in liver. Average-linkage hierarchical clustering
(using Euclidean distance as measurement of similarity)
was used to evaluate the relation between the expression
profiles. As shown in Figure 1a, the effects induced by GH
treatment in young males were similar to those induced
by GH treatment in old animals. This observation supports the robustness of the GH effects since the designs of
the two experiments differ not only regarding the age of
the animals but also in the dose and type of hormone
administered (bovine versus human GH). A calculation of
the correlation coefficients between bGH-induced expression changes and the rest of the experiment groups supports this conclusion (Figure 1b). Interestingly, the
expression changes induced by GH treatment of primary
rat hepatocytes cultured on matrigel show a positive,
although small, correlation with the effects observed in
vivo (Figure 1a and 1b). This suggests that hepatocytes significantly contribute to the expression changes measured
in intact liver upon GH treatment. The fact that wellknown GH-regulated genes: insulin-like growth factor
1(IGF-1) and CYP2C12 [16] are also regulated in hepatocytes helps to substantiate our conclusion. The similar

The expression of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (Phyh), hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 1 (Hsd11b1), the catalytic subunit of protein
phosphatase 3, alpha isoform (Ppp3ca), fatty acid translocase/cd36 antigen (FAT/CD36) and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) 1a,
1c and 2 were measured using the primers shown in the Table. To allow comparison between samples, the expression data for each of the genes
was normalized to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which was always run in parallel.

effects on gene expression after in vivo or in vitro GH treatment were confirmed for some genes using quantitative
real-time PCR (Tables 2 and 3).
As shown in figure 1b, the correlation between GH treatment and thyroid hormone or estrogen treatment in
young males was rather low. This is not surprising since
both hormones have distinct liver functions not always
overlapping those of GH. Differences in expression can
also arise from the choice of treatment duration, dose and
mode of hormone treatment and this could result in the
underestimation of commonly regulated genes. This
ambiguity can only be resolved by measuring more
expression profiles in experiments specifically designed to
study hormonal interactions.
GH and estrogen contribute to gender differences in
hepatic gene expression
When we compared the gender-related expression differences to the rest of the experiments (Figure 1c, Table 4), it
was evident that as many as 48% of the female-enriched
transcripts were also up-regulated by continuous GH infu-

A comparison of all experiments included in the study. a) Hierarchical clustering of hepatic gene expression profiles
using average linkage analysis and the Euclidean distance metric clusters together the in vivo experiments concerning GH. The
included experiments were: E_male_5d: 17-α-ethinylestradiol treatment of male rats for 1 day, young_GH_7d: infusion of
bovine growth hormone (bGH) in young (3 months) male rats for 7 days, old_GH_21d: infusion of human growth hormone
(hGH) in old (2 years) male rats for 3 weeks, hep_GH_24h: bGH treatment of primary hepatocytes from young (2 months)
male rats for 24 hours, F/M_rat: comparison of untreated female and malerat livers, and T3_2h: thyroid hormone treatment of
hypothyroid mice for 2 hours. b) Correlation coefficients of the different expression profiles to the profile of young GHtreated male rats. The strongest correlation is found between GH-treated young and old male rats, and also between young
males treated with GH and female rats. The in vitro GH-treatment of isolated primary rat hepatocytes is also similar to the in
vivo situation. c) Correlation coefficients of the different expression profiles to the female/male comparison. The strongest correlation is found between the female profile and GH-treated young and old male rats. Estrogen treatment of male rats shows
lower correlation to gender.

Differentially expressed genes were defined using SAM statistics, with a 5% false discovery rate as cutoff. An additional criterion was for the gene to
have a mean ratio of at least 1.5. The table shows UniGene ID, GenBank accession number, gene name, and the median expression ratio (female/
male or EE/Control male).

of 27% of the male-enriched ones (Table 5). Again, few
genes (less than 7% of the gender differentiated) were
affected in the opposite direction by treatment with estrogen. This data strongly suggest that both estrogen and GH
significantly contribute to the gender differences in adult
rat liver. Although, as illustrated in Figure 1c, one week of
continuous infusion with GH is more efficient than an

injection with 17-alpha-ethynilestradiol to feminize the
adult male rat liver expression profile.
T3 and GH regulate lipogenic genes in liver
Both GH and T3 are required for longitudinal growth.
Therefore, we expected these hormones to have some
overlapping effects on liver gene expression. Nevertheless,

All of the genes in this list were up-regulated by T3 in hypothyroid mice (ratio repeatedly larger than 2). Clones that did not map to any Unigene
cluster were removed. The genes that were included in the promoter analysis, where mouse and human orthologs could be found, are indicated
with a *. The genes that were up-regulated by continuous infusion of GH in at least one of the in vivo models in a statistically significant manner are
indicated with a #. The table shows Unigene ID, GenBank accession number, gene name, and the median ratio (treated/untreated). "NA" means
that the gene was flagged away in the analysis due to low expression in two or more hybridizations. The shown experiments are: T3: thyroid
hormone treatment of hypothyroid mice for 2 hours; Young GH: infusion of bovine growth hormone (bGH) in young (3 months) male rats for 7
days; Old GH: infusion of human growth hormone (hGH) in old (2 years) male rats for 3 weeks.

we found that similarities were limited to a small number
of genes (indicated with a # in Table 6). A comparison of
frequency distribution among gene ontology (GO) categories related to the biological function between the
whole set of expressed genes and those up-regulated by T3
and GH revealed a statistically significant overrepresentation (p < 0.05) of regulated genes in the category of lipid
metabolism. Similar overrepresentation of genes involved
in lipogenesis was identified among the genes induced by
thyroid hormone.
The SREBP family of transcriptional regulators plays an
essential role in the regulation of lipogenesis and is
known to regulate several of the genes found to be
induced by thyroid hormone (Table 6) [17]. Because the
transcriptional effects of T3 were rapid, we hypothesize
the existence of a direct mechanistic crosstalk between
SREBPs and T3 signaling in mouse liver. Therefore, we
analyzed the promoter regions of T3-induced genes to
find out whether any consensus SREBP binding sites
could be found in promoter regions. The genes that were
included in this analysis are indicated with a * in Table 5.
Interestingly, we could identify a clear overrepresentation
of putative SREBP binding sites around the transcriptional
start site in the T3-regulated group compared to the control group (Figure 2). To make sure that this result was not
only due to higher phylogenetic conservation in the T3regulated group, a basic statistic analysis was performed:
the region from -500 to +100 relative the transcriptional
start sites (TSS) was picked out of each alignment in both
groups. A simple two-sided t-test of the mean conservation in both groups showed that they were not significantly different (p = 0.12). In fact, the T3-regulated group
had a slightly lower (but not statistically significant) mean
degree of conservation than the control group. We tested
if the distribution of SREBP sites was significantly different between the two groups using Chi-square analysis. As

the number of genes in the control group was higher, this
distribution was normalized to correspond to 30 genes
instead of the original 300 controls. The test demonstrates
conclusively (p = 0.0001) that the two distributions are
different and thus that there is a clear overrepresentation
of putative SREBP binding sites near the TSSs in the T3regulated group (Figure 2). In contrast, we were not able

indicated with a * in Table 6.

to localize a significant overrepresentation of thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in the close promoters of
the T3-regulated genes. We can not exclude that TREs exist
in the promoters of these genes, but either they are located
further away from the transcriptional initiation sites or in
areas that are not phylogenetically conserved between
mice and humans.
Three different SREBP isoforms, 1a, 1c and 2, encoded by
two distinct genes have been described. SREBP1c is the
predominant form in adult liver and adipocytes [17].
SREBPs are translated as large precursors tethered to the
endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane where
they, in response to sterol depletion, are proteolytically
cleaved into mature, transcriptionally active factors that
migrate to the nucleus and bind sterol regulatory elements
of specific genes [18]. The mechanisms whereby T3 regulate SREBP actions have been previously studied but
remain unclear. Long-term treatment with T3 has been
shown to induce SREBP2 expression in hepatocytes [19].
We tested whether rapid transcriptional induction could
account for the observed up-regulation of lipogenic genes.
As shown in Figure 3, T3 treatment had no effect on
SREBP1c or SREBP2 mRNA levels whereas the expression
of SREBP1a was significantly reduced. The results demonstrate that rapid transcriptional induction of SREBPs is not
the mechanism behind the T3 regulation of lipogenic
genes. Since the set of genes overlapping between T3 and
GH contained mostly genes involved in lipid metabolism,
we also analyzed the transcriptional induction of
SREBP1a, 1c and 2 after long term GH treatment, but
failed to detect any significant effect that could explain the
up-regulation of lipogenic genes (Figure 3).
We next explored whether early events in SREBP activation, such as the proteolytic processing of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) resident SREBPs could be regulated by T3.
The ER and nuclear forms of SREBP1 were measured
before and after T3 treatment. The analysis was extended
to study the effects of GH treatment. The Western blots in
Figure 4 show a decrease in the concentration of ER
bound (high molecular weight) SREBP1, indicating a
rapid activation of its proteolytic processing by T3. No significant effect of T3 could be detected for SREBP2 (data
not shown). Interestingly, the concentration of the
nuclear (short) form of SREBP1 was also reduced indicating that the total nuclear concentration of SREBP1 poorly
reflects its activity as judged by the transcriptional induction of target genes. In contrast to the findings with thyroid hormone, the effect of GH doesn't seem to be exerted
through similar mechanisms since no significant changes
in ER or nuclear SREBP levels were evident after GH treatment (Figure 4). It is therefore possible that alternative
mechanisms such as RNA stability or even the activation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/5/8

of other transcription factors account for the GH effects on
lipogenic genes.

Discussion
Here, we have attempted an analysis of a compilation of
expression profiles to gain insight into the hormonal regulation of liver gene expression. We demonstrated that a
positive correlation exists between the effects of GH treatment in primary hepatocytes cultured on matrigel and
those detected in vivo. Nevertheless, the correlation was
not very high despite the care taken of cultivating the
hepatocytes on matrigel to avoid de-differentiation. We
know from previous studies that hepatocytes cultured on
matrigel express GH receptors, that GH signalling through
the JAK2/STAT5 pathway is functional and that GH
induces IGF-1, a well- known GH regulated gene in vivo
[25]. Therefore, the differences between the in vivo and in
vitro models are likely due to structural and systemic factors found in intact liver which would be required for the
full extension of GH actions. On the other hand, our data
demonstrate that primary hepatocytes cultured on
matrigel do provide a model to study some GH activated
mechanisms; those directly related to the activation of the
GH receptor and its signaling molecules. The newly
described GH regulated genes in hepatocytes (Table 3):
phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (Phyh), hydroxysteroid 11beta dehydrogenase 1 (Hsd11b1), the catalytic subunit of
protein phosphatase 3, alpha isoform (Ppp3ca) and fatty
acid translocase/CD36 antigen (FAT/CD36) constitute
new target genes that could be used to study the basis of
transcriptional regulation by GH in hepatocytes.
Our global assessment of gene expression, demonstrates
that estrogen and to a larger extent, the female-like continuous pattern of GH secretion are important for the maintenance of the gender differences in liver gene expression
(Tables 4 and 5). These data support the existence of a
cross talk in the hepatic actions of GH and estrogens for
the regulation of a subset of the female-enriched genes.
The exact mechanism of this cross talk cannot be extracted
from the data, but previous findings offer a possible explanation. It is well known that the liver expresses relatively
low levels of estrogen receptor and that some estrogeninduced effects in liver, including the expression of the
estrogen receptor itself, may be secondary to its feminizing effect on GH pituitary secretion [20,21]. The role of
GH secretory patterns in determining gender differences
in rat liver expression of genes involved in sterol and drug
metabolism has been described before [16,22]. Here and
in recent studies by Ahluwalia et al [23] and Stahlberg et
al [8], the significance of this regulation is demonstrated
at a more comprehensive level and novel hepatic genderregulated genes are identified. We don't know yet how
gender determines the transcription of these genes. To the
date, only a few gender-predominant and GH-regulated

transcription factors have been identified, including
female predominant HNF-6 [24] and male predominant
STAT5b [25]. Nevertheless, an analysis of promoter
sequences of the genes identified in Table 4 has failed to
identify any significant overrepresentation of HNF-6 or
STAT5 consensus binding sites (data not shown). There-

fore, further analyses are required to better understand the
molecular mechanism behind the feminizing actions of
GH in liver.
Both GH and thyroid hormone are required for longitudinal growth [26]. The coordinate actions of these horPage 11 of 17

mones are achieved through multiple mechanisms.
Thyroid hormone is a key activator of GH secretion in the
pituitary gland while GH promotes the formation of T3
from less active T4 in peripheral tissues [27]. Through the
comparisons of expression profiles, we could identify a
small group of genes that were up-regulated by both hormones. Most of the genes were assigned to the category of
lipid metabolism by unbiased classification based on the
current gene ontology. This is in agreement to the known
lipogenic effects of both hormones in liver [7,10,28]. The
correlation between GH and T3 effects was small which
could be due to important differences in experimental
design as well as to mechanistic differences. Therefore, the
study of the long term effects of T3 treatment has the
potential to identify more overlapping effects.
The effects of T3 described herein are produced after 2
hours of treatment and are likely to be direct hormonal
effects on the liver. Therefore, we analyzed the proximal
promoter of genes rapidly regulated by T3 to gain further
insight into the mechanisms of hepatic T3 actions. Interestingly, we were not able to localize a significant overrepresentation of TREs in the close promoters of the T3regulated genes. On the other hand, we found a clear overrepresentation of putative SREBP binding sites; in agreement with the lipogenic nature of the T3-regulated genes.
Further analysis did not detect any transcriptional induction of SREBPs by T3. Instead, we showed that T3 decrease
the concentration of ER-bound SREBP1, probably due to
induction of its proteolytic processing. Regulation of
SREBP activity by T3 seems to be complex and involves
multiple mechanisms. The thyroid hormone receptor
(TR) and active SREBP1c can cooperate to activate the
transcription of a single gene even when their response
elements are situated very far apart [29]. Moreover, direct
interaction between TR alpha and the active form of
SREBP1 has been demonstrated when their binding sites
are closely located in the promoter of the chicken acetylCoA carboxylase-α gene [30]. Direct interactions between
TR and ER-resident SREBPs are unlikely to be responsible
for the effect observed in this study since the two proteins
have different intracellular localizations [31]. Nevertheless, this possibility can not be completely discarded since
10% of TRs are found in the cytosol both in the absence
or presence of T3 [31]. Non-genomic effects of T3 such as
the activation of PI-3 kinase, MEK and STAT transcription
factors have been reported in several systems [32].
Whether the rapid induction of SREBP1 processing by T3
is due to a non-genomic mechanism of T3 action, or not,
remains to be demonstrated. SREBP proteolyticactivation
in the Golgi is regulated by its interaction with SCAP and
Insig-1 and -2 [33]. When sterols are present at high concentrations, the SCAP/SREBP complex is retained in the
ER. When the sterol concentration is reduced, SCAP does
not interact with Insig and the SCAP/SREBP complex exits

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/5/8

the ER and is delivered to the Golgi where it is proteolytically cleaved. A role of SCAP as a monitor of the composition of the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER membrane has
been proposed [33]. Since T3 has been shown to bind the
outer half of the lipid bilayer in reconstituted microsomes
[34], there is a hypothetical possibility that T3 could bind
ER membranes and regulate SCAP activity. It is important
to notice that the concentration of the nuclear (short)
form of SREBP1 was also reduced upon T3 treatment.
Why this occurs simultaneously to the transcriptional
induction of SREBP target genes is unknown but a recent
publication indicates that transcriptionally active SREBP1
is rapidly targeted for proteosomal degradation [35]. If
this mechanism is at play, one would expect the effects of
T3 on lipogenic genes expression to be transient. This is
indeed the case, most of the T3 effects on lipogenic genes
can not be found after 5 days of hormonal treatment [10].
Future studies will clarify the importance of SREBPs for
thyroid hormone liver actions.

Conclusion
In summary, we have analyzed six different experiments
concerning the hepatic actions of GH, T3, estrogen and
gender. We could conclude that GH and estrogen are both
important determinants of gender-related differences in
hepatic gene expression, that GH and T3 have overlapping
effects on the regulation of several lipogenic genes, and
that some T3 effects in the liver may be mediated through
the induction of proteolytic processing of SREBP1.
Through EndoGED and its web-based interface, we have
made available a large data set of transcript profiles
related to the actions of several hormones in different in
vivo and in vitro models. This resource is of special interest
for the endocrine researcher offering the possibility of in
depth exploration of hormonal transcriptional actions
and interactions. In the same way, here exemplified by the
analysis of hormone actions in liver, the actions of other
hormones can be explored to generate testable hypotheses
of relevance to endocrine research.

Methods
Experimental design
We have studied the effects of different hormones on liver
gene expression patterns in various rat and mouse models. The experiments included in this study are listed in
Table 1. They were conducted separately in different
groups of animals, and by different persons in the laboratory. Some of the animal experiments have been described
in previous publications: infusion of bovine growth hormone (bGH) in young male rats [8], infusion of human
growth hormone (hGH) in old male rats [9], comparison
of female and male rats [8], and the rapid effects of thyroid hormone (T3) treatment of hypothyroid mice [10].
Total hepatic RNA from individual animals was isolated
using Trizol (Invitrogen, CA) and microarray hybridiza-

tions were performed on arrays larger than the ones
described in the previously published studies. At least 4
statistically independent microarray measurements were
used to characterize each physiological situation; with the
exception of the experiment where thyroid hormone
actions were studied where RNA pooled from 5 different
mice was used. Other experiments included in this study
have not previously been described. Primary hepatocytes
were isolated from young male rats and cultured on
matrigel as described previously[16]. The cells were grown
in serum-free William's media E (Invitrogen, CA) supplemented with 55 µg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich,
MO), 100 IU/ml streptomycin and 1 µg/ml insulin
(Sigma-Aldrich, MO) for two days before adding 100 ng/
ml bGH (National Hormone and Peptide Program, A.F.
Parlow, USA) to the media. GH-treated and untreated
cells were harvested 24 hours later in Trizol (Invitrogen,
CA), and RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. The procedure was repeated with cells
isolated from different rats. In another experiment, 3
months old male rats were injected with 17-α-ethinylestradiol (5 mg/kg body weight; Sigma-Aldrich, MO)
or vehicle 24 hours before sacrifice. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, CA). All animal experiments used in these studies were approved by the local
ethical committee.
cDNA microarrays, probe preparation and hybridization
The cDNA microarrays used in this study were produced
in our lab, as described previously [7]. They have, however, been extended to comprise about 6200 clones,
including clones from the TIGR Rat Gene Index, Research
Genetics (Invitrogen, CA), and our own obtained through
differential cloning experiments. The arrays were prehybridized in 1% BSA, 5XSSC and 0.1% SDS at 42°C for
1–2 hours, washed in milli-Q water, and dried immediately before the probe was applied. Total RNA was reversetranscribed in the presence of Cy3- or Cy5-conjugated
dUTP (PerkinElmer, MA) and purified as described previously [13]. In all studies except the one with T3-treated
mice, RNA samples originating from livers of individual
animals were labeled and each tester sample was hybridized against a control sample. In the T3-study, a pool of
tester samples (from 6 different T3-treated animals) was
hybridized against a pool of control samples due to limited availability of RNA. Dye-swaps were used in all studies to reduce systematic errors [36]. The final volume was
adjusted to 25 µl with hybridization buffer consisting of
3.4XSSC, 0.3% SDS, 20 µg mouse Cot1 DNA (Invitrogen,
CA), 20 µg polyA RNA, and 20 µg yeast tRNA. After heating at 98°C for 2 min and cooling to room temperature,
the probe was added to the array and covered with a plastic cover slip (Grace Bio-Labs, OR). Hybridization took
place at 65°C for 15–18 hours. The array was then washed
and scanned with a GMS 418 scanner (Affymetrix, CA).

Data processing and analysis
Data processing was performed essentially as described
previously [13]. The software GenePix Pro (Axon Instruments, CA) was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity of each spot and the surrounding background.
Automatic and manual flagging were used to localize
absent or very weak spots (less than 2 times above background), which were excluded from analysis. The signal
from each spot was calculated as the average intensity
minus the average local background. We used a normalization method that takes into account and corrects for
intensity-dependent artifacts in the measurements, the
locally weighted linear regression (Lowess) method in the
SMA package (Statistics for Microarray Analysis, available
at http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/terry/Group/soft
ware.html) [36]. SMA is an add-on library written in the
statistical language R.

We next used EndoGED to extract all expressed hepatic
genes from the included experiments concerning hormone treatment of rodents. In total, 6096 transcripts were
expressed in one or more hybridizations. Hierarchical
clustering using the TIGR Multiexperiment Viewer (MeV)
software (available at http://www.tigr.org[37]) was performed to explore and compare the different hormone
treatments in the generated gene expression matrix. The
euclidean distance was used as distance metric. We first
compared the usage of ratios from all hybridizations with
the usage of just the median log2 ratio for each set of replicated measurements (experiment group). These strategies gave similar results in the clustering, grouping the
replicated measurements closely together. The median
rather than the mean ratio was used to minimize the influence of outliers. Therefore, we calculated the median log2
ratio for each transcript within each experiment group,
and used this ratio for further analysis. Genes that were
detected in only half of the replicated measurements, or
less, were excluded since we did not consider these measurements reliable. Included in the hierarchical clustering
were only genes that had four or more median expression
ratios from the six experiment groups (2518 genes). Using
the same dataset with median ratios from each experiment group, we also calculated the correlation coefficient
between the different experiment groups.
A statistical evaluation of differentially expressed genes
was performed using the SAM (Significance Analysis for
Microarrays) statistical technique [38]. This was done for
each experiment group separately. A 5% false discovery
rate (FDR) was used as cutoff. A gene expression matrix
containing only genes affected by GH in vivo in a statistically significant manner was extracted from EndoGED.
The T3-regulated genes in this list were identified by
applying a log2 ratio cutoff of ± 1 (2-fold regulation) in
each of the T3 hybridizations. We next used the web-

based tool eGOn (developed at the Norwegian University
of Science and Technology, available at http://
nova2.idi.ntnu.no/egon/) to functionally classify the transcripts. With the two-sided one-sample binomial test
implemented in eGOn, we compared the list of differentially expressed genes to all genes expressed in the T3 and
GH experiments. The same software was also used to classify all T3-regulated genes (at least 2-fold up-regulation),
and to compare them to all genes expressed in the experiments regarding T3. For the comparisons between gender
differentiated genes and the effects of GH and estrogen, a
mean ratio cutoff (log2 ratio treated/untreated >0.58, corresponding to at least 1.5-fold difference) was applied on
top of the SAM statistical criteria.
Brief description of EndoGED
The EndoGED system includes a Lab Information Management System (LIMS) to manage array fabrication, and
modules to collect, store and process gene expression data
concerning the actions of hormones. The system offers a
flexible solution to integrate external analysis tools,
including possibilities to store transformed expression
values (e.g. normalized ratios) and associated parameters
derived from statistical evaluation. The systems run on
Microsoft operating system and have a client-server architecture implemented in SQL-Server as the database engine
and Borland Delphi for the program modules. In the database design, we have taken into consideration the latest
MIAME recommendations from the MGED Society
regarding microarray data description [39]. We have
implemented a detailed description of biomaterials and
treatments used in the experiments, carefully considering
what information would be significant to the endocrine
researcher. The exploration tools have been implemented
to allow easy retrieval of relevant data through a multilevel search engine. Furthermore, we have made part of
our collected data available through Internet for easy
access to researchers worldwide http://www.cmm.ki.se/
EndoGED. The database structure and software are available for free to academic and other nonprofit researchers.
Real Time-PCR
The expression of some genes from the array experiments
were verified using quantitative real-time PCR. The
Dynamo kit (Finnzymes Oy, Finland) containing SYBR
Green was used for quantification. The primers and
applied annealing temperatures are listed in Table 2. The
expression of all genes was normalized to glyceraldehyde3-P dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which was always measured in parallel to the other genes.
Promoter analysis
We undertook a promoter analysis of a group of genes
that were all up-regulated more than 2-fold two hours
after T3 treatment in hypothyroid mice. We sought to find

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/5/8

out if there was a statistically significant overrepresentation of SREBP and TRE binding sites in the T3-regulated
group of genes compared to a control group, unaffected
by the treatment. We used pair wise cross-species comparison (phylogenetic footprinting) as described by Lenhard
et al [40] to identify putative transcription factor binding
sites in the regions upstream of the transcriptional start
site (TSS). Comprehensive reviews covering the field of
transcriptional regulation bioinformatics are available
[41,42].
As the study concerned mice, we used mouse orthologs to
the rat genes printed on the arrays. To locate mouse
orthologs for the rat sequences, we aligned the rat
sequences to the mouse genome (NCBI build 30) using
BLAT [43] and then searched for mouse cDNA sequences
aligning to the same loci as the rat sequences and indicating similar gene structures. Human cDNA sequences
orthologous to the mouse cDNA sequences were identified using the GeneLynx database [44,45]. Guided by
genomic mappings of the cDNA sequences from the
UCSC Genome Browser Database [46], we retrieved
human (NCBI build 33) and mouse gene and promoter
sequences. Since cDNA sequences are often truncated, we
used consensus exon-intron structures derived from overlapping and similar cDNA mappings. We aimed to
retrieve sequence from -5000 to +100 relative to TSSs.
However, to ensure that the corresponding human and
mouse genomic regions were extracted, we extended this
region if, in an alignment of the human and mouse gene
sequences, the TSSs could not be align. In addition, to
avoid inclusion of other nearby genes in the retrieved
sequences, we truncated the sequences at the border of
any multi-exon cDNA mapping upstream of a TSS. If such
a mapping was encountered within 100 bps of a TSS, no
sequence was retrieved. Genes which could not confidently be mapped onto either mouse or human genomes
were excluded from the analysis.
We analyzed 30 genes rapidly up-regulated by T3 (indicated with a * in Table 6) and, as a control group, 300
expressed but unaffected genes that were randomly
selected from the array. We used a 50 bp sliding window
and 70% sequence conservation for the alignment windows. The binding model was constructed by merging two
matrix models (M00220 and M00221) from the TRANSFAC database [47]. The score cutoff for this model was set
to 75%.
Western blots
Whole cell protein extracts were prepared from frozen
liver tissue by homogenization in RIPA buffer. Protein
extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
PVDF membranes with a Trans-Blot SD semi-dry transfer
cell (Hoefer, Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). The filters were

blocked for 1 h at RT in TTBS (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM
NaCl, Tween 0.1%, pH 7.4) containing 5% skim milk
powder. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C
with an anti-SREBP1 or antiβ-actin, as a loading control
(SantaCruz Biotechnology, USA). After three 10 min
washes in TTBS, binding of primary antibody was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies, and the immunolabeling was detected by an
enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL) method according
to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce Chemical Company, USA).
