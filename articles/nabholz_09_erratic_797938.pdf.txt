Abstract
Background: During the last ten years, major advances have been made in characterizing and
understanding the evolution of mitochondrial DNA, the most popular marker of molecular
biodiversity. Several important results were recently reported using mammals as model organisms,
including (i) the absence of relationship between mitochondrial DNA diversity and life-history or
ecological variables, (ii) the absence of prominent adaptive selection, contrary to what was found
in invertebrates, and (iii) the unexpectedly large variation in neutral substitution rate among
lineages, revealing a possible link with species maximal longevity. We propose to challenge these
results thanks to the bird/mammal comparison. Direct estimates of population size are available in
birds, and this group presents striking life-history trait differences with mammals (higher massspecific metabolic rate and longevity). These properties make birds the ideal model to directly test
for population size effects, and to discriminate between competing hypotheses about the causes of
substitution rate variation.
Results: A phylogenetic analysis of cytochrome b third-codon position confirms that the
mitochondrial DNA mutation rate is quite variable in birds, passerines being the fastest evolving
order. On average, mitochondrial DNA evolves slower in birds than in mammals of similar body
size. This result is in agreement with the longevity hypothesis, and contradicts the hypothesis of a
metabolic rate-dependent mutation rate. Birds show no footprint of adaptive selection on
cytochrome b evolutionary patterns, but no link between direct estimates of population size and
cytochrome b diversity. The mutation rate is the best predictor we have of within-species
mitochondrial diversity in birds. It partly explains the differences in mitochondrial DNA diversity
patterns observed between mammals and birds, previously interpreted as reflecting Hill-Robertson
interferences with the W chromosome.
Conclusion: Mitochondrial DNA diversity patterns in birds are strongly influenced by the wide,
unexpected variation of mutation rate across species. From a fundamental point of view, these
results are strongly consistent with a relationship between species maximal longevity and
mitochondrial mutation rate, in agreement with the mitochondrial theory of ageing. Form an
applied point of view, this study reinforces and extends the message of caution previously
expressed for mammals: mitochondrial data tell nothing about species population sizes, and
strongly depart the molecular clock assumption.

Background
Animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) evolution contrasts with nuclear evolution. Mitochondrial and nuclear
genomes differ in many ways, such as total length, ploidy
level, mode of inheritance, recombination rate, presence
of introns, percentage of non-coding DNA, effective population size, and repair mechanisms, e.g. [1,2]. Among
these particularities, hypermutability is one of the most
striking features of animal mitochondria: the mtDNA
mutation rate is typically one order of magnitude higher
than the nuclear one [1,3,4]. The question of the origin
and evolution of such high mutation rates is still open
and debated [5,6]; and see [7,8] for exceptions.
This high mutation rate is one of the reasons why mtDNA
is a very popular marker for biodiversity studies. For
example, it has been massively used to investigate
intraspecific to intra-ordinal evolutionary relationship,
and disentangle rapid speciation events in phylogenetic
studies (e.g. see [9,10] for a comparison of nuclear and
mitochondrial markers). In recent years, mtDNA has been
used to identify species using a standardized portion of
the cytochrome oxydase I gene (COI), according to the socalled DNA barcoding approach [11]. The high mtDNA
mutation rate, however, is also the source of frequent
homoplasy, i.e., phylogenetic incongruence between sites
of the molecule because of multiple mutations at the
same site. Homoplasy complicates the use of mtDNA in
phylogenetic [9,10,12] and even population genetic [13]
studies.
We recently reported several results related to mtDNA
mutation dynamics in mammals. First, we showed that
mtDNA substitution rates are extremely variable between
species: they differ by two orders of magnitude between
slow-evolving and fast-evolving mammalian lineages
[14], definitively rejecting the famous "2% per site per
million year" calibration, which should not be generally
trusted. We proposed that mutation rate variations are
possibly linked to species longevity through the action of
natural selection: too high a mutation rate would be deleterious in long-lived mammals because it could result in
premature aging due to the accumulation of somatic
mtDNA mutations [14], see also [15-17]. Secondly, we
found that within-species cytochrome b (cytb) nucleotide
diversity is correlated with the mitochondrial mutation
rate, as expected, but not with any life-history or ecological variable potentially related to population size, including body size, geographic range and conservation status
[18]. This surprising pattern was apparently not explained
by selective effects [18] (see also [19]), contrary to results
obtained at the Metazoa level [20], especially invertebrates [21]. We therefore proposed that the lack of correlation between mtDNA diversity and potential indicators
of population size in mammals is due to strong demo-

graphic stochasticity. At any rate, the mutation rate is the
best predictor we have of mitochondrial genetic diversity
across mammalian species. Overall, these results highlight
the importance of mutation rate variations in shaping
mtDNA biodiversity patterns in mammals, and suggest
that mutational effects should be carefully taken into
account when analysing such data.
In this study, we extend our analysis of the evolutionary
dynamics of mtDNA through the bird/mammal comparison. Our objective is dual. First, we want to check whether
the mammalian results are specific to this group, or have
any degree of generality. Secondly, we want to make use
of the genetical and physiological specificities of birds to
test various evolutionary hypothesis raised by previous
studies. Birds are the perfect candidate to challenge the
results obtained in mammals: like mammals, they include
charismatic, well studied species, in which a large amount
of genetic and biological data are available. Being relatively large, warm blooded vertebrates, birds are comparable to mammals in terms of physiology, ecology, and lifehistory. Birds, furthermore, show a number of peculiarities potentially relevant to mitochondrial evolution and
diversity.
The first reason why birds are appropriate for a comparative approach is the availability of direct population size
estimates obtained through global population surveys,
especially for North American species [22]. Birds therefore
provide the opportunity to directly test the relationship
between population size and mitochondrial diversity,
whereas in mammals we had to rely on ecological and life
history traits, plausibly, but only supposedly, correlated to
population size. We will therefore check whether the lack
of relationship between mtDNA diversity and species
abundance we reported in mammals is confirmed in
birds, or was due to inappropriate measure of the effective
population size.
Birds, secondly, present a genetic peculiarity: female is the
heterogametic sex. Because it is strictly maternally transmitted, the avian mitochondrial genome is thus in full
genetic linkage with the female-specific W chromosome
[23]. Berlin et al. [24] proposed that the mtDNA diversity
could therefore be reduced by Hill-Robertson interference: selective effects applying to loci linked to the W will
affect mtDNA through hitch-hiking. This clever hypothesis has provoked some comments and reactions [24-27].
Hickey [26] questioned one of the most important arguments of Berlin et al. [24], namely the lower synonymous
diversity in bird than in mammal mtDNA, arguing that
mutation rate could be a confounding effect. An accurate
estimation of mtDNA substitution rate variations in birds
appears necessary to correctly interpret the patterns of
mtDNA diversity in the bird/mammal comparison.

Birds, finally, have quite high metabolic rates – 1.5 to 2.5
times higher than mammals of similar sizes [28] -probably because of the high energetic demand of the flying
locomotion. Paradoxically, birds species are strikingly
long-lived as compared to their mammalian counterparts;
on average, birds live three times longer than mammals of
similar sizes [28,29]. Birds can be characterized as longlived homeotherms, a specificity they share with bats [30].
These peculiarities are useful to understand further the
impact of metabolic rate and life-span on mtDNA substitution rates.
Three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain
mtDNA substitution rate variations in mammals: the generation time hypothesis [30-33], the metabolic rate
hypothesis [34,35], and the longevity hypothesis [14-17],
presented above. The classical approach to test these
hypotheses in a comparative framework is to correlate
substitution rate variations with the relevant life history
traits [14,17,33]: female sexual maturity, basal mass-specific metabolic rate (or body mass, taken as a proxy), and
maximum longevity. However, these life-history traits are
strongly correlated with each other, so that the respective
contributions of the three variables are difficult to disentangle. The contrast between the avian and mammalian
physiologies provides a unique opportunity to discriminate between two of these competing models, namely the
longevity and the metabolic rate hypotheses. According to
the longevity hypothesis, birds should present, on average, lower mtDNA neutral substitution rates than mammals, while the reverse pattern is expected under the
metabolic rate hypothesis.
To test these predictions and challenge the results we
obtained in mammals, we propose to accurately estimate
the lineage-specific neutral substitution rate variation of
mtDNA in birds using the phylogenetic framework developed by [14]. Using this dataset, we want to check the
rough 2%/site/Myr calibration. This calibration, originally estimated with an RFLP analysis on mammals by
Brown et al. [3], was generalized to birds by a study in
geese [36]. This calibration rapidly became a standard in
ornithology studies, probably because of the scarcity of
the fossil record (see [37,38] and [39] for a review).
Recently, the reliability of this calibration was debated in
various studies either supporting [40-42] or rejecting it
[39,43]. We will also ask which of metabolic rate and longevity is the best predictor of mutation rate variations in
warm-blooded vertebrates. Finally, we will estimate the
mitochondrial genetic diversity (synonymous and nonsynonymous) on a wide taxonomic range in birds to test
for the neutrality assumption and investigate the link
between population size, mutation rate, genetic hitch-hiking, and mtDNA diversity.

Results
Substitution rate variation and its determinants
To infer the substitution rate variation of a large number
of bird species, we need to estimate divergence dates, and
the numbers of nucleotide substitutions which occurred
during these divergences (branch lengths). The divergence
dates are obtained thanks to paleontologic calibration
points, which are mostly available for relatively old divergences. Nucleotide substitution numbers, however, must
be estimated using little-divergent sequences because of
mutational saturation. To resolve this methodological
problem, we take advantage of the decoupled non-synonymous (i.e. amino acids) and synonymous evolutionary
dynamics. We introduced a 3-step method [14], in which
we first define groups of sequences showing limited divergences, then estimate the relative species-specific substitution rate at third codon positions within groups, and
finally assign a divergence for each of these groups using
amino acid sequences. At step 2 and 3, molecular and fossil information are combined thanks to a sophisticated
Bayesian method [44].

Using this procedure, we analysed a cytb dataset of 1571
species, which represent ~15% of the total living species
of birds. The average cytb third codon position substitution rate was 0.027 substitution/site/Myr, and the median
was 0.018 substitution/site/Myr. These substitution rates
are estimated per lineage, per third-codons position. To
make them roughly comparable to the popular 2% of
divergence per site per Myr, these numbers must be multiplied by two (to reflect a divergence between two species) and divided by three (assuming that only third
codon positions are variable). Doing this would yield an
average divergence of 1.8% per Myr (median: 1.2% per
Myr), which is slightly less than the popular 2%. The distribution across species shows a large variation: the 2.5%
and 97.5% percentiles are 0.003 and 0.090 substitution/
site/Myr, respectively (Figure 1). Thus, even if we consider
the 5% most extreme substitution rate values as outliers,
the cytb third codon position substitution rate shows a
thirty-fold range of variation across bird lineages. We
quantified the effect of taxonomy on substitution rate variation using a hierarchical ANOVA considering superorder, order, family and genus with random effects. The
order level explains 46% (63% in simple one-way
ANOVA) of the variance in substitution rates across species. Considering only order with more than 20 species,
Passerines are the fastest evolving order (0.038 ± 0.055
substitution/site/Myr) and Anseriformes the slowest one
(0.004 ± 0.0008 substitution/site/Myr, see Figure 2).
Compared with mammals, birds globally evolve 3.7 times
slower on average (mammalian average: 0.098 substitution/site/Myr, Nabhloz et al. [14]), and show a range of
variation less extreme (coefficient of variation: 1,58 for
birds, 1,72 for mammals, Figure 3).

We correlated the species-specific substitution rate to lifehistory traits in order to discriminate between the competing explanatory hypotheses. A smaller amount of life-history data are available in birds than in mammals,
especially for female sexual maturity, which is documented in 30 species only. We thus focused on the effects
of body mass and maximum longevity using the 196 species in which these two variables are available. In agreement with both the metabolism and the longevity
hypotheses, the two life-history traits are negatively linked
to the substitution rate. Body mass appears to be a better
predictor of the substitution rate (R2 = 0.39, p < 0.001, n
= 196) than maximum longevity, which also shows a
strong level of correlation (R2 = 0.25, p < 0.001, n = 196,
Figure 4, Table 1).
The distribution of (log-transformed) maximum longevity is strongly bimodal in birds, passerines being substantially more short-lived than other birds (see Additional
file 1). We separated passerines from non-passerine and
re-performed the same analyses in the two subsets separately. The results are shown in Table 2. Surprisingly, the
third-codon position substitution rate is positively correlated to body mass and maximum longevity in passerines
birds. In non-passerines birds, results are similar to the
global analysis: body mass best explains substitution rate
variations, and removes the effect of longevity in a twoway ANOVA (Table 2). This result is not consistent with
mammals [14].

year. Orders represented by more than 20 species are

In order to check whether these results were robust to the
removal of phylogenetic effects, we applied the phylogenetic contrast method [45] to regress phylogeny out of the
analyses. In this analysis, we used the chronogramme
obtained with amino-acid cytochrome b sequences. The
phylogenetic control did not qualitatively change the
results although most p-values were decreased (Table 1,
Table 2).
Finally, we jointly analysed the mammalian and bird
datasets (Table 3, Figure 5), including class (birds vs.
mammals) as an explanatory variable. The two-factor
model (class + life history trait) revealed that the bird vs.
mammal status has a strong effect on mtDNA substitution
rate when body mass is taken into account and a significant but weaker effect as far as longevity is concerned
(Table 3). There is, moreover, a significant interaction
between body mass and class (p < 0.001), but not between
longevity and class (p = 0.65).

Bird cytb polymorphism sequence datasets were retrieved
from the Polymorphix database [46]. The synonymous

as in Nabholz et al. [18] and Berlin et al. [24]. s and body
mass were negatively correlated but, contrary to Berlin et
al. [24], this relationship was not significant (R2 = 0.019,
p = 0.30, n = 56). Secondly, we applied a more direct analysis using population size estimates for North American
breeding birds through the North American Landbird
Conservation Plan [22]. Such data were available for 28
strictly North American species of our data set. We found
no correlation between direct population size estimate
and cytb synonymous diversity (Figure 6, t = 0.031, p =
0.81, Kendall's test). These results confirm those obtained
in mammals [18], here using direct estimations of population sizes instead of life-history and ecological proxies.
The dataset, however, is much smaller in the present analysis.
We tested the taxonomic effect on s using one-way ANOVAs on order and family level. We found that neither the
family nor the order level had a significant effect. The sole
taxonomic variable having a significant effect on mtDNA
diversity is the passerine/non-passerine status, passerines
being more diverse than other birds (passerines: n = 79,
non-passerines: n = 68, R2 = 0.03, p < 0.05).
We compared the distribution of s between birds and
mammals. Similarly to Berlin et al. [24], we found that
birds have a lower average synonymous diversity than
mammals (n = 169, R2 = 0.09, p < 0.001, Additional file
2a), but this difference is largely reduced when we controlled for the mutation rate (previously estimated above
after control, R2 = 0.03, p = 0.032, Additional file 2b).
Interestingly, we detected no significant difference of
allozyme heterozygosity between mammals (average H =
0.046 ± 0.033) and birds (0.053 ± 0.028) using the Nevo
et al. [47] data set (birds: n = 42, mammals: n = 164, R2 =
0.01, p = 0.08). As in mammals, we found a positive and
significant correlation between species-specific cytb thirdcodon substitution rate and cytb synonymous diversity
per genus (n = 46, R2 = 0.10, p = 0.02, Figure 7). These
analyses confirm that the mutation rate is a major deter-

minant of mtDNA polymorphism in birds as well as in
mammals.
Finally, we compared the ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous changes within (Pn/Ps) and between species
(Dn/Ds) in birds and mammals – these ratio were computed when an outgroup was available. The two groups
showed a similar Dn/Ds (birds: n = 81, average Dn/Ds =

in birds than in mammals (birds: average Pn/Ps = 0.118 ±

p < 0.01), as previously reported by Berlin et al. [24].

cytb, is highly variable between bird lineages. The molecular clock hypothesis does not apply to bird mtDNA evolution, fast-evolving species being thirty times more rapid
than slow-evolving ones. The method we applied is particularly prone to reveal the actual amplitude of substitution
rate variation: by overcoming the problem of mutational
saturation, it allowed us to use an extensive dataset
encompassing the whole taxonomic diversity of birds.
This study, therefore, provides a synthetic view of substitution rate variations across bird lineages, bringing an
important result in the field of molecular dating, in which
the rough approximation of 2% of substitution per million of years is still debated [41,42,40,43,39]. Our analysis suggests that the molecular clock assumption should
be avoided as far as bird mtDNA is concerned. The conclusions of Pereira and Baker [43] (obtained from fullgenome data), and some studies done at smaller scale
(reviewed in [39]) are here confirmed by cytochrome b
third codon positions at wide taxonomic scale. Although
the average rate in birds is close to this value, the 2% per
site per million year calibration is a very bad summary of
the whole picture: the rate is essentially (up to five times)
higher than 2% in passerines, and (up to ten times) lower
in non-passerines (Figure 1). Users of mtDNA as a tools
for inferring divergence dates should imperatively use statistical phylogenetic methods accounting for substitution
rate variation across lineages, the so-called clock-relaxed
methods [44,48-50].
Several interesting results were revealed thanks to the
comparison with mammals. First, birds show a more narrow range of variation of life-history traits than mammals.
For example body mass varies from 5.5 g to 3.9 kg in the
bird dataset, whereas it varies from 3.7 g to 138 tones in
mammals. This result confirms the general influence of
life-history traits on neutral mtDNA substitution rate in
birds and mammals. This result is important because such
a relationship was not reported in every taxonomic group
[51], and even not by some studies in mammals [52,53].
Secondly, the neutral mtDNA substitution rate is lower in
birds than in mammals, and this difference increases if

body mass is regressed out of the analysis (Table 2). For
example, birds evolve four times slower than mammals as
far as small species (body mass < 500 g) are concerned.
This result is in agreement with the longevity hypothesis,
but not with the metabolic rate hypothesis. According to
the latter model, birds should show a higher average
mutation rate than mammals, because of their higher
mass-specific metabolic rate and their lower average body
mass [54].

During the course of evolution, birds have acquired adaptations to manage their high mass-specific metabolic rate,
including an increased of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
protection and lower ROS production [55,56]. In the context of the mitochondrial theory of aging, which postulates that ROS production as a byproduct of
mitochondrial respiration contributes to aging, these

adaptations could be interpreted as a response to the elevated longevity of birds [57]. The reduced rate of ROS production could explain the lower average mutation rate of
birds mtDNA, as compared to mammals (see also [26]). It
is surprising, therefore, to find a predominant influence of
body mass, not longevity, in the within-birds analysis.
Passerines show a positive relationship between longevity
(or body mass) and substitution rate, which is quite surprising. We have no valid explanation for this relationship
so far, perhaps because it is not biologically relevant – this
relationship is the single result that was not recovered
when we used other methods of substitution rate estimation (see Additional file 3). Within non-passerines, which
are essentially long-lived species, body mass is still the
variable best explaining substitution rate variations

(Table 2). Using DNA-DNA hybridization data (and a
smaller dataset), Mooers and Harvey [32] found no support for the metabolic rate hypothesis, but reported a significant generation time effect. In this context, it would be
interesting to enlarge the female sexual maturity data set,
in order to test the generation time hypothesis with our
extended mitochondrial dataset.
Determination of mtDNA diversity in birds
The neutral genetic diversity primarily depends on effective population size and mutation rate. Because population sizes appear so variable in time and between species,
variations in genetic diversity across species have been frequently interpreted in demographic terms, e.g. [58,59].
Recently, the effect of population size on mtDNA diversity
has been challenged [18,20]. The large variations in mutation rates we report in birds suggest that mutational effects
should be carefully taken into account in studying
mtDNA polymorphism in this group, as well as in mammals [18].

In general, the relationship between population size and
mtDNA diversity is difficult to evaluate because of the
scarcity of population size estimates for wild species. Lifehistory traits, like body mass, have therefore been used as
proxy of population size [18,60]. Birds are an exception:
thanks to the broad interest of the scientific community in
bird ecology and systematics, direct estimates of species
effective sizes are available for North American species
[22]. We correlated these population size estimates to synonymous mtDNA diversity and found no significant relationship. The data set is rather small (n = 28), but we note
that this relationship should theoretically be strong, given
the wide range of population sizes (2 orders of magnitude). When using body mass as an indicator of population size, thus increasing much the data set, we found a
negative correlation with cytb synonymous diversity, but
this result was not significant. Berlin et al. [24] report a significant relationship between s and body mass in birds
using genus averages. If we apply the same method, we
also find a significant relationship (n = 37, R2 = 0.16, p =
0.01), but the effect is removed when the passerine/nonpasserine status is taken into account (multiple regression, p body mass = 0.25). This result is in agreement with
our previous mammalian analysis, in which the weak
effect of body mass was removed by a taxonomic control
[18]. So similarly to mammals, the mitochondrial genetic
diversity is essentially uncorrelated to life-history traits in
birds, and when it is so, it is most likely via the influence
of mutation rate, not population size.
Mitochondrial selective regime in birds
To explain the lack of relationship between mtDNA diversity and proxies of population size in mammals, Nabholz
et al. [18] invoked demographic stochasticity, while Bazin
et al. [20] invoked recurrent hitchhiking effects for other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/54

species having larger expected population sizes (invertebrates and marine species). What about Birds? To address
this question we computed the neutrality index (NI = Pn/
Ps/Dn/Ds; [61], see Methods). NI < 1 indicates positive
selection, while NI > 1 indicates purifying selection. The
average NI in birds is significantly higher than in mammals (R2 = 0.058, p < 0.01, Additional file 2) and only
three species of birds show a NI < 1 (seven in mammals).
The high NI values in birds are due to their high Pn/Ps
ratios -Dn/Ds ratios are similar to those of mammals. This
result indicates that mtDNA evolution in birds is mainly
governed by purifying selection, as previously reported
[24]. It is also indicative of a strong level of constraint acting on bird cytochrome b sequences, which is known as
the avian constraint hypothesis [62].
Like mammals, birds appear to have population sizes low
enough to belong to the "drift domain", rather than the
"draft domain" sensu Gillespie [63] (see discussion in
[18]). In the absence of a significant impact of positive
selection, we have to invoke strong demographic stochasticity to explain the lack of relationship between population size and mtDNA diversity. Mutation rate is expected
to be a major determinant of within-species genetic diversity whether populations are at mutation-drift equilibrium (standard theory) or not [64,65]. Consistently, we
report a significantly positive relationship between cytb
diversity and substitution rate (Figure 7), again paralleling
the mammalian situation.
In a recent paper, Berlin et al. [24] proposed an alternative
hypothesis to explain mtDNA polymorphism patterns in
birds. They suggested that Hill-Robertson effects due to
complete association with the W chromosome could
explain the lower synonymous mitochondrial diversity
and the higher Pn/Ps observed in birds, as compared to
mammals. This should also explain the lack of correlation
between neutral polymorphism and population size. Outwardly, we confirm this hypothesis by showing that the
lower synonymous mitochondrial diversity is not found
for nuclear allozymes. But this picture is complicated by
the globally lower mtDNA substitution rate in birds than
in mammals. Controlling for mutation rates actually
removes the major part of the difference between birds
and mammals. To quantify the effect of mutation rate variation on synonymous mtDNA diversity we combined the
bird and mammal polymorphism and neutral substitution rate datasets and performed a multiple regression of
substitution rate and bird/mammal status (class) on synonymous mtDNA diversity. This model explains 21% of s
variation (birds: n = 46, mammals: n = 123, p < 0.001).
The result also shows that the mutation rate has a strong
effect on s (t = 4.9; p < 0.001) and considerably reduces
the effect of class (t = 2.1, p = 0.021). This analysis indicates that a subtential part of the difference between birds
and mammalian s is explained by their distinct mutation

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:54

rates (see Additional file 4b). The difference in mutation
rates, however, cannot explain the higher level of mitochondrial Pn/Ps found in birds. Birds and mammals have
apparently comparable effective population sizes, as suggested by their similar average allozymic heterozygosity.
The higher Pn/Ps ratio in birds may therefore be due to
Hill-Robertson interferences between the mitochondrial
and W chromosomes, as suggested by Berlin et al. [24],
although this effect has only a weak influence on absolute
levels of s, when mutation rate is controlled for.

Conclusion
In this work, we achieved a comprehensive comparison of
mitochondrial substitution rate variation and mitochondrial diversity between birds and mammals. Cytb neutral
substitution rates are, on average, 3.9 times slower in birds
than in mammals. Among-lineages variability, although
substantial, is also lower in birds than in mammals. This
analysis corroborates the longevity hypothesis about
mutation rate determination [14,17]. Despite their higher
metabolic rate, birds undergo a lower mitochondrial
mutation rate, probably because of the beneficial effect of
reduced oxidative damage in long-lived species [26,28].
We suggest that the low mtDNA mutation rate of birds
might explain their exceptional mass-specific longevity.
As for mammals, we report no evidence of adaptive selection on cytb sequence evolution, but still no population
size effect, even when using direct estimates of population
size available for North American species. We thus invoke
the same demographic instability explanation as previously proposed for mammals [18], although selective
interferences with the W chromosome [24] could contribute to the noisy relationship between mtDNA diversity
and population size. We also confirm the importance of
mutation rate as a determinant of mtDNA diversity – the
lower mutation rates in birds almost fully explain their
lower synonymous diversity.
This study confirms and extends the message of caution
expressed by Nabholz et al. [18,14] about the usage of
mtDNA as a molecular marker of biodiversity in vertebrates: (i) mtDNA diversity is not related to species abundance; (ii) mtDNA greatly departs the molecular clock
hypothesis. The 2% per site per million year calibration
(estimated from primate data) has no degree of generality,
and should not be used for dating purposes in the absence
of fossil data.

Methods
Sequence data for substitution rate analysis
Complete bird cytochrome b sequences were extracted
from National Center for Biotechnology information/
Genbank. One sequence per species (the longest, excluding indeterminations) was selected.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/54

Accession numbers are given in Additional file 5. The 5'most 102 nucleotides were removed from the alignments,
because missing in a large number of species. Total alignment length was 1043 nucleotides.
Sequence data and Allozyme data for polymorphism
analysis
An mtDNA dataset was built from Polymorphix [46]. Polymorphix is a database dedicated to sequence polymorphism. It contains within-species homologous sequence
families built from EMBL/GenBank under suitable similarity and bibliographic criteria. To obtain a homogeneous dataset, comparable with a previous mammalian
study [18], only the protein coding cytochrome b gene
was used. We extracted from Polymorphix every bird
sequence family for which any >100-bases-long cytochrome b fragment was available in four individuals or
more. Polymorphix sequence families were aligned using
CLUSTALW [66], inspected by eye and corrected when
required. Dubious sequences (badly aligned or including
many undetermined nucleotides) were manually
removed. Alignments are available at http://kimura.univmontp2.fr/~benoit/data.html.

Estimates of allozyme heterozygosity in 74 bird and 194
mammalian species were obtained from [47]. Allozyme
heterozygosities were averaged using 10–30 loci. The
most popular allozyme loci are shared by many species.
Allozyme heterozygosities are therefore fairly comparable
between species.
Substitution Rate estimation
We used the same uncoupled method as previously developed for mammals [14]. The whole cytochrome b data set
was split in groups within which sequence divergence is
moderate. To achieve this, the GenBank taxonomic classification was traversed recursively, starting from birds
orders and moving toward lower levels. For each traversed
taxonomic group, we 1) gathered the corresponding third
codon position sequences, 2) aligned sequences using
ClustalW [66], 3) built a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree using PHYML [67], general time reversible +
Gamma model of nucleotide evolution, and 4) calculated
the pairwise patristic distances for every pair of species
(defined as the sum of branch lengths in the path connecting the 2 species in the tree). When the median pairwise
distance between species was lower than 0.4, the current
taxonomic group was selected for further analysis, (except
for the Falconiformes and Ciconiiformes orders, for
which monophyly is uncertain [68,69]), and the taxonomic traversal was stopped. Otherwise, the above procedure was applied to underlying taxonomic groups. The
within group, species-specific relative neutral substitution
rates were estimated using two different softwares:
MULTIDIVTIME [44] and MCMCTREE [50,70] available

Page 9 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:54

in the PAML packages [71]. The major difference is that
MULTIDIVTIME makes use of a normal approximation of
the likelihood, and only implements the F84 + Γ model of
sequence evolution [44], whereas MCMCTREE performs
exact likelihood calculation and can be used with different models of sequence evolution – we used the HKY + Γ
The Monte Carlo Markov Chain was run for 1 million generations after a burn-in of 200,000 generations that
achieved stationarity.
Bird phylogeny is still partly uncertain, particularly the
basal relationships within the Neoaves clade [68,69,7274]. We used two alternative phylogenetic trees to date
divergences. The first one is conform to Ericson et al. [68]
topology, obtained using mostly nuclear markers, and the
second one is conform to the complete genome mitochondrial topology proposed by Slack et al. [69]. In both
topologies, the relationships within passerines were made
congruent to Barker et al. [75]. Groups were dated by
applying MULTIDIVTIME to amino-acid sequences (two
representative species per group, model mtREV + G).
Twelve fossil calibrations points were used (Additional
file 6). The results were very similar whatever the method
and the tree (Additional files 3 and 7), so we chose to
present only the results obtained with MULTIDIVTIME
using the mitochondrial genome topology, except when
mentioned. We checked that neither the mean nor the variance of species-specific estimated substitution rates are
correlated to terminal branch lengths (not shown).
Sequence management and GenBank taxonomic exploration were achieved using homemade C++ programs based
on the Bio++ libraries [76].
Polymorphism sequence data analyses
Two measures of molecular genetic diversity were used,
namely the nucleotide diversity [77] and Watterson's statistics w [78]. In the case of the haploid, maternally transmitted mtDNA, both statistics are unbiased estimates of
the N e f product under the assumption of neutrality and
mutation/drift equilibrium, where N e f is the effective
population size of females and the locus mutation rate.
and w were calculated from the total length of the analysed fragments, and expressed in per-site level of diversity
(after being divided by sequence length). We also measured the synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide
diversity ( s/ n), also expressed per synonymous site and
per non-synonymous site.

The Neutrality Index (NI, [61]) was calculated for dataset
1 when outgroups were available. This index aims at comparing the ratio of non-synonymous (= amino acid changing) to synonymous (silent) changes within species ( n/ s)
and between species (Dn/Ds): NI is one when evolution is
neutral, higher than one under purifying selection, and
lower than one in case of adaptation. n and s were estimated as described above. Dn and Ds are the non-synony-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/54

mous and synonymous pairwise sequence divergences
between related taxa, calculated using the maximum likelihood method implemented in codeml in PAML 4 [71].
Excluding low frequency variants (<0.125) when estimating NI yielded similar results (not shown). The phylogenetic tree was obtain using PHYML software [67] with
TN93 + Γ model of sequences evolution. We used the
maximum likelihood method because of the potential
underestimation of Ds in simple pairwise distance due to
multiple hits. Alignments are available at http://
kimura.univ-montp2.fr/~benoit/data.html.
Life History data and Population size estimation
Body mass, age of female sexual maturity, and maximum
longevity were obtained from the AnAge database [79].
Direct estimates of population size are available for North
American breeding birds in the North American Landbird
Conservation Plan, Breeding Bird Survey abundance data
[22], http://www.partnersinflight.org/. Life history data
and rate estimates are available at http://kimura.univmontp2.fr/~benoit/data.html.
Statistical analyses
Genetic diversity measures were arcsine-transformed [80]
and analyzed under the general linear model assumptions
using R [81]. Quantitative life-history variables were logtransformed. One-way and two-way ANOVA with interactions were performed on transformed variables. Fisher's
tests were performed using class II errors.
