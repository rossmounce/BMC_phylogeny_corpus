Abstract
Background: Many fruit-tree species, including relevant Citrus spp varieties exhibit a reproductive biology
that impairs breeding and strongly constrains genetic improvements. In citrus, juvenility increases the
generation time while sexual sterility, inbreeding depression and self-incompatibility prevent the
production of homozygous cultivars. Genomic technology may provide citrus researchers with a new set
of tools to address these various restrictions. In this work, we report a valuable genomics-based protocol
for the structural analysis of deletion mutations on an heterozygous background.
Results: Two independent fast neutron mutants of self-incompatible clementine (Citrus clementina Hort.
Ex Tan. cv. Clemenules) were the subject of the study. Both mutants, named 39B3 and 39E7, were
expected to carry DNA deletions in hemizygous dosage. Array-based Comparative Genomic
Hybridization (array-CGH) using a Citrus cDNA microarray allowed the identification of underrepresented
genes in these two mutants. Subsequent comparison of citrus deleted genes with annotated plant genomes,
especially poplar, made possible to predict the presence of a large deletion in 39B3 of about 700 kb and
at least two deletions of approximately 100 and 500 kb in 39E7. The deletion in 39B3 was further
characterized by PCR on available Citrus BACs, which helped us to build a partial physical map of the
deletion. Among the deleted genes, ClpC-like gene coding for a putative subunit of a multifunctional
chloroplastic protease involved in the regulation of chlorophyll b synthesis was directly related to the
mutated phenotype since the mutant showed a reduced chlorophyll a/b ratio in green tissues.
Conclusion: In this work, we report the use of array-CGH for the successful identification of genes
included in a hemizygous deletion induced by fast neutron irradiation on Citrus clementina. The study of
gene content and order into the 39B3 deletion also led to the unexpected conclusion that microsynteny
and local gene colinearity in this species were higher with Populus trichocarpa than with the phylogenetically
closer Arabidopsis thaliana. This work corroborates the potential of Citrus genomic resources to assist
mutagenesis-based approaches for functional genetics, structural studies and comparative genomics, and
hence to facilitate citrus variety improvement.

Background
The rapid increase of world population, the field degradation by soil salinization and erosion, and the likely fluctuations in climate caused by global warming will pose new
and known challenges to agriculture during this century
[1]. Crop improvements required to cope with these challenges could be attained through agronomic advances,
leading to a better use of fertilizers, protection agents or
soil rescue, and exploitation of recent technologies for
plant breeding. Despite the outstanding importance of
genetics-based breeding applied to spontaneous mutations and conventional hybrids, molecular and genomic
tools are expected to develop their great potential for crop
improvement through functional genetics analysis,
involving gene and function discovery and genome modification.
Citrus, some of the most important fruit crops worldwide,
are perennial trees requiring a juvenility period of several
years and frequently are parthenocarpic and sexually selfincompatible [2,3], which considerably impairs traditional breeding. Genomic technology, including methods
to rapidly identify and manipulate genes of agricultural
interest, holds promise of improvements that may be difficult through traditional approaches. In recent years, Citrus has been the target of several genomic developments
including large EST collections [4-7], cDNA and oligonucleotide-based microarrays [4,8,9], BAC libraries and BAC
end sequencing (BES) (to be published). However, functional studies, i.e. genetic transformation and the capability to perform reverse genetic analyses, are also
considerably impaired. In citrus, high throughput transgenic programs such as the generation of RNA interference
knockouts, activation tagging through enhancer elements,
gene-trap T-DNA insertions, or transposon tagging systems have not been developed yet. Since no efficient tagging or insertional procedures are available in these
species, other gene disruption methods including strategies based on genome-wide mutagenesis such as TILLING
and fast neutron mutagenesis have been initiated. These
approaches are non-transgenic and may have particular
interest for the industry where the debate on genetically
modified organisms has restricted application of these
technologies to crop improvement. Both approaches,
however, are of limited usefulness as strategies for reverse
genetics because of the lack of knowledge on Citrus
genomic sequence and the large amount of space required
for the establishment of mutant populations. ECOTILLING on natural citrus variants and microarray-based
detection of deletions in fast neutron citrus mutants are
apparently very straightforward approaches. In this work
we explore the potential of this last idea using two fast
neutron Citrus clementina hemizygous mutants from the
IVIA collection and a 20K cDNA citrus microarray.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/381

Physical mutagenesis through fast neutron irradiation has
been reported to cause variable genomic deletions ranging
in size from few base pairs to 12 kb in Arabidopsis thaliana
[10,11]. Several approaches have been used to characterize plant genomic deletions at the molecular level. These
mostly include positional cloning [12], a method applicable to any kind of genetic lesion that, however, needs
highly saturated genetic maps; PCR-based reverse genetics
techniques [11,13], requiring a previous considerable
knowledge of genomic sequence; and genomic subtraction procedures [14-16], which do not need sequence
information but are strongly dependent on the gene dosage. Since very little is known about Citrus genome
sequence and the Citrus induced deletions are in
hemizygous gene dosage, an array-based procedure as the
one employed for identifying homozygous gene deletions
in Arabidopsis [17] seems more suitable for our purpose
than those methods. Although the main application of
microarrays is transcriptome profiling analysis, microarrays can also be used to study DNA variation. Oligonucleotide arrays are particularly suited for the detection of
single nucleotide mismatches during hybridization, and
hence for the discovery of novel DNA variants or the
determination of known variants. The origin of this technique relies on a cytogenetic method described 25 years
ago named "Comparative Genomic Hybridization"
(CGH) that used differential DNA hybridization on chromosome spreads for visualization of deleted or amplified
genomic regions in tumour tissues [18]. Subsequently,
different laboratories mostly working on cancer research
independently applied microarray technology to genomic
DNA hybridization procedure, a technique consequently
named array-CGH [19-23]. Array-CGH was successfully
utilized to detect gene duplications in Arabidopsis and rice
[24], and to validate aneuploidy analysis performed by
quantitative fluorescent PCR in Arabidopsis [25]. Therefore, this method has proven to be suitable to study chromosomal imbalances in plants.
For the characterization of the deleted regions we also
leaned on comparative genomics with other dicots since
available physical citrus maps are not yet integrated with
known genetic maps. Comparative genomics takes advantage of available information on gene content and order
in genomic DNA from different species to infer phylogenetic relationships and formulate hypotheses on DNA
evolutionary dynamics. Whole genomes are preferentially
compared when available, but more often relatively short
stretches of DNA or polymorphic markers are used.
The main objective of this work was to identify deleted
genes on a heterozygous genetic Citrus background, provided by fast neutron generated mutants, through arrayComparative Genomic Hybridization. In addition, we
also explored the possibility of using comparative genom-

ics with annotated dicot genomes assisted by BAC end
sequencing for the generation of partial physical maps of
the deleted Citrus regions.

Results and discussion
Procedure for the characterization of hemizygous
deletions in Citrus
The proposed procedure to identify deleted genes is illustrated in Figure 1 and its potential to structurally characterize hemizygous deletions is exemplified below with
Citrus mutants as starting plant material. Its usefulness to
describe genomic deletions in other species might be
dependent upon genome complexity and ploidy. This
method uses cDNA microarrays to hybridize genomic
DNA extracted from the deletion mutants to render a list
of underrepresented genes. The putative deleted genes are
then validated through gene dosage evaluation by realtime PCR using gene specific primers. Deleted genes could
subsequently contribute to the identification of the
molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypes by means of a candidate gene approach, validated by

physiological analyses or genetic transformation [26]. In
non-sequenced genomes or in plants with poorly developed physical maps, further characterization of deletions
at the structural level requires TBLASTX similarity searches
against databases containing the sequence annotation of
known eudicot genomes, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa and Vitis vinifera. These searches yield
putative orthologous genes and syntenic genomic regions
between these four species. Local physical maps of deletions are built allocating the deleted gene sequences and
the syntenic genomic fragments from these other eudicots
into a BES database of the species of interest. Lastly, specific PCR on the array of BACs confirms gene content and
order on the lineal structure of the deletions. The results
may also be used in comparative genomics analyses to
study evolutionary dynamics and phylogenetics.
Identification of deleted alleles in 39B3 and 39E7 fast
neutron mutants of Citrus clementina
For this study, two mutants obtained by fast neutron
mutagenesis of wild type Citrus clementina were selected
from the IVIA mutant collection. These mutants, named
39B3 and 39E7, were expected to carry DNA deletion
lesions in hemizygous dosage and showed a delay in natural colour break in fruit peel. The 39B3 mutant exhibited
a delay in colour change from green to orange while 39E7
was better characterized by an abnormal final yellowish
colour instead of the natural orange coloration. Putative
deleted genes in the mutants were first identified through
an approach based on genomic hybridization (arrayCGH) that exploited a recently developed Citrus microarray containing 21240 cDNAs [4,5]. To this end, total
genomic DNA from four independent samples of mutants
39B3 and 39E7 were Cy3 or Cy5-labelled and cohybridized with wild type DNA labelled with the complementary Cy5 or Cy3 probe on four independent microarray
slides. Fluorescence intensity data were normalized and
single ESTs showing a mutant/wild type signal ratio lower
than 0.7 fold, with a P-value lower than 0.2 (39B3) or 0.1
(39E7), were selected as putative candidates.

The number of ESTs fulfilling these criteria was 24 and 78
for mutants 39B3 and 39E7, respectively. One of the 39B3
positives [GenBank: CX299090], composed of three unrelated sequences was discarded for subsequent analysis due
to its chimerical nature. In order to validate the arrayCGH results, gene dosage of several putative candidates
was determined through real-time PCR quantification of
mutant/wild type signals for candidate ESTs as related to
a reference undeleted gene [GenBank: CX293764]. The
results showed that gene dosage for 39B3 candidates
ranged from 0.50 to 0.60 when genomic DNA from the
39B3 genotype was tested, while ranged from 0.96 to 1.15
when the assayed DNA originated from the 39E7 genotype (Table 1). Similar results, corroborating the presence

of putative deleted genes at half dosage, were also
obtained for the 39E7 mutant. Therefore, the developed
array-CGH procedure proved to be an appropriate tool to
identify genes in hemizygous content in the self-incompatible clementine.
Clustering of homologues of Citrus deleted genes in the
poplar genome
Microsynteny comparisons with homologous stretches
from the sequenced genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa and Vitis vinifera [27-29] were performed
in order to elucidate hypothetical clustering of Citrus
deleted genes in the genome. TBLASTX, which searches for
translations of a crude genome similar to a translated
query, was utilized with an E-value cut-off of 10-5. The
homologous regions produced by the best TBLASTX hit of
each of the Citrus candidate genes were located on the
chromosome maps of Arabidopsis, poplar and grapevine.
Homologues of Citrus genes were then grouped into clusters in each species when the distance between them was
shorter than 250 kb. The second and third TBLASTX best
alignments were similarly placed in the respective maps
when they were included in an existing cluster. In this
case, a binding line was drawn linking the second and
third hits to the best hit of the same Citrus query. Thus,
two chromosomal maps, one for each mutant, in the three
species was obtained. Figure 2 represents in detail chromosome mappings of the 39B3 mutation, which was subjected to further analyses. The results indicate that the
Populus mapping exhibited rather lower complexity than
the Arabidopsis and grapevine ones since it included fewer
chromosomes and only 3 clusters although the number of
39B3 candidate genes represented in the map was identical (21) for the three genomes. Note that the number of

represented hits in these mappings is higher than 21 due
to the inclusion of second or third homologues. In Populus, most of the candidate genes mapped to two different
genome regions of approximately 700 kb long in chromosomes 12 and 15, two duplicated chromosomes that
probably originated during the recent genome duplication event that occurred in this species [28]. These two
clusters contained 17 and 15 hits respectively while the
third one placed in chromosome 16 had only one hit. In
contrast, the number of clusters in Arabidopsis and Vitis
were 9 and 11, respectively, and none of them contained
more than 11 hits. Furthermore, cluster number (and
clustering density) of the homologues of 39E7 putative
deleted genes was also lower (and higher) in Populus than
in Arabidopsis or Vitis, although the differences were
smaller: 26, 30 and 30 clusters were obtained for poplar,
Arabidopsis and grapevine respectively (Figure 3).
Overall, these observations suggest that the Populus
genomic regions homologous to the Citrus deletions were
less fragmented than their counterparts in Arabidopsis and
Vitis, and consequently microsynteny on the considered
segments was higher with the Populus genome. These
results are striking since Citrus and Arabidopsis belong to
Sapindales and Brassicales orders (inside the same clade
eurosids II) while Populus is included in the eurosids I
clade, and Vitis is part of Vitaceae, a family outside of rosids [30].

gene arrangement depicted in Figure 4. Twenty genes out
of twenty-one having high similarity with Populus homologues were directly located on the Citrus deletion fragment by combining the two clusters found on Populus
chromosomes 12 and 15, which shared 12 hits. Inclusion
of the 21st gene, a homologue of a Populus gene placed on
chromosome 16, in the 39B3 deletion was based on its
location on the right end of the Citrus BAC
CCER1019D04 (named B12, see below), whose left end
shared identity with another deleted gene [GenBank:
CX295702]. The accession number and protein similarity

Furthermore, the recent sequencing of 46,000 Citrus clementina BAC ends (to be published) enabled the construction of a physical map of the 39B3 deleted region. To this
end, two DNA sequences covering 700 kb along the Populus chromosomes 12 and 15, containing the genes homologous to the Citrus deleted candidates, were BLASTed
against the Citrus BAC end database. The homology search
identified 33 BACs with a BLASTN E value lower than 105 for both paralogous regions. In subsequent analyses,
redundant BACs were discarded, while additional candidate BACs were obtained by comparing these previous
ones with the BES database to yield overlapping BACs.

Gene composition of the Citrus 39B3 deletion
inferred from poplar homologous regions. The 39B3
deleted Citrus genes are arranged in the centre of the figure
in the order inferred from the position of their Populus
homologues found in linkage groups 12, 15 and 16. Genes are
numbered following this order. Strand sense deduced from
poplar counterparts is indicated by an arrow.

of an ATP-dependent Clp protease, whose sequence was
shared by both BACs. Similarly B12 and B13 interaction is
mediated by unigene aCL1915Contig2 (Table 2, 3). Realtime PCR quantification of gene dosage for some of the
BAC ends (Figure 5A) confirmed the presence of these
sequences at half dosage in the mutant genotype, indicating that the 39B3 mutation is a hemizygous deletion.
Indeed, all analyzed BACs covered an internal segment of
the deletion except B13 that exhibited haploid gene dosage on the left end and diploid dosage on the right one,
suggesting that B13 contained the 3' border of the 39B3
deletion.
The above results indicated that the microsynteny
between Citrus and Populus genomes was high enough to
predict gene arrangement and to build a partial physical
map of a Citrus genomic segment of about 700 kb, as
inferred from the length of poplar homologous regions.
Nevertheless, the observation that a 700 kb Citrus fragment only contains 21 genes may result striking considering an average distance of 10 Kb between adjacent genes,
as deduced from the estimations of Citrus genome size
(367 Mb) and gene number (35,000–40,000). It should
be noted, however, that the microarray used in these analyses contains between approximately 2/3 and 1/2 of the
estimated gene content of the Citrus genome, which may
account for a major part of the hypothetical "loss" of
deleted candidates. While this is a weakness of the currently available Citrus arrays, non-attributable to the
array-CGH procedure, more complete results are expected

after the development of a more representative cDNA
microarray. Other limitations of the method may be
related to the differential hybridization potential of different cDNAs, including for instance cross-hybridizations. In
this regard, oligonucleotide arrays are particularly suited
for the detection of dissimilar DNA variants. Alternatively,
synteny might be limited to several genes located on a
bulk of non-conserved sequences inside this 700 Kb
region, a possibility that may only be corroborated after
genome sequencing.
Overall, the data indicated that the Populus genome is a
useful model for comparative genomics which may be
used to characterize hemizygous deletions in Citrus.
The Citrus 39B3 deletion shows higher local gene
colinearity with Populus than with Arabidopsis
Local gene colinearity between two genomic fragments is
determined by the number of paralogous genes arranged
in the same order. Therefore, not only permanence of
genes in their original chromosomal location, but also
conservation of gene order, affects local colinearity. In
order to validate the gene arrangement postulated in Figure 4 and consequently to estimate gene colinearity of the
39B3 Citrus deletion with Populus homologous fragments,
we mapped by PCR the 21 genes listed in Table 2 on the

physical map of Figure 5B. All but three genes showed at
least one PCR product on the array of 13 BACs, confirming that those genes were effectively included in the 39B3
deletion (Figure 6A). In addition, PCR reactions reproduced at the BAC size resolution the expected gene order
outlined in Figure 4, corroborating the gene arrangement
deduced by comparative genomics. In Figure 6B, the genes
rendering a positive PCR signal were linked to the physical
map position with an arrow. Moreover, genes 3, 4 and 9

unigenes
aCL3991Contig1,
aC18005F10Rv_c and aC16014F08SK_c, respectively, did
not show a detectable PCR signal on purified BACs,
although their respective primers produced a band of the
expected size when tested against genomic DNA from normal clementine cultivar (data not shown). These genes
were most likely placed into the two reported internal
gaps of the physical map, as suggested by the border situation of their neighbouring genes.
These results confirm high local gene colinearity with
poplar in the genomic region covered by 39B3 deletion.
Taking together gene content and order conservation (Figures 2, 3 and 6), it is inferred that in the studied DNA
deleted segment there was higher gene colinearity with
Populus, which diverged about 109 million years ago
(Mya), than with Arabidopsis, splitting from the Citrus lin-

eage about 87 Mya [30], despite gene colinearity generally
being correlated with phylogenetic relatedness. A similar
conclusion has been reached in our group, after comparing the whole collection of Citrus BES with the poplar and
Arabidopsis genomes (to be published), and also in previous works in papaya and melon. In papaya, BES alignment to the annotated genomes rendered higher gene
colinearity with Populus than with Arabidopsis, although
both Arabidopsis and papaya belong to the order Brassicales [31]. In melon, microsynteny studies based on the
sequence of two BACs also concluded that melon was
closer to Populus than to Arabidopsis or Medicago truncatula
[32]. These observations may be explained by a differential genome evolutionary dynamics in poplar and Arabidopsis lineages [33]. The more recent appraisals estimated
that last whole genome duplications occurred not later
than 60–65 Mya in Populus and around 24–40 Mya in Arabidopsis lineages [28,34-36]. Despite the older poplar

event, genome rearrangements involving gene loss and
translocation following these duplications were much
more frequent in Arabidopsis ancestors [37]. Such a highly
active genome dynamics probably caused the dispersion
of genes and the subsequent reduction in synteny and
gene colinearity with even related species. The different
behaviour of Populus and Arabidopsis ancestral genomes
still deserves further explanation. It has been suggested
that woody long-lived species like poplar trees may
undergo a slower genome dynamics due to their juvenile
period that delays sexual fecundation for several years and
to the recurrent contribution of gametes from aged individuals of previous generations [28]. In addition, species

like Arabidopsis thaliana may have very active mechanisms
for unequal or illegitimate recombination causing frequent chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations, insertions and deletions. In this context, it is
notable that nearly all Citrus species and many related
genera have 2n = 18, probably indicating slow chromosomal evolution in this group.
Chlorophyll a/b ratio is modified in 39B3 mutant
Structural studies describing gene arrangement on a particular deletion have outstanding importance for linking a
specific mutant phenotype with an impaired gene. The
39B3 deletion removed at least a set of 21 genes and
resulted in delayed chlorophyll catabolism. Although in
principle, no obvious candidate genes could be unequivocally related to the exocarp colour break retardation, the
39B3 mutant certainly exhibited altered chlorophyll a and
b content. Ratios of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b contents in 39B3 mutant were about 15% to 23% lower than
those found in wild type when three different green tissues were tested: fruit exocarp, old and young leaves (Figure 7). This distinct chlorophyll composition was not
accompanied by alterations in the total content of chlorophylls in the leaves although pigment levels in 39B3 fruit
exocarp, as expected, were clearly higher (0.48 mg/g fresh
weight) than in the peel of control fruit (0.15 mg/g fresh
weight) that has initiated chlorophyll degradation (Table
4). The chlorophyll accumulation observed in the 39B3
exocarp, however, is higher than the maximum reached in
normal clementine fruits (0.35 mg/g f w) [38], suggesting
that the mutation also induced total chlorophyll build-up
in the fruit peel. Indeed, fruit exocarps of a "wild type"
clementine tree showing fruit colour delay due to altered
environmental conditions showed chlorophyll a/b ratios
equivalent to those found in the standard cultivar (Figure
7) while total pigments had an intermediate value (0.29
mg/g f w) between those of normal and 39B3 genotypes
(Table 4).

Unigene aCL766Contig1, one of the 39B3 hits validated
by real-time quantitative PCR (Table 1) coding for a ClpClike protein, may have certain relevance to the altered
chlorophyll composition found in 39B3 mutant. Plant

ClpCs are ATP-binding proteins located in the stroma of
chloroplasts which have been found to be associated with
the protein import machinery [39] and with the Clp protease complex [40]. In fact, ClpC has been related to protein translocation across the chloroplast inner envelope
membrane and to multiple processes requiring proteolytic cleavage, as protein turnover and regulation [41,42].
In Arabidopsis, insertional mutagenesis in the ClpC1 gene
caused chlorosis, growth retardation, photosynthetic
damage and defects in chloroplast protein import [43-45]
and no double knock-outs of ClpC1 and the less expressed
ClpC2 genes were obtained, suggesting that ClpC function
is essential in plants [46]. In addition, a mutant impaired
in ClpC1 mRNA processing accumulated chlorophyllide a
oxygenase protein (CAO), a key enzyme for the synthesis
of chlorophyll b from chlorophyll a, leading to a reduced
chlorophyll a/b ratio [47]. Interestingly, aCL4690Contig1
unigene coding for another subunit of Clp complexes
(ClpD-like) with sequence similarity to aCL766Contig1
showed half gene dosage (Table 1) and was also included
in the 39B3 deletion. Expression of both ClpC-like and
ClpD-like genes was analyzed in fruit exocarps from wild
type and 39B3 mutant at two different developmental
stages: green immature peel (September) and shortly after
the time of natural colour break in wild type peel
(November). Both genes showed reduced expression in
the 39B3 mutant, an observation that was well correlated
with the alteration in chlorophyll composition since
ClpC-like and ClpD-like alleles in the hemizygous 39B3
mutant reached about a half of the expression values

found in the wild type (Figure 8). These results suggest
that wild type alleles are similarly expressed in the peel of
clementine fruit. Furthermore, sequencing of the ClpClike gene that according to its Arabidopsis homologue plays
a major role in chlorophyll composition, also revealed
that there were no essential differences between wild type
and 39B3 mutant coding regions (Additional file 1). This
observation corroborated that not only expression but
also protein sequence were identical in the analyzed ClpClike alleles. In the wild type, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were observed in two different introns,
which were very likely unable to alter protein stability or
function. These single base variants that were detected as
sequence ambiguities (N) were due to the presence of
overlapping base peaks contributed by both alleles, while
hemizygous ClpC-like gene in 39B3 mutant produced an
unambiguous signal in the same positions. Bases 2572,
4104 and 4119 located on the forth and sixth introns were
identified as guanine, guanine and adenine in the mutant,
while a mix of guanine and thymine, guanine and ade-

nine and adenine and thymine were respectively found in
wild type DNA (Figure 9). While the contribution of the
ClpC-like gene dosage to the retardation of the natural
exocarp degreening remains to be unequivocally demonstrated, the data presented above clearly shows that there
is a strong correlation between chlorophyll composition
and the presence of a single allele in the mutant. Additional analysis of the remaining genes inside 39B3 deletion should be performed in order to accomplish a
complete candidate gene approach

Conclusion
In this study, we propose a procedure for the genetic characterization of genomic hemizygous deletions in citrus
mutants. The procedure that might be applied to other
non-sequenced species of similar genome size and ploidy
level is illustrated with the study of the 39B3 Citrus clementina deletion, generated by fast neutron bombardment.
The proposed strategy utilizes several genomic resources
such as array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization
(array-CGH) technology, EST and BAC end sequencing
databases and poplar genome annotation.

colinearity studies concluding that in the studied region
Citrus is more similar to Populus than to Arabidopsis, a phylogenetically closer species. This observation supports previous works on other species and suggests that the
Arabidopsis lineage underwent a quicker genome evolutionary dynamics than the Populus one.
Among the deleted alleles, the function of ClpC-like, coding for a putative subunit of a protease involved in chlorophyll b synthesis was directly related to the mutant
phenotype since green mutant tissues had a lower chlorophyll a/b ratio.

Methods
Plant material
Approximately 6 years-old clementine trees (Citrus clementina Hort. Ex Tan. cv. clemenules) grown under standard agricultural practices at the Instituto Valenciano de
Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA) were used in this study.
Commercial highly heterozygous clementine cultivars are
considered "wild type" material, while the 39B3 and 39E7
genotypes that belong to the IVIA mutant collection were
obtained through bud irradiation with fast neutrons (5–6
Gy) at the Instituto Tecnologico e Nuclear (Sacavem, Portugal) in the frame of a much wider breeding program.
Both mutants are expected to carry DNA deletion lesions
in hemizygous dosage and showed altered patterns of colour change of fruit peel.
Array-CGH
The protocol was adapted from several published arrayComparative Genomic Hybridization (array-CGH) methods pursuing mainly the measurement of copy-number
changes in human genomic DNA [48-50], and the study
of large-scale genetic variation of the symbiotic bacteria
Sinorhizobium meliloti [51]. Genomic DNA was isolated
from leaves of wild type and mutant plants, using DNeasy
plant mini kit (Qiagen). Four Cy3 or Cy5-labelled independent biological samples from each mutant plant were
co-profiled on four 20K Citrus cDNA microarrays containing 21240 EST, using Cy5 or Cy3-labelled control
genomic DNA, respectively. Label probes were prepared
as follow: Cy3- or Cy5-dCTP fluorescent nucleotides
(Amersham Biosciences) were incorporated directly in
control and mutant genomic DNA (2 μg) using BioPrime
Array CGH Genomic Labelling System (Invitrogene).
Purified Cy5 and Cy3 labelled probes (about 50 μl each)
were combined and mixed with 30 μg Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogene), 100 μg yeast tRNA (Invitrogene), and 346 μl TE
buffer pH 7.4. Cot-1 DNA and yeast tRNA were used to
block non-specific hybridization. Samples were laid on a
microcon YM-30 filter (Millipore), and subsequently centrifuged until sample volume was reduced to approximately 48 μl. Finally, 10.2 μl 20× SSC and 1.8 μl 10% SDS
were added to the probe mixture to reach a final volume

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/381

of 60 μl containing 3.4× SSC and 0.3% SDS. For microarray hybridization, the probe mixture was denatured by
heating at 97°C for 5 minutes, and immediately incubated at 37°C during 30 minutes to block repetitive DNA
sequences. Hybridization mixture was applied to a 37°C
pre-warmed hybrid-slip (Sigma), and a pre-warmed array
slide was lowered onto the mix. Microarrays were hybridized in darkness at 65°C overnight (16–20 hours) using a
glass array cassette following manufacturer's instructions
(Ambion, cat. n° AM10040). To prevent evaporation of
hybridization solution during incubation, 5 μl of 3× SCC
were poured into the reservoir inside the cassette chamber. Following hybridization, microarray slides were
placed in a rack and the cover slip removed by 10 minutes
immersion in a washing chamber containing 2× SSC and
0.03% SDS at room temperature (RT). Microarray slides
were passed through a series of washes on a shaking platform. Wash series were as follow: 2× SSC, 0.03% SDS for
5 min at 65°C, followed by 1× SSC for 5 min at RT, and 3
× 15 min washes in 0.2× SSC at RT. After first wash slides
were transferred to new racks to minimize transference of
SDS to the next washing solution. Microarray slides were
dried by centrifugation for 5 min at 300 rpm by using an
Eppendorf 5804-R tabletop centrifuge. Arrays were immediately scanned at 5 μm. Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence intensity was collected by using a ScanArray Gx (Perkin Elmer).
The resulting images were overlaid and spots identified by
the ScanArray Express program (Perkin Elmer). Spot quality was first measured by the signal-to-background
method with parameters lower limit (200) and multiplier
(2), and subsequently confirmed by visual test. Data analysis was performed using the Limma package from the R
statistical computing software [52-54]. A mutant/wild
type signal lower than 0.7, with a P-value not higher than
0.1 (39E7) or 0.2 (39B3) were the cut-off values for positive EST identification. The experimental design of microarray experiments has been loaded into the ArrayExpress
database [55] under accessions E-MEXP-1432 and EMEXP-1433.
Gene dosage measurements
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a LightCycler 2.0 instrument (Roche), using the LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit (Roche).
Reaction composition and conditions followed manufacturer's instructions. Each individual PCR reaction contained 2 ng of genomic DNA from wild type or mutant,
obtained with the DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen).
Cycling protocol consisted of 10 min at 95°C for preincubation, then 40 cycles of 10 sec at 95°C for denaturation, 10 sec at 60°C for annealing and 10–25 sec at 72°C
for extension. Fluorescent intensity data were acquired
during the extension time. Specificity of the PCR reaction
was assessed by the presence of a single peak in the dissociation curve after the amplification and through size esti-

mation of the amplified product. For gene dosage
measurements, we used the relative quantification-monocolor analysis from the LightCycler Software 4.0 package
(Roche). This program compares the ratio of a target
sequence to a reference DNA sequence in the mutant sample with the ratio of these sequences in a wild type sample.
PCR and normalized calculations were repeated in at least
three independent samples from each mutant and wild
type, rendering an estimation of target gene dosage in the
mutant genotype. Primers for the reference sequence were
obtained from CX293764.
Similarity searches
DNA sequences of Citrus unigenes containing positive
array-CGH ESTs were used in online TBLASTX searches
against genomic databases from the annotated genomes
of Arabidopsis thaliana [56], Populus trichocarpa [57] and
Vitis vinifera [58] at an E-value cut-off of 10-5. For each
gene, the best hit was placed on a chromosomal map
while the second and third hits were only positioned in
the map if they were located closer than 250 kb to any
other hit. Two 700 kb regions from chromosomes 12 and
15 from the Populus genome including homologous genes
to 39B3 array-CGH positive unigenes, were used as queries in a BLASTN local search on a Citrus BAC end
sequence database. Only hits corresponding to those BAC
ends showing an E-value lower than 10-5 in both chromosome searches were considered for the building of a local
physical map of the 39B3 deletion.
BAC isolation and analysis
DNA from Citrus BACs was isolated with the Rapid Plasmid Miniprep System (Marligen Biosciences). Purified
BACs were used as templates in PCR reactions in a total
volume of 15 μl, including 0.2 mM dNTP, 2 mM MgCl2,
0.5 μM of each primer, 0.38 units of Netzyme DNA
polymerase (Molecular Netline Bioproducts) and 0.1 ng
of BAC DNA. After an initial denaturing step for 5 min at
95°C, amplification was performed for 35 cycles of 30 sec
at 95°C, 30 sec at 60°C and 30 sec at 72°C, followed by
5 min incubation at 72°C. The PCR product was subjected
to 1.5% agarose DNA electrophoresis.
Chlorophyll measurements
At least, three developing and mature leaves and fruit exocarp sectors from standard and 39B3 mutant lines of
clementine were randomly collected per sample. Fruit
exocarp tissues from a wild type clementine tree showing
fruit colour delay due to altered environmental conditions were also sampled for chlorophyll analyses. Chlorophylls a and b were extracted with N,Ndimethylformamide for 72 h in the dark at 4°C and quantified through the absorbance at 647 and 664 nm following a reported procedure [59]. Absorbance was measured

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/381

using a Varian Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer
(Varian).
Gene expression measurements
Total RNA was extracted from fruit exocarp of wild type
and 39B3 mutant using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration was determined by a fluorometric assay with the RiboGreen dye (Molecular Probes)
following the manufacturer's instructions. About 5 μg of
total RNA were reverse transcribed with the SuperScript III
First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) in a
total volume of 20 μl. Single strand cDNA corresponding
to ClpC-like and ClpD-like genes was amplified by quantitative real-time PCR on a LightCycler 2.0 instrument
(Roche), using the LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS
SYBR Green I kit (Roche). One μl of a 20 times diluted
first-strand cDNA was used for each amplification reaction. Cycling protocol consisted of 10 min at 95°C for
pre-incubation, then 40 cycles of 10 sec at 95°C for denaturation, 10 sec at 60°C for annealing and 15 sec at 72°C
for extension. Melting curve analysis by applying increasing temperature from 65°C to 95°C (0.1°C/s) and gel
electrophoresis of final product confirmed single amplicons. For expression measurements, we used the absolute
quantification analysis from the LightCycler Software 4.0
package (Roche), and calculated expression levels relative
to wild type values. Three independent biological samples
were analyzed for wild type and mutant genotypes. Primers sequences are provided in Additional file 2.
ClpC-like genomic sequence
ClpC-like genomic sequence from very few base pairs after
the ATG until few base pairs before the stop codon was
divided in four PCR fragments: Amplicon 3/4 (1820 bp)
was amplified and sequenced with primers CLPC3 and
CLPC4, amplicon 5/8 (2168 bp) was amplified with
primers CLPC5 and CLPC8 and sequenced with primers
CLPC5, CLPC8, CLPC10 and CLPC11, amplicon 7/2
(1446 bp) was amplified and sequenced with primers
CLPC7 and CLPC2, and amplicon 1/6 (1158 bp) was
amplified and sequenced with primers CLPC1 and
CLPC6. Each amplicon was obtained by combining the
product of 6–8 independent reactions. Primers sequences
are provided in Additional file 2.
