Abstract
Background: Microbial proteases are one of the most commercially valuable enzymes, of which the largest market
share has been taken by subtilases or alkaline proteases of the Bacillus species. Despite a large amount of
information on microbial proteases, a search for novel proteases with unique properties is still of interest for both
basic and applied aspects of this highly complex class of enzymes. Oxidant stable proteases (OSPs) have been
shown to have a wide application in the detergent and bleaching industries and recently have become one of the
most attractive enzymes in various biotechnological applications.
Results: A gene encoding a novel member of the subtilase superfamily was isolated from Virgibacillus sp. SK37, a
protease-producing bacterium isolated from Thai fish sauce fermentation. The gene was cloned by an activitybased screening of a genomic DNA expression library on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 1 mM IPTG and
3% skim milk. Of the 100,000 clones screened, all six isolated positive clones comprised one overlapping open
reading frame of 45% identity to the aprX gene from Bacillus species. This gene, designated aprX-sk37 was cloned
into pET21d(+) and over-expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The enzyme product, designated AprX-SK37, was purified
by an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography to apparent homogeneity and characterized. The AprX-SK37
enzyme showed optimal catalytic conditions at pH 9.5 and 55°C, based on the azocasein assay containing 5 mM
CaCl2. Maximum catalytic activity was found at 1 M NaCl with residual activity of 30% at 3 M NaCl. Thermal stability
of the enzyme was also enhanced by 1 M NaCl. The enzyme was absolutely calcium-dependent, with optimal
concentration of CaCl2 at 15 mM. Inhibitory effects by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid indicated that this enzyme is a metal-dependent serine protease. The enzyme
activity was sensitive towards reducing agents, urea, and SDS, but relatively stable up to 5% of H2O2. Phylogenetic
analysis suggested that AprX-SK37 belongs to a novel family of the subtilase superfamily. We propose the name of
this new family as alkaline serine protease-X (AprX).
Conclusions: The stability towards H2O2 and moderately halo- and thermo-tolerant properties of the AprX-SK37
enzyme are attractive for various biotechnological applications.

Background
Microbial proteases are one of the most commercially
valuable enzymes [1], of which the largest market share
has been taken by subtilases or alkaline proteases of the
Bacillus species, which has been extensively studied in
terms of both biological properties and applications
[1-3]. Subtilase is the superfamily of subtilisin-like serine
proteases [4] in the clan SB of serine peptidases, family

S8, according to the MEROPS database [5]. It is one of
the biggest clans of serine peptidases and ubiquitously
distributed in various organisms, including bacteria,
archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses [6]. Based on amino
acid sequence similarity, they are classified into six
families: subtilisins, thermitase, proteinase K, lantibiotic
peptidase, kexin, and pyrolysin [4]. Subtilisins are
further classified into six subfamilies namely, true subtilisins, high-alkaline proteases, intracellular proteases [4],
phylogenetically intermediate subtilisins (PISs) [7,8],
high molecular mass subtilisins (HMSs) [9,10], and oxidant stable proteases (OSPs) [11,12]. The latter subfamily, OSPs, has been shown to have a wide application in

the detergent and bleaching industries and has recently
become one of the most attractive enzymes in various
biotechnological applications. [8,11-17].
Despite the tremendous amount of information on
microbial proteases, a search for novel proteases with
unique properties is still of interest for both basic and
applied aspects of these highly complex class of enzymes
[2]. In addition to a classical method of screening for a
new microorganism harbouring an interesting protease
from various environments [2], different molecular biology techniques, such as directed evolution [18,19], site
directed mutagenesis [20] and metagenomic analysis
[21], have been used to engineer numerous proteases
with improved or novel properties. By applying DNA
technology, it is essential that the gene of the protease
of interest is cloned, engineered and expressed in an
efficient host.
In this research, a genomic library of Virgibacillus sp.
SK37, a moderately halophilic bacterium isolated from
Thai fish sauce [22] was constructed and screened for
heterologous protease expression in Escherichia coli.
After an extensive screening, one open reading frame
encoding a gene similar to aprX was obtained. This
gene was cloned, over-expressed in E. coli and purified
by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography
(IMAC). Biochemical characterization of the purified
enzyme revealed that this novel protease was relatively
oxidant stable and moderately halo- and thermo-tolerant. This is the first report on the biochemical characterization of the recombinant AprX-related serine
protease. In addition, the evolutionary relationship of
this enzyme with other AprXs from different bacteria
and other enzymes in the subtilases superfamily was
studied.

Results
Genomic DNA library construction and screening

Screening of a Virgibacillus sp. SK37 genomic DNA
expression library in E. coli DH10B was done on LBskim milk agar plates as described in the materials and
methods section. An enumeration analysis determined
the size of the genomic library to be 1.56 × 105 clones
with 15% background (blue colonies harboring selfligated plasmid), yielding 1.33 × 105 clones with inserts.
When an average size of 4.4 × 106 bp of bacilli genomic
DNA was considered (calculated from whole genome
sizes available from the NCBI database), this library theoretically covered the genome size of at least 91 and
302 times (depth of coverage) when the DNA fragments
of 3,000 and 10,000 bps, respectively, were taken into
account. Of approximately 100,000 clones screened
(accounting for more than 68 depth of coverage), six
clones showed clear halo zones, indicating the presence
of proteolytic activity. The recombinant plasmids were

individually extracted from these six clones and their
DNA inserts were analyzed. Restriction digestion analysis showed that among these 6 clones, there were four
different DNA inserts based upon size: ~ 3,300 bp (1
clone), ~3,800 bp (1 clone), ~4,300 bp (3 clones), and
~5,300 bp (1 clone). Remarkably, nucleotide sequence
analysis of these clones indicated that they all shared
overlapping nucleotide sequences, resulting in an open
reading frame (ORF) of only one putative gene.
Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences analysis

The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of
the isolated ORF and its flanking sequences are shown
in Figure 1. The ORF begins with the ATG start codon
at nucleotide position 1 and terminates with the TGA
termination codon at nucleotide position 1,294. A
sequence with good consensus to the canonical ribosomal binding-site (AAGGAG) was found 10 bp upstream
from the ATG start codon. Two putative promoters (PL
and PS) showing moderate consensus to the sA promoter corresponding to the -10 and -35 regions were
located at nucleotide positions -166 and -189 for the PL
and -63 and -81 for the PS, respectively (Figure 1). An
inverted-repeat sequence from nucleotide 1,440 to 1,465
is found 143 bp downstream of the termination codon.
The ORF in the nucleotide sequence encodes 431 amino
acids with a calculated molecular mass (MM) of 47,100
Da, and predicted pI of 5.2. Comparison of the amino
acid sequence of this enzyme with other proteases in
the subtilase superfamily is shown in table 1. Except for
subtilase family D, the deduced amino acid sequence
exhibited resemblance to members of the subtilase
superfamily (subtilisin-like proteases) with 20 to 27%
identity as determined by ClastalW2. In addition, the
coding enzyme shows a limited similarity to the AprXs
from Bacillus sp. SG-1 (ZP_01859218), B. licheniformis
ATCC 14580 (YP_079346), and B. amyloliquefaciens
FZB42 (YP_001421301) with 45, 43, and 42% identity,
respectively. Apr-related enzymes are alkaline serine
proteases encoded from the apr gene found mostly in
the class bacilli. To date, a number of apr genes have
been identified such as aprA (Alkaline protease from B.
thuringiensis), aprE (Subtilisin E from B. subtilis; AprE
from B. amyloliquefaciens; M-protease from B. clausii;
Elastase from B. cereus), aprN (Subtilisin Nattokinase
from B. subtilis subsp. “natto”), aprJ (Subtilisin J from B.
stearothermophilus), aprQ (Subtilisin ALP from Bacillus
sp.), aprM (AprM from Bacillus sp.), aprS (Subtilisin
Sendi from Bacillus sp. G-825-6), and aprX (i.e., AprX
from B. subtilis) [23]. Herein, we designated our recently
isolated gene from Virgibacillus sp. SK37 as aprX-sk37
and the encoded enzyme as AprX-SK37. The DNA
sequence of this novel enzyme has been submitted to
GenBank and its accession number is HM587897.

Figure 1 Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the gene aprX-sk37. Translation starts at position 1. The aprX-sk37 gene
comprises a 1293 bp ORF encoding 431 amino acid residues, indicated as single-letters above the nucleotide sequence. The nucleotide and
predicted amino acid are numbered on the right and left sides. The predicted -35 and -10 regions of the putative short and long promoters (PS
and PL) are presented in bold. The putative ribosomal binding site (RBS) and the transcription terminator sequences are underlined. Residues
involving in the hypothetical catalytic triad, Asp140, His178, and Ser367, are boxed. The stop codon is indicated by an asterisk.

Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of the Aprrelated enzymes obtained from the SwissProt database
and AprX-SK37 is shown in Figure 2. The similarity to
other AprX enzymes starts from residue 130 of AprXSK37 and extends nearly to the C-terminus of the protein. Aspartic acid, histidine, and serine in the catalytic

triad and asparagine in the oxyanion hole of subtilases
are fully conserved in the AprX-SK37 sequence (Asp140,
His178, Ser367, and Asn276, respectively, according to the
AprX-SK37 numbering). All common secondary structure elements of enzymes belonging to the subtilases [4]
could be found in the catalytic core of AprX-SK37.

Note: Percent identity and similarity were calculated by the ClastalW2 and expressed as percentage compared to AprX-SK37 sequence. Protein ID(s) were
retrieved from the UniPort databank (http://www.uniprot.org/).

When alignment gaps of at least three amino acids are
considered, among the AprX sequences, AprX-SK37
shows unique insertion and deletion regions. The deletions are between Lys29 and Glu30 (12 residues), Gly235,
and Ile236 (3 residues), while the insertion is found from
Pro152 to Asn154 (3 residues) according to AprX-SK37
numbering. AprX-SK37 lacks a canonical signal
sequence for membrane translocation (signal peptide) at
its N-terminus, indicating an intracellular location as
suggested by sub-cellular prediction servers of SignalP
3.0 [24] and ProtCompB (Softberry Bioinformatics tools:
http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml). This prediction
agreed with all known AprXs, which lack N-terminal
signal sequences for secretion as well.
Phylogenetic tree analysis

The predicted amino acid sequence of AprX-SK37 was
aligned and compared with those of well-characterized
proteases in the subtilase superfamily retrieved from
MEROPS [5] and the SwissPort [23] databases. Oxidant
stable proteases (OSPs) from various strains were also
included in the alignment (indicated by black dots). The
phylogenetic tree was inferred using the neighbor-joining
algorithm, as shown in Figure 3. The Sequences aligned
are: subtilisin E (SubE) (P04189) from Bacillus subtilis

EciPlantibiotic (EciP) (O54221) from Staphylococcus epidermidis; and AprX-SK37 (HM587897).
The subtilase superfamily was phylogenetically
grouped into six clusters: subtilisins, thermitase, proteinase K, lantibiotic peptidases, kexin, and pyrolysins
(indicated by solid square brackets), which represent
subtiliase family S8A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively, [4].
From our analysis, AprX-SK37 was not categorized into
any of these families, but shared the same cluster with
other AprXs, which was positioned apart from other
subtilase families (dashed square bracket). Notably,
within the AprX cluster, AprX-SK37 is relatively distant
from other AprXs. Most OSPs that are produced from
alkaliphilic bacilli are clustered together in the tree
(dashed square bracket), i.e. E-1, LP-Ya, and SD-521
from B. cohnii DSM 6307, NP-1 from B. halmapalus
DSM8723, KP-43 from Bacillus sp. KSM-KP43 [17].
However, some of OSPs such as sapB (AM748727) from
B. pumilus CBS [15], LD1 (AB085752) from Bacillus sp.
KSM-LD [8], and I-52 from B. clausii I-52 [16,25], were
not located in the OSPs cluster, but appeared to be
members of the subtilisin family.
Over-expression and purification of recombinant
Virgibacillus AprX-SK37

To express the recombinant Virgibacillus AprX-SK37,
the aprX-sk37 gene (nucleotide no. -39 to 1293, according to Figure 1) was amplified by PCR and cloned into
the XbaI and XhoI restriction sites of pET21d(+) vector
such that the ribosomal binding site (RBS) and the start

above the alignment; common structural elements are shown as; rectangular for a-helices, arrow for b-sheet strands, and filled thin bar for
calcium binding domain [42]. Identical and similar (>75%) amino acid residues among all enzymes are shaded in black and gray, respectively.
Conserved amino acid residues involved in the active side (Asp, His, and Ser) are indicated by asterisks below the alignments. Signal and propeptide are marked by a gray-letter and underline, respectively.

Figure 3 Phylogenetic tree of enzymes in the subtilase superfamily based on amino acid sequence similarity in catalytic domains. The
bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates was taken to represent the evolutionary history of the sequence analyzed. Branches
corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the
associated sequence clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. All positions containing gaps and
missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 66 positions in the final dataset. The subtilase
superfamily is classified as recommended by Siezen et al [4] (square brackets). The subtilisin family is subdivided into true subtilisins,
phylogenetically intermediate subtilisins between true subtilisins and high-alkaline protease (PIS), high-alkaline proteases, high-molecular-mass
subtilisins (HMS), and intracellular subtilisins [17] (dotted square brackets). AprX-SK37 from Virgibacillus sp. SK37 in this study (underlined) is a
member of the novel AprX family. Black dots indicate oxidant stable proteases (OSPs). The newly classified alkaline serine protease X (AprX)
family (dashed square bracket), proposed in this study is marked with a star.

codon of the vector were replaced by those of the native
gene. Notably, the RBS of the expression vector and
aprX-sk37 gene are identical (AAGGAG). The recombinant plasmid, pET-AprX-SK37 was expressed using E.
coli BL21(DE3) as an expression host. E. coli BL21/pETAprX-SK37 was cultured as described in the materials
and methods section. To optimize the induction condition, samples from various fractions including inclusion
body, cytoplasm, periplasmic space, and culture supernatant taken at various time points after induction with different concentration of IPTG were analyzed by SDSPAGE and activity assay. E. coli BL21 carrying empty
pET21d (+) vector was used as a control, of which no significant enzymatic activity could be detected. Upon
induction with 0.1 mM IPTG, the recombinant enzyme
could only be found in the cytoplasmic fraction as soluble
protein. No enzyme could be detected in the periplasmic
extract or the culture supernatant (data not shown).
Neither lowering the temperature nor varying the concentration of IPTG dramatically affected expression level
of the enzyme as determined by SDS-PAGE (data not
shown). Routinely, ~16 mg of purified recombinant
AprX-SK37 could be obtained from 1-liter culture. The
C-terminal 6xHis-tagged enzyme could be purified from
cleared cell lysate by one step affinity chromatography
using Ni-NTA resin in native condition to apparent
homogeneity as shown in Figure 4 (lane 1 and 2). The
purified AprX-SK37 showed a MM of 46 kDa on SDSPAGE, which corresponded well to the theoretical mass
of 47 kDa. In the native PAGE analysis, proteolytic activity could be observed by casein-zymogram (Figure 4, lane
4) at the corresponding position on the Coomassie
stained gel (Figure 4, lane 3). Zymographic assay in a
denatured condition was impracticable due to enzyme
sensitivity towards SDS, even though an in-gel refolding
step was performed (data not shown).
Effects of pH and temperature

The optimal pH of AprX-SK37 was determined based
on azocaseinolytic activity. The enzyme is more active at
pH 8.5 and 9.0 when using Tris-HCl buffer than Trisglycine buffer. However, AprX-SK37 showed a maximal
activity at pH 9.5 in the Tris-glycine buffer (Figure 5a).
No activity was found at pH lower than 7.5, indicating
an alkaline protease characteristic. Azocaseinolytic activity was maximum around 55°C (Figure 5b). The enzyme
appeared to be activated after pre-incubation for 2 h at
25-30°C prior to the assay. Whereas, after 2 h of preincubation time, 50% and 0% residual activity was
detected at 47°C and beyond 50°C, respectively.
Effects of NaCl and CaCl2

characteristics [26,27]. Therefore, the effects of NaCl and
CaCl 2 on the activity of AprX-SK37 were studied. As
demonstrated in Figure 5c (diamond, solid line) the activity of AprX-SK37 increased slightly when NaCl was
added, and showed maximum activity at 1 M. The activity decreased to 30% at 3 M NaCl. On the contrary, subtilisin A, which was used as a control, did not show NaClactivated characteristics as indicated by a decrease in
activity with increasing concentration of NaCl as shown
in Figure 5c (square, solid line). Both AprX-SK37 and
subtilisin A appeared to require at least 0.25 M of NaCl
to retain their original activities after incubation at 25°C
for 24 h (Figure 5c, dashed lines). When the AprX-SK37
enzyme was first pre-incubated with 0.5 - 3 M NaCl for
24 h at 25°C and pH 9.5, the activity was enhanced up to
125% (Figure 5c, diamond, dashed lines). These NaClenhancing stability effects could not be observed in subtilisin A (Figure 5c, square, dashed lines).
In addition to NaCl, AprX-SK37 also showed a CaCl2dependent characteristic as shown in Figure 5d (diamond, solid line). The enzyme was inactive in the
absence of Ca2+ and required 15 mM CaCl2 for its maximal activity. This is opposite to the Ca2+ independent

gradually decreased when the CaCl2 concentration was
higher than 30 mM. The remaining activities of AprXSK37 and subtilisin A, when CaCl 2 reached 100 mM,
were 66 and 73%, respectively. Both enzymes showed
moderate stability (50% remaining activity) after preincubation for 24 h at 25°C.

inhibition by EDTA indicated a metal-dependent character of this enzyme. However, bestatin, a metalloprotease inhibitor selective for aminopeptidases, had no
inhibitory effect. The enzyme was very sensitive to
detergent (SDS), and reducing agents such as DTT and
BME, whereas the inhibitor E-64, which is an active-site
titrant of cysteine proteases, as well as IAA and NEM,
did not affect enzyme activity (Table 2). Note that CaCl2
was routinely added to the standard enzyme assay.

Effects of reducing agents and various inhibitors

The effects of various inhibitors, reducing agents and
detergent on AprX-SK37 activity were reported in Table
2. A marked inhibition by 10 mM PMSF suggested that
this enzyme is a serine protease. However, no inhibition
by other serine protease inhibitors, i.e. TLCK, TPCK,
leupeptin, and SBTI could be observed. A strong

enzyme activity could be activated by calcium. In the
standard reaction condition (5 mM CaCl2) the enzyme
was activated after incubation for 30 min and the optimal
activity was retained for up to 2 h (Figure 6a, diamond).
When the concentration of CaCl 2 was increased to 15
mM (triangle), the highest enzyme activation could be
observed from 0.5-2 h. When the enzyme was incubated
longer than 2 h in both 5 and 15 mM CaCl2, the activity
declined. Moreover, when 1 M NaCl was added in the

presence of either 5 mM (square) or 15 mM (cross)
CaCl2, the stability of the enzyme was increased up to 4
h. (Figure 6a). The same phenomenon but at a higher
rate of thermal inactivation was observed at 55°C (Figure
6b). The enzyme activity in the presence of only CaCl2
(either 5 mM or 15 mM) decreased rapidly after the first
1 h of incubation and became almost completely inactivated after 2 h (Figure 6b, diamond and triangle). In contrast, addition of 1 M NaCl could significantly lower the
rate of thermal inactivation as compared to those without
NaCl. The residual activity of the reaction containing 1
M NaCl + 5 mM or 15 mM CaCl 2 at 2 h was approximately 45% and 60%, of their original activity, respectively (Figure 6b, cross and square). These observations
suggested that NaCl played an important role in exerting
enzyme thermal stability while CaCl2 was only responsible for activating enzyme activity.

Effect of oxidizing agent

Stability against oxidizing agents is one of the most
attractive properties of bacterial proteases. Therefore,
we used H2O2 as the representative oxidizing agent to
test AprX-SK37 oxidant stability. As shown in Figure 7,
the enzyme was fully active in the presence of as much
as 5% H 2 O 2 . However, the enzyme activity gradually
decreased when it was pre-incubated for 30 min with
increasing concentration of H2O2. No activity was found
in a reaction pre-incubated with 10% H2 O 2 (data not
shown)

Discussion
This research reports the cloning, expression, biochemical characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of a
novel intracellular bacterial AprX serine protease. A previous report [29] of this enzyme from B. subtilis, focusing on bioinformatic analysis and regulation of gene
expression, indicated that this enzyme is an intracellular
serine protease, which is expressed in the stationary
phase and not essential for either growth or sporulation.
The AprX-SK37 enzyme in this study was derived from
a moderately halophilic bacterium, Virgibacillus sp.
SK37, which was isolated from Thai fish sauce that was
saturated with 26-28% of NaCl. This bacterium produced numerous NaCl-activated subtilisin-like proteinases, three of them having been partially purified and
characterized as extracellular halotolerant bacillopeptidase F-like proteinases [30]. Their activities did not
depend on calcium, showed maximum activity at pH 8,
55-60°C, 25-30% NaCl and 70-100 mMol l-1 CaCl2, and
stability at 0-30% NaCl and <20 mMol l-1 CaCl 2 [30].

unexpected as it has been shown that the cell membrane
of halophilic bacteria is incapable to completely prevent
an increased flux of sodium into the cells [31]. Intracellular Na+ concentrations of moderately halophilic bacteria growing in media containing 2-4 M NaCl were
found between 0.13 to 3.52 M with an average of 1.37
M [32]. Our enzyme can be activated and stabilized by
1 M NaCl (5.8% w/v) and tolerate up to 3 M NaCl
(17.4% w/v). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report on a halotolerant intracellular serine
protease.
DNA sequence analysis of aprX-sk37 indicated that
the gene is regulated by two putative sA promoters (PL
and PS), which have been suggested to function as primary and secondary promoters of B. subtilis aprX,
respectively [29]. The open reading frame (ORF) of Virgibacillus aprX-sk37 is slightly smaller than that of B.
subtilis aprX and lacks the alternative start condon
TTG, at position 76-78, Met/Leu26 in AprX numbering
of B. subtilis. The predicted MM and pI of AprX-SK37
are in the same range as those of AprXs from Bacillus
species (MM of 42.2-48.9 kDa and pI at 4.9-6.1). The
key difference between AprX-SK37, other AprXs, and
some other intracellular proteases is its N-terminal
domain, which showed no similarity to those of known
proteins in the database. It has been suggested that the
N-terminal domain of subtilases acts as an intramolecular chaperone or pro-peptide that mediates enzyme folding; nevertheless, the role of this domain on AprX-SK37
activity is unclear. The localization of AprX from B. subtilis in cytoplasm has been previously reported [33]. The
recombinant AprX-SK37 in this study is found in cytoplasm; however, the precise localization of the wild-type
enzyme is unknown. The enzyme appeared to be active
without cleavage of any pro-peptide. Its putative function as a chaperone for correct enzyme folding or as a
regulatory domain remains to be explored.
The benefit of isolating a novel enzyme from a DNA
expression library instead of PCR-cloning using degenerated primers is that the gene encoding active enzyme can
be readily obtained. This advantage is very important especially for Bacillus subtilases, which often form inactive,
insoluble aggregates when produced in E. coli expression
systems [34-36]. The recombinant AprX-SK37 appeared to
be located as active soluble protein in the cytosolic compartment; none were found as inactive, insoluble inclusion
bodies or secreted into the periplasm or culture media.
The fact that the enzyme was first identified from E. coli
colonies that showed halo zone during genomic DNA
library screening could be the result of membrane leakage
after prolonged growth for more than 24 h. Remarkably,
despite a thorough screening of the library that covered
approx. 70 depth of the library, no other protease genes
could be isolated. This could be because other enzymes

Phrommao et al. BMC Biotechnology 2011, 11:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/65

formed inactive aggregates, are unstable in E. coli, or the
enzyme activity may require higher sodium or calcium,
which was not included in the screening condition. Moreover, it could be because the active enzymes might need
specific post-translational modification, which was lacking
in the E. coli expression system and that the substrate in
our screening (milk protein) was not an appropriate substrate for certain enzymes. Further modification of screening conditions may lead to the identification of additional
active enzymes. pET vector was used to express the recombinant aprX-sk37 gene in this study. This system has been
shown to be efficient for the expression of various Bacillus
hydrolytic enzymes [37,38]. The canonical ribosomal binding site in this vector is identical to that of Virgibacillus
aprX-sk37. The high level of expression could be because
of synonymous codon usage, which leads to a fast translation rate in the E. coli expression system [39].
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AprX-SK37
belongs to the superfamily of subtilases or subtilisin-like
proteases. This result is consistent with the family analysis of B. subtilis AprX [29]. Moreover, our analysis indicated that the AprXs are clustered in a distinct group,
of which AprX-SK37 is relatively different from. This
could be because AprX-SK37 possesses unique characteristics of oxidant stability and moderate salt-activation,
which are not found in other AprXs. However, according to our phylogenetic tree, AprX-SK37 was not categorized into the OSPs group. Notably, phylogenetic
analysis of OSPs reports little evolutionary relationship
among this group of enzymes. Our phylogenetic analysis
indicated that most OSPs do not belong to any of the
subtilisin families previously described in bacteria or
fungi, but appear to belong to a different cluster (designated OSP in Figure 3). This finding is similar to the
phylogenetic analysis of a subtilisin-like protease gene
family in the grass endophytic fungus Epichloë festucae
[40]. Hence, OSPs should not be classified as the subfamily of subtilisins as previously suggested [11,12]. Phylogenetic analysis of various OSPs producers suggested
that the sources of OSPs encompass bacilli from diverse
taxon, which could be the result of different mechanisms of oxidant stabilization. Taken together the result
of phylogenetic analysis as discussed above, we would
like to propose a new family of subtilases superfamily,
namely alkaline serine protease X (AprX) or subitlase
S8G, according to the MEROPS database derived from
subtilases classification by Siezen and Leunissen [4]. In
addition, we believe that the classification of OSPs has
to be re-defined.
Biochemical characterization revealed that recombinant AprX-SK37 is a Ca2+ - dependent alkaline serine
protease and moderate thermophile with optimal pH
and temperature at 9.5 and 55°C, respectively. The
enzyme requires calcium to function with maximum

Page 11 of 15

activity at 15 mM CaCl2. A Calcium-dependent characteristic is well known for members of the subtilases
superfamily, of which conserved calcium binding sites
are essential for enzyme stability and/or activity [4]. In
nature, calcium may play a physiological role in aprXsk37 gene regulation as it has been shown that a massive
accumulation of calcium during sporulation is found in
most bacilli in order to respond to adverse environmental changes [41]. In B. subtilis, AprX is expressed in the
late stationary phase under the control of various transition state regulatory genes [29]. The high sensitivity of
AprX-SK37 to a reducing agent suggested that disulfide
bonds are essential for structural stability. The primary
amino acid sequence revealed that AprX-SK37 contains
8 cysteines (Cys). This richness in Cys is unique for
enzymes in the AprX family since Cys is usually absent
from subtilases in Gram-positive bacteria [4,29].
In general, subtilases are inactivated by hydrogen peroxide due to the oxidation of methionine (Met), located
next to the catalytic serine (Met 222 in subtilisin BPN
numbering), thus preventing the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate during the transition state of their
hydrolytic reaction [42,43]. AprX-SK37 possesses Met368
next to catalytic Ser367, similar to other subtiliases (Figure 2) and other OSPs [8,11,12,14-16]. The actual
mechanism of oxidant stability is still unclear. In the
study of KP-43, an OSP enzyme, oxidation of Met was
not a fatal modification, but rather altered its substrate
specificity [44]. KP-43’s crystal structure suggested that
the rate of Met-oxidation in KP-43 was lower than
those of other subtilases, probably due to the longer distance between the Met residue in the catalytic vicinity
and the oxyanion hole [17]. Hence, the oxidant-stable
ability is strongly dependent on enzyme conformation
and structural integrity, which is intrinsic to each
enzyme. The oxidant stability as well as halotolerant and
moderately thermophilic properties of AprX-SK37
should make this novel enzyme attractive for biotechnological applications in the future.

Conclusions
A novel oxidant stable, halotolerant and moderately
thermophilic alkaline serine protease, named AprXSK37, has been identified and characterized. Its unique
property is attractive for various biotechnological
applications.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/65

(MerkKGoA, Darmstadt, Germany). Azocasein and subtilisin A (subtilisin Carlsberg) were purchased from
Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). All other
reagents for molecular and biochemical analysis were of
molecular and analytical grade, respectively.
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions

Virgibacillus sp. SK37 (GenBank/NCBI no. DQ910840)
was cultured at 35°C in a modified halophilic medium
(1% yeast extract, 0.3% trisodium citrate, 0.2% potassium
chloride, 2.5% magnesium sulfate, and 5% NaCl). The
pH was adjusted to 7.0 by NaOH. Escherichia coli strain
DH5a and DH10B (Mega DH10B™ T1Relectrocomp™,
Invitrogen, CA) were used as host strains for cloning
and genomic DNA expression, respectively. E. coli BL21
(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used for enzyme
expression. They were grown aerobically at 37°C in
Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Plasmid vector pUC19
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and pET21d+
(Novagen, Madison, WI) were used for genomic library
construction and over-expression, respectively.
General molecular biology techniques

Cloning, DNA manipulation, and agarose gel electrophoresis were done as previously described [45]. Genomic DNA was isolated from Virgibacillus sp. SK37 using
a Wizard® genomic extraction kit (Promega, Madison,
WI). Plasmid was isolated with Qiagen plasmid preparation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). PCR products were
separated by gel electrophoresis, and bands of the
expected size were isolated from the gel using Qiagen
QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Automated DNA sequencing was carried out by Macrogen (Seoul, Korea), using the primer-walking technique
with pUC/M13 forward/reverse primers for pUC19, and
T7/SP6 promoter primers for pET21d+ as initial primers, respectively. Enzymes and reagents were used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions unless
otherwise stated.
Genomic DNA library construction

The genomic DNA of Virgibacillus sp. SK37 was partially digested by incubating with 10 units of BfuCI per
150 μg of genomic DNA at 37°C for 20 min. Fragments
ranging in size from 3 to 10 kilobase pairs (kb) were isolated from the agarose gel. The plasmid pUC19 was
digested with BamHI and 5’-phosphate groups were
removed with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP, New
England Biolabs) prior to gel purification using Qiagen
QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
The genomic BfuCI fragments were ligated with dephosphorylated linearized pUC19 by T4 DNA ligase at a
ratio of 3:1. This ligation mixture was precipitated by
isopropanol and re-dissolved in 30 μl nuclease-free

water prior to transform into competent E. coli DH10B
by electroporation (2 mm cuvette, 2500 V, Electroporator 2510, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). The
transformants were then spread on LBAmp plates containing 2% (w/v) glucose (LBAmp+Glu). The plates were
incubated for approx. 14 h at 37°C. Colonies growing on
the LBAmp+Glu plates were scraped from the agar surface
and transferred into LB broth containing 15% glycerol
and kept at -70°C until use. A small aliquot of the transformants were spread onto LBAmp plates supplemented
with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
and 0.2% (w/v) bromo-chloro-indolyl-galactopyranoside
(X-gal) (LBAmp+IPTG+X-gal) for enumeration and determination of percentage of blue white colonies, representing
DNA library size and % background.
Screening of protease-producing clones

The clones from genomic DNA library were spread onto
LB Amp plates supplemented with 3% (w/v) skim milk
powder. The clones were grown at 37°C for 18 h. Positive colonies showing protease activity as indicated by
the formation of transparent halo zones around the
colonies were selected as positive clones after continual
incubation of the plates at 30°C for additional 7 h.
DNA sequence analysis

Plasmid from each protease-positive clone was isolated
by Qiagen plasmid preparation kit. Both strands of
DNA insert were sequenced by automated DNA
sequencing (Macrogen, Korea). The full length DNA
insert of each positive-clone, open reading frames
(ORFs), and homology of putative coding sequences
were analyzed using tools provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Bacterial promoter and transcription
termination site of protease coding gene were predicted
by Softberry Bioinformatics tools (http://linux1.softberry.
com/berry.phtml). Isoelectric point (pI) and molecular
mass of deduced amino acid sequence were calculated
using software from ExPASy Proteomics server (http://
ca.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html).
Cloning, over-expression, and purification of the
recombinant AprX-SK37

Putative protease gene was amplified by PCR using forward (5’-CTG TGC TCT AGA GCA AAG TAA AAA
CAA CTA TTC TAT AAG GAG GAA G-3’) and
reverse (5’-CTG TGC CTC GAG ATT CAC TTT CTG
CAC CTG CTG TAC G-3’) primers (the XbaI and XhoI
sites are underlined). Thirty-five cycles of PCR were performed in a thermal cycler (MJ Research PCT-200 Thermal Cycler DNA Engine, GMI Inc, Ramsey, MI) using
Pfu DNA polymerase. The amplified 1356 bp DNA product flanked by XbaI and XhoI restriction sites was

Phrommao et al. BMC Biotechnology 2011, 11:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/65

cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of
pET21d (+) vector for the expression of C-terminally
6xHis tagged enzyme. The integrity of the construct,
designated pET-AprX-SK37, was confirmed by agarose
gel electrophoresis followed by automated double-strand
DNA sequencing. To express the enzyme, the pETAprX-SK37 vector was transformed into E. coli BL21
(DE3). A single colony of E. coli BL21 harboring pETAprX-SK37 (BL21/pET-AprX-SK37) was grown at 37°C
in LBAmp until the OD600 reached 0.6-0.7, then 0.1 mM
IPTG was added to induce the gene expression. After
further incubation at 16°C for 18 h, the cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (30 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml
and incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysozyme-treated cells
were broken by sonication on ice for 2 min with a 10 s
bursts at 300 W and a 10 s cooling period between each
burst. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at
10,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The recombinant 6xHistagged enzyme in the cleared lysate was purified using
nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal affinity chromatography (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to
the manufacturer’s protocol with some modifications.
After the cleared lysate was incubated with Ni-NTA at
4°C for 4 h with rotary shaking, the slurry was loaded
into a column and washed with 10 bed volumes of lysis
buffer followed by 10 bed volumes of wash buffers (30
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 M NaCl) containing 50 and
80 mM imidazole, respectively. The recombinant
enzyme was recovered with an elution buffer containing
250 mM imidazole. Protein concentration and purity of
the purified protein were analyzed by Bradford method
using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard [46],
and SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant blue,
respectively.
Amino acid sequence alignment and construction of the
phylogenetic tree

Amino acid sequences of proteases similar to the
enzyme in this study were retrieved by BLAST search
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Multiple amino
acid sequence alignment was done by ClustalX program
[47] using sequences of AprX-related enzymes retrieved
from SwissProt database (http://www.isb-sib.ch/services/
databases). Sequence identity was calculated by ClustalW2. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from
sequences of enzymes representing each member of the
subtilase superfamily [4] and oxidant stable proteases
(OSPs), obtained from extensive search of the Pubmed
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and Swiss-Prot
(http://www.isb-sib.ch/services/databases) databases. The
phylogenetic tree was constructed based on amino acid
similarity within catalytic domains as described by Saeki

et al [12], using MEGA version 4 software [48] and was
inferred by the bootstrapping neighbor-joining method
[49], of which sites involving gaps were excluded from
the analysis.
Genbank accession number

The accession number of our recently isolated gene
from the Virgibacillus sp. SK37 is HM587897 and the
protein identification number is ADM26217
Determination of protease activity

Protease activity was determined using azocasein as a
substrate. The standard assay reaction in 500 μl contained 5 mg/ml azocasein, 100 mM Tris-glycine buffer,
pH 9.5, 5 mM CaCl2, and 20 μg/ml of purified recombinant protease. The mixture was incubated at 55°C for
30 min with vigorous shaking. The reaction was stopped
by adding 150 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and
kept on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at
12,500 × g for 30 min. Then, the supernatant (250 μl)
was mixed with equal volume of 2.5 M NaOH and the
absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Specific activity
(U/mg) was defined as an increase of 0.01 OD405 units
per minute per milligram of enzyme. Protease activity
was also analyzed by native-PAGE casein-zymography.
Purified protease in a loading buffer without SDS and
b-mercaptoethanol was electrophoresed through a 12%
polyacrylamide gel under native condition. Subsequently, the gel was submerged in 2% (w/v) casein solution for 30 min at 4°C with gentle shaking. The gel was
then transferred into a reaction buffer containing 50
mM Tris-glycine, pH 9.5, 250 mM NaCl, and 5 mM
CaCl 2 and further incubated at 55°C for 90 min, followed by staining with Coomassie blue. The protease
activity was determined as a clear band against a blue
background.
Effects of pH and temperature on protease activity

The effect of pH on proteolytic activity was examined in
the presence of various 100 mM buffers, namely sodium
acetate (pH 5.0-6.0), Tris-Maleate (pH 6.0-7.5), Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5-9.0), Tris-glycine (pH 8.5-9.5), and glycine (pH
9.0-11.0), at 55°C and 5 mM CaCl2. To study the effect
of temperature, the standard assay was applied using
Tris-glycine buffer, pH 9.5 at 25-90°C. Thermostability
of the protease was analyzed by incubating the enzyme
at various temperatures (25-90°C) for 120 min and residual activity was measured at the standard assay condition (55°C, pH 9.5 and 5 mM CaCl2) and calculated as a
percentage of activity of the enzyme prior to incubation.
Effects of NaCl and CaCl2 on protease activity

Protease activity at various concentrations of either

measured at 55°C and pH 9.5. Subtilisin A was used as a
representative of the subtilisin S8A family, and its catalytic activity was determined at its optimum condition
at 60°C, in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 in appropriate
concentrations of NaCl and CaCl2. The CaCl2 concentration was fixed at 5 mM in all NaCl assays. Maximum
activity of each protease was defined as 100%. In enzyme
stability studies, the enzymes were pre-incubated in the
presence of various concentrations of either NaCl (0 to
4 M) or CaCl 2 (0 to 100 mM) at 25°C for 24 h at pH
9.5 or 8.0 for the purified recombinant AprX-SK37 and
subtilisin A, respectively. Residual activities were measured at 55 and 60°C for AprX-SK37 and subtilisin A,
respectively, and expressed as relative activity compared
to the reaction containing appropriate concentrations of
NaCl or CaCl2 without pre-incubation.
Effects of NaCl and CaCl2 on thermostability

The effects of NaCl and CaCl2 on the thermostability of
the recombinant AprX-SK37 was determined by monitoring enzyme activity at moderate (40°C) and high (55°
C) inactivation temperatures according to the results
from the thermal stability assays. The enzyme was prepared in 100 mM Tris-glycine pH 9.5 containing; (I) 5
mM CaCl 2 : (II) 5 mM CaCl 2 and 1 M NaCl: (III) 15
mM CaCl2: (IV) 15 mM CaCl2 and 1 M NaCl. The reactions were pre-incubated at either 40 or 55°C for up to
4 h and aliquots were withdrawn at various time intervals to measure residual activities at the standard assay
condition.
Effects of protease inhibitors and denaturants

The effects of various protease inhibitors and protein
denaturants on protease activity were determined using
various substances, namely leupeptin, soy-bean trypsin
inhibitor (SBTI), L-1-chloro-3-[-4-tosylamido]-7-amino2-heptanone (TLCK), L-1-chloro-3-[-4-tosylamida]-4phenyl-2-butane (TPCK), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
imidazole, L-histidine, bestatin, pepstatin A, iodoacetic
acid (IAA), N-methylmaleimide (NEM), b-mercaptoethanol (BME), dithiothreitol (DTT), E64, urea, and
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Various concentrations of
substances used in this study were listed in Table 2. The
enzyme was mixed with each substance at room temperature for 30 min before azocasein was added to initiate catalytic reaction under the standard assay
condition. Relative activity was calculated using the
activity of the enzyme in the absence of these substances
as 100%.
Stability towards oxidizing agent

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used as a representative
of the oxidizing agent. Protease activity was measured in

Page 14 of 15

the presence of H2O2 at concentrations ranging from 0
to 5% (w/v). Enzyme activity was performed before and
after pre-incubation the reaction in the absence of substrate for 30 min at 25°C. The reaction in the absence
of H2O2 and without pre-incubation was taken as 100%.
