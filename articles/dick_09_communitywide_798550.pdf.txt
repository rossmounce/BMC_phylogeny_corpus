Abstract
Background: Analyses of DNA sequences from cultivated microorganisms have revealed
genome-wide, taxa-specific nucleotide compositional characteristics, referred to as genome
signatures. These signatures have far-reaching implications for understanding genome evolution and
potential application in classification of metagenomic sequence fragments. However, little is known
regarding the distribution of genome signatures in natural microbial communities or the extent to
which environmental factors shape them.
Results: We analyzed metagenomic sequence data from two acidophilic biofilm communities,
including composite genomes reconstructed for nine archaea, three bacteria, and numerous
associated viruses, as well as thousands of unassigned fragments from strain variants and lowabundance organisms. Genome signatures, in the form of tetranucleotide frequencies analyzed by
emergent self-organizing maps, segregated sequences from all known populations sharing < 50 to
60% average amino acid identity and revealed previously unknown genomic clusters corresponding
to low-abundance organisms and a putative plasmid. Signatures were pervasive genome-wide.
Clusters were resolved because intra-genome differences resulting from translational selection or
protein adaptation to the intracellular (pH ~5) versus extracellular (pH ~1) environment were
small relative to inter-genome differences. We found that these genome signatures stem from
multiple influences but are primarily manifested through codon composition, which we propose is
the result of genome-specific mutational biases.
Conclusions: An important conclusion is that shared environmental pressures and interactions
among coevolving organisms do not obscure genome signatures in acid mine drainage communities.
Thus, genome signatures can be used to assign sequence fragments to populations, an essential
prerequisite if metagenomics is to provide ecological and biochemical insights into the functioning
of microbial communities.

Background

The age of genomics has opened up new perspectives on the
natural microbial world, offering insights into organisms that
drive geochemical cycles and are critical to human and environmental health. The prevalence of horizontal gene transfer,
recombination, and population-level genomic diversity
underscores the dynamic nature of bacterial and archaeal
genomes and demands reconsideration of fundamental
issues such as microbial taxonomy [1,2] and the concept of
microbial species [3,4]. Application of genomics to uncultivated assemblages of microorganisms in natural environments ('metagenomics' or 'community genomics') has
provided a new window into in situ microbial diversity and
function [5-7]. To date, community genomics has revealed the
form and extent of recombination and heterogeneity in gene
content [8-11], elucidated virus-host interactions [12], redefined the extent of genetic and biochemical diversity in the
oceans [13-15], uncovered new metabolic capabilities [16-19]
and taxonomic groups [20], and shown how functions are distributed across environmental gradients [21].
An important approach to study evolutionary and ecological
processes, pioneered by Karlin and others [22], is the analysis
of nucleotide compositional characteristics of genomes. The
simplest and most widely used measure of nucleotide composition, the abundance of guanine plus cytosine (%GC), is
shaped by multiple factors encompassing both neutral and
selective processes. Neutral factors include intrinsic properties of the replication, repair, and recombination machinery
that result in mutational biases [23,24]. Selective processes
encompass both internal (for example, translation machinery) and external influences such as physical (temperature,
pressure), chemical (salinity, pH) and ecological factors
(competition for metabolic resources [25] and niche complexity [26]). Although the relative importance of these factors remains uncertain [27], it is clear that %GC varies widely
between species but is relatively constant within species.
Thus, %GC has been used to trace origins of DNA fragments
within genomes [28] and to assign fragmentary metagenomic
sequences to candidate organisms [16]. Such inferences must
be made with caution: %GC simplifies nucleotide composition down to a single parameter with known limitations for
investigating genome dynamics [29].
Oligonucleotide frequencies capture species-specific characteristics of nucleotide composition more effectively than %GC
[30]. Analyses of genome sequences from cultivated organisms have shown that the frequency at which oligonucleotides
occur is unique between species while being conserved
genome-wide within species [22,30-34]. Taken together, the
frequency of all oligonucleotides of a given length defines the
'genome signature' (for example, the frequency of all possible
256 tetranucleotides). Sequence signatures are evident in oligonucleotides ranging from di- (two-mers) to octanucleotides
(eight-mers). While the specificity of genome signatures
increases with oligonucleotide length [35], the number of

Volume 10, Issue 8, Article R85

Dick et al. R85.2

possible oligomers increases exponentially with oligomer
length, so signatures based on longer oligomers require calculations over larger genomic regions to achieve sufficient sampling. Genome signatures have been used to detect
horizontally transferred DNA [36-39], reconstruct phylogenetic relationships [22,32,40] and infer lifestyles of bacteriophage [41,42].
Genome signatures also offer a compelling means of assigning metagenomic sequence fragments to microbial taxa, a
procedure termed 'binning' [43]. This is a prerequisite for
realizing some of the most valuable opportunities random
shotgun metagenomics offers, including assignment of ecological and biogeochemical functions to particular community members and assessment of population-level genomic
diversity and community structure. However, binning is a
formidable challenge because: the inherent diversity of
microbial communities typically limits genomic assembly,
resulting in highly fragmentary data [13]; there are few universally conserved phylogenetically informative markers,
leaving the vast majority of metagenomic sequence fragments
'anonymous' with regard to their organism of origin; and current sequence databases grossly under-represent the microbial diversity in the natural world, limiting the utility of
fragment recruitment or BLAST-based methods [13,44,45].
Consequently, it is important to develop methods that classify
all genome sequence fragments independently of reference
databases.
Genome signatures are a promising approach for sequence
classification. However, it is important to understand the
source of the signal and how environmental effects and evolutionary distance will compromise it. To date, sequence signatures have been explored using genomes from cultivated
microbes [22,30-34], and prospects for binning have been
evaluated based largely on simulated datasets consisting of
mixtures of isolate genomes [44,46-48]. Although these studies are indispensable in that they allow theoretical evaluation
of binning capability, they do not represent the diversity
(community-wide and within population) and dynamics (for
example, horizontal gene transfer, recombination, viruses) of
real microbial communities. Further, they employ genomes
derived from disparate environments and so do not address
the extent to which environmental factors shape genome signatures. It has been reported that environment shapes nucleotide composition [26,49-51]. If so, then genome signatures
may not discriminate coexisting, coevolving organisms, especially where environmental pressures are extreme. On the
other hand, binning results of real microbial communities
[46,48,52] are inherently difficult to evaluate because the
true identity of most sequence fragments is unknown. Thus,
there remain fundamental questions regarding the forces and
processes that give rise to and maintain genome signatures,
and the extent to which these signatures are obscured by
shared environmental pressures and community interactions
such as horizontal gene transfer and broad host range viruses.

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of genome signatures in sequences derived from natural biofilms inhabiting a
subsurface chemolithoautotrophic acid mine drainage
(AMD) ecosystem in the Richmond Mine at Iron Mountain,
CA [53]. The biofilms are dominated by just a handful of
organisms that are sustained primarily by the oxidation of
Fe(II) derived from pyrite (FeS2) dissolution [54]. Due to this
relatively low diversity, modest levels of shotgun sequencing
(approximately 100 Mb per sample) have yielded deep
genomic sampling (10 to 20× sequence coverage) of the dominant populations, enabling reconstruction of 12 near-complete genomes from three samples [16,55,56] (BJ Baker et al.,
submitted). These assembled composite genomes provide the
organism affiliation of sequences with which binning accuracy can be evaluated. Therefore, the dataset allows assessment of binning performance while capturing sequence
heterogeneity that is an intrinsic feature of natural microbial
populations. We find that AMD biofilm microorganisms are
indeed distinguished by population-specific genome signatures and show that sequence signatures can be used to identify and cluster sequences from low-abundance community
members de novo, without reference genomes or reliance on
databases. Our results have implications for metagenomic
binning and provide new insights into the sources of genome
signatures that distinguish coexisting populations.

Results
Description of samples, community genomic
sequencing and assembly
An overview of our methodology is shown in Figure 1. Community genomic sequence was obtained from two previously
described biofilm samples from the UBA location of the Richmond Mine at Iron Mountain: a pink subaerial biofilm collected in June 2005 ('UBA') [55] and a thicker floating biofilm
collected in November 2005 ('UBA BS') [12]. These two biofilms contained overlapping subsets of organisms in different
proportions. The UBA biofilm was dominated by bacterial
Leptospirillum spp. group II and group III (Nitrospirae) populations, for which near-complete genomes have been reconstructed [55,56]. The most abundant microorganisms
represented in the UBA BS genomic data were from archaeal
populations, including an uncultivated representative of a
novel euryarchaeal lineage, ARMAN-2 [20], and A-plasma,
E-plasma, and I-plasma, members of the order Thermoplasmatales. To facilitate reconstruction of genomes from these
and other lower-abundance organisms, a combined assembly
included unassigned sequences from UBA and all sequences
from UBA BS. Random shotgun sequences derived from both
ends of approximately 3-kb DNA fragments, and each fragment was likely sampled from a different individual cell with
a potentially distinct genome sequence. Therefore, genome
reconstructions represent composite sequences. However,
single nucleotide polymorphism density was typically very
low (< 0.3%). For a small subset of the many cases where

Volume 10, Issue 8, Article R85

Dick et al. R85.3

there were subpopulations with different gene content, alternative genome paths were also reconstructed [9,55].
From the combined dataset, near-complete genomes were
reconstructed for ARMAN-2, I-plasma, E-plasma, G-plasma,
and A-plasma (Table 1). In addition to sequences that were
assigned to these deeply sampled genomes, 14,700 sequences
remained unassigned to any organism, including 7,030 contigs longer than 1.4 kb and 3,631 contigs longer than 2.0 kb. A
number of shallowly sampled 16S rRNA gene-containing
sequence fragments were recovered, indicating substantial
sampling of diverse lower-abundance community members
(Figure 2).

Clustering sequences by tetranucleotide frequency and
emergent self-organizing map
We constructed a dataset that contained all sequences from
the combined assembly (assigned and unassigned), previously assembled composite genome sequences, and the
genome sequence from Ferroplasma acidarmanus fer1,
which was cultivated from AMD solutions in the Richmond
Mine [8,57] (Figure 1, Table 1). To analyze the distribution of
genome signatures among and between populations, all contigs and assembled genomes were fragmented into 5-kb
pieces, then pooled and clustered by self-organizing map
(SOM) [58] based on tetranucleotide frequency distributions
(Figure 1; see Materials and methods for details). The SOM is
an unsupervised neural network algorithm that clusters multidimensional data and represents it on a two-dimensional
map. SOMs of tetranucleotide frequencies have been used
previously to successfully bin sequence fragments from isolate genomes [33,59] and some environmental samples
[46,48,52]. We utilized an implementation of the SOM, emergent SOM (ESOM), which is distinguished by its use of large
borderless maps (for example, thousands of neurons) and visualization of underlying distance structure with background
topography [60]. This visualization, where map 'elevation'
represents the distance in tetranucleotide frequency between
data points, is referred to as the U-Matrix [60]. Thus,
genomic clusters were visualized not only by the cohesive
clustering of fragments from each genome, but also by distance structure whereby barriers between clusters represent
the large differences in genome signatures between genomes
relative to those within genomes (Figure 3). This visualization
of genomic clustering was used to evaluate the accuracy of the
binning based on assembled genomes and to identify novel
regions of sequence signature space.
Inspection of the clustering results in light of assembly information provided a broad measure of the ability of tetranucleotide frequency-based ESOM (tetra-ESOM) to resolve
sequences from coexisting populations of the community. To
quantify the degree of segregation of fragments from
genomes at various evolutionary distances, we adapted a
method using fixed point kernel densities (Figure 4; Additional data file 1). We found that sequence fragments from

closely related strains or species could not be distinguished.
For example, two strains of F. acidarmanus sharing 97%
average nucleotide identity (fer1 and fer1(env) [8]) mapped
directly on top of each other, as did two types of Leptospirillum group II, which share 95% average nucleotide identity
[55] (only one type of Leptospirillum group II is shown in Figure 3 for this reason; Figures 3 and 4). Sequences from Ferroplasma types I and II, which share 83% average nucleotide
identity and are known to participate in homologous recombination [10], were segregated to some extent by tetra-ESOM,
but type II was split and there was no well-defined boundary
between the two types. Good separation of Leptospirillum
groups II and III was achieved, except for certain genomic
regions containing mobile elements, as described further
below. Among members of the Thermoplasmatales, populations were distinguished by genome signatures but borders
were variably well-defined (Figure 3). In particular, G- and Eplasma were not well resolved. I-plasma, which is quite divergent from the other Thermoplasmatales (Figure 2), was the
only member of the Thermoplasmatales for which a distancebased border was clearly delineated. Although genomes with
similar %GC were generally more difficult to separate, several
genomes with near-identical %GC were easily separated (for
example, G-plasma versus Ferroplasma) (Figures 3 and 4).
To quantitatively evaluate binning performance on sequence
fragments of different lengths, tetra-SOMs were run on the
same dataset (including unassigned sequences and reconstructed composite genomes) but with sequences broken into
various fragment sizes. Binning accuracy was calculated for a
subset of genomes for which deeply sampled and manually
curated assemblies are available (Additional data file 2). For

sequence fragments 5 kb or larger, sensitivity (percentage of
fragments from each genome correctly identified) and precision (percentage of fragments in each bin belonging to the
correct genome) rates of > 90% were achieved (Additional
data file 2). Sensitivity was somewhat lower for Leptospirillum groups II and III due to poor resolution of certain
genomic regions between these two populations. When Leptospirillum was considered as a single group, binning sensitivity was comparable to the other reference genomes.
Sensitivity decreased notably only when shorter (< 5 kb)
sequence fragments were analyzed, but precision remained
remarkably high even for 1,400-bp fragments (Additional
data file 2). Lower sensitivity is due to sequence fragments
that fall between clusters, beyond the borders of any bin.
Notably, the tetra-ESOM correctly assigned sequence fragments as short as 500 bp, provided that some larger fragments were included in the analysis (Additional data file 2b).
To address the question of how genome completeness influences performance, genomes randomly subsampled at different levels were analyzed by tetra-ESOM. Binning accuracy
was maintained even at 20% genome sequence; only at 10%
subsampling was a notable decline observed, and even then
only for certain genomes (Additional data file 3).
Incorrectly assigned fragments often contained mobile elements or other features expected to have atypical nucleotide
composition. The majority (54 of 94) of incorrectly binned
fragments from all five reference genomes show evidence of
transposons, prophage, or integrated plasmids. Other frequently unresolved genomic regions contain CRISPR elements [61] and rRNA genes, both of which have constrained
sequences and thus atypical tetranucleotide patterns [62].

16S rRNA gene was obtained are not shown, including ARMAN-5, a gammaproteobacterium, additional Actinobacteria, and Sulfobacillus-like sequences.

The region of the ESOM map containing a mixture of Leptospirillum groups II and III (Figure 3) was dominated by
fragments (80 of 92) encoding mobile elements that may be
exchangeable between the two Leptospirillum groups (for
example, integrated plasmid-like sequence [56]) and strain/
group-unique regions believed to have been recently acquired
(for example, prophage).
Interestingly, many strain-unique regions were correctly
binned with their host genomes. There are 197 strain-unique
genes between the fer1 and fer1(env) genomes, the majority of
which occur in distinct genomic blocks of up to 24 genes with
atypical %GC content inferred to be the result of prophage
insertion [8]. Ninety-six percent (22 of 23) of sequence fragments containing these genomic islands were accurately
assigned as Ferroplasma in our binning analysis.

Genome signatures of low-abundance community
members and viruses
The tetra-ESOM revealed large regions of the map that were
devoid of sequence fragments of known organism affiliation

(Figure 3, regions 11 to 17). We used mate pair linkage with
rRNA gene-containing contigs, phylogenetic analysis, and/or
close relatedness (synteny and identity) to other community
members to identify these bins as follows: a new type of Leptospirillum most closely related to Leptospirillum ferrodiazotrophum (group III); several members of the
Thermoplasmatales for which genomic sequence had not
been previously obtained (C-plasma, D-plasma, and a divergent type of A-plasma); several Actinobacteria; and multiple
more shallowly sampled populations, including a gammaproteobacterium and several Sulfobacillus-like organisms (Figures 2 and 3). A small, prominent region of the map adjacent
to the Leptospirillum groups contained approximately 250 kb
of composite sequence (Figure 3, region 11) inferred to be a
Leptospirillum plasmid [56]. Tetranucleotide usage patterns
of this putative plasmid are quite distinct from those of either
Leptospirillum groups (Additional data file 4).
We calculated tetranucleotide frequencies for viral genomes
that were recently reconstructed from the same genomic
datasets and linked to their hosts via CRISPR viral resistance

system sequences (Additional data file 4) [12]. Three of the
viruses closely resemble their hosts' tetranucleotide usage
(AMDV1, Leptospirillum groups II and III; AMDV4, Eplasma; AMDV3, A-/E-/G-plasma), a trend that has been
observed previously for cultivated viruses and hosts [41,63].
Interestingly, two viruses have very different tetranucleotide
frequency patterns (AMDV2, E-plasma; AMDV5, I-plasma;
Additional data file 4).

Characteristics of genome signatures
As expected, the frequency at which each tetranucleotide
occurs is related to overall %GC: GC-rich tetranucleotides are
abundant in high-GC genomes and uncommon in low-GC
genomes. However, patterns of tetranucleotide usage extend
beyond trends in %GC (Additional data file 4) and genomes
with near-identical %GC were effectively segregated by tetraSOM. Because tetranucleotide frequencies are calculated with
a 1-bp sliding window and reverse complementary pairs of
tetranucleotides are summed together, all possible reading
frames on both strands are sampled. In addition to spanning

To assess the contributions of these potential sources of
genome signature signal, we compared SOMs based on amino
acid composition, codon composition, and tetranucleotide
frequency. Amino acid composition alone distinguished certain genomes (Additional data file 5). This was especially true
for phylogenetically distant organisms (for example, archaea
versus bacteria), but some separation was also apparent
among groups within some lineages such as Ferroplasma
versus other Thermoplasmatales. SOMs based on codon composition were notably more accurate than amino acid composition and comparable to those based on tetranucleotide
frequency (Additional data file 5).

sample a complete codon or span two partial codons. (b) Because reverse
complementary pairs are summed together, both strands are sampled.
Therefore, depending on the coding strand and reading frame, there are
12 potential codons sampled by each tetranucleotide.

Additional features of the relationship between codon composition and tetranucleotide frequency were revealed by comparing the observed frequency of tetranucleotides to the
frequency predicted from genome-wide codon usage (see
Materials and methods). Observed and predicted tetranucleotide frequency correlated strongly (Figure 6), and differences in the frequencies of individual tetranucleotides
between genomes are correlated with differences in corresponding codon usage between genomes (Additional data file
6). Exceptions to this trend are primarily palindromic tetranucleotides that occur less frequently than predicted (Figure
6b). Five of the 16 possible palindromic tetranucleotides are
most strongly and consistently underrepresented: AATT,
ATAT, TATA, GATC, and GGCC. The extent to which palindromic tetranucleotides are avoided in both viral and microbial genomes varies significantly and thus could be a factor in
defining genome signatures (Additional data file 4). To test
this possibility, we visualized the SOM distance structure for
only one tetranucleotide at a time and found that certain palindromic tetranucleotides (GATC, TATA, ATAT) are particularly informative in distinguishing members of the
Thermoplasmatales that share near-identical %GC (Ferroplasma types I and II, G-plasma, E-plasma). However, SOMs
run excluding all 16 palindromic tetranucleotides distinguished populations with accuracy comparable to that
achieved using all tetranucleotides, indicating that palindrome avoidance is not a primary component of the genome
signature.

The correlation of genome signatures with codon usage raises
the question of whether they persist in intergenic regions.
Thus, we extracted intergenic regions from assembled and
annotated genomes and analyzed them with coding regions
by tetra-ESOM (intergenic regions were concatenated to tally
tetranucleotide frequencies but care was taken to avoid artifacts; see Materials and methods). Intergenic regions from
each genome formed discrete, cohesive clusters that mapped
adjacent to coding regions from the same genome but were
separated by U-Matrix boundaries (Additional data file 7).
Intergenic sequences from each genome were grouped based
on length, concatenated, and analyzed by ESOM; all size
classes of intergenic regions from the same genome clustered
together regardless of length, from the shortest (4 to 20 bp) to
longest (> 1,000 bp) (data not shown). The noncoding complement of each Thermoplasmatales genome formed a distinct cluster adjacent to noncoding regions of the other
Thermoplasmatales. The only outlier to this trend was Aplasma, which has the highest %GC among these organisms.
Based on U-Matrix background, the distance between noncoding sequences of different genomes is comparable to the
distance between noncoding and coding sequences of the
same genome. To determine if the presence of noncoding
sequence influences binning accuracy in the initial experiments, we calculated the percentage of coding sequence on
incorrectly binned fragments from the five reference genomes
(5 kb and 1 kb window sizes). For many genomes, the incorrectly binned fragments do indeed have a smaller average
percentage of coding sequence. However, this percentage var-

ied widely on incorrectly binned fragments. Only a small fraction of such fragments had a percentage of coding sequence
smaller than one standard deviation below the genome-wide
average (Additional data file 8).
For sequence signatures to differentiate populations in a
genome-wide manner, it is necessary that within-genome differences resulting from atypical regions of amino acid and/or
synonymous codon usage are smaller than between-genome
differences. This issue is especially relevant in AMD, where
proteins are under diverse constraints depending on whether
they function in the extracellular (around pH 1) or intracellular (around pH 5) environment [65]. Indeed, proteins from
the AMD populations in these two fractions have disparate
isoelectric points owing to the unique amino acid composition of acid-stable proteins [66]. We identified 106 Leptospirillum group II-UBA proteins that are consistently
enriched in the extracellular fraction according to environmental shotgun proteomics data [55,66] and compared
sequence signatures of their genes with the other 2,522 Leptospirillum group II genes. No systematic differences were
detected via tetra-ESOM, suggesting that genome signatures
persist even when gene sequences are influenced by considerable protein-coding constraints (Additional data file 9).
Selection for codons that optimize translation rate may also
influence codon usage. We analyzed genome signatures for
the 50 Leptospirillum group II proteins most abundantly
detected via environmental shotgun proteomics [55,66]. With
the exception of one subset of genes encoding mainly ribosomal proteins (which mapped into the mixed region between
Leptospirillum groups II and III), highly expressed genes
clustered with the rest of the genome (Additional data file 9).

Discussion

Through analysis of a deeply sampled and extensively curated
community genomic dataset, we have demonstrated that
genome signatures can be used to differentiate coexisting
microbial populations despite functional and environmental
constraints, processes such as lateral gene transfer, and pressures imposed by viral predation that might have diminished
them to the point that they are no longer diagnostic. The
genome-wide nature of the signatures makes them potentially useful for classification of sequence fragments. Results
from our AMD dataset show that the signal can be detected on
fragments as small as 500 bp, genome clusters can be defined
using fragments as short as 1,400 bp (Additional data file 2)
and a small fraction of the genome (Additional data file 3).
These findings suggest broad applicability of the tetra-ESOM
approach for metagenomic studies. However, in order to
understand and predict its utility for binning, it is important
to identify sources of genome signatures as well as processes
that are likely to diminish the signal.

Insights into the sources of distinctive genome
signatures
It has been suggested that environmental constraints strongly
shape nucleotide composition [26,49-51]. If this were the
case, two effects should be apparent in genome signatures of
AMD populations. First, shared pressures deriving from the
extreme AMD environment would drive genome signatures
together, potentially obscuring differences between populations. Second, since each genome encodes proteins destined
for diverse environments (that is, intracellular and extracellular), there should be prominent intra-genome variation of
genome signature and scattering of fragments from the same
genome into disparate regions of the SOM. Neither of these
expectations is met in the AMD dataset. There are vast differences in nucleotide composition between populations, with
genomic %GC ranging from 35% (ARMAN-4 and ARMAN-5)
to 69% (low-abundance Actinobacteria) and genome signatures forming discrete clusters. Amino acid compositional
constraints required for stability of proteins exposed to acidic
solutions do not result in sequence signatures that are markedly distinct from the rest of the genome. In other words,
within-population differences in genome signature are small
relative to differences between populations. Although we do
not rule out some environmental influence on genome signatures, we conclude that, in AMD, this influence is not strong
enough to obscure differences between populations. Similar
community-wide analyses need to be conducted in other systems to determine whether our findings extend to other extremophilic microbial communities.
Our results show that genome signatures are related to several traits, including %GC, amino acid composition, synonymous codon usage, and palindrome avoidance. These
characteristics are interrelated and further connected to a
host of biochemical, ecological, and evolutionary processes
(Additional data file 10). Large differences in %GC and/or
amino acid composition guarantee distinctive genome signatures but are not required to differentiate genomes. At finer
evolutionary scales, where %GC and amino acid composition
are not informative, populations can be readily distinguished
through subtle differences in tetranucleotide frequency,
which correlate with genome-specific synonymous codon
usage. Tetra-ESOM analyses based on codon usage and tetranucleotide frequency displayed similar clustering resolution,
indicating that little signal derives from longer-range characteristics such as codon pair bias. It should be noted, however,
that using tetranucleotide frequency rather than codon composition has practical advantages for binning because it is
independent of coding strand and reading frame and thus
insensitive to errors in gene-calling or frame shifts due to
poor quality sequence. These issues are particularly important for short, low-coverage sequence fragments.
Although genome signatures are largely manifested through
codon composition, the observation that population-specific
signatures also occur in non-coding regions (Additional data

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R85

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/8/R85

Genome Biology 2009,

file 7) suggests a mechanism of generation that is independent of protein coding. We hypothesize this underlying process
is mutational bias associated with DNA replication and
repair, which exerts directional pressure on nucleotide composition [24]. In fact, between-genome codon biases can be
predicted solely by %GC and context-dependent nucleotide
biases (that is, mutation rates at each site are dependent on
the identity of neighboring nucleotides) calculated from noncoding regions [67,68]. It is interesting to note that non-coding regions mapped into discrete clusters, distinct from coding regions of the same genome or non-coding regions of
different genomes, including those with identical %GC. Differences in genome signature of coding and non-coding
sequences from the same genome are to be expected based on
differing functional constraints on these regions (for example, coding amino acids versus small RNAs or regulatory elements such as promoters). The distinction of non-coding
regions from different genomes is consistent with genomespecific mutational biases.
An alternative to the mutation bias hypothesis, at least for
coding sequences, is that genome signatures are shaped by
factors related to translation. Changes in codon usage can be
driven by changes in the tRNA gene complement [69,70] that
may occur, for example, through interaction with plasmids
and viruses [71]. However, we found AMD genomes with distinct genome signatures, such as G-plasma, E-plasma, and
Ferroplasma, that have only minor differences in tRNA gene
content, and these differences do not correspond to observed
differences in codon usage. In addition to tRNA gene complement, there may be changes in tRNA gene regulation, which
can significantly impact cellular tRNA concentrations and
have been correlated with changes in codon usage [72]. Thus,
although we cannot rule out a tRNA regulatory influence on
genome signatures, our findings suggest that coevolution of
tRNA gene content and codon usage is not a primary mechanism underlying the divergence of genome signatures in
related AMD populations.
Codon bias can also arise as the result of selection for certain
codons that are optimal for fast and/or accurate translation
[73]. This form of codon bias primarily influences the subset
of genes encoding highly expressed proteins, is prevalent for
fast-growing organisms [69,74], and correlates with ecological strategy [75]. In fact, a Leptospirillum group II genome
fragment encoding nine ribosomal proteins and two translation elongation factors had distinctive tetranucleotide composition, indicating that this mode of codon bias occurs in
AMD organisms. However, as commonly construed, translational selection would influence within-genome codon bias,
not the genome-wide codon biases that differentiate populations as observed in our study. It is tempting to speculate that
differences in ecological strategy (for example, response rate
to resource availability [76]) could have genome-wide influence on codon usage, but there is currently no evidence in our
dataset to suggest that this is the case.

Volume 10, Issue 8, Article R85

Dick et al. R85.11

Finally, restriction avoidance places another selective
genome-wide constraint on DNA composition that may contribute to genome signatures. Under-representation of palindromic tetranucleotides (Figure 6) has been attributed to
avoidance of enzymes designed to recognize and degrade foreign DNA [22,32,46]. Our data show that palindrome avoidance contributes to the genome signature but is not the sole
or even primary determinant. Most archaeal viruses and bacteriophage have sequence signatures that resemble their
hosts, including avoidance of specific subsets of palindromes.
However, mismatches between the tetranucleotide signatures
of AMDV2 and AMDV5 and their respective hosts point to the
lesser importance of palindrome avoidance in these organisms. In the case of AMDV5, other evidence suggests a recent
alteration in host range [12]. It is interesting to note that the
genomes of archaeal AMD viruses encode several restriction
modification (RM) system genes. These may have significance for virus host-interactions [77] and for influencing
genome signatures. Broad host range viruses or viruses that
jump to new hosts can potentially drive changes in the host
sequence signatures if they replace or supplement the restriction systems of the host. Alternatively, the degree of similarity
in tetranucleotide signatures of viruses and their hosts may
be a function of the extent to which the virus relies upon its
host's replication and translation machinery (for example,
associated with a lysogenic versus lytic lifestyle) [41,42,63].

Implications for metagenomic, ecological, and
evolutionary studies
Due to the high levels of diversity in most natural systems,
random sequencing approaches yield fragmentary data, often
comprising genomic sequences no more than a few kilobases
in length. While more comprehensive coverage of individual
organisms can be achieved by single cell genomics [78-80] or
targeted, large-insert approaches [81,82], random shotgun
approaches retain two important advantages: the random
nature provides insights that are unbiased by preconceived
notions of community composition; and population-level variation is captured because each sequencing read derives from
a different individual cell.
A key challenge for virtually all shotgun metagenomics investigations is the assignment of genome fragments to the organism they derive from. This step links organism to metabolism
and function and is essential if we are to understand microbial community dynamics and predict ecosystem level
impacts of changes in community membership and structure.
Binning is particularly challenging for lower-abundance
organisms, which may play keystone roles that are critical to
ecosystem function. Thus, our finding that tetra-ESOM can
resolve the phylogenetic affiliation of genome fragments on
the scale of two mate-paired reads is of great significance.
This approach has clear applicability to low-complexity datasets such as those derived from our AMD biofilms, bioreactors [83], and enrichment cultures [84]. In fact, even for the
relatively extensively analyzed AMD dataset, it revealed mul-

Genome Biology 2009,

tiple new genomic clusters, including a near complete
genome of a novel actinobacterium (GJ Dick et al., in preparation), a putative plasmid, and many discrete but less wellsampled populations.
Tetra-ESOM may also provide a powerful method for analysis
of unassembled data from complex samples such as soil, seawater, and the human microbiome if representative isolate
genomes are available. The feasibility of binning metagenomic sequences from complex samples using reference
genomes will increase with current initiatives to fill in the
phylogenetic tree with genome sequences from cultivated
microorganisms.
An important advantage of unsupervised, compositionalbased approaches such as tetra-ESOM is that gene sequences
need not be represented in databases to be identified; only
representation of the genome signature is required. This is in
contrast to fragment recruitment [13] and BLAST-based binning approaches that only work for homologous sequences.
We found that clusters of a few hundred kilobases of sequence
(as little as 20% of the genome) were resolved, suggesting that
a few fosmids or bacterial artificial chromosomes linked to
16S rRNA genes can be sufficient to serve as a reference to
define a bin. Thus, recent progress in using large-insert
metagenomic libraries to link 16S rRNA genes to genomic
sequence from diverse uncultivated microorganisms is very
valuable in this regard [85].
Because the reach of composition-based approaches to binning extends beyond gene content of reference genomes, they
hold great promise for identifying and classifying genes from
the variable fraction of the pan-genome (present in only a
subset of strains or species), an important determinant of
pathogenicity and niche differentiation [86-88]. In AMD
populations, genome reconstruction has shown that this
strain-variable fraction often involves inserted plasmid and
virus sequences [8,9]. In the current study, these integrated
elements clustered either with the host genome or in regions
shared between different species or genera. Since horizontally
transferred DNA is rapidly converted to the genome signature
of its new host [22,28,89], the extent to which such genomic
regions reflect the genome-wide signature of nucleotide composition is likely a function of the donor of the genetic material and how recently they were acquired. Recently acquired
sequences with distinctive tetranucleotide patterns may bin
incorrectly, and unexpected binning outcomes can be used to
identify laterally transferred regions [62,90].
Although the tetra-ESOM method works well to separate
sequence fragments from organisms distinct at the genus or
higher level, it has some limitations. Tetra-ESOM is generally
unable to distinguish closely related species or strains. An
important question, especially for more diverse samples, is
whether limitations in genome sequence signature space will
impose an inherent constraint on the number of populations

Volume 10, Issue 8, Article R85

that can be resolved. There are a staggering 6 × 10222 ways to
code for a typical protein in our samples (based on an average
protein size of 467 amino acids and assuming an average of 3
possible ways to code for any amino acid). This richness of
protein coding space suggests ample capacity for numerous
genome signatures. To date, SOMs have shown promising
results in resolving up to 81 complete genomes, in successfully classifying fragments of 1,502 genomes into phylogenetic groups, and in visualizing phylogenetic clustering of
sequences in complex environmental samples [46]. However,
it remains difficult to assess the accuracy and phylogenetic
resolution of oligonucleotide-based SOMs on metagenomic
datasets from diverse natural microbial communities.
Another concern is computational demand. Continued
increases in processor speeds will likely need to be supplemented with more efficient and/or accurate algorithms such
as the recently introduced hyperbolic SOM [91] and growing
SOM [59].

Conclusions

Bacterial, archaeal, and viral populations in the AMD biofilm
community have genome-wide signatures of nucleotide composition that are effectively captured and visualized through
self-organizing maps of tetranucleotide frequency. We conclude that even under extremely acidic conditions, shared
environmental pressure does not obscure genome signatures
of nucleotide composition. Our data point to pervasive mechanisms of generating and maintaining genome signatures;
although a variety of factors and processes contribute, we
propose that mutational bias is the primary underlying mechanism driving the divergence of genome signature between
closely related organisms. The resulting signal, evident
through synonymous codon usage, is genome-wide and sufficiently diagnostic to classify fragmentary metagenomic data
from coexisting populations of a natural microbial community at approximately the genus level. However, distinguishing features of genome signatures may be subtle, being
masked by within-genome heterogeneity and the multidimensional nature of tetranucleotide frequency patterns.
Tetra-ESOM is a key method for visualizing and exposing
these potentially weak signals. Being unsupervised, it
requires no database representation of the organisms
present. Visualization of the data structure highlights differences between populations and reveals atypical regions corresponding to biologically meaningful genomic features such as
mobile elements or previously unrecognized genotypes
present at low abundance in the community. When employed
in conjunction with complementary methods such as
genomic assembly and analysis of phylogenetic marker genes,
genome signatures offer powerful perspectives on metagenomic data.

community genomics data were performed using phred/
phrap/consed package as detailed previously [12,55]. The

which assembled into 15,929 contigs and 36.6 Mb of composite sequence.

learning rate of 0.5 with linear cooling to 0.1; Gaussian kernel
function.

Clustering resolution versus evolutionary distance
To quantify the degree of clustering between closely related
genomes, we analyzed SOM maps using fixed point kernel
densities [95]. Spatial data from the SOM was imported into
ArcGIS (ESRI Software) and clusters were defined using
Hawth's Analysis Tools for ArcGIS [96]. Cluster boundaries
were determined using density estimators that captured 90%
of data points from each genome (Additional data file 1). We
then calculated separation between genomes as a percentage
(Non-overlapping points/Total number of points) for two
bins being compared. Average amino acid identity was calculated as described previously [1].

Predicted tetranucleotide frequency
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA genes was constructed by
neighbor joining (default parameters) with the ARB software
package [92] and 'SILVA SSU ref' database [93].

Calculation of tetranucleotide frequencies and
clustering by ESOM
Tetranucleotide frequencies were determined for each assembled contig using a custom Perl script. Frequencies were calculated with a 1-bp sliding window and pairs of reverse
complementary tetranucleotides were summed in order to
avoid strand bias. Longer contigs and assembled genomes
were split into 5-kb windows and only contigs longer than 2
kb were considered unless noted otherwise. To assess binning
accuracy, data points (representing contigs/windows) are
colored according to their genome of origin (when known),
but this information is not available to the clustering process.
Contigs were clustered by tetranucleotide frequency utilizing
Databionics ESOM Tools [94]. The input for tetra-ESOM was
a 136-dimensional vector (representing the frequencies of the
136 unique reverse complement tetranucleotide pairs, normalized for contig length) for each contig/window. These raw
frequencies were transformed with the 'Robust ZT' option
built into Databionics ESOM Tools, which normalizes the
data using robust estimates of mean and variance. Data were
permuted before each run to avoid errors due to sampling
order. Maps were toroidal (borderless) with Euclidean grid
distance and dimensions scaled from the default map size (50
× 82) as a function of the number of data points, to a ratio of
approximately 5.5 map nodes per data point. For example, a
typical clustering with approximately 7,500 data points was
run on map with dimensions 155 × 255. Training was conducted with the K-Batch algorithm (k = 0.15%) for 20 training
epochs. The standard best match search method was used
with local best match search radius of 8. Other training
parameters were as follows: Gaussian weight initialization
method; Euclidean data space function; starting value for
training radius of 50 with linear cooling to 1; starting value for

The predicted frequency of each unique pair of reverse complementary tetranucleotides was calculated based on
genome-wide frequencies of potentially contributing codons.
As shown in Figure 5, for any given tetranucleotide there are
12 potentially associated codons depending on coding strand
and reading frame. Four codons (numbers 3, 4, 9, and 10 in
Figure 5) are fully captured by the tetranucleotide, four are
partially captured at two of three positions (numbers 2, 5, 8,
and 11), and four are partially captured at one of three positions (codons 1, 6, 7, and 12). Each of these three classes is
weighted according to their contribution: 1, 2/3, and 1/3
respectively. For partially captured codons, contributions of
all possibilities were taken into account; for example, in Figure 5, codon number 5 (TGX) there are four possible codons TGA, TGT, TGC, and TGG.

Binning performance on variable length sequence
fragments and subsampled genomes
Sensitivity (percentage of fragments from each genome correctly identified) and precision (percentage of fragments in
each bin belonging to the correct genome) of binning were
calculated for a subset of assembled genomes that are deeply
sampled and manually curated (Table 1; Additional data file
2). Fragment size was varied in two ways: all contigs were
broken into a given size (2, 4, 6, or 10 kb); or 10% of each
genome was randomly selected and fragmented (0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
or 2.0 kb) while the remaining fraction of the genome was
fragmented into 5-kb windows (Additional data file 2). Bin
territories were defined manually, using boundaries apparent
via distance-based background topology (U-Matrix) as guidelines. It is important to note this method allows data points
between bins or near borders to remain unclassified. Analysis
of subsampled genomes was conducted with assembled
genomes only - unassigned fragments were excluded to prevent them from contributing to definition of bins. Genomes
were fragmented into 5-kb sequences, which were then randomly selected to obtain the indicated percentage of the
genome.

Sequence signatures in coding versus non-coding
regions
Intergenic regions were extracted and concatenated, with 'N's
inserted between regions to avoid generation of erroneous
tetranucleotides. Intergenic regions were grouped by size (in
20-bp bins) to monitor variance in sequence signatures from
intergenic regions of differing lengths. All coding sequences
were similarly concatenated with interleaving 'N's. Concatenated coding and non-coding regions were then broken into
5-kb windows and run against the same background dataset
of assembled genomes and unassigned sequences as usual.

Sequence signatures in extracellular and highly
expressed protein-coding genes
Shotgun proteomics data were obtained for Leptospirillum
group II extracellular and whole cell fractions from the
ABend, ABfront, and UBA locations of the Richmond mine
[55,66]. Proteins were defined as enriched in the extracellular
fraction if, in at least two of the three samples, they were only
detected in the extracellular fraction, or the ratio of spectral
counts from extracellular to intracellular fraction was > 2.
The 50 most abundantly expressed proteins were identified
on the basis of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectral
counts. ESOM analysis of genes encoding extracellular and
highly expressed proteins were both conducted as described
above; open reading frames were concatenated, interleaved
with 'N's, then split into 5-kb windows and analyzed along
with the full dataset.
