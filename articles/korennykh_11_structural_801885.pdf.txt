Abstract
Background: The unfolded protein response (UPR) controls the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). Central to this signaling pathway is the ER-resident bifunctional transmembrane kinase/
endoribonuclease Ire1. The endoribonuclease (RNase) domain of Ire1 initiates a non-conventional mRNA splicing
reaction, leading to the production of a transcription factor that controls UPR target genes. The mRNA splicing
reaction is an obligatory step of Ire1 signaling, yet its mechanism has remained poorly understood due to the
absence of substrate-bound crystal structures of Ire1, the lack of structural similarity between Ire1 and other
RNases, and a scarcity of quantitative enzymological data. Here, we experimentally define the active site of Ire1
RNase and quantitatively evaluate the contribution of the key active site residues to catalysis.
Results: This analysis and two new crystal structures suggest that Ire1 RNase uses histidine H1061 and tyrosine
Y1043 as the general acid-general base pair contributing ≥ 7.6 kcal/mol and 1.4 kcal/mol to transition state
stabilization, respectively, and asparagine N1057 and arginine R1056 for coordination of the scissile phosphate.
Investigation of the stem-loop recognition revealed that additionally to the stem-loops derived from the classic Ire1
substrates HAC1 and Xbp1 mRNA, Ire1 can site-specifically and rapidly cleave anticodon stem-loop (ASL) of
unmodified tRNAPhe, extending known substrate specificity of Ire1 RNase.
Conclusions: Our data define the catalytic center of Ire1 RNase and suggest a mechanism of RNA cleavage: each RNase
monomer apparently contains a separate catalytic apparatus for RNA cleavage, whereas two RNase subunits contribute
to RNA stem-loop docking. Conservation of the key residues among Ire1 homologues suggests that the mechanism
elucidated here for yeast Ire1 applies to Ire1 in metazoan cells, and to the only known Ire1 homologue RNase L.

Background
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an intracellular
signaling pathway that provides homeostatic feedback
regulation between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
the gene expression program in the nucleus. To this end,
the UPR senses the conditions inside the ER, detecting
an imbalance between newly made proteins and the protein folding capacity in the ER, and activates a corrective
response. For signaling, the UPR uses a transmembrane
sensor of ER-lumenal unfolded proteins, Ire1.
Ire1 is an ER membrane-resident receptor that serves
as a primary signal transduction device in the UPR
conserved from yeast to mammalian cells [1-4].

Oligomerization of Ire1-lumenal domains is thought to
be a key event in initiating signal propagation across
the ER membrane that enables the cooperative assembly of Ire1’s cytosolic kinase and RNase modules into
an ordered oligomer with a defined three-dimensional
structure [5]. The oligomer is stabilized by phosphates
resulting from autophosphorylation of the kinase
domain and allows juxtaposition of Ire1’s RNase
domains, which presumably activate the RNase [5,6].
Once activated, Ire1 initiates the non-conventional
splicing of HAC1 mRNA (yeast) or XBP1 mRNA
(metazoan) by cleaving the mRNA at two conserved
sites to excise an intron [5,7]. An RNA ligase (tRNA
ligase in yeast and a still unknown enzyme in
metazoan cells) rejoins the severed exons to complete
the reaction. Intron removal allows for the production

of the UPR transcription activators Hac1 and XBP1,
respectively, which upregulate UPR target genes.
Ire1’s RNase domain thereby serves the primary role
in signal transmission. The mechanism underlying activation of Ire1 RNase by oligomerization and the
mechanism of mRNA recognition and cleavage have
remained elusive. To date, there are no known structural homologues of the Ire1 RNase domain that could
help answering these questions. The best attempt at
defining the mechanism of RNA cleavage has been
made based on sequence conservation arguments and
on a crystal structure of Ire1 dimer with a ligand-free
RNase domain, which also lacked a fragment of the
RNase active site [6]. In this work, the RNase dimer was
proposed to contain two independent catalytic centers,
one per Ire1 monomer, which would simultaneously
accommodate the two RNA stem-loops conserved in all
known mRNA substrates of Ire1 [6]. According to the
proposed model, two stem-loops would form a kissing
interaction for docking and recognition by Ire1. Subsequent studies proposed [5] that such a kissing interaction is not likely because Ire1 exhibits no preference for
RNA substrates with dual stem-loops over substrates
with a single stem-loop, indicating that a single stemloop structure is the cognate folded substrate of Ire1
RNase.
It has been also suggested [6] that putative active site
residues are positioned similarly in Ire1 RNase and in
pre-tRNA splicing endonuclease (SEN), although these
two endoribonucleases share no apparent sequence or
structural homology and cleave dissimilar RNA substrates (stem-loop versus bulge-helix-bulge motif). The
authors point out [6] that the putative catalytic residues
in Ire1 do not align completely with those in SEN and
would require a 5-Å displacement of Y1043 (in yeast
Ire1) to bring it into a position corresponding to that of
Y249 in SEN. A 5-Å conformational change in Ire1
RNase upon substrate binding has been proposed based
on these arguments [6]. A new cocrystal structure of
Ire1 RNase with an oligonucleotide bound, which we
provide in this work, does not support considerable conformational changes in the position of Y1043. Therefore,
Ire1 and SEN apparently cleave RNA using different
arrangements of active site residues. Underscoring this
difference, substitution of a single catalytic histidine
residue H1061 produced orders-of-magnitude greater
effect on the catalytic activity of Ire1 (this work) compared to only a 28-fold rate reduction in SEN [8].
Conservation of residue H1061, the only invariant histidine in the RNase domain of Ire1, was used to propose
that H1061 marks the catalytic center and serves for
general acid-general base catalysis [6]. In agreement
with this model, mutation H1061A reduced RNA cleavage [6]. However, this mutation was analyzed using a

Page 2 of 15

qualitative approach that had a narrow dynamic range
and did not distinguish between effects on binding and
catalysis. Furthermore, mutation H1061A not only
removed the ability of histidine to transfer protons but
also the ability to form hydrogen bonds, which alone
could explain the observed effect on RNA cleavage,
without invoking H1061 in general acid-general base
catalysis. Considering that ribonucleases can cleave RNA
stem-loops by using for proton transfer basic amino
acids instead of conventional ionizable residues (histidine, glutamate and aspartate) [9], the very involvement
of H1061 in general acid-general base catalysis could
not be deduced convincingly from any of the available
data.
To understand the mechanism of RNA cleavage by
Ire1, we combined quantitative analysis of rationally
designed Ire1 mutants and X-ray crystallography. We
show that proton transfer by histidine H1061 contributes greater than five orders of magnitude (≥ 7.6 kcal/
mol) to catalysis of RNA cleavage, which experimentally
defines a key catalytic functionality in the active center
of Ire1 RNase. Using the non-disruptive Y1043F mutation we experimentally demonstrate a catalytic role of
the OH group of Y1043 and also show an important
role in RNA binding of a helix-loop element (HLE) residue, R1039. Our findings suggest parallels between catalytic centers of Ire1 and the well characterized RNases
A and T1 and propose an unexpected mechanism of oligomerization-induced in trans RNA recognition by Ire1.

Results
Computational analysis of the RNA binding properties of
Ire1

To glean insights into Ire1 interactions with HAC1/
XBP1 mRNA, we analyzed the RNA binding properties
of the entire surface of the Ire1 oligomer [5]. Surface
electrostatics calculations [10] are commonly used for
such analyses, but they produce ambiguous results
because electrostatics is not the sole determinant of
RNA binding. Here we used a modified optimal proteinRNA area (OPRA) algorithm that previously demonstrated high prediction accuracy [11]. We refined this
method by adding phylogenetic conservation to the
scores and termed the resulting algorithm ‘conservationweighted OPRA’ (cwOPRA; to be described elsewhere).
The cwOPRA analysis of RNA binding properties of the
Ire1 oligomer produced a high-contrast image of the
surface RNA binding propensity. A single RNA binding
site was strongly predicted in the center of every backto-back RNase dimer [6]. The RNA binding site is proximal to the dynamic helix-loop element HLE, which
becomes more ordered upon formation of Ire1/Ire1
interfaces in the high-order oligomer and has been proposed to serve as a part of the active site [5] (Figure 1a,

b). The rest of the Ire1 surface was predicted not to
interact with RNA (we note, however, that the crystal
structure is lacking a highly basic N-terminus, which is
disordered and could serve as a secondary RNA binding
site). We next validated this computational prediction
using a cocrystal structure of Ire1 with an
oligonucleotide.
Crystal structure of Ire1 with dCdCdGdCdAdG bound to
the RNase domain

For crystallization trials, we tested a panel of RNaseresistant RNA analogs with 2’-deoxy or 2’-methoxy substitutions throughout and a variety of Ire1 constructs.
Only a single combination led to formation of diffracting crystals as discussed below. Attempts to soak mononucleotides,
dinucleotides,
trinucleotides
or
oligonucleotides (0.5-20 mM) into previously characterized Ire1 crystals [5] were unsuccessful. No additional
difference density was observed, which could correspond
to the soaked-in substrate analogs.
By contrast, cocrystallization of Ire1KR32 with a 6mer 2’-deoxy-substituted oligonucleotide bearing the
consensus sequence of an Ire1 splice site CCGCAG
(the use of 2’-deoxy substitutions prevents degradation
by Ire1 RNase) resulted in crystals of the
Ire1KR32·dCdCdGdCdAdG complex. Ire1KR32 construct contains the Ire1’s kinase domain, the RNase
domain, and a 32-amino-acid linker previously shown
to be required for optimal RNase activity [5]. The
dCdCdGdCdAdG oligonucleotide bound to Ire1KR32
with Kiapp = 200 μM determined from inhibition of the
Ire1KR32-catalyzed cleavage of HP21, a small stem/
loop structure containing the 3’ splice site of XBP1
mRNA [5]. This value is approximately 40-fold weaker
than that for the cognate stem-loop (Km = 5 μM, Figure 1c and Additional file 1, Figure S1) possibly due to
a more flexible structure of the single-stranded oligonucleotide dCdCdGdCdAdG compared to HP21 RNA
stem-loop and/or due to the lack of 2’OH groups.
Unlike the oligonucleotide-free Ire1, which crystallizes
in space group P21 21 2 [5], the Ire1KR32·dCdCdGdCdAdG oligomer crystallized in space group C222 and
diffracted to 6.6 Å (Additional file 1, Table S1). The
presence of the oligonucleotide allowed Ire1KR32 to
crystallize without a ligand occupying the kinase ATP
binding pocket, providing an important insight into
the mechanism of cofactor-dependent activation of
Ire1 [12].
We used the 3.2-Å structure of Ire1 crystallized in the
absence of a nucleic acid substrate [5] for molecular
replacement and subsequent rigid-body refinement, as
described in Methods and in the accompanying manuscript [12]. At 6-7 Å resolution, the secondary structure
of proteins and the sugar-phosphate backbone, which is

Page 4 of 15

the most electron-dense part of nucleic acids, can be
visualized in ribonucleoprotein complexes [13,14].
Accordingly, we observed a strong Fo-Fc difference electron density at the core of the RNase domain, which
coincided with the cwOPRA-predicted RNA binding site
(Figure 1b). The electron density was delineated by two
separate contours related by twofold symmetry (Figure
1b, d). Each contour (at level 7s) defines an elongated
volume of approximately 20 Å in length, consistent with
the length of one dCdCdGdCdAdG molecule bound per
RNase monomer. We placed Ire1 side chains according
to the 3.2-Å-resolution search model used for the molecular replacement (Figure 1d). Such an approximation is
valid because the protein backbone traces and the quaternary structure of Ire1 oligomers superimpose in the
6.6Å and the 3.2Å structures, even though they crystallized in different space groups (P21212 vs C222). Based
on the complete superposition of the polypeptide backbones in Ire1KR32·APY29 [5] and in Ire1·dCdCdGdCdAdG complexes, we can rule out the possibility of a
large-scale movement in the catalytic core of Ire1 upon
binding of the substrate analog.
Probing the catalytic mechanism of Ire1 RNase via
mutagenesis: role of H1061

The electron density for dCdCdGdCdAdG is located in
the cleft formed by the HLEs [5]. The position of the
electron density suggests that eight protonatable residues of Ire1 located proximal to the substrate mimic
could, in principle, contribute to general acid-general
base catalysis leading to the formation of the 2’, 3’-cyclic
phosphate [15]. Because Ire1 does not require divalent
metal ions for RNase activity [5], it must rely exclusively
on amino acid side chains to carry out catalysis. In the
identified group of amino acids, only H1061 and D1064
have pKa values near neutrality, analogous to the catalytic residues involved in proton transfer in well characterized ribonucleases, such as RNase A [16] and RNase
T1 [17]. The H1061 is invariant in all known Ire1
sequences and the only Ire1 homologue RNase L [18].
By contrast, D1064 is mutated in several organisms to
residues incapable of proton transfer (Additional file 1,
Table S2), indicating that it is dispensable for catalysis.
Mutation of the catalytic histidine to alanine, asparagine or glutamine diminishes catalysis by ribonucleases
T1 and A by 10 2 to 104 -fold [17,19,20]. In a previous
study, an H1061A mutation in Ire1 was reported to
inhibit the RNase activity; however, the quantitative
effect of this mutation on catalysis has not been measured [6]. To determine the quantitative contribution of
H1061 to catalysis, we expressed and purified a mutant
of Ire1KR32 in which H1061 was replaced by asparagine. We chose mutation to asparagine because it best
preserves the space filling and hydrogen bonding

Korennykh et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:47
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/47

properties of histidine, while removing histidine’s ability
to transfer protons and to support catalysis. We
observed that Ire1KR32(H1061N) displays a ≥ 3 × 105fold rate reduction compared to wild-type Ire1KR32
(Figure 2a), strongly indicating that H1061 plays a central part in catalysis.
Next, we ruled out a possibility that the large effect of
the H1061N mutation arose from a perturbation of oligomerization. To this end, we monitored the optical
density of Ire1KR32(H1061N) solutions at 500 nm,
which provides a quantitative measure of Ire1KR32 oligomerization (Methods and [12]). Ire1KR32(H1061N)
mutant exhibited an indistinguishable oligomerization
profile from that of wild-type Ire1KR32 (Figure 2b), suggesting that the H1061N mutation does not interfere
with oligomer formation.
To further ascertain that the dramatic rate reduction
does not arise from more local conformational perturbations of Ire1 RNase, uncoupled from oligomerization, we
crystallized Ire1KR32(H1061N) in complex with the synthetic ligand APY29, which binds in Ire1’s kinase ATP
binding pocket [5]. We determined a 3.65-Å-resolution
crystal structure of this mutant (Additional file 1, Table
S3), which proved identical to that of wild-type
Ire1KR32 (Figure 2c; Additional file 1, Figure S2). Our
functional and structural results pertaining to H1061N
mutant therefore indicate that the greater than 3 × 105fold catalytic impairment of Ire1KR32(H1061N) arises
from a direct role of H1061 in proton transfer during
RNA cleavage.
Due to the twofold symmetry of the Ire1 RNase dimer
[6], a single H1061N mutation removes two H1061 residues in the vicinity of the RNase active site (Figure 1b).
We thus wondered whether the catalytic impairment of
the H1061N mutant might arise from this symmetry: if
Ire1 required both H1061 residues together to catalyze
phosphodiester cleavage, we would de facto have measured activity of a double mutant. To explore this possibility, we built Ire1 oligomers in which each catalytic
H1061 would be paired with a non-catalytic H1061N in
chimeric RNase dimers. To this end, we titrated catalytically inactive Ire1KR32(H1061N) into a solution of wildtype Ire1KR32 held at a constant concentration just
below its oligomerization threshold. For enzymes that
follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, addition of a catalytically inactive mutant to a wild-type reaction inhibits the
rate, as inactive enzyme sequesters the available substrate. By contrast, we observed approximately tenfold
activation of Ire1KR32 before onset of inhibition at
excessive concentrations of Ire1KR32(H1061N) (Figure
2d). Stimulation occurs because wild-type Ire1KR32
becomes trapped in a wild-type/H1061N hetero-oligomer as enzyme concentration increases and causes Ire1
to oligomerize. Kinetic modeling of this experiment

Page 5 of 15

shows that such a response is expected only if wild-type:
H1061N heterodimers in the Ire1KR32 oligomer were
active RNases (Additional file 1, Figure S3 and Additional file 2). We conclude that only one of the two
H1061 residues in the twofold symmetric RNase dimer
is required for RNA cleavage.
Proximity to the electron density of the substrate,
mutagenesis analysis, evolutionary conservation and the
neutral pKa value of histidine all converge on the suggestion that H1061 serves a catalytic function. Cleavage
of an RNA backbone by other non-metal RNases
involves pairs of conserved residues that carry out general acid-general base catalysis and lie at a fixed mutual
separation of 6-8 Å (for example, PDB ID 1r5c, 1rga;
Figure 3a). In Ire1, only two invariant amino acids,
R1056 and Y1043, are located 5.5 Å and 8 Å from
H1061, respectively (Additional file 1, Table S2), and
hence emerge as candidates to be a catalytic partner of
H1061. Steric considerations discussed below and high
pKa value of arginine argue that R1056 is unlikely to fulfill this role, suggesting Y1043 as the most plausible
partner of H1061 (Figure 3b, c; see Discussion). We
note that the R1056 side chain is deeply buried in the
active site, which would make it difficult to interpret
results of mutational analyses. We therefore did not
pursue analysis of R1056 at this time.
Probing the role of Y1043 as the catalytic partner of
H1061

Previously, it was suggested that if Ire1 RNase resembled
SEN endoribonuclease, then tyrosine Y1043 may serve
as the general base [6]. The fact that Y1043 resides
approximately 5 Å from the analogous tyrosine in SEN
was used to propose that Ire1 RNase should undergo an
obligate conformational change upon binding of substrate to position Y1043 relative to H1061 as in SEN.
To test this possibility, we examined the electron density
for the Y1043-bearing loop in the Ire1KR32·dCdCdGdCdAdG complex (Figure 3b; Additional file 1, Figure S4).
We found that backbones of the HLE and of the adjacent Y1043-bearing loop occupy the same position as in
the 3.2-Å crystal structure obtained without bound oligonucleotide (PDB ID 3fbv). These findings support a
model that tyrosine Y1043 does not move over a significant distance upon substrate binding.
To assess whether Y1043 contributes to catalysis, we
prepared and quantitatively characterized the mutant
Ire1KR32(Y1043F), which is predicted to disable any
involvement of Y1043 in proton transfer while ensuring
minimal structural perturbation to the protein compared
to a potentially far more disruptive Y1043A mutation
tested previously [6]. We obtained an activation profile
with Ire1KR32(Y1043F) (Figure 3d, open circles). At
enzyme concentrations exceeding 3 μM, the observed

rate constant for cleavage of HP21 RNA plateaued at a
first-order single-turnover rate constant k2 = 0.022 s-1.
This value is approximately tenfold smaller than the
corresponding value for wild-type Ire1KR32 (k2 = 0.25 s1
), demonstrating that the OH group of Y1043 is important for catalysis. Similar to the H1061N mutation, the
Y1043F mutation had no effect on the oligomerization
equilibrium of Ire1KR32 (Figure 2b). The deleterious
effect of the Y1043F mutation was greater at subsaturating k2/K1/2 conditions encountered below approximately
3 μM enzyme concentrations, indicating that Y1043 also
contributes to binding of the RNA substrate (Figure 3d).
Probing the role of the HLE in RNA recognition

Location of the dCdCdGdCdAdG electron density in
proximity to the HLE (Figure 1b, d) confirms the previously posed hypothesis [5,6] that this element serves as
an important part of the active site. It was proposed that
residues from HLEs could serve for binding and recognition of RNA substrates, rather than for catalysis. Mutations in the HLE are therefore expected to provide a
valuable control to contrast the catalytically important
mutations of H1061 and Y1043 described above. To test
the role of the HLE in RNA cleavage, we prepared
Ire1KR32 with a mutation of an arginine residue within
the HLE, Ire1KR32(R1039A) and measured the titration
rate profile for the Ire1KR32(R1039A) mutant (Figure 3d,
diamonds). At saturating enzyme concentrations
Ire1KR32(R1039A) achieved the same first-order singleturnover rate constant k2 as did wild-type Ire1KR32 (Figure 3d, closed circles), indicating that R1039 makes no
contribution to stabilization of the transition state. Under
subsaturating conditions, however, the R1039A mutant
became deleterious, revealing a role of R1039 in substrate
binding. Analogous to other mutations tested here,
Ire1KR32(R1039A) exhibited an unperturbed oligomerization profile (Figure 2b), indicating that this mutation
too does not affect the enzyme’s oligomerization equilibrium. Both structural (Figure 1d) and functional data
with Ire1KR32(R1039A) therefore show that the HLE
plays an important role in recognition of RNA substrates.
Electron density-guided docking of an RNA stem-loop
into Ire1 RNase (below) suggests that the HLE of one
RNase monomer may contribute to RNA cleavage in the
active site of an adjacent RNase monomer, acting in
trans. To test this possibility, we performed in trans
activation experiments as in Figure 2d, in which we analyzed the activity of Ire1KR32(wild-type)/Ire1KR32
(R1039A) heterodimers. To ensure that effect of the
R1039A mutation is indeed measured in trans, we additionally disabled the catalytic site of the R1039A mutant
by the H1061N mutation, as outlined in Figure 4a. The
experiment was conducted as in Figure 2d, but contained lower concentration of wild-type Ire1KR32 (0.3

μM or approximately 0.06 Km) to ascertain a regime in
which subsaturating conditions (k 2 /K 1/2 ) were maintained during the titration. This was an important consideration because if the reactions were allowed to
approach the first-order k2 regime, the deleterious effect
of the R1039A mutation on binding would have been
masked (note loss of effect from the R1039A mutation
in Figure 3d when the reaction plateaued at E0 > 5 μM).
Using this experiment, we found that the RNase activity
of wild-type Ire1KR32 stimulated in trans by the double
mutant Ire1KR32(R1039A, H1061N) was an order-ofmagnitude lower than with the H1061N single mutant
(Figure 4b). The chimeric dimer with the double mutation (G in Figure 4a) therefore binds RNA more weakly
than the chimeric dimer with the single mutation (E in
Figure 4a), whereas the only difference between these
two cases is an intact HLE (E) versus a HLE bearing a
single R1039A mutation (G). It follows that the RNA
cleavage reaction catalyzed by one RNase monomer is
sensitive to a mutation in the HLE of the paired monomer. These observations strongly support a model of a
composite RNA-binding surface in Ire1 RNase, which
also emerges from the electron density-guided RNA
stem-loop docking described below.
Ire1 site-specifically cleaves stem-loop anticodon of
tRNAPhe

Ire1 recognizes and site-specifically cleaves conserved
sites in HAC1 and XBP1 mRNA, which are characterized by a stem containing approximately five WatsonCrick base pairs and a seven-residue loop with a consensus sequence CNGNNGN [21]. To understand how
Ire1 might recognize such stem-loops, we searched
bioinformatically for RNA heptaloops with similar features. This search showed that the anticodon stem-loop
of tRNA Phe closely resembles the Ire1 consensus substrate (Figure 5a). To verify that this sequence similarity
meaningfully identifies an Ire1 substrate, we conducted
RNA cleavage assays and compared the kinetics of cleavage by Ire1 of tRNAPhe anticodon stem-loop and cleavage of the stem-loop derived from XBP1 mRNA, HP21.
Ire1 cleaved both stem-loops in a single site and with
similar rates (Figure 5b), indicating that the tRNAPhe
anticodon stem-loop indeed provides a good model of
the cognate Ire1 stem-loops from XBP1 and HAC1
mRNA. As multiple crystal structures of tRNAPhe have
been already solved, this finding enabled us to model
the docking of an RNA stem-loop to the Ire1 RNase
active site (Figure 5c-e).

complete catalytic center in the context of the Ire1

dimers formed via interface IF1c [5]. Due to a twofold symmetry, each RNase dimer can accommodate RNA stem-loop in two equivalent
orientations (such as A and B). Both orientations are productive for wild-type Ire1. Neither orientation is productive for the H1061N mutant (C)
and (D) due to disrupted catalysis. Only one orientation (E) is productive for the wild-type/H1061N chimera. Only one orientation (G) is also
productive for the wild-type/H1061N+R1039A chimera, however this orientation is impaired by the R1039A mutation in the helix-loop element
(HLE). (b) Titration of wild-type Ire1KR32 with Ire1KR32(H1061N) single mutant and Ire1KR32(H1061N, R1039A) double mutant. Reactions were

cleavage.

oligomer agrees with the model proposed previously
based on experiments in which several Ire1 variants
with dissimilar RNase-inactivating mutations were
mixed [6]. The previous observation showed that none
of the mutant mixtures have RNase activity and was
interpreted in favor of individual active sites over a composite catalytic center (created by association of two
RNase monomers) [6]. Importantly, however, this lack

of RNase activity can be reasonably reconciled with
both, per monomer and composite active site architectures, as well as with a third possibility of indirect
defects in Ire1 RNase due to misfolding or conformational perturbation of the mutants. By contrast, the
observation of electron density for a substrate mimic in
each RNase monomer (Figure 1b, d) and in trans activation of wild-type Ire1KR32 by Ire1KR32(H1061N)

(Figure 2d) provide strong experimental support for an
individual catalytic center in each RNase monomer.
Position of the scissile phosphate and the catalytic
mechanism of Ire1 RNase

We deduce the position of the scissile phosphate of a
bona fide Ire1 RNA substrate in this catalytic center
using the structure of the Ire1KR32 complexed with a
DNA hexanucleotide, dCdCdGdCdAdG, which mimics
the cognate Ire1 substrate. This substrate analog was
chosen due to present experimental limitations imposed
by the inability of Ire1 to cocrystallize with other oligonucleotides. While we recognize that the deoxy-substituted single-stranded substrate may be structurally
distinct from RNA stem-loops, we surmise that its binding site on Ire1 represents that of the HP21 RNA
because (i) dCdCdGdCdAdG efficiently inhibits cleavage
of HP21 by Ire1KR32, and (ii) the electron density in
the RNase active site directly contacts the critical catalytic residue H1061, which is involved in proton transfer
and contributes ≥ 3 × 105-fold to catalysis. At high contour levels, we could identify three near-spherical peaks
in a Fo-Fc Fourier map. The central peak was strongest
and was visible in most Ire1 monomers in the asymmetric unit, while the other two peaks could be
observed in several but not all Ire1 monomers. Because
the central peak most likely represents the most-ordered
phosphate group of the oligonucleotide and is located
between the functionally validated catalytic residues
H1061 and Y1043 (Figures 2a and 3d), we suggest that
it corresponds to the position of the scissile phosphate
of the substrate.
Placement of this phosphate and comparison of the
active site of Ire1 with the active sites of RNase T1 and
A suggest putative roles of Ire1 residues in catalysis
(Figure 3a, b). Similar to Ire1, ribonucleases T1 and A
do not use metal ions [5] and produce 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate [21]. Importantly, the mechanisms of RNA cleavage have been established in detail for both RNase T1
and RNase A [20,22-24].
Structural comparison shows that Ire1 and RNases T1
and A have a single positively charged residue contacting the phosphate: R1056 (Ire1), R77 (RNase T1) and
K41 (RNase A). These positively charged residues serve
for catalysis by stabilizing the negative charge buildup
on non-bridging oxygens in the transition state, as has
been shown for RNase A [20]. By analogy, R1056 of Ire1
may also participate in transition state stabilization and
is unlikely to directly participate in proton transfer. The
last notion is supported by steric considerations: R1056phosphate-H1061 connectivity would form an atypically
acute angle for a general acid-phosphate-general base
triad, placing phosphate entirely off the line connecting
the two protein residues implicated in proton transfer

Page 11 of 15

(compare Figure 3a and 3b). This arrangement would
not be compatible with in-line geometry required for
RNA cleavage to form a 2’,3’-cyclic product.
In RNase T1 and RNase A, a single uncharged hydrophilic residue is positioned off the line connecting general acid, scissile phosphate and general base, and at a
hydrogen-bonding distance from the phosphate oxygens:
Y38 in RNase T1 and N11 in RNase A, respectively. In
RNases T1 and A, these residues play a catalytic role by
stabilizing the transition state via coordination of nonbridging oxygen [25]. Position of the electron density in
Ire1 (Figure 3b, right panel) predicts an analogous catalytic function for N1057.
Finally, all three RNases contain two residues that act
as a general acid/general base pair. For RNases T1 and
A, general acids are H92 and H119 at a distance of 3.7
and 3.8 Å from the scissile phosphate, respectively. General bases are H40 and H12 at a distance 5.6 Å and 3.8
Å, respectively. The position of the electron density for
the phosphate between the H1061 and Y1043 (Figure
3b) agrees with the role of these residues in Ire1 as the
general acid/general base pair (Figure 3c). Whereas the
role of H1061 parallels that of the histidines in RNase
T1 and A, a catalytic tyrosine is unusual because of the
high pKa of approximately 10. Experimental testing of
the catalytic role of Y1043 using an Y1043F mutation
revealed that the hydroxy group of Y1043 contributes a
rate enhancement of approximately tenfold (or approximately 1.4 kcal/mol) to catalysis. Our data therefore are
in agreement with the catalytic role of Y1043 and suggest two kinetically equivalent catalytic mechanisms
shown in Figure 3c. We note that the tenfold transitionstate effect of the Y1043F mutation is modest and thus
it could also be consistent with a third possibility that
the OH group of Y1043 plays an indirect role in catalysis and forms an important hydrogen-bonding network
in the active site rather than participates in proton
transfer directly. This alternative possibility cannot be
ruled out until an atomic resolution cocrystal structure
of an Ire1-RNA complex becomes available. If Y1043
serves for proton transfer directly, then its relatively
small catalytic contribution compared to the ≥ 3 × 105fold contribution of the partnering H1061 residue or the
103 to 104-fold contributions of the catalytic histidines
in RNase A or T1 [17,20] could be accounted for quantitatively by the 103 to 104 higher pKa of tyrosine compared to histidine.
While our data support the roles of the H1061 and
Y1043 as a general acid/general base catalytic pair, they
do not unambiguously define which residue serves as
the general acid or the general base. Such an assignment
has proven challenging for RNases and ribozymes, even
when high-resolution cocrystal structures with substrate
analogs or products were available [20,26]. At present,

Korennykh et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:47
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/47

we cannot formally distinguish between the two plausible mechanisms for RNA cleavage by Ire1 shown in Figure 3c. As we argue below, the scheme shown in the
left panel appears more compatible with steric considerations upon docking an RNA stem-loop in Ire1 RNase.
Our model suggests that the Ire1 RNase active site is
unique and does not superimpose with other structurally characterized RNases. However, the arrangement of
the catalytic residues in Ire1 and their interactions with
the scissile phosphate resemble those in the active sites
of ribonucleases T1 and A. By extension, we predict
that the same mechanism applies to mammalian Ire1
and RNase L, the Ire1 homologue involved in the interferon response pathway, in which all relevant residues
discussed here for Ire1 are strictly conserved.
A possible mechanism of stem-loop RNA recognition by
Ire1 RNase

The crystal structure of tRNAPhe (PDB ID 1ehz) shows
the stem-loop in a conformation that would preclude
cleavage by Ire1 (Figure 5c, yellow trace). The RNA cleavage reaction imposes strict stereochemical requirements
such that an incoming nucleophile can attack the phosphate in line with the leaving group. A similar stereochemical problem was encountered in studies of sarcin/ricin
GAGA tetraloop cleavage by ribonucleases a-sarcin and
restrictocin. A cocrystal structure of restrictocin with the
sarcin/ricin stem-loop RNA suggested that scissile bases
should undergo base flipping to position the incoming
2’OH in the 2’-endo conformation and to allow for inline attack during catalysis [27]. Guided by this concept,
we searched the PDB database for a tRNAPhe structure,
in which the loop guanosine at position 3 is flipped out
such that its ribose ring adopts the 2’-endo conformation.
We found that the crystal structure of tRNA Phe complexed with the tRNA modifying enzyme MiaA [28]
serves as a suitable model (Figure 5c, blue trace).
Accordingly, we used the stem-loop from the tRNAPhe
·MiaA structure for rigid-body docking into Ire1
active site. As a restraint, we placed the scissile phosphate into the strongest electron density peak (Figure
5d) and the rest of the loop to allow sterically permissible interactions expected from the cleavage mechanism
(I) in Figure 3c. The docked model has no backbone
intersections or clashes of backbone atoms. By contrast,
cleavage mechanism (II) could not be satisfied using this
docking approach due to seemingly irresolvable interchain clashes. The resulting model predicts that only
one stem-loop can bind to the Ire1 RNase dimer and
that one RNase domain in the dimer cleaves RNA,
whereas the other RNase monomer completes the RNAcontacting surface in trans, suggesting that both RNase
monomers and both HLEs participate in recognition of
the RNA stem-loop structure (Figure 5e).

Page 12 of 15

Our model that the HLE of one RNase monomer contributes to RNA cleavage by the catalytic center of a different RNase monomer is functionally supported by the
in trans complementation assay described above (Figure
4). This experiment demonstrates that cleavage by the
active site of an RNase monomer is impaired upon
removal of an RNA binding residue from an adjacent,
non-catalytic monomer. Therefore, although Ire1 RNase
has individual per-monomer catalytic centers, two
RNase monomers are involved in RNA cleavage and
apparently form a composite RNA binding surface created via dimerization. The high-order oligomerization of
Ire1 completes the active site by stabilizing the highly
dynamic HLE [5] in a conformation suitable for recognition of cognate RNA stem-loops. This mechanism could
explain how self-assembly of Ire1 into an oligomer activates the RNase function.
Ire1 cleavage of the tRNAPhe anticodon loop

We found that, strikingly, Ire1 can recognize and cleave
the anticodon stem/loop structure of tRNAPhe in addition to the cognate splice site stem-loops of HAC1 and
XBP1 mRNA. This observation redefines the known
substrate specificity of Ire1 and suggests that additional
stem-loops besides consensus sites in HAC1 and XBP1
mRNA could be cleaved by Ire1 RNase. Whether
tRNA Phe is an in vivo substrate of Ire1 remains to be
investigated. In principle, tRNA destruction could serve
to reduce the cell’s translational capacity and thereby
reduce protein influx into the ER, akin to protein
kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) activation in metazoan
cells. However, the scissile guanine in the anticodon of
tRNAPhe carries a post-transcriptional 2’-methoxy modification [29], which precludes cleavage of the modified
tRNAPhe pool by any RNase producing 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate, such as Ire1, leaving only the unmodified pool as
a possible substrate. It is tempting to speculate that the
tRNA modification evolved to protect tRNA Phe from
cleavage by Ire1 and that regulation of the methylated
pool of tRNAPhe could provide a control point by which
Ire1 may affect the translational capacity of cells.

Conclusions
We investigated the mechanism of RNA cleavage by
Ire1 RNase by combining computational, structural and
quantitative biochemical approaches. This work experimentally determined the location of the catalytic center
in Ire1 RNase and converged on a model of docking
and cleavage of cognate RNA stem-loops. Histidine
H1061 was defined as a key catalytic residue that is
required in single copy in the twofold symmetric active
site of the Ire1 RNase. Presented here in trans mutagenesis studies using (R1039A) and (R1039A, H1061N) Ire1
mutants, as well as electron density-guided in silico

contained ≤ 1 pM radioactively (32P) labeled RNA and
were conducted under single-turnover conditions
(except for measurements of kcat and Km on Additional
file 1, Figure S1, which were conducted under multipleturnover conditions). Unless noted otherwise, Ire1 concentration was 3 μM. The enzyme concentration was
determined from Ire1KR32 sequence using absorbance
at 280 nm (e280 = 40.8 × 103 M/cm was calculated with
BiochemLabSolutions ELN software, Princeton, NJ).
Reactions were quenched at time intervals with 6 μl
stop solution containing 10 M urea, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM
ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA), 0.05% xylene
cyanol and 0.05% bromophenol blue. Samples were analyzed by 10% to 20% PAGE, gels were scanned using
Typhoon (Molecular Dynamics-GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) and quantified using ImageQuant (Molecular
Dynamics-GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) and GelQuant.NET (BiochemLabSolutions, Princeton, NJ) programs. The data were plotted and fit in SigmaPlot to
exponential curves to determine observed rate constants
and to hyperbolic curves to determine binding
constants.

Ire1 expression and purification

Ire1 oligomerization assay

Ire1KR32 and its mutants were expressed as GST fusion
proteins using pGEX-6P-2 plasmid (GE Healthcare,
Waukesha, WI) and codon-compensated Escherichia coli
(BL21-CodonPlus RIPL) (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA).
Expression was performed at room temperature for 4 h
after IPTG induction. Cells were lysed using an Emulsiflex C-3 (Avestin Inc. Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) and
proteins purified by affinity purification with subsequent
cleavage of the GST tag by Prescission protease (GE
Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). All protein mutants were
fractionated by gel filtration on an S200 column to
approximately 99% purity. Proteins stocks (10-20 mg/
ml) were stored at -80°C in the presence of 5% glycerol.

Ire1 was in the reaction buffer containing 20 mM
HEPES (pH 7.4), 70 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM
ADP, 4 mM DTT and 5% glycerol. Transparency of the
samples containing higher concentrations of Ire1 visibly
changed immediately upon adding the enzyme. Samples
were allowed to sit for 15 min to allow for a complete
Ire1 oligomerization. The optical density of the samples
was subsequently measured at room temperature (22°C),
at 500 nm on a UV-visible spectrophotometer Ultrospec
3300 Pro (Amersham-GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI).
OD500 was obtained after subtraction of baseline absorbance from the buffer free of Ire1. Sample absorbance
did not change upon repeated scans of the same sample,
indicating that the oligomerization reaches equilibrium
under the conditions of the experiments.

docking of an RNA hairpin with the scissile bond correctly aligned for catalysis suggest that the HLEs of two
Ire1 monomers participate in stem-loop binding. This
model intuitively predicts that only one RNA stem-loop
binds to the dimer of Ire1 at a time (Figure 5e) whereas
the high-order oligomerization of Ire1 enhances RNA
recognition via allosteric stabilization of the HLE [5].
These findings identify the link between oligomerization
of Ire1 and recognition of cognate RNA stem-loops,
providing a glimpse of the central event in Ire1
signaling.

Methods
Experimental errors

RNA substrates

RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon
(Lafayette, CO), labeled at the 5’-terminus using T4
polynucleotide kinase and 32P-ATP (PerkinElmer, Waltham MA) and purified by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) that allowed a single-nucleotide
resolution, as described previously [5].
Ire1 RNase cleavage assay

Kinetics of RNA cleavage was conducted as described
previously [5]. Typically, reactions were carried out in
10 μl volume at 30°C. Reactions were started by adding
1 μl of 32P-labeled RNA to 9 μl of premixture containing 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 7.4, 70 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 4
mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 5% glycerol. The reactions

Ire1·(dCdCdGdCdAdG) complex crystallization

Ire1·(dCdCdGdCdAdG) complex was prepared by mixing Ire1KR32 and dCdCdGdCdAdG (IDT). When performed at relatively low NaCl concentration (300 mM
or less) addition of the oligonucleotide causes profound
precipitation of the oligomeric complex, as observed
upon addition of ADP·Mg [5]. The oligonucleotide thus
apparently promoted formation of Ire1KR32 oligomers
analogous to ADP·Mg and to APY29. The precipitate
readily redissolved upon slight increase in NaCl concentration, indicating that the oligomerization reaction was
salt dependent and readily reversible. Crystallization was
conducted in hanging drops using stock solution of premade complex containing Ire1KR32 (12 mg/ml) and 0.6

mM 2’-deoxy-CCGCAG. The well solution contained
0.12 M sodium citrate (pH 6.5), 7% polyethylene glycol
(PEG) 3350 and 4% glucose. Single crystals grew overnight and were cryoprotected in well solution containing
25% ethylene glycol. The crystals belong to orthorhombic space group C222 distinct from the orthorhombic
space group P2 1 21 2 previously reported for Ire1KR32
oligomer with bound APY29. Crystallization of a variety
of other nucleotides and protein constructs was also
tested but produced either inferior crystals or no
crystals.
Diffraction from Ire1·(2’-deoxy-CCGCAG) crystals was
collected on Beam Line BL 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light
Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA), at an X-ray wavelength of 1.115872 Å and an
oscillation angle of 1°. The data were indexed, integrated
and scaled using the XDS package [30] (Additional file
1, Table S1, Figure S5). A total of 5% of the reflections
were marked as a test set (Rfree). A molecular replacement solution was found using PHASER [31] starting
from monomer C of PDB ID 3fbv as a search model.
Seven copies of monomer C were found in the asymmetric unit and the resulting 7-mer of Ire1KR32 was
used for rigid body refinement in Phenix [32]. Simulated
annealing was attempted and, expectedly, resulted in
deterioration of statistics and excessive separation
between R work and R free (Additional file 1, Table S1).
Simulated annealing was therefore used only for calculation of omit maps (2000°C). Fourier sA-weighted [33]
Fobs-Fcalc difference maps were used for interpretation of
the parts of the model missing from the starting structure. Electron density and structure were analyzed and
graphed in Coot [34] and PyMol (Schrödinger, SanDiego, CA). The sevenfold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) of the model was used to considerably
increase quality of the electron density maps by averaging. However, all elements of Ire1 secondary structure
were clearly visible without NCS. Coordinates have been
deposited with the Protein Data Bank http://www.rcsb.
org/ under accession number 3SDM.
Crystallization of Ire1KR32(H1061N) oligomer

The H1061N mutant was crystallized and analyzed as
described for the 3.2-Å structure of Ire1 [5]. Diffraction
data were collected on the beamline 8.3.1 at the
Advanced Light Source (ALS, Berkeley, CA) using wavelength 1.115879 Å. A total of 5% of reflections were
marked as test set. The 3.2-Å structure [5] was used for
molecular replacement. The H1061N mutation was
introduced in Coot [34] prior to refinement. Rigid-body
refinement and subsequent simulated annealing refinement (starting temperature 3200 K) using 14-fold noncrystallographic symmetry were performed in Phenix
[32] (Additional file 1, Table S3). The resulting crystal

Page 14 of 15

structure had a good stereochemistry and no residues in
disallowed regions on the Ramachandran plot. In order
to reduce model bias, we also calculated an omit difference map from a model refined at 3200 K without the
use of NCS restraints, from which a whole a-helix containing the H1061N residue was omitted prior to refinement. The resulting electron density clearly shows that
the conformation of the H1061N mutant is identical to
that of wild-type Ire1. Coordinates have been deposited
with the Protein Data Bank http://www.rcsb.org/ under
accession number 3SDJ.
