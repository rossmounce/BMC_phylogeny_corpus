Molecular adaptation in flowering and symbiotic
recognition pathways: insights from patterns of
polymorphism in the legume Medicago truncatula

Abstract
Background: We studied patterns of molecular adaptation in the wild Mediterranean legume Medicago truncatula.
We focused on two phenotypic traits that are not functionally linked: flowering time and perception of symbiotic
microbes. Phenology is an important fitness component, especially for annual plants, and many instances of
molecular adaptation have been reported for genes involved in flowering pathways. While perception of symbiotic
microbes is also integral to adaptation in many plant species, very few reports of molecular adaptation exist for
symbiotic genes. Here we used data from 57 individuals and 53 gene fragments to quantify the overall strength of
both positive and purifying selection in M. truncatula and asked if footprints of positive selection can be detected
at key genes of rhizobia recognition pathways.
Results: We examined nucleotide variation among 57 accessions from natural populations in 53 gene fragments: 5
genes involved in nitrogen-fixing bacteria recognition, 11 genes involved in flowering, and 37 genes used as
control loci. We detected 1757 polymorphic sites yielding an average nucleotide diversity (pi) of 0.003 per site.
Non-synonymous variation is under sizable purifying selection with 90% of amino-acid changing mutations being
strongly selected against. Accessions were structured in two groups consistent with geographical origins. Each of
these two groups harboured an excess of rare alleles, relative to expectations of a constant-sized population,
suggesting recent population expansion. Using coalescent simulations and an approximate Bayesian computation
framework we detected several instances of genes departing from selective neutrality within each group and
showed that the polymorphism of two nodulation and four flowering genes has probably been shaped by recent
positive selection.
Conclusion: We quantify the intensity of purifying selection in the M. truncatula genome and show that putative
footprints of natural selection can be detected at different time scales in both flowering and symbiotic pathways.

Background
Understanding the mechanisms underlying adaptation of
species to their environment is central to population
and evolutionary biology. Recent advances in large-scale
sequencing and genotyping now allow rapid characterization of molecular diversity in a set of local populations
or across an entire species range but reliably identifying
the molecular footprints of adaptation remains challenging [1,2]. Two analytical approaches can be used to
identify sequences genes whose evolution has been driven by environment-specific selection. One avenue is to

search for genomic regions exhibiting an excess of differentiation between populations, typically using FST as
a test statistic [3,4]. This approach is most likely to be
successful when used in conjunction with a set of populations spanning a clear environmental gradient [5-7]
Barring a clear environmental gradient, one can still use
allele(s) frequency information, the so-called site frequency spectrum (SFS), often summarized by a unique
statistic such as Tajima’s D to detect departure from
selective neutrality [8]. These two methods are based on
different aspects of polymorphism data, and thus are
expected to be complementary to one another. Moreover, combining the methods may allow for the detection of different forms of selection (i.e. local adaptation

and uniform directional selection through a species
range) or increasing power to detect more complex
selection histories, for example a selective sweep within
a single population that can drive an excess of differentiation merely by reducing the level of intra-population
diversity. Although genome-wide study of molecular
variation and scan for footprints of selection are now
routinely reported in major genetical models, candidate
gene-centred studies allow for testing of specific hypothesis regarding the evolutionary history of specific functional categories of genes [9].
For plants, timing of flowering is an essential component of fitness. Flowering can be influenced by a variety
of climatic factors such as day length, average temperature and drought stress. Accordingly numerous
instances of molecular adaptation have been reported
for flowering genes, particularly in the annual model
plant Arabidopsis thaliana [10-13]. The ability of a
plant to engage in successful biotic interactions is also
integral to fitness. Although numerous work documents
the strong imprint of natural selection on plant genes
encoding perception of pathogens (so called R genes),
both in A thaliana but also a suite of other plant species
[14-16], much less is known on genes encoding the perception of beneficial (symbiotic) partners. The relative
paucity of studies might be explained by the fact that
the plant model A. thaliana does not engage in symbiosis with any of the two major plant-microorganism symbioses: the ancient and widespread association with
mycorrhizae and the more specialized symbiosis with
rhizobia.
The barrel medic Medicago truncatula is a model
legume species used for dissecting the genetics of
legume-rhizobia and plant-mycorhizae interactions. Its
natural habitat spans the Mediterranean basin. It is an
annual selfer found in ecologically unstable populations,
resulting in large rates of genetic drift within and
among populations [17,18]. For these reasons the efficacy of natural selection to drive adaptive changes is
likely to be challenged by genetic drift and population
structure.
In this study we examined signatures of natural selection in several genes of two functionally important and
largely independent signalling pathways: the flowering
and symbiotic pathways in M. truncatula. To do this,
we surveyed patterns of naturally occurring diversity at
the species level for a set of genes in each pathway and
a set of control genes. We first quantified the strength
of purifying selection in M. truncatula and the relative
importance of positive selection in genes from both
pathways and a set of independent control genes. We
then examined broad patterns of genetic subdivision in
our sample and split our sample in two ancestral
groups. Accordingly, we model demographic factors that

Page 2 of 13

influence coalescent history and contemporary levels
and patterns of diversity within each group [2]. The
rationale for doing so is that strong substructure can
blur inference of non-neutral evolution [19]. Finally we
searched for signatures of natural selection based on the
estimated large-scale population structure, within both
ancestral groups with the objective of tracking signatures of selective sweeps in candidate genes.

Methods
Plant material

A panel of 57 Medicago truncatula genotypes (hereafter
accessions) consisting of naturally occurring inbred lines
sampled from throughout the species range was chosen
to represent the species level and a regional level. At the
species level, we used a core collection containing 32
accessions, that was previously defined to represent the
geographic distribution of the species and to maximize
allelic variation at 13 SSR loci initially investigated on a
sample of 347 accessions [20]. To investigate genetic
diversity at a smaller spatial scale, 25 accessions belonging to a more homogeneous genetic group (as inferred
through microsatellite genotyping) were included in the
panel. Most of these accessions were initially collected
in the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco. The list of accessions used is listed in Additional file 1, Table S1 and
their geographic origin depicted in Figure 1. Five other
Medicago species were included as potential outgroups
(one accession per species): M. tornata, M. rigidula, M.
rigiduloides, M. arabica, and M. marina. Unless noted
otherwise, all accessions were collected in natural populations and self-fertilized two generations before being
grown for DNA extraction.
Amplification and sequencing

We used data from 37 genic fragments that we PCR
amplified and sequenced to model the demographic
history of our sample (see below). Primers to amplify
these fragments were chosen from two sources [21,22]
and within the set of primers available, we selected primers that amplify relatively long fragments (Additional
file 2, Table S2). Fragments typically consisted of
exon-bound primers spanning one or more introns.
The fragment length ranged from 287 to 8897 with a
mean of 1644 (Additional file 3, Table S3) and all PCR
products were sequenced directly. Protocols for DNA
extraction, PCR amplification, fragments purification
and Sanger sequencing were identical to those
described in De Mita et al. [23].
Nodulation gene fragments are located in 5 genes:
DMI1, DMI3, NIN, NFP, PG3, involved in the Nod factor perception pathway [24]. Primers used for PCR
amplification and subsequent sequencing were identical
to the ones described in De Mita et al. [23]. Flowering

gene fragments are located in the following genes: COL
(Constans-Like), FCA2, FRLa, FTLa, FTLb, FTLc, Soc1b,
VRN, PHYa, PHYb, PHYe, which are involved in the signalling pathway controlling day length perception, circadian clock and flowering inception [25]. Two gene
fragments, FCA2 and Soc1b, were amplified from cDNA.
For these, total RNA was extracted from fresh leaves
using TRI REAGENT™ (T9424, Sigma®) buffer and the
Reverse Transcription System kit from Promega ® .
Sequences of primers used for PCR amplification and
sequencing are available available in Additional file 2,
Table S2.
For all gene fragments, sequence reads base calling
and annotation were performed manually using Pregap4
and Gap4 programs of the Staden software version 1.6
[26]. Annotation was retrieved either from reference
gene sequences when available or from Gene Index
Tentative Contigs [27] exhibiting an exact match. All
sequences are deposited in Genbank (HQ735420 HQ738281) and alignments are available from the
authors in the Dryad archive (see Availability of supporting data).
Analysis of patterns of polymorphism and divergence

Analyses of polymorphism were performed using customized scripts in Python and the SeqLib library version
1.6 (S. De Mita and M. Siol, unpublished) incorporating
Bio++ version 1.9 [28]. Sequences spanning less than
25% of the length of the longest sequence of the alignment (ignoring all undefined or missing data) were
removed. This threshold was raised to 60% for the analysis of synonymous/non-synonymous variation. The M.

tornata sequence was used as outgroup unless the M.
tornata sequence was less than 75% of the length of the
longest sequence. In these cases, the longest sequence
from the other outgroup species was used (see Additional file 3, Table S3). For polymorphism analysis concerning synonymous/non-synonymous variation,
estimation of the recombination rate and haplotype analysis, all sites with at least one undefined or missing
nucleotide position were excluded. For all other statistics, sites with at least 70% defined data were used.
Counts of the number of sites exhibiting polymorphism and divergence within each gene fragment were
used to study the relative roles of positive and purifying
selection in shaping polymorphism and divergence in
the coding regions. We followed the approach implemented by Welch [29] and recently extended by Obbard
et al. [9] to infer the fraction 1-f of mutation under
strong purifying selection and the proportion a of nonsynonymous nucleotide divergence driven by positive
selection. We used a series of nested models of increasing complexity ranging from the simplistic pure neutrality (f = 1, a = 0) to models incorporating a variable
intensity of positive or purifying selection (f and a are
allowed to vary according to each gene category). Estimation of parameters for each gene or category of gene
was made using the software MK_test [29]. We used
Akaike’s Information Criterion (hereafter AIC) to compare models, as suggested by Welch [29]. When models
differed by less than 5 AIC units, we used an averaging
procedure to obtain robust estimates of a’s and f’s parameters. Briefly, we computed a model-averaged estimate
of a’s (and f’s) as the weighted average of the individual

De Mita et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:229
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/229

estimates obtained under each model and used the differences in AIC of each competing model for weighting
[30].
Population structure analysis

We used the Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented
in InStruct [31] to analyse population structure. InStruct
uses multilocus genotype to assign portions of individual
genomes to a predetermined number (K) of clusters and
can account for the likely presence of inbreeding within
clusters (given the selfing rate of M. truncatula). We
used all polymorphic sites detected on control loci. Each
site was considered as a single locus and we used a haploid setting. We ran Instruct, using Mode 1, which
infers population structure only (no inference on the
selfing rate) and assumes that admixture is possible
between groups. For each run, we used a burn-in period
of 5 × 105 iterations and then 106 iterations for estimating the parameters. Five independent chains were runs
for each of 5 K values, K = 1 to K = 5. For each run,
individual accessions were assigned into a group according to their highest proportion of membership into this
group. The clusters thus defined were compared among
runs for each K value and the best fitting K was chosen
using the ΔK method of Falush et al. [32]. The fraction
of the observed genetic variation explained by the
inferred clusters was measured by the FST parameter as
implemented for nucleotide sequence data [33]. The
stratification obtained for K = 2 appeared as the most
robust one (see results) and was used in neutrality tests.
Frequency spectrum neutrality test

We used patterns of polymorphism within each group
to detect instances of selection causing departure from
the neutral frequency spectrum. To do so we devised a
test combining two neutrality test statistics relying on
the underlying frequency spectrum: Tajima’s D [8] and
the standardized version of Fay and Wu’s H [34,35]
which we call Z. In order to obtain the joint distribution
of these statistics under the hypothesis of selective neutrality while accounting for demographic history in each
group, we followed the strategy used in De Mita et al.
[23] and fitted population expansion models in each of
the two groups. The procedure was repeated independently for each group and a different scaled mutation
rate and rate of expansion were assumed for each
group. We used an Approximate Bayesian framework
[36] as implemented in the Python SeqLib library to
obtain the joint posterior distribution for parameters.
We used the frequency of four minor allele frequency
categories (0.125, 0.25, 0.375 and 0.5) as summary statistics of the data in each group. Then we approximated
the joint posterior with 107 coalescent simulations and
using local-linear regression on tan-transformed data

Page 4 of 13

with a tolerance factor of 10-3. The posterior joint distribution (scaled mutation rate and exponential population
growth rate) was binned using 5184 evenly distributed
bins over both dimensions. This posterior distribution
was then used to obtain - through 10 6 independent
simulations (by sampling a mutation and expansion rate
to parametrize each coalescent simulation) - the distribution of D and Z expected at each locus. Note that
locus specific sample size and alignment length were
used in these simulations. A probability of misorientation of sites of 0.00936 was estimated from control loci
[37] and incorporated in the simulations used to obtain
the null distribution of (D, Z) at each locus. This was
done by randomly switching the orientation (ancestral
versus derived) of alleles after each coalescent simulation stage. This additional twist is an effective way to
guard false positives, i.e. low p-values at locus evolving
neutrally but where SNP misorientation is inflating Z.
The (D, Z) distribution was discretized over 576 categories and the p-value of the bin containing the
observed (D, Z) value of each locus in our data was
computed.
Evolutionary analysis of nucleotide substitution patterns

Patterns of between-species substitutions of DMI1, a
gene previously identified as candidate for adaptation
[23], were also analysed. To do this we sequenced most
of the protein-coding sequence of DMI1 (same default
protocol) in nine additional Medicago species (M.
ciliaris [L0897E], M. laciniata [L0904E], M. noeana
[L0908E], M. polymorpha [L0911E], M. orbicularis
[L0913E], M. sauvagei [L0928D], M. carstiensis
[LCarsX], M. coerulea [LCoerX], M. ruthenica [LRuth])
as well as previously cited M. tornata, M. ciliaris, M.
rigidula, M. rigiduloides, M. marina and the L0736D
accession from M. truncatula. In addition, we included
the reference sequence M. truncatula Jemalong A17
from the literature (DMI1 mRNA sequence available as
Genbank accession number AY497771).
Sequences were aligned at the protein level using
MUSCLE version 3.8.31 with default options [38] with
minor manual corrections to eliminate spurious amino
acid replacements generated by the alignment procedure. For the same reason, the region spanning position
316 to 382 in the coding DNA sequence alignment
(positions 280-303 in AY497771) consisting of gaps and
poorly aligned sequences were removed. A molecular
phylogeny was built with PhyML version 3.0 [39] using
coding and protein sequences. We used the most conservative option of using the protein-based tree for
further analysis as it minimizes the number of assumed
amino acid changes. Using this phylogeny, we applied
tests of positive selection based on codon-based substitution models [40] implemented in PAML version 4.2

De Mita et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:229

[41]. The tests M2a versus M1a and M8 versus M8a
yielded identical results and we report the first comparison only. We applied the test as recommended in
PAML documentation and identified positively selected
sites using a Bayes Empirical Bayes procedure.

Results
Levels of nucleotide variation in Medicago truncatula

We surveyed nucleotide diversity within M. truncatula
by re-sequencing 53 gene fragments (37 control loci, 11
flowering-related and 5 nodulation-related). A total of
100,178 nucleotides were re-sequenced of which 74,233
were included in statistical analyses (after excluding sites
with excessive missing data or alignment gaps). Gene
fragments were sequenced in 57 M. truncatula accessions representing the whole-species diversity and in
one outgroup. Overall M. truncatula is characterized by
a fairly low level of nucleotide diversity at the specieswide level as measured through the scaled mutation rate
(mean Watterson’s θ = 0.0044 per base pair (bp-1) and
mean nucleotide diversity is π = 0.0034, see Table 1),
but in the range of studies surveying species with similar
mating system: species-wide samples in Arabidopsis
thaliana (θw ≃ 0.008 and π ≃ 0.006 [42]), in wild rice
(0.0037 in Oryiza rufipogon [43]), and the self fertilizing
worm C. elegans (π = 0.003 for silent polymorphism
[44]) or within autogamous populations of Eichornia
paniculata (π = 0.0008 [45]). Levels of nucleotide variation for control and candidate genes fragments are virtually identical (Figure 2). One notable exception is the
nodulation gene DMI3 that exhibits very high levels of
polymorphism (Table 1 and Additional file 4, Table S4).

Beyond average levels of polymorphism, we document
a rather large variance in the scaled mutation rates as θ
estimates span two orders of magnitude (from less than
0.0005 bp-1 at LEG722, where no segregating sites were
observed over 500 bp, to 0.02051 bp-1 at LAX4 and 272
observed segregating sites over 8900 kb).
Overall, values for Tajima’s D statistic in the whole sample vary widely but are generally skewed towards negative
values (minimum -2.60, maximum 1.05, average -0.79,
median -0.89). Candidate gene fragments and control fragment distributions are largely overlapping (Figure 2).
The strength of purifying selection and adaptive
evolution in Medicago truncatula

Next, we estimated the fraction 1-f of amino acid changing mutation undergoing strong purifying selection and
the proportion a of non-synonymous divergence
between M truncatula and our outgroup (M. tornata)
that can be attributed to positive selection. We used 5
competing models - with varying amounts of purifying
and positive selection - and their relative fit is summarized in Table 2. Model M0, which posits strict neutrality, fits the data poorly and was not considered further.
Model comparison using differences in AIC provides
suggestive evidence that, despite low level of polymorphism compatible with a rather small long-term effective
size, a substantial amount of purifying selection constrains amino acid changing polymorphism. On average,
about 90% of amino acid-changing mutations are
removed by strong purifying selection. This is as strong
or stronger than what has been reported for A. thaliana
where 66% of amino-acid changing mutation where
strongly deleterious [46].
The estimated level of adaptive evolution is high (a ≃
0.25) but there is a very large sampling variance and this
estimate is not statistically significant from zero (likelihood ratio test comparing M2 versus M4 = 3.2, p = 0.07).
Last, we asked if a model (M5) positing that different
types of gene fragments experienced different level of
adaptive substitution improved the fit of the data. Comparison with a model with homogeneous level of adaptive
substitutions (M4) suggests that flowering genes may
experience more adaptive substitution (a = 0.37) and
that symbiotic genes experience fewer substitution (a =
-0.04) but again sampling variance around the estimates
of a for each category of genes is very large and the
model M5 overall fits poorly the data relative to a more
parsimonious one (M4). We thus choose to report more
robust model averaged estimates of f and a in Table 2.
Broad patterns of genetic subdivision in Medicago
truncatula

We studied broad patterns of genetic subdivision in our
sample and inferred stratification in K groups within

our species-wide sample. We used values of K ranging
between 1 and 5. Consistent estimates of log-likelihood
and stratification patterns were obtained for all K values.
Posterior probabilities of the data always increased with
increasing subdivision (i.e. higher K); the highest gain
occurring between K = 1 and K = 2 and between K = 2
and K = 3 (Additional file 5, Figure S1).

At K = 2, the inferred structure was stable across runs,
geographically consistent, and in agreement with a previous structure inferred on the basis of SSR variation in
a set of 13 microsatellite loci on a much larger sample
(n = 347) of accessions [20]. This stratification splits our
species-wide sample into a group of 32 accessions originating from the South-West of the Mediterranean basin

and a group of 25 accessions originating from a broad
Eastern part of the Mediterranean basin (Figure 1).
Except for three accessions (L00213, L00368 and
L00401), all the accessions in this study were assigned
to the same group as when using SSR data. This stratification accounted for 17% of the total genetic variability
in our data. At K = 3, independent runs were also consistent, but the stratification obtained was not geographically consistent, splitting the two groups defined at K
= 2 with no clear pattern (Additional file 6, Figure S2).
This stratification also explained less genetic variability
than K = 2. For K = 4, the stratification was the same as
that obtained with K = 3 except for one individual
(L00213) which constituted alone the fourth group. At
K = 5, most accessions appeared admixed, i.e. showing
proportions of membership into each of the 5 clusters
lower than 0.3 or 0.4.
Given the geographic consistency of the subdivision
obtained at K = 2 and the congruence of this subdivision
with that obtained using SSR loci, we choose to use K = 2
as the subdivision pattern for further analyses. Note that
this analysis is by no means intended to infer the actual
number of populations underlying our sample but merely
a way to group accessions in fairly homogeneous groups.
The two groups show relatively similar levels and patterns of nucleotide variation (Table 1) despite the lower
geographic area covered by the Western group (referred
as group 2). Both groups also exhibit negative Tajima’s D
values, suggesting recent events of population expansion
occurred in both groups (see Additional file 7, Table S5
for details on diversity statistics per fragment).

The frequency spectrum at several flowering genes
departs from neutrality and suggests recent or ongoing
selection

To determine if patterns of polymorphism departed
from selective neutrality we combined two statistics, D
and Z, summarizing the frequency spectrum. This level
of analysis strikes a compromise between retaining high
enough polymorphism while using a sample for which
we can model patterns of polymorphism (in order to
obtain null distributions for neutrality test statistics).
Our approach builds on previous work showing that a
scenario assuming a single population with exponential
growth, although simplistic, can adequately capture patterns of polymorphism in control gene fragments [23].
We mapped the observed values (D, Z) of each gene fragment on the joint density of (D, Z) expected under selective
neutrality while accounting for the demographic history of
each group (see methods for details). A graphical summary
of our results is presented in Figure 3 (p-values are in Additional file 8, Table S6). P-values of the joint test (D, Z)
obtained in the two groups exhibit virtually no correlation
(observed correlation of 0.12 across n = 46 loci, p > 0.4).
Empirical distribution of p-values at control loci was also
slightly L-shaped (not shown), suggesting that despite our
efforts to account for the coalescent history of our sample,
our test is still probably slightly too liberal so that p-values
should be interpreted with caution. Among the 16 surveyed
candidate genes, observed patterns of nucleotide diversity
(as summarized by values of D and Z) fall outside the simulated neutral distribution for 7 fragments: FRLa and DMI3
exhibit Z values in both groups that are larger than

Figure 3 Tests of selective neutrality of polymorphism within each group. The joint distributions of (D, Z) tests statistics expected under
neutrality in the Eastern group (group 1, panel 3a) and the Western group (group 2, panel 3b) are plotted using a blue shading for the
probability density. Symbiotic genes are plotted as green dots and flowering genes as orange dots using each candidate gene abbreviation.
Control loci are represented as black dots. The joint distribution for (D, Z) within each group was obtained through 105 coalescent simulations
from models parametrized to fit patterns of polymorphisms in the set of controlled fragments (See Methods for further details). Note that in
order to generate a unique graphical representation of the neutral joint distribution, simulations for each of the 53 loci were pooled and the
resulting (D, Z) distribution was binned using 104 categories (rigorous p-values computed using null distributions tailored for each locus length
and polymorphism are available in Additional file 7, Table S5).

expected under neutrality, FTLb and PHYa exhibit too
negative Z values in the Western group 2, VRN and PHYe
exhibit too negative D values in the (Western) group 2, and
NIN exhibits a negative Z value in the Eastern group (group
1). Several loci - including control loci - exhibited low pvalues and inspection of the (D, Z) coordinates reveals loci
with abnormally high values of Z but typical values of D.
Negative values of Z sign an excess of high-frequency
derived mutations, which can be interpreted as hitch-hiking
episodes driven by recent selection. In contrast, occurrence
of positive Z values (deficit of high-frequency derived mutations) cannot be explained by natural selection in any
straightforward manner. Notably, genes displaying high
values of Z often exhibit the highest diversity indices (sometimes by orders of magnitude compared to other genes). Z,
unlike D, might be sensitive to variations in mutation rate.
Even worse, Z is very sensitive to variation of gene genealogy structure, as deep genealogies might pre-date the divergence with outgroups and drive spuriously high values of Z.
As a result, we chose not to report as departing from neutrality loci exhibiting a very high value of Z and a high
diversity, as for these an artefact due to high mutation rate
seems likely (see below how sensitivity of Z in the [D, Z]
test could be addressed).
Barring such cases, this method detected footprints of
selection in four genes potentially involved in flowering
date (FTLb, PHYa, VRN and PHYe) and one symbiotic
gene (NIN). The gene FTLb displayed in the Western
group a very negative Z value compared to neutral expectations, suggesting positive selection on this gene while
PHYa exhibited a negative Z value but also a strikingly
large D value in this group, as expected under diversifying
selection or local adaptation. Both VRN and PHYe, displayed very negative D values as expected under

directional selection. For these two genes, however, the
deviations from expected values were less important
resulting in larger p-values (p = 0.025 and 0.023 respectively compared to 0.0066 for FTLb and 0.0006 for PHYa).
NIN exhibited a negative Z value as expected under positive selection in the Eastern group only (p = 0.019).
Evidence for selection in DMI1

DMI1 was the only nodulation candidate detected in a
previous analysis [23] but is not singled out in the current application of the (D-Z) test. However several SNPs
located in exon 6 of DMI1 exhibited an excess of differentiation. The analysis of local variation of patterns of
polymorphism shows interesting features (Figure 4),
although challenging to interpret. The strikingly contrasted pattern of differentiation and Tajima’s D might
explain why this gene could not be detected using genewise summaries of polymorphism and suggest that
selection occurred in the gene (see the Discussion section for possible interpretations). Codon evolution analysis strongly supports the hypothesis that several sites
in DMI1 evolved under positive selection in the history
of the Medicago genus. A model allowing for positive
selection on a fraction of the sites (M2a) fitted much
better the data than a model (M1a) with no sites under
positive selection (likelihood ratio test, p = 0.016). The
location of the sites that are very likely to have evolved
under positive selection is represented in Figure 4.

Discussion
M. truncatula nucleotide polymorphism is shaped
primarily by purifying selection

The species-wide levels of nucleotide polymorphism
we report here are in the lower range of plant studies

Figure 4 Sliding window analysis of the gene DMI1. Polymorphism was analysed in 500 nucleotide-long windows with 50 nucleotide steps
along the alignments. Displayed statistics are: S, the number of polymorphic sites per window, non-synonymous polymorphism given by
Watterson’s θ per non-synonymous site, FST given by Weir and Cockerham’s estimator [59] and Tajima’s D computed in both groups. The grey
frames denote the positions of exons and the arrowheads mark the position of the sites found with high posterior probability (> 0.95) to be
targets of positive selection in the Medicago genus.

which is consistent with the expectation that selfing
plant species harbour less nucleotide diversity than
outcrossing species [47]. Note however that although
mating system was the variable explaining most of the
variation in polymorphism across plant species, the
portion of the total variance in nucleotide diversity
accounted by mating system alone is rather modest
(less than 10% after phylogenetic relatedness is
accounted for). Levels of polymorphism in M. truncatula thus lie in the low range although these are by no
mean as extreme as the striking instance of some selffertilizing species - Capsella rubella that recently
evolved from the outcrossing Capsella grandiflora which only displays one to two haplotypes throughout
its species range [48,49]. We also report fairly strong
purifying selection removing up to 85% of all nonsynonymous (amino acid changing) mutations and
marginal evidence for heterogeneity in the amount of
purifying selection and positive selection among gene
categories. Although the evidence for positive selection

on flowering genes obtained by contrasting polymorphism and divergence (Table 2) is suggestive and also
consistent with evidence obtained on a different time
scale using the (D, Z) test, estimates of a should be
viewed as preliminary for two reasons. First, a estimates are inherently noisy [9] and data on many more
genes for each category would be needed to reduce
sampling variance around estimates. Second demography is expected to affect the estimation of both f and
a [29].
Model-based tests of selection

Instead of relying on non-parametric methods for
detecting outliers suggestive of selection, we employed
model-based methods. These rely on first fitting patterns of nucleotide variation at a set of control loci as a
means of parametrizing a model positing selective neutrality and the most salient features of the demographic
history that may be responsible for the patterns of
nucleotide diversity in our sample. We discussed below

De Mita et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:229
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/229

insights provided by these approaches but also their
limits.
Some loci, including controls, displayed large values for
Fay and Wu’s standardized H statistic (Z) that were
strongly unlikely under our model. These genes also
ranked among those with the highest per-site
Watterson’sθ. While D is virtually insensitive to levels of
polymorphism, Z and even more the non-standardized H
statistic are dramatically so. Allowing for variation of the
mutation rate among genes would make the (D, Z) test
more robust. One option is to constrain θ to be proportional to an independent estimate of mutation rates or a
proxy such as interspecific synonymous nucleotide divergence. The outgroups we used were however too close in terms of absolute amount of divergence to our sample
- for this purpose, yielding putatively very noisy estimates
for mutation rates that would exacerbate rather than fix
the problem. At the cost of extra parameters, the variation of θ among genes could be treated as a hidden statistical parameter (such as the variance of a statistical
distribution) to be estimated.
Our model for patterns of polymorphism within group,
by ignoring gene flow between geographic regions comprising each group of accessions, underestimates the variance in coalescence times underlying amounts of
polymorphism. Thus loci with neutral polymorphism but
high θ and in turn possibly high Z values were picked as
departing from neutrality. A more sophisticated model
would treat both populations jointly but addressing this
would require a flexible yet computationally tractable
population structure component for coalescence models.
That remains a theoretical challenge.
We observed a broad population structure (K = 2) consistent with previous analysis of SSR data [20] which, in
the absence of obvious barrier to gene flow, seems likely
a relic of past isolation reflecting the existence of glacial
refuges both West (Spain) and East (Levant) of the Mediterranean basin. Interestingly clear footprints of selection
were detected only in one of the two groups (the western
group 2) suggesting that selective pressures differ across
Western and Eastern parts of the species range. No
obvious environmental differences between these two
geographic regions could be identified: both regions span
a similar latitudinal gradient and share the mosaic of climate, geology and anthropic pressures that characterize
the Mediterranean [50]. The only notable difference
between these two groups is the size of the geographic
area they span, the Western group being restricted to the
Iberian Peninsula and Northern Morocco.
Molecular adaptation in the nodulation and flowering
pathway

Although the majority of Arabidopsis flowering genes
have orthologs in legumes, little is known about the

Page 10 of 13

genes underlying variation in flowering time in Medicago truncatula. Previous studies have shown that as
most Mediterranean legume species, Medicago truncatula exhibits reduced time to flowering under vernalization and under long day conditions [51]. We studied
orthologs of genes that have been shown to be involved
at different levels of the flowering signalling pathway in
Arabidopsis thaliana: PHYa, PHYb, PHYe, VRN and
FCA are involved in the perception of environmental stimuli, COL (Constans-Like) and FRLa (Frigida-Like) are
central genes and FTLa, FTLb, FTLc and SOC1b are
integrating genes [52]. We detected several signatures of
selection in genes involved in the perception of environmental stimuli (PHYa, PHYe and VRN). Phytochromes
are a family of plant photoreceptors that mediate physiological and developmental responses to changes in
light conditions. In Arabidopsis thaliana, five phytochrome (PHYa-e) genes have been shown to be involved
in the timing of flowerng, with PHYa, PHYd, and PHYe
playing a major role in the control of flowering under
cool conditions [53]. VRN1 and VRN2 have been shown
to mediate response to vernalization both in Arabidopsis
thaliana and cereal crops [54].
We note that most footprints of selection detected in
this study involve the most upstream genes of the flowering pathway. Such genes are expected to be associated
with lower pleiotropic effect and are thus expected to be
preferential targets of natural selection [55]. We also
detected a significant deviation from neutral expectations on the integrator gene FT (FLOWERING TIME).
This gene acts on the floral meristem identity genes to
initiate flowering and is one of six candidate genes that
have been shown to be located in the support interval
of a QTL that explained 10 to 60% of the flowering date
variation in three RILs populations [56].
Further phenotypic and climatic data are needed to
evaluate the role of these different genes in natural variation for flowering date in Medicago truncatula and to
understand their involvement in the adaptation of the
species to climatic variations.
For nodulation genes, we detected footprints of selection in two genes DMI1 and NIN. Both genes are acting
at the signal transduction level, without direct interaction with the symbiotic partner. DMI1 appears to have
undergone selection both recently - between M. truncatula populations - and more anciently in the Medicago
genus. A sliding window analysis reinforces this statement (Figure 4) while similar analyses for other candidate genes did not uncover obvious local signatures of
selection along the gene (data not shown).

Conclusion
We used Sanger sequencing to survey nucleotide variation in Medicago truncatula. We focused on a set of

De Mita et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:229
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/229

important genes with known function in the Nod factor
perception and flowering pathways and asked if selection had affected these genes at different evolutionary
time-scales. We did so by contrasting patterns of polymorphism at candidate genes with a set of control gene
fragments and a coalescent framework where simple
demographic models were fitted to the control data.
The fitted demographic models were then used as a
basis to obtain - via coalescent simulations - null distributions for statistics characterizing patterns of variation
in genes of interest. Here we uncover several footprints
of selection in both pathways and at different evolutionary time scales. Our detailed analysis of diversity within
groups demonstrates that model-based methods of analysis can be quite sensitive to assumptions of the underlying models used. Future models should explore more
detailed demographic scenarios, possibly in a more spatially explicit context (see for instance [57] for analysis
of spatial patterns of polymorphism in A. thaliana).
Inspection of the empirical distribution of scaled mutation rates also suggests ample variation in per nucleotide
mutation rate throughout the genome. Even if neutrality
test statistics are built in order to minimize sensitivity to
underlying variation in mutation rates, incorporating
genomic heterogeneities in mutation and recombination
along the genome may be needed to generate sound
null distributions that integrate over both historical and
mutational/recombinational unobserved processes that
shape genomic diversity [58]. Fitting such models
requires orders of magnitude of more polymorphism
data but these will be available in the near future for the
M truncatula species complex [http://medicagohapmap.
org/] and increasingly so for non model species. Thus,
barring the computational challenges to “scale up” to
genome levels, model based approaches incorporating
the additional touch of biological realism described
above will be a fruitful framework for understanding
evolutionary forces shaping genome variation and, ultimately, symbiotic evolution and flowering time in this
system.
