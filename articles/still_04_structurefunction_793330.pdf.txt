Abstract
Background: Examination of ancient gene families can provide an insight into how the evolution
of gene structure can relate to function. Functional homologs of the evolutionarily conserved
transforming acidic coiled coil (TACC) gene family are present in organisms from yeast to man.
However, correlations between functional interactions and the evolution of these proteins have
yet to be determined.
Results: We have performed an extensive database analysis to determine the genomic and cDNA
sequences of the TACCs from phylogenetically diverse organisms. This analysis has determined the
phylogenetic relationship of the TACC proteins to other coiled coil proteins, the resolution of the
placement of the rabbit TACC4 as the orthologue of human TACC3, and RHAMM as a distinct
family of coiled coil proteins. We have also extended the analysis of the TACCs to the interaction
databases of C. elegans and D. melanogaster to identify potentially novel TACC interactions. The
validity of this modeling was confirmed independently by the demonstration of direct binding of
human TACC2 to the nuclear hormone receptor RXRβ.
Conclusion: The data so far suggest that the ancestral TACC protein played a role in
centrosomal/mitotic spindle dynamics. TACC proteins were then recruited to complexes involved
in protein translation, RNA processing and transcription by interactions with specific bridging
proteins. However, during evolution, the TACC proteins have now acquired the ability to directly
interact with components of these complexes (such as the LSm proteins, nuclear hormone
receptors, GAS41, and transcription factors). This suggests that the function of the TACC proteins
may have evolved from performing assembly or coordination functions in the centrosome to
include a more intimate role in the functional evolution of chromatin remodeling, transcriptional
and posttranscriptional complexes in the cell.

Background
The evolution of complex organisms has been associated
with the generation of gene families by the continual

duplication of an initial relatively small set of ancestral
genes. Through this process, followed by subsequent
mutation, reduplication and exon shuffling between gene

families, genes have evolved both discrete, and partially
redundant functions with their related family members.
With the completion of the genome sequencing projects
of human, mouse, rat, fruit fly and nematodes, we are
now in a position to ask fundamental questions in regard
to how genes interact in the context of the whole organism. Thus, with the appropriate application of bioinformatics, it is now possible to trace the lineage of particular
genes and gene families, with related gene families in
other organisms. Furthermore, with the growing amount
of large-scale proteomic and genomic data becoming publicly available, this analysis can now be extended to reveal
the complex interplay between evolution of gene structure
and protein function.
The first Transforming acidic coiled coil gene, TACC1, was
identified during the development of an expression map
of the proximal short arm of human chromosome 8 [1].
Two additional TACC family members were subsequently
identified and mapped to paralogous chromosomal
regions on human chromosomes 4p16 and 10q26, physically close to members of the FGFR gene family [1-3].
This mapping data, together with identification of a single
TACC gene in the protostomes Caenorhabitis elegans, and
Drosophila melanogaster [4-6], led to the speculation that
the ancestral FGFR and TACC genes were located physically close to each other. Thus, during the evolution of vertebrates, subsequent successive duplications of the
ancestral gene cluster have given rise to three TACC family
members located close to FGFR genes in humans. In
accordance with the proposed quadruplication of the vertebrate genome during evolution, there is a fourth FGFR
family member in vertebrates, raising the question of
whether a fourth TACC gene is associated with FGFR4 in
vertebrate genomes. To date, only three active TACC genes
have been cloned in humans [1-3], one in each of mouse
[7], Xenopus laevis [8], D. melanogaster [4], and C. elegans
[5,6]. Although two additional new candidate TACC family members, Oryctolagus cuniculus TACC4 [9] and human
RHAMM [10] have been proposed, their true identity and
placement in the evolution of the TACC family is under
debate. Thus, the identification and functional characterization of new members of the TACC family in other
organisms, alternatively spliced isoforms of each TACC
and comparison of the phylogenetic relationship of these
genes relative to other members of the coiled coil superfamily will resolve this issue and provide clues to the evolution of TACC function.

Results and Discussion
In silico identification of TACC family members from
vertebrate and invertebrate lineages
Sequence similarity searches of the publicly available
genome databases with the BLAST and TBLAST programs
were performed to identify TACC and RHAMM ortho-

logues, and other members of the coiled coil superfamily
in a diverse set of species (Fig. 1). This identified the complete sequence of the TACC genes in representatives of five
major phylogenetically distinct clades. Where possible,
the construction of the TACC sequences from these organisms was also confirmed by the analysis of the cDNA databases. Several partial sequences in other vertebrate
species, the echinodermate Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
and the protostome insect Anopheles gambiae were also
identified, suggesting an ancient conservation of the
TACC genes in metazoan lineages. However, due to the
relative infancy of the cDNA/genome projects for these
latter organisms, complete characterization of these TACC
genes could not be undertaken. No conclusion could be
made about the existence of TACC-like sequence in nonbilaterian metazoans, such as Cnidaria or Porifera, due to
the paucity of sequence information for these organisms,
and additional definitive sequences with a defined TACC
domain could not be found in other non-metazoan
organisms.
At the base of the chordate branch of life, a single TACC
gene was identified in the genome of the urochordate
Ciona intestinalis [11], and a partial TACC sequence from
an analysis of the Halocynthia rortezi EST database [12].
This confirms the original assumption that a single TACC
gene was present in the chordate ancestor. The next major
event in the evolution of the chordate genome has been
suggested to have occurred 687 ± 155.7 million years ago
(MYA), with the first duplication of the chordate genome,
and a second duplication occurring shortly thereafter.
Thus, if the TACC genes were duplicated at both events,
we would expect to identify four TACC genes in the most
"primitive" compact vertebrate genome sequenced to
date, the pufferfish Takifugu rubripes, with three genes corresponding to the human TACC1-3, and, in keeping with
the proposed model for genomic duplication of the chromosomal loci for the TACC genes (discussed below), a
possible fourth gene deriving from the TACC3 ancestor.
Indeed, four TACC genes were identified in T. rubripes. Of
these, two genes corresponded to the T. rubripes orthologues of human TACC2 and TACC3. However, the other
two genes, trTACC1A and trTACC1B are clearly most
related to TACC1 (Fig. 1). Although trTACC1A is highly
homologous to trTACC1B, the latter encodes a significantly smaller predicted protein. The trTACC1B gene is
encoded by 15 exons over approximately 7 kb of the Takifugu Scaffold 191 (see below). A search of this region
using the trTACC1A sequence and gene prediction software has so far failed to identify additional exons of
trTACC1B. However, given the intron/exon structure of
this apparently complete gene, it appears likely that
trTACC1B is active in the pufferfish, and presumably fulfils either a temporal-spatial specific function within the
organism, or a distinct function from the larger trTACC1A

Figure 1
Phylogenetic analysis of the TACC family members compared to other coiled coil proteins
Phylogenetic analysis of the TACC family members compared to other coiled coil proteins. The phylogenetic
tree was constructed as described in the Methods section. The TACC family defines a separate subfamily of coiled coil containing proteins, distinct from other coiled coil families such as the keratins, RHAMM and tropomyosins. Note that the RHAMM
proteins form a separate branch more closely related to the tropomyosins and kinesin like proteins (KLP), than the TACC
proteins.

product within the cell. Thus, based upon the surrounding chromosomal loci (see below), the trTACC1A and
trTACC1B genes appear to have arisen from the duplication of the chromosomal segment containing the teleost
TACC1 ancestor, during the additional partial genomic
duplication that occurred in the teleost lineage. Therefore,
this analysis of T. rubripes does not support the hypothesis
that the region surrounding the TACC3 ancestor was

included in the second round of vertebrate genomic
duplication.
Examination of higher vertebrates led to the identification
of splice variants of TACC1 and TACC2 in Mus musculus,
and the assembly of the previously unidentified orthologues of TACC1-3 from Rattus norvegus. In addition, the
TACC1X sequence was found on mouse chromosome X.

This gene is clearly related to the mouse TACC1, however,
further examination revealed a mouse B1 repeat distributed over the length of the proposed intron. In addition,
no expression of TACC1X was detected in mouse RNA by
rt-PCR analysis (data not shown), suggesting that this
sequence is a processed pseudogene. Similarly, TACC1
pseudogenes also exist spread over 22 kb of the centromeric region of human chromosome 10 and, in 8q21, a
shorter region 86% identical to the final 359 bp of the
TACC1 3' untranslated region. No pseudogenes corresponding to TACC2 or TACC3 were identified in any
mammalian species.
Characterization of vertebrate TACC3 orthologues
Based upon current functional analysis, the characterization of TACC3 orthologues is likely to be pivotal to understanding the sequence and functional evolution of the
TACC gene family. As indicated below, the chromosomal
region containing the TACC gene precursors was duplicated twice during vertebrate evolution. Although the
analysis of T. rubripes, rodents and humans so far suggests
that the vertebrate TACC3 precursor was not included in
the second round of genomic duplication, it could not be
excluded that a TACC4 gene may have been lost during
the evolution of these lineages. The cloning of a new
member of the TACC family in Oryctolagus cuniculus has
added to this controversy [9]. Designated TACC4, the 1.5
kb cDNA was highly related, but proposed to be distinct
from TACC3. However, Northern blot data suggested that
this gene produces a single 2.3 kb transcript [9], indicating
that the cloned cDNA was incomplete. The degree of similarity to the published sequence of human and mouse
TACC3 suggested to us that TACC4 actually represents a
partial rabbit TACC3 cDNA. To test this hypothesis, we set
out to clone the complete rabbit TACC3 sequence, based
upon the known features of human and mouse TACC3.
We have previously noted that the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the human and mouse TACC3 proteins
are highly conserved ([2], see below). Therefore, based
upon the sequence identity between these genes, we
designed a consensus oligonucleotide primer, T3con2,
that would be suitable for the identification of the region
containing the initiator methionine of the TACC3 cDNAs
from primates and rodents. Using this primer, in combination with the TACC4-specific RACE primer (RACE2),
initially used by Steadman et al [9], we isolated a 1.5 kb
PCR product from rabbit brain cDNA by rt-PCR. In combination with 3'RACE, this generated a consensus cDNA
of 2283 bp which corresponds to the transcript size of 2.3
kb detected by the "TACC4" sequence reported in Figure 4
of Steadman et al [9]. Thus, while it remains possible that
the "TACC4" sequence is an alternative splice product, or
is the product of reduplication of the TACC3 gene (events
that would be specific to the rabbit), the only transcript
detected in rabbit RNA corresponds to the predicted tran-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/16

script size of the TACC3 sequence that we have identified
here. Furthermore, the string of nucleotides found at the
5' end of the "TACC4" sequence is also found at the 5'
ends of a number of cDNA sequences (e.g. U82468,
NM_023500), that were isolated by 5'RACE, suggesting
that they may correspond to an artefact of the 5'RACE
methodology used in their construction. The rabbit
"TACC4" and the rabbit TACC3 sequence that we have
isolated are also found on the same branch of the TACC
phylogenetic tree with the other TACC3 orthologues,
including maskin (Xenopus laevis), and the newly identified TACC3 sequences in Rattus norvegus, Gallus gallus, Silurana tropicalis, Danio rerio and T. rubripes, reported in this
manuscript (Fig. 1). Thus, it is not in a separate branch
that may be expected if the sequence was a distinct TACC
family member.
Placement of the RHAMM gene in the phylogeny of the
coiled coil gene family
Human RHAMM has also been proposed to be the missing fourth member of the TACC family [10]. Evidence
used in support of this claim included its chromosomal
location on 5q32 in humans (discussed below), its
sequence similarity in its coiled coil domain to the TACC
domain and the subcellular localization of the RHAMM
protein in the centrosome. However, if RHAMM were a
bona fide TACC family member, then we would predict its
evolution would be similar to those of other TACC family
members, and fit with the proposed evolution of the vertebrate genome. Thus, we set out to identify RHAMM
orthologues and related genes in metazoans, so that a
more complete phylogeny of the coiled coil super family
could be generated. We identified a single RHAMM gene
in all deuterostomes for which cDNA and/or genomic
sequence was available, including C. intestinalis. No
RHAMM gene was identified in insects or nematodes. This
indicates that the RHAMM/TACC genes diverged after the
protostome/deuterostome split 833–933 MYA, but prior
to the echinodermata/urochordate divergence (>750
MYA). Significantly, sequence and phylogenetic analysis
of coiled coil proteins (Fig. 1) clearly shows that RHAMM
does not contain a TACC domain and instead forms a distinct family of proteins in the coiled coil superfamily, and
is not a direct descendant of the ancestral TACC gene.
Evolution of the chromosomal segments containing the
TACC genes
The phylogenetic tree of the FGFR genes closely resembles
that of the vertebrate TACC1-3 genes. Recently, detailed
analyses of the chromosomal regions containing the FGFR
gene family in humans, mouse and the arthopod D. melanogaster have revealed the conservation of paralogous
chromosomal segments between these organisms (Fig. 2,
[13], Table 1 [see Additional file 1]). This has provided
further support that an ancient chromosomal segment

Linear organization of gene clusters centering upon the chromosomal loci of the FGFR genes in humans
Figure 2
Linear organization of gene clusters centering upon the chromosomal loci of the FGFR genes in humans. Paralogous genes present in at least two of the four loci are shown, with the exception of the region between GPX3 and NKX2E on
chromosome 5, which appears to represent a series of intervening genes inserted after duplication of the 4p16/5q32-35 clusters, and genes mentioned in Fig. 3. Corresponding syntenic mouse chromosomal regions (mm*) are indicated. Takifugu
rubripes scaffolds are shown (TR*) that contain more than one homologous gene from these clusters. Further details on the
location of paralogous genes can be found in [see Additional file 1].

was duplicated twice during vertebrate evolution, with the
first duplication that gave rise to the human chromosome
4p16/5q32-ter and human chromosome 8p/10q23-ter
ancestors occurring in the early stages after the invertebrate divergence. This suggests that the ancestral FGFRTACC gene pair most probably arose prior to the initial
duplication and subsequent divergence of these paralogous chromosomal segments, estimated to have occurred
687 ± 155.7 MYA. This has raised the suggestion that a
fourth TACC gene in vertebrates would reside in the same
chromosomal region as FGFR4. Indeed this hypothesis

has been used in support for the RHAMM gene as a member of the TACC family [10]. Human RHAMM maps to
chromosome 5q32 in a region bounded by GPX3 and
NKX2E. These loci separate two clusters of genes on
human chromosome 5 that are paralogous with 4p16.
Interestingly, these three clusters are located on different
chromosomes in mouse and rat (Fig. 2), further suggesting that this cluster of genes was transposed into this
region after the primate/rodent divergence.

Because the conservation of gene order can also provide
clues to the evolution of gene regulation, we next
attempted to trace the evolution of these paralogous
segments by examining the genome of the tunicate C.
intestinalis [11] and the most "primitive" compact vertebrate genome sequenced to date, T. rubripes [14].
Although not fully assembled, examination of the
genome of T. rubripes confirmed the presence of chromosomal segments paralogous to those found in higher vertebrates (Fig. 2). For instance, the orthologues of GPRK2L
and RGS12 are found on T. rubripes scaffold 290
(emb|CAAB01000290.1), and within 300 kb of each
other in human 4p16. The T. rubripes orthologues of
FGFR3, LETM1 and WHSC1 are located on the same 166
kb genomic scaffold 251 (emb|CAAB01000166.1). Significantly, the three human orthologues of these genes are
also located within 300 kb of each other on 4p16. Furthermore, TACC3 and FGFRL map to the overlapping scaffolds 1184/4669 (emb|CAAB01004668). Similarly,
elements of these gene clusters, extending from HMP19 to
GPRK6 in human chromosome 5q34-ter are also found in
the pufferfish, with the T. rubripes orthologues of NSD1,
FGFR4 and a RAB-like gene mapping on scaffold 407
(emb|CAAB01000407). However, there is no evidence for
a gene corresponding to a TACC4 gene in any of these
clusters.
As noted above, phylogenetic analysis of the TACC
sequences indicate that there are two TACC1 related genes
in the pufferfish. trTACC1B is located on the 180 kb scaffold 191 (emb|CAAB01000191.1), which also contains
the orthologues of several genes located in human chromosome 8p21-11. Thus, this scaffold represents the more
"developed" TACC1 chromosomal segment that is evident in higher vertebrates. On the other hand, the
trTACC1A gene is located in the 396 kb scaffold 12
(emb|CAAB010012.1). This scaffold also contains the T.
rubripes orthologues of MSX1, STX18, D4S234E and the
predicted gene LOC118711, in addition to sequences with
homology to LOXL, EVC, LOC159291, and the LDB family. Thus, scaffold 12 contains genes found in the regions
of human chromosome 4 and 10 that also contain the loci
for TACC3 and TACC2, respectively, and may therefore
more closely resemble the genomic organization resulting
from the initial duplication of the ancestral paralogous
chromosomal segment.
Conserved paralogous clusters may result from the initial
clustering of the genes in a relatively small ancestral
genomic contig. Some evidence for the existence of "protoclusters" that could correspond to the paralogous chromosomal segments noted in higher vertebrates is present
in the genome of the urochordate C. intestinalis [11]. For
instance, the orthologues of FGFR, and WHSC1, carboxypeptidase Z and FLJ25359 cluster within an 85 kb region

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/16

of the C. intestinalis genome and the human orthologues
are still maintained in paralogous segments of 4p16, 8p
and 10q (Fig. 3, [see Additional file 1]). However, it
should be noted that no clusters of genes from the vertebrate paralogous segments are locate close to the TACC or
RHAMM genes of C. intestinalis, indicating that the formation of the much larger paralogous segments encompassing the FGFR-TACC genes formed later in evolutionary
time, or conversely have been subject to extensive rearrangement in tunicates. In combination with the examination of the T. rubripes genome, this also provides
additional evidence that either the second round of duplication of the chromosomal segment that contained the
FGFR3/4 ancestor did not include a TACC gene, or that
such a gene was lost very early in vertebrate evolution,
prior to the divergence of the Gnanthostome lineages.
However, the final resolution of the initial evolution of
these paralogous segment will await the sequencing of the
amphioxus and lamprey genomes, which only have one
FGFR gene, and therefore should only contain one copy of
the other corresponding genes in this conserved segment.
Comparative genomic structure of the TACC family
The genomic DNA sequences corresponding to the orthologous TACC genes of human, mouse, rat, pufferfish, C.
intestinalis, D. melanogaster and C. elegans were extracted
and analyzed by Genescan and BLAST to determine the
genomic structure of each TACC gene. In some cases, for
rat and pufferfish, exons were added or modified based on
the best similarity of translated peptides to the corresponding mouse and human proteins. For regions with
low sequence similarity in T. rubripes, genomic sequences
http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/ from the fresh water pufferfish, Tetraodon nigroviridis were used as additional means
to verify the predicted exons.

The general structure of the TACC genes and proteins is
depicted in Fig. 4. The main conserved feature of the
TACC family, the TACC domain, is located at the carboxy
terminus of the protein. In the case of the C. elegans TAC
protein, this structure comprises the majority of the protein and is encoded by two of the three exons of the gene.
In the higher organisms, D. melanogaster, and the deuterostomes C. intestinalis to human, this feature is also
encoded by the final exons of the gene (five in D. melanogaster, seven in the deuterostome genes). Outside of the
TACC domain, however, TACC family members show relatively little homology. It is interesting that each TACC
gene contains one large exon, which shows considerable
variability between TACC orthologues, and constitutes
the main difference between the TACC3 genes in the vertebrates (see below). In deuterostomes, this exon contains
the SDP repeat (or in the case of the murine TACC3's, a
rodent-specific 24 amino acid repeat), which is

Formation of protoclusters in Takifugu rubripes and Ciona intestinalis: (A): Structure of the genomic scaffolds containing the Takifugu rubripes trTACC1A and trTACC1B genes. Scaffold 12, the site for the trTACC1A gene contains genes found
with either homologues or orthologues on the distal long arm of human chromosome 10 and 4p16. This scaffold, therefore,
has some of the characteristics of the predicted immediate ancestor of the TACC1/TACC2 chromosomal segment. trTACC1B is

responsible for the binding of the SWI/SNF chromatin
remodeling complex component GAS41 [15,16].
Of the vertebrate TACC proteins, the TACC3 orthologues
show the greatest variability in size and sequence, ranging
in size from 599 amino acids for the rat TACC3 protein, to
942 amino acids in the Danio rerio protein. The reasons for
these differences are apparent from the genomic structure
of the TACC3 orthologues. TACC3 can be divided into
three sections: a conserved N-terminal region (CNTR) of
108 amino acids, encoded by exons 2 and 3 in each verte-

brate TACC3 gene, the conserved TACC domain distributed over the final seven exons, and a highly variable
central region. The lack of conservation in both size and
sequence of the central portion of the TACC3 proteins of
human and mouse has been previously noted, and
accounts for the major difference between these two
orthologues [2]. The majority of this central portion,
which contains the SDP repeat motifs, is encoded by one
exon

human
and
the

(emb|CAAB01001184). In rodents, however, this region

Genomic structure of the TACC genes
Figure 4
Genomic structure of the TACC genes. Conserved regions known to bind protein factors in all human TACC proteins
are shown. The SDP repeat of human TACC1-3 is known to bind GAS41 ([3,15] and data not shown). The TACC domain binds
ch-TOG and members of the Aurora kinases in all species examined to date. This motif is characteristically encoded by the 3'
exons of the TACC genes. The size of the largest isoform for each gene is shown.

repeats, which are located in a single exon of the mouse
and rat TACC3 genes. It has been previously reported that
there are four mouse TACC3 splice variants that differ in
the number of these repeats [2,7,17]. As these repeats are
present in a single exon, it appears likely that these different sequences may be the result of the DNA polymerases
used in the cDNA synthesis and/or PCR reaction stuttering
through the repeat motif. The correct sequence, reported
by Sadek et al [7], is the one used throughout the entirety
of this manuscript. These repeats are not evident in the
rabbit protein, or any other TACC protein, and may indicate that the rodent TACC3 has evolved distinct functions,
as has already been noted for the amphibian Xenopus
TACC3, maskin [8].
Alternative splicing in vertebrate TACC genes
Whereas exon shuffling can drive the functional diversification of gene families over evolutionary time, the temporal and/or tissue specific alternative splicing of a gene can
give rise to functional diversification of a single gene during the development of an organism. Although no alternative splicing of TACC3 has been clearly documented,
both temporal and tissue specific splicing is observed in
the TACC1 and TACC2 genes. In the case of TACC2, an
additional large (5 kb) exon accounts for the main difference between the major splice variants of the vertebrate
TACC2 genes [3]. The alternative splicing of this exon suggests a major functional difference between the two
TACC2 isoforms, TACC2s and TACC2l [3], as well as a significant difference between TACC2 and its closest TACC
family relative, TACC1. However, the function of this
region of the TACC2l isoform is current unknown.

Alternative splicing, together with differential promoter
usage has already been noted for the human TACC1 gene
[18,19]. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5, we have identified
additional TACC1 isoforms that result from alternative
splicing of exons 1b-4a. The functions of these different
isoforms are unknown, however the region deleted from
the shorter variants can include the binding site for LSm7
[20] (variants C, D, F-I), and/or the nuclear localization
signals and binding site for GAS41 [15] and PCTAIRE2BP
[20] (isoforms B-D, S). One of these isoforms, TACC1S is
localized exclusively to the cytoplasm [19], suggesting
that the shorter isoforms would not be able to interact
with elements of the chomatin remodeling and/or RNA
processing machinery in the nucleus. Thus, changes in the
complement of TACC1 isoforms in the cell may result in
alterations in cellular RNA metabolism at multiple levels,
and may account for the observation that TACC1D and
TACC1F isoforms are associated with tumorigenic
changes in gastric mucosa [18].

In silico modeling of the evolution of TACC protein
function
The protein and genomic structure of the present day
TACC family members suggests that the function of the
ancestral TACC protein was mediated solely through the
interactions of the conserved TACC domain. Using an in
silico protein-protein interaction model based upon
known mitotic spindle and centrosomal components, we
have previously predicted a number of additional interactions that could be conserved between a functional TACC
homologue in yeast, spc-72, and one or more human
TACC proteins [21]. Thus, it is known that all the TACC
proteins examined to date interact, via the TACC domain,
with the microtubule/centrosomal proteins of the stu2/
msps/ch-TOG family [5,6,22-24], and with the Aurora
kinases [20,21,25]. These interactions are required for the
accumulation of the D-TACC, spc72, ceTAC1 and TACC3
proteins to the centrosome [5,6,22-24]. Hence, this functional interaction with the centrosome and mitotic spindle is likely to represent the ancient, conserved function of
the TACC family. However, it is apparent that the human
TACC proteins also differ in their ability to interact with
the Aurora kinases. For instance, TACC1 and TACC3 interact with Aurora A kinase, whereas TACC2 interacts with
Aurora C kinase [21], suggesting a degree of functional
specialization in the derivatives of the ancestral chordate
TACC, after the radiation of the vertebrate TACC genes.

The localization of the vertebrate TACC proteins in the
interphase nucleus [15,26,27] suggests that they have
additional functions outside their ancient role in the centrosome and microtubule dynamics. Thus, it seems likely
that TACC family members in protostomes and deuterostomes have integrated new unique functions as the evolving TACC genes acquired additional exons. The results of
the pilot large-scale proteomic analysis in C. elegans and
D. melanogaster provide further suggestive evidence to this
functional evolution. Yeast two hybrid analysis indicates
that ceTAC directly binds to C. elegans lin15A, lin36 and
lin37 [28]. These proteins bridge ceTAC to other elements
of the cytoskeleton and microtubule network, as well as to
components of the ribosome, the histone deacetylase
chromatin remodeling machinery such as egr-1 and lin-53
(the C. elegans homologues of the human MTA-1 and
RbAP48), and to transcription factors such as the PAL1
homeobox and the nuclear hormone receptor nhr-86 [28]
(Fig. 6A). Similarly, large scale proteomics [29] has shown
that Drosophila TACC interacts with two proteins, the RNA
binding protein TBPH and CG14540 (Fig. 6B), and thus
indirectly with the Drosophila SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and DNA damage repair machinery. Significantly, the ceTAC protein has also recently been
implicated in DNA repair through its direct interaction
with the C. elegans BARD1 orthologue [30]. It should be
noted that a number of interactions with the TACC

Alternative splicing of the human TACC1 gene
Alternative splicing of the human TACC1 gene. (A): Seven splice variants have been identified for human TACC1 (A-F
and S). We have also identified additional splice variants (G-I) from database analysis and rt-PCR analysis of human brain RNA.
(B): Alternative splicing of TACC1 in the human brain. rt-PCR analysis confirms splicing of the untranslated exon 1a to exon 1,
with retention of the originally defined start methionine (GB:NP_006274) (Variant A*, lanes 1 and 3). Exon 1a also splices to
exon 2, removing the L-Sm7 binding motif (variant I, lanes 3,12 and 13). Variants that functionally delete exons 2 and/or 3, such
as variant C (lane 15) also remove the predicted nuclear localization signals, and the binding domains for GAS41 and
PCTAIRE2BP. These variants would retain the TACC domain, and therefore the potential to bind to ch-TOG and Aurora A
kinase in the centrosome. Lane 1: EF/X1R, Lane 2: EF/BX647R, Lane 3: EF/6SPR, Lane 4: EF/1DR, Lane 5, EF/128R, Lane 6 X3F/

proteins from these organisms have probably been missed
by these large scale methods, including the well documented direct interactions with the aurora kinases and the
stu2/msps/ch-TOG family.
Because of the evolutionary conservation of the TACC
domain, we would predict that some of the functional
interactions seen in C. elegans and D. melanogaster would
be observed in higher animals. Phylogenetic profiling
from these interaction maps suggests two similar sets of
predicted interactions for vertebrate TACCs (Fig. 6C and
6D). Strikingly, however, the C. elegans specific proteins
lin15A, lin36 and lin37 do not have readily discernible
homologues in vertebrates or Drosophila, although the
presence of a zinc finger domain in lin36 may suggest that
this protein is involved directly in transcription or perform an adaptor role similar to LIM containing proteins.
For the DTACC interacting proteins, TBPH corresponds to
TDP43, a protein implicated in transcriptional regulation
and splicing [31,32]. However, the assignment of the
human homologue of CG14540 is less clear, with the
closest matches in the human databases corresponding to
glutamine rich transcription factors such as CREB and the
G-box binding factor.
Comparison of modeled with experimentally defined
interactions of the vertebrate TACC proteins
The interaction data for the vertebrate TACCs is relatively
limited; however, interaction networks are now beginning
to emerge. The results of our functional analysis, as well as
other published data clearly indicate that the vertebrate
TACCs interact with proteins that can be divided into two
broad categories: 1) proteins with roles in centrosome/
mitotic spindle dynamics, and 2) proteins involved in
gene regulation, either at the level of transcription, or subsequent RNA processing and translation [3,5-7,15,1921,24,25,33,34]. Many of these proteins do not appear to
interact directly with the protostome TACCs, but would
be expected to be in the same protein complex (Fig.
6C,6D).

Significant analysis of the association of the TACCs with
the centrosome and the dynamics of mitotic spindle
assembly from yeast to humans has been published
[5,6,21-24]. From this analysis, it seems likely that the vertebrate TACC3 protein has retained this direct ancestral
function, based upon its location in these structures during mitosis [27], its strong interaction with Aurora Kinase
A, and the observation that it is the only human TACC
protein phosphorylated by this enzyme [21]. However,
the variability of the central domain of the vertebrate
orthologues, suggests that TACC3 may also have acquired
additional, and in some instances, species-specific functions. For instance, in X. laevis, the maskin protein has
acquired a binding site for the eIF4E protein, and thus a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/16

function in the coordinated control of polyadenylation
and translation in the Xenopus oocyte [8,35]. A recent
study has suggested that this function may be unique to
maskin: although it is unclear whether the other vertebrate TACC3 proteins interact with the eIF4E/CPEB complex, the human TACC1A isoform is unable to interact
with the eIF4E/CPEB complex. Instead, some TACC1 isoforms have evolved a related, but distinct function by
directly interacting with elements of the RNA splicing and
transport machinery [19].
To further characterize the evolving functions of the TACC
proteins, we have used an unbiased yeast two hybrid
screening method to identify proteins that bind to the
human TACC proteins [3,34]. In a screen of a MATCHMAKER fetal brain library (BD Biosciences Clontech), in
addition to isolating the histone acetyltransferase
hGCN5L2 [34], we also identified the β3 isoform of retinoid-X receptor β as a protein that interacts with the TACC
domain of TACC2. As shown in Fig. 7, this interaction is
confirmed in vitro by GST-pull down analysis. Significantly, RXRβ is a close family relative of the nuclear hormone receptor, nhr-86, from C. elegans, which interacts
with the ceTAC binding protein lin36 (Fig. 6A). This suggests that while protostome TACCs may require
additional protein factors to interact with such components, the TACCs in higher organisms may have evolved
the ability to directly interact with some of the proteins in
the predicted interaction map (Fig. 6E). Indeed, this
appears to be directly linked to the acquisition of new
domains and duplication of the chordate TACC precursor.
In fact, the first identified function of a vertebrate TACC
protein was as a transcriptional coactivator acting through
a direct interaction with the ARNT transcription factor [7].
It is also intriguing that the deuterostome specific SDP
repeat interacts with GAS41, a component/accessory factor of the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex [3,15]. Although there is a D. melanogaster
homologue of GAS41, dmGAS41, the large scale proteomic interaction database does not indicate a direct
interaction of dmGAS41 with DTACC. This may be due to
the lack of the SDP repeat region in the Drosophila TACC
protein. This further suggests that the vertebrate TACCs
have gained the specific ability to direct interact with transcriptional regulatory complexes, and that bridging protein(s) are no longer required. Thus, where the ceTAC
protein is only composed of the TACC domain, the significantly larger TACC family members in higher protostomes and deuterostomes may have integrated one or
more functions of the bridging protein (in this case
lin15A, lin36 or lin37). This may also explain the absence
of lin15A, lin36 and lin37 homologues in higher organisms, as they were no longer under selective evolutionary
pressure to remain within the complex, and thus lost in
the evolving genome.

Conclusion
Proposed functional evolution of the TACC family
Examination of the evolution of ancient gene families
provides an insight into how gene structure relates to
function. We have presented above, a detailed examination of one such gene family. The data so far suggest that
the functional TACC homologue in yeast (spc72) has a
specific role in centrosomal/mitotic spindle dynamics
[21,22]. This ancient TACC function is conserved
throughout evolution in both protostomes and deuterostomes. In addition, the TACC proteins of lower organisms
appear to interact with bridging proteins that are components of several different protein complexes involved in
DNA damage repair, protein translation, RNA processing
and transcription. However, over the process of evolutionary time, with the acquisition of new domains and duplication of the chordate TACC precursor, the chordate
TACC proteins have acquired the ability to directly interact with some of the other components of these complexes (such as the LSm proteins, nuclear hormone
receptors, GAS41, accessory proteins and transcription
factors), and thus evolved additional functions within
these complexes. Indeed, the first assigned function of a
vertebrate TACC protein, mouse TACC3, was as a
transcriptional coactivator of the ARNT mediated transcriptional response to hypoxia and polyaromatic

hydrocarbons [7]. Mouse TACC3 has also been reported
to interact with the transcription factor STAT5 [33].
Recently, we have demonstrated that TACC2 and TACC3
can bind to nuclear histone acetyltransferases [34], further
confirming a more direct role for the TACC proteins in
transcriptional and chromatin remodeling events. Interestingly although all human TACC proteins can directly
interact with the histone acetyltransferase pCAF in vitro,
the TACC1 isoforms expressed in human breast cancer
cells do not interact with this histone acetylase [34]. This
may be attributable to the proposed function of the Exon
1 containing TACC1 variants in RNA processing, via the
interaction with LSm-7 and SmG [19]. Thus, alternative
splicing of the TACC1 gene adds further diversity to
TACC1 function, as the deletion of specific exons and
their associated binding domains will change the potential protein complexes with which they can associate,
either directly, or by redirecting the splice variants to different subcellular compartments. With the duplication of
the TACC1/TACC2 ancestor, it is apparent that an even
greater functional diversity may have been introduced
into the TACC family. The TACC2 protein retains the ability of TACC3 to interact with GAS41, INI1, histone acetyltransferases and transcription factors (in this case, RXRβ)
(Fig. 7) [3,34]. However, the tissue specific splicing of the
5 kb exon in the TACC2l isoform [3] indicates that this

protein has several temporal and tissue specific functions
yet to be identified.

Methods

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/16

mRNA, mouse testis and human brain total RNA were
obtained from BD Bioscience Clontech (Palo Alto, CA,
U.S.A.). Reverse transcription and PCR was performed as
previously described, using either 1 µg of total RNA or 50
ng of poly A+ mRNA as template for first strand cDNA
synthesis. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, U.S.A.) and transformed into InvαF'
competent cells. Plasmid inserts were sequenced by the
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Biopolymer Core Facility.

Compilation and assembly of previously uncharacterized
TACC cDNAs and genes
Corresponding orthologous sequences for TACC,
RHAMM, KLP, KIF, TPM and keratins families were identified initially using the TBLASTN program [36] to search
the published genomic and cDNA databases. For Takifugu
rubripes, gene predictions were produced by the Ensembl
automated
pipeline
http://www.ensembl.org/
Fugu_rubripes/[37] and the JGI blast server http://
bahama.jgi-psf.org/fugu/bin/fugu_search.
DNA
sequences covering the homology regions were extracted
and analyzed by Genscan to obtain potential exons. In
some cases, exons were added or modified based on the
best similarity of translated peptides to the corresponding
mouse and human proteins. For regions with low
sequence similarity, genomic sequences http://
www.genoscope.cns.fr/ from the fresh water pufferfish,
Tetraodon nigroviridis were used as additional means to
verify the predicted exons. Due to the variability of the
central region of vertebrate TACC3 cDNAs (see text), to
further confirm prediction of the Takifugu rubripes TACC3,
full length cDNAs corresponding to the Danio rerio TACC3
(IMAGE clones 2639991, 2640369 and 3724452) were
also obtained from A.T.C.C. and fully sequenced. Potential paralogous chromosomal segments and scaffold were
identified by searching the public databases deposited at
NCBI and at the Human Genome Mapping Project, Cambridge UK.

These protein sequences were initially aligned with CLUSTAL X [38]. Minor adjustments to certain regions of the
alignment for optimization purposes were made based on
pairwise alignments, the output saved in PHYLIP format,
after which, the distances between proteins were
calculated using Poisson correction and the Unrooted
trees were inferred with the NJ method and then displayed
using TreeView [39]. Bootstrap values above 700 for 1000
trials are shown at the node. To validate the tree, the same
sequence set was analyzed with tools in the PHYLIP package [40], using PRODIST followed by FITCH or NEIGNBOR and tree displaying using TreeView. This additional
method produced trees with essentially the same topology
(data not shown).
In vitro interaction of TACC2 and RXRβ3
The TACC2 cDNA was cloned into GST fusion vector
pGEX5X2 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
GST and GST-TACC2 proteins were expressed in E. coli
BL21(DE3) plys "S" with 1 mM IPTG at 37°C shaker for 2
hrs. Cells (50 ml) were harvested and resuspended in 5 ml
of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH.8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA
pH8.0, Protease inhibitor set III (Calbiochem). The cells
were lysed by sonication and lysate cleared by centrifugation at 7500 rpm at 4°C for 15 min. The cleared lysate was
immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads in 3 ml of
20 mM Tris-HCl pH.8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA
pH8.0). RXRβ3 cDNA was cloned into pET 28C(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and protein synthesized by
TNT quick coupled transcription/translation system kit
(Promega) and radiolabeled with 35S methionine according to manufacturer's instructions. 100 µl of in vitro translated RXRβ3 protein in 1 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH.8.0,
200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH8.0 was incubated at 4°C
with immobilized GST-TACC2 or GST for 90 min.
Unbound RXRβ3 was removed by washing three times
with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH.8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA
pH8.0. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/16

room temperature for 10 min in elution buffer (100 mM
Tris HCl, pH8.0, 20 mM reduced glutathione). The proteins were analyzed on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels.
Coomassie blue staining verified equal loading of GST
fusion protein. Dried gels were autoradiographed.

Location of paralogous genes found on human 4p16, 5q31-ter, 10q23-ter,
8p and chromosome 2. Positions of genes are given in Mb from the telomere of the short arm of the chromosome.Blue highlighted genes (five
copies) are found in all four paralogous segments, and the partially duplicated segment on chromosome 2.Green highlighted genes are found in
either all four paralogous segments, or three of the segments and the partially duplicated region on chromosome 2.Pink highlighted genes have
paralogues in three of the segments, suggesting either loss of the fourth
copy or exclusion of one paralogue from the second round of duplication.Black highlighted genes (two paralogues) are found in only one of the
derivatives of the second round of genome duplication, suggesting complete exclusion of both copies from the second round of duplication.Purple
highlighted genes (two paralogues) were duplicated at the second round
of genome duplication, or from interchromosomal recombination between
paralogous clusters.
