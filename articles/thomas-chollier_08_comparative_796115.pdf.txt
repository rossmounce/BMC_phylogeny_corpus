Abstract
A reanalysis of the sequences reported by Hoegg et al has highlighted the presence of a putative
HoxC1a gene in Astatotilapia burtoni. We discuss the evolutionary history of the HoxC1a gene in
the teleost fish lineages and suggest that HoxC1a gene was lost twice independently in the
Neoteleosts. This comment points out that combining several gene-finding methods and a Hoxdedicated program can improve the identification of Hox genes.

Background
The identification of individual Hox genes is an essential
basis for their study in evolutionary research fields. It is
even more important in teleost fish where the unravelling
of zebrafish and pufferfish Hox clusters have contributed
to the establishment of the fish-specific genome duplication hypothesis. In a recent study, Hoegg et al [1] present
the Hox gene content of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, characterized from the complete sequence of the
seven Hox clusters. Availability of these sequences is
extremely valuable to help the community better understand the evolutionary plasticity of Hox genes and their
regulatory elements in teleosts. A total of 46 Hox coding
sequences have been identified, using common gene
detection methods relying on sequence similarity. Identification of Hox multigenic family members is hampered
by the high conservation of the homeodomain. We
believe that a set of complementary approaches is thus
required to correctly annotate all members of the Hox
family.

Here, we complement the analysis of the Hox gene content of Astatotilapia burtoni reported in [1], using a combination of sequence similarity methods, de-novo gene
predictions and a program we have developed that specifically classifies Hox proteins in their homology groups
[2]. In addition, we collect a comprehensive set of
HoxC1a sequences that allows us to re-investigate the
presence of HoxC1a pseudogenes in various teleost species. In light of our findings, we discuss a revised version
of HoxC1a gene loss events in teleost lineages.

Results and Discussion
HoxC1a gene detection
Astatotilapia burtoni Hox cluster genomic sequences were
collected from GenBank and submitted to the de-novo
gene prediction program GENSCAN [3]. A total of 102
putative coding sequences were localized on the genomic
sequences. We applied HoxPred [2] on each putative peptide, and 37 sequences were predicted as Hox proteins. We
have also applied HoxPred on the protein sequences

detected by Hoegg et al and the resulting classification in
homology groups is concordant with their result in both
cases. We observed that GENSCAN predictions sometimes
encompass two or three genes in a single predicted peptide. This sole method thus detects less Hox genes than
reported in [1].
With this method, we have located a paralogous group
(PG) 1 prediction on the HoxCa cluster. A detailed analysis of the predicted gene shows that GENSCAN, and other
de-novo gene prediction programs, fail to correctly predict
the C-terminal portion of its homeodomain. Alignment
of zebrafish HoxC1a peptide to the HoxCa cluster with
GeneWise (global mode) [4] supports the prediction of
the first exon and completes the homeodomain sequence.
The resulting putative peptide (Additional file 1) comprises two exons and one intron, its length is 295 residues
and its genomic position downstream of HoxC3a (Additional file 2) strongly suggest a potential HoxC1a. Expression data would be needed to support this prediction.
HoxPred has previously been applied on the teleost fish
Gasterosteus aculeatus proteome to characterise its Hox
gene content [2]. We have shown that this fish comprises
a putative HoxC1a gene partially supported by EST evidence. We performed pairwise alignments between fulllength HoxC1a protein sequences detected in teleosts. The
Neosteleost A. burtoni and G. aculeatus HoxC1a are very
similar with 66% identity. On the contrary, A. burtoni
HoxC1a only shares 30% identity with the Ostariophysii
zebrafish HoxC1a, in the homeodomain for the most
part.
Phylogenetic analyses in paralogous group 1
Phylogenetic reconstructions of PG1 homeodomains
from teleost species were conducted as in [2], with the
addition of A. burtoni and Fundulus heteroclitus sequences.
The HoxC1a sequence recently reported in the Ostariophysii Megalobrama amblycephala [5] was not included as
the PCR fragment does not comprise the homeodomain.

Phylogenetic analyses confirm that Astatotilapia burtoni
comprises a putative HoxC1a gene (Figure 1). In the frame
of novel HoxC1a sequences, these phylogenetic tree
reconstructions refine the analysis of F. heteroclitus PG1
PCR fragments [6] and provide additional evidence to
confirm the classification previously proposed in [7].
Fishing HoxC1a pseudogenes out of teleost genomes
The Neoteleosts HoxC1a genes we have identified provide
a more comprehensive set of sequences that can be used
to investigate HoxC1a pseudogenes in teleost sequences.
We have analysed the region downstream HoxC3a of the
medaka Oryzia latipes in search of a putative HoxC1a gene.

region did not return any potential Hox gene with HoxPred. GeneWise alignments of O. latipes genomic
sequence with G. aculeatus and A. burtoni HoxC1a proteins
nevertheless highlight a genomic region in O. latipes, corresponding to both N- and C-terminal portions of the
proteins (see Additional file 2 for genomic positions). As
the homeodomain is highly degenerate and contains a
frameshift mutation, we argue in favor of a HoxC1a pseudogene in medaka.
We performed similar analyses on the genomic sequences
of pufferfishes (Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis) and observed imprints of HoxC1a pseudogenes in
both cases. For T. rubripes, this finding is in agreement
with the HoxC1a pseudogene described in [9]. For T.
nigroviridis, no HoxC1a pseudogene has been reported yet,
and a previous attempt to identify a functional HoxC1a
gene was unsuccessful [7].

HoxC1a gene loss in the teleost Hox clusters
Based on the sole presence of HoxC1a gene in zebrafish,
Hoegg et al suggest that HoxC1a has been lost once in the
lineage leading to Neoteleosts (as illustrated in figure 3 in
[1]). Presence of this gene in both G. aculeatus and A. burtoni rejects this hypothesis. Figure 2 is a comprehensive
overview of the current HoxC1a set of orthologs in teleosts, according to our results based on publicly available
data. We have mapped HoxC1a gene loss events on the
phylogeny reported in [1]. It indicates that HoxC1a has
been lost independently among Neoteleosts, in both lineages leading to O. latipes and to the pufferfishes. Whether
an additional HoxC1a gene loss has occurred in the lineage leading to the cichlid fish Oreochromis niloticus
remains to be investigated.

Conclusion
Oryzia latipes

Neoteleostei

We have constructed mVista plots [10] as performed in [1]
to highlight conserved non-coding sequences downstream of HoxC3a with a comparative genomic approach
(Additional file 3). As previously noted by Hoegg et al, we
observe a high similarity between G. aculeatus and A. burtoni. This plot also shows a high similarity between the
Neoteleost pseudogenes and putative genes, whereas
zebrafish HoxC1a sequence is clearly less similar.

Overview of HoxC1a content in teleost species and
gene loss events mapped on a phylogeny. HoxC1a
genes are depicted with stars. Dashed lines indicate that corresponding species were not reported in [1] and their position in the phylogeny is hypothetic.

A. burtoni was reported to contain 46 Hox genes. We have
complemented the Hox gene content of this fish with a
putative HoxC1a gene. Combined with the detection of
HoxC1a orthologs in G. aculeatus and F. heteroclitus, we
introduce here a more comprehensive set of HoxC1a
genes in teleosts. These Neoteleost genes facilitate the
investigation of pseudogenes in O. latipes and pufferfishes
in comparison with the more distant zebrafish ortholog.
We report two novel HoxC1a pseudogenes, in O. latipes
and T. nigroviridis respectively. In addition, this case-study
illustrates the annotation challenge posed by the Hox
multigenic family. We have shown that Hox identification
can be improved by combining several gene-finding
methods and a Hox-dedicated program.
This comment has hopefully given new insights into the
gene loss events presented by Hoegg et al, as regards to
HoxC1a. Our results modify their conclusions and rule
out the hypothesis of a unique HoxC1a gene loss event in
the lineage leading to Neoteleosts. We propose that
HoxC1a was independently lost in the lineage leading to
O. latipes and in the lineage leading to pufferfishes. Our
findings do not affect other aspects of the Hoegg et al
study, especially the fact that each teleost species studied
so far contains a different Hox gene set. Rather, we believe
that this contribution reinforces their conclusions about
non-essential Hox genes that can be easily and repeatedly
lost like HoxB7a or HoxC1a.
