A copy number variation in human NCF1 and
its pseudogenes
Tiffany Brunson, Qingwei Wang, Isfahan Chambers, Qing Song*

Abstract
Background: Neutrophil cytosolic factor-1 (NCF1) is a component of NADPH oxidase. The NCF1 gene colocalizes
with two pseudogenes (NCF1B and NCF1C). These two pseudogenes have a GT deletion in exon 2, resulting in a
frameshift and an early stop codon. Here, we report a copy number variation (CNV) of the NCF1 pseudogenes and
their alternative spliced expressions.
Results: We examined three normal populations (86 individuals). We observed the 2:2:2 pattern (NCF1B:NCF1:
NCF1C) in only 26 individuals. On average, each African- American has 1.4 ± 0.8 (Mean ± SD) copies of NCF1B and
2.3 ± 0.6 copies of NCF1C; each Caucasian has 1.8 ± 0.7 copies of NCF1B and 1.9 ± 0.4 copies of NCF1C; and each
Mexican has 1.6 ± 0.6 copies of NCF1B and 1.0 ± 0.4 copies of NCF1C. Mexicans have significantly less NCF1C
copies than African-Americans (p = 6e-15) and Caucasians (p = 3e-11). Mendelian transmission of this CNV was
observed in two CEPH pedigrees. Moreover, we cloned two alternative spliced transcripts generated from these
two pseudogenes that adopt alternative exon-2 instead of their defective exon 2. The NCF1 pseudogene
expression responded robustly to PMA induction during macrophage differentiation. NCF1B decreased from 32.9%
to 8.3% in the cDNA pool transcribed from 3 gene copies. NCF1Ψs also displayed distinct expression patterns in
different human tissues.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that these two pseudogenes may adopt an alternative exon-2 in different tissues
and in response to external stimuli. The GT deletion is insufficient to define them as functionless pseudogenes; this
CNV may have biological relevance.

Background
Recent genomic studies suggested that gene duplication
occurred frequently and in variable numbers during the
recent history of human populations, which has led to
de novo formations of copy number variation (CNV)
[1]. Presumably due to positive selection, genes encoding certain protein categories are particularly enriched
in CNVs, such as those involved in processes related to
environmental responses [1-8]. In this process, duplicated genes are thought to be the “successful” copies;
pseudogenes are those “unsuccessful” duplicates retained
in the genome [1].
Neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (NCF1, also called
p47phox, for phagocyte oxidase), is a crucial component
of NADPH oxidase [9]. This enzyme catalyzes the production of microbicidal superoxide in phagocytes such

as neutrophil and plays a vital role in host defense
against microbial pathogens [10,11]. A 2-bp GT deletion
in exon 2 of the NCF1 gene causes chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in humans [12,13]. NCF1 is
expressed in many cell types and may play a role in
many other diseases [14-19].
The human NCF1 gene is located at 7q11.23, the Williams Beurens Syndrome region [20-22], accompanied
by two nearly identical (>99.5%) pseudogenes (NCF1B
and NCF1C) which presumably arose by gene duplication [23]. These two pseudogenes have the same signature sequence as the one in the NCF1 gene responsible
for CGD, the 2-bp GT deletion in exon 2 [13,23,24].
This mutation leads to a frameshift and a premature
stop codon and thus these two gene duplicates were
categorized as pseudogenes. It has been noticed that the
NCF1Ψ/NCF1 ratio vary in human individuals, and it
was believed some NCF1Ψ gene copies contain the
wild-type NCF1 exon 2 sequence [22,25].

In this study, we examined the copy numbers of NCF1
pseudogenes in human populations and found a copy
number variation (CNV). Our additional data revealed
that these two pseudogenes can generate RNA transcripts that skip over their defective exon 2 by alternative splicing.

Results
Copy Number Variation of NCF1 and NCF1Ψ

There are three large highly homologous duplicons at the
NCF1 locus (Figure 1). According to their chromosomal
positions (UCSC Human Assembly 2006 March, chr7:72,
272,547-72,287,915 [pseudogene], chr7:73,826,245-73,
841,595 [NCF1], chr7:74,210,381-74,225,753 [pseudogene]), we designated two NCF1 pseudogene duplicons as
NCF1B and NCF1C, respectively. These duplicons share a
106-kb sequence with >99.5% similarities spanning from
-45 kb at 5’-end to +46 kb at 3’-end regarding the NCF1
coding region. NCF1 or NCF1C duplicons share an additional 3’-flanking sequence until +82 kb (Figure 1). In contrast to the human genome, NCF1 is a single-copy gene in
the reference genomes of all other species, such as chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, rat and mouse (UCSC Genome
Assemblies). The phylogenetic tree revealed that NCF1B
and NCF1C duplicated after they arose from the NCF1
gene (Figure 2).
To determine the relative copy numbers of NCF1B,
NCF1, and NCF1C, we genotyped the genomic DNA of
human subjects at two particular positions, the signature
2-bp GT deletion in exon 2, and an A/G substitution in
exon-9, in which NCF1B and NCF1 has an A allele, and
NCF1C has a G allele (Figure 1 and Additional file 1). Pyrosequencing is a high-throughput technology that can be
used for accurate determination of the allele frequency in
pooled DNA [26]. Based on the pyrogram peak heights,
we assessed the allele composition of each individual with
the PyroMarkID Software v1.0 (Additional file 2).

We analyzed 86 non-related individuals (32 AfricanAmericans [AA], 30 Caucasians [Cau] and 24 Mexicans
[Mex]). Totally we observed 6 different NCF1Ψ/NCF1
ratios in these normal populations (Figure 3a and Additional file 3). The 4:2 ratio (4 pseudogenes & 2 NCF1 in
each genome) are predominant in AA (71.9%) and Caucasians (56.1%), but rare in Mexicans (4.2%), instead, the
3:2 (50.0%) and 2:2 (41.7%) genotypes are common in
Mexicans. Interestingly, the Mexican population has an
additional genotype (4.2%), 1:2, which contains only one
pseudogene copy in each genome.
Using the genotyping pyrograms at exon 2 (GT/GTGT/
GT) [NCF1B/NCF1/NCF1C] and exon 9 (A/A/G), we
were able to further dissect the copy numbers of two
pseudogenes in each genome (see Additional file 3). On
average, each AA individual has 1.4 ± 0.8 (Mean ± SD)
copies of NCF1B, 2.1 ± 0.7 copies of NCF1, and 2.3 ±
0.6 copies of NCF1C; each Caucasian has 1.8 ± 0.7
copies of NCF1B, 2.1 ± 0.3 copies of NCF1, and 1.9 ±
0.4 copies of NCF1C; and each Mexican genome has
1.6 ± 0.6 copies of NCF1B, 2.1 ± 0.3 copies of NCF1,
and 1.0 ± 0.4 copies of NCF1C. There is a significant
difference on the copy number of NCF1C among these
3 human populations (Figure 3c and 3d), in which Mexicans have significantly less copies of NCF1C than AA
(p = 6e-15) and Cau (p = 3e-11). There is also a significant difference on the copy number of NCF1B
between Cau and AA (p = 0.033).
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid
cells lines are widely used as a genomic resource for
many human genetic studies. However, chromosomal
instability, which can cause a duplication or deletion in
the host or viral genome sequences flanking the integration sites, is increased by viral integration [27]. In order
to eliminate the possibility that this CNV is just an artifact in lymphoblastoid cell lines, we analyzed 48 genomic DNA samples directly extracted from human

Figure 1 Genomic organization of the NCF1 gene locus at 7q11.23 in the human genome. There are 3 large duplicons (arrow blocks) at
this locus; the arrow directions illustrate the NCF1 or NCF1Ψ transcription orientations. According to their genomic positions, we designated
those two pseudogene duplicons as NCF1B and NCF1C. These duplicons share a 106-kb sequence with >99.5% similarities spanning from -45 kb
at 5’-end to +46 kb at 3’-end regarding the NCF1/NCF1Ψ coding region. NCF1 and NCF1B duplicons share an additional 3’-flanking sequence
until +82 kb. The signature difference between NCF1 and its pseudogenes, the 2-bp GT deletion, is showed by GTGT at NCF1 and GT at NCF1B
and NCF1C. Another nucleotide difference between duplicons, an A/G substitution in exon-9, is also indicated above the arrow blocks. The
transposons at the boundaries of these duplicons are indicated.

3:2 ratios (1.53+ 0.141) and 3 individuals had 1:1 ratios.
This data confirmed the presence of this CNV.
Heritability of NCF1 Copy Number Variation

Two large CEPH families were used to examine the
heritability of this CNV detected at the NCF1 locus
(Figure 4). The majority of the members in family 1331

have a 2:1 ΔGT/GTGT ratio as represented by a 4:2
ratio in a diploid genome, which was further determined
as a 1:2:3 proportion (NCF1B: NCF1: NCF1C); one
family member, the paternal grandmother, has a 0:2:3
ratio. Family 1362 is particularly interesting as both
maternal and paternal lineages have very different
NCF1B:NCF1:NCF1C ratios. The paternal lineage has an
unvarying 4:2 ratio (1:2:3) where as the maternal lineage
has a continuous 2:2 (0:2:2) ratio. Based on the potential
haplogenotypes deduced from the pedigrees, we

observed a clear allele transmission pattern of this CNV
in both families, suggesting a heritability of this CNV;
however, our data cannot exclude the de novo formation of new copy numbers of this CNV in other families.
The clear inheritance of the copy numbers in these two
large pedigrees also suggests that there is no large
experimental bias on the copy number measurement.
Transcription and Alternative Splicing of NCF1Ψ and
NCF1 Genes

We explored if these two NCF1 pseudogenes are transcriptionally active. Pyrosequencing was used to quantify
the NCF1/NCF1Ψs compositions in the mRNAs of 14
single-donor lymphoblastoid cell lines by genotyping the
signature 2-bp GT deletion in cDNA (Figure 5). Interestingly, although NCF1Ψs have more copies than NCF1
in each individual, they made much less GT-containing

transcripts than NCF1. For example, in the individual-6
who has 4 copies of NCF1Ψs and 2 copies of NCF1,
pseudogenes collectively only contributed the amount of
transcripts equal to half of the amount from the NCF1
gene copy (as revealed by the ratio 0.5:1 in cDNA).
By PCR, cloning and direct DNA sequencing, we have
experimentally discovered two novel alternative exons
(GenBank: GU215077, GU215078) located in the intron1 (Additional file 5). Neither of these two new alternative splicing transcripts used the GT-containing exon-2
(Figure 6b), and both of them were made from the
NCF1Ψs copies as revealed by their nucleotide
sequences (Figure 6c). We have searched for putative
open reading frames with the NCBI ORF Finder. Sub1
showed a continuous ORF without a stop codon, thus
the full-length transcript containing this alternative splicing pattern may produce a long ORF. Sub2 contains

Figure 5 Relative quantities of expression of NCF1 and its pseudogene. The relative proportion of gene expression of NCF1 and NCF1Ψs
(GTGT or GT containing transcripts) was measured by genotyping the cDNA samples from LCLs of 14 human individuals at the signature GT
deletion. Two pseudogenes collectively contribute to lesser amount of transcript than from one NCF1 gene copy alone (0.3-0.7):1 [NCF1Ψ/NCF1,
the [GT]/[GTGT] ratio) (yellow bars). The [GT]/[GTGT] ratios in genomic DNA are shown by the green bars. Three independent experiments were
performed in duplicates.

NCF1Ψ and NCF1 Transcription in Monocyte
Differentiation

Monocytes/Macrophages have been implicated in atherosclerosis [28]. After treatment with 800 ng/ml PMA for
12 hrs, the monocytes became adherent and acquired a
macrophage-like phenotype. Both monocytes and
macrophages have NCF1B:NCF1:NCF1C genomic copy
number ratios of 2:2:2 (Figure 7a). After macrophage
differentiation, quantitative RT-PCR experiments (RTqPCR) were performed to measure the transcripts with
the “GT-containing” exon 2 using primers that recognize all three NCF1 genes. The results showed that the
NCF1/NCF1Ψs total GT-containing expression is
slightly upregulated 1.34-fold (GAPDH, p = 0.024) to
1.82 fold (b-actin, p = 0.006) (Figure 7b). However, the
relative contributions of each pseudogenes and the
NCF1 gene copy to the GT-containing transcript pool
were altered dramatically. NCF1B decreased from 32.9%
to 8.3%, whereas NCF1 increased from 52.7% to 80.4%
(Figure 7c).

NCF1Ψ Expressions in Human Tissues

We measured the NCF1B:NCF1:NCF1C transcript ratios
by pyrosequencing the signature GT deletion in cDNAs
generated from different human tissues. We observed
that NCF1B and NCF1C expressions (GT-containing
transcripts) varied dramatically in different human tissues (Figure 8). For example, skin produced the highest
contribution of NCF1B relative to NCF1 expression,
whereas pancreas produced the least amount of NCF1B.
Spleen and lymph node produced the highest contribution of NCF1B, whereas lung and brain produced the
least amount of NCF1C.

Discussion
In this study, we report the existence of a NCF1 pseudogene CNV in human. The pseudogene copy numbers are
apparently different among three human populations
(African-Americans, Caucasians, and Mexicans). The
CNV existence is validated by observance in genomic
DNA extracted directly from human peripheral white
blood cells. The NCF1 CNV inheritance found in the two
family pedigrees, suggest that the chromosomal instability
at this locus may not be high. Our phylogenetic analysis

implies the existence of the NCF1 gene prior to the divergence of those two pseudogene duplicates, the NCF1 pseudogenes may emerge after the divergence of human and
chimpanzee lineages. These data suggest that this NCF1
pseudogene CNV may be a consequence of recent gene
duplications in human history [1].
Pseudogenes have long been considered to be ‘dead’
nonfunctional byproducts of genome evolution [29].
They were defined as genomic sequences that are similar to a functional gene but contain genetic defects that
preclude the generation of functional products [30-32].
Recent findings have prompted to revise the definition
of pseudogenes, which are now defined as genomic
sequences that arise from functional genes but cannot
encode the same type of functional products (i.e. protein, tRNA or rRNA) as the original genes [29]. Human
genome is estimated to contain ~20,000 pseudogenes
[33], it will be important to know how many and which
pseudogenes are functional. Recently emphasis has been
placed on polymorphisms such as CNV that has been

documented to play a role in disease pathogenesis
[34-39]. It has not been reported that a CNV of a pseudogene is biologically relevant. Historically, the NCF1
pseudogenes are considered “pseudo” because of their
2-bp GT deletion in exon 2, which is predicted to cause a
frameshift and an early stop codon in protein synthesis.
In our analysis of GT-containing transcript, the pseudogenes were far less active. However, our data revealed for
the first time that a portion of NCF1 pseudogene transcripts do not utilize their defective exon-2, instead, they
may use alternative exons to skip over their mutant
exon-2 (Figure 6). When we measured transcript exclusive to exon-2, the NCF1 pseudogenes had varying transcriptional capacities that responded robustly to PMA
induced macrophage differentiation (Figure 7) and
showed distinct expression patterns in different human
tissues (Figure 8). These observations prompted us to
wonder if these NCF1 pseudogenes are “functional” or
“unsuccessful duplicates”. Recent studies have showed
that ~95% of multi-exon genes undergo tissue-specific

alternative splicing [40-42]; on the other hand, genes can
also function by making regulatory non-coding RNAs in
addition to making proteins [43]. These results certainly
challenge the current perception of the NCF1
pseudogenes.
We observed differential expression of NCF1 and its
pseudogenes and a varying contribution of the genes
to the total transcript pool (Figure 5, 7, and 8). It may
be caused by differential alternative splicing patterns,
different promoter activities, and/or differential mRNA
degradation. As indicated by sequence alignment with
ClustalW2, the 5’ untranslated regions of the NCF1
pseudogenes are nearly identical to the equivalent
region of NCF1 (Additional file 7). Collectively, putative binding sites of 45 transcription factors (TFBS)
were predicted with rVISTA (Additional file 7). The
number and exact locations of these TFBS are also
nearly identical among these three genes (Additional
file 7), except that the NCF1 gene contains 19 AML1
TFBS and 4 CREB TFBS instead of the 18 AML1 sites
and 3 CREB sites in both pseudogenes. Our data suggest that a portion of pseudogene transcripts did not
adopt the GT-containing exon-2, which may explain
our observation that NCF1 pseudogenes displayed
fewer GT-containing transcripts relative to the true
NCF1 gene. However, we are unclear if differential

promoter activities and mRNA degradation contribute
to this observation.
The CGD patients have shown that NCF1 is essential
in the function of the neutrophil in the first line of host
defense against many pathogenic bacteria and fungi.
About 93% of humans patients caused by NCF1 mutations are homozygous for the 2-bp GT deletion [12,13].
Obviously the NCF1 pseudogenes, are not simply replacement duplicates, otherwise they may have compensated for the loss of NCF1 gene copies in the CGD
patients. Two recent studies have reported that less
copies of NCF1 pseudogenes may produce more reactive
oxygen intermediates [44] and may exaggerate certain
diseases involving inflammatory process such as inflammatory bowel disease [45]. Therefore, these two NCF1
pseudogenes may produce protein isoforms or small
RNAs that act as inhibitors of the normal NCF1 function. Superoxide is a double-edged sword, it is essential
for phagocytes to exert their bactericidal function, but
in excess it is also toxic to our own cells. Cells in other
tissues would benefit from the existence of these two
pseudogenes if they could recognize different stimuli
and then reduce the NCF1/NADPH oxidase activity and
superoxide production accordingly. For example, they
may help to reduce the inflammatory process during
atherosclerosis.

Conclusions
Taken together this study reported the existence of an
NCF1 pseudogene CNV in three normal populations.
These NCF1 pseudogenes are actively transcribed in
human tissues. They can produce transcripts using alternative exon-2 instead of their defective exon-2. These
results prompt us to re-consider their non-functional
status in pseudogenes classification [29]. The functional
contribution of the NCF1 pseudogenes to NCF1 function and the pathological relevance of this copy number
variation will merit further investigations.
Methods
Subjects and Materials

Genomic DNAs of 86 unrelated individual DNA samples (The Human Variation Panels, 32 African-Americans [AA], 30 Caucasians [Cau], and 24 Mexicans
[Mex]) and 2 CEPH/UTAH pedigrees (1331 and 1362)
were obtained from The Coriell Cell Repositories. Single-donor Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were obtained from two
sources: The Coriell Cell Repositories and The Emory
Zafari Collection (kindly provided by Dr. Zafari of
Emory Cardiology) [46]. Genomic DNAs of 48 unrelated
healthy individuals directly extracted from peripheral
blood cells instead of LCLs were kindly provided by Dr.
Kittner of University of Maryland [47]. A human monocyte cell line THP-1 was purchased from ATCC (TIB202). Total RNAs from human tissues were purchased
from Clontech and US Biological. Phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Krackler Scientific (Cat. No. P1585). All subjects provided informed
consent, and the study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Morehouse School of Medicine.
Cell Culture

Lymphoblastoid cells and THP-1 cells were grown in
RMPI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. The differentiation of THP1 monocytes into macrophages was induced by incubation in 800 ng/ml of PMA for 12 hours. The non-adherent cells were removed by aspiration; adherent cells
were allowed to differentiate for 3-4 days.
Genomic DNA and Total RNA Extraction

Genomic DNA was extracted from lymphoblastoid cells
following a standard protocol described previously [48].
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was generated with 1 μg of
total RNA using the Superscript III-RT system
(Invitrogen).

Genotyping

Genomic DNA and cDNA were subjected to genotyping
at the 2-bp GT deletion in Exon-2 and a 1-bp difference
in Exon-9 (Figure 1). PCR and pyrosequencing primers
are provided in Additional file 8. These primers were
designed to recognize both NCF1 and its pseudogenes
without discrimination. The PCR products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure PCR specificity. Genotyping was carried out with a pyrosequencer
(PSQ96MA, Pyrosequencing, Uppsala, Sweden) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, a 20 μL PCR
reaction was carried out with either genomic DNA or
cDNA. PCR products were then denatured and singlestrand DNA templates were collected with streptavidincoated Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). A pyrosequencing primer was added and pyrosequencing was
performed in an automated PSQ96MA instrument. The
pyrogram peak heights were evaluated per individual to
give an accurate count of allele ratios using the PyroMarkID Software v1.0 provided by the manufacturer.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-qPCR)

RT-qPCR was carried out using a LightCycler thermocycler (Roche) and a SYBR green kit (Roche). Oligo-dT
primers were used in the reverse transcription, their
sequences are provided in Additional file 8. Cycle numbers obtained at the log-linear phase of the reaction
were plotted against a standard curve prepared with
serially diluted control samples. Expressions of target
genes were normalized by GAPDH and b-actin levels.
The RT-qPCR amplification specificity of the NCF1-specific primer set is shown in Additional file 9.
Statistical Analysis

All data is expressed as Mean ± Standard Deviation
(SD). Student’s t test was used in the setting of multiple
comparisons where the appropriate and statistical significance is defined as p ≤ 0.05.
Bioinformatic analysis

Nucleotide sequences were retrieved from The UCSC
Genome Browser (Human Assembly 2006 March).
Sequence alignments were performed using multiple
sequence alignment with MAP http://www.ebi.ac.uk/

Additional file 4: Copy number variation at the NCF1 locus
observed in genomic DNA samples extracted directly from
peripheral white blood cells. In order to eliminate the possibility that
this CNV is an artefact caused by chromosomal instability in
lymphoblastoid cell lines, we analyzed 48 genomic DNA samples directly
extracted from human peripheral white blood cells. Means of 3
independent experiments performed in duplicate.

Additional file 5: cDNA sequences of alternatively spliced exons. By
PCR, cloning and direct DNA sequencing, we have experimentally
discovered two novel alternative exons (GenBank: GU215077, GU215078)
located in the intron-1. Neither of these two transcripts used the GTcontaining exon-2.

Additional file 6: Putative open reading frames of alternative
spliced transcripts. The open reading frame (ORF) of two alternative
spliced products, sub1 and sub2, were predicted with the NCBI ORF
Finder.

Additional file 7: Putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)
of the human NCF1 gene and its pseudogenes. A 20 kb sequence of
5’-flanking region of each of NCF1 and its pseudogenes (immediately
upstream to exon 1) was retrieved from UCSC Genome Browser.
Sequence alignment was performed with EMBL-EBI CLUSTAL 2.0.12
(Larkin et al., 2007). Putative TFBS was predicted with rVISTA (Loots et al.,
2002) using the vertebrates TRANSFAC matrices and cut-off 1.0 for both
matrix similarity and core similarity.
