Abstract
Background: Slow-fast analysis is a simple and effective method to reduce the influence of
substitution saturation, one of the causes of phylogenetic noise and long branch attraction (LBA)
artifacts. In several steps of increasing stringency, the slow-fast analysis omits the fastest
substituting alignment positions from the analysed dataset and thus increases its signal/noise ratio.
Results: Our program SlowFaster automates the process of assessing the substitution rate of the
alignment positions and the process of producing new alignments by deleting the saturated
positions. Its use is very simple. It goes through the whole process in several steps: data input –
necessary choices – production of new alignments.
Conclusion: SlowFaster is a user-friendly tool providing new alignments prepared with slow-fast
analysis. These data can be used for further phylogenetic analyses with lower risk of long branch
attraction artifacts.

Background
The long branch attraction (LBA) artifact [1] still remains
one of important causes of biases and mistakes in phylogenetic analyses of sequence data [2]. LBA causes taxa with
long branches to be artifactually grouped with or attracted
to other long branched taxa (i.e., fast evolving taxa or taxa
evolving for a long time separate from other groups, e.g.
outgroups). An important source of LBA is substitution
saturation of positions in alignment (the term "mutational saturation" is also used, although it is not correct in
this context). It would be ideal to have positions that
underwent a single or a few changes during evolution, but
many positions in real alignments are subject to multiple

substitutions. This subset of rapidly evolving positions is
the source of stochastic noise rather than useful signal.
However, these saturated positions are responsible for a
major part of information used in phylogenetic analyses
[3], which could confuse most of the tree-reconstructing
methods. Because there are only four possible states for
nucleic acid data (20 for amino acids), it is probable that
a part of saturated positions will evolve randomly – convergently into the same state. It could then be erroneously
judged as a synapomorphy. LBA can thus be a major problem especially in maximum parsimony, but occurs also in
other analyses [4]. Maximum likelihood can, under an
appropriate model of evolution, deal better with saturated

positions, but datasets containing sites with different rates
of substitution across the tree (covarion-like) may still be
problematic [5]. Besides LBA, a high level of saturation in
the dataset may cause signal simply to be overwhelmed by
noise at least at some points of the tree topology. Such
nodes could be resolved incorrectly or (at least) with a low
statistical support.
It has been shown that in real alignments, LBA can be a
major problem [2]. An effective way to estimate and
reduce the effect of substitution saturation and LBA is
removal of fast-evolving data. One such method is slowfast analysis of the dataset [6]. The positions of the alignment are divided into several classes according to their
substitution rate (estimated within a priori defined monophyletic groups). Several new alignments are then created,
which contain only positions with a substitution rate
lower than several thresholds, ranging from maximum to
minimum rate. Thus the signal/noise ratio of the alignments successively increases, however, on the expense of
amount of positions included in the alignment. Technically, the Slow-Fast method needs some input tree topology to work with. The topology must be provided by
primary phylogenetic analysis of the dataset or by another
independent method. This topology is needed for recognition of some monophyletic groups (whose relative positions on the tree is not necessary to know before slow-fast
analysis). Maximum parsimony is then used to determine
the number of changes for each position within the
monophyletic subgroups. Substitution rates assigned to
positions are thus independent from interrelationships
among the monophyletic groups, and therefore, these
interrelationships may in turn be investigated without the
fear of circularity. When each position is assigned its
number of changes, those with the highest substitution
rate are gradually omitted from new alignments. The following phylogenetic analyses of these new datasets (starting from the dataset containing the positions with the
highest substitution rate) then provide results based on
decreasing number of sequence data, however, with
decreasing risk of artefactual groupings of long branches.
There are several good examples of successful use of slowfast analysis, see e.g. [6-11].
Although the slow-fast analysis is relatively powerful and
very simple in principle, it is quite demanding when one
wants to determine the number of changes for individual
alignment positions (e.g., with the help of PAUP [12],
using the "describetree" command) and the manual procedure of deleting of positions by editing the dataset is
especially very time consuming. We believe that this is
one of the most important reasons why this method is
used relatively scarcely. Clearly, a computer program that
provides this evaluation of positions and which produces
new alignments would be handy. To our knowledge, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/341

only software providing slow-fast analysis have been
MUST [13]. MUST is a complex package, yet it still does
not provide a quick and easily operated tool for this type
of analysis. This is what our program SlowFaster does. It is
a user-friendly tool to conduct slow-fast analysis and produce a set of new alignments without fast evolving positions. It have several additional functions. Note that
another program for slow-fast analysis was presented
recently [11].

Implementation
SlowFaster was programmed in Borland Delphi and runs
under MS Windows. Both the executable file [see Additional file 1] and the source code [see Additional file 2] are
available as supplements. The program leads the user in
several steps through the process of generating new datasets. Original alignment is loaded in FASTA, Phylip or
NEXUS format. The program works with both nucleic acid
and amino acid alignments and supports usual ambiguity
coding. The topology needed for the recognition of
monophyla is loaded as a tree in the Newick ("bracketed")
format (PAUP users can use "savetree format = phylip"
command to obtain tree in Newick format). After choosing the monophyletic groups by simply clicking on the
branches of the depicted tree, parsimony is used to count
the number of changes of every alignment position within
the selected groups. Finally, new alignments are produced
(in FASTA, Phylip or NEXUS format). Each of the new
datasets has a number which is a threshold: positions with
greater number of changes were omitted from this dataset.
As the threshold gets lower and lower, the datasets contain fewer and fewer data because the more saturated positions were deleted from them. These datasets can be then
further analysed to obtain phylogenies with a lower risk of
LBA. During the whole process, there are hints shown in a
window, telling the user what to do in the given step.
The software was tested thoroughly on several model
datasets [see Additional file 3] and also on dataset of
Hampl et al. [10]. In this latter case, we obtained the same
new datasets with our program (Hampl et al. obtained
them with the help of PAUP and through careful manual
deletion of positions).
An interesting alternative to slow-fast method is using
substitution rates estimated with maximum likelihood
(ML). Although ML estimates are not implemented in
SlowFaster, this program enables production of alignments without positions with high rates through the
"Load changes" button. The rates can be counted in
another software. E.g. Tree-Puzzle [14], if rate heterogeneity is selected, gives information on the rate category of
each position in its outfile under "Combination of categories that contributes the most to the likelihood". These
data can be simply copied in a file which is then loaded in

SlowFaster. New alignments are then produced directly
from these data. More generally, any sequence of any
(even real) numbers can be loaded and the software will
divide positions in rate categories (their number is specified by the user) based on these values.
The program also creates a log file which contains useful
information, most notably groups used for changes
counting, list of positions with certain number of changes
and number of changes for all positions from the first one
to the last.

Results and discussion
Sample Data
As an example, we analysed an alignment of 34 SSU rDNA
sequences of 31 isolates of Blastocystis + 3 outgroups. Blastocystis is an unusual protist, a sister group of slopalinids
(used as the outgroup) within the group of stramenopiles.
See e.g. [15,16] for a review of Blastocystis. Although these
nonflagellated, multinucleated gut commensals comprise
a single genus, their SSU rDNA phylogeny shows clearly
that they are rather long branched taxa in comparison to
other stramenopiles. Their branches are even longer than,
for example, branches separating classes of autotrophic
stramenopiles. This group is therefore suspected of a high
level of substitution saturation. We sequenced SSU rRNA
genes of five Blastocystis isolated from tortoises to improve
taxon sampling by increasing the number of non-mammalian and non-bird isolates in the analysis (the vast
majority of Blastocystis sequences available in GenBank are
from bird or mammalian isolates). The accession numbers of the five new sequences (GERA3b, GERA3a,
GECA2, KINIX2 and GEPA2) are [GenBank:EF209016],
[GenBank:EF209018],
[Gen[GenBank:EF209017],
Bank:EF209019] and [GenBank:EF209020], respectively.

The alignment was prepared with ClustalX [17] and
ambiguous parts with many indels were deleted from the
alignment in the program BioEdit [18]. The resulting
alignment contained 1471 positions. PAUP 4.0β10 [12]
was used to analyse the dataset employing maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), the Fitch-Margoliash method with LogDet distances (LD) and
maximum likelihood distances (MD). Appropriate models for maximum likelihood were chosen with the help of
Modeltest [19]. The robustness of each obtained topology
was tested by bootstrapping (1000 replicates for all methods except for ML, for which 100 replicates were used).
Phylogenetic analyses resulted in the tree shown in fig. 1.
Two deep nodes of the phylogeny were resolved with low
bootstrap support and/or resolved differently by different
methods and were therefore depicted and treated as unresolved trichotomies.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/341

Use of SlowFaster
At this time, our SlowFaster program was employed to
perform the slow-fast analysis. First, the alignment used in
our analyses was loaded via the "Load alignment" button.
Then the tree topology shown in fig. 1 was loaded via the
"Load tree" button. In typical slow-fast analyses, several
monophyletic subgroups are chosen in this step. We
decided to select the single subtree of all Blastocystis isolates. This arrangement was enabled by the fact that we
were mostly interested in resolving the two nodes represented in the input tree by trichotomies. Assigning substitution rates to alignment positions was thus independent
from the true topology of these nodes. When the Blastocystis-containing subgroup was chosen in the tree window
of SlowFaster program, new datasets in NEXUS format
were created by clicking the "New alignments" button.
Also, alignments of the same length as these new datasets,
but shortened by random deletion of positions, were prepared by checking the "jackknives" checkbox on the program screen. These were used to test whether the loss of
informative positions influences decrease of bootstrap
support of the resulting tree topology more than shortening the datasets itself. We did not use the "Weights" feature of the program. When this checkbox is checked, the
algorithm will assign different weights to changes within
different chosen monophyletic groups. Changes within
smaller groups would have assigned greater weight (if
group A is twice as taxon-rich as group B, changes within
it will have half the weight of the weight of changes in
group B). The impact of large monophyla is then not
dominant just because they contain more taxa.

The maximum number of observed changes in a position
of our alignment was 9. Thus, nine new alignments were
created. They were labeled BlastoS8 down to BlastoS0,
where the number is the threshold. BlastoS0 alignment
was of course of no use in this particular case (the analysis
with just one monophyletic group) as it contained only
those positions that did not change during the evolution
of Blastocystis. All other alignments were analysed phylogenetically by all four methods (ML, MP, LD, MD) and
topologies of the 32 resulting trees were bootstrapped.
It is highly probable that in some point of the slow-fast
analysis, the profit from diminishing noise is lower than
the loss from diminishing information. To roughly estimate the effect of the lack of information, we used average
values of bootstraps as a measure of reliability of the
alignments [10]. We found that this average value drops
suddenly for the alignment BlastoS1 which is therefore
likely to suffer from lack of information and the resulting
trees obtained from this dataset were not taken into
account. To further prove this decision, "jackknifed" datasets of the same length but shortened by random deletion

Bootstrap support values for four tree-reconstructing methods – ML, MP, LD and MD, respectively – are shown at the nodes. The symbol "+" is used for bootstrap support 99
and higher (in case only one "+" symbol is present, all methods scored such a high support). The effect of slow-fast analysis on
nodes is represented by arrow symbols in the figure. Increase of an average bootstrap support by more than 10% of one and
more than one tree-reconstructing method in two datasets (BlastS3 and S2) is marked with "↑" and "↑↑", respectively. Similarly, the decrease of bootstrap support is marked with "↓" and "↓↓" at the particular nodes. Bootstraps of other nodes did not
change dramatically. Except for our five new isolates (GERA3A, GERA3B, GEPA2, GECA2, KINIX2), Blastocystis isolates are
labeled with accession numbers of their SSU rRNA gene sequences.

of position were also analysed. For each of eight datasets
(Blasto_S1 to S8), ten of these randomly shortened datasets were analysed (80 alignments on the whole:
Blasto_J1_1 to J1_10, J2_1 to J2_10, ... J8_1 to
Blasto_J8_10). Within each dataset, the average value of
bootstraps was determined and average of these averages
for ten dataset of the same length were compared to average bootstrap value of the respective dataset resulting
from slow-fast analysis. This comparison showed that the
bootstrap values does not change much when analysing
J8_x down-to J1_x datasets (e.g. all these average values
ranged from 84.76 to 86.36 in ML analyses or from 90.15
to 91.5 in LD). On the contrary, the downfall of bootstraps was much more prominent in Blasto_S1 dataset
when compared to Blasto_S2 – BlastoS8 datasets (e.g.
87.19 for original dataset, 86.90 for Blasto_S2, but 81.13
for Blasto_S1 in ML analyses, or 91.29 and 88.03 vs.
79.13, respectively, for LD).

was applied, both LD and MD favored the first possibility
with reasonable bootstrap support for S3 and S2 datasets.
However, MP and ML were unable to decide on the two
possibilities. We conclude that the "2b" topology is probably correct, although the certainty is not high. For other
nodes, decrease/increase of their bootstrap support from
datasets S3 and S2 is marked in fig. 1.

Conclusion
Overall, the slow-fast analysis, provided by the program
SlowFaster, proved to be a useful tool to solve uncertain
phylogenies by increasing the signal/noise ratio. In the
Blastocystis SSU rDNA tree it was able to make a choice
among competing hypotheses and add more confidence
in some other cases. Our software automates quite timeconsuming slow-fast analysis.

Results concerning the two unresolved trichotomies are
shown in Table 1. The isolate GERA3b grouped either
with the basal branch of three reptile/amphibian isolates
(1a, in fig. 1) or with the rest of Blastocystis (1b). In the
original alignment, the former topology was very well
supported by MP and LD, the latter was weakly supported
by ML and MD. As the most saturated positions were
deleted from alignment, the bootstrap support for topology "1a" decreased slightly in MP, but increased strikingly
in MD and slightly in ML analysis (BlastoS1 not taken into
account). The slow-fast analysis thus supports the "1a"
topology. The second unresolved node concerned a
branch of four reptile/amphibian isolates. Either it was
basal to two major branches of mostly mammal/bird isolates (2b; weakly supported by ML and MP in the original
alignment), or it grouped with one of them (2a; weakly
supported by LD and MD). After the slow-fast method
