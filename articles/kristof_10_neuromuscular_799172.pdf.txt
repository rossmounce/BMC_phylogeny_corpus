Neuromuscular development of Aeolidiella
stephanieae Valdéz, 2005 (Mollusca, Gastropoda,
Nudibranchia)
Alen Kristof1*, Annette Klussmann-Kolb2

Abstract
Background: Studies on the development of the nervous system and the musculature of invertebrates have
become more sophisticated and numerous within the last decade and have proven to provide new insights into
the evolutionary history of organisms. In order to provide new morphogenetic data on opisthobranch gastropods
we investigated the neuromuscular development in the nudibranch Aeolidiella stephanieae Valdéz, 2005 using
immunocytochemistry as well as F-actin labelling in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM).
Results: The ontogenetic development of Aeolidiella stephanieae can be subdivided into 8 stages, each
recognisable by characteristic morphological and behavioural features as well as specific characters of the nervous
system and the muscular system, respectively. The larval nervous system of A. stephanieae includes an apical organ,
developing central ganglia, and peripheral neurons associated with the velum, foot and posterior, visceral part of
the larva. The first serotonergic and FMRFamidergic neural structures appear in the apical organ that exhibits an
array of three sensory, flask-shaped and two non-sensory, round neurons, which altogether disappear prior to
metamorphosis. The postmetamorphic central nervous system (CNS) becomes concentrated, and the rhinophoral
ganglia develop together with the anlage of the future rhinophores whereas oral tentacle ganglia are not found.
The myogenesis in A. stephanieae begins with the larval retractor muscle followed by the accessory larval retractor
muscle, the velar or prototroch muscles and the pedal retractors that all together degenerate during
metamorphosis, and the adult muscle complex forms de novo.
Conclusions: Aeolidiella stephanieae comprises features of the larval and postmetamorphic nervous as well as
muscular system that represent the ground plan of the Mollusca or even the Trochozoa (e. g. presence of the
prototrochal or velar muscle ring). On the one hand, A. stephanieae shows some features shared by all nudibranchs
like the postmetamorphic condensation of the CNS, the possession of rhinophoral ganglia and the lack of oral
tentacle ganglia as well as the de novo formation of the adult muscle complex. On the other hand, the structure
and arrangement of the serotonergic apical organ is similar to other caenogastropod and opisthobranch
gastropods supporting their sister group relationship.

Background
The development of more sophisticated techniques to
study the detailed structures of nervous systems as well
as muscular systems has provided new insights into the
organization of these character complexes and has
yielded so far unknown information to understand the
evolutionary history of organisms. Some of these studies
focussed on the investigation of serotonergic as well as

FMRFamidergic characteristics of the nervous system
utilizing immunocytochemistry in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy [1-9]. Although these
labellings result in an incomplete picture of the nervous
system [10,11], they have shown to provide characters
that facilitate the identification of homologous portions
of the nervous system across different taxa [12-15], thus
being of interest in order to infer phylogenetic hypotheses or reveal insights into evolutionary trends [16-25].
The same holds true for investigations of the development of the muscular system which have been applied

with similar techniques to various invertebrate taxa
including Mollusca [reviewed in Wanninger [25]].
We investigated the development of the central nervous system and the musculature in the nudibranch
Aeolidiella stephanieae Valdéz, 2005 in order to gain
insights into the structure and evolution of these organ
systems.
The Nudibranchia belongs to the Opisthobranchia
which represents a morphologically diverse group of
gastropods occupying a great variety of ecological
niches. Opisthobranchs have a global distribution, but
are restricted almost exclusively to marine habitats with
the only exception being few freshwater acochlidians
[26]. The reduction or loss of the shell, the elaboration
of the head, foot or mantle, and the acquisition of chemical defences are evolutionary trends shared by most
opisthobranch taxa [27]. In consequence, their phylogenetic history is still not satisfactorily unravelled mainly
due to convergent evolution of different character complexes [27,28] and different approaches to infer phylogenetic relationships within Opisthobranchia yield
conflicting results [29-35]. Even though many morphological and molecular analyses suggest a paraphyletic
Opisthobranchia, the monophyly of the major groups
within is well supported, in which Nudibranchia is the
most derived lineage [reviewed in Wägele et al. [36]].
Irrespective of whether Opisthobranchia are paraphyletic
or not, they are considered as one of the most derived
gastropod clades (Fig. 1A-C). However, the relationships
among the major molluscan and gastropod lineages
have not yet reached agreement [37-40]. Therefore, it is
important to investigate additional, phylogenetically
informative characters to evaluate present hypotheses on
the phylogeny of this taxon. By using immunocytochemical markers for the characterisation of the nervous system and F-actin labelling for muscles of the nudibranch
A. stephanieae we provide new data that in future studies can help to elucidate phylogenetic or evolutionary
relations of these enigmatic animals by comparison with
other Opisthobranchia, Gastropoda or Mollusca
respectively.

Results
Embryogenesis and larval development in Aeolidiella
stephanieae

Developmental stages were recognised by external morphological characters rather than referred to exact
points in time after oviposition (po). Typically the
embryos of nudibranchs are enclosed by two membranes, the capsule that surrounds each embryo and
another mucoid layer that encases all of the capsules in
a gelatinous egg mass [41]. After oviposition the first
cleavages proceed quickly (at 1-2 hpo two-cell stage (0%
of development) and at 8 hpo 16-cell stage (0.5% of

Page 2 of 24

development)). The divisions within an egg mass are
asynchronous, both four-celled embryos and zygotes can
be detected in the same egg mass (Fig. 2A).
Characteristic developmental stages of Aeolidiella
stephanieae:
Early veliger stage (5-10% of development)

The first detectable structures, the larval shell and the
ciliated velar lobes, appear at the same time as the first
movements of the larvae (rotation around their anteriorposterior axes) (Fig. 2B).
Veliger stage (10-20% of development)

The embryo can retract the velum into the shell and the
eyes as well as the larval foot (propodium) appear (Fig.
2C).
Late veliger stage (20-25% of development)

The operculum is present and the foot becomes thicker
and longer (Fig. 2D), the embryo hatches shortly prior
to metamorphosis. Swimming is accomplished by ciliary
beats of the velar cilia.
Metamorphosis (25-30% of development)

Usually one day after hatching the larvae settle on the
bottom and retract into the larval shell (Fig. 2E). During
the process of metamorphosis, which does not take
longer than 48 hours, the animals cast off their larval
shell.
Early juvenile stage (30-40% of development)

Slightly after metamorphosis the early juveniles start to
crawl on the bottom, which also marks the beginning of
the benthic lifestyle (Fig. 2F). The eyes indicate the anterior part of the white elongated animals. 24 hours after
metamorphosis they crawl at the bottom of the culture
dish without feeding. At the same time rhinophore rudiments appear anterior to the eyes as the first pair of
cephalic tentacles (Fig. 3A). Ciliation of the early juveniles is detectable all over the body (Fig. 3A). At the
anterior end and on the tip of the rhinophore rudiments
there are cirri, which are compound sensory cilia (Fig.
3A). Generally, 48 hours after metamorphosis juvenile
specimens of A. stephanieae start to prey upon pieces of
Aiptasia pallida anemones.
Juvenile stage (40-60% of development)

At this stage the rudiments of oral tentacles (2nd pair of
cephalic tentacles) and the paired, dorsal cerata appear
(Fig. 3B). The size of the body increases one third in
contrast to the previous developmental stage. As the
development continues, the length and the thickness of
the rhinophores and oral tentacles increases as well as
the body size (Fig. 3C). At this stage additional pairs of
cerata appear and on their tip the filled cnidosacs can
be detected for the first time (Fig. 3C).
Late juvenile stage (60-90% of development)

As development proceeds, body elongation increases
and more pairs of cerata as well as some tentacle-like
elongation of the propodium appears (Fig. 3D).

First deposition of an egg mass (100% of development)

The gross morphology of the mature A. stephanieae is
shown in Figure 3E. At this stage the body size is
between 0.8-1 cm, which is ten times bigger than in the
previous developmental stage, and the oral tentacles are
twice as long as the rhinophores. Reproductive maturity
is reached 60 dpo (100% of development). The first egg
masses are small and contain 60 to 80 embryos. Mature
individuals reach a maximum size of 5 cm, and their
egg masses contain 1000 to 2000 embryos.
Neurogenesis of Aeolidiella stephanieae
Ontogeny of the FMRFamidergic nervous system

The earliest FMRFamide-positive signal is expressed in
the early veliger larvae at 5% of development. Two
FMRFamidergic cells of the larval apical organ appear
synchronously below the early anlage of the velum (Fig.
4A). In the early veliger larva at 8% of development
slightly posterior to the two apical cells the cerebral
commissure is formed (Fig. 4B). As development proceeds some cerebral cells appear on both sides laterally
to the apical ganglion, indicating the future cerebral
ganglia followed by some FMRFamidergic cells formed
dorsoventrally to the ganglia in the anlagen of the future
pedal ganglia (10% of development, Fig. 4B). At this
time an FMRFamide-positive cell appears in the posterior part of the early veliger larva (Fig. 4B). Slightly later
(10-15% of development), three cells appear in the apical
organ (Fig. 4 inset). The median apical cell is flaskshaped and in contact with the surrounding medium via
its neck-like apical projection (Fig. 4 inset). During subsequent development (15-20% of development) the cerebral commissures as well as the cerebropedal
connectives become more solid, and more cerebral as
well as pedal FMRFamidergic cells emerge (Fig. 4C-D).
In addition, more FMRFamide positive cell clusters
appear in the larval foot (Fig. 4C-D). At hatching (25%
of development) the FMRFamidergic nervous system
comprises cerebral-, pleural- and pedal ganglia as well
as degenerating apical cells, cell clusters in the larval
foot and one cell cluster in the posterior part of the
larva (Fig. 4D). When the larvae begin to metamorphose
(30% of development), the resorption of the velar lobes
starts whereas the FMRFamidergic apical cells already
have been resorbed (Fig. 4E-F). The postmetamorphic
FMRFamidergic nervous system changes dramatically.
The cerebral and pleural ganglia fuse into a single, large
cerebropleural ganglion on both sides of the juveniles
(Fig. 5A-E). The left and the right cerebropleural ganglia
are joined to their respective pedal ganglia via connectives, which are still undergoing the process of fusion
(Fig. 5A-D). Early juveniles show a cluster of cells in the
posterior part that is innervated from the pedal ganglion
(Fig. 5A, inset). The buccal ganglia appear posteroventrally to the autofluorescent jaw and anteroventrally to

Page 6 of 24

the cerebropleural ganglia (Fig. 5C). The pleurovisceral
loop can be detected posterodorsally to the cerebropleural ganglia (Fig. 5B-C). FMRFamide positive cells
are distributed across the foot with a condensation in
the anterior part, ventrally to the jaw (Fig. 5B-E). A
nerve can be seen exiting each of the rhinophoral ganglion and extending into the developing rhinophores.
This nerve is distinguished as the nervus rhinophoralis
(n3) (Fig. 5C). The nervus labialis (n2) arising from each
cerebropleural ganglion proceeds anteriorly (not shown).
Ontogeny of the serotonergic nervous system

Cells containing the neurotransmitter serotonin were
labelled in early veliger larvae at 5% of development as
early as 3 dpo. Two serotonergic flask-shaped, sensory
cells (1 and 2) of the apical organ are located in the
anterior region of the larvae (Fig. 6A). In contrast to the
FMRFamidergic expression pattern, an apical neuropil is
present (Fig 6A). Slightly later, up to five serotonergic
apical cells emerge, whereas three of them are flaskshaped, sensory cells (1-3) and two round, non-sensory
cells (4 and 5) (Fig. 6B-D). As development proceeds,
cerebral and pedal cells appear in the veliger larvae at
10% of development (Fig. 7A). During the following, serotonergic neurogenesis more cells appear in the cerebral
and the pedal ganglia (Fig.7B). In addition, fibres of the
pedal cells are visible in the larval foot as well as the
visceral loop (Fig. 7B). As in the FMRFamidergic expression pattern, no apical cells are detectable closely before
and during metamorphosis (Fig. 7C-D). The early juveniles (35% of development) show some serotonergic cell
clusters in the cerebropleural and pedal ganglia (Fig. 7EF). Overall, three distinct serotonergic fibres are running
from the pedal ganglia into different parts of the foot
(Fig. 7E). In addition, the pleurovisceral loop appears
posterior to the cerebropleuralganglia (Fig. 7E). The
postmetamorphic condensation shown in the FMRFamidergic expression pattern is also detectable in the serotonergic, indicated by the shortened connectives and
commissures (Fig. 7E-F).
Pre- and postmetamorphic central nervous system

The nervous system in late veliger larvae (20-25% of
development) in Aeolidiella stephanieae consists of five
paired ganglia (cerebral-, pedal-, pleural-, buccal-, and
optical-ganglia) and one unpaired visceral ganglion (Fig.
8A-B). The buccal ganglia are situated posterior to the
mouth and lateral to the oesophagus whereas the cerebral commissure is located above the oesophagus (not
shown). The cerebral ganglia, which are the largest
ganglia, lie dorsolaterally to the oesophagus and close to
the respective eye (Fig. 8A-B). Two nerves are running
from the cerebral commissure towards the velar lobes
(not shown). At this time, no neural structures of the
apical organ are detectable anymore. Located laterally to
the eyes and the cerebral ganglia are the small optical

ganglia (Fig. 8A-B). The pedal ganglia are situated ventrally to the cerebral ganglia and the pleural ganglia posteriorly (Fig. 8A-B). Both pairs of ganglia, the pedal and
pleural, are joined with the cerebral ganglia via connectives (Fig. 8A-B). The pleural ganglia are connected to
the posteromedially situated visceral ganglion via connectives, which form the pleurovisceral loop (Fig. 8A-B).
Most evident changes in the anatomy of the nervous
system occur during the metamorphosis of A. stephanieae. In the postmetamorphic early juvenile A. stephanieae (30-40% of development), the cerebral and pleural
ganglia fuse to the cerebropleural ganglia (Fig. 8C-D). In
addition, only the pleurovisceral loop is still visible but
not the single visceral ganglion, which is probably fused

with one of the cerebropleural ganglion (Fig. 8C-D).
Furthermore, the connectives of all ganglia become
shorter, and together with the fusion processes the nervous system becomes condensed. The rhinophoral ganglia, new neural structures, appear laterally to the
cerebropleural ganglia (Fig. 8C-D). From each rhinophoral ganglion a nerve is running into the respective
developing rhinophore (Fig. 8D). Overall, the nervous
system of the early A. stephanieae juveniles consists of
five pairs of ganglia (cerebropleural-, pedal-, buccal,
optical-, and rhinophoral ganglia) (Fig. 8D). The buccal
ganglia lie posteriorly to the buccal organ, and the optical ganglia lie near the eyes lateral to the cerebropleural
ganglia (Fig. 8C). One nerve is running from the

cerebropleural ganglia anteriorly towards the mouth and
lip. Two nerves are running from the pedal ganglion,
one, the p3-nerve, is running anteriorly towards the lip
whereas a second one posteriorly to the mid foot region
(Fig. 8D).
Myogenesis of Aeolidiella stephanieae

At the early veliger stage (5% of development) fibres of
the larval retractor muscle run from the insertion area,
located on the dorsoposterior internal protoconch,
slightly to the left side with respect to the medial plane,
to the anlage of the velar musculature (Figs. 9A and
10A). At the same time the accessory larval retractor
appears dorsolaterally to the larval retractor muscle and
runs anteriorly to the anlage of the velum (Figs. 9A and
10A). The velar branch of the larval retractor muscle
comprises two muscle bundles with fibres running into
the velar lobes and terminating at the velar margin, the
velar ring muscle (Figs. 9A and 10A). When myogenesis
continues, the larval retractor muscle and the accessory
retractor muscle become more solid as well as the anterior musculature, comprising the velar lobes and the
pedal musculature (Fig. 9B). At 10% of development the
veliger larvae exhibit a well differentiated pro- and
metapodial musculature, comprising longitudinal fibres,
pedal muscles and metapodial retractor muscles (Figs.
9C and 10B). At the same time the velar musculature is
well developed, comprising a velar ring muscle and
longitudinal muscle fibres, which run from the larval
retractor muscle and the accessory retractor muscle to
the velar ring muscle (Figs. 9C and 10B). In the following development the larval retractor muscle becomes a
dominant retractor muscle (Fig. 9D-F). The larval
retractor muscle comprises a muscle branch that
extends into the velum and another one running into
the pedal region (Fig. 9D-F). The broad thick muscle
layer situated in close proximity to the operculum is a
fusion of the pedal branch of the larval retractor muscle
and the metapodial retractor muscle (Fig. 9D-G). The
pedal muscle anatomy is composed of a set of different
muscles. It starts in the early veliger stage (5-10% of
development), where some longitudinal fibres run from
the velum into the anlage of the future larval foot (Fig.
9B), and continues with the establishment of the metapodial retractor muscle and a net of longitudinal and
transversal muscle fibres in the veliger (10-20% of development) and metamorphic (25-30% of development)
developmental stages (Fig. 9C-H). Slightly after hatching
at 20-25% of development the larvae exhibit intensely
fluorescing dots near to the velar musculature and the
larval retractor muscle (see open triangles in Figs. 9G-H
and 10C). These dots most likely represent depolymerised F-actin indicating velar and larval retractor
muscle degeneration during metamorphosis. In fact, all
larval muscles (the larval retractor muscle, the accessory

Page 12 of 24

larval retractor muscle, the velar muscles, and the pedal
retractors) degenerate throughout metamorphosis or
slightly after, and the post-metamorphic myo-anatomy
is formed de novo. At 30% of development a new structure, the buccal musculature, appears after metamorphosis (Figs. 10D and 11A). The larval retractor muscle
remains indicated by intensely fluorescing structures in
the posterior end of the early juvenile, and is still in the
process of degeneration (Figs. 10D and 11A-B). The
complex post metamorphic myo-anatomy of the early
juvenile comprises circular body wall muscles as well as
longitudinal and oblique muscles (Figs. 10D and 11A-B).
In the following myogenesis the buccal musculature
migrates anteriorly and is located at the anterior end
between the eyes (Figs. 10D-F and 11B-D). Longitudinal
muscle fibres accumulate to ventrolateral muscle
strands, and run from the anterior to the posterior end
of Aeolidiella stephanieae juveniles (Figs. 10D-F and
11B-C). Several oblique muscle fibres that originate at
the ventral anterior side of the juvenile A. stephanieae
loop in a dorsal direction, and eventually bend again
towards the ventral side (Fig. 11B-D). The growing tentacles and cerata are formed by a tight meshwork of
longitudinal and transversal muscle fibres (Fig. 11D).

Discussion
General aspects of developmental modes in Mollusca

Briefly, there are three main types of opisthobranchiate
development: one where a planktotrophic larval stage is
obligatory, one where development is via a free swimming lecithotrophic larval stage, and one where the
intracapsular development ends post metamorphosis
(direct development) [42,43]. Since the lecithotrophic
life history pattern is present in basal mollusc (e.g. Solenogastres, Caudofoveata and, Polyplacophora) and basal
gastropod groups (e.g. Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda), there is growing consensus that the lecithotrophic
development is ancestral for molluscs [36,44-49]. In
nudibranchs planctotrophic [50], lecitothrophic [51] and
direct development [43] are present. All three developmental strategies can be found in closely related taxa
and genera. Hence, the life history pattern in Nudibranchia does not reflect the systematic position of a taxon
or species.
In Aeolidiella stephanieae the development is lecithotrophic. The first pair of cephalic tentacles, the rhinophores, emerge shortly after metamorphosis (30% of
development), whereas the second pair, the oral tentacles, appear significantly later in postmetamorphic stages
(juvenile stage, 40% of development). The same developmental pattern of cephalic tentacles has been shown in
three other nudibranchs, so far (Adalaria proxima [52],
Cadlina laevis [43], and Melibe leonina [50]). In contrast, the rhinophores of the nudibranch, Rostanga

pulchra, emerge shortly before metamorphosis [53], and
in the aplysiomorph Aplysia californica the oral tentacles emerge first and the rhinophores later in development [54,55]. The cephalic tentacles are important
sensory organs that function as chemo-, photo-, and
mechanoreceptors [56-59]. Because of these organs, gastropods are capable of locating and discriminating food,
predators, and conspecifics [60-63], and orienting themselves toward water currents [64,65]. Oral tentacles of
adult opisthobranchs function as contact chemoreceptors [59,66,67] to taste food quality, whereas rhinophores are distant chemoreceptive sensory organs used
to locate distant food sources [59,61,68]. Since A. californica larvae need to settle before metamorphosis on
their future diet, red seaweed, they have to be able to
taste the food quality first and do not need rhinophores,
as yet [54]. Seemingly, settlement and metamorphosis in
A. stephanieae larvae are not triggered by their future
prey, and most likely therefore the rhinophores develop
first after metamorphosis in order to be able to locate
their diet, sea anemones. This implies that the developmental sequence of cephalic tentacles is an adaptation
to the way of living rather than a character reflecting
phylogenetic relationships in different opisthobranch
taxa.
Phylogenetic significance of neuro- and myogenesis in
gastropods

Immunocytochemical studies of nervous system and Factin labelling of musculature of gastropods from early
larval to postmetamorphic stages are rare [2,24,55]. In
addition, many other studies deal only with selected
developmental stages (e.g. preveliger, hatchlings, and
metamorphic larvae) [69-72]. Our immunocytochemical
data increase the knowledge of neuro-and myogenesis
and thus enable the comparison of certain features of
opisthobranch and gastropod development, which is significant in view of their phylogenetic history.
Apical organ

The best studied cells in the apical organ of gastropods
have been those immunoreactive to serotonin (monoamine) (Fig. 12) [10,21,55,69,73-75]. Other neuronal markers such as catecholamines [71,76,77] and
neuropeptides including FMRFamide [78-81] have also
been identified within apical cells in various gastropod
species. The types and numbers of apical cells containing catecholamines and FMRFamide show fewer similarities than do those cells containing serotonin. Five
apical cells are immunoreactive for FMRFamide and the
same number for serotonin during the early veliger and
veliger stage (5-15% of development) of Aeolidiella stephanieae. Two flask-shaped sensory cells flank a median
flask-shaped cell with two round/paraampullary cells
beneath, all, situated above the cerebral commissure.
Although the five FMRFamidergic and serotonergic

Page 16 of 24

apical cells show a similar arrangement, since no double
labelling experiments have been performed we cannot
say whether they are identical or not. However, in the
caenogastropods Crepicula fornicata [2] and Ilyanassa
obsoleta [10] various apical cells contain both the monoamines and the neuropeptides. Further experiments will
clarify, whether this is also true for some or even all of
the immunoreactive apical cells of A. stephanieae.
Besides the co-expression of one or more neurosubstances, we note that the caenogastropod Euspira lewisii
(Littorinimorpha, Naticoidea) [74] and all opisthobranchs studied to date have identical arranged types of
five serotonergic neurons within the apical ganglion
[21,55,69,73,82-84]. They all show three sensory and
two non-sensory serotonergic cells within the apical
organ. As indicated in the comparative sketches in Figure 12, caenogastropods are particularly notable for
interspecific differences in the number of serotonergic
cells within the apical organ. Littorinimorph caenogastropods that belong to the clade of Littorinoidea, for
example, lack the median sensory cell, the ones of calyptraeoidean clade lack the lateral sensory cells instead,
whereas all investigated neogastropod clades have an
additional lateral non-sensory, round cell [2,10,74]. It
has been suggested previously that the presence of the
unpaired lateral cell in the neogastropods I. obsoleta and
Amphissa versicolor might be related to one larger velar
lobe and/or the earlier development of the rhinophores,
which are already present slightly before the metamorphosis [6]. Congruent with this assumption is that the
lecitothrophic (non-feeding) patello- and vetigastropod
larvae, which have a smaller velum, have only three and
two serotonergic apical cells, respectively [75,85]. In
addition, there are only two serotonergic apical cells in
the direct developing embryos of pulmonates [79,80,86].
Neritimorpha, Opisthobranchia and Caenogastropoda
are all groups that have feeding larvae (planktotrophic
development) and an increase in serotonergic cells
within the apical organ (Fig. 12). Moreover, the planktotrophic life history pattern with a long-term, planktotrophic larva is assumed to be ancestral for these three
gastropod lineages [21,74,87,88]. The question whether
larval planktotrophy arose independently in these
lineages or whether it was shared with a common ancestor is still under discussion [47,74,87-90]. However, Page
and Kempf [87] described significant differences in the
structure of the apical organ between the larvae of Neritimorpha and Apogastropoda (Caenogastropoda + Heterobranchia), and therefore suggested an independent
origin of planktotrophy in these two gastropod groups.
In fact, the apical organ of caenogastropod and opisthobranch larvae is strikingly similar [21,74]. In addition,
Apogastropoda has been recognized independently in
morphological, molecular and combined analyses as the

Kristof and Klussmann-Kolb Frontiers in Zoology 2010, 7:5
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/7/1/5

most derived clade whereas Patellogastropoda and Vetigastropoda are members of the more basal clades (Fig.
1A-B). This correlates with the fact that the patello- and
vetigastropods have only few serotonergic cells in their
apical organ and lecithotrophic development, which is
assumed to be the plesiomorphic life history pattern for
the gastropods as a whole [47,91]. Hence, it is doubtful
that Caenogastropoda is the most basal clade within
Gastropoda as recently suggested by mitochondrial genome arrangements (Fig. 1C).
Regardless of the differences in serotonergic cell numbers, several studies support the assumption that the
apical organ plays an important role in metamorphic
processes like settlement [see [6,72,92,93]]. However,
loss of serotonergic and FMRFamidergic cells in the apical organ in several gastropods and the scaphopod
Antalis entalis well before the onset of metamorphosis
challenges this assumption [5,55,94]. Accordingly, the
role in settlement and metamorphosis might not be the
ancestral function of the apical organ. No FMRFamidergic or serotonergic signal can be detected in the apical
organ of Aeolidiella stephanieae larvae shortly before or
throughout the metamorphosis (20-30% of development). Degeneration of the apical organ throughout
metamorphosis has also been shown in another opisthobranch gastropod, Aplysia californica [55,83]. In the caenogastropod Ilyanassa obsoleta, loss of cells in the apical
organ has been demonstrated to occur during metamorphosis through some form of programmed cell death
[94]. It has also been shown that some apical cells of I.
obsoleta can be respecified and migrate into adjacent
ganglia [10]. Nevertheless, a general feature of gastropod
neurogenesis is seemingly that the larval nervous system
(apical organ, the serotonergic velar/prototroch nerve
ring) is lost before, during, or shortly after metamorphosis [49].
Central nervous system and periphery

The neurogenesis of Aeolidiella stephanieae is similar to
that of other nudibranchs [21,70,95]. The larval nervous
system of A. stephanieae includes an apical organ, developing central ganglia, and peripheral neurons associated
with the velum, foot and posterior part of the larvae.
The first neurons containing serotonin and FMRFamide
are observed during the early veliger stage (5-10% of
development) in the apical organ. Slightly later, in the
veliger stage (15% of development), peripheral FMRFamidergic cells appear in the posterior part of the larvae,
and persist throughout metamorphosis into the early
juvenile stage (30% of development). In other gastropods, these neurons have never been documented to
persist during metamorphosis. Similar posterior neurons
containing FMRFamide were first described in the pulmonate Lymnaea stagnalis at a time analogous to the
trochophore stage [78,79]. Since then they have also

Page 17 of 24

been described in trochophore stages of the opisthobranch Aplysia californica [84], as well as the caenogastropods Crepidula fornicata [2] and Ilyanassa obsoleta
[10].
As in many other gastropods, the ganglia of Aeolidiella stephanieae develop from an anterior to posterior
direction in both expression patterns, serotonergic and
FMRFamidergic, where the cerebral ganglia develop first
followed by the pedal-, and the posterior ganglia [55,96].
In contrast, there are also reports where some of the
earliest serotonergic or FMRFamidergic cells appear well
before the cerebral and pedal ganglia in the more posterior osphradial, intestinal, abdominal, and parietal
ganglia, respectively [2,10,79,84,92]. These findings contradict the prior suggestion that gangliogenesis in gastropods develop in an anterior to posterior sequence
[97-99]. However, single serotonergic and FMRFamidergic cells as well as fine neurites can be visualised by
immunolabellings, but it does not reflect the entire nervous system. Light microscopy and serial sections, in
contrast, might show almost all parts of the nervous system but not the very fine neural structures. Therefore, a
comparative combined immunocytochemical, histochemical and TEM analysis might deepen the knowledge in gastropod and mollusc gangliogenesis.
Regardless of which ganglia develop first, the central
ganglia that develop during the larval stages will persist
the metamorphosis and become the adult CNS in gastropods and other molluscs (reviewed in Croll and Dickinson [6]).
As in other nudibranchs described, the CNS of Aeolidiella stephanieae becomes more concentrated during
metamorphosis [51,95,100-103]. In Berghia verrucicornis
the pleural and cerebral ganglia fuse together to cerebropleural ganglia, the visceral ganglion fuses with the
left cerebropleural ganglion to become the pleurovisceral
loop, and all the connectives become shorter [95]. This
is congruent with our findings in A. stephanieae except
that we can not document to which of the newly formed
cerebropleural ganglia the visceral ganglion becomes
part of. However, in the newly metamorphosed A. stephanieae rhinophoral ganglia appear as additional neural
structures at the same time as the rhinophores start to
grow. This is also true for the nudibranchs Adalaria
proxima, Tritonia hombergi, Cadlina laevis, Rostanga
pulchra, Melibe leonina, and B. verrucicornis
[43,52,53,95,100,102,103]. In contrast, in the aplysiomorph Aplysia californica all connectives become
longer, and the ganglia do not fuse [55,104]. Furthermore, in A. californica the oral tentacles and their ganglia appear well before the rhinophores and their
respective neural structures [55,104]. Since Nudibranchia is considered a derived taxon compared to Aplysiomorpha [29,30,105,106], the condensation of the CNS

during metamorphosis and the absence of oral tentacle
ganglia thus appear to be a derived condition of certain
opisthobranch clades.
Myogenesis

F-actin labelling in conjunction with cLSM enables precise
reconstruction and visualisation of three dimensionally
arranged muscles systems of microscopic invertebrates
[107-111]. So far, three “basal” [112-114] and one “higher”
gastropod [24] have been investigated applying this technique. The primitive gastropods (patello- and vetigastropods) have four larval muscle systems (main and accessory
larval retractors, velar and pedal muscle system)

[113-115]. The larval retractors and the velar musculature
degenerate during or shortly after metamorphosis, while
the pedal muscle plexus continues into adult musculature,
and the buccal, tentacle, and shell musculature originate
independently from all other muscles [114,115]. In contrast, existing studies on caenogastropod larvae consistently describe only one shell attached retractor muscle
and one pedal muscle [42,116-123]. The larval retractor
muscle makes no contribution to the post-metamorphic
adult shell muscle (columellar muscle) because it derives
from a portion of the larval pedal muscle only [123]. However, although only four taxa of opisthobranchs have been

Kristof and Klussmann-Kolb Frontiers in Zoology 2010, 7:5
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/7/1/5

investigated so far, they are particularly notable for variations in number and configuration of larval shell muscles
(Cephalaspidea [124,125], Aplysiomorpha [24,126], Sacoglossa [127,128], Nudibranchia [51,100,129-134]). Cephalaspidea and Aplysiomorpha have the main and the
accessory larval retractor muscles, [24,124-126] whereas
Sacoglossa and the anthobranch Nudibranchia lack the
accessory larval retractor muscle [51,100,127-129,131,132,
134]. Casteel [130] showed three retractors for Fiona marina, while Bonar and Hadfield [133] reported only two in
Phestilla sibogae (both cladobranch nudibranchs). This is
congruent with our observations in Aeolidiella stephanieae
where the accessory larval retractor muscle is present. In
other opisthobranchs than nudibranchs, the cephalopedal
musculature contributes to the adult muscle complex. As
in other nudibranchs the post-metamorphic myo-anatomy
in A. stephanieae is formed de novo. However, regardless
the number, larval retractor muscles make no contribution
to the post-metamorphic columellar muscle in opisthobranchs. Interestingly, in Patello-, Veti-, Caenogastropoda,
and Opisthobranchia the buccal and tentacle musculature
originates independently from all other muscles, and, with
the exception in nudibranch gastropods, the cephalopedal
musculature plays an important role in differentiation of
adult musculature. Therefore, the de novo formation of
the adult muscle complex is probably a derived nudibranch character. Moreover, ultrastructural studies on
patellogastropods, nudibranchs, and the caenogastropod
Polinices lewisii showed that the larval and, if present, the
accessory retractor muscle is obliquely striped
[114,115,123]. Accordingly, A. stephanieae bears similarities with other gastropods in terms of target tissues (velar/
prototrochal and cephalic regions) and their developmental fate, i.e., the degeneration of the larval retractor muscles before or during metamorphosis. Furthermore, as also
found in other gastropods, A. stephanieae exhibits a larval
retractor muscle that is anchored on the posterior inner
shell and inserts at a muscle ring that underlies the prototroch or velum, which enables retraction of the velum into
the mantel cavity (Opisthobranchia [24,52,124,126,133,
134], other Gastropoda [112-115,135]). Accordingly, it is
likely that the retractor muscles in Gastropoda are homologues, and therefore the patello- and vetigastropod condition with an accessory and a larval obliquely striped
retractor muscle plesiomorphic. Hence, the caenogastropod and the two opisthobranch groups, Sacoglossa and
Anthobranchia with only one larval retractor muscle
represent a derived condition. This is congruent with several morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses
where the sister taxon relationship are found between
Cephalaspidea and Aplysiomorpha as well as Anthobranchia and Cladobranchia [24,29,30,105,106,136]. Moreover,
several analyses indicate that the Sacoglossa might have a

Page 19 of 24

closer relationship to the Nudibranchia (Anthobranchia +
Cladobranchia) [27,30,137].
Evolutionary derivation of neuromuscular patterns of
gastropods compared to other molluscs

Within molluscs there are variations in the number of
apical cells. Four ampullary serotonergic cells have been
reported in the apical organ of scaphopods [5], as well
as eight to ten ampullary and two para-ampullary serotonergic cells in polyplacophorans [3,138]. Recently, the
bivalve Mytilus trossulus was shown to possess five
FMRFamidergic and serotonergic apical sensory cells
[8], although again, these numbers vary among bivalves
[139,140]. The close temporal and spatial association of
the apical organ with the developmental onset of the
cerebral commissure is a general feature of neurogenesis
in molluscs. This supports the assumption that the larval apical organ plays an inductive role in the formation
of the future adult cerebral nervous system. This corresponds to the situation in annelid and sipunculan larvae
investigated so far, and might represent a plesiomorphic
condition of trochozoan neurogenesis [20,22,141-143].
Recently, in the bivalve Mytilus trossulus three pairs of
larval striated retractor muscles that degenerate throughout metamorphosis were described [144]. Furthermore,
bivalve larval retractor muscles insert at a muscle ring that
underlies the prototroch or velum as also found in Aeolidiella stephanieae and other gastropods [144,145]. In contrast, scaphopods lack most of the larval retractor muscles
as well as a prototroch muscle ring, and polyplacophoran
larvae do not exhibit a retractor muscle but a prototroch
muscle ring [146,147]. The fact that the prototrochal muscle ring is found in Polyplacophora, Bivalvia, and all Gastropoda with a larval stage, but not in Scaphopoda
suggests a secondary loss in scaphopods. However, a prototroch muscle ring is present in other trochozoans such
as polychaetes [49] and sipunculans [148] indicating that
this structure might represent a plesiomorphic character
for Mollusca. In addition, the strikingly similar larval
retractor muscle between gastropods and bivalves might
reflect their close phylogenetic relationship [149]. The prototrochal muscle ring as well as a body wall musculature
comprising outer ring, intermediate oblique and inner
longitudinal muscles, is, in contrast, a shared feature
among trochozoans [25]. In nudibranch gastropods, however, this is a secondary condition since the majority,
including the basal gastropod groups (i.e. Patello- and
Vetigastropoda) do not have this kind of body wall
musculature.

Opisthobranchia indicates their sister taxon relationship
as shown by previous morphological, molecular and
combined analyses (Fig. 1A-B). Consequently, the accessory larval retractor muscle of the basal gastropods,
Patello-, and Vetigastropoda, and Aeolidiella stephanieae
is part of the gastropod ground pattern that has been
lost in Caenogastropoda, Sacoglossa and anthobranch
nudibranchs. Accordingly, the placement of Caenogastropoda as the most basal gastropod clade as currently
suggested by Grande et al. [39]; Fig. 1C] is not
supported.

Developmental staging

Methods

The development of Aeolidiella stephanieae lasts 60
days at 22°C based on morphological, morphometrical
and behavioural features examined at regular time intervals throughout development. Stages are expressed as a
percentage of development, wherein 0% corresponds to
the first egg cleavage and 100% to the first layed egg
mass (error margin of 2%). The results are based upon
observations of at least 300 specimens at each of the
premetamorphic, metamorphic and early postmetamorphic (30-40% of development) developmental stages
and at least 30 specimens at each of the later, juvenile
developmental stages.

Animal Culture

Immunolabelling and confocal laser scanning microscopy

Adults of Aeolidiella stephanieae Valdéz, 2005 and several specimens of Aiptasia pallida (Cnidaria, Anthozoa)
were purchased from pro-marin of the Justus-LiebigUniversity in Giessen (Hessen/Germany). Both the sea
anemones and the gastropod molluscs were cultured at
the University of Frankfurt am Main (Hessen/Germany).
The sea anemone, A. pallida, (used to feed A. stephanieae) was reared in a 200 litre tank with artificial seawater at 18°C temperature and fed with nauplius larvae
of Artemia salina (Crustacea, Brachiopoda) every two to
three days. Other, more detailed, methods for culture of
A. pallida have been described by Hessinger and Hessinger [150].
Adult specimens of Aeolidiella stephanieae were kept
in a 20 litre tank at a water temperature of 21°C filled
with approximately 5 litre of 0.45 μm millipore-filtered
artificial seawater. The metabolic and digestive wastes of
invertebrate species and algae from this aquaria provide
for the growth of essential bacterial populations that
desoxify ammonia and nitrites. The water was changed
once weekly. Freshly laid egg masses were transferred to
unaerated 60 ml glass crystallizing dishes (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany, ø 60 mm, volume 60 ml, height 35 ml)
containing 30-50 ml of 0.45 μm millipore-filtered aquarium water of 22°C. One or two small Aiptasia pallida
were placed into every second dish, or pieces of the foot
were placed in the dish together with the A. stephanieae
two days after metamorphosis. Thereafter, sea anemones
were added and the water was changed every second
day. As the specimens reached the last juvenile stage
(fully developed rhinophores, labial tentacles and cerata)
they were transferred in unaerated 500 ml glass crystallizing dishes containing 300-350 ml of 0.45 μm millipore-filtered aquarium water. At the time a specimen
laid the first egg mass it was considered to be sexually
mature. Thereafter the specimens were added to the
adults in the 20 litre aquaria. Antibiotics were not used
in any stage of culture. Regular water changes were sufficient to prevent high infestation with protist and bacterial contaminants.

Larvae were anesthetised by adding drops of 7% MgCl2
solution to seawater and were subsequently fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (pH 7.3) for 4-6 h at 4°C. This procedure
was followed by rinsing the specimens in 0.1 M PBS
(pH 7.3) three times (5, 5 and 60 min). Larvae were decalcified with 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) in aqua dest. for several hours. Afterwards, the
animals were rinsed in 0.1 M PBS (5, 5, 60 min), permeabilised (4% Triton X-100 in PBS 0.1 M for 24 h)
and incubated in one of the antibodies listed below in a
blocking solution (1% normal goat serum in PBT (0.1 M
PBS containing 1% Triton X-100)) for 72 h at 4°C. Both
antibodies were diluted in PBS (0.1 M) and applied at a
1:250 (rabbit anti-Serotonin; Acris, Hiddenhausen, Germany) or a 1:500-1:1000 (rabbit anti-FMRFamide;
Immunostar, Hudson, Wisconsin, USA) final working
concentration. After several washes in 0.1 M PBS, a goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein
isothiocynate (FITC) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, USA) or rhodamine (TRITC)
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West
Grove, USA) was applied at a 1:50 dilution in 0.1 M
PBS for 24 h at 4°C, which was then followed by several
washes in PBS. All specimens prepared for immunocytochemistry were mounted in a 3:1 mixture of glycerol to
TRIS-buffer (0.5 M) with 2% propyl gallate added to
prevent fading [151] on glass slides. As negative controls, animals were processed without incubation in primary antibody resulting in no fluorescence labelling.
Positive controls included parallel processing of adult
central nervous system of Littorina littorea and Haminoea japonica with known labelling patterns (Staubach
(Field Museum Chicago) and Schulze (Zoological
Museum Hamburg) pers. comm.).
For F-actin labelling, anesthetised and fixed (see
above) larvae were washed in 0.1 M PBS (3 × 15 min. at
room temperature), permeabilised for 6 h PBT at 4°C,
and incubated in a 1:40 dilution of the fluorescent dye
Oregon Green 514 phalloidin (Molecular Probes,

Kristof and Klussmann-Kolb Frontiers in Zoology 2010, 7:5
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/7/1/5

Eugene, Oregon, USA) in 0.1 M PBS in the dark for 1 h
at room temperature. Afterwards, the samples were
washed again (3 × 15 min) and mounted (see above) on
glass slides.
Analysis and digital image acquisition of the fluorescence preparations was performed on a Leica DM LB
microscope and a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope. Optical sections taken at intervals of
0.1-0.5 μm were generated and digitally merged to maximum projections. Images were further processed with
Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, California,
USA) to adjust contrast and brightness. In addition,
drawings were created with the computer based software Corel Draw 11.0 (Corel Corporation, Ottawa,
Ontario, Canada).
