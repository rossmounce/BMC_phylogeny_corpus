Abstract
Background: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are members of the
Pneumovirinae subfamily of Paramyxoviridae and can cause severe respiratory disease, especially in infants and young
children. Some differences in the clinical course of these infections have been described, but there are few
comparative data on pathogenesis in humans and animal models. In this study, HMPV and RSV were compared
for replication, pathogenesis and immune induction in BALB/c mice infected with equivalent inocula of either virus.
Methods: Viral titers in the lungs and in the nasal turbinates of mice were determined by plaque assay.
Histopathological changes in the lungs as well as weight loss and levels of airway obstruction were monitored in
the infected mice to record the severity of illness. Inflammatory cells recruited to the lungs were characterized
by flow cytometry and by differential staining. In the case of natural killer cells, cytotoxic activity was also
measured. Cytokine levels in the BAL were determined by cytometric bead array.
Results: RSV replicated to higher titers than HMPV in the lung and in the upper respiratory tract (URT), and
virus elimination from the lungs was more rapid in HMPV-infected mice. Clinical illness as determined by airway
obstruction, weight loss, and histopathology was significantly more severe after HMPV infection. A comparison
of the cellular immune response revealed similar recruitment of T lymphocytes with a predominance of IFN-γproducing CD8+ T cells. By contrast, there were obvious differences in the innate immune response. After HMPV
infection, more neutrophils could be detected in the airways and there were more activated NK cells than in RSVinfected mice. This correlated with higher levels of IL-6, TNF-α and MCP-1.
Conclusion: This study shows important differences in HMPV and RSV pathogenesis and suggests that the
pronounced innate immune response observed after HMPV infection might be instrumental in the severe
pathology.

Background
Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), a newly identified
member of the Pneumovirinae subfamily of Paramyxoviridae, has recently been recognised as a leading cause of
acute respiratory tract disease in infants and children
worldwide [1]. HMPV also represents a significant etiology of acute respiratory disease in adults, particularly the
elderly and those with comorbid conditions such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cancer
[2], or immunodeficiency [3]. The seasonal occurrence as
well as the spectrum of clinical illness, ranging from rhinorrhea, cough and wheezing to severe pneumonia, resemble those of the related respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
[4,5], although some differences are apparent. In fact,
infants suffering from respiratory tract infections, have
lower levels of inflammatory cytokines in nasal secretions,
when infected with HMPV than with RSV [6]. On the
other hand, HMPV infection is more often associated with
a diagnosis of pneumonia than RSV [6-8]. These reports
suggest that HMPV biological properties and pathogenesis
may differ from those of RSV.
Considerable progress has been made in molecular epidemiology [9] and development of diagnostic assays [10].
Several animal models of HMPV infection, including
BALB/c mice, cotton rats, hamsters, ferrets and non
human primates, have been established to better understand viral pathogenesis. However, many questions on
the implication of viral and host factors in the development of disease still remain open [7,11-16]. In particular,
HMPV-related immunopathogenesis and the possibility
of viral persistence need further investigation.
RSV infection of BALB/c mice represents a well established
experimental model which has successfully been used to
study pathogenesis of and immune response to this pneumovirus [17]. Although RSV can directly affect the integrity of the respiratory epithelium, the immune response is
the most crucial factor in pathogenesis, and RSV-induced
cytokines and chemokines play an important role in regulating illness and inflammation [17]. BALB/c mice have
been reported to be semipermissive for HMPV in some
studies [11,13,15] but highly permissive in others
[7,14,18]. This divergence may be ascribed to differences
between HMPV strains, although this has not been
reported in hamsters infected with different viral strains
[11,12]. The kinetics of HMPV replication in the respiratory tract of mice apparently resembles that of RSV, with
peaks of virus replication occurring between 3 and 4 days
after infection [11,12]. Only one study using HMPV/
CAN98-75 showed biphasic growth kinetics with peak titers occurring at days 7 and 14 post infection [18]. In contrast to RSV, the immune response to HMPV was
characterized by a low inflammatory response, minimal
innate immunity and limited T cell trafficking to the lung

http://respiratory-research.com/content/8/1/6

[7]. Although these findings indicate some differences in
pathogenesis, comparative data on mice infected with
equivalent doses of RSV or HMPV have not been reported.
Here, we directly compare the kinetics of viral replication,
pathogenesis, and immune response in the BALB/c mouse
model after infection with the same dose of HMPV or RSV
using either a low passage-clinical isolate obtained in our
laboratory (HMPV/D03-574) and phylogenetically characterized as subtype A2a [19], or the RSV strain A2.
Our results reveal distinct features of host response to
HMPV or RSV that correlate with differences in disease
severity.

Methods
Mice
Eight to 10-week-old, specific-pathogen-free female
BALB/c mice were obtained from Charles River (Sulzfeld,
Germany). The mice were kept in a venti-rack at the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Freiburg and
fed sterilized water and food ad libitum. All experiments
were performed in accordance with the local animal care
commission.
Cell lines and viruses
Rhesus monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2 and Vero) were
maintained in D-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1%
L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (complete
medium) and Eagles's MEM complete medium, respectively. HMPV was propagated in LLC-MK2 cells cultured
in D-MEM w/o serum supplemented with 1% Lglutamine, penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic mix and 5
μg/ml trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany)
(trypsin medium) whereas RSV was grown on HEp-2 cells
cultured in Eagles's MEM complete medium.

For HMPV and RSV titration on Vero cells, Eagle's MEM
trypsin medium and Eagle's MEM supplemeted with 5%
FCS were used, respectively.
The HMPV strain D03-574 (subgroup A2a) was isolated
from an infant with bronchiolitis in our laboratory, propagated 4 times on LLC-MK2 cells and used to prepare a
virus stock. Virus was harvested 3 days p.i., snap-frozen,
and kept in liquid nitrogen. The infectious virus titer of
the stock was 2,5 × 106 plaque froming units/ml (PFU/
ml). The RSV A2 strain is a common laboratory strain and
was originally obtained from Peter Openshaw (Imperial
College, London, GB), grown on HEp-2 cells over 4 passages, and kept in liquid nitrogen. The infectious virus
titer of the stock on Vero cells was 3,3 × 107 PFU/ml.

Infection, organ collection, and virus titration
BALB/c mice were lightly anesthetized by intraperitoneal
injection of ketamine (2 mg/mouse) and xylazine (0.15
mg/mouse), and infected intranasally (i.n.) with 2 × 105
PFU HMPV strain D03-574 or 2 × 105(when indicated
106) PFU RSV strain A2 in 80 μl serum-free (SF) Eagle's
MEM.

At the indicated time points, anesthetized mice were
exsanguinated, and lungs and nasal turbinates were harvested separately for virus quantification by plaque assay.
Lungs were homogenized using a Teflon pestle in a volume of 1.5 ml of SF culture medium, whereas nasal turbinates were homogenized in 3 ml by grinding with sterile
sand. Total homogenates were quickly spun down, and
supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. To
determine HMPV titers, 150 μl of 10-fold serial dilutions
of the clarified homogenates were added in duplicate to
confluent Vero cell monolayers in a 24-well plate and cultured for 5 days under 0.8% methylcellulose, followed by
fixation with 80% methanol. HMPV plaques were visualized by incubation with anti-HMPV rabbit serum (kindly
provided by U. Buchholz, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) followed by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG coupled to
biotin (Perbio Science Deutschland, Bonn, Germany) and
with streptavidin coupled to horseradish peroxidase (SAHRP; BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Finally, the
plaques were enumerated after addition of 3',3'-diaminobenzidine substrate (DAB; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Similarly, RSV titers were determined on Vero cells
and detected using a biotin-labelled anti-RSV antibody
(Biogenesis, Berlin, Germany) followed by incubation
with SA-HRP and DAB substrate as previously described
[20].
Determination of pulmonary function by whole-body
plethysmography
Whole-body plethysmography (Buxco Electronics Inc.
Troy, NY) was used, to monitor the respiratory dynamics
of mice in a quantitative manner. Penh is a dimensionless
value that represents a function of the ratio of peak expiratory flow to peak inspiratory flow and a function of the
timing of expiration, and it correlates with pulmonary airflow resistance. Penh has previously been validated in animal models of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) [21,22]
and infection-associated airway obstruction (AO) [23].
Baseline airway resistance (with or without infection) is
described as AO and the transient airway resistance in
response to methacholine as AHR. Before exposure to
methacholine, mice were allowed to acclimate to the
plethysmograph chamber, and then baseline readings
were recorded to determine AO. Mice were exposed to
increasing doses of aerosolized methacholine/mL (SigmaAldrich). Plethysmograph readings were recorded again to

http://respiratory-research.com/content/8/1/6

determine AHR. Groups of infected and control mice were
always evaluated in parallel.
Analysis of cellular lung infiltrates
Pulmonary inflammatory cells were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as previously described [20] and
used for NK assay or antibody staining without further
manipulations. For microscopic differentiation of BAL
macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, 104 BAL
cells were used for cytospin preparation on glass slides utilizing a Shandon Cytospin centrifuge (Thermo Electron,
Waltham, MA). After air-drying, 2 ml Wright's staining
solution (FLUKA, Buchs, Austria) was added for 6 minutes, followed by water for 6 minutes. After washing and
air-drying, a differential cell count was performed with
200 cells.
Natural killer (NK)cell assay
The NK cell assay was performed under "mini-killer" conditions as previously described [24]. Briefly, effector BAL
cells were plated in two-fold dilutions starting with 5 ×
104 cells per well in a volume of 50 μl in a 96-well V-bottom plate (Greiner Labortechnik, Solingen, Germany).
YAC-1, labelled with (51Cr), were used as target cells, and
2 × 103 cells were added in a volume of 50 μl per well for
an initial effector:target ratio of 25.
Flow cytometry
Single-cell suspensions of BAL cells (105) were surfacestained for 30 min at 4°C with the following antibody
combinations: (i) anti-CD8-FITC (Ly-2; clone 53-6.7),
anti-CD4-PE (L3T4; clone RM 4–5) and anti-CD3-APC
(CD3 ε chain; clone 145-2C11); (ii) anti-CD3-APC and
anti-DX5-bio (CD49b/Pan-NK), followed by incubation
with SA-Cy (all from BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA).

To detect intracellular cytokines, cells (1–2 × 105) were
incubated with 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)
(Sigma-Aldrich), 500 ng of ionomycin (Calbiochem, San
Diego, CA) and 1 μl/ml monensin (Golgistop, BD
PharMingen) for 5 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested,
washed and surface-stained with anti-CD3-APC and antiCD8-FITC and then subjected to intracellular cytokine
staining using the cytofix/cytoperm kit according to the
manufacturer's instruction (BD PharMingen). Cells were
stained with anti-IFN-γ-PE or with isotype-control antibody (BD PharMingen). After 30 min, cells were washed
and analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACScan and Cellquest Software, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany), collecting data on at least 10,000
lymphocytes. Calculations of percentages were based on
live cells as determined by FSC/SSC analysis.

Analysis of secreted cytokines by cytometric bead array
BAL supernatants obtained by centrifugation of BAL cells
for 10 min at 1600 rpm were harvested and stored at 70°C until cytokine testing was performed. IL-6, IL-10, IL12, MCP-1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were detected simultaneously using the Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) Mouse
Inflammation Kit (BD PharMingen). Briefly, 50 μl of each
sample was mixed with 50 μl of mixed capture beads and
50 μl of the mouse Th1/Th2 PE detection reagent consisting of PE-conjugated anti-mouse IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, MCP1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. The samples were incubated at room
temperature for 3 h in the dark. After incubation with the
PE detection reagent, the samples were washed once and
resuspended in 300 μl of wash buffer before acquisition
on a FACScan cytometer. Data were analyzed using CBA
software (BD PharMingen). Standard curves were generated for each cytokine using the mixed cytokine standard
provided by the kit. The concentration for each cytokine
in cell supernatants was determined by interpolation from
the corresponding standard curve. The range of detection
was 20–5000 pg/ml for each cytokine measured by CBA.
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
For histological examination, lung specimens from RSVand HMPV-infected mice and normal control mice were
collected and fixed in 4% buffered formalin. Paraffinembedded tissue blocks were cut at 4 μm. Deparaffinized
sections were evaluated following hematoxylin & eosin
(H&E) staining or by immunolabelling using anti-HMPV
rabbit serum. Briefly, immunohistochemistry was performed after antigen retrieval and incubation for 20 min
with 10% blocking serum (Biotrend, Cologne, Germany).
Sections were stained semiautomatically (Autostainer
instrument, Dako, Hamburg, Germany) with the primary
antibody and a biotinylated detection antibody. Antibody
binding was detected by the labelled streptavidin-biotin
(LSAB) method [25] (ChemMate K5005 Alkaline Phosphatase/Red detection kit, Dako). Nuclei were counterstained with Mayer's hemalaun solution.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. Student's unpaired t-test was used to compare HMPVinfected and RSV-infected animals at the same time point
(significance level set at P < 0.05).

Results
HMPV and RSV replication in the respiratory tract of
BALB/c mice
To assess whether our HMPV isolate is able to replicate in
the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice, animals were infected
with 2 × 105 PFU of HMPV and the kinetics of viral load
was determined in the nasal turbinates (upper respiratory
tract; URT) and in the lungs (lower respiratory tract; LRT).
A virus peak was observed between day 4 and day 6. The

http://respiratory-research.com/content/8/1/6

virus was eliminated by day 7 from the lungs and between
day 10 and day 15 from the URT (Fig 1A). There was no
evidence for long-term viral persistence as shown by sensitive real time PCR at day 120 p.i. (data not shown).
To compare HMPV and RSV replication in both compartments, BALB/c mice were infected i.n. with 2 × 105 PFU of
either virus preparation, and virus titers were determined
in the URT and in the LRT. On day 4 p.i., titers were higher
for RSV than for HMPV (Fig 1B). Consistent with this,
HMPV was eliminated from the lungs by day 7 p.i., while
low titers of RSV were still present. By contrast, virus elimination from the nasal turbinates was more efficient for
RSV whereas significant titers of HMPV were still measured on day 7 p.i.
Clinical manifestations of HMPV and RSV infection
Mice infected with 2 × 105 PFU of HMPV or RSV were
observed daily for development of clinical symptoms.
Unexpectedly and in contrast to the viral replication kinetics, HMPV but not RSV infection was associated with
severe weight loss (Fig. 1C). At the peak of weight loss,
mice had ruffled fur and showed heavy breathing as well
as reduced activity, but all mice finally recovered.

Penh values, representing airway obstruction (AO), were
measured on day 7 p.i., in both groups of mice. In accordance with the weight loss and other clinical signs of disease, AO was significantly higher in HMPV- than in RSVinfected mice or uninfected controls. This confirmed the
inverse relationship between viral replication and the
pathological changes (Fig. 1D).
Due to high baseline Penh values in HMPV-infected mice,
AHR measurement after methacoline treatment did not
yield significant results (data not shown).
Histopathological changes in lungs
Hematoxylin-eosin-stained lung sections obtained from
RSV-infected mice on day 7 p.i. revealed rare foci of mild
inflammatory infiltration of bronchioles and adjacent
alveoli, while no histopathology was found in uninfected
animals (Fig. 2A and 2B). By contrast, bronchioli and pulmonary parenchyma of HMPV inoculated mice showed
severe bronchopneumonia. Bronchioli and alveolar
spaces were densely packed with neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, desquamated pneumocytes, and
fibrin (Fig. 2C). Immunolabelling revealed groups of
intraalveolar macrophages and pneumocytes expressing
HMPV antigens (Fig. 2D).

HMPV versus RSV, we analyzed the inflammatory cells
recruited to the lungs on day 4 and 7 p.i.. Day 4 represents
the time of maximal virus replication and accumulation
of innate immune cells including NK cells, while day 7 is
the time point of maximal T cell recruitment and activity
in RSV-infected mice. The number of inflammatory cells
eluted from the lung airways by BAL was similar on day 4
p.i. in the HMPV- and in the RSV-infected mice. On day 7
p.i., an increase of total BAL cells was observed in both
groups, but HMPV-infected mice had significantly higher
numbers of BAL cells (Fig. 3A). Microscopic differentiation of BAL cells revealed that lymphocytes represent the
main population at both time points, with little differences among the two groups (Fig. 3B). By contrast, the

percentage and absolute numbers of neutrophils was significantly higher in the HMPV- than in the RSV-infected
mice at both time points, while macrophages were more
prominent at day 7 in RSV-infected mice. Analysis by flow
cytometry showed that 7 days after infection CD8+ T cells
were the predominant population of lymphocytes in both
infection models (Fig. 4A). The percentage of CD4+ T cells
was slightly higher after RSV infection on day 4, but no
significant differences were observed on day 7 (Fig. 4B).
Functional activity of CD8+ T cells at day 7 was evaluated
by intracellular IFN-γ staining after in vitro stimulation
with PMA-ionomycin (Fig. 4C). A high proportion of
CD8+ T cells produced IFN-γ after both infections, but
there was a trend towards higher levels of IFN-γ-producing

population declined thereafter and at day 7 comparable
numbers of NK cells were present following infection with
both viruses (Fig. 4D). At day 4 p.i., NK cell cytotoxicity
was assessed by direct ex vivo cytotoxicity of BAL cells
against YAC-1 target cells. NK cell activity was significantly
higher after infection with HMPV than after infection with
the same dose of RSV (Fig. 4E). NK cell recruitment and
activity was increased in mice infected with a 5-fold higher
RSV inoculum (106 PFU/mouse) but was still less than
that observed in mice infected with the lower HMPV dose
(Fig. 4E and data not shown). Thus, HMPV appears to be
a more potent inducer of NK cell activity than RSV.

the two infections arguing against a role for T cells in the
differences between HMPV and RSV-induced pathology.

Different pulmonary cytokine responses after HMPV and
RSV infection
To further characterize the factors that regulate HMPV
pathogenesis in the mouse model, we analyzed the production of cytokines and chemokines by BAL cells. For
this purpose, cell-free BAL fluids obtained at day 4 and at
day 7 p.i. were analyzed by cytometric bead array for the
presence of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1. Consistent with the levels of cellular infiltration observed,
HMPV-infected mice produced significantly higher levels
of TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 than RSV-infected mice at
both, day 4 and day 7 p.i.(Fig. 4F), but similar levels of
IFN-γ were measured at day 7 p.i.. Interestingly, infection
with RSV, but not with HMPV, seemed to downregulate
IL-10, which is produced to discrete levels after mock
infection. Overall significant differences were observed in
the amount of inflammatory mediators after the two
infections.

Discussion
This study shows that pulmonary infection of mice with
equivalent doses of RSV and HMPV leads to different clinical outcomes. Although RSV replicated to higher titers,
HMPV caused more severe disease associated with higher
levels of cytokines and a much stronger NK cell response.
These findings indicate important differences in the
pathogenesis of respiratory disease induced by these two
related paramyxoviruses.
HMPV reached lower titers than RSV, both in the URT and
LRT, with a single peak observed on day 4 in both infection models (Fig. 1A and 1B). An early report had suggested that HMPV replicates in lung tissue with biphasic
kinetics reaching peak titers 7 and 14 days p.i[18]. By contrast, more recent results in the mouse and in the cotton
rat model [13,14,16], showed uniphasic growth kinetics,
more consistent with our results and similar to what can
be observed after RSV infection [17]. Lower HMPV peak
titers might reflect different susceptibility of airway epithelial cells to viral infections or viral spread; in addition,
they may indicate differences in the early (innate)
immune response. Indeed, we found evidence that the NK

the lungs, with a peak observed on day 4 p.i. [26]. We
found that, even after infection with a 5-fold higher inoculum, RSV was not able to recruit and activate NK cells to
the same extent as HMPV (Fig. 4D and 4E). However, the
potential role of this cell subset for HMPV pathogenesis
has to be clarified by future approaches, such as in vivo
depletion of NK cells.
It has been suggested that the RSV G and/or SH protein
inhibit trafficking of NK cells to the lungs, since the
absence of the corresponding genes markedly increases
the number of NK cells in BAL [27]. The mechanism of
this inhibition is still unknown, but it might be an effect
of these proteins on the profile of chemokines produced
[28]. Therefore, the structural differences between the G
and the SH proteins of HMPV and RSV might be instrumental in recruiting NK cells to high levels. However, this
possibility needs to be further evaluated.

cell response is much stronger in HMPV- than RSVinfected mice.
Despite poor replication, HMPV induced considerable airway obstruction, weight loss, and histopathology, while
only minimal changes occurred in RSV-infected mice.
A closer look at the inflammatory cell infiltrates revealed
significant differences in two components of the innate
immune response. In particular, HMPV induced a more
prominent recruitment of neutrophils and NK cells to the
BAL when compared to RSV (Fig. 3B and 4D). These findings support the concept that HMPV may elicit a more
pronounced innate immune response that, on the one
hand, is beneficial for virus control but, on the other
hand, may cause more extensive immunopathology. Previous data have shown that RSV infection in the BALB/c
mouse leads to recruitment of neutrophils and NK cells to

Higher levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α
and of the C-C chemokine MCP-1 were observed in
HMPV-compared to RSV-infected mice. This is in contrast
to previous findings showing that HMPV poorly activates
inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α [29].
The discrepancy can possibly be assigned to the different
properties of the isolates used for the infection studies
(low passage clinical isolate in our study versus extensively
cell-passaged isolate [18]). In fact, pathogen-specific factors may be altered after extensive cell culture passages
thus influencing the replication pattern of and the
response to a given pathogen. For instance, it has been
shown that a non-pathogenic variant of pneumonia virus
of mice, another member of the subfamily Pneumovirinae,
was generated during in vitro passages [30].
It has been reported that RSV induces significant changes
in the mouse model only if given at high dose [17,31];
therefore, the low levels of cytokines observed in our
study after RSV infection could also be a consequence of
the different viral dose used i.e. 2 × 105 PFU/animal in our
study versus 107 PFU/animal in previous studies [16,23].
Hence, it appears that the virus load required to trigger an
inflammatory response (cytokine production as well as
recruitment of inflammatory cells) is significantly lower
in the HMPV than in the RSV infection process.
In contrast to the NK cell response, the T cell recruitment
to the lung airways showed no major differences between
the two viral infections. In the absence of defined CTL
epitopes, the functional analysis of T cells was restricted to
IFN-γ production following non-specific PMA/Ionomycin
stimulation and was found to be slightly lower after
HMPV infection than after RSV infection. However, in the
absence of data on virus-specific T cell response, these
findings should not be over-interpreted.

In pediatric patients, HMPV has been reported to cause a
disease pattern similar to that of RSV with signs and symptoms ranging from severe cough to bronchiolitis and
pneumonia [5,32]. In some studies but not in others,
HMPV infection has been associated more frequently than
RSV with acute asthma exacerbations in children
[8,33,34] and adults [35] and with more severe lower respiratory tract involvement leading to pneumonia [4,8,32].
In infants, HMPV has been reported to promote a weak
inflammatory response, with low levels of cytokines and
chemokines in respiratory secretions [6]. By contrast, in a
recent study, restimulation by HMPV of human PBMC
from previously exposed adults resulted in markedly more
robust IL-6 and significantly weaker IFN-γ response than
did restimulation by RSV [36]. Taken together, these studies indicate that, as in our mouse model, HMPV-induced
pathogenesis may differ significantly from that related to
RSV.

Conclusion
In the present work, direct comparison of HMPV and RSV
infection in the mouse model using equivalent inocula
under identical conditions has indicated important differences in the response to infection with two distinct viruses
of the Pneumovirinae subfamily, both responsible for a significant burden of disease in infants and young children.
The data suggest that the pronounced NK cell recruitment
and activation together with the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines might play a crucial role in
HMPV-related immunopathogenesis.
