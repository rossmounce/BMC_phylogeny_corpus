Abstract
Background: The classical perspective that interspecific hybridization in animals is rare has been changing due to
a growing list of empirical examples showing the occurrence of gene flow between closely related species. Using
sequence data from cyt b mitochondrial gene and three intron nuclear genes (RPL9, c-myc, and RPL3) we
investigated patterns of nucleotide polymorphism and divergence between two closely related toad species R.
marina and R. schneideri. By comparing levels of differentiation at nuclear and mtDNA levels we were able to
describe patterns of introgression and infer the history of hybridization between these species.
Results: All nuclear loci are essentially concordant in revealing two well differentiated groups of haplotypes,
corresponding to the morphologically-defined species R. marina and R. schneideri. Mitochondrial DNA analysis also
revealed two well-differentiated groups of haplotypes but, in stark contrast with the nuclear genealogies, all R.
schneideri sequences are clustered with sequences of R. marina from the right Amazon bank (RAB), while R. marina
sequences from the left Amazon bank (LAB) are monophyletic. An Isolation-with-Migration (IM) analysis using
nuclear data showed that R. marina and R. schneideri diverged at ≈ 1.69 Myr (early Pleistocene), while R. marina
populations from LAB and RAB diverged at ≈ 0.33 Myr (middle Pleistocene). This time of divergence is not
consistent with the split between LAB and RAB populations obtained with mtDNA data (≈ 1.59 Myr), which is
notably similar to the estimate obtained with nuclear genes between R. marina and R. schneideri. Coalescent
simulations of mtDNA phylogeny under the speciation history inferred from nuclear genes rejected the hypothesis
of incomplete lineage sorting to explain the conflicting signal between mtDNA and nuclear-based phylogenies.
Conclusions: The cytonuclear discordance seems to reflect the occurrence of interspecific hybridization between
these two closely related toad species. Overall, our results suggest a phenomenon of extensive mtDNA
unidirectional introgression from the previously occurring R. schneideri into the invading R. marina. We hypothesize
that climatic-induced range shifts during the Pleistocene/Holocene may have played an important role in the
observed patterns of introgression.

Background
Several recent studies have eroded the traditional perspective that interspecific hybridization is a rare phenomenon among animals, providing evidence that
closely related taxa in different groups of organisms
often share a history of introgressive hybridization (e.g.
[1,2]). However, patterns of introgression appear heterogeneous across the genome, since the exchange of genomic regions between species depends greatly on their
fitness effects or the fitness effects of linked regions [3].
In fact, there is now a growing list of studies showing
extensive gene flow at some loci, whereas other loci
remain differentiated, probably because some genomic
regions associated with species-specific adaptations and/
or reproductive isolation are less prone to introgress
[4,5]. Furthermore, it is also possible that some alleles
are more easily introgressed because they can either
confer an advantage in an alternative environment or in
a foreign genetic background [6]. The consequence of
incomplete barriers to gene exchange is semipermeable
or porous species boundaries [7,8].
While the recent availability of partially or fully
sequenced genomes have greatly facilitated the study of
patterns of introgression in model organisms, investigation of gene introgression in animals lacking those genomic resources is still a challenging task [9]. In fact, until
recently, mtDNA has been the marker of choice for
examining evolutionary relationships at the population
level and among closely related species [10]. However,
the study of a single gene is of particular concern
because its genealogy may not truly reflect the history of
populations or species, often leading to erroneous conclusions (e.g. [11]). Hence, taking advantage of recent
advances in molecular methodologies such as the development of exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) primers
(e.g. [12]), comparative studies of multiple gene genealogies, including nuclear and mtDNA markers, have been
considered an alternative tool to examine the evolutionary history of diverging taxa and, in particular, for the
detection of patterns of introgressive hybridization
among closely related species of non-model organisms
(e.g. [13,14]).
Both empirical and simulation studies have shown that
interspecific hybridization can occur as the outcome of
changing demographic conditions and/or species’ distributional ranges [15,16]. In the northern hemisphere it is
well-established that Pleistocene glacial cycles greatly
affected the evolutionary history of many organisms,
inducing population contractions and expansions following ecological changes (see [17], and references therein).
Such processes often promoted contact between divergent evolutionary units or closely related taxa after climatic amelioration, leading to the occurrence of
extensive hybridization and introgression (e.g [17,18]).

In contrast, the consequences of Pleistocene climatic
instability in the Neotropics since the early proposed
“forest refugia” hypothesis (sensu [19]) are still a matter
of intense debate. Whereas some recent studies support
that hypothesis, suggesting that Pleistocene climatic
fluctuations promoted extensive contraction and expansion of the forests following dryer and colder periods
[20,21], others argue in favour of a permanent rain forest cover all over the Amazon basin during the last glacial period, even if the combination of reduced
temperatures, precipitation and atmospheric CO2 concentrations have certainly produced changes in the composition and structure of forests [22]. Despite these
differences, both scenarios suggest an important role of
Pleistocene climatic oscillations as an engine of genetic
structure modification for many Amazon species and
communities.
Two closely related anuran species widely distributed
in South America (Rhinella marina and R. schneideri:
Bufonidae) provide a compelling case study to investigate interspecific hybridization. Across South America,
R. marina is restricted to rainforests of the Amazonian
region, whereas R. schneideri is typically found in dry
forests (Caatinga and Cerrado) along northeast and
south of Brazil, including Paraguay, Bolivia, Uruguay
and Argentina [23]. These species are morphologically
similar (but diagnosable by the presence of tibial
glands in R. schneideri) and have essentially a parapatric distribution, but may occur in sympatry along ecological transitions between humid and dry forests
(Figure 1). Previous phylogenetic analyses of the R.
marina group based on mtDNA [24,25] suggested a
division in two major clades: one including R. veredas,
R. cerradensis, R. jimi, R. marina, R. schneideri, and R.
poeppigii (north-central clade), and another including
R. arenarum, R. rubescens, R. achavali, and R. icterica
(south-central clade). Interestingly, when only samples
of R. marina located south of the Amazon river are
used this species together with R. schneideri, R. jimi
and R. poeppigii formed an unresolved polytomy [25].
While Vallinoto et al. [25] did not exclude that retention of ancestral polymorphism may explain this observation, they suggested instead that it could reflect past
or current hybridization events. Considering the different habitat preferences of R. marina and R. schneideri,
it is possible that strong environmental changes after
the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in South America
[26] may have impacted dramatically their demography
and distribution ranges, with consequences on the evolutionary trajectories of both taxa. Finally, we note that
R. marina is a highly invasive species whose history,
ecology and demography have been studied in detail in
Australia and in the Hawaian archipelago, but not in
its native range [27-29].

Sampling localities coded as in Additional file 1. White and black circles represent sample localities of R. marina from Left Amazon river bank
(LAB) and Right Amazon river bank (RAB), respectively, and gray circles correspond to sample localities of R. schneideri. The map was designed
using DIVA-GIS [96]. Gray layer is the land cover according to the tree cover, broadleaved, and evergreen option.

In this study, we focused on R. marina populations
from the eastern Amazonian region as well as on populations of R. schneideri representative of its distributional
range. We used one mitochondrial gene and three
nuclear introns to examine patterns of polymorphism
and divergence within and between the two species, and
addressed three major questions: i) are R. marina and R.
schneideri well-differentiated at the nuclear level and
how does this differentiation compares to the mtDNA
level? ii) is there evidence of hybridization between the
two species or do the results conform more with the
retention of ancestral polymorphism? and iii) can we
infer post-glacial expansion movements and is there evidence for the occurrence of a hybrid zone?

Results
Mitochondrial DNA analysis

A fragment of 327 base pairs (bp) of the cyt b gene was
obtained from 92 individuals: 65 of R. marina, and 27 of
R. schneideri (Table 1). The ingroup alignment revealed
17 distinct haplotypes, from which only five are present
in R. schneideri. The genealogical relationships between
the haplotypes (Figure 2A) showed two main haplotype
groups, one corresponding to R. marina sequences from
left Amazon bank (LAB), and the other comprising
sequences of R. marina from the right Amazon bank
(RAB) and from R. schneideri. Within the RAB group,
individuals from the northwestern population (ST) and
from all northeastern populations (SO, AL and VI) were
included in two different sub-groups. Individuals from

central-south Amazonian forest (CC) were clustered in
both sub-groups of RAB (Figure 2A and Figure 2B).
With the exception of Paraguay localities (IT, LI and
AM), all sampled populations of R. schneideri exhibit
haplotype H14, which was fixed in PO, RC and MN.
This haplotype was also present in three R. marina individuals from Canaã dos Carajás (CC) (Figure 2A andAdditional file 1).
Nuclear genealogical analysis

For the RPL9 nuclear fragment, we obtained 94
sequences from 47 individuals (32 R. marina and 15 R.
schneideri). The ingroup alignment (504 bp) revealed 30
haplotypes (19 and 11 for R. marina and R. schneideri,
respectively), defined by 41 polymorphic sites and 29
parsimoniously informative sites. While a minimum of
three recombination events (Rm) was found in RPL9 for
R. marina and R. schneideri, no statistical evidence for
the occurrence of recombination was detected (P >
0.05) using the Fw test (Table 1 and Additional file 1).
For the RPL3 nuclear fragment, we obtained 110
sequences from 55 individuals (40 R. marina and 15 R.
schneideri). The ingroup alignment (678 bp) revealed 29
haplotypes (19 and 10 for R. marina and R. schneideri,
respectively) defined by 27 polymorphic sites, from
which 23 were parsimoniously informative sites. A minimum number of two recombination events (Rm) was
inferred for both species, but no statistical support was
found when the Fw test (P > 0.05) was used (Table 1
and Additional file 1).

* P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01. (1) Considering the two copies in the case of nuclear loci.

For the c-myc nuclear fragment, we obtained 76
sequences from 38 individuals (26 R. marina and 12 R.
schneideri). The ingroup alignment (585 bp) revealed 16
haplotypes (10 and 6 for R. marina and R. schneideri,
respectively) defined by 15 polymorphic sites, from
which 13 were parsimoniously informative sites. According to both Rm and Fw tests, no evidence for recombination was observed in c-myc sequences (Table 1 and
Additional file 1).
For all nuclear loci, haplotypes clustered in two groups
corresponding to R. marina and R. schneideri, separated
by a minimum of two (c-myc) and a maximum of twelve
(RPL9) fixed differences (Figure 3A, Figure 3B and Figure 3C). The only exception to the species-specific
group of haplotypes occurred in RPL3, where three individuals of R. marina from Canaã dos Carajás (CC) were
heterozygous, and their haplotypes clustered both within
R. Schneideri (H13 and H14) and the R. marina group
(H7, H8 and H10) (Figure 3B and Figure 3E). Within
the two geographically-defined groups of R. marina, we
observed shared polymorphism (Table 2).
The reconstruction of the phylogenetic species tree
based on the three nuclear genes is shown in Figure 3D.
While none of the three nuclear loci examined in this
study was completely sorted with regard to LAB and
RAB groups of R. marina, a Bayesian species tree inference method produced a high posterior probability (P =
1.0) for their sister-taxa relationship. The placement of

R. schneideri with respect to R. marina (LAB)/R. marina
(RAB) and the weakly supported clade R. icterica/R. arenarum were unresolved.
Patterns of nucleotide variation and divergence

Patterns of nucleotide diversity within each species and
for each main clade identified using the phylogenetic
analysis are summarized in Table 1. Levels of diversity
were highly variable across loci and within species.
Across nuclear loci, c-myc exhibited lower levels of
variability than RPL3 and RPL9. At the species level, R.
schneideri presented, in general, lower levels of diversity when compared to R. marina, except for c-myc.
One of the most remarkable differences was detected
at the mtDNA cyt b gene, where π was considerably
lower for R. schneideri (π = 0.131) than was observed
in both R. marina groups (π = 0.338 and π = 0.904 for
LAB and RAB, respectively). Tajima’s D, Fu’s Fs and
R2 statistics were highly variable among loci, although
essentially non-significant (P > 0.05). The main exceptions occurred in R. schneideri for the cyt b gene and
in R. marina RAB group for the c-myc nuclear locus.
In the former cyt b had a significantly negative skew
for Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs tests, while in the latter all
tests showed significant deviations from neutral expectations for c-myc, also exhibiting negative values for
Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs tests, and a low value for R 2
(Table 1).

haplotype, coded as a number (Additional file 1), is proportional to its frequency. Asterisks mark haplotypes present in both species. Dots
represent inferred unsampled or extinct haplotypes.

At the mtDNA level, the divergence measured by Da
and Dxy between samples of R. marina from RAB and
LAB was approximately twofold higher than the divergence between R. marina from RAB and R. schneideri.
The average distance between the RAB group and R.
schneideri ranged between 0.48% and 1.0% for Da and
Dxy, respectively. RAB and LAB groups showed values
of divergence of 1.67% and 2.29% for D a and D xy ,
respectively (Table 2). At the nuclear level, the divergence between R. marina and R. schneideri ranged from
a minimum of 0.74% and 0.93% (c-myc) to a maximum
of 2.45% and 3.12% (RPL9) for Da and Dxy, respectively.
Divergence times and coalescent simulations

The approximate posterior density curves of the model
parameters which resulted from the analyses using the
Isolation-with-Migration model implemented in the
software IMa2 are shown in Additional file 2. Posterior
distributions of parameter estimates were consistent

across replicate runs with effective sample sizes (ESSs)
values>120, and there was no evidence of trends in the
ASCII-based parameter trendline plots. However, the
right tail of the posterior density curves was often relatively flat and failed to reach zero in the estimates of
divergence time and ancestral effective population size.
By consequence, in most of these cases the 95% HPD
(highest posterior density) estimates were not reliable,
reflecting some degree of uncertainty, and so they
should be interpreted with caution (Table 3). Based on
nuclear data, our IMa2 analysis showed that the split
between R. marina and R. schneideri was estimated to
be ≈ 1.69 Myr, and the split between R. marina populations from RAB and LAB occurred at ≈ 0.33 Myr. For
the mtDNA analysis the split between LAB and RAB
occurred at ≈ 1.59 Myr. We also estimated the posterior
distributions of IMa2 parameters considering the two
clades uncovered by mtDNA phylogeny (LAB and RAB
+ R. schneideri; Figure 2 and table 3). This analysis

migration rate; 2Nm) for each pairwise comparison were
significantly different from zero we used the LLR tests
implemented in IMa2. Our results indicated a significant
level of gene flow only from R. marina LAB to RAB
populations when information of nuclear genes is used
(2Nm = 2.15; 95% HPD = 0.75 - 5.05; LLR = 8.71; P <
0.01).
Given that we found mtDNA shared variation between
species, we conducted coalescent simulations to investigate whether the conflicting signal found in the mtDNA
versus nuclear DNA-based phylogenies could be
explained by incomplete lineage sorting. We simulated
mtDNA sequence datasets under a model with no gene
flow and using parameter estimates of divergence times
and N e (effective population size) inferred from the
IMa2 analysis using nuclear loci. The model included
two historical events: i) an ancestral haploid population
with Ne≈63,000 that splits into LAB (with Ne≈69,000)
and RAB (with Ne≈190,000) populations at 325,000 generations in the past; and ii) an ancestral haploid population with approximately Ne≈103,000 that splits into two
descendant populations with Ne≈269,000 (R. marina;
RAB+LAB) and Ne≈143,000 (R. schneideri) at 1,690,000

Discussion
Our analysis of patterns of genetic variability and phylogenetic relationships in a comprehensive set of R. marina and R. schneideri populations from South America
clearly suggests a compelling case of massive unidirectional mtDNA introgressive hybridization between these
taxa. More specifically, we found that i) both species are
highly divergent at the nuclear level, a fact that is not
observed at the mtDNA level, ii) the previously
described mtDNA/nuclear discordance in populations of
R. marina are more easily explained by interspecific
hybridization and not by the retention of ancestral polymorphism, as revealed by coalescent simulations of
mtDNA phylogeny under the speciation history inferred
from nuclear genes, and iii) the application of the Isolation-with-Migration model (IM) to nuclear data suggests
that R. marina and R. schneideri diverged at about 1.7
Myr ago, while estimates of divergence between R. marina LAB and RAB populations suggest a split time in
the middle Pleistocene (≈ 0.33 Myr). This time of divergence is not consistent with the split between the two
main mtDNA clades LAB and RAB + R. schneideri (≈
1.67 Myr). Below, we discuss all these issues in detail
and suggest that the most likely explanation for the
cytonuclear discordance resulted from the capture of R.
schneideri mtDNA by the invading R. marina.
Introgressive hybridization vs retention of ancestral
polymorphism

Conflicting mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees among
closely related species are often taken as an indication
of mtDNA introgression due to interspecific hybridization (e.g [30]). However, the alternative scenario of
incomplete lineage sorting may also result on the frequently observed pattern of mtDNA paraphyly or polyphyly. While the lower effective population size of
mtDNA implicates that lineages sort out more easily
among species than in the nuclear genome [1,31], the
fact is that in most cases the two alternative hypotheses
are not explicitly tested.
Our phylogenetic analysis of cyt b gene sequences
showed that both taxa do not form monophyletic
groups, revealing instead two major groups of haplotypes, one corresponding to R. marina samples from
LAB, and the other including both R. marina from RAB
and R. schneideri (Figure 2). This close relationship
between R. marina and R. schneideri was already
reported by Vallinoto et al. [25] based on a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the R. marina group using a larger

Sequeira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/264

mtDNA fragment (ca. 2000 bp). These results are in
stark contrast with the phylogenetic pattern observed
for nuclear loci both inferred by network haplotype genealogical relationships and by the species tree coalescent
method that takes into account differential lineage sorting across markers (Figure 3). Networks of nuclear loci
are basically concordant in revealing two highly divergent groups of haplotypes, corresponding to morphological-defined R. marina and R. schneideri species. The
three nuclear loci exhibited a lack of shared haplotypes
and a number of fixed differences between the two species that ranged from two to twelve, while a pattern of
shared polymorphism was observed within the two geographically-defined groups of R. marina (LAB and RAB)
(Figure 3; Table 2). The only exception to these speciesspecific groups of haplotypes occurred at the RPL3 gene,
where three R. marina individuals sampled in Canaã dos
Carajás (CC) shared haplotypes clustered within both R.
schneideri and R. marina species. The Bayesian species
tree reconstruction corroborates the monophyly of R.
marina, supporting a close relationship between LAB
and RAB populations (Figure 3D).
The close relationship between R. marina populations
based on nuclear loci is supported by the use of a coalescent-based Isolation-with-Migration model (IMa2). This
analysis suggested that R. marina and R. schneideri likely
diverged at ≈ 1.7 Myr, while the inferred split time
between R. marina LAB and RAB populations was at ≈
0.33 Myr ago. In contrast, the divergence time for the different pairwise comparisons across the Amazon River
bank populations based on mtDNA (including between
LAB and RAB R. marina populations) or combining all
loci (see Table 3 and Additional file 2) is always similar
to that obtained for R. marina and R. schneideri (≈ 1.6 1.7 Myr). Coalescent simulations of mtDNA phylogeny
under the speciation history inferred from nuclear genes
clearly show that this conflicting signal found in the
mtDNA-based phylogeny relative to the nuclear DNA
could not be explained by incomplete lineage sorting. In
fact, the monophyly of R. schneideri was recovered in
99.7% of the simulated mtDNA gene trees, and stands in
contrast with the observed pattern of shared mtDNA
sequences between this species and R. marina RAB
populations. Accordingly, even after accounting for stochasticity and uncertainties in mutation rates (see Material and Methods), we can discard the hypothesis of
incomplete lineage sorting as the explanation for the
cytonuclear discordance reported here. Instead, we interpret our data as supporting an unidirectional massive
mtDNA introgression between these species.
Extensive unidirectional mtDNA introgression

Together with the current knowledge about the geographical distribution of both species, our results favour

Page 8 of 15

the hypothesis that the mitochondrial lineage detected
in the right Amazon bank likely belonged to R. schneideri and was subsequently captured by R. marina. Notably, this hypothesis implicates that R. schneideri must
have occupied a significant part of the Amazon and its
extinction from this region was presumably preceded by
a process of replacement driven by R. marina populations expanding southwards. A scenario supporting this
hypothesis - under which such massive interspecific unidirectional mtDNA introgression could have taken place
- has recently been proposed and modelled [32]. Following this model, when the territory of a resident species
is invaded by another more successful species, even rare
hybridization events at the front of this expansion can
lead to introgression from the resident species into the
expanding one. Drift at the front of the invasion and
during the following expansion is responsible for
repeated and transient secondary contacts among species, promoting situations of competitive replacement.
In one of the most remarkable examples reported to
date, Alves et al. [15] described how three Iberian hare
species (Lepus granatensis, L. europaeus and L. castroviejoi) were extensively introgressed by the mtDNA of L.
timidus, a boreal species presently extinct in Iberia.
These authors indicated that L. timidus could have
occurred in a significant part of Iberia during the LGM,
but subsequently became extinct after climatic amelioration and competitively replaced by the more adapted
temperate Iberian species that likely experienced a
northwards range expansion [33].
The impact of Quaternary environmental changes in
the Neotropical region has been the subject of extensive
and controversial debate. In fact, there is a growing
body of evidence originating in palaeoclimatological,
palynological and palaecological data, but also in molecular phylogeographic studies [20], suggesting that significant changes in the Amazonian rainforest and
Cerrado may have occurred during the late Pleistocene
and the Holocene [34-36]. During previous drier glacial
periods, the Cerrado expanded and may have penetrated
into the Amazon forest, while most parts of the southern present-day Cerrado might have contracted due to
strong cold fronts and to the expansion of subtropical
grasslands [37,38]. Since the middle Holocene, a change
towards more humid climatic conditions has occurred,
promoting the expansion of the Amazon forest and also
the southward re-establishment of Cerrado [39]. These
climatic-induced changes seem to have played an important role on the evolutionary history of a great diversity
of organisms [34,40,41]. For example, Ramos et al. [41]
suggested that during glacial times the tree Hymenaea
stigonocarpa became extinct in most parts of southern
present-day Cerrado, being restricted to the milder climatic conditions of the northernmost and easternmost

Sequeira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/264

regions of this biome. After postglacial climate amelioration, this species expanded its range southwards.
Accordingly, it is tempting to consider that recent climatic oscillations forced dramatic changes in species
distributions, including the Neotropical toads R. marina
and R. schneideri. These transient environmental conditions could have created the opportunity for these two
species to meet and hybridize, a situation that may have
been likely favoured by similar breeding behaviour and
coincidence of reproductive seasons [42,43].
Following this hypothesis, the current distribution of
R. schneideri (Figure 1A) seems to result from its recent
retreat from the Amazon and a subsequent southward
expansion into the present-day Cerrado biome, as evidenced by the low levels of mitochondrial diversity in all
current distribution area. In fact, part of these populations is fixed for haplotype H14. Introgression from R.
schneideri into R. marina could then correspond to
phases of forest expansion, when the latter species
would be favoured and eventually replaced the former
[44]. The tendency toward negative values for Tajima’s
D and Fu’s Fs and low values for the R 2 statistic
observed in RAB populations across all loci could be
interpreted as a signal of population expansion. In addition, indirect evidences that likely highlight the importance of climatic/ecological changes on the evolutionary
history of these toad species are provided by some
unique genetic signals present in Canaã do Carajás
(CC). This population represents a small remnant island
of the Cerrado biome within the humid Amazon forest
[38,45] and correspond to the single location where we
detected three individuals of R. marina having R. schneideri RPL3 haplotypes and the most frequent and widespread mtDNA haplotype of R. schneideri (H14). Taken
together, this evidence may suggest that the population
of Canaã dos Carajás could be located close to the putative hybrid zone between R. marina and R. schneideri.
Future studies should clarify this question and, in particular, investigate if that hybrid zone is defined by a clear
boundary between the dry and rain forest or corresponds instead to a more complex and patchy region
due to the occurrence of multiple cerrado islands within
the Amazonian forest.
Implications of selective and neutral processes for
asymmetric introgression

When introgression of mtDNA from one species into
another occurs, foreign mtDNA can completely replace
resident mtDNA through selective or neutral processes
[4,46]. The effects of directional selection on mtDNA
could produce changes in the patterns of genetic variability generating a star-like genealogy and a significantly
skew towards low-frequency alleles [47-49]. Both Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs tests of the frequency spectrum of

Page 9 of 15

mutations are significantly skewed towards rare alleles
in the mitochondrial genealogy of R. schneideri (Table
1). There are many evidences that various sorts of selection pressures could act on mtDNA (reviewed in
[50,51]), driving in some cases extensive mtDNA introgression [4]. However, this kind of deviation may be
confounded by the influence of demographic history,
which could have a similar impact on variability patterns
under neutrality (e.g [4,14,33]). For example, deviations
from a neutral model of DNA sequence variation closely
linked to a site that has undergone a selective sweep
may be similar to those in populations that experienced
an expansion [50,52]. Both empirical and simulation studies have suggested that some alleles occurring at the
front of a range expansion could travel with the wave of
advance (surfing) over long distances and eventually
reach high frequencies [33,53]. Likewise, a reduction in
population size would also cause a depletion of genetic
diversity by the action of genetic drift alone, which is
more pronounced at mtDNA markers due to its lower
effective size compared to nuclear markers (e.g [32,54]).
Other often reported explanations for differential introgression of mtDNA versus nuclear loci are male biased dispersal and dissortative mating, especially when prezygotic
isolation models like female-preference or male-male competition are implicated [44]. However, such patterns could
also be explained by postzygotic asymmetries (e.g [55]), in
which reciprocal crosses resulted in different degrees of
hybrid viability or fitness, or a combination of both preand postzygotic effects [56]. In amphibians, many examples
of unidirectional introgression due to asymmetric reproductive behaviour have been reported, as expected in polygynous mating systems such as those found in bufonids
([57]; but see [58]). While to date natural hybridization in
the R. marina group has only been demonstrated between
R. icterica and R. schneideri [59], our data clearly suggest
that this phenomenon is probably more widespread than
reported so far. An extensive study involving more than
1900 laboratory crosses between 92 species of bufonids
showed that crosses between R. marina females and both
R. poeppigii and R. arenarum males resulted in hybrid offspring constituted only by females, while crosses involving
R. schneideri females and R. arenarum males produced
hybrids of both sexes [60,61]. While we cannot discard the
possibility that asymmetric reproductive isolation could
have resulted in the observed asymmetrical mtDNA introgression between R. marina and R. schneideri, further studies investigating the existence and the extent of pre- and/
or postzygotic barriers between these species are required
to examine this hypothesis.

Conclusions
Our results clearly suggest that the closely related R.
marina and R. schneideri shared a history of

Sequeira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/264

introgressive hybridization. Nuclear analyses support the
monophyly of both species, a fact that would have not
been perceived if our inferences were based solely on
the mtDNA analysis. Another important inference of
this work is that past environmental changes have likely
played a crucial role for the occurrence of hybridization
in the Neotropics. This is of special interest considering
recent habitat changes due to extensive deforestation of
the Amazonian forest in last decades for industrial and
agriculture purposes. In fact, it has been demonstrated
that human-induced environmental changes could create the opportunity to increase the area of sympatry and
the likelihood of hybridization between many closely
related taxa (e.g [62]). Future research focusing on transition areas between the Amazon rain forest and the dry
forests of Cerrado and Caatinga will be crucial for a
deeper understanding of the consequences of the complex past climate and present-day environmental
changes on the evolutionary trajectory of organisms.

Amplification conditions of 94°C for 3 min, followed by
30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, annealing temperature of
54°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, and a single final step
at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR conditions for RPL9, RPL3
and c-myc amplifications were the same of those
described in [12]. PCRs were carried out in 10 μl
volume containing 1× PCR buffer; 3 mM MgCl 2 ; 0.4
mM each dNTPs; 0.5 U of GoTaq DNA polymerase
(Promega); 0.3 μM each primer and approximately 50
ng of genomic DNA. Amplification conditions consisted
of a pre-denaturing step of 5 min at 92°C followed by
40 cycles of a denaturing step of 30 s at 92°C, annealing
temperature ranging between 50-54°C for 30 s and
extension at 72°C for 90 s. The final extension was
accomplished at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were
enzymatically purified with the ExoSap-IT purifying kit
(Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech) and sequenced in both
directions using BigDye 3.1 on an Applied Biosystems
3100 DNA automatic sequencer, according to protocols
supplied by the manufacturers (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA).

Taxon sampling and laboratory methods

A total of 95 tissue samples of R. marina (68) and R.
schneideri (27) from different regions of Brazil and Paraguay were obtained through field work and also from
museum preserved samples in the case of R. schneideri
(Figure 1B; Additional file 1). Total DNA was extracted
from each sample using the standard phenol-chloroform
method, followed by sodium acetate precipitation [63].
We obtained sequences of the mitochondrial Cytochrome b (cyt b) gene, and the nuclear intron 6 of the
ribosomal protein L9 (RPL9int6, thereafter RPL9), the
intron 5 of the ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3int5, thereafter RPL3) and the partial exon and intron 2 of the cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-myc). Sequences of
the three nuclear genes were obtained for Rhinella arenarum and Rhinella icterica, which were used as outgroups [25]. The following primers were used for
amplification and sequencing: for cyt b - primers
CytbFor and CytbRev [64]; for RPL9 - primers RPL9intF
and RPL9intR [12]; for RPL3-primers RPL5F and
RPL36RA [12]; and for c-myc - primers Cmyc1U [65]
and Cmyccat3 (5’- GTTGYTGCTGATCTGTTTGAG 3’) were used for initial amplification and sequencing.
After this, internal primers were specifically designed for
this study MarCmycF (5’-TGA TGC ATA GAC CCT
TCG GTG-3’) and MarCmycR (5’-GAT AGT CCG
CTC TGG TGG AAG-3’).
PCR conditions for cyt b amplification were done
according to those reported in [25]. Amplifications were
performed using ~10 ng of genomic DNA; Tris-HCl pH
8.85, 25 mM KCl; 5 mM MgCl2; 0.2 mM each dNTPs;
0.5 μM of each primer and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Sequence analysis

For nuclear sequences we used two approaches to
resolve the haplotype phase: i) the method of [66] for
sequences that were heterozygous for insertions or deletions; and ii) the Bayesian algorithm of PHASE [67]
implemented in the DNAsp v.5 [68] using known phases
of haplotypes determined by the previous method. This
analysis was run multiple times (3) with different seeds
for the random-number generator and checked if haplotype estimation was consistent across runs. Each run
was conducted for 1.0 × 106 iterations with the default
values. Haplotypes with a probability less than 0.95
probabilities were excluded from the analysis. For all the
analyses we completely removed indels because they did
not significantly reduce the number of polymorphic
sites, nor disregard information contained in the data
sets. After these procedures, sequences were edited and
aligned in BioEdit v. 5.0.6 [69]. Alignments of protein
coding gene (cyt b) were unambiguous with no insertions or deletions. All the sequences obtained in this
study were deposited in GenBank under numbers
JN594508-JN594607.
For both mtDNA and nuclear fragments we calculated
summary statistics in DNAsp, which include: π, nucleotide diversity [70]; θ, Watterson population mutation
parameter [71]; S, number of segregating sites, and Fu’s
Fs [47], Tajima’s D [49] and R2 [48] neutrality tests. Significance values of all statistical tests were computed
using the coalescent simulator implemented in DNAsp
by comparing estimated values against a distribution
generated from 10,000 random samples under the
hypothesis of selective neutrality and population

Sequeira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/264

equilibrium, with no recombination [72]. To evaluate
the possibility of recombination we computed the Rm
statistic (minimum number of recombination events)
[73] using DNAsp. We also used the software PHIPACK
to test for recombination using the pairwise homoplasy
index (Fw statistic) [74], because Rm is likely to be
highly affected by homoplasy. We used the permutation
test (1000 permutations) to estimate P-values.
Genealogical relationships among haplotypes for each
locus were first estimated using a network-approach.
Haplotype networks were estimated using the median
joining (MJ) method [75] as implemented in the software NETWORK v. 4.1.1.2 [76]. However, because networks applying the aforementioned method recovered
many unresolved loops in the genealogical connections
between haplotypes (Additional file 3), we generated
haplotype networks using phylogenetic algorithms with
migration and using proper models of sequence evolution [77]. Phylogenetic reconstructions among haplotypes for each locus were estimated using a Maximum
Likelihood (ML) approach, as implemented in the software PHYML 3.0 [78]. Using default options we ran the
program with the best fit model for each locus as
selected by Kakusan4 [79]. The generated trees were
used to estimate each network haplotype in Haploviewer
program [77].
Divergence time estimates and coalescent simulations

The use of Isolation-with-Migration model (IMa2) involving more than two populations requires a rooted phylogenetic tree with known sequence in time of internal
nodes [80]. Accordingly, we first reconstructed a phylogenetic tree based on the three nuclear genes using the
species tree inference methodology *BEAST [81], as
implemented in BEAST v1.6.1 [82]. In *BEAST, the
assignment of specimens to taxa must be given as a
prior for the analysis. For this purpose, we defined three
groups: i) R. marina sequences were divided in the two
different geographic groups of populations, RAB and
LAB; and, ii) all R. schneideri sequences were defined as
a group, The toads R. icterica and R. arenarum were
used as outgroups [24,25]. The input file for *BEAST
was created using the application BEAUti [82] and partitions and models were edited by hand to fit models for
each unlinked nuclear fragment, as determined with
Kakusan4. Posterior phylogenies were determined in
*BEAST using a relaxed lognormal clock model and the
prior was set to the default option of Yule process [83].
All remaining priors were set to the defaults. Three
replicate runs of 500 million generations were conducted, sampling trees and parameter estimates every
50,000 generations. Convergence was checked using
Tracer v1.5 [84] and summary trees were generated
with TreeAnnotator v1.6.1 [82].

Page 11 of 15

We used IMa2 [80] to estimate the divergence time (t)
between: i) R. marina and R. schneideri [RM (LAB +
RAB) × RS] using combined information from the three
nuclear loci; ii) populations of R. marina from left
(LAB) and right (RAB) Amazon bank LAB × RAB using
information from all three nuclear loci; iii) populations
of R. marina from left (LAB) and right (RAB) Amazon
bank + R. schneideri [LAB × (RAB + RS)] using mtDNA
alone; and iv) R. marina and R. schneideri combining all
markers and assuming that mtDNA from RAB population belong to R. schneideri [RM (LAB + RAB) × RS
(RAB + RS)] (see Table 3). We used the HKY model of
evolution [85], which takes into account the possibility
of multiple hits, differences in nucleotide frequencies
and the presence of transition/transversion bias. We ran
the program under Metropolis Coupled MCMC, using
ten chains with linear heating mode. Multiple preliminary runs were conducted to assess mixing of the chains,
as well as to determine appropriate priors for the parameters. After this, we ran the program multiple times
with different random seeds and for each simulation the
length was > 10 × 10 6 steps, where the first 10 × 105
was discarded as burn-in. Convergence by the Markov
chain simulations to stationary distribution was checked
by monitoring multiple independent runs for each data
set using different random number seeds (similar posterior distributions for each parameter across independent runs) and by assessing effective sample sizes (ESSs)
values (ESS > 100), trendline plots, and swapping rates
between chains over the course of the run. The estimates for t were converted into time in years since
divergence (t) using the equation, t = t*μ, where μ is the
neutral mutation rate for the locus.
Inferred rates of sequence divergence for cyt b of
amphibians were estimated by Lougheed et al. [86], and
range from 0.8% to 2.5% per Myr. In particular, Bufonid
mtDNA evolution has been estimated [87] at about
1.38% sequence divergence based on divergence for the
ND1+tRNA’s mitochondrial region between Bufo gargarizans (from the eastern Tibetan Plateau) and Bufo
viridis (an European species) and the estimated time for
the vicariant event caused by the uplifting of the Tibetan
Plateau [87]. Although these molecular evolutionary
rates were estimated using different genes than the ones
used here [88], comparing the sequence divergence
between those taxa for 519 bp of cyt b [89] showed that
the rates among these two genes are roughly comparable. Therefore, we considered reasonable to assume a
substitution rate of 1.38% per Myr (0.69 × 10 -8 site/
Myr) in this study. Similarly, substitution rates for all
nuclear markers used here are unknown for Rhinella
species group. Nevertheless, the rate of evolution for the
same c-myc region used in this study has been estimated
to be 2.01 × 10-9 site/Myr based on sequence divergence

Sequeira et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/264

between the Central and South American species of the
Neotropical frog Eleutherodactylus [90]. Although
nuclear mutation rates are quite variable among genes
and organisms, a value of ≈ 2 × 10-9 substitutions/site/
year has been estimated for a wide range of vertebrates
[91-93]. Thus, in this study we choose the mutation rate
estimates reported for the Neotropical amphibians [90].
Because we only have calibrations for c-myc among the
nuclear dataset and for mitochondrial cyt b gene, we
used mutation rate scalars estimated in IMa2. For conversions, we multiplied t by the mutation rate scalars for
c-myc and cyt b and then divided this value by the geometric mean of the mutation rates for the two loci.
Although temporal and demographic estimates using
the above described approach have been widely applied,
we must acknowledge that scalar manipulations of estimated mutation rates could be a potential source of
inference error. In fact, accurate estimation of divergence times is especially critical in the absence of welldefined calibration points from independent data (e.g.,
dated fossil records, known biogeographic events, or
paleoclimatic reconstructions), or due to the stochastic
nature of molecular substitution rates. Despite this, we
consider this approach as a valuable tool to provide a
more comprehensive view of the temporal window and
historical demography of our species.
In order to assess whether the phylogenetic conflicting
signal found between mtDNA and nuclear DNA could
be explained by incomplete lineage sorting, we tested
the possibility of recovering the phylogenetic pattern
inferred from mtDNA under the speciation scenario
inferred from nuclear DNA. For that, we simulated
mtDNA sequence datasets under a model with no gene
flow and the population history (species-tree) and parameter estimates (IMa2) inferred from nuclear DNA,
using SimCoal2 [94]. Estimates of current and ancestral
effective population sizes Ne) and divergence times (t)
obtained under an Isolation-with-Migration model
(IMa2) were used as input for SimCoal2. A total of
10,000 simulated mtDNA sequence datasets, mimicking
the empirical mtDNA datasets (sequence lengths and
sample sizes), under a model with two historical events
were produced: i) an ancestral haploid population of
effective size NeA /2 split into N e1 /2 (LAB) and N e2 /2
(RAB) populations at t generations ago and, ii) an ancestral haploid population of size NeA/2 split into two descendants of size Ne1/2 (R. marina; RAB+LAB) and Ne2/
2 (R. schneideri), t generations ago. Since we did not
obtain accurate estimates for NeA of R. marina and R.
schneideri, we considered NeA as the average between R.
marina and R. schneideri effective population sizes. We
used the mtDNA mutation rate (μ) aforementioned and
a generation time of one year [43]. Theta (θ) was converted to Ne using the equation θ = 4Neμ. Sequences

Page 12 of 15

were generated using a mutation model with unequal
transition-transversion rate (the transition proportion
was determined for the empirical datasets with Kakusan4. Garli v1.0 [95] was used to reconstruct mtDNA
Maximum Likelihood trees from the data simulated in
each of the simulated data replicates. Garli was set to
run until no significantly better scoring topology (as
defined by the default settings) was encountered after
5,000,000 generations. Five replicate runs were performed to check for the consistency of the estimates.
We rejected the incomplete lineage sorting scenario if
the non-monophyly of R. schneideri (the pattern
observed with the empirical mtDNA dataset) was
inferred in less than 5% of the simulated datasets.
