Abstract
Background: Members of the small multidrug resistance (SMR) protein family are integral
membrane proteins characterized by four α-helical transmembrane strands that confer resistance
to a broad range of antiseptics and lipophilic quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) in bacteria.
Due to their short length and broad substrate profile, SMR proteins are suggested to be the
progenitors for larger α-helical transporters such as the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and
drug/metabolite transporter (DMT) superfamily. To explore their evolutionary association with
larger multidrug transporters, an extensive bioinformatics analysis of SMR sequences (> 300
Bacteria taxa) was performed to expand upon previous evolutionary studies of the SMR protein
family and its origins.
Results: A thorough annotation of unidentified/putative SMR sequences was performed placing
sequences into each of the three SMR protein subclass designations, namely small multidrug
proteins (SMP), suppressor of groEL mutations (SUG), and paired small multidrug resistance (PSMR)
using protein alignments and phylogenetic analysis. Examination of SMR subclass distribution within
Bacteria and Archaea taxa identified specific Bacterial classes that uniquely encode for particular
SMR subclass members. The extent of selective pressure acting upon each SMR subclass was
determined by calculating the rate of synonymous to non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions
using Syn-SCAN analysis. SUG and SMP subclasses are maintained under moderate selection
pressure in comparison to integron and plasmid encoded SMR homologues. Conversely, PSMR
sequences are maintained under lower levels of selection pressure, where one of the two PSMR
pairs diverges in sequence more rapidly than the other. SMR genomic loci surveys identified
potential SMR efflux substrates based on its gene association to putative operons that encode for
genes regulating amino acid biogenesis and QAC-like metabolites. SMR subclass protein
transmembrane domain alignments to Bacterial/Archaeal transporters (BAT), DMT, and MFS
sequences supports SMR participation in multidrug transport evolution by identifying common TM
domains.
Conclusion: Based on this study, PSMR sequences originated recently within both SUG and SMP
clades through gene duplication events and it appears that SMR members may be evolving towards
specific metabolite transport.

Background
Anthropogenic drug overuse combined with the rapid
horizontal distribution of multidrug efflux genes encoded
on mobile genetic elements has facilitated drug resistance
in distant or unrelated microorganisms [1-3]. One such
gene encode small multidrug resistance (SMR) proteins
which are frequently identified within the 3' conserved
region of mobile genetic elements referred to as integrons
[4] and on various multidrug resistance plasmids [5-8].
SMR proteins are characterized by their short amino acid
length (100–150 amino acids) resulting in a four transmembrane (TM) stranded α-helical protein that confers
low-level resistance to a broad range of drugs using proton
motive force (as reviewed by [9]). These drugs include a
wide variety of antiseptics, namely quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) and toxic lipophilic compounds, such as DNA interchelating dyes (as reviewed by
[9]). In addition to QAC, members of the SMR protein
family also demonstrate the ability to efflux other compounds such as potentially toxic metabolites like nicotine
intermediates [10] and polyamine compounds like spermidine [11] implying that SMR proteins may play a
broader role in toxic compound regulation.
The SMR protein family can be subdivided into three subclasses namely, small multidrug proteins (SMP), suppressor of groEL mutations (SUG), and paired small multidrug
resistance (PSMR) subclasses (reviewed by [9,12]). The
SMP subclass is characterized by its ability to confer host
resistance to a broad range of lipophilic drugs and QAC.
Members from the SMP subclass include small multidrug
resistance (Smr) proteins from Archaea and Firmicutes,
ethidium multidrug resistance protein E (EmrE) from Proteobacteria, and plasmid and/or integron encoded Qac
proteins such as QacE, QacF and QacH (as reviewed by
[9]). Proteins from this subclass are the most frequently
studied members within the SMR family and Escherichia
coli EmrE (Eco-EmrE) serve as the paradigm for all SMR
members.
SUG subclass members were initially identified based on
their ability to suppress groEL mutation phenotypes [13]
and these proteins are speculated to support cellular chaperone activity (as reviewed by [9,12]). Members from this
subclass confer host resistance to a limited subset of QAC
compounds emphasizing their distinction from other
SMR homologues [14,15]. To date, the SUG subclass consists primarily of SugE members identified from bacterial
genomes but additional SUG homologues are also present
on integrons and conjugative multidrug resistance plasmids [16,17] that include, qacC' [18] and smr-2 [19].
Members of the SUG subclass have been identified within
a variety of Bacterial classes yet only two homologues are
functionally characterized to date, specifically E. coli SugE

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/140

(Eco-SugE) and
[12,14,15,20].

Citrobacter

freundii

(Cfr-SugE)

Members of the PSMR subclass are distinct from both
SMP or SUG subclasses since they require co-expression of
two SMR homologues to confer host resistance to QAC
and toxic metabolites [10,11,21-25]. Generally, the genes
encoding for PSMR protein pairs are located adjacently in
a single operon at a separate genetic locus from other SMR
subclass members within the host [26,27]. To date, the
PSMR subclass includes the experimentally characterized
pairs YdgE (MdtI)/YdgF (MdtJ) in Proteobacteria, and
YkkC/YkkD, YvdR/YvdS, EbrA/EbrB, and YvaD/YvaE in
Actinobacteria. However, not all PSMR members have
demonstrated drug resistance, namely B. subtilis YvdR/
YvdS and YvaD only of the YvaD/YvaE pair [26] which
suggests that these SMR homologues are likely involved in
the transport of as yet unidentified compounds or metabolites.
Each SMR subclass is thought to have a similar structural
architecture based on hydropathy plot analysis and predicts that all SMR homologues adopt four TM strands connected by short loops of varying hydrophilicity [26,28].
One of the most highly conserved amino acid residues
found within any of the TM strands is a negatively charged
Glu residue (position 14 according to Eco-EmrE) in TM
strand 1 (TM1). Biochemical studies of SMR subclass
members from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
hosts have identified the importance of this residue for
transport activity as part of the active site (as reviewed by
[9]). Previous examination of SMR protein alignments
have revealed that SMP and SUG subclasses possess
unique conserved amino acid motifs that likely reflect
these functional differences [9].
The short length and limited number of TM strands that
comprise the SMR protein family have led to the proposal
that they are the evolutionary building blocks of larger αhelical multidrug efflux proteins [29-31]. Although the
sequence similarity between SMR protein members and
other larger multidrug resistance transporters (composed
of 5–10 TM strands) is poor, the structural arrangements
of the TM strands often appear similar. Duplication of
SMR genetic regions that encode for single TM strands or
entire SMR genes have been speculated to give rise to
members within the drug metabolite transport (DMT)
superfamily such as the five TM stranded Bacterial/
Archaeal transporter (BAT) family members and ten TM
stranded transporters such as members of the drug metabolite exporter (DME) [30]. Experimental evidence supporting this evolutionary model is unavailable but
artificially duplicated Eco-EmrE gene cassette fusions
result in a functional protein displaying parallel topology
between the fused subunits [32].

The objective of this work is to explore the evolutionary
origins of the SMR protein family by examining SMR
diversity among Archaeal and Bacterial genomes. The specific goal is to gain insight into the evolutionary constraints exerted upon SMR subclass members to validate
the notion that SMR proteins acted or are acting as the
evolutionary starting points for larger transporters. We
began these studies by surveying SMR sequences within
Archaea and Bacteria from diverse taxonomic backgrounds using current genomic and plasmid sequence
databases (as of March 2008). This effort identified 685
SMR amino acid sequences which were aligned to putatively classify SMR sequences into the three SMR protein
subclasses. The evolutionary relatedness of assigned SMR
protein sequences was refined by using phylogenetic analysis and assisted with SMR homologue classification. The
degree of amino acid conservation and the selective pressures exerted upon selected taxonomic SMR representatives was determined by their rate of synonymous to nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions. Finally, the
genomic loci of SMR homologues were surveyed within
the currently sequenced Archaeal and Bacterial genomes
to explore their functional association to metabolite transport and their affiliation with transposon and integron
mediated inheritance among diverse microorganisms.
The results from this bioinformatics exploration support
the current models that SMR protein sequences act as
genetic building blocks for much larger multidrug efflux
proteins based on their diversity and rapid evolution.

Results and Discussion
SMR proteins have unique subclass distributions within
Archaeal and Bacterial classes
To understand and explore the extent of SMR subclass distribution and diversity, we surveyed the NCBI sequence
database for chromosomally encoded SMR sequences
among Archaea and Bacteria using characterised SMR
homologues from B. subtilis and E. coli as seed sequences.
In total, 685 putative SMR protein sequences were
retrieved from Archaea and Bacteria and a summary of
their subclass distribution is presented in Table 1.

The results from Archaeal genome surveys identified that
SMR sequences are present within Euryarchaeal sub-phylum genomes (Table 1). The lack of SMR homologue
detection in the genomes of available Crenarchaeal subphylum species may reflect insufficient taxonomic diversity or the presence of highly divergent SMR sequences
that prohibited identification. This latter observation is
supported by the identification of only three putative SMR
sequences from Crenarchaeal genome BLAST searches
with e-values at the minimum significance threshold (5 ×
10-3). All three Crenarchaeal SMR sequences (all annotated as putative QAC transporters within the database)
served as outgroups for subsequent phylogenetic analysis
and will not be discussed further.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/140

Overall, SMR homologues we identified from surveyed
Euryarchaeal genomes belonged to SUG, SMP, and the
PSMR (only YvaE) subclasses only (Table 1). All Euryarchaeal SMR homologues were found in two classes,
namely Methanomicrobia and Halobacteria. These surveyed genomes possessed a single SMR homologue,
present as a single isogenic copy but had variable SMR
subclass identity within similar genera in each Archaeal
class. Although SUG and SMP members were commonly
identified from this survey, Euryarchaeal Methanomicrobia were the only organisms to show homology to any
PSMR subclass member, namely to B. subtilis YvaE (BsuYvaE). The presence of Methanomicrobia yvaE homologues could suggest that YvaE potentially represents a
PSMR progenitor. This observation is supported upon
closer examination of their genomic loci, where all of the
Euryarchaeal yvaE homologues lacked the presence of
yvaD a poorly conserved SMR that is commonly located in
the same putative operon among Bacillus species [26].
As expected from the wealth of bacterial genomic
sequences available, SMR diversity among bacterial species far outnumbered Archaea (Table 1). Surveys of the
NCBI bacterial genomic database revealed SMR sequences
were present in 34% of the genera we examined (as of
March 2008). This total is lower than previously reported
estimates (~52% by [9,26]) and will likely vary as more
genomic information is collected. However, this value
emphasizes the extent of SMR proliferation in the Bacterial kingdom. As shown in Table 1, Bacteria have two SMR
homologues per bacterium based on the overall average
but the determination of which SMR subclass member
participates in this average is difficult to identify since
SMR sequences distributed more or less equally within all
three SMR subclasses. Examination of SMR subclass identity by each Bacterial class we surveyed revealed a far more
specific SMR distribution than the overall bacterial SMR
average indicated in Table 1.
The SUG subclass prevailed over all other subclasses in
Bacteria since SUG homologues were found in nearly
every class we examined (Table 1). The presence of SUG
sequences from almost all Euryarchaeal and Bacterial
classes we surveyed indicate that SUG homologues may
represent a potentially ancient SMR sequence. However,
this observation fails to explain the lack of SUG members
from the Bacterial class Chloroflexi or the relatively low
frequency of SUG identification within the genomes of εproteobacteria (6%), Bacilli (13%), and Cyanophyceae
(14%) (Table 1). SUG identification within most bacterial
classes indicates that SUG sequences are maintained
under selective pressures that differ from other SMR
homologues within their hosts.
SMP subclass sequences were identified within the
genomes of particular Bacterial classes namely, CyanobacPage 3 of 27

(Table 1). Unlike SUG, many Bacterial classes either
lacked SMP sequences altogether or encoded for SMP
homologues at a lower frequency (Table 1). Bacterial species in possession of SMP homologues within these
classes were either associated with nosocomial or strict
pathogen causing microorganisms or found in either

aquatic or soil dwelling environments. Hence, SMP maintenance within its host microorganism in these types of
environments likely reflects their frequent exposure to
QAC and other toxic compounds excreted from other biological or anthropogenic sources. Many Bacterial species,
particularly those from Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria,

sequences such as QacE, QacEΔ1, QacG, QacH, QacF, and
QacJ (Table 1). These Qac sequences demonstrated sufficient sequence similarity (QacE 80.9%, QacEΔ1 73.7%,
QacF 80.0%, QacG 80.0%, QacH 81.0%, QacJ 81.0% to

encoded SMP may be highly influenced by their close

association to Qac encoded multidrug resistance plasmids
and integrons (a trend also noted in our phylogenetic
analysis and genomic loci surveys; Figure 1 and Table 2).
However, SMP sequences are not strictly associated with
host plasmid/integron presence in the host organism,
since surveyed Chlorobia and δ-proteobacteria genera
lacked Qac encoding plasmids/integron sequences. Therefore, lateral gene transfer is likely only one of many mechanisms at play in current Bacterial SMP diversity and

supports observations made for other integron associated
genes from the genera Xanthomonas [33] or Vibrio [34-36]
that are chromosomally inherited and maintained within
closely related species.
PSMR subclass members have the most specific sequence
distribution among the sequenced Bacterial genomes we
surveyed strongly suggesting they are maintained under
selective pressures different from either the SUG or SMP
subclasses (Table 1). Particular PSMR pairs themselves are
uniquely distributed within each Bacterial class we examined. For specific examples, refer to ε-proteobacterial YdgE
and YdgF pairs and YkkC and YkkD compared to γ- and δproteobacteria YdgE and YdgF only in Table 1). The PSMR
distribution among Bacilli demonstrated far greater diversity where EbrA/EbrB, YkkC/YkkD, YvdR/YvdS, and YvaE/
YvaD members were identified (Table 1). Hence, PSMR
distribution appears to be highly selective, as observed by
the complete lack of identified YdgE/YdgF homologues
from almost all Gram-positive organisms we surveyed
(except in Deinococci) (Table 1). In contrast, only the
PSMR homologue YvaE was found throughout Gram-positive and Gram-negative genomes we surveyed, albeit at a
lower frequency than other SMR subclass members. The
presence of yvaD in Bacilli and Lactobacilli only suggests
that yvaD may be a rapidly diverging yvaE gene duplication product within Bacilli and Lactobacilli.
Taken together, the unique distribution pattern of SUG,
SMP and PSMR subclass members strongly supports SMR
diversification that is tailored to particular genera.
The phylogenetic history of SMR proteins
To explore the evolutionary relationships of SMR protein
family members further, we analyzed a taxonomically
diverse set of 338 SMR protein sequences. Previous phylogenetic analyses of SMR amino acid sequences using
smaller taxonomic data sets [9,12,26,37] demonstrated
that SUG, SMP and PSMR subclasses grouped separately
from each other. To determine the phylogenetic relatedness of SMR subclass members within various Archaeal
and Bacterial classes to plasmid/integron encoded homologues, we broadened the taxonomic sampling range. If
horizontal gene transfer is the dominant influence on
SMR distribution, we expect a highly discordant phylogenetic distribution closely related to plasmid and integron
Qac sequences rather than a linear inheritance.

Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a division of
SMR members into two major clades (Figure 1; Additional
File 1), namely SUG and SMP, similar to earlier phylogenetic analyses [9,12,26]. Unfortunately, our phylogram
shows that both SUG and SMP clades reside in an unresolved polytomy, a common occurrence in dendrograms
of sequences dispersed via lateral gene transfer mecha-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/140

nisms (for examples refer to [3,38]). This prevents reliable
determination of a common ancestor for either the SUG
or SMP subclasses from this analysis. However, both SUG
and SMP clades demonstrate branching patterns that follow some host driven inheritance, where SMR members
of the same bacterial class group together. However, SUG
and SMP sequences originating from diverse Bacterial
classes were observed suggesting a common lateral transfer of SMR sequence within these taxonomic groups (Figure 1; Additional File 1).
Since the greatest number of SMR homologues we identified are from Actinobacteria, Bacilli, and various Proteobacteria, it is not surprising that the phylogenetic
groupings of SMR homologues within our dendrogram
are strongly dominated by these Bacterial classes (Figure
1; Additional File 1). Previous studies of Class I integron
mobility within all of these genomes indicated that Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria bacterial classes in particular, are highly favourable targets for horizontal gene traffic
and may explain the abundance of SMR homologues
within these particular classes [39,40]. Furthermore, there
is an inherent codon bias within Class 1 integrons (which
typically encode for SMP homologues at the conserved 3'
end) that may have been particularly optimized for these
Bacterial classes [40]. Based on the diversity of Bacterial
genera represented in the branches within both the SUG
and SMP clades, it is likely that a combination of heritable
and horizontal SMR gene transfer events have taken place.
However, SMR dissemination by means of horizontal
gene transfer appears to predominate simply based on the
frequency of unrelated taxa grouping within the branches
of both SUG and SMP clades.
Similar to the observations made from SMR sequence surveys (Table 1), a trend between the environmental origins
of SMR homologues to their host can be observed. SUG or
SMP homologues that grouped together with apparent
mixed taxonomic origins often shared a common environmental niche or lifestyle (aerobic/anaerobic) (Figure
1; Additional File 1). This phylogenetic arrangement supports previous studies that demonstrated class 1 integron
dissemination patterns among evolutionarily unrelated
bacteria are strongly influenced by the selective pressures
imposed by a shared ecological environment [40-42].
Therefore, SUG and SMP inheritance within Archaea and
Bacteria is also influenced by environmental pressures or
organism lifestyle and the impact of each influence
appears to be unique within SUG and SMP clades.
PSMR subclass homologues grouped in distinct branches
to either the SUG or SMP clades (Figure 1; Additional File
1). YvaD homologues were the only exceptions; since they
grouped outside of either SUG or SMP clades close to the
Crenarchaeal SMR outgroup sequences. PSMR members

closely related to SUG members were YkkC/YvdS and
YkkD/YvdR and formed distinct groupings adjacent to
proteobacterial and plasmid/integron encoded SUG
homologues within the SUG clade. This indicates that
YkkC/YvdS and YkkD/YvdR homologues originated from
the SUG subclass since both branches group to a common
node within the SUG clade with high levels of confidence.
Moreover, the close association of YkkC/YvdS and YkkD/
YvdR in separate branches within this PSMR grouping
strongly suggest that YvdS and YvdR homologues are
closely related to YkkC or YkkD. The presence of both
YkkC/YkkD and YvdR/YvdS sequences at separate loci
within the genomes of Bacilli and Lactobacilli indicate
that both PSMR pairs likely derived from separate SUG
gene duplication events. Furthermore, YkkD/YvdR homologues show a close association to plasmid and integron
encoded SUG homologues indicating that these PSMR
homologues may have originated via horizontal gene
transfer and explain their presence in unrelated taxa (Figure 1; Additional File 1). Similar to the SUG clade, PSMR
members EbrA and EbrB, YdgE and YdgF, and YvaE
formed distinct branches within the SMP clade with relatively high levels of confidence (Figure 1; Additional File
1). Like PSMR members related to the SUG clade, PSMR
branches within the SMP clade were composed of taxa
originating from diverse Bacterial classes in addition to
sequences for a particular class (Figure 1; Additional File
1). The polychotomous branching within SMP prohibits
reliable identification of an ancient SMP ancestor from
the tree but does strongly support that SMP sequences
serve as the origin of these particular PSMR sequences
based on higher bootstrap values at their nodes. Therefore, PSMR subclass members with the exception of YvaE
have emerged recently within the clades of both SUG and
SMP likely due to gene duplication events of either a SUG
or SMP homologue within particular Bacterial classes. The
occurrence of PSMR sequences within certain Bacterial
classes may reflect the different selection pressures placed
on either SUG or SMP homologues to rapidly diversify for
a particular environment or host physiology.
Syn-SCAN analysis indicates each SMR subclass member is
maintained under different selective pressure
Since SMR subclass distribution is enriched within particular Bacteria, we wanted to compare the frequency of synonymous to non-synonymous changes occurring within
SMR sequences at the nucleotide level. Examining the
degree of nucleotide changes throughout the whole SMR
sequence relative to the rate of change at each codon can
identify regions of the protein that are actively evolving.
Experimentally examined SMR sequences, specifically
SMR homologues from E. coli and B. subtilis, were selected
for pairwise comparison to their respective putative
homologues from Bacterial and Euryarchaeal class in our
survey. Integron and plasmid encoded SMR homologues

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/140

were included in this analysis to determine the extent of
nucleotide changes within chromosomally encoded SMR
sequences compared to the rate of divergence from their
horizontally transferred counterparts. This comparison
also served as a method to gauge differences that arise
from the codon bias within the various host genomes.
The rate of synonymous to non-synonymous changes
(dS/dN) in nucleotide sequences of SMP subclass homologues selected from various Euryarchaeal and Bacterial
genera resulted in a mean value of 3.6 (Table 3). Since this
value exceeds 1.0, it indicates that SMP homologues are
maintained under selective pressure within the examined
microorganisms. This value is very close to the mean dS/
dN value of the SUG subclass (3.4) and suggesting that
both SMR subclasses are under similar levels of selective
pressures despite their known functional differences
(Table 3). However, mean dS/dN values for members of
the PSMR subclass are much lower (1.8–2.0), indicating
that the selective pressures exerted on these sequences are
less stringent and reflect ongoing sequence divergence
from either SUG and SMP subclasses similar to observations made from our phylogram (Additional file 1;
Figure 1).
Individual dS/dN values from pairwise SMP sequence
comparisons indicated that the rate of synonymous and
non-synonymous changes range from 1–6 among examined chromosomal SMP sequences (Table 3). These values
are often lower than mean dS/dN SMP values due to differences in codon usage between Archaea, Gram-positive,
and Gram-negative organisms. However, the values were
still above 1.0 indicating similar selective pressure acts on
SMP nucleotide sequences even across a broad taxonomic
sampling range. The dS/dN values for chromosomally
encoded SMP sequences increased when compared to
plasmid and integron encoded counterparts (2.3–5.6)
demonstrating their close relationship. Often, dS/dN values could not be determined as indicated by NA in the
table. This was due largely to the proportion of observed
synonymous substitutions (pS) exceeding the Jukes-Cantor cut-off value of 0.74 preventing dS values from being
accurately determined. However, looking at the pS values
among many of the pairwise SMP comparisons it is apparent that many of the SMP sequences are maintained under
high selective pressure similar to other sequences
(Table 3).
SUG homologues are under similar levels of selective
pressures as SMP when comparing their dS/dN values
(Table 3). SUG dS/dN values were high when examining
the Archaeal Halorubrum lacusprofundi sugE (Hla-sugE)
sequence relative to the values of Eco-sugE (Table 3).
Based on these dS/dN values, selective constraints that
maintain SugE homologues like those from Halobacteria

appear to be higher in extremophilic microorganisms perhaps suggesting potential niches of ecological favoring
SUG enrichment. The selective constraint that acts upon
pairwise comparisons of Eco-sugE sequences to plasmid/
integron encoded sugE sequences increased dramatically
with dS/dN values ranging from 2.3–10.4 supporting a
close relationship and origin. Among chromosomally
encoded SUG pairwise comparisons, the highest increase
in dS/dN ratios are observed primarily for the α-proteobacterial and γ-proteobacterial sequences we examined
otherwise, all other pairwise SUG comparisons reflected
the mean SUG dS/dN ratio value. The increase in selective
constraint on the α-proteobacterial and γ-proteobacterial
SUG sequences agree with studies that show a frequent
association of multidrug resistance gene cassettes with
integrons, particularly those among Proteobacteria [4244]. Since SUG sequences are maintained under moderate
to high selective pressures as reflected by their dS/dN values and their predominance over other SMR subclass
members (Table 1), it emphasizes their potentially distinct functional differences.
Members of the PSMR subclass appear to have very different selective constraints placed upon their sequences as

reflected by the variable mean dS/dN values for each
PSMR homologue in comparison to either SMP or SUG
subclasses (Table 3 and Additional file 2). B. subtilis PSMR
subclass sequences were selected as the comparison set for
Syn-SCAN analysis since they represent the most functionally and structurally characterized members of this
subclass to date [21,22,25,26]. Bsu-yvaE had the highest
mean dS/dN value (3.16) compared to other PSMR members, reflecting its frequent diverse distribution in the
genomes of both Archaea and Bacteria. Although the rate
of synonymous to non-synonymous changes among comparisons of Bsu-yvaE to other yvaE homologues are in
many cases indeterminable due to pS values exceeding the
Jukes-Cantor threshold limits, those that could be calculated resulted in high overall dS/dN values (Additional
file 2). Looking at pS and pN values alone, a similar high
dS/dN ratio would be expected among many of the yvaE
homologue comparisons that are listed as NA within
Table 3. As expected from phylogenetic analysis and protein alignments, Bsu-yvaD had the lowest mean dS/dN
ratio (1.63) suggesting that it is maintained under the
least amount of selective pressure among all the PSMR
members we examined.

PSMR homologues ebrA/ebrB have a slightly lower mean
dS/dN value (2.84) than the mean dS/dN values of yvaE,
SMP, and SUG homologues (Table 3 and Additional file
2). Comparisons of Bsu-ebrA and Bsu-ebrB together or
with other chromosomal ebrA/ebrB homologues demonstrated that both sequences are maintained under slightly
lower selective pressures (dS/dN values of 1.0–4.1), but
not when compared to integron encoded Qac homologues (dS/dN values of 4.5–5.6) (Additional file 2). Similar to our phylogram (Figure 1; Additional File 1),
differences could be observed in dS/dN values when comparing ebrA/ebrB homologues identified from Bacilli and
Proteobacterial hosts relative to the Actinobacterial ebrA/
ebrB homologues (Additional file 2) which branched separately in the dendrogram. This finding supports the
observation that Actinobacterial ebrA/ebrB homologues in
particular are under different selective pressures from
other ebrA/B homologues that may be altering these SMP
clade members towards a particular function within
Actinobacterial hosts. EbrA/EbrB homologues NepA and
NepB encoded on the Arthrobacter nicotinovorans pAO1
plasmid confer host resistance to nicotinamide and its
intermediates suggesting that these particular PSMR members may play specific roles in metabolite toxin excretion
[10].
YdgE/YdgF homologues demonstrated a much lower
mean dS/dN value (1.84) suggesting that these homologues are under far less selective pressure than the SMP or
SUG members surveyed (Additional file 2). However,
looking at ydgE and ydgF homologues separately shows a
different reason for their relatively low mean dS/dN value
as a pair. ydgE homologues had higher dS/dN values (0.6–
2.6) than its counterpart ydgF (0.3–0.6) indicating that
only ydgE is actively maintained. This trend is in good
agreement with observations made by three dimensional
cryo-electron microscopic structural studies of Eco-EmrE
protein that support an asymmetrical arrangement of each
protein monomer [45,46]. The lack of stringent selection
on one of the two proteins within the YdgE/YdgF pair may
enhance its functional and structural asymmetry. Experimental characterization of the paired YdgE/YdgF protein
complex in E. coli has revealed its involvement in spermidine excretion and confirmed that only YdgE (MdtI) was
essential for transport activity based on site-directed
mutagenesis experiments of each active site Glu14 residue
in the pair [11]. Furthermore, dS/dN comparisons of ydgF
and ydgE homologues to plasmid and integron encoded
SMR homologues indicated that only ydgE members were
maintained at similarly high levels.
Finally, examination of mean dS/dN values for PSMR
pairs, ykkC/ykkD (1.7) and yvdR/yvdS (2.0), revealed that
each pair is maintained under moderately high selective
pressures in comparison to all other PSMR members

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/140

(Additional file 2). Unlike ydgE/ydgF homologues, pairwise dS/dN comparisons between ykkC/ykkD and yvdR/
yvdS homolog pairs showed relatively high (> 1.0) selective pressures on both pairs. Active maintenance of both
homologues in the pair may reflect functional interdependency. More importantly, only ykkC demonstrated
high dS/dN values when compared to plasmid/integron
encoded SUG homologues suggesting that ykkC has closer
association to horizontally transferred SUG counterparts.
This contrasts our phylogenetic analysis of these
sequences which suggest YkkD has greater evolutionary
relationships to plasmid and integron encoded SUG
homologues (Figure 1, Additional File 1). The closely
related yvdR/yvdS pair does not share dS/dN value differences observed between ykkC and ykkD when comparing
either homologue to plasmid/integron encoded SUG
homologues suggesting that both yvdR and yvdS are maintained under similar levels of selective pressures (Additional file 2). However, both PSMR pairs share far greater
similarity to SUG homologues reinforcing their evolutionary relationship within the SUG clade.
So why is PSMR diversity within particular Bacterial
classes so selective? Thus far, only the EbrA/EbrB homologues, NepA and NepB, from Arthrobacter nicotinovorans
are plasmid encoded [10]. To elaborate, Bacilli lack isogenic SMP or SUG subclass homologues, which would
suggest that there may be as yet unidentified integrons/
plasmids harbouring these SMR homologues. Alternatively, current PSMR homologues may have derived from
existing SUG and SMP subclass members through recent
gene duplication and sequence divergence. The latter
explanation may explain why two PSMR homologues are
found almost exclusively within the chromosomes in contrast to their isogenic integron and plasmid encoded SMR
counterparts. Laterally transferred SMR genes from either
SUG or SMP subclasses should have more selective pressures acting to maintain their isogenically conferred resistance and this trend is reflected in our analyses of both
subclass sequences (Table 3 and Additional file 2). Essentially, those isogenic SMP and SUG sequences that have
incorporated into the genome are no longer subjected to
the same selective pressures and can diverge functionally
and structurally by duplication. Plasmid and integron
encoded homologues must endure selective pressures that
likely force them to be compact in size to thrive on mobile
elements.
SMR subclass members have unique amino acid
conservation patterns highlighting different selective
pressures acting upon loop and TM regions
To investigate how selective pressure affects SMR subclass
differentiation, we examined both SMR protein and
nucleotide alignments in further detail. After generating
an overall amino acid consensus from the protein align-

ment of each SMR subclass member we examined the
extent of amino acid conservation at each position within
loop and TM regions. Mean synonymous nucleotide substitution (Sd) values were also calculated at each codon
position in the SMR nucleotide alignment using SynSCAN analysis to determine the selective pressures exerted
on each residue of the protein. Sd values were determined
from pairwise comparisons of selected members (10–20
species/SMR subclass) and then averaged to generate the
mean Sd at each codon. A summary of both analyses are
shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, where a distinct pattern of resi-

due conservation can be observed for each SMR subclass
member we analyzed.
Both SUG and SMP subclasses demonstrated a unique
amino acid consensus in addition to the core SMR motif
previously reported [9] (Figures 2A and 3A). Additionally,
the amino acid consensus derived for each PSMR subclass
member appears to be unique and generally maintains
the core SMR motif within each predicted loop and TM
strand. PSMR members also displayed residues particular
to either the SMP (pairs YdgE/YdgF; Figures 3B and 3C

Summary at each and PSMR (YdgF and overall amino acidalignments
Summary of SMP and PSMR (YdgF and YdgE) amino acid residue consensus and mean synonymous substitutions (Mean Sd) observed at each position within their overall sequence alignments. Data is shown for SMR members in each panel as follows: A) SMP subclass including integron encoded Qac members, B) PSMR subclass member YdgE, C)
PSMR subclass member YdgF. Figure legend details are identical to those described for Figure 2; refer to this figure for details.

and EbrA/EbrB; Figure 4A) or SUG (YkkC/YvdS; Figure 2B
and YkkD/YvdR; Figure 2C) consensus motifs and in
some cases both, as shown for YvaE (Figure 4B). The predominance of either SMP or SUG consensus motifs for
paired PSMR subclass members in particular provides further support for gene duplication within the SMP or SUG
clade (see Figure 1).
A striking feature within each panel of Figures 2, 3, 4, is
the overall periodicity of amino acid residue conservation
within each TM strand of the protein. Such periodicity was
demonstrated in earlier analysis of SUG and SMP homologues performed by [47]. Examination of the amino acid
consensus maps of SUG and SMP homologues in Figures
2, 3, 4 indicate that each TM strand appears to have the
highest amino acid conservation in a periodic pattern similar to the turn of an α-helix. This periodicity shows that
one face of each predicted TM α-helix (TM 1–4) is more
conserved within all four TM strands. Moreover, this residue periodicity varies at different positions when compar-

ing the SUG consensus map to SMP (Figures 2A and 3A).
Hence, SUG homologues may have different structural
orientations within the TM strands than SMP subclass
members.
Periodic α-helix conservation is also maintained in many
PSMR subclass consensus maps but distinctly varies from
TM strand to TM strand, where the least TM conservation
is observed in the last strand (TM4) (Figures 2, 3, and 4).
Predicted loop/turn regions of most PSMR members, particularly loops 1 and 2, show higher levels of sequence
divergence from SUG and SMP subclasses and generally
much longer loop regions than those predicted for either
SMP or SUG. Furthermore, comparisons of PSMR subclass
pairs together show TM strands with opposing high levels
of amino acid conservation. To clarify, YdgE and YdgF
members have obvious differences in TM strand amino
acid conservation patterns; TM strands 1 and 4 of YdgE
have far fewer conserved residues than TM strands 1 and
4 of YdgF (Figures 3B and 3C). This is also observed in TM

Summary at each position within their overall sequenceacid residue consensus and mean synonymous substitutions (Mean Sd)
Summary of PSMR (EbrA/EbrB, YvaE and YvaD) amino acid residue consensus and mean synonymous substitutions (Mean Sd) observed at each position within their overall sequence alignments. Data is shown for SMR
members in each panel as follows:A) PSMR subclass members, EbrA and EbrB, B) PSMR subclass member YvaE, and C) PSMR
subclass member YvaD. Figure legend details are identical to those described for Figure 2; refer to this figure for details.
strands 1 and 3 of YkkD/YvdR which have more highly
conserved residues than in TM strands 1 and 3 of YkkC/
YvdS (Figures 2B and 2C). These amino acid consensus
differences agree with results obtained from phylogenetic
associations and estimated dS/dN values determined for
these pairs (Figure 1; Additional file 2). Therefore, the
consensus maps of PSMR pairs show that one member of
a given pair or more specifically certain TM strands within
each PSMR pair are maintained under far less selective
pressure.
Amino acid sequence alignments for the PSMR subclass
members EbrA and EbrB were difficult to distinguish from
each other since they both had similar residue conservation patterns, especially when Actinobacterial EbrA and
EbrB homologues were examined. The inability to reliably
separate EbrA/EbrB homologues from each other forced
an initial comparison of these PSMR members altogether.
High amino acid conservation is observed for EbrA/EbrB
homologues within the loop and C-terminus regions of
the protein (Figure 4A). Conservation within these
regions of EbrA/EbrB support site-directed mutagenesis

experiments of Bsu-EbrA and Bsu-EbrB that demonstrate
the importance of the loop and C-terminus regions on
protein function as a pair; their removal in either EbrA or
EbrB resulted in individual variants that could confer isogenic resistance to the host [23]. Closer examination of
Actinobacterial EbrA/EbrB homologue alignments only
showed reduced amino acid consensus values towards the
end of the third TM strand in comparison to the overall
EbrAB amino acid residue analysis (data not shown). This
low overall residue consensus in the C-terminal portion of
TM3 for Actinobacterial EbrA/EbrB homologues only suggests that this TM3 strand could be diverging toward a particular function specific for Actinobacteria only.
Despite having a distinct amino acid consensus motif
from SMP and SUG, YvaE demonstrated a similarly strong
periodic amino acid conservation pattern, particularly
within predicted loop and turn regions. As expected, YvaD
homologues show low overall amino acid conservation
throughout the entire protein with the exception of the
three to four moderately conserved residues at the ends of
the last two TM strands towards the C-terminus. This

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:140

clearly indicates that YvaD has diverged dramatically from
other PSMR members. An important feature of YvaD
homologues to consider is loss of the highly conserved
residue E14 (according to Eco-EmrE); yet conserved residues within the C-terminal residues are only partially
maintained. These infrequently conserved residues are
shared with both YvaE and SMP subclass members
strongly supporting the idea that YvaD likely originated
from YvaE but is maintained under very little selective
pressure within the hosts.
Examination of mean Sd values at each codon position
within all SMR nucleotides demonstrated strong agreement to its corresponding amino acid consensus value
within predicted loop and TM regions (Figures 2, 3, and
4). This result is important since the differences in codon
usage by the various Archaeal and Bacterial hosts may
have reduced the mean Sd values particularly at conserved
amino acid residue positions. One explanation to account
for these high mean Sd values is found when comparing
the close relationship of integron and plasmid encoded
SUG and SMP homologues to chromosomal SMR
sequences. Lateral gene transfer of SMR sequences to evolutionarily unrelated hosts would act as its own codon
bias keeping Sd values high and has been shown in studies of other horizontally transferred sequences (for an
example refer to [38]).
The mean Sd values observed for both SUG and SMP subclass sequences show a similar α-helical periodicity pattern to conserved amino acid residue positions strongly
validating the observation that specific TM α-helix faces
are highly conserved. However, it should be noted that
there are also occasional amino acid positions in each
SMR subclass consensus where codons corresponding to
loop or TM strand regions have high mean Sd values but
very low amino acid consensus value and vice versa. For
example, numerous positions in TM4 of the SUG consensus map have high mean Sd values but low values for its
conserved amino acid at the same position (Figure 2A).
Conversely, what would appear to be a highly conserved
amino acid at particular positions in loop 1 of the YdgF
consensus map show low mean Sd values (≤ 0.6) (Figure
3B). Together, this supports the observation that many
positions and regions among all the SMR subclass members are undergoing different rates of divergence and
reflect regions of the protein that may be actively evolving
or undergoing sequence optimization for particular host.
SMR homologues are linked to metabolite transport and
regulation based on their association with putative
operons
Experiments implicating SMR protein involvement in
toxic metabolite transport suggest broader roles for this
family of proteins during host metabolite regulation.
Although members of the SMR protein family are known

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/140

for conferring multidrug resistance to its host organism,
very little is known about potential 'natural' substrates.
PSMR members Eco-YdgE and Eco-YdgF and A. nicotinovorans plasmid pAO1 encoding NepA and NepB have specifically demonstrated efflux of potentially toxic metabolites
such as spermidine and nicotine intermediates, respectively [10,11]. In addition to these metabolites, SUG
members potentially influence the cellular chaperone
activity, namely the GroES-GroEL complex [13,14,48]
and efflux a limited subset of QAC compounds [14]. To
explore the association of SMR proteins to metabolite trafficking and chaperones, we examined the arrangement of
open reading frames (ORF) at the genomic loci of identified SMR subclass homologues (a total of 283 genomic
loci from completed genomes of Archaea and Bacteria).
Our goal was to explore the degree of association SMR
subclass members had with other ORFs to identify putative substrates for these transporters.
After completing our SMR genomic loci survey, many
trends in SMR genomic arrangement were noted. The first
common characteristic identified from these surveys was
detection of horizontal gene transfer genes that encoded
for integrases, transposons, insertion sequences (IS), plasmid maintenance genes, and bacteriophage replication
and coat proteins downstream or upstream from the SMR
sequence (within our 10 ORF radius cut-off), strengthening our arguments for horizontal SMR inheritance as
shown in the phylogram (Table 2). Mobile genetic elements were found to associate with all SMR homologues
at a frequency of 22% within a 10 ORF radius of surveyed
genomic loci (Table 2) and upon randomly expanding
our genomic loci survey to a 25 ORF radius we saw an
increase in mobile element detection (~34%) (data not
shown).
The second characteristic we observed upon examining
SMR genomic loci was frequency of SMR subclass cooccurrence to various metabolite biosynthetic genes
(Table 2). In general, all the ORFs we could putatively
identify associated with SMR genes from this survey fell
into the following categories; amino acid transport and
biosynthesis, vitamin and cofactor transport and biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, nucleotide biosynthesis,
and multidrug resistance. Other genes identified were
commonly associated with various mobile elements and
were indirectly tied to metabolite transport, namely protein folding (chaperones and post-translational modification), signal transduction/two-component cell regulators,
cell wall biogenesis and degradation, and DNA/RNA replication and regulation. Although many of these associations are likely random and are not expected to have a
direct effect on SMR function, some ORF occurred too frequently with SMR genes to be discounted outright and are
summarized in Table 2.

The last final characteristic observed from the surveys of
genomic loci showed that PSMR homologues had characteristic arrangements in gene pair at the locus. This observation may reflect their potential to act as predecessors of
much larger transporters. To clarify this statement, the
PSMR gene pairs, ydgE/ydgF and ykkC/ykkD, were shown
to frequently overlap (95%–98% surveyed respectively) in
all proteobacterial genomic loci we surveyed. This contrasted the PSMR homologues ebrA/ebrB that did not frequently overlap and were often separated by other ORFs
within their putative operons. In our survey EbrA/EbrB
homologues were also found to correspond to a single
gene only within species from Actinobacteria (32%),
Clostridia (14%), Cyanophyceae (13%), Chloroflexi
(25%) and Planctomycetacia (33%). This observation is
similar to the situation we described for yvaE and yvaD
pairing suggesting that some isogenic ebrA/ebrB homologues may possess functional activity alone or frequently
undergo losses of either pair.
It is important to mention again that these surveys in no
way prove the functional activities of the various SMR subclasses, but identify potential substrates or activities that
could and should be examined experimentally. It also
reaffirms that the distribution of particular SMR subclasses are focusing in on specific Archaeal and Bacterial
groups, in addition to their shared proximity with other
organisms enabling SMR mobile genetic element
exchange.
SMR family proteins demonstrate regions of conservation
with other larger multidrug and metabolite transporters
SMR proteins are one of the 14 families that encompass
the DMT superfamily [30] and include chloramphenicol
resistance proteins of the RarD family and proteins such
as amino acid metabolite efflux pump (EamA) and
PhoPQ-activated protein (PagO) of the drug/metabolite
exporter (DME) family. Since SMR proteins are thought to
act as progenitors of these larger and topologically diverse
multidrug transporter families, an evolutionary model
was proposed to explain how SMR proteins may have contributed to the formation of families including BAT and
DME [30]. Based on this model, topological rearrangements of SMR sequences and/or fusions of a TM forming
domain are suggested to have contributed to the five TM
stranded BAT family which upon fusion with itself led to
the formation of 10 TM stranded DME proteins (SMR ↔
BAT → DME). By extension of this model, other larger TM
stranded proteins such as major facilitator superfamily
(MFS) could be formed by the fusion of 2 BAT sequences
(2 BAT ↔ MFS). Support for the evolutionary model proposed by Jack et al. 2001 was shown from alignments of
SMR TM domains to portions of DME and BAT family
proteins in either the N- or C-terminus region of the protein. According to these alignments SMR proteins shared

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/140

the greatest amount of sequence identity to the C-terminus regions of BAT or DME families [30]. Hence, if SMR
sequences assemble to form larger transporters, we would
expect to identify TM domain regions of protein within
DMT family members with high sequence similarity as
SMR sequences.
To explore potential SMR TM domain remnants within
BAT and DMT superfamily members we created artificial
fusions of SMR subclass pairs together (using E. coli and B.
subtilis homologues) in both heterogeneous (e.g. EcoEmrE to Eco-SugE) and homogenous (Eco-EmrE to EcoEmrE) protein combinations to serve as seed sequences
for phi-BLAST analyses of genomic databases. These
searches identified numerous TM domain regions within
SMR fusions that had similarity to various DMT superfamily members in addition to members of MFS (Figures
5 and 6). Sequence similarity within aligned TM domains
of SMR protein with Archaeal and Bacterial BAT homologues were higher than expected (≤ 25%) based on previous examination [30]. Regions with the least TM domain
alignability between SMR and BAT proteins were observed
for the predicted TM2 strand of all BAT sequences examined (Figure 5A). SUG protein sequence alignments to
BAT proteins showed SUG TM1 and N-terminal TM2
strand splitting within the alignment of BAT TM strands
1–3. As observed by Jack et al. 2001 [30], the highest proportion of amino acid residue conservation was found
within the C-terminus alignments of BAT and SMR. Based
on C-terminal TM domain conservation, the model by
Jack et al. 2001 suggested that the evolutionary gain of
another TM domain was likely to occur at either end of the
SMR sequence [30]. Our results support this (SMR →
BAT) model and suggest that SMR TM domain splitting or
TM domain duplication gain within the SMR N-terminal
region specifically resulted in BAT family formation. To
determine if the SMR N-terminal TM domain region is
poorly aligned to larger multidrug efflux protein alignments were preformed using homo- or hetero fusion SMR
proteins. In general, almost all SMR fusions we examined
demonstrated a similar TM domain alignment pattern to
10 TM strand DME members (in this case RarD and PagO
shown in Figure 5B) and to 12 TM stranded MFS members
(Figure 6). However, we also noticed that the order of the
hetero-SMR protein fusions resulted in higher alignment
scores to DMT TM strand alignment. For example, E. coli
YdgF-YdgE (18%) but not E. coli YdgE-YdgF (10%) alignment to DMT superfamily member RarD (Figure 5B)
resulted in higher sequence similarity values (data not
shown). As observed for SMR-BAT alignments (Figure
5A), the SMR fusion 'N-terminus regions' (TM1–2 and
TM5–6) showed the poorest TM domain alignments to Nterminus and central regions of DMT (TM1–2 and TM5–
6) and MFS (TM1–3 and TM6–8) sequences. It is important to note that the lack of TM domain alignability within

SMR TM domains 1–2 may simply be due to the higher
levels of polar and aromatic residue conservation within
these regions in comparison to TM strands 3–4 (more
hydrophobic residues) (Figures 2, 3, and 4), making C-terminal alignments in SMR TM domains 3–4 more favourable to larger TM domain transporters based on
hydrophobicity alone.

DMT protein families. SMR TM domains conversion is
based on TM alignments to larger drug transporters shown
in Figure 5. TM strands from a putative SMR protein are
shown as filled rectangles and numbered according to their
position within the protein. Unnumbered vertically lined rectangles indicate TM strands gained within BAT and DME proteins. N- and C-termini are no longer shown in the figure to
account for topological orientations changes that may contribute to this process. An alternative SMR/PSMR protein
fusion model is also shown based on SMR fusion alignments
which may also contribute to a 10 TM stranded DMT protein. For this model, fusion of two PSMR sequences and the
subsequent gain of TM domains show the formation of 10
TM domain DMT transporters.

In light of the SMR TM domain alignments to larger multidrug transporters, we propose an extension of the SMR
multidrug origin model (Figure 7). This updated model
highlights TM domains in the N- (TM 1–2) and C-termini
(TM 3–4) in SMR protein and its fusions that were identified within transporters of DMT and MFS. The observations noted from the SMR-BAT/DMT/MFS alignments
(Figures 5 and 6) provide further support for the evolutionary models proposed by Jack et al. 2001 and Rapp et
al. 2007 [30,49]. It is important to note that additional
transporters such as sodium/proline symporters (proline
permease PutP of the sodium solute sugar transporter
family) and other amino acid exporter proteins (such as
YeeA) from Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative hosts outside of the DMT superfamily were also identified from our
phi-BLAST searches and shown to similarly align according to TM domain (data not shown). This extends the
scope of the current evolutionary model and also supports
our bioinformatics genomic loci surveys that link SMR
protein involvement to amine metabolism (Table 2). We
predict that SMR gene duplications of either SMP or SUG
subclasses gave rise to not only the PSMR subclass members but PSMR proteins themselves may have contributed
to DMT superfamily diversity. The TM domain alignments
of artificial PSMR fusions to similar TM regions within
MFS and DME family members support this prediction.
The ability of SMR proteins to adopt dual-topologies
within the plasma membrane as determined experimentally [28,49,50] would also make the SMR family an ideal
candidate as a molecular building block for larger TM
domain multidrug transporters. Unfortunately, the low
degree of sequence identity (ranging from 10 – 30%)
within the SMR to BAT, DMT or MFS alignments (Figures
5 and 6) and the relatively poor overall sequence conservation of R and K amino acid residues (topological determinants of the 'positive inside' rule as discussed in
[51,52]) observed from our alignment analysis in Figures
2, 3, and 4 make it difficult to draw reliable conclusions
that address the controversy surrounding SMR topology
and subunit arrangements [53]. Evidence for and against
SMR dual-topology can be equally taken from this work,
making it insufficient to resolve specific SMR topology. To
highlight this point, the functional asymmetry of YdgE
and YdgF, discussed in sections above, strongly supports a
dual-topology of PSMR proteins, but our SMR fusion
alignments (Figures 5 and 6) and dS/dN results (Table 3

Page 23 of 27

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:140

and Additional file 2) make topological orientation conclusions for both SMP and SUG subclasses uncertain due
to the low overall degree of amino acid residue conservation in loop and turns. It should also be noted that our
findings could easily be re-interpreted as MFS/DMT/BAT
→ SMR evolution, since degeneration and partial
sequence losses within DMT superfamily members, such
as PagO or RarD, via horizontal gene movement could
have also resulted in a functional truncation leading to the
current SMR family. What is clear from this study is that
SMR family members are justifiably placed within the
DMT superfamily and potentially share functional and
structural characteristics with other DMT family members
making SMR proteins essential for future experimental
studies.

Conclusion
In summary, SMR homologues grouped into two major
clades based on our phylogram: SUG and SMP (Figure 1;
Additional File 1). We have also suggested that gene
duplication events within each clade likely resulted in the
emergence of PSMR members among particular bacterial
classes. Based on our analyses of both amino acid and
nucleotide conservation among SMR homologues there is
convincing evidence to support that chromosomally
encoded SUG, SMP and PSMR have diverged in both
sequence and function from their integron encoded counterparts. The high frequency of lateral gene transfer and
rapid sequence divergence within the identified SMR
homologues in Archaeal and Bacterial genomes precluded
the reliable identification of a single common SMR progenitor. Similar to other associated multidrug resistance
integron encoded genes such as sulphonamide resistance
sull [54] or chloramphenicol resistance cmlA [5,55], SMR
family origins will be difficult to determine due to the
multitude of pressures exerted on the gain and loss of
these sequences as they move from integrons, super-integrons, plasmids, megaplasmids, and chromosomes. However, the inherent plasticity of these SMR homologues
based on their unique distribution within various microorganisms, small size, and structural similarity to other
larger drug and metabolite transporters make them one of
the most likely progenitors of α-helical drug/metabolite
transporters.
Despite the apparent rapid emergence of drug resistance,
numerous multidrug resistance mechanisms have been
shown to predate anthropogenic antibiotic usage,
strongly suggesting that SMR genes have existed long
before human antibiotic and antiseptic introduction [56].
Bacterial adaptation to antimicrobial compounds secreted
by plants (for example QAC osmoprotectants such as
betaines) and fungi (for example antibiotic β-lactam
derivatives) are some of the many toxins that have likely
contributed to the development of current SMR similar to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/140

other resistance mechanisms (as reviewed by [57]). Taking this into account, the variation in SMR subclass distribution may make sense by simply examining the
environment of the Bacteria and Archaea who harbour
them. Controlling QAC and lipophilic compound concentrations by the host microorganism living in soil environments, areas enriched with industrial pollution, in
hypersaline environments, or both opportunistic and
strict pathogens is advantageous and would explain why
SMR distribution via lateral gene transfer is an 'economic
tool' due to its broad resistance to toxins for its size.

Methods
SMR protein dataset selection and SMR subclass
designation
SMR sequences used for this study were obtained from
NCBI genomic blast surveys (tBLASTn and BLASTp) using
SMR sequences functionally characterized for transport
activity [11,14,22,26,58]. Chromosomally encoded SMR
homologues were identified in a total of 340 Archaeal and
Bacterial species using query SMR sequences from Bacillus
subtilis (Bsu-EbrA NP_389612 and Bsu-EbrB NP_389611;
Bsu-YkkC NP_389192 and Bsu-YkkD NP_389193; BsuYvdR NP_391330 and Bsu-YvdS NP_391329; Bsu-YvaE
NP_391237 and Bsu-YvaD NP_391236) and Escherichia
coli (Eco-EmrE NP_415075; Eco-SugE NP_418572; EcoYdgE/MdtI NP_416116 and Eco-YdgF/MdtJ NP_416117)
[59]. As a result, a total of 685 non-identical SMR
sequences (as of March 2008) were identified from the
query SMR sequence blasts with e-values of ≤ 1 × 10-4 and
served as the cut-off value for positive SMR identification.
The 685 putative SMR protein sequences were aligned
using ClustalW [60,61] and TCoffee [62] (data not
shown). This aligned data included smaller SMR protein
datasets used in previous analyses [9,12,26,37,63]. The
685 protein ClustalW alignment was refined manually
using the editing program GeneDoc (v 2.5.010 [64]). SMR
subclass designations for all of the 685 SMR protein
sequences were assigned based on their sequence similarity to the SMR protein seed sequences within the protein
sequence alignment, and their evolutionary relationship
to SMR subclass members using phylogenetic analysis by
the Neighbour-Joining (NJ) program available from ClustalW [61]. The results of this SMR distribution survey are
summarized in Table 1. An amino acid residue consensus
was also determined for each SMR subclass from our
alignment and the results are presented as percent occurrence in Figure 5.

SMR proteins alignments to BAT, DMT and MFS transporters were performed using ClustalW and manual alignment using the editing program GeneDoc (v 2.5.010
[64]). BAT, DMT and MFS sequences were selected based
on their identity to the original SMR seed sequences
through phi-BLAST searches available through NCBI.

Transporter domains with ≤ 30% TM domain sequence
similarity to the SMR TM domains. Artificial SMR fusions
using homogenous (for example Eco-EmrE to Eco-EmrE)
or heterogeneous (Eco-EmrE to Eco-SugE) sequences
aligned to all the identified transporters from phi-BLAST
(NCBI) searches. In some cases, TM domains for BAT,
DMT and MFS proteins required TM domain prediction
and were performed using online prediction algorithms
TMpred [65], and transmembrane hidden Markov Model
(TMMOD) [66].
Synonymous/non-synonymous nucleotide substitution
analysis of SMR sequences
SMR nucleotide sequences used for Syn-SCAN analysis
[67] were selected from each SMR subclass protein dataset
to represent the taxonomic variation from Archaea and
Bacteria and represented those members with the most
SMR subclass diversity. Selected nucleotide sequences
were aligned manually using GeneDoc (v 2.5.010 [64]) by
their codon using the 685 SMR protein alignment as a reference. Syn-SCAN analyses were performed on a minimum of 20 aligned SMR nucleotide sequences from each
SMR subclass and additional sequence comparisons were
made to plasmid/integron SMR homologues. Full length
SMR nucleotide sequences were aligned according to EcoemrE codon 3 (W3) to codon 107 (L107). The distribution
of point mutations from SMR sequences was examined
spanning a 300 bp region which included nucleotides that
encoded each of the four predicted transmembrane
strands as well as loop/turn regions and truncated poorly
conserved codons from the encoded N- and C-termini.
For yvdR/yvdS and ebrA/ebrB sequences, poor alignment of
three codons within the region encoding the first putative
loop1 had to be removed. The rate of synonymous to nonsynonymous changes (dS/dN) was determined using the
online Syn-SCAN program website [67-69] and the values
of SMR sequence pairs representing each of the three SMR
subclasses are shown in Table 3 and Additional file 2.
Large values of dS/dN (> 1.0) imply that the encoded protein is selectively constrained and indicates that selective
pressures are occurring within the sequences that minimize the number of amino acid changes, thus retaining
the function and/or structure of the protein. Average dS/
dN values were also calculated for all nucleotide
sequences within each SMR subclass and summarized in
Table 3 and Additional file 2. The observed number of
synonymous nucleotide substitutions (Sd) at each codon
within each SMR subclass alignment was also calculated
and the mean Sd values are summarized in Figures 2, 3,
and 4.
SMR protein phylogenetic tree generation
To examine the evolutionary relatedness of the all SMR
subclass members assigned from the original 685 SMR
protein alignment, a smaller alignment of 338 SMR protein sequences was prepared to adequately represent the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/140

taxonomic diversity of sequence origin (Additional File
1). Phylogenetic trees based on Neighbour-Joining (NJ)
were generated for the smaller SMR protein sequence data
set (n = 338) using the program PROTDIST [Jones-Thornton-Taylor setting and NEIGHBOR (NJ setting)]; these
programs are part of the program package PHYLIP (Version 3.63, [70,71]). Bootstrap replicates (1000) were generated using SEQBOOT (PHYLIP) and evaluated with NJ
analysis in combination with the CONSENSE program
(PHYLIP) for obtaining a majority rule consensus tree. All
dendrograms presented were drawn with the TreeView
program (Version 1.6.6, PHYLIP) using the PHYLIP tree
out files and annotated manually. Among the Archaeal
genomes explored, only three Crenarchaeal sequences
were identified with e-values of ~5 × 10-3 and each
sequence produced highly similar tree arrangements and
bootstrap values (data not shown). Therefore, Archaeoglobus fulgidus QacE sequence was selected arbitrarily as the
outgroup for the final tree. The results of these analyses
are presented in Figure 1 and Additional File 1.
SMR genomic loci surveys
The genomic loci of SMR subclass members were examined from sequenced host microorganisms using NCBI
online Entrez Genome Sequence Viewer http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Genes peripheral to the SMR gene
were surveyed using a 10 gene radius. Putative operons
were deduced from the genomic sequence within the 10
gene radius using the online promoter scanning programs
PromScan http://molbiol-tools.ca/promscan/ and Virtual
Footprint
http://www.prodoric.de/vfp/
vfp_promoter.php. The frequency of SMR occurrence in
various putative metabolite operons were reported in
Table 2 as the percentage of total loci surveyed. The frequency these metabolite genes occur within the gene
radius surveyed was also reported in Table 2, by the percentage of total loci surveyed for each SMR subclass.
