Abstract
Background: The past decade has seen a remarkable increase in the number of recognized mouse
lemur species (genus Microcebus). As recently as 1994, only two species of mouse lemur were
recognized according to the rules of zoological nomenclature. That number has now climbed to as
many as fifteen proposed species. Indeed, increases in recognized species diversity have also
characterized other nocturnal primates – galagos, sportive lemurs, and tarsiers. Presumably, the
movement relates more to a previous lack of information than it does to any recent proclivity for
taxonomic splitting. Due to their nocturnal habits, one can hypothesize that mouse lemurs will
show only minimal variation in pelage coloration as such variation should be inconsequential for the
purposes of mate and/or species recognition. Even so, current species descriptions for nocturnal
strepsirrhines place a good deal of emphasis on relatively fine distinctions in pelage coloration.
Results: Here, we report results from a multi-year study of mouse lemur populations from Beza
Mahafaly in southern Madagascar. On the basis of morphological and pelage variation, we initially
hypothesized the presence of up to three species of mouse lemurs occurring sympatrically at this
locality, one of which appeared to be undescribed. Genetic analysis reveals definitively, however,
that all three color morphs belong to a single recognized species, Microcebus griseorufus. Indeed, in
some cases, the three color morphs can be characterized by identical mitochondrial haplotypes.
Conclusion: Given these results, we conclude that investigators should always proceed with
caution when using a single data source to identify novel species. A synthetic approach that
combines morphological, genetic, geographic, and ecological data is most likely to reveal the true
nature of species diversity.

Background
A remarkable amount of primate diversity remains undocumented due to cryptic variation among species. To accurately and thoroughly document this diversity, genetic

and/or behavioral investigations, in addition to morphological analyses, are necessary. The phenomenon of cryptic diversity is being actively explored, particularly for
nocturnal primates [1-11]. Mouse lemurs (genus MicrocePage 1 of 11

bus) can potentially be said to represent a cryptic species
radiation. They are the world's smallest living primates,
with brown pelage and average adult body size ranging
from 30 to 72 grams [12]. Given that they are strictly nocturnal, theory [13-15] would predict that mouse lemurs
will emphasize olfactory and auditory communication
signals over visual signals, as has been demonstrated for
other nocturnal primates [1,2], [5,6], [16-18]. An array of
studies conducted on mouse lemurs within the past several years appears to confirm this prediction. For example,
exposure to female urine can significantly increase testosterone levels in males, just as exposure to the urine of
dominant males can suppress testosterone production in
other males [19]. Similarly, acoustic studies have revealed
remarkable subtleties in signaling, with two noteworthy
results that have direct implications for potential speciation mechanisms. Acoustic signals in mouse lemurs
appear to evolve extremely rapidly, with the greatest levels
of acoustic separation occurring in the sexual advertisement calls of males [11,20,21]. Thus, it is not surprising
that morphological features might be only subtly variable
in mouse lemurs, making them difficult to distinguish
with human eyes. As with other cryptic species radiations,
empirical recognition of species boundaries will depend
on the reciprocal illumination obtained from a comparison of genetic and morphological data. The results of
these analyses will then form working hypotheses of species limits, which can then be further tested in the field
(e.g., testing for areas of non-interbreeding sympatry and/
or variations in olfactory and/or acoustic signaling).
In 1972, Martin [22] recognized only two species of
mouse lemur (up from one): Microcebus murinus, a smalleared, gray form, and M. rufus, a large-eared, reddishbrown form. This taxonomy was standard until the last
decade of the twentieth century (see, for example, [23]).
In the mid-1990s beginning with the work of Schmid and
Kappeler, two additional species were added to the roster
on the basis of variation in morphometric and coat color
characteristics [24,25]. Then, in a geographically-broad
morphological study that considered cranial, dental, and
postcranial traits, Rasoloarison et al. [12] differentiated
seven species of mouse lemurs from western Madagascar
alone. These species were also described as identifiable by
subtle differences in pelage coloration as well as dental
and other morphological characteristics. Rasoloarison et
al. [12] suggested that, by lumping "red" and "gray" forms
into only two species, earlier researchers had underestimated the species diversity within the genus.
Molecular phylogenetic methods provide an alternative,
powerful tool for examining the relationships and potential species boundaries of mouse lemurs [9,10], [26,27].
These methods identify species as genetic clades that may
be comprised of individuals even from disparate geo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/98

graphic locations. This approach also provides the additional benefit of potentially identifying specimens of
unknown origins, or of elucidating species identity by
examining specimen positions on phylogenetic trees. This
strategy was previously used to classify mouse lemur specimens collected in the Berenty Private Reserve (in southeastern Madagascar) from two forest types [10]. The
resulting phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the study
specimens grouped into two mouse lemur species clades,
identifying a single individual as M. murinus and multiple
individuals as M. griseorufus. Thus, two species of mouse
lemur were identified as inhabiting the region of the Berenty Private Reserve. These two species exhibited microhabitat separation at Berenty: individuals identified as M.
griseorufus were captured in the spiny forest, while the single individual captured in the gallery forest was determined to be M. murinus. As such, microhabitat separation
of the two species at Berenty seemed evident, and concordant with the observation that M. murinus inhabits a
lusher forest bordering a river at Kirindy, while M. griseorufus was known from drier forests at Beza Mahafaly.
We used a similar approach to classify wild-caught mouse
lemur individuals from Beza Mahafaly, a Special Reserve
in southwestern Madagascar composed of two disparately
sized, noncontiguous parcels separated by several kilometers. We captured mouse lemurs at three locations (all
within a radius of about 7 km), including the dry forest at
Ihazoara, but also two locations within the Reserve proper
– a gallery forest (Parcel 1) bordering the Sakamena River,
and a spiny forest (Parcel 2) dominated by succulent vegetation, located further from the Sakamena River [28]
(Figure 1). The dry forest at Ihazoara is intermediate in
vegetation characteristics between that of the spiny and
gallery forests, but more similar to the spiny forest.
Previous researchers had inferred the presence of M. murinus at Beza Mahafaly [23,29,30], but no one had actually
studied them in this region until Goodman [31,32] collected osteological specimens from owl pellets outside the
reserve, and found them to contain large numbers of jaws
and postcranial bones of mouse lemurs. Rasoloarison et
al. [12] identified all but one of the jaws as belonging to
M. griseorufus; the outlier appeared to be M. murinus. Additionally, six mouse lemurs captured by Rasoloarison at
Ihazoara were all identified as M. griseorufus [12].
Rasoazanabary [28] began a long-term program of intensive monitoring of mouse lemurs at Beza Mahafaly in
2003, and individuals captured and released in 2003 for
this behavioral study are the subjects of the molecular
phylogenetic analysis presented herein. Most interesting
was her discovery in 2003 of individuals of differing
pelage coloration. The majority of captured individuals
shared the "typical" M. griseorufus pattern, consisting of a

red-brown tail, shades of gray and brown on the back, a
red-brown stripe of varying intensity along the dorsal
midline, white underside, white stripe between the eyes,
and reddish-brown markings above the eyes, converging
in an apex (the "reversed V") on an otherwise gray cap.
However, six individuals, all captured in the spiny forest,
resembled more strongly the pattern typical of M. murinus
in the region of Kirindy (red-brown tail, gray back lacking
a dorsal midline stripe, cream underside, and no facial
markings or reverse V on the cap). Moreover, two individuals (one in the gallery forest and one in the spiny forest)
had a unique appearance (red-brown tail, red-brown back
lacking a dorsal midline stripe, cream underside, redbrown face and cap but with a creamy white stripe
between the eyes) (see Figure 2).
Rasoazanabary conducted additional captures and focal
individual follows of mouse lemurs in the three forest
habitats at Beza Mahafaly during the years 2004 and 2005
(for a cumulative total, with 2003, of 14 months). About
17% (i.e., 15) of the individuals captured in 2003 were
recaptured in 2004, 2005, or both. In all, 196 individuals
were captured and marked during the 14-month sampling
period. Of these, 13 (about 7%) showed murinus-like coloration, 165 (about 84%) showed typical griseorufus coloration, and 18 (about 9%) showed the "all-red"
coloration.
The objective of the present study is to use molecular phylogenetic analysis to determine the placement of individuals of different pelage coloration within the larger mouse
lemur phylogeny, and thus to investigate species identity
using genetic evidence. Our a priori hypothesis was that
individuals that displayed a Microcebus murinus-like coat

coloration would fall into the M. murinus clade and M. griseorufus-like individuals into the M. griseorufus clade. We
also hypothesized that the "all-red" individuals would
form a novel clade in the Microcebus tree. In addition to
examining the broader phylogenetic relationships, we
employed molecular techniques to examine the relationships among individuals at the three forests, and thus to
test whether geography has played a significant role in the
generation of intraspecific variation. The genetic and morphological data were tested for structure with respect to
three sampling locations in the Beza Mahafaly region. As
the three sites are ecologically and geographically distinct
(two located within the reserve and one outside, and on
the opposite side of the Sakamena River), we aimed to
determine whether the river and fields separating them, or
the different microhabitats they represent, are potential
barriers to gene flow.

Results
We examined the relationships of seventy specimens from
Beza Mahafaly, in addition to six samples of M. griseorufus
previously obtained from Ihazoara and eleven samples of
M. griseorufus from the Berenty Reserve. From the 70 cytochrome b sequences produced in this study, 44 haplotypes were found. Included in the analysis were DNA
sequence data of the 70 individuals sampled from Beza
Mahafaly, in addition to thirty-eight published sequences
of Microcebus, representing seven recognized species
(Table 1) and two species of dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus
major and Cheirogaleus medius) from the same taxonomic
family, Cheirogaleidae.
Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all Beza Mahafaly
individuals collected for this study were clearly nested
within a Microcebus griseorufus clade, composed of individuals from both the Beza Mahafaly and Berenty regions,
regardless of coat color or sampling location within Beza
Mahafaly (Figure 3). In addition, individuals that displayed murinus-like or unique pelage patterns shared a
haplotype with individuals bearing the more common
griseorufus form. The specimens from Berenty formed a
distinct clade nested within the greater M. griseorufus
clade.
We examined the M. griseorufus sequences for geographic
structuring of haplotypes from the two collection sites,
Beza Mahafaly and Berenty. The AMOVA revealed strong
genetic structure separating individuals from Beza Mahafaly from individuals from Berenty (φst = 0.3552).
MIGRATE analyses consistently yielded the highest population size in Parcel 2 within the reserve, the spiny habitat
(0.024); while Parcel 1, the gallery forest, had the smallest
(0.0006; Ihazoara: 0.004). This result is consistent with
the density patterns observed in the field. Migration rate
analyses revealed that most M. griseorufus movement was

The haplotype network (Figure 4) visually demonstrates
the distribution of the atypical M. griseorufus morphotypes. These morphotypes share common cytochrome b
haplotypes with individuals of typical coat coloration.
Also, there are common haplotypes that are shared
between multiple sampling sites. However, haplotypes
that show greater divergence from the common haplotypes, five or more missing haplotypes connecting two
haplotypes, are more often from the spiny forest (5 occurrences) or from Ihazoara (2 occurrences), compared to the
gallery forest (no occurrences).
Chi-square tests of the differences in distributions of
pelage types across the three forests fail to reveal significant differences (Table 2, 3, 4); instead, the distributions
are remarkably similar in all three. However, discriminant
function analysis shows significant morphometric differences between populations in the three forests. Only the
first canonical function (with a Wilks' Lambda of .73 and
a chi-square of 30.22, df = 12) is statistically significant (p
= .003). This function accounts for 83.3% of the variance,
and separates individuals from the gallery forest (with
positive scores) from those in the spiny forest (with negative scores). There is considerable overlap of scores of
individuals from each forest type, with individuals from
Ihazoara intermediate and most likely to be classified as
coming from one of the other sites. The post hoc classification success for all individuals is 55.3%, with 69.8% of
individuals from the spiny forest, 50% of individuals
from the gallery forest, and only 40% of individuals from
Ihazoara correctly classified. The structure matrix, when
considered in conjunction with the centroid scores of
individuals from each of the three forests (Table 5),
reveals that individuals from the spiny forest tend to have
shorter skulls, ears, and bodies than individuals at either
of the two other sites, but especially the gallery forest.
Essentially, individuals from the spiny forest are smaller
in body size than those from other forests. ANOVA confirms that these differences are statistically significant
(Table 6), even at a univariate level. The three additional
variables (tail length, bizygomatic breadth, and canine
height) are poorly correlated with scores on this axis, and
two (bizygomatic breadth and canine height) do not vary
significantly by site.

Discussion
The results of molecular phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome b mtDNA sequences fail to support our initial
hypothesis that mouse lemurs collected at Beza Mahafaly
with murinus-like or unique pelage characteristics are
either M. murinus or a novel species. All individuals form

griseorufus. Therefore, we believe that all seventy individuals sequenced should be classified as M. griseorufus. M. griseorufus has significantly diverged from its sister species,
M. murinus, with both species forming distinct clades with
significant posterior probability (>95%). The mouse
lemurs with divergent coat characteristics were included
in the M. griseorufus clade, as they shared identical mtDNA
haplotypes with individuals displaying the more typical
M. griseorufus morphotype. The complex color patterns
are independent of habitat type as confirmed by chisquare tests (Table 2, 3, 4); they are also uncorrelated with
genetic distance, as suggested by the distribution of haplotypes in the network (Figure 4).

It is instructive to consider the relative importance of visual, auditory, and olfactory signals in M. griseorufus social
communication, and how variation in pelage coloration
is likely to be perceived. Like other mouse lemurs, Microcebus griseorufus are nocturnal, solitary foragers with a dispersed social system. Encounters among individuals at
Beza Mahafaly are common (indeed, while foraging, two
mouse lemurs may occupy a single tree), but rarely are
individuals in physical contact while active. As in other
mouse lemurs, audition and olfaction are critical to social
signaling. For example, Microcebus murinus has been
shown in captivity to display group-specific vocalization
patterns [21], as have male M. murinus in neighboring
demes during the breeding season [20]. In addition, wild
M. ravelobensis were shown to regulate inter- and intragroup spatial distributions using olfactory and acoustic
signals [35]. In this species, individuals use different
acoustic signals when sleeping groups disperse at sunset as
opposed to when they gather at sunrise. These acoustic
calls were found to be specific to each social group [35].
Zimmermann et al. [11] have shown that M. murinus can
be distinguished from M. rufus using vocal fingerprinting.
Olfactory and auditory cues have not been studied in
detail in M. griseorufus. Nevertheless, Rasoazanabary has
observed the use of trill vocalizations to attract mates, and
vocalizations can be heard during or just prior to agonistic
encounters. Urine washing is common, and individuals
have strong odors that are detectable even by human
observers. Olfaction and audition are almost certain to be
more important than vision in social encounters.

This is not to imply that vision is unimportant to mouse
lemurs. Reproduction is photoperiod controlled, as is seasonal torpor [36-38]. Indeed, photoperiod appears to
have an effect on life span in mouse lemurs [39]. On a
daily basis, light intensity helps to regulate activity levels
[40]; mouse lemurs do not emerge from their nests to forage until light levels are sufficiently low. Facial patterns
(light and dark areas) may contribute to species or individual recognition [41]. As in almost all other strepsirrhines, mouse lemurs possess a tapetum lucidum to
increase their sensitivity to low light intensity.
However, vision in mouse lemurs is dominated by rods
(photoreceptor cells with high sensitivity to very low levels of illumination, and with a pigment showing maximum sensitivity to light in the green part of the spectrum)
and is thus largely scotopic. This contrasts with primates
that have photopic vision (dominated by cones, which are
sensitive to varying light wavelengths, depending on pigment type). Cones are not active at low light levels, and
rods have a restricted range of wavelength sensitivity, so
vision may be expected to be achromatic for all strictlynocturnal primates [42]. Furthermore, the density ratio of
cones to rods is likely to be low in M. griseorufus. DkhissiBenyahya et al. [43] report a peak rod density of 850,000
rods/mm2 and a peak cone density of 7,500 to 8,000
cones/mm2 in M. murinus. Less than 0.2% of the cone
population is represented by short wavelength-sensitive
(SWS), as opposed to medium to long wavelength-sensitive, cells. Whereas M. murinus do possess a variety of cone
types, their density ratio of cones to rods is very low, and
SWS cones are irregularly distributed [43]. The irregular
distribution and very low number of SWS cones preclude
an important role for color vision, even at dusk or dawn
[44]. In summary, the pelage color variation that is perceptible to humans is likely to be invisible to mouse
lemurs.
Our genetic results demonstrate that coat coloration is not
diagnostic of species differentiation at Beza Mahafaly.
Indeed, pelage color variation may be problematic as an

indicator of species boundaries for nocturnal primates in
general. Why so much intraspecific variation in mouse
lemur pelage coloration exists at Beza Mahafaly is
unknown. In order to further investigate this phenomenon, we need more systematic data on the degree of coat
color variation in populations of mouse lemurs in different geographic regions. We note that at Beza Mahafaly the
three pelage types described here are not always discrete.
Some individuals show combinations that can be considered intermediate between these types (e.g., gray dorsal
fur with no brown fringe or highlights, but with a somewhat distinct dorsal stripe and reversed V).
With the molecular analysis, we determined that there is
reciprocal gene flow among the three sampling sites
within Beza Mahafaly. The lack of genetic structure and
prevalence of dispersal between the parcels in the reserve
and Ihazoara is noteworthy given our sampling of individuals on both sides of the Sakamena River, and in habitats separated today by other apparent barriers, such as
cleared fields. Multiple studies have recently implicated
rivers as important barriers to gene flow in lemur species
[27,45,46]. Pastorini and colleagues [46] have determined that the Tsiribihina and Betsiboka Rivers in western and northwestern Madagascar, respectively, greatly
hinder gene flow among species in the lemur genera Eulemur, Propithecus, Lepilemur, and possibly Microcebus. It is
evident that the Sakamena River fails to do the same for
mouse lemurs at Beza Mahafaly. However, the Betsiboka
and Tsiribihina Rivers are far more formidable year-round
than is the Sakamena and the even-smaller Ihazoara River.
The Sakamena River is a tributary to the Onilahy River (to
the north, more comparable to the Betsiboka or the Tsiribihina Rivers in size), and the Ihazoara is a much narrower tributary feeding into the Sakamena. The Sakamena
and Ihazoara Rivers are dry for eight months every year,
and the water is shallow even during the wettest months.
Floating vegetation (following a cyclone) may occasionally provide pathways for mouse lemurs, allowing them to
cross these narrow rivers, as anecdotal evidence suggests.
Moreover, the distribution of forests in the region of Beza
Mahafaly prior to the arrival of humans in the region over
2000 years ago [46] is not known. Our genetic data confirm that dispersal is occurring despite the separation of

forests by potentially inhospitable space, and regardless of
dispersal mechanism. This information is important if we
are to construct and test hypotheses regarding dispersal
mechanisms and determine the connectivity among forest
fragments.
Whatever the mechanisms for geographic dispersal, it is
clear that, at Beza Mahafaly, M. griseorufus is not limited to
spiny-forest habitats, though dispersal patterns may indicate a preference. In contrast to the situation at Berenty
where M. griseorufus has been described to occupy the
spiny forest and M. murinus the gallery forest [10], M. griseorufus at Beza Mahafaly occupy gallery forests, dry forests, and spiny forests. How this species adapts to the very
different microhabitats is the subject of the ongoing
behavioral study at Beza Mahafaly by Rasoazanabary.
Finally, it is apparent that, despite a lack of genetic structure of populations of mouse lemurs across the microhabitats at Beza Mahafaly, individuals from the spiny forest
do differ slightly (but statistically significantly) from individuals in the gallery forest in such features as body
length, ear length, and skull length. The developmental
basis of this variation will also require further analysis. It
is clear, however, that both habitats play an important
role in the maintenance and possibly the development of
diversity in this species and both should be a priority in
future conservation efforts in this region.

Conclusion
Using a combination of phylogenetics and population
genetic methods, we were able to determine that all
mouse lemur individuals sampled at Beza Mahafaly
belong to the species M. griseorufus, regardless of pelage
characteristics. Three pelage-color variants exist in all
three forests, in roughly similar proportions. This evidence supports the hypothesis that non-visual cues are
paramount in social interactions of individual mouse
lemurs, and that, to the extent that vision is important, it
does not depend on color discrimination. We also determined that mouse lemurs from ecologically distinct sampling locations display no genetic structuring.
While we are confident in the results produced in this
study, it is limited as only a single mtDNA gene was used

to make inferences. Therefore, we recommend that further
work be performed to confirm the results and conclusions
made in this study, primarily through the inclusion of
nuclear genetic markers.

Methods
Field Methods
Between April 1 and August 15, 2003, 120 Sherman live
traps were set at intervals of 25 m in 7.5-hectare sampling
areas in each of the three forests. Sampling was conducted
for a total of 23 days in each forest (69 days combined). A
total of 89 Microcebus were captured (45 in the spiny forest, 21 in the gallery forest, and 23 at Ihazoara). Pieces of
banana were used to lure mouse lemurs into the traps.
Captured individuals were weighed using a Pesola spring
scale and temporarily anesthetized (0.01 ml or less of telazol, depending on body mass). Anesthetized individuals
were measured, marked, and released after full recovery
from the effects of the anesthesia. Each individual was
scored for the presence or absence of a reversed V, the
presence or absence of a dorsal median stripe, the color of
the fur, and the color of the tail. Skull length, bizygomatic
breadth, body length, tail length, ear length and canine
height were recorded for each captured individual. Clips
(ca. 2 mm2) were taken from each ear, and preserved in
70% ethanol.
Laboratory methods
Eighty ear tissue samples were delivered to Yale for molecular analysis; ten of these yielded no DNA or DNA of
insufficient quality for analysis. Each had identifying field
(or microchip) codes, but, to ensure blind analysis of the
DNA, no information regarding location or pelage coloration accompanied the samples. Mitochondrial DNA was
extracted using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN cat.
no. 51306). The full cytochrome b gene region was amplified and sequenced for seventy of the sampled individuals
using two pairs of primers L14724/H15261 and L15171/
UMMZ [9]. The PCR protocol was 5:00 min. of 95.0° followed by 35 cycles of 95.0° for 0:45 sec., 52.0° for 0:45
sec., 72.0° for 1:00 min., and a final extension of 72.0°
for 5:00 min. PCR products were cleaned with a QIAquick
PCR purification kit (QIAGEN cat. no. 28106). The
cleaned products were cycle sequenced using a big dye-terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The sequences were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis with an Applied Biosystems Prizm 3100 genetic
analyzer. Cytochrome b sequences were aligned by eye in
Sequencher and exported into MacClade [47] for further
editing.
Molecular Analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of the molecular data was performed using Bayesian methods, implemented in Mr.
Bayes v. 3.1.2 [48] using the model GTR+I+G. The model

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/98

of evolution was selected with Modeltest v. 3.06 [49] and
chosen based on the Akaike information criterion [50].
Identical haplotypes were represented only once in the
analyzed phylogenetic dataset. Four Metropolis-coupled
MCMC chains were run for ten million generations with
trees sampled every 1000 generations. Tracer software 1.2
[51] was used to examine stationarity of log posteriors to
estimate a burn, which was discarded.
An AMOVA [52] was performed in Arlequin v. 2.000 [53]
to explore hierarchical patterns of population genetic
structure between M. griseorufus at Beza Mahafaly and Berenty. AMOVA uses the frequencies of haplotypes and the
number of mutations between them to test the significance of the variance components associated with various
hierarchical levels of genetic structure (within populations, among populations within groups, and among
groups) by means of non-parametric permutation methods [52]. Sampling sites were treated as individual populations to test for overall genetic subdivision. Uncorrected
pair-wise distances were used to estimate the relative contribution of molecular variance of M. griseorufus at Beza
Mahafaly and Berenty.
The program MIGRATE v.2.1.3 [54,55], was used to
jointly estimate effective population sizes (Θ = Ne*mu)
and asymmetric dispersal rates (M = m/mu) between the
three populations of M. griseorufus found in the Beza
Mahafaly area. Parameters were estimated using the Bayesian search strategy [56], using default priors. MIGRATE
runs were replicated to verify consistency, each replicate
consisting of 10 short chains and four long chains that
were heated (1.0, 2.3, 3.6, 9.0) for 10,000,000 steps
excluding 10,000 steps as burn in.
A haplotype network was created using the software package TCS v. 1.21 [57]. The program collapses DNA
sequences into haplotypes and calculates the frequencies
of haplotypes in the sample. It then calculates an absolute
distance matrix from which it estimates phylogenetic networks using a probability of parsimony, until the probability exceeds 0.95 [58].
Analysis of morphological variation
We used SPSS Version 14 for our analysis of coat and morphometric characteristics. Pearson chi-square was used to
determine the significance of differences in pelage coloration at the three sites. Discriminant function analysis of
morphometric variables (body length, tail length, skull
length, bizygomatic breadth, ear length, and canine
height) was used to determine whether populations at the
gallery forest, spiny forest, and Ihazoara could be distinguished from one another on the basis of a set of morphometric variables collected over the entire three-year
period. Only first captures (196 individuals) were entered

Page 9 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:98

into these analyses, to avoid repeated sampling of the
same individuals. Following Hoaglin and others [59], univariate analyses (ANOVA) were applied in an exploratory
sense to determine the magnitude and direction of site
differences for those variables found (using Discriminant
Function Analysis) to distinguish mouse lemurs at the
three sites.
