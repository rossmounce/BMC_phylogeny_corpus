varies with sex, social status, and reproductive
state

Abstract
Background: Gonadal and stress-related steroid hormones are known to influence auditory function across
vertebrates but the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for steroid-mediated auditory plasticity at the level
of the inner ear remain unknown. The presence of steroid receptors in the ear suggests a direct pathway for hormones
to act on the peripheral auditory system, but little is known about which receptors are expressed in the ear or whether
their expression levels change with internal physiological state or external social cues. We used qRT-PCR to measure
mRNA expression levels of multiple steroid receptor subtypes (estrogen receptors: ERα, ERβa, ERβb; androgen
receptors: ARα, ARβ; corticosteroid receptors: GR2, GR1a/b, MR) and aromatase in the main hearing organ of the inner
ear (saccule) in the highly social African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, and tested whether these receptor levels were
correlated with circulating steroid concentrations.
Results: We show that multiple steroid receptor subtypes are expressed within the main hearing organ of a single
vertebrate species, and that expression levels differ between the sexes. We also show that steroid receptor subtypespecific changes in mRNA expression are associated with reproductive phase in females and social status in males. Sexsteroid receptor mRNA levels were negatively correlated with circulating estradiol and androgens in both males and
females, suggesting possible ligand down-regulation of receptors in the inner ear. In contrast, saccular changes in
corticosteroid receptor mRNA levels were not related to serum cortisol levels. Circulating steroid levels and receptor
subtype mRNA levels were not as tightly correlated in males as compared to females, suggesting different regulatory
mechanisms between sexes.
Conclusions: This is the most comprehensive study of sex-, social-, and reproductive-related steroid receptor mRNA
expression in the peripheral auditory system of any single vertebrate. Our data suggest that changes in steroid
receptor mRNA expression in the inner ear could be a regulatory mechanism for physiological state-dependent
auditory plasticity across vertebrates.
Background
The peripheral and central auditory system of vertebrates
is sensitive to sex- and stress-related steroid hormones,
which can have profound effects on how an animal perceives acoustic information and ultimately behaves during social interactions. While steroids such as estradiol
are known to influence hearing in many vertebrate taxa
[1-4], the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible
for steroid-mediated auditory plasticity at the level of the
inner ear remain unknown.

In mammals, females often have "better" hearing (e.g.,
improved high frequency hearing; shorter auditory brainstem response wave latencies) and later-onset of agerelated hearing loss compared to males, as well as
changes in hearing ability associated with the ovarian
cycle and pregnancy [1]. Further, postmenopausal
women who are on estrogen-based hormone replacement
therapy (HRT) have better hearing than those who are
not [1], while progestin-based HRT can diminish hearing
ability [5,6]. These sex and female ovarian cycle variations
in auditory ability are attributed to the protective effects
of estrogen and may be partially related to estrogen
receptor (ER) expression in the cochlea. This idea is sup-

ported by studies that demonstrate ERβ knockout mice
that have profound hearing impairment and hair cell loss
[7], and changes in ERα abundance in the ear that are correlated with fluctuating estrogen levels during pregnancy
in rats [8]. A role for estrogen in hearing also extends to
non-mammalian vertebrates. In female midshipman fish
(Porichthys notatus), for example, estradiol shifts the tuning of primary afferent neurons that innervate the main
hearing organ (saccule) possibly to better encode the
higher frequency components of the male's advertisement call during the breeding season [3,9]. Moreover,
ERα and aromatase, an enzyme necessary for estrogen
biosynthesis, are found in the inner ear, which suggests
direct action of estradiol at the periphery [3,10,11]. In
contrast to these well-known effects of estradiol on hearing function [12], relatively little is known about how
androgens might influence hearing (but see [3,13,14]) or
whether androgen receptors (AR) are also expressed
within the inner ear of vertebrates.
Physical or emotional stress and the subsequent release
of glucocorticoid hormones (i.e., cortisol or corticosterone) can also regulate auditory sensitivity and inner ear
homeostasis [15-17]. Moreover, glucocorticoids are used
to treat several hearing disorders in humans such as hearing loss, tinnitus, Meniere's disease and autoimmune disease because of their quick (time course of seconds to
hours) therapeutic response in the inner ear [1,18]. Glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR)
that respond to both cortisol and aldosterone are found
in the inner ear of several mammalian species (i.e., mice,
rats, guinea pigs, humans) [19-21], but have not yet been
described in other vertebrate taxa. The conserved function of cortisol in the stress response system suggests a
possible similar hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (or interrenal)-hearing link in non-mammalian vertebrates.
For steroids to influence hearing at the periphery, steroid receptors must be present in the inner ear, but few
studies have measured steroid receptor expression in the
vertebrate ear. Sex and/or stress-related steroid receptors
have been localized to the inner ear in one fish [10,11,22],
one bird [23], and several mammals [1], but little is
known about how steroid receptor expression in the ear
varies between the sexes within a species or across different reproductive states within a sex. Many vertebrates,
especially teleost fishes, express multiple subtypes of a
particular steroid receptor (i.e., ERα and ERβa/b, ARα
and ARβ, GR2 and GR1a/b), and the distribution and
abundance of these different forms within a tissue are
known to be important determinants of how estrogen,
androgen, and corticosteroid hormones function [24].
Our current understanding of the prevalence of multiple
ER, AR, and CR isoforms within the ear of a single vertebrate species, however, is incomplete. Indeed, only
recently have investigators begun to study changes in

receptor expression as a potential mechanism for auditory plasticity [8,25]. To fully understand how steroid
hormones might influence vertebrate inner ear function,
we measured the expression patterns of all known ERs,
ARs, and CRs in a single species, along with circulating
gonadal and stress hormone levels.
Cichlid fishes use multiple sensory cues (i.e., visual,
olfactory, auditory, mechanosensory) to coordinate their
complex social behaviors, and show great diversity in
reproductive and parental care strategies, which makes
them excellent models for analyzing how hormones influence sensory function. We examined steroid receptor
expression in the inner ear of the African cichlid fish
Astatotilapia burtoni, a species that is endemic to shallow
shore pools of Lake Tanganyika. A. burtoni live in a leklike social system where males exist in one of two phenotypes: 1) dominant territorial males (~10-30% of population) that are brightly colored, aggressively defend a
spawning territory, and actively court and spawn with
females; and 2) subordinate non-territorial males that
school with and resemble females in coloration, perform
subordinate behaviors, and do not court females [26].
Males can rapidly and reversibly switch between dominant and subordinate appearance and behavior depending solely on the composition of the social environment.
Importantly, this social transformation in males causes a
suite of behavioral and physiological changes along the
reproductive axis [27]. Females do not have a similarly
organized social system, but typically school with subordinate males and enter the territories of dominant males
only to eat and spawn. After spawning, females rear the
developing young in their mouths (mouth brooding) for 2
weeks before releasing them, and then physiologically
recover before spawning again. While visual cues are critically important for social behaviors in this species,
hydrodynamic and acoustic signals detected by the lateral
line and inner ear are also likely essential for perception
of social information. Territorial male A. burtoni produce
courtship sounds, which are a series of pulses emitted
during quivering behaviors in the presence of a female
(Figure 1 and Maruska and Fernald, personal observations), as well as hydrodynamic sounds associated with
body movements during specific behavioral acts [26,28].
These A. burtoni courtship sounds are very similar to
those described in other cichlids [29-31] and may provide
crucial information on reproductive condition, dominance status, fish size, or location of feeding and spawning territories that complement visual cues. Since
auditory cues may be important for social behaviors in
this species, the inner ear could be an important substrate for steroid-mediated auditory and social plasticity.
Our goal for this study was to test whether steroid
receptor mRNA expression in the main hearing organ of
a teleost fish, the saccule, varied between sexes or across

Figure 1 Sound production during male courtship behavior in
the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. Dominant territorial
males (fish at left) produce sounds that consist of ~4-12 short (~15-20
ms) pulses during body quivering while they present their anal fin eggspots (arrow) towards a female (fish at right). Courtship sounds are always accompanied by male quivering behavior, but not all quivers are
associated with sound production, which supports the hypothesis of
intentional sound production for communication. Representative
waveforms of individual courtship sounds from three different dominant territorial males are shown. Recordings were made with a calibrated hydrophone (High Tech, Inc.; sensitivity -163.7 dB re: 1 V/μPa;
frequency response 2 Hz-30 kHz) suspended in the tank above the
spawning territory.

reproductive and social states within a sex, and whether
these changes were correlated with circulating steroid
levels. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
study of sex-, social-, and reproductive-related steroid
receptor mRNA expression in the peripheral auditory
system of any vertebrate. Our data provide support for
the hypothesized conserved action of steroid hormones
in the vertebrate inner ear.

Results
GSI and circulating steroid levels

GSI differed among all three reproductive stages in
females (KW, H = 28.10, p < 0.001; Dunn's test, p < 0.05),
where gravid females had mean values about four-fold
greater than recovering females and ten-fold greater than
brooding females (Figure 2A). GSI was also two-fold
greater in dominant males compared to subordinate
males (Student's t-test, t = -6.50, p < 0.001) (Figure 2A).
Circulating cortisol levels did not differ significantly
among females in different reproductive states (KW
ANOVA, H = 3.52, p = 0.172) nor between male phenotypes (Mann-Whitney, U = 51.5, p = 0.833) (Figure 2B).
There was no correlation between serum cortisol levels

and GSI for either males (r = 0.003, p = 0.990) or females
(r = 0.121, p = 0.490).
Serum E2 levels differed among all three female reproductive phases where gravid individuals had concentrations two-fold higher than recovering and over 10-fold
higher than brooding individuals (ANOVA, F = 14.09, p <
0.001) (Figure 2C). In males, dominant individuals had
serum E2 levels over 20-times higher than subordinate
individuals (Mann-Whitney, U = 0.0, p < 0.001). GSI was
also positively correlated with circulating E2 levels in both
females (r = 0.49, p = 0.003) and males (r = 0.78, p <
0.001).
Circulating T and 11-KT levels also differed among all
three female reproductive phases in the same pattern as
E2 (T: ANOVA, H = 22.73, p < 0.001, Dunn's test, p < 0.05;
11-KT: ANOVA, F = 14.14, p < 0.001, Tukey's test, p <
0.05) (Figures 2D, E). Dominant males had approximately
10-fold higher serum T (Mann-Whitney, U = 1.0, p <
0.001) and 11-KT (Mann-Whitney, U = 1.0, p < 0.001)
levels compared to subordinate males (Figures 2D, E).
GSI was also positively correlated with serum T (females:
r = 0.51, p < 0.001; males: r = 0.49, p = 0.025) and 11-KT
(females: r = 0.67, p < 0.001; males: r = 0.49, p < 0.001)
concentrations in both females and males.
Androgen receptor mRNA expression in the saccule

ARα and ARβ mRNA levels differed among all three
female reproductive phases where brooding individuals
had the highest levels followed by recovering and then
gravid animals (ARα: KW, H = 25.75, p < 0.001, Dunn's
test, p < 0.05; ARβ: 1-way ANOVA, F = 18.58, p < 0.001,
Tukey's test, p < 0.05) (Figures 3A, B). In contrast, there
was no difference in either ARα or ARβ mRNA levels of
subordinate compared to dominant males (Student's ttests, ARα: t = 1.30, p = 0.207; ARβ: t = 0.098, p = 0.923)
(Figures 3A, B).
Estrogen receptor and aromatase mRNA expression in the
saccule

In females, ERα mRNA levels differed among all three
reproductive phases with brooding individuals showing
the highest levels, followed by recovering and then gravid
animals (KW, H = 18.0, p < 0.001, Dunn's test, p < 0.05)
(Figure 4A). In males, subordinates had greater levels of
ERα compared to dominant animals (Mann-Whitney
rank sum test, U = 27.0, p = 0.030) (Figure 4A).
ERβa mRNA levels were lower in gravid females compared to both brooding and recovering individuals (KW,
H = 16.29, p < 0.001, Dunn's test, p < 0.05) (Figure 4B).
Subordinate males also had two-fold higher ERβa levels
compared to dominant males (Mann-Whitney rank sum
test, U = 16.0, p = 0.004) (Figure 4B). ERβb mRNA levels
did not differ among reproductive phases in females (KW,

among all three reproductive phases in an identical pattern to that of ERα (1-way ANOVA, F = 8.04, p = 0.001,

were greater than levels found in gravid females (KW, H =
16.99, p < 0.001, Dunn's test, p < 0.05) (Figure 5D). In
males, subordinate animals had higher levels of all four
CRs (GR2, GR1a, GR1b, MR) compared to dominant animals (Student's t-tests GR2: t = 4.04, p < 0.001; GR1a: t =
2.02, p = 0.050; GR1b: t = 1.95, p = 0.050; Mann-Whitney
rank sum test MR: U = 17.0, p = 0.005) (Figures 5A-D).
Steroid receptor mRNA expression in the female brain

The pattern of steroid receptor mRNA levels in the
female brain differed from that observed in the inner ear.
Brain ARα mRNA levels were greater in gravid females
compared to both brooding and recovering females (KW,
H = 7.01, p = 0.030, Dunn's test, p < 0.05) (Figure 3A
inset). Gravid females also showed higher levels of ERα
than both brooding and recovering females (1-way
ANOVA, F = 3.67, p = 0.037, Tukey's test, p < 0.05) (Figure 4A inset). In contrast to the saccule, there was no difference among females in aromatase expression in the
brain (KW, H = 0.742, p = 0.690) (Figure 4D inset). GR2
and MR mRNA levels were higher in brooding females
compared to both gravid and recovering females (GR2: 1way ANOVA, F = 4.37, p = 0.021, Tukey's test, p < 0.05;
MR: 1-way ANOVA, F = 4.27, p = 0.023, Tukey's test, p <
0.05) (Figures 5A, 5D insets).
Sex differences in saccular steroid receptor mRNA levels

On average, females had two to five-fold greater mRNA
levels of both ARs compared to males (Mann-Whitney
rank sum tests, p < 0.05) (Table 1). Females also had
higher levels of aromatase and ERα, but not ERβa or
ERβb, compared to males (Mann-Whitney rank sum
tests, p < 0.05) (Table 1). In contrast, mRNA levels of all
four CRs in the saccule were higher in males compared to
females (Mann-Whitney rank sum tests, p < 0.05) (Table
1).
Correlations between receptor mRNA levels and circulating
steroid levels and GSI

Correlations between steroid receptor mRNA levels in
the saccule and circulating CS, E2, T, and 11-KT levels are
summarized in Table 2 (females) and Table 3 (males).
There was a positive correlation between serum CS levels
and GR1a expression in the saccule of males, but no other
relationships between any GR type and CS levels were
found in either sex.
There was a negative correlation between serum E2 levels and both ERα and ERβa in the saccule of both males
and females, but no relationship between E2 and ERβb in
either sex (Tables 2, 3). Further, circulating E2 levels were
also negatively correlated with aromatase expression in
the saccule of females but not males.
There was a negative correlation between circulating
androgen (T and 11-KT) levels and ARα, ARβ, ERα, ERβa

Page 8 of 17

and aromatase in the saccule of females (Table 2). In
males, there was a negative correlation between circulating T levels and saccular expression of ERβa and ARα, but
not ARβ (Table 3). Circulating T levels were also positively correlated with serum E2 levels in both females (r =
0.87, p < 0.001) and males (r = 0.67, p < 0.001).
In contrast to the saccule, receptor mRNA levels in the
female whole brain samples were not well correlated with
circulating steroid levels, with the exception of a positive
correlation between ARα and T (r = 0.36, p = 0.034).
Serum CS was not correlated with brain mRNA levels of
GR2 (r = 0.16, p = 0.376) or MR (r = 0.12, p = 0.504). Brain
ERα and aromatase mRNA levels were also not correlated
with either E2 (ERα: r = 0.24, p = 0.181; aromatase: r =
0.08, p = 0.667) or T (ERα: r = 0.25, p = 0.167; aromatase:
r = -0.07, p = 0.680).
Correlations between steroid receptor mRNA levels in
the saccule and GSI are summarized in Table 4. In
females, GSI was negatively correlated with mRNA levels
of all sex-steroid receptor subtypes except ERβb, as well
as negatively correlated with the corticosteroid receptors
GR2 and MR. In males, there was only a single negative
correlation between GSI and GR1a.

Discussion
Our data on mRNA expression patterns of steroid receptors in the saccule of A. burtoni demonstrate that 1) multiple steroid receptor subtypes are expressed in the inner
ear of a single fish species; and 2) steroid receptor mRNA
levels vary with sex, social status in males, and reproductive condition in females. While previous studies in
diverse taxa show the presence of some steroid receptors
in both sensory and non-sensory tissues of the inner ear,
their expression patterns are rarely quantified. Our study
confirms expression of multiple ERs, ARs, CRs, and aromatase in the inner ear of a single vertebrate species, and
reveals a previously undescribed plasticity in receptor
transcript abundance related to both internal reproductive state and the external social environment. These data
provide support for the hypothesis that, in addition to
circulating steroid levels, auditory function and inner ear
homeostasis could also be regulated by variations in
receptor levels in the ear. Future studies are needed, however, to determine whether or not these changes reflect
functional significance.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate
the presence of ERβ, and multiple ARs, GRs and MR
mRNA in the inner ear of any non-mammalian vertebrate
(but see [22]). Our data indicate that steroid receptor
expression, and therefore steroid sensitivity, in peripheral
auditory structures may be a conserved feature among
vertebrates. However, a whole-mount in situ hybridization study in zebrafish Danio rerio did not detect ER
mRNA within the inner ear, but did show abundant ER

expression within the morphologically and functionally
similar lateral line neuromasts [32], which also raises the
possibility of species-specific differences even within
broad taxonomic groups. Unique distribution profiles of
multiple steroid receptor isoforms in the same species is
common among vertebrates and suggests sub-functionalization [24,33]. In teleost fishes, little is known about
ligand-induced activation profiles of receptor subtypes in
a single species, but there is evidence for both differential
activation of ARs, CRs, and ERs by the same ligand, as
well as activation of a single receptor subtype by multiple
ligands [34-38]. This pattern of multiple interactions
highlights the potential complexity of steroid-mediated
transduction pathways, and given the profound organizational and activational effects of steroids in vertebrates,
implicates the auditory system as an important target for
all classes of steroid hormones.
Corticosteroid receptor mRNA expression

The corticosteroid signaling system in teleost fishes is
complex, and in A. burtoni, all four types of CRs are activated by both cortisol and aldosterone (although it is
thought that teleosts do not synthesize aldosterone-like
compounds) [35]. Expression levels of each CR subtype
also differ among body tissues, which is indicative of
functional specialization [35]. Here we show further dif-

ferential expression of each CR subtype within the inner
ear that is related to reproductive state in females and
social status in males. However, there was little evidence
that changes in CR expression in the ear are regulated by
circulating cortisol levels, with the exception of the positive correlation between GR1a and serum CS levels in
males. It is possible that CR expression is regulated by
local glucocorticoid levels within the fluid of the inner ear
that differs from circulating cortisol measures, or that
CRs are regulated independently of their ligands. Alternatively, CRs may be regulated by compounds in the corticosteroid biosynthetic pathway other than CS such as
11-deoxycorticosterone or some yet unidentified aldosterone-like hormone. Glucocorticoids can both up-regulate and down-regulate synthesis of specific proteins
within cochlear tissue of the rat [39], which highlights the
importance of examining CR subtype distribution, abundance, and transduction pathways. In mammals, serum
mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid levels are correlated with Na+, K+-ATPase activity (an enzyme thought to
play an important role in endolymph production) in the
cochlea [40,41], but the hypothesis that Na+, K+-ATPase
levels are regulated by GR or MR expression could not be
verified [42,43]. Nevertheless, corticosteroids and CR
expression are likely important for maintenance of ion

balance and metabolic state of the inner ear across vertebrates, but the mechanisms remain to be elucidated.
Estrogen receptor and aromatase mRNA expression

Saccular levels of ERα, ERβa and aromatase were lower in
female A. burtoni undergoing ovarian recrudescence in
preparation for spawning compared to mouth brooding
females that put little investment into egg growth until
the parental care period is over. However, it is important
to note that changes in the CYP19b aromatase form may
be different from the CYP19a form measured here, and
requires future investigation. Serum E2 levels in females
were also negatively correlated with ERα, ERβa, and aromatase mRNA levels in the saccule, indicating down-regulation of E2-sensitive pathways in the inner ear during
ovarian recrudescence associated with high E2 production. High circulating estrogen levels during pregnancy
are also associated with a down-regulation of ERs in the
inner ear of mother rats [8]. Unfortunately, the relationship between steroid receptor expression in the ear, circulating hormone levels, and hearing ability within a single
species are largely unknown so it is difficult to comment
on whether high estrogens and low ER expression trans-

late into changes in hearing. For example, in the midshipman fish, gravid females alter their auditory frequency
tuning so they can better hear the male's advertisement
call during the breeding season, a phenomenon mimicked by exogenous treatment with E2 or T [3,44]. While
these females have high circulating E2 levels just prior to
the spawning period (i.e., pre-nesting) [45], and they do
express ERα and CYP19b aromatase in the saccule [10], it
is not known whether this seasonal plasticity is regulated
by changes in ER expression in the ear. In mice however,
aromatase knockouts (with little to no measurable serum
E2 levels) show decreased ERβ staining in the cochlea,
and greater threshold shifts in response to acoustic
trauma compared to wild-type individuals, but no difference in normal hearing thresholds [46]. This indicates a
very specific protective effect of ERβ in response to
trauma, which may also be species-specific. In A. burtoni,
females can reproduce and brood young year-round and
changes in inner ear steroid receptor expression are coupled to gonadal state and serum hormone levels, which
suggests some potential yet unknown consequence on
saccular maintenance or function.

moment or Spearman rank tests. P-values in bold indicate significant relationships at p < 0.05 (Bonferroni correction p < 0.0013).

In contrast to ERα and ERβa, ERβb mRNA levels did
not differ among females of different reproductive states
or between males of different social status. ERβb mRNA
levels in the ear were also not correlated with circulating
E2 levels in either sex, which suggests this subtype probably does not serve as a substrate for feedback regulation
from estrogens. In zebrafish, direct E2 exposure resulted
in strong stimulation of ERα expression, but reduced
ERβ1 (equivalent to ERβb of A. burtoni) and had little
effect on ERβ2 (equivalent to ERβa of A. burtoni) mRNA
in the liver [34], indicating that ER subtypes are differentially regulated by the same ligand and likely serve distinct physiological functions. In mammals, the ERβ
subtype is important for maintaining hearing capabilities
by preventing age-related hearing loss, and providing
protection from acoustic trauma via a mechanism that
involves brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [7,46]
and possibly activation of intermediate filaments [47].
The absence of status- and reproductive-related variations in ERβb in A. burtoni suggests that this subtype may
be important for regular maintenance of auditory function or homeostasis in non-mammalian vertebrates as
well.

Androgen receptor mRNA expression

Androgen receptors in the saccule of female A. burtoni
differed among reproductive states, and females had two
to three-fold greater AR mRNA levels than males. AR
mRNA expression in the inner ear has only been demonstrated in one other vertebrate, the midshipman fish
[11,22], so it is difficult to evaluate whether these reproductive- and sex-related variations seen in A. burtoni are
present in other taxa. AR expression in the ear, however,
was negatively correlated with circulating androgens in
females suggesting down-regulation of ARs by high
androgen levels produced during oocyte growth and maturation. This ligand-receptor regulatory mechanism may
also explain the elevated AR levels in the ear of females
that have lower androgen levels compared to males. In
contrast to the well-known effects of estrogens on auditory function, relatively little is known about how androgens may influence hearing or inner ear homeostasis.
Prenatal exposure to high levels of androgens are hypothesized to masculinize the cochlea and contribute to sexdifferences in click-induced otoacoustic emissions in
mammals [48], but since ARs have not yet been found in
the cochlea, it is not known whether these organizational

effects are mediated directly by ARs or possibly via ERs
after aromatization. In the midshipman fish, testosterone
causes a shift in frequency tuning of saccular afferents
that is similar to estradiol treatment [3], and coupled with
the recent finding of AR in the ear of that species [11]
suggests direct androgen influence at the periphery. Our
discovery of multiple ARs in the adult vertebrate inner
ear and their plastic expression further supports the
hypothesis that androgens can also have direct activational effects on the ear, but the mechanisms and impact
on auditory function require further study.
Comparison of steroid receptor mRNA expression between
the saccule and brain

The patterns of steroid receptor gene expression in the
inner ear of A. burtoni differed from that observed in
whole brain samples from the same female individuals.
For example, gravid females with high plasma androgen
levels had the lowest levels of AR in the saccule, but had
the highest AR levels in the brain. This pattern was also
true for males where sex-steroid receptor levels in the ear
were higher in subordinate compared to dominant animals, but levels in sub-regions of the brain were higher in
dominant compared to subordinate males [49]. Further,

there were fewer correlations between circulating steroid
levels and receptor mRNA levels in the brain than there
were in the inner ear. These data raise the possibility that
steroid receptors in the brain and inner ear are regulated
by different mechanisms. For example, receptor levels in
the ear may be more influenced by peripheral steroid levels, while the brain may depend less on circulating hormones and more on local steroid production within
specific brain regions to regulate receptors (i.e., neurosteroids) [50]. It is also important to note that steroid
receptors are found in many different brain nuclei and
measures of receptor expression in whole brains, or large
heterogeneous brain regions, may be very different from
localized changes in specific processing centers.
Functional consequences

In the cichlid fish A. burtoni, social status regulates
reproductive opportunity and fertility. Subordinate males
have a suppressed brain-pituitary-gonad axis with small
GnRH1 neurons, low levels of gonadotropin hormones,
reduced testicular size, and low circulating levels of sex
steroids compared to dominant reproductively active
males [27,51-53]. Here we provide evidence that the
peripheral auditory system is also a substrate for social

Maruska and Fernald BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/11/58

regulation of gene expression. Levels of ERα, ERβa, and
all four CRs were higher in the inner ear of subordinate
compared to dominant males. However, the negative correlations between circulating sex-steroid levels and
receptor expression in the ear indicates that it may not be
social status per se that regulates this plasticity, but rather,
transformation of the reproductive axis causes variations
in serum hormone concentrations that in turn regulate
receptor levels. While this mechanism may explain the
pattern of higher ER levels in the saccule of subordinate
males, it does not rationalize the fact that levels of both
ARs are equivalent among male phenotypes despite subordinate animals having much lower serum androgen
concentrations. Thus it is possible that social cues do
have direct effects on AR expression in the inner ear of
males that is independent of ligand-mediated control
from the general circulation. These data also suggest that
the regulatory mechanisms of receptor expression in the
ear may differ between the sexes such that receptor
expression in females is influenced by internal physiological state, while in males, external social cues coupled
with yet unknown pathways may play a larger role.
Subordinate A. burtoni males also have higher CR
expression in the saccule, a difference which for subtypes
other than GR1a is not explained by either GSI or circulating CS levels. Social suppression alone may modulate
inner ear CR expression directly, or act via mechanisms
independent of the brain-pituitary-gonad or hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis. In previous studies,
serum CS levels often do not differ between subordinate
and dominant A. burtoni males when examined at ≤ 5
weeks in an established community, but subordinate
males do have much higher CS levels after longer time
periods (~7 weeks) [54,55]. Thus it is possible that circulating CS levels would better correlate with CR expression at later time points. Examination of steroid receptor
levels and serum steroid levels of males transitioning
between subordinate and dominant states, or manipulation of plasma steroid levels independent of social status,
will help resolve whether social status or reproductive
state-related hormone concentrations regulate receptor
expression in the ear.
Estradiol appears to improve hearing ability in all vertebrate models studied to date [12], particularly in females.
In A. burtoni, gravid females have high circulating E2 levels, and were previously shown to prefer dominant over
subordinate males, as well as smaller more active males
over less active ones [56]. In cichlids, the peak frequency
of courtship sounds is related to fish body size [29,30],
thus providing females with an honest signal for mate
choice decisions. For example, more active small males
would produce more frequent courtship sounds of higher
frequency, providing gravid females with auditory information to supplement visual and other sensory cues that

Page 13 of 17

can be used to choose a mate. Interestingly, in another
teleost fish, the midshipman, estradiol shifts auditory
tuning in females towards higher frequencies as an adaptation for coupling of sender-receiver physiology [3]. Our
finding of reproductive-related plasticity in steroid receptor expression in the ear of females raises the possibility
that hormones may profoundly influence both female
mate choice and the evolution of male signaling behaviors
for acoustic communication. Future studies are needed,
however, to determine the relative importance of auditory cues during courtship, and the effects of estradiol
and other steroids on hearing ability in this and other
species.

Conclusions
Our data show the presence of multiple sex- and stressrelated steroid receptors in the fish inner ear, and that
their mRNA levels vary with sex, internal physiological
state (i.e., circulating hormones) and social status. This is
the most comprehensive study of sex-, social-, and reproductive-related steroid receptor mRNA expression in the
peripheral auditory system of any single vertebrate, and
provides support for the hypothesized conserved function(s) of steroid receptor-mediated influence within the
inner ear. The next steps are to discover which cell types
within the fish inner ear express different steroid receptor
subtypes, whether observed changes in mRNA expression are reflected in protein abundance, and what functional consequences these variations in receptor levels
might have on auditory function and inner ear homeostasis.
Methods
Animals

Laboratory-bred adult male and female cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, derived from wild-caught stock in Lake
Tanganyika, Africa, were maintained in aquaria under
environmental conditions that mimic their natural equatorial habitat (28°C; pH 8.0; 12 h light: 12 h dark with full
spectrum illumination; constant aeration), and fed cichlid
pellets and flakes (AquaDine, Healdsburg, CA, USA) each
morning. Aquaria contained gravel-covered bottoms
with terra cotta pots cut in half to serve as spawning territories. All experimental procedures were approved by the
Stanford Administrative Panel for Laboratory Animal
Care.
Stable dominant and subordinate males were established by initially placing two dominant territorial males
from separate community tanks together in an aquarium
with a single terra cotta pot territory and 4 females. In
this situation, social interactions between the two males
result in one male becoming dominant over the other,
usually in less than an hour. The dominant male then
defends the territory and uses it to court and spawn with

Maruska and Fernald BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/11/58

females, while the subordinate male becomes drab-colored, is frequently chased by the newly dominant individual, and becomes reproductively suppressed. Fish were
observed daily to verify that the dominant and subordinate males were stable phenotypes and maintained their
social status for 4-5 weeks, a time sufficient to ensure
behavioral and reproductive suppression in the subordinate animals.
Female A. burtoni breed year round and provide sole
parental care to developing young which they brood in
their mouths. Females have three distinct reproductive
phases, which were selected for analysis: 1) Mouth
brooding females had mouths filled with large full-term
embryos (standard length 8.2 ± 1.5 mm SD) that they had
been brooding for 14 days. Mouth brooding females generally do not eat and provide sole care for the developing
young; 2) Gravid females had visibly swollen abdomens,
numerous large "ready-to-spawn" eggs (some eggs were
readily released from the ovary upon dissection in all
individuals indicating they were at or near ovulation), and
a correspondingly high gonadosomatic index, and; 3)
Recovering females (neither gravid nor mouth brooding)
were created by releasing full-term fry from mouth
brooders to initiate ovarian recrudescence, and then
returning them to their community tanks to recover for
12 days (~equivalent to approximately half of the average
ovarian cycle period of 25-30 days) prior to sacrifice.
Tissue preparation

All fish used in this study were sacrificed at the same time
of day (9:30-10:30 am) to control for any potential diurnal
changes in gene expression, and were size-matched to
account for any differences due to body size (female SL,
ANOVA p = 0.078; male SL, t-test p = 0.086). Fish were
captured from their tanks, anesthetized in ice-cold tank
water, and standard length (SL) and total body mass (BM)
measured. Immediately before sacrifice by rapid cervical
transection, blood samples (50-100 μl) were collected
from the caudal vein by caudal severance with heparinized 100 μl capillary tubes within 2 min of capture. Blood
was centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm, and the plasma
was removed and stored at -80°C until assayed.
The inner ear of teleosts consists of three semicircular
canals (anterior, posterior, and horizontal canals) that
serve a vestibular function to detect angular accelerations
of the head, and the three otolithic endorgans (saccule,
lagena, and utricle) that serve gravistatic and auditory
functions to encode linear particle motion. The saccule is
the largest otolithic endorgan in A. burtoni and is considered the main hearing organ in most teleost fishes. Both
the left and right saccule (saccular epithelium, otolithic
sac with sagitta removed, and a portion of the saccular
nerve proximal to the sensory macula) were rapidly
removed, flash frozen, and stored at -80°C until analysis.

Page 14 of 17

Testes and ovaries were also removed and weighed to calculate the gonadosomatic index [GSI = (gonad mass/body
mass) × 100].
Saccular tissue was homogenized and RNA extracted
following standard methods (RNeasy Micro kit, Qiagen).
RNA was treated with DNase (RNase-free DNase set,
Qiagen) during the isolation procedure according to kit
instructions to remove contaminating genomic DNA.
RNA concentration and purity was estimated from spectrophotometric absorbance (260 nm and 280 nm) for all
samples. Approximately 0.25 μg of total RNA was reverse
transcribed to cDNA (iscript cDNA synthesis kit, BioRad) and diluted 1:5 prior to use as a template for quantitative RT-PCR reactions.
Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR)

Astatotilapia burtoni has two androgen receptors (ARα,
ARβ), three estrogen receptors (ERα, ERβa, ERβb), and
four corticosteroid receptors (glucocorticoid: GR2, GR1a,
GR1b; mineralocorticoid: MR) [35,49,57]. The previous
nomenclature of glucocorticoid receptors in A. burtoni
(GR1, GR2a/b) [35] was modified based on recent phylogenetic comparisons that showed the originally described
A. burtoni GR1 was more similar to the GR2 subtype of
other teleosts, and that the splice variants GR2a/b were
more similar to GR1a/b [58]. Therefore, here we use the
following terminology for GRs: GR2 (formerly GR1), and
GR1a/b (formerly GR2a/b). Similarly, some recent
reports on estrogen receptors in fishes have adopted the
ESR1 (formerly ERα), ESR2a, (formerly ERβ2, ERβa, or
ERγ), and ESR2b (formerly ERβ1 or ERβb) nomenclature
based on official zebrafish guidelines http://zfin.org. In
this manuscript, however, we refer to the originally
named A. burtoni ER subtypes as ERα, ERβa, and ERβb to
facilitate comparison with the mammalian inner ear studies that also use the ERα and ERβ terminology.
Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA
expression of the abovementioned nine different steroid
receptor subtypes, plus the aromatase enzyme, from the
saccule of both males and females. Whole brains (without
olfactory bulbs) were also collected from all of the
females sampled in this study (RNA isolated as above
except that RNeasy mini kits were used and 1.0 μg RNA
was reverse transcribed to cDNA) and used to measure
steroid receptor levels representative of each receptor
type (ARα, ERα, aromatase, GR2, MR) to test for differential regulation between the inner ear and another relevant
steroid-sensitive tissue. Brains from males were not analyzed for gene expression because they were used as part
of a separate study, and sex-steroid receptors in the brain
of dominant and subordinate males were already measured in a previous study [49]. The iQ Sybr Green supermix (Bio-Rad) was used for qRT-PCR reactions with
gene-specific primers. Aromatase primers were designed

Maruska and Fernald BMC Neuroscience 2010, 11:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/11/58

based on the previously cloned A. burtoni sequence
(Genbank #AF114716), which is most similar to the ovarian CYP19a form: forward 5'-TTG TGG GTG AGA GAC
AGC TTC AGA-3'; reverse 5'-TGT TTG TGC CCT TCG
GTA TCC TGT-3' (165 bp product). Primers for all steroid receptor genes and the reference genes, 18s rRNA
and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphodehydrogenase (G3PDH),
were commercially synthesized and identical to those
used in previous studies [35,49,59,60]. Each primer pair
produced a single melting curve peak in the presence of
cDNA template, and showed no amplification when
water was used as a template in the reaction mix, or when
reverse transcriptase was omitted from the cDNA synthesis reaction (negative controls). qRT-PCR was performed on an iCycler (MyiQ, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and
the reaction progress in 30 μl volumes was monitored by
fluorescence detection at 490 nm during each annealing
step. Reaction parameters were 3 min at 95°C followed by
45 cycles of 95°C, 60°C, and 72°C for 30 s each, and followed by a melting curve analysis over the temperature
range of 95°C to 50°C (decrease by 0.5°C increments each
cycle). Samples were loaded into 96-well plates such that
each plate measured 1-2 genes and contained samples
from each of the five experimental groups. Amplification
occurred prior to cycle 30 for all genes and all samples
(mean CT values for all 10 target genes ranged from 24.52
- 29.40). All reactions were performed in duplicate and
several reaction products per gene were verified by DNA
sequencing (Sequetech, Mountain View, CA).
Fluorescence thresholds for each sample were automatically measured (MyiQ software, Bio-Rad) and then PCR
Miner [60] was used to calculate reaction efficiencies and
cycle thresholds from the fluorescence readings of individual wells during the reaction. This curve-fitting realtime PCR algorithm objectively calculates reaction efficiency and the fractional cycle number at threshold (CT)
of the amplification curve for more accurate computation
of mRNA levels. By using the kinetics of individual reactions, estimates of efficiency and CT are independent of
the specific equipment used to perform PCR reactions
and data can be reliably compared across plates. The relative amount of mRNA was then normalized to the geometric mean of two housekeeping genes (18s and
G3PDH) that were also measured in each sample with the
following equation: relative target mRNA levels = [1/(1 +
Etarget)^CTtarget]/[1/(1 + Egeomean)^CTgeomean] × 100, where
E is the reaction efficiency and CT is the average cycle
threshold of the duplicates [49,59,61]. Normalization to
multiple reference genes, rather than a single gene, provides a more accurate quantification of mRNA levels
[62,63]. Mean CT values for 18s and G3PDH did not differ between male phenotypes or among female groups (p
> 0.05), demonstrating they are appropriate reference
genes for the comparison of mRNA levels within a sex.

Page 15 of 17

However, when mean CT values were compared between
sexes, those of 18s (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.021), but
not G3PDH (p = 0.092), differed between pooled males
and females. For sex comparisons, we therefore normalized the target genes only to G3PDH.
Steroid assays

Plasma testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT),
estradiol (E2) and cortisol (CS) were measured using
commercially available Enzyme ImmunoAssay (EIA) kits
(Cayman Chemical, Inc.). For CS, serum was directly
diluted 1:40 in assay buffer prior to plating. For T, 11-KT,
and E2, a 5 μl sample of plasma from each subject was
extracted three times using 200 μl of ethyl ether and
evaporated under a fume hood prior to re-constitution in
assay buffer (1:40 dilution; extraction efficiencies 8789%). EIA kit protocols were then strictly followed, plates
were read at 405 nm using a microplate reader (UVmax
Microplate Reader, Molecular Devices), and steroid concentrations determined based on standard curves. All
samples were assayed in duplicate, intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were: CS (7.3%, 10.6%); T (6.2%,
10.3%); 11-KT (4.9%, 3.1%); E2 (6.0%, 9.1%), and interassay CVs were: CS (5.7%); T (8.4%); 11-KT (4.2%); E2
(6.2%). Each EIA kit was validated by extracting steroids
from a pooled A. burtoni serum sample and comparing
that serially diluted sample curve to the standard curve
for that particular hormone according to the methods
described by Plikaytis et al. [64]. Parallelism was confirmed according to these guidelines for all four steroid
assays: within-dilution CVs were all ≤ 15%, (CS, 1.28.2%;T, 6.4-9.4%;11-KT, 0.13-7.6%; E2, 0.0-7.9%), and
within-assay CVs were all ≤ 20% (CS, 0.51%; T, 7.2%; 11KT, 0.48%; E2, 6.5%). Absolute hormone values measured
here were similar to those reported in previous A. burtoni
studies that also used EIA kits [51,55,65].
Statistics

Data sets that were normally distributed with equal variances were analyzed with Student's t-tests or one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Tukey's tests
for multiple comparisons. Data that did not meet the
assumptions of parametric statistics were compared with
Mann-Whitney rank sum tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests
(KW) with post-hoc Dunn's tests. For consistency however, all data are plotted as mean ± standard errors (SE)
with appropriate statistical test values reported in the
text. To test for sex differences in mRNA levels for each
receptor subtype, data were also pooled within each sex
and then compared with Mann-Whitney tests. Correlations were assessed with either Pearson product moment
tests (parametric) or Spearman rank tests (non-parametric). Our results are presented and interpreted without

the use of conservative corrections for multiple comparisons such as the Bonferroni correction. However, Bonferroni corrected p-values are also indicated in the
correlation tables for reference (Bonferroni corrected p =
0.05/n, where n is the number of hypotheses tested on a
set of data). While the use of Bonferroni and related procedures may reduce Type I errors, they also reduce statistical power and increase the chance of Type II error to an
unacceptable level, especially in cases of smaller sample
sizes (i.e., n < 30) [66]. We therefore chose to report
observed effect size (e.g., r values) along with exact p-values to allow reader evaluation of biological importance,
rather than utilize the overly conservative Bonferroni
correction. Statistical comparisons were performed with
SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA.).
