Abstract
Background: It is generally assumed that primordial cells had small genomes with simple genes coding
for enzymes able to react with a wide range of chemically related substrates, interconnecting different
metabolic routes. New genes coding for enzymes with a narrowed substrate specificity arose by
paralogous duplication(s) of ancestral ones and evolutionary divergence. In this way new metabolic
pathways were built up by primordial cells. Useful hints to disclose the origin and evolution of ancestral
metabolic routes and their interconnections can be obtained by comparing sequences of enzymes involved
in the same or different metabolic routes. From this viewpoint, the lysine, arginine, and leucine
biosynthetic routes represent very interesting study-models. Some of the lys, arg and leu genes are
paralogs; this led to the suggestion that their ancestor genes might interconnect the three pathways. The
aim of this work was to trace the evolutionary pathway leading to the appearance of the extant
biosynthetic routes and to try to disclose the interrelationships existing between them and other pathways
in the early stages of cellular evolution.
Results: The comparative analysis of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of lysine, leucine, and arginine,
their phylogenetic distribution and analysis revealed that the extant metabolic "grids" and their
interrelationships might be the outcome of a cascade of duplication of ancestral genes that, according to
the patchwork hypothesis, coded for unspecific enzymes able to react with a wide range of substrates.
These genes belonged to a single common pathway in which the three biosynthetic routes were highly
interconnected between them and also to methionine, threonine, and cell wall biosynthesis. A possible
evolutionary model leading to the extant metabolic scenarios was also depicted.
Conclusion: The whole body of data obtained in this work suggests that primordial cells synthesized
leucine, lysine, and arginine through a single common metabolic pathway, whose genes underwent a set of
duplication events, most of which can have predated the appearance of the last common universal ancestor
of the three cell domains (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucaryotes). The model proposes a relative timing for
the appearance of the three routes and also suggests a possible evolutionary pathway for the assembly of
bacterial cell-wall.

Background
It is commonly assumed that early organisms inhabited
an environment rich in organic compounds spontaneously formed in the prebiotic world, an idea that is often
referred to as the Oparin – Haldane theory. Those primordial organisms had no need for developing new and
improved metabolic abilities since most of the required
nutrients were available. However, their increasing
number would have led to the depletion of essential nutrients imposing a progressively stronger selective pressure
that, in turn, favoured those (micro)organisms that have
become able to synthesize the nutrients whose concentration was decreasing in the primordial soup. Thus, the origin and the evolution of basic biosynthetic pathways
represented a crucial step in cellular evolution, since it
rendered the primordial cells less dependent on the external source of nutrients. But how did these metabolic pathways emerge and evolve? Several theories have been
proposed to explain how the metabolic routes have been
assembled (see [1] and reference therein). Even though it
is possible that different processes might have been
responsible for the build up of metabolic routes, a large
body of data concerning both sequence comparison and
experimental data on enzymes substrate specificity
strongly supports one of them, that is the patchwork assembly theory [2]. According to this idea, metabolic pathways
might have been originated through the recruitment of
primitive enzymes that could react with a wide range of
chemically related substrates. Such relatively slow, unspecific enzymes may have enabled primitive cells containing
small genomes to overcome their limited coding capabilities. Paralogous gene duplication event(s) followed by
evolutionary divergence might have permitted the appearance of enzymes with an increased and narrowed specificity and/or the functional diversification. In this way, an
ancestral enzyme belonging to a given metabolic route
was "recruited" to serve a single or other (novel) pathways. The importance of gene duplication in the course of
evolution of genomes and metabolic pathways is well
established [3]: the production of two (or more) copies of
a DNA sequence leads to an increase of genome size, and
it also allows the (rapid) diversification of enzymes, providing material for the invention of new enzymatic properties and complex regulatory and developmental
patterns. Therefore, gene duplication should have had a
deep impact on primordial metabolism. Indeed, it is quite
possible that the biochemical flexibility of the ancestral
enzymes might result in an extreme interconnection
among different metabolic routes. Hence, the duplication
event(s) followed by evolutionary divergence, allowing
gaining of novel metabolic capabilities, permitted the new
metabolic pathways to be less branched and interconnected to each other. How can this issue be studied? Useful hints to disclose the origin and evolution of metabolic
pathways and the possible ancestral interrelationships

between different routes may be obtained by comparing
the sequence and the structure of genes (and/or the products they code for) of the same and different routes from
(micro)organisms belonging to the three cells domains
(Archaea, Bacteria and Eucarya). In this context the lysine,
arginine, and leucine biosynthetic pathways represent
interesting study-models. One of the main reasons is the
existence of two well-distinct routes that have been characterized for the anabolism of lysine, that is the α-aminoadipate (AAA) pathway and the diaminopimelate
(DAP) one [4-6] (Figure 1). The first one starts from 2oxoglutarate and leads to lysine, through nine steps, one
of which (catalyzed by LysN) is responsible for the formation of α-aminoadipate. Up to now, genes belonging to
this pathway have been found in a limited number of
(micro)organisms, such as the Bacteria Thermus thermophilus and Deinococcus radiodurans [7-9] and the
Archaea Pyrococcus [8], Thermoproteus [10], and (probably)
Sulfolobus [10,11]. A distinct variant of the AAA pathway
has been disclosed in higher Fungi [6,12-14] and in euglenoids [15,16]. The alternative route leading to lysine,
referred to as the DAP pathway, involves nine enzymatic
reactions and produces lysine starting from L-aspartate.
The DAP pathway also plays a central role in cell-wall biosynthesis of gram-negative bacteria, since meso-diaminopimelate is an essential precursor in the biosynthesis of
peptidoglycan [17,18]. Genes involved in the DAP pathway are widespread in both Prokaryotes and Eucaryotes
[19,20]. Interestingly, AAA and DAP pathways are evolutionary linked to leucine and arginine biosynthesis. The
relationship existing between genes belonging to these
biosynthetic routes has been previously analyzed ([19]
and reference therein) and is schematically represented in
Figure 1. The products of the four genes involved in the
DAP pathway (ask, asd, dapC, and dapE) are evolutionary
related to arginine biosynthetic enzymes encoded by argB,
argC, argD and argE, respectively [19]. Some of the
enzymes involved in the AAA pathway share a high degree
of sequence similarity with enzymes belonging both to
leucine and arginine biosynthetic routes [8,19] since the
first four enzymes of the Thermus-like AAA biosynthetic
pathway (LysS, LysT, LysU, and Homoisocitrate dehydrogenase) are homologous to the corresponding enzymes of
leucine biosynthesis (LeuA, LeuC, LeuD, LeuB) [8,19,21].
Moreover LysZ, LysY, LysJ and LysK are homologous to
ArgB, ArgC, ArgD, and ArgE, respectively [19,22]. The high
degree of sequence similarity shared by these enzymes led
to the suggestion that: i) the assembly of both the DAP
and AAA routes might be explained as the outcome of a
series of gene duplication events followed by specialization [19], ii) the DAP route should represent the ancestral
pathway leading to lysine and, iii) the AAA pathway
should be a more recent invention of evolution[19].

However, in spite of the available data, no evolutionary
model explaining the extant scenario has been proposed.
The aim of this work was to try to trace the evolutionary
history of the three metabolic pathways and to shed some
light on the ancestral route(s) and interrelationships existing between them and (eventually) with other metabolic
routes. To this purpose, a comparative analysis of the
extant leucine, arginine, and lysine metabolic pathways
from (micro)organisms whose genome has been completely sequenced was carried out.

BLAST probing, the only ddh archaeal homolog sequence
was found in Archaeoglobus fulgidus genome (data not
shown).

Results and discussion

iv) Arginine biosynthetic genes are widespread among
Archaea and Bacteria. Even though a complete set is found
only in a restricted number of organisms, most of them
possess more than half (from five up to eight) of the
enzymes required for the biosynthesis of ornithine and
arginine, confirming the previous observation that they
are synthesized through N-acetylated intermediates both
in Bacteria and in Archaea [29].

Distribution of leucine, arginine and lysine biosynthetic
genes
The amino acid sequence of each of the E. coli lysine
(DAP), leucine, and T. thermophilus lysine (AAA) biosynthetic enzymes, was used as a query to probe the completely sequenced genomes database of KEGG (Kyoto
Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes) consisting of 29
Archaea, 423 Bacteria and 35 Eucaryotes. The bidirectional best-hit (BBH) criterion (see Methods) was used to
retrieve orthologous sequences. Data obtained, schematically reported in Figure 2 and representative of a dataset of
68 bacterial and 15 archaeal genomes, revealed that:

i) Lysine (AAA) biosynthetic genes are very rarely represented in Bacteria, in that just two organisms harbour the
complete set of AAA biosynthetic genes, i.e. T. thermophilus and D. radiodurans. No other bacterium possesses
the complete set of enzymes required to synthesize lysine
via the AAA route. Six Archaea display a complete set of
lysine (AAA) biosynthetic genes, namely Pyrococcus and
Sulfolobus strains, and Thermococcus kodakaraensis.
ii) Lysine (DAP) biosynthetic genes are widespread
among Bacteria. Among them, 18 (micro)organisms possess a complete set of genes (9) for lysine biosynthesis
through the DAP route. The small number of lysine (DAP)
biosynthetic genes in some bacterial strains is very likely
due to the absence of the corresponding metabolic route,
which, in turn, is related to the parasitic lifestyle of these
organisms. Such a lifestyle may allow these bacteria to
acquire essential compounds directly from the metabolic
activities of their host and the adaptation to this environmental condition might have caused the loss of entire
metabolic routes or parts thereof.
Although some Archaea are known to synthesize lysine
through the DAP pathway [23-28], it is not still completely clear which of the possible variants they use.
Nonetheless, no archaeon possesses a number of genes
compatible with the number required by the succinylasic
variant. When the ddh sequence of Corynebacterium
glutamicum, whose product is involved in the dehydrogenasic variant of lysine (DAP) pathway, was used in a

iii) The complete set of leucine biosynthetic genes is
present in most of Bacteria and Archaea that possess either
all the five leucine biosynthetic genes or four of them
(lacking the last gene of leucine biosynthetic route, ilvE).
This different distribution of ilvE, had already been
observed by Velasco et al. [19].

Structure of leucine, arginine, and lysine biosynthetic
pathways
A comparative analysis of the lysine, leucine, and arginine
biosynthetic routes of completely sequenced organisms
belonging to the three cellular domains (Eucarya, Bacteria, and Archaea) was carried out. Data obtained for some
representative organisms belonging to the three cellular
domains are shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5 and can be summarised as reported below.

In most of archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic
(micro)organisms each of the three amino acid is synthesized through a specific metabolic route and each enzyme
catalyzes a single step of the metabolic pathway it belongs
to. The only exception is represented by the archaeon
Pyrococcus horikoshii (see below); moreover a bifunctional enzyme, coded for by argD, interconnecting
arginine and lysine biosyntheses was identified and characterized in Escherichia coli (see below).
In all of the organisms analyzed, leucine is synthesized
through the typical biosynthetic pathway, consisting of
the enzymatic steps catalyzed by 3-isopropylmalate synthase, 2-isopropylmalate isomerase, 3-isopropylmalate
dehydrogenase, and α-ketoisocaproate transaminase,
respectively. The four enzymes are coded for by the procaryotic leuA, leuCD, leuB, and ilvE genes, or by the eucaryotic LEU9\4, LEU1, LEU2, and BAT1\2 (Figures 3, 4, 5).
Similarly, arginine biosynthesis proceeds through the
same steps in all the organisms taken into account (Figures 3, 4, 5).
The lysine biosynthesis is much more intriguing; the
amino acid can be synthesized through either the AAA or

the DAP pathway (see Background). The AAA pathway
was found in T. thermophilus and D. radiodurans, and a
modified version of it was found in S. cerevisiae (Figure 4a
and Figure 5a). The first four metabolic steps are shared by
the two organisms and are evolutionarily related to the
corresponding ones of leucine biosynthesis [8,19]. The
second moiety of these two AAA versions is different. In T.
thermophilus lysine biosynthesis is achieved by the products of lysZ, Y, J, and K, whose sequences are homologous
to argB, C, D, and E, respectively, whereas in S. cerevisiae
lysine biosynthesis is completed by LYS2, LYS9, LYS1, that
have no homolog among the genes of the biosynthetic
pathways we took into account.
In the other Bacteria and in some Archaea, lysine is synthesized through the DAP pathway. Even in this case, several alternatives are possible. In the γ-proteobacterium E.
coli (Figure 4c) the product of DapB is converted in LLmeso-diaminopimelate through four sequential enzymatic steps, known as the succinylate variant, and performed by DapD, ArgD, DapE, and DapF. Moreover, the
enzyme coded for by argD exhibits both N-acetyl-orni-

thine and N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase activities, with a very similar catalytic efficiency and
identical kinetic mechanism, suggesting that this enzyme
can play a role in both lysine and arginine biosynthesis
[30]. In C. glutamicum (Figure 4b) another version of the
pathway has been disclosed: tetrahydrodipicolinate can
be converted into meso-diaminopimelate by the activity
of diaminopimelate dehydrogenase (ddh) in a single metabolic step. It is highly likely that this catalytic step is
present also in the DAP pathway of the archaeon Haloarcula hispanica (Figure 3a) [23]. Interestingly, in C. glutamicum two distinct enzymes (ArgD and DapC) can perform
the reaction that in E. coli is carried out by a single one.
Thus, the enzymes encoded by argD and dapC in C.
glutamicum can be considered specific for the biosynthetic
routes of arginine and lysine, respectively.
Arabidopsis thaliana is known to synthesize lysine through
the DAP pathway [15,31]. A DAP variant has been
recently identified in this plant that utilizes a novel
transaminase (LL-aminoadipate aminotransferase, the
product of ORF At4g33680) that specifically catalyzes the
conversion of tetrahydrodipicolinate to LL-diaminopimelate, a reaction requiring three enzymes in the
DAP-pathway variant found in E. coli [32].
The archaeon P. horikoshii represents the main exception.
In fact, in this organism just one pathway for the biosynthesis of all these three amino acids has been identified so
far (Figure 3b). On the basis of sequence comparison and
phylogenetic analyses, it has been suggested [9] that ORF
PH1722, PH1724, PH1726, and PH1727 (see Figure 3b)
from P. horikoshii might be involved in leucine biosynthesis as well as in the AAA variant of lysine biosynthesis, and
that ORF PH1720, PH1718, PH1716, and PH1715 (Figure 3b) might be involved in the biosynthesis of both
lysine (through the AAA one) and arginine. Even though
it cannot be ruled a priori out the possibility that other
uncharacterized routes for the biosynthesis of these
amino acids may exist [33], it has been suggested that P.
horikoshii possesses a unique amino acid biosynthetic system by which several amino acids are synthesized by a
limited number of enzymes with broad substrate specificity [8].
A hypothetical ancestral pathway for lysine, leucine, and
arginine
Data shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5 reveal that some steps of
lysine, leucine, and arginine biosynthetic pathways are
strongly conserved among the organisms we have taken
into account. These steps are the first three of leucine route
(performed by LeuA, LeuCD, and LeuB), the central ones
of the arginine route (performed by ArgB, ArgC, ArgD, and
ArgE), and the first two of lysine (DAP) route (performed
by Ask and Asd). Moreover, these enzymes, share a signif-

icant degree of sequence similarity with some of those
involved in the AAA lysine biosynthesis [19]. As shown in
Figure 1, leuA, leuCD, and leuB appeared to be paralogous
to lysS, lysTU, and homoisocitrate dehydrogenase coding
gene, respectively. A similar paralogy exists between argB,
ask, and lysZ, as well as among argC, asd, and lysY. Velasco
et al. [19] suggested that all of them are the outcome of
one or more duplication events of an ancestral set of
genes. According to the patchwork hypothesis [2], these
ancestral genes might have encoded enzymes possessing
broad substrate specificity and have been involved in different metabolic pathways.

alogy existing between their coding genes has not been
analyzed in detail up to now, but its description is beyond
the scope of the present work. Moreover, the first three
steps of this ancestral biosynthetic pathway might have
included the reactions that, in the extant organisms, are
separately accomplished by the enzymes of leucine and
lysine-AAA pathways. Moreover, the last four steps,
involving the ancestral copies of the extant ArgB, C, D,
and LysZ, Y, J, K, may have been able to recognize different substrates and to catalyze their conversion into ornithine, a fundamental intermediary in arginine
biosynthesis.

On the basis of the analysis of phylogenetic distribution,
Velasco et al. [19] also proposed that the DAP variant of
lysine biosynthesis appeared earlier than the AAA one.
However, a different scenario can be proposed. The model
that we describe here predicts the existence of an ancestral
pathway consisting of a set of genes, some of which coding for unspecific enzymes able to react with a wide range
of chemically related substrates. This metabolic pathway
interconnected lysine, leucine, arginine and also methionine and threonine biosyntheses and nitrogen fixation
(Figure 6). According to the model, the first step of the primordial route was catalyzed by the ancestor of the extant
isopropylmalate synthase (IPMase, LeuA) and homocitrate synthase (HCase, NifV), that are involved in leucine
biosynthesis and nitrogen fixation, respectively. The par-

Even though these ancestral enzymes may have been the
backbone of the hypothetical common route, some others
might have been necessary to complete the biosynthesis
of all the corresponding products. An ancestor of the
extant IlvE might have catalyzed the conversion of 2-oxoisocaproate into leucine, the final step of leucine biosynthesis, whereas an unspecific aminotransferase may have
accomplished the transamination of α-aminoadipate, the
extant role of LysN.
Moreover, an ancestral copy of LysX, which is evolutionarily related to E. coli RimK [34], was probably involved in
the modification of α-aminoadipate to N-acetyl-α-aminoadipate, releasing the substrate of LysZ/ArgB/Ask ancestor. As shown in Figure 5, the model proposed does not

contemplate the biosynthesis of LL-diaminopimelate in
primordial cells, implying that the AAA pathway predated
the appearance of the DAP pathway.
In conclusion, ancestral organisms may have been able to
synthesize lysine, leucine and ornithine using just one
pathway, consisting of a small number of enzymes
endowed with a broad substrate specificity, permitting a
clear interconnection of different metabolic routes.
A model for the evolution of lysine, leucine, and arginine
metabolic routes
On the basis of the structure and the relationships existing
in the extant biosynthetic routes leading to lysine, leucine,
or arginine we depict a possible evolutionary model that
might explain the (complex) extant scenario.

The model predicts the existence of the above described
ancestral pathway (Figures 6 and 7a) that appears to be
very similar to that responsible for the biosynthesis of

lysine, leucine, and ornithine in P. horikoshii (Figure 3b
and 6). It has been proposed [8] that P. horikoshii might
have developed unique amino acid biosynthetic systems
in which several amino acids are synthesized by a limited
number of enzymes with broad substrate specificity and
that these enzymes might be the ancestors of the extant
biosynthetic ones of lysine, leucine, and arginine.
If the idea of an ancestral common pathway for the biosynthesis of lysine, leucine and arginine is correct, this
raises the question of how did the extant routes originate.
Besides, which was the timing of their appearance? Here
we propose a model that is in agreement with the Nishida's idea and predicts that the extant biosynthetic routes
might have emerged after a set of duplication events
involving the genes of the ancestral common pathway
(Figure 7). According to the model, the first step (or one
of the first steps) might have been the duplication of the
genes encoding the enzymes catalysing the sixth and seventh steps of the route common to lysine and ornithine.

this work.

These events gave raise to the ancestors of ask and asd
genes and to the overall metabolic "grid" that has been
found in P. horikoshii (Figures 3b and 7b). This idea is also
supported by the phylogenetic analysis (see next section).
Later on, the duplication of the genes encoding the first
three steps of the ancestral pathway and the further evolutionary divergence of the new copies might have originated the ancestor of leuA, leuCD, and leuB, which coded
for enzymes with a more narrow substrate specificity, rendering the leucine biosynthesis independent from the
ancestral common pathway (Figure 7c). The central steps
of arginine biosynthesis, catalyzed by ArgB, ArgC, ArgD
and ArgE, might have arisen from the duplication and further evolutionary divergence of the corresponding ancestral aspecific genes (Figure 7d). In this way the four
metabolic routes leading to leucine, lysine, arginine, and
methionine\threonine, respectively, became one independent from each other. This metabolic scheme corresponds to that found in T. thermophilus and D. radiodurans.

A further duplication of the bottom genes of the ancestral
pathway led to the appearance of DapC and DapE; during
this step the branch of the "DAP pathway" leading to
lysine was completely assembled (Figure 7e) with the
recruitment of dapC and dapE (that are homolog to the
extant lysJ/argD and lysZ/argB, respectively), dapF, and
lysA. On the basis of the available data, it is not still possible to discern between the possibility that the product of
the reaction catalyzed by Asd directly interacts with DapC,
or if other enzymes (possibly the ancestor of the extant
dapA, dapB, and dapD) were required to complete the DAP
route. However, it is possible that once the assembly of
the lysine-branch of the DAP pathway was completed the
primordial cells possessed two alternative ways to synthesize lysine. If the model we propose here is correct, it is
possible that, in this context, the entire AAA pathway
became superfluous. Hence, the fourth step (Figure 7e) of
the model predicts that, after the completion of the DAP
pathway to lysine, genes belonging to the AAA pathway
were progressively lost; therefore those organisms lacking

the DAP pathway, maintained the ability to synthesize
lysine through the AAA route. The final step of the model
(Figure 7f) predicts that lysine (DAP) may have been completely assembled, with the appearance of all the extant
variants (deacetylasic, desuccynilasic, and dehydrogenasic), leading to the metabolic patterns found in E. coli and
in many other microorganisms. The development of the
DAP pathway might allow bacterial cells to acquire the
possibility to insert LL-diaminopimelate and meso-diaminopimelate, that are both intermediaries of the DAP
route, into their cell wall.
In our opinion, the duplication events from Figure 7a to
Figure 7e would have predated the appearance of the Last
Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), which, according
to Woese [35], would have been a complex community of
progenotes, highly dynamic from a genomic viewpoint, a
mix of heterogeneous primordial cells with different metabolic abilities that could be easily exchanged between the
different entities of the community. According to this
idea, cells with different metabolic grids such as those represented in Figure 7b and 7d might have co-existed in the
"LUCA community". The model also predicts, according

to Cavalier-Smith [36], that if the primordial cells were
surrounded by a cell wall containing peptidoglycan, ornithine should have been one of the first, if not the very first,
component of peptidoglycan (see Conclusions).
Phylogenetic analysis
According to the model proposed, the metabolic pathway
leading to methionine and threonine diverged from the
ancestral pathway before lysine, leucine, and arginine biosynthetic ones. However, (at least) another plausible scenario can be depicted, involving the previous appearance
of the leucine pathway and the further assembly of the
others biosynthetic routes. In other words, is it possible to
establish the relative timing of the separation of the extant
three pairs of genes involved in lysine, arginine, threonine, and methionine biosynthesis, that is lysZ and lysY,
argB and argC, and ask and asd?

Useful hints concerning this issue can be obtained by a
phylogenetic analysis of the two paralogous triads (LysZ,
ArgB, Ask, and LysY, ArgC, and Asd). To this purpose a
dataset of all the retrieved LysZ, ArgB, Ask and, LysY, ArgC,
and Asd amino acid sequences was aligned using the pro-

Similarly, the tree shown in Figure 8b, revealed that ArgC
and LysY sequences share a degree of similarity higher
than that exhibited with Asd. The overall body of phylogenetic data suggests that the first duplication event(s)
involving the ancestral common genes might have originated the ancestor of the extant ask and asd genes; hence,
argB and argC might be the outcome of a later duplication
event of their corresponding ancestral sequences.

gram ClustalW [37] and the multialignments obtained
used to draw the phylogenetic trees shown in Figure 8.
This analysis revealed that:
1. Ask sequences form a unique cluster, which is clearly
separated from the other one containing all the ArgB and
LysZ sequences involved in arginine and lysine (AAA) biosynthesis, respectively (Figure 8a).
2. Asd sequences form a unique cluster separated from
ArgC and LysY sequences, involved in arginine and lysine
biosynthesis, respectively (Figure 8b).
Hence, the topology of the tree in Figure 8a suggests that
ArgB and LysZ sequences share a degree of sequence similarity higher than that exhibited with Ask, respectively.

In this work a likely model for the evolution of genes
involved in the biosynthesis of lysine, leucine, and
arginine is depicted. The model proposed is based on the
analysis of the structure of these biosynthetic routes and
the phylogenetic distribution of their genes. The phylogenetic analysis performed allowed us also to determine a
possible relative timing of the appearance of genes that are
involved in the extant lysine (DAP) and arginine biosynthetic routes. This analysis gave a strong support to the
hypothesis that extensive gene duplication events played
a key role in shaping the extant biosynthetic routes of
lysine, leucine and arginine. According to the model proposed in this work a common metabolic pathway for the
biosynthesis of these three amino acids predated the
appearance of the last universal common ancestor. This
ancestral metabolic route was probably composed of a set
of unspecific enzymes able to react with chemically
related substrates interconnecting different biosynthetic
routes (Figure 6). The occurrence of multiple gene duplication events (Figure 7) would have led to the appearance
of specific metabolic pathways responsible for the biosynthesis of each amino acid. The evolutionary history of
lysine, leucine, and arginine biosynthetic routes strongly
supports the hypothesis on the origin and evolution of
metabolic pathways proposed by Jensen [2], strengthening the idea that the gene duplication and the recruitment
of genes encoding enzymes with a broad substrate specificity played a key role in the assembly of primitive metabolic routes.
Hence, starting from a metabolic network whose (highly
interconnected) nodes represent unspecific enzymes (Figure 6), novel metabolic networks have emerged, consisting of highly specialized (and less interconnected)
enzymes (Figure 1). In this way, ancestral enzymes
belonging to a given metabolic route, have been
"recruited" to serve a single or other (novel) pathways.
One of the main consequences of this evolutionary pathway, i.e. gene duplication followed by evolutionary diver-

gence, is the separation of metabolic routes that were
originally fused in a single, common one. The biological
significance of this cascade of duplication events might
rely on both (i) the appearance and refinement of regulatory mechanisms specific to each novel metabolic pathway and on (ii) the increased robustness acquired by the
whole metabolic network, i.e. its ability to respond to
environmental changes or to "knock-out" mutations falling within biosynthetic genes (while maintaining
unchanged biosynthetic activity). In fact, the removal of
one of the multifunctional enzymes belonging to the
ancestral common pathway of lysine, leucine and arginine
(Figure 6) would lead to auxotrophy to all of the three
amino acids. On the contrary, mutations silencing one of
the extant, specific biosynthetic genes may generate auxotrophy only for the amino acid whose biosynthetic route
has been interrupted, whereas all the others may still be
synthesized. In this latter case, the presence of a paralogous copy may still account for the reaction catalyzed by

the product of the silenced gene, permitting the biosynthesis of the corresponding amino acid and avoiding the
occurrence of any other auxotrophy. In this context the
dapC and argD genes (Figure 14b, 4c) represent a paradigmatic example. In E. coli (Figure 4c) the argD product
exhibits both N-acetyl-ornithine and N-succinyl-L,Ldiaminopimelate aminotransferase activities [30] whereas
in C. glutamicum two distinct enzymes, DapC and ArgDrespectively, perform these reactions [38]. Although the
genetic inactivation of E. coli argD and the consequences
of this disruption are still under investigation, it is likely
that it may generate auxotrophy to both diaminopimelate
(and lysine) and L-arginine [30]. On the contrary, the
simultaneous deletion of the dapC gene and ddh in C.
glutamicum does not generate auxotrophy to lysine, suggesting that the product of argD may substitute the DapC
function [38]. Since the simultaneous deletion of dapC,
ddh and argD genes from C. glutamicum does not affect its
growth, the existence of another aminotransferase able to

Page 10 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7(Suppl 2):S3

substitute ArgD and DapC, has been invoked [38]. This, in
turn, is in agreement with the well-established low substrate specificity of aminotransferases [39], that may allow
the enzymes carrying this activity to serve several different
metabolic pathways.
On the basis of gene distribution analysis, Velasco et al.
[19] proposed that the DAP pathway appeared earlier
than the AAA one. The model we have proposed is in disagreement with this view, in that it suggests that the AAA
pathway is the oldest one and that both pathways might
have been simultaneously (and transiently) present in the
"LUCA community". Since most bacteria, with the only
exception of T. thermophilus and D. radiodurans (TD
group), lack the AAA pathway, we suggest that, during the
separation of Archaea from Bacteria, the latter may have
lost the AAA pathway, maintaining the DAP pathway for
the biosynthesis of lysine, LL-diaminopimelate, and
meso-diaminopimelate (Figure 7e). The presence of the
AAA pathway in the TD group might be the result of an
event of horizontal gene transfer between an ancestor of
P. horikoshii and the ancestor of the (micro)organisms
belonging to the TD group as suggested by Nishida [9].
Alternatively, T. thermophilus and D. radiodurans have
maintained the AAA pathway. The model proposed fits
with the metabolic schemes shown in Figures 2, 3, 4 and
the timing of some duplication events is supported by the
phylogenetic analysis of triads of paralogous genes.
The distribution of the AAA and the DAP pathway in
Archaea defies a simple explanation since all currently
known pathways for lysine biosynthesis in Bacteria and
Eucarya exist also in the domain of Archaea [23]. Hence,
in the case of Archaea, a lineage specific maintenance of
the DAP or the AAA pathway for lysine biosynthesis seems
to be the most reliable hypothesis.
Lastly, on the basis of the scenario depicted in this work,
the evolutionary history of lysine, leucine, and arginine
biosynthetic routes might supply useful hints to disclose
the origin and the assembly of bacterial cell wall. In the
extant bacteria, the rigidity of the cell wall is due to a huge
macromolecule containing acylated amino sugars and
three to six different amino acids. This heteropolymer, the
peptidoglycan, is built out of glycan strands cross linked
through short peptides. In contrast to the uniform structure of the glycan, the peptide moiety reveals considerable
variations. The greatest variation occurs at position 3 of
the peptide moiety, where usually a diamino acid is
found. The most widely distributed diamino acid is mesodiaminopimelate. It is present in gram-negative bacteria
and in many other (micro)organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia, lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria,
actinomycetales,
myxobacteriales,
rickettsiae, and cyanobacteria. Some studies have shown

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S3

that the L-asymmetric carbon of meso-diaminopimelate is
bound to the peptide subunit (see [40] and references
therein). Studies on the amino acid composition and
sequence of the peptidoglycans of different gram-negative
bacteria have also shown that there is no great variation
within this group. The peptidoglycan of these bacteria
contains mainly meso-diaminopimelate, although Dglutamate and L-alanine can replace it.
The gram-positive bacteria reveal, contrary to the gramnegative organisms, a great variability in the composition
and structural arrangement of their peptidoglycan since it
can alternatively contain, at position 3, L-lysine, L-ornithine, D-glutamate, and LL-diaminopimelate.
Lastly, archaeal cells possess a fundamentally different
type of peptidoglycan. Its glycan moiety contains L-talosaminuronic acid instead of muramic acid, and its peptide moiety lacks D-amino acids, but it is present L-lysine
(see [40] and references therein).
As expected by the lack of DAP pathway, all those bacterial
(micro)organisms biosynthesizing lysine through the
AAA pathway (T. thermophilus, D. radiodurans) do not have
diaminopimelic acid within their cell wall [41,42]. In
these microorganisms diaminopimelic acid is replaced by
ornithine. In addition to this, LL-diaminopimelate and
meso-diaminopimelate, intermediaries of the DAP pathway (Figure 1), are compounds that can be found in the
cell wall of extant Bacteria [40], whereas they are absent in
the archaeal cell wall of Archaea [43]. Hence we suggest
that the maintenance of the DAP pathway for the biosynthesis of lysine, at least in Bacteria, might be correlated
with the appearance of the extant structure of their cell
wall. The ability of inserting these molecules in the cell
wall, might be an "invention" of Bacteria. In our opinion,
the primordial cells had ornithine as a component of peptidoglycan. This is in agreement with the recent suggestion
that the presence of ornithine within the cell wall might
be an ancestral feature [36] whose biosynthesis, in the primordial organisms, might have occurred through the previously proposed common route (Figure 6).
This evolutionary step corresponds to the last one that is
depicted in the evolutionary model that we have previously proposed (Figure 7f). This view might support the
idea that the insertion of the meso-diaminopimelate and,
probably, the appearance of the fully assembled DAP
pathway might be a metabolic invention of Bacteria.
