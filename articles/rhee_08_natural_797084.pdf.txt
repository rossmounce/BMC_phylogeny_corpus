Abstract
HIV-1 integrase is the third enzymatic target of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. However, few data
have been published on the distribution of naturally occurring amino acid variation in this enzyme.
We therefore characterized the distribution of integrase variants among more than 1,800 published
group M HIV-1 isolates from more than 1,500 integrase inhibitor (INI)-naïve individuals.
Polymorphism rates equal or above 0.5% were found for 34% of the central core domain positions,
42% of the C-terminal domain positions, and 50% of the N-terminal domain positions. Among 727
ARV-naïve individuals in whom the complete pol gene was sequenced, integrase displayed
significantly decreased inter- and intra-subtype diversity and a lower Shannon's entropy than
protease or RT. All primary INI-resistance mutations with the exception of E157Q – which was
present in 1.1% of sequences – were nonpolymorphic. Several accessory INI-resistance mutations
including L74M, T97A, V151I, G163R, and S230N were also polymorphic with polymorphism rates
ranging between 0.5% to 2.0%.

Introduction
HIV-1 integrase contains 288 amino acids encoded by the
3' end of the HIV-1 pol gene. It catalyzes the cleavage of the
conserved 3' dinucleotide CA (3' processing) and the ligation of the viral 3'-OH ends to the 5'-DNA of host chromosomal DNA (strand transfer). Integrase also plays a
role in stabilizing a pre-integration complex (PIC), which
consists of the 3'-processed genome and one or more cellular co-factors involved in nuclear transfer of the PIC
(reviewed in [1-4]).

HIV-1 integrase is composed of three functional domains:
the N-terminal domain (NTD), which encompasses
amino acids 1–50 and contains a histidine-histidinecysteine-cysteine (HHCC) motif that coordinates zinc
binding, the catalytic core domain (CCD) which encompasses amino acids 51–212 and contains the catalytic
triad D64, D116, and E152, known as the DDE motif, and
the C-terminal domain (CTD), which encompasses
amino acids 213–288 and is involved in host DNA binding.

Crystal structures of the CCD plus CTD domains [5] and
the CCD plus NTD domains [6] have been solved, but the
relative conformation of the three domains and of the
active multimeric form of the enzyme are not known.
There is one published crystal structure of the CCD bound
to an early prototype diketo acid inhibitor (5CITEP) [7]
but no structures of the CCD bound to one of the integrase inhibitors (INIs) in clinical use or to a DNA template. Because of the difficulties in obtaining structures of
the most biologically relevant forms of the enzyme and of
most integrase-INI structures, much of the functional
roles of different integrase residues have been identified
through biochemical and systematic amino acid replacement studies (reviewed in [8]).
One INI, raltegravir, has been licensed for the treatment of
HIV-1 infection and a second INI, elvitegravir, is in
advanced clinical trials. Mutations associated with resistance to these inhibitors have been identified through in
vitro and in vivo selection studies (reviewed in [9]) and
through in vitro susceptibility testing. The purpose of this
study is to supplement the structural and biochemical
assessment of integrase function and INI resistance by
summarizing naturally occurring variation in published
sequences of group M integrase, particularly as this variation applies to positions associated with INI resistance.

Methods
Sequence retrieval and annotation
The HIV-1 subtype B consensus integrase amino acid published by the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database was
used to query the GenBank database V 165.0 (released on
2008-04-15) using the blastp program. Human and primate lentivirus virus sequences having an e-value of <
0.04 and containing 200 or more homologous amino
acids were aligned to the query sequence using a nucleotide to amino acid alignment program [10]. Each
sequence was annotated according to its primary publication, the host species from which it was obtained, the
year, country, and biological source of its isolation, and
the ARV drug class exposure of the individual from whom
the sample was obtained. Each set of sequences from a
publication was annotated according to whether the
sequences were obtained from one or more than one individual in that publication. Sequences from the same individual were annotated according to whether they were
obtained at the same or different times. Sequences were
also characterized according to whether obtained directly
from PCR-amplified material or from one or more separate clones. For the purposes of analysis, only one
sequence per individual were used. For individual with
multiple sequences, the first sequence was used. For integrase isolates for which multiple clones were sequenced,
the consensus of the clones was used.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/74

Insertions, deletions, and mutations were defined as differences from the HIV-1 subtype B consensus amino acid
sequence. The retrovirus species and the HIV-1 group of
each sequence was defined according to the sequence
annotation in GenBank and confirmed through phylogenetic analysis. HIV-1 group M subtype was assigned phylogenetically by including each group M sequence in a
neighbor-joining tree containing 100 sequences that had
previously been characterized by full genomic sequencing
including sequences belonging to subtypes A, B, C, D, F,
G, H, J, and K and to the circulating recombinant forms
(CRFs) 01 to 19. This set of 100 sequences included the 65
subtype-specific reference sequences assembled by the Los
Alamos HIV Sequence Database [11] supplemented by 35
sequences so that a minimum of three published
sequences belonging to each subtype and CRF was
included. The neighbor joining tree was created from a
distance matrix computed using the HKY method with a
gamma distribution calculated by PAUP 4.0. Sequences
that formed a clade with reference sequences belonging to
the same subtype were assigned to that subtype.
Sequences that did not form a clade with references
belonging to the same subtype but that were within a
genetic distance of 0.12 from a reference sequence were
assigned to the subtype of the closest sequence.
Sequence quality control
Four categories of sequences were excluded from analysis
including (i) sequences of uncertain provenance that
lacked sufficient annotation as to the sequence's origin,
(ii) sequences submitted to GenBank more than once or
derived from a previously submitted sequence through
experimental manipulation either in vitro or in a primate
model ("experimental sequences"), (iii) case reports of
complete genomic sequences that were submitted to GenBank because of some unusual characteristic unrelated to
integrase or to sequence diversity (e.g. a strain with
unique tropism characteristics, or a strain associated with
an epidemiologic cluster), and (iv) sequences of poor
quality defined as having two or more of the following
features: stop codons, frame shifts, highly ambiguous
nucleotides (B, D, H, V, N), active site mutations, or
unique insertions or deletions.
Analysis of sequence heterogeneity
For most analyses, polymorphisms were defined as mutations present in ≥ 0.5% of group M sequences. However,
all mutations at essential integrase positions or at known
INI-resistance positions that were present in sequences
from one or more individuals are also noted in the text.

To compare HIV-1 integrase heterogeneity with that of
protease and RT, we assembled virus sequences from ARVnaïve individuals for which the complete pol gene had
been sequenced. For this set of sequences, we calculated

the uncorrected pair-wise amino acid differences between
sequences belonging to the species HIV-1 and HIV-2,
sequences belonging to the different HIV-1 groups (M, N,
and O) and HIV-1cpz isolates, sequences belonging to the
different group M HIV-1 subtypes, and within the six most
common group M subtypes. For the six most common
group M subtypes, we also examined the number of differences from the consensus subtype sequence and examined the distribution of these differences across each of
the sequences and each of these genes.
We used an information-theoretic measure of diversity
known as Shannon's entropy [12] to quantify the amount
of amino acid variation at each position of protease, RT,
and integrase for the set of ARV-naïve sequences for which
the complete pol gene was sequenced. For each subtype,
the entropy at each position of protease, RT, and integrase
was calculated as:
k

Entropy ( X ) = −

∑ p(Ai) ⋅ log p(Ai),
i =1

for K different amino acids (A1 ... Ak) at position X where
p(Ai) is the frequency of amino acid Ai.
To assess covariation among integrase amino acids, we
analyzed sequences belonging to the six most common
group M subtypes using the Jaccard similarity coefficient
(J). For a given pair of mutations X and Y, the Jaccard similarity coefficient is calculated as J = NXY/(NXY + NX0 + N0Y)
where NXY represents the number of sequences containing
X and Y, NX0 represents the number of sequences containing X but not Y and N0Y represents the number of
sequences containing Y but not X. To test whether
observed Jaccard similarity coefficients were statistically
significant, the expected value of the Jaccard similarity
coefficients (JRAND) and its standard error (JSE) assuming
two mutations (X and Y) occur independently were calculated for each pair of mutations. JRAND was calculated as
the mean Jaccard similarity coefficient after 2,000 random
rearrangements of the X or Y vector (containing 0 or 1 for
presence or absence of a mutation). JSE was calculated
using a jack-knifed procedure, which removed one
sequence at a time, repeatedly for each sequence. The
standardized score Z, Z = (J - JRAND)/JSE, indicates a significant positive association (Z > 2.56) or a significant negative association (Z < -2.56) at an unadjusted p < 0.01 [13].
To adjust for multiple comparisons, we used a false discovery rate of 0.05 to identify correlations warranting further examination [14].

Results
Published integrase sequences
The April 15, 2008 GenBank release contained 2,736 primate lentivirus integrase sequences with 200 or more

amino acids. Twenty-nine percent of these sequences (n =
775) were excluded from analysis because they were of
poor sequence quality (n = 385), contained insufficient
annotation (n = 291), represented experimental
sequences (n = 96), or represented case reports of viruses
sequenced for phenotypic properties unrelated to integrase (n = 93). Of the remaining 1,961 sequences, 1,863
sequences belonged to HIV-1/SIVcpz, 40 sequences
belonged to HIV-2/SIVsmm/SIVmac, and 58 sequences
belonged to one of the remaining primate lentivvirus species.
The 1,863 HIV-1/SIVcpz sequences were obtained from
1,626 separate virus isolations from 1,581 individuals
including 1,563 persons with HIV-1 and 18 chimpanzees
with SIVcpz. Table 1 summarizes the taxonomic categories of the HIV-1 sequences according to the number of
distinct individuals from whom sequences were obtained.
Among 1,482 persons with group M viruses, sequences
from 1,351 were classified as belonging to subtypes A, B,
C, D, F, G, CRF01, or CRF02; whereas sequences from 131
were classified as belonging to subtypes H, J, K or one of
the other CRFs (n = 87); 44 sequences could not be adequately subtyped (n = 44). Among 1,051 group M integrase sequences in the database for which the complete
genome sequence had been published, the assigned subtype matched the subtype indicated in the primary publication for the integrase region in 1,045 (99.4%)
sequences. Of the 1,563 persons from whom HIV-1
sequences were obtained, none had received an INI. Seven
persons had received an RT and/or protease inhibitor and

in 525 persons RT and protease inhibitor treatment history was not known. A file containing the nucleotides and
GenBank accession numbers of the sequences in Table 2
is provided [see Additional file 1].
HIV-1 group M amino acid polymorphisms
Figure 1 shows the distribution of amino acid variation
among all group M integrase sequences compared with
the consensus B reference sequence. Of the 288 integrase
positions, 115 (39.9%) had at least one amino acid polymorphism present in 0.5% or more sequences including
41 (14.2%) at which two or more polymorphisms were
present. Of the 185 polymorphisms, many resulted from
highly conservative substitutions such as V↔I↔L in 32
cases, K↔R in 15 cases, A↔S↔T in 17 cases, and D↔E in
12 cases.

Table 2 summarizes the differences in the consensus
amino acid sequence for each of the eight most common
subtypes. For 33 (11.5%) of the 288 integrase positions,
two or more subtypes had different consensus amino
acids. Most of the polymorphic positions shown in Figure
1 are polymorphic in three or more subtypes [see Additional file 2]. However, at a few positions, the high level
of amino acid variability shown in Figure 1 results largely
from inter-subtype rather than intra-subtype variability.
For example, much of the variability at the highly variable

positions 112, 124, 125, 201, 234, and 283 results in part
because the consensus B amino acid differs from the consensus of most other subtypes.
Likewise, variability in just one or two subtypes can
explain some of the findings in Figure 1. For example, the
uncommon polymorphism F139Y is due solely to the
presence of this mutation in 8% of subtype A sequences.
The uncommon polymorphism V151I which appears to
be an accessory INI-resistance mutation is due solely to
the presence of this mutation in 10% of subtype B
sequences. Finally, the uncommon polymorphism
K156N, another accessory INI-resistance mutation is due
solely to the presence of this mutation in 9% of subtype B
and 5% of subtype D sequences.
HIV integrase, RT, and protease diversity
Among the 1,961 integrase sequences in Table 1, 1,367
were from isolates for which simultaneous protease and
RT sequences were also available including 1,301 HIV-1/
SIVcpz, 33 HIV-2/SIVstm and 33 NHPL isolates. For this
comparative analysis, isolates from ARV-naive individuals
of which the subtypes of the three genes are the same were
used. When there are multiple isolates available from a
same patient, only one isolate is used. Table 3 displays the
extent of protease, RT, and integrase amino acid diversity
by species, group, and subtype for these isolates. Integrase

Distribution of variants among group M HIV-1 integrase sequences
Distribution of variants among group M HIV-1 integrase sequences. The consensus subtype B sequence is shown at
the top of each 40 amino acid section. Beneath the consensus B sequence is the number of annotated sequences containing an
unambiguous amino acid at the indicated position with the number of such sequence ranging from 1183 to 1288. All variants
reported at a level of ≥ 0.5% of sequences are indicated. The central core domain residues are surrounded by grey shading.
The signature HHCC zinc-binding motif in the N-terminal domain and the DDE active site residues in the central core domain
are indicated by boxes. Positions at which primary INI-resistance mutations for raltegravir and elvitegravir have been reported
are indicated by "*". Positions at which accessory INI-resistance mutations for raltegravir and elvitegravir have been reported
are indicated by "+". Positions at which INI-resistance mutations for other inhibitors have been reported are indicated by ".".

amino acid diversity decreased from ~40% at the species
level, ~16% at the group level, to ~7% at the subtype level.
The mean intra-subtype diversity was ~5%. At all levels,
the extent of amino acid diversity was lower in integrase
than in protease and RT, although there was no mean difference in amino acid diversity between integrase and RT
between HIV-1 and HIV-2.

Among the 741 ARV-naïve HIV-1 group M isolates
belonging to the six subtypes with the most sequences (A,
B, C, D, CRF01, and CRF02), the number of differences
from the subtype consensus sequence was highly correlated between all three pairs of genes (correlation coefficient ~0.34, p < 0.001). In other words, virus isolates with
many differences from the subtype consensus in one gene

Divergence was defined as the mean proportion of amino acid difference between all sequence pairs. The number of sequences compared are

tended to have many difference from the subtype consensus in all three genes. Nonetheless, a regression model
that accounted for this factor (by using the covariance in
the number of mutations among protease, RT, and integrase and the variance within each gene) and that
accounted for the length of each gene confirmed that
there were fewer differences from the subtype consensus
in integrase compared with RT and protease.
Among the 741 ARV-naïve HIV-1 group M isolates
belonging to the six most common subtypes, the proportion of positions with ≥ 0.5% variability relative to the
consensus subtype amino acid was lower for integrase
(34.7%) compared with protease (40.0%; p < 0.001) and
RT (37.2%; p < 0.001). The mean level of Shannon's
entropy at all positions calculated using the same 741 pol
sequences was also significantly lower for integrase (0.11
± 0.23) than for RT (0.15 ± 0.31) and protease (0.16 ±
0.31) (Figure 2). For 92.7%, 89.8%, and 88.2% of integrase, RT, and protease positions across the six most common subtypes, there was an entropy level below 0.5 bits
meaning that at these positions, the correct amino acid
could be predicted with approximately 90% certainty.
Catalytic core domain (CCD)
Of the 162 amino acid catalytic core domain (CCD) residues encompassing positions 51 to 212, 108 (66%) were
nonpolymorphic (prevalence ≤ 0.5%) among group M
sequences. Based on the published crystallographic structure of the integrase CCD bound to prototype diketo acid
active site inhibitor (5CITEP) [7], a putative integrase
inhibitor binding pocket containing the active site resi-

dues and D64, C65, T66, H67, E92, D116, Q148, V151,
E152, N155, K156, and K159 has been proposed [15,16].
These residues were nonpolymorphic, with the exceptions
of the conservative mutations V151I, K156N, and K156R,
each of which occurred in 1% of sequences (Figure 1). Six
otherwise normal isolates, however, contained the active
site mutation E152K. Similar variation was not observed
at the other active site residues (D64 and D116) suggesting that D152 may be particularly prone either to
sequencing error or to RNA editing as the observed mutation could result from unhindered APOBEC3F activity.
A flexible loop region encompassing F139 to G146 and an
amphipathic alpha-helix (α4) extending from S147 to
V165 are involved in both the direct binding and correct
positioning of viral DNA to the integrase catalytic residues. The flexible loop, which is generally poorly resolved
in crystallographic structures, is completely conserved in
group M sequences with the exception of F139Y, which
occurred in 12 subtype A infected persons. The conserved
positively charged residues in the amphiphathic α4 helix
including Q148, E152, N155, and K159 are positioned to
contact negatively charged viral DNA molecules [17]. Site
directed mutagenesis studies suggest that other conserved
positively charged CCD residues including Q62 and N120
also participate in critical viral DNA binding [18].
Among the CCD mutations shown to directly reduce raltegravir or elvitegravir susceptibility – H51Y, T66I, E92Q,
F121Y, G140S, Y143C/H/R, Q146P, S147G, Q148H/R/K,
S153Y, N155H/S, and E157Q [19-21] – only positions
153 and 157 are polymorphic (prevalence ≥ 0.5%) with

S153A and E157Q each present in 1% of sequences (Figures 1). In contrast, as summarized in the next paragraph,
mutations at the remaining INI-resistance positions were
rare.
The INI-resistance mutation H51Y was present in one subtype A isolate; H51Q (n = 3) and H51P (n = 2) were
present in five isolates. T66A (n = 2) and T66S (n = 1) were
present in three subtype C isolates. T66P was present as
part of an electrophoretic mixture in one subtype B and
one subtype F isolate. E92G (n = 2), E92D (n = 1), and
E92A (n = 1) were present in four isolates. F121S (n = 2)
and F121L (n = 1) were present in three isolates. G140E
was present in one subtype G isolate. Y143H was present
in three subtype C isolates and one subtype D isolate. The
INI-resistance mutation S147G was present in one
CRF01_AE isolate and in one subtype C isolate; S147R

was present in one subtype B isolate. The INI-resistance
mutations Q148H (subtype G) and Q148K (CRF02_AG)
were each present in one isolate. The INI-resistance mutation, N155H was present in one subtype B isolate; N155D
was present in one subtype D isolate.
Among mutations selected by raltegravir or elvitegravir
that have not been shown to directly reduce susceptibility,
L74R, Q95K, E138A/K, and H183P were conserved,
whereas V54I, L68V, L74M, T97A, V151I, G163R, and
I203M were present in approximately 1% to 2% of isolates from untreated persons (Figure 1).
In a crystallographic study containing a CCD dimer and
the C-terminal LEDGF integrase-binding domain, 11
CCD residues were shown to participate in LEDGF binding: L102, T125, A128, A129, W131, W132, Q168, E170,

H171, T174, and M178 [22]. All but T125 and H171 were
nonpolymorphic in group M sequences. The side chains
of A128, A129, W131, W132, E170, T174, and M178 participated in LEDGF binding; in contrast the main chains
of the conserved position 168 and of the polymorphic
positions 125 and 171 participated in LEDGF binding.
N-terminal domain (NTD)
Of the 50 NTD residues, 25 (50%) were nonpolymorphic
among group M sequences (Figure 1). The HHCC zincbinding motif at positions 12, 16, 40, and 43 were nonpolymorphic. This motif interacts with residues 150–196
of an adjacent monomer. The interface between the NTD
and the CCD within each monomer involves the connecting residues 47 to 55 (which are poorly resolved crystallographically) and hydrophilic contacts between the NTD
side chains R20 and K34 and the CCD side chains T206,
Q209, and E212 [6]. Of these interacting residues, R20K,
K34R, and T206S occurred in 4%, 2%, and 16% of group
M sequences, respectively, whereas Q209 and E212 were
invariant among group M sequences. The polar NTD residues K14, N18, and Q44, and the polar CCD residues
K160, Q168, and K186 contribute to the dimer-dimer
interface in the tetrameric NTD-CCD crystal structure.
group M variants at these positions include K14R in 31%
of sequences and K160R/Q in 2% of sequences.
C-terminal domain (CTD)
Of the 76 CTD residues, 32 (58%) were nonpolymorphic
among group M sequences. A crystallographic structure
containing the linked CCD and CTD domains demonstrated a Y-shaped dimer in which there are two symmetrically interfacing CCDs at the base and two symmetrically
separated CTDs at the "Y" branches [5]. The residues linking the CCD to the CTD are part of an extended alpha
helix encompass residues 195 to 225 [5]. Residues 270–
288 were not delineated in the CCD-CTD crystal structure.

An electrostatic potential map identifies a strip of positively charged residues extending from the CCD active site
through K159, K186, R187, and K188 in the CCD of one
monomer towards the CTD of the other monomer [5].
Positively charged CTD residues include K215, K219,
R228, R231, K236, K244, K258, R262, R263, K266, R269,
K273, and R284. Whereas K215N/R, K219N/Q, R269K,
and R284G are reported polymorphisms, the remaining
positively charged residues were nonpolymorphic. Many
of these positively charged residues have been implicated
in DNA binding and been found to be essential to integrase function [23].
The nonpolymorphic mutation R263K has been shown to
reduce elvitegravir susceptibility by five-fold. Its effect on
raltegravir has not been reported. Y226C/D/F/H, S230N/
R, and D232N have been selected in vitro or in vivo by

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/74

raltegravir and/or elvitegravir [24,25]. Of these mutations,
S230N has been reported in 2.0% of untreated isolates.
The conservative substitution D232E has also been
observed in 2.0% of untreated isolates. R263K (n = 2) and
R263G (n = 1) were present in three isolates.
Amino acid covariation
Ninety-eight pairs of amino acids were significantly associated with one another at a false discovery rate of 0.05.
Fifty-seven pairs of amino acids were from the same subdomain (CCD – 40 pairs, NTD – 10 pairs, and CTD – 7
pairs); 41 were from different subdomains (CCD-NTD –
17 pairs, CCD-CTD – 12 pairs, and CTD-NTD – 12 pairs).
Five pairs of CCD residues were associated in two or more
subtypes. E157Q, which decreases raltegravir and elvitegravir susceptibility, was associated with K160Q/T in subtypes A, B, C, and CRF02 and with K156N in three
unrelated subtype D isolates. In contrast, the other
uncommon polymorphisms in the α4 helix including
V151I, S153A, M154I/L, I162V, G163E/K/R, and V165I
were not found to covary with each other or with other
integrase mutations.

The remaining pairs of residues that were associated in
two or more subtypes included S119R and A91T/E in subtypes B, C, and CRF02; S119G and T122I in subtypes B
and D; K219N and N222K in subtypes C and CRF02, and
T124A and S283G in subtypes A and C. 17 of the CCD
pairs involved position 119; whereas the next most commonly involved position was position 124, which was
involved in 13 pairs. Position 119, which has been associated with target site specificity [26,27], is one of the most
polymorphic residues with S, P, T, G, and R occurring in
80%, 11%, 4%, 3%, and 2% of isolates, respectively.

Discussion
The development of clinically active INIs is a remarkable
therapeutic success story. Two decades of biochemical and
biophysical studies established the fundamental mechanisms of HIV-1 integrase activity [1,3], facilitated the
development of high-throughput inhibitor screening
assays [28,29], and led to the identification of highly
active, bioavailable, and safe INIs [30-33]. Several clinical
trials have demonstrated the efficacy of these compounds
for both initial and salvage ARV therapy [34-39].
The clinically active INIs are competitive inhibitors of target DNA and indeed there is much overlap between the
sites associated with target DNA binding and INI binding
[28,40]. Several aspects of HIV-1 integration and its inhibition, however, remain poorly understood. The relative
positioning of the three separate integrase domains and
the three-dimensional structure of the active multimeric
form of the enzyme are not known. In addition, although
there is a structure of HIV-1 integrase bound to the diketo

Page 8 of 11

Retrovirology 2008, 5:74

acid structural homolog 5CITEP [7], there are no structures of integrase bound to a DNA substrate or to one of
the recent classes of INIs.
Nonetheless, there is an increasing body of literature
describing which integrase mutations are selected by INIs
in vitro and in vivo and which integrase mutations reduce
INI susceptibility. Some of these data are from studies of
the early prototype INIs such as the diketo inhibitors
S1360 and L-708,906 and the napthyridine carboxamide
inhibitor L870,810 [4,9,30,31,41,42]. However, most are
from studies of the licensed INI raltegravir or of elvitegravir, an INI in phase III clinical development including several clinical reports detailing the mutations developing in
about 150 patients experiencing virological failure while
receiving raltegravir or elvitegravir [19-21,24,33,43-50].
Several concepts of INI resistance have emerged from
these studies. First, a large number of mutations have
been selected by INIs either in vitro or in vivo (reviewed in
[9]). Second, most of mutations that directly reduce INI
susceptibility occur close to the active site residues D64,
D116, and E152 in the vicinity of the pocket to which
5CITEP binds [7,15,16,51]. Third, many mutations
appear to accessory in that they have little or no effect on
susceptibility by themselves. Fourth, for both raltegravir
and elvitegravir, virological failure has generally been
accompanied by two or more INI-resistance mutations
and decreases in susceptibility ranging from > 10-fold to >
100-fold [20,21,25,52]. Fifth, there is extensive overlap
among the integrase mutations associated with raltegravir
and elvitegravir resistance [19-21,33], as well as between
these newer INIs and the earlier generation of INIs
[9,42,53].
Our study characterized the distribution of integrase
amino acid variants among more than 1,800 group M
HIV-1 isolates from more than 1,500 INI-naïve individuals. Polymorphism rates equal or above 0.5% were found
for 34% of the CCD positions, 42% of the CTD positions,
and 49% of the NTD positions. Among 741 ARV-naïve
HIV-1 group M isolates for which complete pol sequences
were available, integrase displayed higher levels of amino
acid conservation compared with RT and protease by several measures of diversity including mean inter- and intrasubtype diversity and Shannon's entropy.
Nearly all INI-resistance mutations known to directly
reduce HIV-1 susceptibility were nonpolymorphic including H51Y, T66I, E92Q, F121Y, G140S, Y143C/H/R,
Q146P, S147G, Q148H/R/K, S153Y, N155H/S, and
R263K. Most accessory INI-resistance mutations including L74R, Q95K, E138A/K, H183P, Y226C/D/F/H, S230R,
and D232N were also nonpolymorphic. The vast majority
of integrase residues assigned specific roles such as the

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/74

CCD active site residues, the NTD zinc binding residues,
the residues involved in LEDGF/p75 binding, and the
many positively charged CTD residues were also nonpolymorphic.
In contrast, E157Q – which has been reported to be
selected by raltegravir [44] and to reduce elvitegravir susceptibility by about 3 to 6-fold [19,33] – occurred in
about 1% of untreated persons almost always in combination with the uncommon mutations K156N or K160Q. In
addition, several accessory INI-resistance mutations
including V54I, L68V, L74M, T97A, V151I, G163R,
I203M, and S230N [24,25,45,46,49,50,54] also displayed
levels of polymorphism ranging from 1% to 2%. Recent
independent surveys of isolates from smaller numbers of
INI-naïve individuals confirmed these results frequently
finding E157Q as well as L74M, T97A, V151I, and I203M
in small proportions of untreated persons [55-59].
Mutations that have been selected in vitro or in vivo primarily by earlier INI compounds such as L-708,906, S-1360,
and L-870,810 but which appear to be less essential for
raltegravir or elvitegravir resistance include the highly polymorphic mutations V72I [31], V165I [41], and V201I
[41]; the minimally polymorphic mutation M154I [30];
and the nonpolymorphic mutations T125K [31], A128T
[41], and K160D [41]. The significance of these residues
to the current generation of INIs is not yet known.
The high level of integrase sequence conservation results
from a combination of functional and structural constraints. The functional constraints result from this
enzyme's multiple functions including 3' processing,
strand transfer which requires simultaneous interactions
with both viral and host DNA, and binding to other components of the pre-integration complex including
LEDGFp75. The structural constraints include the incompletely defined interactions among the different integrase
subdomains and among the monomers that contribute to
the multimeric form of the enzyme. HIV-1 integrase also
contains a somewhat lower number of well-defined CTL
epitopes (n = 11) relative to its size compared with protease (n = 7) and RT (n = 41), which could also contribute
to its relatively higher level of sequence conservation compared with these two other enzymatic targets of ARV therapy [60].
