Abstract
Background: The mammalian neurohypophysial hormones, vasopressin and oxytocin are involved in
osmoregulation and uterine smooth muscle contraction respectively. All jawed vertebrates contain at least one
homolog each of vasopressin and oxytocin whereas jawless vertebrates contain a single neurohypophysial
hormone called vasotocin. The vasopressin homolog in non-mammalian vertebrates is vasotocin; and the oxytocin
homolog is mesotocin in non-eutherian tetrapods, mesotocin and [Phe2]mesotocin in lungfishes, and isotocin in
ray-finned fishes. The genes encoding vasopressin and oxytocin genes are closely linked in the human and rodent
genomes in a tail-to-tail orientation. In contrast, their pufferfish homologs (vasotocin and isotocin) are located on
the same strand of DNA with isotocin gene located upstream of vasotocin gene separated by five genes,
suggesting that this locus has experienced rearrangements in either mammalian or ray-finned fish lineage, or in
both lineages. The coelacanths occupy a unique phylogenetic position close to the divergence of the mammalian
and ray-finned fish lineages.
Results: We have sequenced a coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis) BAC clone encompassing the
neurohypophysial hormone genes and investigated the evolutionary history of the vertebrate neurohypophysial
hormone gene locus within a comparative genomics framework. The coelacanth contains vasotocin and
mesotocin genes like non-mammalian tetrapods. The coelacanth genes are present on the same strand of DNA
with no intervening genes, with the vasotocin gene located upstream of the mesotocin gene. Nucleotide
sequences of the second exons of the two genes are under purifying selection implying a regulatory function. We
have also analyzed the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in the genomes of opossum, chicken and Xenopus
tropicalis. The opossum contains two tandem copies of vasopressin and mesotocin genes. The vasotocin and
mesotocin genes in chicken and Xenopus, and the vasopressin and mesotocin genes in opossum are linked tail-tohead similar to their orthologs in coelacanth and unlike their homologs in human and rodents.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus has experienced independent
rearrangements in both placental mammals and teleost fishes. The coelacanth genome appears to be more stable
than mammalian and teleost fish genomes. As such, it serves as a valuable outgroup for studying the evolution of
mammalian and teleost fish genomes.

Background
The mammalian neurohypophysial hormones, vasopressin and oxytocin belong to a superfamily of structurally and functionally related nonapeptides. Vasopressin is
primarily involved in the regulation of osmotic balance
and contraction of smooth muscle cells in arteries while
oxytocin is mainly involved in parturition and lactation
[1,2]. Members of this superfamily are widespread in the
animal kingdom with hormones similar to vasopressin
and oxytocin isolated from invertebrates such as arthropods, annelids, and mollusks [3-5]. Among vertebrates,
all jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) characterized to date
contain at least one vasopressin-like hormone and one
oxytocin-like hormone. By contrast, the primitive jawless
vertebrates (the cyclostomes, represented by lampreys and
hagfishes) contain a single hormone, the vasotocin, which
is more similar to vasopressin than to oxytocin [6,7].
Vasotocin is also the vasopressin homolog in non-mammalian jawed vertebrates. However, the oxytocin
homologs are much more diverse: it is isotocin in teleost
fishes (e.g., fugu) and other ray-finned fishes (e.g., bichir),
mesotocin in non-eutherian tetrapods, and mesotocin
and [Phe2]mesotocin in lungfishes [8-10]. In cartilaginous fishes, besides oxytocin in the Pacific ratfish [11], six
homologs of oxytocin, termed aspargtocin, valitocin,
asvatocin, phasvatocin, phasitocin, and glumitocin have
been identified [12-14] (Table 1).
Molecular cloning of genes encoding neurohypophysial
hormones has shown that the nonapeptides are synthesized as part of a larger precursor molecule that is composed of a signal peptide, the nonapeptide, and a
neurophysin. The precursors of vasopressin-family hor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/93

mones and the teleost fish isotocin hormone contain an
additional molecule at the carboxyl terminal called
copeptin (Fig 1A). The presence of a single gene encoding
the vasotocin precursor in jawless vertebrates, and at least
one gene each encoding a vasopressin-family precursor
and an oxytocin-family precursor in jawed vertebrates, has
led to the suggestion that the ancestral vasotocin gene has
duplicated to give rise to vasopressin and oxytocin families of genes in jawed vertebrates. In human and rodents,
the vasopressin and oxytocin genes are closely linked in a
tail-to-tail orientation (i.e., located on the opposite
strands of DNA), with intergenic regions ranging from 3
kb (mouse) to 12 kb (human) [15-17] (Fig 1B). Despite
their close linkage, the two genes are regulated independently and are expressed in distinct populations of neurons
in the supraoptic nuclei and paraventricular nuclei of the
hypothalamus. Transgenic studies in mice and rats have
indicated that the regulatory elements that mediate neuron-specific expression of vasopressin and oxytocin genes
reside in the intergenic region of the two genes [18-20].
Interestingly, sequencing of the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in the pufferfish (Fugu rubripes) showed
that, in contrast to the tail-to-tail orientation of oxytocin
and vasopressin genes in humans and rodent, pufferfish
isotocin and vasotocin genes are located on the same
strand of DNA, with vasotocin gene located downstream
of isotocin gene, separated by five genes [21] (Fig 1B).
These differences in the organization of human and pufferfish genes raise the question of whether the vasotocin
and oxytocin homologs in the common ancestor of mammals and ray-finned fishes were linked like the human
genes or the pufferfish genes. Sequencing of neurohypophysial hormone gene loci in vertebrates phylogenetically

positioned close to the divergence of the mammalian and
ray-finned fish lineages would shed light on the organization of neurohypophysial hormone genes in the last common ancestor of these vertebrates.
The lobe-finned fishes, lungfish and coelacanth, are the
only two surviving lineages that arose between tetrapods
and ray-finned fishes. The phylogenetic relationships of
tetrapods to lungfish and coelacanth are unclear,
although phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial
sequence and nuclear protein coding sequences, and
molecular marker (indel) seem to favor lungfish as the
closest relative to tetrapods [22-26], and coelacanth as the
most basal lobe-finned fish. It would, therefore, be interesting to determine the neurohypophysial hormones
encoded by the coelacanth and the organization of neurohypophysial hormone genes in the coelacanth genome.
Coelacanths were long believed to be extinct until a live
specimen of the African coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae)
was caught off the coast of South Africa in 1938 [27]. A
second species of coelacanth, Latimeria menadoensis, was

caught more recently in Indonesia indicating that there
are at least two living species of coelacanths [28,29]. Like
cartilaginous fishes and lungfish, coelacanths store urea
and trimethylamine oxide to stay hyperosmotic to seawater [30]. In this study, we have characterized the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in the Indonesian
coelacanth by isolating and sequencing a BAC clone. In
addition, we have analyzed the neurohypophysial hormone gene loci in Xenopus tropicalis, chicken and gray
short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and investigated the evolutionary history of the vertebrate neurohypophysial hormone gene locus. Our results show that, in
contrast to vasotocin and [Phe2]mesotocin in the Australian lungfish, coelacanth contains vasotocin and mesotocin similar to non-eutherian tetrapods, and that the
arrangement of vasotocin and mesotocin genes in coelacanth is different from their homologs in both human
and pufferfish.

Results and Discussion
Coelacanth neurohypophysial hormone gene locus
By using a probe for the second exon of the coelacanth
vasotocin gene, we isolated five overlapping BAC clones.
One of the BACs, #66G11, was sequenced completely (the
sequence data reported in this paper has been submitted
to the GenBank database under accession number
EU284132). The insert of this BAC is 166 kb long and
contains both neurohypophysial hormone genes that are
flanked by Ubox5 gene in the upstream and Gnrh2 gene in
the downstream (Fig 2). The coelacanth neurohypophysial hormone genes encode vasotocin and mesotocin precursors like the non-mammalian tetrapods. It does not
encode [Phe2]mesotocin present in the Australian lungfish. The coelacanth vasotocin and mesotocin genes each
comprise three coding exons similar to the mammalian
vasopressin and oxytocin genes and the pufferfish vasotocin and isotocin genes. However, the introns of coelacanth genes are considerably larger (1.55 kb to 5.57 kb)
than their homologs in human (84 bp to 1.38 kb) and
fugu (75 bp to 747 bp) mainly due to an abundance of
repetitive sequences. Interestingly, the arrangement of
coelacanth vasotocin and mesotocin genes is different
from the arrangement of their homologs in both human
and pufferfish. They are present on the same strand of
DNA in a tail-to-head orientation with mesotocin gene
located 15.4 kb downstream of vasotocin gene (Fig 2).
Diverse SINE elements in the coelacanth
neurohypophysial hormone gene locus
Approximately 17% of the 166-kb coelacanth neurohypophysial hormone gene locus sequence is represented by
repetitive sequences, with LINEs and SINEs accounting for
7.9% and 6.9%, respectively (Fig 2). Altogether, this locus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/93

contains 18 LINE elements and 41 SINE elements. Previous studies have identified an ancient family of SINE elements in coelacanth, termed LF-SINE, which is specific to
lobe-finned fishes [31]. The coelacanth genome is estimated to contain 105 copies of these SINEs, and some of
these elements have been conserved in mammalian
genomes as 'ultraconserved elements' (sequences more
than 200 bp long and perfectly conserved in human,
mouse and rat). Another family of SINE, called
LmeSINE1, has also been identified in coelacanth [32].
Using the consensus sequence of the LmeSINEs, Nishihara et al[32], identified a novel family of SINEs which is
widespread in the human and chicken genomes but
absent in the coelacanth sequences that were available in
the public domain. This family has been designated amniote-specific SINE1 or AmnSINE1 [32]. The SINE elements
in the coelacanth neurohypophysial hormone gene locus
include not only LF-SINEs and LmeSINE1s, but also two
instances of AmnSINE1s (Fig 2, Additional file 1). The
presence of AmnSINE1 in the coelacanth indicates that
these elements are not specific to amniotes and are more
ancient than previously thought.
Coelacanth vasotocin and mesotocin precursors
The coelacanth vasotocin gene encodes a 162-amino acid
protein comprising a signal peptide, vasotocin, a neurophysin and a copeptin moiety (Fig 3). Vasotocin is linked
to the neurophysin by a tripeptide sequence Gly-Lys-Arg
which serves as a signal for proteolytic processing and carboxyl-terminal amidation of vasotocin (Fig 3). The two
arginine residues at the end of the neurophysin (Figs 3
and 4A) are likely to serve as a processing signal between
the neurophysin and the copeptin. All the cysteine residues that are considered important for the conformation

of neurophysin are conserved in the coelacanth vasotocin
neurophysin (Figs 3 and 4A). The copeptin includes a leucine-rich core segment like the copeptin of vasopressinfamily precursors in other vertebrates, and an N-linked
glycosylation site that is conserved in tetrapods, Australian lungfish and dogfish but absent in teleost fishes (Fig
4A).
The coelacanth mesotocin gene encodes a shorter protein
of 124 amino acids comprising a signal peptide and mesotocin which is linked to a neurophysin by the tripeptide
signal sequence, Gly-Lys-Arg (Fig 3). Like its homolog in
the dogfish, Australian lungfish, toad and mammals, the
coelacanth mesotocin precursor lacks a copeptin (Fig 4B).
Thus, the teleost fish isotocin precursor is the only oxytocin-family precursor that contains a copeptin (Fig 4B).
However, it should be noted that the teleost fish isotocin
precursor does not contain an arginine residue between
the neurophysin and the copeptin (Fig 4B), and consequently the copeptin moiety is not cleaved from the neurophysin molecule [33].
Second exons of coelacanth vasotocin and mesotocin
genes are under purifying selection
The second exons of the coelacanth vasotocin and mesotocin genes, which encode the central region of the neurophysin, exhibit an unusually high degree of identity at the
amino acid (97.1%) as well as nucleotide level (98.0%).
In fact, a stretch of 181 bp is perfectly conserved in the two
genes (Fig 3). Previously, a similarly high level of nucleotide identity (197 bp perfectly identical) has been
reported between the second exons of the bovine vasopressin and oxytocin genes [34]. In these genes, the high
level of sequence identity extends into 135 bp of the preceding intron. This observation led to the suggestion that
the two genes have experienced a recent gene conversion
event [34]. We calculated the sequence identity between
the second exons of vasopressin and oxytocin family
genes from various vertebrates and found that they all
exhibit a high identity (human, 92.5%; mouse, 95.5%;

rat, 95%; bovine, 96.5%; chicken, 71.7%; opossum,
81.2%; Xenopus, 67.3% and fugu, 86.3%). However,
besides the bovine genes, the high level of sequence identity extends into the preceding intron only in human
genes (up to 28 bp) [34]. In coelacanth, the high level of
sequence identity does not extend into the flanking
introns (Fig 3), which suggests that, if coelacanth genes
have indeed experienced gene conversion, it is restricted
to the coding sequence. Gene conversion between coding
regions of paralogous genes generally results in a high GC
content at the third position (GC3) of codons [35-37]. To
determine whether the coelacanth exons have experienced
gene conversion, we calculated the GC3 content of all the
three exons of the coelacanth vasotocin and mesotocin
genes and compared them with GC3 content in bovine
and human vasopressin and oxytocin genes. In the bovine
and human genes, the GC3 content of the second exon is
exceptionally high (94% to 95.5%). However, the GC3
content of their flanking exons is also high (87.5% to
98.2%) (Table 2), which indicates that either all three
exons have experienced gene conversion or that these
genes are located in a GC rich region of the genome. In the
coelacanth vasotocin and mesotocin genes, the GC3 content of the second exons is rather low (41%) and comparable to that of the first and third exons (40% to 53%)
(Table 2) which do not show a high level of sequence
identity. Thus, the second exons of the coelacanth vasotocin and mesotocin genes do not seem to have experienced gene conversion. Alternatively, the high level of
sequence identity could be the result of purifying selection
acting on the nucleotide sequences of the second exons.
Since the third positions of codons are also under constraint, it is possible that besides coding for amino acids,
these exons may harbor sequences related to the stability
of transcripts, microRNA targets [38] or regulatory elements such as exonic splicing enhancers [39] that require
conservation at the nucleotide level.
Evolutionary history of vertebrate neurohypophysial
hormone gene locus
To trace the evolutionary history of the neurohypophysial
hormone gene locus, we analyzed vasotocin and mesotocin gene loci in the genome assembly of Xenopus tropicalis. The Xenopus genes for vasotocin and mesotocin are
present on scaffold_205, which is ~1.85 Mb long. Their
exon-intron organization is identical to that of their
homologs in coelacanth, pufferfish and mammals (Additional files 2 and 3), and as expected, the precursors
encoded by them are most similar to their orthologs in the
toad and coelacanth (Fig 4). The Xenopus vasotocin and
mesotocin genes are linked tail-to-head and flanked by
UBox5 gene in the 5' region and Gnrh2 gene in the 3'
region similar to their orthologs in coelacanth. Thus, the
order and orientation of genes in this locus are highly conserved in Xenopus and coelacanth (Fig 5). The Xenopus

neurohypophysial hormone gene locus is compact (~80
kb) compared to the coelacanth locus (~170 kb) mainly
due to a paucity of repetitive sequences in the Xenopus
locus. The conserved tail-to-head orientation of vasotocin
and mesotocin genes in coelacanth and Xenopus indicate
that the inverted orientation of oxytocin gene in human
and rodents is the result of inversion of this gene in the
tetrapod lineage after the divergence of amphibians. To
determine more precisely when the inversion occurred,
we analyzed neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in
the genome assemblies of chicken and opossum. The
vasotocin and mesotocin genes in the chicken genome are
arranged similar to their orthologs in coelacanth and
Xenopus. The opossum genome encodes vasopressin precursor similar to human and rodents but mesotocin pre-

cursor like non-eutherian tetrapods. Furthermore, it
contains two copies of vasopressin and mesotocin genes
due to a tandem segmental duplication, and one duplicated copy of the vasopressin gene codes for [Lys8]vasopressin precursor (Fig 5). Nevertheless, the two copies of
the vasopressin and mesotocin genes are linked tail-tohead similar to their homologs in Xenopus and coelacanth.
Thus, the inverted orientation of oxytocin gene in human
and rodent is the result of a recent inversion event in placental mammals after they diverged from the marsupial
lineage.

are arranged similar to their orthologs in fugu and separated by four genes (Fig 5). Furthermore, the Tetraodon
Gnrh2 and Ptpra genes whose orthologs are closely linked
to mesotocin or oxytocin genes in tetrapods are located on
a different chromosome in Tetraodon and most likely in
fugu (Fig 5). Thus, the neurohypophysial hormone gene
loci in pufferfishes appear to have experienced multiple
rearrangements. As such, the arrangement of isotocin and
vasotocin genes in pufferfishes is unlikely to represent the
arrangement of their homologs in the last common ancestor of ray-finned fishes and lobe-finned fishes. The two
neurohypophysial hormone genes in the common ancestor were more likely to have been linked closely in a tailto-head orientation similar to their homologs in coelacanth, Xenopus, chicken and opossum. Sequencing of
neurohypophysial hormone gene loci in cartilaginous
fishes should confirm this hypothesis.

Evolution of vasopressin and oxytocin families of
hormones
The evolution of vasopressin and oxytocin family hormones is a classical example of the origin of a novel gene
by the duplication of a gene. While vasopressin family
peptides are basic peptides, the oxytocin family peptides
are neutral peptides. These distinct chemical properties
are conferred by the eighth residue of the nonapeptide
which is Arg or Lys in vasopressin family, and Leu, Ile, Gln
or Val in oxytocin family (Table 1). Following the duplication of the ancestral vasotocin gene, one copy has been
conserved to encode the basic peptide, while the other
copy has diverged to give rise to the novel neutral peptides
of the oxytocin family (Fig 6). The identification of vasotocin gene in coelacanth and vasopressin gene in opossum indicates that vasotocin is highly conserved during
evolution of vertebrates from cyclostomes to birds, and is
replaced by vasopressin in mammals (Fig 6). The evoluI

tionary stability of vasotocin in non-mammalian vertebrates probably reflects its fundamental role in
maintaining osmotic balance in these vertebrates. In contrast to the highly conserved vasotocin in non-mammalian vertebrates, oxytocin family hormone exhibits wide
diversity in these vertebrates. The most basal jawed vertebrates, the cartilaginous fishes, contain seven different
types of oxytocin-like hormones, which suggests a relaxed
pressure on this family of hormone owing presumably to
the redundancy of the second hormone following the
duplication of the ancestral vasotocin gene (Fig 6). While
the ray-finned fishes contain isotocin, mesotocin is conserved in coelacanth, lungfish, and non-eutherian tetrapods. The Australian lungfish appears to be unique in
possessing [Phe2]mesotocin. It is interesting that although
ray-finned fishes are the largest and most diverse group of
vertebrates, they posses only isotocin in contrast to cartilaginous fishes which contain seven different forms of
oxytocin-like hormone. The presence of only isotocin in
ray-finned fishes reflects a selective pressure on this hormone in this largest group of vertebrates.

(accession number BAA24026) vasotocin precursors, was
effective in amplifying a genomic fragment of the
expected size (~160 bp). The PCR cycling conditions used
consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95Â°C for 2
min, followed by 35 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 sec, 50Â°C for 1
min and 72Â°C for 30 sec, with a final elongation step at
72Â°C for 5 min. The PCR product was cloned into a T-vector and sequenced. BLASTX search of the sequence indicated that it is highly similar to neurophysin molecule of
the vasotocin precursor cloned from other vertebrates.
The sequence of the PCR fragment was extended by
inverse PCR using libraries of circularized DNA as
described before [40]. The extended sequence, a 2.8 kb
XmnI fragment, includes the complete second exon and
partial sequences for the flanking introns.

Methods

Isolation and sequencing of BAC
A 283-bp PCR product (amplified using the primers 5'CTG CAG TGT ATC CCA TGT GGT TCT GG-3' and 5'-GTA
TCG CCC AAT CAC TAG-3') that includes the complete
second exon and 72 bp of the succeeding intron was used
to screen an Indonesian coelacanth BAC library [41], and
five positive BAC clones (66G11, 72J19, 117H6, 159M19,
and 252B6) were identified. Restriction fragment analysis
indicated that the five BACs belong to the same locus.
Since the probe used codes for the central portion of the
neurophysin which is conserved across species as well as
between vasopressin and oxytocin-like precursors, we
believe that this is the only neurohypophysial hormone
gene locus in coelacanth. One of the positive BAC clones,
clone #66G11, was sequenced completely using the shotgun sequencing strategy. In brief, the shotgun sequencing
strategy involved shearing of BAC DNA by ultrasonication
followed by end-filling by Klenow treatment, and separation of the fragments on a 1% agarose gel. Fragments in
the range of 2â3 kb were then extracted from the gel and
subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK vector.
The plasmid inserts were sequenced using standard
BigDye Terminator v3.1 chemistry on an ABI 3730xl DNA
analyzer. Shotgun reads were assembled with SeqBuilder
(Lasergene 6 software package, DNASTAR) and gaps were
filled by 'primer-walking' using BAC DNA as a template or
by sequencing PCR products.

PCR amplification of coelacanth vasotocin fragment
The amino acid sequences of vasotocin precursors from
various vertebrates were aligned using ClustalX and several pairs of degenerate PCR primers were designed to
amplify a fragment of vasotocin gene from coelacanth.
Genomic DNA of the Indonesian coelacanth extracted
from the gill tissue [40] was used as a template. The
primer-pair, 5'-GGN CCN WAY ATH TGY TGY GG-3' and
5'-CAN AYN CCN GGN GCN GCR CA-3', corresponding
to the conserved sequences in the neurophysin region
(GPN/YICCG and CAAPGV/IC) of the Japanese toad
(accession number P08163) and the Australian lungfish

Sequence analysis
Protein coding genes were predicted based on homology
to known proteins in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information database [42] and their exon-intron
boundaries were refined by manual inspection. Multiple
sequence alignments of protein sequences were carried
out with ClustalX Version 1.83 [43]. Repetitive sequences
were identified using the RepeatMasker (version open3.1.6)[44]. The genomic sequences of the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus for human (March 2006 assembly), Xenopus tropicalis (assembly version 4.1), chicken

Conclusion
We have sequenced neurohypophysial hormone genes
from coelacanth and shown that coelacanth contains
vasotocin and mesotocin like the non-eutherian tetrapods. We also show that the coelacanth vasotocin and mesotocin genes, and their homologs in Xenopus, chicken and
opossum are linked in tandem in a tail-to-head orientation unlike the tail-to-tail orientation of their homologs
in placental mammals, and tail-to-head orientation of isotocin and vasotocin genes in pufferfishes. These results
indicate that the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus
has undergone independent rearrangements in placental
mammals and teleost fishes. The analysis of the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus has shown that the coelacanth genome is likely to be more stable than that of rayfinned fishes and mammals. This underscores the importance of coelacanth as a valuable outgroup for tracing evolutionary changes in the tetrapod and ray-finned fish
lineages.
