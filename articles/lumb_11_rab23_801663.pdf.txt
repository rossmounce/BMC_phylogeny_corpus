Rab23 is a flagellar protein in Trypanosoma brucei
Jennifer H Lumb and Mark C Field*

Abstract
Background: Rab small GTPases are important mediators of membrane transport, and orthologues frequently
retain similar locations and functions, even between highly divergent taxa. In metazoan organisms Rab23 is an
important negative regulator of Sonic hedgehog signaling and is crucial for correct development and
differentiation of cellular lineages by virtue of an involvement in ciliary recycling. Previously, we reported that
Trypanosoma brucei Rab23 localized to the nuclear envelope [1], which is clearly inconsistent with the mammalian
location and function. As T. brucei is unicellular the potential that Rab23 has no role in cell signaling was possible.
Here we sought to further investigate the role(s) of Rab23 in T. brucei to determine if Rab23 was an example of a
Rab protein with divergent function in distinct taxa.
Methods/major findings: The taxonomic distribution of Rab23 was examined and compared with the presence of
flagella/cilia in representative taxa. Despite evidence for considerable secondary loss, we found a clear correlation
between a conventional flagellar structure and the presence of a Rab23 orthologue in the genome. By epitopetagging, Rab23 was localized and found to be present at the flagellum throughout the cell cycle. However, RNAi
knockdown did not result in a flagellar defect, suggesting that Rab23 is not required for construction or
maintenance of the flagellum.
Conclusions: The location of Rab23 at the flagellum is conserved between mammals and trypanosomes and the
Rab23 gene is restricted to flagellated organisms. These data may suggest the presence of a Rab23-mediated
signaling mechanism in trypanosomes.

Introduction
Rab proteins are important control elements of vesicle
transport and related functions [2]. In African trypanosomes there are sixteen Rab-like proteins with various
roles in exocytosis, endocytosis and possibly differentiation/life cycle progression [3-5]. Essentially members of
the family have similar locations and functions to their
mammalian or fungal orthologues where such orthologous relationships exist [4,6].
In contrast, amongst the Trypanosoma brucei Rab
repertoire is Rab23 (TbRab23), which was localized to
the inner nuclear envelope using polyclonal antibodies
[1]. Significantly, mammalian Rab23 was first recognized
in a murine model through genetic interactions with
Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a protein crucial to development
and differentiation of cell lineages [7,8]. Mammalian
Rab23 localizes to the plasma membrane, endosomes,

and cytosol and functions as a negative regulator of Shh
[9-11].
The Shh pathway is metazoan-specific and essential
for growth and organ patterning [12,13]. Several components of the pathway localize to primary cilia and intraflagellar transport (IFT) is required for Shh signaling
[14-18]. Recent data indicate that Rab23 is essential for
ciliogenesis, localizes to cilia in MDCK cells and functions to recycle the Shh pathway receptor, Smoothened
(Smo), from the ciliary compartment [19,20].
As Shh signaling is restricted to metazoa, this raises
intriguing questions about the possible function of
TbRab23 in T. brucei and other non-metazoan organisms and may point towards a divergent function. Given
that no Rab protein has been associated with the
nucleus in any organism since our earlier publication,
and accumulation of evidence for a role of Rab23 at the
mammalian flagellum, we sought to re-examine the
location of Rab23 in trypanosomes and its phylogenetic
relationship with the presence of a flagellum. Using

epitope-tagged chimeras of TbRab23 to avoid issues
with antisera cross-reactivity, we now find that TbRab23
is associated with the flagellum, and not the nucleus as
previously reported [1]. Further, Rab23 is only found in
flagellated taxa. Importantly our data are consistent with
the studies in mammalian cells and indicates that the
function of Rab23 is likely conserved across the
eukaryotes.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Bioinformatics

Genomes were chosen for sampling based on three main
criteria: i) proposed position in the evolutionary tree of
eukaryotes [21] ensuring adequate representation of
major supergroups, ii) completeness of the sequenced
genome, and iii) the availability of a carefully annotated
protein database. BLAST searches were conducted initially using TbRab23 (Tb10.6k15.1990), TbRab28
(Tb927.6.3040), TbRab7 (Tb09.211.2330), HsRab23
(NP_057361.3), and HsRab28 (CAA64364.1) as queries
[22]. As GTPases are very highly conserved, e values of
less than e-20 were used as an initial cutoff. The top two
hits were then reciprocally used as queries for a BLAST
search against T. brucei and Homo sapiens sequence
databases. Only those that retrieved the query sequence
were assigned as candidate orthologues. If no clear
orthologue was identified, additional searches were performed using protein sequences from closely related
species. In cases where the retrieved sequence was a
named orthologue of the query, reciprocal BLAST
searches were not performed. The Rab5 dataset was
kindly provided by Dr. Joel Dacks, University of Calgary.
Initial protein sequence alignments were produced in
Clustal × [23] on the ODIN server at the University of
Calgary, and manually edited in MacClade [24]. Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed by analyzing the
alignment using ProtTest (V1.3) [25] to select the appropriate model of sequence evolution, and then MrBayes
(V3.2) run locally for 10 6 generations and PhyML at
http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml (100 pseudoreplicates) under WAG+I+G substitution model [26].
2.2. Cell lines and cell culture

Trypanosoma brucei brucei bloodstream form (BSF) and
procyclic form (PCF) Lister 427 strains were maintained
in HMI-9 and SDM79 medium respectively supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), L-glutamine and
penicillin/streptomycin as described previously [27]. Single Marker BSF (SMB) cells [28] were cultured in HMI9 with the addition of geneticin to a final concentration
of 2.5 μg/ml. Tetracycline-responsive PTT PCF [29]
were cultured with the addition of hygromycin and
geneticin, each to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml.
Cells in exponential growth phase ( < 1 × 106/ml and 3-

Page 2 of 11

8 × 10 6 cells/ml for BSF and PCF cells respectively)
were used in all experiments.
2.3. Generation of transgenic parasites

Primers were designed and verified for specificity using
RNAit [30] to amplify a fragment of the TbRab23 ORF
from BSF and PCF genomic DNA (BSF: ForCGCTCTCGAGGAGGTGGGTTAAACGGAGTG, revGCTAGGATCCCGCTCGGTCCACATTC; PCF: ForGCATGGATCCAAGAGCGTTTGCCTCCGTCA, revGCTTAAGCTTCCGCTCCACCAGATTTCGAT). The
fragments were cloned into the tetracycline-inducible
p2T7TABlue or the p2T7177 plasmid for RNAi in BSF and
PCF respectively. An AMAXA Nucleofector ® II was
used following the manufacturer’s protocol as described
previously [31] to transfect tetracycline-responsive SMB
cells with NotI-digested plasmid. Single clones were
selected and maintained in the presence of 5 μg/ml
hygromycin and 2.5 μg/ml geneticin. PTT PCF stable
cell lines were generated in cytomix (pH 7.6 2 mM
EGTA, 120 mM KCl, 0.15 mM CaCl2, pH 7.6 10 mM
K 2 HPO 4 /KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.6 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM
MgCl 2 .6H 2 O, 0.5% Dextrose, 100 μg/ml BSA, 1 mM
Hypoxanthine) containing 20 μg linearized DNA using a
Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II set to 1.5 kv and a capacitance
of 25 μF. Single clones were selected by serial dilution
in medium containing 20% FCS, 25 μg/ml hygromycin,
25 μg/ml geneticin, and 3 μg/ml phleomycin.
For ectopic expression, TbRab23 was amplified from
genomic DNA (For: CGGAAGCTTCGTTGAAGAGAGGTGGGTTAAAC, rev: GCTACGGGATCCCTACATAACACTGCACTTTTTCTTC). The PCR product
was cloned into either pHD1034 or pXS219 containing an
N-terminal HA- or YFP-epitope, for expression in BSF
and PCF cells respectively. WT SMB cells or SMB cells
containing the pT7TABlue-TbRab23 plasmid were transfected with 5 μg of linearized pHD1034-TbRab23. SMB
pHD1034-TbRab23 single clones were selected and maintained in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml geneticin and 0.2 μg/
ml puromycin, SMB cells transgenic for both TbRab23
RNAi and expression were selected and maintained as
above with the addition of 5 μg/ml hygromycin. Twenty
micrograms of linearized pXS219-TbRab23 was used to
transfect WT PTT cells or PTT p2T7177-TbRab23 cells.
PTT pXS219-TbRab23 single clones were selected in medium containing 25 μg/ml hygromycin, 25 μg/ml geneticin,
and 1.5 μg/ml puromycin. PTT cells transgenic for both
TbRab23 RNAi and expression were selected and maintained as above with the addition of 3 μg/ml phleomycin.
2.4. Assessment of RNA interference (RNAi) on
proliferation

RNAi was induced in log-phase parasites by the addition
of tetracycline at 1 μg/ml. Silencing of the target was

Lumb and Field BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:190
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/190

monitored by Western blotting on cell lines expressing
epitope-tagged TbRab23. BSF proliferation curves were
performed in triplicate by inoculating cultures at 1 ×
104 cells/ml each day in fresh medium with antibiotics.
Cell densities were determined using a Coulter Z1
Counter (Beckman). PCF proliferation curves were performed in triplicate by inoculating cultures at 5 × 105
cells/ml every two days in fresh medium with
antibiotics.
2.5. Western blot analysis

Cells were harvested at 800 g for 10 minutes and
washed twice in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) (Sigma). 107 cells were heated in 2× SDS-PAGE
loading buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% v/v glycerol, 0.2% v/v b-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% w/v bromophenol blue, 4% w/v SDS) for 5 minutes at 94°C. 107 cells
per lane were loaded and resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE.
Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes
were blocked and processed following standard procedures. Polyclonal anti-TbBiP serum (a kind gift from J.
D. Bangs, University of Wisconsin) was used at 1:20000,
polyclonal anti-GFP (a gift from M. Rout, Rockefeller
University) 1:10000, polyclonal anti-TbRab11 1:1000,
monoclonal anti-PFR (L8C4, a gift from K. Gull, University of Oxford) 1:1000, monoclonal anti-b tubulin (Chemicon) 1:10000, TbRab23 peptide sera 1:1000, and
monoclonal anti-HA (Roche) 1:5000. Incubations with
the appropriate commercial secondary anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugates (Sigma) were performed at 1:20000 in 1x Tris-buffered saline (with 0.1%
tween 20) for 45 minutes. Detection was by chemiluminescence with luminol (Sigma) on BioMaxMR film
(Kodak).
2.6. Subcellular fractionation

Flagella isolation was performed as previously described
[32]. Briefly, 1 × 108 cells were lysed in PMN buffer (10
mM NaPO 4 , pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 ,
mini-complete, EDTA-free, protein inhibitor tablets
(Roche), 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v)) and subpellicular
microtubules depolymerized by treatment with PMN
buffer supplemented with 1 M sodium chloride. Flagella
were isolated by centrifugation at 16000 g for 10 minutes. Supernatant fractions were concentrated by TCA
precipitation using standard procedures and each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.
Whole cell equivalents were loaded. All centrifugation
and incubation steps were carried out at 4°C.
2.7. Quantitative real time RT-PCR

1 × 108 BSF and 5 × 107 PCF cells were harvested at
800 g for 10 minutes at 4°C and total RNA extracted

using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was generated from
2 μg RNA using a SuperscriptTM II RNaseH reverse
transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR was
performed using iQ-SYBRGreen Supermix on a Mini
Opticon Real-time PCR Detection System (BioRad) and
quantified using Opticon3 software (BioRad). b-tubulin
is expressed at similar levels between BSF and PCF cells
[33] and used to normalize RNA input. A melting curve
and gel electrophoresis was performed on amplified products to ensure amplification of the desired fragment.
The following primers were used: TbRab23 F-AGT
GGCTGAAGAGGTGGAGA, TbRab23 R-CACAT
TGCTGCCACGTACTC, b-tubulin F-CAAGATGGC
TGTCACCTTCA and b-tubulin R-GCCAGTGTAC
CAGTGCAAGA.
2.8. Indirect Immunofluorescence

Cells were grown to log phase, fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS on ice and adhered to poly-L-lysine
slides. Cells were permeabilized by incubating in 0.1%
(v/v) Triton-X-100, washed and blocked in 20% v/v foetal calf serum. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour and washed. Secondary antibodies
were applied at 1:1000 for 1 hour at ambient temperature. Slides were mounted with Vectashield containing
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to stain DNA
(Vectalabs) and visualized on a Nikon Eclipse E600 epifluorescence microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu CCD
digital camera. Image acquisition was performed with
Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) and processing with Photoshop (Adobe). All images were taken
under non-saturating conditions. All quantitation was
done using identical exposures as appropriate and using
the raw data within Metamorph. Subsequent image processing was performed for presentation purposes with
Photoshop; representative images are shown. Antibodies
were used at the following dilutions: TbPFR (L8C4)
1:50, FAZ (L3B2, a gift from K. Gull) 1:5, anti-HA
1:2000, and anti-GFP 1:2500. Isolated flagella were prepared for immunofluorescence analysis in solution,
omitting the permeabilization step, and were spotted
onto slides after the staining protocol was complete.
2.9. Immunogold electron microscopy

1x108 BSF parasites expressing TbRab23YFP were harvested by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 800 g and
washed with saline (0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0, 0.98% sodium
chloride). Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and
0.05% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PIPES for 1 hour. After 3
washes in 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0, the cell pellet was infiltrated overnight in 2.3 M sucrose (in PBS) at 4°C. Specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen and 65 nm
ultrathin cryosections cut on a Leica UCT

Lumb and Field BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:190

ultramicrotome with EM FCS cryoattachment. Sections
were mounted on grids with formvar support, blocked
with 2 mM glycine (in PBS) followed by 10%FCS (in
PBS). Anti-GFP antibody was applied for 1 hour, and
the samples washed three times in PBS (5 minutes
each). 15 nm Protein A gold was then applied for 30
minutes followed by three rinses in PBS. Six further
washes were performed in dH2O over a 5-minute period
and specimens were prepared for visualization by applying uranyl acetate in methylcellulose on ice for 10 minutes. Sections were viewed using a Philips CM100
electron microscope (FEI-Philips) operated at 80 Kv.

3. Results
3.1. Evolutionary history of Rab23

Previous studies suggested that Rab23 is monophyletic,
but this was based on limited taxon sampling [1].
Another study explored the evolutionary history of
Rab23 in more detail, but restricted their sampling to
opisthokonts [10]. Thus the full representation of Rab23
across eukaryotes remains unknown. We used comparative genomics to gather Rab23 orthologues, choosing
genomes for inclusion based on their taxonomic position to ensure adequate representation of the major
supergroups sensu Adl [21,34]. Rab23 orthologues are
present in a diverse range of taxa encompassing all
supergroups except the Amoebozoa, suggesting a fundamental role in eukaryotic cells (Figure 1A). Homologues
of Rab23 were also absent from fungi and no paralogous
expansion was observed for any of the genomes analyzed. The absence of Rab23 is most likely indicative of
secondary loss. Protozoan and opisthokont Rab23 orthologues differ greatly within the C-terminal hypervariable
domain (Additional file 1), a region implicated in targeting of Rab proteins to specific organelles and conferring
some functional specificity [35,36]. This may suggest differences in the location and function of Rab23 between
divergent species, in contrast to the majority of Rab proteins [6].
As mammalian Rab23 has some function at the endosome [37], the relationship between Rab23 and other
major endocytic Rab proteins, Rab5, Rab7 and Rab28
(Lumb et al., 2011, submitted) was investigated. Phylogenetic reconstruction of Rab23 unequivocally demonstrated that Rab23 is monophyletic with high statistical
support and consistent with previous reconstructions
(Figure 1B) [1,10,38]. Furthermore, correlation between
the presence of a Rab23 gene and possession of a motile
flagellum was found (Figure 1C). Out of 26 species

Page 4 of 11

sampled, 15 have motile flagella, and, bar Giardia lamblia and Plasmodium falciparum both of which have
non-canonical flagella, all possess a Rab23 homologue.
Rab23 orthologues were not found in any of the non-flagelated organisms, suggesting that Rab23 has flagellumassociated functions, supported by the finding that
dominant negative forms of Rab23 prevent primary cilia
formation in mammalian cells [19].
3.2. TbRab23 mRNA is constitutively expressed

To investigate expression of the TbRab23 gene, triplicate
RNA extractions were performed on BSF and PCF cells
and these were subjected to quantitative real time PCR.
TbRab23 transcripts are present at levels approximately
300-fold lower than b-tubulin in BSF cells, indicating
that TbRab23 protein expression levels are also likely to
be very low. No discernible difference in TbRab23
expression was noted between the two life stages (Figure
2A) in agreement with protein expression and microarray data [1,31].
3.3. Location of TbRab23

Given the increasing evidence for flagellar-associated
functions for mammalian Rab23 and the evolutionary
correlation between Rab23 and motile flagella, we
sought to re-examine the location of TbRab23. Re-investigation of both the original antisera and a new antipeptide sera suggested significant issues with specificity
(data not shown and Additional file 2). For example, we
observed high molecular weight cross-reacting bands in
blots using the original antisera, which may represent
detection of highly repetitive polypeptides at the nuclear
envelope [39], and the peptide sera did not recognise
endogenous TbRab23 by Western blot or IF. Given the
low level of expression of TbRab23 as a confounding
factor and questionable specificity of antisera, we chose
an independent strategy to re-examine TbRab23
location.
Production of ectopic TbRab23HA (27 kDa) and
TbRab23YFP (51 kDa) proteins of the correct molecular
weight were verified by Western blotting (Figure 2B).
The location of epitope-tagged TbRab23 was followed
throughout the trypanosome cell cycle. Using an antiGFP antibody, TbRab23YFP was localized to the cell
body, an elongated structure and a punctate feature
adjacent to the kinetoplast (Figure 2D, left panel). The
positioning and replication of these two structures
matched that of the trypanosome flagellum and basal
bodies respectively. As the cell cycle proceeded,
increased staining of the cell body was observed. Quantitation of fluorescence levels revealed that mitotic cells
possess double the amount of TbRab23YFP protein
compared to post-mitotic cells, consistent with flagellar
replication (Figure 2C). The location of TbRab23HA

Figure 1 Rab23 is monophyletic and restricted to organisms with conventional flagella. (A) Percent identity of Rab23 homologues. Tcoffee was used to produce an alignment of Rab23 sequences using default parameters. A table of percent identities was generated using the
alignment http://imed.med.ucm.es/Tools/sias.html. Species abbreviations: Hs = Homo sapiens, Xt = Xenopus tropicalis, Dm = Drosophila

major, Ng = Naegleria gruberi, Tv = Trichomonas vaginalis, Pr = Phytophthora ramorum and Tg = Toxoplasma gondii. (B) Phylogenetic
reconstruction of Rab5, Rab7, Rab23 and Rab28 families from eukaryotes in the major sampled supergroups. Rab23 robustly forms a separate
clade with Bayesian posterior probability support values greater than 0.95 denoted by a vertical bar next to the clade. Rab5 and Rab7 were
included in the analysis as outgroups and subclade support values are not shown. Rab7 was used to root the tree. Circles above nodes indicate
statistical support for MrBayes/PhyML 0.99/95 (posteriorprobability/bootstrap, respectively). Those nodes supported by both methods, but with
lower support values are written above the node. The diversity of eukaryotic supergroups within each family is illustrated by color-coded taxon
names. Species abbreviations: Hs = Homo sapiens, Xt = Xenopus tropicalis, Dm = Drosophila melanogaster, Ce = Caenorhabditis elegans, Mb =

motile flagella or with non-conventional flagellar assembly, i.e. P. falciparum and G. lamblia.

mirrored TbRab23YFP (Figure 2D, right panel). We
consider the possibility that two tags caused TbRab23 to
mislocalize to the same structures to be highly unlikely.
Furthermore, both of the vectors used generated modest
overexpression, of the order of five-fold [40]. Similar
staining has been reported for the trypanosome orthologue of IFT172 [41], which also has a role in Shh

signaling in mammals [42]. Immunofluorescence (IF)
using anti-HA and anti-GFP on untransfected cells did
not produce fluorescence signal (data not shown). In
addition, tetracycline-inducible RNA interference
(RNAi) was used to validate the specificity of the HAtag in BSF and PCF cells. Most significantly, no nuclear
staining was observed with either tagged form of

in BSF and PCF. Three separate RNA extractions were performed on WT BSF and PCF cells and were subjected to qRT-PCR. The data were
normalized for RNA input to b-tubulin and expression of TbRab23 mRNA in PCF calibrated against expression in BSF (100%). The errors bars are
the standard deviation over the three biological replicates. (B) Production of an in-frame tagged polypeptide of the correct molecular weight
was verified by Western blot on BSF expressing either TbRab23YFP or TbRab23HA. (C) Histogram detailing expression levels of TbRab23YFP in
1K1K and 2K2N cells by immunofluorescence on unprocessed images. TbRab23YFP levels were quantified using Metamorph software and
plotted graphically. The error bars denote the s.e.m (n = 20). Grey bar represents G1 (1K1N) cells and black bar mitotic (2K2N) cells. (D) Gallery of
IFA images showing expression of recombinant TbRab23 fused to an N-terminal YFP (left panel) or HA-tag (right panel) in BSF cells. Cells were
labelled with either anti-GFP or anti-HA and counterstained with Alexa-Oregon Green or Alexa-568 and 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenlindole (DAPI, blue)
for visualization of the nucleus and kinetoplast. 1K1N signifies cells in G1 phase and 2K1N, the start of nuclear S phase. Note the kinetoplast
replicates before the nucleus (2K2N). TbRab23 chimeras locate to the cell body, an extended structure that runs along the length of the cell, and
to a punctate structure that is always found in close association with the kinetoplast. During the course of cell division the TbRab23 punctum is
seen to replicate prior to kinetoplast replication. Subsequently, in 2K2N cells, a new elongated structure positive for TbRab23 is seen to emerge,
which is fully formed prior to the onset of cytokinesis. YFP stain was observed to become more diffuse during S phase. TbRab23HA locates to
the same structures as TbRab23YFP. An additional category, TboneK, denotes the point at which a kinetoplast has replicated but has not
undergone separation. All images were captured at the same exposure. For clarity, some of the images were gated to remove the cell body
signal. An ungated 1K1N cell is shown for comparison. Scale bar 2 μm.

TbRab23 or at any point in the cell cycle. Given the
small size of the HA epitope we consider it highly unlikely that this obscured a nuclear localization signal.
Furthermore, fusion of GFP adjacent to the NLS of an
authentic nuclear envelope protein, NUP-1, did not prevent correct nuclear targeting of that protein, suggesting
that the presence of a tag does not necessarily disrupt
nuclear import (data not shown).
3.4. TbRab23 is physically linked to basal bodies and their
accessory proteins

To confirm the relationship of TbRab23 with the flagellum, cells were detergent extracted to remove cell membrane
and
soluble
proteins,
followed
by
depolymerization of the subpellicular array, leaving the
flagellum cytoskeleton intact [32]. This procedure purifies the axoneme, flagellum attachment zone (FAZ), paraflagellar rod (PFR), four specialized microtubules and
the basal body from remaining cellular components.
The majority of TbRab23HA was found in the fraction
containing soluble proteins, which is common for Rab
proteins. This fraction is the sum of cytosolic TbRab23
but also active TbRab23 associated with detergent-solubilized membrane via the prenylated anchor. However, additional protein was also returned in the same fraction as
the paraflagellar rod, indicating that a subpopulation of
TbRab23HA may also associate with the flagellar cytoskeleton (Figure 3A). Importantly TbRab11, TbRab28 and the
ER chaperone TbBiP, were not associated with the flagellar
cytoskeleton. As expected, tubulin was predominantly
enriched in the cytoskeletal and flagellar fractions, and
only 2% was found in the soluble fraction, indicating the
extractions were relatively pure. Analysis of flagellar cytoskeletons by IF confirmed that only a small portion of
TbRab23 remained associated with the flagellar cytoskeleton upon detergent treatment, whereas the signal along
the length of the flagellum was abolished indicating that it
is either membrane bound or soluble (Figure 3B).
3.5. Relationship of TbRab23 with TbPFR and FAZ

To firmly corroborate the presence of TbRab23 on the trypanosome flagellum, dual labeling with antibodies against
TbPFR and the flagellum attachment zone (FAZ) were
performed. TbRab23YFP was found juxtaposed to TbPFR
on the length of the flagellum. In addition TbRab23YFP
puncta were seen to extend approximately 0.2 μm beyond
the paraflagellar rod into the cell (Figure 4A). The proximal end of the FAZ extended down to this point, but did
not extend beyond the TbRab23 foci, thus suggesting that
TbRab23 is present on basal bodies or structures tightly
coupled to basal bodies (Figure 4B). Finally, immunoelectron microscopy was performed on transgenic BSF cells
stably expressing TbRab23YFP. Cryosections revealed the
presence of gold particles on basal bodies, flagella and in

Figure 3 TbRab23 is a flagellar protein. (A) Subcellular
fractionation of trypanosomes corroborates the location of tagged
TbRab23. 1x107 BSF cells were incubated in PMN buffer to separate
flagellar, basal body and cytoskeletal-associated proteins from the
rest of the proteome (’Soluble’). 107 cell equivalents were collected
at each stage for SDS-PAGE; ‘Flagellar cytoskeleton’ denotes pellet
containing isolated axoneme, flagellum attachment zone (FAZ),
paraflagellar rod (PFR), four specialized microtubules and basal body
proteins. The majority of TbRab23HA was recovered in the first
fraction, but a small amount was also present in the same fraction
as TbPFR indicating the presence of TbRab23HA on the flagellar
cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton and flagellar cytoskeleton were
enriched in b-tubulin as expected. For presentation purposes, empty
wells have been removed from the figure and are represented by
gaps. The isolation has been performed twice with similar results.
(B) Purified flagella were processed for IF using anti-HA
counterstained with Alexa-568 revealing the presence of TbRab23 at
a structure associated with the flagellum on basal bodies. Scale bar
2 μm. IF on flagella extracted from cells expressing a late
endosomal protein TbVps26HA, did not produce a signal (data not
shown).

some cases an area posterior to the pro-basal body (Figure
4C). Overall these observations demonstrate that TbRab23
has a presence at the flagellum, as well as a soluble fraction within the cell body.
3.6. TbRab23 is not required for parasite proliferation

When the equivalent TbRab23 chimeras were expressed
in procyclic cells the localization was similar to the

Lumb and Field BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:190

bloodstream stages, suggesting that the location of
TbRab23 is conserved between developmental life forms
(Figure 5A). Subsequently, the requirement for TbRab23
in parasite proliferation was examined in BSF and PCF
cells by RNAi. TbRab23 was found to be non-essential
in BSF cells (Figure 5B, top panel). Knockdown efficiency was validated by Western blot on a TbRab23RNAi
mutant ectopically expressing TbRab23HA. Expression
of TbRab23 protein was rapidly suppressed by ~95% at
24 hours whilst TbBiP levels remained unchanged

flagellum. (A) Gallery of IF images showing TbRab23YFP and PFR in
BSF cells. Cells were stained with anti-GFP and anti-PFR and
counterstained with Alexa-Oregon Green and Alexa-568 (red). DAPI
(blue) was used to visualize DNA. Flagellum-associated TbRab23YFP
is juxtaposed to PFR. Scale bar 2 μm. Arrows demark where the PFR
emerges from the cell; TbRab23 staining extends beyond this point
towards the flagellar pocket. For clarity images have been processed
to remove cytosolic/plasma membrane staining of TbRab23.
Representative images of over 20 cells are shown. (B) TbRab23YFP is
coincident with flagella attachment zone protein (FAZ). The region
where the flagellum attaches to the cell was visualized using
antibodies raised against FAZ counterstained with Alexa-568 (red).
TbRab23YFP was indirectly imaged with anti-GFP and Alexa-Oregon
Green. DAPI (blue) was used to visualize DNA. Arrows demark
where the FAZ originates. The insets have been gated to emphasise
a pool of TbRab23YFP that is not associated with the flagellum in
relation to FAZ. The proximal end of FAZ extends to the point of
TbRab23 foci and was often found juxtaposed, but did not extend
beyond it, indicating that TbRab23 foci at the vicinity of the basal
bodies. Representative images of over 20 cells are shown. Scale bar

majority of sections analyzed (95%; n = 30), in addition to the basal
body. Particles were occasionally seen between the kinetoplast and
nucleus possibility defining an endosomal pool. ‘B’ basal body, ‘F’

expression is nonessential for proliferation of BSF and PCF
cells. (A) A PCF strain constitutively expressing HATbRab23 fused to
HA was stained with anti-HA and counterstained with Alexa-568
(red) to indirectly visualise TbRab23HA, together with DAPI to image
the nucleus and kinetoplast. The location of TbRab23 in PCF was
followed through the stages of the cell cycle, shown to the left of
the images. Scale bar 2 μm. (B) Cumulative proliferation curves of
BSF TbRab23RNAi cells (upper panel) and PCF TbRab23RNAi cells
(lower panel) grown in the presence (broken line) or absence (solid

post-induction by Western blot on RNAi cells expressing
recombinant TbRab23, shown to the right of each graph. TbBiP was
used to ensure accurate loading and specificity. “-” denotes
uninduced and “+” induced cells.

indicating that the RNAi construct was specific and very
efficient. Examination of cells throughout induction by
IF showed the transient appearance of a small population (6%) with an abnormal number of kinetoplasts and
nuclei, but these cells were rapidly lost from the population (data not shown), and no significant change to cell
cycle progression was recorded thereafter. No proliferation defect was noted in PCF cells (Figure 5B, bottom
panel). Knockdown efficiency was validated by Western
blot on a TbRab23RNAi mutant ectopically expressing
TbRab23HA revealing that recombinant protein levels
were reduced by ~90% after 24 hours of induction.

4. Discussion
Rab23 was originally descibed in metazoan cells as being
a component of a signaling pathway important to development, and this model is now well supported [7-11].
However, the wide taxonomic distribution of Rab23
amongst diverse unicellular organisms indicates a more
fundamental cellular role for this protein beyond regulation of multicellular development, and is supported, for
example, by evidence that Rab23 is not part of Shh signaling in Drosophila melanogaster [8]. Identifiable
homologues of Patched or Smo are absent from trypanosomes and a great many other taxa, making the existence of a primitive Shh-like signaling network unlikely.
Comparative genomics reveals a strong correlation
between possession of a motile flagellum and a Rab23
gene, supporting an early evolving flagellar-related
function and also suggesting evolutionary pressure to
retain Rab23 when the motile flagellum is present.
Hence Rab23 has likely been repeatedly lost throughout evolution in organisms where the motile flagellum
has been discarded, further supporting a model where
the primary function(s) of Rab23 are flagellar-associated. G. lamblia and P. falciparum, are apparent
exceptions, but both organisms possess divergent flagella; P. falciparum has lost IFT proteins and flagellum
biogenesis is fully IFT-independent, whilst in G. lamblia, flagellum biogenesis is fully or partially IFT-independent [44,45].
Epitope-tagged TbRab23 localizes to the flagellum and
cell body in BSF and PCF cells, and subcellular fractionation and immuno-gold labeling confirmed the presence of flagellar-associated TbRab23. These data
support a role for Rab23 in flagellum function in trypanosomes, consistent with the localization of mammalian
Rab23 in MDCK cells and its role in ciliary biogenesis
and protein turnover [10,19,20,37]. Clearly these data
are at variance with Dhir and Field (2004). However, the
affinity-purified antibodies generated for this study do
detect several high molecular weight antigens in trypanosome cell lysates in addition to TbRab23, indicating

Page 9 of 11

the presence of cross-reactive antibody. This is cause for
concern as many nuclear components are high molecular weight coiled-coil proteins, including NUP-1 [39].
Moreover as NUP-1 is a high abundance repetitive protein, immunostaining may have emphasized the crossreactive component of this and other nuclear envelope
antigens.
Concurrent with a potential role in flagellar function
TbRab23 exhibits features that are similar to IFT proteins. Firstly, TbRab23 extends beyond the PFR into the
cell and is likely present on the flagellar membrane, as
TbRab23 along the length of the flagellum is extractable
by detergent, similar to many trypanosome IFT proteins
[41]. Secondly, the presence of TbRab23 at the basal
body is significant, as basal body transitional fibers act
as docking sites for IFT particles [46,47] and many IFT
proteins additionally localize to this area [48]. Thirdly,
detergent extraction abolished most of the TbRab23 flagellar signal, whilst the basal body signal was retained.
Differential extractability has previously been reported
for IFT172 [41], IFT20 [49] and proteins of the BBSome
[50]. Therefore, in addition to localization, TbRab23
shares biochemical properties with proteins important
in ciliary maintenance and biogenesis. Finally, subcellular fractionation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagella
identified Rab23 in the membrane and matrix fraction,
together with IFT A and B complexes [51]. TbRab23
was not found in a trypanosome flagellum proteome
[52], presumably because flagellar membranes were
stripped before analysis. However we are unable to
unequivocally assign TbRab23 to the flagellum membrane or other flagellar subcompartment from the data
presented here.
Surprisingly, depletion of TbRab23 did not result in a
flagellar defect. This is unlikely due to inefficient suppression of protein levels, as the BSF and PCF RNAi
construct effectively eliminated recombinant TbRab23
expression at levels five to ten-fold higher than endogenous protein [10]. Rather Rab23 may not be required
for construction or maintenance of the flagellum in trypanosomes. Alternatively TbRab23 may exhibit functional redundancy with other IFT proteins or participate
in a role that is not essential for the continuation of the
cell cycle.
The data reported here indicate that trypanosome
Rab23 is associated with the flagellum, and not with the
inner nuclear envelope as previously suggested. Use of
two distinct tags, correlation between possession of a
Rab23 and a flagellum, cross-reactivity in the original
sera, plus additional evidence from mammalian cell studies argues that this is the correct assignment. Hence
these data unify the location of Rab23 across the
eukaryotes.
