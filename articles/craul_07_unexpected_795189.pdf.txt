Abstract
Background: The lemurs of Madagascar provide an excellent mammalian radiation to explore
mechanisms and processes favouring species diversity and evolution. Species diversity, in particular
of nocturnal species, increased considerably during the last decade. However, the factors
contributing to this high diversity are not well understood. We tested predictions derived from
two existing biogeographic models by exploring the genetic and morphological divergence among
populations of a widely distributed lemur genus, the sportive lemur (Lepilemur ssp.) along a 560 km
long transect from western to northern Madagascar.
Results: By using the phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA sequence data, molecular diagnostic sites
and phenotypic morphometric traits, we uncovered two previously undetected species whose
distributions contradict the two existing biogeographic models. Brief species descriptions are
provided and a new biogeographic model is proposed (the ”large river model“).
Conclusion: According to the ”large river model“, large rivers in north and northwestern
Madagascar acted as geographical barriers for gene flow and facilitated speciation events on a much
smaller spatial scale than previously thought. Thereby, this study does not only show that species
diversity in nocturnal Malagasy primates is continuously underestimated but aims to emphasize the
need for conservation actions if those species with small ranges shall not face extinction in the near
future.

Background
Malagasy lemurs constitute one of six major radiations of
extant primates [1]. Lemurs show a remarkable species
diversity, both numerically and in terms of adaptations
making them an excellent mammalian radiation to

explore mechanisms and processes underlying speciation
and evolution. During the last decade, species diversity in
lemurs increased from 33 to currently 74 [2,3]. In relation
to the small surface area of Madagascar, diversity of species within this primate radiation is quite high. Individual

lemur species tend to have small geographic ranges in
comparison to other primates. Because of such limited
geographic ranges and the high rate of deforestation, the
need for conservation action including genetic monitoring and effective management policies is particularly
urgent [2,4]. Two major models have been proposed to
explain diversity of Malagasy mammals.
The "Martin model" divided northern and northwestern
Madagascar into four biogeographical zones (circles in
Fig. 1) [5,6]. The western zone (W1) covers the area
between the two major rivers Tsiribihina and Betsiboka.
The northwestern zone 1 covers the area between the two
major rivers Betsiboka and Maevarano (NW), the northwestern zone 2 the area between the rivers Maevarano and
Mahavavy (X). The northern zone (N) covers the area
between the rivers Mahavavy and Fanambana. These riverine barriers were hypothesized to form geographical
boundaries to gene flow and consequently favour allopatric speciation. This model of speciation within Madagascar was refined [6] and it was shown that it is compatible
with a reconstruction of speciation within the families
Lemuridae, Cheirogaleidae and Indridae [7].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/83

The recent "Wilmé model" explained the process of explosive speciation on the island using a mechanistic model
[8]. Madagascar's rivers and associated watersheds with
sources at relatively low elevations suggested to be zones
of isolation that led to the evolution of locally endemic
taxa, whereas those at higher elevations were proposed to
have functioned as zones of retreat and dispersion and
contain a lower level of microendemism. Wilmé et al.
(2006) divided northern and northwestern Madagascar
into six centres of endemism (squares in Fig. 1). The western zone (zone 8) covers the area between the two major
rivers Tsiribihina and Betsiboka, corresponding to Martin's W1. One large northwestern zone, zone 9, corresponded to Martin's NW. Two smaller northwestern
zones, zone 10, between the two rivers Maevarano and
Sambirano, and zone 11 between the two rivers Sambirano and Mahavavy were suggested. In addition, two
northern zones, one (zone 12), between the river Mahavavy and the continental divide between eastern and western draining watersheds, and another (zone 1), between
the continental divide and the river Bemarivo, divided the
N-zone of Martin into two partitions.
The geographical settings in northwestern and northern
Madagascar are perfect to test if allopatric speciation of a
widely distributed lemur genus follows one of the models.
Each model predicts a different minimum number of species in this region and divergent distributions. Whereas
the "Martin model" predicts four species, the "Wilmé
model" proposes six species.
Sportive lemurs (Lepilemur spp.) are an excellent lemur
group to test these two models of mammalian distribution in Madagascar, because they occur in almost all forested regions on the island. They are cat-sized vertical
clingers and leapers with powerful hind legs. They are
nocturnal and totally arboreal. They live in dispersed pairs
and have an elaborated vocal repertoire [9-11]. Because
differences in pelage colouration and other external characteristics between species are inconspicous, their early
classification [12,13] based on morphological features
was disputed until comprehensive cytogenetic approaches
and molecular studies allowed the recognition of twelve
species [11,14-18].

The aim of this study is to test the predictions from the
models with the largest available genetic and morphological data set of a larger-sized lemur. We sequenced three
mitochondrial genes of particular diagnostic importance
for phylogeography (D-loop, Cytochrome B and NADHdehydrogenase subunit 4) of individuals captured in 14
different localities that covered a 560 km transect and the
area between eight large rivers (Inter-River-Systems, IRS)
from western to northern Madagascar. In addition, morphometric data were analysed in order to explore, to

which extent genetic differentiation coincides with morphological diversification. As in similar studies [e.g.
[19,20]] we favour the phylogenetic species concept
[21,22], where fixed molecular differences among parapatric populations indicate the existence of species barriers.

Results
Phylogenetic relationships
The 48 sequences available for the D-loop (43 own
sequences + five reference sequences), after having cut out
the hypervariable part, varied from 388 to 390 bp in
length. 128 characters were constant, 201 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative and 66 were parsimony-informative. There were 17 different haplotypes.
The 72 sequences available for the partial cytochrome B
(43 own sequences + 29 reference sequences) were 352 bp
long, with no indels. 211 characters were constant, 17 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative and 124
were parsimony-informative. There were 32 different haplotypes. The 50 sequences available for the partial ND4
(43 own sequences + seven reference sequences) varied
from 630 to 631 bp in length. 408 characters were constant, 72 variable characters were parsimony-uninformative and 153 were parsimony-informative characters.
There were 19 different haplotypes. Table 1 shows the
best-fit models for the three loci selected by the hierarchical likelihood ratio test (hLRT) implemented in Modeltest
3.5.mac. Based on the single-gene-trees, derived for the
new and reference sequences, the samples in this study
could be classified as follows: The individuals found in
IRS 0 clustered with L. aeeclis, the individuals found in IRS
I with L. edwardsi, the individuals found in IRS IV with L.
sahamalazensis, the individuals found in IRS V and VI with
L. dorsalis, the individuals found in IRS VII with L. ankaranensis, the individuals from Kirindy with L. ruficaudatus
and the individuals from Mantadia with L. mustelinus. The
individuals from IRS II and III did not cluster with any of
the reference sequences. No sampled individual clustered
with the reference sequences of L. leucopus, L. microdon, L.
randrianasoli or L. septentrionalis.

In order to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships
within the genus Lepilemur, we combined these three loci
to one concatenated sequence, 1380 bp in length. 768
characters were constant, 333 variable characters were parsimony-uninformative, and 279 were parsimony-informative. There were 21 different haplotypes. The best-fit
model selected by hLRT in Modeltest 3.5.mac was the
HKY+I+G model (Table 1). Figure 2 shows the Neighbour-Joining tree based on the concatenated sequence. All
populations within each IRS clustered together, so that
each IRS (including the populations Kirindy (West) and
Mantadia (East)) built separate terminal clades, supported by high bootstrap values (Fig. 2). The phylogram
consists of four major clades, a western, a northwestern, a
northern clade, and the clade of L. mustelinus. L. mustelinus
branched off first, followed by the western clade that consisted of IRS 0 and the individuals found in Kirindy
(West) (bootstrap values between 93 and 96). The northern clade consisted of IRS IV, V, VI and VII (bootstrap values of 100), and the northwestern clade of IRS I, II and III
(bootstrap values of 100). All so far recognized species
formed distinct terminal clades with moderate (L. ankaranensis, L. dorsalis) to large (L. mustelinus, L. ruficaudatus, L.
aeeclis) branch lengths. Branch lengths among IRS I, II and
III in the northwestern clade were in the same scale as
these between L. ankaranensis and L. dorsalis.
The absolute pairwise distances within an IRS ranged
from zero to seven characters (Fig. 3). The absolute pairwise distances among IRSs (including Kirindy (West) and
Mantadia (East)) varied from 18 to 199 characters. The
largest absolute pairwise distance (199 characters) existed
between L. aeeclis and L. mustelinus. The smallest absolute
pairwise distance (18 to 23 characters) among IRSs existed
between IRS V and IRS VI, both of them were previously
supposed to give home to L. dorsalis. The relative genetic
distance between these two IRSs can be defined as intermediate between the intra-IRS differences (0–7 bp) and
the interspecific differences (32–199 bp). This level of differentiation could indicate the presence of two subspecies
of L. dorsalis. In accordance with the deep phylogenetic

Morphometry
The means and standard deviations of all morphometric
variables for the nine phylogenetically defined species are
provided in Table 2. All variables showed significant differences for species in the ANOVA. Post-hoc tests revealed
that ear length and intraorbital distance was significantly
different in 15 of the 28 possible pairs of species and
thereby the two most distinct variables, followed by snout
length (14/28), weight (12/28), head width and lower leg

splits in the Lepilemur tree among the western, northwestern, and northern clade, absolute pairwise distances were
always largest when crossing borders among neighbouring biogeographic zones (L. aeeclis to L. edwardsi and IRS
III to L. sahamalazensis, Fig. 3). When examining the absolute pairwise distances among the IRSs within the northwestern clade, they were the same size or even larger than
between L. dorsalis and L. ankaranensis, which are accepted
species (Fig. 3).
Additional files 1, 2, 3 show the molecular diagnostic sites
for each terminal clade in each of the three genes. Recognized species had total number of one (L. dorsalis) to 73
(L. mustelinus) sites that allowed to identify them unmistakably. The two terminal clades containing the individuals of IRS II and III had a total of eleven and seven
diagnostic sites, respectively. The absolute pairwise distances as well as the analysis of the diagnostic sites indicate the presence of two new Lepilemur species in
northwestern Madagascar, one in IRS II and one in IRS III.
Consequently, the geographic range of L. edwardsi is much
smaller than previously assumed, and limited exclusively
to IRS I. By mapping each of these species with respect to
their geographical setting (IRS), it can be concluded that
all large rivers act as genetic barriers in this genus (Fig. 4).

length (10/28), tail circumference (9/28), 3rd toe length
(8/28), interorbital distance and hind foot length (6/28)
and tail length (4/28). Six variables showed tendencies
(0.05 ≤ p < 0.1) in one to two possible pairs of species. The
Post-hoc tests revealed significant differences between the
northwestern and northern clade and between the northern clade and L. mustelinus. Moreover, it could distinguish
between all neighbouring species (established and proposed), except between L. aeeclis from the western clade
and L. edwardsi from the northwestern clade (Table 2).

Hapalemur [34,35] and Propithecus [7,36]. The two new
taxa occurred in a single IRS (II and III) each. Their phylogenetic position in the tree, the genetic distances and the
number of diagnostic sites, suggest a separation at the species level. Similar conclusions were drawn with comparable approaches in other taxa [17,20,27,31,33].
Besides the molecular evidence, the discriminant function
analysis of the morphometric data further supported the
species status of the two new Lepilemur taxa (IRS II and III)
in northwestern Madagascar. Between 80% (IRS II) and
100% (IRS III) of the animals were correctly classified into
their IRS of origin. The ANOVA of the morphometric data
detected significant differences between the northwestern
and northern clade and between the northern clade and L.
mustelinus. Moreover, it could differentiate between the
neighbouring species (established and proposed) within
the northwestern and northern clade, but it could not distinguish between L. edwardsi and L. aeeclis that are geographically separated by the river Betsiboka. The
differentiation between the northwestern and northern
clade, and between the northern clade and L. mustelinus is
stronger than between the species within these major
clades. Although the lack of differentiation between the
western and northwestern clade may also partly be due to
a sample size effect, it may also suggest cryptic speciation
events in the genus Lepilemur not only within major clades
as it is known in other taxa [37-39], but also between
major clades.

The discriminant function analysis used five variables for
model calculation, ear length, snout length, lower leg
length, interorbital distance and intraorbital distance.
Two functions were computed explaining a significant
part of the morphometric variability between the six
established and two proposed species (Wilk's λ = 0.006;
F(35,120) = 8.355; p < 0.000). Table 3 shows the classification matrix, with correct classification in 82.5% of the
cross-validated cases. The differences between the classification accuracy of each species ranged from 60% to 100%.
The individuals of L. aeeclis, L. sp. nova in IRS III and L.
mustelinus were correctly classified in 100% of the cases.
The individuals of L. sp. nova in IRS II and L. ankaranensis
were correctly classified in 80%, and the individuals of L.
edwardsi, L. sahamalazensis and L. dorsalis had the smallest
percentage of correct classifications (60%). All misclassifications occurred within each major clade, indicating again
cryptic speciation within the genus Lepilemur.

The revised phylogeny of the genus Lepilemur is based on
the combination of molecular differences (genetic distances and diagnostic sites) and morphometric traits.
Diagnostic sites are also routinely used in DNA barcoding,
which is becoming an increasingly important tool in species identification [40]. Although DNA barcoding requires
a large and nearly complete database of sequences to
which individuals can be compared [41,42], the diagnostic sites we identified can be seen as first step towards such
a database in Lepilemur.

Discussion
Revised phylogeny of the genus Lepilemur
Molecular methods, such as DNA sequencing provide
powerful tools to understand diversity and phylogeny
[7,17,23-30]. This could be confirmed by our study in
sportive lemurs. The phylogenetic trees distinguished all
previously described species. Moreover, it provided evidence for two previously unknown species in northwestern Madagascar. The absolute pairwise distances between
all species were in the range of those observed in other
lemur genera such as Mirza [31], Microcebus [31-33],

Diagnosis
The sequenced mtDNA of Lepilemur otto has eleven diagnostic sites, eight in the ND4 (positions 42 = G, 57 = T,
123 = G, 255 = A, 306 = C, 630 = A, 631 = T, 632 = :C; see
additional file 2: Diagnostic sites of the ND4 region for
each terminal clade.), and three in the D-loop (positions
20 = C, 22 = A, 23 = T; see additional file 3: Diagnostic
sites of the D-loop region for each terminal clade.). L. otto
differs from its closest relative, L. edwardsi, in 2.92–2.99%
and from its sister taxon L. manasamody in 3.50–3.57% in
the sequenced mtDNA, respectively. The few morphometric data, which are available at the moment indicate that
L. otto has a significant longer snout than the neighbouring species south of the Mahajamba River, L. edwardsi. The
tail is significant short compared to the neighbouring species north of the Sofia River, L. manasamody and to L.
edwardsi. L. otto shows a tendency to have a wider head
than L. edwardsi and a bigger tail circumference than L.
manasamody.

Distribution
The known distribution range of Lepilemur otto is so far
limited to the sample site of Ambodimahabibo. This site
is situated in the IRS II, which is limited by the
Mahajamba River in the west and the Sofia River in the
north. Intensive surveys are now required in this vastly
deforested area to obtain additional information about
the location and viability of other remaining populations,
so that conservation measures can be proposed.
Etymology
The name Lepilemur otto was chosen to acknowledge the
donation of Dr. Michael Otto for the purpose of research
and conservation of Malagasy lemurs.
Vernacular name
Otto's sportive lemur or Lépilemur de Otto.

Type locality
Madagascar: Province de Mahajanga, Ambongabe
(15°19'38.3"S, 46°40'44.4"E) and Anjiamangirana I
(15°09'24.6"S, 47°44'06.2"E).

manasamody has significantly longer ears and a longer
snout, a significantly wider head and bigger intraorbital
distance and is heavier than the neighbouring species to
the north, L. sahamalazensis. It also shows a tendency to
have a smaller tail circumference than L. otto.
Distribution
The known distribution range of Lepilemur manasamody is
so far limited to the sample sites of Ambongabe and
Anjiamangirana I. Both sites are situated in the IRS III,
which is limited by the Sofia River in the south and the
Maevarano River in the north. Intensive surveys are now
required to obtain additional information about the location and viability of the remaining populations, so that
conservation measures can be proposed.

Etymology
The name Lepilemur manasamody was chosen after the forest region Manasamody, west of Anjiamangirana I
between the Sofia and Maevarano River.

Paratype
Individuals 14y03amb and 15y03amb were captured in
Ambongabe and individuals 07y03anji, 08y03anji and
09y03anji in Anjiamangirana I by M. Craul in 2003. Tissue and hair samples, morphometric measurements as
well as photographs of all paratypes are stored at the Institute of Zoology of the University of Veterinary Medicine
Hannover, Hannover, Germany.

Vernacular name
Manasamody sportive lemur or Lépilemur de Manasamody.

Description
The dorsal pelage is predominantly grey-brown, including
shoulders, the upper and lower arms. The ventral pelage is
generally grey to creamy. The face and forehead are essentially grey. From the middle of the upper skull, a dark diffuse line runs down the spine, ending in the middle of
lower part of the back. This line is never present on the
tail. The tail is grey-brown to deep brown, sometimes with
a white tail tip.
Diagnosis
The sequenced mtDNA of Lepilemur manasamody has
seven diagnostic sites, two of them in the Cytochrome B
(positions 86 = G, 140 = G; see additional file 1: Diagnostic sites of the Cytochrome B region for each terminal
clade.), three in the ND4 (positions 171 = T, 201 = G, 333
= A; see additional file 2: Diagnostic sites of the ND4
region for each terminal clade.), and two in the D-loop
(positions 75 = G, 156 = G; see additional file 3: Diagnostic sites of the D-loop region for each terminal clade.). L.
manasamody differs from its sister taxa L. otto in 3.50–
3.57% and from L. edwardsi in 2.77–2.92% in the
sequenced mtDNA, respectively. The few morphometric
data, which are available at the moment, indicate that L.
manasamody has a significantly longer tail than L. otto. L.

Conclusion
Our results showed that all species, except for L. mustelinus
from the East, grouped in three major clades (western,
northwestern and northern). Taking into account the species diversity within each major clade, however, we can
define seven biogeographic zones in northern and northwestern Madagascar. When compared to the predictions
derived from the "Martin model" and the "Wilmé model",
we find several inconsistencies to our data.
The "Martin model" defined four biogeographic zones
from western to northern Madagascar (W1, NW, X and
N). They corresponded well to the three deep phylogenetic splits, that gave rise to the western, northwestern and
northern clade in our study. However, the species diversity within each major clade could not be explained by
this model.
The "Wilmé model" defined six biogeographic zones from
western to northern Madagascar (numbers 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
and 1). This model may also explain the deep splits
between the three major clades, but it proposed two more
splits. One between IRS V and VI, divided by the Sambirano River. This split could be confirmed by our study,
although it seems not to be a species barrier for sportive
lemurs. The level of absolute pairwise distances is intermediate and may rather suggest a variation on a subspecies level. Very recently however, Rabarivola et al. (2006)
proposed species status for the individuals in IRS V based
on cytogenetics [18]. They collected samples in IRS V at a

Page 9 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:83

locality further north of Mahilaka and the number of
chromosomes differed between individuals from IRS V
(2N = 24) and the neighbouring Lepilemur sahamalazensis
(2N = 26) and Lepilemur dorsalis (2N = 26). The second
additional split indicated by the "Wilmé model" is that
between zone 12 and 1. This split could not be confirmed
by our study, since all individuals found in IRS VII (corresponding to Wilmé's zones 12 and 1) clustered together
and belonged to the species L. ankaranensis. One major
discrepancy exists between our findings and the "Wilmé
model". The "Wilmé model" predicts one centre of endemism in northwestern Madagascar (zone 9), which
should correspond to one Lepilemur species in that area.
Our study provided evidence, however, for three species
of sportive lemurs between the Betsiboka and Maevarano
River, each restricted to one of the three IRSs. Thus, we
showed that each IRS is represented as a separate terminal
clade in the phylogenetic trees, building distinct phylogenetic units. At least six of the seven large rivers act as species barriers for Lepilemur. Therefore, we propose a new
model, the "large river model" to explain the biogeography of this larger-sized nocturnal lemur genus. Large rivers acted as insurmountable barriers for gene flow, leading
to cryptic speciation within larger biogeographic units.
Except for IRSs V and VI, the genetic distances among all
IRSs reach species level.
The deep splits between the major clades may indicate initial colonization events, with the Betsiboka and Maevarano River playing a major role in long-term and
continuous isolation of western, northwestern and northern Madagascar. The splits within each major clade however, indicate younger cryptic speciation events.
Populations, initially belonging to one founder species,
entered the IRSs I-III and VI-VII respectively, and were
subsequently separated from each other by the rivers
Mahajamba and Sofia, and the Andranomalaza, respectively. Quaternary paleoclimatic variation may have
played another important role in shaping biogeography
and speciation events on Madagascar. The climate during
periods of glaciation was cooler and drier than today
[8,43,44]. Rivers with year-round water course could have
acted as retreats/refugia in times of aridification. All seven
large rivers in northwestern and northern Madagascar
should have belonged to this category, since the genetic
isolation of the IRSs would otherwise not have persisted
over time and signs of repeated introgression should be
detectable. Subsequent recolonization of the IRSs should
thereby have originated from small and isolated refugia,
which further promoted genetic differentiation between
the IRSs.
In conclusion, we presented evidence for an unexpected
species diversity of sportive lemurs in northwestern and
northern Madagascar. Current biogeographic models

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/83

were not sufficient to explain the underlying processes of
speciation. We therefore suggest a new model of biogeographical zonation, the "large river model". In this model,
biogeographic zones are separated and maintained over
time by all large rivers with permanent water bodies that
may have provided retreat zones during periods of aridification and may have harboured founder populations for
subsequent recolonization. The importance of large rivers
as biogeographic barriers was previously emphazized for
mouse lemurs [3], but also for neotropical primates
[45,46]. Further studies are now needed to test the relevance of this model for other terrestrial taxa, such as the
insectivores, rodents, or other lemurs.

Methods
Fieldwork
A total of 157 Lepilemur individuals were captured at 14
different localities along a 560 km transect from western
to northern Madagascar (Fig. 4, Table 4). This region is
divided by eight large rivers (over 50 km wide 20 km
inlands) into eight Inter-River-Systems (IRS 0 to IRS VII,
Fig. 4). Six localities were sampled by Mathias Craul (MC)
and eight localities were sampled by Solofo Rasoloharijaona (SR) and Blanchard Randrianambinina (BR). At
each site we performed daily and nightly surveys to capture the animals. At daytime we used a net to capture the
animals out of their sleeping holes and briefly anesthetised them with Ketasel-5 (Selectavet). At night time we
anesthetised the animals using a blowpipe (TELINJECT
B22T) with Ketasel-5 (Selectavet). Each captured sportive
lemur was then characterised with regard to sex, skin colour, reproductive status (testis size or form of vulva), 13
external morphometric measures (ear length, ear width,
head length, head width, snout length, interorbital distance, intraorbital distance, lower leg length, hind foot
length, 3rd toe length, body length, tail length, tail circumference) and body mass [10,47]). In addition, a small
biopsy from one or both pinnae was taken as tissue samples. Tissue samples were stored in Queen's lysis buffer
[48] for later DNA extraction and genetic analyses.
Molecular methods and analyses
DNA from the tissue of 37 individuals was isolated with
the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen), or extracted using a
standard proteinase K digestion followed by a Phenol/
Chloroform protocol [49] and stored at -20°C. In addition, we analysed the DNA of two individuals of Lepilemur
ruficaudatus (Kirindy forest, western Madagascar) provided by Yves Rumpler and of four individuals from Mantadia (eastern Madagascar) sampled previously by SR and
BR. We sequenced the mitochondrial genes D-loop, cytochrome B and NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4),
because reference sequences from all eleven recognized
species were available for these particular markers. The
complete D-loop was amplified with the oligonucleotide

of DNA. Successful amplifications were obtained using
the following protocol: 40 cycles of denaturing 95°C for
30 seconds, primer annealing at 60°C for 60 seconds and
extension at 72°C for 60 seconds. The PCR products were

cleaned with the Invisorb Spin PCRapid Kit (Invitek) or
Quick-Clean (Bioline) and checked for successful amplification by running an aliquot on a 1.5% agarose gel,
stained with 1.3 × 10-4 mg/ml ethidium bromide. After
cleaning the PCR products, cycle sequencing reactions
were carried out using DYEnamic™ ET dye terminator kit
(Amersham Biosciences) and the primers indicated
above. After a second cleaning with ammonium acetate,
provided with the DYEnamic™ ET dye terminator kit, the
PCR products were sequenced on a MegaBACE™ 1000
DNA Sequencing System (Amersham Biosciences). The
respective sequences were deposited in GenBank (Table
5).
For a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the
sequence data, we expanded our data set with reference
sequences from all eleven recognized species available
from GenBank (Table 5). As outgroup for phylogenetic
tree reconstructions, we selected Propithecus diadema.
Sequences were aligned using the program CLUSTALX
[52] and checked by eye. Tree reconstructions of each single gene were carried out to phylogenetically classify the
sampled individuals within the genus Lepilemur. Because
of the lack of reference sequences of single individuals for
all three genes, further phylogenetic tree reconstructions
based on all three genes were performed only with our
own data set consisting of 43 sequences. Phylogenetic tree
reconstructions were carried out with the maximum-parsimony (MP), neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximumlikelihood (ML) algorithms as implemented in
PAUP4.0b10 [53]. Throughout the analyses, all characters
were treated as unordered and equally weighted. Gaps
were considered as missing data in NJ and ML, but were
treated as fifth character in MP analysis. The NJ and ML
trees were constructed using the best-fit model selected by
the hierarchical likelihood ratio test (hLRT) in Modeltest

3.5.mac [54]. Relative support of internal nodes was provided by bootstrap analyses with 1,000 replications for
MP and NJ and 100 replications for ML. Absolute pairwise
distances were calculated using PAUP4.0b10 [50] and
ARLEQUIN 1.1 to describe the variation among taxa. To
determine fixed molecular differences among terminal
clades (indicating barriers for gene flow), diagnostic sites
for each terminal clade to all others were identified using
the program MEGA 3.1 [55].
Statistical analyses of morphometric data
Quantitative analyses of morphometric data were carried
out with two different sample sizes. The ANOVA was conducted with 100 individuals. After removing two variables
that differed among researchers (1-way ANOVA, STATISTICA 6.0, Statsoft, Inc.), the 11 remaining variables were
tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
(Statistica 6.0, StatSoft, Inc.) at a level of p ≤ 0.05. All were
normally distributed. A MANOVA revealed no differences
in sex. The variables were then tested for correlation. All
variables had an r < 0.75 and were therefore defined as

sufficiently independent to be used in a discriminant
function analysis [56]. This analysis was limited to five
adult individuals per species (established and proposed)
in order to equilibrate the samples. The discriminant
function analysis tested only for species differences and
for differences between the IRSs. A stepwise forward
method (statistic: Wilk's λ) with the criteria Ftoenter = 3.84
and Ftoremove = 2.71 and a tolerance level of p ≤ 0.01 was
used to calculate the discriminant function model. The
computed discriminant functions were used to classify
cases with regard to their group membership. All cases
were cross-validated by the "leave-one-out" method,
where each case in the analysis is classified by the functions derived from all cases other than that case. The discriminant function analysis was carried out with the
program SPSS 13.0 (SPSS, Inc.).

During the review process of this paper, Louis Jr. et al.
(2006) described a new sportive lemur species in IRS III
[57]. It was named Lepilemur grewcocki. This might be a

synonym to L. manasamody, as our sampling sites of this
species were in the same IRS. However, a joint phylogenetic analysis is still needed to verify the identity of both
forms.
