Transcriptome characterization of the South
African abalone Haliotis midae using
sequencing-by-synthesis
Paolo Franchini, Mathilde van der Merwe, Rouvay Roodt-Wilding*

Abstract
Background: Worldwide, the genus Haliotis is represented by 56 extant species and several of these are
commercially cultured. Among the six abalone species found in South Africa, Haliotis midae is the only
aquacultured species. Despite its economic importance, genomic sequence resources for H. midae, and for abalone
in general, are still scarce. Next generation sequencing technologies provide a fast and efficient tool to generate
large sequence collections that can be used to characterize the transcriptome and identify expressed genes
associated with economically important traits like growth and disease resistance.
Results: More than 25 million short reads generated by the Illumina Genome Analyzer were de novo assembled in
22,761 contigs with an average size of 260 bp. With a stringent E-value threshold of 10-10, 3,841 contigs (16.8%)
had a BLAST homologous match against the Genbank non-redundant (NR) protein database. Most of these
sequences were annotated using the gene ontology (GO) and eukaryotic orthologous groups of proteins (KOG)
databases and assigned to various functional categories. According to annotation results, many gene families
involved in immune response were identified. Thousands of simple sequence repeats (SSR) and single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) were detected. Setting stringent parameters to ensure a high probability of amplification, 420
primer pairs in 181 contigs containing SSR loci were designed.
Conclusion: This data represents the most comprehensive genomic resource for the South African abalone
H. midae to date. The amount of assembled sequences demonstrated the utility of the Illumina sequencing
technology in the transcriptome characterization of a non-model species. It allowed the development of several
markers and the identification of promising candidate genes for future studies on population and functional
genomics in H. midae and in other abalone species.

Background
Abalones (Haliotis spp., Haliotidae) are important fishery resources worldwide, with high commercial value.
Because of their sedentary lifestyle along shallow rocky
coastlines [1], these gastropods are vulnerable to capture. The subsequent over-exploitation resulted in a
substantial decrease of wild populations. To compensate
for the high demand of abalone, farming by means of
aquaculture has been developed for several Haliotis species in different regions of their distribution area. Currently, abalone aquaculture is practiced on 12 species in
16 different countries [2].

Haliotis midae is one of the six endemic abalone species of southern Africa. Being the largest and most
abundant South African species, this abalone is the ideal
candidate for aquaculture and it is the only one to be
commercially cultivated in the region. Commercial production in South Africa started in the 1980 s with
annual production of farmed animals reaching 934 tons
by 2008 [3].
In recent years, several genetic management procedures have been developed to optimize the production
of various aquaculture species, mainly represented by
fish and shellfish [4-7] and numerous molecular marker
systems have been developed to assist these projects [8].
Notably, extensive research has been done in the field of
marker assisted selection (MAS), with the aim to

identify genetic markers surrounding quantitative trait
loci (QTL). Quantitative variation, controlled by QTL
and environmental influences, characterizes economically important traits in farmed animals, such as growth,
meat quality and disease resistance. In aquaculture, this
information can be utilized to maximise the rate of
genetic gain from selective breeding programs [6,9].
Given the growing importance of abalone in the South
African aquaculture market, a genetic improvement program was initiated in 2006 funded by government and
industry. Since its inception, this program has aimed to
increase productivity by exploiting the inherent biological potential of cultured populations using reproductive,
quantitative and molecular approaches [2,10-14].
Despite its importance in aquaculture, genomic
sequence resources for H. midae, and for abalones in
general, are still scarce; as is the case for most non-model
organisms. Next-generation sequencing technologies
offer novel and rapid ways for genome-wide characterization and profiling of mRNAs, small RNAs, transcription
factor regions, structure of chromatin, DNA methylation
patterns and metagenomics [15]. This technology
provides an efficient way to generate sequence data for
non-model organisms in the form of transcriptome
sequencing. Even though the transcriptome, or Expressed
Sequence Tags (ESTs), represents a subset of the entire
genome of eukaryotes, its sequencing is a valid alternative
to whole genome sequencing. Advantages of investigating
the transcriptome rather than the genome of an organism
include focusing on the part of the genome with high
functional information content [16] and avoiding introns
and intragenic regions that can complicate the analysis of
data [17]. Among the few companies that provide next
generation genome analyzers, the Illumina Solexa
sequencing-by-synthesis system has been widely used in
transcriptome sequencing of organisms whose genomes
are available [18-21] and in non-model organisms with
no reference genomic resources [22]. Furthermore, the
short reads produced by the Illumina Genome Analyzer
(25-30 bp with the first models, 75-100 bp with the latest
model) enabled reliable de novo assemblies into longer
contigs useful for gene discovery, digital gene expression
profiles and comparative genomics studies [22-26].
In this study, the Illumina Genome Analyzer II technology was used to generate over 1.1 billion bases of high
quality DNA to characterize, for the first time, the
H. midae transcriptome. We demonstrated the suitability
of short-read sequencing for de novo assembly that generated more than 20,000 contigs. A substantial percentage of
these rendered BLAST matches to known annotated
genes in public databases. Furthermore, we explored the
assembled transcripts in order to evaluate the level and
distribution of transcriptome coverage in the main functional gene categories of various databases. Several

Page 2 of 11

transcripts involved in disease resistance, an economically
important trait in abalone, were extracted to assist future
studies on selective breeding and genetic engineering.
Finally, we used the de novo assembled contigs to detect
molecular markers (SNP and SSR). For a subset of those
SSRs that satisfied strict amplification parameters, we
designed high quality PCR primers in order to immediately provide molecular markers for use in genetic studies
of H. midae and to test in cross amplification with other
phylogenetically related species.

Results and Discussion
Assembly

Three different H. midae libraries were subjected to a
run in three different lanes of the Illumina Genome
Analyzer II. In the first lane, a cDNA library of three
adult animals was sequenced. In the second and third
lanes, two cDNA libraries originating from two different
groups of eight adult animals of the same age, but
with significant differences in weight and size, were
sequenced. The non-normalised libraries allowed the
study of differentially expressed genes in relation to
growth, but the use of the whole body tissue as source
of RNA prevented the study of tissue specific gene
expression profiles. Differential expression analysis was
the subject of a parallel project and will not be elaborated upon in this paper.
After cleaning the data, the first lane’s output yielded
2x(5,399,167) paired reads 40 and 45 bp long; the other
two lanes yielded respectively 8,487,354 and 5,975,556
single end reads of 45 bp. A total of 25,261,244 reads
were imported into the CLC Genomics Workbench for
de novo assembly. Considering only contigs with a minimum length of 100 bp, the assembly rendered 21,761
sequences (utilizing 10,635,178 reads). Non-assembled
reads and shorter contigs were discarded from further
analyses since they could contain artefacts derived from
cDNA synthesis, sequencing and contamination. The
contigs ranged in size between the minimum set threshold of 100 bp and 10,744 bp (average size of 260 bp and a
N50 value of 356 bp) with 2,394 contigs that were more
than 500 bp in length. The number of reads per contig
ranged between 9 and 143,200 with an average of 401
reads per contig (Figure 1a). The average nucleotide-wide
coverage was estimated to 36.6x (Figure 1b). The contigs
file is provided as Additional file 1 in fasta format.
The genome size of H. midae was recently described
(C = 1.43 pg; 2803 MB), but genomic studies on this
non-model species are in an early stage, and the percentage of its genome that is transcribed is unknown. This,
together with the lack of genomic information in other
abalone species (in which a substantial variation in genome size has also been observed: C-value ranges from
1.43 pg in H. midae to 2.14 pg in H. corrugata) make it

For the de novo assembly, where no annotated reference
is available, the matching of contigs to known proteins
gives an indication of the quality of assembly [30]. Using
a stringent E-value threshold of 10 -10 , 3,841 out of
22,761 contigs (16.8%) had a BLAST homologous match
against the NR protein database. This level of sequence
similarity matching is low, but comparable to those
found in other studies [22,31,32] where high throughput
sequencing technology was used for the de novo transcriptome assembly of non-model species. The main
reason for this result is probably the lack of large scale

mollusc species are present in the top-BLAST match
species distribution (the matches with the lowest
E-value for each contig), other more distant taxa with
comprehensive genomic resources in Genbank are present as well, both invertebrate and vertebrate (Figure 2).
The poor representation of abalones and closely
related molluscs in public databases is also revealed by
the BLAST analyses results when comparing H. midae
with Lottia gigantea, a closely related mollusc with comprehensive genomic resources. The EST collection and
the filtered genes of Lottia were used as reference

difficult to predict how deep our de novo assembled
sequences cover the South African abalone transcriptome [27].
Before evaluating the assembly by BLAST analysis
against public protein databases, the quality was
assessed by self-BLAST that rendered a low percentage
of matches against other contigs with 100% identity and
E-value <10-50 (795 matches corresponding to 3.5% of
total sequences), indicating the efficiency of the assembly of the Illumina short reads. Furthermore, in matches
with 100% identity the alignment mostly extended for a
short portion of the query (435 matches had alignment
length ≤ 50 bp averaging 8% of the length of the query
contig). These short alignments could indicate the presence of short repeated sequences, commonly spread
across the eukaryotic genome, while the longer matches
could indicate the occurrence of different transcripts of
the same gene resulting from alternative splicing events
[28,29].

during the sequence similarity search. The genera Haliotis and Lottia belong to different taxonomic groups
(respectively Vetigastropoda and Patellogastropoda), and
their evolutionary distance inferred by morphological
and molecular data [33,34] is emphasized by the minimal percentage of gene similarity obtained by the
BLAST analysis (15.2% to Lottia ESTs; 17.3% to Lottia
predicted gene models). To confirm this pattern, mapping of H. midae short reads against the Lottia genome
resources was only successful for a small subset of the
reads (ranging approximately from 0.06% reads mapped
to the Lottia ESTs and clustered ESTs to 0.07% reads
mapped to the Lottia genes). Another explanation for
the poor matching is represented by the abundance of
short sequences in the contigs file. As shown in Figure 3,
15,285 sequences (67.2%) range between 100 and 200 bp
and 19,414 (85.3%) are less than 400 bp in length. This
is an expected result as, according to the BLAST algorithm, shorter sequences are required to have higher
identity in order to satisfy a certain E-value.
The phylogenetic bias emerging from the BLAST analysis when using the NR database is not confirmed
when the contigs were searched for similarity using
BLASTn against the EST database collection of NCBI
(dbEST), where a large number of EST sequences from
non-model organisms is present (to date, only 70 ESTs
of H. midae have been submitted in dbEST). Of the
8,190 sequences (36.0%) where similarity was found
(E-value threshold of 10 -10 ), 5,693 (69.5% of the
matches) had top-BLAST matches against species of the
genus Haliotis and 1,478 (18.0% of the matches) against
other mollusc species. This finding is a further confirmation of the quality of our assembly.

contigs matched known proteins (E-value threshold of
10-3). From this file, the above reported 3,841 matches
were filtered according to a more stringent E-value
threshold of 10 -10 . This stringent E-value allowed
the annotation of these sequences to their described
functions in public databases with a high level of
confidence.
To classify the function of the predicted H. midae
genes, GO annotation was performed. Out of the total
3,841 sequences with BLAST matches, Blast2GO successfully annotated 2,991 sequences associating them
with 20,054 GO terms. Of these, 8,429 were assigned to
the functional category ‘Biological Process’ (42.1%),
6,674 to ‘Molecular Function’ (33.2%) and 4,951 to ‘Cellular Component’ (24.7%). These contigs were assigned
to most of the subcategories of the GO database.
Functional annotation against the KOG database rendered 2,951 sequences that had BLAST matches with an
E-value < 10-10 (Figure 4). These were uniquely assigned
to the four main KOG classes (ranging from 1,067 contigs, 36.2%, for the “Cellular Processes and Signaling” to
349 contigs, 11.8%, for “Poorly characterized”) and each
of their sub-categories were populated by at least five
sequences. The main represented sub-categories were
“Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones” (370 contigs), “Signal transduction mechanisms” (271), both belonging to the “Cellular Processes
and Signaling” main class, and “Energy production and
conversion” (213) of the “Metabolism” main class.
Approximately 10% of the contigs (290) were assigned
to more than one sub-category, and were thus indicated
as “multiple assignment” in Figure 4. The distribution of
the contigs in various functional classes of GO and
KOG databases indicates how the transcriptome data,
even though not covering the entire H. midae transcriptome, encompasses a broad gene diversity. To further
evaluate this finding, the clustered ESTs of L. gigantea
were searched for sequence similarity against the KOG
database using BLASTx. Using the same E-value threshold of 10 -10 , this analysis rendered 10,056 annotated
sequences with the assignment proportions to the KOG
categories mirroring those of H. midae (Figure 4). The
higher number of annotated ESTs for L. gigantea is an
expected result because of the large amount of data
sequenced; the most comprehensive among Gastropod
taxa. Nevertheless, the similarity in KOG category distribution could reflect the adequate representation of the
complete H. midae transcriptome.

annotation to GO, KOG and PFAM databases were used
to search for these specific transcripts. The selected trait
can be harnessed in farmed abalone during selective
breeding programs and in future, possibly through
genetic engineering in order to optimize the production
in terms of body mass and meat quality. Despite their
fundamental role in aquaculture, only a few studies of
quantitative traits in aquaculture species have been conducted (Abalone: [9]; Trout: [35]; Salmon: [36]). In
recent years, the genomic revolution has allowed
researchers to acknowledge the contribution of candidate genes [37] and many studies are now directed to
increase the knowledge on the genetic base of these
traits.
Infectious diseases are considered one of the main
barriers to the successful development and continuation
of molluscan aquaculture as they limit production in
terms of quality, quantity and regularity [38,39]. Various
investigations have revealed that infectious diseases can
have a significant negative impact on the abalone aquaculture [40-47]. Different kinds of organisms are associated with diseases in cultured abalone. A protozoan of
the group haplosporidian was associated with high mortalities of cultured juvenile paua (Haliotis iris) in New
Zealand [46]. Various bacteria have also been isolated
from cultured abalone experiencing disease and mortalities. Disease outbreaks among cultured abalone

(Haliotis rubra, H. laevigata and their hybrids) in Tasmania, Australia, were associated with two species of
Vibrio (V. harveyi and V. splendidus I) and a Flavobacterium-like bacterium [48]. In Japan, the bacterium
Vibrio carchariae was isolated from cultured abalone
(Haliotis diversicolor supratexta) experiencing a mass
mortality [43]. Since 1998, Vibrio harveyi, a marine
pathogen that affects a large range of animals, was
responsible for episodic abalone epidemics associated
with massive mortalities in France, Japan, and Australia,
both in wild and farmed animals [49]. Currently, Tasmania is experiencing an outbreak of abalone Viral Ganglioneuritis (AVG), that after its first appearance in 2008,
lead to the quarantining of land-based culture and processing facilities as well as closure of the local recreational fishery in January 2011 [50]. In H. midae, farmed
animals experienced reduced growth rates due to sabellid polychaete infection [44].
Notwithstanding the relevant negative impact of various kinds of infections documented worldwide in wild
and farmed animals, the biological pathways of stress
response and disease resistance are not well characterized, and their genetic basis and control are still poorly
understood.
Internal defense mechanisms against pathogens and
parasites are generally constituted by cellular and soluble (humoral) haemolymph components. In terms of

Franchini et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/59

this latter immune system, different gene families related
to various mechanisms involved in disease-resistance
were found in the H. midae data spanning from those
coding for lysosomal enzymes, lectins, and antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) to peptides mediating apoptosis and
other genes regulating or acting on immune response.
Several transcripts were annotated to genes coding for
various kinds of lysosomal enzymes, such as acid or
alkaline phosphatase, lipase, aminopeptidase and lysozyme enzymes that actively participate in parasite
destruction (see Additional file 3). AMPs aid in recognition of pathogens and parasites by marking them for
destruction via opsonising or direct killing [51]. Despite
variations in structure and size, their role in anticancer
activities, regulation of cell proliferation, wound healing
effects and many cellular immune responses regulated
by inducing gene expression was shown in several studies [52-54]. AMPs are well studied in molluscs and
their possible use in aquaculture as antibiotics substitutes (resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is drastically
increasing) is being evaluated [55]. One transcript was
annotated to an AMP and two transcripts were found to
be orthologous to H2A, a histone from which a potential antimicrobial peptide, Abhisin, is derived, as
reported in a recent study on disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus [56]. Apoptosis is a highly conserved multifunctional process that not only plays a critical role in
cellular and tissue homeostasis and embryonic development, but is also involved in the immune system where
it limits possible damage caused by pathogens or parasites [57]. Many transcripts were found to code for regulators of apoptosis and they can be useful candidates to
further elucidate this mechanism in H. midae.
Despite the importance of humoral defense mechanisms, cellular immunity seems to perform the main role
in shellfish immune processes [58]. The main defence
mechanism of molluscan haemocytes is the phagocytosis
of pathogens; destroying them by the release of nitric
oxide and lysosomal enzymes [59]. In both immune system mechanisms, host-pathogen recognition is a crucial
step to activate the immune response. Several transcripts
were homologous to genes coding for receptors involved

Page 6 of 11

in host-pathogen recognition (e.g. peptidoglycan recognition proteins, thrombospondin-like glycoproteins, scavenger receptors and contactin associated proteins) and
to genes promoting the transduction of the signal (coding for peptides involved in, for example, kinase and
notch signaling pathways).
Given the importance of this trait in cultured species
such as the South African abalone H. midae, a brief list
of transcripts expected to play a role in disease resistance
was extracted from the data and is reported in Additional
file 3 along with respective functional descriptions
retrieved from the GO, KOG and PFAM databases.
Although by no means exhaustive, this list of transcripts
can represent a basis from where to identify candidate
disease resistance genes for future studies on functional
and comparative genomics. For such studies to be useful,
however, a more thorough platform describing disease
resistance pathways in molluscs is needed.
Marker discovery

A total of 7,831 SSRs with a minimum of four contiguous repeat units (motifs range from two to six) were
identified in 4,707 contigs (20.7%). The most abundant
SSRs are characterized by dinucleotide motifs (6,059),
followed by trinucleotide (1,103), tetranucleotide (547),
hexanucleotide (67) and pentanucleotide (55) motifs
(Table 1). To provide an immediate resource for future
studies, primer pairs were designed in those contigs
containing adequate flanking regions. After screening
with more stringent search parameters (see Material and
Methods), 420 primer pairs were found in 181 contigs
(available in Additional file 4 in fasta format). Additional file 5 provides the information of each SSR
including repeat motif, number of repeats, sequences of
forward and reverse primer and melting temperature. Of
the 4,707 contigs containing SSRs, 1,158 (24.6%) were
found in annotated sequences. A lower percentage of
annotated sequences were found for the contigs where
primers were designed (8.8%, 16 out of 181). To validate
the quality of this method for SSR discovery, a set of
microsatellite loci selected from contigs assembled
de novo from the reads of the first three animals (first

lane of the sequencing) was tested for amplification [60].
Twenty two out of 27 tested primers gave a PCR product of the expected size and 14 of them were polymorphic. The SSR sequences where amplification was
successful were also found in the final set of contigs
obtained from the 19 animals, but they were not found
in the 181 contigs where the 420 primers, reported in
the Additional file 5 were designed. Since more stringent amplification conditions were applied to design
these latter primers (in sequences with higher confidence), we expect a higher amplification efficiency from
this final set.
Currently, 215 microsatellite markers are available for
H. midae, discovered either with traditional methods
[13,14,61,62] or by pyrosequencing technology [2].
These are used for studies on population structure,
genetic diversity, parentage, linkage mapping and QTLmapping [2,63,64]. Thirty one of the available 215
microsatellites were found in our contigs. This apparently low match could be mainly explained by the fact
that most of the available SSRs are found in genomic
material of which only a sub-portion is transcribed.
Furthermore, the complete transcriptome of H. midae
could have been only partially covered by the de novo
assembled contigs of this study and some of the ESTSSRs previously detected could be contained in
sequences not covered by our assembly.
Traditional methods, for example the most widely
used Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences Containing
Repeats (FIASCO; [65]) and the SNX-unilinker method
[66], are not suited for high-throughput development of
markers because their use is expensive and time consuming. Next generation sequencing gives a superior
resource for marker discovery mainly because of the
large amount of data produced in a short time. Pyrosequencing of genomic DNA provided, for the first time,
short sequence reads in H. midae and the microsatellite
markers identified were used, together with other markers, to construct a preliminary linkage map for QTL
detection [2]. The microsatellites identified in the present work have the advantage to be EST-based SSRs,
therefore part of, or adjacent to functional genes. EST-

SSRs are characterized by higher amplification rates and
cross-species transferability in comparison to SSRs contained in non transcribed regions [67]. They can facilitate the detection of functional variation [17] and offer
the possibility of selecting markers according to the biochemical and physiological properties of the gene products in relation to the phenotype [68].
Similarly, 11,934 SNPs were detected in 4,380 of the
22,761 contigs, yielding an average of approximately 1
SNP every 500 bp. By limiting the SNP detection to the
953 contigs with high coverage (> 100×) (available in
Additional file 6 in fasta format), 839 SNPs were identified (about 1 SNP every 1,000 bp). As expected, transitions occurred at a higher rate than transversions in
both analyses, at approximately a 3:1 ratio (Table 2).
Previously, ESTs (generated by Sanger sequencing) were
used to describe the first set of SNPs (20 loci) for
H. midae [10] and 11 SNPs were developed from SSR
flanking regions [12]. Some of those SNPs were successfully genotyped for a population genetic analysis of wild
populations of H. midae [63]. A selected subset of 11
SNPs detected in the contigs has also been tested for
genotyping in a GoldenGate Veracode genotyping assay
(Illumina) with positive results.
Slightly different, but comparable levels of polymorphism
were observed in the transcriptomes of other non-model
animals where high throughput sequencing was used, for
example in the Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica (1
SNP every 294 bp: [32]) and in the flesh fly Sarcophaga
crassipalpis (1 SNP every 1,383 bp: [31]). The polymorphism detected in the current study (1 SNP every
500 bp) showed an intermediate level when compared to
the highest level observed in L. elliptica and the lowest
level observed in S. crassipalpis. In the former, the library
was constructed using a similar number of animals (24)
as in the current study, but collected in the wild. In the
latter, the library was prepared from a long-standing
laboratory colony. The fact that the abalone library originated from 19 siblings from a specific family could
explain the observed trend and lead to the supposition
that the SNP variation detected is likely a small fraction
of that existing in natural populations of H. midae.

Conclusions
The present study describes the first comprehensive
transcriptomic sequence characterization of the abalone
Haliotis midae, the most economically important aquaculture species in South Africa. More than 20,000 putative transcripts were obtained, with a large percentage
matching to known proteins. This demonstrates the feasibility of the Illumina technology for de novo sequence
assembly in a non-model species. According to the various functional categories in public annotation databases, the sample seems to be well represented and
allows the identification of several genes associated with
disease resistance, one of the most relevant traits for
aquaculture species. Screening of the transcriptome
allowed the detection of thousands of SNPs and SSRs
that will be useful for future genomic studies. Finally,
the high coverage showed by most of the transcripts will
allow the investigation of differential gene expression
with the aim of targeting genes associated with various
genetic based traits. A project based on the estimation
of differential gene expression patterns in relation to
growth is currently being conducted in our laboratory.
Methods
Sampling

A total of 19 animals designated for RNA extraction and
downstream transcriptome sequencing were collected
from the Roman Bay Sea Farm (Gansbaai, South Africa).
All animals were two-year old siblings from a specific
family with a range of shell sizes between 26 and
64 mm in length. The animals were transported in oxygenated seawater to the laboratory where they were kept
for no longer than 3 hours before being sacrificed. For
tissue collection, animals were taken from the water one
by one and placed on ice for ten minutes, shell-side
down, to allow muscle contraction to slow down. This
was necessary to assist fast and effective dissection. For
each abalone, all mucus and water was wiped away with
tissue paper and subsequently all soft tissue was dissected away from the shell and placed in a 90 mm petri
dish. The tissue was cut into 5 mm strips and transferred to a tube containing RNALater solution
(Ambion). For RNA isolation and cDNA library preparation, the animals were divided in three groups. The first,
constituted by three specimens, was originally used for
testing the next generation sequencing protocols and
building the first H. midae reference transcriptome. The
second and the third group, both constituted by eight
specimens, were separated according to observed differential growth for a parallel project aimed at the investigation of differential gene expression. The sequencing
output of the three groups was used to build a more
comprehensive reference transcriptome.

RNA isolation and cDNA library preparation

All glassware used during RNA extraction procedures
was baked at 145°C for 6-7 hours and plastic ware were
soaked in a solution of 0.1% SDS and 0.1 M NaOH at
37ËšC overnight. A protocol for extraction of cytosolic
RNA adapted from [69] and [70] was followed. To convert the total RNA into a library of template molecules
suitable for high throughput DNA sequencing, poly-A
containing mRNA molecules were isolated, fragmented
and copied into cDNA. Briefly, 11 μg (for each group
described above) of total RNA was incubated at 65°C
for five minutes, during which RNA secondary structures were disrupted, and mRNA was isolated using
oligo (dT) magnetic beads. The 9 μl of mRNA obtained
after oligo (dT) purification was fragmented by adding
1 μl of 10 × Fragmentation Buffer (Ambion) and incubated at 70°C for 5 minutes. The cleaved RNA fragments were then copied into first strand cDNA using
SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (200 U/μL, Invitrogen) and a high concentration of random hexamer primers. This was followed by second strand cDNA
synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNaseH. DNA
was purified using QIAquick PCR spin columns (Qiagen) and eluted in 30 μL of Elution Buffer solution. The
following part of the library preparation was performed
using the Illumina Genomic DNA Sample Prep Kit
according to manufacturer’s instructions. In this phase,
the cDNA fragments were subjected to an end-repair
process followed by the ligation of the adapters. Finally,
products were enriched with PCR to create the final
cDNA library using two primers that anneal to the ends
of the adapters. Only 18 cycles of PCR were employed,
to avoid any skewing of the representation of the library
(Illumina, Inc.) The amplified product was loaded onto
a 2% agarose gel to verify that the correct sized template
(± 300 bp) amplified. Sequencing of clustered template
DNA on the Genome Analyzer was performed using
four-color DNA Sequencing-By-Synthesis (SBS)
technology.
Assembly

A paired end (40 and 45 bp) and two single end raw
short reads sets (45 bp) sequenced in three different
lanes of the Illumina Genome Analyzer II sequencer
were cleaned by removing adapter sequences, empty
reads and low quality sequences (where the percentage
of non-determined bases, identified by “N”, was ≥ 10%
of the total length). Furthermore, to avoid vector contamination, the reads with significant matches against
the UniVec database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
VecScreen/UniVec.html were deleted. Files containing
the sequences and quality scores have been submitted to
the National Center for Biotechnology Information

(NCBI) Short Read Archive (accession number
SRA024566). High quality reads of each of the three
datasets (single and paired ends), were de novo
assembled by using the CLC Genomics Workbench v4.0
software (CLCbio, Aarhus, Denmark). The program
implements an algorithm that works using de Bruijn
graphs by making a table of all sub-sequences of a certain length (called K-mers) found in the reads and subsequently concatenating them into longer sequences
called contigs. After building contigs with all the available reads, the program uses the information stored in
paired end reads to scaffold these contigs into longer
sequences (see the software documentation for details).
For the paired end sequences set, an insertion length
ranging between 170 and 250 bp was selected as it was
empirically determined after several de novo runs that
all the assembled reads were normally distributed in this
range with the highest frequency at 210 bp. Since for
this work there was a requirement for longer sequences
of good quality, which would enable the distinction
between gene family members, only contigs with length
≥ 100 bp were considered and further analyzed. The
resultant contigs were saved and their consensus
sequences exported for BLAST search, annotation analysis and marker discovery.
BLAST and Annotation

The coverage and the quality of the assembled contigs
were assessed by aligning them against the Genbank
non-redundant (NR) protein database using the
BLASTx algorithm. BLASTn was used to align the
assembled contigs against the collection of EST
sequences of the NCBI (dbEST). Functional annotation
in the form of gene ontology (GO) was extracted from
the NR database using Blast2GO v2.4.4 [71], an automated tool for the assignment of gene ontology terms
to BLAST matches (E-value threshold of 10-10 ). Since
Blast2GO was designed to be used with novel sequence
data, it was well suited to the de novo assembled contigs produced in this study. Furthermore, functional
annotation was performed by BLAST comparisons
(using the BLASTx algorithm) against the eukaryotic
orthologous groups of proteins (KOG). This analysis
was performed using the Desktop cDNA Annotation
System (dCAS) v1.4.3 [72] using the same stringent Evalue threshold of 10 -10 . The dCAS application was
also used to annotate the sequences, by the use of the
rpsBLAST algorithm, against the database of protein
families and domains (PFAM) [73].
To evaluate the degree of gene conservation, dCAS
was used to align the contigs against the sequence data
from another mollusc species with comprehensive annotated genomic resources; the gastropod snail Lottia
gigantea http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Lotgi1/Lotgi1.home.

Page 9 of 11

html. For the same purpose, the ESTs collection, the
clustered ESTs (the resource more comparable with our
data) and the Gene filtered model of L. gigantea were
used as reference to map the H. midae short reads.
Mapping was performed with the Mosaik v1.0 software
(Michael Stromberg, Boston University). Different combinations of ‘hash size’ (15, 17 and 19) and ‘number of
mismatches allowed’ (2, 3 and 4) were tested for each of
the three Lottia sequence sets. The L. gigantea clustered
ESTs were also used to evaluate the representativeness
of the H. midae transcriptome by a comparative analysis
of the annotated sequences of both mollusc species to
the KOG database (where assignment of query
sequences to multiple classes is limited).
All assembly, BLAST, mapping and annotation data
were loaded in a local MySql database and summary
statistics was extrapolated with relevant queries.
Marker discovery

Phobos v3.3.11 [74] was used to detect tandem Simple
Sequence Repeats (SSR) in the assembled contigs. The
analysis was run setting the length of the repeat motifs
to be searched between two and six and the minimum
number of repeats equal to four. To assess the genotyping potential of the detected microsatellites, the subset
of contigs containing a minimum number of SSR pattern repeats of seven, for di- and trinucleotide motifs,
six, for tetra- and pentanucleotide motifs and five, for
hexanucleotide motifs, was selected and primers for
their amplification were designed using the web application BatchPrimer3 v1.0 [75]. To ensure a high probability of amplification, the primers designed in the SSR
flanking regions had to have a GC content ranging
between 40 and 70%, a melting temperature between 52
and 65°C with a maximum 2°C difference between each
primers pair in which a GC clamp was imposed. The
primers were positioned in order to obtain PCR products between 100 and 500 bp in length.
The CLC Genomics Workbench mapping facility was
used to detect SNPs in the Haliotis contigs. SNPs with a
minimum average quality value of surrounding bases
and central base respectively of 15 and 20, a minimum
coverage of 20× and a minimum variant allele frequency
of 20% were enumerated. To obtain a subset with higher
confidence, SNPs were filtered according to their presence in contigs characterized by a minimum of 100×
average coverage using the same search parameters as
for the first analysis except for the minimum coverage
of the SNP position that was set at 80×.

Ethical clearance
Studies conducted on the abalone Haliotis midae have
been exempted from ethical clearance by Stellenbosch
University Animal Care and Use Committee.
