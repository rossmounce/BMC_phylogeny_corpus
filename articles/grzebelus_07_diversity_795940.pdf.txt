Abstract
Background: Transposable elements constitute a significant fraction of plant genomes. The PIF/Harbinger
superfamily includes DNA transposons (class II elements) carrying terminal inverted repeats and producing
a 3 bp target site duplication upon insertion. The presence of an ORF coding for the DDE/DDD
transposase, required for transposition, is characteristic for the autonomous PIF/Harbinger-like elements.
Based on the above features, PIF/Harbinger-like elements were identified in several plant genomes and
divided into several evolutionary lineages. Availability of a significant portion of Medicago truncatula
genomic sequence allowed for mining PIF/Harbinger-like elements, starting from a single previously
described element MtMaster.
Results: Twenty two putative autonomous, i.e. carrying an ORF coding for TPase and complete terminal
inverted repeats, and 67 non-autonomous PIF/Harbinger-like elements were found in the genome of M.
truncatula. They were divided into five families, MtPH-A5, MtPH-A6, MtPH-D,MtPH-E, and MtPH-M,
corresponding to three previously identified and two new lineages. The largest families, MtPH-A6 and
MtPH-M were further divided into four and three subfamilies, respectively. Non-autonomous elements
were usually direct deletion derivatives of the putative autonomous element, however other types of
rearrangements, including inversions and nested insertions were also observed. An interesting structural
characteristic – the presence of 60 bp tandem repeats – was observed in a group of elements of subfamily
MtPH-A6-4. Some families could be related to miniature inverted repeat elements (MITEs). The presence
of empty loci (RESites), paralogous to those flanking the identified transposable elements, both
autonomous and non-autonomous, as well as the presence of transposon insertion related size
polymorphisms, confirmed that some of the mined elements were capable for transposition.
Conclusion: The population of PIF/Harbinger-like elements in the genome of M. truncatula is diverse. A
detailed intra-family comparison of the elements' structure proved that they proliferated in the genome
generally following the model of abortive gap repair. However, the presence of tandem repeats facilitated
more pronounced rearrangements of the element internal regions. The insertion polymorphism of the
MtPH elements and related MITE families in different populations of M. truncatula, if further confirmed
experimentally, could be used as a source of molecular markers complementary to other marker systems.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) are dispersed repetitive
sequences constituting a major fraction of plant genomes,
ranging from 10% of Arabidopsis thaliana genome [1], to
an estimated value over 70% of maize genome [2]. Class
I elements (retrotransposons), transposing via an RNA
intermediate, form the most abundant fraction, while
class II elements (DNA transposons), use a 'cut and paste'
mechanism for transposition and are usually less numerous.
Advances in genome sequencing of model plant species
enabled systematic, computer-based studies towards the
identification of repetitive sequences, including those representing putative TEs. The presence of certain structural
characteristics of particular groups of TEs allowed the
development of a range of strategies for de novo or homology-based identification of novel elements. A number of
methods for automatic mining of transposable elements
were developed [3-6], To date, two model plant genomes,
i.e. A. thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice) have been extensively studied [7-11].
Founder members of the PIF/Harbinger superfamily of
class II TEs were identified in maize [12] and A. thaliana
[7]. Other full-length elements were subsequently found
in rice (Pong [13]), carrot, and M. truncatula (Master [14]).
Autonomous PIF/Harbinger-like elements carry 14–25 bp
long terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) flanked by 3 bp long
(TTA/TAA) target site duplications (TSD), and a DDD/
DDE transposase showing similarity to that of the bacterial IS5 insertion sequence. The group of PIF/Harbingerlike elements was shown to be widespread in the plant
kingdom and composed of two easily distinguishable
subgroups, i.e. PIF and Pong [15]. Elements representing
both subgroups were related to certain miniature inverted
repeat elements (MITEs), like Tourist in maize [12,16] and
mPING in rice [13].
Medicago truncatula (barrel medic) has been chosen as a
model plant for the Fabaceae family, primarily to study
relationships between plants and their symbiotic
microbes. It has a relatively small genome of 500 to 600
Mbp [17], shows annual growth habit and self-fertility.
The genome of M. truncatula has not been extensively analysed with respect to TE identification. A MITE element
Bigfoot was reported in the genomes of M. truncatula and
M. sativa [18], a set of Ty3/gypsy-like Ogre elements characteristic for legume species was described in M. truncatula
[19], and several other M. truncatula elements were briefly
characterized in Repbase Update database [20]. A recent
study of another model legume, Lotus japonicus, identified
a number of PIF- and Pong-like elements and a strong evidence for their recent amplification in the host genome
[21].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/409

In this paper we used the accumulated M. truncatula
genomic sequence data to identify putative TEs belonging
to the PIF/Harbinger superfamily and related to a previously characterized MtMaster element [14]. Therefore, our
study was focused on identification and in-depth characterization of a strictly defined group of full-length (putative autonomous and non-autonomous) TEs carrying not
only a PIF/Harbinger-specific transposase, but also a particular TIR motif characteristic of most of the PIF-like, but
not of the Pong-like elements.

Results
Identification and phylogeny of PIF/Harbinger-like
elements of M. truncatula
The initial search of the M. truncatula genome aimed at the
identification of putative autonomous elements, i.e. those
carrying an ORF showing homology to the predicted
MtMaster TPase (transposase) protein sequence [14] and
flanked with terminal inverted repeats of at least 14 bp,
containing the G(N)5GTT motif, and followed by a 3 bplong TSD (TAA or TTA). This resulted to 44 sequences
showing significant homology (E-value < 10-20) to the
TPase, after eliminating the redundancy coming from
overlapping BACs. We obtained precisely the same hits
using the whole TPase sequence and the DDE region,
likely because of the very rigorous E-value threshold
imposed during the search. Of the identified sequences,
22 were flanked by TIRs and TSDs characteristic for PIF/
Harbinger-like elements and these were assumed to represent complete transposable elements. They ranged in
length from 2,180 to 25,288 bp. In 11 of these elements,
another coding region, similar to the MtMaster orf1 with
E-value ranging from 10-4 to 10-99, could be found. The
relative order of both ORFs was variable – five elements
had orf1 upstream and six downstream the TPase (Table
1).

A phylogenetic analysis of the DDE domain region of the
TPase revealed that the M. truncatula PIF/Harbinger-like
elements could be divided into five lineages. Nine elements, including the previously described MtMaster, were
grouped into lineage M, together with carrot DcMaster
[14]. In seven of these elements the orf1 preceded the
TPase as expected, while for the remaining two the orf1
was absent, most likely because of an internal deletion.
Eight elements formed a new lineage designated as A6.
Typically for the group A, the orf1 was located downstream the TPase in the five elements carrying both coding
regions. Another new lineage, designated as E, was formed
by two elements. In none of them could the orf1 be identified. Two other elements were included into lineage A5,
together with maize ZmPIF [12] and one was placed into
lineage D (Figure 1). However, in the latter case the orf1
was located downstream to TPase, contrary to previously
described elements from that lineage [15].

Diversity and abundance of PIF/Harbinger-like elements
in M. truncatula
In addition to the TPase-containing elements described
above, using a strategy outlined in the Methods section,
we identified additional 67 elements lacking any coding
capacity and thus considered as non-autonomous. List of
all identified elements and their coordinates are given in
the Additional File 1. The grouping of the identified transposable elements was based on the full element sequence
similarity or 5' and 3' terminal sequence similarity using
two approaches: hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling (Additional File 2). This strategy allowed us
to define families and subfamilies of PIF/Harbinger-like
transposable elements in M. trunactula (Table 2), where
families essentially reflected the lineages previously identified on the basis of the TPase phylogeny, and subfamilies grouped elements carrying homologous TIRs
(Table 3) and showing a degree of overall DNA sequence
similarity. For each but two subfamilies, one or two putatively autonomous core elements could be identified. The
exception was a low copy number family MtPH-E, for
which none of the elements contained a region homologous to the orf1.

The largest family, MtPH-A6, contained 54 elements,
while family MtPH-D was represented only by a single element. The second most abundant family, containing 27
elements, was MtPH-M (Master), of which 18 was
grouped into subfamily 3.
Detailed structure analysis of MtPH families
MtPH-A6 consisted of four subfamilies represented by
putative autonomous elements sharing similar ORF
organization, i.e. a TPase containing two introns, followed by orf1. MtPH-A6 TPases formed a well supported
clade, containing four subclades with high bootstrap val-

ues, representing the corresponding subfamilies (Figure
1).
Subfamily MtPH-A6-1 contained nine elements ranging in
length from 802 to 8,707 bp, the longest element carrying
a nested insertion of the 7,555 bp long RAM12 gypsy-like
retrotransposon.
Subfamily MtPH-A6-2 grouped six elements, 898 to 4,218
bp long, all being simple internal deletion derivatives of
the core element MtPH-A6-2-Ia.
Sixteen elements belonged to subfamily MtPH-A6-3, ranging in length from 553 to 4,845 bp, except for a much
larger, 23,892 bp long element MtPH-A6-3-IIIa, initially
identified as being flanked by 15 bp TIRs unrelated to
those of the MtPH-A6-3 subfamily. However, the element
contained a 4.9 kb region 74% identical to the two elements mentioned above, but lacking the first 8 bases in
the 5' TIR (Figure 2). Hence, the true boundaries of the
elements could not be initially identified using our mining strategy. An interesting feature of that subfamily was
the presence of a perfect microsatellite site in the first
intron of the TPase. The three elements containing the
region coding for the TPase, MtPH-A6-3-Ia, MtPH-A6-3IIa, and MtPH-A6-3-IIIa had, respectively, 27, 8, and 21
repeats of the (TA)n core motif (Figure 2).
MtPH-A6-4 subfamily members ranged in length from
431 to 25,288 bp. Among the 23 members of that subfamily, 18 were characterized by the presence of imperfect
60 bp long tandem repeats, variable in number, while in
the remaining five elements the core repeat was entirely
absent. Each repeat itself contained a triplicated AAACNNCTTATT motif. These elements contained from 2 to 35
repeats that in extreme cases covered almost the entire

region between the TIRs (Figure 3A and 3B). In some elements, tandem repeats were present only in one subterminal region, while for the others they were present in both
subterminal regions in opposite orientation. The 60 bp
tandem repeats were identified in 27 other sites in the M.
truncatula genome, initially not identified as occupied by
MtPH-A6-4 elements. However, BLAST search with the terminal 214 bp + 3 bp TSD of the MtPH-A6-4-Ia and MtPHA6-4-IIa elements indicated that in all instances at least
one of the regions flanking the repeats showed residual
homology to the TE terminus (E value < 1e-08). The presence of tandem repeats facilitated internal rearrangements
resulting in inversions of the internal region (Figure 3C).
Two nested insertions were identified in the longest element MtPH-A6-4-IIa, which showed three blocks of significant homology to the MtPH-A6-4-Ia core element,
interrupted by an unidentified element of 2,191 bp carrying 15 bp TIRs and flanked by a 5 bp long TSD and a gypsylike retrotransposon (Figure 3D).

MtPH-M-2 became a target for subsequent nested insertions. Other elements from that family ranged in length
from 2,240 to 7,816 bp.

MtPH-M family included three subfamilies with short (14
bp), similar TIRs and orf1 followed by TPase. Subfamily
MtPH-M-1 contained only four elements, ranging in
length from 812 to 5,140 bp. Two of them, MtPH-M-1-Ia
(previously described as MtMaster [10]) and MtPH-M-1IIa (showing 90% overall sequence identity to MtMaster)
had both ORFs, and the remaining two were internally
deleted derivatives.

Subfamily MtPH-M-3 was the largest within the family
and contained 18 elements, of which two carried both
ORFs. Their length varied from 442 to 4,048 bp, and interestingly, two 442 bp-long elements were 100% identical.
As their length resembled that of miniature inverted
repeat elements (MITEs), but unlike MITEs, their number
in the M. truncatula genome was low, it would be tempting to speculate that these copies might become founders
of a new MITE family. A slightly more advanced stage of
proliferation of MITE-like elements could be observed
with a group of 10 short (776–905 bp) elements from the
same family. A more detailed comparison of the element
sequences provided a further insight into the evolution of
MtPH-M-3 subfamily. Internal deletions were accompanied by differentiation and rearrangement of variant
sequences (blocks A, B, and C in Figure 5, Additional File
3) in the subterminal regions. Two lineages could be
traced that originated from the core element MtPH-M-3Ia, that included respectivley 5 and 11 elements. The element MtPH-M-3-VI showed apparently a mosaic structure, as it contained the 3' subterminal region from
lineage I, while the major portion of the element contained sequence variants chracteristic for the lineage II
(Figure 5).

Five elements were grouped into subfamily MtPH-M-2,
three of them carrying both orf1 and TPase. The region
containing element MtPH-M-2-IIa occurred to be a composite structure of two related TEs. The initially identified
sequence flanked by TIRs and TSDs spanned over 21,696
bp. The 5,303 bp element MtPH-M-2-IIa occupied the 5'
region of that sequence, however the downstream
sequence also contained blocks of homology to the core
element MtPH-M-2-Ia, and a nested insertion of a Gypsylike retrotransposon (Figure 4). It indicates that an ancient
copy of a TE related to those belonging to the subfamily

Family MtPH-A5 was represented by four elements ranging in length from 1,182 to 6,770 bp. The two putative
autonomous elements were 72% similar over the entire
sequence, but within the coding region the nucleotide
sequence similarity reached 95%. Two shorter elements
were deletion derivatives of full-length elements. Interestingly, a recently reported MITRAV family of miniature elements of barrel medic [22] showed a high nucleotide
sequence similarity of their termini to the MtPH-A5 elements, spanning over ca. 40 bp on both ends of the element.

Family MtPH-E consisted of three elements, none of
which carried both ORFs. The elements ranged from
1,508 to 3,957 bp. The two largest elements were very
similar, differing by one indel, while the similarity of the
shortest element to the other two was restricted only to
the 180 bp of the 5' terminus and 70 bp of the 3' terminus.
Family MtPH-D was represented by a single element of
3,160 bp, carrying both ORFs. However, their orientation
was opposite to that of typical PIF/Harbinger-like elements
representing the D lineage [15]. Its localization in the D
lineage was not strongly supported by bootstrap analysis
(Figure 1). The fact that no internally truncated elements
were identified could suggest that the element might be
capable of perfect excision, not triggering the process of
abortive gap repair.
Documentation of the mobility of the mined elements
In order to find evidence for a possible mobility of identified elements we implemented a strategy proposed by Le
et al. [8], i.e. we searched for regions, called RESites
(Related to Empty Sites), paralogous to sequences flanking the insertion sites, but lacking the transposable element. We identified 11 RESites, of which five represented
insertion sites of non-autonomous elements belonging to
the MtPH-A6-4 subfamily, while two and one of them
were related to non-autonomous elements of the MtPHA6-3 and MtPH-A6-2 subfamilies, respectively. The
remaining three RESites represented insertion sites of the
putative autonomous (core) elements belonging to family
MtPH-E and subfamilies MtPH-M-2, and MtPH-M-3 (Figure 6).

We identified several M. truncatula ESTs showing high
similarity to putative expression products (orf1 and

TPase) of the mined autonomous elements (Additional
File 4). However, ESTs directly corresponding to the putative expression products, both to the orf1 (CX532696,
641 bp, 94% identity) and the TPase (AW686181, 304 bp,
99% identity), could be detected only in case of elements
representing the MtPH-M-1 subfamily (Additional File 5).
Interestingly, A number of ESTs similar to non-coding terminal regions of the TEs could also be identified (data not
presented).
The PCR assay of MtPH insertion polymorphism was performed on eight M. truncatula populations selected to represent genetic diversity of the species, as proposed by
Ronfort [31]. Fifty-six insertion sites identified in the reference genome of cv. Jemalong A17 were checked for presence of the TE. Thirty-seven primer pairs yielded products
of the expected size for the reference sample, while 11
generated complex profiles, likely indicating that insertions were present in repetitive regions. The remaining
eight primer pairs produced ambiguous results. Of the 37
successful amplifications, 20 occurred to be polymorphic.
Usually, the size the shorter amplicon corresponded to
the predicted size of the product amplified from the unoccupied site. However, amplicons slightly differing from
the expected size were also observed, indicating a possible
imperfect excision event (Figure 7).

Discussion
We developed a strategy for identification of transposable
element families through in silico genome mining, based
on initial assumptions on the type of transposase and the
consensus sequences of terminal inverted repeats. It
required several consecutive steps, i.e. (1) search for
regions coding for the TPase, (2) identification of TIRs
flanking the identified regions and matching a defined

sequence motif, (3) identification of related elements
with no coding capacity, and (4) grouping the identified
elements into families on the basis of their sequence similarity. We applied this strategy to mine the genome of
Medicago truncatula for PIF/Harbinger-like elements similar to the previously described MtMaster element [14]. In
principle, the proposed strategy can be used to mine for
any other type of class II TEs, provided that at least one
'seed' element is known.
Diversity of the identified PIF/Harbinger-like elements is
high, although our search was limited by a specifically
defined core TIR sequence. We focused on 22 ORFs coding for putative TPases, representing a half of all initially
identified ORFs, as for the other half, TIRs flanking the
ORF and containing the required motif could not be
found. A recent broad analysis of the TE landscape in
another legume, Lotus japonicus [21], revealed a presence

of nine putative autonomous PIF-like elements (besides
several more distantly related Pong-like elements) in ca.
32 Mb portion of the genome. This number is in agrrement with our results, as we found 22 full-length elements
(2.5 times more) in ca. 200 Mb representing a certain level
of redundancy. Interestingly, all PIF-like TEs from L. japonicus represented the A3 lineage, while no A3 members
were identified in M. truncatula, which may indicate a
strikingly different evolutionary fate of that group of TEs
in each of the closely related species.
Detailed structure analysis of the mined element families
indicates that their proliferation in the genome generally
follows the model of abortive gap repair (AGR), as proposed for the Ac/Ds elements in maize [23]. Members of a
particular family were usually direct deletion derivatives
of the related, putative autonomous element. However,
assuming that members of all PIF/Harbinger-like TE fami-

lies in the genome of M. truncatula were mobilized with
similar frequency, the efficiency of AGR seems to vary
from one family to another. Two families, MtPH-A6 and
MtPH-M, were the most numerous, while the remaining
three were represented by a very small number of copies.
Difference in the copy number may be a result of different
transposition rates, but it may also indicate that some elements less efficiently trigger the process of AGR following
excision, which would result in a higher frequency of perfect excision. The latter is further supported by two observations. Firstly, the members of subfamily MtPH-A6-4
contain a variable number of 60 bp tandem repeats in one
or both subterminal regions, serving as targets for AGR
and leading to increase of the TE copy number accompanied by changes in the number of VNTRs. The presence of
60 bp tandem repeats was inherently connected with
MtPH-A6-4 elements throughout the M. truncatula
genome, which implies that they likely evolved in the
course of the proliferation of that subfamily. Probably,
triggering the AGR from the VNTR region also led to an
inversion of the internal region in MtPH-A6-4-XIV, as
compared to MtPH-A6-4-Ia. Secondly, at least one member of the low copy number family MtPH-E was transpositionally active, as confirmed by the presence of the
RESite, but despite the potential for mobility, the number
of MtPH-E elements has remained low.
PIF/Harbinger-like elements are ancestors of certain
groups of miniature transposons (MITEs), the relation of
maize PIF element and MITEs belonging to the Tourist
family has been well documented [12,16]. Also, several
other MITE families, e.g. Heartbreaker from maize [24],
Kiddo from rice [25], and Krak from carrot [14] show TIR
sequence similarities to those of PIF/Harbinger-like elements. We were able to directly link the previously identified MITRAV MITE family [22] to family MtPH-A5 of M.
truncatula PIF/Harbinger-like elements. This suggests that
both MtPH-A5 and MITRAV originated from a recent
common ancestor and MtPH-A5 TPase might be the transacting factor for MITRAV mobilization, as experimentally
proven for the Pong and mPing MITE in rice [13,26,27].
Also, two groups of two and ten TEs, all classified in the
subfamily MtPH-M-3, might represent newly emerging
MITE families. We performed an initial search for other
MITEs showing a TIR homology to the consensus motif of
the PIF/Harbinger TIRs leading to an identification of few
other MITE families (data not presented). Altogether, it
confirms that PIF/Harbinger-like elements and related
MITEs are present in the genome of M. truncatula, similar
to genomes of other plant species. However, the number
of MITE copies is probably much lower than that present
in the grass genomes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/409

useful to further characterize the transpositional activity
and the dynamics of particular families. Analysis of
RESites and a high incidence of insertion related size polymorphisms shows that a significant fraction of the
mined elements was mobile in the recent past. The presence of ESTs related to ORFs of the MtPH elements,
including those directly derived from the MtPH-M-1 elements, suggests that they can still be mobile. As proven
previously, one transcriptionally active autonomous element can cause trans-mobilization of a range of related,
but not directly derived elements [13].
Polymorphic insertion sites could be used as a source of
molecular markers, as shown previously for other species
[28-30], to measure intraspecific diversity in relation to its
geographic structure, complementing other molecular
marker systems, e.g. these based on microsatellites [31].

Conclusion
Starting from a single previously described PIF/Harbingerlike TE of M. truncatula, we identified 89 elements representing the diversity of this superfamily in the host plant
genome. They were divided into five families representing
different evolutionary lineages, and further into subfamilies. Elements within each subfamily evolved essentially following the model of AGR, leading to the
reconstruction of an internally deleted copy in the donor
site following transposition. It is likely that different families vary in their potential to trigger the process of AGR.
One peculiarity observed in a group of elements representing subfamily MtPH-A6-4 was the presence of 60 bp
long VNTRs in one or both subterminal regions or even
spanning over the entire internal region of the TE. Some
of the identified elements are closely related to several
MITE families, including a previously described MITRAV
family. Also, some of the newly identified short elements
can be viewed as in statu nascendi MITEs, provided that
conditions for a rapid burst of their mobility would be
met. Further investigation is necessary for a more detailed
evaluation of the copy number, transpositional activity,
and insertional polymorphism of the TEs, including
MITEs, as they could be utilized as a source of molecular
markers.

Methods
Semi-automated mining of PIF/Harbinger-like elements
The experiment was performed on the M. truncatula
genomic DNA sequence database consisting of 1540
BACs, updated Aug 2005 [32]. As the size of the whole M.
truncatula genome ranges from 500 to 600 Mbp [17] and
the average non-overlapping coverage by each BAC was
ca. 100 Kb [32], we estimated that the input sequence data
amounted 26–30% of whole genome.

A more detailed experimental evaluation of MtPH TEs
diversity in a range of M. truncatula populations should be

The predicted protein sequence of DDE domain and the
whole TPase sequence of the previously identified MtMaster element [14] was used as the initial query for a
TBLASTN search against the BAC sequence database,
using the E-value threshold of 1e-20. The output file was
then processed to eliminate redundancy coming from
overlapping BACs, and significant hits were extracted,
along with up to 30 kb flanking sequences. The extracted
sequences were scanned for the presence TIRs and TSDs,
using a newly developed tool named TIRfinder, identifying TIRs and TSDs and returning a file with a list of found
elements fulfilling user-defined requirements. To provide
fast computation on whole genome, the algorithm uses
very efficient data structures, such as suffix trees. TIRfinder
is an open source software accessible online [33]. The program was written in Java and can be run on Windows or
Linux.
We allowed up to four mismatches inside 14 bp of the
TIRs and no mismatch in TSDs. Another condition was
the presence of the conserved G(N)5GTT motif at the 5'
end of the TIR. In silico prediction of the presence of coding regions was performed for all identified sequences
using FGENESH [34].
To identify internally deleted copies of elements related to
those found previously, 217 bp-long (3 bp TSD + 14 bp
TIR + 200 bp subterminal sequence) terminal regions
were extracted from all putative autonomous elements.
These sequences were used to scan the M. truncatula
genomic DNA sequence database (BLASTN, E-value
threshold – 1e-10), and regions showing homology to any
of the terminal regions were identified. The output was
automatically filtered to find sequences of length ranging
from 400 to 30,000 bp, flanked with TIRs showing
homology to the same autonomous element on both
ends. All newly found sequences have been checked
whether they contained a region coding for the TPase. All
TEs were scanned using Censor [35], to identify the presence of nested elements.
Phylogenetic analyses, grouping, and visualization of TE
sequence similarity
Multiple alignment of 48 transposase sequences of PIF/
Harbinger-like transposable elements was obtained using
T-Coffee [36]. Bootstrap analysis was performed with
PHYLIP using seqboot, neighbor, protdist and consense
programs [37]. The sequence similarity of 89 TEs was analyzed by the hierarchical clustering method and visualized
with help of multidimensional scaling. For both tasks we
used the R statistical environment [38]. As a measure of
dissimilarity between sequences we used the E-value of
BLAST. Hierarchical cluster analysis of a set of dissimilarities was done by hclust (complete linkage) method [39].
Multidimensional scaling [40] visualization is primarily

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/409

dependent on the analogy of similarity and proximity
(and hence of dissimilarity and distance). It re-scales a set
of dissimilarity data into distances and produces the lowdimensional configuration that generated them. The visualization for our data was obtained with isoMDS R procedure.
TE structure analysis
Sequences were visually compared, aligned, edited, and
analysed using BioEdit and the included accessory applications [41]. Pairwise sequence comparisons were performed using 'blast 2 sequences' [42] and Yass [43,44].
Dot-plots were generated using Nucleic Acid Dot Plots
[45] with a window size of 25 nucleotides and a mismatch
limit of 5 positions. Tandem repeats identification was
performed using 'mreps' software [46,47].
Documentation of mobility
In order to find RESites (Related to Empty Sites) in the M.
truncatula genome we performed a computer-based
search, essentially as described by Le et al. [8]. Briefly, we
extracted 1 Kb sequence flanking both sides of each of the
mined elements, combined them into one sequence of 2
Kb, and used it as a query for a BLASTN search on the
whole BAC sequence database. Hits spanning on both
sides of the insertion were considered as those representing RESites.

EST search was performed using nucleotide sequences of
the putative autonomous elements, using a BLAST tool
run against the M. truncatula EST database [48].
PCR conditions
PCR assay was performed on plants representing cv.
Jemalong A17 and seven populations from the core M.
truncatula collection (CC8, as described by Ronfort et al.
[31]). Primer pairs were anchored in the regions flanking
the mined elements. They were designed using Primer3
[49] to obtain amplification of ca. 600 bp long fragment
for the putative empty site. Two cycling protocols were
employed. For TEs of length not exceeding 2 Kb a standard PCR was performed. The reaction was set up in the
volume of 20 µl and contained 0.25 mM each dNTP, 2
mM MgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, 1 unit of TAQ
polymerase (Fermentas) and 2 µl of the PCR buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The thermal profile of the reaction was as followed: 94°C for 2 min., 35 cycles of: 94°C
for 30 s, 53°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 90 s, and completed
with 68°C for 5 min. For larger elements we used long
PCR protocol. Amplification was performed in the volume of 20 µl containing 0.25 mM each dNTP, 10 pmol of
each primer, 0,5 unit of long PCR enzyme mix (Fermentas) and 2 µl of the Long PCR buffer supplemented with
MgCl2 (Fermentas), using the following thermal profile:
94°C for 2 min., 35 cycles of: 94°C for 15 s, 53°C for 30

s, and 68°C for 7 min., and completed with 68°C for 10
min. All reactions were carried out in the Mastercycler or
Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf). Amplification products were separated on 1% agarose gels and visualized
with ethidium bromide under UV.

Identification of M. truncatula ESTs similar to putative expression
products of orf1 and TPases coded by MtPH elements. Sequence of the
whole element was used as query against M. truncatula EST database,
hits in orf1 and TPase coding regions with E value lower than 1e-06 were
scored. Nearly identical hits to orf1 and TPase of the MtPH-M-1 elements
are marked red.
