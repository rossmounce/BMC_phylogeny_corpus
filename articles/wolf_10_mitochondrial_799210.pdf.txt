Abstract
Background: Various lines of evidence demonstrate the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the
pathogenesis of glaucoma. Therefore, mitochondrial DNA is a promising candidate for genetic susceptibility studies
on glaucoma. To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial haplogroups influence the risk to develop glaucoma, we
genotyped 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms that define the European mitochondrial DNA haplogroups in
healthy controls and two German patient cohorts with either exfoliation glaucoma or the normal tension subgroup
of primary open angle glaucoma.
Results: Mitochondrial haplogroup U was significantly under-represented in patients with exfoliation glaucoma
(8.3% compared with 18.9% in controls; p = 0.004).
Conclusions: People with haplogroup U have a lower risk to develop exfoliation glaucoma. Our results
substantiate the suggestion that mitochondrial alterations have an impact on the etiology of glaucoma.

Background
Glaucoma is among the leading causes of blindness in
elderly people of western European ancestry [1]. In the
last ten years a few genes and a number of unsolved
gene loci for open angle glaucoma have been identified
based on the analyses of mendelian forms of glaucoma.
These however only comprise a small fraction of the
total glaucoma patient population. None of these genes
or loci has been shown to have a relevant impact on the
glaucoma population as a whole. The strong hereditary
component in glaucoma most likely results from multigenic inheritance involving multiple susceptibility genes
[2].
Diverse pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed
to be involved in glaucoma including vascular dysregulation, excitotoxicity, autoimmunity and oxidative stress
[3-6]. The latter is relevant to neuronal damage in the
glaucomatous retina and optic nerve head since it triggers mitochondrial dysfunction and leads to retinal

ganglion cell (RGC) death in a cell culture model [7].
The pathogenic role of reactive oxygen species in glaucoma is supported by various experimental findings,
such as an increase of the oxidative stress markers
superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in the aqueous humor of patients with primary
open angle glaucoma and exfoliation glaucoma [8,9]. A
significant correlation between oxidative DNA damage
in the trabecular meshwork and intraocular pressure
(IOP) increase and visual field defects was observed in
glaucomatous patients [10]. In an independent study, a
significant reduction of mitochondrial respiratory function in peripheral blood cells was observed in glaucoma
patients when compared to age-matched healthy controls [11]. Another study showed that the exposure of
RGCs to elevated hydrostatic pressure resembling an
elevated intraocular pressure results in altered mitochondrial fission [12].
The involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in
glaucoma can also be certified by maternal inheritance.
Several studies have shown that a maternal family history is more frequent than a paternal history in glaucoma [13-16] which suggests a contribution of

mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to glaucoma pathogenesis. In fact, an increased frequency of nonsynonymous
mtDNA sequence changes in patients with primary
open angle glaucoma has been shown [17]. However,
this report describes a relatively small number of
patients from a restricted ethnic population and confirmation in other populations is still lacking.
MtDNA is exposed to a higher mutation rate compared to nuclear DNA as it is not protected by histones.
Furthermore, the repair mechanisms in mitochondria
are not as efficient as those in the nucleus [18,19].
Among the numerous mutations that have accumulated
in mtDNA during evolution there are several ethnic specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that
enable the definition of discrete and region specific subdivisions of the human population called mitochondrial
haplogroups (mtHgs). More than 90% of European
mtDNAs belong to nine haplogroups (H, V, U, K, J, T,
W, I and X), which are highly specific for Western Eurasia [20]. Specific mtHgs might reflect functional differences in energy metabolism and were therefore linked
with human diseases like neurodegenerative disorders
[21] or cancer [22]. Polymorphisms in mtDNA might
also represent modifier factors as has been shown in
Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) where
mtHgs contribute to the phenotypic expression of
mtDNA mutations [23-25].
The relationship of mtHg distribution and glaucoma
has not been subject of comprehensive studies so far.
One study was based on the phylogenetic network for
European mtDNA [26]. The authors genotyped 140
patients with primary open angle glaucoma and 75
healthy controls but could not detect a significant difference of mtHgs frequencies between patients and controls [27]. A second study in the Saudi-Arab population
[28] compared the prevalence of region specific mtHgs

in 552 healthy controls with a patient cohort that was
composed of three different glaucoma subtypes (49
patients with primary open angle glaucoma, 29 cases
with primary angle closure glaucoma and 29 cases with
exfoliation glaucoma). Like in the first study, the authors
were not able to identify significant differences between
patients and controls for all mitochondrial haplogroups
tested except for the 29 primary angle closure glaucoma
patients. The authors however admitted that the statistical significance reached for this patient group might
have been accidental due to the small number of cases.
The aim of our study was to evaluate the distribution
of mtHgs in two German cohorts with exfoliation glaucoma (n = 157) and the normal tension subgroup of
primary open angle glaucoma (n = 272). The frequencies of ten common European mtHgs in both cohorts
were compared with those in a control group (n =
249) of German origin.

Results and Discussion
We studied the mitochondrial haplogroup distribution
among 272 patients with the normal tension subgroup
of primary open angle glaucoma (NTG) and 157
patients with exfoliation glaucoma (XFG). Two hundred
and forty-nine individuals matched for age, gender and
ethnicity and with exclusion of glaucoma served as control group.
Ten major European haplogroups (HV, H, I, J, K, T,
U, V, W and X) were observed in both patient groups
and in controls (Table 1). All frequencies observed in
the control group were consistent with previous studies
of European populations [29-31].
When comparing the frequencies of mitochondrial
haplogroups between cases and controls, we observed
that haplogroup U was clearly under-represented in
XFG patients (8.3% compared to 18.9% in controls).

Statistical analysis with Fisher’s exact test revealed that
this difference was significant (p = 0.004).
In NTG patients, haplogroup U was slightly underrepresented (13.2 % compared to 18.9% in controls)
whereas haplogroup T was slightly over-represented
(14.7% compared to 10.8% in controls). However, these
differences were not significant (Table 1). Either mitochondrial haplogroups are not associated with this specific disease entity or NTG is genetically more complex
than XFG and therefore larger sample sizes would be
required to detect subtle differences in the distribution
of mtHgs. As has been shown by Samuels and co-workers [32] subtle changes in haplogroup frequency will
require cohorts that should be at least twice as large as
our patient cohorts. This holds true especially for lowfrequency mtHgs which we excluded a priori from statistical analysis.
There is growing evidence that certain mtHgs are
associated with distinct diseases. In Europe, some
mtHgs have been found to be protective against neurodegenerative diseases. Haplogroups J and K are underrepresented in Parkinson disease [33] and haplogroup U is
underrepresented in female patients with Alzheimer disease [34]. However, the contribution of a specific mitochondrial haplogroup to disease mechanisms is yet
difficult to explain. Whereas it seems unlikely that single
SNPs alter the efficiency of mitochondrial energy production enough to cause a specific disease, there is evidence that certain mtDNA genetic backgrounds can
modify primary mutations: Several independent studies
support a role for haplogroup J in the expression of certain LHON mutations [23-25].
We cannot rule out that other than the genotyped
mtDNA variants are present in our patients as we did
not evaluate the whole mitochondrial genome. Further
studies should focus on this point as it may provide
more insight into the association of mtHgs with
glaucoma.
So far, only two studies dealt with association of
mtHgs and glaucoma, and both are not ideally suited to
be compared with our results. The first study analyzed
patients of British origin [27] and the second focussed
on patients from Saudi Arabia [28]. Due to the different
geographical distribution of mtHgs our results from a
middle European population cannot be directly compared with the study performed in Saudi Arabs. The
British study, on the other hand, focussed on primary
open angle glaucoma patients and not exfoliation glaucoma or normal tension glaucoma.
Apart from the mtHg distribution, our study provides
a second line of evidence that substantiates a possible
involvement of mitochondrial DNA in glaucoma pathogenesis. Within the NTG patients, a maternal history of
glaucoma (17%) is more prevalent than a paternal

Page 3 of 6

history (8%) (data not shown). This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.01). Within the XFG patients,
18% have an affected mother whereas only 10% report
an affected father (data not shown). This difference does
not reach significance level (p = 0.13) but indicates a
higher prevalence for maternal history in XFG glaucoma. Although several sources of bias might influence
these results (recall bias; closer offspring contact with
mothers than fathers; greater life expectancy of females
that increases the rate of affected women in a late onset
disease such as glaucoma), a higher prevalence of maternal history in glaucoma has been reported repeatedly
[13-16] and alternative mechanisms for this observation
(e.g. imprinting) have not yet been identified.
Although the association of haplogroup U with XFG
reached significance level, it is important to point out
that the power of our study is still relatively limited. In
Germany, almost half of any study population belongs
to the predominant haplogroup H, thus limiting the
power to detect an association among the remaining
haplogroups due to a rigorous reduction of these sample
sizes.

Conclusions
Our data indicate that mitochondrial haplogroup U is
associated with a reduced risk to develop exfoliation
glaucoma in the German population. Further studies in
larger cohorts are needed to confirm this observation.
Sequencing the entire mitochondrial genome might lead
to the identification of other than mtHg-defining variants that contribute to the disease phenotype. The
incorporation of data from genome-wide association
studies might reveal synergistic interactions of mtHgs
with other genes.
Methods
Study samples

This study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of
Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from
all subjects and the study was approved by the ethics
committees of the Universities of Tuebingen, Wuerzburg and Erlangen-Nuremberg.
The entire study population comprised 678 subjects of
German origin including 272 patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), 157 patients with exfoliation
glaucoma (XFG) and 249 healthy controls.
The NTG cohort comprised 177 women and 95 men.
The mean age of individuals was 65.0 ± 13.0 years
(median 67 years). NTG was defined by (1) the presence
of typical glaucomatous optic neuropathy with corresponding visual field loss, (2) open drainage angles on
gonioscopy, (3) absence of a secondary cause for glaucomatous optic neuropathy, such as previously elevated
IOP after trauma, a period of steroid administration or

uveitis, and (4) IOP measures of untreated NTG continuously 21 mmHg or lower on repeated diurnal testing
(five readings between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM). The
median of readings was required to be 21 mm Hg or
less, with no reading above 24 mm Hg and no more
than one reading of 23 or 24 mm Hg. IOP readings
were correlated with corneal thickness. Patients did not
have evidence of high myopia or congenital ocular
abnormality and had no other cause than glaucoma for
disc changes and visual field loss. Disc size and parameters were evaluated by confocal examination (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph). To minimize interobserver
variability, more than 95% of patients were examined by
the same ophthalmologist. All patients had a long term
follow-up to ensure diagnosis of NTG with a maximum
of certainty. In large part, NTG patients underwent a
neurological examination to exclude an intracerebral
expansion. Sonography was used to rule out aortic
stenosis.
The XFG cohort comprised 89 women and 68 men.
The mean age in this group was 72.5 ± 8.7 years (median 72 years). All patients diagnosed with exfoliation
syndrome in this study showed manifest exfoliation
deposits in the anterior chamber. All of them met the
criterion of XFG as they showed intraocular pressure
(IOP) exceeding 21 mm Hg and typical glaucomatous
optic neuropathy with compatible visual field loss.
Ethnicity of XFG and NTG patients was assessed for
the last three generations by standardized questionnaire
and self-reporting. Family history information was
obtained from 200 NTG patients and 157 XFG patients.
This information originated from questionnaires completed by the patients themselves.
The control cohort comprised 149 women and 100
men and was matched with the patient cohorts for age,

Page 4 of 6

gender distribution and geographical origin. The average
age in controls was 66.8 ± 13.3 years (median 68 years).
Slit lamp microscopy in mydriasis was performed to
exclude presence of exfoliation deposits on intraocular
tissues. IOPs were in the normal range (<21 mm Hg)
and they had no glaucomatous disc damage. Controls
had no family history of glaucoma.
Isolation of DNA and genotyping

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes
using the Magnetic Separation Module I from Chemagen using DNA chemistry (Chemagic DNA Blood Kit
Special; Chemagen AG, Baesweiler, Germany).
The TaKaRa LA PCR Amplification Kit (Takara Bio
Inc., Shiga, Japan) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol to amplify a 12612 bp fragment of
mtDNA comprising all polymorphic sites that were used
to characterize and distinguish the European haplogroups H, V, HV, U, K, J, T, W, I and X (primers are
given in Table 2). Specific extension primers were
designed to genotype mtHg specific SNPs (Table 2).
Two separate multiplex primer extension reactions
(MPE R1 and MPE R2) each covering 6 informative
SNPs were performed using the ABI PRISM SNaPshot
Multiplex Kit (Applied Biosystems (ABI), Weiterstadt,
Germany). Capillary-based electrophoretic separation of
multiplex primer extension products was performed on
a sequence detection system (ABI 7500). Sequence data
were analyzed using ABI PRISM GeneMapper Software
version 3.7. SNPs for haplogroup typing were selected as
previously reported and are listed in Table 3[35,36].
Haplogroups that could not be assigned to one of the
major European haplogroups with this scheme were
designated as “others” (O).

Statistical analysis

Frequencies of mtHgs in patients and controls were
tested for independence using Fisher’s exact test. Only
mtHgs with a frequency >0.05 were tested. A p-value <
0.05 was considered significant. Multiple testing errors
were corrected by the Bonferroni method. As five
mtHgs were tested and the haplogroup distribution was
compared with the controls among each of the two
glaucoma subgroups, the significance level was reduced
to a = 0.005.
Significance for deviation from a fifty-fifty-distribution
of maternal and paternal disease history was calculated
using a Χ2 test.
