Abstract
Background: The H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus has been involved in severe mortality in
domestic poultry, and has also been found in different species of wildlife in Europe. The Basque
Country avian influenza surveillance program began sample collection and processing the fall of
2005.
Results: Here we report the first confirmation of the presence of highly pathogenic H5N1 strain
in a Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus) found dead in a pond near Vitoria in the Basque
Country on the North of Spain. Regarding the survey for generic influenza type A virus, we have
obtained positive results in about 8% of more that 3500 birds examined.
Conclusion: We think that the self-limiting nature of our finding and others proves that certain
regions have ecological, geographical and climatological features that make it difficult for the H5N1
virus to spread [1] and cause disease at least in the large scale scenario that has been worrying
human and animal health authorities during the last years.

Background
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus has been circulating in different countries since its first detection in
China in 1996 causing severe damages to the fowl industry in some regions. In Europe, it was first detected during
fall of 2005 in Croatia and Romania, according to the
World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). During
2006, it was reported from an important number of countries including Germany, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy,
Sweden and Czech Republic where it was involved in
severe mortality in domestic poultry, and/or in different
species of wildlife. In spite of the Iberian Peninsula being
an important area in migratory routes and holding at
given moments around 300.000 migratory birds, no case
of H5N1 infection had been ever detected. Here we report

the first confirmation of the presence of this viral strain in
a Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus) found dead in a
pond near Vitoria in the Basque Country on the North of
Spain, as well as the results of generic influenza type A
testing in the Basque Country.

Results and discussion
A grebe reportedly found dead in Salburua pond and registered in the laboratory on 30th June 2006, tested positive
(Ct = 39) in a screening step with influenza A type matrix
gene real time reverse transcription PCR (RRT-PCR) using
the primers described by Spackman and others 2002 [2].
Then it was submitted to the H5 and H7 specific RRT-PCR
[2] which came out positive at 29 ct and negative respectively. A H5N1 commercial conventional multiplex RTPage 1 of 5

PCR was run (Veredus Laboratories©) that yielded also a
positive result for H5 and for N1.

viruses found in Italy, Czech Republic and Bavaria in
2006.

At the same time five embryonated Specific Pathogen Free
(SPF) eggs of 9–11 days of incubation were inoculated
with a swab following the OIE recommendations [3,3]. At
24 h postinoculation four embryos out of five died and
only the allantoic fluid of the surviving egg was positive to
slide and plate erythrocyte hemagglutination (HA). After
that, the positive allantoic fluid was tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) to determine the HA subtype [3].
The HI results of the allantoic fluid were negative for H7
and positive at 1/64 to 1/128 dilutions for H5. At 24–48
h postinoculation of a second and third passage of the surviving embryo, the allantoic fluids were collected and
tested for HA and HI, and all of them were positive with
H5 reference positive serum. Also, the five SPF eggs allantoic fluids of the first passage were submitted to conventional RT-PCR A type [4] and H5 subtype (Avian Influenza
European Reference Laboratory, Weybridge) that yielded
positive results in all cases.

A sample was also sent to the Spanish National Reference
Laboratory (SNRL) for official confirmation.

The haemagglutinin and neuraminidase PCR products
were sequenced [5] and the partial sequences deposited in
GenBank (Accession numbers: EU636810 and
EU636811). Its high pathogenicity was first determined
by a conventional PCR based in the protocol described by
Payungporn and others in 2006 [6], and after that by the
study of the sequence of the cleavage site
(GERRRKKR*GLF) that characterised this strain as of
highly pathogenic.
The sequences obtained were compared with those
already available in GenBank database by nucleotide
sequence homology searches made at the network server
of the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) using BLAST. Multiple sequence alignments were
performed using the program AlignX (Vector NTI 8.0
suite, InforMax, North Bethesda, MD, USA) with an
engine based on the ClustalW algorithm [7]. Finally
sequences extending from nucleotide 1 to 562 of the HA
gene (EU636811) and from nucleotide 60 to 845 of the
NA gene (EU636810) were included in the analysis. Similarity matrices were then constructed from aligned
sequence data by the Kimura's two-parameter model [8].
Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbour
joining method [9] as implemented in the Mega 4 package [10] (Figure 1). Stability or accuracy of inferred topologies were assessed via bootstrap analysis of 1000
replicates.
These phylogenetic analyses showed that the great crested
grebe virus isolated in the Basque Country belongs to the
Asian H5N1 HPAI virus lineage. The closest relatives are

Regarding the survey for generic influenza type A virus, we
have obtained positive results in about 8% of all wild bird
samples examined. None of them were positive in the H5
or H7 RRT-PCR excluding the Great Crested Grebe case.
Currently we are sequencing these positive samples in
order to determine influenza virus subtype (data not
shown).
The results of our investigation as confirmed by the SNRL
have been officially registered by OIE as the first cases of
the H5N1 avian influenza subtype in the Iberian Peninsula. It is very striking that it has first been detected in the
Basque Autonomous Community which according to
Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food data
holds only 3% of the migratory birds in Spain and has
processed less than 4% (3,2–3,5%) of the samples examined in the whole country. Great Crested Grebe are
regarded as sedentary in the Basque Autonomous Community with 47 breeding pairs and 240 wintering birds
registered in 2006 census [11,12].
Our results on type A influenza virus prevalence in wild
birds are in agreement with estimates from some authors
[13]. However, they seem to disagree with others [14] in
the sense that we have found around ten times more positives than those reported.
All these disagreements are difficult to explain and require
a closer study. One possible explanation is that our extraction method has a higher sensitivity to detect low levels of
virus as we use a larger fraction of the total amount of
available sample than other protocols [14]. Other reasons
that might contribute are poor sample preservation and
transport imposed by the larger dispersion and distances
of sampling locations with respect to the laboratory
processing the samples, and less likely, absence of this
virus in the larger wetlands in central and south Spain.
In relation as to how this Great Crested Grebe became
infected the most likely hypothesis is contact with subclinical anatid carriers as wild ducks have demonstrated
that they can excrete virus without showing clinical signs.
[15]. On the other hand, it could be possible that the
grebe became infected in another European country and
after that arrived to Salburua pond to feather moult,
where it died. Some water birds undergo a moult migration moving to sites where they are lower risk of predation
and have food enough. Such movements generally occur
between late June and August with timing variations

attending species and region [16]. Another unlikely alternative is arrival through commercial duck imports since
an unconfirmed H5 result was reported a few months
before in a neighbouring region [17].
Anyway, it is worth to point that according to European
Union annual reports http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/
diseases/adns/index_en.htm, this case, which seems to be
the most south-westerly case in Europe, could represent a
change of host species and seasonality, since it was one of
the first cases in a grebe that was followed in 2007 by 269
cases (87.3% of wild birds cases) all throughout Europe in
summer. Up to then the most affected species were swans
(62.9%) and the predominant season winter.
On the other hand the criteria of considering the generic
matrix RRT-PCR as a screening on whose results decide
whether or not to submit the samples to further more specific testing needs to be reviewed, as some laboratories
only accept positive results under Ct 36 [14] and can also
contribute to overlooking earlier cases of H5N1 infection
in wild birds.
We think that surveillance needs to be increased and the
methods reviewed. Lack of striking increases in mortality
supports the hypothesis that the virus is widely spread
among subclinical carriers probably of the anatidae family
and that only sporadically it reaches more susceptible species where some mortality occurs. For wild birds, given its
over-dispersion and lack of close contact, these cases are
probably rare and self-limiting. If the virus happens to
reach a domestic bird's farm, the spread will be massive
and will cause high mortality. Lack of such episodes in
Spain indicates that farms have enough biosecurity measures in place, although there were no commercial farms in
the 3 Km protection area or the 10 Km surveillance area
around where this case was detected. The biggest risk of
human infection seems to be highly limited not to wild
birds' infection, but to domestic large outbreaks and in situations of animal-human very close contact and probably
also high humidity and other host predisposing factors.

dead but also in a lower number taken to recovery centres
or trapped for ringing. Samples consist of 1 to 3 cloacal
swabs soaked in virus transport media and serum whenever possible. Dead animals of anatidae and other aquatic
species are submitted to post-mortem examination if not
too autolytic.
The standard testing strategy, also applied to the grebe,
was to cut the swab in two, freeze and store one half, and
wash the other in 500 μl TE (ph:8) to recover any virus
present. The whole 500 μl are submitted to RNA extraction with Qiagen RNeasy® Mini Kit using 35 μl of RNAsefree water to elute RNA in the final step. The first detection
step is a screening with influenza A type matrix gene RRTPCR and if there is the slightest increase over the positive
control defined-threshold, an H5 and H7 subtype specific
RRT-PCR is performed with the remaining RNA [2]. Once
H5 is confirmed in this PCR, a H5N1 conventional multiplex RT-PCR is run (Veredus Laboratories©). All reactions
are set up with 5 μl of the final RNA solution. Thus,
approximately one fourteenth of the total amount of the
original cloacal swab is included in each RRT-PCR reaction.
