Abstract
Background: Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly
conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target
gene in the region. The target genes are most often transcription factors involved in embryonic
development and differentiation. GRBs often contain extensive gene deserts, as well as additional
'bystander' genes intertwined with HCNEs but whose expression and function are unrelated to
those of the target gene. The tight regulation of target genes, complex arrangement of regulatory
inputs, and the differential responsiveness of genes in the region call for the examination of
fundamental rules governing transcriptional activity in GRBs. Here we use extensive CAGE tag
mapping of transcription start sites across different human tissues and differentiation stages
combined with expression data and a number of sequence and epigenetic features to discover these
rules and patterns.
Results: We show evidence that GRB target genes have properties that set them apart from their
bystanders as well as other genes in the genome: longer CpG islands, a higher number and wider
spacing of alternative transcription start sites, and a distinct composition of transcription factor
binding sites in their core/proximal promoters. Target gene expression correlates with the
acetylation state of HCNEs in the region. Additionally, target gene promoters have a distinct
combination of activating and repressing histone modifications in mouse embryonic stem cell lines.
Conclusions: GRB targets are genes with a number of unique features that are the likely cause of
their ability to respond to regulatory inputs from very long distances.

Background

It has been demonstrated recently that the loci of many key
developmental regulatory genes are spanned by arrays of

highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs) [1,2]. Many
of these HCNEs function as long-range enhancers [3,4], collaboratively contributing to specific regulation of given target

genes [2-5]. We have shown that the regions of most anciently
preserved synteny in vertebrates [6] and insects [7] are due to
the requirement to keep such arrays of HCNEs in cis to their
target genes. This has led us to formulate the concept of
genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), which are functional regulatory units on a chromosome that are spanned by HCNEs
and contain the gene regulated by HCNEs (the target gene).
Those HCNE arrays often span large genomic regions of low
gene density (gene deserts), but are in other instances found
in the introns of, or beyond, unrelated neighboring genes
(which we will refer to as 'bystander genes') that are kept in
synteny with the target gene by virtue of being intertwined
with the target gene's regulatory elements: this synteny lockin can be escaped by the bystander gene after whole-genome
duplication and subsequent rediploidization as seen in teleost
fish genomes [6,8] (Figure 1a). The functions and expression
patterns of bystander genes are unrelated to those of the target gene, suggesting that they are unresponsive to the regulatory input of HCNEs [6,7,9].

sponding target gene. One of the fundamental unanswered
questions about gene regulation in GRBs is what mechanisms
underlie the differential responsiveness of promoters of target and bystander genes to long-range regulation. We have
demonstrated recently that differential responsiveness in
Drosophila may be due to different types of core promoters
[7]. In the case of genes inhabiting vertebrate GRBs, the existence of an equivalent distinction on the level of core promoter
sequence is not so obvious. Both the developmentally regulated target genes and the neighboring, broadly expressed
bystanders have core promoters that, in most cases, lack a
TATA box and overlap CpG islands - segments of genome that
are rich in CpG dinucleotides as opposed to general depletion
of CpG dinucleotides in the rest of vertebrate genome
sequence [11,12]. These core promoters are of the 'broad' type
[13], characterized by the absence of a well-defined single
transcription start site (TSS); instead, the transcription from
them can start from multiple sites within a range of several
dozen to several hundred nucleotides.

GRB target genes are among the genes with the most complex
spatiotemporal expression patterns during development and
differentiation, and this is controlled by long-range regulatory interactions [4,5,10]. Zebrafish transgenesis assays [10]
have shown that an enhancer trap that contains a reporter
gene downstream of the core promoter of gata2 (a GRB target
itself), when integrated anywhere into a GRB, responds to its
long-range regulatory elements in the manner of the corre-

In this work we set out to investigate general transcriptional
initiation properties of genes in genomic regulatory blocks,
including differences in expression and promoter structure
between the target and bystander genes in GRBs, and to discuss possible underlying causes for their differential responsiveness. We approach this by analyzing the properties of CpG
island promoters of target and bystander genes to discover
key differences that might be related to their differential

responsiveness to long-range regulation. To define promoter
architecture and subtype, we accurately map the TSSs and
promoters of human genes using CAGE (cap analysis of gene
expression) tag data [14,15] from a number of different
expression contexts (over 20 different tissues, including
embryonic tissues) produced in two most recent FANTOM
projects ([13,14] and [16]). CAGE tag data yield a large
number of short sequence tags corresponding to 5' ends of
capped PolII RNA transcripts [14]. CAGE tags mapped to the
genome paint a picture of TSS usage in different expression
contexts. We examine the TSS properties of GRB target genes
and bystander genes, and investigate transcriptional initiation events across a number of tissue-specific libraries and
one time-course differentiation experiment. The time series
experiment we used for this consists of six time points
between 0 and 96 h of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA)-stimulated THP1 cells, modeling macrophage differentiation [16]; it is the only CAGE-based time series experiment to date. The genome-wide histone acetylation data
obtained in the same differentiation time-course allowed us
to correlate the chromatin status of bystanders, targets and
HCNEs with target gene expression. Our hypotheses can be
summarized as follows: the apparently different responsiveness of GRB target genes and their immediate neighbors to
(long-range) regulatory inputs will be reflected in the absence
of correlation in expression between targets and bystander
genes; HCNEs acting as enhancers of target genes at a particular point in time and space should have the corresponding
chromatin domains in active state when they drive the
expression of the target gene, which should be reflected by the
presence of the corresponding epigenetic signatures; different responsiveness to long-range regulatory inputs will be
reflected in different structural properties of the two classes
of genes, that is, promoter organization and promoter
sequence.

start sites, determined in a 'conventional' way. We grouped
CAGE tags into TCs when they overlapped by at least 1 bp and
mapped to the same strand (see Materials and methods; Figure 1b); the goal of this clustering was for each cluster to correspond to an individual core promoter. Since many of the
clusters were of the broad type [13], we chose the most frequently used CAGE TSS (CTSS) position (that is, the one supported by the highest number of tags) as the reference
position of the cluster. TCs and their close surrounding
genomic regions containing binding sites for the components
of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) are regarded as core promoters; core promoters by definition do not contain tissuespecific or other context-specific binding sites, even though in
rare known cases this may be possible. Individual, distinct
TCs some distance apart are taken to correspond to separate,
alternative promoters [13,17]. We then analyzed the distribution of TCs around four sets of genes. Set 1 comprises GRB
target genes (see Materials and methods). Set 2 comprises
bystander genes in GRBs; the comparison of their transcriptional properties in comparison with nearby GRB target
genes is one of the main motivations for this study). Set 3
comprises other CpG island-overlapping genes outside GRBs;
since most GRB target and bystander genes have CpG islandtype promoters, genes elsewhere in the genome with the same
general type of promoters should provide a general picture of
their typical behavior). Set 4 comprises other (non-GRB, nontarget) transcription factor (TF) genes; since most GRB target
genes are TFs [1], this set serves as a control to exclude the
possibility that certain transcriptional properties of GRB
genes are actually general properties of TF genes.

Our results reveal that target and bystander gene expression
is decoupled by means of their different responsiveness to
long-range regulatory inputs, and that expression of target
genes, unlike bystanders, is significantly associated with
acetylation of anciently conserved HCNEs within the corresponding GRB. Furthermore, GRB targets are encompassed
by a high density of CpG islands and have a complex promoter
structure with distinct motif content. These observations provide further insight into the HCNE mediated long-range regulation of genes at the core of the regulation of animal
multicellularity.

Results
Promoters of GRB target genes have complex
distribution of transcription start sites
We identified a set of 269 putative GRB target genes (see
Materials and methods; Additional data file 1). A visual
inspection of prominent GRB targets quickly revealed that
they have a high density of tag clusters (TCs) around their

Volume 10, Issue 4, Article R38

Akalin et al. R38.3

The average density of TCs in 4,000 bp windows centered on
the most frequently used CTSSs revealed that GRB target
genes have a wider distribution compared to bystander genes,
other CpG island genes and other TFs (Figure 2). Similarly,
GRB target genes had significantly higher TC counts in the
4,000 bp window around most used CTSSs (Wilcoxon test, pvalue < 2.2e-16; Figure S1 in Additional data file 2). To ensure
that this trend was not due to expression level difference
between two sets of genes or fragmentation of the TCs due to
undersampling or low expression, we compared the CAGE
expressions in 4,000 bp windows around the most used
CTSSs of target and bystander genes. We found that
bystander gene expression was significantly higher than target gene expression (p-value = 0.0026, Wilcoxon test; Figure
S2 in Additional data file 2). If lower expression of target
genes caused undersampling of targets relative to bystanders,
with resulting fragmentation of large target gene TCs into
many smaller TCs, the average distance between adjacent TCs
associated with target genes would be smaller compared to
bystanders. However, the difference in distribution of distances was not significant (p-value = 0.07, Wilcoxon test; Figure S3 in Additional data file 2), and even showed a trend for
distances between target gene TCs to be slightly larger. Therefore, lower expression of targets does not result in TC fragmentation artifacts, excluding this as a possible cause of the

the fact that TCs of targets span a wider region around the
most used CTSS (Figures 1 and 2), there might be more variation in the choice of alternative TSSs in target genes.

GRB target gene promoters are characterized by a
distinct collection of putative transcription factor
binding sites
In order to clearly define the extent of the TC density, and
thus the extent of CTSSs, we clustered the CAGE tags by proximity (see Figure 4 for an illustration of this clustering
approach). Our strategy differs from the original 'TC' clustering method in that it uses a distance threshold to define the
extent of the cluster, rather than direct overlap of CAGE tags
(see Materials and methods for details).

observed high number of TCs around target genes. Instead,
the high density of TCs points to a possible higher usage of
alternative promoters in GRB target genes. To confirm this
hypothesis using an independent data source, we counted
how many different Ensembl transcript start sites were covered by TCs, in bystander and target genes. Although GRB
target genes did not have a significantly different number of
distinct Ensembl start sites compared to bystanders (p-value
= 0.149 Wilcoxon test), the maximum distance between distinct Ensembl start sites was significantly larger on average
(Wilcoxon test, p-value = 0.0121; Figure 3). It seems that
alternative promoters of the target genes are, on average,
more widely spaced than those of bystanders. Combined with

ers overlap with each other (Figure 4 and Materials and methods). We analyzed the transcription factor binding site
(TFBS) content of these top-level promoters for bystander
and target genes using JASPAR TFBS matrix profiles [18] (see
Materials and methods). We also compared GRB target gene
promoters with the set of promoters that overlap CpG islands
but are not in a GRB or close to any region of high HCNE density (set 3 above). Our analysis indicated that GRB target promoters have an over-representation of homeobox, MADS and
forkhead motifs (Table 1). However, all these motifs are ATrich, which may not seem intuitive since both the target set
and background sets are GC- and CpG-rich (see CpG results
section). Although 93.6% of the target genes overlap with a
CpG island, their most used promoters may not necessarily
fully fall within those CpG islands. To check for such possible
bias in AT composition, we performed a second comparison
of target and background sets, but this time only considered
promoters that were fully covered by CpG islands. Again, we
found that the target set was enriched for similar AT-rich
motifs such as Nkx2-5 and MEF2A in both comparisons
(Table S1 in Additional data file 2). To further validate our
results, we repeated the motif over-representation analysis
using Clover [19], as well as the original over-representation
method combined with phylogenetic foot-printing with
mouse (Tables S2 and S3 in Additional data file 2) on the
same background and target sets. Both approaches resulted

in a similar set of over-represented AT-rich motifs, including
Nkx2-5, FOXL1, and Pdx1. Taken together, these findings
indicate genuine AT-rich motif enrichment in CpG-rich promoters of GRB target genes.

GRB targets are often spanned by multiple long CpG
islands with high CpG content
Inspection of GRBs in a genome browser quickly reveals that
many GRB target genes overlap with long CpG islands, and
often with several of them. These CpG islands are not limited
to the 5' end of the genes, but also occur in introns or internal
exons of the gene; in some cases, the entire target gene is
spanned by one or several CpG islands (see Figure 5 for examples). Since most CpG islands normally map to promoters and
are usually the targets of regulation by methylation [11,12,20],
this arrangement is rather unusual. These CpG islands are the
same ones recently shown to coincide with genomic regions
bound by repressor Polycomb group proteins [21]. We
mapped CpG islands to bystander genes, target genes and TFs
not predicted to be GRB targets (gene set 4 described above),
and compared their total CpG island length, count and CpG
island length to gene length ratio; 94% of the GRB target
genes and 75% of the bystanders overlapped with at least one
CpG island.

Another interesting feature of the GRB target promoters is
that their corresponding mouse orthologs were mostly classified as 'bivalent promoters' in embryonic stem cells by
Mikkelsen et al. [22]. Bivalent promoters have both repressive (H3K27me3) and active (H3K4me3) histone modifications in their promoter region. Around 70% (189 of 269) of
GRB target orthologs have both repressive and active histone
modifications in the reported system. Unsurprisingly, bivalent promoters are most often associated with developmental
genes with high CpG density [22]. In contrast, only 13% of
bystander gene orthologs are classified as bivalent (p-value <
2.2e-16, proportion test).

Gene expression in GRBs: expression of target genes is
uncorrelated to that of bystanders

CpG islands

Figure 5
Examples of CpG islands covering target and bystander genes
Examples of CpG islands covering target and bystander genes. Compared
to bystander genes, target genes are typically covered by more and longer
CpG islands (green rectangles). Genes are depicted in blue structures
showing exon-intron configuration.

Furthermore, target genes have a significantly larger total
CpG island length compared to bystanders, non-target TFs
and other CpG island genes (all p-values << 0.05). The comparisons of CpG island count and CpG island length to gene
length ratio showed similar differences (Figure 6; Table S4 in
Additional data file 2).
Also, the density of CpG dinucleotides was elevated around
the most used TSS of the target genes. We calculated the
observed/expected ratio of CpG dinucleotides, a standard
method to predict CpG islands, for the [-4000,+4000] bp
regions around the most used CTSS of target genes, bystander
genes, other CpG islands and non-target TFs. In all comparisons, the CpG ratio in the window of interest was higher for
target genes (Figure 7). This suggests there is an intrinsic difference in nucleotide composition of GRB target promoters
compared to various backgrounds.

Studies on individual target genes and their bystanders have
shown that those genes have different spatiotemporal expressions during embryonic development [6,7]. At present, there
is no suitable dataset to use for comprehensive quantitative
comparison of target and bystander genes in developing
embryos. However, since a subset of GRB target genes shows
distinct temporal patterns in individual tissues and differentiating cell lines, such systems can still be used to assess
expression correlation of targets and other genes in GRBs.
The FANTOM4 project produced CAGE data and Illumina
hg6v2 microarray expression data for one such time series
[16]. We compared the expression profiles of target and
bystander genes in three biological replicates of THP1 cells
modeling macrophage differentiation in the 10-time-point
time-course, spanning 0-96 h of differentiation of THP1 cells
into macrophages in vitro. We found that 47% of the GRB target genes and 55% of bystanders were expressed in all the
three replicates in at least one time point. However, when we
correlated the expression profiles of targets and bystanders
for each GRB, there were only 1% significantly correlated target-bystander pairs (Table 2). For this analysis, we only considered the correlation pairs that were significant in all
replicates.
An equivalent analysis for within-GRB bystander pairs
showed that around 2% of the gene pairs had significantly
correlated expression profiles (Table 3), but the correlation
coefficient histograms (Figure S4 in Additional data file 2)
show a trend toward a higher level of positive correlation,
resulting in a left-skew (Table 4). This suggests that there is
more positive correlation between bystander genes within a
GRB than between the target gene and surrounding
bystander genes. This was also evident when we compared
the correlation coefficient distributions by a bootstrap Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or Wilcoxon test with the alternative
hypothesis that bystander-bystander correlations were
greater than target-bystander correlations. The bootstrap
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gave significant p-values for all
replicates (Figure S5 in Additional data file 2). Furthermore,
we checked the statistical relationship between target expression and bystander expression. The number of expressed and

expression of targets (p-value = 0.1928, Fisher's exact test;
Table S5 in Additional data file 2).
To test the hypothesis that target genes are expressed in a
time-specific manner, we examined the variation in expression level of target and bystander genes across the timecourse experiment. If target genes tended to be expressed
only at specific time points, this would be evident by larger
variation of expression in the time-course experiment, compared to genes that were constitutively expressed. We found
that targets expressed in macrophage-differentiation showed

significantly higher variation than expressed bystander genes
in all time-course replicates (replica 1 p-value = 2.144e-05,
replica 2 p-value = 4.781e-05, replica3 p-value = 5.169e-06,

requirement for promoter activity [23,24]. For the macrophage differentiation time-course described above, we analyzed H3K9 acetylation data for the 0 and 96th hours of
differentiation to compare the acetylation state of target
genes versus bystanders. First, we clustered acetylation sites
into acetylation islands (see Materials and methods for
details). Then, analogously to previous studies [23], we partitioned the genome into promoter, intergenic and intragenic
regions. Next, we looked at the expressed and unexpressed
GRB targets and whether or not they had promoter acetylation. As expected, the promoters of expressed GRB targets
and bystanders were more frequently acetylated than those of
unexpressed GRB targets and bystanders (two-sided Fisher's
exact test p-value = 2.357e-12 for targets, and two-sided
Fisher's exact test p-value < 2.2e-16 for bystanders; Tables S6
and S7 in Additional data file 2).
Next we analyzed the acetylation of human:zebrafish and
human:chicken HCNEs, and found that GRBs of expressed
targets contained one or more acetylated HCNEs more frequently than the GRBs of unexpressed targets (two-sided pvalue = 0.0005741 for human:zebrafish HCNEs; p-value =
0.00125 for human:chicken HCNEs; Fisher's exact test;
Tables S8 and S9 in Additional data file 2). In contrast, the
presence of (one or more) acetylated HCNEs in the GRB was
not associated with bystander gene expression, using the
same test (Tables S10 and S11 in Additional data file 2). In
addition, the proportion of acetylated HCNEs among all
HCNEs in GRBs of expressed target genes was significantly

higher than the similar proportion for GRBs of unexpressed
targets (Zebrafish HCNE p-value= 1.545e-09 and chicken
HCNE p-value= 1.326e-11, proportion test). Out of the
acetylated HCNEs, 40% of human:zebrafish HCNEs and 34%
of human:chicken HCNEs were intergenic. This indirectly
shows that the acetylation status of both intergenic and
intronic HCNEs is associated with the expression of the associated target gene.

Discussion

This study provides a detailed survey of promoter properties
of GRB targets and offers insight into their behavior during a
differentiation time-course. GRB target genes show evidence
of the existence of multiple promoters that span a large region
when compared to several other gene sets. Multiple promoters might be instrumental in achieving the level of regulatory
complexity characteristic of these target genes, which have
the most complex spatiotemporal expression patterns of all
metazoan genes [25,26]. Other striking features of the target
genes are the long CpG islands that sometimes cover the
whole gene (Figure 5), and a higher density of CpG dinucleotides around their most frequently used CTSS. Both the CpG
island length and the existence of multiple promoters sets the
target genes apart from other sets of genes, including genes in
their immediate neighborhood with conserved synteny
(bystander genes), other genes with CpG island promoters,
and non-GRB target transcription factor genes.

The skewness of correlation coefficient distributions for target-bystander gene pairs and for bystander pairs in the same GRB are shown. The
skewness of distributions was calculated separately for each replicate. In all the cases, we observed more negative skew (left-skew) in bystander pair
correlations.

Based on our previous whole-genome analyses [13], it is reasonable to expect a correlation between the number of TCs
and CpG island length or CpG dinucleotide density, but the
differences go deeper than that. Even though no CpG methylation is observed in Drosophila species, the increased CpG
dinuclotide density trend has also been observed in developmental genes having promoters with stalled RNA PolII in
Drosophila melanogaster embryos [27], the authors suggesting that stalling occurs in developmentally important genes
only, in order to achieve rapid expression. Furthermore, the
motif content of the target gene promoter regions is different
from that of the bystanders and other CpG islands. We
detected an over-representation of Forkhead family motifs
along with Nkx2-5, MEF2A and SRY. Most of these motifs are
bound by TFs that are GRB targets themselves. Forkhead TFs
are major players in development: in the absence of Foxa2,
mouse embryos can not develop further than embryonic day
8.5 and they lack notochord [28]. In addition, Nkx2-5 is
essential for heart development [29] and MEF2A is required
for somite development and hedgehog signaling in zebrafish
[30] as well as vascular development in mammals [31].
Transgenesis [32] and enhancer trapping [6,10] experiments
in zebrafish embryos showed previously that targets and
bystanders have different spatiotemporal expression patterns. Here we have shown that the expression of target and
bystander genes is also uncorrelated in a cell differentiation
time course. Furthermore, we have provided support for the
hypothesis that expressions of target genes are dependent on
long-range enhancer input by showing that HCNEs having
active chromatin domains are significantly associated with
the expression of the target gene, consistent with being in an
'active' state and able to serve as regulatory inputs by binding
TFs.
The distinct response of the target genes and their dependency on long-range regulation might be explained by the distinct motif content and sequence composition of their
promoters. We showed recently that GRB target genes in
Drosophila differ from the neighboring genes in the type and
motif content of their core promoters [7], which might
explain their differential responsiveness to long-range regulation. A similar mechanism, involving the motifs we have
found to be over-represented in core promoters in this work,
might play an analogous role in differential responsiveness in

vertebrates. The existence of multiple promoters with multiple potential enhancers (HCNEs) suggests that there may
exist many different promoter-enhancer pairings for the
same gene. This might help achieve rapid activation by promoting expression from a number of promoters simultaneously or, alternatively, the high number of possible pairings
may also provide robustness to the expression of target genes
and allow for very precise and refined spatiotemporal patterns in different functional contexts. Since GRB target genes
are central to developmental regulation, their expression
should be robust and tightly coordinated even under varying
external conditions. Most obviously, a large number of different promoter-enhancer pairings is needed because these
genes have many different roles in time and space that require
a complex switchboard of regulatory inputs arranged in a
GRB.

Conclusions

Target genes within genomic regulatory blocks have distinct
properties when compared to their neighboring bystander
genes and different background gene sets. These properties
can be summarized as follows (Figure 8): wide TC distribution around the TSS, indicating possible multiple promoter
usage; large CpG islands sometimes spanning the entire gene;

ground sets (bystander genes, other CpG island genes and
other TFs), we used sampling without replacement and sampled target set-sized samples again 1,000 times.

While the exact molecular mechanism of differential responsiveness remains unknown, the above properties enable identification of key regulatory features of genes responsive to
long range regulation by HCNEs and provide a guide to monitoring their activity on multiple levels. Additionally, GRB target gene regulation is different from bystanders and possibly
dependent on input from HCNEs even in terminal myeloid
differentiation.

Materials and methods
Determination of genomic regulatory blocks and their
gene content
We designated the putative GRB target genes as the human
TFs that were under a HCNE density peak and whose
orthologs were in conserved synteny with an array of HCNEs
in human:zebrafish alignments. Density peaks and syntenic
regions were downloaded from the Ancora Genome Browser
[33]. After retrieving the target genes, we located the overlapping human-zebrafish synteny blocks. Synteny blocks were
defined by joined zebrafish (danRer5) to human (hg18) high
scoring (level 1) net alignments obtained from the UCSC
Genome Browser [34]. We joined neighbor net alignments if
they were separated by at most 450 kb in human and 150 kb
in zebrafish. If multiple synteny blocks overlapped with the
target gene - for example, in the case of zebrafish paralogs we took the union of those synteny blocks as the primary synteny block to be used in the analysis. Following this procedure, we retrieved all other Ensembl genes within those
synteny blocks, and labeled them 'bystander' genes. For
HCNE-acetylation analysis, we excluded GRBs that contained
multiple plausible target genes with different expression status (see the section 'Acetylation site clustering and analysis'
for details). Some of those excluded blocks harbored tandemly duplicated target genes, and in other cases two apparently separate GRBs could not be separated on the basis of
zebrafish:human synteny.

CAGE TC density in promoter regions
To calculate CAGE tag mapping densities, we combined
FANTOM3 [14] and FANTOM4 CAGE tags. We only considered uniquely mapping tags, and during the clustering of tags
into TCs we included clusters having at least one CTSS supported by at least two tags. For each TC we defined a representative location (supported by the highest number of tags
per million). We calculated the density of TCs using a sliding
window of 250 bp and a step size of 50 bp over a 4,000 bp
region around the most used CTSS. We only considered TCs
mapping to the sense strand of the gene. When calculating the
error bars for targets we used sampling with replacement and
sampled target set size samples 1,000 times and calculated
the 90% confidence interval for the average TC density for
each window. When calculating the error bars for other back-

CAGE tag clustering to top-level clusters and mapping
to genes
The rationale of top-level clusters is to cluster CAGE tags
based on the overlap of pre-defined core promoters. The clustering method is illustrated in Figure 4. First, in order to
define top-layer TSS clusters for the genes, we excluded the
singleton CTSS. Then, we extended each CTSS -300 bp and
+100 bp. This corresponds to the core promoters for each
CTSS. The overlapping core promoters of CTSSs mapping on
the same strand formed so called 'top-level clusters'. Toplevel clusters were mapped to genes in the following way. If
the top-level cluster is in 500 bp proximity of a 5' end of an
Ensembl transcript (Ensembl release 49 [34]) on the same
strand, the top-level cluster/top-level promoter was mapped
to that gene. If many top-level clusters were mapped to the
same gene, we chose the one with the highest expression
(number of supporting CAGE tags) as the representative one.

Transcription factor binding site over-representation
analysis
Putative TFBSs matching top-level promoters of bystanders
and targets were extracted using Perl scripts and modules
based on TFBS modules [35]. We used an 80% score cut-off
and JASPAR position weight matrices when determining the
hits. For each top-level cluster, we normalized the number of
TFBS hits by the length of the cluster. We used a random sampling approach to assess the significance of the normalized
total number of hits in target top-level promoters compared
to bystander top-level promoters. We did this by randomly
sampling target set-sized sets from a total set of promoters
that included all promoters from the background sets (either
bystander genes or other CpG island genes) and the target
genes, and calculated the length-normalized total number of
hits for each random set. We sampled 10,000 random sets
with replacement and for each TFBS, we calculated the
number of sets with equal or higher value to the original total
hit count divided by 10,000. This gave the significance of the
hits for each TFBS in the target promoter set. We also measured the significance of the number of sequences in the target
promoter set having a certain TFBS motif. Again we used a
random sampling approach with replacement to assess the
significance. This time we counted the number of random sets
that had a higher or equal number of sequences containing
that TFBS hit. Again we calculated the p-value by dividing this
number by the number of random sets. In order to call a TFBS
motif in the target promoters significantly over-represented,
both p-values had to be lower than 0.01. For the phylogenetic
fooprinting approach, we extracted the orthologous mouse
region for each promoter from the UCSC genome browser
human-mouse NET alignment [36], and then searched the
alignments for TFBS motifs using an 80% score cut-off and an
80% identity cut-off.

We also used the Clover [19] algorithm to detect TFBS motif
over-representation. Clover is based on averaging likelihood
ratios for sequences rather than counting motif hits. We considered motifs as over-represented in the target gene promoters compared to the bystander background set and the 'other
CpG island gene' background set when the p-value was lower
than 0.05 in both comparisons.

correlation using the alternative hypothesis that the association was positive. We also calculated the correlations of
bystanders with each other for each GRB. For comparison of
bystander pairs, we excluded the pairs potentially sharing a
bidirectional promoter, since we expect them to be co-regulated [39]. We defined bidirectional promoter genes as genes
on the opposite strands that had an Ensembl TSS in 1,000 bp
proximity of each other. For the correlation and significance
tests we used the cor.test function in R. The p-values were
corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini-Yekutieli false
discovery rate correction from the multtest package in R.

CpG island and CpG score analysis of GRBs
We downloaded CpG island locations from the UCSC Genome
Table Browser [36] and Ensembl gene boundaries from
Biomart (Ensembl release 49) [37]. We extracted all CpG
islands that overlapped with our genes of interest (target,
bystander and other TF genes); additionally, we randomly
selected 3,000 genes that were not GRB targets but overlapped CpG islands (other CpG island genes set). We removed
the TFs that were also GRB targets from the set of other TFs.
Our initial TF gene set was based on the set described in
Vaquerizas et al. [38]. Afterwards, we calculated total length,
number of CpG islands and CpG island length to gene length
ratio for our four sets of genes (targets, bystanders, other CpG
island genes and other TF genes). We compared these distributions using a Wilcoxon test (rank sum test) in R, testing for
the alternative hypothesis that the true shift when comparing
two given distributions was greater than 0.
CpG scores were calculated for a 250 bp window sliding in 50
bp steps over 8,000 bp regions around the most used CTSS.
The error bars for CpG scores are calculated by sampling procedures, similar to the calculation of error bars of TC densities. CpG scores were the observed number of CpG
dinucleotides divided by the expected number of CpG dinucleotides, as given by the following formula:

CpGScore =

[CpG ]
[C ][G ] Length

Expression variation analysis
We examined the relative expression variation of target genes
compared to bystander genes using the same sets of genes as
those used in the expression correlation analysis. We calculated the mean expression for each gene in each microarray
replicate by averaging the normalized intensity values for alltime points, and computed the log2 of the ratio of normalized
intensity to the mean expression. Then, we summed up the
squares of those ratios to get the total relative variation for
each gene. Following this, we compared the relative expression variation of target genes and bystanders for each replicate time-course experiment using a Wilcoxon rank sum test,
with the alternative hypothesis that the variation in the target
gene set was larger than in the bystander gene set.

Selection of genes for acetylation analysis
We constructed two sets of genes for acetylation analysis, an
expressed gene set and an unexpressed gene set. We decided
to take the genes that had a detection p-value = 0.05 for both
0 h and 96 h as the expressed gene set, since acetylation data
were available only for the 0 and 96 h time-points. Next, we
extracted the genes that had no detected probes in any of the
replicates at any time point, and used this set as the unexpressed gene set.

Expression correlation analysis

Acetylation site clustering and analysis

We obtained normalized (quantile normalization between the
arrays) Illumina expression data for a macrophage differentiation time-course [16]. There were ten time-points from 0 to
the 96th hour of differentiation. For each probe, detection pvalues were computed by BeadStudio software (Illumina).
For the expression profile comparison analysis, we used a pvalue cutoff of 0.05 for detection, and kept only the probes
detected at nine or more time-points in each replicate. Using
a less stringent threshold may result in genes that are
detected in few time-points, which could compromise the correlation analysis. We assigned one probe for each gene using
the probe annotation provided by the FANTOM4 consortium.
When multiple detected probes mapped to one gene, we only
considered the representative probe among them (as supplied by the microarray manufacturer), if any.

H3K9 acetylation data were prepared using two biological
replicates and two time points (0 h and 96 h) of the macrophage differentiation time-course using THP1 cells and ChIPchip analysis. The acetylation regions with a p-value < 0.001
were clustered together into one if they were no more than
150 bp apart. The clustering was done for both time-points
and separately for each replicate. The clustered acetylation
sites were termed acetylation islands (AC islands). By including only AC islands that overlapped in each replicate, we prepared a stringent set for each time-point. Next, we made a
unified stringent set for the 0 h and 96 h time-points by taking
the union of AC island locations for both time points. In the
end this gave only one set derived from two replicates and two
time points. Since our expressed gene set consisted of genes
expressed at both 0 h and 96 h, the expressed genes were
expected to be acetylated in at least one time point.

We calculated the correlation of expression for each target
gene and its bystander genes; we tested the significance of

For acetylation analysis we partitioned the genome into intergenic, intragenic and promoter regions. The promoter, in this
case, was defined as 1,000 bp upstream and 1,000 bp downstream of the Ensembl TSS. The rest of the gene that was not
part of the promoter region was categorized as intragenic. The
parts of the genome that did not map to an Ensembl gene
were categorized as intergenic. For expressed and unexpressed bystander and target genes, we counted the number
of promoters and intragenic regions that had an AC island or
not. We used these numbers to construct two-by-two tables
for Fisher's exact tests, which we computed using the standard R function fisher test.

in this study (Additional data file 1); supplementary tables
and figures (Additional data file 2).

For the HCNE acetylation analysis, we downloaded
human:zebrafish (minimum 70% identity over 50 bp) and
human:chicken (minimum 90% identity over 50 bp) HCNEs
from the Ancora Browser [33] and discarded HCNEs that
overlapped with a promoter region (defined above). We then
used the remaining HCNEs to count the occurrences of GRBs
in which there was one or more HCNEs with an AC island at
most 450 bp away. Existence of an H3K9 AC island does not
necessarily mean that there is open chromatin in the exact
position of the AC island. It is better interpreted as the occurrence of an open chromatin region in its proximity [23,24].
The degree of this proximity can be estimated from the CTSS
and AC island relationship. AC islands usually do not overlap
a CTSS. Most used CTSSs in the PMA time-course are
observed to be, on average, approximately 450 bp away from
an H3K9 AC island. The GRBs with and without acetylated
HCNEs were divided further into GRBs of expressed targets
and GRBs of unexpressed targets. When extracting the GRBs
of unexpressed targets, we made sure that there were no other
expressed target genes in the GRB; if there was, we excluded
that region from the analysis.
