Abstract
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a saprophytic soil bacterium and the etiological agent that causes melioidosis. It is
naturally resistant to many antibiotics and therefore is difficult to treat. Bacteriophages may provide an alternative
source of treatment. We have isolated and characterised the bacteriophage FBp-AMP1. The phage is a member of
the Podoviridae family and has a genome size of ~ 45 Kb. Molecular data based on the gene which encodes for
the phage tail tubular protein suggests that the phage is distinct from known phages but related to phages which
infect B. thailandensis and Ralstonia spp. The phage FBp-AMP1 is the first B. pseudomallei podovirus to be isolated
from the environment rather than being induced from a bacterial culture. It has a broad host range within B.
pseudomallei and can infect all 11 strains that we tested it on but not related Burkholderia species. It is heat stable
for 8 h at 50°C but not stable at 60°C. It may potentially be a useful tool to treat or diagnose B. pseudomallei
infections as it can lyse several strains of clinical relevance.
Keywords: Burkholderia pseudomallei, bacteriophage, Podoviridae

Findings
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacillus
and the causative agent of melioidosis which is endemic
in Southeast Asia and northern Australia [1]. The bacterium is a widely distributed environmental saprophyte
commonly found in water and soil in the endemic areas.
The bacterium is highly resilient to environmental stress
and can survive in distilled water for months or even
years [2]. It infects humans via inoculation through skin
abrasions or via the inhalation route and causes either
acute or chronic melioidosis. Acute infection is often
manifested as septicemia, resulting in death within days
of exposure. B. pseudomallei is resistant to many antibiotics including third-generation cephalosporins [3].
There is clearly a need for novel antimicrobials. One
promising source of antimicrobials may come from bacteriophages which infect and kill specific bacterial cells.
They are the most abundant living entities in the world,
and play key roles in bacterial population dynamics and
evolution [4]. Bacteriophages can be either temperate

where they integrate into the host bacterial genomes, or
virulent where they infect, multiply, and lyse their hosts
without any initial integration period. The ability of
such virulent phages to be used therapeutically has been
well documented and reviewed [5,6].
Prophages have been shown to be abundant in B.
pseudomallei genomes [7-9]. A recent study reported
the abundance and diversity of prophages in B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis and B. mallei genomes and suggested how they contribute to the phenotypic diversity
in the Burkholderia species complex [8]. Pertinently to
our study, the 37 phages identified in the Burkholderia
genomes were either myoviruses, Mu-like viruses, or
siphoviruses. Although one previous study reported the
presence of a putative podovirus in the genome of B.
pseudomallei, there are no published genetic studies to
support this work [7]. Another recent study isolated six
B. pseudomallei myoviruses from soil in Thailand, these
were morphologically characterised to have lytic properties [10].
We report the isolation of a podovirus which is specific to B. pseudomallei. To isolate the phage, one hundred and fifty soil samples were screened. The samples
were collected from rice fields within the Khon Kaen

Province, Thailand. The soil samples were collected during the rainy season from a depth of around 10-20 cm.
The ambient temperature in rice fields varies with season ranged from 23-35°C and in the summer time temperatures reach 40-45°C. Two grams of each soil sample
was placed into 10 ml Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 0.5 mM CaCl 2. Each sample was mixed
thoroughly, incubated at room temperature overnight,
centrifuged at 4000 × g for 20 min and then passed
through a 0.22 μm filter. Ten microlitre volumes were
used in spot assays on B. pseudomallei strain K96243
grown on LB agar supplemented with 0.5 mM CaCl2 .
The phage was purified and kept as stock in SM-buffer
with 50% glycerol at -70°C.
The isolated phage was designated Bp-AMP1 and
characterised using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). This analysis revealed that it belongs to the
podovirus family as it has an icosahedral capsid with a
diameter of ~ 45 nm and a characteristically small
podovirus tail of ~20 nm tail (Figure 1A). Pulsed field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was carried out as described
previously [11]. This revealed that the genome size was
consistent with a typical podovirus size of approximately
45 Kb (Figure 1B). Phage DNA was digested using the
restriction enzyme BstBI and a discrete DNA banding
pattern was obtained (Figure 1C). The total size of the
restriction fragments from this digestion amounted to
45.5 Kb and correlates with the PFGE estimate.
To investigate the host range of FBp-AMP1, plaque
assays were performed on 10 B. pseudomallei strains
isolated from distinct geographic locations, 6 B. thailandensis strains, 4 other Burkholderia spp., Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Escherichia coli strains (Table 1).
FBp-AMP1 could infect all 11 B. pseudomallei
strains however in general they were more efficient at
infecting the Thai B. pseudomallei strains than the
Australian strains. To do these efficiency assays, a
known amount of phage stock derived from being propagated on K96243 was added to each host strain
tested. This stock gave a titre of 2.90 × 10 7 pfu/ml
when grown on the host strain. However, the titre was
much lower on the Australian strains with the least
good host being MSHR668 which only had a titre of
10 ± 1.66 pfu/ml. There are some exceptions to this
and the Thai strain E8 was not an efficient host for
the phage. It could not infect any of the tested 6
strains of B. thailandensis or the B. multivorans, B.
ubonensis, B. cepacia, B. vietnamiensis, P. aeruginosa
and E. coli. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first isolation of a Podoviridae family bacteriophage
which specifically infects B. pseudomallei. Although B.
pseudomallei myoviruses have been isolated previously,
because myoviruses generally do not share any genes
in common with podoviruses, FBp-AMP1 is likely to

have a novel set of antimicrobial properties to those
found in B. pseudomallei myoviruses.
In order to characterise the physiological characteristics of this phage, one-step growth curve experiments
were performed as previously described [12]. Briefly,
cultures of B. pseudomallei K96243 with ca. 1 × 10 8
bacteria were resuspended in 1 ml LB medium and
incubated with FBp-AMP1 at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) 0.1. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10
min before centrifugation and resuspension in 10 ml of
pre-warmed LB broth supplemented with 0.5 mM CaCl2
and incubated at 37°C. Five hundred microlitres of culture was taken at 20 min intervals over a period of 3 h
and the number of phage particles was immediately

B. pseudomallei K96243 was used to propagate the phages and the stock was used to infect the other strains. The stock gave 2.90 × 107 pfu/ml on K96243 and
the titre on the other strains is given in the table.Value represent the mean pfu/ml ± S.E.M of triplicates, -, no plaque formation

determined using plaque assays. These data showed that
the eclipse, latent period and burst size of FBp-AMP1
on B. pseudomallei K96243 at 37°C were 40 min, 60
min and 158 ± 54, respectively (Figure 2A). By comparison, the latent times of FBp-AMP1 was longer and
burst size was smaller than the recently described B.
pseudomallei phage ST79 which had a latent period of
15 min, and a burst size of 304 [10]. Although there
appears to be a population of cells that are resistant to
FBp-AMP1, this reflects the low titre of phages added
to the culture. Bacteria from this culture were isolated
and were still susceptible to phage infection and when
higher MOI’s were used in infection experiments total
lysis was observed.
To investigate the thermal stability of the bacteriophages, a 107 pfu/ml phage stock was incubated at 50°C
and 60°C for 0, 8 and 24 h. These temperatures are significantly higher than the ambient temperature of rice
fields in Thailand. At intervals, the bacteriophage stock
was titred. Figure 2B showed that FBp-AMP1 was stable
for at least 8 h at 50°C but reduced from 107 pfu/ml to
104 pfu/ml after a further period of incubation from 8 h
to 24 h. However, no bacteriophages were detected after
1 h incubation at 60°C (data not shown). This data indicates that FBp-AMP1 may be useful even in high temperature environments. The loss of phage viability at 60°

C is a common observation, as seen for example in bacteriophages which infect Lactobacillus delbrueckii [13].
To obtain molecular data on this phage, we initially
tried to amplify the DNA polymerase gene using
designed primers from a subset of viruses belonging to
the Podoviridae [14]. This was not successful probably
due to a lack of sequence identity with known phages;
we therefore randomly sequenced fragments of phage
DNA. To do this, DNA was restricted using TaqaI and
BstBI and cloned into the plasmid pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Colonies were screened to
identify those that contained suitable fragment sizes. A
PsiBLAST (NCBI) search from a sequenced region identified a gene (EMBL:FR850500) which had a homologue
with an ORF coding for a phage tail tubular protein B
(TTPB) from a temperate B. thailandensis phage (GeneBank:ZP02468145.1). Fortuitously, this gene had been
used as a phylogenetic marker in previous studies [15].
Therefore, a phylogenetic analysis was performed at the
amino acid level using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis (MEGA) package version 4.1 (Beta) [16,17].
The tree in Figure 3 shows the results from a Neighbor joining analysis which was performed using a maximum composite likelihood model and a bootstrap
analysis with 1, 000 replicates with bacteriophage T7 as
an outgroup. The tree shows that FBp-AMP1 is clearly

separated from known phages but is most closely related
to the B. thailandensis MSMB43 prophage and the T7like Ralstonia phage RSB1 (supported by a boots trap
value of 100%). This is logical because Ralstonia is closely related to soil-born Burkholderia species [18]. Interestingly, there is no clear relationship between FBpAMP1 and the characterised Pseudomonas phages. Analyses were also done using Parsimony and Maximum
likelihood and all showed a similar tree topology.
In conclusion, we report the isolation of a podovirus
which infects B. pseudomallei. The broad host-range
and thermal stability of this phage suggests that it may
have promise as a therapeutic agent. Further research is
underway in our laboratories to characterise the genome
of this bacteriophage and to establish its potential application for B. pseudomallei treatment.
