Abstract
Background: The ParaHox gene cluster is the evolutionary sister to the Hox cluster. Whilst the
role of the Hox cluster in patterning the anterior-posterior axis of bilaterian animals is well
established, and the organisation of vertebrate Hox clusters is intimately linked to gene regulation,
much less is known about the more recently discovered ParaHox cluster. ParaHox gene clustering,
and its relationship to expression, has only been described in deuterostomes. Conventional
protostome models (Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans) are secondarily derived
with respect to ParaHox genes, suffering gene loss and cluster break-up.
Results: We provide the first evidence for ParaHox gene clustering from a less-derived
protostome animal, the annelid Platynereis dumerilii. Clustering of these genes is thus not a sole
preserve of the deuterostome lineage within Bilateria. This protostome ParaHox cluster is not
entirely intact however, with Pdu-Cdx being on the opposite end of the same chromosome arm
from Pdu-Gsx and Pdu-Xlox. From the genomic sequence around the P. dumerilii ParaHox genes the
neighbouring genes are identified, compared with other taxa, and the ancestral arrangement
deduced.
Conclusion: We relate the organisation of the ParaHox genes to their expression, and from
comparisons with other taxa hypothesise that a relatively complex pattern of ParaHox gene
expression existed in the protostome-deuterostome ancestor, which was secondarily simplified
along several invertebrate lineages. Detailed comparisons of the gene content around the ParaHox
genes enables the reconstruction of the genome surrounding the ParaHox cluster of the
protostome-deuterostome ancestor, which existed over 550 million years ago.

Background
The ParaHox gene cluster was first discovered in the invertebrate chordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) [1].
ParaHox gene clustering is conserved in humans and
other tetrapods, but disrupted in several other chordates
[2-4]. The ancestral condition for the chordates is, however, clearly one of possession of a ParaHox cluster, which
has been conserved since the Cambrian along both the
cephalochordate and tetrapod lineages.
The organisation of the cluster and the phylogenetic relationships of its component genes (Gsx, Xlox and Cdx) relative to the Hox cluster genes are consistent with a
paralogous relationship between the ParaHox and Hox
clusters, that is, they are evolutionary sisters. Whilst Hox
gene clustering is widespread across the bilaterians, the
ParaHox cluster has only been found in chordates thus far
(as well as one example from the probable sister group to
the bilaterians, the cnidarians[5]). In protostomes that
have been examined to date (insects and nematodes) the
ParaHox cluster does not exist, and one or more ParaHox
genes have been lost. This ParaHox gene loss is clearly a
secondarily derived condition for protostomes, since all
three ParaHox genes are present in a variety of lophotrochozoan protostomes, including annelids and molluscs
[6-9]. Whilst the ancestral presence of all three ParaHox
genes is now well established for protostomes, the
genomic organisation of the genes in an animal that is not
as derived as insects and nematodes, and which still
retains all three genes, has not been determined.
The ordered clustering of the Hox genes is related to their
expression and function, at least in the vertebrates. The
order of the genes along the chromosome corresponds to
the order of the gene expression domains along the
embryonic anterior-posterior axis: the phenomenon of
colinearity. Due to the paralogous relationship and retention of clustering between the ParaHox and Hox cluster,
there is a distinct possibility that the organisation of the
ParaHox cluster also relates to the expression and function
of the component genes in a similar fashion to the Hox
cluster situation.
ParaHox gene organisation and expression has been
widely examined within deuterostomes. The prototypical
ParaHox cluster of amphioxus exhibits spatial colinearity,
with AmphiGsx expressed in the anterior central nervous
system (CNS), AmphiXlox in a more central region of the
CNS and the developing gut, and AmphiCdx at the posterior end of the larva in both the CNS and gut [1,10]. This
has distinct similarities to vertebrate ParaHox gene expression. Vertebrate Gsx genes (usually called Gsh1 and Gsh2)
have anterior boundaries of expression in the brain with
extensive expression posteriorly into the neural tube, in a
dorso-ventrally restricted fashion that may be comparable

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/43

to Drosophila [11-17]. Vertebrate Xlox genes (with synonyms of PDX1, IPF1, IDX1, XlHbox8, STF1 or MODY4) are
expressed in the gut during pancreas development [18-22]
and in the CNS [23-25]. Vertebrate Cdx genes are predominantly posterior patterning genes, expressed in the CNS,
mesoderm and gut [25-28]. In invertebrate deuterostomes, apart from amphioxus, the ParaHox cluster has
broken apart [2,29] but there are still elements of the spatial restriction and tissue specificity of ParaHox expression. In urochordates Gsx is expressed in a small domain
in the anterior CNS [30], Xlox (called Ci-IPF1) is in mesenchymal cells and some cells of the CNS [31], and Cdx
patterns the posterior tadpole tail and is expressed in the
hindgut of post-metamorphic animals [32,33]. In the
echinoderm, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Gsx is expressed
in a small patch of putative nerve cells, whilst Xlox and
Cdx have staggered expression domains in the posterior
gut tube [29], and in a starfish, Archaster typicus, Xlox is
expressed throughout the early archenteron and a few vegetal ectodermal cells [34]. In summary, deuterostome Gsx
tends to be expressed solely in the CNS with a rostral anterior limit, Xlox is expressed both in the CNS and the developing gut, in central regions such as the pancreas of
vertebrates, and Cdx is expressed in more posterior
regions of the CNS and gut. Whether the deuterostome
ParaHox genes exist in an intact or broken cluster may
depend on the regulatory mechanism(s) controlling the
temporal activation of the genes [2,35].
ParaHox gene expression has been more sparsely sampled
in protostomes, apart from Cdx (or caudal). Gsx expression has been documented in the insects Drosophila and
Tribolium, and the polychaetes Capitella and Nereis virens.
Insect Gsx is expressed along a pair of medio-laterally
restricted neural columns, and has a role in neuronal patterning [11,36]. There are also domains of expression in
the head region of these insects that have yet to be fully
characterised, but do include expression in neural cells
[11,36,37]. In contrast, expression of Gsx in the polychaete Capitella is restricted to a small domain close to the
anterior end of the CNS [7]. This is very different to the
spatially and temporally dynamic expression of Gsx in the
nereid polychaetes, Nereis virens [38] and Platynereis
dumerilii (described below). The central ParaHox gene,
Xlox, is missing from all ecdysozoan genomes sequenced
to date, but is present in lophotrochozoans. In the leeches
Helobdella triserialis and Hirudo medicinalis Xlox (named
HtrA2 or Lox3) is expressed throughout the midgut, as is
also the case for the polychaete Capitella [7,39,40]. No
neural Xlox expression has been described in these annelids. Nereid Xlox expression also has a midgut component, but in contrast to these other annelids is also
expressed in the CNS [38] (and see below). In contrast to
the sparse data on protostome Gsx and Xlox expression,
Cdx has been examined in a large variety of taxa. First

characterised as a posterior patterning gene acting early in
the segmentation gene cascade in Drosophila (in which the
gene is called caudal) [41], Cdx has subsequently been
studied in many other arthropods [42-51]. Broadly, Cdx is
a posterior patterning gene in all of these animals, as it
also is in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (where the
gene is called pal-1) [52] and the mollusc, Patella [53]. In
the annelids Platynereis ([54] and herein), Nereis [38],
Tubifex [55] and Capitella [7] there are both anterior and
posterior expression domains of Cdx (see Discussion).
There is little data on the genomic organisation of protostome ParaHox genes and how it may relate to their
expression.
Here we provide the first description of the expression patterns for all three ParaHox genes for a protostome animal
in relation to their genomic organisation, in the polychaete P. dumerilii. Clustering of protostome ParaHox genes is
shown for the first time, which reveals that some clustering of ParaHox genes has been conserved on both the protostome and deuterostome lineages. The P. dumerilii
ParaHox cluster is not, however, entirely intact. The posterior member, Pdu-Cdx, has been separated from the other
two genes, Pdu-Gsx and Pdu-Xlox, and the two parts of the
Platynereis ParaHox cluster now reside on opposite ends of
the same chromosome arm. Comparison of the genes
neighbouring the Platynereis ParaHox genes with the map
positions of the mammalian orthologues allows the
reconstruction of the genomic region surrounding the
ParaHox cluster of the protostome-deuterostome ancestor
(PDA), an extinct animal that lived over 550 million years
ago. The details of the Platynereis ParaHox gene expression
patterns, by comparison with those of other animals,
imply a complex role for Gsx in the PDA's CNS and a possible function in protostome mouth development, a role
for Xlox in CNS patterning as well as gut development,
and a complex and dynamic pattern of Cdx expression in
polychaetes that correlates with the relocation of the gene
out of the cluster.

Results
ParaHox gene sequences
The entire coding sequences for all three P. dumerilii ParaHox genes was isolated by a combination of degenerate
primer PCR, RACE PCR and sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) genomic clones (see Methods).
The main region of conservation between ParaHox genes
is in the homeobox. Alignments of each P. dumerilii ParaHox homeodomain to representatives from other animals
are shown in Figure 1. The clear classification of the P.
dumerilii ParaHox genes into their orthology groups is
apparent from phylogenetic analyses (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). Other conserved domains besides the homeodomains are the N-terminal SNAG transcriptional
repressor domain in Gsx, and the hexapeptide motifs just

(Additional file 1, Figure S2 to S4).
ParaHox gene organisation
Both Pdu-Gsx and Pdu-Xlox are located on a single BAC
clone, 42 kb apart, and are organised in a head-to-head
orientation (Figure 2). This is in contrast to the tandem
orientation of Gsx and Xlox in chordates [56]. Pdu-Cdx is
not on this Pdu-Gsx/Pdu-Xlox BAC clone. Several independent BAC clones containing Pdu-Cdx were isolated,
and sequencing of these clones revealed no overlap of the
Pdu-Cdx BACs with the Pdu-Gsx/Pdu-Xlox BAC. Complete
sequencing of the ParaHox contigs identified no other
homeobox-containing genes besides Pdu-Gsx, Pdu-Xlox
and Pdu-Cdx (Figure 2). Although there is a putative partial reverse-transcriptase-like gene found between Pdu-Gsx
and Pdu-Xlox, it is likely to be the remains of a transposable element. We conclude that there are no internal nonhomeobox genes between Pdu-Gsx and Pdu-Xlox. Such a
situation is analogous to that reported for intact chordate
ParaHox clusters [56].

the centromeric end of one of the metacentric chromosomes of Platynereis, whilst Pdu-Cdx is located close to the
telomere on the same chromosome arm (Figure 3).
ParaHox gene expression
Only a partial account of Platynereis ParaHox gene expression has been available until now, including the expression of Pdu-Cdx during development and regeneration
and of Pdu-Gsx at 48 hours post fertilisation (hpf) [54,57].
In order to compare the expression of all three ParaHox
genes in Platynereis, we performed a series of wholemount in situ hybridisations (WMISH) during larval
development.

Pdu-Gsx expression is very dynamic, and transcripts are
already detected by 24 hpf by WMISH. Expression is seen
in a few cells in the apical hemisphere (Figure 4A and 4B),
where Pdu-Gsx-positive cells continue to be observed
throughout trochophore stages, both in the developing
apical organ and cerebral ganglia (Figure 4D and 4F). The
flask-shaped appearance of Pdu-Gsx-positive cells, with
long sensory dendrites (data not shown), and their position in the medial forebrain anlage is consistent with
them being sensory-neurosecretory cells [58]. As reported
previously, Pdu-Gsx expression is also seen in the ventral

plate of 48 hpf larvae during differentiation of the trunk
CNS [57]. Besides the expression domains in prospective
neural tissue, Pdu-Gsx transcripts are also detected in the
stomodeum, where they appear prior to 36 hpf in two
bilateral cell clusters (Figure 4C). Subsequently stomodeal
expression becomes more prominent, and forms two
bilateral stripes at 48 hpf (Figure 4E). At 6 days of larval
development Pdu-Gsx expression is most prominent in
small cell clusters of the cellularised gut, both in the
region of the midgut and the posterior foregut (Figure 4G
and 4H).
Pdu-Xlox transcription appears to be initiated considerably later than Pdu-Gsx expression. Whilst no expression is
detectable at 24 or 36 hpf by WMISH, Pdu-Xlox transcripts
appear in a group of cells in the medial ventral plate of the
metatrochophore larvae by 50 hpf (Figure 4I and 4J).
Intriguingly, this expression is very similar in appearance
to the medial ventral plate expression of Pdu-Gsx at a similar stage of development (Figure 4E). Expression in the
medial ventral plate is also observed at 72 hpf (Figure 4K).
At this stage Pdu-Xlox expression is also initiated in the
midgut rudiment (Figure 4L). By 5 days of development
Pdu-Xlox transcripts are confined to two separate clusters
of cells in the anterior and posterior midgut (Figure 4M).

bouring genes, and the rationale for their naming, is given
in Additional file 1.

Pdu-Xlox (CHORI305_76L3) (red) and Pdu-Cdx
(CHORI305_108J4) (green) on a typical interphase nucleus,
showing that the red and green signals are consistently in
similar regions of the nucleus, but with a relatively large distance between them. This is consistent with results on metaphase chromosomes (right-hand panels), in which signals of
Pdu-Gsx (CHORI305_233N17) (red) are located near to the
centromere of a q arm, and Pdu-Cdx (CHORI305_108J4)
(green) on the telomeric end on the same chromosome.
(Bars = 20 μm).

At this stage neural expression is still clearly visible in a
bilateral pair of spots in the cerebral ganglia (Figure 4M).
Clear Pdu-Cdx expression is evident by 15 hpf [54]. The
ectodermal expression encircles the entire proctodeal portion of the blastopore and extends anteriorly along the
edges of the blastopore up to the posterior side of the stomodeum. There are two horns of Pdu-Cdx expression
deeper inside the larvae at 15 to 20 hpf, which are possibly
mesodermal or endodermal precursors. By 36 hpf the
blastopore has completely separated into stomodeum
and proctodeum, and Pdu-Cdx expression is confined to
the proctodeum and a small cap of posterior ectoderm
([54]; Figure 4N). As development proceeds through to
the 6-day-old three-segment larvae the proctodeal expression resolves into midgut and hindgut expression and the
posterior ectodermal expressing cells become pygidium
epidermis (Figure 4P).
Neighbouring genes
A contig of 220 kb was sequenced around Pdu-Gsx and
Pdu-Xlox, and a separate contig of 230 kb was sequenced
around Pdu-Cdx. There are several flanking genes outside
the ParaHox genes in the two contigs (Figure 2). Two
genes are found next to Pdu-Gsx, and two genes on the
other side next to Pdu-Xlox, and four genes flanking one
side of Pdu-Cdx. The other side flanking Pdu-Cdx contains
a region of repetitive sequence with putative transposable
elements and repeats. The characteristics of these neigh-

The two putative genes outside the annelid ParaHox cluster at the Pdu-Gsx end are Matrilin-like (Pdu-MatnL) and
Laminin Gamma (Pdu-Lamc1/3) (Figure 2 and Additional
file 1, Figures S5 and S6). These two genes lie around 92
kb and 44 kb away from Pdu-Gsx, respectively (calculating
from the start methionine codon of each gene). It seems
that Pdu-MatnL lies within a large intron of Pdu-Lamc1/3,
with the 3' exon(s) of Pdu-Lamc1/3 lying beyond the reach
of the present contig. On the other side of the Pdu-Gsx/
Pdu-Xlox contig, adjacent to Pdu-Xlox, lie Pdu-AIR1-Like
(Pdu-AIR1L) and Pdu-Btk (Figure 2 and Additional file 1,
Figures S7 and S8). Pdu-AIR1L is around 32 kb away from
the start methionine codon of Pdu-Xlox. Two regions of
sequence similarity to tyrosine kinases are found at
around 24 kb and 36 kb away from the start methionine
codon of Pdu-Xlox, separated by Pdu-AIR1L, which is transcribed in the opposite orientation (Figure 2), and
together these tyrosine kinase regions constitute a section
of the Pdu-Btk gene. From the sequence alignments we
suppose that the N-terminal end of Pdu-Btk is encoded by
exons that lie beyond the present contig (Figure 2 and
Additional file 1, Figure S8). In the Pdu-Cdx contig, there
are four putative genes on the 3' side of Pdu-Cdx: PduSF1KH-Like (Pdu-SF1KHL), Pdu-Rad50, Pdu-Ccna, and
Pdu-Exosc9 (Additional file 1, Figures S9 to S12), with
putative start methionine codons located around 30 kb,
46 kb, 64 kb and 86 kb away from the start methionine
codon of Pdu-Cdx, respectively.
Synteny
Some of the genes neighbouring the ParaHox clusters of
chordates were clearly flanking the cluster in the chordate
ancestor [4,56,59]. Given the possibility of detecting such
ancient synteny, the genomic locations of human orthologues to the P.dumerilii flanking genes were compared,
and are shown in Figure 5. Interestingly, neighbours of the
ParaHox genes in the protostome P.dumerilii can also be
found close to the ParaHox genes in human.

Figure 5 shows the reconstruction of the ParaHox synteny
region of the PDA. Humans have four ParaHox regions for
consideration, one of which contains the complete ParaHox cluster (on chromosome 13) and three that contain
the remains of the degenerate clusters that have undergone ParaHox gene loss (chromosomes 4, 5 and X) [56].
Figure 5 shows the genomic locations of the human
orthologues of the Platynereis ParaHox flanking genes
(considering both Platynereis ParaHox contigs together). It
is clear that one or more of the paralogues of each gene
under consideration is located on the same chromosome
as a ParaHox cluster for several of these genes (including
both the complete and degenerate human clusters), and

Expression of Pdu-Gsx, Pdu-Xlox and Pdu-Cdx during larval development. (A-F) Pdu-Gsx is expressed in distinct cell
clusters in the apical hemisphere (red arrowheads), and stomodeum (yellow arrowheads) that marks the anterior end of the
future gut. Expression is also found in ventral neuroectoderm (E, white arrowheads). (G, H) Later, Pdu-Gsx marks specific cells
(black arrowheads) in midgut (G) and posterior foregut (H). (I-K) Early Pdu-Xlox expression is confined to cells in the medial
ventral plate (I, J; white arrowheads), where weak expression also persists to later stages (K). (L, M) In parallel, Pdu-Xlox transcripts appear inside the larvae (black arrowheads), marking distinct cell clusters in prospective midgut. Weak expression is
also observed in bilateral lobes of the larval brain (red asterisks). (N-P) In trochophore larva (N), Pdu-Cdx is prominent in the
proctodeal area (black asterisk); which subsequently (O, P), resolves into cells of the posterior midgut and hindgut (black
arrowheads), and pygidial epidermis (black asterisks). For Pdu-Gsx, we also observe signal in the anterior foregut region (yellow
asterisk in H), but we presently cannot rule out that this anterior signal results from probe trapping in the foregut cavity rather
than being a further Pdu-Gsx expression domain. Orientation of panels: (A, C, E, I, N, O) ventral views, apical/anterior to the

in some cases is adjacent to a ParaHox locus. A human Btk
gene (ITK) has a tight linkage to the ParaHox cluster at
5q31, and two further pairs of paralogues (TEC, TXK, and
BMX, BTK) show looser linkage to the cluster on chromosome 4 and X (Figure 5). One of the human AIR-like genes
(ZCCHC13) is close to the ParaHox region on the X chromosome at Xq13.2, and a second Air1L gene (ZCCHC9) is
more loosely linked to the ParaHox locus on human chromosome 5 (Figure 5). Human Rad50 is adjacent to the
ParaHox region on human chromosome 5, at 5q31, and
the human Ccna gene (CCNA1) sits next to the ParaHox
cluster at 13q12.3-23, with a paralogue (CCNA2) also
loosely linked to the ParaHox region on chromosome 4.
These gene families then (Btk, AIR1-like, Ccna and
Rad50) have a close genomic association with the ParaHox genes in both Platynereis and humans, and so we
hypothesise that they were close neighbours in the bilaterian ancestor.
The remaining genes may well have also been within this
ancient ParaHox synteny region, but the data in support
of this conclusion is not as strong as that for Btk, AIR1like, Ccna and Rad50. An EXOSC9 gene is loosely linked
to the human ParaHox region on chromosome 4. This is
close to a paralogue of CCNA (CCNA2 at 4q25-31) whose
evolutionary sister (CCNA1) is tightly linked to the
13q12.1-3 ParaHox locus. Laminin Gamma and SF1KHL
genes are not linked to ParaHox genes in humans; however, they are linked to each other on human chromosome 1 (Figure 5). The large size of the Matrilin-like
family of genes in humans means that it is difficult to
draw meaningful conclusions about orthology relationships between the Platynereis gene described here (PduMatnL) and particular human Matrilin-like genes and
their genomic locations. Whilst the Matrilin-like genes
cannot thus be included in the ParaHox syntenic region
reconstruction, the Exosc9, Laminin Gamma and SF1KHL
genes would only require single translocation events
along the human lineage to be accommodated, to allow
them to be included as potential ParaHox neighbours
(Figure 5).

Discussion
ParaHox gene clustering
The existence of colinearity in the ParaHox cluster of chordates implies that the organisation of the ParaHox genes
could well be linked to their control and operation. If
there is some form of long-range regulatory mechanism
operating across the ParaHox genes, as clearly happens
with the vertebrate Hox genes [60], then the organisation
of the genome around the ParaHox genes would be
expected to be refractory or intolerant to extensive rearrangements during evolution, as has been observed for
genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) in vertebrate genomes
[61]. Detection of common gene neighbours in distinct

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/43

animal lineages also implies conserved synteny inherited
from the last common ancestor. Regions of these ancestral
genomes can thus be reconstructed even though the
organisms in which they existed have long since gone
extinct. Such genome reconstructions have the potential
to help us understand the ancestral regulatory mechanisms operating on key developmental control genes,
such as clusters of homeobox genes.
Until now the ParaHox cluster has only been found in
chordates within the bilaterians. The close linkage of PduGsx and Pdu-Xlox, with no intervening genes, is the first
example of ParaHox gene clustering to be found in a protostome (Figure 6). This is perhaps surprising given the
supposed paralogous nature of the ParaHox cluster with
the Hox cluster, which is usually assumed to be clustered
quite widely across the animal kingdom and exhibit a link
between the organisation of the genes in the Hox cluster
and their regulation (colinearity). There are, however, an
increasing number of examples of Hox clusters that have
broken apart, and the underlying mechanistic basis for
Hox cluster maintenance or disintegration is unclear
(reviewed in [35,60,62]). As further Hox and ParaHox
clusters are characterised from a greater diversity of taxa,
and the regulatory mechanisms operating within the clusters are elucidated, we will gain a much deeper understanding of the role of these key developmental control
genes in animal development and evolution, and in particular whether clustering of these genes reflects mechanistic constraints or simply evolutionary inertia.
ParaHox expression in the protostome-deuterostome
ancestor
Comparisons between Platynereis gene expression and the
orthologues of deuterostomes and ecdysozoans should
permit the deduction of the role of the gene in the ancestor of the eubilaterians (the PDA). Such comparisons of
Gsx expression, however, present a conundrum; was
ancestral Gsx expression simple or complex, with subsequent extensive secondary modifications required in both
scenarios? Detailed similarities between Platynereis and
vertebrates lead us to favour the hypothesis that the ancestor (in terms of its Gsx expression pattern) was complex,
with Gsx domains in a variety of nervous system roles
(eyes, neurosecretory cells and 'hindbrain', and potentially along the anterior-posterior axis of the nerve cord
which was not examined here) (Figure 4). Gsx expression
was then secondarily simplified in several lineages. This
secondary simplification led to a similar outcome in each
of the simplified cases so far characterised; small patches
of expression in the anterior CNS in the polychaete
Capitella [7], the chordates amphioxus [1,10] and C. intestinalis [30], and possibly the sea urchin [29]. The alternative, of an ancestor with simple Gsx expression (perhaps
restricted to a small area in the anterior CNS), would then

Ortholog
Ortholog locations of the P. dumerilii ParaHox neighbouring genes in human. The top line shows a merge of the
Platynereis contigs, black boxes are the ParaHox genes, and other boxes are neighbouring genes. Gene order is not biologically
significant and the cluster break is denoted by double-parallel lines. The middle panel shows the locations of the human
orthologs. The central large grey shaded area is the location of the ParaHox genes, and other grey shaded boxes are orthologs
that are tightly linked to the human ParaHox genes. The bottom line shows probable genomic organisation around the ParaHox genes in the protostome-deuterostome ancestor, but the ordering of the genes around the ParaHox cluster is not significant in this figure, and cannot be deduced from this data. Black boxes represent homeobox genes, and ParaHox neighbours are
ranked according to support with dark grey boxes being the most strongly supported, followed by light grey box and white
boxes (see text for details).

require independent elaboration of the expression in the
lineages leading to Platynereis and vertebrates. There is no
reason to suppose that such independent elaboration
would necessarily follow similar avenues in multiple cell
types and tissues in different lineages. Indeed it seems
unlikely that this should be the case, and so the extensive
detailed similarities between the Gsx expression of Platynereis and vertebrates can be taken as indicating a complex
pattern of Gsx expression in the PDA, with roles in eyes,
neurosecretory cells and regionalisation of the neural
tube/column.
In addition to the neural expression of Pdu-Gsx, there is
expression in the developing mouth, the stomodeum, and
then later in the midgut (Figure 4). The expression of PduGsx in the stomodeum is intriguing in the context of the
hypothesis that the ParaHox genes patterned the gut tube
of the PDA, and the anterior gut-patterning role of Gsx

was lost on the deuterostome lineage with the evolution
of the secondary mouth [63,64]. Gsx expression in a protostome stomodeum has only been documented in
another nereid polychaete, N. virens, prior to this work
[38]. Together the Nvi-Gsh and the Pdu-Gsx expression
described here may lend support to the ancestral mouth
patterning role of Gsx (and the lack of complete homology, at the level of developmental patterning, of the
mouths of protostomes and deuterostomes [65]). Clearly
a wider range of protostomes must be sampled to obtain
a consensus on the role of Gsx in the stomodeum of these
animals.
The expression of Pdu-Xlox during midgut development is
similar to the Xlox expression in other annelids [7,38-40].
Since deuterostome Xlox genes are also expressed in midgut regions during embryogenesis, it is likely that a role
for Xlox in midgut development was present in the PDA.

extends to extremely anterior regions of the embryo. This
anterior expression of Cdx in these lophotrochozoans
conflicts with what might be expected if the ParaHox
genes exhibited spatial colinearity at the time of initial
gene activation (Gsx – anterior, Xlox – central, Cdx – posterior). The genomic organisation of the genes is thus a
prime consideration, and intriguingly Pdu-Cdx has broken
away from the ParaHox cluster (Figure 3). Such an
arrangement, of Gsx and Xlox being clustered and Cdx
separated away, is also present in the mollusc Lottia
gigantea [66], which may well reflect the situation in
Patella, although this needs to be specifically tested.

Figure 6
Summary of bilaterian ParaHox gene organisation
Summary of bilaterian ParaHox gene organisation.
Boxes indicate ParaHox genes. Boxes on the same line represent genes linked on the same chromosome. Cluster
breaks with intervening non-homeobox genes are denoted
by double-parallel lines. Gene losses are denoted by crosses.
Question marks indicate no information available for the
chromosomal location. However, it should be noted that
there are flanking non-homeobox genes on both sides of all
the ParaHox orthologues with question marks, except for
one side of both Gsx and Xlox in sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, in which these two ParaHox genes are located
at the ends of their respective scaffolds.

Pdu-Xlox is also expressed in the nervous system. Neural
expression is also known for chordates [1,10,23,31]. An
ancient neural role for Xlox in the PDA thus also seems
likely in addition to the gut function. If this hypothesis is
true, however, it would once again necessitate secondary
simplification and loss of neural Xlox expression in some
lineages such as Capitella [7].
The midgut expression of Pdu-Xlox appears very similar to
the midgut expression of Pdu-Gsx at 6 dpf, and both genes
are also expressed in the ventral neural plate in similar
locations at the same time (48 to 50 hpf) (Figure 4). Given
the fact that the clustering of Pdu-Gsx and Pdu-Xlox has
been conserved since the time of the PDA, perhaps the
commonalities in aspects of their expression reflect a
shared regulatory mechanism, such as a shared
enhancer(s), which in turn constrains this clustered
arrangement.
Pdu-Cdx has a complex, dynamic expression pattern in
cells of the ectoderm, endoderm and possibly the nascent
larval mesoderm [54]. This is also the case for Cdx expression in other annelids (Capitella [7] and Tubifex [55]) and
the mollusc Patella vulgata [53] in which the expression

The ParaHox cluster has degenerated still further in the
polychaete Capitella, in which Gsx has separated from Cdx
and Xlox, and there are a couple of non-homeobox genes
that have invaded the region between Cdx and Xlox [67]
(summarised in Figure 6). Platynereis and limpets may
then represent the general lophotrochozoan condition for
the ParaHox cluster, of Gsx and Xlox clustered and Cdx
broken away, which correlates with the relatively anterior
initial expression of Cdx up to regions around the mouth
and prototroch (Figure 4) [53,54]. Potentially this unusual expression of Cdx has been able to evolve due to this
separation of the gene from the rest of the ParaHox cluster, and escape from any pan-cluster regulatory mechanisms analogous to those operating in the vertebrate Hox
clusters [60]. The situation has then been taken to further
levels of derivation in Capitella (and possibly Tubifex) with
continued ParaHox cluster degeneration. An alternative
hypothesis would be that the ancestral expression of Cdx
covered an extensive anterior-posterior portion of the
nervous system, as it does in the lophotrochozoans
described here and also, intriguingly, in the acoels, a possible basal lineage of Bilateria and hence potentially
informative PDA outgroup [68]. Since the phylogenetic
position of acoels remains uncertain [69,70] and the
genomic organisation of the ParaHox genes is not yet
known in acoels, their suitability as a PDA outgroup for
the Cdx question (is Cdx ancestrally in an intact cluster
with posterior expression or with extensive anterior-posterior expression?) is not yet clear.
This hypothesised break-up of the ParaHox cluster by the
'escape' of Cdx in these lophotrochozoans contrasts with
alternative possible scenarios in which the ParaHox genes
are progressively assembled into a cluster during evolution, and the three-gene cluster of Gsx, Xlox and Cdx was
a chordate innovation. Here we favour the first scenario
above, of a Gsx-Xlox-Cdx cluster in the PDA followed by a
break-up in the protostomes examined, since this is much
more parsimonious than the alternative of genes originating by tandem duplication and so being ancestral neighbours (as the ParaHox genes are presumed to have done
due to their sequence similarities), followed by separation

before the origin of the PDA, and then a secondary reassociation in the chordate lineage.

huge potential for revealing the nature of the PDA
[73,74].

In the context of colinearity we find it intriguing that
aspects of spatial colinearity can still be distinguished in
the CNS and gut whilst temporal colinearity is absent
(notwithstanding the complications of Pdu-Cdx expression described above and in [54] which mean that strict
spatial colinearity at the time of gene initiation is not
observed). It has been speculated that pan-cluster mechanisms responsible for temporal colinearity in Hox clusters
act as the principal constraining force maintaining those
clusters, whilst spatial colinearity can remain even after
the clusters are broken up [2,35,71,72]. Here we show
that the evolutionary sister to the Hox cluster, the ParaHox cluster, may conform to the same paradigm, with
Pdu-Gsx initiated in the anterior CNS and gut (stomodeum), Pdu-Xlox in the ventral plate and midgut, and PduCdx resolving to the posterior. However, in terms of the
timing of initiation the posterior gene (Pdu-Cdx) and
anterior gene (Pdu-Gsx) are both activated before the middle gene (Pdu-Xlox).

Further sequencing data around the Platynereis ParaHox
genes will also be interesting with regards to seeing
whether the ParaHox neighbouring genes that have permitted the detection of the ParaHox locus of the cnidarian, Nematostella vectensis [5], also neighbour the
Platynereis ParaHox locus. The ParaHox neighbours
described here for Platynereis are not present on the ParaHox scaffold of Nematostella. Potentially these neighbours
of the PDA ParaHox genes (in Figure 5) only became associated with the ParaHox locus after the separation of the
cnidarian and bilaterian lineages.

The ParaHox genomic neighbourhood in the protostomedeuterostome ancestor
Figure 5 shows the reconstruction of the genomic region
around the ParaHox cluster of the PDA, which almost certainly contained AIR1L, Btk, Rad50 and CcnA genes, and
may well also have contained Exosc9, Lamc1/3 and
SF1KHL genes. This level of synteny conservation between
Platynereis and humans, and the ability to reconstruct the
arrangement of genomic regions from an ancestral
genome that existed over 550 million years ago, implies a
strikingly low level of genomic rearrangement on the
Platynereis and human lineages, at least in this ParaHox
region. Whether such a 'stable' arrangement of the
genome extends more widely in Platynereis, or instead is
something distinctive about the ParaHox region, remains
to be seen.

By analogy to vertebrates, both the Hox clusters and the
single remaining ParaHox cluster are located in GRBs
[61]. Such regions are refractive to genomic rearrangements due to the presence of regulatory elements that are
acting over large distances. Whilst the order of the genes
around the ParaHox cluster is different between Platynereis
and humans, and indeed the Platynereis cluster has been
broken, which indicates that the polychaete ParaHox
genes have not been retained in a GRB comparable to that
of vertebrates, the striking level of synteny may be indicative of a ParaHox GRB that has only recently been lost in
the Platynereis lineage. The alternative, that the high level
of synteny between humans and Platynereis is widespread
beyond the ParaHox loci, would provide a further example of the prototypical nature of Platynereis biology and its

Conclusion
This putative prototypical nature of Platynereis genome
organisation and development within the protostomes
leads us to hypothesise that the PDA had a nervous system
with a complex pattern of Gsx expression. Also, the
expression of Pdu-Gsx in stomodeal development may
provide molecular evidence for an ancestral role for Gsx in
mouth patterning. The PDA is likely to have had a neural
Xlox role, in addition to a widely conserved function in
midgut development, and the expression of Cdx in lophotrochozoans such as Platynereis highlights the importance
of considering gene expression in the context of genome
organisation. The scope for reconstructing large areas of
ancient genomes deep in animal ancestry has recently
been greatly enhanced with the discovery that high levels
of synteny exist between the genomes of the cnidarian,
Nematostella vectensis and humans [75]. Distinguishing
the changes between this diploblast-triploblast ancestral
genome and the ancestral bilaterian genome, which subsequently gave rise to the huge diversity of bilaterian animal life, requires comparisons between deuterostomes
such as humans and a prototypical protostome genome.
If the synteny around the ParaHox cluster is indicating the
prototypical nature of the Platynereis genome, then this
polychaete may be an excellent candidate for large-scale
genomic sequencing and studies of genome organisation.

Methods
Cloning and BAC library screening
Partial fragments of Pdu-Gsx and Pdu-Xlox were isolated
with the primers GsxIb, GsxIIb, GsxIIIb XloxIc and SO2,
with the conditions described in [6]. A cDNA fragment of
Pdu-Gsx was then isolated as described in [57] [Genbank:
EF384214]. A longer fragment of Pdu-Xlox coding
sequence [Genbank: FJ001341] was then isolated by
5'RACE PCR from a mixture of P. dumerilii libraries of different stages (24 hpf, 48 hpf and 72 hpf) that were prepared using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit
(Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The primers used were xlox_lo1: ATCTTCTGAG-

TAAGCAGAATCTGGAG (first PCR) and xlox_lo2:
CTCTGTCATTCGCGTTCTGTTC (nested PCR), along with
the universal primer mix (UPM) provided by the manufacturer. PCR conditions were: 6 cycles of (1 min at 95°C;
2 min at 62°C; 4 min at 68°C); followed by 36 cycles of
(1 min at 95°C; 2 min at 60°C; 4 min at 68°C) and a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. The Pdu-Cdx cDNA was that
from [54], where it was called Pdu-cad. Pdu-Cdx is used
here for consistency and by extension from the chordate
ParaHox nomenclature. These fragments were used to
screen a Platynereis BAC library [74]. Probes were synthesised with the PCR DIG labelling mix kit (Roche) and 25
ng/ml in DIG Easy Hyb solution (Roche) used to screen
the library at 42°C, followed by washes in 0.5× SSC/
0.1%SDS for 2 × 15 to 30 min at room temperature, and
then 0.2 × SSC/0.1% SDS at 65°C for 2 × 40 min. Signals
were detected by following the instructions for the DIG
nucleic acid detection kit (Roche), but with the anti-digoxigenin-AP used at 1:20,000 and CDP-Star chemiluminescence substrate instead of NBT-BCIP. BAC DNA was
purified with the QIAfilter Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen) and
gene content confirmed by PCR. Entire BAC clones were
sequenced as described in [74].
Whole mount in-situ hybridisation
P. dumerilii embryos were obtained from breeding cultures, following [76], and were raised at 18°C. Larvae
were fixed and subjected to WMISH as previously
described [77].
Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridisation
Chromosome spreads were prepared as described in [78].
The procedures for two-colour FISH were modified from
[78] as follows. BAC clones were labelled with digoxigenin or fluorescein-12-dUTP and Nick translation mix
(Roche). The hybridisation mix contained both DIG and
fluorescein-labelled probes, each at a concentration of
11.1 ng/μl. DIG-labelled probes were detected with antiDIG-rhodamine Fab fragments (1:200; Roche) for 1 hr,
followed by Texas-Red anti-sheep (1:100; Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. Fluorescein-labelled probes were
detected with the Alexa Fluor 488 Signal-Amplification kit
(Molecular Probes). Slides were washed in 4 × TNFM [78]
between each application (three times after the first and
the last, and two times for the second, 5 min each). After
the last wash, slides were further washed in 4 × SSC,
0.05% Tween20 twice for 5 min at room temperature.
Slides were then equilibrated with 1× PBS before mounting with Vectashield antifadent agent containing DAPI
(Vector Laboratories) for chromosome counterstaining.
Images were captured with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope
equipped with an Axiocam camera. All images were processed with whole-layer colour adjustment on the complete image with Adobe Photoshop 7.0.

Annotation of the BAC sequences and orthologous
locations in human
BAC clone sequences containing Pdu-Gsx (clone
233N17), and Pdu-Gsx and Pdu-Xlox (clone 76L3) were
assembled into a contig of approximately 220 kb with the
bl2seq program at the NCBI. Three BAC clones containing
Pdu-Cdx (174K23, 219I5, 155I15) were assembled into a
contig of approximately 230 kb. BAC sequences described
in this work are deposited in the Genbank with accession
numbers [Genbank: FJ001337–FJ001340].

To find additional genes in these contigs besides the ParaHox genes, the entire contig sequences were scanned with
GENSCAN and FGENESH (implemented at www.softberry.com [79]), and all predicted peptide sequences
searched against Genbank with BLASTP. Also, overlapping 10 kb windows of each contig were searched against
Genbank with BLASTX. Combining the output from each
of these approaches, models were excluded that contained
obviously repetitive sequences, low sequence similarities
to other bilaterians (less than 20%), or widespread stop
codons. Models with similarities to reverse transcriptases
or transposases were also excluded. GenomeScan was
used to refine the gene models, using the amino acid
sequences of proteins isolated by the BLASTP searches
above. Predicted amino acid translations of the putative
genes were aligned to candidate orthologues from other
taxa with ClustalX 1.83. For the ParaHox genes, phylogenetic trees were constructed with Bayesian (amino acid
substitution models were sampled in proportion to posterior probability using the model jumping command,
1,000,000 generations, MrBayes-3.1.2), Neighbour-Joining (ClustalX 1.83), and Maximum-Likelihood (JTT
model, 1,000 bootstrap replicates, Phyml_v2.4.4) analyses. Neighbour-Joining trees were also constructed for the
neighbouring genes (ClustalX 1.83) to help confirm their
identity. Genes were named according to the common
conserved domains, phylogenetic analysis and the latest
nomenclature of respective gene families. The orthologous gene locations in human were located according to
the Map Viewer (Human Build 36.2).
