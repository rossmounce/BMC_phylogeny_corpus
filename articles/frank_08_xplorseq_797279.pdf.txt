Abstract
Background: Advances in automated DNA sequencing technology have accelerated the
generation of metagenomic DNA sequences, especially environmental ribosomal RNA gene
(rDNA) sequences. As the scale of rDNA-based studies of microbial ecology has expanded, need
has arisen for software that is capable of managing, annotating, and analyzing the plethora of diverse
data accumulated in these projects.
Results: XplorSeq is a software package that facilitates the compilation, management and
phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences. XplorSeq was developed for, but is not limited to, highthroughput analysis of environmental rRNA gene sequences. XplorSeq integrates and extends
several commonly used UNIX-based analysis tools by use of a Macintosh OS-X-based graphical
user interface (GUI). Through this GUI, users may perform basic sequence import and assembly
steps (base-calling, vector/primer trimming, contig assembly), perform BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment and Search Tool; [1-3]) searches of NCBI and local databases, create multiple sequence
alignments, build phylogenetic trees, assemble Operational Taxonomic Units, estimate biodiversity
indices, and summarize data in a variety of formats. Furthermore, sequences may be annotated with
user-specified meta-data, which then can be used to sort data and organize analyses and reports.
A document-based architecture permits parallel analysis of sequence data from multiple clones or
amplicons, with sequences and other data stored in a single file.
Conclusion: XplorSeq should benefit researchers who are engaged in analyses of environmental
sequence data, especially those with little experience using bioinformatics software. Although
XplorSeq was developed for management of rDNA sequence data, it can be applied to most any
sequencing project. The application is available free of charge for non-commercial use at http://
vent.colorado.edu/phyloware.

Background
The recent explosions in culture-independent studies of
environmental DNA sequences ("metagenomics") and
automated DNA sequencing capabilities have prompted
the creation of numerous software applications designed
to aid the analysis of an avalanche of sequence data. How-

ever, many of the commonly used, freely available applications require some facility with the UNIX/Linux
operating system and/or specialized scripting languages to
either manipulate files in batch or pipe data between
applications. As automated DNA sequencing and
sequence analysis has become commonplace in laboratoPage 1 of 16

ries that do not specialize in bioinformatics, need has
arisen for the development of powerful, yet simple-to-use,
software.
XplorSeq, written for the Macintosh OS X operating system, provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that integrates the use of several popular UNIX-based DNA
sequence analysis applications. A number of additional
features have been incorporated in order to track, annotate, and analyze sequence information in a manner conducive
to
high-throughput
metagenomics.
Implementation of a common GUI (Fig. 1) eliminates the
need for the user to possess the kind of knowledge generally restricted to bioinformaticists and computer professionals: UNIX/Linux command shells (tsh, csh, or bash)
and associated scripting languages. By presenting a unified GUI, XplorSeq, simplifies sequence analysis projects
by allowing the user to focus on science, rather than the
details of disparate software.
XplorSeq was developed for rapid compilation and analysis of rDNA clone libraries, but should be applicable to
any sequencing project (computer hardware may, however, limit the scale of projects). Although several commercial and non-commercial software packages
implement some of the same basic functionalities as
XplorSeq, the development of XplorSeq was motivated by
the absence of GUI-based software designed specifically
for high-throughput, batch analysis of rDNA sequences,
such as arise from culture-independent metagenomic
studies. Specifically, the extant software could not accommodate the phylogenetic orientation of analyses and
sequence annotations that are most useful for metagenomics. In contrast, XplorSeq implements several domainspecific software tools (e.g. for state of the art phylogenetic
tree inference, OTU clustering, biodiversity estimates) that
are not available in general-purpose DNA analysis packages. Many published studies, from a variety of laboratories engaged in metagenomics, have used XplorSeq, and
thereby established its stability, ease-of-use, and capabilities [4-29]. The software is freely available for non-commercial use at http://vent.colorado.edu/phyloware.

Implementation
XplorSeq is written in Objective-C using the Cocoa application framework (Apple Inc.). Releases are compiled for
the OS X operating system (current versions require OS
10.4.x or 10.5.x) as universal binaries, which run natively
on Macintosh computers with Intel or PowerPC microprocessors. Similar to Cocoa, the architecture of XplorSeq
is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. XplorSeq is multi-threaded and can adjust its operation to accommodate multiple shared-memory
microprocessors.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/420

The rationale for implementing XplorSeq as a standalone
Macintosh application involved 1) desire for a highly
responsive, feature-rich graphical output, thus precluding
web-based applications; 2) recognition that the BSD-Unix
operating system underpinning OS X would allow leveraging of existing open-source software; 3) observation
that many computer novices (an intended audience for
this software) were more comfortable with OS X than
other operating systems; and 4) the maturity, stability,
and support inherent in the Cocoa application framework.
Third-party software packages and plugin executables
(sortx and biodiv) were written in C and C++. When possible, compiled executables are incorporated directly into
the XplorSeq application bundle (essentially, a hidden
directory structure) so that users can install and operate
XplorSeq without the need for local compilation or extensive configuration. Full implementation of XplorSeq
requires separate installation of phred and phrap
(obtained at http://www.phrap.org).

Results and discussion
The following sections outline the data structures and
analytic tools that form the basis of the XplorSeq workflow.
Data organization and GUI architecture
XplorSeq uses a document-based approach for project
data management in which multiple sequences and their
associated data are stored and accessed in a single file. As
a project evolves, sequences may be added, deleted,
amended and analyzed as needed. XplorSeq does not
enforce a highly constrained analytic schema and thereby
grants the user more autonomy in designing and implementing an analysis plan than typically is possible in a
hard-wired software pipeline.

Data are organized as a hierarchy of data objects (Fig 2),
which represent the model layer in XplorSeq's ModelView-Controller design pattern architecture. Each data
object class (e.g. Sequence, Project) is associated with a
window (the view layer) that is used to inspect data associated with particular instances of the class.
The top layer data object is the "Project", which stores all
other data and is synonymous with the document as a
whole. Hence, the main XplorSeq window (Fig 1) is the
Project Inspector window. Projects organize and manage
lists of "Clones", which represent individual cloned genes
or PCR amplicons. Clones, in turn, manage groups of
"Sequences" which map to unique DNA sequences.
Sequences can be imported directly (e.g. as polished GenBank sequences), read from DNA sequencer traces, or
assembled from other sequence objects ("contigs"). For

each sequence analyzed by BLAST, XplorSeq creates a
"BlastInfo" object that summarizes pertinent blast output
data: identity and phylogenetic lineage of the sequence's
closest BLAST hit, BLAST statistics, etc. Each Clone ranks
its constituent Sequence objects based on BLAST bit-score
and the "Best Sequence" (i.e. that with the highest bitscore) serves as a proxy for the entire Clone. "Oligo"

objects encapsulate data that describe oligonucleotide
sequences used in construction of clone libraries.
One of XplorSeq's more important design goals is to provide users with an extremely flexible and simple means of
annotating data objects with meta-data consisting of userspecified information. XplorSeq implements meta-data

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:420

through two strategies: 1) hard-coded data objects (i.e.
"BlastInfo" and "Oligo" objects) and 2) a customizable
"Metadata" object. Metadata objects are implemented as
key-value dictionaries (e.g. hashes, maps) that can be
linked to Project, Clone, and Sequence data objects. Users
specify keys and values for particular objects through
import of tab-delimited spreadsheets in which the first
column designates the names of objects (i.e. sequence/
clone names) and subsequent columns specify values
(keyed by column headings) to attach to the objects. Alternatively, object inspector windows provide GUI-based
features in which to display and edit meta-data (c.f., Figs.
3, 4, and 5).
Data display and control of data processing
A project's Clone, Sequence, and BlastInfo objects are displayed in the Project Inspector window (Fig. 1A), which
functions as the main XplorSeq window. Data are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/420

arranged hierarchically to reflect nesting of data structures. For each Clone, a summary of its best blast hit,
which includes the taxa name, percent sequence identity
and bit-score is displayed in the main XplorSeq window.
The phylogenetic lineage of the top blast hit can be
imported (through either an entrez idfetch query or
import of tab-delimited data) to provide information
about the taxonomic placement of a clone.
The user controls all steps of data processing by selecting
objects to be acted upon and then choosing a function
from menu items presented in the tool panel that extends
from the main XplorSeq window (Fig 1A). Methods to
import, export, and analyze data are accessible through
these menus. Below the menus lie controls through which
oligonucleotides used to generate PCR libraries can be
designated, if relevant to the project; entries in the oligo
menus can be modified through a preferences dialog.

Figure 3
Clone inspector window

reads and contigs) from the same amplified or cloned gene. The main window summarizes the top BLAST hit for the clone (i.e.
the sequence or contig BLAST hit with the highest bit-score). The phylogenetic lineage of the clone can be assigned at the bottom of the main window. The drawer to the right of the window presents the contents of the meta-data dictionary associated
with this clone.

Figure 4
Sequence inspector window
Sequence inspector window. Displays information associated with a selected sequence. Nucleotides are color-coded to
represent the quality scores of individual nucleotides (the legend at the bottom of the window shows the meaning of the
colors). Primers used to amplify the gene are summarized on the lower left. Basic summary statistics (length, trimmed length,
and number of nts > Q20) are presented in the lower right. The drawer to the right of the window presents the contents of
the meta-data dictionary associated with this sequence.
Project specific meta-data can be recorded in several text
fields presented in the Project window, under the "Project
Info" tab. An editable text box is presented in which the
user can enter comments, for instance details specific to a
project (Fig 1B).
By double-clicking on an entry in the Project window, the
user can display and edit more detailed information associated with that entry. For example, the Clone Inspector
window (Fig. 3) summarizes the content of the Clone
Object, including its top BLAST hit sequence and corresponding BlastInfo Object. The phylogenetic lineage and
domain of the Clone Object can be set through the controls at the bottom of the window. A panel extending from
the Clone Inspector window presents user-specified metadata associated with the Clone Object.
DNA sequences, including contig sequences, are displayed in a Sequence Inspector window (Fig. 4). Individ-

ual nucleotides are color-coded to represent quality scores
generated by the base-calling software (shades of blue) or
trimmed sequences (red). Basic sequence information,
such as primer sequences and trimmed sequence length, is
displayed in a set of text fields at the bottom of the
Sequence Inspector window. Similar to Clone Objects,
sequence specific meta-data can be viewed through a
panel that extends from the inspector window.
Tools for data import and analysis
Table 1 summarizes the key functions available through
XplorSeq. A user can perform base-calling on chromatograms generated by automated DNA sequencers, (through
tracetuner [30] or phred, [31,32]); trim away vector,
primer, and poor quality sequences; assemble contiguous
sequences (TIGR_Assembler [33] or phrap, [31]); search
for homologous sequences in sequence databases
(blastcl3 or blastall; [1-3]); format BLAST databases (formatdb), perform multiple sequence alignments (clusPage 6 of 16

talW; [34-36]); define Operational Taxonomic Units
(sortx; D.N. Frank, unpublished); calculate distance
matrices (phylip dnadist [37]); construct phylogenetic
trees (clearcut, [38]; phylip neighbor, [37]; RAxML, [39]);
and calculate a variety of biodiversity indices (biodiv;
D.N. Frank, unpublished). By integrating software tools
into a single application, XplorSeq facilitates seamless
workflow through the sequence analysis process. Many of
the key analytic steps are piped together, thus automating
data processing. All data analysis operations may be executed in batch so that multiple sequences can be processed with minimal user intervention.
XplorSeq facilitates batch BLAST [1-3] analyses of DNA
sequences through both networked and local searches of
nucleotide databases. Local BLAST searches require properly formatted sequence databases, which may be downloaded from NCBI http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov or created by
use of the formatdb executable (through XplorSeq or the
command line). XplorSeq dispatches sequences to the
appropriate client software (blastcl3 or blastall; [1-3]) and
then parses the resulting output file into BlastInfo
Objects.
XplorSeq provides graphical interfaces for several commonly used command-line phylogenetic tools are shown
in Fig. 6. Phylip modules for distance matrix calculation,
neighbor-joining/UPGMA trees, data-set bootstrapping,
and consensus tree generation are accessible through
these interfaces [37]. Similarly, fast neighbor-joining and
maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree inference are
available (clearcut [38] and RAxML [39], respectively). In
each case, following selection of the appropriate options,
sequence data are exported in the required format, the
analysis performed, and results imported (if appropriate)
into XplorSeq. For tasks that may take prolonged time to
execute (e.g. RAxML [39]), a file listing the command-line
invocation of the program is saved along with all data
required for the task; these files can be transferred to
another computer for subsequent execution of the
scripted command.
OTU clustering is implemented through the program
sortx, which was written in tandem with XplorSeq (Fig.
6F). Sortx uses a fast radial clustering algorithm to bin
aligned sequences based on uncorrected pairwise
sequence distances (%ID). Clusters can be assembled
based on furthest-, mean-, or nearest-neighbor rules. Following cluster formation, sortx selects a representative

sequence for each cluster, which maximizes both pairwise
similarity to other cluster members and sequence length
(simply choosing the sequence with minimum pairwise
distance could select for short, but well-conserved
sequences, which would not necessarily be representative
of the cluster). Finally, the user can select a range of pairwise sequence distance thresholds by which to assemble
OTUs in order to create multiple data sets at different phylogenetic depths.
Estimates of biodiversity indices (species richness, diversity, evenness) can be reported through either of two
modes. First, the export function OTU Diversity... reports
basic calculations of commonly used indices (Sobs, Schao1,
CACE, Good's coverage, Shannon diversity; [40]) for a set
of selected sequences. Alternatively, the same biodiversity
estimates can be made in a more thorough manner
through execution of the analysis function Biodiversity
(biodiv)..., which invokes the program biodiv, a standalone command-line tool built in conjunction with
XplorSeq. As shown in Fig. 6G, the user selects OTUs definitions for the selected sequences through choice of
meta-data options. To compare indices between different
groups of sequences, the user can also select multiple
"environments" by which to differentiate the sequence
subsets; biodiv then performs separate analyses for each
designated environment. Biodiv performs random resampling of OTUs and calculates collector's curves and associated biodiversity indices as a function of sampling effort
[41]. Biodiv also reports rarefied biodiversity indices,
based on resampling, with 95% confidence intervals for
each type of environment [41].
Tools for data export and transformation
XplorSeq provides several features by which to export
sequences and data for further analyses. Data reports are
generated in tab-delimited format for import into spreadsheets. A particularly useful export feature tabulates
sequence abundances and/or prevalences on the basis of
user-defined terms that define how data are categorized
and enumerated. For instance, as shown in Fig. 7, the user
has opted to create a table in which rows are defined by
meta-data that specify OTUs and columns are specified by
meta-data that organize samples by the results of a PCR
assay; alternatively, similar sequences can be grouped by
BLAST results, or phylogenetic lineage. The cells of the
output tables enumerate the abundance or presence/
absence of sequences for a given row and column (Additional file 1).

sequence data. In this example, rows are defined by the values of a meta-data key (e.g. 97% OTUs), while columns are defined
by the value associated with another meta-data key (e.g. PCR results). The "Data Format" panel specifies that sequence counts
in each column are normalized to the total of each column.

Preparation of sequence data for submission to public
databases can be tedious and error-prone, despite the
availability of tools such as NCBI's sequin software tool.
XplorSeq can facilitate the submission process by automating the organization of sequences and their annotations into a form suitable for input into sequin (Fig. 8).
The user can modify the output of the sequin script export
function to include or exclude particular information and
to tailor GenBank descriptors and/or features (e.g. Locus,
Definition, Molecule fields).
For detailed phylogenetic studies, sequences assembled
by XplorSeq can be exported in formats suitable for input
into other software packages, such as ARB [42], DOTUR
[43], NAST [44], SILVA [45], or UniFrac [46]. Users can
choose sequences to be exported by selecting particular
objects or through filters for sequence length, bit-score,
type of sequence (i.e. contig vs. raw sequence), or other
meta-data. Finally, "placeholder" Newick-formatted phylogenetic trees can be exported in order to select specific
subsets of sequences in tree visualization software such as
ARB. In this format, taxa belonging to user-defined subsets (categorized, for instance, through specific meta-data)
are placed in clades and assigned artificial branch-lengths
of 0.1; inter-group distances are set to 0.9, which produces
a well-demarcated organization of sequences into
assigned groups. Import of such a tree into ARB allows
rapid, graphical marking of different sets of taxa (Fig. 9),
the results of which are propagated to other "real" trees in
ARB.
Performance issues
The data analysis tools employed by XplorSeq (e.g. phred,
phrap, blast, sortx, biodiv) are invoked in separate
threads, so that multiple tasks can be run in parallel. During these steps, feedback to the GUI is limited in order to
minimize the overhead of performing analyses through
XplorSeq. Typical latencies associated with XplorSeq contribute no more than an additional ~10% to the total
elapsed time required for an analysis, relative to the same
task performed through command line execution of the
underlying 3rd party software (Table 2). This overhead is
due primarily to data import/export and parsing of
results, which add value to the functionalities provided by
command line utilities. Consequently, XplorSeq should
not place any undue limitations on the use of commandline software to process and analyze sequence data,
beyond those inherent in the computer system and/or
software tool being used. In other words, tasks that can be
performed on a particular Macintosh system through the
command line should also be feasible through XplorSeq.

The XplorSeq file format, implemented using the Cocoa
software framework, does not significantly add to the size

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/420

of data files. For example, an XplorSeq file containing an
alignment of 250,000 rRNA sequences (1585 nucleotides
per sequence) requires 396 megabytes (MB) of storage,
compared to 381 MB for a fasta formated file storing the
same alignment. The addition of metadata, such as blast
results, increases file size in roughly linear proportion to
the size of parsed input text.
Although the use of a flat file format by XplorSeq greatly
simplifies data storage and transfer, it does require that all
data be read into memory before being manipulated. For
relatively large files, bottlenecks are apparent primarily in
tasks requiring import and export of data. Thus, sequence
analysis projects are likely to be limited as much by computer hardware (e.g., quantity of random access memory
and bus speeds) and the performance of underlying 3rd
party software tools as by XplorSeq. However, the
XplorSeq environment is scalable from laptops to more
advanced workstations (e.g., 8-core/32 GB systems currently available) so its capabilities can be expanded as
need arises and hardware evolves.
As a rough guide to system requirements, Table 2 presents
benchmark comparisons of common XplorSeq tasks performed on a laptop and a workstation. To open the
250,000 sequence XplorSeq alignment file described
above, for example, requires ~130 or ~12 seconds, on the
laptop or workstation, respectively. Test datasets of 1 ×
106 25-nucleotide sequences can be manipulated with
similar lag times. More fully annotated files containing
~50,000 16S rRNA sequences, each of length ~1000
nucleotides, have been used routinely on a laptop with little performance degradation [17,23,27]. However,
projects with > 50,000 annotated sequences likely will
require higher performance workstations to insure the
responsiveness customary to users of GUI-based software.
Alternatively, sequence data can be spread across multiple
files, each of which maintains information generated
from a particular experiment (e.g. a PCR amplicon
library). More complex data storage strategies, such as the
use of application-specific databases may be implemented
in the future if they do not compromise the XplorSeq philosophy of ease of software installation and use.

Conclusion
Although XplorSeq was developed to expedite the phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene libraries,
it should prove useful in any sequencing project, particularly ones facilitated by batch analysis of multiple clones.
Moreover, any UNIX-based DNA sequence analysis tool
that can be ported to Mac OSX can be readily incorporated
into XplorSeq. Suggestions for the addition of other modules to the XplorSeq package are most welcome.
