Abstract
Background: In Pseudomonas putida and Pseduomonas aeruginosa, the similar PpuR/RsaL/PpuI and
LasR/RsaL/LasI acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) quorum sensing (QS) systems have been shown
to be under considerable regulation by other global regulators. A major regulator is the RsaL
protein which strongly directly represses the transcription of the P. putida ppuI and P. aeruginosa
lasI AHL synthases. In this study we screened a transposon mutant bank of P. putida in order to
identify if any other regulators were involved in negative regulation of AHL QS.
Results: In our screen we identified three Tn5 mutants which displayed overproduction of AHLs
in P. putida strain WCS358. Two of the mutants had a Tn5 located in the rsaL gene, whereas in one
mutant the transposon was located in the lon protease gene. Lon proteases play important roles in
protein quality control via degradation of misfolded proteins. It was determined that in the P. putida
lon mutant, AHL levels, PpuR levels and ppuI promoter activity all increased significantly; we
therefore postulated that PpuR is a target for Lon. The Lon protease had no effect on AHL
production in P. aeruginosa.
Conclusion: The Lon protease is a negative regulator of AHL production in P. putida WCS358.
The Lon protease has also been shown by others to influence AHL QS in Vibrio fischeri and
Agrobacterium tumefaciens and can thus become an important regulator of AHL QS timing and
regulation in bacteria.

Background
Quorum sensing (QS) is a common form of gene regulation based on cell-density involving intercellular communication relying on the production and response to
signaling molecules [1,2]. In Gram-negative bacteria, acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are the most common signal
molecules which were first described in the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri as being involved in the cell-density
dependent regulation of bioluminescence [1,3]. The general mechanism of AHL QS relies on two proteins belong-

ing to the LuxI and LuxR protein families. LuxI-family
proteins are the major class of AHL synthase enzymes
whereas LuxR-family proteins form complexes with AHLs
which are then able to bind at specific DNA promoter
sequences (called lux-type boxes) of QS regulated genes
affecting their expression.
AHL QS has become a paradigm for bacterial communication having the common scheme that AHLs are produced
at a basal level at low cell densities. At high cell densities,

the concentrations of AHLs surpasses a certain threshold
(corresponding to the "quorum" cell density) allowing
interaction with the LuxR-family protein and the system
then usually undergoes positive feedback through
increase of expression of the luxI-family gene resulting in
strong sudden activation of AHL QS. This cell-density
dependent response has evolved as a means to provide
advantages to a community of bacteria by synchronizing
group behavior. AHL QS has been studied in several
Gram-negative bacteria and the physiological processes
controlled by this system are diverse but are often related
to virulence in pathogenic organisms [1,2,4,5].
The AHL QS systems are not always rigorously responding
to cell-density as they are often integrated with other global regulatory responses and are thus influenced by other
environmental factors [6-8]. Several systematic studies in
Pseudomonas aeruginosa have shown that AHL QS is a global regulatory network controlling the expression of over
300 genes [9-11]. Recently other regulon studies in P. aeruginosa have demonstrated that the RpoS, VqsR and PprB
global regulators are intimately interconnected with AHL
QS regulons [8]. This is probably why some AHL QS systems are themselves regulated in response to various stimuli ensuring a timely control at the appropriate
environmental conditions. In fact, the regulation of AHL
QS has been particularly studied in P. aeruginosa highlighting that the luxI/LuxI and luxR/LuxR family genes/
proteins are themselves extensively regulated. Positive regulation of the lasI/R and rhlI/R, the two AHL QS systems
homologs of luxI/R present in P. aeruginosa, occurs via
transcriptional regulators such as GacA, Vfr and PprB
(reviewed by [6-8]). At present however it is not known
whether any of these positive regulators are acting directly
on the AHL QS genes and the precise stimuli affecting
these positive regulatory responses are also not clear.
Other regulators repress AHL QS in P. aeruginosa likely to
ensure that it is not activated at low cell-densities. Reports
of these negative regulators include the H-NS like protein
MvaT, the luxR-like orphan QscR, the post-transcriptional
regulator RsmA, the alternative sigma factors RpoS and
RpoN, and the newly characterized RsaL repressor
(reviewed by [6-8]). Of these repressors only RsaL has
been shown to regulate directly the AHL QS genes; more
precisely it regulates the expression of the lasI AHL synthase by binding to its promoter repressing transcription
[12,13]. Interestingly we also reported that RsaL is a major
negative regulator of AHL QS in Pseudomonas putida [14].
Unlike in P. aeruginosa however, in strain WCS358 there is
only one AHL QS system, designated PpuI/R, which produces and responds to N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine
lactone (C12-3-oxo-AHL); this system is highly identical
to the LasI/R system of P. aeruginosa [13,14]. Localized in
between the ppuI/R genes is the small rsaL repressor which
when inactivated results in dramatic increase of ppuI

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/71

expression and hence AHL production [14]. In P. putida
RsaL repression of the AHL synthase gene appears to be
much stronger that in P. aeruginosa [12,14].
In this study we were interested to investigate whether in
P. putida WCS358 other negative ppuI/R (or PpuI/R) AHL
QS regulators, either acting in concert with RsaL or independently, are present. By screening a Tn5 genomic
mutant bank of strain WCS358 a negative regulatory
mutant of AHL QS was identified and characterized to be
inactivating a gene encoding for a Lon-like protease. It was
demonstrated that this protease targeted PpuR thus affecting PpuR protein levels indicating that it is involved in
regulating the AHL QS system.

Results and Discussion
Identification and characterization of AHL-overproducing
mutants of P. putida WCS358
In order to establish whether, besides RsaL, there were
other negative regulators of the ppuI/R system, we
screened P. putida WCS358 Tn5 genomic mutants for AHL
overproduction. The genetic screen we employed here has
been previously described relying on the AHL biosensor
C. violaceum CVO26 [14,15]. P. putida WCS358 promotes
little pigment formation in the AHL biosensor strain
CVO26 because it produces very low quantities of AHLs as
well as producing AHLs which have low specificity
towards CviR of strain CVO26. In order to identify AHLoverproducing mutants we spread between 1000–2000
CVO26 cfu (colony forming units) and 300–500 P. putida
WCS358 Tn5 mutant cfu from a Tn5 mutant bank on one
plate and screened for strong purple loci. After screening
25,000 WCS358 Tn5 mutants, three mutants were scored
which significantly induced violacein purple pigment production in CVO26. Two mutants were localized in the rsaL
gene which as previously reported is an important negative regulator of ppuI expression and its inactivation leads
to a dramatic increase of AHL production [14]. One
mutant did not map in the rsaL gene and had the Tn5
inserted in an ORF of 2397 nucleotides encoding a protein of 798 amino acids (Figure 1). This ORF displayed
high homology to the Lon proteases of several bacteria;
over 90 % identity with proteins form several Pseudomonas
sp. including the Lon protease of P. aeruginosa ([16];
PA1803). The Lon protein belongs to the family of ATPdependent proteases which is well conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and has been associated with various
cellular activities [17]. Lon proteases play important roles
in protein quality control via degradation of misfolded
proteins. Lon proteolysis can also be crucial for controlling the protein levels of regulatory proteins thus affecting
programs of gene expression [17].

This lon protease mutant identified here was designated P.
putida IBE4 and produced three times more C12-3-oxo-

AHL as determined through AHL quantification experiments as well as through TLC analysis (Figure 2 and Figure
4). This increase of AHL production was also justified by
higher ppuI promoter activity; ppuI encodes for PpuI the
AHL synthase enzyme (Figure 3A). As previously reported
[14]ppuI expression does not increase with cell-density
and is low in the wild-type as the QS system is strongly
negatively regulated by RsaL. In fact in P. putida RsaL
appears to be the on/off switch of the system. It not
known yet what is the stimulus which leads to RsaL derepression. It is clear however form our data that absence
of Lon increases significantly ppuI transcription. Similarly,
also the rsaL quorum sensing PpuR-regulated promoter
displayed significantly higher activities in the lon protease
mutant (Figure 3B). Importantly, by providing the lon
protease in trans via plasmid pBBRlon, which carries the
cloned genomic locus harbouring the lon protease gene
expressed from its own promoter, C12-3-oxo-AHL levels,
and ppuI and rsaL promoter activities were restored to
wild-type levels (Figures 2, 3 and 4). From the TLC analysis it was actually observed that extra copies of lon gene
carried in a plasmid dramatically reduced AHL production (Figure 4). It was therefore postulated that Lon could
target some component(s) of the PpuI/RsaL/PpuI AHL
system being therefore involved in QS regulation in P. putida.
The P. putida Lon protease affects PpuR protein levels
Having established that the lon knock-out mutant P. putida IBE4 resulted in increased ppuI promoter activity and
hence higher AHL production it was of interest to determine if the possible target of the Lon protease was the
PpuR protein. The reason being that as PpuR positively
regulates ppuI and rsaL expression in a positive induction
loop typical of LuxI/R-type QS systems, altering PpuR levels could therefore affect AHL production through ppuI
and rsaL promoter activities. In order to determine if PpuR

was a target of the Lon protease we raised polyclonal antibodies against PpuR in order to visualize PpuR protein
levels. We therefore examined levels of PpuR in 16-h-old
stationary phase cultures of P. putida WCS358 and lon protease knock-out mutant P. putida IBE4 using anti-PpuR
antibodies. The levels of PpuR protein were found to be
very low and hardly detectable in strain WCS358; this also
reflected the very low ppuR promoter activities which were
previously observed [14]. In order to be able to better visualize PpuR levels we introduced in both the wild type
and mutant derivative IBE4, the plasmid pBBRppuR
which carries the ppuR gene expressed from the lac promoter (Figure 1; Table 1). As depicted in Figure 5, PpuR
levels in P. putida IBE4 were detected as being significantly
higher than those in the wild type parent strain indicating
that absence of the Lon protease resulted in larger
amounts of PpuR present in the cell. This experiment was
reproducible being repeated three times obtaining similar
results also loading different amounts of total proteins
(data not shown). We verified that ppuR promoter activity
in the lon mutant was not affected (data not shown) in

order to exclude that Lon might have been acting on other
proteins components affecting ppuR transcription. This
provides indirect evidence that the Lon protease targets
PpuR thus being able to regulate quorum sensing in P.
putida. Other LuxR-family quorum sensing regulators
have also been shown to be targeted by the Lon protease.
The TraR protein of Agrobacterium tumefaciens was shown
to be susceptible to Lon proteolysis when free of AHL-ligand [18]. Similarly, LuxR of Vibrio fischeri complexes in
vivo with Lon degrading it; in a Lon mutant it was also
observed that LuxR accumulates at higher levels [19]. It
therefore appears that many members of this family could
be targets of the Lon protease in order to control their levels; Lon can consequently be regarded as a regulator of
quorum sensing ensuring the correct timing of the
response. At present we do not know whether the lon/Lon
protease is itself regulated thus adding a further element(s) of control of QS in P. putida. Regulation of QS in
Pseudomonas has been shown to be very complex and intricate involving a myriad of global regulators; this indicates
that timing and response of the QS system is important
and the Lon protease must now be added to this regulatory circuit. Other proteases have also been implicated in
targeting members of the LuxR-protein family [18]. Lon
has also been reported to affect the accumulation of several other types of transcriptional regulators in bacteria
thus affecting transcription of important global regulatory
systems [17,20-22]. For example, Lon influences the regulation of antibiotic production in Pseudomonas fluorescens
Pf-5 through what is postulated to be degradation of of a
positive regulator [21]. In P. aeruginosa, the Lon protease
was found to be important for biofilm formation and
motility [20] and pathogenicity and type III secretion in
Pseudomonas syringae are regulated by Lon via an effect on
the stability of transcriptional regulators [19].

The P. aeruginosa Lon protease does not affect C12-3oxo-AHL production
The Lon protease of P. putida WCS358 displayed almost
90% amino acid identity over the entire length of the protein with the Lon protease of P. aeruginosa (PA1803; [16]).
In addition, the PpuI/RsaL/PpuR AHL QS system of strain
WCS358 is highly similar to the LasI/RsaL/LasR of P. aeruginosa; they both produce and respond to C12-3-oxoAHL and the three proteins are highly identical [12-14].
Since the two species are very close phylogenetically and
the two AHL QS systems are orthologs with PpuR and
LasR being highly identical, it was of interest to determine
if also in P. aeruginosa the Lon protease played a role in
AHL QS regulation. We therefore determined C12-3-oxoAHL levels in wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 and lon protease mutant P. aeruginosa 18577. Differently to what
occurs in P. putida WCS358, the lon protease knock-out
mutant of P. aeruginosa produced comparable amounts of
C12-3-oxo-AHL to wild-type parent strain PAO1 (Figure
6). This indicated that unlike what occurred in P. putida
WCS358, in P. aeruginosa, Lon most probably does not
target proteins of the LasI/RsaL/LasR AHL QS system. It
was observed however that in the P. aeruginosa PAO1
genome, an ORF of 795 amino acids (PA0779) displayed
40% identity with the Lon protease is present thus it cannot be excluded that other similar proteases are present
which can target protein(s) of AHL QS systems.

Conclusion
In this study we determined that the Lon protease is a negative regulator of AHL production in P. putida WCS358.
AHL production and response in WCS358 occurs via the
PpuR/RsaL/PpuI AHL QS system; this system is highly
homologous to the LasR/RsaL/LasI system of P. aeruginosa. It was observed that in a Lon mutant, C12-3-oxoAHL levels, PpuR levels and ppuI promoter activity all
increase significantly; we therefore postulated that PpuR is
a target for Lon. Unlike what occurs in P. putida WCS358,
in P. aeruginosa Lon has no effect on AHL production. It
was however observed that P. aeruginosa possesses in its
genome another ORF with very similar features to Lon
thus it cannot be excluded that other proteases could be
involved in AHL QS regulation. As two other LuxR family
regulators have been shown to be targeted by Lon, it is
concluded that proteases could play an important role in
AHL QS timing and regulation.

18577. C12-3-oxo-AHL was extracted from spent supernatants, AHL levels were measured with P. putida SM17
(prsaL220) with a volume of extract corresponding to an
amount of 5 × 108 cfu as described in the Methods section.
C12-3-oxo-AHL levels is proportional to β-galactosidase
activity (Miller Units). Standard deviation bars are given on
the mean value of three independent cultures. Differences
between PAO1 and PAO1 ID18577, analysed using T-test for
independent groups were not significant (t = 2.2; p = .06; df =
6;t(6) = 2.2). The same measurement was also performed
using 1 µM of synthetic C12-3-oxo-AHL (obtained from P.
Williams, University of Nottingham, UK).

described previously [25]. Southern hybridizations were
performed using N+Hybond membrane (Amersham Biosciences); plasmids were purified using the Jet star colums
(Genomed, GmbH, Germany) or with the alkaline lysis
method [26]; total DNA from Pseudomonas was isolated by
Sarkosyl/Pronase lysis as described previously [27]. Triparental matings between E. coli and P. putida were carried
out with the helper strain E. coli DH5α (pRK2013) [28].
Isolation of an AHL over-expressing genomic mutant and
cloning of a lon-like protease of P. putida WCS358
In order to identify P. putida WCS358 mutants that overproduce AHL, a Tn5 genomic mutant library was screened
against the AHL biosensor strain C. violaceum CVO26. P.
putida WCS358 induced only slightly pigmentation when
streaked in close proximity to strain C. violaceum CVO26.
This screening for AHL over-producers used here was previously employed to isolate rsaL mutants on P. putida
WCS358 [14]. 25,000 Tn5 genomic mutants of P. putida
WCS358 were screened against CVO26 for AHL overproducer mutants as previously described [14,15]. This led to
the identification of one Tn5 mutant (designated P. putida
IBE4), of which the Tn5 was not located in the rsaL gene

and could induce strongly pigmentation of CVO26. The
position of the Tn5 was determined after cloning from the
mutant IBE4 chromosome a 4.2 kb BamHI-StuI fragment
in pBluescript KS yielding pSCHIA5, which contained part
of Tn5 (including the Km resistance gene) and part of
adjacent WCS358 DNA. The adjacent DNA to the Tn5 was
sequenced using as primer the oligonucleotide sequence
Tn5ext (see Table 1) which was designed against the border of the Tn5 DNA sequence. The 4.2 kb BamHI-StuI
fragment was then used as a probe to clone a 4.5 kb EcoRI
from the chromosome of parent strain WCS358 in pBluescript KS yielding pB1A. This latter EcoRI fragment was
sequenced (sequencing service, CRIBI, University of
Padua, Padua, I) revealing that the Tn5 was positioned
within an ORF of 2397 nucleotides encoding for a putative Lon-like protease of 799 amino acids (Figure 1).
Reporter gene fusion assay
β-galactosidase activities were determined during growth
in LB medium essentially as described by Miller et al., [29]
with the modifications of Stachel et al. [30]. All experiments were performed in triplicate and the mean value is
given. The growth curves of all mutants were comparable
to the one obtained for the parent strain.
Purification and quantification of C12-3-oxo-AHL
The purification, detection and characterization of AHLs
were performed as previously described [23,31]. Pseudomonas strains were grown O/N in M9 minimal medium
supplemented with citric acid and the OD600 was measured. The spent culture supernatants were extracted two
times with the same culture volume of ethyl acetate-0.1%
acetic acid. The extracts were then dried and resuspended
in ethyl acetate with an amount which resulted in 1 µl of
final extract corresponding to 2 × 107 cells of the original
culture. The quantity of C12-3-oxo-AHL in the extracts
was determined using the specific 3-oxo-C12-AHL sensor
P. putida SM17 (prsal220) as previously described [13].
Briefly, P. putida SM17 is a double mutant of ppuI and rsaL
genes consequently it does not produce the RsaL repressor
and 3-oxo-C12-AHL. Adding exogenous 3-oxo-C12-AHL
is quantified through β-galactosidase activity by using
stain SM17 harboring (prsal220); this plasmid contains
the PpuR-3-oxo-C12-AHL regulated rsaL promoter fused
to promoterless lacZ gene. Overnight cultures of
SM17(prsal220) were diluted in 10 ml of LB medium to
an A660 of 0.1; the AHL extract to be quantified was then
added and after 6 hours of growth β-galactosidase activity
was determined. This 3-oxo-C12-AHL bacterial sensor has
a linear dose response between 0.1 µM to 5 µM of 3-oxoC12-AHL. Synthetic 3-oxo-C12-AHL was used as standard
molecules (obtained from P. Williams, University of Nottingham, UK). The detection of the AHLs on the TLC plate
was obtained overlaying the TLC plate with a thin layer of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/71

LB top-agar seeded with E. coli (pSB1075) as previously
described [14,31,32].
PpuR antibodies and protein anaylsis
Antibodies against PpuR of P. putida were generated by
injecting purified protein into rabbits. P. putida PpuR was
purified as PpuR-His6 using expression plasmid pET28b
(Novagen); ppuR was cloned as a 729 PCR fragment originated from primers FW121 and FW122 using P. putida
WC358 genomic DNA as template and was cloned as a
NcoI-HindIII fragment in pET28b yielding pPPUR3586H.
This latter plasmid was introduced in E. coli
BL21(DE3)pLys (Novagen) which then resulted in the
isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside-induced
overexpression of PpuR tagged with six histidines at the C- terminus. The purification of PpuR-His6 was then carried
out by Ni 2+ affinity under denaturing conditions according to the standard procedure suggested by the column
manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.).

Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore) using a tank system according to the
manufacturer's instruction. The membrane was subjected
to Western analysis using anti-PpuR polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits and polyclonal goat anti rabbit immunoglobulins HRP (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, DK) and
developed using Immun-Star HRP Substrate kit (BioRad
laboratories, Hercules CA, USA). No significant crossreaction of the polyclonal antibody against other P. putida
WCS358 proteins was observed in this study.
DNA sequencing and nucleotide sequence accession
numbers
All DNA sequences were performed at the CRIBI center
(University of Padua, Italy) and the nucleotide sequence
of the 4.414 EcoRI fragment has been deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under the following accession number
AM690373.
