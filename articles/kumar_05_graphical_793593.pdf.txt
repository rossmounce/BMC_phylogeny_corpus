Abstract
Background: Taxon specific hybridization probes in combination with a variety of commonly used
hybridization formats nowadays are standard tools in microbial identification. A frequently applied
technology, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), besides single cell identification, allows the
localization and functional studies of the microbial community composition. Careful in silico design
and evaluation of potential oligonucleotide probe targets is therefore crucial for performing
successful hybridization experiments.
Results: The PROBE Design tools of the ARB software package take into consideration several
criteria such as number, position and quality of diagnostic sequence differences while designing
oligonucleotide probes. Additionally, new visualization tools were developed to enable the user to
easily examine further sequence associated criteria such as higher order structure, conservation,
G+C content, transition-transversion profiles and in situ target accessibility patterns. The different
types of sequence associated information (SAI) can be visualized by user defined background colors
within the ARB primary and secondary structure editors as well as in the PROBE Match tool.
Conclusion: Using this tool, in silico probe design and evaluation can be performed with respect
to in situ probe accessibility data. The evaluation of proposed probe targets with respect to higherorder rRNA structure is of importance for successful design and performance of in situ
hybridization experiments. The entire ARB software package along with the probe accessibility data
is available from the ARB home page http://www.arb-home.de.

Background
The introduction and use of comparative sequence analysis of appropriate marker genes as a powerful tool in tax-

onomy has substantially contributed to the rapid growth
of molecular sequence databases such as EMBL [1], GenBank [2], and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) databases [3-5].

Evidently, molecular phylogenetic analyses have greatly
influenced the restructuring of systematics especially in
the case of prokaryotes. Nowadays, identification and
classification at the species and higher taxonomic levels
mainly relies on a genotypic approach, typically involving
an analysis of small, and to a lesser extent, large ribosomal
RNA gene (rRNA) structures. The backbone of the current
taxonomy of the prokaryotes is almost exclusively based
upon a phylogenetic network derived from comparative
sequence analysis of the small subunit rRNAs and respective phylogenetic marker genes [6]. As 'living fossils', these
molecules at least roughly reflect the evolutionary history
of the respective organisms. The mosaic-like primary
structures comprising highly variable to highly conserved
or invariant regions provide diagnostic information for
different levels of phylogenetic relationship. Consequently, this information can be used to identify oligonucleotide target regions unique to phylogenetic entities, for
use as taxon-specific hybridization probes or PCR primers. Depending on the target site such oligonucleotide
probes or probe combinations can be designed for phylogenetic groupings as diverse as bacterial species or an
entire phylum.
Ever since the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
technique became an integral part of the rRNA approach
to microbial ecology and evolution [7], rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes have evolved into a widely used tool
for the direct, cultivation-independent identification and
enumeration of individual microbial cells or specific
groups of bacteria in simple to complex natural environments. In this regard, a good probe design and careful further evaluation in silico plays a crucial role to ensure
sensitivity and specificity of a potential probe in its practical application. Besides uniqueness of the target sequence,
number, character and position of diagnostic residues,
comprehensiveness with respect to the inclusion of members of the desired target group (taxon) and exclusion of
non-members along with a target molecule or region
accessibility in the real hybridization experiment, have to
be taken into consideration. Recently, data on in situ
accessibility of rRNA targets in several microorganisms
have become available [8-11].
Since biology is a highly visual science, there is a general
demand for tools to visualise the variety of biological
knowledge as diagrams, illustrations, two-dimensional
and three-dimensional reconstructions, and other types of
graphical formats. Hence, the visualization of molecular
data in an interactive and intuitive graphical user interface
ideally will serve as third eye for a molecular biologist. In
this paper, we describe how the ARB software package [3]
provides a workbench for designing, evaluation and visualization of oligonucleotide probes in more intuitive way,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/61

using interactive graphical user interface to visually examine characteristics and criteria of target regions.

Implementation
Sequence data
Periodically retrieved raw gene data comprising small subunit rRNA from public databases such as EBI [1], Genbank
[2], the RDP[4], and the sequence data determined in our
laboratory and other partner groups are imported into the
ARB database, processed according to a variety of criteria
and finally provided as curated databases at the ARB
projects web-site [13]. The current public release of small
subunit rRNA database [3] containing only complete
sequences was taken for designing, evaluation and visualization of probes and targets, respectively. Partial
sequences are avoided as they greatly limit the probe
design by reducing the number of potential target regions
and also give no hint about the specificity of existing
probes that target to non-sequenced regions of the respective rRNAs.
The positional tree (PT) server
The PT-Server [3] is a suffix tree server implemented in the
ARB software which is used for indexing all sequence data
represented in the underlying ARB sequence database.
Once established, the particular PT-Server allows rapid
and exact searching for target regions with respect to
sequence identity or uniqueness.
Probe design and probe match
Probe design is carried out using the PROBE Design tool
(PDT) of ARB software involving following steps:

1. The user selects the target group or a species of interest.
2. The parameters such as size of the probe and the probable physico-chemical characteristics like %GC content,
melting temperature (Tm) according to the 4°C GC, 2°C
AT rule [14], and self-complementarity (hair-pin bonds)
are specified. Optionally, a range of allowed target positions within the sequence alignment of the respective
database can be defined.
3. Potential probe candidates are searched involving the
respective PT-Server. Both, target and probe sequence are
displayed in a result list. Ranking within this list follows
estimated probe quality according to criteria defined for
probe design such as number, character and position of
diagnostic residues, coverage of the target group, physicochemical demands, which are displayed in separate probe
results window along with relevant information.
4. Once the user selects the desired probe in the result list,
it can be evaluated against the entire database by using the
PROBE Match tool (PMT) of ARB. PMT, by default

the database. Optionally, the complementary sequence
(opposite strand) can be evaluated as well. Members of
the target group are displayed in a separate PROBE Match
window along with other information such as number of
mismatches, weighted mismatches, E. coli positions,
reverse complementarity and local alignment of probe targets (Figure 1).

Results and discussion
As the demand for oligonucleotide probes that can identify and quantify bacteria by nucleic acid hybridization is
permanently increasing, in silico evaluation and visualiza-

tion of such probes and targets are necessary, particularly,
when used for FISH experiments. Target accessibility is
among the crucial criteria to be evaluated with respect to
experimental success of the respective probe based identification and detection system [7-12]. To facilitate this
evaluation procedure, new functionalities were added to
the ARB software package providing a more intuitive
graphical environment. As an example, oligonucleotide
probes were designed for the enterobacteria group represented by 947 database entries. The 5'-UGGAGGGGGAUAACUACU-3' probe was selected from the list
of potential probes and evaluated against the background
of the full dataset of complete and partial small subunit

rRNA sequences. The selected probe perfectly matches the
respective target of 497 members of the enterobacteria
group (Figure 1). The same probe has been visualized in
all the screenshots presented in the paper.
Although a phylogenetic probe is primarily judged in
terms of its taxonomic range to identify the members of its
intended target taxon to the exclusion of non-target bacteria, for a practical consideration it must also fulfil certain
other criteria with respect to its applicability depending
on the particular hybridization format. In case of the fluorescence in situ hybridization approach the results of the

accessibility studies conducted by Fuchs and co-workers
on the 16S and 23S rRNA of Escherichia coli and other
organisms are among such criteria. They showed that
some regions of E. coli ribosome are virtually inaccessible
for oligonucleotide probes when FISH is performed [8,9].
They proposed a color code assigned to six intensity
classes of in situ hybridization signals. Within the ARB
program, these classes are coded in respective SAIs (so
called Sequence Associated Information) and optionally
visualized as background colors of the sequences in primary structure (ARB_Edit4), secondary structure
(SEC_Edit), and probe visualization windows (PROBE

are automatically updated in other windows as well.
Simultaneous visualization and evaluation of oligonucleotide probes in different levels allows the user to look
carefully and closely into the proposed probe candidates
in silico, before carrying out further in situ or in vivo studies.
More importantly, the user can perform a variety of
sequence related operations such as importing sequence
data, aligning, treeing, designing, evaluation and visualization of probes, performing statistical calculations and
many other functions using interoperating and user
friendly tools controlled from a common graphical platform within the ARB software package.

Visualization of potential probe candidates and the
sequence associated information (SAI) such as higher
order structure, conservation, G+C content, transitiontransversion profiles and in situ target accessibility patterns, is possible at three different levels: the local alignment (PROBE Match tool), global alignment (ARB
Primary Structure Editor) and secondary structure levels
(Secondary Structure Editor).

from the database. A local alignment of the extracted
rRNA sequence is established and displayed along with
the respective unique identifier such as ARB short_name,

underlying database in the user-defined colors and

SAIs mentioned before. By scrolling the mouse or the use
of ARB search tools, the user gets an easy access to the
information for any range or the selection of sequences. In
the context of probe evaluation for in situ hybridization
experiments, mapping of experimentally derived in situ
accessibility patterns onto the primary structures of interest certainly provides valuable support to the users for
probe evaluation. Part of a multiple 16S rRNA sequence
alignment is shown in the figure 5. The brightness classes
defined for 16S rRNA structural model of Methanosaeta
sedula [11] are mapped on the aligned sequences and indicated by background colors according to Behrens et al
[11].
Visualisation of SAI in ARB secondary structure editor
Theoretically as well as experimentally derived secondary
structure information of SSU rRNA [15-17] is used more
profoundly in sequence alignment refinement and probe
design and evaluation. The tertiary structure of the SSU
rRNA of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus which had
been elucidated with atomic resolution by X-ray
diffraction crystallography of ribosomal subunit [17]
allows evaluating the exactness of the secondary structure
model. The secondary structure of SSU rRNA has a crucial
role in evaluating the proposed probe candidates prior to
the actual experimentation. The ARB Secondary structure
editor (Figure 5) provides the user with more intuitive
graphical display of the secondary structure model of SSU
rRNA. The user can visualize the entire SSU rRNA
sequence of any organism in the respective database
which fits into the common consensus model. The localization of proposed oligonucleotide probe targets can be
visualized in customizable background colors.

Conclusion
The evaluation of proposed probe target position with
respect to higher-order rRNA structure is of more importance especially when probes are intended to be used for
in situ hybridizations [7-12]. Albeit there have been several software programs developed for the design of rRNA
targeted oligonucleotide probes [18,19], the criteria taken
to design the probes are generally restricted to certain
parameters such as size, nucleotide composition, specificity definition, and the general hybridisation behavior.
None of the software described [18,19] takes into account
the special requirements of rRNA targeted probes that are
destined for FISH applications which is, the structure
dependant probe accessibility of the ribosomal RNA. This
feature has been developed and implemented in ARB.
Using this tool, in silico probe design and evaluation can
be performed with respect to in situ probe accessibility
data. By identifying and excluding the probes targeting
sites with a poor accessibility the number of time consuming empirical tests can be reduced.
