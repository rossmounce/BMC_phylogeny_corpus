Abstract
Background: The arginine vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) modulates social cognition and behavior in a wide variety
of species. Variation in a repetitive microsatellite element in the 5' flanking region of the V1aR gene (AVPR1A) in rodents
has been associated with variation in brain V1aR expression and in social behavior. In humans, the 5' flanking region of
AVPR1A contains a tandem duplication of two ~350 bp, microsatellite-containing elements located approximately 3.5 kb
upstream of the transcription start site. The first block, referred to as DupA, contains a polymorphic (GT)25
microsatellite; the second block, DupB, has a complex (CT)4-(TT)-(CT)8-(GT)24 polymorphic motif, known as RS3.
Polymorphisms in RS3 have been associated with variation in sociobehavioral traits in humans, including autism spectrum
disorders. Thus, evolution of these regions may have contributed to variation in social behavior in primates. We
examined the structure of these regions in six ape, six monkey, and one prosimian species.
Results: Both tandem repeat blocks are present upstream of the AVPR1A coding region in five of the ape species we
investigated, while monkeys have only one copy of this region. As in humans, the microsatellites within DupA and DupB
are polymorphic in many primate species. Furthermore, both single (lacking DupB) and duplicated alleles (containing both
DupA and DupB) are present in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) populations with allele frequencies of 0.795 and 0.205 for
the single and duplicated alleles, respectively, based on the analysis of 47 wild-caught individuals. Finally, a phylogenetic
reconstruction suggests two alternate evolutionary histories for this locus.
Conclusion: There is no obvious relationship between the presence of the RS3 duplication and social organization in
primates. However, polymorphisms identified in some species may be useful in future genetic association studies. In
particular, the presence of both single and duplicated alleles in chimpanzees provides a unique opportunity to assess the
functional role of this duplication in contributing to variation in social behavior in primates. While our initial studies show
no signs of directional selection on this locus in chimps, pharmacological and genetic association studies support a
potential role for this region in influencing V1aR expression and social behavior.

Background
The neuropeptide, arginine vasopressin, acts centrally
upon its V1a receptor subtype (V1aR) to modulate social
behavior in a wide variety of species [1]. The remarkable
degree of inter- and intra-species variation in the distribution of V1aR in the brain has been associated with variation in social behavior [2-5]. Because differences in central
V1aR patterns of expression are likely due, at least in part,
to differences in the regulation of the V1aR gene
(AVPR1A), there has been considerable interest in identifying genetic candidate regions that may modulate V1aR
expression in the brain. Such candidate regions may ultimately provide a genetic substrate for generating diversity
in social behavior both across and within species.
Comparative studies in monogamous and non-monogamous vole species have suggested that variability in the 5'
flanking region of the AVPR1A gene contributes to both
variation in V1aR distribution patterns in the brain and in
sociobehavioral traits. In particular, the composition of a
microsatellite region located 626 base pairs (bp)
upstream of the AVPR1A transcription start site (TSS)
exhibits striking species differences in length and subtler
individual length variation within species [3,5,6]. This
inter- and intra-specific length variation is sufficient to
drive differences in gene expression in vitro in a cell-type
specific manner [3,7]. In vivo, individual variation in the
length of this region in prairie voles is associated with differences in central V1aR patterns and variation in maletypical social behaviors [2,3].
These initial experiments in voles generated interest in the
potential influence of variation in the human AVPR1A
promoter on social behavior and central gene expression.
A number of variable regions within the AVPR1A locus
have subsequently been identified and used in gene association studies, including a microsatellite region termed
RS3 located 3625 bp upstream of the human AVPR1A TSS
[8-17]. RS3 is a complex repetitive region, unrelated to the
vole microsatellite discussed above, composed of (CT)4TT-(CT)8-(GT)24 where the combined number of CT and
GT repeats varies from 16 to 50, yielding sixteen different
alleles in the human population [8].
Preliminary evidence suggests that variation in this repeat
element may influence AVPR1A gene expression in the
brain. In post-mortem human hippocampus samples,
longer RS3 repeat length has been associated with
increased AVPR1A mRNA levels [16]. Several genetic association studies are also consistent with the hypothesis that
variation in the RS3 element may contribute to variation
in human sociobehavioral traits [10,11,13,15,16]. While
only one study directly examines the link between RS3
variation and human social behavior [15], other studies,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/180

in whole or part, support an association between RS3 and
traits that influence social behavior, including personality. For example, length variation in this region has been
associated with altruistic behavior [16], and is also predictive of onset of first sexual intercourse in humans, a key
reproductive behavior [10]. Additionally, within a study
looking at the role of RS3 in creative dance performance,
personality surveys indicate that RS3 is associated with
individual scores on the Tellegen Absorption Scale and
the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire: Reward
Dependence, which measure spirituality/empathy and
social communication/need for social contact, respectively [13]. Beyond studies linking AVPR1A and various
aspects of normal human behavior, there are now three
independent studies linking this locus with autism, a disease hallmarked by deficits in social cognition [9,11,12].
Two of these studies have reported that specific alleles of
RS3 are overtransmitted in autistic probands [9,12], and
one of these studies suggests that variation in AVPR1A
polymorphisms is predictive of the sociocognitive aspects
of autism [11]. Taken together, these studies suggest that
the AVPR1A locus, and in particular the RS3 region, may
be important for determining variability in V1aR expression and social behavior.
Within humans, the RS3 repeat region is housed within a
larger, ~350 bp tandem duplicated region. The first of
these duplicated regions, DupA, spans -3730 to -4074 bp
and contains a GT25 microsatellite. The second block,
DupB, spans -3382 to -3729 bp and contains microsatellite RS3 (Figure 1). In humans, DupA and DupB have
~87% sequence identity. Previously, we reported that
while both humans and bonobos (Pan paniscus) carry
both DupA and DupB, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have
only DupA, leading to a 357 bp difference between the
chimpanzee and human AVPR1A upstream region [3].
This genetic difference in combination with behavioral
differences among chimps, humans and bonobos, led us
to further investigate the evolution of the DupA/B region
as a potential candidate for determining differences in primate social behavior.
In this paper, we amplified and compared the AVPR1A
RS3-containing 5' flanking region across a number of primate species, including a re-examination of the chimpanzee locus at a population level. We present two potential
evolutionary histories for this region and describe a previously unidentified insertion-deletion (indel) of the Dup B
region at this locus in chimpanzees. We also catalogue the
microsatellite diversity for GT25 in DupA and RS3 in DupB
in this region in five primate species and identify polymorphisms surrounding RS3 in two species of macaques.
Finally, we perform initial studies to look for signatures of
positive selection at this locus in chimpanzees.

and DupB are located in tandem with no intervening
sequence between the two copies, and each of these duplicated regions is approximately 300 nucleotides, excluding
the 30–80 variable nucleotide microsatellite region. The
galago, the only prosimian species examined here, has a
conserved region that corresponds with a portion of the
DupA/B region but the sequences surrounding this area
are highly diverged from the other primate species that we
investigated, indicating that either this region is not fully
represented prior to Simiiforms or we failed to identify a
truly orthologous sequence. Additional investigation is
needed to resolve the history of this region prior to Simiiformes.

Primate AVPR1A evolution
Sequence analysis
We determined the sequence surrounding the RS3
AVPR1A upstream region in 13 primate species, which
included 1 Strepsirrhini (norther greater galago [Otolemur
garnettii, Genbank: EU760974), 2 Platyrrhini (squirrel monkey [Saimiri sciureus, Genbank: EU760979] and golden lion
tamarin [Leontopithecus rosalia, Genbank: EU7609780]), 4
Cercopithecoidea (sooty mangabey [Cercocebus atys, Genbank: EU760976], rhesus macaque [Macaca mulatta, GenBank:
NW_001096629.1], cynomologus [Macaca
fascicularis, Genbank: EU760982], and bonnet macaque
[Macaca radiata, Genbank: EU760972]) and 6 Hominoidea (gibbon [Hylobates lar, Genbank: EU760981], orangutan [Pongo pygmaeus, Genbank: EU760977], gorilla [Gorilla
gorilla, Genbank: EU760975], chimpanzee [Pan troglodytes,
Genbank: EU780069 and EU78070], bonobo [Pan paniscus, Genbank: EU760973] and human [Homo sapiens, Genbank: NW_001838060]) species. We found that great apes
contain a duplication of the microsatellite-containing
region, while all six of the monkey species of both New
and Old World origin have only DupB (see phylogenetic
analysis for classification of this region; Figure 1). DupA

In apes, the microsatellite contained within the duplicated region differs substantially between the two copies.
The upstream DupA block houses a GT-only simple repeat
while RS3 in all species that have DupB consists of a complex CT repeat immediately upstream of the GT repeat
(Table 1). The single microsatellite in monkeys has both
the CT and GT repeats, more similar to RS3 rather than to
GT25. This is consistent with the hypothesis that DupB in
apes is an exact ortholog of the single copy in monkeys
with DupA being a more distant paralog. This hypothesis
is also supported by sequence alignment, which consistently places the single repeat-containing block in monkeys with DupB in the apes.
Phylogenetic analysis
To test the hypothesis suggested by the sequence analysis
that the monkey repeat-containing block is more closely
related to the DupB region in apes, we reconstructed the
phylogeny of the DupA/B region. To achieve this, we used
a multiple alignment of all copies of the duplicated blocks
excluding both of the microsatellite regions. With the
exception of the orangutan, all apes showed separate
clades for DupA and DupB, providing strong support for
an orthologous relationship between the single monkey
region and the DupB copy of this region in apes (Figure
2). The orangutan DupB region is more similar to its own
DupA region than the DupB region of other apes. This
observation, coupled with the phylogenetic placement of
orangutan DupA and DupB regions, strongly supports a
gene conversion event between the two copies, which was
observed in all alleles in the five individuals we investigated. Gene conversion is thought to occur as a result of
misalignment of the Holliday complex during recombination and results in the apparent replacement of one
genetic region with another. Within orangutans, gene conversion events appear to have converted portions of DupB
to DupA at some point in the past. Interestingly, the conversion events do not appear to include the microsatellites
of the duplicated regions in orangutans, with the orangutan DupA region containing a GT repeat and the DupB
region containing both the CT and GT repeats (Table 1),

implying more than one short conversion event spanning
the duplicated region in the orangutan.
There are two possible evolutionary explanations for the
phylogenetic clustering of the ape DupB region with the
single copy of this region found in monkey species (Figure
2). Either there has been an increase in the rate of evolution of the DupA region in apes relative to DupB, or multiple losses of the DupA region in the common ancestors
of the monkeys examined in this study. The former explanation is more parsimonious, since the latter hypothesis
requires at least two independent losses of the DupA
region, in the common ancestors of both Old and New
World monkeys. Although we sequenced this region in
the prosimian species, the northern greater galago, the
region was too far diverged to resolve these two alternative
hypotheses. Therefore, more sequence data from other
outgroup species are needed to resolve the evolutionary
history of this region with a higher degree of confidence.
Microsatellite variation
Both the GT25 and RS3 microsatellites were variable across
individual alleles in all of the primate species we investigated (5 rhesus macaques, 4 bonnet macaques, 5 orangutans, 9 gorillas, and 25 wild born chimps; Table 1).
Because chimpanzees have two alleles that differ for the
presence of DupB (see below for additional information),
we performed separate analyses of these sequences for
long and short alleles (genotypes, n = 2 long/long, 10
long/short, and 13 short/short individuals). Both
macaque species have only the DupB region and show
similar levels of RS3 microsatellite variability at this locus
with slightly longer repeats occurring more commonly in
rhesus. Among great apes similar levels of variability were
seen for both DupA and DupB microsatellites. We did not
find a marked difference in the range of length variability
in the species we investigated and that previously reported
for humans [10]. However, because our sample size was
relatively small, it is possible that we missed low frequency alleles and a more thorough analysis should be
undertaken if these microsatellites are used in association
studies in the future.

Macaque sequence diversity
Because both rhesus and, to a lesser extent, bonnet
macaques are used as animal models in many areas of
research, including behavior, we undertook a study to catalogue the sequence diversity surrounding RS3. An assessment of the variability in this region provides a tool for
future genetic association studies of this locus in these
organisms. We sequenced ~2 kb of sequence surrounding
RS3 in both rhesus and bonnet macaques and identified a
number of polymorphisms (Figure 3, Table 2 and 3).
Although these animals were captive born, every effort
was made to obtain a diverse sample, and none of the
individuals we investigated shared a first degree relative.
Among 5 rhesus macaques of Indian origin, we identified
14 SNPs, and 5 indels. In contrast, in the same region in 4
bonnet macaques, we identified only 6 SNPs and 1 indel.
Along with variation in RS3, these polymorphisms can be
used in future genetic association studies. However, as a
note of caution, rhesus macaques have a 5 bp indel 76 bp
upstream of RS3 and care should be taken when designing
potential primers for amplification of RS3 so that this
indel does not influence the interpretation of microsatellite length.
Chimpanzee sequence diversity
Inconsistent data for the DupA/B region obtained from
the current version of the chimp genome (GenBank:
NW_001223153) prompted us to obtain an independent
sequence for this region. We found that chimpanzees are
polymorphic for the presence of the DupB region, resulting in two alleles that vary by ~350 bp. In order to determine whether this polymorphism, originally identified in
captive chimps, was observed in wild chimp populations,
we genotyped 43 wild-born chimpanzees of primarily
West African origin (35 from M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center, 8 from Yerkes National Primate Center). Within
this sample the frequency of the short allele (DupA only)
is 0.795 and the long allele (DupA and B) is 0.205. The
genotype frequencies are shown in Figure 4 and appear to
be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (χ2 = 0.567, df = 2, p =
0.753).

analyze neutrality at this region.

are indicated by "A" or "B," respectively, following the species name. With the exception of the orangutan (indicated by

DupB (indicated by circles). This provides strong support for
an orthologous relationship between DupB and the monkey
microsatellite-containing region. Clustered phylogenetic
placement of the orangutan duplicated regions is consistent
with a gene conversion event occurring between the two
copies.
Tests of neutrality at the chimp AVPR1A locus
As the short and long alleles are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, there is not evidence for directional selection for
a particular allele. However, there may be positive selection for a particular polymorphism or haplotype within or
linked to the locus. To investigate non-neutral evolution
at this locus in wild chimpanzees we examined patterns of
polymorphisms within the surrounding 4 kp region,
including 1520 bp upstream and 2395 bp downstream of
DupA/B. We focused on the areas surrounding the duplicated blocks rather than the duplicated region itself
because of technical difficulties associated with sequencing a microsatellite-containing duplication. Evidence of
hitch-hiking, as indicated by the spreading of polymorphism(s) within a population due to their linkage with a
beneficial mutation, should be detectable within the surrounding regions we investigated. We sequenced alleles
from 28 randomly selected wild-born chimps of primarily
West African origin. There were 17 long and 39 short alle-

Levels of nucleotide diversity are 0.073% for π and
0.089% for θ [18]. These values are almost identical to
previously reported average multilocus levels of nucleotide diversity in Western chimpanzees [19]. Diversity
was also examined within the long and short alleles. In
the long allele, π is 0.054% and 0.048% in the short allele.
This reduction in diversity within allele classes compared
to the pooled population occurs because all polymorphisms were exclusively linked to either the short or the
long alleles, with no SNPs shared between the two haplotypes. Using the four gamete test [20] to identify regions
of recombination within the locus revealed at least two
crossover events. One of these crossover events is apparent
within the short alleles and the other within the long alleles.
At the AVPR1A locus, Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H did
not deviate from neutral expectations [21,22]. Tajima's D
is -0.86 (95% CI -1.52 to 1.83) and Fay and Wu's H is 1.63 (95% CI -3.5 to 1.46). Similar to these results, Fischer
et al. [19]report an average multilocus Tajima's D of -0.23
in Western chimpanzees. There is a negative skew in Fay
and Wu's H, which may suggest an excess of high-frequency-derived polymorphisms, however, this result is
not statistically significant. Therefore, our analysis provides no evidence for non-neutral selection within this
region in chimpanzee.

Discussion
Although our data support two possible scenarios for the
evolution of the AVPR1A DupA and DupB regions in primates, both of these scenarios require complex histories
involving duplication, deletion, and gene conversion
events (Fig 1). Similar to humans, the GT25 and RS3 mic-

Polymorphisms were identified in the ~2 kb surrounding RS3 in 5
rhesus macaques. Sequence location was derived from GenBank:
NW_001096629.1.

rosatellites in DupA and DupB, respectively, are polymorphic in multiple primate species (Table 1). Chimpanzees
exhibit a polymorphic loss of DupB, and while our initial
studies did not reveal evidence of directional selection at
this locus in chimps, further studies are needed to better
understand the contribution of this region to brain V1aR
expression and sociobehavioral traits (Fig 3).
While we did not undertake a rigorous sociobehavioral
classification of the species we investigated, a brief assessment of the known social behavior of these species does
not support a relationship between duplication within the
DupA/B region and social organization or specific social
traits, such as the ability to form pair bonds. For instance,
humans and gibbons both form selective social bonds,
known as pair bonds, but humans have both DupA and
DupB while gibbons have only DupA (reviewed in
[23,24]). Within macaques, where social organization has
been well categorized, DupA/B architecture does not seem
to co-vary with various aspects of social behavior. Using a
scale developed by Thierry [25], rhesus and bonnet
macaques fall into different grades of social organization
and vary in nearly all of the 22 social traits assessed. However both of these species, like all the monkeys we investigated, have only the DupB region of the AVPR1A gene.
However, this initial assessment is limited and work is
needed to thoroughly characterize the relationship
between the DupA/B region and sociobehavioral traits
both across and within species. In particular, a common

scale for assessing primate social organization, such as
that already in use for macaques would greatly enhance
cross-species comparisons.
Similar to our findings in primates, a recent study investigating the evolution of the vole avpr1a upstream repeat
region in 21 species revealed that the presence or absence
of this DNA element was not sufficient to predict social
organization [26]. However, given the evidence suggesting that variation in this region is associated with gene
expression and behavior in humans, it is possible that various duplication and deletion events and their effects on
the flanking regions have influenced sociobehavioral
traits during primate evolution.
Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that evolutionary changes within the DupA/B region may have
affected primate social behaviors via alteration of brain
V1aR expression. For example, differences in similar
repetitive regions within the avpr1a upstream region in
voles influences in vitro gene expression and has been tied
to in vivo variation in brain V1aR expression and in social
cognition and behavior [3,7]. Taken together, phylogenetic data, along with molecular and gene association
studies, suggest that while evolution may have derived
multiple mechanisms for determining rodent social structure, variation in the avpr1a promoter is one means for
generating diversity in social behaviors [27].
Human studies also provide provisional evidence in support of the hypothesis that variation in the RS3 region
may mediate differences in brain V1aR expression and
social cognition and behavior. V1aR is highly expressed
within the human lateral septum, a brain region associated with social behavior in many species [28]. However,
the distribution of V1aR differs strikingly between

examining AVPR1A have been conducted, investigating
two to four repeat polymorphisms within the AVPR1A 5'
flanking region and intron, one of which is RS3 [described
in 8]. While gene association studies do not provide direct
functional evidence, the association of RS3 with sociobehavioral traits, personality aspects, or autism in several
studies suggests that RS3 is a promising genetic candidate
region for influencing social cognition and behavior [913,15,16]. Additionally, an association between RS3
length and AVPR1A mRNA levels in the human hippocampus further supports a role for RS3 in potentially influencing gene regulation [16]. However, additional
functional studies are needed to understand the specific
influence of the DupA/B region on V1aR expression and
social behavior in humans as well as other primate species.
In addition to investigating the evolutionary history for
this locus, we also sought to characterize the diversity of
the microsatellites in DupA (GT25) and DupB (RS3)
within several species. Like in humans, these microsatellites have multiple length variants within rhesus and bonnet macaques, chimps, orangutans, and gorillas. Because
of advances in non-invasive hair and fecal DNA collection, these polymorphisms can be genotyped in wild individuals. This is of particular importance because many
great ape species are endangered [30,31], and we may be
able to gain valuable insights into optimal conservation
strategies for these organisms.

We also characterized 2 kb of sequence surrounding RS3
in both rhesus and bonnet macaque to identify the variability within these regions. Both of these organisms are
commonly used in research and rhesus macaques have
become a primary primate model for basic and applied
biomedical research [32]. Interestingly, we found considerably more variation present in the rhesus than the bonnet macaque for this region. This is consistent with the
findings of a study that looked at a polymorphism in the
serotonin transporter upstream region, another gene that
has been linked with complex behaviors. The authors of
that study identified more variability in rhesus compared
to other macaque species [33]. While the interpretation of
this observation is difficult, our initial studies suggest that
sufficient variability may exist at this locus in captive
research populations to carry out high resolution association studies.
Because non-coding variation is known to mediate individual differences in gene expression and social behavior
in prairie voles, the striking indel polymorphism we identified in chimpanzees is particularly interesting. Loss of
the DupB region in this species resulted in a two alleles
that differ by approximately 350 bp. This polymorphism
occurs naturally in the African chimp population, where
the short allele is approximately four times as prevalent as
the long allele. Given that the ancestral state is the duplicated allele, we investigated the potential for selection to
have acted upon this locus.
Nucleotide diversity for this region was similar to that
reported previously for neutrally evolving regions in West
African chimpanzees [19], and tests of directional selection were not significant. While this data initially suggests
that the chimpanzee's AVPR1A promoter region is not
under selection, there may be alternative explanations for
our findings. The presence of population structure and
metapopulation dynamics may bias the estimates of
Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H toward being more negative [22,34,35]. Consistent with this possibility, patterns

of polymorphisms show that all 16 SNPs are polymorphic
within either the short or long alleles but not in both. This
observation would be expected if gene flow was occurring
between chimpanzee populations with different frequencies of long and short alleles. Evidence of recombination
within but not between long and short alleles supports
this hypothesis, and it is known that western and central
chimp populations have low levels of population structure when compared to each other [FST 0.29; 19]. Alternatively, lack of recombination between long and short
alleles may also reflect a linked, polymorphic inversion of
this region in chimpanzees. Future multilocus sequencing
would reveal if the observed polymorphism patterns are
resulting from gene flow or inverted alleles. Alternatively,
the short allele may be in the process of being driven to
high frequency or fixation. If chimps lost DupB very
recently then the test for selection using polymorphism
frequencies may not detect evidence of selection, especially if the region is in an area of low recombination.
Finally, however, these results should be approached with
caution. The historical records do not pinpoint the exact
origin of these chimps. The few complete records that
exist indicate that the majority of these chimps came from
West Africa, as is common for many chimps in captivity in
the United States (pers. comm. Susan Lambeth, University
of Texas M.D Anderson Cancer Center at Bastrop). Use of
multiple samples of known origins would greatly help in
elucidating the evolution of this locus in multiple wild
chimpanzee populations. In addition, as the population

of chimpanzees available for research in the US disappears due to a moratorium on chimp breeding [36],
genetic studies enabled by our preliminary work will provide a means for addressing physiological and behavioral
hypotheses in wild populations. Ultimately, though, to
better fully assess the functional consequences of this polymorphism, transcriptional assays and behavioural association studies are needed.
AVPR1A remains an exciting candidate gene for mediating
differences in the social behavior of many species and
potentially contributing to diseases characterized by deficits in social cognition [1,37]. Specifically, RS3 and the
surrounding duplicated region provide an opportunity to
discover how variation in the primate AVPR1A upstream
region may mediate differences in brain V1aR expression
and social behavior.

Conclusion
We report the sequence and evolutionary history of the
microsatellite-containing DupA/B region in the 5' flanking region of the AVPR1A gene, which may have relevance
for understanding the role of variation in brain AVPR1A
expression as it relates to social cognition and behavior.
This region has undergone duplication, deletion, and
gene conversion events including polymorphic deletion
of DupB in chimpanzees (Fig 1). Similar to humans, the
microsatellites in this region are highly variable within
multiple species (Table 1). While we did not find significant relationships between the presence or absence of this
region and social organization or mating strategy, it is
possible that the duplication and deletion of this region,
or variation in length of the microsatellites within this
region have influenced sociobehavioral traits during primate evolution. Our identification of polymorphisms in
the AVPR1A upstream region in macaques and particularly the deletion of DupB in chimps provides an excellent
opportunity for exploring the relationship between variation in this region and social cognition and behavior (Figures 3, 4, 5, Tables 2, 3, 4).

purified using Gentra PUREGENE DNA purification kits
(Minneapolis, MN).
For chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, rhesus
macaque, bonnet macaque, cynomologus, and sooty
mangabey, we amplified a ~2kb region that included the
human DupA/B element using the Epicentre Failsafe PCR
System in premix E with forward primer 5'-GAGGATCACCTGAGCCTG and a reverse primer of 5'-GGCATAGTGCATGATAGTCC with an annealing temperature of 57°C
for 30 cycles: 95°C, 5 min; 30×(95°C, 30 sec; 57°C, 30
sec; 72°C, 3.5 min); 72°C, 10 min; 4°C, hold. Because
these primers were unable to amplify this region in squirrel monkey, tamarin, gibbon, or galago, we amplified
these species with alternative primer sets. For squirrel
monkeys, we used Epicentre Failsafe PCR System in
premix B with forward primer 5'-ATCGATCTAGATATGCACTCATACATGTAAGC and a reverse primer of 5'GAAGAGCTGAATTTGAGCAG with an annealing temperature of 58°C for 40 cycles: 95°C, 5 min; 40×(95°C, 30
sec; 58°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 1 min); 72°C, 10 min; 4°C, hold.
For golden lion tamarin, we used Epicentre Failsafe PCR
System in premix A supplemented with 1% DMSO with
forward primer 5'-TTGTTGAGCATGGTAGCCTCT and a
reverse primer of 5'-GAAGAGCTGCCTTTGAGCAG with
an annealing temperature of 59°C for 40 cycles: 95°C, 5
min; 30×(95°C, 30 sec; 59°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 30 sec);
72°C, 10 min; 4°C, hold. For gibbon, we used the Epicentre Failsafe PCR System in premix E with forward primer
5'-ACCCTTCAAACAATGCAACC and a reverse primer of
5'-ATCATGCTTCCAAATACTGGC with an annealing temperature of 57°C for 30 cycles: 95°C, 5 min; 30×(95°C,
30 sec; 57°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 3.5 min); 72°C, 10 min; 4°C,
hold. Although our region of interest did not appear to be

present in the initial ENSEMBL 1.5× coverage release of
the northern greater galago genome, we were able to identify regions with high homology to the human sequence
on either side of the RS3 region. After generating primers
within these regions, we were able to amplify ~4 kb of the
galago AVPR1A upstream region using a long-range step
down PCR with Epicentre Failsafe premix K with forward
primer 5'-GCTGTGCATAGATACGCTGG and reverse
primer 5'-CCATGGAATCGAAGAACATTTGC with an
annealing temperature of 56°C, 55°C, 54°C for ten cycles
each: 95°C, 5 min; 10×(95°C, 30 sec; 56°C, 30 sec; 72°C,
3.5 min); 10×(95°C, 30 sec; 55°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 3.5
min); 10×(95°C, 30 sec; 54°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 3.5 min);
72°C, 10 min; 4°C, hold.
In cases where multiple bands were present, all products
were gel extracted separately and cloned into pCR 4TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to
manufacturer's instructions. DNA from at least two positive colonies per gel-extracted product were purified using
Qiaprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the
region of interest was sequenced by Lark Technologies
(Houston, TX) or MacrogenUSA (Rockville, MD).
Sequences homologous to the human DupA/B region
were verified, aligned, and edited manually as needed
using VectorNTi (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were aligned with the muscle program [38] and
then the alignment was manually checked in the MEGA3
browser [39] for accuracy. The phylogeny was reconstructed using MrBayes [40] with 1 million iterations
(mcmc ngen = 1,000,000 in MrBayes) with the General
Time Reversible model (Figure 2).

Microsatellite variation
In order to asses potential microsatellite variation, we
sequenced both the GT25 repeat in DupA and the RS3
complex (CT)4TT(CT)8(GT)24 repeat in DupB where
applicable in rhesus macaques (n = 5), bonnet macaques
(n = 4), orangutans (n = 5), gorillas (n = 9), and wild born
chimpanzees (n = 25). The DupA/B region was amplified
and cloned using the methods described above. Two
clones per individual were sequenced to determine microsatellite variation for these five species. For rhesus and
bonnet macaques, which have only DupB and not DupA,
we sequenced RS3 with primer 5'-AACTTAACCACAAGGCTGAGC. For orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees,
we sequenced the GT25 repeat of DupA with primer 5'GCATGGTAGCCTCTCTTTAAT and RS3 within DupB
with 5'-CATACACATGGAAAGCACCTAA. Because chimpanzees are polymorphic for DupB, only 8 of the 31 individuals sequenced had RS3. While these analyses are not
meant to be exhaustive, they are sufficient to verify the
potential for using these microsatellites in future genetic
association studies in various primates.
Macaque sequence diversity
Using the previously described PCR conditions, we amplified 1983 bp surrounding the DupB region of rhesus (n =
5) and bonnet macaques (n = 4). This region corresponds
to basepairs 2068920 to 2066938 in Genbank:
NW_001096629.1 (rhesus macaque). PCR products were
purified and cloned. Both purified PCR products and two
clones per individual were sequenced with primers 5'GAGGATCACCTGAGCCTG, 5'-GGCATAGTGCATGATAGTCC, 5'-TGAGTAGCTGCCTTTGAGC and 5'-CATGCTTGACTTGCAGCAC. SNPs and potential INDELs
were identified visually from chromatograms of the
sequenced PCR products using VectorNTi. Each potential
SNP and insertion/deletion was verified and resolved
using the sequences from the cloned PCR product.
Determination of allele frequency in wild chimpanzees
We genotyped 47 wild-caught chimps of primarily West
African origin from Yerkes Primate Research Center (n =
8) and University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
(n = 35) to determine the approximate distribution of
long and short alleles in the natural chimp population.
The DupA/B region was amplified from chimp genomic
DNA derived from blood or buccal samples (see above for
purification methods) using Epicentre premix I with forward primer 5'-GCATGGTAGCCTCTCTTTAAT and a
reverse primer of 5'-CATACACATGGAAAGCACCTAA
with an annealing temperature of 57°C for 30 cycles:
95°C, 5 min; 30×(95°C, 30 sec; 57°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 3
min); 72°C, 10 min; 4°C, hold). PCR products were
resolved on a 1.8% agarose gel and genotype was determined visually (see Figure 3). These primers are located
just outside the chimp DupA/B region and correspond

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/180

with chimp/human nucleotide differences in order to
decrease potential cross-species PCR contamination.
Analysis of chimpanzee alleles for potential non-neutral
evolution
Amplification and polymorphism identification
Upon discovery of both duplicated and non-duplicated
alleles in natural chimpanzees, we undertook an experiment to identify evidence of non-neutral selection at this
locus. We amplified a 4.2 kb region surrounding DupA/B
ranging from -5235 bp to -973 bp (Figure 4) in 28 wild
born chimps (genotypes = 3 long/long, 11 long/short, 14
short/short). The PCR reaction was carried out in Epicenter Failsafe PCR premix E, with forward primer 5'-GTTGTGCATACATATCCTGG and a reverse primer of 5'CAGGTAATCAAAGAACATTTCC using a touch-down
technique with the following conditions: 95°C, 5 min;
10×(95°C, 30 sec; 54.6°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 6 min);
10×(95°C, 30 sec; 53.6°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 6 min);
10×(95°C, 30 sec; 52.6°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 6 min); 72°C, 10
min; 4°C, hold). The PCR product was gel purified and
the region surrounding the duplication but not the duplication itself was sequenced in both forward and reverse
directions using primers A-N as outlined in Table 5. SNPs
and potential INDELs were identified visually from chromatograms in VectorNTi. Each potential SNP and insertion/deletion was verified with at least two independent
sequencing primers. The same PCR products were cloned
into PCR-TOPO4 vectors according to manufacturer's
instructions and multiple clones from each individual
were sequenced with primers L-O of Table 5 in order to
reconstruct individual alleles.
Tests of neutrality
All silent sites were used excluding insertions and deletions. Levels of nucleotide variability were calculated
using both Watterson's estimator, θ, [18] based on the
number of segregating sites in the sample, and π, the average pairwise diversity per nucleotide [41].

To test the fit to the standard neutral model, two summaries of the distribution of polymorphism frequencies were
used. Tajima's D[22] is a measure of the standardized difference between π and θ. Fay and Wu's H also measures
the difference between π and θ, but weighs derived variants by the square of their frequencies [21]. The orthologous Homo sapiens sequence was used as an outgroup for
Fay and Wu's H. Under the standard neutral model, both
test statistics are expected to give values close to zero. The
values of the observed Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H
were compared to neutral coalescent simulations with
recombination using the program, ms[42]. 104 neutral
simulations were performed using a point estimate of θ
based on the observed data. A point estimate of 5.0 × 10-

for the recombination rate per base pair, ρ, was chosen
from previous Western chimpanzee estimate [43].
