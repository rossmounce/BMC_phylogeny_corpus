Introduction
HTLV-1 is classified in seven subtypes (a-g) most of
them restricted to specific regions (b-e), while the Cosmopolitan subtype (a) is worldwide distributed. Cosmopolitan subtype has experimented a degree of molecular
diversity giving rise to five subgroups: Transcontinental
(A), Japanese (B), West African (C), North African (D)
and Black Peruvian (E).
Objective
to confirm the classification of four HTLV-1 highly
divergent strains as a new subgroup within the Cosmopolitan subtype.
Materials and methods
LTR sequences from 65 HTLV-1 positive Buenos Aires
residents were retrospectively studied. Phylogeny of LTR
region was studied by three different methods (ML, MP
and NJ). A similitude index (SI) was estimated as the
mean number of nucleotide substitutions from each
subgroup (intra-subgroup) or between sequences from a
given subgroup against all from other subgroups (intersubgroup) (script described in the R Statistical Package
Language http://www.R-project.org).
Results
The three phylogenetic methods were consistent, showing a well supported monophyletic clade that included
two Peruvian sequences clustering with two references
(Bl3 from Peru and Br4 from Brazil) previously
described as divergent, branching off all known subgroups (82% bootstrap, ML). The similitude analysis
showed a SI intra-subgroup similar to those obtained

for A-D subgroups and a SI inter-subgroup similar to
subgroups A and D. Following nomenclature, it was
named subgroup F.

Conclusions
This study confirms the existence of a highly divergent
monophyletic clade within the Cosmopolitan subtype
composed of sequences from Peruvian and Brazilian
individuals and suggest that more studies should be performed in this South-American area where the last subgroups (E and F) has been detected.
