Abstract
Background: Female endoparasitic ichneumonid wasps inject virus-like particles into their
caterpillar hosts to suppress immunity. These particles are classified as ichnovirus virions and
resemble ascovirus virions, which are also transmitted by parasitic wasps and attack caterpillars.
Ascoviruses replicate DNA and produce virions. Polydnavirus DNA consists of wasp DNA
replicated by the wasp from its genome, which also directs particle synthesis. Structural similarities
between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that
ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses, although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking.
Results: Here we show that a family of unique pox-D5 NTPase proteins in the Glypta fumiferanae
ichnovirus are related to three Diadromus pulchellus ascovirus proteins encoded by ORFs 90, 91 and
93. A new alignment technique also shows that two proteins from a related ichnovirus are
orthologs of other ascovirus virion proteins.
Conclusion: Our results provide molecular evidence supporting the origin of ichnoviruses from
ascoviruses by lateral transfer of ascoviral genes into ichneumonid wasp genomes, perhaps the first
example of symbiogenesis between large DNA viruses and eukaryotic organisms. We also discuss
the limits of this evidence through complementary studies, which revealed that passive lateral
transfer of viral genes among polydnaviral, bacterial, and wasp genomes may have occurred
repeatedly through an intimate coupling of both recombination and replication of viral genomes
during evolution. The impact of passive lateral transfers on evolutionary relationships between
polydnaviruses and viruses with large double-stranded genomes is considered in the context of the
theory of symbiogenesis.

Background
Parasitic wasps belonging to the families Ichneumonidae
and Braconidae are among the most successful higher

eukaryotic organisms. These two large families contain
more than 37,000 known species, and estimates of the
total number of species are as high as 100,000 [1].

Approximately two-thirds of these wasps are endoparasites, meaning that the larval stages develop within the
body cavity of their hosts, typically other insects. Among
the most successful of these endoparasitic wasps are those
that use lepidopteran larvae as hosts. Owing to the economic importance of these insects and the utility of their
wasp parasites as biological control agents, the ability of
these parasites to develop within lepidopteran hosts without triggering an intense immune response has been the
subject of numerous studies over the past forty years.
Early studies of the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia
kuhniella, parasitized by the ichnemonid, Venturia canescens, showed that eggs of this species are coated with particles that resemble virions [2-4] and contain surface
proteins that mimic host proteins, thus keeping the eggs
and larvae from being recognized as foreign material by
their host. These particles lack DNA, and thus are not considered virions [5]. With respect to both species number
and mechanisms that lead to successful parasitism,
endoparasitic wasps are known to inject secretions at oviposition, but only a few lineages use viruses or virus-like
particles (VLPs) to evade or to suppress host defences. In
the family Ichneumonidae, for example, four types of host
defence suppression mediated by the injection of fluids or
suspensions are known that lead to successful parasitism.
1) Fluid injected with eggs bypasses host defences without
the aid of viruses or VLPs [6].
2) Wasps inject a virus that replicates in both the wasp and
lepidopteran host. One example is the wasp Diadromus
pulchellus, which injects an ascovirus, DpAV4 [7] into host
pupae to circumvent host defence response.
3) The wasp injects VLPs capable of molecular mimicry
and/or direct defence suppression.
4) The wasp injects polydnavirus particles that contain
genes coding for proteins that interfere with host defence
responses.
The last mechanism is by far the best-studied type of direct
immune suppression by ichneumonid wasps, and occurs
in many species belonging to genera Campoletis, Hyposoter
and Tranosema (Ichneumonidae, Campopleginae), and
Glypta (Ichneumonidae, Banchinae) [8]. In these cases,
female wasps inject eggs along with ichnovirus particles
into their hosts. Similarly, in certain lineages of endoparasitic braconid wasps, other types of immunosuppressive
particles containing DNA occur in the fluid injected along
with eggs [[9]; for a review, [10]]. Once in the host, ichneumonid and brachonid particles enter host nuclei and
their DNA is transcribed, producing proteins that selectively suppress various steps in the host defence response.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/253

As a result of this unusual biology, these particles were
described as symbiotic viruses belonging to new viral family, Polydnaviridae [10-12]
Since the 1970's, it was assumed that the DNA in the
polydnavirus particles, as with all other viruses, encoded
typical enzymes and proteins for viral replication and virion assembly and structure. However, several recent
genomic studies have shown that only a small number of
the genes vectored into lepidopteran hosts, less than 2%,
have homologs in other viruses. Most viral DNA is noncoding, except that which codes for wasp proteins
involved in suppression of immune pathways, such as
phenoloxidase activation and the toll pathways [8,13,14].
Even before these genomic studies, it was suggested that
these particles were more similar to organelles than
viruses [15]. The similarities between particle structure
and virions of known types of complex DNA insect viruses
are striking, and suggest these immunosuppressive particles originated by symbiogenesis between viruses and
endoparasitic wasps, the same evolutionary process by
which mitochondria and plastids originated from symbiotic bacteria [16]. For example, most braconid wasps produce enveloped bacilliform particles classified as
bracoviruses, and these resemble baculovirus and nudivirus virions [10,15]. Similarly, ichneumonid wasps produce enveloped spindle-shaped particles classified as
ichnoviruses that resemble virions of ascoviruses, viruses
lethal to lepidopterans, which, interestingly, are vectored
by endoparasitic wasps [15]. It must also be noted that
ichnoviruses resemble other true virus particles that are
structurally very similar to virions of ascoviruses, but
which remain unclassified because the lack of information about their genomes [17-21]. However, ascoviruses
and ichnoviruses display very different genome properties; similar genomic differences occur between bracoviruses and baculoviruses or nudiviruses, suggesting that
convergent evolution led to the origin the different polydnavirus types from at least two different types of viruses.
In ascoviruses, the genome consists of a single circular
DNA molecule ranging from 119- to 180-kpb in size [7].
Phylogenetic analyses of several viral genes have revealed
that ascoviruses are closely related to iridoviruses [22],
and likely evolved from them. In contrast, the genome of
ichnoviruses is composed of multiple circular DNA molecules (25 to 105) representing a total size of 250 to 300kbp, all of which are replicated from the wasp chromosomes. The ichnovirus proviral genome is specifically
excised and amplified in several segments in the female
calyx cells, the only wasp tissue in which ichnovirus virogenesis occurs. After assembly, these particles are secreted
into the female genital tract. Once injected into the host,
the ichnovirus genome does not replicate, and does not
lead to the production of a new virus generation. The third

characteristic of ichnoviruses is that most of the genes
borne by the particles are not related to viral genes.
Among the 7 annotated ichnovirus gene families, there
are four (rep, PRRP, N, and TrV) for which no homology
with known eukaryotic (or prokaryotic) proteins has been
detected and for which no function has been proposed.
Among the remaining three (cys, ank and inx), cys-motif
proteins have no clear homologs among eukaryotic (or
prokaryotic) proteins, although the "cysteine knot" that
they form is a folding domain found in many proteins,
but not one that is necessarily related to eukaryotic host
immune systems [10,14]. However, some protein
domains and their putative functions suggest that they
might be related to regulatory components of eukaryotic
host defence systems that are not sufficiently elucidated.
Although the resemblance of the polydnavirus virions to
those of conventional insect viruses suggests that the
former evolved from the latter, to date no molecular evidence supports this hypothesis. In the case of ascoviruses
and ichnoviruses, well-conserved genes found among the
three ascoviruses sequenced so far (SfAV1a [23], TnAV2c
[24], and HvAV3e [25]) are not found in ichnovirus
genomes. As noted above, the principal reason for this is
that the genomes of the latter viruses appear to contain
mainly wasp genes, not viral genes. This highlights the
need for new and alternative types of sequence data
obtained from pertinent biological systems. In this regard,
DpAV4 has features that could provide important
insights. Indeed, it is the only ascovirus known to replicate in both its wasp and caterpillar hosts. It is transmitted
vertically from wasp to caterpillars to suppress the defence
response of the latter host, thereby enabling parasite
development [26,27]. Moreover, in males and females of
D. pulchellus, the DpAV4 genome resides in the nuclei of
all hosts cells, providing a possible example of what may
have been an intermediate stage in the symbiogenesis that
led to the evolutionary origin of ichnoviruses.
We recently sequenced the DpAV4 genome, and a combination of our analysis of this genome and recent data
from new types of ichnoviruses, as well as new software
programs that elucidate protein relationships based on
structural analysis, have enabled us to detect phylogenetic
relationships between proteins encoded by open reading
frames of DpAV4 and the Glypta fumiferanae (GfIV) and
Campolitis sonorensis (CsIV) ichnoviruses. In support of the
symbiogenesis hypothesis for the origin of ichnoviruses,
data and analyses suggest two independent symbiogenic
events, in agreement with what was previously proposed
[28]. The first led to the ichnoviruses in Banchinae lineage. This hypothesis is based on the occurrence of a gene
cluster present in GfIV and DpAV4. The second symbiogenic event led to ichnoviruses in the Campopleginae
wasp lineage. This hypothesis is based on relationships of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/253

the major capsid proteins among CsIV, ascoviruses and
iridoviruses. Extending our investigations to proteins
encoded by open reading frames of certain ascoviruses
and bracoviruses, hosts and bacteria, in the light of recent
analyses about the involvement of the replication
machinery of virus groups related to ascoviruses in lateral
gene transfer [29], we discuss the robustness and the limits of the molecular evidence supporting an ascovirus origin for ichnovirus lineages.

Results and discussion
DpAV4 and ichnovirus related proteins
The DpAV4 genome sequenced by Genoscope (France) is
119,334-bp in length. Its organization, gene content and
evolutionary characteristics will be detailed in a separate
publication (manuscript in preparation; Additional file
1). However, BLAST results obtained with several ORFs in
the DpAV4 genome provide evidence that certain ichnovirus ORFs have their closest relatives in an ascovirus
genome. Specifically, we identified a 13-kbp region that
contains a cluster of three genes (Fig. 1, ORF90, 91 and 93;
Additional files 1 and 2) that have close homologs in a
GfIV gene family composed of seven members [28]. All
contain a domain similar to a conserved domain found in
the pox-D5 family of NTPases. To date, this pox-D5
domain has been identified as a NTP binding domain of
about 250 amino acid residues found only in viral proteins encoded by poxvirus, iridovirus, ascovirus and mimivirus genomes. These genes seem to be specific to GfIV, as
they are absent in the three sequenced genomes of other
ichnoviruses, namely CsIV, Tranosema rostrales ichnovirus
(TrIV), and Hyposoter fugitivus ichnovirus (HfIV).

More specifically, in DpAV4, ORF90 encodes a protein of
925 amino acid residues that is 40% similar from position
140 to 925 to a protein of 972 amino acid residues
encoded by the ORF1 contained in the segment C20 in the
GfIV genome (Fig. 2). These two proteins can therefore be
considered putative orthologs. The 480 C-terminal residues of this DpAV4 protein are also 42% similar to the Cterminal domain of the protein homologs encoded by the
ORF1 of the D1 and D4 GfIV segments, 36% similar to the
N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of the protein
encoded by the ORFs 184R and 128L of the iridovirus CIV
and LCDV, and 30% similar with those encoded by ORFs
119, 99 and 78 in the ascovirus genomes of HvAV3e,
SfAV1a and TnAV2c, respectively. Overall, this indicates
that this DpAV4 protein is more closely related to that of
GfIV than to those found in other ascovirus and iridovirus
genomes currently available in databases. ORF091
encodes a protein of 161 amino acid residues similar only
with the C-terminal domain of three proteins encoded by
the ORFs 1, 1 and 3, contained, respectively, in GfIV segments D1, D4 and D3. In contrast, ORF93 is closer to iridovirus and ascovirus genes than to GfIV genes. This

protein of 849 amino acid residues is 43% similar over all
its length to CIV ORF184R orthologs in all iridoviral and
ascoviral genomes and is only 36% similar over 350
amino acid residues to the C-terminal domain of the GfIV
protein homologs encoded by the ORF1, 2, 1, 1, 1 and 1
in, respectively, the C20, C21, D1, D2, D3 and D4 segments of this virus.
Analysis of the genes surrounding the DpAV4 ORF-90-9193 cluster confirms that this virus has an ascovirus origin
since this region contains ORFs that are close homologs of
genes in iridovirus and ascovirus genomes. Upstream
from the ORF-90-91-93 cluster, an ORF encoding the
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1 subunit C is present,
which is an ortholog of the iridoviral CIV ORF176R and
the ascoviral SfAV1a ORF008. Downstream from this
cluster, there are two genes, absent in known ascoviral
genomes, but similar to the iridoviral CIV ORF115L and
CIV ORF132L. These two genes encode, respectively, a
chromosomal replication initiation protein and zinc finger protein. In between them, a gene encoding a small
protein is present that is similar to that encoded by the
ORF069L of the iridovirus CIV, and which corresponds to
the ALI-like protein also found in entomopoxviruses [30].
Since the three DpAV4 genes have relatives in all ascovirus
and iridovirus genomes sequenced so far, their presence
in the DpAV4 genome cannot result from a lateral transfer
that occurred from an ichnovirus genome related GfIV to
DpAV4. Thus, as these DpAV4 genes are the closest relatives of the pox-D5 gene family present in GfIV identified
so far, they could be considered a landmark of the symbiogenic ascovirus origin of the ichnovirus lineage to
which this polydnavirus belongs. An alternative explanation is that the presence of DpAV4-like genes in the
genome of GfIV resulted from a lateral transfer from viral
genomes closely related to those of GfIV and DpAV4.

Indeed, this might have happened when a Glypta wasp
was infected by an ancestral virus related to DpAV4. Nevertheless, the symbiogenic origin of GfIV from ascoviruses
is also supported by morphological features of its virions
[28], which, aside from similarities in shape, also show
reticulations on their surface in negatively stained preparations, a characteristic of the virions of all ascovirus species examined to date [7].
Relationships between ascovirus and ichnovirus virion
proteins
Because ascovirus virions and ichnovirus particles display
structural similarities, we developed an approach to
search for homologs of virion structural proteins in ichnoviruses. These approaches were initiated in 2000 and
recently finalized, but some of the conclusions have been
published [14]. To date, only two virion proteins from the
Campoletis sonorensis ichnovirus (CsIV) have been characterized [31,32]. The first is the P44 (Acc N° AAD01199),
a structural protein that appears to be located as a layer
between the out envelope and nucleocapsid, and the second, P12, a capsid protein (Acc N° AF004367). Presently,
there are more than one hundred ascoviral or iridoviral
MCP sequences in databases. BLAST searches using these
sequences failed to detect any similarities between CsIV
virion proteins and ascoviral or iridoviral MCPs, or any
other proteins [33]. To evaluate the possibility that
homology between ichnovirus and ascovirus virion proteins may simply not be detectable by conventional Blastp
searches, we used a different method, WAPAM (weighted
automata pattern matching; [34]). The models were
designed on the basis of a previous study [22] demonstrating that MCP encoded by ascovirus, iridovirus, phycodnavirus and asfarvirus genomes are related, and all contain 7
conserved domains separated by hinges of very variable
size. We investigated these conserved domains further
using hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA, [35]). This

analysis revealed that most conservation occurred at the
level of hydrophobic residues, as expected for structural
proteins (Additional file 3a and 3b). The size variability of
the hinges between conserved domains and the conservation of hydrophobic residues might explain why BLAST
searches using iridoviral and ascoviral MCP sequences
have limited ability to detect MCP orthologs in phycodnavirus and asfarvirus genomes. We designed two syntactic
models (see Materials and Methods), which together were
able to specifically align all MCP sequences of the four

In addition to the above analysis, ten syntactic models
were developed using proteins conserved in the three

Protein Sequence Analysis at http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/ and the statistical relevance of the secondary structures were evaluated
with Psipred at http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/. C, E and H in lanes 4 to 6 respectively indicated for each amino acid that it is
involved in a coiled, b sheet or a helix structure. Using default parameters of Psipred, upper case letters indicate that the predicted secondary structure is statically significant in Psipred results. Significant secondary structures are highlighted in yellow. In

classical in silico methods appeared to be inappropriate to predict statistically significant secondary structures in conserved
structural protein rich in b strand such as iridovirus and ascovirus MCP. In contrast, a complete and coherent domain comparison was obtained by HCA profiles (fig. S3b, c).

models detected homologs among ichnovirus proteins
available in databases, except for one (see Materials and
Methods section), developed from small proteins
encoded by the DpAV4 ORF041, SfAV1a ORF061,
HvAV3a ORF74, and TnAV2c ORF118 in the ascovirus
genomes, and iridovirus CIV ORF347L and mimivirus
MIV ORF096R genomes, respectively. Importantly, these
proteins have orthologs in vertebrate iridoviruses, phycodnaviruses, and asfarvirus. In SfAV1a, the peptide
encoded by ORF061 is one of the virion components. In
ascoviruses, iridoviruses, phycodnaviruses, and the asfarvirus, they have been annotated as thioredoxines, proteins
that play a role in initiating viral infection [37-39]. Database mining with our model revealed four hits with CsIV
sequences (Acc N°. M80623, S47226, AF236017,
AF362508) each a homolog ORF of SfAV1a ORF061. In
fact, these sequences correspond to several variants of a
single region contained in the B segment of the CsIV
genome. To date, these have not been annotated in the
final CsIV genome, probably because they overlap a
recombination site. HCA analyses confirmed that the
hydrophobic cores were conserved (Fig. 3b and Additional file 3d and 3e).
The chromosomal locations of genes encoding these two
CsIV proteins, i.e., P44 and P12, were also consistent with
the symbiogenesis hypothesis. In fact, the ORF encoding
P44 is not found in proviral DNA. It is notable that no
ORFs encoding orthologs of P44 or other structural proteins such as MCPs are found in any of the other three ichnovirus genomes sequenced – TrIV, GfIV, HfIV [8,14].
Therefore, this indicates that the orthologs of ichnovirus
MCPs and other virion structural proteins are also probably located in the genomes of these wasps, i.e., not in proviral DNA. In contrast to this, we found that the gene
encoding the CsIV ortholog of SfAV1a ORF061 is located
within the proviral DNA. Whether ortholog proteins are
similarly involved in the TrIV, GfIV and HfIV biology,
their genes are not found in proviral DNA, since no
matches were detected in their viral genomes. The phylogenetic analysis performed previously on P44 and the
SfAV1a ORF061 orthologs [15] indicated that they have
an ancestor close to that of the ascoviruses and iridoviruses.
As in the case of genes encoding pox-D5 family of
NTPases in all ascoviruses, iridoviruses, and GfIV, genes
encoding virion proteins cannot result from a horizontal
transfer from a Campoplegine or Banchine ichnovirus
genome to all ascovirus, iridovirus, phycodnaviruses and
asfarvirus genomes. As the ascovirus genes encoding the
two virion proteins investigated here are the closest relatives of virion proteins in CsIV, they can be considered a
landmark reflecting the symbiogenic origin of the two ichnovirus lineages from ascoviruses closely related to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/253

DpAV4. In fact, the difficulty encountered in elucidating
their sequence relationships can be explained by a combination of the marked transition from ascovirus to ichnovirus, and the significant selection constraints that
resulted as the latter virus type evolved from the former.
Impact of the intimate environment on lateral gene
transfer
Analysis of available ascovirus, iridovirus and ichnovirus
genomes provides some of the first molecular support for
the hypothesis that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses
by symbiogenesis. However, examining genes shared only
by ascovirus, iridovirus and ichnovirus genomes likely
limits the sources of genes that contributed to the evolution and complexity of these viruses, especially of the role
of lateral gene transfer. Relevant to this is the recent finding that an important part of the mimivirus and phycodnavirus genomes had a bacterial origin [28]. Obviously,
this did not lead to the conclusion that these viruses had
a bacterial origin. The cytoplasmic environment in which
these viruses replicate is rich in bacterial DNA because
their amobae and unicellular algae hosts feed on bacteria
that they digest in their cytoplasm. Thus, it has been proposed [28] that lateral transfers of bacterial DNA within
these viral genomes were driven by intimate coupling of
recombination and viral genome replication. Indeed, replication of these viruses is similar to that of bacteriophage
T4. This mode of replication has been called recombination-primed replication. It permits integration of DNA
molecules with sequence homology as short as 12-bp
[28,40]. The replication machinery used by ascoviruses,
iridoviruses, mimiviruses, phycodnaviruses, and other
nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) [41,42] is
common to all of them, despite differences in the specifics
of replication in each virus family. It can therefore be
expected that recombination-primed replication occurred
repeatedly during evolution of both these viruses and the
genome of their eukaryotic hosts. In an eukaryotic cellular
environment in which bacteria, chromosomes, NCLDV
viruses and non-NCLDVs (such as baculoviruses) intimately cohabit temporarily or permanently, recombination-primed replication is able to allow reciprocal passive
lateral transfers between viral genomes, host chromosomes, and bacterial DNA. Under these conditions, lateral
transfers are considered passive since they just result from
the intimate environment and not from an active mechanism dedicated to genetic exchanges. In ascoviruses and
iridoviruses, the occurrence of such lateral transfers is supported by BLASTp searches that detected the presence of
ORFs whose closest relatives have their origin within
eukaryotic genomes (e.g., for DpAV4, in Additional data
1, ORFs 029, 049, 077, 080, 083, 118), bacterial genomes
(e.g., for DpAV4, in Additional data 1, ORFs 056, 057,
059, 112, 115 and119) or viruses belonging to other

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:253

NCLDV and non-NCLDV families (e.g., for DpAV4, in
Additional data 1, ORFs 007, 037, 062, 068).
The transmission of ascoviruses is unusual in that they are
poorly infectious per os and appear to be transmitted
among lepidopteran hosts by parasite wasp vectors at oviposition [7,43]. The genome of the ascoviruses can be replicated in presence of polydnavirus DNA either within the
reproductive tissues of female wasps or within the body of
the parasitized hosts infected by both polydnavirus and
ascovirus. Consequently, integrated sequences of ascovirus origin can be expected within wasp and polydnavirus
genomes. Reciprocally, sequences of polydnavirus origin
may have been integrated in ascovirus genomes, whatever
the wasp origin, ichneumonid or braconid. One gene
family related to a bacterial family of N-acetyl-L-glutamate 5-phosphotransferase (Acc. N° of the closest bacterial relatives YP_001354925, CAM32558, ZP_00944224,
ZP_02006449), identified only within the SfAV1a,
HvAV3e and TnAV2c genomes, supports this conclusion.
It has been found in the genome of a bracovirus, Cotesia
congregata BracoVirus (CcBV [13]; Fig. 4). Since this gene
is absent in the genome of Microplitis demolitor BV, a
related bracovirus [8], it is difficult to infer the direction of
the lateral transfer between the common ancestors of the
three ascoviruses and of the wasp C. congregata. However,
they unambiguously indicate that there was at least one
lateral transfer for this gene between the common ancestor of ascoviruses and the parasitic wasp.
Since iridoviruses, like ascoviruses and other virus species
[44,45], are, in some cases, vectored by parasitic wasps,
databases were mined using all the available ichnovirus
virus proteins as queries. We found no significant relationships between CsIV, HfIV and TrIV genomes and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/253

genomes of their putative closest relatives NCLDV and
non-NCLDV relatives. This indicates that passive lateral
gene transfers from virus to eukaryotes that are successfully spread and maintained in ichnovirus genomes
remain rare events. One case of such lateral transfer was
described in the CcBV genome. In this genome, aside from
the presence of cardinal endogenous eukaryotic retrotranposon and Polintons that transposed in the chromosomal
DNA of the proviral form of CcBV [46-48], two genes
encoding AcMNPV P94-related proteins, which have their
closest relatives among granuloviruses (XcGV), were
found. This suggests that CcBV contained at least two
cases of lateral transfers between non-NCLDV and a bracovirus.
Concluding remarks
Our results provide another source of evidence that passive lateral gene transfers have occurred regularly during
evolution from bacteria to viruses and eukaryotes, and
between viruses and eukaryotes [49-52]. Even if the poxD5 NTPase genes in the GfIV genome, and the MCP and
SfAV061-like genes in the CsIV genome, indicate that they
have an ascovirus origin, they provide only limited evidence supporting an ascovirus origin of ichnoviruses.
Indeed, their sequence conservation and biological characteristics suggest that there were repeated lateral transfers
during evolution between ascoviruses and wasp genomes,
including the proviral ichnovirus loci. This raises an
important issue about the role of lateral transfers during
co-evolution of the NCLDVs and non-NCLDVs, ichnovirus, wasp and parasitized host. Indeed, genetic materials
of various origins have been exchanged and maintained
during co-evolution. This therefore suggests that ichnoviruses might be chimeric entities partly resulting from sev-

eral lateral transfer events of DNA fragments with viral
origins.
Symbiogenesis was first proposed as an evolutionary
mechanism when it became widely recognized that mitochondria and plastids originated from free-living prokaryotes [7]. The genomes of the endosymbiotic cyanobacteria
and proteobacteria, respectively, at the origin of chloroplasts and mirochondria have evolved by reduction of
several orders of magnitude to the approximate size of
plasmids. Concurrently, nuclear genomes have been the
recipients of plastid genomes. This relocation of the genes
encoding most proteins of the endosymbiotic bacteria to
the host nucleus is the ultimate step of this evolutionary
process, so-called endosymbiogenesis [7,53]. Recent studies of plants have revealed a constant deluge of DNA from
organelles to the nucleus since the origin of organelles
[54]. This allows the host cell to have the genetic control
on its organelles, in a relationship that is closer to enslavement or domestication than to a symbiosis or a mutualism in which the organelles would recover benefits from
their contribution to the eukaryotic cell well-being. To
date, this deluge of DNA is considered to correspond to
passive lateral transfers that result from the interactions
between the life cycle of the organelle and nuclear replication.
Numerous cases of symbiogenesis between endocellular
bacteria and a wide variety of eukaryotic hosts have been
characterized. However, recent work has demonstrated
that this evolutionary process was not restricted to bacteria. It also occurred between endocellular eukaryotes such
as unicellular algae and fungal endophyte in plants
[55,56]. Endosymbiogenesis was also proposed as the
evolutionary mechanism that allowed some invertebrate
viruses with a large double-stranded DNA genome related
to the nudiviruses and the ascoviruses [22], to have led,
respectively, to the origin of bracoviruses and ichnoviruses, which are currently recognized as forming two genera within the family Polydnaviridae. Although presently
there is no definitive evidence ruling out the hypothesis
that the resemblance between ichnovirus and ascovirus
virions is only an evolutionary convergence, the genomic
differences between ascovirus and ichnoviruses are in
good agreement with the symbiogenetic hypothesis.
Indeed, they match an evolutionary scenario of endosymbiogenesis during which, from a single integration event
of symbiotic virus genome, viral genes were lost and/or
translocated from the provirus to other chromosomal
regions (Fig. 5). In parallel, host genes of interest for the
wasp parasitoid were integrated and diversified by selection and gene duplication in the proviral DNA. In this scenario, the more ancient symbiogenesis, the rarer the traces
of genes from viral origin in the ichnovirus genome would
be. This constitutes a constraint that dramatically limits

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/253

the possibility to investigate the evolutionary links
between ascovirus and ichnovirus. Results of our analyses
demonstrate that the situation is also complicated by the
fact that lateral gene transfers unrelated to the origin of
ichnoviruses cause important misleading background
noise. Moreover, the scenario in Figure 5 is close to a previously proposed version [57], but is not consistent with
results presented here, nor with recently accumulated
knowledge on DNA transfer from organelles into the
nucleus. Since endocellular environments favour lateral
transfers between virus and wasp nucleus, it can be proposed that genes of virus origin that are involved in the
ichnovirus biology were passively integrated in one or several loci, step by step over time, alone or through transfers
of gene clusters, or even the entire viral genome. Since parasitoid wasps are able to vector different viruses [44,45],
this second scenario opens the exciting possibility that
virus genes involved in the ichnovirus biology might correspond to a gene patchwork resulting from transfers from
viruses belonging to different NCLDV and non-NCLVD
families. Because of the background noise due to lateral
gene transfers found in these systems, elucidating the origins of ichnoviruses will be very time-consuming, requiring new accurate experimental approaches to generate
more robust evidence. Sequencing wasp genomes to identify proteins of viral origin that are components of virions
and involved in the assembly of these may well contribute
to our understanding of how ichnoviruses and bracoviruses evolved from other insect DNA viruses.

Methods
Database mining
Searches for similarities were mainly developed using
facilities of BLAST programs at two websites http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi
and
http:genoweb.univ-rennes1.fr/Serveur-GPO/out
ils.php3?id_rubrique=47. For DpAV4 genes having their
origin within eukaryotic, bacterial or virus genomes
belonging to NCLDV and non-NCLDV families, the closest gene was located using the distance trees supplied with
each BLAST search at the NCBI website.
Defining syntactic model
Construction of syntactic models: Conserved amino acid
blocks and positions described previously [15,22] and
with new data sets were verified or determined using
MEME at http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/meme.html. In
the first step, we used motifs resulting from MEME to
make MAST minings in databases at http://
meme.sdsc.edu/meme/mast.html. Since MEME motifs
depend significantly on the data set use to calculate them,
this approach did not enable an exhaustive detection of
homologs among ascoviruses, iridoviruses, phycodnaviruses, mimiviruses and asfarviruses, and the detection
sensitivity was ultimately very similar to that obtained

Two solutions can account for the final chromosomal organisation of the proviral ichnovirus genome, monolocus or multilocus, since this question is not fully understood in either
wasp lineage. More complex alternatives to this three-step
process might also be proposed and would involve, for
example, the complete de novo creation of a mono or multi
locus proviral genome from the recruitment by recombination or transposition of ascoviral and host genes located elsewhere in the wasp chromosomes. This model for the
chromosomal organization of proviral DNA in polydnaviruses is consistent with data recently published [58].

these models was obtained empirically until they allowed
an exhaustive detection in refseq-protein and Genbank
databases of the homologs among ascoviruses, iridoviruses, phycodnaviruses, mimiviruses and asfarviruses. The
procedures were done until we were only able to detect
exact match with the syntactic model. Whatever obtained
with WAPAM, they required a confirmation with other
approaches. Here, we used Psipred result comparison for
regions with scores over 7 and HCA analyses for regions
having scores lower than 7 with Psipred. This simplified
the statistical treatment of the result obtained with
WAPAM, since all exact matches have significance or a
score
of
100%.
