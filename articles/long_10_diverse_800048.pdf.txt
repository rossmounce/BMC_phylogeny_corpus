Diverse modes of reproduction in the marine
free-living ciliate Glauconema trihymene
Research article

Hongan Long* and Rebecca A Zufall

Abstract
Background: Most free-living ciliates reproduce by equal fission or budding during vegetative growth. In certain
ciliates, reproduction occurs inside the cyst wall, viz. reproductive cysts, but more complex reproductive strategies have
generally been thought to be confined to parasitic or symbiotic species, e.g. Radiophrya spp.
Results: In addition to equal fission, asymmetric binary division and reproductive cysts were discovered in the freeliving bacterivorous scuticociliate Glauconema trihymene Thompson, 1966. Asymmetric division is an innate
physiological state that can be induced by sufficient food, and the higher the food concentration, the longer the
asymmetric division persists. During asymmetric division, nuclear and somatic structures divide with transiently
arrested cytokinesis and variable positioning of macronuclei. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the small subunit of
ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) sequences, showed that the G. trihymene isolate studied here nests with typical
scuticociliates and is paraphyletic to both the symbiotic apostome and astome ciliates, some of which also produce
progeny by asymmetric division.
Conclusions: The asymmetric division in G. trihymene has no precedent among undisturbed free-living ciliates. The
coexistence of multiple modes of reproduction may represent a previously undescribed reproductive strategy for
ciliates living on food patches in coastal waters. This may also be indicative of similar reproductive strategies among
other polyphenic ciliates, which have not been intensively studied. Asymmetric division provides a special opportunity
for studying ciliates' phenotypic plasticity and may also illuminate the origins of multicellularity.
Background
Ciliates are a diverse group of unicellular eukaryotes
characterized by two kinds of nuclei in each cell: a germline micronucleus and a somatic macronucleus. Freeliving ciliates are known to exhibit diversity in modes of
reproduction [1-3]. Most of these reproductive modes
include equal fission or budding. In certain ciliates,
including Tetrahymena patula and Colpoda inflata,
reproduction can also occur inside the cyst wall, viz.
reproductive cysts [3,4].
Symbiotic ciliates like the astome ciliates, e.g., Radiophrya spp., and certain apostome ciliates, e.g., Polyspira
spp., reproduce by forming cell chains, also called
catenoid colonies, which are usually brought about by
repeated asymmetric division without separation of the
resulting filial products [3,5]. Some Tetrahymena, such as

temperature-sensitive cytokinesis-arrested mutants of T.
thermophila- strain cdaC, and T. pyriformis also showed
similar cell chains at high temperature [6,7] and similar
morphotypes were also recently reported in the nonreproductive artificial lethal mutants of T. thermophila
[8]. However, no free-living ciliates have been reported to
form cell chains in response to food (bacteria) concentration.
During early and late phases of equal fission, most ciliates share certain features, such as common positioning
of the macronucleus and the micronucleus, synchronization of macronuclear amitosis and fission furrow, and a
specific and well defined dividing size [9-11]. It is generally assumed that if food density meets requirements of
both cell development and division, the daughter cells
will be identical, so after division, the two daughter cells
could not be differentiated from each other [12-14].
However, ciliates from the same single cell isolate were
reported to have high diversity in physiological states,
such as cell size and volume, growth rate, feeding and

digestion [15-18], and certain ciliates even develop highly
unique physiological strategies to maximally adapt to
their habitats. For example, after feeding on the cryptomonad Geminigera cryophila, the mixotrophic red-tidecausing ciliate Myrionecta rubra retains the prey organelles, which continue to function in the ciliate for up to 30
days [19,20]. Comprehensive analysis of physiological
state changes of ciliates usually requires monitoring of
individuals for a relatively long period and therefore is
rarely conducted [15]. Most ciliates are currently unculturable or swim too fast for microscopic observation, further hindering such analyses.
In this study, we describe a series of reproductive strategies that have been previously unknown in free-living
ciliates. These types of reproduction occurred in all
newly established cultures of G. trihymene, a free-living
scuticociliate belonging to the class Oligohymenophorea,
which also includes Tetrahymena and Paramecium. The
division processes and the relationship between persistence time of asymmetric divisions and bacteria concentrations are described, and an updated life cycle and
phylogenetic position of G. trihymene are presented.

Results
Natural History of G. trihymene

The G. trihymene isolate described here, collected in
Hong Kong, is free-living and bacterivorous. It has a polyphenic life cycle that includes the following three previously described stages [21,22]: trophont, reniform, the
feeding and division stage, mostly 35 × 20 μm in vivo (Figure 1A, B); tomite, the dispersion and fast-swimming
stage in response to starvation, with a spindle-shaped
cell, mostly 30 × 15 μm in vivo (Figure 1E, F); resting cyst,
mostly rounded, dormant stage during trophic depletion,
ca. 20 μm in diameter. Like other free-living ciliates, G.
trihymene has a transcriptionally active macronucleus
and a germline micronucleus. The infraciliature and buccal apparatus are the same as in previous reports, however, we found the life cycle was much more complicated
and included two reproductive modes new to scuticociliates, asymmetric division and reproductive cysts.
Processes of asymmetric division in young cultures

Many slowly moving, well-fed trophonts (Figure 1C)
appeared within 24 hours after inoculation with tomites
in cultures of wheat grain medium. In all of the cultures, a
trophont underwent a cell division, but cytokinesis was
arrested prior to completion, creating a unit consisting of
two cells, now called "subcells" because of their failure to
separate. Typically, each of the two connected subcells
later underwent a second transverse division, resulting in
a chain of four subcells, each with a macronucleus, an
oral apparatus, and a contractile vacuole (Figures 1H;
2A). We define these chains of subcells as asymmetric

dividers. Asymmetric dividers vary in sizes from 30 × 15
μm to 180 × 30 μm in vivo, have diverse shapes consisting
of chains of 2-4 subcells (Figures 1G, H; 2A, J, O) and give
rise to two filial cells that could be morphologically differentiated from each other after each division. Similar
asymmetric dividers were also repeatedly found in different cultures, though the sizes varied with media type. Up
to 4 macronuclei were found in the cytoplasm of each
asymmetric divider (Figure 1H). Most undisturbed asymmetric dividers attached to the bottom of Petri dishes,
moved very slowly or stayed immobile and had two or
more rounded contractile vacuoles, pulsating with different frequencies (arrows in Figure 2C). The number of
asymmetric dividers in the cultures increased with time
from appearance of the first asymmetric divider.
Several asymmetric dividers were continuously followed on inverted microscopes. Two typical division processes of asymmetric dividers in young cultures (the 3rd
or 4th day after inoculation) are described in detail (Figure
2A-M):
The first division of one long asymmetric divider (Figure 2A) occurred about two hours after it was found.
During this first division, the cell's most anterior part was
released (the anterior and posterior ends were judged
from the moving direction and posterior position of the
contractile vacuoles) as a trophont and quickly swam
away (Figure 2B, arrowhead). The larger posterior part
became a new asymmetric divider (Figure 2C), which
then deformed so much that no clear body axis could be
determined (Figure 2D, E). The division types (transverse
or longitudinal) were thus not easily categorized and
many cleavage furrows appeared (Figure 2E, arrows). The
second asymmetric division occurred through disjuncture or fission at the most mature cleavage furrow (Figure
2F, G, arrowheads). Then after about three minutes, the
other two furrows broke (Figure 2F-H, double-arrowheads, arrows). Finally, three new asymmetric dividers,
which were also slowly moving or immobile and continued dividing highly unequally (Figure 2I, arrowheads),
and one trophont (Figure 2I, arrow) were produced. The
entire process described above occurred over the course
of 22 hours.
The most common asymmetric dividers in young cultures had two subcells (Figure 2J), which divided over the
course of 6 hours. The division process (Figure 2K-M)
was similar to the one described above in that the first
division yielded one active trophont (Figure 2L, arrow)
and one new asymmetric divider (Figure 2L, arrowhead).
After that, however, the newly formed asymmetric
divider divided into one trophont (Figure 2M, arrowhead)
and one new asymmetric divider (Figure 2M, arrow),
which became deformed and continued dividing highly
unequally. During each division, the asymmetric dividers
either produced one trophont and one new asymmetric

divider (as shown in Figure 2B, L, M) or two new asymmetric dividers (Figure 2G, H).
Asymmetric dividers and reproductive cysts in old cultures

When bacteria were depleted, most trophonts transformed into tomites and the cultures were termed "old".
In the soil extract medium with various bacteria concentrations, this usually occurred between 141 and 175 hours
after inoculation (Table 1). In old cultures, asymmetric
division continued, but produced tomites instead of trophonts (Figure 2O, arrow). Small asymmetric dividers
producing tomites sometimes looked like dividing
tomites (Figure 2S). Some asymmetric dividers were also
found to die and were observed with a large central vacuole. Reproductive cysts were also found: some asymmetric dividers developed transparent cyst walls and
continued to divide unequally one or two times inside the
cyst walls (Figure 2P-R).
Somatic and nuclear characteristics of asymmetric dividers
after protargol impregnation

Some asymmetric dividers had similar body shape to trophonts, except having two highly unequal macronuclei
(Figure 1D). Macronuclear divisions could also happen
several times before the completion of cytokinesis, producing up to 4 macronuclei in the same cytoplasm (Fig-

ure 1H). The positioning of macronuclei was highly
variable even if the cleavage furrows were clearly formed
(Figures 1G, H; 2N). Usually more than two buccal apparatuses were present in bigger asymmetric dividers (Figure 2N, arrowheads).
Is asymmetric division a cultural artifact?

Actively dividing asymmetric dividers were found in all
wheat grain medium cultures and cultures with bacterial
suspensions in the soil extract medium, as well as cultures started with single cells as inocula. Even though the
seawater for cultures was changed twice (natural seawater from coastal areas of Galveston TX, USA), asymmetric dividers were found in all cultures under study.
Asymmetric dividers also showed up in early cultures of
another seven G. trihymene isolates collected from
coastal areas of Texas, USA (Table 2). The regularity with
which asymmetric dividers appear and their consistent
response to bacterial concentrations (see below) suggest
that these asymmetric dividers are not cultural artifacts.
Relationship between asymmetric dividers and food
abundance

All asymmetric dividers first appeared on the 3rd to 4th
day (51-93 hours) (Figure 3, hollow bars) after inoculation
of tomites into three bacterial concentrations. The earli-

est asymmetric dividers appeared in the cultures with the
highest bacterial concentration (P < 0.05, Oneway
ANOVA; Figure 3, hollow bar B), on average 54 hours
after inoculation. There was no significant difference
between the time of first appearance of asymmetric
dividers in the other cultures (P > 0.05, Oneway ANOVA;
Figure 3, hollow bars A).
After the first asymmetric dividers appeared in each
culture, they were checked every 12 hours until no asymmetric dividers remained. The time interval between first
appearance of asymmetric dividers and the time when no
asymmetric divider could be found was recorded for each
culture (Figure 3, filled bars). The time during which no
asymmetric divider could be found was probably the stationary phase, when cells had run out of food so that they
could not divide at all. This time interval, reflecting the
total time of asymmetric divisions in each culture, was
found to increase with bacterial concentration (Figure 3,
filled bars, a-c; Oneway ANOVA, P < 0.05).
Phylogenetic position of Glauconema trihymene

Maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Baysian
trees, inferred from 18S SSU rDNA sequences, all show
that G. trihymene (Hong Kong isolate) groups with typical scuticociliates, like Anophryoides haemophila and
Miamiensis avidus (Figure 4). The Hong Kong isolate
shares 81.2% DNA pair-wise identity with a previously
submitted G. trihymene sequence [GenBank Accession
No.: AY169274].

Discussion
Updated life cycle of G. trihymene during vegetative
growth

The life cycle during vegetative growth of G. trihymene is
generalized in Figure 5, based on previous and current
studies [21,22]. The life cycle has multiple stages, as is
typical in polyphenic ciliates. These life stages could be
highly diverse and complex, depending on the total number of asymmetric divider morphotypes and food concentration. For simplification and clarity, most
intermediate asymmetric dividers are not shown in Figure 5.
Some free-living ciliates, for example, Tetrahymena
pyriformis, produce maximal progeny cells by shifting
their physiological states during starvation [23]. Similarly,
G. trihymene produces progeny cells by combining three
reproductive modes: asymmetric division, reproductive
cysts and equal fission. In addition, this is the first report
of reproductive cysts in scuticociliates, though they are
not uncommonly found in certain ciliate genera, like Colpoda and Tetrahymena [4]. If each morphotype of asymmetric dividers could be deemed as one life stage, which
could probably be the case as many similar or continuous
asymmetric divider morphotypes were repeatedly found
in cultures with different "age" or media, then the
updated life cycle of G. trihymene might rival most
known life cycles of free-living ciliates in complexity (Figure 5). G. trihymene thus provides a special opportunity
for studying ciliate polyphenism.
Although G. trihymene was first discovered early in
1966, it was believed to reproduce only by equal fission
during vegetative growth [21,22]. One reason for the persistence of this narrow view of G. trihymene reproduction
is that, to date, few studies have been conducted on G. trihymene and they have mainly focused on morphology or
systematics rather than reproduction dynamics [21,22].
Secondly, some of the reproductive forms appear only
under particular food conditions, for example, in the
Hong Kong isolate, asymmetric dividers appeared on the
3rd or 4th day after inoculation, when bacterial supply was

the newly inoculated cultures (hollow bars) and the duration of persistence of asymmetric divisions after the appearance of the first asymmetric divider (filled bars) were noted for cells maintained in the Erd-Schreiber soil extract cultures with one of three different bacterial concentrations.

high and disappeared soon after the appearance of
tomites. The disappearance of asymmetric dividers was
probably associated with the transition from exponential
culture growth to the stationary phase. Third, the relative
immobility and irregular body shapes of most asymmet-

ric dividers (Figures 1G, H; 2E, N), could cause them to be
mistaken as cultural artifacts or debris. Lastly, some
asymmetric dividers are easily mistaken as conjugating
cells or equal binary dividers, if observed on low magnifications (<100×) (Figure 2J). Thus, it is no wonder that

these usually large, irregularly shaped asymmetric dividers were unreported until this study.
The class Oligohymenophorea, to which all scuticociliates and the well-known Tetrahymena and Paramecium
belong, contains highly diverse species [24], but only a
few model species, such as Tetrahymena thermophila and
Paramecium tetraurelia, are under intensive biological
study. Most members of Oligohymenophorea, especially
the marine species, are limited to taxonomic and systematic studies or are undescribed [2,25]. We predict that as
life histories of more species are closely examined, much
more diversity in reproductive strategies will be discovered among free-living protists.
Proposed ecological roles of various life cycle stages

The high feeding efficiency, slow movement and arrested
cytokinesis observed in G. trihymene asymmetric dividers may be advantageous. Based on the results of our culturing experiments, we conclude that asymmetric
dividers are innate physiological states of G. trihymene,
which can be induced to occur in bacteria-sufficient
media. Cells with asymmetric divisions may ingest more
food than those without; most asymmetric dividers had
many oral apparatuses with oral membranes beating
quickly. They may be able to consume as many bacteria as
several trophonts in the same period of time (Figure 2N,
arrowheads). In addition, the relative immobility of these
asymmetric dividers may minimize their energy consumption [26]. The arrested cytokinesis could also save
energy for asymmetric dividers, compared with equal
dividers.
We propose the following ecological scenario that
comes about as G. trihymene with a capacity for asymmetric divisions explores its surrounding environment.
Suppose one G. trihymene trophont finds a food patch
with plenty of bacteria, but also with many other bacteria-feeding protists. To avoid being a loser in this
resource exploitation competition, for 2-3 days G. trihymene vigorously feeds on bacteria and divides equally.
While plenty of bacteria remain, some trophonts asymmetrically divide, producing trophonts and more asymmetric dividers. When the food patch is nearly exhausted,
most trophonts transform into tomites, and the asymmetric dividers instead of producing trophonts, produce
tomites. After most of the bacteria are consumed, most
tomites become resting cysts. Asymmetric dividers
secrete a cyst wall and continue dividing inside, producing reproductive cysts, which ultimately become resting
cysts. Some tomites transformed from trophonts or
released by asymmetric dividers swim rapidly to seek
more food patches, transforming back into trophonts
when they find new food patches and repeating the above
processes. The quickly dispersing tomites, the tolerating
resting cysts, and the diverse reproductive strategy may

Page 8 of 11

enable G. trihymene to identify and dominate enough
food patches and survive in the coastal water community.
Phylogenetic position of G. trihymene, and asymmetric
division

G. trihymene groups with typical scuticociliates with high
bootstrap support and posterior probability, though the
precise relationships within the clades remain unresolved
(Figure 4). In addition, G. trihymene has high SSU rDNA
pair-wise identity with Anophryoides haemophila (96%),
the scuticociliate causing the "Bumper car disease" of
American lobsters and Miamiensis avidus (96%), a polyphenic, parasitic ciliate, which causes diseases in fish
[27,28]. Our result supports the monophyly of scuticociliatia, despite what was found in earlier studies utilizing a
previously reported G. trihymene SSU rDNA sequence
[GenBank Accession No.: AY169274] [29,30], which we
believe to be erroneous. AY169274 shares great similarity
with SSU sequences of some flagellates, e.g. it has 96%
identity with the 18S rDNA sequences of the nanoflagellate Spumella sp. GOT220 [GenBank Accession No.:
EF027354]. In line with our interpretation, the most
recent study on morphology and morphogenesis of G. trihymene (performed by the same group that submitted the
previous Gt SSU rDNA sequence) showed that it is
indeed a typical scuticociliate [22].
Asymmetric divisions, similar to those in G. trihymene,
occur in certain apostome and many astome ciliates (see
phylogenetic position in Figure 4), though the details of
division had never been studied using continuous
microscopy [5]. Such asymmetric dividers were called
catenoid colonies in these host-dependent ciliates. Asymmetric dividers were so named in the present study to
emphasize the difference between the two filial cells. As
in the asymmetric division of G. trihymene in Figure 2A,
long cell chains in the parasitic and commensal astome
and apsotome ciliates are formed by repeated incomplete
divisions without separation of the resulting filial products, after which some subcells are fully or partially
pinched off. These subcells require subsequent metamorphosis to regain the form typical of the normal trophont
stage of the life cycle [3,5].
The results of the phylogenetic analysis suggest that
complex life cycles including asymmetric division are
either 1) an ancestral feature of these three groups that
has been modified, lost, or not yet discovered in other
free-living species, or 2) a convergent trait that has arisen
multiple times independently in these closely related
taxa.
Asymmetric division: one clue to multicellularity?

The colonial flagellate hypothesis, claiming that flagellated protists living as colonies evolved into the first animals, has inspired extensive productive exploration on

Long and Zufall BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:108
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/108

the origin of multicellularity [31-34]. The asymmetric
division of G. trihymene serves as an alternative mechanism through which ciliates may have led to a multicellular form: a multicellular form could arise by a ciliate with
one macronucleus and one micronucleus subdividing
itself as a result of growth followed by arrested cytokinesis. It should be noted, however, that such asymmetric
division does not result in different developmental fates
akin to truly multicellular ciliate species, such as
Zoothamnium alternans [35,36].
As is shown in this study, asymmetric dividers produce
new asymmetric dividers and trophonts by successive
asymmetric divisions, in favorable conditions, and the
more available food, the longer the asymmetric divisions
persisted (Figure 3, filled bars). If asymmetric dividers
lived in consistently bacteria-rich environments for a
long time, they might retain the multicellular form, but
lose the ability to produce trophonts or tomites. Bacteriarich environments were common in the ancient ocean,
which had very different chemistry from that of today's
[37,38]. Thus, it is possible that some multicellular organisms, which have not yet been discovered or have since
gone extinct, originated from certain asymmetric dividers of ciliates.

Conclusions
Diverse reproductive modes in G. trihymene were unexpectedly discovered. This study is the first to report
asymmetric division and reproductive cysts in scuticociliates. In addition, the presence of multiple reproductive
modes is a previously undescribed reproductive strategy
for ciliates living on food patches in coastal waters. The
asymmetric dividers may give insight into possible origins of multicellularity and provide a special opportunity
for studying ciliate polyphenism. We predict that asymmetric division and other reproductive strategies will be
discovered in other polyphenic protists through more
intensive study.
Methods
Sampling and identifying G. trihymene

G. trihymene PRA-270 was isolated with a fine pipette
from a seawater rinse of a newly dead crab (species
unknown) collected from a sand beach near the pier of
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear
Water Bay, Hong Kong (22°20' N; 114°17' E) on August
20, 2007. The salinity was about 33‰, temperature 26°C,
and pH 8.1. The cultures used in this study were derived
from a single G. trihymene cell of the Hong Kong isolate.
Seven other isolates were collected from Texas coastal
areas (Table 2). The salinity was about 33‰ and temperature ranged from 23 to 31°C. Trophonts and tomites of G.
trihymene were observed in vivo first using a stereomicroscope and then an epi-fluorescence microscope at

100-1000×. The nuclear apparatuses and infraciliature
were revealed by the protargol impregnation method
[39]. The protargol S™ was manufactured by Polysciences
Inc., Warrington, PA (Cat No.: 01070). Drawings were
based on free-hand sketches. One subculture of the Hong
Kong isolate in this study was deposited in ATCC (American Type Culture Collection; Reg. No.: PRA-270).
Monitoring individual asymmetric dividers with
continuous microscopy

For continuous microscopy of G. trihymene reproduction, 50 cultures were established in wheat grain medium
(100 × 15 mm plastic Petri dishes each with 3 autoclaved
wheat grains in 30 mL autoclaved seawater, 0.2 g/grain,
and with ca. 50 tomites in 100 μL stock culture medium
as inoculum). The salinity was about 31‰, pH 8.0. All
cultures were maintained at room temperature, ca. 23°C.
Most asymmetric dividers, which were first observed
under a stereomicroscope, were immobile or slowly moving on bottoms of Petri dishes, and their position was
marked on the Petri dish bottom. The asymmetric dividers were then observed and followed under an inverted
microscope (100-400×; Olympus IX71). To minimize disturbance to asymmetric dividers during continuous
multi-day observation, low light intensity and low magnification were used. Asymmetric dividers from 3-7 day-old
cultures were continuously isolated with fine pipettes and
impregnated with protargol, in order to check the nuclei
and infraciliature characters during asymmetric divisions.
Effect of bacterial concentration on asymmetric division

The Erd-Schreiber soil extract medium added with bacterial suspension has recently been shown to be efficient for
culturing G. trihymene [40,41] (we believe Urocryptum
tortum in [40] is a junior synonym of G. trihymene,
because of their great similarity in living morphology,
infraciliature, habitat, as well as the life cycle characteristics). To prepare bacterial suspension, 10 μL stock culture
medium without cells was inoculated into 3 mL autoclaved seawater LB medium in test tubes (seawater LB
recipe: 12.5 g LB broth in 500 mL autoclaved filtered natural seawater) and cultured at 30°C, 200 rpm, overnight,
to maximal growth. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 7378 g in 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes (1 mL
bacteria culture in each tube) with a microcentrifuge and
the supernatant was removed. Then 1 mL sterile ErdSchreiber soil extract medium was added to each tube to
wash the bacteria pellets, at 7378 g. This washing procedure was repeated twice. Each pellet was finally resuspended with 1 mL soil extract medium and combined in a
sterile 50 mL polypropylene conical tube (BD Flacon™).
Bacterial suspensions of 3 mL, 0.3 mL and 0.03 mL
were added separately into 3 Petri dishes with sterile soil

extract medium to reach a final volume of 30 mL (marked
as 1×, 0.1× and 0.01× for each concentration, respectively). It should be noted that the Erd-Schreiber soil
extract medium was not a rich medium supporting
growth of a large number of bacteria. Four replicates were
prepared for each concentration. After each culture was
inoculated with about 50 tomites in 100 μL stock culture
medium, all 12 cultures were placed on a rocking platform at 3 rpm. Each culture was checked every 12 hours
for asymmetric dividers, until 50 hours after the inoculation (preliminary experiments showed that the earliest
appearance of asymmetric dividers occurred 50 hours
after inoculation with tomites). After 50 hours, all cultures were checked for appearance of asymmetric dividers every two hours until they were first observed in each
culture. The first appearance time of asymmetric dividers
and tomites was recorded for each culture. Subsequently,
all cultures were checked for the presence of asymmetric
dividers every 12 hours, until all of them disappeared
from each culture. The disappearance time point of
asymmetric dividers for each culture was also recorded.
Amplifying, cloning and sequencing of SSU rDNA

Cells from the stock culture were harvested in one 1.5 mL
eppendorf tube with a micro-centrifuge, at 1844 g. Supernatant was removed and the pellet was re-suspended
with 20 μL autoclaved seawater. The cell suspension was
directly used as DNA template for amplifying the SSU
rDNA. Universal eukaryotic primers for SSU rRNA were
used: forward 5'-AACCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAGT-3',
reverse
5'-TGATCCTTCTGCAGGTTCACCTAC-3'
[42]. PCR programs were performed using the iProof™
High-Fidelity PCR kit (Bio-Rad, CA): 1 cycle (98°C, 2
min); 30 cycles (98°C, 10 s; 70°C, 30s; 72°C, 50s); 1 cycle
(72°C, 7 min). The PCR products were then purified with
the QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Sciences, MD)
and cloned with the Zero Blunt TOPO kit (Invitrogen,
CA). The plasmid DNA was isolated from transformant
colonies using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen,
CA) and four clones were sequenced with the BigDye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, CA) on an automated
ABI 3130 XL sequencer in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Texas Health
Sciences Center at Houston.
Sequence availability and phylogenetic tree reconstruction

Sequences were aligned in ClustalW [43] (executed as a
plug-in in Geneious Pro 4.0.4 [44]) and adjusted by hand.
1707 nucleotides (positions) were used in the analysis.
Maximum likelihood (ML) and parsimony (MP) phylogenetic analyses were performed in PAUP* [45] and Baysian
analyses (MB) in Mr. Bayes [46] (both executed in
Geneious Pro 4.0.4) using the best fit model as determined by ModelTest [47] (GTR+I+G). Support was
determined based on 100 bootstrap replicates (ML and
MP) or the posterior probability after one million generations, with an initial 10% burn-in (MB).
Statistical analysis

Oneway ANOVA analysis (Tukey HSD Test, α = 0.05,
JMP 7 software package) was conducted to assess the differences among first appearance time and persistence
time of asymmetric dividers in cultures with three different concentrations of bacterial suspension (data was logtransformed into normal distribution).
