Abstract
Background: Sequence-based phylogeny reconstruction is a fundamental task in Bioinformatics.
Practically all methods for phylogeny reconstruction are based on multiple alignments. The quality
and stability of the underlying alignments is therefore crucial for phylogenetic analysis.
Results: In this short report, we investigate alignments and alignment-based phylogenies
constructed for a set of 22 ABC transporters using CLUSTAL W and DIALIGN. Comparing the
22 "one-out phylogenies" one can obtain for this sequence set, some intrinsic phylogenetic
instability is observed — even if attention is restricted to branches with high bootstrapping
frequencies, the so-called safe branches. We show that this instability is caused by the fact that
both, CLUSTAL W as well as DIALIGN, apparently get "confused" by sequence repeats in some of
the ABC-transporter. To deal with such problems, two new DIALIGN options are introduced that
prove helpful in our context, the "exclude-fragment" (or "xfr") and the "self-comparison" (or "sc")
option.
Conclusion: "One-out strategies", known to be a useful tool for testing the stability of all sorts of
data-analysis procedures, can successfully be used also in testing alignment stability. In case
instabilities are observed, the sequences under consideration should be carefully checked for
putative causes. In case one suspects sequence repeats to be the cause, the new "sc" option can be
used to detect such repeats, and the "xfr" option can help to resolve the resulting problems.

1 Introduction
For more than three decades, sequence-based computer
programs for phylogenetic reconstruction are routinely
used for sequence-data analysis, see [10,34,11] for reviews
of various popular methods. They are crucial tools not
only for understanding gene and species evolution, but
also for analyzing the structure and function of proteins.
A good example is the family of ABC-transporter proteins

that became a topic of active research during the last few
years (ABC stands for ATP-Binding Casette). At present,
thousands of different ABC transporters are known; for
the bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti alone, around 150
ABC-transporter proteins have been identified [2,4]. Thus,
the sheer size of the ABC-transporter family makes it desirable to reduce experimental costs by using in silico methods for structural and functional annotation. In view of

some recent articles in which a close correspondence
between the phylogeny and physiological function of
these proteins was demonstrated (cf. [5,15,18,19,30]),
phylogenetic analysis may apparently be of some use in
this context: Putative functions of unknown ABC transporters can be delineated from their position within the
family tree. However, this perspective of using tree-reconstruction programs for in silico annotation makes it indispensable to thoroughly check their current reliability, as
well as that of the multi-alignment programs on which
such reconstruction programs are based.
Herein, we study the reliability of two standard multialignment programs, CLUSTALW and DIALIGN, by
applying them to ABC transporters. We apply the "oneout strategy" to analyze the stability of the alignments
constructed by these two methods, i.e., by removing – one
by one – individual sequences from the input sequence
set: Ideally, removing sequences from a sequence set
should not affect the alignment of the remaining
sequences; their alignment should agree with the subalignment derived for them by restricting the alignment

constructed for the complete sequence set (Fig. 1). But, as
we will demonstrate, this stability requirement is often
not fulfilled, and the resulting instabilities of alignments
may even cause – and can be detected by – instabilities of
the branching structure of the phylogenetic trees constructed from the alignments.
The most popular tool to test the reliability of a tree topology is the bootstrapping method. It works as follows [9,6]:
for a fixed alignment of sequences, a collection of new
alignments is generated by deleting some columns from
the alignment at random and replacing them by other columns from that alignment, also picked at random. The
tree-building algorithm is then applied to the resulting
collection of new alignments. The relative frequency with
which a chosen branch appears, its bootstrapping frequency,
is then taken as a measure of the confidence one can have
in this branch – or, more precisely, in the phylogenetic relevance of the corresponding split of the underlying
sequence set induced by this branch. Hence, bootstrapping can be used to assess the reliability of a tree's
branches derived from a fixed alignment and to identify

not reflect the reliability of the alignment itself. For this
paper, we used a threshold value of 5/6.

mum. Our study shows that the latter problem actually
plays a non-negligible role. Thus, it makes sense to
develop alternative optimisation algorithms for the fragment-based alignment approach [17,33,32].

In this study, only the safe branches of a tree topology will
be considered when comparing trees resulting from distinct alignments, and we will confirm that, as expected,
instabilities concerning these branches indicate instabilities of the underlying alignments.

One reason for the instabilities of the alignments constructed for the set of ABC transporters under investigation is the repetitive structure of three of its sequences. In
a last step, we will therefore decompose these sequences
into non-repetitive parts by applying another new option
of DIALIGN. For the resulting new sequence set, we will
also compute alignments and phylogenetic trees. Remarkably, the DIALIGN algorithm produces perfectly stable
alignments and phylogenies for this new data set.

Furthermore, we show that a new option that has been
added in the context of our investigations to the DIALIGN
software can lead to considerably improved alignments.
This option, called the exclude-fragment or, for short, the
xfr option, allows the user to exclude certain pairs of sites,
or pairs of segments, from being aligned to each other
and, this way, to introduce expert knowledge into the
alignment process as well as to explore interactively various alignment alternatives. In this regard, the xfr option is
sort of "dual" to the recently introduced anchored-alignment option where the program is required to align certain
user-specified parts of the sequences to each other – provided the requirements are consistent and there is at least
some degree of similarity between the specified regions
[3,27]. In this context, we also look at the influence of the
guide tree used by CLUSTAL W for constructing CLUSTAL
W alignments.
As a by-product of our study, we found that the numerical
values of the scores of multiple alignments produced by
DIALIGN are sometimes noticeably below the scores of
other multiple alignments that DIALIGN can be tricked to
find for the same sequence set using the xfr option. This
observation, while perhaps disturbing, but not of immediate relevance for the user, is apparently crucial for further
development of this tool. Indeed, every multi-alignment
approach has to address two major problems: (a) a procedure has to be defined that, in principle, associates a score
to every possible alignment of any given sequence set and
(b) an optimization algorithm has to be designed that finds
optimal (or near-optimal) alignments relative to that scoring procedure. Our study shows that DIALIGN can sometimes fail by some margin to find the maximum score
indicating that improvements of its optimization procedures could lead to considerable improvement of the
quality and, in particular, to "stabilization" of the alignments constructed by DIALIGN. Note that this result is
not self-evident: According to the two parts of the alignment problem, there can be two reasons for mis-alignments as detected by instabilities: (i) the employed
scoring function may itself be "unstable" (in which case it
can definitely not always be in accordance with biology),
and (ii) the optimization algorithm produces alignments
with scores significantly below the mathematical opti-

The paper is organized as follows: first, we shortly review
the two multi-alignment programs CLUSTAL W [35] and
DIALIGN [24,23] that we are using for our analysis. We
discuss some of their weak points that proved to be relevant in our context, and we indicate possible ways of overcoming them by incorporating expert knowledge. Next,
we apply CLUSTAL W and DIALIGN to a set of 22 ABC
transporter sequences and demonstrate that both algorithms lead to highly unstable phylogenetic trees. We
show that this instability is due to instabilities of the
underlying alignment procedures that are, in turn, caused
by sequence repeats. Following these observations, we
finally demonstrate that biologically meaningful alignments can be produced by both programs if additional
information regarding these repeats or other forms of
"expert knowledge" are incorporated into the alignment
procedure.

2 Alignment procedures
In our study, we investigated CLUSTAL W since it is still
the most popular software propgram for multi-alignment.
It is a classical implementation of the progressive alignment method. That is, it reduces the computational costs
of constructing a multiple alignment by reducing this task
to a sequence of pairwise alignments of profiles representing previously calculated multiple alignments of subsets
of the original sequence set. These pairwise alignments are
calculated according to the classical Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm [28] using a scoring scheme that sets rewards
for pairs of matching residues against penalties imposed
for gaps. Nowadays, there are more sophisticated progressive alignment methods available, for example MAFFT
[14,13] or MUSCLE [8,7]. Investigating the behaviour of
these program in detail would be beyond the scope of the
present study. Thus, we restrict ourselves to CLUSTAL as a
prototype of the progressive alignment methods.
A crucial question is, of course, to decide in which order
the pairwise alignments are computed in a progressive
approach. With default options, CLUSTALW calculates, in

⎛n⎞

a first step, all ⎜ ⎟ pairwise alignments for an input set of
⎝2⎠

n sequences, and constructs a guide tree for the input
sequences based on their pairwise similarity scores. To
this end, it uses the neighbor-joining algorithm [29]. The
"progressive" alignment procedure, i.e., the successive
alignment of sequences and/or profiles, is then carried out
according to the branching pattern of this guide tree.
While this method is computationally efficient, a major
point of concern is that the resulting multiple alignments
– and, therefore, any phylogenetic conclusions derived
from them – strongly depend on the guide tree. Clearly,
any instability of the guide tree will be reflected by corresponding instabilities of the resulting alignments – in particular in the slow-and-accurate mode in which also the
score function itself depends on that guide tree. Generally,
CLUSTAL W produces multiple alignments of high quality
if the sequences are globally related and the degree of overall similarity between them is sufficiently strong [36,16].
DIALIGN uses a completely different approach. The similarity between sequences is not measured by summing up,
over all sites, properly specified individual similarity
scores, but rather by comparing whole sequence segments
of equal length with each other. Alignments are composed
from gap-free segment pairs, so-called fragment alignments
or just fragments. Every possible fragment is given a score
based on the probability of its random occurrence [20],
and the algorithm tries to find a consistent collection of
fragments with maximal total score; consistency here
means the combinatorial requirement that the selected
fragments are required to fit into one single output alignment and do not 'cross' each other. Gaps are not penalized
in this approach – and there is, in consequence, no worrying about how to quantify gap penalties.
For pairwise alignment, the "best" chain of fragments is
found using an exact recursive optimization algorithm
[21,22]. For multi-alignments, all optimal pairwise alignments are constructed in a first step. Taking account of
their individual score, fragments occurring in these pairwise alignments are then incorporated one-by-one into a
growing multiple alignment in a greedy fashion, provided
they are consistent with the fragments that were included
previously. The nature of this approach can, of course,
lead to mis-alignments, in particular for sequences that
contain repeats. A single wrong fragment accepted at an
early stage of the greedy procedure can subsequently prevent many correct fragments from being included into the
alignment, thereby leading to an output alignment of
lower over-all quality and to instability. The order in
which the fragments from the optimal pairwise alignment
are checked for consistency and included into the multi-

ple alignment is therefore crucial for the resulting multiple alignment – somehow in analogy to (but slightly less
worrying than) the problems related to the choice of the
guide tree used by CLUSTAL W.
Note that CLUSTAL W and DIALIGN reflect very different
philosophies regarding the definition of scores: DIALIGN
uses a fixed scoring procedure whereas the scoring procedures used by CLUSTAL W depends -in the slow-and-accurate mode applied in our studies – on the guide tree used
for the computation of the alignment. Thus, to compare
two alignments of the same sequence set, one can compare their score if both are DIALIGN alignments whereas
this would not make sense if both are CLUSTAL W alignments (and even less if one is a DIALIGN and the other
one a CLUSTAL W alignment).
Two recently implemented options of DIALIGN were
used in this study:
• One way of influencing the output alignment is to prevent certain pairs of sequence sites, or whole gap-free
sequence segments, from being aligned with each other;
we implemented this exclude-fragment (or xfr) option to
improve the alignment of the ABC transporters in the
present study. The xfr option can be used to prevent early
inclusion of misleading fragments in the greedy alignment procedure outlined above, but also to explore interactively various alignment alternatives.
• The self-comparison (or sc) option was implemented to
search for repeats in a given sequence. To this end, a
sequence is aligned with itself in such a way that any single sequence entry can be aligned to any other entry except
itself.

3 Sequence data and definitions
3.1 Sequence data
In this study, all investigations of ABC transporters – or,
for short, ABCs – are based on the ATPase-domains of
ABC transporters. Their primary structure is characterized
by three highly conserved sequence motifs: two Walker
motifs called A and B that represent the ATP-decomposing
domains whereas the physiological function of a third
motif, the so-called signature sequence S, is still
unknown. In [31], these subsequences are characterized
as follows:

A : G x x G x G K [S, T], S : L S G G Q [Q, R, K] R, B : h h h
h D,
where x stands for an arbitrary, and h for an arbitrary
hydrophobic, amino acid. The order of these three motifs
is – at least for the sequences considered in this study -

-A–S–B-

For each subset X of X, let Alg( X ) denote the phylogeny

(from N- to C-terminus), with dashes representing arbitrary amino-acid sequences. Some of the ABCs comprise
two sets of these motifs, so their structure is

computed for X using the algorithm Alg. Then, Alg is
said to produce a stable phylogeny for X if
Σ safe ( Alg( X )) ⊆ X ∩ Σ( Alg( X )) and X ∩ Σ safe ( Alg( X )) ⊆ Σ( Alg( X ))

sm denote entries in TrEMBL, Swissprot http://
ca.expasy.org/, and in http://sequence.toulouse.inra.fr/
rhime/Complete/doc/Complete, respectively.
3.2 Some Definitions
Let X denote the set of all taxa under consideration, and
let T denote a phylogenetic tree – or, for short, a phylogeny
– for X. Then, each branch b of this tree induces a split S(b)
of X, i.e., a bipartition of X into two disjoint non-empty
subsets of X whose union is all of X while S(b) ≠ S(b')
holds for any two distinct branches b, b' of T (cf. e.g. [1]).
Thus, each phylogeny T with N branches b1, ..., bN gives
rise to a collection Σ(T): {S(bi) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N} of N distinct
splits of X that, in turn, are well known to determine T (up
to canonical isomorphism). Accordingly, if bootstrapping
frequencies f(b) have been computed for every branch b of
T, the set of all safe branches (i.e., of all branches b with a
bootstrapping frequencies f(b) at least 5/6) can be identified with the set of splits Σ safe(T): {S(bi) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N, f (bi) ≥
5/6}.

Two phylogenies T1 and T2 of X are said to be essentially
concordant if each one "contains" the safe branches of the
other, i.e., if
Σsafe(T1) ⊆ S(T2) and Σsafe(T2) ⊆ S(T1)

with#(X - X ) = 1) where, for every subset X of X and
every collection of Σ of splits of X, we denote by X ∩ Σ
the corresponding collection of splits of X defined by
X ∩ Σ := {{Y ∩ X , Z ∩ X} : {Y , Z} ∈ Σ, Y ∩ X , Z ∩ X ≠ ∅}.

4 Results
4.1 Molecular phylogenies
The sequence family as aligned using CLUSTAL Wand
DIALIGN. DIALIGN was used with default parameters
and CLUSTAL W was run with the slow-and-accurate
option. Subsequently, phylogenies were computed from
the alignments using the neighbor-joining algorithm with
the bootstrapping option of CLUSTAL W (1000 trials,
seed of 111). This resulted in two definitively distinct phylogenies depicted in Fig. 2 (T1 for CLUSTAL W and T2 for
DIALIGN).

To investigate the stability of these phylogenies, we also
computed phylogenies for the 22 "reduced" sequence
families i consisting of all sequences in except the
sequence Si (i = 1, ..., 22) in the same fashion. Each of
these phylogenies was essentially concordant with (the
restriction to the respective sequence sets of) one of the
trees shown in Fig. 2 and 3. More specifically, the CLUSTAL W alignments of 8, 10, and 22 led to Topology III trees
(cf. Fig. 3) whereas the CLUSTAL W alignments of all
other reduced sequence families led to Topology I trees.
The DIALIGN alignments resulted in Topology III trees for
5 and 22, Topology IV trees for 1, 8, 20, and 21, and Topology
II trees for all other reduced sequence families. Hence,
CLUSTAL W and DIALIGN produced not only definitively
distinct, but also highly unstable phylogenies for our
sequence families.

(3.1)

holds. Otherwise, T1 and T2 are called definitively distinct.
Let us now assume that we are given
• a collection X of (phylogenetically related) sequences
and
• an algorithm Alg for computing phylogenies from
sequences.

4.2 Underlying alignments
To investigate the reasons for the occurrence of these
rather distinct tree topologies, we analysed the underlying
alignments. In doing so, we classified these alignments by
the relative positions of the motifs A, S, and B. This classification led to the 5 alignment classes 1a, 1b, 2, 3, and 4
shown in Fig. 4 one of which, class 1a, was observed only
once, viz., for 14. Among these alignments, alignments in
class 3 look biologically most meaningful since it implies
only one duplication event. By contrast, alignment in
class 1a, 1b, 2 and 4 would require at least two independ-

ent duplication or deletion events. A meaningful alternative, namely alignments of class 5, did occur only after
applying the xfr option of DIALIGN for excluding class-3
type alignments.
Next, we found that alignments of class 1a and 1b always
led to Topology I trees. Analogously, alignments in the
classes 2, 3, and 4 always yielded Topology II, III, and IV
trees, respectively. This showed clearly that the instabilities and inconsistencies of the safe branches can be traced
back to the underlying alignments.
4.3 Modified alignments
In this subsection, we discuss which of the 5 alignment
classes have the best DIALIGN score. To compute DIALIGN scores for all alignment classes, the xfr option
described in 2 was used: We excluded the possibility of

aligning the subwords S1 and B1 of S22 with subwords of
any of the other sequences aligned with these subwords in
the class-2 or class-4 alignments. This led, for all 23
sequence sets , 1, ..., 22, to alignments of class 3. Moreover,
the scores of these class-3 alignments (7933–9367) were
between 140 and 559 "DIALIGN units" higher than the
scores of the corresponding class-2 or class-4 alignments.
In view of the fact that the DIALIGN scores are computed
in terms of the logarithm of probabilities [24], these differences are quite substantial.
Analogously, the xfr option of DIALIGN was used to
exclude all fragments of class-2 and class-4 alignments
that involve the subwords S2 or B2 of the sequences S20 or
S21. As expected, this led to an alignment of class 5 (cf.
Fig. 4) whose score 9230 was 137 "DIALIGN units"
smaller than the score of the corresponding class-3 align-

ment. So, class-5 alignments appear to represent suboptimal alignments with respect to the DIALIGN score.
To investigate the influence of the guide tree on CLUSTAL
W alignments, we proceeded as follows: As mentioned
above, the CLUSTAL W alignment of 10 led to an alignment of class 3. In the guide tree of this alignment, we systematically replaced, quite crudely, Si by S10 and used
this new guide tree for a CLUSTAL W alignment of i.
In each case, this resulted in an alignment of class 3. This
is quite surprising since the two guide trees leading to
these rather different alignments, do not look too different. In Fig. 5, 10 out of 20 internal nodes are identical for
both trees i.e. the corresponding sub-clades coincide precisely. In particular, all guide trees include a branch with
taxa S16–S19, i.e., the problematic sequences in the alignments of class 1a and 1b (cf. Fig. 4). Thus, our investigations demonstrate that small modifications of the guide

tree can change the alignment significantly and that inappropriate guide trees can result in biologically unacceptable alignments. It is worth noting that all alignments of
class 3 or 5 led to Topology III trees.
4.4 Decomposition in N- and C-termini
Our analyses showed that one reason for the observed
instabilities is the repetitive structure of the last three
sequences S20–22. Accordingly, we constructed two
sequences out of each of these three sequences, each new
sequence containing a single -A – S – B- motif. To this end,
we aligned each of these three sequences to itself by applying the sc option of DIALIGN to identify, and later to
excise either one of, their repeats. This way, we created a
new sequence family ' consisting of sequences S1 – S19

ifications alignment algorithms, sequence duplications can lead to serious mis-alignments and to instabilities under minor modFor most alignment algorithms, sequence duplications can lead to serious mis-alignments and to instabilities
under minor modifications of the input sequence sets. For our original sequence set = {S1, ..., S22} and the 'reduced'
sequence sets i := \{Si}, we obtained six classes of multi-alignments. Here, class 3 and 5 seem to be the only types of alignments
that are biologically meaningful. Alignments of class 5 were obtained only once, namely by DIALIGN using the xfr option as
described in 2 and 4.3. We used this option to prevent the program from aligning the motifs A2, S2 and B2 in the sequences S20
– S22 to the motifs A, S and B in the remaining sequences.

We investigated the phylogenies and alignments for the
new sequence set in the same fashion as for the original
sequence family. Fig. 6 shows the phylogenies derived
from the CLUSTAL W resp. DIALIGN alignment. While
the latter produced a perfectly stable phylogeny, CLUSTAL
W produced only an "almost stable" phylogeny – only the
branch corresponding to the split of ' into {S3, S16, S17,
S18, S19} and its complement was found to be safe, yet it
did not occur in any tree constructed for a proper subset
of '.
The DIALIGN alignment was also shown to be stable (see
Fig. 7) whereas a variety of different alignment classes
showed up in the CLUSTAL W alignments, one example
being also shown in Fig. 7. But there was one common
feature of the CLUSTAL W alignments: The A, S, and B
motifs of S16 – S19 were never aligned to the corresponding motifs of the other sequences.
Note that the restrictions of all CLUSTAL W and DIALIGN
alignments to the sequences S1–S19 coincide, respectively, with the corresponding restrictions of the align-

ments of class 1 or class 3 (see Fig. 4). Thus, it is no
surprise that the restrictions of the trees of ' to the taxa S1
to S19 also coincide with the corresponding restrictions of
the Topology I (CLUSTAL W) and Topology III (DIALIGN) trees shown in Fig. 2 and 3.
This demonstrates that the two different approaches
towards improving the DIALIGN alignment, namely the
exclusion of fragments and the decomposition of the
repetitive sequences in N- and C-termini, do not lead to
contradictory trees.
Furthermore, these analyses of the CLUSTAL W alignments and the trees derived from them explain in particular the stability of the branch containing the four taxa S16
to S19. And they show that not all the problems concerning the CLUSTALW alignments of the ABCs are caused by
repeats. Additionally, we analyzed the alignments and the
trees of the sequence set '': = {S1, ..., S19}: Again DIALIGN produced a stable alignment and a stable phylogeny
that coincided with the restriction of a class-3 alignment
and a Topology III tree to this subset, respectively, while

the alignment as well as the phylogeny produced by
CLUSTAL W still turned out to be unstable: The tree produced by CLUSTAL W for '' coincides with the restriction
of the tree derived for '. But the sequence set consisting of
S1–S6 and S8–S19, for example, leads to an alignment of
class 3 and a Topology III tree.
4.5 Relation between branches and function
So far, we emphasized differences between tree topologies
and the problems concerning their stability. In this section, we discuss which branches all our trees have in common and whether they are related to the physiological
functions of the ABCs.

All six tree topologies separate the following sequence
clusters from the remaining sequences (often by safe
branches): {S1, S10}, {S2, S4}, {S5, S6}, {S9, S11}, {S8,
S13, S20, S21, S22}, {S8, S20, S21, S22}, {S20, S22}.

Furthermore, replacing each of the sequences S20, S21,
S22 by the corresponding N- and C-terminal sequences
S20N, S21N, S22N and S20C, S21C, S22C, the same
holds for the two trees constructed for ' which, in addition, separate {S8, S20N, S21N, S22N} suggesting a a
slower evolution of the N-terminal motifs of the
sequences S20, S21, S22 compared with the evolution of
the C-terminal motifs of these sequences.
The splits mentioned above are related to the physiological function of the ABCs: S1 and S10 are iron transporters
of Streptomyces coelicolor (S1) and E. coli (S10), S2 and S4
are related to the daunorubizin resistance of Streptomyces
peucetius (S2) and Rhizobium leguminosum (S4), S9 and
S11 transport amino acids in E. coli and S5 and S6 are
ABCs from the MURA-RPON intergenic region of E. coli
and from the NTRA/RPON 5' region of Rhizobium meliloti.
Finally, S13 is a phosphonates transporter of E. coli,
whereas S8, S20, S21, and S22 are transporter of peptides:

copy of the – A – S – B – motif than of their C-terminus
copy. These parts of the sequences apparently were
allowed to adapt to the new function more freely, suggesting that, after all, the class-5 alignments might, in spite of
their lower DIALIGN score, be more appropriate than the
class-3 alignments.

5 Summary and discussion
Phylogenetic tree reconstruction from sequence data can
be a very difficult task that involves two major subproblems, namely (a) to construct a multiple alignment of the
input sequences in such a way that biologically related
parts of these sequences are assigned to each other and (b)
to construct a phylogenetic tree based on such an alignment. If these subtasks are to be solved algorithmically,
two types of questions are to be addressed: suitable scoring
functions need to be defined assigning quantitative confidence scores to each possible multi-alignment or phylogenetic tree, respectively. These scoring functions should be
defined in such a way that biologically reasonable alignments or trees are more likely to receiving higher scores
than biologically meaningless ones. Given such a scoring
scheme, the second problem is an optimization problem,
namely to find alignments or trees, respectively, with optimal (or near-optimal) scores. Thus, phylogenetic tree
reconstruction can be affected by two different types of
errors. One kind of error reflects modeling problems such
as unsuitable definitions of alignment scores or (dis)similarities for tree reconstruction. The other kind of errors
are due to problems with finding the optimal alignment
for a fixed alignment score and the optimal tree for a fixed
(dis)similarity matrix. Both errors can, of course, produce
instable alignments and phylogenies.
In this study, we restricted our attention to so-called safe
branches of the phylogenies under investigation, i.e. to
branches with bootstrap values above some threshold
value. In view of their rather restrictive definition, it was
natural to guess that that instabilities of safe branches
indicate instabilities of the underlying alignments. And,
indeed, we could relate distinct types of tree topologies to
distinct alignment classes which were defined in terms of
the relative position of the – A – S – B – motifs. Obviously, the threshold value of 5/6 that we used in our definition of safe branches is somewhat arbitrary. But, for the
sequence set considered in this study, it worked well: the
different types of tree topologies that we observed could
be related to distinct classes of sequence alignments. For
smaller threshold values, it is quite likely that more safe
branches will lead to more tree-topology types demanding the consideration of more subtle differences between
the corresponding alignments.

http://www.almob.org/content/3/1/15

Furthermore, we could show that preventing certain pairs
of sequence sites, or whole gap-free sequence segments,
from being incorporated into a DIALIGN alignment by
using the xfr option, resulted in the perfectly stable and
biologically meaningful class-3 alignment which, in addition, had always a higher score than the other alignments.
It is worth noting that this is no proof that the class-3
alignment represents the optimal alignment of our
sequence set with respect to the DIALIGN score – there
could be distinct alignments with even higher scores – and
even less that it is the "biologically correct" alignment. But
it allowed us to avoid alignments that are obviously suboptimal, and we could show that these class-3 alignments
produce stable tree topologies. For lack of appropriate
scoring parameters, a similar analysis could not be performed for CLUSTAL W. But we could demonstrate that
small variations of the guide tree can result in rather different alignments and definitively distinct tree topologies.
This might be a good explanation for the instabilities produced by CLUSTAL W for our sequence set.
The principal reason for the observed instabilities is probably the repetitive structure of some of the sequences
under consideration. It is well known that repeats cause
serious problems for all alignment algorithms [12]. Here,
both subtasks in sequence alignment are concerned: it is
possible that, due to repeats, biologically meaningful
alignments receive lower scores than alternative, yet biologically unreasonable alignments. In addition, repeats
can prevent optimization algorithms from finding (near)optimal alignments. Both types of errors have been
observed, for example, for the hox-gene cluster, see [26]
for more details.
In this study, we obtained stable tree topologies after constructing new repeat-free sequences from our sequences
using the sc option of DIALIGN. Using these new
sequences, DIALIGN produced stable alignments whereas
CLUSTAL W still produced unstable alignments, yet essentially stable phylogenies. An explanation for this observation (that unstable alignments can result in stable
phylogenies) is perhaps that the threshold value 5/6 in the
definition of safe branches is too high to reflect instabilities of the trees. Hence, in this case, one should actually
use a lower threshold value, redo all analyses, and check
whether such a refinement allows to find instabilities of
the trees and to trace them back to the observed alignment
instabilities. In our study, only a small set of ABCs was
analysed. But, as will be shown in a forthcoming article
(H. Wagner and N. Diaz, in preparation), analogous analyses are also required in the phylogenetic investigation of
larger sets of ABCs – in particular, since quite a few ABCs
have repetitive structure. Note that complete ABCs are
composed of three kinds of domains, the ATPases, the
transmembrane domains, and the periplasmatic binding

Page 11 of 13

Algorithms for Molecular Biology 2008, 3:15

domain. In the present study, we only considered repeats
within the ATPases (see Section 3.1), but repeats can also
occur in other domains.
Note that the requirement of stability is only a necessary
but not a sufficient condition for the reliability of the output of an alignment or tree-reconstruction program. It
does not guarantee its "correctness", and the same holds,
of course, for score-optimal results: Even if one could
show that a certain alignment has optimal score, that
would not imply that it is also biologically correct since
the underlying scoring function may assign optimal
numerical scores to biologically wrong alignments. In general, a (near-)optimal alignment score only implies that
the corresponding alignment might be a noteworthy
approximation to biological reality. In fact, it is not possible to define scoring functions for sequence alignment in
such a way that score-optimal alignments necessarily coincide with biologically correct ones. For real-world
sequences, common ancestry and common function and
structure do not always correspond to similarity at the primary-sequence level. This is a fundamental limitation for
all automated alignment approaches. To overcome these
limitations, semi-automatic alignment methods have been
proposed where expert knowledge can be used to guide
the alignment procedure. The exclude fragments (xfr)
option introduced in this article offers one way to support
such semi-automatic approaches. An even stronger option
is the previously introduced anchored alignment option
where the program is forced to align certain user-defined
parts of the sequences to each other, see for example [27].
Stability analysis in phylogenetic studies is helpful to
learn in more detail which alignments and (dis)similarities may be better descriptions of various aspects of
sequence evolution. E.g., if phylogenetic analyses with different tools consistently lead to the same stable results,
then there is at least a good chance that these results reflect
the correct branching pattern of the evolution of the
sequences under consideration. For similar reasons, we
recently introduced a tool that compares distinct multialignments of the same sequence data set [25]. Such coincidences between safe branches of different trees were
investigated in Section 4.5. These safe branches were
shown to separate ABCs with identical function from the
rest where the function of an ABC was defined by the
transported substrate. Thus, it can be assumed that such
branches of phylogenetic trees can indeed be used for
functional predictions as discussed in the introduction.
Note that, in our analyses, ABCs from different organisms
with identical functions were grouped together, but not
ABCs from the same organism with different functions. As
noted already in [30], this suggests that the segregation of
the ABCs according to their function is older than their

http://www.almob.org/content/3/1/15

segregation according to the evolution of their respective
organisms. Additionally or alternatively, horizontal gene
transfer – well established in the bacterial world – could
also contribute to this phenomenon.
From our analyses, we may also postulate that the phosphonate transporters and the dipeptide and oligopeptides
transporters have a common ancestor; yet, in contrast to
the dipeptide transporters, the oligopepetide transporters
have a repetitive structure. However, the data set here is
too small to unravel their history in detail. In a forthcoming article, these aspects of sequence evolution will be
considered in more detail (Wagner and Diaz, in preparation).
