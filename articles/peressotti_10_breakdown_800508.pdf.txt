Abstract
Background: Natural disease resistance is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly way of controlling plant
disease. Breeding programmes need to make sure that the resistance deployed is effective and durable. Grapevine
downy mildew, caused by the Oomycete Plasmopara viticola, affects viticulture and it is controlled with pesticides.
Downy mildew resistant grapevine varieties are a promising strategy to control the disease, but their use is
currently restricted to very limited acreages. The arising of resistance-breaking isolates under such restricted
deployment of resistant varieties would provide valuable information to design breeding strategies for the
deployment of resistance genes over large acreages whilst reducing the risks of the resistance being defeated. The
observation of heavy downy mildew symptoms on a plant of the resistant variety Bianca, whose resistance is
conferred by a major gene, provided us with a putative example of emergence of a resistance-breaking isolate in
the interaction between grapevine and P. viticola.
Results: In this paper we describe the emergence of a P. viticola isolate (isolate SL) that specifically overcomes
Rpv3, the major resistance gene carried by Bianca at chromosome 18. We show that isolate SL has the same
behaviour as two P. viticola isolates avirulent on Bianca (isolates SC and SU) when inoculated on susceptible plants
or on resistant plants carrying resistances derived from other sources, suggesting there is no fitness cost associated
to the virulence. Molecular analysis shows that all three isolates are genetically closely related.
Conclusions: Our results are the first description of a resistance-breaking isolate in the grapevine/P. viticola
interaction, and show that, despite the reduced genetic variability of P. viticola in Europe compared to its basin of
origin and the restricted use of natural resistance in European viticulture, resistance-breaking isolates overcoming
monogenic resistances may arise even in cases where deployment of the resistant varieties is limited to small
acreages. Our findings represent a warning call for the use of resistant varieties and an incentive to design
breeding programmes aiming to optimize durability of the resistances.

Background
Natural disease resistance is a cost-effective and environment friendly way of controlling plant disease. Breeding programmes aiming to obtain disease resistant
varieties have been developed for most plants of economical interest. An important challenge of breeding for
disease resistance is durability. Plant disease resistance is
defined as durable when it “remains effective during its
prolonged and widespread use in an environment

favourable to disease” [1]. The extent to which achieving
durable resistance is difficult is highlighted by the fact
that most varieties deployed possessing monogenic resistance had been rapidly overcome because of changes in
pathogen populations [2,3] (and references therein). As
an illustration, [4] lists over 267 resistance genes from
14 pathosystems that proved not to be durable when
used as single genes. The durability of the resistance
may be improved, among other strategies, by the use of
varietal mixtures [5-7] or by pyramiding genes [3]. In
any case, a sound knowledge of the biological and
genetic components of the pathosystem is important to

design the most appropriate strategy for deployment of
the different resistance genes [3].
Grapevine (Vitis vinifera, L) is cultivated worldwide
mainly for the production of wine, juice, fresh fruit and
raisins and thus plays a pivotal role in the economy of
many countries. Viticulture is threatened by numerous
pathogens. The Oomycete Plasmopara viticola, causal
agent of grapevine downy mildew, is an obligate biotrophe that was introduced in Europe in the 1870s,
probably with the importation of American rootstocks
resistant to Phylloxera used for grafting the susceptible
European vines [8]. Since then, grapevine downy mildew
has expanded all over Europe and it is currently present
in wine growing areas worldwide. The current strategy
to control the disease in Europe relies on the massive
use of pesticides. The systematic use of chemical products not only adds heavy costs to grapevine production
but also has an adverse impact on environment as well
as negative effects on human health. Thus, the search
for alternative methods to control grapevine downy mildew is of paramount importance for viticulture.
The use of grapevine varieties showing durable resistance to downy mildew is a promising strategy to control
the disease [9]. However, since all V. vinifera cultivars are
susceptible to P. viticola, the resistance needs to be introduced from other Vitis species through breeding programmes that ensure also the maintenance of important
agronomic characteristics. Several species from the genus
Vitis, as well as the closely related species Muscadinia
rotundifolia, have been described as partially or totally
resistant to P. viticola [10-14]. Breeding programmes for
resistance to grapevine pathogens have resulted in the
creation of varieties that are currently grown on limited
acreages, such as Regent and Solaris [15]. In parallel, the
last few years have witnessed progress in the characterisation of the genetic basis of the resistance derived from
several sources: two QTLs (Quantitative Trait Loci),
named Rpv1 and Rpv2 and located respectively in chromosomes 12 and 18 were found to be responsible for the
resistance derived from M. rotundifolia [16] (Wiedemann-Merdinoglu unpublished); two QTLs located in
chromosomes 9 and 12 were found to be responsible for
the resistance derived from Vitis riparia [17,18]; two
QTLs located in chromosomes 4 and 18 were found to
be responsible for the resistance derived from the variety
Regent [19]; a major QTL, named Rpv3 and located in
chromosome 18 is responsible for the resistance derived
from the variety Bianca [20].
The concept of durability is especially important in
“perennial” species like grapevine, which are meant to
stay in the field for at least thirty years. Breeding programmes need to make sure that the resistance
employed not only is effective, but also persists in time,
despite the constant evolution of pathogens. In this

context, knowledge of the genetic variability as well as
evolutionary potential of the pathogen is important to
design efficient breeding strategies. Even though our
understanding of the genetic basis of grapevine downy
mildew resistance has greatly progressed, nothing yet is
known about the ability of P. viticola to overcome such
resistances. Downy mildew isolates growing on the resistant hybrids Regent and Johanniter have been reported,
but those were either highly aggressive isolates or common isolates benefiting of optimal environmental conditions [21]. The lack of information about resistancebreaking isolates is mainly due to the restricted use of
resistant varieties in Europe, where most of the winegrowing surfaces are occupied by the susceptible V. vinifera. Hopefully, the limited deployment of resistances
together with the bottleneck effect associated with the
introduction of P. viticola in Europe [22] will restrict its
potential to overcome the resistances found in the Vitaceae. Under this scenario, finding P. viticola resistancebreaking isolates would provide important information
to design strategies for deploying resistance genes in larger surfaces whilst minimizing the risks of the resistance
being defeated and thus optimizing durability. In fact,
identifying P. viticola resistance-breaking isolates would
provide us with a first indication of the potential of P.
viticola to evolve virulent isolates in Europe, an information that should be integrated in breeding programmes.
Furthermore, the identification of virulent isolates is the
first step towards the identification of the cognate avirulence genes. Knowledge on the variability of avirulence
genes, coupled with the fitness cost associated to virulence would help in choosing the combinations of genes
most likely to confer durable resistance [23,24].
Grapevine cultivar Bianca is a hybrid between Villard
Blanc and Bouvier, obtained in Hungary [25]. Bianca is
mainly cultivated in Hungary (884 ha in 2001, [26]) and
also in Russia, Moldova and to lesser extent in some
regions of North America. It shows good resistance
both to downy and powdery mildew and a very good
tolerance to frost. Recently a major QTL, named Rpv3,
has been found to account for Bianca’s partial resistance
to downy mildew [20]. Rpv3 causes a reduction of
pathogen development and reacts to P. viticola contact
with a hypersensitive reaction, leading to cell death in
the proximity of infection sites. Rpv3 maps to the chromosome 18, into a cluster of disease resistance genes. In
2005, heavy downy mildew infection of Bianca was
observed in an experimental station in the Czech
Republic. This observation led us to address the following questions: is the downy mildew isolate growing
in Bianca a resistance-breaking isolate or a highly
aggressive isolate? If we are in the presence of a resistance-breaking isolate, which is the cost for P. viticola
to overcome the Rpv3-mediated resistance?

In this paper we describe the characterisation of a
P. viticola isolate that specifically overcomes the resistance from the grapevine cultivar Bianca. We show that
its growth in plants carrying Bianca-derived resistance is
the same as in susceptible plants. We also show that,
when inoculated on susceptible plants or on plants carrying resistances other than that derived from Bianca,
P. viticola isolated from Bianca behaves similarly to two
other isolates avirulent on Bianca. Accordingly, molecular characterisation and phylogenetic analysis show all
three isolates as being closely related. Finally, QTL mapping using this isolate results in the disappearance of
the Rpv3 QTL on chromosome 18. The characterisation
of this downy mildew isolate as an Rpv3 resistancebreaking isolate, as opposed to being a particularly
aggressive isolate, has important implications for the
creation and deployment of resistant varieties in
viticulture.

Results
Identification of a P. viticola isolate showing vigorous
growth on the resistant variety Bianca

Downy mildew symptoms were observed on the resistant variety Bianca in 2005 in a grapevine experimental
station in Lednice (Czech Republic). This aroused suspicion that a new and more aggressive P. viticola isolate
could have evolved. Oil spots from Bianca natural infection were collected for comparison with other isolates
used for laboratory infections in France (INRA Colmar)
and Italy (Udine University). We have named these
isolates SL (Czech isolate), SC (French isolate) and SU
(Italian isolate), according to their geographical origin.
To investigate possible differences in these three isolates a preliminary test was conducted infecting leaf
discs from Bianca and the susceptible grapevine variety
Chardonnay as control. Infection progress was visually
observed three to six days post inoculation (dpi).
Bianca has been reported to react to P. viticola contact
with a hypersensitive reaction (HR) leading to cell
death in the proximity of infection sites, which constitutes a common phenotype strictly associated with
resistant genotypes [20]. After inoculation with the
three isolates, HR in the form of necrotic spots was
clearly visible to the naked eye from 3 dpi on Bianca
leaf discs inoculated with SC and SU, but not with SL
(Figure 1). As expected, no necrotic spots appeared in
Chardonnay discs. Sporulation of isolates SC and SU
was restricted in Bianca leaf discs compared to Chardonnay leaf discs, while sporulation of SL was similar
on both genotypes (Figure 1). This observation,
together with the absence of any necrotic tissue associated to the pathogen on Bianca leaf discs infected
with SL, suggests that the resistance from Bianca is
not effective against the isolate SL.

P. viticola isolate SL overcomes the resistance QTL from
Bianca

Next we addressed whether the ability of SL to grow on
Bianca was due to SL overcoming Rpv3. Based on the
presence or absence of the Rpv3 locus, we selected three
susceptible (18102, 18110, 18124) and three resistant
genotypes (18013, 18031, 18093) from a Chardonnay ×
Bianca population segregating for resistance to downy
mildew. All six individuals, along with the parents, were
inoculated with the P. viticola isolates SL, SC and SU.
Observation of HR four days post infection revealed no
significant presence of necrotic tissue in susceptible
plants, while resistant plants developed clear necrotic
spots when infected with isolates SC and SU, but not
with SL (Figure 2A). Sporulation at 4 and 6 dpi on resistant genotypes infected with isolate SL appeared more
abundant than in inoculation with SC and SU (Figure
2A, B). A quantitative evaluation of sporulation was
obtained at 6 dpi, when spore concentration was measured using a cell counter. Results are visualized in Figure 2C, which strongly suggests a different behaviour of
the SL isolate only on resistant plants. This observation
was confirmed by analysis of variance, which showed
significant differences in spore concentration among isolates as well as significant interaction between genotype
and strain, suggesting lack of uniform behaviour
between genotypes (Table 1). A second analysis of variance was conducted after separating genotypes based
on presence or absence of the Rpv3 locus. No significant
differences in sporulation were found between isolates
on plants lacking Rpv3 locus. On the other hand, highly
significant differences in sporulation between isolates
could be observed in plants carrying the Rpv3 locus (P <
0.001) (Table 1). Hence, a pairwise comparison of the
different pathogen isolates was performed through a
Tukey’s HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) test.
According to test results there is no distinction between
SC and SU, but both of them differ significantly from

SL (P < 0.001) (Table 2). These results suggest that isolate SL is able to overcome the resistance conferred by
the Rpv3 locus.
Specificity of the Bianca-SL interaction

Since Rpv3 allows P. viticola sporulation, it remains
possible that the phenotype observed with SL was the
consequence of this isolate being particularly aggressive rather than an Rpv3 resistance-breaking isolate.
Higher aggressiveness of the SL isolate would result in
higher sporulation, compared to the other isolates, in
different genetic backgrounds. On the contrary, in the
case of resistance-breaking by SL the difference in
growth should be observed only in plants carrying
Rpv3. To rule out the possibility that strong sporulation by SL on the resistant genotypes was due to a
general higher aggressiveness of this isolate and to
assess the specificity of the interaction, a set of control
plants whose reaction to downy mildew has been well
documented was infected with isolates SL, SU and SC.
Plants analysed included the Vitis vinifera susceptible
variety Muscat Ottonel and genotypes whose resistance to downy mildew has been already documented,
as Vitis riparia (highly resistant) and Vitis rupestris
(moderately resistant). Furthermore, we included individuals (7054H, 7042H, 7050H, 0125G) selected from

(total resistance): 7042H and 0125G carry Rpv1,
7050H carries Rpv2 and 7054H does not have any of
them. A survey of necrotic lesions showed homogeneity among isolates: all resistant genotypes developed
an evident HR reaction, including plants infected with
SL (Figure 3A). Quantitative assessment of spore concentration for each genotype at 6 dpi showed no
important differences among isolates (Figure 3B, C).
These results show that SL is not an especially aggressive isolate of P. viticola, but rather that it specifically
overcomes the resistance carried by Bianca at the
Rpv3 locus and can thus be considered an Rpv3 resistance-breaking isolate.
QTL mapping using isolate SL

To strengthen the hypothesis of the evolution of a resistance-breaking downy mildew isolate, an infection was
conducted in parallel with SU and SL isolates on 38
genotypes of the Chardonnay × Bianca progeny. Parameters of presence/absence of necrotic spots and spore
concentration were exploited to construct a draft QTL
map for comparison between the two isolates. No
necrotic spots ever appeared in interactions involving
SL, suggesting a lack of plant defence reaction against
this particular isolate. QTL analysis was performed on
final spore concentration data collected at 6 dpi. Interval
mapping on data from plants infected with isolate SU
confirmed the presence of a major QTL close to the
terminal part of chromosome 18, which explains up to
80% of the phenotypic variance (Figure 4A). At the
same time interval mapping conducted on the sample
infected with isolate SL did not detect the expected
QTL on chromosome 18 (Figure 4B). The QTL obtained

different European countries (mainly France, Italy,
Czech Republic). The 21 P. viticola isolates analysed all
presented a distinct multi-locus genotype. A NJ (Neighbour-Joining) tree (Figure 5) showed no clear clustering
of isolates based on their geographical origin. The isolates SU, SC and SL clustered closely to each other and
to other European isolates. These results show that SL
isolate is not from foreign origin but it belongs to the
European gene pool of P. viticola isolates.

Discussion
In this paper we report the detection and characterisation of a P. viticola resistance-breaking isolate (SL)
growing specifically on the resistant grapevine hybrid
Bianca. We demonstrated that SL behaviour on Bianca
and its resistant progeny is significantly different from
two other European isolates (SC and SU). On plants
carrying Bianca resistance, the SL isolate fails to trigger
a hypersensitive reaction and its sporulation level is
comparable to that observed on susceptible plants. This
first result suggests that isolate SL may have evolved to
overcome Bianca resistance, which is controlled by a
major QTL, named Rpv3, in the terminal part of chromosome 18 [20]. The specificity of the interaction
between isolate SL and Bianca was further evidenced by
experiments performed on a panel of control plants carrying resistances derived from other sources. In this
assay, the three isolates exhibited the same phenotype,
i.e. abundant sporulation on all susceptible genotypes
and minor sporulation accompanied by the presence of

with SU infection peaked at 77.86 cM with a LOD score
of 13.25 (R2 = 81.5), while the same position on infection with SL corresponded to a LOD score of 0.17 (R2 =
2.1). For SL, the maximum LOD score obtained in chromosome 18 was 0.95 at 25.883 cM. This result reinforces our hypothesis of a specific relationship between
SL downy mildew isolate and Bianca inherited resistance
mechanism.
Genetic relationships between P. viticola isolates

genetic relationship between the three isolates and an
additional set of 18 P. viticola isolates collected in

necrotic spots on all downy mildew resistant genotypes.
Finally, QTL analysis performed in parallel with SL and
SU isolates on 38 individuals of the Chardonnay ×
Bianca progeny confirmed the presence of a strong QTL
on chromosome 18 in plants infected with isolate SU,
while no QTL could be detected with the SL isolate.
Altogether these observations highlight that SL represents a novel P. viticola resistance-breaking isolate specifically adapted to overcome the resistance controlled by
the Rpv3 locus.
To our knowledge, this is the first example of P. viticola overcoming a resistance gene in the grapevine/
downy mildew interaction. Previous reports have
described P. viticola isolates growing on resistant
hybrids such as Regent or Johanniter [21] and the
authors explained the findings either by adaptation to
the host or extreme fitness of the isolates. In the work
described here, however, SL showed the same fitness as
the other two isolates in all genotypes lacking the resistance QTL from Bianca, thus discarding the possibility
of SL being a more aggressive isolate.
Resistance to plant pathogens follows the gene-forgene model, where the presence of a resistance gene (R)
in the plant and its corresponding avirulence (Avr) gene
in the pathogen leads to the activation of plant defence
and consequently to resistance (often associated with a
hypersensitive response, HR). The most common class
of plant R genes codes for proteins containing a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRR).
Rpv3 maps to a cluster of NBS-LRR genes, suggesting
that an NBS-LRR protein could be responsible for the
resistance derived from Bianca [20]. Further supporting
the hypothesis of an R-Avr interaction, Rpv3-derived
resistance to SC and SU is associated with the presence
of an HR. Thus, the inability of the SL isolate to trigger
an HR on Rpv3-bearing plants suggests that isolate SL is
no longer recognised by the Rpv3 locus. Because the
R-Avr interaction is highly specific, a mutation in the
Avr gene may be sufficient to avoid the activation of
plant defence. Therefore, it seems likely that the emergence of the SL isolate that avoids R gene detection is
caused by a change in the Avr gene corresponding to
the Rpv3 locus.
There is a growing body of evidence that pathogen
Avr genes code for effectors that whilst enabling host
colonization act as a tell tale of pathogen presence and
activate plant defence when recognised by the matching
R genes. In a pathogen population, when an individual
evolves a mutation in an effector that enables it to
escape R gene detection, or looses the effector, it is
expected that the new pathogen race will be in advantage in the presence of that R gene. At the same time,
this change may impair the primary virulence function
of the effector and so the new race may loose fitness on

Page 8 of 11

susceptible plants or in the presence of other kinds of
resistances [27-30]. Our experiments did not reveal any
relevant difference in behaviour between SL and the
other two P. viticola isolates neither on susceptible
plants of the Chardonnay × Bianca progeny nor on
other genotypes lacking the Rpv3 locus. Hence, it may
be concluded that the ability of isolate SL to grow on
Bianca does not impair the pathogen fitness on genotypes lacking Bianca QTL for downy mildew resistance.
As there is no apparent fitness cost in SL it is plausible
to assume that the putative mutation causing virulence
on Bianca is not affecting the effector function. Alternatively, the effector function might be redundant, which
would also explain the absence of fitness cost in the
case of the effector being lost. In fact the presence of
many paralogues coding for effectors in Oomycete genomes support the idea of a possible functional redundancy [23,31].

Conclusions
The use of natural resistance is a sustainable alternative
to the intensive use of pesticides to fight grapevine diseases. In a strategy of breeding for disease resistance in
grapevine, durability constitutes a major challenge,
because plants are meant to remain in the field for tens
of years. The resistance present in Bianca is mainly due
to the effect of a single locus, and it is well documented
from other cultivated species that the deployment of
monogenic resistances leads in most cases to the arising
of resistance-breaking strains [4]. Until now, there were
no reports of P. viticola resistance-breaking isolates.
P. viticola was introduced from North America at the
end of the XIXth century, and as a consequence of the
bottleneck caused by its recent introduction, the genetic
variability of European populations is limited as compared to its North American counterparts [22]. Notwithstanding, previous genetic studies [32,33] have
highlighted that, in Europe, P. viticola populations
undergo recurrent sexual recombination and have high
effective population size. Following the flexible framework of McDonald and Linde [3], P. viticola in Europe
could thus be seen as a pathogen species presenting a
medium risk of overcoming grapevine resistance genes.
The results of this study confirm the prediction that,
despite its reduced genetic variability compared to
native american populations and the absence of selection pressure in the form of resistant varieties, P. viticola
resistance-breaking isolates may indeed arise in Europe.
The evolutionary potential of P. viticola was already
reported in the occurrence of single resistant-associated
mutations leading to multiple appearances of QoI fungicide resistance alleles in different French vineyards [22].
However, the selective pressures may not be comparable
because fungicides are systematically used to control

downy mildew in the field, while the cultivar Bianca is
grown in a very limited area. Thus, our results are all
the more important as they show that European populations of P. viticola may give rise to the emergence of
new isolates overcoming monogenic resistances even at
the scale of a local population with no apparent fitness
cost for the virulent isolate. In a crop-pathogen system
where deployment of resistant varieties is in its early
days, our findings represent an alert and an incentive to
pursue breeding strategies designed to perform knowledge-based pyramiding of different resistance genes in
grapevine [23,24] while selecting appropriate genetic
backgrounds that will contribute to increase the durability of the resistance [34].

Methods
Plant material

Genotypes used in this study included 38 individuals
from a Chardonnay × Bianca pseudo test cross [20] and
a set of diverse grapevine genotypes. This last set
included commonly cultivated Vitis vinifera susceptible
varieties (Muscat Ottonel), genotypes whose resistance
have been already documented (Vitis riparia, Vitis
rupestris) and individuals (7054H, 7042H, 7050H,
0125G) selected from crosses segregating for Muscadinia rotundifolia resistance genes [16] (WiedemannMerdinoglu, unpublished).
Pathogen isolates

Three different Plasmopara viticola isolates used in this
work were collected from natural infections. Isolate SU
was collected from V. vinifera Chardonnay at the experimental field of University of Udine (Italy). Isolate SC
was collected from V. vinifera Chardonnay at the experimental field of INRA in Colmar (France). Isolate SL was
collected from the hybrid Bianca at the experimental
research station in Lednice (Czech Republic). After collection, infected leaves were frozen for subsequent
laboratory propagation. Propagation was conducted on a
laminar flow hood by infecting detached leaves from
seedlings of V. vinifera cv. Muscat Ottonel cultivated on
stone wool, and for each isolate separately to avoid
cross contaminations. Before inoculation leaves were
surface-sterilized with bleach, followed by three washes
in sterile water. After sterilization leaves were inoculated
with 10 μl-drops of a suspension of 50000 sporangia/ml.
Inoculated leaves were kept in Petri dishes on wet filter
paper and incubated in a growing chamber at 20°C and
a photoperiod of 16/8 h (light/dark, respectively). Inoculum droplets were dried with sterile filter paper 24 h
post infection and on the second day after infection
leaves were sprayed with Topsin fungicide (50 mg/l) in
order to eliminate saprophytes potentially present in the
inoculum suspension. Six days post infection part of the

sporulation was resuspended in distilled water to prepare inoculum for the bioassay. Remaining sporangia
were collected in a filter tip using a vacuum pump and
frozen at -20°C. The whole procedure was repeated
separately for each of the pathogen isolates.
Leaf disc bioassay

Leaves were detached from wood cuttings harvested in
two replicates in a greenhouse at 25°C. The fourth, fifth
and sixth leaf were detached and rinsed with distilled
water. Two plant replicates for each genotype were used
and for each leaf 10 discs of 1 cm diameter were excised
with a cork borer on a PVC pad. Leaf discs from the
three leaves were bulked and distributed over three
Petri dishes with the abaxial surface up, obtaining 20
leaf discs for each pathosystem. The bottom of all dishes
was covered in advance with filter paper dampened with
4 ml of sterile distilled water. The discs were then
infected with a 20 μl spore suspension concentrated at
10000 sporangia/ml and incubated in a growing chamber at 20°C and a photoperiod of 16/8 h (light/dark,
respectively). Drops were removed with sterile filter
paper after 24 h. Disease progress was monitored from
3 to 6 dpi and the degree of infection was quantified
according to the level of sporulation. Discs were classified using the OIV 452 descriptor [35]. Classes were
named 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 from the most susceptible to the
totally resistant, identified by absence of sporulation. At
6 dpi 10 discs for each replicate were resuspended in
10 ml of isotonic solution and 1 ml of this suspension
was used to assess spore concentration through a cell
counter (Beckman Coulter). Data were statistically analyzed using Microsoft Excel and R software.
P. viticola DNA extraction

DNA of the three grapevine downy mildew isolates was
extracted from samples of the infected leaf that served
as a starting point for subsequent replication. Total
DNA was obtained following a protocol modified from
[36]. Infected leaf discs were ground with liquid nitrogen in 2 ml tubes and 600 μl of extraction buffer (400
ml distilled water, 25 ml Tris 1 M pH 8, 10 ml EDTA
0.5 M pH 8, 20.5 g NaCl, 5 g CTAB, 5 g PVP) was
added. Samples were heated in a warming bath at 65°C
for one hour before adding 400 μl of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol followed by centrifugation at 4°C at 14000
rpm for 10 minutes. The aqueous phase (500-600 μl)
was transferred to 1.5 ml tubes and 2/3 volumes of isopropanol were added. After 30 minutes at room temperature the samples were centrifuged at 4°C at 14000
rpm for 10 minutes. The aqueous phase was discarded
and the pellet washed in 800 μl 70% ethanol and centrifuged at 4°C at 14000 rpm for 10 minutes. Finally, the
DNA was resuspended in 100 μl sterile water.

Microsatellite genotyping and phylogenetic analysis

The isolates SU, SC and SL and an additional set of 18
P. viticola isolates were genotyped using neutral genetic
markers. Among these 18 additional P. viticola isolates,
7 were collected in France, 4 in Italy, 1 in Germany, 5
in the Czech Republic and 1 in the United States of
America. All the isolates were typed at 8 microsatellite
loci (PV7, PV13, PV14, PV16, PV17, PV31, PV39, ISA)
as described in [33] and [37]. In order to investigate the
relationships between the 21 isolates, a matrix of pairwise allele shared distance (DAS) between all genotypes
was calculated using microsatellite data and a Neighbour-joining tree was reconstructed using the software
Population v1.2.30 http://bioinformatics.org/~tryphon/
populations/. The bootstrap support of nodes was calculated by resampling loci (1,000 replicates) and bootstrap
values > 50% were reported on the NJ tree.

QTL mapping

A total of 38 individuals from the Chardonnay ×
Bianca crossing, cultivated under controlled conditions
on stone wool, were inoculated in parallel with the SU
and SL isolates. Inoculations were performed as
described above. The parental genotypes as well as
Muscat Ottonel (highly susceptible) and genotype
0125G (resistant) were added to the analysis to verify
the quality of the development of the infection. The
sample of Chardonnay × Bianca progeny was selected
according to presence or absence of the major QTL in
chromosome 18, affecting the resistance against downy
mildew. Phenotypic data were scored as spore concentration per surface unit. Analyses were carried through
interval mapping method with MapQTL software version 5 [38] using the genetic map described in [20],
and the robustness of the QTLs above a threshold
LOD score was evaluated through a permutation test.
Analysis of variance was carried out in order to determine the effect of genotype on partial resistance to the
disease; values were compared through the KruskalWallis test.
