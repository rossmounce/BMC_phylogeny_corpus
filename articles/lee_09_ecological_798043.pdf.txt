Abstract
Background: Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, one of the principal vectors of malaria, has been
divided into two subspecific groups, known as the M and S molecular forms. Recent studies suggest
that the M form found in Cameroon is genetically distinct from the M form found in Mali and
elsewhere in West Africa, suggesting further subdivision within that form.
Methods: Chromosomal, microsatellite and geographic/ecological evidence are synthesized to
identify sources of genetic polymorphism among chromosomal and molecular forms of the malaria
vector Anopheles gambiae s.s.
Results: Cytogenetically the Forest M form is characterized as carrying the standard chromosome
arrangement for six major chromosomal inversions, namely 2La, 2Rj, 2Rb, 2Rc, 2Rd, and 2Ru.
Bayesian clustering analysis based on molecular form and chromosome inversion polymorphisms
as well as microsatellites describe the Forest M form as a distinct population relative to the West
African M form (Mopti-M form) and the S form. The Forest-M form was the most highly diverged
of the An. gambiae s.s. groups based on microsatellite markers. The prevalence of the Forest M form
was highly correlated with precipitation, suggesting that this form prefers much wetter
environments than the Mopti-M form.
Conclusion: Chromosome inversions, microsatellite allele frequencies and habitat preference all
indicate that the Forest M form of An. gambiae is genetically distinct from the other recognized
forms within the taxon Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. Since this study covers limited regions of
Cameroon, the possibility of gene flow between the Forest-M form and Mopti-M form cannot be
rejected. However, association studies of important phenotypes, such as insecticide resistance and
refractoriness against malaria parasites, should take into consideration this complex population
structure.

Background
Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto is one of the major vectors
responsible for malaria transmission in Africa. Genetic
polymorphism in An. gambiae s.s. is a major factor contributing to the widespread occurrence of this disease vector both in time and space. Population genetic analysis of
An. gambiae s.s. populations across Africa has revealed at
least three genetically distinct groups within this single
species[1]. However, an extensive literature describes a
highly complex population genetic structure on a much
smaller spatial scale in West and Central Africa [2-8].
Touré and his colleagues [5] examined the distribution of
five paracentric chromosome inversions on the right arm
of chromosome 2 (2R j, b, c, d and u). They established a
convention for describing the karyotype of an individual
mosquito, wherein a dash ('-') is used to designate the
standard homozygote, '1' for a heterozygote and '2' for the
inverted homozygote for each chromosome inversion.
Each karyotype, thus, includes five characters, each character denoting the "genotype" for each of the five 2R chromosome regions that include the j, b, c, d and u
inversions. Analysis of karyotype frequencies among An.
gambiae s.s. collected from a number of villages led to the
identification of discrete subpopulations within this species which can be distinguished by their karyotype. These
subpopulations were given non-Linnean designations
and are collectively known as "chromosomal forms"
[2,5]. Five chromosomal forms have been identified and
named Mopti, Bamako, Bissau, Forest and Savanna according to the regions from which they were first collected,
underscoring the association of each with a particular type
of habitat. Various field-based studies clearly demonstrate
that these forms show distinct patterns of seasonal and
geographic distributions [2,5,6,9]. Detailed analysis of
populations where multiple forms exist sympatrically
revealed a high degree of reproductive isolation between
the forms, with a strong preference for mating within
rather than between forms [8].
Attempts to develop molecular diagnostics for the chromosomal forms culminated in the recognition of two distinct sequences in the intergenic spacer region of the
ribosomal DNA locus [10,11]. A PCR-RFLP technique is
now widely used to distinguish between individuals carrying one or the other of the ribosomal "alleles". These have
been termed "molecular forms" of An. gambiae. There are
two molecular forms, M and S, which in some places (e.g.
Mali) nearly always correspond with the chromosomal
forms (S = Savanna or Bamako Form, M = Mopti Form). In
many places, however, the association between chromosomal form and molecular form appears to break down.
For example in Senegal the Savanna chromosomal form is
frequently of the M molecular form [12,13] and in Cameroon populations of the Forest chromosomal form may
be either M or S [14].

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/75

Analysis of gene flow between molecular forms has
revealed that, as with the chromosomal forms, there is
very strong positive assortative mating within molecular
forms with little or no mating between forms [8,14].
Wondji et al. [14] found significant genetic differentiation
between the M and S forms in Cameroon. The high levels
of differentiation (FST) they observed were uniformly distributed over ten microsatellite loci covering the entire
genome, leading them to conclude that differentiation is
the consequence of complete reproductive isolation
between the M and S forms in Cameroon. Likewise Slotman et al. [15] reported significant genetic differentiation
between the M and S forms in Cameroon. They also compared M form populations in Cameroon with those in
Mali and surprisingly found even higher levels of divergence than those reported between the M and S forms in
both countries. These findings led them to conclude that
there are two distinct M forms, which they termed MoptiM (described from Mali) and Forest-M (described from
Cameroon). These findings led to the hypothesis that
both reproductive isolation, as determined by molecular
form, and ecological factors affect the genetic makeup of
An. gambiae s.s. and other markers such as chromosomal
inversions should reflect such genetic divergence.
On the contrary, Yawson et al. [16] report a lack of differentiation between M and S forms in Ghana and Burkina
Faso. They used both Bayesian clustering methods and
FST-based analysis of allele frequencies at seven microsatellite loci. Although they did not find M/S hybrids, an
admixture analysis suggests introgression between the two
forms. They did, however, find strong differentiation
between populations occupying different ecological
zones, irrespective of M or S form, leading them to conclude that ecological barriers are more significant in
restricting gene flow among populations than is reproductive isolation between the two forms.
In this paper, the results of a study investigating associations between chromosome inversions and molecular
forms as well as the association between chromosome
inversions and levels of precipitation are presented.

Methods
Sample collection
Adult females of An. gambiae s.s. were collected indoors
using aspirators between 2002 and 2006 from the locations shown in Figure 1. Sample sizes range from 13 to
157 per site (Table 1). Mutengene is reported as Mutenguene and Pemperena as Pimperena in other publications. This paper followed the names listed in the
worldwide index of cities and towns, Global Gazetteer
version 2.1 (Falling Rain Genomics, Palo Alto, CA). Collections were made during the rainy season (collection
dates are provided in Table 1). Ovaries were removed
from semi-gravid females and stored in Carnoy's solution

for cytogenetic analysis of polytene chromosomes [17].
Carcasses were stored in alcohol for subsequent DNA
extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted using a DNeasy®
extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
Species and molecular form diagnostic
The PCR assay described by Scott et al. [18] was used to
identify members of the An. gambiae species complex.
Molecular forms within An. gambiae s.s. were identified
based on published methods [10,19].
Cytogenetic analysis
Polytene chromosomes were extracted from ovarian nurse
cells using the protocol described by Hunt [17]. Chromosome banding patterns were examined using an Olympus
BX-50 phase contrast microscope. Species identification
and karyotype scoring were accomplished using the polytene chromosome map for the An. gambiae complex devel-

oped by Coluzzi et al. [20] (maps available as supplement
material). The chromosomal forms of An. gambiae s.s.
were distinguished by scoring paracentric inversions on
the right arm of chromosome 2, as described by Coluzzi
et al. [9]. The genotypes of six chromosome inversions --2La, 2Rj, 2Rb, 2Rc, 2Rd, and 2Ru --- were scored for each
individual mosquito. Photographic images of chromosomes for the majority of individual mosquitoes used in
this study are available on request.
Microsatellite genotyping
Twenty microsatellite loci located on the second and the
third chromosome were screened, namely AG2H57,
AG2H85, AG2H125, AG2H135, AG2H164, AG2H175,
AG2H197, AG2H675, AG3H119, AG3H127, AG3H242,

AG3H746, AG3H812, AG3H817, AG3H93 [21]. The
same set of 12 markers on the third chromosome was

used in the previous study by Slotman et al. [15]. Some
specimens used in Slotman et al. [15] that had associated
karyotype data are also included in this study. Microsatellite markers were amplified using fluorescent primers and
a PTC-225 thermolcycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA).
PCR products were mixed with a DS-30 Matrix Standard
Kit (Dye Set D) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and
run on an ABI PRISM® 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Electrophoretograms were analysed using ABI PRISM® GeneScan
analysis software and Genotyper 3.7 NT.
Environmental data
Average annual precipitation for each collection site listed
in Table 1 were computed using daily precipitation data,
over multiple years, from weather stations within 15 km
radius of each sample collection site. Daily precipitation
recorded in Cameroon stations near mosquito collection
sites was acquired by personal communication with Dr.

Yongkang Xue in the Department of Geography at the
University of California – Los Angeles. Precipitation data
for Mali stations were acquired by personal communication with Dr. Charles E. Taylor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of
California – Los Angeles. These data are provided in Additional file 1.
The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme
(IGBP) global vegetation classification scheme in 1 km
resolution collected in 2004 was acquired in the form of
the Land Cover Yearly L3 Global 1 km (MOD12Q1) data
set produced by the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) project [22,23]. The data is
in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), which is the standard
data format for all NASA Earth Observing System (EOS)
data products. The HEG version 2.9 (HDF-EOS to Geotiff)
conversion tool was used to convert the acquired HDF file

to Geotiff [24]. ArcMap version 9.1 was used to draw
maps illustrating the habitat types surrounding each collection site.
Statistics
STRUCTURE software v2.2 [25-27] was used for Bayesian
clustering analysis of seven markers which include genotypes of molecular form and of 2La, 2Rj, 2Rb, 2Rc, 2Rd,
and 2Ru chromosome inversions. Six consecutive symbols are used to describe karyotypes representing the genotype of inversions 2La, 2Rj, 2Rb, 2Rc, 2Rd, and 2Ru. '-'
represents the standard (uninverted) homozygous
arrangement, '1' heterozygotes, '2' inverted homozygotes.
So, for example an individual that is homozygous for the
inverted arrangement at 2La (2), homozygous standard
for 2Rj (-), heterozygous for 2Rb (1), heterozygous for 2Rc
(1), homozygous standard for 2Rd (-) and heterozygous
for 2Ru (1) would be represented as: 2-11-1. Scoring of
karyotypes that include inversions in the heterozygous
condition is often ambiguous. For example, it is not possible to distinguish the 2Rbcu/+ from 2Rbc/u karyotype
(i.e. gametic phase is uncertain). Regardless of gametic
phase or haplotype, the input for this genotype is (- 11-1,
-----) or (-1---, --1-1). For this type of Bayesian analysis,
either input represents exactly the same genotype so will
have the same effect on the outcome of the clustering
analysis. The Bayesian model does not distinguish the two
but considers the fact that the corresponding individual is
heterozygous for 2Rb, 2Rc, and 2Ru. Linkage between loci
is something the model explores when it tries to find the
most likely solution (grouping).

The same analyses were applied to microsatellite genotypes. Individuals were clustered into a hypothetical
number of discrete populations, K = [1,8] and the probability of the data given K, Prob(X|K), was computed for
each run. Various combinations of burn-in period and
sampling period were tested. In this case, a burn-in period
of 100,000 and sampling period of 100,000 were sufficient. The probability of each individual belonging to
each of the K populations was plotted using distruct software [28]. Raw data is provided in Table S1.
The ELB algorithm [29] as implemented in the Arlequin
software package [30] was used to identify the gametic
phase of karyotypes. A burn-in period of 10,000 and sampling period of 1,000 were used for estimating gametic
phase. Estimated gametic phase information was subsequently used for a Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)
test. The Guo's Exact HWE Test [31] was performed both
on the locus and gamete level for each collection, which
consists of mosquitoes collected at the same site, same
day, and of the same molecular form. A burn-in period of
100,000 and sampling period of 100,000 was used to calculate the probability of HWE. Arlequin was also used to

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/75

calculate pair-wise FST values based on microsatellite genotypes among the six groups identified in Bayesian clustering analysis. The neighbourjoining algorithm
implemented in the neighbor program, a feature of Phylip
v.3.67 [32,33] was used to illustrate relationships among
groups. The drawtree program, also included in Phylip
v.3.67, was used to generate a phylogenetic tree based on
a pair-wise FST distance matrix. R software [34] was used
for drawing boxplots, computing Wilcoxon rank sum
tests, and performing linear regression.

Results
Distribution of An. gambiae s.s. forms and inversions
The distribution of molecular forms and 2La inversion
genotypes (karyotypes) are illustrated in Figure 1. In Cameroon, S forms were found in all five sample locations,
while M forms were localized in the evergreen broadleaf
forest region below latitude 4.5°N. In Mali, S forms were
dominant below latitude 12°N in mostly savanna
regions, while M forms were predominant above 15°N
where land cover types are mostly grasslands or open
shrublands (Table 1, Figure 1).

Chromosome inversion polymorphism was examined on
the second chromosome, specifically 2La, 2Rj, 2Rb, 2Rc,
2Rd and 2Ru. Karyotypes, as well as molecular forms were
distributed in a non-random fashion. For instance, only
25% of samples collected in Cameroon were 2La inversion homozytoes (a/a), mostly concentrated in a village
called Godola located in northern Cameroon. The 2La
inversion was completely absent in Tiko and Mutengene.
In contrast, about 87% of specimens collected in Mali
were 2La inversion homozygotes (Table 1, Figure 1) and
only three specimens were 2La standard homozygotes
(+a/+a).
The M forms found in Mali were polymorphic for all six
inversions (96% of the samples from Mali carried at least
one copy of the 2Rb and/or c inversions), but were predominantly 2La inversion homozygotes. M form populations in Cameroon were predominantly fixed for the
standard karyotype (M------) for all six inversions, including 2La. In the savanna region of northern Cameroon the
M form occurred, but was rare (e.g. 1 M form from Maroua, 10.60 N 14.33E, 3 M forms from Ourodoukoudje,
9.083 N 13.683E and 4 M forms from Raio, 9.117 N
13.717E). In these cases all had the M2-22-- (2La a/a, 2R
bc/bc) karyotype. Due to very small sample size, these
sites were not included in this study.
The S forms collected in Cameroon were polymorphic for
the 2La and 2Rb inversions, although inversion homozygotes for 2La and 2Rb were relatively rare compared to
Mali. In Cameroon, 30% (43/143) of S forms were 2Rb
homozygotes, but 93% of these were from a single site

(Godola). The standard arrangement for 2Rb (+b/+b) was
also common, occurring at a frequency of 45% (64/143)
in Cameroon. Fewer +b/+b S form individuals were
observed in Mali (18%, 48/273) than in Cameroon. S
form 2Rb homozygotes occurred with equivalent frequencies in the villages of Banambani, Kela and Pemperena,
perhaps because these occur in similar land cover types
(Table 1). In drier areas of Mali such as grasslands and
open shrublands, the S form was rare. The correlation of
2La and 2Rb inversions with an environmental parameter, precipitation, is discussed below.
Identification of discrete populations based on molecular
form and karyotype
Finding the most succinct classification of karyotypes was
attempted by employing a Bayesian clustering analysis,
the results of which are depicted in Figures 2 and 3. Each
vertical line in Figure 2 represents a single mosquito and
different colours represent different clusters. The length of

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/75

each colour represents the membership coefficient for
that individual for each corresponding population. The
membership coefficient of an individual can be interpreted as the probability of belonging to a population, or
how much of its genome originated from a population.
Thus, if an individual is indicated mostly in one colour,
that individual likely originated from the corresponding
population. If an individual is represented in two colours
of equal length, that individual has half of its genome
originated from one population and the other half from
another. The sum of the membership coefficients for each
individual is 1. Individuals were arranged such that the
latitude of the collection sites increases from left to right
on the bar plots in Figure 2. In some areas, the colours
appear to be a solid block because the corresponding individuals have identical karyotypes. Karyotypes associated
with each of the six populations are provided in Table 2.
An additional character was added for molecular form.
'M', for M form, 'S', for S form.

Posterior probabilities of karyotype and microsatellite based Bayesian cluster analyses. The boxplots were
drawn after collecting posterior probabilities of 5 independent runs. The medians were drawn as thick black lines. Some
boxes appear as a single line because the range of the posterior probabilities is too narrow to show as a box. Outliers
are shown as open circle (m). A: Clustering of individuals into
seven groups (K = 7) was the most probable solution for
molecular form and karyotype data. B: Analysis of clustering
of genotypes at 20 microsatellite loci yielded several outcomes with relatively high likelihood. Liklihoods for K = 4, K
= 5 and K = 7 are similarly distributed (Wilcox twosample
test, P > .05).

The analyses depicted in Figures 2A and 3A included
molecular form and six chromosome inversion genotypes
as criteria. A range of values for K was tested, which
denotes the hypothetical number of populations. The
solutions for K = 7 have the highest likelihood (Figure
3A).
The Forest M form was classified as a discrete population,
fixed for the standard arrangement (M------) for all six
inversions and carrying the M ribosomal allele (Table 2,
shown in green in Figure 2). These are the same individuals identified as 'M 2L+/+' in Figure 1 (marked in green)
mostly found in evergreen broadleaf forest regions in
Cameroon. The observed lack of inversion polymorphism
is consistent with previous observations by Wondji et al.
[14,35]. Although some inversion polymorphism in M
forms was observed in their study these were restricted to
woody savanna areas (Tibati, Dschang) or to habitats at
the border of evergreen forests and woody savannas. Two
M form samples from Mali (one from Kela and the other
from Banikane) had standard 2R arrangements. However,
both were homozygous for 2La (2La a/a), consequently
the Bayesian models predicted that these two samples
belong to the Mopti-M form group rather than Forest M
form (See Additional file 2 for genotype and corresponding membership coefficients).

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/75

The Bayseian analysis based on molecular form and karyotype (Figure 2A) divided the Mopti chromosomal form
into two groups: Mopti-M bc/bc (red) and Mopti-M
"other" (orange). Significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was observed among M form
populations at Nara (P = 0.0000 ± 0.0000) and Banikane
(P = 0.00016 ± 0.00004). (Note that the M form population at Dire was excluded from HWE analysis because it is
monomorphic for the bc karyotype (M2-22--; bc/bc)). The
authors suspect that separation of the Mopti-M form
reflects strong selection for the 2Rbc inversion in response
to the arid conditions that exist at these sites. This observation is consistent with results reported by Touré et al. [3]
who observed an increase in the frequency of 2Rb in M
forms as precipitation decreases. However, this trend is
not limited to M forms and a similar trend was also found
in S forms (See Additional file 3). Overall, 2Rb inversion
frequencies increased as precipitation decreases (Figure
4B)[5].
The S molecular form was divided into four groups, Forest-S (light blue), Savanna-S (blue), Bamako-S (purple),
and Godola-S (yellow, Figure 2A). Forest-S forms were
polymorphic for the 2La and 2Rb inversions, although
inversion homozygotes for 2La or 2Rb were absent (Table
2). In contrast, inversion homozygotes for 2La and 2Rb
were very common in the Savanna-S form (Table 2). The
amount of gene flow between these two groups was relatively high as indicated by the presence of many individuals with mixed light blue and blue colors. This could be
interpreted as active gene flow between the two groups, or
less confidence in the clustering due to a lack of more discriminatory markers and/or the groups having relatively
similar inversion frequencies.
Individuals homozygous for 2Rj, c, and u inversions were
classified as the Bamako-S group (shown in purple in Figure 2A); this group represents the Bamako chromosomal
form [5,9]. The 2Rb inversion was polymorphic within
this group. Deviation from HWE were significant among
S forms collected in Kela (P = 0.0000 ± 0.0000) and Banambani (P = 0.0000 ± 0.0000) as expected considering the
S forms in these locations include both Bamako and
Savanna chromosomal forms.
The samples collected in Godola were all of the S molecular form, but included unusual karyotypes that do not fit
within the conventional definitions for An. gambiae chromosomal forms [5,9,36]. The Savanna form typically has
the 2Rb inversion alone or in combination with the 2Rc
and u inversions. At Godola, with the exception of a single
individual, the 2Ru inversion was absent. The most common arrangement (82% of individuals) was 2Rbcd and
40% of the individuals sampled from this site were
homozygous for the 2Rb, c and d inversions (Table 2).

N = Total number of An. gambiae samples for each collection site. M = M molecular form, S = S molecular form, '+' stands for standard arrangement
for 2La inversion, 'a' for inverted arrangement, and '?' for unknown arrangement.

Deviation from HWE in the S-Godola population was significant (P = 0.0064 ± 0.0002), mainly due to 1 specimen
with the S2-22-2 (bcu/bcu) genotype. Only six individuals
(13%) had typical Savanna karyotypes. The 2Rd inversion
is a very unusual arrangement both in Mali (freq. = 0.008)
and Cameroon (freq. at sites other than Godola = 0.026).
In Godola the 2Rd inversion occurred at a frequency of
0.544. Moreover, S form individuals carrying the 2Rbc
combination (without 2Ru), typical arrangements for the
Mopti chromosomal form (M molecular form), is noteworthy.
Identification of discrete populations based on
microsatellite genotypes
Genetic differentiation between identified groups was
estimated using pair-wise FST values based on 20 microsatellite markers on the second and third chromosomes.
Results from this analysis indicate that the Forest-M group
(M------) is the most genetically distant from all other
groups. This result was consistent with the previous study

by Slotman et al. [15]. The matrix of genetic distances is
provided in Table 3. An unrooted tree calculated from the
distance matrix using a neighbour-joining algorithm is
provided in Figure 4. Genetic differentiation was low
between the Mopti-M 2R bc/bc group and the "other"
Mopti- M form (FST = 0.0029, P = 0.016). Notice that
genetic differentiation between the Savanna-S and
Bamako-S groups were the smallest among the four S
molecular form groups but still highly significant (FST =
0.0056, P = 0.0000). These two forms are thought to mate
assortatively and are considered to represent incipient
species [5,37].
The outcome of the Bayesian clustering analysis was compared based on karyotypes with those based on microsatellite genotypes (Figures 2B, C and 3B). Wilcox twosample test indicates that K = 4 and K = 5 have similar likelihoods (P = 0.42). K = 5 generated a solution with the
highest posterior probability Prob(X|K), where X is genotype data. Boxplots drawn after collecting posterior prob-

abilities from 5 independent runs are presented in Figure
3B and resulting membership coefficients are plotted in
Figure 2B (K = 4) and 2C (K = 5).
Under the assumption of K = 5 (Figure 2C), the Bayesian
model identified the Forest-M form group (green) in Tiko
and Mutengene, a Forest-S form (light blue) group,
mostly concentrated in southern and central Cameroon,
Bamako-S form group, Savanna-S group, and the MoptiM form (red) group in Mali. The Savanna-S form group
indicated in blue subsumes the Godola-S group identified
based on karyotype (Figure 2A). Unlike karyotype clustering, the Mopti-M form remained as a single group based
on microsatellite genotypes at both K = 4 and K = 5. This
is reflected in the relatively low FST values between the two
groups (Table 3, Figure 4).
Chromosome inversions, molecular forms and the
environment
As latitude increases in Cameroon the proportion of M
form decreases whereas the inverse correlation was found
in Mali. Generally, precipitation is higher at lower lati-

tudes both in Mali and Cameroon (Table 4), but the
amount of precipitation in southern Cameroon is 2–3
times higher than that in southern Mali. Average precipitation per collection site is summarized in Table 4
(detailed data are provided in Table S2). The correlation
between the proportion of M molecular forms and annual
precipitation in Cameroon and Mali is illustrated in Figure 5. The proportion of M form increases as precipitation
increases in Cameroon (P = 0.00012). In contrast, the proportion of M form decreases as precipitation increases in
Mali (P < 2 × 10-16). The dramatic difference in environmental preference between the Forest- M (Cameroon) and
Mopti-M (Mali) is reflected in the genetic distance
between the two illustrated in Table 3, Figure 4 and as
described earlier by Slotman et al. [15].
The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme
(IGBP) land cover scheme (Figure 1) identifies Tiko and
Mutengene, where the Forest-M form is abundant, as an
evergreen broadleaf forest region. On the other hand, the
Mopti-M form is collected in the much drier savanna
(Kela, Banambani), grassland (Nara), or open shrubland
habitats (Dire, Banikane).
The correlation between the 2La inversion frequency and
annual precipitation is shown in Figure 6A. The frequency
of the 2La inversion decreased as the amount of precipitation increased (P < 2 × 10-16); a pattern consistent with
previous studies in Africa [2,38]. As previously described,
much fewer S form 2La homozygotes were observed in
Cameroon and most of these were concentrated in
Godola. All the study sites in Mali were much drier than
those in Cameroon, except for Godola. This is reflected in
the abundance of the 2La inversion in samples collected
in Mali. Northern sites such as Nara and Banikane, located
near the Sahara Desert, are particularly dry and the Mopti
chromosomal form prevails at these sites. Some 2R standard arrangement were found in Mali, but all of them,
except one, were 2La inversion homozygotes (M2-----);

Precipitation and molecular form
Precipitation and molecular form. Correlation between the proportion of M molecular forms and the average annual precipitation in (A) Cameroon and (B) Mali. Average annual precipitation was calculated using annual precipitation at multiple
weather stations at or near collection sites (within a 15 km radius) and over multiple years. m = average annual precipitation at
each site. Details of precipitation data are provided in Table S2. A. The proportion of the M forms increases as precipitation
increases in Cameroon. B. The opposite trend was observed in Mali. These seemingly conflicting results illustrate that the Forest-M form and Mopti-M form differ with respect to habitat preference as well as being differentiated genetically. The solid line
is a linear model (y~ax+b) of the data. (A) For the Cameroon data, a = 0.0395 ± 0.0184 (P = 0.121) and b = -50.5 ± 37.8 (P =
0.274). (B) For the Mali data, a = -0.108 ± 0.0150 (P = 0.00197) and b = 122 ± 10.3 (P = 0.000283).

classified in the Savanna-S group rather than Forest-S
group. Because of the inverse correlation between 2Rb
and precipitation, division between the Forest-S group
and Savanna-S or Godola-S groups is likely due to the
skewed 2Rb frequency.

A similar trend was observed for the 2Rb inversion. The
frequency of 2Rb increased as precipitation decreased, as
reported by Coluzzi et al. [2]. Individuals homozygous for
2Rb (b/b) and 2La (a/a) had a high probability of being

Figure 4). The frequency of 2La and 2Rb in Godola were
in line with the expectation based on precipitation.
Genetic differentiation, based on microsatellite markers
(Figure 2B and 2C), were also somewhat consistent with
the association of land cover types and inversion polymorphism.
An unusual concentration of the 2Rd inversion in Godola
resulted in the Bayesian analysis distinguishing it as a separate population (Figure 2A). Godola is located in an area
surrounded by a mosaic of grasslands, permanent wetlands and croplands (Table 4). Permanent wetlands surround 19% of Godola, highest among our collection sites.
A more detailed analysis of the effect of environmental
parameters on the distribution of the 2Rd inversion will
be necessary to gain an understanding of the relationship
between the Godola-S form and other S forms.
The correlation between genetic markers and standard
deviation of precipitation was also investigated. Areas
with higher precipitation had greater variation in rainfall
as well, as illustrated in Table 4. Thus the trend illustrated
in Figures 5 and 6 remained the same between genetic
markers and rainfall variation.

Discussion
Classification of populations of An. gambiae s.s. into chromosomal forms using four paracentric chromosome

inversions (2Rb, c, j and u) has been useful in identifying
discrete sub-populations in Mali. Expanding this interpretation to include other areas in Africa has proven difficult
because a significant proportion of karyotypes are ambiguous with respect to the classification scheme developed
and used in Mali. Additional information, including
molecular form, the 2La inversion and multi-locus microsatellite genotypes was employed in an attempt to obtain
higher resolution of population structure in this species.
Seven groups were identified in the Bayesian analysis
using molecular form, 2La, 2Rj, 2Rb, 2Rc, 2Rd, and 2Ru
inversion genotypes as markers (Figure 2A). These seven
groups are Forest-M, Forest-S, Godola-S, Savanna-S,
Bamako, Mopti-M bc/bc, and other Mopti-M forms (Figure 2A). Each group showed distinctive inversion polymorphism, and each occupied a different land cover type
(Figure 1). Bayesian analysis using microsatellite data for
the most part supported the analysis based on chromosome inversions and molecular form, with some notable
exceptions (Figures 2B and 2C). The microsatellite analyses at K = 4 and K = 5 resolved groups with roughly equivalent likelihoods (Figure 3B). Microsatellites failed to
resolve the Godola-S group within the range of K values
(K = [1,8]). At K = 4 the S form was divided into the ForestS form and all other S forms. At K = 5 the other S form
group was split into the Bamako and Savanna forms.

The M form
The Bayesian analysis based on molecular form and karyotype divided M form populations into three discrete
groups. The Forest M form was characterized as having the
standard arrangement for all six major chromosomal
inversions, namely 2La, 2Rj, 2Rb, 2Rc, 2Rd and 2Ru. The
Mopti-M form was further divided into two groups, one
that is fixed for the 2Rbc inverted arrangement and the
other M forms with the 2La/a genotype. The Forest-M
form was the most distinct (Figures 2 and 4). The high
degree of genetic divergence between the Forest-M form
and all the others was indicated not only by the 2R chromosome arrangement, but also at 20 microsatellite markers on the second and third chromosomes (Table 3, Figure
4). Moreover, the Forest-M form showed a strong association with very wet environments, distinguishing this form
from the Mopti-M form, which is most abundant in much
drier habitats (Figures 1 and 6, Table 4).

Despite occupying the same ecological zone and being
identical with respect to karyotype (homosequential), the
level of genetic differentiation (FST = 0.04263, P = 0.0000)
between the Forest-M and Forest-S forms was higher than
among any of the other subspecific forms of An. gambiae
s.s. (Table 3, Figure 4). The relationship between the Forest-M and Forest-S forms is clearly different from the relationship between the Mopti-M and Savanna-S forms in
Mali. Hybridization between the Mopti-M and Savanna-S
forms, although rare, has been frequently reported [8,3941], whereas reproductive isolation between sympatric
Forest-M and S forms appears to be complete [14,15,35].
These results demonstrate that reproductive isolation, and
not ecological barriers, plays the major role in limiting
gene flow between the Forest M and S forms in Cameroon
and between the Mopti-M and Savanna-S forms in Mali.
The M forms were further sub-divided into two groups
based on the Bayesian analysis of karyotype data (MoptiM and "Other"-M, Figure 2A), while microsatellite data
structured them as a single group (Figure 2B and 2C). The
Mopti-M form is characterized as being fixed for the double homozygous b/c karyotype, whereas the "Other"-M
form group carried the 2Rb and c inversions in other combinations or were standard karyotype. Both were fixed for
the 2La inversion. Although genetic differentiation
between the two groups as measured by pair-wise FST is
significant, the degree of divergence is relatively small and
insufficient to classify them as two separate groups, that is
as two distinct gene pools.
The S form
The Bayesian clustering analysis based on molecular form
and karyotype grouped S form populations into four
group: Forest-S, Godola-S, Savanna-S and Bamako-S (Figure 2A). The Forest-S group includes individuals with the

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/75

standard (non-inverted) karyotype and individuals carrying the 2La and/or 2Rb inversions. Forest-S 2Rb heterozygotes were located in woody savanna habitats (Ndop and
Foumbot), while only Forest-S form with standard
arrangement were collected from evergreen forest habitats
(Mutengene and Tiko). This distribution may reflect selection for the 2Rb inversion in drier habitats. S form 2Rb
homozygotes were classified as Godola-S form if the 2Rd
inversion is also present, Savanna-S form if no other inversions occur on chromosome 2R, or Bamako-S if the 2Rj,
2Rc and 2Ru inversions occur together.
The Bamako-S form was not resolved by the analysis
based on microsatellites with K = 4, but was resolved at K
= 5. The Godola-S form however, was not resolved by the
microsatellite data at either K = 4 or K = 5. The Godola-S
group represents a distinctive group with respect to inversion polymorphism, notably a high frequency of the 2Rd
inversion and 2Rb and c combinations not typically
found in individuals within the S molecular form. However, the distinctive karyotypic polymorphism was not
captured by the Bayesian analysis of microsatellite polymorphism.
Analysis of levels of genetic divergence, described with
microsatellite-based FST values (Table 3, Figure 4) suggest
several relationships among the An. gambiae populations
studied here. The major division distinguishes the ForestM form from all others (Figure 4). S form populations
form four groups.
Interestingly, the Bamako-S and Savanna-S forms are the
least diverged of the four, although it is the Bamako chromosomal form that has received the most attention,
including the suggestion that it represents a distinct species [37,42].
Forces affecting the distribution of forms
Recently Yawson et al. [16] reported higher levels of
genetic divergence between within-form populations
from different environments relative to between-form
populations from the same environments in Ghana and
Burkina Faso. This led them to conclude that barriers to
gene flow among populations are due more to ecological
barriers than reproductive isolation between molecular
forms. The two sites in Cameroon from which we
described the Forest-M form occur within a region that is
more or less contiguous with the mangrove strand sites in
southern Ghana from which Yawson et al. [16] collected
M forms for their study [43]. Furthermore, the 1 km resolution land-cover map of Africa by Mayaux et al. [43] indicates that land-cover in northern Ghana is similar to
southern Mali. These results suggest that the M form collected by Yawson et al. [16] in northern Ghana represent
the Mopti- M form while the M form they collected in the

Page 12 of 15

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:75

mangrove strand of southern Ghana are of the Forest-M
form. It is, therefore, likely that what Yawson et al. [16]
describe as intra-form comparisons of M form populations are in fact inter-form comparisons between Forest-M
and Mopti-M forms. Overall, the results suggest that
reproductive isolation among forms plays an important
role in restricting gene flow among populations. Evidence
laid out here does, however, support the idea that ecological barriers also play a significant role.
The correlations between 2La and 2Rb inversion frequencies and precipitation (Figure 6) were significant. In this
study, precipitation is used as a proxy for different habitat
type, rather than the causal factor for the distribution of
2La and 2Rb. Inversion polymorphisms in natural populations of An. gambiae s.s. are very complex and simple
summary statistics, such as annual precipitation, are not
sufficient to capture the diverse nature of the forces driving their distribution in nature. For example, the Godola
collection has an unusual concentration of the 2Rd inversion which is difficult to explain by precipitation alone.
Variation in rainfall was an obvious first environmental
factor to consider, however describing this variable is not
as trivial as it may seem. Rainfall is measured from 0
(meaning no rain) to some rain, and most of the regions
included in this study have both rainy and dry seasons.
Regions with high precipitation show greater variation in
rainfall. Therefore, the correlation between genetic markers and the standard deviation of precipitation resulted in
the same trend as the correlation with precipitation.
Moreover, the standard deviation in rainfall is far greater
than the mean (Table 4), illustrating the volatile nature of
precipitation data. Examining the relationship between
the distribution of genetic markers and rainfall in places
like Tiko and Mutengene is further complicated because
they have two rainy and two dry seasons. Other measures
of rainfall variation, such as number of consecutive dry
days or length of dry season can be explored. Development of summary statistics that may better reflect various
rainfall patterns, as well as investigation of other environmental parameters are needed.
Microsatellites did detect population groups according to
ecology and molecular forms. Division of Mopti-M,
Savanna-S and Bamako-S groups are consistent with previous studies. Subdivision of the M form into Mopti-M
and Forest-M forms has strong support in all of the Bayesian analyses presented here, as was subdivision of the S
form into Savanna-S and Forest-S forms, although examination of Figures 2B and 2C suggest that the latter division
is less clear.

Conclusion
Overall this study confirms the Forest-M form as a distinct
group, that lacks chromosome inversion polymorphism,

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/75

is the most highly diverged of all the recognized subspecific forms of An. gambiae s.s. and is distinguished from
other M molecular form populations by having a strong
preference for environments with relatively high precipitation. The Forest-M form occurs in sympatry with the
Forest- S form and reproductive isolation between the two
appears to be complete, that is, no hybrids were observed.
The relationship between the Forest-M form and Mopti-M
form is less clear. It is clear that the two are relatively
highly diverged, FST = 0.02487 compared for example to
the level of divergence between the Bamako and Savanna
chromosomal forms in Mali, FST = 0.00559. However, we
lack good information as to whether the Forest-M and
Mopti-M forms are reproductively isolated since we have
not identified sites at which the two are sympatric.
When investigating associations between genetic markers
and important phenotypes such as insecticide resistance
and malaria parasite refractory features, disregard of existing population structure may lead to identification of spurious associations or may obfuscate true associations. The
level of genetic differentiation and geographic distribution of the Forest-M form illustrates the potential danger
of relying solely on molecular form for genotype/phenotype association studies.
