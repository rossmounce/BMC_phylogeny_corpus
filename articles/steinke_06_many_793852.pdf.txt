Abstract
Background: Gene and genome duplication events increase the amount of genetic material that
might then contribute to an increase in the genomic and phenotypic complexity of organisms during
evolution. Thus, it has been argued that there is a relationship between gene copy number and
morphological complexity and/or species diversity. This hypothesis implies that duplicated genes
have subdivided or evolved novel functions compared to their pre-duplication proto-orthologs.
Such a functional divergence might be caused by an increase in evolutionary rates in one ortholog,
by changes in expression, regulatory evolution, insertion of repetitive elements, or due to positive
Darwinian selection in one copy. We studied a set of 2466 genes that were present in Danio rerio,
Takifugu rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis and Oryzias latipes to test (i) for forces of positive Darwinian
selection; (ii) how frequently duplicated genes are retained, and (iii) whether novel gene functions
might have evolved.
Results: 25% (610) of all investigated genes show significantly smaller or higher genetic distances
in the genomes of particular fish species compared to their human ortholog than their orthologs
in other fish according to relative rate tests. We identified 49 new paralogous pairs of duplicated
genes in fish, in which one of the paralogs is under positive Darwinian selection and shows a
significantly higher rate of molecular evolution in one of the four fish species, whereas the other
copy apparently did not undergo adaptive changes since it retained the original rate of evolution.
Among the genes under positive Darwinian selection, we found a surprisingly high number of ATP
binding proteins and transcription factors.
Conclusion: The significant rate difference suggests that the function of these rate-changed genes
might be essential for the respective fish species. We demonstrate that the measurement of
positive selection is a powerful tool to identify divergence rates of duplicated genes and that this
method has the capacity to identify potentially interesting candidates for adaptive gene evolution.

Background
Biology is a discipline rooted in comparisons. Comparative studies have led to the assembly of a detailed catalogue of biological similarities and, also, of differences
between species, yielding insights into the mechanisms by
which organisms and their genomes adapt to a wide range
of ecological niches. Genomics is the most recent biological discipline to employ comparison-based approaches.
During the last five years, whole genome sequences have
become available for several vertebrates: e.g., human,
mouse, rat, chicken, zebrafish, and two pufferfish species
(Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis) [1-6]. The
increasing wealth of sequence data allows whole genome
comparisons for the study of the evolutionary forces that
shape genomes [7]. Comparative strategies have identified chromosomal blocks of DNA sequences that are conserved over long evolutionary time spans. Such a degree of
evolutionary conservation has, for example, been a powerful guide in sorting functional from non-functional
DNA [8-11] and to assign putative gene function.
Ray-finned fishes, which comprise ~25,000 extant species
[12], are the most species-rich group of vertebrates. They
show enormous differences in their morphology and
adaptations to divergent environments. Their sister group
are the lobe-finned fishes, which include the other half of
all bony vertebrates, such as coelacanths, lungfishes and
the tetrapods (amphibian, reptiles, birds and mammals).
The ray-finned fishes and the lobe-finned fishes diverged
between 400–450 million years ago [13]. Although this
large evolutionary distance would imply that only a rather
small fraction of the functional portions of their genomes
are shared, comparative studies revealed that most human
coding sequences (~91%) are homologous to genes in
fish [5]. Natural selection is known to leave its footprint
on protein-coding sequences in a genome by affecting
rates of silent and replacement rates differentially. In
sequences that have evolved under positive selection, the
number of retained mutations is closer to those that arose
by mutation than under purifying selection where amino
acid replacement mutations are selected against.
It has been suggested that the large number of fish species
and their tremendous morphological diversity might be
causally related to a genome duplication event that is specific to the teleost lineage [14-21]. Since gene and genome
duplication events are likely to increase the genetic rawmaterial, it has been speculated that there is a relationship
between gene copy number and morphological complexity and, by extension, also species diversity [22,23]. This
would imply that one copy of a duplicated gene has
diverged from the roles of the pre-duplication ortholog.
Such a divergence could be demonstrated by an increase
in evolutionary rate, expression differences, regulatory
evolution, and/or by evidence for positive Darwinian

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/20

selection. Duplicated genes may be redundant after the
duplication event, which means that inactivation of one
of the two duplicates might have little or no effect on the
phenotype [24-26]. Therefore, since at least one of the
copies is free from any functional constraint, mutations in
this gene-copy might be selectively neutral, having the
potential to turn one copy into a non-functional pseudogene. Alternatively, one of the duplicates might adopt a
new function through neofunctionalization [22,27,28],
or the ancestral function might get divided between the
paralogs (subfunctionalization) [29,30]. Recent studies
revealed that subfunctionalization can occur rapidly and
is often accompanied by prolonged and substantial rates
of neofunctionalization in a large proportion of duplicated genes. Thus, a new model, termed sub-neofunctionalization (SNF) has been proposed [31,32]. Other authors
argue, that the evolution of new functions may start with
the duplication of an existing gene in a sense a preadaptation for that function, followed by a period of evolution
among the gene copies, resulting in the preservation of the
most effective variant and the 'pseudogenization' and
eventual loss of the remaining copies [33].
Post-duplication secondary gene loss is relatively frequent. However, it has been estimated that, nonetheless,
~20%–50% of paralogous genes are retained for longer
evolutionary time spans after a genome duplication event
[34,35]. A selective advantage due to a new and possibly
unique function seems to be sufficient to retain a copy
and to prevent degenerative substitutions that would ultimately drive the other copy to become a pseudogene.
Among other factors positive Darwinian selection can be
responsible for functional divergence between two duplicates (e.g., [36-38]). When a gene with multiple functions
is duplicated, the duplicates are redundant only for as
long as each copy retains the ability to perform all ancestral roles [29,30]. According to the duplication-degeneration-complementation (DCC) model [30], degenerative
mutations preserve rather than disrupt duplicated genes,
but also change their functions or at least restrict their
original functions which later might become more specialized.
In the current study, simultaneous sequence comparisons
of the entire protein-coding portions of the genomes of
four fish model species (Danio rerio, Takifugu rubripes,
Tetraodon nigroviridis and Oryzias latipes) with the human
outgroup genome were conducted in order to study the
evolutionary extent of sequence conservation and divergence in duplicated fish genes. To facilitate gene identification for functional genomic studies, each data set has
been annotated using the structured vocabulary provided
by the Gene Ontology Consortium (2001), based on
molecular studies of the gene function in Homo sapiens. To
detect lineage-specific evolutionary processes, we

attempted to identify genes that seem to have evolved
with significantly divergent (slower or faster) rates of
amino acid substitution in one particular species. To this
end, we applied a non-parametric relative rate test [39].
Duplicated genes identified with this approach were further studied to test for evidence of positive Darwinian

selection and whether the hypothesis for the retention of
duplicated genes and the evolution of novel gene functions in one copy is supported. To test whether sequences
have been subjected to positive Darwinian selection, the
ratio of the proportion of radical nonsynonymous difference (dR) per radical nonsynonymous site and the pro-

Example of a ternary representation of distances of fish species to human orthologs (Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes, Tetraodon nigroviridis). The red circle represents Lysyl-oxidase-like-1 (LOXL-1), a gene with significantly lower distance from Tetraodon nigroviridis to the human ortholog than to other fish species.

portion of conservative nonsynonymous site (dC) was
calculated using the an approach of Hughes et al. [40].
Although different methods have been developed to
detect positive selection based on the rate of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous substitutions (dS), we note
that this ratio can be possibly used to detect positive selection for recently diverged genes only (30–50 MYA) as
demonstrated in previous studies [41,42]. It has also been
argued that positive selection is of an episodic nature.
Meaning that, after a period of positive selection, purify-

ing selection usually blurs the substitution pattern that is
indicative of positive selection [38,43]. Since the method
by Hughes et al. [40] compares nonsynonymous sites and
the resulting amino acid changes only, positive selection
would need to be active for a much longer period. It
should be noted though, that this method may be less
sensitive than methods based on the dN/dS ratio [43,44].
Furthermore, a recent study revealed that the dR/dC measure is influenced by the transition/transversion ratio and
amino acid composition of the investigated sequences

Results
BLAST similarity searches of data sets of protein sequences
of Tetraodon nigroviridis revealed a total of 12422 significant hits (e-value: 10-50) when compared to the human
genome (outgroup). 12176 hits were found when comparing Takifugu rubripes to the human genome, 9619 hits
were found for Danio rerio and 4681 hits were obtained
for Oryzias latipes. For our comparative approach (Figure
1), 2466 orthology groups consisting of genes found in all
four fish species could be assigned. Figure 2 shows an
example of a ternary diagram of p-distances of Tetraodon
nigroviridis, Danio rerio and Oryzias latipes amino acid
sequences always with respect to the Homo sapiens genes.
A total of 390 genes were found that have a smaller distance to the human ortholog than their orthologs in other

fish species according to relative rate tests, whereas 220
genes show higher distances in one of the tested fish species' genomes (Table 1). In Oryzias latipes a higher percentage (8.43%) of genes show a smaller genetic distance to
their human orthologs than in the other fish genomes.
The number of genes with higher or lower distance for
particular fish species is depicted in Figure 3. The majority
of genes detected in Oryzias latipes and Danio rerio show
smaller distances, whereas a higher amount of genes in
both pufferfish species seem to have evolved faster (59%).
All genes under positive Darwinian selection according to
Hughes et al. [40] with asymmetric sequence divergence to
the human ortholog are given for Tetraodon nigroviridis
(Table 2), Takifugu rubripes (Table 3), Danio rerio (Table 4)
and Oryzias latipes (Table 5). A complete list of the genes
with divergent evolutionary rates from all fish species is
provided in the supplementary material [see Supplementary File 1]. In all dN/dS calculations (data not shown) dS

with different functions for the complete dataset as well as
for those genes where one of the fish species shows higher
or smaller genetic distances. Some functions are likely to
be overrepresented due to small sample sizes, like copper
ion binding proteins, where 60% of the total numbers of
proteins of this gene function show higher or lower distances in one fish species. This applies also to peptidases
(40%), sugar binding proteins (60%) and members of the
Wnt signaling pathway (100%). On the other hand, only
one group (ubiquitin-protein ligases) shows a lower percentage (7.5%) than within the total number of proteins
of this function in all comparisons (Figure 4).

outperforms dN, which is expected given the old divergence times between the investigated species.
All the genes with divergent evolutionary rates have been
tentatively annotated according to the best hit match
according to the Homo sapiens UniGene data base. For
these duplicates, the rate difference and the results of the
relative rate tests between the two paralogs are given in the
corresponding table (Table 2, 3, 4, 5). The annotation of
the zebrafish best hits was additionally validated by comparisons to the ZFIN database (Table 4). Table 6 shows
the number of fish specific paralogous pairs of genes discovered in this study with different evolutionary rates as
compared to their human ortholog. Furthermore, the
number of pairs where one paralog appears to have
evolved under positive Darwinian selection is listed in
Table 6. Accordingly, a total of 49 fish specific paralogous
genes could be identified. Of these, 24 show a statistically
significant accelerated rate of evolution in one of the two
copies and 14 show positive Darwinian selection in one
paralogous copy.
We then compared the relative frequency of genes of different gene functions according to the Gene Ontology
(GO) classification. Figure 4 shows the number of genes

Overrepresentation of ATP-binding proteins and
transcription factors
The relative frequency of genes of a certain functions of all
fish genes under positive Darwinian selection (Figure 5)
shows that more ATP binding proteins and transcription
factors were found than could be expected based on the
number of ATP binding proteins and transcription factors
in general. A χ2 (df = 2) test (depicted in Figure 4) confirmed that ATP binding proteins, hydrolases, oxidoreductases, transferases, and transcriptions factors occur
significantly more often than could be expected by chance
(highlighted by asterisks in Figure 4). The proportion of
transcription factors detected in each species is on average
similar (~10%) to other species (Figure 3). Overall, the
majority of genes with divergent evolutionary rates
among species are DNA-, ATP- and protein-binding proteins and enzymes (Figure 5). A comparison of the rates of
Gene Ontology (GO) groups among the investigated fish
genes is provided in Figure 6. Some GO groups include
genes with divergent evolutionary rates only in zebrafish
and medaka (calmodulin binding proteins, iron binding
proteins, kinases, structural components, sugar binding
proteins and members of the Wnt signaling pathway). In
other GO groups the frequency of genes with divergent
evolutionary rates from both pufferfish species is higher
than 50% (e.g., calcium and copper ion binding proteins,
methyltransferases, oxidoreductases and peptidases).

Discussion
Our final data-set of genes that were recovered from all
four species included a total of 2466 orthologous duplicates. This number was mainly limited by the small
number of available Oryzias latipes sequences (4681). To
examine whether these genes evolved at faster or slower
evolutionary rates within one of the four fish species, relative rate tests were performed comparing each fish gene
with the orthologs in other fish genomes. The human
ortholog was used as outgroup. About two thirds of the
610 genes that showed significantly different evolutionary
rates in one or more fish species with respect to the others
showed a lower rate of molecular evolution for only one
fish species (especially in Oryzias latipes). This implies that

these genes are conserved in that particular lineage, most
likely as a result of purifying selection (Figure 3). This
high fraction of genes with a smaller genetic distance, i.e.
slower evolutionary rate, might be due to the fact that

and back mutations so that these genes could not be
homologized applying very stringent BLAST conditions
necessary for reliable annotations. However, we were able
to identify 220 genes that show a statistically significant
increased rate of molecular evolution. These genes presumably have been subjected to relaxed functional constraints. Genes, which did not accumulate more
mutations than the average, are likely to have been subjected to purifying selection and thus, were not free to
evolve. [43,47].

We found considerable numbers of genes under positive
Darwinian selection according to Hughes et al. [40] with
relaxed substitution rates at the amino acid level. It seems
that in such cases selection acted more strongly to conserve the amino acid sequence of a gene in a particular lineage, possibly to maintain their ancestral function. In
many cases, this function still seems to be shared with
tetrapods and their common ancestors. Remarkably, 66%
of the genes (Figure 5) that appear to have evolved under
positive Darwinian selection turn out to be binding proteins, especially transcription factors and ATP binding
proteins. Transcription factors represent on average ~10%
of genes with significantly higher or lower evolutionary
rates in each species, which is higher than the average proportion of transcription factors in vertebrate proteomes
(~3%) (according to the EBI Eukaryotic Genome database). When identified as deviating gene, then it was in
almost all cases because of a smaller rate of substitution,
suggesting that these genes are highly conserved in at least
one of the studied fish species. Mutations in a binding
domain, as well as in regulatory regions [48,49], for example in a transcription factor, could negatively effect the

expression of genes and therefore such mutations might
be selected against.
None of the detected genes show evidence of positive
selection using a dN/dS calculation following the method
of Yang [50]. Due to the age of the investigated species,
saturation might have blurred the signal of positive selection. However, a recent study [45] showed that the dR/dC
ration is influenced by the transition/transversion ratio
and amino acid composition of the investigated
sequences. Therefore, inferences on positive selection
based on this method should be treated cautiously.
A considerable high number of genes that have a higher or
lower evolutionary rates are somehow related to neural
development or functions of the brain. This might reflect
differences in behavior and cognitive abilities between the
investigated fish species.
We identified 49 new duplicated genes in this study,

cation [17,18,20,51]. Twenty-one of those show an
increased rate in only one of the fish paralogs in a particular fish lineage. In 14 of these cases the increase in rate is
likely to be the result of positive Darwinian selection
(Table 6). Increases in the evolutionary rate in one copy
could also be explained by the classical Ohno model of
gene evolution [52], which predicts that one copy will
evolve more rapidly at nonsynonymous sites compared to
the other, as an effect of their redundancy. Nevertheless, it
is difficult to demonstrate clear signs of positive Darwinian selection, when the duplication event is ancient [41].
For genes that show a faster evolutionary rate in one species and, in addition, evidence for positive Darwinian
selection, one might expect concomitant divergence in
function. On the other hand, for paralogs where positive
Darwinian selection could not be demonstrated and
where the evolutionary rates have not increased, one

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/20

might assume that these genes have been under purifying
selection or that these genes are about to lose their function according to the duplication-degeneration-complementation (DCC) model [30] due to the accumulation of
degenerative mutations. Therefore, such genes may have a
similar function or even be completely redundant functionally with respect to their ortholog. Although it might
seem unlikely that two duplicates of one ancestral genes
perform exactly the same function(s) after more than 300
million years of evolution [51,53], redundancy has been
shown to be widespread in genomes of higher organisms
[23-25].

copy of the duplicated genes, as a possible result of positive Darwinian selection, were most obvious in three cases
(Table 2): The nuclear LIM interactor-interacting factor is
an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulator that
acts globally to silence neuronal genes [54]. The syntaxin
binding protein 1 is a neural-specific, syntaxin-binding
protein that may participate in the regulation of synaptic
vesicle docking and fusion [55]. The hypothetical protein
DKFZp564D0478 is known to be expressed in the hippocampus of vertebrates, although nothing is known about
the function of this protein. Another positively selected
duplicated gene is the ubiquitin domain containing 1

(UBTD1). There is no significant increase in the rate of
evolution and it is only known that this protein is also
expressed in the hippocampus [56]. Other genes are single-copy genes mainly coding for enzymes. However, the
eukaryotic translation elongation factor I gamma gene
encodes for a subunit of the elongation factor-1 complex,
which is responsible for the delivery of aminoacyl tRNAs
to
the
ribosome.

rubripes as compared to the other four fish species. 74
(43%) of these genes are fish-specific duplicates. The total
number is higher than in Tetraodon, which might reflect
differences in sequence completeness. Positive Darwinian
selection could be detected for 10% of the duplicated
genes, most of which (70%) showed increased substitution rates in only one of the paralogs (Table 3): Syntaxin
3a is potentially involved in docking of synaptic vesicles
at presynaptic active zones. In mammals, this gene occurs
in different isoforms and is highly expressed in the larynx,
which is evolutionarily and developmentally derived
from branchial arches. The mitochondrial elongation factor G1 encodes one of the mitochondrial translation elongation factors [57]. The zinc finger protein 106 (ZFP106)
is a conserved transcription factor of unknown function.
However, its cDNA shares an extended region of identity
with the scr homology domain 3 binding protein 3
(Sh3bp3) cDNA encoding a protein implicated in the

insulin-signaling pathway [58]. In situ hybridization of
mouse embryos confirmed that ZFP106 is predominantly
expressed in tissues with high developmental activity of
either nuclear respiratory factor-1 (brown fat and developing brain) or myogenin (striated muscle). Jumonji
domain containing 2C is also a transcription factor containing PHD finger motifs [59]. PHD finger motifs are
zinc finger-like sequences found in nuclear proteins that
participate in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation and are present in a number of proto-oncogenes. The
TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) is a chaperone
belonging to the HSP90 family that expresses an ATPase
activity [60]. Remarkably, TRAP1 interacts with the C-terminal ends of the proteins encoded by both exostosin 1
(EXT1) and exostosin 2 (EXT2). EXT1 has apparently also
evolved under positive selection and was duplicated in
both examined pufferfish species. Leprecan-like 1 is a cartilage-associated protein precursor found in articular

chondrocytes and expressed in a variety of mammalian
tissues [61].

neurokines, that act as a regulator of immune and nervous
cells [72].

Again the detected single copy genes are generally coding
for a variety of enzymes. One exception is the protein
encoded by drebrin-like. It is a cytoplasmic actin-binding
protein thought to play a role in the process of neuronal
growth and to be a member of the drebrin family of proteins that are developmentally regulated in the brain.

Danio rerio
Of the 144 genes with faster or slower evolutionary rates
in Danio rerio, 38 belong to the group of duplicated genes.
Among those genes with significantly higher rates in only
one paralog (Table 4) are Cofilin 2, activin A type II receptor, Roundabout 1, GOT1, ARF4L, CBX3 and RAB25.
Cofilin 2 controls reversibly actin polymerization and
depolymerization in a ph-sensitive manner. It has the
ability to bind g- and f-actin in a 1:1 ratio of cofilin to
actin. It is the major component of intranuclear and cytoplasmic actin rods [73]. Activins are dimeric growth and
differentiation factors, which belong to the transforming
growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of structurally
related signaling proteins. Type II receptors are required
for ligand-binding and for expression of type I receptors
[74]. Roundabout 1 (ROBO1) encodes for an integral
membrane protein that is both an axon guidance receptor
and a cell adhesion receptor, and is involved in the decision by axons to cross the central nervous system midline
[75]. Glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme, which exists in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms, GOT1 and GOT2. GOT
plays a role in amino acid metabolism and the urea and
tricarboxylic acid cycles. The two enzymes are
homodimeric and show close homology [76]. The ADPribosylation factor 4-like is a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor family of GTP-binding proteins. ARF4L is
closely similar to ARL4 and ARL7 and each has a nuclear
localization signal and an unusually high guanine nucleotide exchange rate [77]. The protein encoded by the chromobox homolog 3 (CBX3) binds DNA and is a
component of heterochromatin. This protein can also
bind lamin B receptor, an integral membrane protein
found in the inner nuclear membrane. The dual binding
functions of the encoded protein may explain the association of heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane [78]. The gene encoding RAB25 may selectively
regulate the apical recycling and/or transcytotic pathways
[79]. Only little is known about the other genes detected
in Danio rerio. Most of the single copy genes represent
enzymes of varying function.

Pufferfishes
Out of a total of 265 genes, 33 appeared to show an accelerated rate of evolution for both species This relatively
high number is in concordance with the findings that, in
the Tetraodon genome neutral nucleotide sequence evolution per year is about twice as fast as in humans [6,62].
Thus, it might be possible that the genome of pufferfish
species evolves faster in general compared to other vertebrates, and possibly even other fishes. This could be
linked to the processes related to the extreme degree of
genome compaction in pufferfishes. In ten of the above
mentioned cases we were able to detect signals of positive
Darwinian selection (Tables 2 and 3).

One of the these 10 genes, the extracellular copper
enzyme Lysyl-oxidase-like-1 (LOXL-1) initiates the cross
linking of collagens and elastin in the process of building
and deposition of elastic fibers. LOXL-1 thus seems to
have an essential role in elastogenesis and resilience.
LOXL-1 Mutant mice have among other problems a defect
in elastic fiber renewal in adult tissues including the lower
dermis of the skin [63]. It is tempting to speculate that the
lower divergence of LOXL-1 in pufferfishes might be
explained by the importance of elasticity of tissues in
these species due to their ability to inflate as defense
mechanism [64-67]. In addition to cross-linking extracellular matrix proteins, the encoded protein may have a role
in tumor suppression [68]. Chloride intracellular channels are involved in chloride ion transport within various
subcellular compartments. The chloride intracellular
channel 5 gene (CLIC5) specifically associates with the
cytoskeleton of placenta microvilli [69]. As mentioned
before, one copy of EXT1 shows a higher rate of evolution
due to positive Darwinian selection. EXT1 is a transferase
involved in the chain elongation step of heparan sulfate
biosynthesis. It appears to be a tumor suppressor [70].
Examples of positively selected single copy genes in both
pufferfish species were 'twisted gastrulation' and TAFA2.
'Twisted gastrulation' encodes a secreted BMP-binding
protein that is a BMP signalling agonist in the dorsal-ventral patterning pathway [71]. The TAFA proteins are predominantly expressed in specific regions of the brain, and
are postulated to function as brain-specific chemokines or

Oryzias latipes
A total of 234 genes could be identified of genes with
divergent evolutionary rates specific to Oryzias latipes
when compared to the other fish species. Of those, only
14 were found to be duplicated. Only four genes with positive selected paralogs could be detected in Oryzias latipes
(Table 5). One of those, with an accelerated rate of evolution in one of the paralogs is the ephrin receptor EphA2,
which belongs to the ephrin receptor subfamily of the
protein-tyrosine kinase family. EPH and EPH-related

receptors have been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous system and
limb development [80]. The ephrin receptors are divided
into two groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding
ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands. This gene encodes a protein that binds ephrin-A ligands.
For two genes both paralogs show similar rates of evolution. The Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 is involved in
the proteolytic processing of endothelin-1, -2, -3 to biologically active peptides [81]. Ficolin 1 encoded by FCN1
is predominantly expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes, and has been postulated to function as a plasma
protein with elastin-binding activity [82].
Other genes are single-copy genes mainly coding for
enzymes with general functions. Remarkably, the number
of positive selected genes in Oryzias latipes is higher than
in the other investigated species and most of them have
low substitution rates compared to other fish. Selection
might thus act as maintenance for those genes and their
function.

Conclusion
We identified genes under positive Darwinian selection
using a combination of BLAST searches and phylogenetic
methods. With these methods we could also demonstrate
that the measurement of positive selection is a good
method to identify divergent fates of duplicated genes.
Most genes behave differently in particular species, which
implies that their function is somehow essential, and possibly of adaptive value, for the investigated fish species.
We identified 49 of previously unknown duplicated genes
where one of the paralogs is under positive Darwinian
selection and shows a significantly high rate of molecular
evolution whereas the other copy did not undergo such
dramatic changes, most likely due to purifying selection.
The fact that these duplicated genes show lineage specific
evolutionary rates in the investigated fish species suggests
that even after such a long time since the duplication
event these genes might still contribute to lineage specific
features. One might assume, that these genes therefore
play a role in the diversification of lineages. Models such
as the DDC model [30] might explain retention and functional divergence of anciently duplicated genes. It is also
possible that neofunctionalisation of one paralog
occurred. However, when subfunctionalisation is responsible for the functional divergence of genes, this is probably limited to differences in timing and tissue specificity
of expression. It has also been suggested that a proportion
of duplicate genes undergo rapid subfunctionalisation,
accompanied by prolonged and substantial neofunctionalisation [31]. So far, there is little evidence that the new
paralogs described here have completely novel functions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/20

However, in several cases we could detect a significant
increase in evolutionary rates in one of the duplicates.
This is probably not due to relaxed functional constraints
on the whole gene, but rather because duplicated genes
experience a brief period of relaxed selection after duplication [26,41]. Duplicates that are being retained over
longer evolutionary times are more likely to experience
strong purifying selection.

Methods
We used the database software EverEST 1.0 [83], which
allows database searches on the basis of the BLAST algorithm and tests the association of results and phylogenetic
analysis, making use of a relational database. Data sets of
protein data from Danio rerio (Zebrafish Sequencing
Group at the Sanger Institute, Zv4.0), EST data from
Oryzias latipes (GenBank), protein data from Takifugu
rubripes (JGI Fugu v3.0) and protein data from Tetraodon
nigroviridis (GenBank) were screened against genome data
from Homo sapiens (GenBank) using a translated BLAST
routine (standard vertebrate code) with an expected value
threshold of < 1 × 10-50. This relatively high value threshold was used in order to achieve high levels of confidence
in the similarity searches, although such a stringent
threshold might lead to the missing of some relevant
orthologs. The query sequence and all best hits of every
single search were aligned using the T-Coffee algorithm
[84] implemented in EverEST. The automated analysis is
depicted in Figure 1. Each sequence was tentatively
assigned Gene Ontology (GO) classification based on
annotation of the single 'best hit' match in BLASTX
searches of Homo sapiens proteins (e≤ 10-50). Annotations
described here are at the "inferred from electronic annotation" (IEA) level of evidence (The Gene Ontology Consortium 2001). Following the alignment, sequence
divergence for every possible human-fish pair was estimated in EverEST as the observed proportion of amino
acid sites at which the two sequences under comparison
were different (Poisson correction). All alignment positions with gaps were excluded previously (complete deletion). This option is generally desirable because different
regions of DNA or amino acid sequences often evolve
under different evolutionary forces.
The distances (relative p-distances) were used to construct
three-coordinate ternary representations (implemented in
EverEST) for cross-species comparisons to visualize species-specific genes as outliers. A relative rate test was
applied to each of the orthologous groups. We applied the
nonparametric rate test developed by [39] and implemented in MEGA 3.0 [85], and compared the genes with
their human and their fish orthologs. For orthologous
groups, where the p-distance between Homo sapiens and
fish amino acid sequences was significantly (p < 0.05)
higher or smaller compared to the other three fish species,

the ratio of the proportion of radical nonsynonymous difference (dR) per radical nonsynonymous site and the proportion of conservative nonsynonymous site (dC) was
calculated using the program SCR3 [40]. This was done to
evaluate the selective forces acting on those proteins. Conservative substitutions are amino acid replacements
remain constant with respect to charge or polarity, while
a substitution at a radical site involve amino acid replacements that changes charge or polarity [86]. In addition we
conducted dN/dS calculations using the method by [50]
implemented in PAML [87] for the 122 putative genes
under positive selection according to dR/dC.
When BLAST identified one or more putative fish
orthologs, protein sequences from all species were aligned
using T-Coffee [84]. For each alignment, a preliminary
tree was drawn. This tree facilitated the identification of
identical sequences, sequences that varied only in length,
and sequences within species that differed by few amino
acids, all of which were removed from the alignment. Very
similar sequences could be alleles at one locus or evidence
of recent tandem duplications. In either case they were not
likely to be important for our study of genome duplication. Phylogenies were reconstructed from the remaining
sequences using Poisson-corrected genetic distances and
the neighbor joining (NJ) algorithm [88] in MEGA 3.0
[85]. From these trees we identified sets of orthologous
genes (i.e. genes which occurred only in monophyletic
groups that matched the expected organismal topology).
Regions where the alignment was unambiguous were
retained and reanalyzed using NJ and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. For these last phylogenetic analyses
the most closely related human paralogs (identified from
the first NJ analyses) were used as outgroups. PHYML [89]
was used to reconstruct ML. The best fitting models of
sequence evolution for ML were obtained by ProtTest 1.2
[90].

To investigate whether or not one of the two fish paralogs
evolved at a faster rate since their duplication, a relative
rate test was applied to each of the genes. We applied the
nonparametric rate test developed by [39] and implemented in MEGA 3.0 [85], and compared the paralogs
with their human and another fish ortholog. The dR/dC
ratio was calculated between the paralogs using the program SCR3 [40] to evaluate the selective forces acting on
those.
