Abstract
Background: Identifying protein-protein interactions is fundamental for understanding the
molecular machinery of the cell. Proteome-wide studies of protein-protein interactions are of
significant value, but the high-throughput experimental technologies suffer from high rates of both
false positive and false negative predictions. In addition to high-throughput experimental data, many
diverse types of genomic data can help predict protein-protein interactions, such as mRNA
expression, localization, essentiality, and functional annotation. Evaluations of the information
contributions from different evidences help to establish more parsimonious models with
comparable or better prediction accuracy, and to obtain biological insights of the relationships
between protein-protein interactions and other genomic information.
Results: Our assessment is based on the genomic features used in a Bayesian network approach
to predict protein-protein interactions genome-wide in yeast. In the special case, when one does
not have any missing information about any of the features, our analysis shows that there is a larger
information contribution from the functional-classification than from expression correlations or
essentiality. We also show that in this case alternative models, such as logistic regression and
random forest, may be more effective than Bayesian networks for predicting interactions.
Conclusions: In the restricted problem posed by the complete-information subset, we identified
that the MIPS and Gene Ontology (GO) functional similarity datasets as the dominating information
contributors for predicting the protein-protein interactions under the framework proposed by
Jansen et al. Random forests based on the MIPS and GO information alone can give highly accurate
classifications. In this particular subset of complete information, adding other genomic data does
little for improving predictions. We also found that the data discretizations used in the Bayesian
methods decreased classification performance.

Background
Proteins transmit regulatory signals throughout the cell,

catalyze large numbers of chemical reactions, and are crucial for the stability of numerous cellular structures.

Interactions among proteins are key for cell functioning
and identifying such interactions is crucial for deciphering
the fundamental molecular mechanisms of the cell. As relevant genomic information is exponentially increasing
both in quantity and complexity, in silico predictions of
protein-protein interactions have been possible but also
challenging. A number of techniques have been developed that exploit combinations of protein features in
training data and can predict protein-protein interactions
when applied to novel proteins. Our study is motivated by
a study by Jansen et al. [1], who proposed a Bayesian
method to use the MIPS [2] complexes catalog as gold
standard positives and lists of proteins in separate subcellular compartments [3] as gold standard negatives. The
various protein features considered in this method
include time course mRNA expression fluctuations during
the yeast cell cycle [4] and the Rosetta compendium [5],
biological function data from the Gene Ontology [6] and
the MIPS functional catalog, essentiality data [2], and
high-throughput experimental interaction data [7-10].
The MIPS and Gene Ontology functional annotations are
used for quantifying the functional similarity between
two proteins. The MIPS functional catalog (or GO biological process annotation) can be thought of as a hierarchical tree of functional classes (or a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) in the case of GO). Each protein is either a member
or not a member of each functional class, such that each
protein describes a "subtree" of the overall hierarchical
tree of classes (or subgraph of the DAG in the case of GO).
Given two proteins, one can compute the intersection tree
of the two subtrees associated with these proteins. This
intersection tree can be computed for the complete list of
protein pairs (where both proteins of each pair are in the
functional classification), and thus a distribution of intersection trees is obtained. Then the "functional similarity"
between two proteins is defined as the frequency at which
the intersection tree of the two proteins occurs in the distribution. Intuitively, the intersection tree gives the functional annotation that two proteins share. The more
ubiquitous this shared functional annotation is, the larger
is the functional similarity frequency; the more specific
the shared functional annotation is, the smaller is the
functional similarity frequency. The essentiality data represents a categorical variable that denotes whether zero,
one or both proteins in a protein pair are essential. The
supplementary online material of [1]http://www.science
mag.org/cgi/data/302/5644/449/DC1/1 provides more
details about the quantification of these variables. Their
Bayesian method predicts protein-protein interactions
genome-wide by probabilistic integration of genomic features that are weakly associated with interactions (mRNA
expression, essentiality and localization). The model was
used for two separate predictions of probabilistic interactomes (PI), one of which (PIE) is built on four highthroughput experimental interaction data sets, and the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/154

other (PIP) on the mRNA expression, Gene Ontology,
MIPS functional and coessentiality data. Within the PIP
sub-network, different genomic features are assumed to
be independent in prior. In addition, this method
involved discretizing the raw data into groups and representing the two mRNA expression profiles (cell cycle and
Rosetta compendium data) by their first principal component for computational convenience.
Our current study focuses on assessing the contributions
of different types of genomic data towards predicting protein-protein interactions. This may help us to understand
which genomic features have the closest biological relationship with protein-protein interactions and hence to
construct a better prediction model. As prediction rules
involving less relevant information may have lower prediction accuracy, our analysis can give us insights into
how to construct more parsimonious models with comparable or better prediction accuracy. A potential disadvantage of the Bayesian network approach may be that the
data discretization can obscure information contained in
the raw genomic data. Thus, in addition to assessing the
information content of the data sources, we also propose
alternative non-Bayesian models that fully utilize the data
without discretization. These methods, such as logistic
regression and random forests, do not require prior
knowledge, and we can evaluate the importance of the different genomic features in the context of these methods.

Results and discussions
To accurately and quantitatively assess the information
contributions of different genomic features, we construct
in essence a simplified problem that has some but not all
of the elements of the original study. Here, we only look
at a subset of the data from [1] comprising the 18 million
protein pairs in total and approximately 8,000 gold standard positives and 2.7 million gold standard negatives. This
subset (see Additional File 1) contains 2,104 positives and
172,409 negatives. In this subset, we have complete information for each feature and we can thus quantitatively
assess the relative contributions of the different features
on this set. This data set can be downloaded from http://
bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/PPI. In doing so, we find
that some of the features have stronger influence on the
overall prediction. While this might be true for the larger
problem as well, there are a number of caveats that one
has to keep in mind, such as that the features that are
present in this subset might not be the strongest in the
whole set of 18 million protein pairs.
Alternative models
Here, we construct models for predicting protein-protein
interactions that, given the gold standards, are basically
dichotomous classifiers. Multiple logistic regression [11]
is one commonly used model for such an application

[12,13]. An alternative, more sophisticated supervised
learning approach that we apply is the random forest algorithm [14]. Note that, although not our focus here, all
these methods can be used to compute the estimated
probabilities for predicted protein-protein interactions.
Logistic regression
The logistic model has the advantage that it provides an
estimated probability that a pair of proteins interact, and
is readily available in standard statistical packages. In this
paper, the logistic regression analysis was generated using
PROC LOGISTIC in SAS/STAT software, Version 9 of the
SAS System. Moreover, we can evaluate the importance of
different genomic features by variable selections. Among
many available schemes, we chose stepwise variable selection that is widely used in standard packages. Stepwise
selection is a greedy search algorithm that selects variables
with the best marginal prediction power given the current
model. To quantify the importance of the predictor variables to the model fitting, we can use the deviance measure

-2(log L1 - log L0),
where L0 is the likelihood of the final model given by the
stepwise selection, and L1 is the likelihood of the reduced
model by removing all terms that involve the corresponding predictor variable from the final model. However, this
measure only considers the prediction power of variables
for the training sample but not for any random test samples. Therefore, this measure can be biased due to its
dependence on the training sample.
We consider, similarly as in [1], all the main effects and
interaction terms among the genomic features in the PIP
(indirect evidence for protein-protein interactions) and
the PIE (direct experimental protein-protein interaction
measurements) respectively. Table 1 presents all the terms
remained in the final model and their orders to enter the
final model. Table 2 shows the deviance measure of predictor variables. The Gavin data, Gene Ontology and
MIPS functional similarity features, and the cell cycle gene
expression data are the most important genomic evidences for predicting protein-protein interactions according to the deviance measure, whereas the three other highthroughput experimental data sets are less relevant or
even do not have significant effects to be included in the
final model. However, the logistic model is restricted by
its linear form and may not provide an optimal solution
to the prediction problem. And it will be more objective
to evaluate the variable importance according to its prediction accuracy for any random test samples. In the following, we present the results from using the random
forest, a more sophisticated supervised learning
algorithm.

Random forest
The "random forest" method [14] is a supervised learning
algorithm that has previously been successfully applied to
many genomic studies. It has been implemented in the
randomForest package of R [15]. A random forest is an
ensemble of many classification trees generated from
bootstrap samples of the original data. It is well known
that random forests avoid overfitting and usually have
better classification accuracy than classification trees. A
natural way to evaluate the importance of the feature variables with the random forest algorithm is to measure the
increase of the classification error when those variables
are permuted. Intuitively, the more important variables
will, when permuted, produce larger classification errors.
The importance score provided by the random forest is a
more accurate estimate of the classification error that considers the situation of random test samples. Therefore,
this importance score provides a more objective evaluation of the relative merit of different genomic features on

protein-protein interaction prediction. Moreover, the
intrinsic tree structure of the random forest easily takes
into account the interactions among the different variables and avoids complications caused by missing data that
occurred in many other modeling procedures.
We performed our random forest analysis by growing
5,000 trees. Figure 1 shows the importance measures of
the genomic evidences used in the random forest algorithm. The result agrees mostly with that of the logistic
regression in that the MIPS and Gene Ontology functional
similarity features are found to be very important,
whereas most of the high-throughput experimental data

sets have negligible effects. However, different from the
result from logistic regression, the Gavin data set is shown
to be less important than MIPS and Gene Ontology functional similarity features after considering the situation of
random test samples. These observations motivated us to
perform a more thorough information assessment of the
genomic evidences considered. We first compared the performance of different classification methods (random forest, logistic regression and Bayesian network), and then
evaluated the importance of the different genomic datasets within the framework the best method (the method
with the lowest classification error).

better performance of the random forest over the other
two and similar performances between logistic regression
and the Bayesian network.
Information assessment
Information assessment of different genomic data may
help us understand their relationship with protein-protein interactions, and form a guideline for future model
development.

MIPS and gene ontology functional similarity data
We saw that the MIPS and Gene Ontology functional similarities were the two most important information sources
under both the logistic regression and random forests
methods. Histograms of the MIPS and GO functional similarity data (Figures 3 and 4) show that they are very different for the gold standard positives and negatives;
protein pairs in the gold standard positives are associated
with smaller functional similarity values than the gold
standard negatives. This pattern explains why the functional similarity features have such a strong impact on
classification accuracy in the model fitting, as observed in
Figure 2. However, the vast number of protein pairs in the
gold standard negatives are likely to be those that have not
been thoroughly studied by researchers, and henceforth

Histograms of MIPS and Gene Ontology function data for gold standard positives and negatives
Histograms of MIPS and Gene Ontology function data for gold standard positives and negatives

are observed to belong to large functional categories that
actually should be further divided into more specific categories. This conjecture suggests that the information from
MIPS and Gene Ontology function data is possibly caused
by selection biases other than intrinsic biological relevance. It deserves further investigations of the relationship
between the gold standards and the MIPS and Gene
Ontology functional similarity data.
In the following paragraphs, we show quantitatively that
the MIPS and Gene Ontology functional similarities are
the dominating information contributors for predicting
protein-protein interactions, while other genomic features
have negligible benefit and can not provide credible predictions by themselves. We examine the performance of
random forests using three different genomic feature sets:

(i) all genomic features included, (ii) MIPS and Gene
Ontology functional similarities only, and (iii) genomic
features other than the MIPS and Gene Ontology
functional similarities. The random forest performance is
evaluated with the classification error (Err) defined as
follows.
Denote Err1 as the proportion of protein pairs misclassified in the gold standard positives, and Err2 the counterpart for the gold standard negatives. Then we define the
classification error as the average of Err1 and Err2.

Err =

Err1 + Err2

Err is a balanced error rate across gold standard positives
and negatives. Suppose the joint probability density functions of the predictor features X are f1(X) and f2(X) for the
gold standard positives and negatives, respectively.
Denote a classifier by C(X). Then the classification error
can be written as
1

Err = â« I[C( X) = 1] f1( X)dX + â« I[C( X) = 0] f2 ( X)dX ,
2

(1)

where I(A) is an indicator function equal to 1 when A is
true and 0 otherwise. A minimal classification error Errmin
can be computed by minimizing (1) across the space of X.
It is easy to see that

Errmin =

1
min( f1( X), f2 ( X))dX
2â«

is achieved at C(X) = I(f1(X) >f2(X)). With this formula, we
can estimate the optimal (minimum) classification error
based on any estimates of f1(X) and f2(X). In our study,
f1(X) and f2(X) are estimated by their empirical density
functions.
Table 3 presents the optimal classification error using the
MIPS and Gene Ontology functional similarity data. Using
the MIPS and Gene Ontology functional similarity data sets
alone results in a highly accurate classification with an optimal error of only 0.28%. Table 3 also shows the effects of
the data discretizations that were originally used in the
Bayesian network method ("grouped"). The significant discrepancy between optimal classification errors using the
raw data and the discretized data ("grouped") suggests that
the discretization causes serious loss of information.

Other genomic features
We also estimated the classification errors using the
other genomic features within the random forest framework. Table 4 shows that adding the other genomic evidences in the complete-information subset provides
only negligible benefit or even reduces the classification
accuracy.

Moreover, we compared the ROC curves (Figure 5) of the
random forest method using all genomic information,
only the MIPS and GO functional similarities, and the
genomic information other than MIPS and GO. Figure 5
shows that we barely gain any by considering other
genomic information if the MIPS and GO are available;
classifications without the MIPS and GO functional similarity data are poor on the complete-information subset.
Note, however, that the subset of full interaction data
which have the strongest expression correlations is not
necessarily the complete-information set considered.
Hence, we would expect that expression correlations
might be a stronger source of information in other
context.

Conclusions
In the restricted problem posed by the complete-information subset, we identified that the MIPS and Gene
Ontology functional similarity datasets as the dominating information contributors for predicting the proteinprotein interactions under the framework proposed in
[1]. Random forests based on the MIPS and GO information alone can give highly accurate classifications. In this
particular subset of complete information, adding other
genomic data does little for improving predictions. The
MIPS and GO information, however, is only available
for a small proportion of the ~18M protein pairs.
We considered alternative non-Bayesian methods such
as logistic regression and random forest for predicting
protein-protein interactions. These existing methods do
not require prior information needed for the Bayesian
approach, and can fully utilize the raw data without discretization. The logistic model performs similarly as the

Bayesian method in terms of classifications and, like the
Bayesian method, produces estimated probabilities that
two proteins interact. As a dichotomous classifier, the
random forest method outperforms the other methods
considered and efficiently uses the information,
although it is computationally more expensive. In particular, its importance measure provides a more objective
assessment of different genomic features on predicting
protein-protein interactions than simply considering
contributions to model fitting. These findings are motivation to look for other, more sensible data resources
and superior models.
We found that the data discretizations used in the Bayesian methods decreased classification performance. We
note here that the genomic features datasets investigated here themselves are highly processed versions of
the datasets they were derived from and that there may
be better ways to take the original data into account.
Another caveat is that the predictions might be just
defining groups of proteins that have the same genomic
properties as the protein complexes in the MIPS data.
This does not necessarily mean that they really represent
protein complexes. Rather, they may represent groups of
proteins that have the same properties as protein complexes.
In this analysis we have looked at the relative weights of
various features in predicting protein-protein interactions based on the previous study in [1]. We looked at a
particular subset of the data where we had complete
information and we were able to show that, for this particular subset of the full information, we are able to show
that the functional classification features in the MIPS
functional catalog and Gene Ontology were the most
informative and that particular machine learning algorithms, such as random forests were more effective than
Bayesian networks. However, one has to keep in mind
that in the full problem there is the issue of incomplete
information. On data sets with incomplete information
Bayesian approaches maybe more effective because they
can easily handle the missing information. Further careful studies such as these will be needed to determine
what the optimum machine learning method is and the
optimum features are in presence of incomplete information. It will be also of great interest to consider other
genomic features such as phylogenetic profiles [16] and
local clustering information [17]. This is just the first
step in that direction.

where the random vector X consists of X1, X2, ..., Xn and

Stepwise variable selection
The stepwise selection procedure starts from a null model.
At each step, it adds a variable with the most significant
score statistics among those not in the model, then
sequentially removes the variable with the least score statistic among those in the model whose score statistics are
not significant. The process terminates if no further variable can be added to the model or if the variable just
entered into the model is the only variable removed in the
subsequent elimination. Here, the score statistic measures
the significance of the effect of a variable.
ROC curve analysis
Receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve [18] is a
graphical representation used to assess the discriminatory
ability of a dichotomous classifier by showing the
tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is calculated by dividing the number of true positives (TP)
through the number of all positives, which equals the sum
of the true positives and the false negatives (FN); specificity
is calculated by dividing the number of true negatives
(TN) through the number of all negatives, which equals
the sum of the true negatives and the false positives (FP).

Sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN), Specificity = TN/(TN + FP).
The ROC curve plot shows 1 - specificity on the X axis and
sensitivity on the Y axis. A good classifier has its ROC curve
climbing rapidly towards upper left hand corner of the
graph. This can also be quantified by measuring the area
under the curve. The closer the area is to 1.0, the better the
classifier is; and the closer the area is to 0.5, the worse the
