Abstract
Background: Picoeukaryotes represent an important, yet poorly characterized component of marine
phytoplankton. The recent genome availability for two species of Ostreococcus and Micromonas has led to the
emergence of picophytoplankton comparative genomics. Sequencing has revealed many unexpected features
about genome structure and led to several hypotheses on Ostreococcus biology and physiology. Despite the
accumulation of genomic data, little is known about gene expression in eukaryotic picophytoplankton.
Results: We have conducted a genome-wide analysis of gene expression in Ostreococcus tauri cells exposed to
light/dark cycles (L/D). A Bayesian Fourier Clustering method was implemented to cluster rhythmic genes
according to their expression waveform. In a single L/D condition nearly all expressed genes displayed rhythmic
patterns of expression. Clusters of genes were associated with the main biological processes such as transcription
in the nucleus and the organelles, photosynthesis, DNA replication and mitosis.
Conclusions: Light/Dark time-dependent transcription of the genes involved in the main steps leading to protein
synthesis (transcription basic machinery, ribosome biogenesis, translation and aminoacid synthesis) was observed,
to an unprecedented extent in eukaryotes, suggesting a major input of transcriptional regulations in Ostreococcus.
We propose that the diurnal co-regulation of genes involved in photoprotection, defence against oxidative stress
and DNA repair might be an efficient mechanism, which protects cells against photo-damage thereby, contributing
to the ability of O. tauri to grow under a wide range of light intensities.

Background
Photosynthesis by picophytoplankton (cyanobacteria and
eukaryotic microalgae with a size < 2 μm) makes a significant contribution to global organic carbon production through carbon dioxide assimilation in the oceans.
Eukaryotic picophytoplankton has a world- wide distribution and is an important contributor to biogeochemical cycles [1,2]. Of picoeukaryotes, three abundant
ubiquitous genera from prasinophytes, Ostreococcus,
Bathycoccus and Micromonas have been the most studied [3]. The first picoeukaryote to be identified was
Ostreococcus tauri, a species initially identified as a
major component of the picophytoplankton in the Thau

lagoon [4]. O. tauri has been described as the smallest
free-living eukaryote with the simplest ultrastructure
that is one chloroplast, one mitochondrion, one Golgi
body in addition to the nucleus.
In recent years, several genomes of Ostreococcus have
been sequenced including O. tauri and Ostreococcus lucimarinus [5,6]. Two genomes of Micromonas became
available recently [7] and a deep strain of Ostreococcus
(RCC809) is now being sequenced. The analysis of
Ostreococcus genomes has led to several hypothesis about
physiological features, such as the occurrence of an atypical light harvesting complex and C4 photosynthesis [5,8].
An unusual high number of selenocysteine-containing
proteins and a reduction of chromatin protein have been
described in both strains of Ostreococcus but their significance is yet unknown [6]. Unusual features of O. tauri
and O. lucimarinus genomes include high gene density,

heterogeneous genome structure with two atypical chromosomes and high genome compaction. Analysis of gene
content and evolution rates have suggested that lack of
recombination and thus a lack of GC Biased Gene Conversion may be the origin of the lower GC content of the
atypical chromosomes [9]. Phylogenetic footprints size
distributions depend on gene orientation of neighboring
genes and suggest a lower frequency of bidirectional regulatory elements in promoters in Ostreococcus as compared to budding yeast [10]. Clustering of genes involved
in nitrogen assimilation on chromosome 10 suggest a
possible link between gene localization on chromosomes
and transcription. However all the above conclusions
were inferred exclusively from in silico studies and the
impact of genome structure on the transcription
mechanisms remains to be addressed.
Little is known on the biology and physiology of
eukaryotic picophytoplankton, which might explain
their ecological success. In budding yeast, a genomewide transcriptomic approach has revealed transcriptional networks associated with the temporal compartmentalization of cellular processes such as cell division
during the metabolic cycle [11]. We have recently
shown in Ostreococcus, that cell division is temporally
regulated in cells exposed to diurnal cycle [12]. Most
of the cell cycle regulators, including cyclin and cyclindependent kinase (CDK) family, were found to be transcriptionally regulated [12]. Therefore, to gain insight
in the biology and physiology of Ostreococcus as well as
the transcriptional basis of its genome structure, we
chose to conduct a genome wide temporal analysis of
gene expression in cells subjected to 12:12 day/night
cycles. Under these conditions genes were found to be
differentially expressed, most of them being regulated
by the photoperiod. This regulation was observed for
genes of both typical and atypical chromosomes. A
Bayesian Fourier analysis revealed that more than 80%
of differentially expressed genes had rhythmic patterns
of expression. A detailed analysis of 2038 genes with
strong diel rhythms of expression, yielded very welldefined time clusters with an abundance of genes
involved in specific biological processes such as DNA
replication, mitosis, translation, photosynthesis or lipid
metabolism. Noteworthy, co-transcriptional regulations
of genes involved in DNA repair and oxidative stress
generated by light as well as photosynthesis and photoprotection were found. Ostreococcus contains less than
200 transcription factors [13], most of them being
regulated by the photoperiod. This opens the way to a
much fuller understanding of how coordinated transcriptional networks regulate biology and physiology in
O. tauri and more generally in marine eukaryotic
picophytoplankton.

Results and Discussion
Expressed genes show a differential expression over
light/dark cycles

To identify genes with a diurnal rhythm, cells entrained
under 12:12 light/dark (L/D) cycles were sampled every
3 hours for 24 hours with two overlapping time points
at Time 9 (Light ON at Time 9; Light OFF at Time 21)
in 3 independent experiments [12]. Under these medium
light conditions (35 μmol quanta cm-2 s-1), cell division
is synchronized, occurring at the onset of night, and
most of cell cycle genes are regulated by the diurnal
cycle as checked by quantitative RT-PCR [12]. The
expression of each time point was compared to a pool
of all 3 kinetics 27 time points. Of the 8056 50 nt-long
oligonucleotides probes, 7025 (80%) gave a median value
of replicates 2.6 times above the background at least
once (n = 27). The 981 probes exhibiting a signal below
background may correspond to genes not expressed
under our light/dark condition. For example, genes
involved in sexual reproduction or in metabolic pathways active only under nutrient starvation are not
expected to be expressed during exponential growth. It
is also possible that some probes were designed against
genes that were not correctly annotated in the automatic annotation of the genome or that for technical
reasons some probes did not hybridize correctly to their
targets.
A 3-factor ANOVA (probe, kinetics of expression and
biological triplicate) identified 6822 probes corresponding to genes differentially expressed during the light/
dark cycle with a Pvalue < 10-3 (Fig 1A), among which
6610 probes gave a signal 2.6 fold over the background.
Biological triplicates were highly reproducible as
revealed by a principal component analysis (PCA) performed on the 27 time points and plotted on a correlation circle (Fig 1B). PCA on the individual 6822 gene
probes confirmed that the differential gene expression
over the time course (day/night, evening/morning)
accounts most of the variability observed (Fig 1C).
Fewer genes had their phase of expression 3 hours after
dusk (Time 0) suggesting a gap in transcription at that
time.
For subsequent analysis, we selected the 2038 gene
probes with best dispersion after PCA as well as pools
of genes selected according to their relative expression
levels in the ANOVA set. Table 1 shows the number of
gene probes, which exhibit diurnal changes according to
their amplitude. Very high amplitudes in gene expression up to Δlog2 ratio = 9 were observed. Of 537 gene
probes with Δlog2 ratio >5, 535 were selected after PCA
and only 54 showed a two-to four fold induction
(Table 1). In Figure 2, relative hierarchical gene expression is represented for three sets of genes, namely the

with differential expression over 3 LD cycles with a Pvalue < 10-3.

expressed.

PCA set (2038 probes), ANOVA set1 (2<Δlog2 ratio<6),
ANOVA set2 (1<Δlog2 ratio<2). Waves of transcription
were observed with phases corresponding to various
times of the day over three LD. Globally all genes
selected after ANOVA, had reproducible profiles of
expression over three 12:12 LD cycles.
Amongst the TOP50 genes expressed with highest
amplitude, three classes of genes were found (1) those
involved in the cell division cycle, UV response and pigment biosynthesis, (2) those involved in metabolism
including Krebs Cycle, (3) the last class contains and
regulators of protein synthesis (Additional file 1). These
genes encode mainly regulatory proteins whose expression is restricted to specific times of the day, such as
CyclinB. In contrast, genes with the highest median
expression values over the LD cycle are related to
photosynthesis and ribosome structure (Additional file
2). These genes are well expressed housekeeping genes
with low amplitude of expression or genes highly transcribed at specific times of the day such as the ribulose
1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase (RubisCo).

Both Ostreococcus genomes present unique features
such as gene compaction with intergenic regions below
200 bp in size and several examples of gene fusions.
Genome heterogeneity was reported in both O. tauri
and O.lucimarinus genomes. In O. tauri, chromosome2
(Chr2) and chromosome19 (Chr19) have a significantly
biased G+C content, unusual introns and contain most
of the transposons-like elements. Furthermore these
chromosomes in both species show lower levels of synteny and different gene densities compared to the other
chromosomes [6]. Because of their structure, genes on
atypical chromosomes are good candidates for recent
horizontal gene transfer from bacteria into Ostreococcus
[6] In a such a scenario, genes located on chromosome
regions of bacterial origin may have kept signatures of
prokaryote transcription, which is organized in operons.
We focussed on the transcription patterns of genes
located on atypical chromosomes (Figs 3A and 3B).
Day/night oscillations of transcript levels were observed
for genes of typical chromosomes such as Chr1) and
atypical chromosomes such as Chr2 as shown in Hierarchical clustering (HCl) (Fig 3B). PCA on Chr2 yielded
a similar day/night partitioning as for the whole genome
(Fig 3A) and did not reveal heterogeneity in gene
expression between the genes from the two halves of
Chr2. Overall, clustering of transcription patterns based
on chromosome localisation (PC) did not reveal major
differences between the transcription patterns of genes
localized on atypical chromosomes and other chromosomes (Fig 3B). Therefore, if genes belonging to atypical
chromosomes are of prokaryote origin, they must have
fully integrated eukaryotic mechanisms of transcription,
so that they are transcribed as autonomous units. Operons have no been identified in Ostreococcus, however
genes involved in nitrate, ammonium and urea clustered
in a chromosome region of 19 kpb [5]. Patterns of

values in green. The signals were normalized to the average level of

transcriptions of this chromosome area covered different
phases of the day, indicating that these genes are not
transcriptionally coregulated. Together our data did not
reveal any obvious link between gene localization on
chromosomes and the photoperiod-regulated transcription in O. tauri, suggesting that both typical and atypical
chromosomes have canonical eukaryotic mechanisms of
transcription.
The genes located on the lower G+C content regions
of Chr2 and Chr19 have been shown to evolve significantly faster than the other genes[9]. This may be the
consequence of lack of recombination or increased
mutation rate on these chromosomes. Transcription has

been shown to be mutagenic in some species. Genes
located on atypical chromosomes with low GC contents,
did not exhibit unusual mechanisms of transcription,
suggesting that transcriptional induced mutation bias is
unlikely to be the origin of the lower GC content of
these chromosomes.
In summary, despite the compactness and heterogeneity of its genome, O. tauri does not appear to exhibit
unusual mechanisms of transcription related to its genome structure.

Bayesian Fourier analysis reveals rhythmic patterns of
expression associated with specific biological processes

A Bayesian clustering method based on Fourier coefficients allowed us to discriminate putative regulatory
genes [14]. This method is well-understood, rapid, and
flexible [15]. The Fourier coefficients capture the rhythmic properties of interest to us by measuring the contribution of sine and cosine waves with differing periods
to the rhythmic patterns in the data. We used an
agglomerative hierarchical algorithm for clustering of
gene expression patterns, based on the Fourier coefficients (see Materials and methods). This method discriminates among rhythmic patterns based on the
amplitude and waveform, in addition to the phase.
Photoperiod-regulated expression profiles were identified by the dominant contribution of the sine and cosine
waves with a 24-h period. For computational reasons,
only the first, third, sixth and ninth harmonics, along
with the constant term, were included, yielding 9 parameters. Moreover, a direct BFC analysis could not be
performed on all 6822 differentially expressed genes due
to memory space limitation. Therefore, three pools of
randomly selected genes were generated for BFC analysis and analyzed separately.
BFC discriminates patterns based on waveform, phase
and amplitude. In our analysis, the third harmonic ratio
(THR) was chosen to assess rhythmicity (see Materials
and Methods). Clusters were scored as rhythmic for
THRs value above 0.4 [14]. We identified out of 489
clusters, 433 with a THR above 0.4 corresponding to
5977 probes (86% of the probes). We therefore concluded that genes identified as differentially expressed
correspond to rhythmically expressed genes. Genome
wide regulation of gene expression by the photoperiod
has been described in cyanobacteria [16]. In the unicellular eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas, only 2.6%
of the genes were shown to be under circadian control
[17]. Several studies in diatoms have reported global
transcriptome changes in response to iron or silicon
starvation [18,19], however our study is the first example of a global regulation of transcription by the photoperiod in eukaryotic phytoplankton. Such a global
rhythmicity of transcription resembles the waves of
transcription observed during the metabolic cycle of
budding yeast [11]. In the plant Arabidopsis more than
30% of the transcripts were shown to be regulated by
the photoperiod [20] and enhancer trap suggests that
36% of the genes are under circadian control [21]. A
recent study has revealed that 89% of Arabidopsis genes
cycle in at least one condition of LD, circadian or thermocycles [22]. In our single LD 12:12 condition,
expressed genes in O. tauri display rhythmic expression
patterns over the time, consistent with a global regulation of transcription under light/dark cycles.

A first analysis of BFC clusters did not allow the identification of clusters associated with specific biological
processes. We therefore decided to focus on the genes
with robust rhythms of expression selected after PCA.
A large number of clusters (138) was generated and the
size of each cluster was relatively small (2 to 50 probes).
Only one cluster containing 2 probes had a THR value
under 0.4 and 1893 probes belong to clusters with THR
values above 0.6, confirming that the selected genes had
robust rhythms of expression. Consistently with the
results of the PCA (Fig 4A), fewer genes fell in BFC
clusters around time 0 confirming a gap in transcription
at this time of the day. Because the size of the clusters
was small, each cluster was examined individually. For
this analysis we used the annotation of Ostreococcus
genome primarily based on KOGG classes together with
an annotation based on Arabidopsis non redundant
database (see Materials and methods). BFC clustering
revealed biological processes associated with specific
clusters. Transcriptional coregulation of genes encoding
mitochondrial/plastidial ribosomal protein is one the
most striking example of a transcriptional network regulated by the photoperiod (Fig 4B). For example, cluster
14 contains 26 probes of which eleven encode 70S plastid/mitochondria ribosomal protein. Cluster 18
(9 probes), which has an almost identical profile as cluster 14 has 3 plastid/mitochondria proteins and a chloroplast related IF2 translation initiation factor. Several
genes involved in 80S ribosome biogenesis including
RNA polymerase III, were overrepresented in Clusters
50 and 21 (Fig 4B).
Classification of gene clusters according to their phase
of expression (Fig 5A) revealed that transcripts involved
in specific biological processes, were associated with certain time intervals during the day. For example, most
genes implicated in protein synthesis had their phase of
expression around dawn while replication genes peaked
3 hours before night and mitosis genes at dusk (Fig 5A).
To our knowledge, such a coregulation of biological
processes has never been observed to this extent in
eukaryotic cells exposed to 24 h light/dark cycle. This
gave us a unique opportunity to obtain insight into the
biology and physiology of O. tauri based on transcription profiling of the genome expression under light/dark
conditions where most genes are expressed.
The sequential transcription of genes involved in RNA
synthesis/processing and ribosome biogenesis during the
night, translation and amino-acid synthesis at dawn

Midnight clusters such as 111, 67 and 12 contain predominantly genes involved in basic transcription machinery, however the main transcription clusters peaked in
late night between time 5 and 8 (Figs 5A and 5B). They
include RNA polymerase II, splicing (U4/U6 small

specific transcriptional networks are associated with DNA replication and mitosis.

ribonucleoprotein Prp4, splicing factor PRP31), mRNA
cleavage and polyadenylation factor, polyA binding protein, nuclear cap binding proteins as well as RNA helicases, RNA methyltransferases and DNA topoisomerases
(Additional file 3). Most transcription clusters had similar profiles, although some small differences were
observed such as between clusters 111/67, 61/54 and
29/42. The genes encoding proteins involved in 60S
cytoplasmic ribosome biogenesis and ribosomal RNA
(RNA pol III) peaked 3 hours before light ON in two
clusters with nearly identical shapes (Clusters50/21),
suggesting that ribosomal proteins and ribosomal
RNA are transcriptionally coregulated (Fig 5A, B, see
also Fig 4A). This contrast with the large clusters of
genes involved in the biogenesis of 70S ribosome,
which are expressed 3 hours after dawn, and suggests
that the translational processes might be temporally
uncoupled in the cytoplasm and the organelles, the second occurring during the light period. Interestingly,
18 plastidial ribosomal genes were reported to be
under circadian control with a similar morning phase in
Chlamydomonas [17].
Many genes involved in the regulation of translation,
tRNA and aminoacid synthesis had a phase of expression at dawn (Fig 5; Additional file 4). Six regulators of
translation, including Translation initiation eIF-4G,
eIF-3, eIF-3f, the translational repressor Pumilio/PUF3
and related RNA-binding protein and translation ribosome release factor APG3 as well as tRNAs were mainly
found in clusters 39/10 7 and 92, suggesting further a
possible regulation of protein synthesis at dawn.
It is tempting to speculate that the sequential expression of transcription and translation basic machinery,
after a gap in global transcription early in the night,
may anticipate dawn to ensure a tight regulation of protein synthesis from that time.
DNA replication and DNA repair genes are coregulated

In Ostreococcus, cell division is synchronized by the photoperiod and several S phase genes were shown to be
express at the end of the light period [12]. Ten clusters
with phases between time 16.5 and 17.5 were enriched in
genes related to DNA replication (Fig 5; Additional file 5).
The Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), a well
known S phase marker, was found in these clusters.
Within these 50 S-phase genes, a majority (33) was related
to DNA replication, including sister chromatin cohesion
proteins, MCM and Origin Recognition complex (ORC),
DNA polymerase and Ribonuclease H1. DNA replication
clusters contained also thymidine kinase and ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which are involved in nucleotide
synthesis. Interestingly genes involved in DNA mismatch
repair from MLH2/PMS1/Pms2 family, ATR/Tel1 kinase
involved in DNA damage signalling or RAD17 had similar

Page 8 of 13

transcript profiles as DNA replication genes. Like many
phytoplanktonic species Ostreococcus cells are exposed to
DNA damage due to UV exposure. In our experiment
cells were grown at relatively low light intensity (35 μmol
quanta cm-2 s-1) lacking UV. It is therefore likely that the
transcription of DNA repair genes is directly regulated by
the photoperiod and/or by the circadian clock rather than
by light intensity. Such a mechanism would be efficient for
anticipating photo-damage and repairing DNA upon UV
exposure during the day.
Several genes involved in chloroplast division such as
FtsZ and ARC5 were also detected in S phase clusters.
Such a regulation might ensure the coordination of
nuclear and chloroplast division, which takes place during nuclear DNA replication.
Oxidative stress defence and photoprotection genes

We were unable to identify any conventional catalase in
the genome of O. tauri suggesting that Ostreococcus
uses an alternative mechanism to detoxify reactive oxygen species. Several genes involved in oxidative stress
defence (thioredoxins) and against damaging light environments (Non Photochemical quenching 1) were found
in cluster 85, 3 hours after dawn (Fig 5; Additional file
6). Likewise the transcriptional coregulation of UVR3-64 photolyase involved in DNA repair upon UV exposure
and the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase known to
detoxify reactive oxygen species (cluster 27) might be
involved in protection against photo-damage.
Carotenoids pigments including violaxanthin, zeaxanthin and lutein, which protect cells from photo-oxidative damage, have been described in O. tauri [23].
Interestingly, phytoene desaturase, a precursor enzyme
in carotenoid biosynthesis upstream of violaxanthin and
zeaxanthin synthesis and zeaxanthin epoxidase, violaxanthin-de-epoxidase and Cytochrome P450 reductase is
in cluster7, which also contains enzymes involved in
DNA repair such as formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Additional file 6). Our light intensity condition is
more than 10 times lower than intensities O. tauri can
survive [23]. Therefore, it is likely that genes involved in
photoprotection and defence against oxidative stress
generated by light are directly regulated by the photoperiod or by the circadian clock rather by light intensity.
This regulation would allow O. tauri to anticipate predictable daily high light intensities encountered in the
environment and account for its capacity to grow under
relatively high light intensities [24].
Coregulation of genes involved in mitosis

Mitosis is atypical in O. tauri since the nuclear envelope
does not break down, no chromosomes have been
observed and at the most two microtubules were seen
using electron cryotomography [25]. The cell division

Monnier et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:192
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/192

cycle per se (SG2 M) is short in O. tauri and lasts less than
3 hours leading to a partial overlap of cell cycle phases in
cell populations synchronized by light/dark cycles [26].
However at time 12 most of the cell undergo cytokinesis
as cell number is increasing and the proportion of G2 M
cells is decreasing compared to G1 cells. Consistently, several clusters (36, 62, 71 and 77) peaking at time 12 contained mitotic genes such as chromosome condensation
complex condensins and Structural Maintenance of Chromosome2 (SMC2), a gene required for chromosome segregation (Fig 5; Additional file 7). Tubulin, including
gamma-tubulin, and microtubule associated motor proteins such as kinesins were expressed at the time of mitosis, even though a mitotic spindle has never been observed
in Ostreococcus. Well known regulatory proteins of mitosis
such as B-type cyclin, CDK subunit1, the Haspin mitotic
histone kinase required for metaphase chromosome alignment or the mitotic checkpoint kinase Bub1 and Aurora
kinase were also identified in these clusters.
Again, two genes encoding peroxide detoxifying
enzymes ascorbate and gluthatione peroxidases were
transcribed together with mitotic genes suggesting that
they might be important to protect DNA against oxidative damage at the time of division.
Surprisingly ferritin was maximally expressed at the
time of mitosis. In the oceans iron is often a limiting
factor for phytoplankton growth and ferritin was shown
to confer an ecological advantage to pennate diatoms
[27]. In Ostreococcus ferritin might be important for
iron storage at the end of the day since iron is found
mainly associated to the photosynthetic apparatus in the
chloroplast during the day.
The presence of several genes involved in Golgi-derived
secretion such annexin, spectrin and callose synthase in
mitotic clusters suggests that they might be related to the
massive secretion of Golgi-derived material observed at
the time of cell division. The nature of secreted molecules at the time of division is unknown but the secretion
of polysaccharides such as callose might be linked to the
absence of cell wall in Ostreococcus. Several clusters
enriched in secretion genes such as guanine nucleotide
exchange factor, vesicle coat complex COPII or protein
transport SEC61 had an earlier phase around time 3
(Fig 5). Whether their expression is related to cell cycle
progression remains to be determined.
Coregulation of photosynthesis and lipid metabolism
genes

Aside two nearly identical clusters (C33/C6) with a late
night phase of expression at 7 hours after light ON,
other photosynthesis clusters had a mid-day phase of
expression (Figure 5; Additional file 8; Additional file 9).
C33/C6 late night clusters contained genes involved in
chloroplast biogenesis (GcpE chloroplast biogenesis4;

Page 9 of 13

chloroplast Biogenesis 6), photosystem I assembly protein Ycf4 and precursors of chlorophyll and carotenoid
biosynthesis such as geranylgeranyl reductase (Additional file 8). Interestingly, these clusters were also
enriched in genes related to lipid biosynthesis and storage such as phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, delta
6-fatty acid desaturase/delta-8 sphingolipid desaturase,
delta12-fatty acid dehydrogenase desaturase, Fatty acid
biosynthesis I, oxysterol binding protein or patatin.
Genes belonging to Calvin cycle (phosphoribulokinase),
glycolysis (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase) and pentose phosphate pathway
(Ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase) were also identified in these clusters. These genes may be mainly under
circadian rather than direct light control since their
expression anticipates dawn. Such a mechanism might
be used to optimize light assimilation from dawn. The
soluble starch synthase III (SSIII), a key enzyme
involved in the synthesis of the long glucan fraction, is
required for circadian rhythm of starch content, which
peaks in the middle of the night phase in Chlamydomonas [28]. The photoperiod/circadian regulation of starch
content is currently unknown in Ostreococcus. Based on
the phase of SSIII transcript(cluster33), it would not be
surprising to find a circadian regulation of starch content in Ostreoccocus like in Chlamydomonas.
On the other hand many genes involved in chlorophyll
biosynthesis and light harvesting complex genes were
found in separate well defined clusters with an afternoon
phase at Time 14 (Additional file 9) suggesting that they
are controlled by distinct transcriptional networks.
Transcriptional regulation of transcription factors

A vast majority of Ostreococcus genes appear to be regulated by the photoperiod. Only 183 transcription factors
were identified in O. tauri, amongst which 170 were
expressed. Like other genes, they had reproducible
rhythmic patterns of expression, with all phases of the
day being represented (Additional file 10). Transcription
factors such as MAD-Box being present as a single
member were expressed only at certain times of the day.
Assuming that transcript levels reflect the level of protein, this would suggest that either their activity is
restricted to specific times of the day or that their protein are present at steady state levels, which are not correlated to the level of transcripts. In case of multigenic
families, such as HMG all phases of expression were
observed. Interestingly, 5 out of 7 CCAAT-HAP3 and
CCAT-HAP5 had very similar pattern of expression,
peaking at the end of the day, suggesting that CCATdependent transcription may be more active at this time
of the day. Comparisons of transcription patterns of
genes containing CCATT boxes in their promoter may
help to address this question.

Conclusions
Most of expressed genes of O. tauri appear to be transcriptionally regulated under light/dark cycles and display
robust rhythms of expression. In addition, high resolution Bayesian Fourier Clustering analysis revealed the
occurrence of transcriptional networks associated with
specific biological processes such as transcription, translation, photosynthesis and cell division. This should allow
the identification of new genes involved in specific processes or interconnected transcriptional networks. For
example the coregulation of genes involved in DNA
replication, DNA repair and photoprotection may
account for the ability of O. tauri to grow under a wide
range of medium to high light intensities. Together the
limited set of transcription factors, the small size of intergenic regions and the availability of sequences of several
Ostreococcus ecotypes, should make possible to identify
response elements in promoters of coregulated genes.
Genetic transformation was recently developed and used
to characterize a conserved circadian Evening Element in
the promoter of the Ostreococcus Time of CAB Expression-1 clock gene [29]. Future transcriptomic studies
coupled to phylogenetic footprint and functional analysis
should give insight into the transcriptional networks
involved not only in diurnal regulation of gene expression
but also in response to specific stresses of the marine
environment such as phosphate, nitrogen or iron limitation, UV stress or in response to viral infection.
Methods
Slides construction and hybridization

Genome-wide based Ostreococcus slides (24 K) were manufactured in the Genopole Ouest Transcriptome Platform
(Rennes, France). Gene-specific 50-mer oligonucleotides
(8,056) were designed and synthesized by Eurogentec on
the basis of January 2006 annotation. In the final annotation of the genome (June 2006, http://bioinformatics.psb.
ugent.be/blast/public/?project=ostreococcus), 6369 genes
were represented by at least one probe (5435 by a single
probe, 791 by two probes, 116 by 3 probes and 27 by
more than 4 probes) but 565 oligonucleotides did not
match the genome anymore in BlastN. However 372 out
these 565 probes gave a good and reproducible hybridization signal, were selected after ANOVA as differentially
expressed genes (see below). Therefore each probe was
attributed a feature number with corresponding numbers
in the two annotations. Cell culture conditions, RNA
extraction, labelling, hybridization and raw analysis have
been previously described [12].
Microarray data analysis

Normalization was performed using the print-tip loess
method and scaled with the Gquantile method [30,31].

Page 10 of 13

Time courses of gene expression were performed in triplicate, over 27 h, at 3 h intervals (nine time points per time
course). Fifteen probes, where on more than 70% time
points no data are available, were removed from the analysis. We first verified hybridization robustness by performing a hierarchical clustering on the 8041 selected probes
using TiGRMeV4.0 suite [32]. Technical triplicates were
clustered. Therefore, for further analysis, we chose to
work on the median value of each technical triplicate.
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were performed using the GeneANOVA software [33] and the limma (R package) from
bioconductor [34]. 6822 genes differentially expressed
with a P value < 10-3 were selected using a 3 factors
(genes, biological kinetics and biological replicates)
ANOVA. Correlations were found between gene expression and time points with PCA and we retained 2038
genes with best dispersion corresponding to maximized
variance. Twelve gene expression clusters were highlighted with SOM 2D (Self organizing Map) provided in
TiGRMeV4.0 suite (Current metric = pearson correlation) and analysed using FATIGO based on Arabidopsis
functional annotation. Qualitative information was
obtained about biological processes associated with specific times of the day. However, only a small number of
homologues of Arabidopsis annotated genes were found.
For this reason, these clusters were not further analyzed.
Bayesian Fourier Clustering (BFC) was used to cluster
time series according to their expression profiles using
the framework of a standard linear model [14]. Curves
were clustered together by BFC if they appeared to have
been drawn from a joint distribution with parameters b
and s2 , where Y = Bb + ε and Y represents the logarithm of the expression levels. ε is a noise term, which
is normally distributed with mean zero and variance s2.
Thus the skewed time course of expressions of genes in
each cluster is characterized by a different vector of
Fourier coefficients b and associated variance s2. This
technique is therefore a powerful way of uncovering a
wide variety of shapes and respects the time ordering of
expressions. This method was exceptionally fast because
of the choice of distributions on the parameters [35],
the settings of the hyperparameters [15] and the hierarchical search among partition spaces. Each gene
expression profile was initially assigned to an individual
cluster. Then the two clusters most similar in covariance
structure were merged to produce a new set of clusters.
The process on the current set of clusters was repeated
until all profiles lie in a single cluster. At each merger,
the clustering was scored; the highest score was
obtained for a partition of the 2038 gene probes into
138 clusters. Our flexible C++ code enabled us to apply
the above model to the O. tauri data without the

multistage clustering, which can cause the undesired
loss of genes [14]. The design matrix B was customised
and chosen to contain Fourier basis functions to help in
the identification of rhythmic genes. The vector b holds
the Fourier coefficients for the average profile of each
cluster. For computational reasons and given the nature
of the data, only the first, third, sixth and ninth harmonics, along with the constant term, were included. These
values produced the average profile seen as the blue line
in Figure 4(B) and in the Supplementary Figures. Clusters were identified by dominance of the harmonic associated with a high 24-hr diurnal component relative to
other harmonics. Adapting a statistic used in Edwards et
al. (2006) we measured the strength of the diurnal variation of the 3-day experiment by the third harmonic ratio

Genes in the final KOG based genome annotation
(June 2006) corresponding to O. tauri probe sequences
were blasted (BLASTX) on Arabidopsis non redundant
database to identify Arabidopsis closest orthologue.
Identification of biological processes associated with
BFC clusters was done on the basis of both annotations.
