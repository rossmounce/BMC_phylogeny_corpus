Abstract
Background: Molecular evolutionary studies in mammals often estimate nucleotide substitution
rates within and outside CpG dinucleotides separately. Frequently, in alignments of two sequences,
the division of sites into CpG and non-CpG classes is based simply on the presence or absence of
a CpG dinucleotide in either sequence, a procedure that we refer to as CpG/non-CpG assignment.
Although it likely that this procedure is biased, it is generally assumed that the bias is negligible if
species are very closely related.
Results: Using simulations of DNA sequence evolution we show that assignment of the ancestral
CpG state based on the simple presence/absence of the CpG dinucleotide can seriously bias
estimates of the substitution rate, because many true non-CpG changes are misassigned as CpG.
Paradoxically, this bias is most severe between closely related species, because a minimum of two
substitutions are required to misassign a true ancestral CpG site as non-CpG whereas only a single
substitution is required to misassign a true ancestral non-CpG site as CpG in a two branch tree.
We also show that CpG misassignment bias differentially affects fourfold degenerate and noncoding
sites due to differences in base composition such that fourfold degenerate sites can appear to be
evolving more slowly than noncoding sites. We demonstrate that the effects predicted by our
simulations occur in a real evolutionary setting by comparing substitution rates estimated from
human-chimp coding and intronic sequence using CpG/non-CpG assignment with estimates
derived from a method that is largely free from bias.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that a common method of assigning sites into CpG and non
CpG classes in pairwise alignments is seriously biased and recommends against the adoption of ad
hoc methods of ancestral state assignment.

Background
In mammals, the methylated form of cytosine (5-methylcytosine or 5mC) is hypermutable [1]. 5mC is formed by
the enzyme DNA methyltransferase operating on a cytosine occurring immediately 5' of a guanine. One effect of
methylation is to increase the rate of spontaneous deami-

nation of 5mC to form thymine. It has been estimated
that transitions in the methylated CpG dinucleotide occur
8–16 times faster than non-CpG transitions [2-4]. A
smaller elevation of the rate of transversion mutation at
the CpG dinucleotide has also been observed [3,5,6]. It
has been suggested that CpG mutability in mammals

underwent an abrupt elevation sometime around the
mammalian radiation (~90 Myr; ref [2]), possibly in
response to invasion by rapidly replicating transposable
elements [7].
As a result of this hypermutability, molecular evolution
studies have frequently attempted to estimate CpG and
non-CpG substitution rates by separating observed substitutions into those that are inferred to have occurred
within and outside CpG dinucleotides. In many previous
studies [8-16], any nucleotide occurring within a CpG (i.e.
either the constituent "C" or "G" of a CpG) or opposite a
CpG (i.e. a site that, whilst not necessarily occurring
within a CpG dinucleotide, is aligned with the "C" or "G"
of a CpG dinucleotide in an orthologous sequence) has
been inferred to have been an ancestral CpG site. We hereafter refer to this process as CpG/non-CpG assignment.
Although CpG/non-CpG assignment is likely to be biased,
it is generally assumed that this bias will be negligible if
two sequences are closely related. Furthermore, some
studies that employed this assignment procedure in the
analysis of protein-coding sequence have suggested that
while the overall rate of substitution is higher at synonymous sites, both CpG and non-CpG synonymous substitution rates are substantially lower than substitution rates
in noncoding DNA [10,14]. This has been interpreted as
evidence of purifying selection at synonymous sites.
However, denoting a site as ancestrally CpG based on the
presence of a CpG in one of two extant species is clearly
biased: this method of ancestral state assignment implies
that misclassification of an ancestral non-CpG as CpG in
two lineages requires only a single change whereas a minimum of two changes, one in each lineage, must occur to
misclassify an ancestral non-CpG as CpG (Figure 1). This
is problematic because the probabilities of each misclassification will rarely equal each other and are conditional
on the level of divergence of the two sequences in ques-

tion. Furthermore, this bias may affect fourfold degenerate and noncoding sites differentially, since there are
substantial compositional differences between synonymous and noncoding sites that arise, at least in part,
because of the constraints imposed by the genetic code.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of
misassignment of ancestral CpG state on the estimation of
nucleotide substitution rates and how the level of misassignment varies with CpG hypermutability and evolutionary divergence. We deal explicitly with rates of nucleotide
substitution between species.

Results
CpG/non-CpG assignment bias at mutational equilibrium
We first studied the simplest case of DNA sequences that
had been evolved to approximate mutational equilibrium. DNA sequences were evolved to approximate mutational equilibrium by generating a random sequence and
evolving until each site had experienced on average ten
substitutions [17]. Two sequences derived from this
ancestor were then evolved to a preset divergence. Pairwise divergence at CpG and non-CpG sites was then estimated using CpG/non-CpG assignment. It is clear that
CpG/non-CpG assignment seriously compromises the
accuracy of estimation of both the number of CpG and
non-CpG changes, most notably in minimally-diverged
sequences (Figure 2). Here, the number of true CpG
changes is overestimated and the number of true nonCpG changes is underestimated. The explanation for this
effect is as follows. For an ancestral CpG site to be
assigned as non-CpG requires the destruction of the CpG
site in both derived lineages, necessitating a minimum of
two changes across the tree (Figure 1a). For an ancestral
non-CpG site to be assigned as CpG requires only a single
change (Figure 2b). The former will occur much less often
(proportional to the square of the mean CpG divergence)
in closely related species than the latter (which is linear in
the mean divergence at non CpG sites). Thus many more

Substitution rates at mutational equilibrium
Substitution rates at mutational equilibrium. Ratio of estimated to true CpG differences and estimated to true nonCpG differences as a function of increasing sequence divergence for phylogenies derived from randomly generated sequences
evolved to be at mutational equilibrium. Results are shown for four different levels of hypermutability: no hypermutability, 5fold, 10-fold and 20-fold hypermutability (a, b, c and d). Each line represents 50 data points, each of which was estimated from
the evolution of a single, randomly-generated 3 Mb sequence.

ancestral non-CpGs will be misassigned as CpG in two
closely related sequences than vice versa. However, the key
point is that all true non-CpG dinucleotides that are misassigned will, by definition, have experienced at least a
single change in one lineage. By incorrectly placing many

true non-CpG changes in the CpG class we artificially
inflate the estimate of the CpG rate, whilst depressing the
estimate of the non-CpG rate. The difference in magnitude of the bias between CpG and non-CpG sites reflects
the difference in total numbers of each site type.

CpG/non-CpG assignment bias in coding and noncoding
sequences
We next investigated the impact of CpG/non-CpG misassignment in sequence data that were compositionally
more realistic than randomly generated sequences at
approximate mutational equilibrium. Real mouse coding
and intronic sequences were used as ancestral sequences
and again, two derived sequences were copied, evolved
and the number of CpG and non-CpG changes estimated
using CpG/non-CpG assignment. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure 3. As observed at approximate
mutational equilibrium (Figure 2) the number of CpG
substitutions tends to be overestimated and number of
non-CpG substitutions tends to be underestimated at
both fourfold and noncoding sites. Interestingly, however, the magnitude of overestimation of the number of
CpG changes tends to be larger in noncoding DNA. For
example, at 10-fold hypermutability and a pairwise divergence of 1%, the number of CpG substitutions in noncoding DNA is overestimated by ~50%, whereas the
equivalent figure is ~17% at fourfold sites. Similarly, the
magnitude of underestimation of non-CpG changes is
lower at noncoding sites. For the same parameter combination as described above, the number of non-CpG substitutions is underestimated by ~12% in noncoding DNA,
and by ~20% at fourfold sites.

The difference in level of estimation bias at fourfold and
noncoding sites results from a difference in CpG content.
Because of the structure of the genetic code, fourfold
degenerate sites are typically enriched for CpG dinucleotides, whereas noncoding sequences are depleted (0.032
vs 0.010 in our murid sequences). With changing CpG frequency, the numbers of misassigned sites will make up
different proportions of the total lost or gained from the
CpG and non-CpG classes. Thus with decreasing CpG
content, the overestimation of the CpG substitution rate
becomes greater whereas the underestimation of the nonCpG substitution rate becomes less. Paradoxically, this
result implies that whenever CpG/non-CpG assignment is
used to estimate substitution rates between closely related
species, CpG-rich sequences will appear to be evolving
more slowly than CpG-poor sequences.
CpG/non-CpG assignment bias in real sequence data
We next investigated whether the effects predicted by our
simulations could be observed in a real evolutionary setting. As the CpG/non-CpG assignment bias primarily
affects closely related sequences, we estimated substitution rates in human and chimpanzee pairwise alignments
of coding and noncoding sequence. As we cannot know
the true numbers of CpG and non-CpG substitutions in a
real alignment, we sought to compare CpG/non-CpG
assignment with a bias-free method. Previous studies [1820] have employed a "preC", "postG" classification in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/265

order to remove CpG mutations from nucleotide
sequence data. Further simulations showed that excluding
all sites preceded by C and followed by G ("CpG prone
sites"), reliably removes the effects of CpG mutation [see
Additional File 1] although this removes a substantial
number of sites from our dataset (~65% of all fourfold
degenerate sites and ~%36 of all intronic sites are
removed). We compared the non-CpG prone substitution
rate with the substitution rate estimated at non-CpG sites
identified using CpG/non-CpG assignment. The results of
this analysis are presented in Table 1. As predicted by our
simulations, the substitution rate at non-CpG sites, identified using CpG/non-CpG assignment, is underestimated
(by 23% and 13% at fourfold and intronic sites, respectively) when compared with the bias-free method. The difference between substitution rates at non-CpG and nonCpG prone sites is highly significant both in introns and
at fourfold sites (P < 0.0001; bootstrap test). The ratio of
synonymous to intronic substitution rates is also significantly lower (P < 0.0001; bootstrap test) at non-CpG sites
compared with non-CpG prone sites. As in our simulations, this likely results from differences in CpG content
between fourfold and intronic sites, that produce different
degrees of underestimation of the non-CpG rate when
CpG/non-CpG assignment is used. Thus, CpG/non-CpG
assignment could be potentially misleading when comparing CpG rich and CpG poor sequences, such as synonymous and intronic sites.

Discussion
Reliable, bias-free estimation of nucleotide substitution
rates is a fundamental part of molecular evolutionary
studies. Furthermore in order to test hypotheses about
natural selection, underlying neutral processes, such as
mutational rate variation, must be accounted for and their
effects quantified or removed as efficiently as possible.
Our study has shown that a commonly used method of
effecting such a removal, assigning nucleotide sites to
CpG and non-CpG categories, systematically biases the
estimation of nucleotide substitution rates. In particular,
across small to moderate evolutionary distances, CpG/
non-CpG assignment seriously upwardly biases the estimate of the number of CpG changes and downwardly
biases the estimate of the number of non-CpG changes.
This is due to a simple artefact that causes many more true
non-CpG changes to be misassigned as CpG than vice
versa. Clearly, more reliable removal of the effects of CpG
mutation is required prior to any meaningful comparison
of rates of nucleotide substitution among different
regions of mammalian genomes. Our simulations indicated that exclusion of non-CpG-prone sites (sites preceded by "C" and/or followed by "G"), is one simple and
effective method of removing CpG-derived changes. One
possible alternative to this is to employ an outgroup species to improve the accuracy of ancestral assignment.

Non CpG sites were identified using CpG/non-CpG assignment. Numbers in parentheses show 95% confidence intervals estimated by
bootstrapping the data by gene, 10000 times.

However simulations showed that parsimony-based
ancestral assignment can introduce additional biases into
the estimation of substitution rates [see Additional File 1].
These effects are consistent with the known problems with
parsimony when base composition is biased [21], namely
an excess of common-to-rare changes (in this case an
excess of non CpG to CpG changes).
The bias we describe here also causes the substitution rate
within CpG dinucleotides to be substantially overestimated between closely related species. Estimation of the
rate of substitution at CpGs has also been attempted using
CpG/non-CpG assignment by previous studies [8,10]. It is
likely that such studies will have overestimated the rate of
substitution at CpG sites, again due to misassignment
issues. When estimating the rate of substitution at CpG
sites, it is clearly preferable to implement a method that
explicitly models context-dependent evolution, such
those proposed in refs [3,4,22] or [23]. Our results are
supported by recent studies that have demonstrated that
methods of "optimal" ancestral state assignment, such as
the ad hoc method described here, can be seriously biased
and misleading [24,25].
The results presented here also have implications for previous comparisons of the substitution rate at fourfold and
noncoding sites in mammalian genomes [10,14]. As a
result of CpG/non-CpG misassignment bias and differences in base composition, typical mammalian noncoding and fourfold degenerate sites are likely to be
predisposed to misleading inferences about their relative
rates of substitution. The net effect is that fourfold synonymous sites appear to be evolving more slowly than noncoding sites when substitutions are divided into those that
have apparently occurred within and outside a CpG dinucleotide. Furthermore, fourfold sites will typically have a
higher CpG frequency than noncoding sites both during
the progression to, and at, mutational equilibrium.
Because of this, an apparent depression of evolutionary
rates at fourfold degenerate sites, when compared to noncoding DNA using CpG/non-CpG assignment, is likely to
be a general feature of mammalian molecular evolution.

Conclusion
Our study shows that a commonly used method of assigning sites to CpG or non CpG classes in pairwise alignments is seriously biased. We further note that the effects
of CpG and non-CpG misassignment at fourfold and noncoding sites are dependent on differential CpG frequencies, and so these results will apply to any comparison of
substitution rates where this is the case. Our results therefore recommend against the adoption of ad hoc methods
of ancestral state assignment.

Methods
We studied a simple mutation model in which transitions
occurred twice as frequently as transversions, and CpG mutations occurred at a different frequency to non-CpG mutations.
In all our simulations, two sequences were copied from a single ancestral sequence and evolved. In molecular evolutionary
studies fourfold degenerate sites in codons that code for different amino acids in both derived sequences are excluded. To
simplify this, in our simulated coding sequences, all nonsynonymous substitutions were considered strongly deleterious
and rejected. Qualitatively similar results were obtained when
a given proportion of nonsynonymous changes were modelled as neutral (results not shown). In all cases, estimates of
the numbers and rates of nucleotide substitution were corrected for multiple hits using the Jukes-Cantor model [26].
This was to ensure simplicity in the interpretation of our
results given that more parameter-rich multiple hits corrections take base composition into account, and it is unclear
whether this is appropriate when dividing sites into CpG and
non CpG. Our data were not simulated under a JC model,
since we included a variable transition/transversion rate. However, varying the transition/transversion did not qualitatively
impact our results (data not shown).
Ancestral sequences in our simulations were derived from two
sources: randomly generated sequences that were evolved to
reach approximate mutational equilibrium, and real
sequences derived from the mouse genome. The former
allowed us to quantify the effects of CpG misassignment bias
free of the complicating effects of nonequilibrium processes.
Real mouse coding and intronic sequences (collected in ref
[27]) were used in order to capture the base composition and

nonequilibrium evolution characteristic of mammalian
genomes in our simulations [17,28-30]. To investigate the
level of bias in a real evolutionary scenario we also collected a
random sample of 2000 human RefSeq genes for which we
extracted orthologous chimpanzee sequence from the UCSC
whole genome alignments. All alignments that did not start
with ATG, included premature stop codons or in which the
sequence length was not a multiple of three in either species
were removed leaving a total of 1470 genes. We removed CpG
islands from our intronic sequences using the criteria of [31].
