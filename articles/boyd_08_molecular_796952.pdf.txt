Abstract
Background: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is abundant in the aquatic environment particularly in
warmer waters and is the leading cause of seafood borne gastroenteritis worldwide. Prior to 1995,
numerous V. parahaemolyticus serogroups were associated with disease, however, in that year an
O3:K6 serogroup emerged in Southeast Asia causing large outbreaks and rapid hospitalizations.
This new highly virulent strain is now globally disseminated.
Results: We performed a four-way BLAST analysis on the genome sequence of V. parahaemolyticus
RIMD2210633, an O3:K6 isolate from Japan recovered in 1996, versus the genomes of four
published Vibrio species and constructed genome BLAST atlases. We identified 24 regions, gaps in
the genome atlas, of greater than 10 kb that were unique to RIMD2210633. These 24 regions
included an integron, f237 phage, 2 type III secretion systems (T3SS), a type VI secretion system
(T6SS) and 7 Vibrio parahaemolyticus genomic islands (VPaI-1 to VPaI-7). Comparative genomic
analysis of our fifth genome, V. parahaemolyticus AQ3810, an O3:K6 isolate recovered in 1983,
identified four regions unique to each V. parahaemolyticus strain. Interestingly, AQ3810 did not
encode 8 of the 24 regions unique to RMID, including a T6SS, which suggests an additional virulence
mechanism in RIMD2210633. The distribution of only the VPaI regions was highly variable among
a collection of 42 isolates and phylogenetic analysis of these isolates show that these regions are
confined to a pathogenic clade.
Conclusion: Our data show that there is considerable genomic flux in this species and that the
new highly virulent clone arose from an O3:K6 isolate that acquired at least seven novel regions,
which included both a T3SS and a T6SS.

Background
Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative halophilic, aerobic bacterium that is distributed in marine and estuarine
environments worldwide [1]. In the 1950s, Fujino demonstrated that V. parahaemolyticus was the etiological
agent responsible for a gastroenteritis outbreak in Osaka,
Japan. Presently, in Taiwan, Japan and other South East
Asian countries, V. parahaemolyticus cause over half of all
food poisoning outbreaks of bacterial origin [2,3]. Baross
and Liston in the late 1960s identified V. parahaemolyticus
in seawater, sediments and shellfish in the United States
[4,5]. Today, V. parahaemolyticus is the leading cause of
seafood-associated bacterial gastroenteritis in the United
States. V. parahaemolyticus can also cause serious wound
infections resulting in necrotizing fasciitis when wounds
are exposed to V. parahaemolyticus contaminated water [68]. Although less common, V. parahaemolyticus can cause
fatal septicemia in immune compromised hosts [6,7].
Most isolates of V. parahaemolyticus are non-pathogenic
and only a small number can cause infections in humans
[1]. Clinical isolates of V. parahaemolyticus produce beta
type hemolysis on blood agar (Wagatsuma agar) called
the Kanagawa-phenomenon (KP), which is linked to the
production of a thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH) [911]. TDH damages eukaryotic cells by acting as a pore
forming toxin that alters the ion balance of cells [12]. The
presence of the tdh gene, which encodes TDH is often used
as a diagnostic tool to identify pathogenic isolates of V.
parahaemolyticus. Five sequence variants of tdh (named
tdh1 to tdh5) have been identified, however only tdh2
appears to have a high-level of transcription [13,14]. In
the 1980s, several cases of gastroenteritis caused by hemolytic KP-negative TDH-negative V. parahaemolyticus isolates were reported [11]. These isolates contained a TDHrelated hemolysin (TRH) encoded by trh, which showed
69% sequence similarity with tdh [11]. TDH and TRH are
considered the main virulence factors of V. parahaemolyticus and strains can contain either TDH or TRH or both
[15-19]. Although isolates that do not contain tdh or those
that have a deletion in tdh are still cytotoxic to cells.
Hence, the overall mechanism involved in the organism's
pathogenesis remains unclear.
Analysis of the complete genome sequence of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633, a clinical isolate recovered in
Japan in 1996, identified a type III secretion system
(T3SS) on each chromosome designated T3SS-1 and
T3SS-2 [20]. Subsequently, the functional significance of
both T3SSs was determined using deletion mutants [21].
The T3SS-1 deletion mutants had significantly decreased
cytotoxic activity compared with that of the wild type
[21]. The T3SS-2 deletion mutants showed diminished
intestinal fluid accumulation, in an enterotoxicity assay
using the rabbit ileal loop test, whereas T3SS-1 mutants
were similar to the wild type [21]. In addition, a number

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/110

of effector proteins for these T3SSs have been identified
[22-24]. T3SS-1 is present in both clinical and environmental isolates and has a percent G+C content similar to
the rest of the genome indicating that this region is ancestral to the species [20]. Henke and Bassler [25] found that
unlike other T3SSs in pathogenic E. coli, which are activated by quorum sensing, T3SS-1 in V. parahaemolyticus is
repressed at high cell densities.
Associated with T3SS-2 encoded on chromosome 2 are
Tdh1 and Tdh2, as well as a cytotoxic necrotizing factor,
an exoenzyme T, and at least five transposases [20]. The
presence of transposases and a G+C content of 40% (less
than the overall genome), suggests that T3SS-2 may be a
integrative element similar to pathogenicity islands identified in pathogenic E. coli, S. enterica, and V. cholerae,
which we named Vibrio parahaemolyticus island-7 (VPaI-7)
[20,26]. T3SS-2 is present predominantly in the V. parahaemolyticus O3:K6 highly virulent strains recovered after
1995, whereas most clinical isolates recovered before
1995 do not encode T3SS-2 indicating that the region is
not essential for virulence, but may enhance virulence
when present [20].
Serotyping of V. parahaemolyticus isolates has identified
more than 13 O antigen groups and 71 K antigen types
[27]. Up until 1995, V. parahaemolyticus associated gastroenteritis was caused by many different serogroups,
although in some geographic regions specific serogroups
predominated. For example, in the United States a predominance of the O4 serogroup among clinical isolates
was apparent [28-32]. In 1995, an outbreak of V. parahaemolyticus infections occurred in Calcutta, India, which
caused rapid hospitalization of those infected and were
caused by a single serotype, a new O3:K6 highly virulent
strain [33]. Since 1995, a global dissemination of this V.
parahaemolyticus new highly virulent strain is evident since
it has now been isolated throughout Asia, America, Africa,
and Europe [3,29,34-40]. For example, in 1998, the new
highly virulent strain was responsible for a large outbreak
of gastroenteritis in Galveston Bay, Texas [29]. Later on
that year, the highly virulent strain was responsible for
large gastroenteritis outbreaks in Long Island Sound-Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey [41]. In 2005, the
highly virulent strain caused a major outbreak in Chile
with over 1,000 cases [3]. Non-O3:K6 pathogenic isolates
recovered since 1995, including O4:K68, O1:KUT, and
O1:K25 serotypes, have been shown to be closely related
to the new highly virulent O3:K6 strain based on molecular typing schemes and phylogenetic approaches
[29,30,37-39,42-44].
Previously, it was thought that V. parahaemolyticus was
confined to tropical climates, however recent studies
report the recovery of O3:K6 isolates from the water in

Southern Chile and Alaska, that up until now were considered too cold to support the growth of this organism
[35,45,46]. These recent discoveries suggest a change in
the organism's ability to adapt and survive in colder environments. Indeed the ability of V. parahaemolyticus to survive and proliferates in its environmental niches, in
shellfish and in the human intestine may have resulted
from the acquisition of regions encoding novel traits
which are differentially regulated in different niches.
Additionally, the spread of the organism is another indication of global warming, which is likely to play a role in
increasing V. parahaemolyticus distribution and occurrence.
First, we used a two step genomic approach to elucidate
the genomic changes that may have resulted in the emergence of the new highly virulent O3:K6 and related
strains. We performed in silico whole genome comparisons of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 versus the
genome sequences of V. cholerae N16961, V. vulnificus
YJ016 and CMCP6, and V. fischeri ES114. We constructed
genome BLAST atlases of each species to determine
regions unique to V. parahaemolyticus. We uncovered 24
regions greater than 10 kb that were unique to
RIMD2210633 and absent from the other Vibrio species
examined. These included functionally distinct regions
such as the class 1 integron, f237-like phages, Vibrio parahaemolyticus genomic island regions (VPaI-1 to VPaI-7), a
lipopolysaccaride (LPS)/capsule polysaccharide (CPS)
region, two osmotic stress response clusters, two T3SSs
and a T6SS. Next, we compared the RIMD2210633
genome sequence to that of AQ3810, an O3:K6 strain isolated in 1983, to elucidate the steps involved in the emergence of the globally disseminated O3:K6 highly virulent
strain. This analysis identified several regions unique to
one isolate or the other. Molecular analysis of the distribution of regions unique to RIMD2210633 among 42
natural isolates revealed that only regions encoding integrase or transposase genes (7 island regions) were variably
present. We reconstructed the phylogeny of the 42 isolates
based on multilocus sequence analysis, and mapped the
distribution of the 7 island regions, which showed that
these regions were acquired by the new O3:K6 highly virulent strain and predominant in one clade.

Results and Discussion

Systematic BLAST analysis was carried out for each of the
ORFs of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 compared
with each of the ORFs from the genome sequences of V.
cholerae N16961, V. vulnificus YJ016 and CMCP6, and V.
fischeri ES114. This four-way BLAST analysis was used to
construct genome BLAST atlases of chromosome 1 and 2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/110

of the four Vibrio species with V. parahaemolyticus
RIMD2210633 as a reference (Fig. 1). The four outer circles of solid color represent conserved proteins of the
BLASTed genomes for both chromosome 1 and 2. The
outer most circle represents the V. fischeri ES114 genome
(purple circle), the next two circles represents V. vulnificus
YJ016 and CMCP6 (navy and green circles), followed by
the fourth circle (brown circle), which represents V. cholerae N16961. The innermost circles show DNA structure
features, repeat sequences and base composition properties of the reference V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633
(Fig. 1). It is of interest to note that chromosome 1 shows
a higher level of overall conservation among the species
examined than chromosome 2 indicating that a lot of species specific genes lie on chromosome 2. There are approximately 44 gap regions (greater than 1 kb) on
chromosome 1 and 29 gap regions (greater than 1 kb) on
chromosome 2, common to all four outer circles and
these gaps represent regions of the V. parahaemolyticus
RIMD2210633 chromosomes that are unique being
absent from all other isolates examined. Differences in
these regions in their DNA structural features such as
intrinsic curvature, stacking energy and position preference correlate with some of the gap regions and represent
phages, integrons and genomic islands, that is signatures
of foreign DNA acquired by horizontal transfer (Fig. 1).
Of the 73 gap regions, our analysis uncovered 24 regions
greater than 10 kb that are present in RIMD2210633 and
absent from the other species examined, that is the gap
regions in the four outer circles in Figure 1 (Table 1). Of
the 24 regions identified, 11 regions encoded an integrase
or transposase, 9 regions had aberrant GC content (45 ±
3%), 7 regions of which had lower G+C content compared to the rest of the genome suggesting that these
regions were acquired by horizontal gene transfer (Table
1). The 24 regions included 14 previously identified:
lipopolysaccharide and capsule polysaccharide gene clusters, a class 1 integron, 2 f237 phage regions, 2 osmotic
stress response gene clusters, 2 T3SSs, and the Vibrio parahaemolyticus island (VPaI) regions (Table 1) [20,26,47].
The 10 additional regions unique to V. parahaemolyticus
RIMD2210633 included 2 regions encoded on chromosome 1 and 8 regions encoded on chromosome 2 (Table
1). On chromosome 1, region VP0081 to VP0092 encodes
mainly hypothetical proteins of unknown function;
VP0081 encodes a homologue of a hyper osmotic shock
protection protein. Region VP1386 to VP1420 encodes
hemo utilization/adhesion proteins, OmpA, a ClpA/B
type protease, a BfdA homologue, a putative IcmF-related
protein and related type VI secretion system (T6SS) proteins (VP1401 to VP1409), which is predicted to be
involved in intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport in other Gram-negative pathogens. On chromosome 2, region VPA0434 to VPA0458 encodes a large

Genome sequence of V. parahaemolyticus AQ3810
The previously published V. parahaemolyticus genome
sequence is from RIMD2210633 a tdh positive, trh and
urease negative O3:K6 clinical isolate of the highly virulent clone recovered in Japan in 1996. In order to unravel
events at the genome level that may have lead to the emergence and dissemination of the new highly virulent strain,
we sequenced the genome of AQ3810, a tdh positive, trh
and urease negative O3:K6 isolate recovered in Japan in
1983 for comparison. The complete genome sequence of
AQ3810 is 5.8 Mb and 5509 proteins have been annotated within its genome compared with the 5.2 Mb
genome of RIMD2210633, which has 4832 annotated
proteins. There is extensive sequence homology between
the two sequences, however genomic differences were
noted. As had been found within other Vibrio species, the
gene capture system, the -integron encoded in
RIMD2210633 and AQ3810 do not share any significant
sequence similarity.

We examined the genome of AQ3810 for the presence of
the 24 regions identified as unique to RIMD2210633
from our species comparisons (Table 1). Of the 24
regions, 8 regions were absent from AQ3810, 5 genomic
islands (VPa-1, VPaI-2, VPaI-4, VPaI-5 and VPaI-6), ORFs
VP1386 to VP1420, which encodes T6SS, the class 1 integron, and phage f237 encoded on chromosome 1 (Table
1). These data confirm our previous result that VPaI-1,
VPaI-4, VPaI-5 and VPaI-6 are unique to the new highly
virulent strain recovered after 1995 [26]. For example, two
of the missing regions, VPaI-1 and VPaI-4, integrate at a
tRNA-met (VP0404.1) and tRNA-ser locus (VP2130.1),
respectively in RIMD2210633, however, in AQ3810, both
of these tRNA sites are empty (see Additional file 3). The
other two missing regions VPaI-5 and VPaI-6 regions are
located between core chromosomal ORFs VP2889 and
VP2911, and VPA1252 and VPA1271, respectively in
RIMD2210633, while in AQ3810, the homologues of
these genes are contiguous indicating that these sites are
empty (see Additional file 3).
Two VPaIs were rearranged. One, the VPaI-2 region
(VP0634 to VP0643), is present at the tmRNA gene (ssrA)
in RIMD2210633, a gene that encodes both tRNA and
mRNA properties. In AQ3810, at this same locus, the first
three genes of this region are present (VP0634 to
VP0636), which encode homologues of a nitrilase/cyanide hydratase, OmpA and LysR, but the remaining genes
are replaced by a novel region encoding an integrase (see
Additional file 4). A second island region, VPaI-3
(VP1071 to VP1095) present at a second tRNA-ser locus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/110

(VP1070.1) in both RIMD2210633 and AQ3810 has 21
genes in common (ORFs VP1074 to VP1095) and 6 genes,
two novel integrases and four hypothetical proteins, are
adjacent to the tRNA-ser locus in AQ3810 (see Additional
file 4).
Two additional regions named VPaI-8 and VPaI-9 were
identified in AQ3810 (see Additional file 4). VPaI-8 is a
17 kb region located between homologues of VP3057 and
VP3058 and contains ORFs A79_5175 to A79_5191,
which encode a number of hypothetical proteins, homologues of SMF and KAP proteins, and two integrases separated by a single ORF (see Additional file 4). VPaI-9 is a 22
kb region integrated between homologues of VP0006 and
VP0007. VPaI-9 encodes an integrase, an excisionase, a
helicase and a type I restriction modification system.
ORFs VP1386 to VP1420 are absent from AQ3810. This
regions encodes T6SS (ORFs VP1401 to VP1409) and a
range of proteins that could be translocated by this system; hemo utilization/adhesion proteins, OmpA, a ClpA/
B type protease, a BfdA homologue, a putative IcmFrelated protein. This suggests the presence of an additional virulence mechanism in the highly virulent O3:K6
clone. T6SSs have been identified in a range of Gram-negative pathogens including pathogenic V. cholerae and in
that species T6SS translocates a bacterial host protein into
host cells that cross link actin [49].
Distribution of VPaI-2, VPaI-3 and VPaI-7
Previously, we examined the distribution of VPaI-1, VPaI4, VPaI-5 and VPaI-6 among a worldwide collection of V.
parahaemolyticus isolates and found that these regions are
unique to 24 isolates of the highly virulent O3:K6 clone
[26]. We determined the distribution of VPaI-2, VPaI-3
and VPaI-7 using primer pairs described in Table 2. Of the
42 V. parahaemolyticus isolates examined by PCR assays
using two primer pairs encompassingVPaI-2, 27 isolates
gave positive PCR bands. These isolates were recovered
post-1995 and include the 24 isolates that were previously
shown to contain VPaI-1, VPaI-4 to -6 (Fig. 2). VPaI-2 was
also present in isolates UCMV586 and 1324, O8:K22 and
O4:K6 isolates recovered after 1995, and ATCC43996, an
O3:K4 clinical isolate from recovered in the UK in 1970
(Fig. 2). The presence of VPaI-2 in ATCC43996 indicates
that this region was present in isolates before 1995, prior
to its acquisition by the new highly virulent strain. VPaI-2
encodes an integrase, a resolvase, hypothetical proteins, a
ribonuclease HI, an aminohydrolase, transcriptional regulators and a lipase.

Molecular analysis of the distribution of VPaI-3 found
that the region is present in 25 V. parahaemolyticus isolates,
which included the same set of isolates that contain VPaI1, VPaI-2, and VPaI-4 to VPaI-6 (O3:K6 and related iso-

lates recovered after 1995) (Fig. 2). One exception was
noted, KE10462, an O3:K6 isolate recovered in Japan in
1986. In addition, in two O3:K6 pre-1995 isolates,
KE9967 and U-5474, the VPaI-3 region was found to be
partially present, suggesting that this region is unstable
and has been deleted from these isolates. VPaI-3 contains
several transcriptional regulators, hypothetical proteins
and a methyl accepting chemotaxis protein.
VPaI-7, an 81 kb region present on chromosome 2,
encodes T3SS-2, two copies of the tdh gene, a cytotoxic
necrotizing factor, an exoenzyme T gene and five transposase genes [20]. T3SS-2 in V. parahaemolyticus showed
similarity to a T3SS present in several pathogenic V. cholerae non-O1 and non-O139 isolates [50,51]. To determine the distribution of VPaI-7, we used 12 primer pairs
spanning the 81 kb region (Table 2). Of the 42 V. parahaemolyticus isolates examined, 30 isolates were found to
contain the entire VPaI-7 region. Similar to the VPaI-2 and
VPaI-3 regions, the 30 VPaI-7-positive isolates included
all 24 highly virulent isolates as well as 3 O3:K6 strains
isolated pre-1995, strains KE9967, U-5474, and
ATCC43996 (Fig. 2). The region was present in three O4
serogroup isolates, 1324, an O4:K6, and two Spanish isolates, 30824 and 428/00 (Fig. 2). Although, T3SS-2 was
previously reported to be present only in the highly virulent strain, this appears not to be the case as others have

(Fig. 2). A primer pair designed within VPA1308/
VPA1309, and a primer pair within and VPA1400/
VPA1401 all gave a positive PCR product with all strains
examined indicating that these genes represent core chromosomal flanking genes.
We examined 11 additional regions that were unique to V.
parahaemolyticus for their distribution among our collection of isolates, all 11 regions were present in all the
highly virulent isolates, in fact 3 regions were present in
all strains examined (see Additional file 5). Five regions
were absent from 1 to 3 isolates, which included the
region that encodes T6SS that is absent from two pre-1995
O3:K6 strains. Three regions were absent from five isolates
(see Additional file 5).
Evolutionary genetic relationships
To understand the evolutionary significance of the distribution of the VPaI regions among our collection of isolates, a phylogenetic frame work was constructed by
multilocus sequence (MLS) analysis of an initial analysis
of three housekeeping genes. MLS analysis was demonstrated in numerous studies to be a powerful method to
both discriminate and determine the phylogenetic relationships among bacterial isolates including Vibrio species
[53-55]. We found similar to others that V. parahaemolyti-

cus isolates are highly related sharing substantial sequence
similarity at the three loci we examined [37,42] (Fig. 2).
Within the 1854 bps examined among the 42 isolates,
there were a total of 39 polymorphic sites of which 21
sites were phylogenetically informative and 12 sequence
types (ST) were found. For the purposes of this study, a
phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining
method using Kimura 2-parameter, which clustered the
strains into two closely related but distinct groups named
A and B (Fig. 2). The first group contains all highly virulent isolates whereas group B is comprised of mainly environmental isolates recovered in Spain in the early 2000s.
Within group A are 25 isolates that are identical at all three
loci examined; these isolates include 22 O3:K6 isolates
with worldwide distribution recovered pre-1995 and
post-1995, and 3 O1 serogroup isolates (O1:K25 and
O1:KUT) recovered post-1995. O3:K6 and O1:K25 isolates recovered post-1995, and O3:K6 isolates recovered
pre-1995 shared identical sequence profiles (Fig. 2). These
data support the hypothesis that O1:K25 and O1:KUT
serogroups arose from the O3:K6 highly virulent strain by
acquisition of novel O and K antigens similar to the emergence of the pathogenic V. cholerae O139 serogroup strain
from an O1 El Tor isolate. Acquisition of novel O and K
antigens would be evolutionary advantageous since it
may play a role in host immune avoidance in V. parahaemolyticus infection. Clustering with these O3:K6,
O1:K25, O1:KUT isolates are four identical O4 serogroup
isolates and KE10464, a divergent O3:K6 pre-1995 (Fig.
2). Thus, it appears that acquisition of novel O antigens is
frequent in this species and more recent data suggests this
is an ongoing event [3]. Also found within group A are
several divergent O3:K6 pre-1995 and post-1995 isolates,
and a single divergent O4:K8 post-1995, 1324 (Fig. 2).
Group B consists of 5 isolates, with various serotype designations but all were recovered in Spain post-1995 (Fig.
2). Three of the strains were recovered from mollusks and
sea sediment, and two strains 30824 and 428/00, which
shared an identical ST, were from clinical sources. Overall,
the phylogenetic tree constructed from concatenated
sequences of three housekeeping genes indicates that
pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus isolates are highly homologous as others have previously shown [42].
We mapped the distribution of each of the VPaI genomic
islands onto the phylogenetic tree to elucidate the possible steps involved in the emergence of the globally distributed V. parahaemolyticus new highly virulent strain. We
found that similar to VPaI-1, VPaI-4, VPaI-5 and VPaI-6,
VPaI-2 and VPaI-3 are predominately present among the
highly virulent isolates recovered after 1995 with only one
exception noted for VPaI-2, strain ATCC43996 recovered
in the UK in 1970, an O3:K4 serogroup (Fig. 2). The VPaI3 region was present in two pre-1995 O3:K6 isolates,
KE9967 and U5474 that have an identical sequence type,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/110

and in KE10462, which shows an identical sequence type
to five additional pre-1995 and 16 post-1995 O3:K6 isolates. KE10462 also appears to have contained the VPaI-7
regions since it is partially present in this isolate (Fig. 2).
KE10462 has been shown to be positive for group specific
PCR (GS-PCR), which is based on the toxRS nucleotide
sequence, that has previously been shown to differentiate
post-1995 pandemic strains from non-pandemic and pre1995
isolates
[26,39].
In conclusion, the most parsimonious scenario for the
evolution of the new highly virulent O3:K6 clone suggests
that a pre-1995 O3:K6 strain obtained regions VPaI-1 to
VPI-7, and a T6SS encoded within ORFs VP1386–VP1420,
this secretion systems along with T3SS-2 may explain the
highly virulent nature of the O3:K6 virulent clone. It
appears that V. parahaemolyticus isolates have the ability to
acquire large regions of DNA and that this is an ongoing
process among pathogenic isolates. For example, the O1
and K antigens, which are encoded in the same genomic
region, are undergoing frequent change among closely
related strains and this may be a mechanism to avoid the
host immune system.
The possible origins of the V. parahaemolyticus variable
regions appear to be quite diverse. Blast analysis of the
VPaI-1 encoded proteins found 7 ORFs highly homologous to a 22 Kb island present in V. cholerae strain 623–39
at the same tRNA-met insertion site, whereas a similar
analysis of VPaI-3 showed high sequence similarity to a
region in V. harveyi HY01 (AIQ_705 to AIQ_762). VPaI-2
encoded several ORFs with high similarity to ORFs identified in Vibrio sp Ex25. Most of VPaI-5 showed homology
to ORFs from Shewanella woodyi and Shewanella sp, and
similarly several ORFs of VPaI-6 were homologous to a
region in Shewanella sp ANA-3. The T3SS-2 region
encoded on island VPaI-2 is most closely related to a T3SS
recently identified in V. cholerae V51, a non-O1 serogroup
isolate [56]. Region VP1386 to VP1420, which encodes a
T6SS as well as a Rhs element, showed extensive homology to a region in V. harveyi ATCC BAA-1116.

Methods
Bacterial isolates
A total of 42 V. parahaemolyticus isolates were examined in
this study as previously described [26]. The 42 isolates
were temporally (1970 to 2003) and geographically widespread (Asia, Europe and South America) and encompassed 10 different serotypes. All V. parahaemolyticus
isolates were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) supplemented with 3% NaCl and stored at -70°C in LB broth
with 20% (v/v) glycerol.

Comparative bioinformatics analysis
We performed four-way BLAST analysis of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633, an O3:K6 isolated in 1996, versus
V. vulnificus YJ016, V. vulnificus CMCP6, V. cholerae
N16961 and V. fischeri ES114 to identify regions that
were unique to V. parahaemolyticus. Complete nucleotide
sequences and annotations for the V. parahaemolyticus
RIMD2210633, V. vulnificus YJ016, V. vulnificus CMCP6,
V. cholerae N16961 and V. fischeri ES114 were retrieved
and downloaded from NCBI [20,57-59]. These were
used to construct a genome atlas of the complete
genome sequence of all five isolates. The genome atlas
plot maps DNA structure features, repeats, and base
composition properties of V. parahaemolyticus as well as
each gene present in RIMD2210633, and their homologues in all four additional species oriented at the
ori[60]. In addition, we constructed a zoomable genome
atlas of the complete genome sequences of all 27 members of the family Vibrionaceae available in the database.
This data can be interactively examined for chromosome
1 and for chromosome 2 on the web [48]. We compared
the genome of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 to the
genome of V. parahaemolyticus AQ3810, an O3:K6 isolated in 1983, using the Artemis comparison tool (ACT)
program [61].
Molecular analysis
Chromosomal DNA was extracted from each V. parahaemolyticus isolate using the G-nome DNA isolation kit
from Bio 101. To determine the distribution of regions
unique to V. parahaemolyticus among our collection of 41
isolates, PCR assays were performed. Primer pairs were
designed to target within the regions of interest as well as
flanking the regions (Table 2). PCR was performed in a 25
μl reaction mixture with the following cycles: an initial
denaturation step at 96°C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles
of denaturation at 94°C for 30s, 30s of primer pair
annealing at the respective temperature, an extension step
at 72°C for 1–4 min (depending on expected PCR product size). PCR primers to amplify three chromosomal
housekeeping genes, gyrase subunit B (gyrB, VP0014),
malate dehydrogenase (mdh, VP0325), and chaperonin
(groEL-1, VP2851), were designed based on the sequence
of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 (Table 1). The
housekeeping genes were PCR amplified from chromosomal DNA isolated from all V. parahaemolyticus isolates
and PCR products were purified using Jetquick PCR purification Kit (GENOMED). The mdh, gyrB and groEL-1
sequences were determined by MWG-Biotech based on
the dye deoxy terminator method and the reaction products were separated and detected on an ABI PRISM 3100
genetic analyzer.

Phylogenetic analysis
The multiple sequence alignment program ClustalW was
used to align nucleotide sequences for each housekeeping
gene [62]. Rates of synonymous substitutions/synonymous site (KS) were calculated by the methods of Nei and
Gojobori and Nei and Lin [63,64]. To analyze the evolutionary relationships among V. parahaemolyticus isolates,
the concatenated sequence of all three housekeeping
genes was used to construct a Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic tree based on Kimura 2-parameter distance using
MEGA-3 [65].
Nucleotide sequence accession no
The sequences of mdh, gyrB and groEL-1 were submitted to
GenBank and given the accession numbers GenBank
EU629305–EU629345.
