Abstract
Background: Kraits (genus Bungarus) and cobras (genus Naja) are two representative toxic genera of elapids in the
old world. Although they are closely related genera and both of their venoms are very toxic, the compositions of
their venoms are very different. To unveil their detailed venoms and their evolutionary patterns, we constructed
venom gland cDNA libraries and genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries for Bungarus multicinctus
and Naja atra, respectively. We sequenced about 1500 cDNA clones for each of the venom cDNA libraries and
screened BAC libraries of the two snakes by blot analysis using four kinds of toxin probes; i.e., three-finger toxin
(3FTx), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), kunitz-type protease inhibitor (Kunitz), and natriuretic peptide (NP).
Results: In total, 1092 valid expressed sequences tags (ESTs) for B. multicinctus and 1166 ESTs for N. atra were
generated. About 70% of these ESTs can be annotated as snake toxin transcripts. 3FTx (64.5%) and b bungarotoxin
(25.1%) comprise the main toxin classes in B. multicinctus, while 3FTx (95.8%) is the dominant toxin in N. atra. We
also observed several less abundant venom families in B. multicinctus and N. atra, such as PLA2, C-type lectins, and
Kunitz. Peculiarly a cluster of NP precursors with tandem NPs was detected in B. multicinctus. A total of 71 positive
toxin BAC clones in B. multicinctus and N. atra were identified using four kinds of toxin probes (3FTx, PLA2, Kunitz,
and NP), among which 39 3FTx-postive BACs were sequenced to reveal gene structures of 3FTx toxin genes.
Conclusions: Based on the toxin ESTs and 3FTx gene sequences, the major components of B. multicinctus venom
transcriptome are neurotoxins, including long chain alpha neurotoxins (a-ntx) and the recently originated b
bungarotoxin, whereas the N. atra venom transcriptome mainly contains 3FTxs with cytotoxicity and neurotoxicity
(short chain a-ntx). The data also revealed that tandem duplications contributed the most to the expansion of
toxin multigene families. Analysis of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rate ratios (dN/dS)
indicates that not only multigene toxin families but also other less abundant toxins might have been under rapid
diversifying evolution.

Background
Snake venoms comprise a diverse array of toxins that
have a variety of biochemical and pharmacological functions and can be conveniently classified as hemotoxins
and neurotoxins [1]. Recently, it has been documented

that most of the snake toxins were recruited or derived
from normal body proteins in the common ancestor of
venomous squamates (Toxicofera) or advanced snakes
(Caenophidia) 100-200 million years ago (mya) [2-5].
Associated with the species radiation of advanced snakes
in the Cenozoic era, a predator-prey arms race led to
the explosive appearance of toxic arsenals, and typically,
several toxin multigene families were generated by gene
duplication, followed by fast diversification [4,6]. The
birth-and-death model was proposed to explain the
emergence of taxon-specific toxin groups [7]; i.e., new
toxin genes consistently emerged through gene duplication with the divergence of taxa, but some toxin genes

got deleted or were degenerated in other lineages.
However, due to the low-depth sequencing of toxin
transcripts for each species, fast evolution of toxin
genes, and lack of genome sequences, the detailed elaboration of snake venom evolution is still unclear.
The Elapidae family (elapids), which has approximately
300 venomous snakes in 61 genera, is a monophyletic
group among advanced snakes [8,9]. Several broad
radiated lineages (diverged rapidly between around 31
and 26 mya, based on fossil records and molecular
evidence [9]) have been identified within the Elapidae,
including the Afro-Asian cobras, Oriental kraits, AsianAmerican corals, and Australian and marine snakes,
which are well known to be the most toxic snakes in
the world. So far, the gene expression profiles of venom
glands from four species [10-12] have been reported
using EST sequencing. However, the kraits (genus Bungarus) and cobras (genus Naja), as the most diverse and
representative toxic elapids in the old world [7], lack
genomic and venom EST data.
In the present study, we prepared cDNA libraries from
the venom glands of the two representative old world
elapid snakes, Bungarus multicinctus and Naja atra, and
sequenced about 1500 clones for each library. We also
constructed genomic bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC) libraries for the two snakes and conducted a
screen for venom genes. Our results identified many
new snake toxins, such as multiple groups of 3FTxs,
some novel lectins, and a peculiar natriuretic peptide
(NP), and revealed that toxin genes have experienced
rapid evolution and gene expansion.

Results and Discussion
Venom gland cDNA libraries and ESTs

We constructed two cDNA libraries from the venom
gland tissues of B. multicinctus and N. atra, respectively,
and randomly selected 1441 and 1534 clones for
sequencing. From these clones, we successfully obtained
1092 expressed sequences tags (ESTs) for B. multicinctus and 1166 ESTs for N. atra. Using CAP3 software
with a cutoff of 95% identity [13], the B. multicinctus
ESTs were grouped into 294 clusters (including 83 contigs assembled by two or more ESTs and 211 singlets),
whereas the N. atra ESTs were grouped into 339 clusters (including 62 contigs and 277 singlets). Using
BLAST for functional annotation, complete lists with
putative gene identifications for these EST clusters are
provided in Additional file 1. Most ESTs could be
matched to reported snake toxins (69.51% in B. multicinctus and 70.24% in N. atra). The toxin clusters
showed notably high redundancy (14.32 ESTs/cluster in
B. multicinctus, 12.41 ESTs/cluster in N. atra), in contrast to the low redundancy of non-toxin clusters (1.40
ESTs/cluster in B. multicinctus, 1.31 ESTs/cluster in N.

atra) (Table 1), indicating that the toxin genes were
highly expressed.
In this study, we focused on the toxin ESTs; i.e., 26
contigs and 27 singlets in B. multicinctus, and 18 contigs and 48 singlets in N. atra (Figure 1). Except the
dominant 3FTx, we also observed eight less relatively
abundant venom families both in B. multicinctus and N.
atra: phospholipase A2 (PLA2), C-type lectins, kunitztype protease inhibitor (Kunitz), L-Amino oxidase
(LAO), nerve growth factor (NGF), cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRSIP), and vespryn. However, NP, presynaptic (b) bungarotoxin, prothrombin activator (Pa), and
acetylcholinesterase were only detected in B. multicinctus, while metalloproteinase and cystatin were only
found in N. atra.
In snake venoms, 3FTx, PLA2, Kunitz, C-type lectins,
and metalloproteinase have been reported to be the
major multigene toxin families [6], and they comprised
97.1% in B. multicinctus and 98.0% in N. atra in our
toxin EST data. We also identified a peculiar cluster of
NP precursors with tandem NPs. Besides, b bungarotoxin is a Bungarous-specific toxin, which is a heterodimeric protein complex of phospholipase A2 (A chain)
and kunitz peptides (B chain) covalently linked by one
disulphide bridge [4,14]. Here, we detected 7 clusters
(108 ESTs) of A chain of b bungarotoxin and 4 clusters
(83 ESTs) of B chain as a major toxin in B. multicinctus
(25.1% of all toxin ESTs).
Analysis of toxin genes
Three-finger toxins (3FTxs)

3FTxs are neurotoxins and can bind to very different
neurological targets (neuronal, pre-synaptic, postsynaptic, and synaptic); some of them also have non-neurotoxic activities (cytotoxicity and platelet inhibition) [4,5].
Its family members have a similar structure, with three
loops and four conserved disulfide bridges, and contain
about 60-74 amino acid residues. The ancestral 3FTx
was thought to have 10 cysteines and acquired some
amelioration: deletion of the ancestral C 2 and C 3
cysteines potentiated alpha-neurotoxic activity and
acquired additional newly evolved cysteines [7]. In 2003,
Fry grouped 33 types of 3FTxs from 276 protein
sequences, with a number of “orphan groups” of 3FTxs
whose functional roles are not yet known [7]. Since
then, many other kinds of 3FTxs have been successively
detected [12,15,16]. So far, more than five hundred variant 3FTx sequences across the entire advanced snakes
have been observed. A birth-and-death mode [7] and a
mechanism of duplication and divergence [17], allowing
venom snakes to adapt to a variety of prey, were
proposed to explain the generation of the 3ftx superfamily. But, the evolutionary relationships of all kinds of
3FTxs are still uncertain, such as the notable alpha

neurotoxic clades (short chain, long chain, kappa, and
type III), which are not monophyletic, based on the phylogenetic tree of 3FTxs constructed by Fry [4]. It is in
contrast to previous hypotheses that alpha neurotoxins
(a-ntx) diverged from a common ancestral gene that
separated before the divergence of the elapid sub-family
[18].
The analysis of the B. multicinctus 3FTxs revealed that
491 clones (64.5% of all toxin ESTs) could be grouped
into 12 contigs and 9 singlets, and a total of 785 N. atra
clones (95.8% of all toxin ESTs) fell into 12 contigs and
35 singlets. We notice that all the contig sequences
encoded full-length proteins, except two contigs (na009
with 3 clones, bm006 with 7 clones), which are lacking
exon2, probably resulting from alternative splicing.
Since 3FTxs are the dominant toxins in both B. multicinctus and N. atra and show a greater diversity of
family members, we classified them basically based on
the number of cysteines following the nomenclature of
Fry [7] (Figure 2 and Additional file 1). Divergence analysis shows that four of the 3FTx groups had relatively
low intra-divergence levels. Three of the groups–long
chain a-ntx (also together with kappa-ntx, 69.2% of

total 3FTx ESTs in B. multicinctus), cytotoxin (also
together with orphan XV group, 74.5% of total 3FTx
ESTs in N. atra), and short chain a-ntx (19.2% of total
3FTx ESTs in N. atra)–were much more abundant than
the rest of the 3FTxs (Figure 1). The other group,
orphan gourp II (2.5% of total 3FTx ESTs in B. multicinctus), have 10 cysteines and thus could be considered
as an ancestral-like 3FTx group.
If the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate
(dN/dS) for one protein-coding sequence is significantly
higher than 1, it indicates a trend toward accelerated
evolution. Because short coding sequences of 3FTxs have
high variation (fast adaptive evolution) with multiple
indels or even frameshifts between different 3FTx toxin
groups, this maybe led to inaccurate multiple alignments
and ambiguous phylogenetic relationships. So, we only
computed dN/dS rates within each of the four major
3FTx groups using PAML [19]. We observed that many
dN/dS values are large than 1 (Table 2). As an extreme
example, we noticed that the two dominating 3FTx contigs (na001 with 227 ESTs, na054 with 310 ESTs) occupied 65.6% of all toxin ESTs in N. atra, and all of the 15
differences between these two cytotoxin contigs were

non-synonymous substitutions, which is significantly different from neutral expectation (p = 0.008, one-tail test)
by Fisher’s Exact Test [20], suggesting a recently accelerated diversification in this major group of 3FTxs in N.
atra.
We also noticed a special contig, bm047 (a homologous protein previously isolated in Bungarus candidus
by Kuhn et al. [21], named bucandin), which was conspicuously different from other contigs and even had a
unique signal peptide (Figure 2). Based on the phylogenetic analysis, contig bm047 might have diverged from
other 3FTx genes at an early stage of the origin of
snakes (data not shown). It is possible that bm047 has a
conserved function and has not diversified into a multicopy gene family.
Phospholipase A2 and A chain of b bungarotoxin (PLA2)

Elapidae venom PLA2 exerts a multiplicity of novel,
nonenzymatic activities, including neurotoxic and antiplatelet activity (group I), whereas viperid venom PLA2
is synovial-type (group II) PLA2 [22]. The elapid PLA2,
which has 120 amino acids and 6 or 7 disulfide bonds,
was thought to be derived independently from nontoxic
pancreatic-type PLA2 [23].
We identified four clusters of PLA2-like ESTs with
intact coding sequence (CDS) in B. multicinctus and
one full-length cluster in N. atra, which covered the
major PLA2 types detected before in B. multicinctus and
N. atra. In B. multicinctus, one cluster (bm008) enclosing 21 ESTs showed 100% identity with the PLA2
sequence of B. multicinctus in GenBank (X53406.1).
Another three clusters in B. multicinctus were similar to
the A chain of b bungarotoxins, with a notable substitution at residue 99 (from Leu to Cyc) compared with
cluster bm008, which may be important for the

formation of interchain disulfides in b bungarotoxin.
Based on the gene tree, it is clear that A chain of b bungarotoxin in B. multicinctus quite possibly duplicated
from the PLA2 gene in B. multicinctus. We estimated
an average dS value of 0.27 between PLA2 contig
bm008 and the A chain of b bungarotoxins, which is
smaller than the dS value (0.29) between bm008 and the
N. atra PLA2 na022, indicating that the A chain of b
bungarotoxin might have derived from PLA2 after the
divergence of Bungarus and Naja.
Kunitz-type protease inhibitor and B chain of b
bungarotoxin (Kunitz)

Kunitz belongs to the superfamily of bovine pancreatic
trypsin-like inhibitors (BPTIs), with the ancestral function of inhibiting a diverse array of serine proteases and
with a peptide chain of around 60 amino acid residues
and 3 disulfide bonds [3,24]. It evolved the toxin ability
to inhibit various physiological processes, such as blood
coagulation, fibrinolysis, host defense, and action potential transduction. In elapid venoms, besides the common
Kunitz with trypsin or chymotrypsin inhibitor activity,
the dendrotoxins in Dendroaspis have presynaptic neurotoxicity [25], and the B chain of b bungarotoxin is
thought to act as an affinity probe to guide the A chain
to its target [14].
In B. multicinctus, four clusters (83 ESTs) of the B
chain of a b bungarotoxin-like sequence and one partial
kunitz-type protease inhibitor-like cluster (2 ESTs) were
obtained. In N. atra, only one singlet of a kunitz-type
protease inhibitor-like EST was detected. To understand
the evolutionary relationship of the kunitz-type protease
inhibitor and B chain of b bungarotoxin, we constructed
a phylogenetic tree (Additional file 2: Figure S1). We also
obtained an average ~0.3 dS value between the kunitz-

type protease inhibitor and B chain of b bungarotoxin.
Compared with the similar dS value of 0.27 between
PLA2 contig bm008 and A chain of b bungarotoxin, we
propose that the A chain and B chain of b bungarotoxin
evolved separately from PLA2 and Kuntiz around the
same time as the common ancestor of Bungarus.
C-type lectin

C-type lectins or C-type lectin-like proteins are ubiquitous
components of animal venoms and contain distinct diversified subgroups, including true lectins, coagulant proteins,
platelet aggregation agonists, and platelet aggregation
antagonists [26]. The elapid C-type lectins are arranged
inside the true lectins group, except one M. corallinus Ctype lectin [12]. The true lectins cause aggregation of

erythrocytes in a dose-dependent manner, which are
normally composed of two covalently linked identical
subunits, each consisting of 135-141 amino acids [26].
Here, 29 C-type lectins-like ESTs were grouped into 9
clusters (4 contigs and 5 singlets) in B. multicinctus,
while only one contig from 5 ESTs was identified in N.
atra. Interestingly, all of these clones do not match the
previously sequenced C-type lectins in B. multicinctus
and N. atra. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that a cluster
of three contigs (bm016, bm017, bm018) that we
sequenced were grouped separately from all of the
known Bungarus lectins, indicating that this is a novel
cluster that diverged from the main group (Additional
file 2: Figure S2).
Metalloproteinase

Metalloproteinase is the dominant component in viperid
venoms, which exerts anticoagulant or coagulant effects
and results in a severe bleeding by interfering with
blood coagulation and hemostatic plug formation or by
degrading the basement membrane or extracellular
matrix components of the victims [27]. But, few metalloproteinases are detected in elapids [28], which produce
long cDNA products (about 1.8 kb). Here, three partial
singlet ESTs in N. atra represented two kinds of metalloproteinase isoforms, which were respectively similar to
EF080840 in N. atra and AY101383 in Naja mossambica as P-III type metalloproteinases.
Natriuretic peptide (NP)

The NP family functions to control natriuresis, diuresis,
blood pressure, homeostasis, and inhibition of aldosterone secretion in all vertebrates or is used by snakes to
interrupt these physiological processes of preys [29,30]
and thus has attracted attention as ideal candidates of
hypotensive and vasodilator agents. It has a conserved
ring structure, consisting of 17 amino acids, with extensions of a few amino acids in the two termini. Four
major members of the NP family have been indentified
in vertebrates–atrial NP (ANP), B-type NP (BNP),
C-type NP (CNP), and ventricular NP (VNP)–and structurally, CNP lacks the C-terminal tail, whereas other
NPs have both tails [29,31]. All of the snake venom NPs
seem to have originated from a common ancestral
venom, CNP, and a complete snake CNP pro-peptide is
constituted by a signal peptide, a linker, a flexible
N-terminal extension (also named the CNP-53 isoform,
with a 17-aa core ring), and a mature peptide (CNP-22).
Nevertheless, snake NPs have recruited some new segments, such as several bradykinin-potentiating peptides
(BPPs), located in the NP precursor in the Viperidae
family, whereas an alterable C-terminal extension was
acquired in the Elapidae family, which may result in
novel physiological actions [13,32,33].
Here, we detected one contig (bm026 with 10 ESTs)
only in B. multicinctus, and this transcript had a region

containing two tandem CNP-53 repeats. We noticed
that this pair of tandem duplicates had different putative
mature peptides (10 differences in a 69-bp sequence)
but had almost identical N-terminal extensions (3 differences in a 123-bp sequence) (Figure 3A), with statistically significant region-biased mutations (p = 0.006,
two-tail test) by Fisher’s Exact Test, which may represent a functional differentiation between the two NPs.
Two possible evolutionary scenarios can explain this
pattern: a) this is an old duplicate event, but the Nterminal extensions have a recent conversion or may be
under strong functional constraint; and b) this is a
young duplicate event, and the putative mature peptides
evolved very fast. However, based on the alignment of
NP sequences in Elapidae venoms (Figure 3B), we
noticed that bm026 and another unusual NP (U77596
from M.corallinus) had a common repeated region
[12,34]. We also found that the closest sequence of
bm026 was the DNP in green mamba snake (Dendroaspis angusticeps), which has attracted attention abroad
for its novel long C-terminal extension [35], and Figure
3B shows that the C-terminal extension of DNP is
homologous with the common repeated region. Based
on these clues, we propose that the duplicate event may
have occurred in the ancestor of Bungarus, Dendroaspis,
and Micrurus.

Other toxins

In the cDNA libraries, except for the major multigene
toxin families, there were some other toxins that were
widely found in snake venoms but that only constituted a
small part of the total ESTs in a species. Most of these
toxins had been recruited into the venom system before
the last common ancestor of elapid and viperid snakes
with assistant toxic functions or unknown functions,
such as CRISP, NGF, LAO, cystatin, and acetylcholinesterase [4,5]. Besides, vespryn (also named Ohanin, as first
detected in Ophiophagus hannah) and prothrombin activator (similar to the mammalian blood coagulation factor
Xa) were only found in that elapid species so far [36].
In this study, we obtained many full or partial novel
sequences of these less abundant toxins: one cluster in
B. multicinctus and three clusters in N. atra coding for
CRISP, one cluster in B. multicinctus and one cluster in
N. atra coding for NGF, one cluster in B. multicinctus
and one cluster in N. atra coding for LAO, three clusters in B. multicinctus and one cluster in N. atra coding
for vespryn, one cluster coding for cystatin, and one
cluster coding for acetylcholinesterase in N. atra.
Comparison of the major venom components among elapid
snakes

Previously several other transcriptomes of the elapid
venom gland had been reported, such as marine snakes

(Lapemis curtus and Acalyptophis peronii), Australian
snake (Austrelaps labialis), and coral snake (Micrurus
corallines) [10-12]. However, besides 3FTxs, PLA2 is
also another major venom component in these species.
We also noticed that the major types, 3FTxs, are very
different. The major 3FTx types from the marine and
Australian snakes are long chain a-ntx and short chain
a-ntx, whereas Micrurus corallines mainly contains
orphan gourp XII and some unknown groups of 3FTxs.
In contrast, the major components of B. multicinctus
venom transcriptome are 3FTxs (mainly belong to long
chain a-ntx group) and recently originated b bungarotoxin while the N. atra venom transcriptome mainly
contains cytotoxin and short chain a-ntx groups of
3FTx. Other less abundant toxins were not observed in
the transcriptomes of the marine and Australian snakes,
maybe due to the small number of sequenced clones.
Besides transcripts, some studies also described peptide
sequences for some elapid snake toxins. A study characterizing venom proteins of N. atra identified 124 protein
segments or peptides [37], 74% of which belonged to
3FTxs and 11% were PLA2. In another study of Naja
kaouthia venom proteomics [38], 61 venom proteins segments or peptides were identified, most of which were
covered by our EST sequence, except the cobra venom
factors. Two studies on coral snakes identified 26 and 11
toxin proteins or peptides, respectively [39,40], 3FTx and
PLA2 proteins were also the major toxin components.
So, the major toxins are basically consistent with our
results observed in the N. atra venom gland transcriptome while Bungarus has quite different components.
However, it seems the PLA2 transcripts have higher
expression efficiency, considering that the PLA2 ESTs
only comprise 1.2% of our toxin ESTs in N. atra while
PLA2 peptides were observed to compose of a considerable amount in the N. atra venom [37].
Analyses on the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous
substitution rates (dN/dS) for the protein-coding ESTs of all
toxin genes

It has been known that the 3FTx and PLA2 toxin multigene families have been subjected to positive Darwinian

selection [6,41], but whether this has happened in the less
abundant toxins is still unknown. We used the maximum
likelihood model to estimate the dN/dS ratios of all kinds
of toxins in elapid snake venoms. The representative
sequences used here were from our EST data or downloaded from the GenBank database (Additional file 2:
Table S1). Except for orphan group II of 3FTxs in B. multicinctus, almost all of the toxins had some sites that showed
evidence of positive selection dN/dS ratios, and the dN/dS
ratios for these sites ranged from 3.01 to 19.52 (Table 2).
These results suggest that most toxin genes in elapid
venoms might have been subjected to strong pressure of
prey species shifts or arsenal competition, leading to the
accelerated innovation of antigenic epitopes in toxins.
BAC Library construction and sequencing of 3FTx genes

In order to understand the gene structure of toxin
genes, two independent BAC libraries containing 73,728
(B. multicinctus) and 82,944 (N. atra) clones, with average inserted genomic segments of 120 and 100 kb
respectively, were constructed and arrayed into 384-well
microtiter plates. Examples of 16 digested clones are
presented in Additional file 2: Figure S3. We estimated
that the percentage of clones without inserts was about
10%. Based on the snake’s haploid genome size of 2.38
pg for Bungarus fasciatus and 2.59 pg for Naja haje
[42], we estimated the genome coverage of the libraries
to be around 3.3 × for B. multicinctus and 2.9 × for N.
atra. These coverages theoretically provide 97.6% and
96.0% probability of obtaining any unique sequence in
the B. multicinctus and N. atra BAC libraries, respectively, assuming random cloning [43].
We used 3FTx, PLA2, Kunitz, or NP toxin probes to
screen the two BAC libraries and identified 50 positive
BAC clones for B. multicinctus and 21 for N. atra. The
screening results are listed in Table 3. Unfortunately, we
did not find positive PLA2 clones for N. atra. In addition, we identified positive NP BAC clones in N. atra,
but we did not observe ESTs from its cDNA library.
In order to understand evolution patterns in the 3FTx
super-family, we tried to subclone and sequence the

3FTx toxin genes. There were 39 BAC clones showing
3FTx-probe positivity in this study. As the major toxin
in elapid venoms, the structure and organization of
3FTx toxin genes have clearly been found to consist of
three exons and two introns in a region of about 2.5 kb
[18]. Based on the results of EcoR I digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis separation, most of the 39 BAC
clones had multiple 3FTx toxin gene fragments, whose
sizes were from 5 kb to 10 kb (Figure 4). Considering
that the 3FTx toxin genes are about 2.5 kb long and seldom contain EcoR I sites, these multiple 3FTx toxin
gene fragments, located in the same BAC clone, are very
likely to be tandem duplicates.
Excluding some redundant BAC clones with the same
3FTx toxin gene restriction fragments, we obtained 25
RFLP-unique 3FTx toxin BAC clones, indicating there
are at least 13 and 12 segmental duplicate areas of 3FTx
toxin genes, respectively, in B. multicinctus and N. atra.
Because of the existence of tandem duplicates, it is hard
to sequence these clones. Finally, we got 18 and 22
complete or partial 3FTx toxin gene sequences by constructing subcloning libraries and genomic walking,
respectively, for B. multicinctus and N. atra. The 3FTx
toxin gene sequences that were derived from the same
BAC clone were defined as putative tandem duplicates.
There are 5 putative tandem duplicates in B. multicinctus and 7 in N. atra. The nucleotide substitution rate

Page 8 of 13

per site (Kn) in the non-coding regions (intron I and
intron II of 3FTx gene) between the tandem duplicates
is shown in Table 4. We noticed that most of the potential tandem duplicates had low Kn values (<0.05), indicating that most duplication events happened recently.
It also suggests that fast 3FTx gene expansion is still
ongoing in the two elapids.
Based on the best Blast hits to the GenBank database
and our EST data, all of the 3FTx toxin genes were classified and annotated (Additional file 2: Table S2). About
65% (26/40) of the gene sequences showed lower than
95% identity with 3FTx toxin gene sequences from the
GenBank database, indicating that most of the 3FTx
toxin genes that we sequenced are novel sequences
(Figure 5). Parts of the 3FTx genes that we sequenced,
especially a big group that looked similar to orphan group
II, could not match any ESTs from the two cDNA libraries,
indicating that a large number of lower-expression 3FTx
toxin genes were not detected in previous studies.
Because the coding sequences of 3FTx genes are short
and too diversified, it is difficult to construct an accurate
phylogenetic relationship for all these diverse subgroups
of 3FTx. So, we tried to use only the intron sequences
for genic phylogenetic analyses, especially using intron
II, which has a stable length of about 550 bp [44]. But,
the 3FTx gene tree (Figure 5) still confuses us with multiple radiated sub-families, just like the phylogenetic

Figure 4 Blotting analysis of 39 3FTx probe-positive BAC clones. 3FTx probe-positive BAC clones were digested with EcoR I and analyzed
on 0.8% agarose gels prior to blotting on a nylon membrane (upper panel). The 3FTx gene-containing fragments were identified by
hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled 3FTx probes (lower panel). The positive bands were used as a control to cut and purify 3FTx genecontaining fragments in a second gel. Lanes: M, 1 kb DNA ladder; 1-39, 3FTx probe-positive BAC clones (Additional file 2: Table S2).

Then, the BAC libraries for these two elapids were
constructed, and 25 BACs containing 3FTx genes were
partially sequenced. The data revealed that tandem duplications contributed the majority of the expansions of toxin
multigene families in the two elapids. We detected positive
selection in every toxin subfamily and found that not only
the multigene toxin families but also the less abundant
toxins were under rapid adaptive evolution.

relationship of the 3FTx constructed by Fry [4,7]. Taking
a-ntx for example, we observed two monophyletic
lineages of short chain a-ntx from N. atra and two monophyletic lineages of long chain a-ntx, respectively, from B.
multicinctus and N. atra, which indicates that multiple
groups of a-ntx separated before the divergence of Bungarus and Naja. Considering that the long chain a-ntx
originated mainly by one splicing site shifting event from
short chain a-ntx [18] and that both the short and long
chain a-ntx coexist in some Australian and marine snakes,
such as Austrelaps labialis [11], Lapemis curtus [10], and
Laticauda semifasciata [18], the hypotheses that a-ntx
diverged from a common ancestor seems reasonable. So, it
is very likely that these broad radiated groups of
3FTx (containing the multiple a-ntx, cytotoxin, and
other orphan 3FTx groups) appeared right before the
explosive speciation of major elapid subfamilies in the
mid-Oligocene [9]. In brief, our data suggest that 3FTx
genes probably experienced family explosion and thereby
generated the major groups before the species radiation of
Elapidae subfamilies. After that, by massive duplication,
perhaps mainly by tandem duplication, the 3FTx gene
family acquired numerous new members and became the
most abundant toxin family in the two elapid venoms.

Conclusions
Both B. multicinctus and N. atra venoms are very toxic,
respectively, with LD50 of 0.108 mg/kg and 0.29 mg/kg
when injected subcutaneously (Venomdoc database from
Fry), and they belong to two closely related genera [9].
However, the major components of the B. multicinctus
venom transcriptome are neurotoxins, including long
chain a-ntx and b bungarotoxin, whereas the N. atra
venom transcriptome mainly has cytotoxicity and a little
bit of neurotoxicity from short chain a-ntx. In this study,
we present the toxin profiles of B. multicinctus and N.

Fresh venom glands and blood cells were obtained,
respectively, from an individual of Bungarus multicinctus and Naja atra, both of which were collected from
Zhejiang province, China. The protocol was approved by
the ethics committee of Kunming Institute of Zoology,
CAS, China.
cDNA library construction and sequencing

Total RNA was extracted from venom glands using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The mRNA was
purified from total RNA, using the Oligotex mRNA kit
(Qiagen). The purified mRNA was used to make cDNA
library, following the instructions in the SuperScript
Plasmid System for cDNA Synthesis and Cloning Kit
(plasmid used: pCMV-SPORT6 for B. multicinctus,
pSPORT1 for N. atra) (Invitrogen, USA). Plasmids were
purified using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen).
Purified plasmids were sequenced by cycle sequencing
reactions using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 kit (Applied
Biosystem, USA) and an automated DNA sequencer
(Model 3100A, Applied Biosystem, USA).
cDNA sequence cluster assembly

After removing the vector, adaptors, and low-quality
sequences, ESTs were assembled into contiguous clusters
using the CAP3 program [45], with the setting that only
joined sequences with at least 95% identity. Each cluster
(contigs with more than one EST or singlets with one
EST) was then searched against the GenBank databases
using BLASTX and BLASTN algorithms to identify similar sequences with an e-value cutoff < 10-5, as described
by Ching AT et al. [13]. The signal peptide was predicted
using the local SignalP 3.0 server [46]. A final annotation
table was generated in Microsoft Excel format, containing
all the relevant information about clusters and singlets.
EST sequences were deposited in GenBank dbEST under
accession numbers HO056271 to HO058536.
Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library construction
and characterization

High-molecular-weight DNA was extracted from snake
blood cells, partially digested with EcoR I, and cloned

into the CopyControl pCC1BAC vector (Epicentre,
USA) according to a previously described method [47].
To estimate the recombination ratio of the libraries and
the average size of inserted DNA fragments, 100
randomly selected BAC clone DNAs were digested with
Not I and separated by PFGE, as described by Wang
et al. [48].

Screening the snake BAC genomic library

All the colonies in 384-well microtiter plates were
replica-plated onto nylon membranes for hybridization
using standard techniques [49]. Two rounds of screening were performed. In the first one, a mixture of 12
probes was used, which represented four kinds of toxin
genes. These probes were respectively prepared for the

Jiang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/1

consensus toxin coding sequences by labeling their PCR
product with digoxigenin. They were designed based on
the cDNA sequences of 3FTx, b bungarotoxin A-chain
(or PLA2), b bungarotoxin B-chain, and NP (Additional
file 2: Table S3). Then, the 79 positive clones were
respectively hybridized with each kind of probe to
exclude false positives and identify the concrete toxin
gene type.
Subcloning 3FTx genes and sequencing

All 39 3FTx gene-positive clones, verified by colony
hybridization, were digested with EcoR I and analyzed
on 0.8% agarose gels prior to blotting on a nylon membrane. Then, 3FTx gene-containing fragments were
identified by hybridization with the same probes used in
the library screening and subcloned into the CopyControl pCC1BAC vector. These subclones were then tested
by PCR using specific primers, designed based on the
sequence of the toxin ESTs (Additional file 2: Table S3).
PCR amplifications were then ligated into the pMD18-T
vector (TaKaRa, Dalian), and the fragments were
sequenced using an ABI 3100A Genetic Analyzer. The
sequences obtained from the same subclone were
assembled into error-free consensus sequences using
SeqMan II software (DNAStar, Version 6.0). These
sequences were compared with our ESTs and published
sequences in the GenBank database using the BLASTn
program. Exon-intron structures of genes were doublechecked using the Sim4 Program for spliced alignments
[50].
Evolutionary analyses

DNA or protein sequences were aligned with the MUSCLE program [51] with manual adjustments. The number of nucleotide substitutions per site (Kn) in the noncoding regions (introns) was estimated using the Kimura
2-parameter model, and the numbers of nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site (dN) and per nonsynonymous (dS) in the putative protein-coding regions were
computed for pairs according to the method of the realistic evolutionary model in PAML [52]. Neighbor-joining
(NJ) trees were constructed using the software MEGA
version 4 [53], and the maximum likelihood (ML) trees
were constructed using phylip-3.68 [54], evaluated by
1000 bootstrap replications, considering ML bootstrap
proportions > 70% to indicate significant support, with
transition-transversion ratios estimated from the data
(implemented in tree-puzzle-5.2 [55]). There are several
inframe indels in the coding region of ESTs, and those
sites were removed in the sequence analysis.
In order to detect selection in a toxin subfamily, the
likelihood ratio test (LRT), implemented in PAML4.2,
was employed to detect positive selection using both the
tests of M1a versus M2a and M8 versus M7 comparisons

Page 11 of 13

with the phylogeny-based approach [19,56]. The putative
coding sequences of ESTs that showed high divergence
from the other sequences in a sub-family were removed
from the analysis.
