Abstract
Background: In some populations, complete shifts in the genotype of the strain of measles
circulating in the population have been observed, with given genotypes being replaced by new
genotypes. Studies have postulated that such shifts may be attributable to differences between the
fitness of the new and the old genotypes.
Methods: We developed a stochastic model of the transmission dynamics of measles, simulating
the effects of different levels of migration, vaccination coverage and importation of new genotypes
on patterns in the persistence and replacement of indigenous genotypes.
Results: The analyses illustrate that complete replacement in the genotype of the strain circulating
in populations may occur because of chance. This occurred in >50% of model simulations, for levels
of vaccination coverage and numbers of imported cases per year which are compatible with those
observed in several Western European populations (>80% and >3 per million per year respectively)
and for the given assumptions in the model.
Conclusion: The interpretation of genotypic data, which are increasingly being collected in
surveillance programmes, needs to take account of the underlying vaccination coverage and the
level of the importation rate of measles cases into the population.

Background
Genotyping is increasingly being used in measles surveillance programmes and to monitor the success of elimination programmes [1]. In some populations, e.g. Germany,
complete shifts in the genotype of the predominant circulating strain have been observed, with given genotypes
being replaced altogether by new genotypes [2].
Such changes have been attributed to an increased fitness
of the new genotype, as compared with that of the previous genotype circulating in the population [3]. In practice,

such changes may also occur because of many different
factors, including chance, the level of control achieved
through vaccination and the number of measles viruses
which enter the population through importations. For
example, in populations in which many individuals have
been immunized, the diversity of strains isolated from
cases can be high, since most cases may be linked to
importations from other areas, and the high level of
immunity in the population results in most of the chains
of transmission being small. In such situations, only a few
of the imported strains can establish themselves, with the

probability of this occurring depending on the importation rate.
To date, the circumstances under which replacement and
persistence of genotypes in a population occurs is poorly
understood. Using a stochastic model of the transmission
dynamics of measles, we quantify the levels of vaccination
coverage and the rate at which measles viruses enter the
population which are associated with different patterns in
persistence and replacement of existing genotypes circulating in the population.

Methods
General overview of the model
The model simulates the introduction and transmission
of measles strains with new genotypes into a population
in which, in the absence of importations, a single dominant measles genotype is circulating. In the first instance,
we consider a population comprising one city with
500,000 individuals and with regular importations of a
new genotype. We also consider an extension of this
model, namely a population comprising two cities, each
with 500,000 individuals and different degrees of interaction between the two cities. The latter scenario is comparable to the situation which might be seen e.g. in a
country.
Description of the model
The population in each city is stratified into individuals
who are susceptible to measles infection, those who are
infectious and those who are immune, either because of
previous infection or vaccination. For simplicity, individuals are not stratified by age. Vaccination or previous
infection with a strain with a given genotype is assumed
to provide solid lifelong protection against infection with
all genotypes. The model formulation is based on the classic (discrete generation) Hamer approach, which was subsequently used by Fine and Clarkson to analyse
seasonality in contact patterns[4,5]. The equations used to
formulate the model are provided in the Additional file 1.

Contact between individuals in a given city is assumed to
be random. In the two-city model, contact between individuals in different cities is assumed to be non-random. It
is determined by a parameter e (ranging between 0.01 and
0.5), which reflects the proportion of contacts that an
individual in a given city makes with individuals in the
other city, with e = 0.5 corresponding to random mixing
between individuals in the two cities (see Additional file
1). New genotypes were assumed to enter the population
as a result of importations.
The model was designed to be stochastic, with chance
determining the number of new infections with any given
genotype, the number of births and deaths into or out of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/44

the population, and whether or not an imported case
infected with a new measles genotype entered the population. This meant that, in contrast with a deterministic
model, which describes what happens on average in a
population, the model can provide estimates of the probability of replacement or persistence of an imported genotype. Table 1 summarizes the key input parameters in the
model.
The model was run 500 times considering a 40 year time
period, for levels of vaccination coverage of 0–90% and
importation rates of 1 and 3 per million per year to determine the probability of the following patterns of replacement and persistence of given genotopes occurring:
1.1. Indigenous measles genotype persists, but cases infected
with an imported genotype are observed only rarely.
1.2. Indigenous measles genotype persists, while cases infected
with an imported genotype are observed, but the transmission
of this genotype does not persist.
2. Both indigenous measles genotype and imported genotype
persist during the study period.
3.1. Indigenous measles genotype dies out, while the imported
genotype gradually becomes dominant.
3.2. Indigenous measles genotype dies out, while the imported
genotype becomes dominant quickly.
4. Transmission of neither genotype persists throughout the
study period.
To our knowledge, patterns in the persistence of genotypes have not been categorized to date, though the above
categorization appears reasonable. The probability of a
given pattern in persistence and replacement occurring
was calculated as the proportion of simulations for which
it occurred for the given vaccination and importation
assumption. The range in the importation rates used are
compatible with those estimated for England and
Wales[6]. Figure 1 summarizes the criteria used to define
the occurrence of each of the above patterns. In particular,
the criteria used to define pattern 4 (transmission of neither genotype persists throughout the study period) differs from the definition of fade out which has been used
to estimate the critical population size for measles as
being ~300,000. Pattern 4 is here defined as the presence
of the domestic genotype in <100% of all the output steps,
and the presence of the imported genotype in <50% of the
output steps during the final 10 years of the model simulations – see Figure 1). In contrast, past analyses have
defined fade out as the absence of cases over a period of at
least 3 weeks [7-9].

Results
Figure 3a summarizes the proportion of simulations of
measles transmission in a single city in which the different
patterns in genotype persistence and replacement
occurred, for different levels of vaccination coverage and
assuming a low importation rate (1/million/year).
At low levels of vaccination coverage, all patterns in persistence and replacement were predicted to occur. However, pattern 4 (transmission of neither genotype persists
during the study period) and pattern 1.1 (indigenous genotype persists but cases infected with the imported genotype are observed only rarely) were the most likely,
occurring in 55% and 25% of simulations respectively if
no individuals were vaccinated. The probability of pattern
4 occurring increased as the vaccine coverage increased,
occurring in 90% of the simulations once the vaccination
coverage was ≥60%, with rapid replacement of the indigenous genotype occurring in the remaining (10%) simulations.

With a high importation rate (3/million/year – see Figure
3b), the distribution of patterns in persistence and
replacement changed. With no vaccination, gradual
replacement with the indigenous genotype (pattern 3.1)
was the pattern which was most likely to occur, accounting for 50% of the simulations. Its relative importance
decreased as the vaccination coverage increased, whilst
the proportion of simulations in which rapid replacement
of the existing genotype occurred increased, reaching
30–45% under high levels of vaccination coverage.
The corresponding predictions for a population comprising two cities, with different degrees of interaction
between them, are summarized in Figure 4. In general, for
a given importation rate, the predictions were comparatively insensitive to assumptions about contact between
cities. For both assumptions about the importation rate,
rapid replacement of the indigenous genotype was
unlikely to occur if the vaccination coverage was low e.g.
occurring in 0–2% of the simulations if no individuals
were vaccinated. However, the probability of rapid
replacement occurring increased as the vaccination coverage increased, accounting for 30% and 70% of the simulations if the importation rate was 1 and 3 per million per

Discussion
Genotyping is increasingly being applied in the surveillance of measles transmission. To date, several patterns in
the persistence and replacement of measles strains have
been observed. In Germany, a rapid reduction in the prevalence of indigenous genotypes, including C2 and D6, has
been seen, which has coincided with the emergence of D7
viruses[2]. It has been suggested that such changes may
occur because of an increased fitness of D7 genotypes as
compared with that of the C2 and D6[3]. Our analyses
indicate that such changes can occur by chance in most
settings, irrespective of the fitness of the genotypes and
need not have negative implications for the success of
elimination programmes.
For example, in settings with a low vaccination coverage,
model predictions suggested that all patterns in the persistence and replacement could occur. In settings with a
high vaccination coverage e.g. >80%, rapid replacement
of the indigenous genotype was predicted to occur in 30%
of the model simulations, even if the importation rate was
low (1 case per million per year – see Figure 4). In settings
in which the importation rate of new measles genotypes

was high e.g. 3 cases per million per year, rapid replacement of the indigenous genotype was predicted to occur
in approximately 70% of the simulations if the vaccination coverage was over 80% (Figure 4).
The levels of vaccination coverage associated with rapid
replacement in the model are compatible with those
which have been observed in Germany and other European populations. Since 1990, for example, trivalent measles-mumps-rubella
(MMR)
vaccine
has
been
recommended in Germany for those aged 11–14 months
(1st dose) and 15–23 months (2nd dose). Vaccination
coverage during the period 1998–2001 for the first dose
was reported to be 90.3% and 20% for the second dose
[10]. Similarly high vaccination coverages of over 80%
have been observed elsewhere in Europe, e.g. France, Denmark, Finland, the UK and Sweden [11], though the patterns in the persistence and replacement in measles strains
which have occurred in these settings remain unknown.
We have considered two types of settings in our analyses,
namely a population comprising a single city (which is
analogous to the situation e.g. in an island) and a population comprising 2 cities, each comprising 500,000 individuals with differing degrees of interaction between the
two. Many different, and potentially, more realistic,

assumptions relating to population structure or contact
between individuals could have been incorporated in the
model e.g. considering populations comprising five or ten
different cities and where contact between individuals
depends on age and social group. Such assumptions probably did not influence our conclusions substantially,
given that rapid replacement was predicted to occur for all
assumptions about contact between individuals in the
model population, if the vaccination coverage was in a
realistic range (i.e. ≥40%) and if the importation rate was
about 3 cases per million per year. Such importation rates
are compatible those observed in reality [6].
The model has examined the situation in which only 2
genotypes are circulating in a population and all imported
cases are infected with same genotype. It is recognized
that, in reality, the diversity of genotypes circulating in a
population is strongly related to the extent of control of
measles transmission and the genotypes observed are
sometimes specific to the setting.
In central and western Africa for example, members of
clade B have been isolated, whereas the A, D2 and D4 genotypes have been found in South Africa [12]. In populations in which control of measles transmission has not
been achieved, the diversity is typically low [13]. In China
[14], Nepal and Japan [15], one or two distinct genotypes
have been observed. In some African settings, a few
domestic MV strains have remained endemic e.g. in
Nigeria and Ghana, two distinct virus genotypes appear to
be co-circulating [16]. In Russia and central Europe, genotype intermixing occurs, with a number of distinct genotypes having been seen in several countries during the late
1980s and 1990s [3]. In contrast, in the USA and Germany, where vaccination coverage has been high, several
different genotypes have been observed. Phylogenetic
analysis in Germany revealed the presence of at least six
measles virus genotypes including B3, C2, D4, D6, G2 and
D7.
Recent workers have suggested that certain MV with a
lower susceptibility to existing neutralizing antibodies
may have a selective advantage for replacing the domestic
MV genotype [2] and that the wild type MVs have various
features which means that they react with different monoclonal antibodies and lead to nucleotide sequence diversity. To date, there has been little discussion of whether
the D7 genotype has any selective biological advantage.
Though this is plausible, the fact that the D7 genotype
does not yet predominate in other countries suggests that
this may be unlikely.
Our analyses have not accounted for potential genetic or
antigenic drift in the measles virus. So far, any mutational
drifts, such as those which have been observed in South

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/8/44

Africa between the late 1980s and the mid 1990s[12] or in
Madrid between the late 1960s and mid 1990s [17], have
been small. As a result, vaccinated individuals have typically been protected against infection with these drift variants. It is biologically plausible that significant genetic
drift in RNA viruses due to lack of proof reading by RNA
polymerase may result in a lowering of the vaccine efficacy. For example, Fayolle et al characterized a natural
mutation in an antigenic site involved in neutralization
and showed antigenic drift by vaccine antibodies [18].
Some of the issues discussed may well be relevant for
interpreting molecular epidemiological data for mumps,
rubella and other infections. Based on the results derived
from encoding five protein products, the E1 gene
sequence has been used for genotyping and phylogenetic
analyses of rubella viruses [19]. Rubella viruses from
Europe, Asia, and North America have belonged to a single genotype (Rubella Genotype I or RGI), while in Asia
(China and India) and Italy, a distant phylogenetic
branch was found, which has been designated Rubella
Genotype II (RGII). Du-Ping Zheng et al indicated that the
temporal pattern of isolation of viruses in the European
branches and sub-branches might be related to temporal
displacement of genotypic groups[19]. Inou Y el al have
also investigated the distribution of mumps virus genotypes in Japan by nucleotide sequencing part of the
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and small hydrophobic (SH) protein regions and have found that genotypes B and K co-circulated in the 1990s and had been
replaced by genotype G in the year 2000 [20].
A recent review of the global distribution of measles genotypes has highlighted the fact that the distribution, diversity and types of measles genotypes differs substantially
between populations [21]. Overall, our analyses have
highlighted that the patterns in the persistence and
replacement of measles genotypes depend on several factors, including the vaccination coverage and the number
of cases imported into the population each year. In addition they have suggested that complete replacement measles of genotypes, such as that which has been observed in
Germany [3], could occur by chance, with the probability
being greatest if both the vaccination coverage and the
number of cases imported into the population are high.
Such insights should prove useful for interpreting patterns
in the persistence and replacement of genotypes which
may occur in the future.

Conclusion
In this study, we illustrate that sudden genotype shifts
may occur as a result of chance, with their probability of
occurrence being about 70% for levels of vaccination coverage and numbers of imported cases per year which are
compatible with those observed in several Western Euro-

pean populations (>80% and >3 per million per year
respectively), using a stochastic model of the transmission
dynamics of measles. These findings suggest that the interpretation of genotypic data needs to take account of the
underlying vaccination coverage and the level of the
importation rate of measles cases into the population.
