Abstract
Background: Sequence identification of ESTs from non-model species offers distinct challenges
particularly when these species have duplicated genomes and when they are phylogenetically
distant from sequenced model organisms. For the common carp, an environmental model of
aquacultural interest, large numbers of ESTs remained unidentified using BLAST sequence
alignment. We have used the expression profiles from large-scale microarray experiments to
suggest gene identities.
Results: Expression profiles from ~700 cDNA microarrays describing responses of 7 major tissues
to multiple environmental stressors were used to define a co-expression landscape. This was based
on the Pearsons correlation coefficient relating each gene with all other genes, from which a
network description provided clusters of highly correlated genes as 'mountains'. We show that
these contain genes with known identities and genes with unknown identities, and that the
correlation constitutes evidence of identity in the latter. This procedure has suggested identities to
522 of 2701 unknown carp ESTs sequences. We also discriminate several common carp genes and
gene isoforms that were not discriminated by BLAST sequence alignment alone. Precision in
identification was substantially improved by use of data from multiple tissues and treatments.
Conclusion: The detailed analysis of co-expression landscapes is a sensitive technique for
suggesting an identity for the large number of BLAST unidentified cDNAs generated in EST
projects. It is capable of detecting even subtle changes in expression profiles, and thereby of
distinguishing genes with a common BLAST identity into different identities. It benefits from the use
of multiple treatments or contrasts, and from the large-scale microarray data.

Background
Transcript screening investigations have traditionally
been led by sequence analysis of cDNA clone collections

to define the identity of hybridisation probes included on
microarrays for expression profiling [1]. Despite this, all
eukaryotic EST collections contain large proportions of

transcripts (~50%) that remain unidentified by unattended BLAST protocols. Some of these may represent
new, undiscovered protein-coding or non-protein-coding
transcripts [2-4]. Others may arise from untranslated
regions of coding sequence RNA, which being non-conserved fail to align to reference databases. Finally, some
may be concatenated constructs generated artefactually
during the production of cDNA libraries.
We have experienced these kinds of difficulty in our analysis of ESTs from the common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., a
well-used model species for research into environmental
responses [5], and which is the subject of a substantial
aquaculture interest for both food and ornamental uses.
The common carp genome is widely thought to have
become duplicated within the previous 12-15 Mya, and
many duplicate paralogs are retained [6-8] to complicate
the analysis. We originally generated a medium-scale collection of ~13.5K directional, cDNA clones from multiple
tissues [9], though this has more recently been increased
[10]. 9,202 directional EST were assembled into 6,033
transcriptional units. Of these only 3,252 were BLASTidentified leaving 2,701 as unclassified, many of which
displayed interesting expression properties in response to
a range of chronic stress treatments [9].
Additional information regarding the identity of ESTs
may come from the comparison of expression profiles of
one microarray probe with another since different probes
arising from the same gene should have very highly correlated profiles whilst probes with an identical BLAST identity but arising from different members of a gene family
might present divergent expression profiles. Either way,
co-expression indices can be used as evidence in seeking
an identity for a BLAST-unidentified cDNA clone, and can
separate putative isoforms. To explore the limits of expression profiling, and the extent to which dissimilar but coregulated genes may confound the process, we have accumulated data from a very large number of microarray
hybridisations, including RNA from all of the major
organs of common carp exposed to a range of environmental stresses, including chronic cooling [9], chronic
hypoxia [11] and starvation/refeeding protocols. This
large dataset represents a substantial data resource that
can be used to suggest gene identity through correlation
analysis. Here we describe the Expression Alignment
(ExprAlign) technique for assigning a putative gene identity, which, following the pioneering work of Kim et al.
[12,13], is based on the clustering of gene expression profiles [14-17]. This resolves a number of issues relating to
the identification of probes that were unidentified by conventional unattended BLASTx procedures, including those
from untranslated regions of transcripts.

Methods
ESTs resource and common carp microarray data
We used the EST resources from carpBASE 2.1, which was
constructed by the EST analysis package EST-ferret 2.1
http://legr.liv.ac.uk. This comprised the 13,349 directional cDNA clones already described [10], of which 9202
were 5' end sequenced, BLASTx identified and annotated
with gene ontology, KEGG and CDD terms.

The cDNA microarray used in this work has been
described in [9] and [11], and comprised 13440 PCRamplified cDNA probes, including blanks and standards.
The raw expression data has been deposited in ArrayExpress E-MAXD-1 and E-MAXD-10, respectively. The gene
expression data used in this analysis comprised 707 common carp RNA samples, hybridised to 1414 cDNA microarrays, all using a reference-based, dye-swap design
against a common reference using dye-swap, and with 4fold or greater biological replication. These experiments
were conducted with ethical approval and corresponding
personal and project licences of the Home Office, U.K 189
RNA samples were generated from the study of chronic
cold stress [9], including samples for time-course after
transfer from a preconditioning temperature of 30°C to
23°C, 17°C, and 10°C. Tissues examined were brain, gill,
heart, intestine, kidney, liver and skeletal muscle. 414
RNA samples were used in a time-course study of hypoxia
stress [11] in 4 tissues (brain, heart, intestine, liver and
skeletal muscle), conducted at two temperatures (17°C
and 30°C). 104 samples were from a study of starvation
over a 6-week time course during which the animals were
starved and then re-fed (I. Hardevig and A.R. Cossins,
unpublished). The 'starvation' data included samples for
liver and skeletal muscle only. Normalisation and statistical processing of the resulting data has been previously
described [9,11] using established techniques [18].
Computing and filtering Pearson's correlation coefficients
The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r)
was calculated for every pair of array probes. To speed this
up a programme called "CORR" http://legr.liv.ac.uk was
written in C, resulting in completion in approximately 40
minutes using a single Linux machine. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were implemented as
described in Additional File 1, Section A, to optimize the
threshold of the correlations [19]. The resulting criterion
was used to filter the r-values, and the selected relationships were stored in a spreadsheet consisting of a few
thousand gene-pairs (the rows), with coefficient scores.

The optimized threshold for filtering Pearson correlation
coefficients was determined by plotting the sensitivity
(True Positive, P+) of the comparison against the selectivity (False Positive, P-). The sensitivity P+ indicates the
probability of the observed true positives at a threshold

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/560

and the selectivity P- shows the probability for the
observed true negatives at a threshold. On the other hand,
the probability of the missed true positives was given by
(1 - P+) and the probability of the missed true negatives by
(1 - P-). The total probability of missing the true positives
and true negatives was given by E = (1 - P+) + (1 - P-), this
providing the optimal threshold. The calculations for P
and E are detailed in the Additional File 1, Section A.
Visualising expression alignments
The VxInsight package [20-22] was implemented for clustering gene expressions using the Pearson's correlation
coefficients and to visualise the alignments. The VxInsight
package consists of three parts: VxOrd, VxInsight and
VxImport. VxOrd implements the force-directed ordination algorithm to assign the X, Y coordinates for each gene
on a 2-dimensional surface based on the clone pair similarities of correlation coefficients. Then the coordinate
maps were converted to the 3-dimensional mountain terrains in VxInsight. Finally, VxImport loaded the gene
annotation from carpBASE 2.1 into VxInsight for biological interpretations.

Figure 1 illustrates the stages used in ExprAlign to generate
a landscape depiction of the expression profile, starting
from the microarray intensity data and ending with the
production of the colour-rendered 3D landscape.
Post ExprAlign analysis
Groups of cDNA clones included within landscape features were assessed using BLASTx, searches as described
previously [10] followed by mapping of FASTA sequences
onto the zebrafish genome v8 as described by Christoffels
et al. [23], or onto common carp fosmid clones BX571686
and BX571725 [24]. Details of Pearsons correlation coefficient of closely related clones, and of mountain allocations, have been included as part of the clone entry in
carpBASE2.1.

Results
Correlation analysis
Using normalised data generated from 707 RNA preparations from the cold and hypoxia datasets, each containing
~13,440 cDNA probes from multiple tissues we calculated
the Pearson correlation coefficient [25] between every pair
of probes represented on the microarray. This required
~180 million calculations, covering different combination of stress and time, as well as all different tissues. We
then used a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) procedure [19] to optimize the threshold that minimises the
representation of false positives at 0.858. The coefficients
below this value were discarded leaving 30868 correlation
coefficients representing 3039 gene probes for construction of the landscape.

Network analysis using 3D landscape for visualisation
We then created a network representation of the r-values
that exceeded the ROC threshold, which was ordinated
and visualized using VxInsight [20]. This clustered groups
of gene probes with high r-values between them using a
force-repulsion model and represented them as features in
a 3-dimensional landscape metaphor, as an aid to easy
interpretation (see Figures 2a and 2b). The height of each
landscape feature was an indication of the number of gene
probes contained within it, and large-scale features
('mountains', 'hills') can include a number of smaller features ('hillocks'). The 3039 gene probes previously identified comprised 1192 possessing a BLASTx identity whilst
the remaining 1847 were unclassifiable. Big mountains
were located around the centre of the landscape while
smaller mountains were positioned away from the centre.
The distance between each feature, both large and small,
was representative of the r-values that connect the features. Thus a small distance between landscape features

Dependency of landscape features upon scale and
diversity of datasets
To determine whether the structure of the gene co-expression landscape and the clustering of genes was influenced
by the particular dataset used in their construction, we
recalculated the landscape using only the data from the
386 arrays generated for the cooling experiment [9]. In
this case 4236 microarray probes exceeded the ROC
threshold and were ordinated onto the landscape map,
comprising 1776 identified and 2460 unclassifiable gene
probes. 46 mountains (labeled 'CE', 'cold expression')
were generated of which 22 were identified.

indicates that each cluster of gene probes was more similar to each other than if they were more distantly linked.
To assess the significance of the topographical patterns
revealed by this process, we permuted the expression table
by shuffling the values for all probes across all arrays. The
resulting r-values were uniformly low with only 3 pairs of
probes with r > 0.858, and 33870 with r > 0.25. We used
the latter data to generate a landscape shown in Figure 2c,
which showed no structuring. This indicates that the landscape features evident in Figure 2a do not result from random effects in the underlying data, and represent
biologically significant outcomes.

We then compared the landscape features for both the GE
and CE datasets (provided in reduced form in Figure 3,
and shown in full in Additional File 1, Figure S1) using a
matrix in which cells contained the number of gene
probes that were included in corresponding landscape
features. We found 21 highly similar mountain-pairs
between GE and CE mountains, indicated by greyed cells.
However, we noted some differences between the two
landscapes. Thus, the clones in mountain CE209 were
separately located in GE142 and GE103; clones in CE178
were separately located in GE111 and GE16b; and the
clones in CE149 were separately located in GE142 and
GE116. Feature CE26 (see Additional File 1, Figure S1)
was linked to three GE features, namely GE35 (apolipoprotein A-I), GE17 (transferrin) and GE13 (transferrin).
Moreover, CE119 (creatine kinases) was linked to GE57
and GE24 (both labelled as creatine kinases); and CE121
(parvalbumins) were broken down to GE16 and GE14b
(both parvalbumins). The splitting of CE features into two
GE features might indicate the separation of isoforms.
We conclude that the discrimination between closely
linked gene clusters was significantly affected either by the
scale or by the diversity of the data used in their construction. We then tested which of these was the important factor by randomly discarding 50% of the arrays included in
the GE dataset. The resulting landscape contained 2444
clones in 27 mountains (labelled 'RE', randomised expression) of which 12 were identified. We then compared the
contents of landscape features of the RE dataset with the
original GE dataset (summarised in Figure 4 and displayed in full in Additional File 1, Figure S2). This shows
that 17 of the RE mountains were related to single features
on the GE landscape, and that the 'identity' of these features was conserved. However, 11 of the RE mountains
were linked to multiple GE mountains; for example,
RE237 and RE174 were each linked to 3 different features
in the GE landscape. Thus, whilst the main features of the
landscape were robust to reductions in the amount of
array data some were sensitive to increasing data complexity, as produced by undertaking more diverse experimental treatments.

within that landscape feature. The GE features are listed in
Table 1. The numbers contained within individual cells indicate the number of microarray probes common to the linked
GE and CE features. The denser colour represents a greater
level of the agreement.
Relating unidentified or unclassifiable clones to identified
genes
To test the significance of the representation of identified
genes within each of the landscape features we computed
p-values for the GE dataset for each gene identity using
Fisher's exact test. Table 1 lists the p-values, all of which
lay between 1013 and 10101, indicating highly significant
enrichment of the identified gene within the mountain.

Secondly, we examined individual clusters either by
attended curation of the ESTs followed by BLASTx or by
mapping clones onto the zebrafish genome. Thus, for
mountain GE13c, only 4 clones recovered a BLASTx hit for

frame shift correction. A further 6 were confirmed as
belonging to this gene using BLASTn against the 2 available common carp fosmid clones but in the untranslated
region, two of them being very short sequence reads. The
three remaining clones failed to provide a sequence, but
were inferred as being the same gene. Mountain GE10d
contained only unidentifiable sequences (thus, not
included in the listing of identified mountains in Table 1),

ences. Mountain GE10 contained 5 ESTs that were
identified by BLASTx as myoglobin, and 5 ESTs that were
frame shift corrected also to BLASTx as myoglobin.
Finally, in mountain GE113, 50 of the 55 identified genes
(i.e. ~91%) were BLASTed as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase. The p-value for this identity (6e-101) was
very highly significant. However, 5 ESTs showed homology to different genes including microglobulin, adenylate
kinse, 60S ribosomal protein, and a glycoprotein precursor. The remaining 58 clones lacking sequence data were
thus inferred as having the same identity as the predominant gene.

sequence alignments. Figure 5 shows that resolution
between isoforms depended mainly on expression differences in the chronic cold-exposure experiment, and in just
3 tissues; brain, gill, heart and kidney. Thus, aldolase A
was up-regulated not only in hypoxia muscle (17°C) but
also in hypoxia liver, hypoxia brain, hypoxia intestine
(30°C), cold brain, cold gill, cold heart, cold intestine and
cold kidney. Aldolase B was up-regulated in cold-intestine, cold heart, hypoxia muscle 17°C, hypoxia intestine
30°C and hypoxia liver. Previous work [29] compared the
absolute level of the gene expression of aldolase isoforms,
but our study focused on stress-regulated changes.

For large mountains, in particular, we found multiple
identified genes being represented, making it difficult to
ascribe a single identity to unidentified clones. In some
cases we have generated 3-5 sub-clusters using the Kmeans technique, each of which displayed a more singular gene identity with which to infer an identity for the
unidentified or un-sequenced ESTs (see below).

(ii) Parvalbumins
carpBASE2.1 contained 89 clones identified as parvalbumin. All of these were located in 8 entirely separate clusters that were positioned around the edge of the landscape
(Figure 2a: P1 to P8), indicating very divergent expression
patterns. Two distinct phylogenetic lineages for parvalbumins have previously been delineated: α and β [30,31],
and manual sequence alignment a single α isoform (α1)
and 8 β isoforms, (β1- β8), all of which are expressed as
proteins [32]. The β6 isoform was located in P7 (GE16,
see Figure 2b), P6 included β7, P3 included β5, whilst P1
(GE14b) contained β6, β7 and β1.

Using these methods, we inferred a tentative identity for a
total of 522 unidentified ESTs, which represented 17% of
the 3039 unidentified ESTs. These are listed in Additional
File 1, Table S1. From this it is evident that many clones
failed to generate sequence data during the automated
sequence analysis, yet they provided informative amplicons for array fabrication.
Discrimination of gene isoforms by ExprAlign
We have explored the extent to which ExprAlign supplements sequence alignment in distinguishing isoforms
with gene families. Figure 5 (and Additional File 1, Section B) shows for a number of co-expression mountains
the changes in transcript expression of constituent clones
as a conventional heatmap across all three experimental
conditions.
(i) Fructose-bisphosphate aldolases
Vertebrates possess three tissue-specific isoforms of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase [26-28]: A (muscle and red
blood cells), B (liver, kidney, stomach and intestine) and
C (brain, heart and ovary) [29]. Assembly of our common
carp ESTs identified these three 3 isoforms: S341 (the prefix 'S' signifies an assembled sequence group from carpBASE 2.1; aldolase A), S488 (aldolase B) and S698
(aldolase C).

Aldolase A and B were separately resolved into two neighboring mountains: GE17b containing only S341 (isoform
A) and GE33 containing only S488 (isoform B). The close
proximity of these mountains in Figure 2 was indicative of
the similarity of their expression patterns (see Figure 5),
yet ExprAlign cleanly resolved even these subtly different
expression patterns in precise agreement with the

(iii) Transferrin variant A
Crucian carp (C. auratus) has two transferrin variants [33],
whilst silver crucian carp (C. auratus gibelio) has 5 and
white crucian carp (C. auratus cuvieri) has 3 [34]. We
found that ESTs blasting to transferrin variant A were
located in two mountains, GE13 and GE17 that were
located in two separate locations but in the same sector of
the landscape. Whilst overall the expression profiles (Figure 5) were similar differences were noted in intestinal
and cardiac tissues exposed to hypoxia. However,
sequence alignment of the ESTs in these two mountains
failed to demonstrate any sequence clustering which
related to the separate expression mountains. The lengths
of the GenBank accessions for carp transferrin variants
(AF457152, EU71532-EU71535) were over 2200 bp
whilst our ESTs were ~400 bp of which only 200 bp could
be used for sequence alignment. So it is most likely that
the mountains contain different isoforms and that the
sequence domains linked to these expression differences
lay outside of the sequenced stretches.
(iv) Apolipoproteins
The apolipoprotein gene family were represented in five
different mountains, namely GE11 (containing apolipoprotein C-I precursor, apoC-I), GE14 (apolipoprotein Eb
precursor, apo-Eb), GE35 (apolipoprotein A-I, apoA-1),
GE125 (14-kDa apolipoprotein, apo-14 kDa) and GE79
(mixed apolipoprotein & its precursor). Pufferfish apoA-I
was expressed mainly in liver but apo-14 kDa was mainly

expressed in liver and less abundantly in brain [35]. We
show in common carp that some members of this gene
family displayed hypoxia responses notably in the intestine (GE35, Figure 4). By contrast, the features GE11 and
GE14 showed stress responses of apoC-I and apo-Eb genes
in brain and intestine, respectively. The transcripts of the
latter gene were also observed in gill.
~85% of BLAST-identified clones in GE79 were apolipoproteins (Table 1). Using the K-means method we subclustered the gene probes within GE79 into 5 clusters (K1
to K5, see Figure 5) which were linked to specific gene
identities; thus, GE79-K3 was related to fatty acid-binding
protein, GE79-K1 to apoA-I, GE79-K4 to apoEb precursor,
and GE79-K2 and GE79-K5 were related to apoA-IV precursors. Mountain GE125 was split into 4 K-means sub-

clusters: GE125-K3 and GE125-K4 were 14 kDa (fishspecified) apolipoproteins, GE125-K2 was related to
other apolipoproteins, and GE125-K1 was unknown.
(v) Creatine kinases
Creatine kinases were located in mountains GE57 and
GE24. Vertebrates typically express four isoforms:
cytosolic muscle type (M-CK), cytosolic brain type (BCK), mitochondrial ubiquitous, acidic type (Miu-CK),
and mitochondrial sarcomeric, basic type (Mis-CK) and
three M-CK sub-isoforms (M1-CK, M2-CK, and M3-CK)
have been reported for common carp [36], and were confirmed proteomically [37]. K-means clustering split GE57
into 3 sub-clusters; GE57-K2 was designated M2-CK, and
GE57-K3 as M3-CK. GE57-K1 contained unidentified
ESTs, which might be M1 or other isoform.

Discussion
Approximately 46% of the singletons and assembled contigs in our common carp EST project failed to yield an
identity using the unattended BLASTx procedure [10],
some of which represent non-overlapping, or 3' sequences
of identified genes. Other clones failed to yield a sequence
on automated analysis yet provided suitable hybridisation probes on the microarray. Given these special problems and complications in this species due to a recently
duplicated genome, the sometimes incoherent nature of
subsequent gene losses [24], and the divergent tissue- and
response-specific expression patterns so generated [9], we
have explored how expression alignment techniques
might complement the more usual sequence alignment
methods to assign an identity for an otherwise unidentifiable sequence.
Our approach was based on the idea that expression profiles for non-overlapping probes derived from a same
gene should be highly correlated when tested across a
range of experimental treatments, and this should enable
unidentified clones to be identified by comparison with
identified clones. Similarly, comparing expression profiles for cDNA microarray probes possessing the same
BLASTx identity, offers a means of testing their common
identity, given that they may represent unrecognised isoforms or variants of a given gene. Thus, combining alignment of sequence data with that from gene expression
data offers a useful means of improving the quality of
gene identification, and for discriminating isoforms or
members of gene families whose separate identify may
not easily be made evident using conventional methods.
For this work we chose to include all available cDNA
clones on the microarray, resulting in up to 80 clones per
contig, and to gather expression profiles from a wide
range of major organs and tissues, exposed to a range of
experimental treatments. Consequently, the carp array
included the substantial repetition of some genes and this
provided greater support for the identified gene clusters.
Our approach was based on the comparison of the expression profiles of pairs of probes using Pearsons correlation
coefficients which were used to create a network linking
genes together on the basis of their shared expression
properties. The VxInsight algorithm uses a force-repulsion
mechanism to gather the distributed gene networks into
discrete clusters, which are then presented in an easy-tounderstand landscape metaphor.
We show that the resulting landscape features, and the
associated clusters were robust, first, because permuting
and randomising the expression values generated neither
high correlation coefficients nor landscape features, and
second, because the form of the clusters are largely
retained when using different scales of array data from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/560

small to large. We show that datasets that contain a wider
range of experimental treatments and tissues can fragment
the gene clusters into smaller forms, each with a distinctive character. Thus, the exact level of discrimination
achieved depends upon the diversity of the data used in its
construction, with extra experimental treatments offering
additional changes in the expression relationships
between genes, thereby refining the resulting correlations.
Gene identification using ExprAlign
Many of the resulting landscape features or mountains
generated by VxInsight contained predominantly just one
kind of BLAST-identified gene, and we show that there is
substantial enrichment of these genes within the features
compared to chance alone. Thus unidentified probes
within that mountain were also tentatively labelled with
that gene identity. Using this approach we were able to
impute an identity to 522 unidentified clones in the GE
landscape, which represented ~17% of all unidentified
clones on the map. The validity of this assignment can be
tested by the attended analysis of the clone sequences.
This was achieved for mountain GE10 which possessed 5
different probes identified as myoglobin by BLASTx, and
another 5 probes lacking an identify. Closer inspection of
the corresponding sequences, and manual attempts at
alignment, were subsequently able to demonstrate that all
of the unidentified ESTs were also myoglobin, including
additional examples of a unique brain-specific isoform
[11]. This indicates the limitations of unattended BLAST
analysis, and where appropriate, the need for manual verification of clones assigned with an ExprAlign identity. A
similar result was obtained for parvalbumin [32].
Separation of isoforms using ExprAlign
ExprAlign has also proved useful in separating clones that
have been assigned a common BLASTx identity but which
have distinctive expression profiles. If clones possessing
the same gene BLAST identity were indeed sourced from
the same transcriptional start site, then they should display identical expression patterns. On the other hand, if
the clones were representative of different isoforms with
distinctive expression properties, then they would occupy
different features on the expression landscape, or could be
distinguished using additional clustering techniques. We
show that these expectations are largely met for a series of
test cases, as described above. As a further example, in the
case of fatty acid-binding protein (mountain GE17c, not
shown), we identified 13 cDNA clones all possessing the
same BLASTx sequence alignment, but which displayed
two contrasting expression profiles. In this particular case,
the differences were very subtle and limited to just one tissue (liver) responding to just one treatment condition
(hypoxia at 17°C). Separation required application of Kmeans clustering to the genes contained within the landscape feature. This again indicates that the level of func-

tional dissection possible by ExprAlign depends to a
significant extent on the diversity of treatments for which
array data is generated.

Conclusion
By leveraging large-scale microarray data, the ExprAlign
approach offers a practical aid to gene identification, and
for the discovery of novel isoforms or variants of known
genes. It bears comparison with the more conventional
sequence alignment techniques in that both depend upon
an association of co-expression properties, or sequence
alignment, respectively, with a set of known standards.
Both are limited by the available data, and both have limitations. We show that ExprAlign identifies subtle differences in expression properties which may not be evident
from sequence similarity, particularly if the sequence data
is limited to the 800 bp provided by a typical single pass
read or if clones fail to generate sequence in automated
procedures. Finally, it reveals ESTs possessing the same
BLAST identity but which have distinctive expression profiles.
