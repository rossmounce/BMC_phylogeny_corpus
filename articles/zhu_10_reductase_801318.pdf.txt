The reductase domain in a Type I fatty acid
synthase from the apicomplexan Cryptosporidium
parvum: Restricted substrate preference towards
very long chain fatty acyl thioesters
Guan Zhu1,2*, Xiangyu Shi1, Xiaomin Cai1

Abstract
Background: The apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum genome possesses a 25-kb intronless open reading frame
(ORF) that predicts a multifunctional Type I fatty acid synthase (CpFAS1) with at least 21 enzymatic domains.
Although the architecture of CpFAS1 resembles those of bacterial polyketide synthases (PKSs), this megasynthase is
predicted to function as a fatty acyl elongase as our earlier studies have indicated that the N-terminal loading unit
(acyl-[ACP] ligase) prefers using intermediate to long chain fatty acids as substrates, and each of the three internal
elongation modules contains a complete set of enzymes to produce a saturated fatty acyl chain. Although the
activities of almost all domains were confirmed using recombinant proteins, that of the C-terminal reductase
domain (CpFAS1-R) was yet undetermined. In fact, there were no published studies to report the kinetic features of
any reductase domains in bacterial PKSs using purified recombinant or native proteins.
Results: In the present study, the identity of CpFAS1-R as a reductase is confirmed by in silico analysis on
sequence similarity and characteristic motifs. Phylogenetic analysis based on the R-domains supports a previous
notion on the bacterial origin of apicomplexan Type I FAS/PKS genes. We also developed a novel assay using fatty
acyl-CoAs as substrates, and determined that CpFAS1-R could only utilize very long chain fatty acyl-CoAs as
substrates (i.e., with activity on C26 > C24 > C22 > C20, but no activity on C18 and C16). It was capable of using
both NADPH and NADH as electron donors, but prefers NADPH to NADH. The activity of CpFAS1-R displayed
allosteric kinetics towards C26 hexacosanoyl CoA as a substrate (h = 2.0; Vmax = 32.8 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein; and
K50 = 0.91 mM).
Conclusions: We have confirmed the activity of CpFAS1-R by directly assaying its substrate preference and kinetic
parameters, which is for the first time for a Type I FAS, PKS or non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) reductase
domain. The restricted substrate preference towards very long chain fatty acyl thioesters may be an important
feature for this megasynthase to avoid the release of product(s) with undesired lengths.

Background
Cryptosporidium is a group of important parasites that
infect a wide range of hosts from reptiles and birds to
humans and other mammals [1-3]. Among them,
C. parvum is zoonotic and infects both humans and

individuals may cause self-limiting diarrhea, but its infection in immunocompromized patients can be chronic and
life-threatening [4,5]. Therefore, it is an important opportunistic pathogens in AIDS patients. Additionally, there are
no effective treatments against cryptosporidial infection in
AIDS patients.
The Cryptosporidium genus belongs to the Phylum
Apicomplexa that also contains many important human
and animal parasites such as Plasmodium, Theileria,
Toxoplasma, Eimeria and Cyclospora [6]. However,
Cryptosporidium is known to be evolutionarily and

metabolically divergent from other apicomplexans. For
example, as a group of early branch apicomplexans,
Cryptosporidium lacks an apicoplast and its associated
metabolic pathways (e.g., isoprenoid and Type II fatty
acid synthetic pathways). It has also virtually lost the
capacity to synthesize any nutrients de novo [6-9]. On
the other hand, this parasite possesses a unique Type I
fatty acid synthase (CpFAS1) and a putative polyketide
synthase (CpPKS1) that are encoded by 25-kb and 40-kb
intronless open reading frames (ORFs), respectively
[10-12]. The megasynthase CpFAS1 is defined by at
least 21 enzymatic domains including a loading unit
(containing a fatty acyl ligase [AL] and an acyl carrier
protein [ACP]); three internal module, each containing a

Page 2 of 8

ketoacyl synthase [KS], an acyltransferase [AT], a dehydrase [DH], an enoyl reductase [ER], a ketoacyl reductase [KR] and an ACP; and a C-terminal acyl reductase
domain (R) (Figure 1A) [10]. The AL domain loads a
fatty acid to the ACP to form an acyl-ACP, in which the
acyl chain may be elongated by the internal modules
and finally released by the R domain (Figure 1B).
Due to the extreme large size of CpFAS1, it is impractical to express the entire megasynthase for biochemical
analysis. Therefore, we have adapted a “divide and conquer” strategy and successfully expressed individual
units/modules to study their biochemical features [13].
Our previous experiments using recombinant proteins
have shown that the CpFAS1 loading unit has a

substrate preference to medium and long chain fatty
acids (MCFAs and LCFAs), and all domains within the
three internal modules are enzymatically functional, suggesting that CpFAS1 is likely involved in the elongation
of saturated fatty acid(s), rather than the de novo fatty
acid synthesis [12,13]. However, although the C-terminal
R domain was expressed, its biochemical features were
yet to be determined then due to the lack of an appropriate assay.
Here we report our recently developed assay and
experiments that reveal some unique biochemical features for the CpFAS1 acyl reductase domain (CpFAS1R) including the substrate preference and kinetics for
the first time for this family of acyl reductases. We have
not only confirmed the reductive activity of CpFAS1-R,
but also determined that it could only utilize very long
chain fatty acyl thioesters as its substrates. Additionally,
we have also performed phylogenetic analysis and
observed bacterial-affinity of reductase domains from
various apicomplexan FASs and PKSs.

Results
Sequence features and evolutionary affiliation of the
CpFAS1-R domain

Among apicomplexans, Type I FAS/PKS genes are only
discovered from Cryptosporidium and cyst-forming and
intestinal coccidia (eg. Toxoplasma and Eimeria), but
absent in the hematozoa that contain only Type II FAS
(eg. Plasmodium and Babesia) or no FAS at all (eg.
Theileria) [7,12,14-16]. Both Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma genomes contain reductase domains at the
C-terminal ends of the Type I FAS and PKS, respectively. The E. tenella genome is only partially sequenced
(see http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/E_tenella/), from
which only one reductase domain could be recovered.
The architectures of CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 resemble
bacterial and fungal PKS rather than the Type I FAS in
humans and animals [12]. Additionally, these parasite
megasynthases appear to use acyl reductase domains to
release the fatty acyl or polyketide chains as “long
chain” alcohols, rather than using thioesterase (TE) to
produce acids (Figure 1B). However, none of the apicomplexan genomes encodes any non-ribosomal peptide
synthase (NRPS) that may act alone or together with
PKSs to produce complex products.
Like most acyl reductase domains of the type I PKS
and NRPS proteins, CpFAS1-R is located at the Cterminus and is defined by approximately 780 amino
acids (aa) (Figure 1A). The first half of the domain contains conserved sequences and motifs characteristic to
acyl reductase domains of PKSs and NRPSs, and to the
fungal L-aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase
(AASDH), which include the Rossmann-fold NAD(P)H
binding site “Gx 1-2 GxxG” and a reduction motif

Page 3 of 8

“GYxxSKWxxE” (Figure 1) [17-20]. However, the
C-terminal half of the domain appears to be unique to
the apicomplexans, as it is only homologous to the
other apicomplexan FAS1 and PKS1 R domains, but not
to any other species in the databases, nor does it contain
any putative motifs.
Sequence comparisons indicated that the CpFAS1-R
domain was more closely related to those of bacterial or
fungal PKS/NRPS proteins. When CpFAS1-R domain
was used as a query to search animal protein databases,
there were no hits from vertebrate sequences. The only
hits with significantly high identities are three invertebrate proteins annotated as oxidoreductase family
or hypothetical proteins, i.e., Ciona intestinalis,
(XP_002121624, E-value = 2.E-25), Brugia malayi
(XP_001899674, 9.E-25), and Trichoplax adhaerens
(XP_002112422, 8.E-15). Other invertebrate hits with
much lower identities were a number of acyl-CoA
reductases, mainly from insects such as Drosophila
mojavensis (XP_002000602, 4.E-10) and Culex quinquefasciatus (XP_001847721, 1.E-9). This is in contrast to
the hits from bacterial and fungal proteins, in which
>420 and >170 hits displayed E-values at or smaller
than 9.E-10 and 9.E-20, respectively.
Phylogenetic reconstructions inferred from various
bacterial and fungal reductases or R domains by Bayesian inference (BI) method clearly separated fungal
AASDH from PKS/NRPS, in which major nodes were
moderately to highly supported by the posterior probability (PP) values (Figure 2). Although fungal and bacterial PKS/NRPS formed several individual clusters, they
were generally intermixed, possibly suggesting multiple
origins of fungal PKS/NRPS genes. It is noticeable that
putative oxidoreductases from two invertebrates (i.e.,
Brugia malayi and Ciona intestinalis) formed as a sister
clade of g-proteobacterial NRPS (Francisella philomiragia) (see branches colored in purple in Figure 2), suggesting a possible horizontal transfer of PKS/NRPS-like
genes from prokaryotes to certain eukaryotes.
With the exception for CpPKS1-R, all apicomplexan
FAS/PKS reductase domains (including CpFAS1-R)
formed a single cluster that is fully supported by PP
value (Figure 2, red branches). This group is then clustered together with several bacterial PKS/NRPS reductases. However, the CpPKS1-R domain alone was
unexpectedly placed within another bacterial PKS/NRPS
cluster. Although this observation is of some implication
that CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 (or their R domains) might
have different evolutionary origins, more rigorous analyses using additional domains are needed to truly make
firm conclusions. Nonetheless, these observations support a bacterial affiliation of apicomplexan FAS/PKS R
domains, as previously observed for the acyl transferase
(AT) domains from CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 [12].

CpFAS1-R domain’s substrate preference

The R domain-catalyzed release of final products by
bacterial and fungal PKS/NRPS polypeptides were
mainly determined by analyzing the products in native
or heterogeneous hosts expressing engineered PKS/
NRPS genes [20]. There were several studies that
directly observed the release/formation of products
using recombinant PKS/NRPS modules [21-23]. However, there were no reported studies to directly assay the
R domain activities and measure the kinetic parameters
in vitro. On the other hand, it is impractical (if not

impossible) to obtain sufficient pure Cryptosporidium
materials for extensive biochemical analyses, and molecular tools are also unavailable to genetically manipulate
this parasite. Therefore, heterogeneous expression systems and the use of recombinant proteins may be the
only approaches currently available to study the biochemical feature of the CpFAS1 or CpPKS1 proteins
and domains.
Suitable substrates are required to directly assay the R
domain activity. However, there are some technical difficulties in preparing the native substrates for CpFAS1-R

Zhu et al. BMC Biochemistry 2010, 11:46

(i.e., very long chain fatty acyl-ACP). On the other hand,
we have previously observed that the N-terminal AL
domains from CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 could utilize
LCFAs and CoA as substrates to form fatty acyl-CoA
[13,24], and additionally, the CpFAS1-R domain is
related to the acyl-CoA reductases (Figure 2). This
prompted us to test whether fatty acyl-CoAs could also
be used by CpFAS1-R as substrates to assay its activity.
In this study, the recombinant CpFAS1-R was
expressed and isolated into homogeneity as a maltosebinding protein (MBP)-fusion protein as previously
reported (Figure 3) [13]. However, our first attempts
using C16:0 palmitoyl-CoA as substrate and NAD(P)H
as electron donors failed to detect any activity. Considering that the final CpFAS1 product(s) could be at least
6-carbons longer than the MCFAs or LCFAs loaded by
the AL domain (i.e., after elongation by the three internal elongation modules) [12,13], we extended our analysis to include a wide range of all commercially available
long chain to very long chain fatty acyl-CoAs, and eventually observed activities. In fact, CpFAS-Red was active
on acyl-CoAs with ≥20-carbon chains, but inactive on
substrates with 18 or fewer carbons (Figure 4A). The
activities towards C20 and C22 acyl-CoAs were generally low, but well above the background, whereas activities towards C24 and C26 (the longest fatty acyl-CoA
currently available) were much more apparent. Using
NADPH as a cofactor, we have determined the kinetic
parameters of CpFAS1-R towards C26-CoA that followed allosteric kinetics (Figure 4B). The Hill slope (h)
was 2.0, indicating a positive cooperativity between the

Page 5 of 8

binding of cofactor and acyl-CoA. The maximum velocity (Vmax) and the substrate concentration to achieve
50% of the Vmax value (K50) were determined to be 32.8
nmol min -1 mg -1 protein and 0.91 mM, respectively.
The turnover rate (Kcat) was ~4.6 min-1, indicating that
CpFAS1-R could effectively transfer electrons from
NADPH to this VLC fatty acyl-CoA, but at a low efficiency. CpFAS1-R could use both NADPH and NADH
as cofactors, but it apparently prefers NADPH to
NADH as co-assayed with C26-CoA (Figure 5).

Discussion
As mentioned above, we have previously determined
that the CpFAS1-AL domain prefers LCFAs as its substrates [13]. This may act as the first checkpoint to
ensure correct fatty acids are loaded into this megasynthase for elongation. In this study, we have observed
that CpFAS1-R domain could only utilize VLC fatty
acyl-CoA, indicating that this R domain may act as a
second checkpoint to ensure that correct lengths of products can be released.
The PKS/NRPS R domains may catalyze a single-step
reduction (two-electron transfer) to produce fatty aldehyde, or a two-step reduction (four-electron transfer) to
produce fatty alcohol [20]. Therefore, it is yet unclear
whether CpFAS1-R-released products are VLC fatty
aldehydes or fatty alcohols. We have repeatedly
attempted, but failed to detect the CpFAS1-R-released
acyl chains using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and
mass spectrometry. On the other hand, TLC was able to
distinguish C16 fatty alcohol and aldehyde using

and the MBP-CpFAS1-R protein are indicated. In a typical batch of purification, >90% of the proteins were the full-length CpFAS1-R.

standards or preparations in controlled experiments
(data not shown), or by other investigators [25]. It is
possible that the limited amounts of VLC fatty acyl products were likely precipitated or aggregated after being
separated from CoA to become insoluble for TLC or
MS detection. However, since aldehydes are toxic to
cells, and no additional VLC fatty acyl reductases are
present in the Cryptosporidium genomes, we speculate
that the final products produced by CpFAS1 are likely
VLC fatty alcohols. Nonetheless, based on previously
reported data and the present study, we are able to propose a general scheme of reactions catalyzed by the various domains of CpFAS1 as shown in Figure 1B.

Since the giant CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 are structurally
and functionally different from humans Type I FAS,
these parasite megasynthases may serve as novel drug
targets. CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 also utilize R domains to
release final products, which differs from human FAS
that uses a thioesterase (TE) to product fatty acids. This
unique feature suggests that like several other enzymatic
domains, the reductase domains in CpFAS1 and
CpPKS1 may also be explored as drug targets. The production of recombinant CpFAS1-R protein together
with the novel assay developed in this study make it
possible for the screening of inhibitors for potential
drug development.

The CpFAS1-R domain protein sequence was used as a
query to repeatedly search the NCBI genome and protein databases with various BLAST algorithms. More
than 150 hits with e-values < 10 -20 were retrieved,
which included discrete enzymes or reductase domains
of multi-functional proteins. Multiple alignments were
performed using a unix-based MUSCLE program (version 3.6), and short and nearly identical sequences were
removed from the dataset. The dataset was further
refined by additional multiple alignments with MUSCLE
[26,27], and sampling of representative taxa to produce
a final dataset containing 91 taxa and 184 aa positions.
Conserved domains and motifs were identified and
visualized as sequence logos by bits with the height of

in the BI analysis. Among-site rate heterogeneity considered the fraction of invariance (F inv ) and a discrete
12-rate gamma distribution (i.e., WAG + Finv + Γ(12)). At
least 106 generation of searches were performed with
two independent runs, each containing four chains running simultaneously. The current trees were saved every
100 generations, and the posterior probability (PP)
values were calculated after the first 25% trees were discarded. The final consensus tree was visualized using a
FigTree program (version 1.3.1; http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/

The cloning of CpFAS1-R domain in a pMAL-c2x
vector and the expression and purification of maltosebinding protein (MBP)-based recombinant CpFAS1-R
(MBP-CpFAS1-R) has been previously described. The
fusion protein was purified into homogeneity and used
in our newly developed biochemical assays. Fatty acylCoAs with various carbon chain lengths (i.e., C16:0 to
C26:0) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.
and used to replace native substrates acyl-ACPs. A typical reaction was performed in a 250 μl Tris.HCl (10
mM, pH 7.2) buffer containing 50 μg MBP-CpFAS1-R,
200 μM NADPH or NADH, 200 μM specified fatty
acyl-CoA and 1 mM EDTA. The consumption of NAD
(P)H was determined spectrometrically by measuring
the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm (OD340 ) with a
Multiskan Spectrum Microplate Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific) for up to 30 min. The kinetic parameters were measured similarly with varied concentrations of C26:0 hexacosanoyl CoA (0 to 4 mM). MBP
was used as control for background subtraction. Each
assay was performed in triplicate and independently at
least twice. Enzyme activities and kinetic parameters
were calculated using a Prism software (version 5.0c for
Mac OS X) (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Nonlinear fit
used following enzyme allosteric kinetics model:

(

)

where Y is the enzyme activity, [S] is the substrate
concentration, K50 is the concentration of S to achieve
50% Vmax value (similar to Km), and h is the Hill slope.
