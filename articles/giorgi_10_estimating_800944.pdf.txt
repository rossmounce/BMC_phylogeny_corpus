Abstract
Background: The occurrence of a genetic bottleneck in HIV sexual or mother-to-infant transmission has been well
documented. This results in a majority of new infections being homogeneous, i.e., initiated by a single genetic
strain. Early after infection, prior to the onset of the host immune response, the viral population grows
exponentially. In this simple setting, an approach for estimating evolutionary and demographic parameters based
on comparison of diversity measures is a feasible alternative to the existing Bayesian methods (e.g., BEAST), which
are instead based on the simulation of genealogies.
Results: We have devised a web tool that analyzes genetic diversity in acutely infected HIV-1 patients by
comparing it to a model of neutral growth. More specifically, we consider a homogeneous infection (i.e., initiated
by a unique genetic strain) prior to the onset of host-induced selection, where we can assume a random
accumulation of mutations. Previously, we have shown that such a model successfully describes about 80% of
sexual HIV-1 transmissions provided the samples are drawn early enough in the infection. Violation of the model is
an indicator of either heterogeneous infections or the initiation of selection.
Conclusions: When the underlying assumptions of our model (homogeneous infection prior to selection and fast
exponential growth) are met, we are under a very particular scenario for which we can use a forward approach
(instead of backwards in time as provided by coalescent methods). This allows for more computationally efficient
methods to derive the time since the most recent common ancestor. Furthermore, the tool performs statistical
tests on the Hamming distance frequency distribution, and outputs summary statistics (mean of the best fitting
Poisson distribution, goodness of fit p-value, etc). The tool runs within minutes and can readily accommodate the
tens of thousands of sequences generated through new ultradeep pyrosequencing technologies. The tool is
available on the LANL website.

Background
The occurrence of a genetic bottleneck in HIV sexual or
mother-to-infant transmissions has been well documented [1,2]. This results in about 80% of new infections
being homogeneous, i.e., initiated by a single genetic
strain [3]. Due to the availability of early samples taken at
multiple time points from acute HIV subjects, we now
know that the viral population grows exponentially during the early phases of infection [4], prior to the onset of

the host immune response or significant target cell depletion. Given this simple setting, our goal is to clearly
distinguish infections that were initiated by a single strain
(homogenous infection) from those where multiple
strains entered the host. Furthermore, for those cases
where we are able to determine that the infection was
indeed homogenous, we seek to estimate the time since
the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) given a sample of genetic sequences. In contrast to coalescent and
Bayesian inference methods (e.g., BEAST [5]), which are
based on a simulation of genealogies, we do not simulate
the genealogical history of the observed sequences, but
rather follow the diversity structure of the entire viral

population. While in most settings a forward simulation
is not attainable (hence the use of coalescence), our
approach becomes not only feasible but extremely simple
to realize when modeling a homogeneous infection
within a small number of generations from the transmission bottleneck. The increased efficiency of the algorithm
(which runs within minutes instead of hours) facilitates
the analysis of samples from a large number of subjects
[3] and enables the application to massive new data sets
that are currently being gathered using pyrosequencing
[6]. We have successfully tested our tool in both cases,
i.e., hundreds of patients and tens of thousands of
sequences. These methods are robust against violations
of assumptions that do not strongly affect overall diversity. Quantities like the time since the MRCA, when
computed by our tool, yield virtually identical results
[3,7] to those computed by the coalescent or Bayesian
methods, as shown in Figure 1. The tool is available on
the LANL website [8]. An extensive explanation of how
the tool works and how to format the input data is

on the tool website [8].

Implementation
Our basic framework is that of an exponentially growing
population following a narrow bottleneck, with lineageindependent mutation rates at all sites and no differential selection among the attested forms. When the
resulting diversity is small, almost every change is at a
distinct locus, and the pairwise differences between
genetic strains, i.e., the Hamming distances (HD), follow
a Poisson distribution [9]. There is little evidence of
recombination in samples from this early stage when
care is taken to guard against in vitro recombination
[10]. Furthermore, when sites evolve independently
starting from a homogeneous infection, homologous
recombination does not change the HD distribution nor
the overall amount of diversity. It does, however, affect
the distribution when these assumptions are violated
(unpublished data). The Poisson Fitter tool [8] uses this

tool [5]. The data is highly correlated: r = 0.973 and the best fitting slope is 1.036.

fact to fit a Poisson distribution to the pairwise HD frequency distribution obtained from the input data.
Because a good fit is obtained when the infection is
homogeneous and free of differential selection pressure
[7], the tool can be used to detect large violations of
one or more assumptions of the null model.

removes the positions that fall within an APOBEC GRD
motif from the entire alignment. This leaves the number
of sequences unchanged and provides an unbiased correction. With either option, a new corrected alignment will be
created, and the tool will proceed to analyze both the
uncorrected and the corrected alignments.

Input data

Star phylogeny

The Poisson Fitter tool [8] was originally developed to
analyze genetic sequences from early HIV-1 infected
patients (Fiebig Stage I and II [3]). However, it can be
used on any set of highly conserved sequences to test
whether the observed diversity could be due to random
accumulation of mutations or whether one needs to
invoke alternate explanations like early onset of selection
or multiple original infecting strains. The tool accepts
multiple alignments, obtained through either single genome amplification [10] or deep sequencing [6], but they
must be uploaded as one file. All alignments need to be
in fasta format and always start with a consensus or
reference sequence, which is assumed to be the ancestral
strain. More details on how to format the input data is
provided on the tool web page [8].

When the samples are relatively small, under our
assumed model of neutral evolution and rapid exponential growth, all sequences are likely to coalesce to the
same founder or MRCA [15]. When this happens, we
say that the sample follows a star phylogeny. This has
been shown in HIV-1 early homogenous infections
[3,16,17]. Under a star-phylogeny scenario, the pairwise
HD distribution coincides with the self-convolution of
the HD0 frequency distribution, where HD0 is the Hamming distance from the consensus sequence. When the
sequences coalesce at the founder we can use the following mathematical formulation to compute the HD
frequencies [7]:
Yj =

Controlling for APOBEC enrichment

APOBEC is a host enzyme. During replication it causes
mutations that can introduce stop codons and inactivate
the virus. These substitutions are recognizable by a G ® A
mutational pattern embedded in the APOBEC3G/F motif
[11,12], which is: GRD, where R is the IUPAC symbol for
G or A, and D for G, A or T. Their occurrence is sporadic,
often leading to overtly hypermutated sequences [11,12],
and thus violating our assumption of a constant mutation
rate (see Results and Discussion for an example). Our tool
allows for two types of checks: the first method searches
for hypermutated sequences, i.e., particular sequences that
present a statistically significant excess of G ® A mutations at APOBEC3G/F motifs compared to elsewhere in
the sample. The test is performed using the Hypermut
tool [13] and the user can select a P-value threshold
(default P < 0.1). With the second method, an artificial
sequence is created, which summarizes all mutations
found across the sample, and is then tested for APOBEC
enrichment via the Hypermut tool [13]. When the latter is
significantly enriched, it indicates enrichment across the
sample for mutations embedded in the APOBEC motif, in
which case we call the sample overall enriched [14]. The
user can choose whether and how to correct for APOBEC
enrichment. Two correction methods are provided, which
correspond to the two tests discussed above. The first
option is to simply remove all sequences that yield a
P-value below the threshold. Because this method reduces
the number of sequences, we have devised a second option
which looks at all G’s in the consensus sequence and

where δx, y is the Kroenecker delta, and Xi is the number of sequences that are i bases from the consensus,
and Yj are the number of pairs of sequences that are different at j bases. By comparing these theoretical frequencies Y j to the observed ones (i.e., the number of
pairs that are j bases from one another), one can verify
whether the star-phylogeny assumption is valid for the
tested alignment.
Fitting the Poisson distribution

A Poisson distribution is fitted to the observed pairwise
HD distribution using a maximum likelihood method
(see [7] for details). A c2 goodness of fit (GOF) is performed to test whether the HD distribution significantly
diverges from a Poisson (small P-values indicate a bad
fit). The test takes into account the non-independence
of pairwise HD distances by comparing the observed
frequencies to the expected ones if the sample were to
follow a star phylogeny. Prior to the onset of positive
selection, the population is assumed to undergo a rapid
expansion during which the basic reproductive number
R 0 > 1. Therefore, when the sample yields a GOF
P-value above 0.05 (indicating a non-significant divergence from a Poisson distribution), we can estimate the
time since the MRCA using the parameters characterizing intrahost HIV evolution. Following Stafford et al.
[18], we set R0 = 6 for acute HIV-1 infection samples.
We assume a constant mutation rate across lineages,

Giorgi et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:532
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/532

which we fix at an average value of  = 2.16 × 10-5 per
site and per replication cycle. This value has been
adjusted from what was originally derived for HIV-1 by
Mansky et al. [19] by considering only base substitutions
and ignoring insertions and deletions. However, it has
not been corrected for possible extra purifying selection
in vivo. Using these parameters, we use the mean of the
fitted Poisson distribution to infer the time since the
MRCA [7].

Results and Discussion
All the parameters explained in the previous section are
computed and included in the output table called “Log
Likelihood - Estimated Parameters.” This comprises, for
each sample: the number of sequences in the sample,
the mean and maximum pairwise HD, the mean of the
best fitting Poisson distribution, the corresponding time
since the MRCA, and the goodness of fit P-value It is
important to notice that when the sample meets our
model’s assumptions, the mean of the best fitting Poisson distribution is in fact the mean pairwise HD of the
sample. A second table, called “Convolution Estimates,”
provides the observed HD frequencies and the estimated
ones calculated using equation (1). A more detailed
explanation of the parameters is provided in the Explanation file on the tool web page.
Figure 2 shows the graphics obtained by analyzing a
fragment of the NEF HIV-1 gene (169 base pairs) from
patient CH40 [3,16]. The data have been published [16]
and submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra under accession
number SRA020793. This sample was obtained through
deep sequencing [6,20] and yielded a little over 4,000
sequences, though our tool can easily handle ten times

Page 4 of 7

as many sequences: because it works only with counts
of pairwise distances, it can handle samples of almost
any reasonable size, though very large jobs will slow the
server. The left panel in Figure 2 shows the pairwise HD
frequency counts (black), the best fitting Poisson distribution (blue), and the expected counts if it were a starphylogeny (red) on a logarithmic scale. The fact that the
red line and the black line are indistinguishable confirms
that the sample follows a star-like phylogeny. Because
the Poisson fit is very sensitive to deviations in the
upper tail of the distribution, the tool outputs graphics
in the logarithmic scale whenever the sample size is
above 100; this helps visualize possible deviations at the
higher distances. Though the values are discrete, lines
are used for better visualization. In the right panel a histogram of the frequency counts is shown together with,
in red, the best fitting Poisson distribution. In this case
the sample yielded a good fit (P = 0.981) and a time to
MRCA of 34 days 95% CI = (31, 38).
As a second example, Figure 3 shows a sample
drawn from single genome amplification sequencing
[3,10]. All fifty sequences used for this example are
available through Accession Numbers EU575084-133.
In this case the original alignment does not yield a
good fit to the Poisson distribution (top left panel, red
line), but the tool detected APOBEC3G/F mediated
hypermutation. By selecting the option to correct
for APOBEC signatures by both methods, two more
alignments are produced: one where two significantly
(P < 0.1) hypermutated sequences are removed, and
one where instead the alignment position where APOBEC induced mutation could potentially affect results
are removed. It is noteworthy that the first type of correction still does not yield a good Poisson fit (GOF

phylogeny. The right panel shows the pairwise HD histogram and the best fitting Poisson distribution (red). In the legend we report the GOF
P-value (P = 0.981), the estimated days since the infections (d = 34(31, 38)), and the number of sequences in the sample (N = 4046).

best fitting Poisson (red line), on the left (panels A and C), and with theoretical star-phylogeny frequencies (red line), on the right (panels B and D).
The top panels represent an alignment not corrected for enrichment for APOBEC motifs, whereas the bottom panels represent the same alignment
after the G positions that in the consensus are in the APOBEC context have been removed from the alignment. Prior to the correction, the Poisson
does not fit the HD frequency distribution (GOF P < 0.0001), whereas after the correction the Poisson yields a good fit (GOF P = 0.865).

P < 0.0001). This is because the sample is overall
enriched for G ® A. One can check this by looking at
the Hypermut Results Table and noticing that the
sequence called compressedMutations yields a P = 6 ×
10-6 for APOBEC enrichment. Therefore, only when all
positions with a G embedded in a APOBEC3G/F motif
are removed, does one finally achieves a good Poisson
fit (P = 0.865) and a biologically sensible (given the
clinical data available for this subject) time estimate of
the time since the MRCA of 12 days, 95% CI = (8, 16).
This example illustrates how APOBEC enrichment can
cause the Poisson fit to fail and hence how it is necessary to isolate the APOBEC induced mutations in
order to make sensible estimates on the timing of the
infection.

Unlike the example in Figure 2, where a logarithmic scale
is used for better visualization, when the sample size is
under 100, the star-phylogeny is represented in the manner
shown in the panels on the right: the observed pairwise HD
frequency counts are shown by the blue histograms,
whereas the ones computed theoretically are shown in red.
For both APOBEC-corrected and non-corrected samples,
the red lines follow the histograms faithfully, which deems
both samples as star-like phylogenies.
Both of the examples above obviously meet our model’s assumptions of exponential growth with no selection
and negligible recombination rate. When one or more
assumption is not met the goodness of fit P-value lowers
considerably and therefore the time since the MRCA is
inaccurate. There are several factors that can cause this

Giorgi et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:532
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/532

to happen: for instance, the infection may be nonhomogeneous, the sample may not be “early” enough, or
one may have sampled an unlikely early random mutation that distorts the Poisson distribution. When analyzing HIV-1 data, we recommend using samples taken
within the first 2-5 weeks of infection, or characterized
as Fiebig stage I or II [3]. At later Fiebig stages selection
and recombination are clearly observed, and the diversity is controlled by these later selective bottlenecks.
The probability of an early stochastic mutation violating
the model assumption is calculated in [14], and is typically small.
Finally, we notice that our tool can be applied to subsets of sequences sampled at later time points when
there is evidence of a narrow bottleneck. For example,
in Fischer et al. [16] we were able to isolate the escape
lineages after the immune response had begun and
applied the tool to estimate the timing of each lineage.
The tool has been used primarily on large HIV-1 data
sets [3,16], though it can be used on any population
that grows in a similar fashion, as appears to be the case
of HCV for instance [21].

Conclusions
Our tool enables quantitative characterization of acute
infection samples and can be usefully applied in large
scale vaccine and prophylaxis studies where estimates of
the time since the MRCA and/or the timing of the
onset of host selection can be extremely informative.
The tool can rapidly detect whether the mutational distribution in a set of HIV sequences is consistent with a
star phylogeny and/or a Poisson model, indicative of a
population evolving from a single ancestor, with lineage
independent mutations under no differential selection of
surviving forms. If the model is violated, the tool automatically evaluates whether this is a consequence of
APOBEC mediated substitutions. When the model is
satisfied, it can be be used to estimate times to the most
recent common ancestor of the lineage, rapidly providing timing estimates that are in good accord with coalescent methods. The speed and simplicity of the
algorithm enables it to be applied to massive data sets
obtained through ultra-deep sequencing methods [6,20].
We have used it on tens of thousands of sequences [16]
to estimate the time since the MRCA and also, at later
time points, to estimate the timing of escape lineages,
which arose after the onset of selection. The tool can be
used on any other population which presents similar
evolutionary patterns [21].
