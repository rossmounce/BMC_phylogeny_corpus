Abstract
Background: The remarkable mutualistic associations between termites and protists are in large
part responsible for the evolutionary success of these eusocial insects. It is unknown when this
symbiosis was first established, but the present study shows that fossil termite protists existed in
the Mesozoic.
Results: A new species of termite (Kalotermes burmensis n. sp.) in Early Cretaceous Burmese
amber had part of its abdomen damaged, thus exposing trophic stages and cysts of diverse protists.
Some protists were still attached to the gut intima while others were in the amber matrix adjacent
to the damaged portion. Ten new fossil flagellate species in the Trichomonada, Hypermastigida and
Oxymonadea are described in nine new genera assigned to 6 extant families. Systematic placement
and names of the fossil flagellates are based on morphological similarities with extant genera
associated with lower termites. The following new flagellate taxa are established: Foainites icelus n.
gen. n. sp., Spiromastigites acanthodes n. gen. n. sp., Trichonymphites henis n. gen., n. sp., Teranymphites
rhabdotis n. gen. n. sp., Oxymonas protus n. sp., Oxymonites gerus n. gen., n. sp., Microrhopalodites
polynucleatis n. gen., n. sp., Sauromonites katatonis n. gen., n. sp., Dinenymphites spiris n. gen., n. sp.,
Pyrsonymphites cordylinis n. gen., n. sp. A new genus of fossil amoeba is also described as
Endamoebites proterus n. gen., n. sp. Fourteen additional trophic and encystid protist stages are
figured and briefly characterized.
Conclusion: This represents the earliest fossil record of mutualism between microorganisms and
animals and the first descriptions of protists from a fossil termite. Discovering the same orders,
families and possibly genera of protists that occur today in Early Cretaceous kalotermitids shows
considerable behaviour and morphological stability of both host and protists. The possible
significance of protist cysts associated with the fossil termite is discussed in regards the possibility
that coprophagy, as well as proctodeal trophallaxis, was a method by which some termite protozoa
were transferred intrastadially and intergenerationally at this time.

Background
Termites are one of the most successful eusocial insect
groups today and certainly the most notorious as a result
of their damage to human dwellings. Their success can
be attributed in large part to microbial (especially
protozoa and bacterial) symbionts harbored in their
alimentary tract. Especially important are gut protists,
which are essential for the survival of termites feeding on
lignocelluloses. While termites do produce endogenous
cellulases from salivary glands and gut cells, cellulolytic
protists are crucial for the complete digestion of cellulose
in wood-feeding termites [1-3]. In the lower termites,
these symbionts are mostly flagellates belonging to the
Oxymonadida, Trichomonada and Hypermastigida
[4-7]. Flagellates associated with an Early Cretaceous
lower termite of the family Kalotermitidae are described
and compared with mutualistic flagellates of extant
kalotermitids. This discovery shows that, while the
protist species represent different genera and species,
mutualistic associations between protists and termites
had already been established some 100 million years
ago. The present study represents the earliest fossil record
of mutualism between microorganisms and animals [8].

Results
Description of host termite
Damage to the termite included the loss of the left hind
wing, the tip of the abdomen (including the cerci), the
right side of the metathorax and the right side of the first
three abdominal segments. All wings were flexed at their
bases. However, it was possible to determine the
venation in the distal three quarters of the right forewing
and the complete right hind wing.

Based on the morphological characters of the termite (Sc
absent from the hind wing, R simple in both wings, no
reticulation between the veins posterior to R, R separate
from the costal margin, presence of a number of regularly
spaced oblique forward branches between the Rs and C),
the fossil is placed in the family Kalotermitidae [9, 10].
Its small size, low number of antennal segments,
strongly sclerotized radial sector, unsclerotized M and
Cu veins, complete M vein positioned halfway between
Rs and Cu, wing membrane densely covered with
minute, pigmented nodules, tibial spurs lacking on the
shaft of the mid-tibia and the presence of ocelli and
arolia, align the fossil with the genus Kalotermes Hagen
1853 [9, 10]. Since the fossil differs from previously
described termites in Burmese amber [10-13], it is
described below as a new species. It should be noted
that the placement of the fossil in the extant genus
Kalotermes is tentative since some diagnostic characters
(number of apical spines on the tibiae, front wing
venation, etc.) were obscured.

Comments: The present species differs from Kalotermes
swinhoei [11] and K. tristis [12], previously described from
Burmese amber. While Emerson [14] and Krishna [9] felt
that K. swinhoei and K. tristis could be synonymous,
Williams [10] considered both as valid species and
presented diagnostic characters to separate them. The
absence of arolia, simple M vein, wing membrane lacking
nodules and number of antennal segments separates K.
tristis from the present species. From K. swinhoei, K.
burmensis differs in its slightly smaller size (3.3 mm vs
3.8 mm), greater eye diameter (250 μm vs 113 μm), larger
head length (607 μm vs 530 μm), shorter pronotal width
(672 μm vs 760 μm), shorter terminal maxillary palp
(135 μm vs 190 μm), shorter terminal labial palp

The wing venation, head shape, presence and size of
arolia, presence of ocelli, absence of spines on the shaft
of the mid-tibia, number of tarsal and antennal segments
and presence of pigmented wing nodes separates K.
burmensis from the four Burmese amber specimens
described by Engel et al, [13], as well as all of the
Tertiary species of kalotermitids [14].
Description of protists
A variety of protists were associated with K. burmensis.
Some were still attached to the gut lining, while others
were free in the amber matrix adjacent to the exposed
gut. Those that revealed morphological characters similar
to protist families and genera found in extant lower
termites are described below. Since the amber matrix
normally contains a variety of small, oval-spherical
bodies, care was taken to select for descriptions only
protozoa attached to the gut intima or with features
aligning them with extant groups associated with lower
termites. None of the forms presented below are
considered to be insect parasites or pathogens [15].
Stages that could not be identified due to insufficient
characters are documented with photographs and briefly
characterized.

Except for one species described in the extant genus
Oxymonas, all of the protists are placed in fossil genera,
with names based on extant genera with similar
morphological characters. However, it is acknowledged
that since not all diagnostic characters could be
determined in the fossil protists and features that were
present could align the fossil with more than one extant
protist lineage, the similarities so indicated between the
fossils and extant genera are only tentative.

Comment: These two fossils are difficult to classify. Their
spiraled flagellar rows and absence of an axostyle and
rostrum show similarities to members of the extant
genus Spiromastigotes Duboscq & Grassé, 1943, but the
nucleus is anterior in the latter genus. It is not known
whether the pair are conjugating or in the final stage of
binary fission. The type species of Spiromastigotes is 10–
20 μm in length and occurs in the hodotermitid,
Anacanthotermes ochraceus (Brugerolle & Lee, 2000b).

Locality: Amber mine in the Hukawng Valley, southwest
of Maingkhwan in the state of Kachin (26°20'N, 96°

Description. Medium sized oval cell, with short rostrum
attached to intestinal cells of host; rostral flagella short;
post-rostral area with parallel flagellar rings without
connections and giving the cell a segmented appearance;
nucleus located under rostral area; putative axostyles
(possibly 2) narrow, fiber-like.

Etymology: From the Greek "henos" for old.
Type species: T. rhabdotis n. sp.
Comment: This genus is placed in the family Trichonymphidae based on its relatively short rostral flagella,
absence of an axostyle, and ribbon-like parabasals
associated with the nucleus. One of three cysts of this
or a related species in the same family is shown in
Fig. 19. Members of the genus Trichonympha occur in at
least 16 termite genera worldwide, including Kalotermes
[9, 17, 18]. Because of its wide distribution in the termite
families Hodotermitidae, Rhinotermitidae and Kalotermitidae, Kirby [17] suspected that species of Trichonympha were already present in the various termite lineages

Teranymphites. rhabdotis Poinar, n. sp.
Description: Body length, 84 μm; body width, 46 μm;
rostrum with rows of short flagella; post-rostral area with
at least 30 parallel rows of flagella separated by
ectoplasmic bands; parabasal body short.
Holotype: Specimen B-I-2 deposited in the Poinar amber
collection maintained at Oregon State University.
Locality: Amber mine in the Hukawng Valley, southwest
of Maingkhwan in the state of Kachin (26°20'N, 96°
36'E) in Myanmar (Burma).
Etymology: From the Greek "rhabdotos" for lined.
Comment: Flagella inserted on parallel rows separated
by ectoplasmic bands is a condition found in members
of the extant genus Teranympha Koidzumi 1917. The long
rostral flagella that also characterize this genus may be
hidden since the anterior end of the fossil is attached to
the gut intima. Long, narrow, fibril axostyles occur in the
related extant genus Spirotrichosoma Sutherland 1933 and
both genera have an anterior nucleus. Extant species of
Teranympha and Spirotrichosoma range from 90–270 μm
and 55–395 μm in length, respectively, and occur in
members of the families Rhinotermitidae and Termopsidae, respectively [5].

fibers attached at base of rostellum; single axostyle
extends length of body; faint holdfast at tip of rostellum.
Holotype: Specimen B-I-2 deposited in the Poinar amber
collection maintained at Oregon State University.
Locality: Amber mine in the Hukawng Valley, southwest
of Maingkhwan in the state of Kachin (26°20'N, 96°
36'E) in Myanmar (Burma).
Etymology: From the Greek" protos" for first regarding
its fossil status.
Comment: The presence of an anterior rostellum with
associated fibers and the uninucleate condition are
diagnostic characters of the genus Oxymonas. However
members of Oxymonas usually have 4 flagella arising
from the shoulder area, which are not evident in the
fossil [4, 19]. Species of Oxymonas occur in at least 10
genera of kalotermitids and range from 5–165 μm in
length [5, 9]. The holdfast is used to attach the cell to the
chitinous lining of the termite gut and the size of the
rostellum has been used to estimate the density of
populations in termite guts, with a lengthy rostellum
indicating a crowded condition [19].

anteriorly placed nucleus, during certain phases, the
nucleus may be located in the posterior portion of the
body [19]. The shape and size of the rostellum vary
greatly in extant oxymonadids [19]. The family is widely
distributed in kalotermitids, with some 27 species
described worldwide [9]. Possible cysts of this fossil
and/or Oxymonas protus are shown in Figs. 19 and 20.
Each cyst contains a nucleus and the one in Fig. 19 shows
an axostyle in the lower portion of the body, which is
characteristic of some oxymonadid cysts [20].

Oxymonites gerus Poinar n. sp.
Description. Length, 41 μm; width, 51 μm; rostellum
short, 8 μm in length; rostellum without associated
fibrous structures; nucleus spherical, 11 μm in diameter.

collection maintained at Oregon State University.
Locality: Amber mine in the Hukawng Valley, southwest
of Maingkhwan in the state of Kachin (26°20'N, 96°
36'E) in Myanmar (Burma).
Etymology: From the Greek "geros" for old age.
Comments: The presence of an anterior rostellum with
fibers arising from the base of the attachment point and
the single nucleus is why this fossil was placed in the
Oxymonadidae. While oxymonidids typically have an

associated with the rostral area are not characteristic of
eugregarine sporonts, certainly not those from extant
termites [21, 22].

shape as extant species of Sauromonas in kalotermitids [4].
Family Pyrsonymphidae Grassi, 1892

Etymology: From the Greek "poly" indicating many nuclei.
Dinenymphites Poinar n. gen. (Figs. 15A,B)
Comment: The corona of several karyomastigotes with
small nuclei, the large size and the modified rostral area
align the fossil with the extant genus Microrhopalodina
Grassi & Foa. This genus contains four extant species
ranging in size from 20 μm -165 μm and all occur in
kalotermitid termites [4]. It is difficult to say if the
rounded rostral region is characteristic of the mature
trophozoite or if the cell was entering a resting stage.
Superficially, this fossil has the appearance of an
eugregarine sporont, with the rostral area corresponding
to the protomerite and the basal portion the deutomerite. However, there is no scar on the top of the
hemispherical rostral area that would indicate the
attachment of an epimerite, no evidence of a septum
separating the two parts and no evidence of a large

Description. Small rod-shaped, spindle cell with at least
4 spirally twisted flagellar cords adhering to body; small
holdfast; axostyle slender; nucleus in anterior portion of
body.
Type species: Dinenymphites spiris n. sp.
Dinenymphites spiris Poinar, n. sp.
Description. Body slender, 41 μm in length, 9 μm in
width; axostyle extending length of cell.
Holotype: Specimen B-I-2 deposited in the Poinar amber
collection maintained at Oregon State University.

spherical, with broad pseudopodia and short protuberances.
Type species: Endamoebites proterus n. sp.

Etymology: From the Greek "speira" for twisted in
reference to the body structure.
Comments: The fossil resembles extant species of the
genus Dinenympha Leidy, which range from 24 μm to 64
μm in length. Members of this genus are now considered
motile forms of Pyrsonympha Leidy [4].
Pyrsonymphites Poinar, n. gen. (Figs. 16A,B)

Endamoebites proterus Poinar n. sp.
Description. Greatest diameter, 33 μm; nucleus undergoing division; diameter of upper nucleus, 8 μm;
endoplasm containing particles of various sizes.
Holotype: Specimen B-I-2 deposited in the Poinar amber
collection maintained at Oregon State University.

Description. Large club-shaped, slightly spirally twisted
flagellate with two nuclei positioned slightly below midbody; with several flagella (some adhering to cell body)
arising from anterior end of cell; anterior tip with
thickened tubular area; axostyle not detected.

Locality: Amber mine in the Hukawng Valley, southwest
of Maingkhwan in the state of Kachin (26°20'N, 96°
36'E) in Myanmar (Burma).

Type species: P. cordylinis n. sp.

Comments: The size and shape of the body and nucleus
resemble those of extant species of Endamoeba Leidy
from termites and roaches [23] which are the only
known hosts [16]. The nucleus appears to be dividing
and some putative chromatin threads connect the two
adjacent nuclear zones. A possible cyst of Endamoebites
(Fig. 21) is 53 μm in diameter, possesses a thick
membrane, contains 13 nuclei in the focal plane
shown and resembles cysts of extant Endamoeba [16].

Pyrsonymphites cordylinis Poinar, n. sp.
Description. Length, 152 μm; width, 48 μm; length longest
flagellum, 98 μm; length cephalic tube, 24 μm; tubular area
(holdfast?) inserted in host's intestinal intima.
Holotype: Specimen B-I-2 deposited in the Poinar amber
collection maintained at Oregon State University.

Etymology: From the Greek "proteros" for earlier.

Locality: Amber mine in the Hukawng Valley, southwest
of Maingkhwan in the state of Kachin (26°20'N, 96°
36'E) in Myanmar (Burma).
Etymology: From the Greek " kordylinas" for clubshaped in reference to the shape of the fossil.
Comment: This fossil resembles the extant Pyrsonympha
Leidy regarding the position of the flagella and posterior
nucleus. The two cells in the lower body appear to be nuclei.
Attached pyriform cells of Pyrsonympha range between 150
μm and 200 μm, which is within the size of the fossil.
Dinenymphites spiris could be the unattached stage of this or
another species of Pyrsonympha. Members of Pyrsonympha
occur today in members of the Rhinotermitidae [4].

Additional protists
Additional unknown protist stages associated with K.
burmensis are illustrated in Figs. 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24,
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32. Encysted forms are
shown in Figs. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23. The large (97
μm in diameter), bi-nucleated, walled cyst in Fig. 19
greatly resembles the binucleated cysts of Trichonympha
described from Cryptocercus cockroaches by Cleveland et
al. [[6], pg. 205, Fig. 13b]. Since these cysts were found
in the amber matrix adjoining the termite, it is likely that
they were already formed when the termite was
entombed, especially since Cleveland et al. [6] showed
that they required a period of 4 days to form in
Cryptocercus. It is highly unlikely that any of the cysts
were formed after the termite entered the resin, since
terpinols and other chemicals would have killed the precystic, trophic stages instantly.

Unknown stages, some of which could be ciliates, are
shown in Figs. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29, a flagellate in

Ciliates have been reported from extant termites [24] but
have not been well documented.
A pair of dauer juvenile rhabditid nematodes were also
associated with K. burmensis. These will be described in a
separate study.

Discussion
The present study represents the first descriptions of
protists from a fossil termite and the earliest fossil record
of mutualism involving microorganisms and animals [8].
The occurrence of an Early Cretaceous kalotermitid
termite with a variety of flagellates that includes members
of the same orders, families and possibly genera that
occur today in kalotermitids shows considerable behavior
and morphological stability of both host and protists.
Successful establishment of protozoa in xylophagous
insects necessated particular attributes. The protozoa had

to withstand the chemical and physical conditions inside
the insect's alimentary tract, utilize the gut contents as a
food source, cause no damage to the host, and to be
carried through successive insect stages and generations.
These protists apparently underwent a long period of coevolution with their hosts, since some lineages found
today in the intestines of xylophagous cockroaches and
lower termites are thought to have been established in
Carboniferous Blattida [25].

Figure 25

Today, the composition of intestinal protozoa tends to
be correlated with the phylogenetic position of their
termite hosts and it is possible to classify families, genera
and even species of termites based on their flagellates
[7]. This also applies to K. burmensis, since it contains
representatives of the three most abundant and widespread groups of protozoa in kalotermitids today
(Trichomonada, Hypermastigida and Oxymonadea). If
the systematic assignments are correct, some of the
protists in K. burmensis appear to be restricted to other
families of lower termites today. However in the Early
Cretaceous, partitioning of host habitats was probably
less fixed and the choice of host by a protozoan was

predicated largely on availability and chance encounter.
Some of the protozoa described here may have been
thwarted by a change in the habits of the host and since
they could not adapt, disappeared from the colonies.
Since angiosperms were becoming more diverse by the
mid-Cretaceous, some protists in K. burmensis may have
succumbed when the host diet shifted from gymnosperm
to angiosperm wood. While it is assumed that most of

extruded. Bar = 6 μm.

the protozoa described here had a mutualistic relationship with K. burmensis, as members of the Trichomonada, Hypermastigida and Oxymonadida do with extant
lower termites, some, as for instance Endamoebites
proterus, may have been simply commensals and
provided no benefit to K. burmensis.
One striking difference in the behavior of the protist
symbionts in extant termites and K. burmensis is the
presence of encysted stages in the latter. In extant
termites, mature protist cysts are rarely formed [26, 27]

and never in alates since the flagellates are transferred to
nest mates and hatchlings by proctodeal trophallaxis
(intrastadial and intergenerational transfer). However it
has been hypothesized that the distant ancestor of
termites passed flagellate cysts to nest mates and
hatchlings by coprophagy [6, 7, 27-30].
Several possible scenarios could explain the presence of
cysts in K. burmensis:
A), the colony was subsocial and ingesting cysts in fecal
pellets (coprophagy) was the main method for the
intrastadial and intergenerational transfer of protists; B),
the colony was subsocial or eusocial and both coprophagy (ingesting cysts in fecal pellets) and proctodeal
trophallaxis served to transfer the flagellates to nest

mates and hatchlings; C), the colony was eusocial and
protozoa were transferred by proctodeal trophallaxis.
The cysts were an ancestral carry-over and represent an
evolutionary dead-end; D), some of the cysts could have
been ingested while feeding and had no trophic
association with K. burmensis.

Materials and methods
Specimens
The amber with the fossil termite containing the protists is
roughly semi-circular in outline, measuring 13 mm along
the longest edge, 10 mm in width and 1 mm in thickness.
Observations, drawings and photographs were made with
a Nikon SMZ-10 R stereoscopic microscope and Nikon
Optiphot compound microscope. Since all photographs
were taken through the thickness of the amber matrix, it
was not possible to get as close as desired to individual
protists without polishing away adjacent ones as well as
portions of the termite host. Therefore all photos were
taken at 20×. With such a small image, it was only
possible to obtain a single clear photo of the specimen
since further fine adjustment produced blurry images.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and the
presence of araucaroid wood fibers in amber samples
from the Noije Bum 2001 Summit site indicate an
araucarian (possibly Agathis) tree source for the amber [32].

Adobe Photoshop was used to enlarge the photos and to
obtain several modified images by using different settings
of contrast, light intensity and resolution. The drawings
were made from a combination of the modified images
and that is why they contain more detail than the
corresponding photographs, which represent the best
single image obtained under the various settings. Thus
Photoshop manipulation was used to replace optical
sections, that were not possible to make with such small
objects and at such a low magnification.

The amber was obtained from a mine first excavated in
2001 in the Hukawng Valley, southwest of Maingkhwan
in the state of Kachin (26°20'N, 96°36'E) in Myanmar
(Burma). On the basis of paleontological evidence, this
new Noije Bum 2001 Summit Amber Site was assigned
to the Early Cretaceous, Upper Albian [31] placing the
age at 97 to 110 mya.
