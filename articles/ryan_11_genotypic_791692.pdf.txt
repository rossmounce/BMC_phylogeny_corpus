Genotypic and phenotypic diversity of Ralstonia
pickettii and Ralstonia insidiosa isolates from
clinical and environmental sources including
High-purity Water. Diversity in Ralstonia pickettii
Michael P Ryan1, J Tony Pembroke2 and Catherine C Adley1*

Abstract
Background: Ralstonia pickettii is a nosocomial infectious agent and a significant industrial contaminant. It has
been found in many different environments including clinical situations, soil and industrial High Purity Water. This
study compares the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of a selection of strains of Ralstonia collected from a
variety of sources.
Results: Ralstonia isolates (fifty-nine) from clinical, industrial and environmental origins were compared
genotypically using i) Species-specific-PCR, ii) PCR and sequencing of the 16S-23S rRNA Interspatial region (ISR) iii)
the fliC gene genes, iv) RAPD and BOX-PCR and v) phenotypically using biochemical testing. The species specificPCR identified fifteen out of fifty-nine designated R. pickettii isolates as actually being the closely related species R.
insidiosa. PCR-ribotyping of the 16S-23S rRNA ISR indicated few major differences between the isolates. Analysis of
all isolates demonstrated different banding patterns for both the RAPD and BOX primers however these were
found not to vary significantly.
Conclusions: R. pickettii species isolated from wide geographic and environmental sources appear to be
reasonably homogenous based on genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. R. insidiosa can at present only be
distinguished from R. pickettii using species specific PCR. R. pickettii and R. insidiosa isolates do not differ
significantly phenotypically or genotypically based on environmental or geographical origin.

Background
Ralstonia pickettii, previously called Pseudomonas pickettii
and Burkholderia pickettii [1], is ubiquitous in the environment. It has been recovered from a number of water
sources and from a wide range of clinical environments
[2-5]. R. pickettii has also become recognised in the last
decade as a nosocomial pathogen associated particularly
with individuals who are debilitated or immunosuppressed
[6-8]. These outbreaks have been reported mainly in association with contamination of hospital supplies [9-14] and
with contaminated chlorhexidine skin cleansing solutions

[15,16]. The emergence of new opportunistic pathogenic
microorganisms has been linked to a multiresistance phenotype that makes them refractory to the antibiotics commonly used in clinical practice [17]. The majority of
clinical isolates of R. pickettii are characterized by their
multiresistance to common antibiotics [17].
The emergence of R. pickettii in High-Purity Water
(HPW) systems used in the biopharmaceutical industry
necessitates revisiting this organism. R. pickettii has been
identified in biofilm formation in industrial plastic water
piping [18] and has been isolated from industrial highpurity water [2,19]; laboratory based high-purity water
systems [3]; in the Space Shuttle water system [20] and
from the Mars Odyssey probe encapsulation facility [21].
It has been shown to produce homoserine lactones [2],

the putative cell-cell signalling molecules in biofilm
development [22] and has the ability to survive in low
nutrient (oligotrophic) conditions [23]. In addition,
R. pickettii has been shown to have a wide range of biodegradative abilities that could potentially be used for
commercial applications and that may assist in survival
and adaption to low nutrient environments [8]. Integrating Conjugative Elements-like elements have been discovered in several isolates of this bacterium [24]
indicating a degree of plasticity in their genomes.
Molecular typing methods such as restriction fragment
length polymorphism by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) [14,25], random amplified polymorphic DNA
(RAPD) analysis by arbitrarily primed PCR [16] and ribotyping [26] have been developed for Ralstonia sp. and
have been used to detect relationships between clinical
isolates in epidemiological studies. Despite the acknowledged importance of R. pickettii as a nosocomial pathogen,
little is known regarding its epidemiology. Studies carried
out with limited numbers of bacterial isolates indicated
the bacterium appears to have limited diversity [25-27].
Evidence suggests that R. pickettii finds its way into clinical environments through contaminated water supplies
[5]. To test this and to determine the level of relatedness
between isolates of this bacteria from different environments a comprehensive study of the relatedness of fiftynine isolates of R. pickettii and R. insidiosa (including soil,
water and clinical isolates) using various phenotypic
(metabolic activity) and genotypic (flagellin and Interspatial regions typing, BOX-PCR, and RAPD) fingerprinting
methods was carried out.

Methods
Bacterial isolates and growth conditions

The fifty-nine isolates used in this study are presented in
Table 1. All the isolates were stored at -20°C in Nutrient
Broth (Difco) with 50% glycerol. Isolates were grown aerobically on Nutrient Agar (Difco) and incubated overnight
at 30°C.
Phenotypic analysis

Oxidase and catalase tests were performed with Oxidase
sticks (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and 3% hydrogen peroxide, respectively. A number of classical phenotypic tests
were performed that included BioMérieux API 20NE system (BioMérieux UK Limited, Hampshire, UK) and the
Remel RapID NF Plus commercial system (Remel, Kansas,
USA). A Vitek card; the Non-Fermenter Identification
Card (NFC) (BioMérieux), was also used. All of the above
tests were carried out as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Phenotypic relatedness among different isolates of R. pickettii was determined using the API 20NE profiles. Phenotypic characters were scored as discrete variables [0 or 1];
0, when the character was negative or missing; 1, when

Page 2 of 11

character was positive or present). Isolates with the same
pattern were grouped into Biotypes numbering 1 to 35.
The unweighted pair group method [28] was used for
cluster analysis using the MultiVariate Statistical Package
(MVSP) software program ver. 3.13 by means of the
Jaccard coefficient [29]. The discriminatory power of the
biotyping for typing R. pickettii isolates was evaluated by
using the discrimination index as described by Hunter and
Gaston, as given by the equation: D = 1 - [1/N (N - 1)]
∑nj (nj - 1), where D is the numerical index of discrimination, N is the total number of isolates, and nj is the number of isolates pertaining to the jth type [30].
Genotypic analysis

DNA for all PCR experiments was prepared as described
previously [31].
Species-specific PCR and amplification 16S-23S rRNA ISR
and fliC gene

The species-specific PCR primers (Rp-F1, Rp-R1 and
R38R1) used in this study were designed by Coenye et al.,
detailed in Table 2 [32,33]. The 16SF and 23SR primers
were used to amplify the Interspacial Region (ISR) [34]
and the Ral_fliC primers (Ral_fliCF and Ral_fliCR) were
used to amplify the fliC gene (Table 2), [35]. The PCR
assays were performed in 25 μL reaction mixtures, containing 100 ng of template genomic DNA, 1U Taq polymerase, 250 mM (each) deoxynucleotide triphosphate,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 10x PCR buffer (Bioline), and 20 pmol of
oligonucleotide primer (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg,
Germany) Rp-F1 and 10 pmol of oligonucleotide primers
Rp-R1 and R38R1 for the species-specific PCR and
20 pmol each of the primers for the ISR and fliC regions
(Table 2). After initial denaturation for 2 min at 94°C,
30 amplification cycles were completed, each consisting of
1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 1 min 30 secs at 72°C.
A final extension of 10 min at 72°C was then applied. The
PCR products were analysed by electrophoresis in a 1.5%
agarose gel (Agarose MP, Roche Diagnostics) for 1 hour
(100 V) with ethidium bromide staining in the TBE buffer
and photographed under the UV light (UV Products Gel
Documentation System Imagestore, Ultra Violet Products,
Cambridge). A 200-10000bp DNA ladder (Bioline) was
included on all gels to allow standardization and sizing.
Following amplification of the ISR and fliC region from
test isolates PCR product was purified using the NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the
amplicons sequenced (MWG Comfort Read service).
RAPD and BOX-PCR analysis

For RAPD-PCR each 25 μl PCR sample contained 2.5 μL
of 10× buffer, 2 mM of MgCl 2 , 40 pmol of primer,
200 mM of each of four dNTPs, 200 ng of template

genomic DNA and 1 U of Taq polymerase. The PCR reactions were carried out as follows: an initial denaturation at
94°C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°
C for 1 min, annealing at 36°C for 1 min and extension at
72°C for 1 min 30 secs. Four different primers were used:
M13, P3, P15 and OPA03U are listed in Table 2 [36-38].
BOX-PCR typing was carried out with the BOX-A1R
primer (Table 2) [39]. 200 ng of template genomic was
mixed with 2 U of Taq polymerase, 200 mM of each of
four dNTPs, 2.5 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.8 μl
of bovine serum albumin (10 mg ml-1) (Promega), 5 μl of
5× Gitschier buffer and 10 pmol of primer in a final
volume of 25 μl. After initial denaturation for 2 min at 95°
C, 35 amplification cycles were completed, each consisting
of 40 secs at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C, and 8 mins at 65°C. A
final extension of 8 mins at 65°C was applied.
Amplified products for both procedures were analysed
by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium

bromide at 60 V for 4 hrs and were visualised by UV transillumination. The repeatability of the RAPD and BOXPCR protocols were tested by studying the isolates in
three independent runs.
DNA analysis

The ISR and fliC gene sequences obtained were compared
with sequences in the GenBank database using the Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [40] and aligned
using the ClustalW program [41]. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using genetic
distance based neighbour joining algorithms [42] within
MEGA version 3.1 http://www.megasoftware.net, [43].
The analysis of the RAPD and BOX gels was performed
using BioNumerics software (version 5.1 Applied Maths,
Kortrijk, Belgium), based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, and clustering by the unweighted pair group
method with arithmetic means (UPGMA method) [44].

The isolates that clustered at a cut-off level of more than
80% similarity were grouped together; these were considered clonally related and classified into the same group.
The discriminatory power of the BOX and RAPD-PCR for
typing R. pickettii isolates was evaluated by using the discrimination index as described by Hunter and Gaston [30].
Accession numbers

DNA sequences were deposited in the EMBL database
with accession numbers for sequences from the 16S-23S
spacer region are as follows: AM501933-AM501952 and
for the FliC genes: FN869041-FN869057.

Results
Species-specific PCR

To confirm that the isolates were in fact R. pickettii a species-specific PCR reaction was carried out using the primers described (Table 2). The results of the experimental
analysis of fifty-nine isolates from our study, which include
industrial, clinical, laboratory purified water and seven
purchased strains are presented in Table 3. Eleven of the
industrial high purity water isolates (ULI821, ULI797,
ULI785, ULI181, ULI794, ULI185, ULI166, ULI819,
ULI784, ULI163, ULI795), two laboratory Millipore water
isolates (ULM008, ULM009) and one purchased strain
(ATCC42129) were identified as R. insidiosa through use
of the species-specific primers (Table 2). The multiplex
PCR gave a 403 bp band and a 210 bp band for R. insidiosa and only the 210 bp band for R. pickettii (data not
shown).
Phenotypic characterisation and identification

All isolates were Gram-negative non-fermentative rods
and both oxidase and catalase positive. Fifty-nine isolates
(eight from culture collections, seven clinical, eleven
laboratory purified water and thirty-two industrial isolates
and the R. insidiosa type strain LMG21421) were identified initially as R. pickettii (Table 3). These results were
confirmed using the Vitek NFC with all isolates being
identified as R. pickettii. The Vitek NFC identification rate
ranged from 97.0 to 99.0 with two patterns being detected
(Table 3). The API 20NE identification rate ranged from
0.00 to 99.4%, with thirty-five different patterns being
detected. Most of the purchased culture collection isolates
were identified as R. pickettii (except the soil isolates
CCUG18841 and CCM2846) with cut-off points higher
then 60%, six of the clinical isolates were identified as
R. pickettii with cut-off points higher then 50%, while one
was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Table 3). All
11 laboratory purified water isolates were identified as
R. pickettii with cut-off points higher then 80%, and seventeen of the thirty-two industrial isolates were identified as
R. pickettii species with cut-off points higher then 50%, the
rest of the industrial isolates were all identified as non-

Page 4 of 11

R. pickettii species. The RapID NF Plus identification rate
ranged from 0.00 to 99.9%, with five different patterns
being detected. Fifty-seven isolates were identified as R.
pickettii, with results of over 98%. The other two were
identified as Moraxella sp (Table 3).
The R. insidiosa Type strain LMG21421 was identified
as R. pickettii 61.70% (’Low Discrimination’ 0050577)
with the API 20NE, as R. pickettii 99.94% (’Implicit’
400414) with the RapID NF Plus and as R. pickettii 99%
on the Vitek Junior system with the NFC (Table 3).
A cluster analysis was carried out using the API 20
NE results and can be seen in Figure 1. The results indicated that the isolates studied are phenotypically very
different (The list of tests in the API 20NE can be seen
in Additional File 1 Table S1). The 35 biotypes identified are very different with similarity between some of
the biotypes being as low as 0.2. The 35 biotypes did
not break down based on environment of isolation.
These results contradict the results of both the Remel
RapID NF Plus and the Vitek NFC, which indicated that
R. pickettii was a phenotypically homogenous species
with the same phenotypic pattern being found in most
isolates. All results are presented in Table 3 and Additional File 1, Table S1. A Simpson’s diversity of 0.9813
was calculated for this study using the API 20NE results
[30].
Genotypic characterisation

Four different DNA-based typing methods (ISR and fliC
gene sequencing, RAPD-PCR and BOX-PCR) were used
to compare the isolates at a molecular level. With the
analysis of the 16S-23S rDNA ISR a PCR product of
approximately 860 bp was obtained for all isolates indicating that the spacer region is highly similar in length in
all isolates (data not shown). Sequencing of the ISR of 19
isolates identified phenotypically as R. pickettii, and the
type strain of R. insidiosa was carried out. The sequence
of several isolates indicated that these were more closely
related to R. insidiosa than to R. pickettii sharing greater
homology with the R. insidiosa type strain confirming the
results obtained from the species-specific PCR reaction
(Figure 2a). The ISR comprised a length of 513bp for
R. pickettii and 515bp for R. insidiosa. The sequence
similarity of the R. pickettii isolates compared to the
R. pickettii type strain LMG5942 ranged from 98-100%
(Figure 2a) and for all R. insidiosa isolates it was 95%
(Figure 2a). All ISR sequences had a GC content of
~52.5%. The Ralstonia ISR spacer region contains two
tRNA genes: tRNAIle and tRNAAla comprising 77 and 78
bp respectively. This is a common feature of the ISR in
rrn operons in Gram-negative bacteria [45] including
R. pickettii [46]. The order observed for sequences generated from our Ralstonia isolates was 16S rRNA tRNAIle - tRNAAla -23S rRNA. The nucleotide sequences

of tRNAIle were identical in all isolates and the tRNAAla
gene differed by one nucleotide between R. pickettii and
R. insidiosa in the isolates studied. The phylogenetic tree
analysis in Figure 2a, supports the positioning of R. pickettii and R. insidiosa as two separate groups (bootstrap
values of 91%), with B. cepacia as an out-group. The isolates identified as R. pickettii themselves divide into two
different groups (bootstrap value of 99%). However the
division into groups did not correlate to clinical or

environmental association or indeed on their isolation
location.
Sequencing was carried out on the fliC gene of sixteen
randomly selected isolates of R. pickettii, and the type
strain of R. insidiosa. The phylogenetic analysis of the
fliC gene can be seen in Figure 2b, with the isolates
divided into two branches with B. cepacia as an outgroup. The isolates identified as R. insidiosa in-group two
grouped together with groups three and four. These

however were not supported by high bootstrapping
values. Group 1 is made up of R. pickettii isolates from
clinical and environmental sources with 97-100% similarity to the R. pickettii type strain. Group 2 is made up of
R. insidiosa with 85% similarity to the R. pickettii type
strain; Group 3 is made up of both R. insidiosa and
R. pickettii with 86-87% similarity to the R. pickettii type
strain and Group 4 is made up of the available sequenced
R. pickettii strains with 87% similarity to the R. pickettii
type strain. The division of the groups did not correlate
to clinical or environmental association or on their isolation location. These results indicate that there is variation
in the flagellin gene of R. pickettii.
RAPD PCR results and analysis

RAPD analysis was carried out using four different primers, three of which (P3, P15 and M13) have been
shown to discriminate between closely related strains of
Ralstonia spp. including R. mannitolilytica and Cupriavidus pauculus [Ralstonia paucula] [47,48]. The reproducibility of the RAPD method was tested by repeating the
RAPD assays at least three times for each primer used
(data not shown). The results revealed that apart from

some variations in the band intensity, no significant differences were observed between the profiles obtained,
confirming the reproducibility of the method.
Fifty-nine isolates of R. pickettii and R. insidiosa were
characterised by RAPD analysis using all four primers
and all isolates were placed into genotypes (Table 3).
Percent similarities based on the Pearson correlation
coefficients and clustering by the UPGMA method for
these isolates using the OPA03U primer is presented in
Figure 3a. Dendograms for the other primers (P3, P15
and M13) are presented in Additional File 2, Figure S1,
S2 and S3. Fragments ranged from approximately 100 to
1800 bp for all primers. Clusters were distinguished at a
similarity cut-off level of 80%. No major differentiation
between the clinical, industrial, laboratory purified water
and type strains could be observed, as these all fell into
separate groups (Table 3) with each primer. For each of
the primers there were a number of groups, with M13
there were twenty-one groups, OPA3OU there were 15
groups, P3 there were twenty-five groups and with primer P15 there were twenty-one groups. The clinical isolates grouped together with two of the primers, with
M13 they clustered together in Genotype A with the

type strain JCM5969, three laboratory water isolates and
three industrial water isolates, with P3 they clustered
together in Genotype × with nine of the industrial water
isolates (including the industrial isolates that grouped
together with the clinical isolates in Genotype A with
the M13 primer), with primers P15 and OPA30U they
fell into several clusters six with P15. The industrial
purified water isolates also fell into different groups with
all four primers. There were nine groups with primer
P15, thirteen groups with primer M13, fifteen groups
with primer P3 and eleven groups with primer
OPA3OU. The laboratory purified water isolates fell
into two different groups with primer P15, six groups
with primer M13, five groups with primer P3 and three
groups with primer OPA3OU. The isolates identified as
R. insidiosa failed to group together with any of the
RAPD primers. With the P15 primer there is one large
group that contained all the type strains, the soil strains,
ten of laboratory water purified isolates and the industrial water isolates, no other primer produced such a
large group. The diversity of the bacterial populations

studied was calculated using Simpson’s Index of Diversity (Di) [30] and the results of each individual primer
were M13-0.897, OPA3OU-0.899, P3-0.918 and P150.771. The average diversity for the four primers was
0.869. An index (D) of 0.90 or greater is a desirable
property of a typing scheme [30]. As can be seen from
the results only primer P3 with a D of 0.918 produced a
significant D index. The D value indicates that primer
P3 would be the best primer to carry out further studies
into the diversity of R. pickettii in the future as it is the
most discriminatory primer of the four tested.
BOX-PCR results and analysis

The fifty-nine isolates of R. pickettii and Ralstonia insidiosa were characterised by the BOX-PCR analysis using
the BOX-A1R primer [39]. Repeatability of the BOXPCR was considered good as the isolates showed identical profiles in three independent experiments (data not
shown). The results revealed that while there were some
variations in the band intensities, no significant differences were observed between the profiles obtained.

Percent similarities based on the Pearson correlation
coefficients and clustering by the UPGMA method for
these isolates are presented in Figure 3b. Clusters were
distinguished at a similarity cut-off level of 80%. With
the BOX primer eighteen groups were found at this cutoff level. Fragments ranged from approximately 300 to
3000 bp for all primers. The number of groups can be
seen in Table 4. The groups, in contrast to the RAPD
primers, mostly contained bacteria isolated from the
same environments e.g. Group F clustered all the type
strains together, Group M the soil strains and groups K,
L and P the clinical isolates. The industrial isolates
grouped together in-group A, B, C, D, E, G and J. The
laboratory water isolates grouped together in groups N,
O, Q and R. As with all four RAPD primers the isolates
identified as R. insidiosa failed to group together. The
Di using BOX-A1R was 0.915. These various primers
and techniques demonstrated the limited diversity of the
R. pickettii.

Discussion
In the course of this study a number of bacteria previously identified phenotypically as R. pickettii were subsequently identified as R. insidiosa using species-specific
PCR. These bacteria are hard to distinguish from each
other phenotypically [49]. R. insidiosa, the closest related
bacteria to R. pickettii [33], has been isolated from the
respiratory tracts of cystic fibrosis patients [33], river and
pond water, soil, activated sludge [33] and has also been
detected in water distribution systems [50] and laboratory purified water systems [3]. It has also been the causative agent of two cases of serious hospital infection in
two immunocompromised individuals [51].
Each of the four DNA-based fingerprinting and sequencing methods were suitable for distinguishing and grouping the isolates, although the sensitivity of the methods
varied. Of the three phenotypic methods examined, the
API 20NE system was more discriminatory than the
Remel RapID NF Plus system or the Vitek NFC. However,
the Remel RapID NF Plus system and the Vitek NFC did
prove more useful for the accurate identification of
R. pickettii isolates, as previously reported [52]. The API
20NE gave thirty-five different biotypes for fifty-nine isolates (Table 3, Figure 1), which grouped together isolates

from different environments. These results broadly agree
with those of Dimech et al who found homogeneity in
physiological parameters [25].
Genotypic studies carried out by both Dimech et al.
and Chetoui et al. hinted that R. pickettii also had genotypic homogeneity [25,26]. This was investigated in this
study using the methods described above. Our data based
on the sequence of 16S-23S spacer regions of nineteen
isolates indicated that Ralstonia pickettii is a homogenous species with little difference between isolates from
different environmental niches. Clearly using these methods we can however determine differences between
R. pickettii and R. insidiosa.
The fliC gene has been used for bacterial strain differentiation in multiple studies such as for Ralstonia solanacearum [35] and Burkholderia cepacia complex [53]. Four
different types of flagellin gene have been found in R. pickettii isolates analysed in this study (Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4).
This is similar to data from P. aeruginosa where two different types of fliC gene have been found [54] and from
the B. cepacia complex where again two different types of
fliC gene have also been found [55,56]. The fliC gene
appears however not to be useful for distinguishing
between R. pickettii and R. insidiosa based on our findings.
The division of the groups did not correlate to clinical or
environmental association or to their location of isolation.
The reasons for the variation between the 16S-23S spacer
region and the fliC gene could be potentially due to the
structure of the fliC gene. This is demonstrated by
Burkholderia flagellin sequences, which exhibit high levels
of homology in the conserved terminal regions but differ
considerably in the central region [57]. Variation is a common feature of flagellin proteins, which are believed to
fold into a hairpin-like conformation, with the terminal
domains being responsible for defining the basic filament
structure lying on the inner surface and the central, variable region being surface exposed [58].
In a previous epidemiological study involving sixteen
isolates of R. pickettii, eight different RAPD profiles were
observed for isolates coming from blood culture, distilled
water and an aqueous chlorhexidine solution [16]. In
another study, involving fourteen isolates of R. pickettii
from various biological samples the same RAPD pattern
was found in all instances [59], while Pasticci et al., carried
out a study involving fifteen isolates of R. pickettii that
gave three patterns [27]. The results of our study with a
larger number of isolates indicated that there is some
diversity in the studied populations but that this is limited
and isolates from different environments grouped
together.
The results obtained with BOX-PCR showed nineteen
different profiles among the fifty-nine isolates examined
again demonstrating limited diversity (Figure 3b). To the
best of our knowledge this is the first reported study of

Ryan et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:194
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/194

the diversity of R. pickettii and R. insidiosa carried out
with BOX-PCR. A similar study carried by Coenye et al.,
on ninety-seven B. cepacia Genomovar III isolates found
20 different patterns with a DI value of 0.821 [60].
The molecular fingerprinting methods used here
yielded rapid and reproducible fingerprints for clinical
and environmental isolates of R. pickettii and R. insidiosa.
Presently, little is known regarding the source of R. pickettii isolates occurring in hospital environments. Investigations by other authors have reported no evidence of
patient-to-patient transmission, and they suggest that
multiple independent acquisitions from environmental
sources could be an important mode of transmission of
R. pickettii [5]. The most common sites of contamination were blood-sampling tubes, dialysis machines, nebulizers and other items frequently in contact with water
[5].

Conclusions
BOX-PCR and RAPD typing was found to be more discriminatory than the typing of genes in R. pickettii such
as the fliC gene or the ISR. The majority of isolates were
shown to possess similar genotypes by both BOX and
RAPD-PCR (Figure 3a, b). The limited diversity of
R. pickettii and R. insidiosa isolates observed in this study
for fifty-nine isolates is consistent with previous findings
and indicates that R. pickettii appears to be a genotypically and phenotypically homogeneous species.
