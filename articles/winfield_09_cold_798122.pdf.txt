Abstract
Background: For plants to flower at the appropriate time, they must be able to perceive and
respond to various internal and external cues. Wheat is generally a long-day plant that will go
through phase transition from vegetative to floral growth as days are lengthening in spring and early
summer. In addition to this response to day-length, wheat cultivars may be classified as either
winter or spring varieties depending on whether they require to be exposed to an extended period
of cold in order to become competent to flower. Using a growth regime to mimic the conditions
that occur during a typical winter in Britain, and a microarray approach to determine changes in
gene expression over time, we have surveyed the genes of the major pathways involved in floral
transition. We have paid particular attention to wheat orthologues and functional equivalents of
genes involved in the phase transition in Arabidopsis. We also surveyed all the MADS-box genes that
could be identified as such on the Affymetrix genechip wheat genome array.
Results: We observed novel responses of several genes thought to be of major importance in
vernalisation-induced phase transition, and identified several MADS-box genes that might play an
important role in the onset of flowering. In addition, we saw responses in genes of the Gibberellin
pathway that would indicate that this pathway also has some role to play in phase transition.
Conclusion: Phase transition in wheat is more complex than previously reported, and there is
evidence that day-length has an influence on genes that were once thought to respond exclusively
to an extended period of cold.

Background
In plants, the timing of the change from vegetative to
reproductive growth is critical for successful reproduction,
and must occur when both internal and external conditions are appropriate. The environmental cues of daylength and temperature have a strong influence on flower-

ing, and the ability to perceive and respond to these cues
is controlled through the photoperiod and vernalisation
pathways, respectively [1].
Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is normally a long-day plant,
flowering in spring and early summer when days are

lengthening [2]. Additionally, wheat cultivars can be
broadly divided into two categories, winter or spring,
according to whether they require an extended period of
cold to become competent to flower. In winter varieties,
change from vegetative to reproductive phase is promoted
by exposure to low temperatures (3°C – 8°C) for 4–6
weeks. These varieties are planted in the autumn so that
seedlings are exposed to the cold of winter and so become
competent to flower. However, they only become committed to flower as days lengthen in the spring. In addition to these two external factors, different wheat varieties
can be distinguished by the intrinsic rate at which they
tend to pass from floral induction to heading. This tendency is referred to as earliness per se [3].
In Arabidopsis, the genetic factors underpinning phase
change have been well-characterised [4-6]. Four major
genetic pathways regulate this transition: the photoperiod
and vernalisation pathways mediate responses to the environmental cues of light and cold, respectively, whilst the
autonomous and gibberellin pathways are dependent on
endogenous signals [7-10]. Unfortunately, in studying
phase transition in cereals one cannot draw directly on the
information gained from the study of Arabidopsis since
orthologues can't always be found. For example, cereals
do not possess an orthologue of the Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (AtFLC) gene, an important repressor of
flowering [11,12]. To confuse matters more, genes with
similar sequence don't necessarily have the same function. None-the-less, comparative genetics may still provide a promising starting point for a search of candidate
genes involved in phase transition in the cereals. This certainly seems to be the case for the photoperiod pathway
where there is a remarkable degree of conservation of
functional components between Arabidopsis and rice [13].
However, the vernalisation pathway may have evolved
independently in dicots and monocots such that they use
different genes to retard flowering until winter has passed
[8]. Thus, although much is known about the genes
involved in floral transition in Arabidopsis, only recently
have candidates for the key regulators determining vernalisation requirement in cereals been identified [14,15].
In the temperate cereals barley and wheat, two genes,
VRN1 and VRN2 (unrelated to the identically named
genes in Arabidopsis), have been reported to be the key elements in the vernalisation pathway [15-17]. Several
papers addressing the issue of vernalisation have considered the interaction of just these two genes. A case in point
is the model presented by Yan et al. [15] in which TaVRN1
and TaVRN2 are presented, respectively, as a promoter
and repressor of flowering (see Additional file 1, for a
schematic representation of this). According to the model,
TaVRN1 is constitutively expressed in spring wheats but in
winter varieties is up-regulated as a consequence of ver-

nalisation. Conversely, TaVRN2 is highly expressed in
winter varieties, thus repressing flowering, but not in
spring varieties. It has been hypothesised that in winter
wheats, extended periods of cold bring about down-regulation of TaVRN2 and, as a consequence, the up-regulation of TaVRN1 and commitment to flowering.
Using Affymetrix Genechip Wheat Genome Arrays as the
platform for our analysis, we were able to consider the
broad-scale response of the transcriptome to the changes
in temperature and light that occur during a simulated
autumn to winter transition. In this paper, however, we
principally focus our attention on the components of the
vernalisation pathway. However, our experimental design
was such that we have also been able to draw conclusions
about the impact on phase transition of several components of other flowering pathways. Finally, using a microarray approach rather than a more targeted approach
allowed us to observe the expression profiles of genes that,
a priori, we would not have assayed, and have been able to
identify potentially important new players in phase transition.

Results and discussion
The growth conditions were established to broadly simulate those that would be experienced by plants sown in
October in Britain. In particular, attention was paid to the
details of suitable light quality and photoperiod (Table 1),
because there is evidence that sustaining high light intensity and an extended photoperiod while reducing temperature may result in stress related patterns of gene
expression [18].
Winter (Harnesk and Solstice) and spring wheat (Paragon) varieties of wheat were grown at 16°C day/14°C
night for 21 days, and then, over a period of nine weeks,
exposed to a slow, stepped decline in temperature and
light (Table 1). The developmental state of the crown tissue was assessed in thin tissue sections at the end of each
temperature stage (every 7 days from the third week
onwards). As shown in Figure 1, after six weeks' growth,
crowns in the spring variety were much more advanced in
their development than those in the two winter varieties –
while the apices of the winter varieties were at approximately stage 2 (elongation and early formation of leaf primordia), according to the scale proposed by Gardner et al.
[19], in Paragon a distinct spike with enlarging spikelets
and early glumes was evident (stage 5 or 6). Indeed, apices
of Paragon showed signs of double ridge formation as
early as the fifth week. The winter varieties were assessed
to be fully "vernalised" 12 weeks post-germination, and
plants treated in this way went on to flower when returned
to warmer, long-day conditions (see Additional file 2).
Unvernalised, plants of Harnesk and Solstice did not
flower (see Additional file 2, A).

Global gene expression profiles showed there to be differences between the three varieties, between the two tissues
(crown and leaf) and across the time course of the experiment (GEO accession number for array data is
GSE11774). The most marked difference in gene expression was between leaf and crown (Figure 2) with 22.8 –
28.4% of the transcripts being differentially expressed
(Table 2). In contrast, pair-wise comparisons between the
cultivars at the end of three weeks, at which time all plants
had received exactly the same treatment, showed only 1.5
– 3.7% of transcripts in crown tissue and 1.3 – 2.8% in
leaf tissue to be differentially expressed (Table 3).

In both tissues, the transcripts of thousands of genes
showed statistically significant changes in abundance
across the time-course. However, these global patterns do
not interest us in this paper. Instead, we focus on the
dynamics of expression of genes involved in phase transition. That is, initially we consider the small number of
genes reported to be specifically involved in vernalisation
in wheat, and then briefly focus on reported orthologues
and functional equivalents of the components of the
other three pathways involved in phase transition in Arabidopsis. Finally, we consider all those features annotated
as MADS-box genes.
Vernalisation in wheat
In our study, the profiles of transcript abundance of
TaVRN1, the proposed major promoter of flowering, were
entirely consistent with those reported in other studies
[15,20,21]. At three weeks, prior to exposure to cold,
TaVRN1 transcript was much more abundant in Paragon
than in the two winter varieties (Figure 3a). In Paragon,
transcript levels remained high across the time-course. In
the winter varieties, transcript levels for TaVRN1 were initially low but by 9 weeks had increased, and by 12 weeks,
when plants were assessed to be fully vernalised (plants
transferred to long days at 16°C went on to flower – see
Additional file 2, B), there had been an approximately 10
fold increase in abundance. These patterns, confirmed by
qRT-PCR (Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.76), are

consistent with the hypothesis that TaVRN1 is a promoter
of flowering induced by extended periods of cold. However, our experimental design gave us the opportunity to
make an additional and interesting observation with
regard the regulation of TaVRN1. That is, the TaVRN1
transcript accumulated in a similar fashion, although to a
lesser extent, in both vernalised plants and controls –
plants exposed to a gradual decline in light intensity and
day-length but not a decline in temperature (Figures 3a,
b). Our results suggest that TaVRN1 expression might be
influenced by both light and temperature, as has recently
been reported by Hemming et al. (2008). Indeed, the two
stimuli might act synergistically since there was greater
accumulation of transcript in the vernalised plants, which
experienced the influence of both cues, than in the control
plants, which experienced only a decline in day-length.
Alternatively, we cannot exclude the possibility that this
important promoter of flowering gradually accumulates
through time allowing plants to eventually become competent to flower even in the absence of cold. Thus, given
the later hypothesis, even following a mild winter, winter
varieties would eventually accumulate enough TaVrn1.p
to permit flowering.
Whereas, TaVRN1 behaved in a manner consistent with it
being a promoter of flowering, the profiles of abundance
of the TaVRN2 transcript were not what would be
expected of a repressor of flowering, and do not fit the
model presented in Additional file 1 (model a). In crown
tissue, where one might have expected to see a response,
since the perception of cold is thought to occur in actively
dividing cells of the shoot apical mersitem, transcript
abundance remained low (below the level of detection
with qRT-PCR) and unchanging in all three varieties. In
leaves of the winter varieties, there was a decline in abundance between weeks five and nine – a 2.5-fold and 1.7fold decline, respectively, in Harnesk and Solstice. But,
even at their highest point, transcript levels were very low
– result confirmed by qRT-PCR (Pearson correlation =
0.95). The lack of correspondence between our results for
TaVRN2 and those of other groups may find explanation
in the different experimental designs used. Our growth
conditions were designed to mimic the autumn to winter
transition. In other studies, continuous long-day condition were used in combination with either constant low

temperature (4°C), or a one-phase shift from high to low
temperature [2,16,21]. Regardless of the differences in
growth conditions, the precise role of TaVRN2 in vernalisation has already been questioned. In a recent paper, [22]
it was shown that its expression remained low when
plants were vernalised under short day conditions, and
suggested that TaVRN2 is probably not a repressor of
TaVRN1. In addition, it has been suggested that TaVrn2.p
is not able to bind the TaVRN1 promoter [12] and so can't
act as a direct repressor of its expression. Our results for
TaVRN2 correspond with those of Trevaskis et al. [22]
then, rather than with results that indicate a direct role for
VRN2 in vernalisation.
Recent discussions of the genetic control of phase transition in barley and wheat have not only brought into question the role of TaVRN2 [23,24] but indicate that genes
once thought to be exclusively controlled by temperature
may also respond to day-length [2,12,25,26]. A third
gene, TaVRN3, a component of the photoperiod pathway
thought to be a promoter of TaVRN1 expression, is upregulated by long-days. Alternative models for the relationship between these three genes are depicted in Additional file 1 (models a and b). The third component of the
models of phase transition presented in Additional File 1
is TaVRN3, which is thought to be an orthologue of AtFT
(FLOWERING LOCUS T). According to Yan and co-workers [24], TaVrn3.p is a flowering promoter which is upregulated by long days. In turn, TaVrn3.p positively regulates TaVRN1. In this model, both TaVRN1 and TaVRN3
are negatively regulated by TaVrn2.p. Vernalisation results
in a decrease in TaVrn2.p and the de-repression of
TaVRN1 and TaVRN3. Significantly, it was suggested [24]
that transcript levels of all three genes remain low under
short day conditions, and that only on transfer to long
days are TaVRN1 and TaVRN3 up-regulated and able to
initiate the cascade of events that result in flowering. Our
results for TaVRN3 agree with those of Yan et al. [24]: transcript levels of TaVRN3 remained low and unchanging
throughout the experiment in all three varieties. That is,
the plants were grown under short-day conditions, and so
TaVRN3, which requires long-days, was not expressed.
This negative result is, of itself, quite interesting since it
indicates that TaVrn3.p is not required for TaVRN1 to be

expressed; regardless of the low abundance of the TaVRN3
transcript, transcripts of TaVRN1 exhibited an increase
over the time-course.
In the light of the evidence against TaVRN2 being a repressor of TaVRN1, the group of Trevaskis [23,27] has recently
proposed a model in which TaVRN2 is presented as a possible integrator of the vernalisation and photoperiod
pathways. In this model, the principle relationship
between TaVRN1 and TaVRN2 has been reversed with
respect to earlier models; that is, TaVRN1 negatively regulates TaVRN2 (see Additional file 1, model b). In this
model, TaVRN2 is up-regulated under long-days before
the onset of winter and, in the absence of TaVrn1.p,
represses TaVRN3. After vernalisation (after winter, therefore), even though days are lengthening, TaVrn1.p is
abundant and represses TaVRN2, which, in turn, removes

the repression of TaVRN3 (synonymous with TaFT1). This
model might go some way to explain the two steps of
phase transition: i) competence to flower as a result of the
cold of winter; ii) commitment to flowering as temperatures rise and days lengthen in the spring.
Wheat orthologues and functional equivalents of
Arabidopsis floral pathway genes
There are four major genetic pathways that regulate vegetative to reproductive transition in Arabidopsis: the photoperiod and vernalisation pathways which mediate
responses to light and cold, respectively, and the autonomous and gibberellin pathways that are regulated by
endogenous signals [7-10]. We tried to identify all the
probe-sets on the Affymetrix Genechip Wheat Genome
Array that correspond to orthologues, or are functional
equivalents, of Arabidopsis genes involved in the four path-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/55

ways that control flowering (see Additional file 3). Obviously, this was not possible in all cases. However, the
major components of the photoperiod pathway in Arabidopsis do have orthologues in the cereal monocots
[8,28,29], and two of the major component of the autonomous pathway in Arabidopsis, AtFCA and AtFY, are also
conserved in monocots [28]. Using both nucleotide and
protein sequences of Arabidopsis genes, BLAST searches
were made to identify cereal genes with high sequence
similarity. These sequences were then used to search the
NETAFFX database of probe-sets on the Wheat Array
http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx. Of the 24
targets that correspond to Arabidopsis phase transition
genes, nine didn't show statistically significant changes in
abundance (two-fold, p 0.05), and were not considered
further. The other 15 showed abundance profiles that
included two-fold or greater change.across the timecourse.

the profiles of abundance that we observed, one might
assume that, in the two winter varieties, there was an
increase in gibberellins. In Arabidopsis, gibberellic acid
(GA) activates the expression of AtSOC1(SUPPRESSOR
OF OVER EXPRESSION OF CO 1) [32], an important integrator of several flowering pathways (discussed below),
which in turn promotes flowering through its action on
floral meristem identity genes or their products (Komeda
2004). What's more, Moon et al. [32] report that the gibberellin pathway is the only pathway to promote flowering under short days. Thus, it would appear that we have
evidence to show that in wheat the gibberellin pathway
functions in a similar manner to that in Arabidopsis, and
that as a consequence of vernalisation under short-days it
tends to promote flowering. However, the complete lack
of response in the spring variety, Paragon, is intriguing:
does the gibberellin pathway not function to promote
flowering in spring varieties of wheat?

GA pathway genes
The Affymetrix array doesn't include probe-sets for AtGA1
(codes for ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase) or AtGA
INSENSITIVE (the wheat orthologue is REDUCED
HEIGHT B1 [RHT B1]). There is a probe-set for AtRGA1
(the wheat orthologue of RHT D1), but we did not
observe differential accumulation of this gene. However,
there was a clear genotype-dependent, cold response of
some components of the gibberellin pathway: transcripts
for ent-kaurene synthase and ent-kaurene oxidase (correspond to AtGA2 and AtGA3, respectively), showed leaf
specific accumulation (> 20-fold increase after 12 weeks)
in the two winter varieties and no response at all in Paragon (Figure 4). This result was confirmed by qRT-PCR
(Pearson correlation = 0.99). Ent-kaurene synthase and
ent-kaurene oxidase are two of the principal enzymes of
the gibberellin biosynthetic pathway [30,31]. Thus, given

Autonomous pathway
In Arabidopsis, seven genes (AtFCA, AtFY, AtFLD, AtFVE,
AtFPA, AtLD and AtFRI) have been shown to comprise the
autonomous pathway [7,8]. All of these, except AtFRI, are
thought to promote flowering by repressing AtFLC, a
dominant repressor of flowering. AtFRI, on the other
hand, upregulates expression of AtFLC and so represses
flowering. No orthologues for AtFRI or AtFLC have been
found in the cereals (Alexandre and Hennig, 2008).
Orthologues (or, at least, genes which code for proteins
with similar structure and function) of the other six are
present in the cereals [28], but there are probe-sets for
only two of these (TaFVE and TaFCA) on the wheat array
(see Additional file 3). Both these genes showed a slight
increase in abundance across the time-course. However,
there were no particular differences in response between
the winter and spring varieties. In addition, in vernalised
and control plants transcripts for the two genes exhibited
similar profiles of abundance, as might be expected for
genes that are not thought to be responsive to light or cold
[8].

Photoperiod pathway
The principal components of the photoperiod pathway
are conserved in the monocots and, more pertinent to this
discussion, in the cereals [8,33,34]. On the Wheat
Genome Array, there are probe-sets that correspond to
many of the genes belonging to the photoperiod pathway
(Additional file 3).

In Arabidopsis, AtCONSTANS (AtCO) encodes a transcription factor that activates genes required for floral initiation. It integrates circadian clock and day-length signals
and, under long-days, activates the floral promoters AtFT,
AtSOC1 and AtLFY [8]. The two circadian clock genes
AtLHY and AtTOC1 influence the expression of AtCO.

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:55

They form part of a feedback mechanism, each directly
affecting the expression of the other: AtLhy.p is a repressor
of AtTOC1, and AtToc1.p is required for the expression of
AtLHY [8]. The cyclic expression of these two genes, which
occurs over a 24 hour period, entrains that of AtGIGANTEA (AtGI). This latter activates AtCONSTANS.
In this study, the profiles of abundance for TaLHY and
TaTOC1 were complementary to each other, as one might
expect from their relationship to each other in circadian
cycling. In crown tissue, transcript of TaLHY increased in
abundance and then declined; conversely, that of TaTOC1
declined and later increased. The profile for TaGI was very
similar to that of TaTOC1 (see Additional file 4). Given
that in both rice and Arabidopsis, GI is a promoter of CO
expression [8], one might have expected the transcript for
HEADING DATE 1 (TaHD1), the supposed wheat orthologue of AtCONSTANS, to follow the profile of TaGI.
However, it did not show differential expression in this
study. Interestingly, other transcripts that appear to be
members of the CONSTANS-like family of genes exhibited
profiles that did reflect those of TaLHY, and TaTOC1, and
TaGI. In particular, a sequence highly similar to barley
CONSTANS-like 9 (the most divergent of the barley CONSTANS-like genes which has no counterpart in Arabidopsis
[35]) had a profile of abundance very similar to that of
TaLHY (see Additional file 4). A transcript with similarity
to CONSTANS-like 1 in Lolium perenne, a gene which has
been reported to increase after extended periods of exposure to cold [36], had a profile of transcript abundance
that echoed that of TaTOC1 and TaGI. Ciannamea et al.,
using a similar experimental approach to that used in this
study, suggested that the profile of transcript abundance
for LpCOL1 was suggestive of the gene being involved in
the vernalisation response [36]. We observed a very similar profile of responses in both the cold treated plants and
the controls. This would suggest that this gene in wheat is
responding to shortening day length.
The phytochromes (perceive red and far-red light) and the
cryptochromes (perceive blue and UV-A light) are the
principle components involved in the perception of light.
What is more, phytochromes regulate a variety of developmental processes, and are thought to be involved in signaling, probably through the possession of a kinase
domain residing within their C-terminal domain [13].
Within the photoperiod pathway, it is believed that,
under long-day conditions, these photoreceptors contribute to the initiation of flowering through the stabilisation
of the CO protein [37]. Of the principal photoreceptors,
only three, TaCRY2, TaPHYA and TaPHYC, were identified
on the Affymetrix Wheat Genome Array. Two of these,
TaCRY2 and TaPHYA, exhibited a response under our
experimental conditions. Transcript of TaCRY2 accumulated, principally in leaf tissue, of the two winter varieties

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/55

under both the vernalisation regime and in the control
plants. In Paragon, no statistically significant change in
transcript abundance was observed. Transcript levels of
TaPHYA were initially much higher in the crown tissue of
the two winter varieties than in Paragon and increased
across the time course. There was also an increase in transcript abundance in leaf tissue of the winter varieties, but
from a lower initial level. The same pattern of increase was
seen in the controls.
Intergrative pathway
In Arabidopsis, the four floral pathways converge through
genes of the integrative pathway [7]. The activation of floral integrators, such as AtFLOWERING LOCUS T (AtFT)
and AtSUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS 1 (AtSOC1), in turn,
lead to the activation of floral meristem identity genes
such as LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1). We did not
observe differential expression of TaFT (see above discussion of TaVRN3). On the other hand, transcripts for wheat
genes that share sequence similarity with AtSOC1 did
show differential expression. Zhao et al. [38] identified
seven MADS-box genes (TaAGL1, TaAGL7, TaAGL18,
TaAGL20, TaAGL21, TaAGL23 and TaAGL38) that, upon
phylogenetic analysis, were placed in the SOC1-like clade
of MADS-box genes. Only three probe-sets on the wheat
array corresponded with these seven genes (see Additional
file 5). The gene TaAGL7 corresponds with the probe set
Ta.25343. The genes TaAGL1, TaAGL18 and TaAGL23 (the
most similar to AtSOC1) all correspond to one probe-set
(Ta.21250), and TaAGL20, TaAGL21 and TaAGL38 (the
least similar to AtSOC1) to another (TaAffx.19661) –
given the high sequence similarity between the genes in
the respective groups, they are probably homoeologues
and so we cannot report on their individual behaviour.
However, the three probe-sets that correspond to the
genes of the SOC1 clade of MADS-box genes all evidenced
essentially the same profile of abundance (data not
shown). That is, in both leaf and crown tissue of all three
varieties, transcript increased slightly (Figure 5).

In Arabidopsis, AtSOC1 acts as a integrator of several floral
induction pathways, and is induced by vernalisation [39].
Genes from both rice (OsMADS50) and ryegrass
(LpMADS1, LpMADS2, LpMADS3) that share sequence
similarity with AtSOC1, and may be functional equivalents of it, are also reported to accumulate as a consequence of vernalisation [40,41]. We observed a slight
increase in abundance in wheat, but the profile of abundance in the vernalised and control plants were essentially
identical. Thus, we might not be observing a response to
declining temperature but to declining day-length. Alternatively, as indicated by Shitsukawa et al. [42], it might
well be that this gene is neither influenced by vernalisation nor day-length. Indeed, this latter group present a

model in which WSOC1 acts as an activator of flowering
that is influenced by the Gibberellin pathway [42].
Other MADS-box genes
Members of the MADS-box gene family encode transcription factors that play a fundamental role in signal transduction and control of development in probably all
eukaryotes [43]. For instance, floral organ identity genes
(homeotic genes) of the ABCDE model of floral organ
development are mostly MADS genes [44]. In rice and
Arabidopsis, species for which sequencing has been completed, 73 and 107 MADS-box genes have been identified,
respectively [38]. In wheat about 50 MADS-box genes
have been identified; these are dispersed throughout the
genome [38,45]. We identified all the features on the
wheat array that correspond with MADS-box genes (see
Additional file 5) to determine whether they exhibited
abundance profiles indicative of involvement in phase
transition.

The MADS-box gene VEGETATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE
TRANSITION 2 (TaVRT2), the product of which shares
51% sequence identity with the Arabidopsis protein
SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (AtSvp.p), has been
reported to play an important role in phase transition in
wheat [12,46]. Kane et al. [46] reported that, in spring
wheat, levels of TaVrt2.p remain low and stable under
cold treatment, whilst in winter wheat it starts higher than
in spring wheat and then declines. This pattern of expression, reminiscent of that reported for TaVRN2, is consistent with the hypothesis that TaVRT2 is a repressor of
flowering. Indeed, Kane et al. [12] suggested that TaVrt2.p
(as part of a hypothesised protein complex, possibly with
TaVrn2.p) might bind to the promoter region of TaVRN1
and repress it. However, Trevaskis et al. [12,26], working

with barley, suggested that this is unlikely to be the case:
they failed to find any evidence for there being a direct
interaction between HvVRT2 and HvVRN1 (the barley
homologues of TaVRT2 and TaVRN1, respectively) and
showed that HvVRT2 transcript abundance increased during cold treatment. In our study, in both tissues of all three
varieties, there was an increase in transcript abundance
(approx. 1.5 to 2.0 fold) as temperature decreased. Thus,
our results are in agreement with those of Trevaskis et al.
[26]. If indeed VRT2 is a repressor of flowering, the profiles observed here could be explained by assuming that,
in both winter and spring varieties, there is a tendency to
retard flowering until permissive warm, long-day conditions return. That is, TaVRT2 might not repress TaVRN1
but counteract its function and so be part of a mechanism
to hold back flowering until the return of spring. Indeed,
it has been reported that short days repress reproductive
development in spring varieties [47]. That is, plants that
have no vernalisation requirement use day-length as a cue
to retard flowering until the permissive temperatures and
lengthening days of spring stimulate them to flower. Thus,
TaVRT2, a repressor of flowering, and TaVRN3, a floral
promoter, might work in concert as part of a mechanism
to check the flowering in vernalisation saturated plants
(or, indeed, in plants that don't require cold to acquire
competence to flower) until day-length is appropriate.
Finally, several less well studied MADS-box genes behaved
in an intriguing manner suggestive of their involvement in
vernalisation or photoperiod induced phase transition.
Of particular interest were TaAGL10, TaAGL33 and
TaAGL42. The gene TaAGL10 belongs to the same subfamily of MADS-box genes as TaVRN1 although their proteins shares only 52% identity [38]. Interestingly their
profiles of expression in crown tissue were quite similar –
there was little response of TaAGL10 in leaf tissue of any
of the three varieties. That is, at all three time points, transcript in Paragon was much higher than in the two winter
varieties. In the latter, transcript was initially very low but
began to accumulate by the ninth week. Analysis with
qRT-PCR showed that this increase continued to the
twelfth week (data not shown). The similarity between the
profiles of TaVRN1 and TaAGL10 suggests that they might
respond to the same cues. Further work will need to be
carried out to determine the downstream interaction of
the TaAgl10 protein.
The two genes TaAGL33 and TaAGL42 are Class I MADSbox genes. The precise function of genes belonging to this
class is not well understood [48,49]. However, both
TaAGL33 and TaAGL42 are closely related to the rice gene
OsMADS51[38] which, in rice, has been shown to be a
flowering activator under short-days[50]. In our experiment, differential expression of these two genes was
restricted to the two winter varieties (Figure 6). At three

weeks, transcript of TaAGL33 was relatively high in leaf
tissue of the two winter varieties, but declined between
the fifth and ninth weeks. This pattern corresponds with
the results reported by Trevaskis et al., [21] for the Type I
MADS-box gene, TaMx23. A BLAST search using the
sequence of TaMX23 (accession number BJ258117)
shows that the two sequences are very similar (85% identify). However, TaMx23 is more similar to the sequence of
TaAGL42 (95% identity) which showed a different profile
of abundance. Transcript of TaAGL42 increased, principally in leaf tissue, in the winter varieties and showed no
response in Paragon. If these two MADS-box genes are
involved in cold induced phase transition, their profiles of

abundance would suggests that TaAGL33 is a repressor of
flowering and TaAGL42 a promoter. The complete lack on
response of both genes in the spring wheat, Paragon, is
quite intriguing; it would indicate that in spring varieties
these genes are constitutively repressed or that they occur
as non-functional alleles. This would make sense for the
TaAGL33 transcript assuming that it were a repressor of
flowering. That is, in winter varieties it declines as a consequence of vernalisation, whilst in spring varieties it
always remains low or absent. However, the role that
TaAGL42 might have in phase change is more difficult to
interpret. If one were to hypothesise that TaAGL42 generally acts to promote flowering then it should be constitu-

tively expressed in spring varieties: it remained low and
unchanging in both tissues, however. Thus, TaAGL42
might not be involved in phase transition at all. A clue
that instead it might be involved in cold acclimation is
given by the fact that, of the MADS-box genes on the array,
it is the only one apart from TaVRT-2 that responded to a
cold "shock". That is, in a separate experiment (not
described here) in which plant were exposed to a rapid
drop in temperature from 15°C to 4°C and held for two
days, transcript of TaAGL42 in the two winter wheat varieties increased in abundance four- to five-fold over a two
day period. Transcript for TaVRT-2 approximately double
in all three varieties over the same period whilst transcript
for all other MADS-box genes studied showed no statistically significant change in abundance (Figure 7).

Conclusion

AGL21

This study, we believe, is novel in that it was carried-out
under conditions that closely reflect those that typically
occur during the winter in a northern climate – a gradual
decline in temperature, day-length and light intensity. In
most previous studies, unnaturally high light intensities
have been maintained throughout the experiment, or sudden drops in temperature have been used. These conditions may have given rise to unusual, stress-related
responses. Certainly, we have observed expression patterns for some genes that call into question earlier studies.
In choosing a microarray approach we have obtained a
broad overview of the behaviour of the wheat transcriptome to winter conditions and this has provided many
interesting clues to the interaction of the several pathways
involved in phase transition. We have also seen how these
might differ between different tissue and, particularly,
between winter and spring varieties of wheat. With regard
to many genes, we observed patterns of transcript accumulation that reflect those seen by other groups in other
studies. However, as a consequence of the conditions
under which we grew our plants, we have also made
observations that give additional insight to the complexities of the interaction that occur between floral pathways,
and how internal and external cues come into play to
ensure flowering occurs when internal and external cues
are appropriate. For instance, it has not been previously
reported that TaVRN1 might respond to light – thus, it
might be that TaVRN1 is involved in pathways other than
just the vernalisation pathway. The lack of a clear response
of TaVRN2 was also unexpected when we began our
study, but has recently been discussed by other groups
[22]. Our results support the view that this gene is probably not directly involved in vernalisation as was, until
recently, thought to be the case. Clear evidence that the
Gibberellin pathway is important in wheat and, by extension, in other cereals too, is also interesting. Finally, we
have highlighted genes that certainly warrant further

investigation such as the MADS-box genes TaAGL10,
TaAGL33 and TaAGL 42.
On a broad scale, it seems evident that phase transition
and flowering in cereals, as in Arabidopsis, is controlled by
several different pathways that allow plants to respond to
different external (temperature, day length and light quality) and internal (gibberellin and autonomous pathways)
cues. The different pathways, each responding to their
own cues and each promoting or repressing flowering
depending on the message provided by these cues, provide the checks and bounds to flowering. Thus, only when
plants are sufficiently mature and receive the appropriate
cues of temperature, day-length and a light quality will
they proceed to flower. A greater knowledge of the precise
details of these pathways will allow for the selection or
breeding of varieties to match particular environments.

Methods
Plant material
Three photoperiod responsive wheat cultivars were used
for the project: Harnesk and Solstice, both winter varieties, and Paragon, a spring variety. Seeds were planted in
50:50 potting compost:perlite in 10 cm pots and maintained in growth cabinets with a 14 h photoperiod (280)
and 16°C day/14°C night temperature. Three weeks postgermination, experimental procedures began (Table 1). As
a control, plants of Solstice were grown under identical
conditions of light and day-length as the experimental
plants but without a corresponding fall in temperature.

Samples were taken for analysis on the last day of each
time period/temperature segment: 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 weeks.
Harvesting took place in the middle of the photoperiod to
avoid, as much as possible, the influence of circadian
rhythms.
RNA extraction and purification
Total RNA was independently prepared from two separate
tissues: crown and leaf. Because of problems of handling,
"crown tissue" constituted the apex and some subtending
stem including the vascular transition zone and immature

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/55

leaf bases. In each case, RNA was extracted from material
pooled from 4 separate plants. Tissues from control plants
were harvested at the same time as the experimental
plants. The samples for RNA extraction were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until used.
RNA was extracted using the TRIZOL (Invitrogen) method
reported in [51].
Photographic imaging
Crown tissues were collected from plants and fixed and
embedded in Lambwax (Raymond A. Lamb Ltd., Eastbourne, BN23 6QE, UK) using standard histochemical
techniques [52]. De-parafinised sections were re-hydrated
and subsequently stained with 0.05% (w/v) toluidine
blue in 10 mM sodium benzoate pH4.4. Slides were
examined at low magnification under bright-field illumination using a Wild Photomacroscope IV (Leica Microsystems (UK) Ltd.). A Leica DMRB microscope (Leica
Microsystems (UK) Ltd.) was used for high magnification
observations and for the capture of photographic images.
Array analysis
Affymetrix Genechip Wheat Arrays (Affymetrix, USA)
were used. Hybridisation, washing and staining were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Microarray data were extracted from scanned GeneChip images
and analyzed using Microarray Suite version 5.0.1
(Affymetrix). Array normalisation and analysis were performed using the GeneSpring GX 7.3 software package
(Agilent): the raw data, imported as CEL files, were normalised per chip using RMA (log-scale Robust Multi-array
Analysis) open access GeneSpring software; per gene normalisation to the median was performed within the programme. These data are available for public access: the
GEO accession number for array data is GSE11774.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
To confirm expression patterns observed from the analysis
of array data, real time qRT-PCR experiments were performed using an ABI Prism 7000 SDS (Applied Biosystems, U.K.). Reverse transcription was performed using
Superscript III First Strand Synthesis Kits (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RTPCR was performed using SYBR Greener qPCR Supermix
for ABI Prism (Invitrogen). The primers used are available
in Additional file 6. Reaction conditions were as follows:
50°C for 2 mins; 95°C for 10 mins; 42 cycles of 95°C for
15 s and 58°C 1 min. A dissociation protocol was performed in all cases. Quantification for each primer pair
and cDNA template combination was performed in triplicate for each of the two biological replicates at every time
point.

Relative quantification was performed using the ΔCt ΔCt
method with wheat ACTIN used as the endogenous control. Correlation between results from the array data and
