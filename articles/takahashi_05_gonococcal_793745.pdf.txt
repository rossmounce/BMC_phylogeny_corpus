Abstract
Background: It has been speculated that the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (ggt) gene is present only
in Neisseria meningitidis and not among related species such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria
lactamica, because N. meningitidis is the only bacterium with GGT activity. However, nucleotide
sequences highly homologous to the meningococcal ggt gene were found in the genomes of N.
gonorrhoeae isolates.
Results: The gonococcal homologue (ggt gonococcal homologue; ggh) was analyzed. The
nucleotide sequence of the ggh gene was approximately 95 % identical to that of the meningococcal
ggt gene. An open reading frame in the ggh gene was disrupted by an ochre mutation and frameshift
mutations induced by a 7-base deletion, but the amino acid sequences deduced from the artificially
corrected ggh nucleotide sequences were approximately 97 % identical to that of the
meningococcal ggt gene. The analyses of the sequences flanking the ggt and ggh genes revealed that
both genes were localized in a common DNA region containing the fbp-ggt (or ggh)-glyA-opcA-dedAabcZ gene cluster. The expression of the ggh RNA could be detected by dot blot, RT-PCR and
primer extension analyses. Moreover, the truncated form of ggh-translational product was also
found in some of the gonococcal isolates.
Conclusion: This study has shown that the gonococcal ggh gene is a pseudogene of the
meningococcal ggt gene, which can also be designated as Ψggt. The gonococcal ggh (Ψggt) gene is
the first identified bacterial pseudogene that is transcriptionally active but phenotypically silent.

Background
Two members of the gram-negative diplococci, Neisseria
meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, are particularly
associated with pathological infections. N. meningitidis is
specialized for the mucosa of the nasopharynx and causes
meningitis and septicemia. N. gonorrhoeae is adapted for
the mucosa of the urogenital tract and causes gonorrhoea
and pelvic inflammatory diseases. Both species colonize

only humans and share a great deal of relatedness at the
nucleotide level [1]. This high degree of relatedness is
reflected in the many common genetic, biochemical and
antigenic features of the two bacteria.
γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (also called γ-glutamyl aminopeptidase) (EC2.3.2.2; GGT) catalyzes the hydrolysis of
γ-glutamyl compounds, and is found in a variety of

bacteria such as Escherichia coli [2] and Helicobacter pylori
[3,4]. To distinguish N. meningitidis from N. gonorrhoeae,
GGT activity is used as one of the identification markers
for N. meningitidis because N. meningitidis is positive for
this activity but N. gonorrhoeae and related species, e.g.,
Neisseria lactamica, are not [5]. In fact, the detection of
GGT activity is applied for the identification of N. meningitidis in the Gonochek II enzymatic identification system
(E-Y Laboratories Inc., U.S.A.) [6-9]. From these empirical
facts, it was believed that the gene encoding for GGT
should exist only in N. meningitidis, but this has not been
proven yet [3].
Recent remarkable progress in the sequencing of various
genomes has led to the detection of nucleotide sequences
that appear to be phenotypically silent, termed pseudogenes. The pseudogenes are defined as DNA sequences of
formerly functional genes rendered nonfunctional by
mutations and usually identified by their disrupted open
reading frames (ORFs). Pseudogenes have been identified
in a variety of eukaryotes, including insects [10], plants
[11], and particularly vertebrates [10,12], but are relatively few in the bacterial genomes. Notable exceptions
are intracellular bacterial parasites such as Rickettsia prowazekii and Mycobacterium leprae [13], which seem to have
lost many genes due to obtaining nutritional supplies
from the host cells. Cryptic genes such as the cel operon in
E. coli [14-16] and the flagellar master operon in the genus
Shigella [17-19] seem to be a kind of pseudogenes, but are
different from pseudogenes because the cryptic genes
completely retain intact ORFs, which can be occasionally
activated by rare genetic events such as mutation, recombination, insertion of elements. As a whole, compared to
the pseudogenes in eukaryotes, relatively few pseudogenes have been reported in bacterial genomes [20].
In this study, a gonococcal ggh gene, which is highly
homologous to the meningococcal ggt gene, was found to
be pseudogene. Sequence analyses of the flanking regions
of both the ggt and ggh genes suggest that both genes were
derived from a gene in a common ancestor, and subsequently diversified.

Results
The gonococcal ggh gene was highly homologous to the
meningococcal ggt gene
Since GGT activity was detected only in N. meningitidis
among the related species, it was speculated that the corresponding gene also existed only in N. meningitidis. However, by BLAST search, the nucleotide sequences highly
homologous to the meningococcal ggt gene were found in
the genome of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 [GenBank:NC_002946]. The overall nucleotide sequence of
the meningococcal ggt homologue was approximately 95
% identical to that of the meningococcal ggt gene (data

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/56

not shown and additional file). Eleven N. gonorrhoeae
clinical strains were analyzed by PCR, and the corresponding DNA fragments were amplified in all of these strains
(Figure 1B), indicating that this gene was generally
present in N. gonorrhoeae. To analyze whether ggt homologues existed in the genomes of the other neisserial
strains, Southern blotting was performed (Figure 1C).
DNA fragments that hybridized with the meningococcal
ggt gene were found in the meningococcal and gonococcal
genomes (Figure 1C lanes 1–3) but not in the other neisserial genomes (Figure 1C lanes 4–11). These results suggested that the meningococcal ggt homologue was present
only in N. gonorrhoeae among the neisserial species examined. The putative gene in N. gonorrhoeae was named ggh
(ggt gonococcal homologue).
Variations of the nucleotide sequences of ggh genes among
clinical isolates
To characterize the gonococcal ggh gene, the ggh genes
were amplified from the chromosomal DNA of 11 N. gonorrhoeae strains and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences
of the ggt genes from 7 N. meningitidis strains and of the
ggh genes from the 11 N. gonorrhoeae strains were aligned,
and the distance matrix calculated from these data was
displayed as a phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A). The results
revealed that the nucleotide sequences of the gonococcal
ggh genes were more divergent than those of the meningococcal ggt genes (Figure 2A). Alignment of the nucleotide
sequences of the 11 gonococcal ggh genes also showed
that the mutations in the ggh gene consisted of the following four polymorphisms: 1) a 6-base insertion (named
Type I), 2) an ochre mutation (Type II), 3) a 7-base deletion (Type III), 4) a 46-base insertion (Type IV) (Figure 2B
and Table 2). In addition, all of the 11 ggh genes had onenucleotide substitutions compared to the ggt genes in the
same 25 sites (Figure 2B and additional file), with only 2
exceptions: a one-nucleotide variation in NIID109 (48th
base A to G) and another in NIID105 (213th base G to A)
(Table 2). The one-base substitutions in the common sites
of the ggh genes strongly suggested that reconstruction of
the ggh gene would have occurred at an early stage after
speciation (See Discussion).
Putative amino acid sequences in hypothetical coding
region of the ggh genes
Due to the ochre (Type II) and 7-base deletion (Type III)
mutations, the ORF in each ggh gene was completely disrupted by the formation of 8 or 20 stop codons (Figure
3A). In fact, none of the gonococcal isolates showed any
GGT activity (data not shown and [5,9]), indicating that
there was no expression of functional GGT-like protein in
N. gonorrhoeae. All of these results showed that the gonococcal ggh gene was a pseudogene of the functional ggt
gene in N. meningitidis. On the other hand, if the two types
of mutations (Types II and III) in the ggh genes were

artificially corrected, the hypothetical amino acid
sequences were approximately 97 % identical to those of
the meningococcal ggt genes and were highly conserved
among the gonococcal ggh genes (Figure 3B). This result
also supported the idea that the ggh and ggt genes were
derived from a common ancestral gene and that the translational inactivation of the gonococcal ggh gene was solely
due to the ochre (Type II) and the frame-shift mutations
caused by the 7-base deletion (Type III).

The genetic organization of the ggt- and ggh-flanking

By using the information in the database for N. meningitidis strain MC58 [21], N. gonorrhoeae strain FA1090 and
N. lactamica (the neisserial species most closely related to
the above two species) ST-640 strain, the flanking regions
of the meningococcal ggt and the gonococcal ggh genes
were further analyzed. The ggt and ggh genes were both
localized in the identical gene cluster of fbp-ggt (or ggh)glyA-opcA-dedA-abcZ in the genomes of N. meningitidis and
N. gonorrhoeae, respectively (Figure 4). The fbp-glyA-dedAPage 5 of 13

respectively.

abcZ locus was also found in the genome of N. lactamica
but lacked the ggt and opcA homologues (Figure 4). This
highly conserved genetic organization implied that a DNA
island containing an original ggt gene was first incorporated into an ancestor's genome of the above three species
and subsequently diversified after the speciation (see
Discussion).
The expression of the ggh gene in N. gonorrhoeae
The hitherto identified bacterial pseudogenes are not
expressed transcriptionally or translationally [20,22-24].
To examine the ggh transcriptional expression, dot blot
analysis was first performed and RNA that hybridized
with the ggt probe was detected in the total RNAs of 4 N.
gonorrhoeae strains (Figure 5A). The transcriptional expression was also confirmed by RT-PCR, and the products
were amplified with all 3 sets of primers from total RNA
of all 4 N. gonorrhoeae strains tested (Figure 5B). These
results strongly suggested that the full-length ggh gene
transcript was expressed in N. gonorrhoeae. Primer exten-

sion analysis further revealed that the gonococcal ggh RNA
was transcribed from the same starting point as the
meningococcal ggt mRNA (Figure 5C and 5D). All of these
results indicated that the gonococcal ggh gene was transcriptionally active though it was a pseudogene.
To further study the translational expression of the truncated GGT-like protein in N. gonorrhoeae, Western blotting
was performed with anti-meningococcal GGT rabbit
antiserum [25]. When the same amounts of the whole cell
extracts were analyzed (Figure 6B), approximately 15-kDa
bands were detected in the extracts of NIID103 and
NIID106 N. gonorrhoeae strains (Figure 6A lanes 5 and 7).
Because the 15-kDa protein was not observed in the ∆ggh
background of NIID103 and NIID106 (Figure 6A lanes 6
and 8), the 15-kDa protein was thought to be the ggh gene
product whose translation was terminated at the 145th
codon (Figure 3B). However, the 15-kDa protein was not
found in the extracts of the ATCC49226 and NIID54 N.
gonorrhoeae strains (Figure 6A, lanes 3 and 4) and seemed

not to be expressed in any of the other gonococcal strains
(see Discussion).

Discussion
In this study, it was shown that the gonococcal ggh gene is
a member of bacterial pseudogenes, and is transcribed but
not properly translated so that active ggh protein product
is not produced. 11Fh-mtTFA [26], OsMu4-2 [27], NA88A [28], Makorin1-p1 [29], Dnm3a2 [30] and pseudoNOS
[31] genes are known to be transcriptionally active
eukaryotic pseudogenes. In neisseriae, the gonococcal
porA and ΨopcB genes have been reported as neisserial
pseudogenes [1,32,33]. The porA pseudogene contains
mutations in the promoter and the coding regions, and is
not translated [24]. While some hypothetical bacterial
pseudogenes with repetitive runs of A and T are speculated
to be potentially expressed by transcriptional slippage
[34], the expression, including the transcription, has not
been proven yet. To our knowledge, the gonococcal ggh
gene is the first identified bacterial pseudogene that is
transcriptionally active.
The 15-kDa derivative of the putative ggh protein product
is detected in the NIID103 and NIID106 N. gonorrhoeae
strains but not in the ATCC49226 and NIID54 N. gonorrhoeae strains (Figure 6A). Since the predicted amino acid
sequences of the putative 15-kDa proteins seem to be similar among the 4 gonococcal strains, the reason why the
15-kDa protein was not detected in ATCC49226 and
NIID54 is not clear. The 15-kDa protein might be
degraded in ATCC49226 and NIID54 backgrounds but
not in NIID103 and NIID106 backgrounds. It seems
unlikely that the 15-kDa protein encoded by the ggh gene
has an essential function for N. gonorrhoeae because the
15-kDa protein is not always detected in any of gonococcal strains (Figure 6A).
Why does the gonococcal ggh gene still retain the transcriptional activity? There are some examples in which
RNAs transcribed from pseudogenes have some biological
functions: antisense RNA expressed from the pseudoNOS
gene hybridizes with nNOS (nitric oxide synthase) mRNA,
resulting in the suppression of the nNOS gene expression
in the neurons of the snail Lymnaea stagnalis [31]. RNA of
Makorin1-1p, a pseudogene of Makorin1, regulates the
Makorin1 mRNA stability, which is important for the correct formation of the kidneys and bone in mice [29].
Some eukaryotic genes may be duplicated and one of the
plural genes may be subsequently reconstructed due to its
redundancy, resulting in a pseudogene. However, since a
bacterial pseudogene generally does not have a functional
counterpart (wild-type gene) in a single organism, the ggh
RNA does not seem to have the same kind of biological
function as the pseudoNOS and Makorin1-1p genes. In fact,
we could not find any prominent phenotype for a ∆ggh

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/56

gonococcal mutant (unpublished data). However, we
cannot exclude the possibility that the ggh RNA has some
biological function(s) in other milieus such as the urogenital tract and further analyses will be required to
address this possibility.
The ggt and ggh genes are located in the fbp-ggt (ggh)-glyAopcA-dedA-abcZ common gene cluster in the genomes of
both N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae (Figure 4) [23].
The genome of N. lactamica lacks ggt and opcA homologues in the fbp-glyA-dedA-abcZ locus (Figure 4 and [23]).
It would not be the result of chance that the two ggt (or
ggh) and opcA genes are located in the same respective sites
of the fbp-glyA-dedA-abcZ gene locus of both N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae but not in that of N. lactamica.
Moreover, it is also unlikely that a nonfunctional ggh gene
was horizontally transferred into the gonococcal fbp-glyAopcA-dedA-abcZ gene cluster since such a pseudogene
could not have been sustained due to the lack of selection
[23]. Therefore, it seems more probable that the fbp-ggtglyA-opcA-dedA-abcZ gene cluster was present in an ancestor of the three neisserial species, and has been subsequently diversified independently among the three
species, as shown for the opcA gene [23]. During the diversification, the meningococcal ggt gene has been maintained in an active state while the gonococcal ggh gene has
been reconstructed by insertion, deletion and
substitutions, resulting in the translational inactivation.
In N. lactamica, the ggt and opcA homologues might have
been lost because of their dispensability for N. lactamica
(see below).
It is also interesting that the ggh gene has not been fully
deleted from the gonococcal genome. The kinds and sites
of mutations in the ggh genes are relatively few and highly
conserved, respectively, among the gonococcal isolates
(Figure 2B, Table 2 and additional file). It is also noted
that, while in general the RNA polymerase-binding sites
and SD regions of pseudogenes are highly degraded, there
are also a few exceptions in species such as Y. pestis that
could have emerged in recent evolutionary times [35].
Since the ribosome-binding sites (Shine-Dalgarno
regions) of the gonococcal ggh gene are identical to those
of the meningococcal ggt gene and the RNA polymerasebinding sites are almost completely conserved (with a
one-nucleotide difference) (Figure 5D), it is speculated
that the reconstruction of the ggh gene may have occurred
in relatively recent evolutionary times. From the evolutional viewpoint, the drastic deletion of the approximately 2-kb DNA region containing the ggh gene in N.
gonorrhoeae may not have been likely to occur in such a
short period. Alternatively, deletion of the 2-kb DNA
region may not be more advantageous for gonococcal
evolution than reconstruction involving short deletions,
insertions and substitutions.

The maintenance of a functional ggt gene in N. meningitidis would have some advantages for its survival. N. meningitidis causes meningitis, which is due to the
meningococcal invasion into the human central nervous
system, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [36-38]. It has
been shown that meningococcal GGT has a physiological
function of acquiring cysteine from environmental γglutamyl-cysteinyl peptides under cysteine-limited environments such as the CSF [39]. Almost all (98.8 %)
meningococcal isolates from humans are positive for GGT
activity [40]. All of these results suggest that the GGT activity is important for N. meningitidis but not for N. gonorrhoeae. The dispensability of GGT activity for N.
gonorrhoeae seems to be consistent with the fact that a
cysteine-limited milieu such as the CSF in humans is not
a natural gonococcal habitat. However, it is not very likely
that the milieu of CSF exerts selective pressure for an
active ggt gene because human CSF is not a relevant milieu
for human-to-human spread of meningococcus [41]. We
believe that the meningococcal GGT must have some
unknown essential function(s) for N. meningitidis and further studies will elucidate the function(s).

Conclusion
Our data on the ggh gene indicate that the ggh gene in N.
gonorrhoeae is a pseudogene of the functional ggt gene in
N. meningitidis. To our knowledge, the ggh gene is the first
reported bacterial pseudogene that is transcriptionally
active but phenotypically silent. Our findings may also
contribute to understanding the speciation of N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Seven N. meningitidis strains (H44/76, H114/90, 2996,
NIID68, NIID76, NIID413 and NIID414) were described
in our previous reports [42,43]. Ten N. gonorrhoeae strains
(NIID54, NIID102, NIID103, NIID104, NIID105,
NIID106, NIID107, NIID108, NIID109 and NIID111),
one N. mucosa strain (NIID16) and one N. sicca strain
(NIID17) were clinical isolates donated by T. Kuroki and
Y. Watanabe. All of the clinical strains were mutually independent: they were isolated in different periods and from
different persons who lived in different areas of Japan. The
following 7 neisserial strains were obtained from ATCC
(species / ATCC no.): N. gonorrhoeae / ATCC49226; N.
lactamica / ATCC23970; N. flavescence / ATCC13120; N.
denitrificans / ATCC14686; N. elongata / ATCC25295; N.
canis / ATCC14687; N. cinerea / ATCC14685. All of the
strains were stored by the gelatin disc method [42] and
cultivated on GC agar (Becton-Dickinson) supplemented
with 1 % IsovitaleX enrichment (Becton-Dickinson) at
37°C in 5 % CO2, or in GC broth (1.5 % proteose-peptone, 0.5 % NaCl, 0.05 % soluble starch, 0.1 % K2HPO4,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/5/56

0.4 % KH2PO4, 1 % IsoVitaleX, 5 mM NaHCO3 10 mM
MgCl2) at 37°C with shaking.
Isolation of chromosomal DNA, PCR, Southern blotting
and dot blotting
Isolation of chromosomal DNA, PCR, Southern blotting
and dot blotting were performed as described in our previous report [43].
Nucleotide sequence determination and analyses
The ggt and ggh genes were amplified with a set of primers
(ggt-3 and ggt-4) by PCR, and the resulting products were
purified using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit
(Roche) as templates for sequencing. The sequencing was
performed as described previously [25]. Primers used for
sequencing are listed in Table 1. Raw data from the ABI
sequencer were assembled with the program DNASIS ver.
3.2 (HITACHI, Japan). The sequence alignment was performed with GENETYX-MAC ver.11 (GENETYX, Japan).
Phylogenetic analyses were performed by constructing a
distance matrix of nucleotide mismatches using the web
site of the Belozersky Institute at Moscow State University
[44] and visualized by Split decomposition analysis with
the program SPLITSTREE, version 3.2 [45].
Construction of ∆ggh::spc N. gonorrhoeae mutants
HT1195 (NIID103 ∆ggh::spc) and HT1196 (NIID106
∆ggh::spc), in which a spectinomycin resistance gene (spc)
was inserted into the ggh gene, were constructed as follows: A 2-kb fragment containing the ggh gene of NIID103
or NIID106 was amplified by PCR and cloned in the SmaI
site of pUC18 (Takara Bio) to construct pHT412 or
pHT413, respectively. A blunted 1-kb fragment
containing the spc gene [25] was inserted into the EcoRV
sites of pHT412 and pHT413, respectively. The EcoRV sites
are located at 277 bp and 1642 bp (NIID103
[DDBJ:AB175025]) and at 271 bp and 1590 bp (NIID106
[DDBJ:AB175027]) downstream from the transcriptional
start point of each ggh gene, respectively (see Figure 5D).
The resulting plasmids were named pHT414 and pHT415,
respectively. Five hundred nanograms of the plasmids
linearized by digestion with EcoRI were transformed into
NIID103 and NIID106, respectively, as described previously [43]. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were selected
on GC agar plates containing 75 µg/ml spectinomycin.
The resulting mutants were isolated as ∆ggh::spc NIID103
∆ggh::spc
NIID106
(HT1196),
(HT1195),
and
respectively. The allelic exchange was confirmed by PCR
and Southern blotting.
RT-PCR
Bacteria grown on GC agar plates were suspended in 20
ml of GC broth to an OD600 of 0.1 and continuously cultured to mid-log phase (OD600 of ~ 0.6) at 37°C with
shaking. The total RNA was isolated from the harvested

bacteria as previously described [46] with an additional
treatment with DNase I. RT-PCR was performed using one
step RT-PCR Kit Ver. 1.1 (Takara Bio, Japan) with approximately 2 µg of total RNA according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The products were visualized by electrophoresis in a 2 % agarose gel followed by ethidium bromide staining.
Primer extension analysis
Fifty micrograms of total RNA and 5 pmol of biotinlabeled primer (ggt-ext-2) were hybridized in 20 µl of
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM
KCl). The hybridized RNA-DNA probe was treated with
35 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (RTase) XL (Takara
Bio) in a reaction mixture (250 µM dNTPs, 1 × AMV
reverse transcriptase XL buffer) at 37°C for 30 min. The
ethanol-precipitated DNA product was dissolved in 20 µl
of formamide dye (80 % formamide, 10 mM NaOH, 1
mM EDTA, 0.025 % bromophenol blue, 0.025 % xylene
cyanol). Sequencing of the ggt and ggh genes with the ggtext-2 primer was performed by using ∆Th polymerase
sequencing high -cycle- (TOYOBO, Japan). Aliquots of the
reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 8
% acrylamide-7 M urea gel followed by capillary blotting
to Hybond-N+ (Amersham). The bands were visualized
with Imaging high (TOYOBO) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
