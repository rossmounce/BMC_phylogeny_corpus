Abstract
Background: The POU5F1 gene encodes the octamer-binding transcription factor-4 (Oct4). It is crucial in the
regulation of pluripotency during embryonic development and widely used as molecular marker of embryonic
stem cells (ESCs). The objective of this study was to identify and to analyse the promoter region of rabbit POU5F1
gene; furthermore to examine its expression pattern in preimplantation stage rabbit embryos.
Results: The upstream region of rabbit POU5F1 was subcloned sequenced and four highly conserved promoter
regions (CR1-4) were identified. The highest degree of similarity on sequence level was found among the
conserved domains between rabbit and human. Among the enhancers the proximal enhancer region (PE-1A)
exhibited the highest degree of homology (96.4%). Furthermore, the CR4 regulator domain containing the distal
enhancer (DE-2A) was responsible for stem cell-specific expression. Also, BAC library screen revealed the
existence of a processed pseudogene of rabbit POU5F1. The results of quantitative real-time PCR experiments
showed that POU5F1 mRNA was abundantly present in oocytes and zygotes, but it was gradually reduced until
the activation of the embryonic genome, thereafter a continuous increase in POU5F1 mRNA level was observed
until blastocyst stage. By using the XYClone laser system the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophoblast portions of
embryos were microdissected and examined separately and POU5F1 mRNA was detected in both cell types.
Conclusion: In this study we provide a comparative sequence analysis of the regulatory region of rabbit POU5F1
gene. Our data suggest that the POU5F1 gene is strictly regulated during early mammalian development. We
proposed that the well conserved CR4 region containing the DE-2A enhancer is responsible for the highly
conserved ESC specific gene expression. Notably, we are the first to report that the rabbit POU5F1 is not
restricted to ICM cells only, but it is expressed in trophoblast cells as well. This information may be well applicable
to investigate further the possible phylogenetic role and the regulation of POU5F1 gene.

Background
The POU5F1 gene belongs to the POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) family of transcription factors, that encodes the octamer-binding transcription factor-4 (Oct4) [1]. In mouse, before the
zygotic gene activation the active POU5F1 mRNA is
present in the oocyte. The zygotic expression is activated
around the 4-cell stage and later restricted to the pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) and to the epiblast.
Following implantation, the expression is down-regulated
and limited to the primordial germ cells (PGC) but
silenced in all somatic cells [2]. In vitro embryo studies in
bovine, pig, rhesus monkey and in human have shown
that the protein is present in the trophoblast cells of blastocyst stage embryos and it is not restricted to the pluripotent ICM cells [3-6]. In vitro, POU5F1 is highly expressed
in human and mouse ESCs. These cells lose their pluripotency during differentiation, therefore the POU5F1
expression is diminished [7,8].
The POU5F1 protein is among the core group of transcription factors that induces and controls stemness in ESCs. It
sustains pluripotency through feed-forward and feedback
transcriptional mechanism and it also plays a crucial role
in the early mammalian development [7,9].
The expression of POU5F1 is controlled by cis-regulatory
elements, located 5' upstream from the initiation site of
transcription [2,10]. The regulatory region of POU5F1 is
highly conserved among species; and usually contains
four conserved regions (CR) within the promoter. The
TATA-less minimal promoter (MP) region is always
located within the first conserved region (CR1) of the
upstream sequence of the gene. This minimal promoter
contains further primary regulatory elements, such as
Sp1/Sp3, and hormone responsive element (HRE) binding sites. Reporter gene expression experiments in mouse
with LacZ revealed that two elements, the proximal
enhancer (PE) and the distal enhancer (DE) are essential
in the cell-specific regulation of POU5F1. The proximal
enhancer (PE) is located about 1.2 kb upstream, within
conserved regions (CR2 and CR3) and is responsible for
POU5F1 expression in embryonic ectoderm and mouse
embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. Finally, the distal
enhancer (DE) located about 2 kb upstream, also within a
conserved region (CR4) and drives the POU5F1 expression in the morula, ICM, ESC, embryonic germ (EG) and
PGC cells of the mouse [2,11,12].
Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a classical experimental
animal model due to its physiological and immunological properties; it is preferentially used in pulmonary, cardiovascular and metabolic studies, as well as for antibody
production and drug screening. In mouse, a wide range of
genetic methods have been developed so far, and the successful application of the same technology in rabbits
would be very desirable. Recent publications about gener-

ating rabbit ESCs [13,14] and successful somatic cell
nuclear transfer (SCNT) experiments [15,16] raise the
possibility for increasing the use of rabbit model systems
for wider applications.
Although the rabbit POU5F1 cDNA and the genomic
DNA sequences were recently published [17], the isolation and the detailed characterisation of its regulatory
region is still missing. Moreover, its expression during
embryo preimplantation has not yet been well characterized [18]. This study for the first time describes isolation
and sequencing of the rabbit orthologue of POU5F1 5'
regulatory region and the identification of its phylogenetically conserved regions. We also examined the function
of the individual truncated promoter regions using GFP
reporter gene system. In addition we also examined the
expression pattern of rabbit POU5F1 in individual preimplantation stage embryos using quantitative real-time
PCR.

Results
Isolation of the rabbit POU5F1 upstream region
Recently, the MHC region of rabbit was mapped [19] and
partial POU5F1-like gene has been sequenced on BAC
clones LBAB-841A3 and LBAB-85810. Based on multispecies sequence comparison (human, mouse and bovine
POU5F1 genes), primers were designed for the conserved
regions (oct4-435 and oct4-186, Table 1), and applied for
PCR screens and further sequencing.

The sequenced 7.5 kb POU5F1-like region was confirmed
as the rabbit's entire POU5F1 gene by multiple sequence
comparison. Five highly conserved regions have been
found, which perfectly matched with the well-characterized five exons of the reference sequences. The lengths of
the sequences of these conserved, putative exonic regions
were quite similar but not identical, indicating the existence of non-conserved intronic regions. The complete
rabbit POU5F1 sequence is now referred to as EF194086
and mapped to the MHC region, 12q1.1 [17].
To confirm the coding sequence of POU5F1, RACE PCR
was applied on blastocyst samples. The gene-specific
inner primers were bound to the conserved region of the
gene; the outer primers were annealed to the 5'UTR and
the polyA tail. The expressed and coding region was found
to be 1083 bp, which matched exactly with the previously
predicted exons. The rabbit cDNA sequence was identical
to human, mouse and bovine in 84%, 83% and 87%,
respectively. The cDNA sequence is now referred as
EF062856[17].
Sequence analysis of the rabbit POU5F1 promoter region
Following confirmation of the POU5F1-like sequence as a
rabbit coding sequence, the 2.2 kb fragment of the
POU5F1 upstream region was sequenced and aligned to

its orthologues (Figure 1). The alignment proved the presence of four extensively conserved regions (CR1-4) and
three enhancer regions in the rabbit POU5F1 5' upstream
sequence. These CR regions are known to be the functional regions of the POU5F1 promoter in several species
[11,20]. The different regions in rabbit showed extensive
identity compared to the human, bovine, dog and to
mouse sequences (Figure 1). In rabbit, the TATA-less minimal promoter (MP) that is located within the CR1 region,
extends until -221 bp, and contains both the overlapping
binding sites of Sp1/Sp3 (-120/-110), the hormone
responsive element (-111/-94) and three G/C rich regions
(Figure 1). The E-box sequence in rabbit (CACTTG), that
plays a regulatory role in the control of transcription by
binding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, is located within the proximal enhancer Region 1B
(PE-1B;-945/-940). The proximal enhancer Region 1B (968/-940) is localized within the CR2 region (-1023/824), while the proximal enhancer Region 1A (PE-1A;1232/-1192) is located outside of the CR2 region (-1480/
-1376). This PE-1A region exceptionally shows less similarity to all reference species. The CR3 region is localized
upstream of PE-1A sequence. The distal enhancer region
(DE-2A) is located within the CR4 region (-2450/-1901),
last from -2025 to -2004 bp. Transcription factor (TF)
binding site, Oct4/Sox2 is located (-1977/-1962) in the
distal enhancer, within the CR4 region. We have identified several G/C-rich motifs present in all of the five mammalian sequences; however the one near the PE-1A

enhancer we found a CCCACCC motif present only in
rabbit. This motif partially overlaps the CCCTCCC
sequence. The schematic draw of organization of rabbit
POU5F1 promoter region is shown in Figure 2.
Table 2 shows the pairwise comparison of the rabbit and
four other mammalian POU5F1 regulatory regions. The
analysis unambiguously revealed that the human has the
closest potential evolutionary orthologue of the rabbit
POU5F1 regulatory region. This is supported with the
highest homology that could be observed between rabbit
and human in all of the four conserved regions and in the
PE-1B and DE-2A enhancers. The complete minimal promoter (0/-221 bp) and PE-1A enhancer were the two
exceptional regions where the dog sequence showed the
highest homology compared to the rabbit sequence
(Table 2).
Functional analysis of the promoter regions
Four different reporter constructs were electroporated into
mouse ESCs to test the functionality of the predicted conserved region in the POU5F1 promoter (Figure 3). The
minimal (proximal) promoter (CR1), the proximal promoter with proximal enhancers (CR1+(CR2 and CR3),
the proximal promoter with distal enhancer (CR1+CR4)
and the entire promoter region (CR1+(CR2 and
CR3)+CR4) were tested. The fluorescent activity of the
minimal promoter (CR1) was very weak compared to the
control ubiquitin promoter and to the basic auto-fluoresPage 3 of 12

cence of non-transfected control R1 ESCs (Figure 3).
Therefore, the rabbit POU5F1 regulatory region is capable
to express in mouse ESC as a minimal promoter. The addition of CR2+CR3 regions did not increase the level of
expression substantially compared to the CR1 fragment.
However, when the CR4 region was co-transfected with
the minimal promoter (CR1), the level of expression was
increased more than two fold. Similarly, the expression
was also two fold higher compared to that of the CR1
alone, when the full promoter region [CR1+(CR2 and
CR3)+CR4] was transfected or the region of CR1+(CR2
and CR3) was co-transfected with the CR4. However, the
intensity of the expression was significantly less compared
to the ubiquitin promoter (B6U-3 ESC) or to the control
pmaxGFP vector expression (Figure 3). When its expression was compared to the mouse POU5F1 minimal promoter (CR1) and distal enhancer-containing promoter
region construct (Oct4-GiP) [21], the later exhibited a
lower expression intensity in average (Figure 3).

rabbit embryos, and compared with the mouse POU5F1
expression. In all examined stages the mRNA of POU5F1
was detectable in the embryos with various intensities.
The mRNA was present in oocytes and zygotes at a higher
level (Figure 4a and 4b), but the levels continuously
decreased until the embryonic genome activation, which
occurs between late 8- to 16-cell stages during rabbit preimplantation development [18,22,23]). Following the
embryonic genome activation, the expression levels
increased continuously until the blastocyst stage (Figure
4b). The POU5F1 transcript was also quantified in the isolated ICM and trophoblast portions of the rabbit blastocysts and the relative levels were compared taking the
blastocyst transcript as calibrator. The comparison
revealed that the POU5F1 gene was clearly expressed in
both cell types but at a significantly higher (p < 0.05) level
in the ICM compared to the trophoblast cells (Figure 4c).
Identification of pseudogenes
BAC library screen was performed with primers oct4-435
and oct4-186 (Table 1) and BAC clones LBAB-304A07
and LBAB-779H10 were identified. Both clones contain a
POU5F1-like sequence, and although they lack introns,
they contain remnants of polyA tail flanked by direct
repeats, all of the characteristics of retrotransposed pseudogenes [24,25]. Based on sequencing the flanking
region, the two BAC clones were found to be identical,
containing the same genomic region. Yet, the chromosomal localization of these BAC clones is unknown.

The cDNA of POU5F1 gene and its pseudogene share a
99% overall sequence identity [see Additional file 1].
Sequence analysis revealed that there is an eight nucleotide deletion in the pseudogene in position 796 bp from
the initial ATG that causes a frameshift in the sequence.
This results the encoding of a 162amino acid-long truncated protein instead of the 360 amino acid-long functional protein. This truncated form lacks the functional
POU domain, but still has a 92% similarity on amino acid
level until the frameshift caused STOP codon. The
sequence of the pseudogene is referred as EU191070.

Expressional analysis of rabbit POU5F1 promoter region in mouse ES cells
Figure 3
Expressional analysis of rabbit POU5F1 promoter region in mouse ES cells. A. Schematic view of different constructs
used in the assay. B. Fluorescent activity was measured 72 hours post-nucleofection. Data was normalised with the auto-fluorescence of untreated R1 ESCs. CR1, the minimal promoter showed a weak level of basic expression in the mouse ESCs.
When the proximal enhancer fragment (CR2 and CR3) was part of the regulator region the expression showed no significant
change. However, when the vector containing the distal enhancer region (CR4) was co-transfected either with the minimal
promoter (CR1) or with the minimal promoter and proximal enhancers (CR1+(CR2 and CR3), the expression level increased
significantly. While the entire regulatory region (CR1+(CR2 and CR3)+CR4) was transfected, the expression peaked to its
highest level. If compared to the Oct4-GiP cells containing the mouse CR4+CR1 region, no significant differences were found
[20]. S.E. ± values are marked on each column. Different letters mark significant differences between values (P < 0.05).

Furthermore, to test whether the pseudogene was retrotransposed back near to a functioning promoter, we examined its expression using pseudogene-specific primers in
RT-qPCR experiment. The analysis showed that the pseudogene is not expressing at any preimplantation developmental-stages in rabbit [see Additional file 1].

various species (rabbit and its murine, human, bovine
and dog counterparts). As in other species, POU5F1 was
mapped to the MHC region, and contained 5 exons with
a longer first intron and 3' UTR. The putative protein
sequence is almost identical with that of other species.
This indicates the highly conserved role of POU5F1 in
early vertebrate development.

Discussion
This is the first study describing the cloning and the analysis of the complete regulatory region of the rabbit
POU5F1 gene. We have also cloned the rabbit Pou5f1
cDNA and analyzed the expression pattern in preimplantation-stage embryos. In addition, we identified a processed pseudogene, having a high degree of similarity.
Our results demonstrate that both the gene structure and
the sequence of POU5F1 are extremely conserved among

In our study, the 2.2 kb fragment of the rabbit POU5F1
upstream region was isolated and aligned to its orthologues (Figure 1; GenBank: EU189135). Comparing the 5'
region of human, bovine, mouse and dog POU5F1
sequences to the rabbit, all the functionally important
regions could be unquestionably defined within 3 kb
upstream of its transcription start site. In comparison to
the mouse, the rabbit sequence lacks large intersections
between CR1 and CR2 regions, but the functional regions

in all the four species were almost identical. Several conserved repetitive sequences, E-boxes, the binding site of
Pem, Pax-3 and Sp1 transcription factors [26] were identified. Furthermore, the HRE binding site was also identified which was shown previously to be important in RAinduced POU5F1 down regulation. The newly identified
CCC(A/T)CCC motifs that we have identified only in rabbit might gain importance when studying the differences
of POU5F1 gene regulation in mammalian species.
The CR4 region is of particular interest for pluripotent
stem cell research [21], because this region is responsible
for the POU5F1 expression in ESCs [2]. Previously, the
extended comparative sequence analysis of other mammals (pig, dog, rat) clearly showed three highly consensus
sites inside the CR4 region [27]. In rabbit, all three
sequences are identical; this suggests the functional significance and a highly conserved regulatory role in mammals. Using comparative sequence analysis we observed
that the rabbit and the human POU5F1 regulatory regions
share the greatest homology among the investigated four
species.
Our functional assessment studies on mouse ESCs verified
the sequence analysis results. In our experiments the rabbit CR4 region containing the promoter fragments
showed the highest expression level in mouse ESCs. This
suggests that the rabbit CR4 promoter region confer the
same transcriptional regulation activity as the mouse CR4
sequence in mouse ESCs. Also, the rabbit construct
showed no significant difference in expression intensity
compared to the mouse POU5F1 promoter (Oct4-GiP).
The quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that there is a
high level of maternal origin POU5F1 mRNA in oocytes
and zygotes, which decreased gradually until 8 to 16-cell
stage. The transiently reduced transcript levels increased
continuously after the embryonic genome activation (Figure 4b). These data are in agreement with the measured
(Figure 4a) and published gene expression patterns of
mouse [28]. However, since the embryo genome activation in rabbit starts later than in mouse, a difference in the
timing of endogenous POU5F1 expressions was detected
between mouse and rabbit.
In mouse, the expression becomes confined to the ICM
following the morula stage, up-regulated in the primitive
ectoderm, and eventually becomes confined to primordial germ cells [2]. In rabbit, we found that the POU5F1
was expressed in both the trophoblast and the ICM at the
mRNA level. In bovine, porcine, rhesus monkey and
human preimplantation stage embryos the POU5F1 protein was also localized in both cell types [3-6]. In bovine
the presence of POU5F1 protein in trophoblast cells
might act as a suppressor of extraembryonic lineage-spe-

cific gene expression during the preimplantation development which allows an extensive proliferation of the
trophoblast before the implantation [4,29]. These results
indicate that the restriction of expression in blastocyst
stage is species-specific [3].
Finally, we have identified a processed, retrotransposed
pseudogene of the rabbit POU5F1. Retrotransposed genes
are generated from mRNA and they integrate back to the
genome after reverse transcription. Due to this process,
these kinds of pseudogenes usually lack a functioning promoter, or endure some modification, which make them
unable to code the functional or full-length proteins. Here
we confirmed that the newly identified rabbit POU5F1
pseudogene was not expressed during rabbit preimplantation development. Further studies will be needed to clarify its expression in further developmental stages and in
differentiated tissues as some pseudogenes are known to
possess certain regulatory roles [30-32]. Bioinformatics
analysis revealed that retrotransposition frequency of
ESC-specific genes appears far to exceed that of non-ESC
specific genes, and multiple highly homologous pseudogenes likely exist for all of the ESC-specific genes [33,34].
This is a characteristic of human [35] and also of mouse
[1,36,37]. It is not clear yet whether this abundant presence of pluripotency pseudogenes in mouse and human
would be also an indication of unknown functions. In
human the POU5F1P1 pseudogene encodes a putative
protein similar to POU5F1 isoform 1, which is localized
close to the amplified region of a variety of human malignancies [38]. Recent reports on human POU5F1 pseudogenes suggested - especially in somatic cells, tissue-specific
stem cells, and non-germ cell tumours - that some re-evaluation of expression data on POU5F1 might be needed
due to the use of primers which cannot distinguish pseudogenes from the coding one [39-41]. In other species including the mouse and rabbit - the functional relevance
of pseudogenes of POU5F1 is still uncovered.

Conclusion
This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of
rabbit POU5F1 regulatory domains. Detailed sequence
analysis of the isolated rabbit POU5F1 promoter revealed
high sequence conservation in the identified enhancer
domains. The strong conservation of regulatory domain
sequences shows the importance of the control of
POU5F1 expression in early mammalian development.
We have shown that the highest homology of enhancers
can be identified between human and rabbit. This may
increase the importance to use the rabbit as a comparative
functional genomics tool for human medical research.

The animal experiments were executed in full compliance
with European and Hungarian laws and regulations, and
were approved by the Agricultural Biotechnology Center,
Animal Experimentation Committee, Gödöllö, Hungary.
Rabbit BAC library
From a rabbit genomic BAC library [19] four BAC clones
were isolated (LBAB-841A3; LBAB-85810; LBAB-304A07
and LBAB-779H10). The clones are stored at the INRA
resource centre [42]. The library screening was performed
as reported previously [19].
Cloning and sequencing
The obtained PCR fragments were cloned into pCR2.1TOPO vector. BAC clones and plasmid DNAs were purified by QIAGEN Plasmid Maxi Kit and QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit, respectively (QIAGEN). Sequencing was
performed in the ABC Sequencing Laboratory with
Applied Biosystems BigDye v3.1 Ready Reaction Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (ABI) using the ABI PRISM 3100
Genetic Analyser automated nucleotide sequencer.

The genomic sequence of Oryctolagus cuniculus 5' regulatory region of POU5F1 gene is deposited at the GenBank
under accession number [EU189135].
Comparative genomics
The POU5F1 sequence was submitted and referred as
[GenBank: EF062856] for cDNA, and as [GenBank:
EF194086] for genomic sequence. For multiple alignments the following genomic, cDNA and protein
sequences were used: [GenBank: NT_007592.14], [GenBank: NM_002701.4], [GenBank: NP_002692.2] for
[GenBank:
human;
[GenBank:
MGI_101893],
NM_013633.2], [GenBank: NP_038661.2] for mouse;
[GenBank:
and
[GenBank:
NW_001494164.1],
NM_174580.1], [GenBank: NP_777005.1] for bovine,
respectively.

For the comparative analysis the POU5F1 5' upstream
sequences of mouse [GenBank: NT_039649.7], human
[GenBank: NT_007592.14g] bovine [GenBankAF022986]
and dog [GenBank: NC_006594.2] sequences were
aligned by using ClustalW2 program [43]. Pairwise comparison of nucleotide sequences was performed on
EMBOSS Pairwise Alignment Algorithms program [44].
RACE-PCR
Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. As
outer primers oct4-5UTR and oligo(dT) primers were
used, while oct4-435 and oct4-186 primers were applied
as inner, gene-specific primers (Table 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/88

Sample materials
All samples were isolated from Hycole Hybrid rabbits.
Oocytes were collected 16 hours post-hCG injection,
while one-cell stage embryos were collected 18 hours
post-hCG injection from adult female rabbits. Zygotes
were cultivated in EBSS media [45] at 38.5°C under 5%
CO2 in air. After removing the zona pellucida with Pronase
(Sigma), samples were collected in each developmental
stage and kept frozen at -86°C until use. ICM and trophoblast samples from blastocyst were separated using
the XYClone laser system (Hamilton Thorne Biosciences)
[46]. Briefly, a blastocyst held by two large bore capillaries
at the trophoblast region and at the ICM region, respectively, was gently pulled apart while exposed to laser
pulses at the area of the trophoblast adjacent to the ICM.
When the laser pulses cut through the cells, the two separated parts of the blastocyst were stored separately for further analyses. Due to the visually controlled nature of the
procedure, the trophoblast sample is guaranteed to be
ICM-cell free, however, the ICM sample might contain a
small number of trophoblast cells. Mouse oocytes and in
vivo embryo samples were collected as described earlier
[47].
Functional analysis of the POU5F1 promoter
The conserved regions of the POU5F1 promoter were
identified by multiple sequence alignments, amplified
with PCR (Table 1) and subcloned into the pGlow TOPO®
TA Expression Kit, containing the GFP reporter gene. The
start codon of translation was mutated with PCR-based
ATG-mutagenesis (Table 1).

The constructs were nucleofected into mouse R1 ESC by
using the AMAXA Nucleofector System and Mouse ES cell
Nucleofector Kit (Amaxa Biosystems). Electroporation
was carried out based on the manufacturer's protocol
using program no. A23. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were used for
the nucleofection and about 5 μg of plasmid DNA were
applied, after copy number normalization of the different
constructs. Neomycin selection was started 24 hours postnucleofection by applying 400 μg/ml G418 on the cultures. For transfection control the Amaxa Nucleofector Kit
control vector pmaxGFP was used.
The R1 ESC line [48] (provided by Dr. Andras Nagy; Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Canada) was
cultured using standard protocols [49]. Oct4-GiP transgenic mouse ESC line, expressing the EGFP reporter gene
under the control of mouse POU5F1 [CR4+CR1] promoter region was kindly provided by Dr. Austin Smith
(University of Edinburgh's Centre for Genome Research,
Edinburgh, UK) [21]. The transgenic ubiquitin promoterGFP expressing ESC line (B6U 3) was isolated from
C57BL/6-Tg(UBC-GFP)30Scha/J transgenic mice (Stock

Fluorimetric assay
For GFP assays, cells were harvested at 72 hours posttransfection and the fluorescent intensity was measured
using the Perkin-Elmer LS-50B Luminescence Spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences Inc.;
excitation: 375 nm, detection: 510 nm). Fluorescence was
corrected for background activity shown by cells transfected with the pGlow-TOPO® vector alone. Cell number
variation between individual experiments was corrected
measuring the cell protein content (Bio-Rad DC Protein
Assay system, BioRad Laboratories).
Primer design and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis
To design POU5F1 pseudogene-specific primers, we initially performed a BLASTn [50] search to reveal any rabbit
POU5F1 pseudogene sequence up to date. This led to the
only pseudogene sequence referred EU191070. Based on
the sequence alignment of the POU5F1 mRNA and its
pseudogene [see Additional file 1], we designed a primer
to the eight nucleotide deletion region, to avoid amplification of the POU5F1 mRNA (Table 1).

Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using the Chi-square test. P-values less
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
