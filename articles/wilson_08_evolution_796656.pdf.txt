Abstract
Background: The Sox gene family of transcriptional regulators have essential roles during
development and have been extensively studied in vertebrates. The mouse, human and fugu
genomes contain at least 20 Sox genes, which are subdivided into groups based on sequence
similarity of the highly conserved HMG domain. In the well-studied insect Drosophila melanogaster,
eight Sox genes have been identified and are involved in processes such as neurogenesis, dorsalventral patterning and segmentation.
Results: We examined the available genome sequences of Apis mellifera, Nasonia vitripennis,
Tribolium castaneum, Anopheles gambiae and identified Sox family members which were classified by
phylogenetics using the HMG domains. Using in situ hybridisation we determined the expression
patterns of eight honeybee Sox genes in honeybee embryo, adult brain and queen ovary. AmSoxB
group genes were expressed in the nervous system, brain and Malphigian tubules. The restricted
localization of AmSox21b and AmSoxB1 mRNAs within the oocyte, suggested a role in, or that they
are regulated by, dorsal-ventral patterning. AmSoxC, D and F were expressed ubiquitously in late
embryos and in the follicle cells of the queen ovary. Expression of AmSoxF and two AmSoxE genes
was detected in the drone testis.
Conclusion: Insect genomes contain between eight and nine Sox genes, with at least four members
belonging to Sox group B and other Sox subgroups each being represented by a single Sox gene.
Hymenopteran insects have an additional SoxE gene, which may have arisen by gene duplication.
Expression analyses of honeybee SoxB genes implies that this group of genes may be able to rapidly
evolve new functions and expression domains, while the combined expression pattern of all the
SoxB genes is maintained.

Background
The SOX gene family is a group of related transcription
factors that play critical roles in embryonic development.
This family was originally identified in mammals based
on sequence similarity to SRY, the sex-determining region
Y chromosome [1]. SOX proteins regulate gene expression
by binding to DNA via a conserved DNA binding domain,

the HMG (high mobility group) box (reviewed in [2]).
Phylogenetic studies have determined that SOX family
members segregate into ten groups (named A-J) on the
basis of sequence similarities within the HMG box [3-5],
with many groups containing multiple members from the
same organism with related gene function. Human and
mouse genomes each encode 20 Sox genes [3,6] and anal-

ysis of the genomes of many model organisms including
chicken, Drosophila, Xenopus and Zebrafish reveal that the
Sox gene family is conserved between animal phyla.
Recently Sox genes have been identified in the genomes of
the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, ctenophores, and the
sponge species Reniera indicating these are ancestral animal genes [7-9]. In vertebrates, SOX proteins have been
shown to have essential roles in the formation of many
body systems including the central nervous system, eye
and heart development, bone cartilage, vasculature, sex
determination and testis development [10-14]. Molecular
and biochemical studies have shown that SOX proteins
regulate cell fate and differentiation during development.
Mutations in Sox genes have been shown to be the underlying cause of a number of human disorders and Sox genes
are expressed during cancer progression [12,15-18].

genes during honeybee embryogenesis and development,
about which little is known despite the importance of the
honeybee both scientifically and economically. Given the
wide range of organ systems in which Sox genes are
expressed, we aimed to identify and examine the expression of honeybee Sox genes. We identified nine Sox genes
and used in situ hybridisation and RT-PCR to determine
their expression patterns in the honeybee embryo, ovary
and adult brain.

Results

Recent whole-genome sequencing projects for Apis mellifera (the honeybee), Nasonia vitripennis (a parasitic wasp),
Tribolium castaneum (the red flour beetle) and Anopheles
gambiae (the malaria mosquito) have been completed or
are near completion [8,9,29-32] allowing the identification and classification of the complete complement of a
gene family from several holometabolous insects. Here we
identify Sox gene family members in the genomes of these
insects and examine their relationship through phylogenetics. Additionally, we study the expression of the honeybee Sox genes by in situ hybridisation and RT-PCR.

Identification and relationships of insect Sox genes
BLAST searches [38] of the honeybee genome sequence
with the SOX HMG box consensus sequence identified
nine regions that encode homology to SOX proteins. We
designated the genes encoding this homology AmSox.
Each predicted AmSox gene was examined for the presence
of a single HMG box and the sequence motif, RPMNAFMVW, conserved in all known SOX genes [3], to confirm that they were members of the SOX family of HMG
transcription factors. The SOX family is subdivided into
groups (A-J) based on phylogenetic comparisons [3]. Phylogenetic analysis of HMG domains from each predicted
AmSOX protein placed them into groups B through F (Fig.
1). This allowed us to name AmSox genes based on their
placement within each SOX groups. The honeybee
genome has four group B Sox genes, two group E genes
and one Sox gene for each of groups C, D and F. This data
supports the notion that the major groups of Sox genes
predate the separation of the lineages leading to Arthropods and vertebrates, as these groups exist in both lineages. Included in the tree as Sox gene sequences from a
non-vertebrate deuterostome, the sea urchin Strongylocentrus purpuratus, and a lophotrochozoan, the annelid
Capitella sp I. Examination of these genomes indicates that
the different Sox gene classes are all present, in one copy,
in these genomes. The only exception is that the sea
urchin genome does not appear to contain a SoxE gene. As
this class of Sox genes is found in diploblasts and all other
metazoans, this must represent loss of this gene from the
lineage leading to Strongylocentrus. SOX groups B-F are
also found in the Nematostella, ctenophore and sponge
genomes [7,8], indicating that the major groups of Sox
genes predate the emergence of triploblastic animals.

An advanced social insect, the honeybee is fast becoming
an important model organism for the study of behaviour,
longevity, learning and memory, immunity, polyphenisms, evolution and development. Recently the honeybee
genome has been sequenced [29] and analysis of developmental genes has revealed that some early acting developmental genes are absent [33]. Furthermore, the
development of molecular techniques including in situ
hybridisation and RNA interference (RNAi) [34-37] allow
us to examine gene expression and the biological role of

To extend our analysis of insect Sox genes, we searched the
publicly available insect genome projects for predicted
SOX protein sequences. Eight Sox genes were identified in
Anopheles gambiae and nine in both Tribolium castaneum
and Nasonia vitripennis (Fig. 2A). In Drosophila, three SoxB
genes are clustered within an 80 kb region, while SoxB1
(SoxNeuro) is located on a separate chromosome [20].
Similar arrangements are found in honeybees, Anopheles
[20], Nasonia and Tribolium (Fig. 2B). Tribolium has five
SoxB genes, four of which are clustered within a 90 kb

In the arthropod model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, eight Sox genes have been identified and their
expression patterns determined [19,20]. Drosophila Sox
genes are expressed in the brain, developing eye, hindgut,
nervous system and testes. Group B SOX proteins are
present in the developing Drosophila central nervous system (CNS), and also in the CNS of vertebrates, implying
that some Sox genes maintain a conserved role throughout evolution [19,21]. The phenotypes of Drosophila Sox
gene mutants indicate that Sox genes are involved in dorsal-ventral patterning, segmentation and neurogenesis
[22-28]. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the
SOX family is an evolutionally conserved group of proteins essential for development. In insects, however, only
the Sox genes from Drosophila have been characterised.

region of the genome. In the honeybee and Nasonia there
are large intergenic regions between each neighbouring
SoxB gene and there are several predicted ORFs between

NvSox21b and NvSoxB2 (Fig. 2B), suggesting they are
unlikely to be co-regulated. In all cases, the SoxB1/Neuro
orthologue is located in a different region of the genome.

This confirms, as shown by [20], that there is an evolutionary conserved organisation of SoxB group genes
between holometabolous insects, where at least three
SoxB genes are located together in insect genomes (Fig.
2B).

mRNA becomes localised to the dorsal surface (Fig. 4A
and 4B). This expression pattern continues throughout
oogenesis and AmSoxB1 mRNA is also detected on the
dorsal surface of early (newly laid) embryos (data not
shown).

In insects much of the diversity in Sox genes is found
within the SoxB clade. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate
that this clade is split into four groups (Fig. 2A), but that
the details of the groupings are not well-resolved, due in
part to the high sequence similarity of the HMG domains,
and sequence divergence between SOX proteins outside of
this domain. The SOX21/Dichaete clade is unresolved,
but separate from the rest of the SOXB proteins. SOX21b
proteins form a separate clade, as do the SOX21/Neuro
orthologues. The SOXB2/21a clade is less well defined,
with Drosophila SOX21a proteins being significantly different from SOXB2, perhaps indicating rapid evolution of
these proteins in the lineage leading to Diptera.

During embryo development, AmSoxB1 is expressed along
ventral gastrulation folds of stage 6 embryos (Fig. 4C),
and in the procephalic neurogenic region. After gastrulation, AmSoxB1 expression continues in neuroblasts that
arise from neuroectoderm along the ventral midline (Fig.
4E). At later stages these AmSoxB1-positive cells migrate to
lateral positions along the ventral axis to differentiate and
take up positions within the CNS. Strong expression of
AmSoxB1 is also found in neurons of embryonic brain
cephalic lobes. This expression continues in the brain of
the adult worker honeybee, where AmSoxB1 continues to
be expressed in Kenyon cells in each calyx of the mushroom bodies (data not shown), the key region of the honeybee brain required for sensory processing and memory
formation.

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that honeybee and Nasonia both have one additional Sox group E gene compared
to Drosophila, which has only one, DmSox100b (Fig. 2A).
This additional SOXE protein seems likely to have arisen
by gene duplication as both pairs of genes share a similar
exon structure and appear to share a common promoter
region (Fig 3A). This duplication must have occurred in an
ancestor of hymenopteran insects before the split of Nasonia and Apis. Sequence analyses using full-length protein
sequences revealed that invertebrate SOXE proteins form
a clade separate to vertebrate SOXE proteins, and they are
most closely related to the vertebrate SOXE protein, SOX8
(Fig 3B).
The phylogenetic analysis demonstrates the evolutionary
stability of the Sox gene complement in insect evolution.
The major amount of diversification in sequence appears
in the SoxB group and in the duplication of the SoxE
genes, that is seen only in hymenoptera. Given the stability in sequence we examined the expression of these genes
in honeybees to determine if sequence stability is
matched with constancy of predicted function.

AmSoxB2 expression is first detected in a group of cells at
stage 8 in posterior region of the embryo, where the Malpighian tubules begin to form (Fig. 5A). This expression
pattern is maintained in these tubules at later stages (Fig.
5B). AmSOXB2 is likely to have a role in the development
of Malpighian tubules in the honeybee, which are essential for the removal of waste products and osmoregulation.
AmSox21b mRNA was detected in late embryos, in the
CNS in paired/segmented ganglia on either side of the
ventral nerve cord. Expression was also detected in the
embryonic brain, intercalary head region and mandibles
(Fig. 5C and 5D) and in the mushroom bodies of the
adult worker brain (Fig. 5F). Strong AmSox21b expression
is detected at the ventral tip of the developing mandible,
implying that it may play a role in dorsal-ventral patterning of this appendage. In queen ovarioles, AmSox21b is
strongly expressed by the nurse cells and its mRNA present
in the oocyte, localized to both dorsal and ventral surfaces
of the egg (Fig. 5E).

The expression patterns of SoxB group genes in the
honeybee
Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the honeybee genome
contains four group B Sox genes. These were also identified by McKimmie et al., [20], who investigated the
genomic organisation of group SoxB genes in insects. We
examined the expression patterns of these Sox genes in the
queen ovariole, honeybee worker embryos and adult
brains.

During late honeybee embryogenesis, the expression patterns of AmSoxB1 and AmSox21b group B genes do not
overlap in the CNS (Figs 4F and 5C). These genes appear
to be expressed in different neuronal cells along the ventral midline, implying that they play separate roles in the
developing ÃNS. In the embryonic and adult brain, however, AmSoxB1 and AmSox21b are both expressed by the
Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies.

AmSoxB1 is strongly expressed by the nurse cells closest to
the oocyte in the queen ovariole. In the oocyte, AmSoxB1

No expression was detected for AmSox21 by in situ hybridisation in honeybee embryos, queen ovaries or adult

worker brains. AmSox21 is encoded by a single exon, making RT-PCR analysis of expression challenging, as RT-PCR
analysis detects amplification from embryo cDNA but this
is also seen in the control reaction in the absence of
reverse transcriptase, indicating this band is most likely to
be the result of genomic DNA contamination (Fig. 7).
While previous studies [20] have identified AmSox21 in a
brain EST library, an overlapping probe used in this study
did not detect any expression. As AmSox21 expression is
undetectable by RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation under
our experimental conditions, we suggest that AmSox21
could be an inactive pseudogene. This implies the previously identified EST may be the result of genomic contamination.

AmSoxC, AmSoxD and AmSoxF were all expressed by nurse

ubiquitously throughout late stage embryos (Fig. 6B),
although AmSoxC expression was slightly higher in the
embryonic brain (Fig. 6C). AmSoxC and AmSoxD were
also expressed by the Kenyon cells in the calyces of the
mushroom bodies (MB) (Fig. 6D),.

SoxE group honeybee orthologues are upregulated in the
drone testis
As SOX proteins play key roles in gonad differentiation,
we used RT-PCR to determine if the honeybee Sox genes
were also expressed in the testis of the drone (Fig. 7). RNA
was isolated from the testis of drone pupa, as the adult
drone testis degenerates shortly after emergence [39].
Strong expression of AmSoxE1, AmSoxE2 and AmSoxF was
detected in testis and weak expression of AmSox21b (Fig.
7). AmSoxF was also expressed in queen ovaries (Fig. 6A)
but only AmSoxE group gene expression appears to be testis-specific. No expression was detected in queen ovaries
and only weak ubiquitous expression was found in late
stage worker embryos.

Discussion
We identified nine Sox genes in the honeybee genome,
eight in Tribolium, seven in Nasonia and eight in Anopheles.
Vertebrate genomes contain a much larger number of Sox

genes; humans and mice have 20 Sox genes and fugu has
24 [6,40], with multiple Sox genes represented in each
grouping, exhibiting overlapping expression patterns and
functions. By contrast invertebrate deuterostome, ecdysozoan and lophotrochozoan genomes contain fewer Sox
genes (8â9) and, apart from group B, only a single Sox
gene represents most Sox groups. This is consistent with
the hypothesis that the ancestral vertebrate genome
underwent genome duplication(s) [41]. Non- bilaterian
metazoa contain considerably more Sox genes [7,8] indicating Sox gene loss has been important in the evolution
of the bilateria. While the HMG domain sequences of Sox
group genes suggests that these genes are conserved, their
expression when compared between Drosophila and honeybee indicates that these genes are evolving novel expression patterns and thus functions. Sox gene expression in
Drosophila, Apis and vertebrates is summarised in Table 1.

Expression and evolution of SoxB genes
The general features of group B gene expression are conserved for the honeybee, as their expression patterns suggest roles in neurogenesis and dorsal-ventral patterning.
However, orthology based on phylogenetic evidence does
not predict the expression pattern of an individual gene.
Despite conservation in genomic organisation and
sequence in insects [20], expression of the individual SoxB
genes has changed considerably through the evolution of
insects.

None of the AmSox B group genes show identical expression patterns to any of their orthologous DmSox B genes.
For example, the AmSox21b expression pattern in the CNS
is different to that of DmSox21b, which is expressed in
abdominal epidermal stripes. AmSoxB1 expression pattern overlaps with both DmSoxB1 and DmDichaete
(DmSoxB2.1) expression patterns. No expression was
detected for AmSox21, which had been suggested to be a
orthologue of DmDichaete by McKimmie et al. [20] based
on phylogenetics and genome position, and is Dichaete's
nearest neighbour in our phylogenetic analysis.

Recently, in Drosophila, examination of a DmDichaete
(DmSoxB2.1) loss of function mutant found that Dichaete
influenced dorsal-ventral patterning [23]. Mutant eggs
had defects in Gurken-dependent formation of dorsal
appendages and differentiation of dorsal/anterior follicle
cells. Additionally, in zebrafish, both knock-down and
ectopic expression of the SOX protein SOX21a indicates
that it acts in dorsal-ventral patterning [42]. In the honeybee, two Sox genes appear to have a role in, or a regulated
by, dorsal-ventral patterning. AmSoxB1 mRNA is localized
to the dorsal surface of the oocyte and AmSox21b mRNA is
localized to both the dorsal and ventral surface of the
oocyte. As mRNA localization plays a critical part in axis
specification in other insects [43,44], it is likely that these
AmSox genes have roles in dorsal-ventral patterning in the
oocyte and they may have overlapping functions. It is currently unknown how axes are specified in the honeybee
oocyte and early embryo, as the honeybee genome is
missing several key genes essential for axis organisation in
Drosophila [33]. While these expression patterns suggest a
conserved role for SOX group B proteins in dorsal-ventral
patterning, the actual SoxB genes involved are not orthologous. The direct orthologue of DmDichaete, according to
our phylogenetic analysis (and that of [20]) is AmSox21,

its co-option into a possible role in Malphigian tubule formation.
Other Sox genes
AmSoxC, AmSoxD and AmSoxF were expressed throughout
late stage embryos. The Drosophila orthologue for SoxC is
also ubiquitously expressed [19,46], although SoxD and
SoxF orthologues show specific nervous system expression. Vertebrate SoxD orthologues are expressed broadly
in embryonic tissues [47] and more specifically in bone
and pancreas.

There is little conservation in expression of SOXF group
members between species. Vertebrate SoxF family members are involved in a range of activities including endoderm specification, blood and hair follicle development.
DmSoxF is found in the peripheral nervous system [19]
whereas C. elegans does not have a SoxF group gene [3].
Drosophila DmSox100b is expressed in gonadal mesoderm
and its expression becomes male-specific after stage 15
but it is also expressed in other tissues including the alimentary canal, intestinal cells and Malpighian tubules
[45,48]. Upregulation of AmSOXE proteins solely in the
drone testis implies that they may play a specific role in
honeybee testis differentiation. Group F SOX proteins, a
group closely related to SOXE proteins (Fig. 1), are also
expressed in both testis and ovaries in other species
including the eel [49] and human (sox17; [50]), indicating
that SOXF proteins play a conserved evolutionary role in
both male and female gonads.

reverse transcriptase added to the cDNA synthesis) was performed for each set of oligonucleotide pairs to detect contamination from genomic DNA. Abbreviations: Embryo (E),

which has no expression in the oocyte, while the honeybee orthologues of zebrafish Sox21a are AmSoxB2 and
AmSox21a.
We have also found a novel expression pattern for a group
B SOX protein, AmSOXB2, in the formation of the Malpighian tubules. The Drosophila group E SOX protein
(DmSox100b) is also expressed in Malpighian tubules,
while SOX proteins in mammals are expressed in analogous tissues, the foetal kidneys [45]. AmSOXB2 sequence
is highly divergent outside of the HMG box[20] perhaps
reflecting different selective pressure on its sequence due

Sequence analyses revealed the honeybee and Nasonia
genomes encode two SoxE group members where-as there
is only one in Drosophila (DmSox100b) and none in C. elegans [3]. Expression of both AmSoxE genes was upregulated in the testis of honeybee drones, suggesting they play
a role in testicular development. SOXE group proteins are
expressed during testis determination in many species
[48,51-53]. Sequences outside of the HMG domains of
SOXE1 and SOXE2 show little similarity. These sequence
changes may have been necessary for interactions with
other testis-related factors. Non-HMG domain sequences
can play a role in protein partner selection between different SOX groups but SOX proteins within the same subgroup often interact with the same protein partners
despite having sequences that are different outside of the
HMG domain [54].

Conclusion
We identified and classified Sox genes in the genomes of
Apis mellifera, Nasonia and Tribolium and examined the
expression patterns of eight honeybee Sox genes by in situ
hybridisation. The expression patterns of honeybee Sox
genes confirm that members of this family are likely to

Sox genes in the honeybee.

dicted during the genome assembly using sets of reference
sequences (including Drosophila) to help identify transcripts. Insect Sox genes were named based on their placement within each SOX groups (see Additional file 4 for
Genebank accession numbers).

Methods
Phylogenetics
SOX homologues were identified in insect genome
sequences using tBlastN searches [38]. Each putative
AmSOX protein was analysed for the presence of a
sequence motif RPMNAFMVW located within the HMG
box which is conserved for all SOX sequences [3], confirming that those genes identified were members of the
SOX group of HMG domain transcription factors. Multiple alignments of honeybee SOX HMG sequences with
SOX domains from other species were carried out in ClustalX (see Additional files 1, 2 and 3). For Figure 1 the multiple alignment was analysed using MrBAYES 3.1.2.[55]
under the WAG model[56] with default priors. The WAG
model was chosen as the most appropriate model of
amino-acid substitution after preliminary analysis using
MrBAYES with mixed models. The Monte Carlo Markov
Chain search was run with four chains over 1500000 generations with trees sampled every 1000 generations. The
first 375000 trees were discarded as 'burn-in'. The trees in
figures 2 and 3 were constructed using the PHYLIP[57]
package of programs from alignments bootstrapped using
SEQBOOT. Maximum Likelihood trees were estimated
using PROTML and majority-rule consensus trees derived
using CONSENSE. Dendrograms were displayed using
TreeViewPPC [58] or Dendroscope [59].

Genome sequence information for insects and other species was retrieved from their genome project websites
[[32,61-63] and [64]]. Exon/intron gene structure was
predicted by either Genemachine [65] or was already pre-

Isolation of AmSox gene probes
Total RNA was extracted from Honeybee embryos or testis
dissected from drone pupa using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) and cDNA was produced using Superscript II
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). AmSox gene fragments
were amplified by RT-PCR from embryo cDNA using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to non-HMG box
encoding regions from the coding sequence of each predicted AmSox gene. Oligonucleotide primers used were:

DNA fragments were then cloned into the pGEM-T Easy
vector (Promega). The sequence and orientation of each
cloned gene fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
In situ hybridization
Honeybee embryos were collected and fixed as described
[34]. Brains were dissected from worker honeybees, fixed
in 4% PFA overnight at 4Â°C and stored in methanol. Antisense or sense digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probes
were produced by in vitro transcription from linearized
DNA templates containing AmSox cDNA fragments. In situ
hybridization on honeybee embryos, oocytes and worker
brains were performed as described [34].
