Background: The origins of the recombination hotspots that are a common feature of both allelic
and non-allelic homologous recombination in the human genome are poorly understood. We have
investigated, by comparative sequencing, the evolution of two hotspots of non-allelic homologous
recombination on the Y chromosome that lie within paralogous sequences known to sponsor
deletions resulting in male infertility.

The pattern of meiotic homologous recombination is not
homogeneous throughout the human genome. Hotspots of
recombination activity - short genomic regions defined at the
sequence level that exhibit higher levels of recombination
than their surrounding sequence - have been identified in
both the generation of haplotypic diversity by allelic

homologous recombination (AHR) and the production of
chromosomal rearrangements by non-allelic homologous
recombination (NAHR) [1,2]. The evolution and determinants of these recombination hotspots are poorly understood.

Conclusions: Several hominid-specific gene conversion events have rendered these hotspots
better substrates for chromosomal rearrangements in humans than in chimpanzees or gorillas.
Monte Carlo simulations of sequence evolution suggest that extreme sequence divergence is a
direct consequence of gene conversion between paralogs. We propose that the coincidence of
signatures of concerted evolution and recurrent breakpoints of chromosomal rearrangement
(mapped at the sequence level) may enable the identification of putative rearrangement hotspots
from analysis of comparative sequences from great apes.

Results: These recombination hotspots are characterized by signatures of concerted evolution,
which indicate that gene conversion between paralogs has been predominant in shaping their
recent evolution. By contrast, the paralogous sequences that surround the hotspots exhibit little
evidence of gene conversion. A second feature of these rearrangement hotspots is the extreme
interspecific sequence divergence (around 2.5%) that places them among the most divergent
orthologous sequences between humans and chimpanzees.

phenotypes known collectively as 'genomic disorders'
(reviewed in [3]). While some of these disorders result from
the intermediates of NAHR being resolved as crossovers (that
is, rearrangements such as deletions, duplications and inversions), others arise from the same intermediates being
resolved as gene conversion events. Gene conversion is the
non-reciprocal exchange of sequence between homologous
sequences. Genomic disorders can arise when a gene conversion introduces a deleterious mutation into a functional gene,
often from a reservoir of mutations present within a pseudogene. The results of NAHR need not be pathogenic, but can
result in structural polymorphism (for example, the Yp paracentric inversion [4]). Similarly, gene conversion is capable of
homogenizing both allelic and non-allelic (paralogous)
sequences with no deleterious consequences.

is to their ortholog in a closely related species. In principle,
two different mechanisms can cause concerted evolution:
gene conversion or unequal crossing over within a tandem
array of repeats.
To investigate the role of gene conversion in the evolution of
NAHR hotspots it is necessary to carry out comparative
sequencing of paralogs. The presence in four copies of even
minimally duplicated paralogs on autosomes complicates
comparative sequencing strategies, and so it was decided to
focus on loci on the constitutively haploid portion of the Y
chromosome.
NAHR between two paralogous HERV15 proviral sequences
(of approximately 10 kb) flanking the Y-chromosomal
Azoospermia Factor a (AZFa) locus produces deletions
causing male infertility [9,14,15]. All sequenced AZFa rearrangement breakpoints in these sequences fall within two
NAHR 'hotspots' - ID1 and ID2 - that are characterized by elevated levels of sequence similarity.

In contrast to AHR, where unknown factors maintain recombination hotspots at specific locations [5], the frequency of
NAHR is thought to be related at least in part to the sequence
identity between paralogous (duplicated) sequences [3].
Studies of pathogenic rearrangements [6] and cell-culture
assays [7,8] have demonstrated the length of sequence identity to be a primary determinant of NAHR.

In this study, comparative sequences were obtained for the
entire proximal and distal AZFa-HERVs from common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). The
evolutionary history of sequences within the two rearrangement hotspots was compared to that of the remainder of
AZFa-HERV sequences outside hotspots from the same species. Gene conversion simulations were developed to ask how
well these empirical comparisons reflect the dynamics of the
underlying gene conversion process.

It has recently been suggested that gene conversion between
paralogs may render them better substrates for NAHR as a
result of increased sequence similarity [9]. Evidence for gene
conversion between paralogs has been detected at a number
of loci known to be involved in sponsoring pathogenic chromosomal rearrangements [9-12]. If these patterns of gene
conversion are polymorphic, some individuals may manifest
increased germline rates of specific chromosomal rearrangements. Similarly, over an evolutionary timescale, gene conversion events may result in the formation of species-specific
rearrangement hotspots.

Results and discussion

We sequenced the proximal (approximately 10 kb) and distal
(approximately 12 kb) AZFa-HERVs from a male chimpanzee
(GenBank accession numbers AY573558 and AY573559) and
a male gorilla (AY573560 and AY573361). These sequences
encompass two intervals containing the NAHR hotspots ID1
and ID2 [14], in which all 15 sequenced NAHR breakpoints
have been found in humans (Figure 1, Table 1). ID1 and ID2

In evolutionary analyses, the imprint of gene conversion can
be recognized through the distinctive pattern of 'concerted
evolution' [13], whereby duplicated sequences within one
species (paralogs) are more similar to one another than either

comprise respectively 1,285 base pairs (bp) of absolute identity between paralogs and 1,690 bp containing a single 'paralogous sequence variant' (PSV). These are by far the longest
stretches of sequence identity in the AZFa-HERVs, as
revealed by the paralog similarity plot in Figure 1.

There are longer stretches of sequence identity in
humans than in chimpanzee or gorilla
Strikingly, the longest stretches of identity between AZFaHERV paralogs are much smaller in the chimpanzee and
gorilla than in humans (Figure 1b, Table 2). This finding suggests that either gene conversion has homogenized the
human AZFa-HERVs, or the human sequences have retained
longer stretches of ancestral paralog identity that have
diverged in chimpanzees and gorillas.

Detecting the signature of concerted evolution
We examined the expectation that in the presence of gene
conversion a phylogeny comprising both paralogous and
orthologous sequences should show clustering of paralogs,
whereas in its absence, orthologs should cluster. If we construct a phylogeny from concatenated AZFa-HERV
sequences excluding the two rearrangement hotspots ('NonID'), the orthologs cluster, indicating an absence of gene conversion (Figure 2a). This is possibly the result of paralog
sequence similarity being below a required threshold for the
initiation of homologous recombination. By contrast, all three
paralogous sequences cluster in the phylogeny of the
sequences of the ID1 hotspot. The ID2 phylogeny exhibits a
third topology in which the human paralogs cluster, but the
chimpanzee and gorilla paralogs do not.
An alternative phylogenetic method for exploring the impact
of gene conversion is to examine the degree to which there are
conflicting phylogenetic signals in the sequence data. If there
has been only partial gene conversion throughout an alignment, then a subset of sites at which orthologous sequences
are more similar than paralogous sequences will remain. If
these sites predominate, a phylogenetic tree will show
ortholog clustering, and the evidence of gene conversion will
have been disregarded. Split decomposition disentangles
these conflicting signals and allows the data to be displayed as
phylogenetic networks. A tree-like network will result when
no conflicting signals are apparent, but if conflicting signals
from the common ancestry of orthologs and gene conversion
between paralogs are present, four-sided cycles should
appear in the network.
Figure 2b shows phylogenetic networks for the hotspot and
non-hotspot portions of the AZFa-HERVs. The non-hotspot
portion presents a tree-like network with only slight evidence
of cycles, in which orthologs cluster together, suggesting that
there has been minimal gene conversion in these intervals. In
contrast, both ID1 and ID2 intervals present networks containing large cycles. In the case of the ID1 network, the presence of cycles despite the clustering of paralogs suggests that

while gene conversion has not eradicated all evidence of the
common ancestry of orthologs over the entire region, it nonetheless predominates in all three species. The phylogenetic
network of ID2 has substantially larger cycles than that of
ID1, which, together with the incomplete clustering of paralogs identified above, indicates that the conflicting signals of
the common ancestry of orthologs and gene conversion
between paralogs are more equally balanced in the ID2 interval. This suggests that gene conversion has been less pervasive at ID2 than at ID1. The extremely tight clustering of the
human ID2 paralogs suggest that this paucity of gene conversion is confined to chimpanzees and gorillas, and more evidence to support this hypothesis is presented later.
Conflicting phylogenetic signals from individual phylogenetically informative sites are apparent in site-by-site compatibility analyses of both ID1 (data not shown) and ID2 (Figure 2c)
alignments. The patterns of variant sites within these alignments suggest that the hotspot intervals have not been generated by single, long conversion events, but rather are
patchworks of several shorter gene conversion events of
opposing directions (proximal to distal, and distal to
proximal).
The ID1 and ID2 hotspots were sequenced in another male
chimpanzee and gorilla, and identical phylogenetic signals of
concerted evolution were obtained. Thus we can infer that
gene conversion since the human-chimp common ancestor
has homogenized these AZFa-HERVs in humans, generating
the recombinogenic intervals ID1 and ID2.

Greater sequence divergence between orthologs
within NAHR hotspots
Comparisons of sequence divergence between the different
orthologs in the three species reveal surprisingly high levels of
sequence divergence at the ID1 and ID2 hotspots (Figure 3a)
when compared to both the non-hotspot portions of the
AZFa-HERV sequences (Non-ID), and previously published
data on a single copy Y-chromosomal locus, SMCY [16,17].
For example, the Jukes-Cantor distance between human and
chimpanzee orthologs is 2.5% averaged over the ID1 and ID2
hotspots, in comparison to 1.7% for the SMCY locus and 1.8%

averaged over the Non-ID intervals. The average sequence
divergence across these NAHR hotspots is greater for all three
pairwise comparisons of hominoid species (human versus
chimpanzee, human versus gorilla and gorilla versus chimpanzee) when compared to both the non-hotspot sequences
and the SMCY locus. These latter two orthologous loci are
indistinguishable, indicating that it is not paralogy per se that
causes this elevated sequence divergence. The elevation in
sequence divergence between the orthologous hotspot
sequences is much less pronounced in comparisons between
chimpanzee and gorilla. This difference can be attributed to a
lack of elevated sequence divergence at ID2 between these
two species (Figure 3b). The sequence divergence at ID2
between chimpanzee and gorilla is statistically indistinguishable to that between the single-copy SMCY loci in the same
two species, and is substantially less than the divergence at
ID2 between human and gorilla.
Rather than dividing up the AZFa-HERV alignment on the
basis of prior information about the position of known rearrangement hotspots, it would be useful to detect regions of
concerted evolution within an alignment of duplicated
sequences in a de novo fashion. To this end, we have devised
a statistic, the concerted index (CI), which varies between 0
and 1, revealing areas of low and high concerted evolution,
respectively (see Materials and methods for details). This statistic can be calculated in sliding windows across an alignment. Applying this statistic to the AZFa-HERV sequence
alignment reveals two zones of concerted evolution within the
alignment, one containing ID1 and the other containing ID2
(Figure 4). These zones of concerted evolution contain the
regions of the AZFa-HERV alignment that exhibit elevated
sequence divergence between orthologs. The 5'-most zone
extends some distance 3' to the ID1 hotspot. This observation
accords with a recent finding that this region flanking the ID1
hotspot undergoes frequent gene conversion in humans [18],
although no rearrangement breakpoints have yet been
mapped to this conversion-only hotspot.

Simulations of the impact of gene conversion
The question arises of whether the unusual features of the
observed data can be explained solely by an underlying gene
conversion process. In addition, we are interested to explore
how various parameters of gene conversion dynamics might
affect sequence divergence among paralogs undergoing gene
conversion. Consequently, Monte Carlo simulations were
performed to explore the effect of gene conversion between
paralogs on the evolution of duplicated sequences, according
to a model shown schematically in Figure 5. Essentially, two
10-kb duplicated sequences have diverged by a specified
amount before a speciation event. After speciation, the duplicated sequences continue to diverge, but random gene conversion events occur between the paralogs within each
daughter species. These gene conversion events are restricted
to the first half of the duplicated sequence, and conversion
tract lengths are drawn from a geometric distribution, which

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/8/R55

accords well with empirical evidence [8,19,20]. The second
half of the duplicated sequence, in which no gene conversion
takes place, provides a control against which the impact of
gene conversion can be measured.

Simulating the impact of varying gene conversion rates
Figure 6 shows the effect of varying the gene conversion rate
on sequence similarity between paralogs and between
orthologs. As expected, when the rate of gene conversion is
zero, no difference can be observed in either paralog or
ortholog similarity between the two halves of the 10-kb
sequence. By contrast, the plot of paralog similarity shows
that as the rate of gene conversion increases, the first halves
of the paralogs become increasingly homogenized relative to
the second halves (which are not exposed to gene conversion
events). The plot of ortholog similarity shows that increasing
the gene conversion rate increases the sequence divergence
observed in the first half of the sequence over and above the
sequence divergence observed in the portion of the sequence
not exposed to gene conversion, despite the same rate of base
substitution in the two halves. Other parameters within this
model of gene conversion can be varied besides the gene conversion rate. Increasing the mean gene conversion tract
length has a similar effect to raising the gene conversion rate
(data not shown).
Our simulations indicate that the degree to which sequence
divergence between orthologs is exaggerated by gene conversion between paralogs depends on the amount of gene conversion (as expressed by the rate and tract length of gene
conversion events). In accordance with the results from our
simulations, the zones of concerted evolution (high CI) contain the regions of the AZFa-HERVs displaying the highest
ortholog sequence divergence. In general, it should be
expected that the sequence divergence between human and
gorilla orthologs should be similar to that between chimpanzee and gorilla orthologs at the same locus. However, this
does not seem to be the case at ID2, where, as noted above,
there appears to be less sequence divergence at ID2 between
chimpanzee and gorilla than between human and gorilla.
Thus, these differences in sequence divergence described
above could indicate an increased rate of gene conversion at
ID2 that is specific to the hominid lineage. No such effect is
observable at ID1, where there is no discernible difference in
sequence divergence between the human-gorilla and chimpanzee-gorilla comparisons. This inference of different gene
conversion rates at ID2 between humans on the one hand,
and chimpanzees and gorillas on the other, agrees with the
analysis of phylogenetic networks above, where neither nonhuman species exhibited paralog clustering in phylogenies of
ID2. Similarly, a plot of the CI in comparisons between chimpanzee and gorilla sequences shows a much narrower 3' zone
of concerted evolution, again suggesting much less gene conversion in ID2 in these two species (data not shown).

Simulating the impact of varying gene conversion

Association between an evolutionary history of gene
conversion and chromosomal rearrangement hotspots

Genome Biology 2004, 5:R55

information

Several independent analyses of our comparative sequence
data have revealed a clear history of concerted evolution
within the AZFa-HERVs. Concerted evolution is mainly confined to the two rearrangement hotspot intervals within the
AZFa-HERVs. The sequence identity that defines the ID1 and
ID2 chromosomal rearrangement hotspots has arisen since
the human-chimpanzee common ancestor as a result of several gene conversion events between proximal and distal
AZFa-HERVs. This gene conversion process appears to be

interactions

Conclusions

refereed research

Our simulations suggest that, given the same gene conversion
rate, we should observe greater ortholog sequence divergence
in portions of our AZFa-HERV alignments undergoing concerted evolution where paralog divergence at speciation was
greatest. Clearly we are unable to sequence AZFa-HERVs
from common ancestors of the species studied here. However, if we analyze portions of the AZFa-HERV alignment
between human and chimpanzee that have a high CI (greater
than 0.5) there does appear to be a strong correlation between
mean ortholog divergence and mean paralog divergence (Figure 8). It is worth remembering that at some point paralog
divergence at speciation will reach a threshold at which gene
conversion is suppressed and no elevation in ortholog divergence would be observed.

This observation from our simulations provides a means to
investigate biased gene conversion directionality in our comparative sequence data by comparing proximal and distal
orthologous divergences. In our AZFa-HERV alignments
there are no consistent differences across all pairwise comparisons in proximal versus distal ortholog sequence divergences at either ID1 or ID2 (Figure 3b). This indicates that
gene conversion at the AZFa-HERV hotspot intervals is relatively unbiased with respect to which paralog acts as the
donor sequence. This finding is supported by the observation
of bidirectional gene conversion events in the site-by-site
compatibility analysis in ID2 described above (Figure 2c). We
have developed a directionality index (DI) (see Materials and
methods for details) to allow a sliding-window approach to
detect zones of high directionality. A recent study has demonstrated the existence of a highly directional gene conversion
hotspot that lies just 3' to ID1 in humans [18]. If we scan
across the portions of the AZFa-HERV alignment with a high
CI (greater than 0.5) and calculate this DI, we do indeed pick
up an extended region of high proximal-to-distal directionality that corresponds to this conversion hotspot (Figure 4).

deposited research

Further simulations were performed to explore the effect of
introducing directionality into the gene conversion model,
whereby gene conversion is not equally probable in both
directions (proximal to distal, or distal to proximal). Figure 9
shows that although biased directionality has no effect on the
degree to which paralogs are homogenized, increasingly
biased directionality causes discrepant ortholog sequence
divergence between proximal (p1 versus p2) and distal comparisons (d1 versus d2). Smaller perturbations of sequence
divergence are observed in the preferred donor than in the
preferred acceptor.

reports

Running the simulations for different degrees of sequence
divergence between the paralogs before the speciation event
gives the results shown in Figure 7. A greater degree of
sequence divergence between the paralogs before speciation
leads to larger differentials in sequence divergence between
the two halves of the paralogs. Similarly, the plot of ortholog
similarity indicates that increasing the amount of variation
between the paralogs before speciation leads to greater
sequence divergence in the portion of the sequence undergoing gene conversion. The plot of ortholog similarity also
shows that gene conversion only exaggerates sequence divergence between orthologs when the two paralogs have
diverged before speciation. No increase in sequence divergence is observed in the portion exposed to gene conversion
processes when the two paralogs are identical before speciation. This makes intuitive sense: if paralogous sequences are
initially identical at speciation, gene conversion is dependent
on the nucleotide-substitution process to generate new variants that can be gene converted from one paralog to another.
However, the gene conversion process is equally capable of
copying a novel derived allele from one paralog to the other as
it is of reintroducing the ancestral allele from the other paralog. Therefore the rate of ortholog divergence does not differ
from the nucleotide-substitution rate. However, if paralogs
are not identical at speciation, each paralog contains a reservoir of variants that can be introduced into the other. Subsequent gene conversion events between the paralogs are more
likely to introduce new sites that differ between orthologous
sequences than they are to remove them. As a consequence,
the occurrence of independent gene conversion events in both
daughter species augments the normal nucleotide substitution process in generating sequence divergence.

unbiased with respect to which paralog acts as a donor
sequence. In addition, there is good evidence, for one of these
hotspots, of an acceleration of gene conversion in the hominid
lineage.
It is tempting to ascribe a causal relationship to this association between chromosomal rearrangement hotspots and an
evolutionary history of gene conversion. Under such a scenario, a rare gene conversion event homogenizes a small
region of the AZFa-HERVs that hence becomes a better substrate for NAHR, which leads in turn to an increased frequency of further gene conversion events and chromosomal
rearrangements. However, because gene conversion and
chromosomal rearrangement reflect the alternative products
of a common intermediate, it may be that a recombinogenic
sequence motif underpins the association, and increased
sequence identity has only a minor role in determining the
frequency of chromosomal rearrangement. A lack of association between lengths of identity and rearrangement hotspots
may also occur in recently duplicated sequences that have yet

to diverge sufficiently in their non-recombinogenic portions
for the hotspot-associated intervals of exaggerated paralog
similarity to become apparent. An association between chromosomal rearrangement hotspots and an evolutionary history of gene conversion could also break down if there are
sequence-dependent factors at NAHR hotspots which moderate the resolution of recombination intermediates such that
crossovers are preferred to gene conversion events, leading to
a higher frequency of rearrangement breakpoints within the
hotspot, but not increased gene conversion. Identifying substantial numbers of de novo rearrangements and gene conversion events in pools of sperm will allow many of these
issues to be resolved.
While our data are important for understanding the longerterm evolution of rearrangement hotspots, they are not ideal
for estimating the parameters of inter-paralog gene conversion processes (for example tract length and rate) in the
human genome. This is especially true when, as is the case
here, gene conversion does not appear to have been constant

over time, and consequently, equilibrium-based methods [12]
are inappropriate. These parameters are better estimated by
studying gene conversion over shorter timescales, either by
identifying individual gene conversion events [21] or by
studying within-population variation [18,22]. Recent investigations of inter-paralog gene conversion processes in humans
at the conversion hotspot flanking ID1 have estimated a gene
conversion rate of 0.24 - 1.3 × 10-3 events per generation and
a mean tract length of 31 bp [18]. A recent study of interallelic gene conversion events at a recombination hotspot in
sperm DNA has revealed higher rates of 5 - 16 × 10-3 events
per generation and longer mean tract lengths of 63-200 bp
[21].

Using comparative sequence analysis to identify
putative chromosomal rearrangement hotspots within
segmental duplications
There are substantial technical difficulties associated with
identifying NAHR hotspots directly from individual recombination events. However, should the association between an
evolutionary history of gene conversion and recombination
hotspot activity hold true across segmental duplications
throughout the genome, then comparative sequence analysis
seeking signatures of concerted evolution might allow the
indirect identification of rearrangement hotspots. Most of the
duplication events that generated the recombinogenic
paralogous sequences in the human genome occurred during
recent primate evolution [23], and so comparisons between
human and mouse genomes are unlikely to be informative. In
contrast, comparative sequences in great apes could facilitate
the identification of putative rearrangement hotspots within
segmental duplications through the application of the slidingwindow analyses developed here. These analyses may reveal
the presence of hotspots whose associated rearrangements
have not been observed in the clinic as a result of their incompatibility with development to term. This may help to resolve
why so few of the potentially recombinogenic segmental
duplications are known to be associated with pathogenic consequences [24]. In this regard, it is unfortunate that the
recently released draft chimpanzee genome sequence is
unlikely to provide reliable comparative sequences of segmental duplications (M.E.H., unpublished work). This is
partly due to the fact that the vast majority of paired reads in
this whole-genome shotgun project come from short insert
libraries and so do not provide sufficient positional information to assemble sequence reads to the correct copy of a segmental duplication. Further 'finished' sequences of
chimpanzee chromosomes or targeted sequencing of specific

segmental duplications will be required to conduct the de
novo searches for rearrangement hotspots envisaged above.

Gene conversion is not the only process contributing to
the homogenization of segmental duplications
The gene conversion processes described here are compatible
with a model based on the mismatch repair of relatively short
tracts of heteroduplex DNA formed during the processing of
recombination intermediates. However, gene conversion as
defined above is not the only process that can lead to homogenization of dispersed duplicated sequences. We previously
identified homogenization events between these AZFaHERVs that are incompatible with this model (Figure 10a),
and suggested a double-crossover mechanism, which might
either occur in a single meiosis, or via single unequal
crossovers in different meioses - in other words, through the
deletion of a duplicated intermediate (Figure 10b). The recent
finding of these AZFa duplicated intermediates in the general
population, and their apparent compatibility with fertility,
suggest that the latter two-step scenario is more plausible
[25]. This second mechanism for paralog homogenization has
the potential to homogenize much longer tracts of segmental
duplications than the mismatch repair-based mechanism.
Thus it appears that at least two alternative mechanisms of
paralog homogenization can operate at these AZFa-HERVs.
The same may also be true of other segmental duplications
underlying known genomic disorders where the reciprocal
duplications of pathogenic deletions can be passed on from
parent to offspring.

Consequences of inter-paralog gene conversion for
evolutionary analyses and association studies
The demonstration that gene conversion can exaggerate levels of sequence divergence over and above those observed at
non-duplicated loci in the same genome has important implications for evolutionary studies investigating variation in
mutation rates between loci. Comparisons between sequence
divergence at duplicated and non-duplicated loci are likely to
be confounded by the presence of gene conversion in the
former but not the latter. This factor may help to explain large
discrepancies between recent estimates of the male-driven
mutation rate in humans [26-30].
Against this background it is intriguing to note the recent
study identifying reduced sequence divergence within long
palindromic sequences undergoing gene conversion on the Y
chromosome [12]. These palindromes have approximately
99.97% sequence similarity and our simulations suggest that

as a consequence we should not expect gene conversion to
elevate sequence divergence. The authors of this study proposed that by reducing sequence divergence, gene conversion
might provide a means to maintain the functional integrity of
genes residing in these palindromes. The simulations
presented here indicate that gene conversion alone is unlikely

to be capable of reducing orthologous sequence divergence.
The reduction in sequence divergence is more likely to be due
to an interplay of factors. For example, if gene conversion and
base substitution were GC-biased in opposing directions,
gene conversion events might preferentially maintain the
ancestral state of a paralogous sequence variant.

Gene conversion between paralogous sequences has important consequences for the analysis of human genomic
diversity. It has recently been inferred from the preferential
mapping of dbSNP entries to segmental duplications that

some 100,000 dbSNP entries are not true single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), but are misassembled paralogous
sequence variants (PSVs) [24]. However, this assertion does

Each primate AZFa-HERV was amplified in its entirety,
either in a single amplification using primers located in
flanking single-copy sequence, or by using two overlapping
long PCR reactions, each using one internal primer and one
primer in the proximal- or distal-specific flanking sequences.
All PCR amplifications were performed using either the
DyNAzyme EXT (Finnzyme) or Expand 20 kb Plus (Roche)
long PCR kits according to the manufacturers' instructions.
Most of the sequence data was generated by shotgun sequencing these long PCR products (with more than 20× coverage)
by generating paired reads from short insert libraries [35],
that were subsequently assembled using PHRAP [36] and
viewed using GAP4 [37]. For a minority of the data, a nested
PCR strategy was used to generate shorter sequence templates from the proximal- and distal-specific AZFa-HERV
long PCR products described above. These templates were
fluorescently sequenced using primers at regular intervals
designed from the human AZFa-HERV sequences, and the
sequences assembled using either SeqEd (Applied Biosystems) or CAP (Contig Assembly Program [38]). Primer
sequences are documented in Additional data file 1. The GenBank accession numbers for the sequences generated here

The DI measures the difference between orthologous
sequence divergence at proximal and distal copies of a
duplicated sequence, as a function of the mean orthologous
sequence divergence.

Statistical analysis
Human sequences of AZFa-HERVs were extracted from finished BACs AC002992 and AC005820. Sequences were
aligned using Se-Al [39]. The alignment is documented in
Additional data file 2. Jukes-Cantor distances and neighborjoining trees were calculated using Phylip [40]. Phylogenetic
networks [41] were constructed using SplitsTree [42]. Sliding-window analyses of sequence similarities, concerted
indices and directionality indices was performed using code
written in Interactive Data Language 5.3 (Research Systems).
These sliding windows were 500 bp long and were analysed at
15 bp intervals across the alignment.
Concerted evolution can be defined as the maintenance of
homogeneity of nucleotide sequences among duplicated
sequences within a species, although the nucleotide
sequences change over time. We devised a statistic we call the
concerted index (CI) to quantify this within-species similarity
in relation to the observed variation between species. For a
given alignment of paralogous and orthologous sequences in
a pair of species, this statistic measures the ratio of the mean
distance between orthologs (DO) to the sum of the mean distance between orthologs and the mean distance between paralogs (DO + DP).
CI = DO/(DO + DP)
If Dp1p2 represents the distance between two orthologous
sequences p1 and p2 in terms of the percentage of variant
nucleotides between them, and Dp1d1 represents the distance
between two paralogous sequences p1 and d1 (using the
sequence nomenclature of paralogs and orthologs shown in
Figure 5), then the CI is calculated using the equation:

CI = ((Dp1p2 + Dd1d2 )/2)/((Dp1p2 + Dd1d2 )/2+(Dp1d1 + Dp2d2 )/2)
Consequently, when sequences are evolving in a concerted
fashion, the mean distance between orthologs is relatively
high, but the distance between paralogs is low, and the CI will
tend to 1. This statistic is extended to the current situation
where three species are represented by calculating the mean
of the CI across each of the three possible pairwise comparisons. This equation could be extended to include any model of
sequence evolution in the distance calculation. However, the
high levels of similarity between the sequences being analysed here means that any such correction has negligible
impact in this analysis.
The distribution of CI values is strongly bimodal in this analysis (data not shown), thus clearly distinguishing between
those portions of the alignment that are undergoing concerted evolution and those that are not.

DI = (Dp1p2 - Dd1d2)/((Dp1p2 + Dd1d2)/2)
Thus if there is strong proximal-to-distal directionality, the
discrepancy between proximal and distal orthologous divergences will generate a more negative DI. High distal-to-proximal directionality will generate a more positive DI and with
minimal directionality, the DI will tend towards 0.

Gene conversion simulations
Monte Carlo (stochastic) simulations were written in Interactive Data Language 5.3 (Research Systems) by M.E.H. (source
code is available in Additional data file 3). The simulation
models the post-speciation evolution of a pair of 10 kb duplicated sequences in two daughter species, for example human
and chimpanzee. A model of sequence divergence is
implemented in which each base in the four sequences is
equally mutable, and is capable of undergoing reversions and
parallel mutations. In addition, infrequent gene conversion
events between paralogs are incorporated at random, but limited to the first half of the sequences. To represent the fact
that the duplication event that generated the paralogs in the
first place must have pre-dated the speciation event, the initial sequences of the paralogs are differentiated by a specified
frequency of variant sites scattered at random (representing
an initial sequence divergence of 0 to 6%), although orthologs
in the two species are initially identical. This does not imply
that gene conversion was absent before speciation, only that
it is immaterial, given that variation between paralogs
accumulates even in the presence of gene conversion, as
homogenization is rarely perfect.
The gene conversion tract length is drawn at random from a
geometric distribution [19], which is defined by a single
parameter (φ). The probability (P) that the conversion tract
length is n nucleotides long is given by the equation:
P(n) = (1-φ)φn
The mean tract length (T) can be simply related to φ by the
equation:
T = φ/(1-φ)
For example, the value of φ determined by fitting a geometric
distribution to the meiotic gene conversion tracts observed at
the rosy locus in Drosophila melanogaster is 0.99717, which
gives a mean tract length of 352 bp [19].
This conversion tract is positioned at random within the 5 kb
portion of the duplicated sequence that is capable of undergoing gene conversion. The directionality of the gene conversion

The rate of gene conversion events (g) is defined relative to
the base substitution rate per locus, such that if g = 0.1 then a
gene conversion event between the two paralogs will occur on
average after 10 base substitutions have arisen in each
paralog. Therefore, given a base substitution rate of 4 × 10-8
per generation, a gene conversion rate of 0.1 is equivalent to
a per locus rate of 4 × 10-5 per locus per generation (which
represents a rate of 1.4 × 10-6 per site per sgeneration). After
an amount of evolutionary time equivalent to a fixed number
of generations, each simulation is halted and pairwise
sequence similarities are calculated in non-overlapping 200
bp windows across the 10 kb sequence for each pair of
orthologs and paralogs. Each simulation is replicated 1,000
times under the same parameters, and the sequence similarities for each pairwise comparison are averaged over all
replications.
