Abstract
Background: Mobile elements are involved in genomic rearrangements and virulence acquisition,
and hence, are important elements in bacterial genome evolution. The insertion of some specific
Insertion Sequences had been associated with repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) elements.
Considering that there are a sufficient number of available genomes with described REPs, and
exploiting the advantage of the traceability of transposition events in genomes, we decided to
exhaustively analyze the relationship between REP sequences and mobile elements.
Results: This global multigenome study highlights the importance of repetitive extragenic
palindromic elements as target sequences for transposases. The study is based on the analysis of
the DNA regions surrounding the 981 instances of Insertion Sequence elements with respect to
the positioning of REP sequences in the 19 available annotated microbial genomes corresponding
to species of bacteria with reported REP sequences. This analysis has allowed the detection of the
specific insertion into REP sequences for ISPsy8 in Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, ISPa11 in P.
aeruginosa PA01, ISPpu9 and ISPpu10 in P. putida KT2440, and ISRm22 and ISRm19 in Sinorhizobium
meliloti 1021 genome. Preference for insertion in extragenic spaces with REP sequences has also
been detected for ISPsy7 in P. syringae DC3000, ISRm5 in S. meliloti and ISNm1106 in Neisseria
meningitidis MC58 and Z2491 genomes. Probably, the association with REP elements that we have
detected analyzing genomes is only the tip of the iceberg, and this association could be even more
frequent in natural isolates.
Conclusion: Our findings characterize REP elements as hot spots for transposition and reinforce
the relationship between REP sequences and genomic plasticity mediated by mobile elements. In
addition, this study defines a subset of REP-recognizer transposases with high target selectivity that
can be useful in the development of new tools for genome manipulation.

Background
The term "REP sequences" encompasses repetitive and
palindromic sequences with a length between 21 and 65
bases [1] detected in the extragenic space of some bacterial
genomes. The function of REP elements is not completely

determined but there are important processes in which
REP sequences are involved. It was proposed that REP
sequences play a role as transcriptional attenuators [2]
although it was later stated that REP sequences are not
specific terminators [3]. Based on their role as mRNA staPage 1 of 12

bilizers [4], it has also been suggested that REP elements
are involved in the fine tuning of gene-expression [5]. REP
sequences are binding sites for DNA polymerase I [6], for
DNA gyrase [7], and for Integration Host Factor (IHF) [8],
all of which play a key role in bacterial DNA physiology.
There are also some cases in which REP sequences appear
as targets for transposition and recombination events. In
this sense, it has been shown that IS1397 and IS621 insert
specifically within REP sequences of Escherichia coli and
that ISKpn1 insert into REP sequences of Klebsiella pneumoniae [9-12]. REP sequences also appear at the recombination junctions of lambda bio phages [13] and
amplification of plasmid F_128 is initiated by REP-REP
recombination [14].
REP elements and binding sites for global regulators share
common features such as size, palindromic structure, and
multiple locations in the extragenic space of the genomes.
The DNA binding sites for global regulators are placed in
multiple sites along the genome, far from their corresponding genes. This fact makes it difficult to detect all the
binding sites corresponding to a global regulator without
a specific definition of their binding sequence on the
DNA. However, in the case of transposases, each DNA
binding-site is placed around the insertion point of the
mobile element. Hence, each transposition event stays
registered on the genome, allowing the tracing of the last
DNA sites bound by each transposase. Considering that
there were a sufficient number of available genomes corresponding to organisms with a described presence of
REP, and exploiting the advantage of the traceability of
transposition events in genomes, we decided to analyze
the relationship between REP sequences and mobile elements. We have carried out an exhaustive study of all the
insertion sites of mobile elements in the genomes with
REP elements. This analysis has allowed us to detect that
REP sequences are specific targets of insertion for IS elements in the genomes of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato
DC3000, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021, and a probable
association in Neisseria meningitidis MC58 and Neisseria
meningitidis Z2491.

Results
Analyzing the results obtained in our study of the association between REP sequences and mobile elements, we
have distinguished two types of associations: (i) type 1
association, in which the percentage of association is
100% and each IS copy is inserted in the same position of
a REP sequence, making it possible to define the DNA target consensus sequence (Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 2) and
(ii) type 2 association, in which the IS elements are near
to, or adjacent to REP sequences, but fragments of broken
REP sequences just flanking IS elements are not detected
(Tables 1 and 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/62

We have detected a type 1 association for ISPsy8 in P.
syringae DC3000, for ISPa11 in P. aeruginosa PA01, for
ISPpu9 and ISPpu10 in P. putida KT2440, and for ISRm22
and ISRm19 in S. meliloti 1021 genome. Figure 1 shows IS
elements flanked by the two fragments of the broken REP
sequences, and the alignments of the reconstructed REP
sequences corresponding to the insertion sites are shown
in Figure 2. In addition, the alignments of the complete
sequences of each IS element, including their flanking
regions, are in the additional material [see Additional file
1, file 2, file 3, file 4, file 5 and file 6]. Remarkably, in all
cases of type 1 association, 100% of the copies of each IS
are associated to REP (Tables 1 and 2), proving a high
selectivity for their REP sequence target. The results of this
sequence analysis allow us to affirm that REP elements are
target sequences for transposases.
There are five ISPsy8 elements in the P. syringae DC3000
genome and in all cases, their insertions were into a REP
sequence. ISPsy8 always broke the REP element at exactly
the same point of the sequence, generating a direct repeat
of three bases (Figure 1) [see Additional file 1]. A conserved arrangement that consists of a fragment of the REP
sequence, a direct repeat of three bases, the left end of the
ISPsy8, the transposase OrfA, the transposase OrfB, the
right end, the other direct repeat, and the remaining fragment of REP sequence is maintained in all ISPsy8 insertion areas (Figure 1) [see Additional file 1]. In four cases,
the broken REP elements are in the minus strand, and in
one case, the broken REP element is located in the plus
strand (Figure 1). However, in all cases, the transposase
ORFs are in the plus DNA strand [see Additional file 1].
The point of insertion within the REP element is exactly
between the bases occupying positions 32 and 33 of the
REP sequence. All these REP elements share a consensus
sequence (Figure 2) adjacent to the ISPsy8 insertion point.
A direct repeat of three base pairs, corresponding to positions 33, 34 and 35 of each broken REP sequence, is generated and appears at both extremes of the IS element
(Figure 1) [see Additional file 1]. Palindromy can probably induce REP sequences to adopt hairpin secondary
structures. Strikingly, the ISPsy8 insertion site is located
just at the symmetry axis of one of the two probable hairpin structures predicted for REP sequence of P. syringae
[5] (Figure 2) [see Additional file 1]. The allocation of
ISPsy8 into clusters of REP elements was determinant for
the detection of REP elements broken at the ISPsy8 insertion point. In four cases, ISPsy8 was inserted into a cluster
of REP sequences and in one case, it was inserted into an
isolated REP element [see Additional file 7]. When we
joined the two fragments located at both sides of ISPsy8,
the REP sequence appeared perfectly reconstructed (Figure 2) [see Additional file 1]. In the cases where the broken REP sequence formed part of a cluster, its
reconstructed sequence was very similar to the REP

sequences that shared the same orientation in the cluster
[see Additional file 8]. This was as expected considering
that each cluster used to have two differentiated types of
REP sequences [5]. This seems to support the idea that
REP sequence fragments flanking ISs do not form part of
the IS inverted repeats, but they are the fragments of the
target sequences broken by IS transposition.
In P. aeruginosa PA01, there are six copies of ISPa11, and
we found the same fragments of REP sequence flanking
each ISPa11 copy (Figure 1) [see Additional file 2]. In this
case, we defined the insertion sites that lacked the usual
direct repeats (Figure 1). The arrangement detected for
ISPsy8 was also conserved for ISPa11(Figure 1). In this
case, all broken REP sequences were in the same DNA
strand [see Additional file 2]. For ISPa11, the point of
insertion within the REP element is between the sixth and
seventh bases of the REP sequence. The shared consensus
sequence obtained reconstructing and aligning the six
broken REP sequences is displayed in Figure 2.

In P. putida KT2440, all copies of ISPpu9 and ISPpu10
were inserted into P. putida REP sequences (Figure 1) [see
Additional file 3 and file 4]. Both ISs generate direct
repeats of two base pairs at the insertion point (Figure 1).
Our data are in agreement with insertion site data previously reported [15]. It is important to note that, although
ISPpu9 and ISPpu10 sequences are not highly similar,
both are inserted exactly between the ninth and tenth
bases of the REP sequence. In addition, the insertion site
consensus sequence is extraordinarily conserved, and the
insertion site sequence is practically identical for all copies
in both ISs (Figure 2).
In S. meliloti 1021, all copies of ISRm22 were inserted into
S. meliloti REP elements (Figure 1) [see Additional file 5].
The analysis of ISRm22 flanking regions allowed us to
characterize the ISRm22 insertion sites and to describe
direct repeats of six base pairs generated at the insertion
points. There are 9 copies of ISRm22 in the S. meliloti
1021 genome but, curiously, only six copies have perfectly
conserved direct repeats at both extremes of the IS. The

three direct repeats marked with light blue background in
Figure 1 are not perfect direct repeats. From observing
their sequences, it could be the result of recombination
events between the copies. Homologous inter- or
intramolecular recombination between two IS elements,
each with a different direct repeat, would result in a hybrid
element carrying one direct repeat of each parent, and is
the case for these three ISRm22 instances [16]. Formation
of adjacent deletions resulting from duplicative intramolecular transposition could also result in a single copy of
the direct repeat located on each of the reciprocal deletion
products [16]. We have reconstructed the REP sequences
corresponding to the six ISRm22 copies with identical
direct repeats, thus obtaining a clearly defined consensus
sequence at the point of insertion. This consensus is
highly palindromic and the insertion point is located just
at the palindromy axis (Figure 2). The other case of type 1
association detected in S. meliloti 1021 genome was
ISRm19. The four instances of ISRm19 were also inserted
into REP sequences (Figures 1 and 2) [see Additional file
6]
ISPsy7 in P. syringae DC3000, ISRm5 in S. meliloti, and
ISNm1106 in N. meningitidis MC58 and in N. meningitidis
Z2491 genomes present a type 2 association with REP
sequences (Tables 1 and 2). The alignments corresponding to their sequences and their flanking regions are in the
additional material [see Additional file 9, file 10, file 11
and file 12]. The set of proteins with COG3547 that
include proteins annotated as transposases and as PivNM
also presents a type 2 association in N. meningitidis MC58
(Tables 1 and 2).

Discussion
We have detected associations between REP sequences
and IS elements in 6 out of 19 analyzed genomes. In the
set of genomes without association, there are cases with
absent IS elements along the genome (Rickettsia conorii),
and cases with scarce presence (A. tumefaciens). In addition, we have adopted a strict criterion to select the IS elements associated with REP sequences. In several cases, the
limited number of IS copies do not allow the determination of IS elements as a REP recognizer (Table 1). One of
these cases could be the case of IS1397 in E. coli. It is
experimentally proved that IS1397 [11,12,17] can insert
into REP elements but, within the available genomes of
Enterobacteriaceae, there are only two instances of
IS1397, which are in E. coli CFT073 (Table 1). In one of
these instances, IS1397 is clearly inserted into an E. coli
REP element [see Additional file 13], but does not fulfill
the association criteria of our study. Probably, the association with REP elements detected in analyzing genomes
was only the tip of the iceberg, and it could be that many
IS elements chose REP sequences as their targets in natural
isolates.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/62

While many IS elements display little obvious target site
selectivity, some IS elements display considerable selectivity [18]. We have detected a set of elements displaying
high target selectivity by REP sequences (elements with
type 1 association, Table 2). There is experimental evidence for IS1397 and ISKpn1, suggesting that transposases themselves appear to be responsible for target
specificity [12]. The results of our study show that REP-targeting is not restricted to only one IS family, but it extends
to five different IS families: IS3, IS110, IS4, IS256 and IS5.
This is not surprising since the features of the DNA-target
and of the transposase domain responsible for target
choice, are not included in the criteria to define IS families
[16].
There are two families that include elements with experimental evidence of target selectivity by REP sequences.
One family is the IS3 family which includes IS1397 and
ISKpn1 [11,12,17]. The other one is the IS110 family, to
which belongs IS621 [10]. We have detected additional IS
elements belonging to these two families that specifically
transpose into REP elements. The element representing
the IS3 family that we have detected with a strong type 1
association with P. syringae REP sequences is ISPsy8
(Tables 1 and 2). Members of the IS3 family are similar in
many aspects, and form an extremely coherent and highly
related family. Usually, the transposase is encoded by two
ORFs that are sometimes overlapping. The OrfB products,
similar to retroviral integrases [19,20], carry a DD(35)E
motif and are responsible for catalytic activity. The target
recognition capability is usually located in the OrfA protein, which in various members of the family exhibits a
relatively strong helix-turn-helix motif that could provide
sequence-specific binding to DNA [21,22]. Many members also carry a putative leucine zipper located at the end
of OrfA that could be involved in multimerization [23].
The N-terminal domain of the OrfA protein of ISPsy8 is
positive for the Pfam Hidden Markov Model profile
PF01527, named Transposase_8 (Table 2). The region
identified by this profile includes a helix-turn-helix motif
at the N terminus followed by a leucine zipper motif that
is also present in other IS3 family elements. Probably, this
HTH motif is involved in DNA target choice. There are
experiments proving that IS30 needs an H-HTH motif
[24], similar to the H-HTH motif involved in the DNA
binding of the response regulator FixJ, in order to bind
specific DNA target sequences [24]. This data suggests that
some transposases could recognize palindromic REP
sequences in a similar way that some transcriptional regulators recognize their palindromic binding sites.
The IS110 family is the other family with one element, the
IS621, with an experimentally proved REP sequence target
[10]. In our genomic analysis results, this family is the
family most represented in the set of IS elements associ-

ated with REP sequences (Table 2). IS110 is a very special
family of IS elements that has characteristics very different
from the other families. The majority of their members
have not inverted repeats flanking the transposase gene
and little overall similarity can be detected between the
ends. The mechanism of transposition of these elements
is not well determined. However, the target sequences of
the members IS117 from Streptomyces coelicolor and IS900
from Mycobacterium paratuberculosis exhibit similarities to
the circle junction, suggesting an insertion mechanism by
site specific recombination [16,25,26]. The site-specific
invertase Piv from Moraxella lacunata also belongs to the
IS110 family. This protein is included in the IS110 family,
because it exhibits amino acid homology with the transposases of this family. The tertiary structure of amino-terminal domain of Piv invertase has been modelled [27],
based on crystal structures of catalytic domains of HIV-1
integrase [28], avian sarcoma virus integrase (ASV) [29],
and Tn5 transposase-related inhibitor protein [30], and
the predicted structure matched with mutagenesis studies
[27]. These results led Tobiasson and colleagues to propose that Piv invertase and the IS110 transposases could
mediate DNA recombination by a common mechanism
involving a catalytic DED or DDD motif [27]. Our study
adds data that relates the IS110 family with site specific
recombination processes. ISPa11, ISPpu9 and ISPpu10
exhibit a high selectivity in their target choice and could
share mechanisms of target recognition and/or catalytic
activity with some site-specific recombinases and viral
integrases.
Using pairwise whole genome alignments, it is possible to
segment bacterial genomes into a common conserved
backbone and strain-specific sequences called loops [31].
These strain-specific loops include mobile elements,
genes adapted to specific ecological environments, genes
involved in pathogenicity, and other genes acquired by
horizontal gene transfer. Strikingly, whole genome comparative analysis in Escherichia coli strains showed that
strain-specific loops are associated with BIMEs (composed by different types of E. coli REP elements) [31]. In
parallel, the mapping of the IS elements in different E. coli
strains revealed that ISs are associated with deletion of
genome fragments and incorporation of horizontally
acquired genes [32]. In addition, some phenotypic features of E. coli are explained by the inactivation of genes
by IS elements. This is the case for the absence of expression of the OmpC porin with the correspondingly elevated expression of the OmpF porin reported for E. coli B
[32]. Thus, REP elements and IS elements are related with
similar genome evolution events. Our detection of REP
elements as frequent targets for transposases could
explain the involvement of both in common genome
plasticity phenomena. All these facts suggest that REP-rec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/62

ognizer transposases could be contributing to the repertoire of bacterial adaptive mechanisms.
The IS4 family had not been previously related to REP
sequence target selectivity, but our genome analysis has
detected that ISRm22, a member of this family, has its
nine copies inserted into REP elements along the S.
meliloti 1021 genome (Figure 1 and 2 and Table 2). There
is data about the Tn5 transposon that helps to understand
this IS4 family. The Tn5 transposon is comprised of a cluster of antibiotic resistance genes bordered by two IS50
Insertion Sequences. IS50 belongs to the IS4 family and a
truncated version of the IS50 transposase that contains the
catalytic active site, termedTn5 transposase-related inhibitor protein, has been crystallized [30]. The structure of its
catalytic domain is probably similar to the Piv invertase
member of the IS110 family of transposases (See above),
connecting both families with detected REP-recognizer
members. One of the characteristics frequently found for
Tn5 transposition target sites is the palindromic structure
of the insertion site, and also, there is a frequent occurrence of GC pairs at each end of the Direct Repeats
[33,34]. The insertion sites that we have detected for
ISRm22 fulfill both requirements (Figure 2). Another proposed characteristic of Tn5 transposition is the preferable
integration in actively transcribing or highly super-coiled
DNA regions [33]. In this sense, REP sequences are frequently located in regions between convergent genes.
These DNA fragments are especially prone to be highly
supercoiled since simultaneous transcription of both convergent genes can generate increased positive supercoiling
at the end of the genes [3]. Through testing the frequency
of Tn5 insertion into specifically designed synthetic target
sequences, it has been found that IS50 recognizes a preferred 9-bp sequence as its target. Moreover, sequences
resembling this consensus target function optimally when
embedded in a cluster of overlapping similar sequences
[33]. In accordance with these Tn5 data, we have found
that the majority of ISRm22 copies are inserted into a cluster of REP sequences.
In the type 1 association cases (ISPa11, ISPpu9, ISPpu10,
ISRm22 and ISRm19) the conserved sequence encompasses almost the complete REP sequence (Figure 2). All
consensus sequences share a high percentage of GCs, a
greater conservation in GCs than in ATs, a palindromic
structure, and a similar length (with the exception of
ISPsy8 which displays a shorter consensus). In spite of the
differences in their corresponding transposase sequences,
ISPpu9 and ISPpu10 show the same point of insertion
within the consensus sequence. REP-recognizer ISs could
share some features in their target recognition domains.
The determination of the transposases belonging to this
subset could provide new clues to search for a common
mechanism of recognizing the DNA target.

Target selectivity differs significantly between different
ISs. While some ISs display high target specificity, other
elements exhibit regional preferences that could reflect
more global parameters such as local DNA structure [16].
Thus, regional specificity has been related with GC or AT
abundance, degree of supercoiling, DNA bending, replication related factors, and transcription related factors [16].
Transposition activity is frequently modulated by various
host factors. The list of such factors includes the histonelike protein IHF, which has been experimentally proved to
bind REP sequences. Another two REP-binder proteins,
DNA polymerase I [35,36] and DNA gyrase [37-39] have
also been implicated in transposition activity. Clusters of
REP sequences could provide an appropriate context to
recruit all the elements playing a role in transposition. The
detected type 2 associations could reflect a favourable
context for transposition provided by REP sequence clusters in combination with a minor stringency for the DNA
target.
REP elements have also been related to recombination
events. Thus, REP sequences have been found at the
recombination junctions of lambda bio transducing
phages [13] and it has been experimentally detected that
amplification of plasmid F_128 is initiated by REP-REP
recombination [14]. REP elements are DNA points especially suitable for undergoing transposition or recombination events, because they are frequently placed at
extragenic spaces limited by convergent genes [5]. Their
extragenic location would warrant that transposition did
not disrupt genes. Their preference for spaces between
convergent genes would make it probable that transcriptional regulatory signals remained unaltered, since the
end of two genes is not a site for recruitment of transcriptional regulators. Moreover, taking into account that bacteriophage Mu is excluded from insertion in regions of
DNA to which regulatory proteins are bound [40], spaces
between convergent genes would have the additional
advantage of being sites always free of bound regulators.
Furthermore, spaces limited by convergent genes usually
are spaces between two independent transcriptional units.
Hence, REP sequences could be used as tags, generally
positioned at the end of the genes, indicating genome
points especially advantageous for transposition. Thus,
the characterization of some REP elements as hot spots for
recombination and transposition suggests that, probably,
REP elements are key elements in adaptive bacterial evolution. REP sequences provide genome points that warrant secure recombination and transposition without
severe detrimental effects. Moreover, REP sequences are
genome elements that can vary in position and number
supplying additional variability to this set of selectable
points of insertion. Taking this into consideration, it is
probable that comparative genomics studies between
phylogenetically close strains could be more revealing.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/62

Transposition plays a crucial role in horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, including the spread of antibiotic resistance [41-43]. In addition, some virulence genes are
regulated by transposition [44] and it is proven that some
insertions, deletions, inversions and chromosome fusions
are caused by transposition [45,46]. REP sequences could
be playing a role in these important mechanisms.

Conclusion
This global study highlights the importance of REP
sequences as DNA targets for the transposition of mobile
elements and supplies new data that throws light on REP
sequence role, transposase DNA target choice, and
genomic plasticity. In addition, the targets for transposition characterized in this study could open the door to
new tools for genome manipulation.

Methods
There are 19 completely annotated microbial genomes
with REPs that correspond to 13 species of bacteria (Table
1) [see Additional file 14], and in all of them, we have
investigated all the points of insertion of mobile elements. We have used the genome annotations available at
the NCBI website [47]
Multiple alignments of the sequences have been obtained
using the program Multalign [48,49] and CLUSTAL W
[50,51]. In some cases, the extremes of the ISs were not
clearly defined and we have defined them by comparing
and aligning the sequences of all copies. Manual correction of some alignments and alignment of fragments was
necessary in cases of partial sequences and copies with
internal insertions.
We have defined the boundaries of each IS copy based on
data obtained from the annotations of the genomes and
from ISfinder database [52], but in many cases, there were
not available data and we have studied the IS ends by
managing multiple alignment data and the meticulous
analysis of the sequences.
To facilitate the detection of association between the
genome positions corresponding to REP elements and IS
genome positions, we have used C++ programming.
To analyze the domain structure of ISs we have used Pfam
database [53,54].
After analyzing the presence of REP sequences in the extragenic regions flanking the 981 instances of mobile elements present in the 19 analyzed genomes, we considered
that there was association between REP sequences and
mobile elements when the number of copies was equal or
greater than four, and when the percentage of association
was greater than 45% (Table 1).
