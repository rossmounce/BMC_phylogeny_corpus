Abstract
Background: Four genes designated as PTPRK (PTPκ), PTPRL/U (PCP-2), PTPRM (PTPµ) and
PTPRT (PTPρ) code for a subfamily (type R2B) of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs)
uniquely characterized by the presence of an N-terminal MAM domain. These transmembrane
molecules have been implicated in homophilic cell adhesion. In the human, the PTPRK gene is
located on chromosome 6, PTPRL/U on 1, PTPRM on 18 and PTPRT on 20. In the mouse, the four
genes ptprk, ptprl, ptprm and ptprt are located in syntenic regions of chromosomes 10, 4, 17 and 2,
respectively.
Results: The genomic organization of murine R2B RPTP genes is described. The four genes varied
greatly in size ranging from ~64 kb to ~1 Mb, primarily due to proportional differences in intron
lengths. Although there were also minor variations in exon length, the number of exons and the
phases of exon/intron junctions were highly conserved. In situ hybridization with digoxigeninlabeled cRNA probes was used to localize each of the four R2B transcripts to specific cell types
within the murine central nervous system. Phylogenetic analysis of complete sequences indicated
that PTPρ and PTPµ were most closely related, followed by PTPκ. The most distant family member
was PCP-2. Alignment of RPTP polypeptide sequences predicted putative alternatively spliced
exons. PCR experiments revealed that five of these exons were alternatively spliced, and that each
of the four phosphatases incorporated them differently. The greatest variability in genomic
organization and the majority of alternatively spliced exons were observed in the juxtamembrane
domain, a region critical for the regulation of signal transduction.
Conclusions: Comparison of the four R2B RPTP genes revealed virtually identical principles of
genomic organization, despite great disparities in gene size due to variations in intron length.
Although subtle differences in exon length were also observed, it is likely that functional differences
among these genes arise from the specific combinations of exons generated by alternative splicing.

immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, and a single transmembrane region. The intracellular region contains a
membrane proximal juxtamembrane domain, followed
by a catalytically active tyrosine phosphatase domain and
a second inactive domain. Type 2 RPTPs have been further
subdivided into two distinct classes (R2A and R2B). Genes
in the R2B class are differentiated from the R2A class by an
additional MAM (Meprin/ A5/PTP mu) domain at the Nterminus [5]. In addition to a putative role in signal transduction, R2B molecules have cell adhesive properties [6].
Because no invertebrate homologues of the four R2B molecules have been found to date [7], and no ESTs indicative
of R2Bs have been isolated from invertebrates, the
function(s) of these phosphatases is likely to be highly
specific to vertebrate species.

Background
Over the past decade, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) have emerged as integral components of
signal transduction in the vertebrate and invertebrate
central nervous system. RPTP domain structure suggests
cell adhesive properties, and studies on Drosophila
mutants have provided strong evidence that specific
RPTPs act together to provide a set of partially redundant
signals necessary for muscle targeting and fasciculation
decisions in CNS neurons [1,2], both crucial components
in the establishment and maintenance of neural circuits.
RPTPs have been divided into eight major subfamilies
(Figure 1), based on phylogenetic analysis of the phosphatase domains [3]. Four of these subfamilies (R2A, R2B,
R3, and R4) play critical roles in CNS development [4].
Common to all Type 2 RPTPs is an extracellular segment
containing a combination of multiple fibronectin and

expressed primarily in the central nervous system where it
delineates a distinct developmental compartment in the
cerebellar cortex [9,10]. In the present study, the genomic
structures of all four murine R2B genes (PTPκ, PTPµ, PTPρ
and PCP-2) were compared, and their expression localized to specific cell types within the central nervous system. The 5'-genomic sequences were examined for
putative promoter regions and transcription factor binding sites, and full-length sequences were used to determine the phylogenetic relationship between the four
genes. Clustal-X alignment of cDNA and Genbank
sequences predicted the presence of alternatively spliced
exons. Five such exons were confirmed experimentally,
with the majority being localized in the juxtamembrane
and first phosphatase domain in each of the four genes.

Results and Discussion
Murine R2B gene size and exon/intron organization
The chromosomal localization of the R2B genes has been
determined in several vertebrate species: In the human,
the PTPRK gene is located on chromosome 6, PTPRL/U on
1, PTPRM on 18 and PTPRT on 20. In the rat, PTPRK
(NW_047547; incomplete) is located on chromosome 1,
PTPRL (NW_047724) on 5, PTPRM (NM_047819) on 9,
and PTPRT (MN_47659) on 3. The four murine R2B genes
(ptprk/PTPκ, ptprl/PCP-2, ptprm/PTPµ, and ptprt/PTPρ) are
located on mouse chromosomes 10, 4, 17, and 2,
respectively.

Murine and human R2B cDNA sequences were used to
identify the corresponding genomic DNA contigs in the
Celera and NCBI genomic databases, using BLAST and
MEGABLAST programs. Alignments were used to establish exon and intron size, and junction phase. The
genomic structure of human PTPρ has been reported previously [8]; the human PTPµ, κ and PCP-2 annotated
structures are available from the authors (rotter.1@osu.edu) upon request. The sizes and genomic
organization of the mouse R2B genes are derived from
Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, and are summarized in Figure 6. The
overall size of the mouse genes and their corresponding
human orthologs was very similar. In general, gene size
exceeded the average, especially in the case of PTPρ, which
was the largest gene (~1,117,873 bp), followed by PTPµ
(~686,308 bp), PTPκ (~521,813 bp) and PCP-2 (~63,884
bp) (Figure 6). The recent completion of the human chromosome 20 sequence [11] revealed that PTPρ is the largest
confirmed gene on that chromosome, due primarily to
expanded introns in the genomic region containing coding regions for the extracellular and juxtamembrane segments of the protein. Although the functional
consequence of this large gene size is not clear, one predicted outcome is an extended time period for transcription of the corresponding mRNA.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/14

Each of the R2B genes contained over 30 exons, which
were examined pairwise to determine the overall nucleotide/exon identity between the four genes (Figure 7).
Three major regions were delineated, each with varying
degrees of sequence identity: Exons 2–13 comprised the
extracellular segment (MAM, Ig and four fibronectin (FN)
type III domains), exon 14–18 (juxtamembrane region),
and exons 19–32 (two phosphatase domains). Although
the number of exons comprising each of the extracellular
domains was identical in each of the four genes, exon size
varied in some domains and remained unchanged in others. Within the extracellular segment, the MAM domain
showed the most extensive variation in exon size: The first
exon ranged from 123 to 132 bp, and the third from 79 to
82bp (Figure 8). MAM domains are comprised of 160–
170 amino acids containing four conserved cysteines;
their function has been examined in some detail. When
expressed in non-adherent cells, PTPµ [12-14] and PTPκ
[15] proteins formed large calcium-independent clusters.
Aggregation was strictly homophilic, consisting exclusively of cells expressing only a single R2B type [14-16].
Because this property had not been demonstrated with
any of the other RPTP subfamilies, a crucial role for the
MAM domain in this homophilic interaction was implied.
However, in an in vitro binding assay in which regions of
recombinant PTPµ were expressed [17], the homophilic
binding site was localized to the immunoglobulin (Ig)like domain. Subsequently, MAM and Ig domains were
shown to function cooperatively in homophilic binding
in both PTPµ and PTPκ [16]. It was suggested that the
binding site is located in the Ig domain and the MAM
domain is part of a "sorting" mechanism that confers
homophilic binding specificity [6]. Figures 7 and 8 show
that, when combined with the invariant 272 bp middle
exon, each R2B MAM domain had a unique combination
of exon sizes and low sequence identity, indicating a
region of high specificity. The adjacent Ig-like domain
contained exons of identical size, implying a less specific
role than that of the MAM domain. These marked variations in sequence identity are consistent with the idea that
the MAM domain plays a role in the mediation of
homophilic binding specificity [6].
The four FN type III repeats are involved in general adhesive interactions. The size of the first and third of these
domains was identical among the R2B genes, whereas the
second and fourth FNIII domains differed slightly (Figure
8). In the second FNIII domain, exon sizes varied from
297 in ptprt, to 303 in ptprk, and 309 in ptprm and ptprl.
The only difference in the fourth FNIII domain was in
ptprk, in which one of the three exons comprising this
domain was slightly larger (106 vs 103) than in the other
three genes.

Figure 6
Genomic organization of the murine RPTP R2B genes
Genomic organization of the murine RPTP R2B genes. Exons are shown as vertical bars and introns as thin horizontal
lines drawn to different scales (indicated by scale bars). The size of the genomic regions encoding the extracellular and intracellular segments of each gene is not drawn proportionally. Note that exon distribution and clustering is similar for each gene.

Within the intracellular segment, the most dramatic variation in size, number and percentage nucleotide identity
was observed in exons corresponding to the
juxtamembrane region (Figures 7 and 8). This region consisted of six distinct exons (14–18) and is thought to be
involved in substrate recognition and specificity, properties likely to show the greatest differences among the
RPTPs (discussed below). Sequence comparison and
exon/intron structure indicated that the two phosphatase
domains (exons 19–32) were highly conserved. Furthermore, the degree of nucleotide identity was constrained to
a relatively narrow range. A detailed analysis of the R2B
phosphatase domains has been described previously [8].
The first intron in all four R2B genes (Figure 6) was disproportionately large, a feature shared with other cell

adhesion molecules. Intron/exon junctions (Figures 2, 3,
4, 5) conformed to the AG/GT rule [18]. Precise exon
boundaries were determined by the presence of consensus
splice sites [19] and preservation of the cDNA reading
frame. Exon/intron boundaries were identical in all four
mouse and human genes. Extracellular exons were primarily in phase 1 and the boundaries of the protein domains
were always demarcated by a phase 1 boundary. In contrast, intracellular exons were much smaller and the
majority, including those aligned with domain boundaries, was in phase 0 (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 8).
In situ hybridization
Previous in situ hybridization and Northern studies have
shown that the four R2B family members are expressed in
many tissues throughout development: PTPκ mRNA was

present in brain, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, placenta,
liver, kidney, and intestine; PTPµ was present in brain,
lung, skeletal muscle, heart, placenta, and embryonic
blood vessels [20,21], and PCP-2 was detected in the
brain, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney and placenta
[20,22,23]. The distribution of PTPρ is somewhat
anomalous in that it was almost entirely restricted to the
brain and spinal cord [9,10].
In the present study, digoxigenin–labeled cRNA probes
were used to determine the cellular localization of R2B
transcripts in specific regions of the adult (P180) mouse
brain: The olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus
and cerebellum (Figure 9). Each of the four R2B transcripts was expressed at moderate to high levels in the
mitral, external granule and glomerular layers of the olfactory bulb, and at lower levels in the external plexiform
layer. All four R2B transcripts were distributed throughout
the cerebral cortex, with the highest levels observed in layers II, IV, and V (PTPρ), IV and V (PTPµ), II to V (PTPκ),
and II through VI (PCP-2). Within the hippocampus and

dentate gyrus, large cells (Golgi II neurons) scattered
throughout the hippocampal CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions,
oriens and pyramidal layers, the hilus and subiculum,
expressed PTPρ and PTPµ at very high levels. The PTPκ
and PCP-2 transcripts were also present in Golgi II neurons, however, expression was restricted to cells in the
hilus (PTPκ, PCP-2) and subiculum (PCP-2). Much
higher expression levels were present in hippocampal
pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells. Each of the four
R2B transcripts was differentially expressed in the cerebellum. PTPρ mRNA was almost entirely restricted to the
granule cell layer of lobules 1–6 of the cerebellar cortex
and deep cerebellar neurons; very sparse labeling was also
present in basket and stellate cells in the molecular layer.
PTPµ was expressed at high levels in the Purkinje cells,
and at much lower levels in Golgi, stellate and basket
cells. The PTPκ transcript was present at low levels in
basket, stellate, Golgi and granule cells throughout the
cerebellar molecular and granule cell layers. PCP-2 was
expressed at moderate levels in granule and Purkinje cells,
and at lower levels in basket and stellate cells, and in deep

cerebellar neurons. The sense signal for each of the four
genes (not shown) was very low and distributed uniformly across sections, indicating that non-specific
expression was negligible. These studies show that each of
the four R2B transcripts exhibit exclusive, as well as overlapping, distribution patterns.
Phylogenetic analysis of murine RPTP R2B cDNA
sequences
The phylogenetic relationship of the entire sequence of
the R2B phosphatases encompassing both extra- and
intracellular regions was compared. Analysis of the fulllength mouse cDNA nucleotide and predicted amino acid
sequences indicated that the four genes originated from a
common ancestor that gave rise to two separate branches

(Figure 10). Of the four R2B genes, PTPρ (ptprt) and PTPµ
(ptprm) were most closely related, followed by PTPκ
(ptprk). The most distant member was PCP-2 (ptprl). Previous phylogenetic analyses, based solely on the comparison of the first [3,24] and second [25] phosphatase
domains, provided similar results. A priori, the four type
R2B phosphatases could have arisen either by a single
fusion event followed by at least two rounds of duplication, or by several separate fusion events. In the first
instance, the phylogenetic tree generated by comparing
the first phosphatase domains should be the same as that
generated by comparing the entire proteins. Different
phylogenetic trees would be expected if the four R2B
phosphatases were generated by separate fusion events.
Our finding that the phylogenetic relationship of the four

(K-O), and PCP-2 (P-T) transcripts were present in various regions of the CNS including the olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum.

domains argues in favor of the former explanation, and
supports the contention that during the transition from
single-celled to multicellular organisms, double domain
phosphatases originated by duplication, followed by
fusion to cell adhesion-like genes [25].
Transcription Factor Binding sites
Regions upstream from the transcriptional start site are
likely to be involved in the regulation of gene expression.
Although the overall cDNA sequences of the four R2B
RPTPs were quite similar, the 5' UTRs varied significantly

in sequence and length. Predicted transcription factor
binding sites included both unique and common motifs
(Table 1). Putative binding sites unique to each of the R2B
phosphatases included AP-1, HSF1, TST-1 and YY1
(PTPκ); delta EF-1, E4BP4, freac-3 and p53 sites (PTPµ);
AP-2, c-Myb, NF-1, sox-5, and Sp-1 sites (PTPρ), and freac7, HFH-8, HNF-3beta and N-Myc sites (PCP-2). Sites common to all four R2B genes included Oct-1, CdxA, C/EBP,
En-1, GATA-1, GATA-2, GKLF, HoxA3, Ik-2, Msx-1, Pax-4
and SRY. The greatest number of binding motifs (6–20)
was for CdxA, a homeobox-containing gene whose expression demarcates embryonic anterior-posterior boundaries

[26]. Also occurring at high frequency were SRY (3–10),
C/EBP (3–7), AML-1a (4–7) and HoxA3 (5–8) motifs.
Each of the R2B genes also had multiple transcription
factor binding sites for engrailed-1, which is active in
specific cell types of the developing central nervous system [27]. All four genes had at least one Pax-4 binding
motif; these sites are activated in the pancreas [28],
coinciding with our observation [29] that all four R2B
genes are expressed in the MIN-6 cell line, which is
derived from pancreatic β cells. The PTPκ and PTPρ putative promoter regions also had a Pax-2 binding motif; Pax2 directs expression in the developing kidney [30], a documented feature of PTPκ expression in the developing
mouse [20]. Many of these predicted transcription factorbinding sites have important roles in the developing central nervous system, where R2B transcripts have both overlapping and distinctly different distributions. The

sequence identity, suggesting important functional
differences among the four R2B phosphatases. A
combination of phase information from individual
human and murine R2B genomic structures and extensive
Clustal X alignment of full-length cDNA sequences from
Genbank (including PTPρ sequences from this laboratory) was used to predict the presence of alternatively
spliced exons. Comparison of the four R2B sequences
revealed at least 8 exons that were potentially alternatively
spliced. Splicing was examined in neonatal and adult
C57BL/6 mouse brain (cortex, forebrain, brainstem, and
cerebellum) and in human fetal brain using RT-PCR. PCR
primers were designed to amplify regions encapsulating
exons 7, 8, 14, 16 and 17/18 (17a), 20/21(20a), 22/23
(22a), and 28/29 (28a) for each of the four genes. The
four R2B genes shared a common "core" of 30 exons.
Exon numbers were based on those described for PTPρ
[8]. PCR experiments showed that five of the eight tested
exons (14, 16, 17a, 20a, and 22a) were alternatively
spliced. Exons 7 and 8 were present and exon 28a was
absent in all R2B transcripts tested. All but one of the alternatively spliced exons (14) was located in the R2B intracellular segment. Exon 14 preceded the transmembrane
region; exons 16 and 17a encoded intracellular juxtamembrane sequences, and the last two exons (20a, and 22a)
encoded portions of the catalytically active, first phosphatase domain.
Each of the four R2B genes expressed in the brain used the
five alternatively spliced exons in a different combination:
In PTPρ transcripts, exon 17a and 20a were absent, and
exons 14, 16, and 22a were alternatively spliced (Figure
11). In PTPµ transcripts, exons 14, 16, 20a and 22a were
absent; exon 17a was present and not alternatively
spliced. The alternative use of two 5' splice consensus sites
resulted in the transcription of an additional 58 bp of the
intron between exons 13 and 15 (Figure 12). In PTPκ
mRNA, exons 14 and 22a were absent, and exons 16, 17a
and 20a were alternatively spliced (Figure 13). In PCP-2
mRNA, exons 14 was absent, exon 16 was not transcribed
in brain, and exons 17a, 20a, and 22a were alternatively
spliced (Figure 14). These results are summarized in Table
2. Splicing was also examined in human R2B transcripts
where the use of alternatively spliced exons was virtually
identical to that observed in the mouse genes. No agerelated or regional differences were observed in the CNS
in any of the above studies.
The high frequency of alternatively spliced exons in the
R2B juxtamembrane segment suggests that the region has
highly specialized functions. The importance of
alternatively spliced exons has been well documented for
the closely related Type 2 RPTP, LAR, in which a small (27
bp) alternatively spliced exon (LASE-c) was identified in
the fifth FN-III domain [31]. Subsequently, a 33 bp exon

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/14

(LASE-a), was identified in the intracellular
juxtamembrane region [32]. LASE-a, which was shown to
be brain specific and developmentally regulated, was
present in cell bodies of cultured granule cells, but was
absent in neurites. Conversely, the LASE-c isoform was
absent in cell bodies and present in neurites. Using in vitro
ligand binding assays, the laminin-nidogen extracellular
matrix complex was identified as a ligand for LAR, specifically interacting with the fifth FN-III domain [33]. When
LAR bound the laminin-nidogen complex, cells formed
long processes. Inclusion of the alternatively spliced 27 bp
LASE-c exon disrupted this binding, causing changes in
cell morphology. These studies imply a role for alternatively spliced exons in neurite extension through modification of cell adhesion.
The juxtamembrane region of the four R2B phosphatases
shows greater variation in exon size and number, and is
considerably longer, than the comparable region in other
receptor-like PTPs. Furthermore, the region displays
sequence similarity to the intracellular domain of cadherins, a family of calcium-dependent transmembrane
proteins involved in homophilic cell adhesion. Cadherins
bind catenins [34], which in turn bind the actin cytoskeleton [35] thereby influencing cell adhesiveness and
changes in morphological attributes such as neurite extension and growth cone rearrangement. The intracellular
domain is highly conserved among cadherin family
members, and is essential for cadherin-mediated cell
adhesion [36]. Both PTPµ [37] and PTPκ [38] have been
shown to stimulate neurite extension in retinal explants
and in cerebellar cultures, respectively. Furthermore, the
intracellular segment of PTPµ binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin [39,40] in a complex with αand β-catenin. The other R2B phosphatases have also
been shown to interact with the cadherin/catenin pathway: PTPκ interacts with β- and γ-catenin at adherens
junctions [41]; PCP-2 colocalizes with β-catenin and Ecadherin at cell junctions [22], and directly interacts with
β-catenin [42]; and PTPρ binds cytoskeletal components
including α-actinin and β-catenin [29]. More recent
studies on PTPµ have further delineated this pathway:
PTPµ-mediated neurite extension in retinal neurons is
also dependent on PKCδ [43] and Cdc42 [44] activity. In
addition, PTPµ is required for E-cadherin dependent cell
adhesion [45], and for recruiting RACK1 to cell-cell contacts [46]. The physical association of PTPµ with RACK1
has been demonstrated [46]. It is likely that the juxtamembrane segment also mediates the interaction of PTPµ
with these additional transduction molecules. The preponderance of alternatively spliced exons in the juxtamembrane region may add specificity to R2B adhesive
functions via regulation of juxtamembrane binding
specificity.

Conclusions

Methods

Analysis of the intron/exon structure of the four R2B
phosphatase genes revealed that despite considerable disparities in gene size, genomic organization was virtually
identical, possibly reflecting their close phylogenetic
relationship. In the central nervous system, the expressions of the four transcripts were unique, perhaps resulting from the use of different transcription binding sites.
Considerable variation in exon utilization was seen in the
juxtamembrane domain, a region shown to interact with
a variety of intracellular signal transduction molecules.
Alternative splicing of exons in this region could result in
different functional roles for each of the R2B
phosphatases.

Genomic structure of R2B genes
The genomic structure of the four murine R2B RPTP genes
was determined as follows: The R2B cDNA sequences
were used to identify the corresponding genomic shotgun
clones in the Celera mouse genomic DNA database, using
BLAST (parameters set to default values) and MEGABLAST
programs. The identified individual shotgun fragments
were aligned onto their respective scaffolds, and distances
were calculated based on scaffold lengths. A similar
approach using the NCBI [47] and Sanger Center [48]
databases was used to identify the human R2B gene structure. The identified clones were superimposed onto the
assembled minimal tiling paths and the size of the genes

cases where multiple 5' UTRs were reported in Genbank,
the sequences were aligned and differences identified as
either an incomplete reporting of the 5' UTR, or possible
alternative start sites if sequences were located in different
regions of the genome. The "MATCH" program [52] was
used to identify potential transcription factor binding
sites in the 5000 bp preceding the 5' UTR, using the Vertebrate matrix of the TRANSFAC 5.0 database, with cut off
values set to "minimize false positives and false
negatives".

was calculated from the sizes of the individual
overlapping clones. In order to determine exon/intron
organization, each cDNA sequence was compared to
genomic DNA sequences using Spidey [49]. The vertebrate
genomic sequence was selected as input, "use large intron
sizes" was enabled, and the minimum mRNA-genomic
identity was set to 60%.
Phylogenetic analysis
RPTP R2B nucleotide and amino acid sequences were
aligned using Vector NTI Suite, V.6, AlignX. PAUP 4.0b10
was used to construct a phylogenetic tree of the R2B gene
family. The S. cerevisiae tyrosine phosphatase PTP1, and
the D. melanogaster receptor tyrosine phosphatase, DLAR,
were used as outgroups. Rooted phylogenetic trees were
drawn using the parsimony method with transversions
weighted 10:1 over transitions, and changes in the first
nucleotide of the triplet codon were weighted by a factor
of 2 over changes in the second or third nucleotides.
Heuristic searches were used to find the optimum tree,
with the order of sequence additions randomized.
Transcription factor binding sites
The genomic region to be examined for transcription factor binding sites was determined using BLAST2 [50] and
FirstEF [51]. The RPTP 5' UTRs and genomic DNA
sequences were aligned pairwise to detect introns. For

Riboprobe synthesis and in situ hybridization
The distribution of R2B RPTPs in the brain was determined by in situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled
RNA probes, synthesized as follows: The design of RT-PCR
and PCR primers was based on the reported sequences
(Genbank) for murine PTPρ (NM_021464), PTPµ
(NM_008984), PTPκ (NM_008983), and PCP-2
(NM_011214). RT-PCR primers spanned a region near
the 3' end of the second phosphatase domain, and PCR
primers were designed to amplify the region corresponding to the first and second phosphatase domains of PTPρ,
PTPµ, and PTPκ, and the second domain of PCP-2. The
expected sizes for PTPρ (1.72 kb), PTPµ (1.5 Kb), PTPκ
(1.5 Kb), and PCP-2 (465 bp) were obtained and cloned
into the pBLUEscript II KS vector. Probes were labeled
with digoxigenin using the DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche
#1175025) as described by the manufacturer with the following modifications. In the labeling mix, 0.5 µl of 40 U/
µl RNase OUT (Life Technologies), and 2 µl of 20 U/µl T7
(antisense) or T3 (sense) RNA polymerase (Roche), was
added. The DNA template was digested with 1 U/µl
RNase-free DNase I (Epicentre). Transcripts were purified
by standard RNA precipitation, and the pellets resuspended in 50 µl DEPC-treated H20. Adult (P60) C57BL/6
mouse brains were cryostat sectioned (20 µm) in the sagittal plane, and in situ hybridization was conducted as
described previously [9,10]. Riboprobe-labeled sections
were washed at a final stringency of 0.125x SSC, at 65°C.
Following the hybridization washes, the sections were
processed with an anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche)
[53], dried and coverslipped.
Alternative splicing of the four RPTP R2B genes
First strand cDNA was made from total RNA from neonatal (P1) and adult (P60) mouse whole brain using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). In addition,
cDNA was made from cerebellum, brainstem, forebrain
and cortex of a P23 mouse, and a 16–24 week old human
fetal brain (Clontech). The reverse primer (5' CACGCACACAGTTGAAGATGTCC), which was used in all RPTP
first strand cDNA synthesis, is complementary to a region
near the end of the first phosphatase domain (3580 to
3602 nt; NM_007050). PCR was performed (Platinum
Taq, Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer.

Alternative splicing of PTPκ mRNA
Alternative splicing of PTPκ mRNA. RT-PCR products were amplified using primers flanking exon 16 (panels A and B),
exon 17a (panels C and D) and exon 20a (panels E and F). Left panels: bands in lanes 1, 2, and 3 are from human fetal brain,
mouse P1 brain, and mouse P60 brain total RNA, respectively. Right panels: bands in lanes 4, 5, 6 and 7 contain total RNA from
cerebellum, brain stem, basal forebrain and cortex (P23), respectively. Transcripts containing both splice forms of exons 16 and
20a were found in all lanes.

All primers were used at a final concentration of 250 nM.
An Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient was used with the
following cycling parameters: 2 minutes at 94°C, 35
cycles of 15 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 58 or 60°C,
45 seconds at 72°C, and a final extension step (5 minutes
at 72°C). The PCR products were run on 3.5% NuSieve
GTG agarose (Biowhittaker) gels, stained with ethidium
bromide and photographed using a Kodak DC120
camera. DNA bands were isolated and gel purified using
Qiagen Gel Extraction kit. Identity of all RT-PCR products
was confirmed by sequencing. Primer sequences are available from the authors upon request (rotter.1@osu.edu).
