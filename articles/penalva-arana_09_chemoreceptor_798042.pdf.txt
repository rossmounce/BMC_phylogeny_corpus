Abstract
Background: Chemoreception is vitally important for all animals, yet little is known about the
genetics of chemoreception in aquatic organisms. The keystone species Daphnia pulex, a well
known crustacean, is the first aquatic invertebrate to have its genome sequenced. This has allowed
us the initial investigation of chemoreceptor genes in an aquatic invertebrate, and to begin the study
of chemoreceptor evolution across the arthropod phylum.
Results: We describe 58 Grs (gustatory receptors), belonging to the insect chemoreceptor
superfamily, which were identified bioinformatically in the draft genome of the crustacean waterflea
Daphnia pulex. No genes encoding proteins similar to the insect odorant receptors (Ors) were
identified. These 58 Grs form 3 distinctive subfamilies of 37, 12, and 5 genes, as well as a highly
divergent singleton (Gr58). In addition, Grs55–57 share distinctive amino acid motifs and cluster
with the sugar receptors of insects, and may illuminate the origin of this distinctive subfamily. ESTs,
tiling array, and PCR amplification results support 34 predicted gene models, and preliminary
expression data comparing the sexes indicates potential female-biased expression for some genes.
Conclusion: This repertoire of 58 chemoreceptors presumably mediates the many
chemoperception abilities of waterfleas. While it is always possible that the entire Or gene lineage
was lost at some point in the history of Daphnia pulex, we think it more likely that the insect Or
lineage is indeed a relatively recently expanded gene lineage concomitant with the evolution of
terrestriality in the insects or their hexapod ancestors.

Background
The ability of Daphnia to detect chemical cues released by
prey or predator have been glimpsed through studies on
feeding behavior and predator avoidance [1,2]. Daphnids
reject food particles, adjust feeding currents according to
food availability, quality and surrounding chemical cues,
and appear to swim and remain in areas where food is
abundant [3-6]. However, their presence in food abundant areas can be

altered by the presence of predators, and their vertical distribution is often associated with the presence or absence
of predators [6,7].
Kairomones from predators, fish or invertebrate, affect
Daphnia's swimming patterns, dial vertical migration, and
even affect morphology [2,8-11]. Species of Daphnia can
develop neck teeth, thicker carapaces, and/or long head
spines to reduce their vulnerability to predation [12,13].

Predator chemical signals, both fish and invertebrate kairomones, share some similarities. For example, in the case
of Leucaspius delineates and Chaoborus americanus, these
kairomones are made up of more than one active component with low-molecular weight and are organic watersoluble molecules with intermediate polarity, that have
no primary amines and require hydroxyl groups for activity; they are also heat stable molecules that can be partially
destroyed by acid and base digestions [14,15]. When the
kairomones of different fish species were compare there
was a striking resemblance between both groups, indicating that the signals are very similar if not identical and are
found free in solution and not bound to edible particles
[15]. However progress is still slow in the identification of
the molecular nature of kairomones, and we are yet to isolate any individual chemical that can invoke a robust
chemical mediated behavior in aquatic invertebrates [16].
The cues involved in Daphnia mating are not well understood. Unlike copepod males that can trace a female signal in the water column [17], Daphnia males must come
into contact with potential mates [18,19]. This inspection
is quick and although the cues needed to tell sexes and
species apart could be mechanical; it is also possible that
a female pheromone is present on the sexual female's carapace, allowing males to quickly identify a mate. The possibility that a chemical cue is involved in mating is hinted
at by the fact that males press their antennules against a
potential mate, and these antennules are structurally identical to known chemosensors found on other crustaceans
and the first antennae of terrestrial insects (also known as
chemosensors) [20,21].
In insects a chemoreceptor superfamily of seven-transmembrane domain proteins (TM7) provides the molecular basis for the specificity and sensitivity of both smell
and taste (recently reviewed by [22-25]). The superfamily
consists of the gustatory receptor (Gr) family [26-28],
which contains most of the protein diversity of the superfamily [29], and the odorant receptor (Or) family [30-32],
which is a single highly expanded lineage [29]. The Or
superfamily has now been described in a variety of insects.
These include both endopterygote relatives of the Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies in which they were first discovered, for example, the other 11 Drosophila species with
genome sequences [33-36], as well as the mosquitoes
Anopheles gambiae [37] and Aedes aegypti [38,39], the silkworm moth Bombyx mori [40,41], the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum [42,43], and the honey bee Apis mellifera
[44]. While this chemoreceptor superfamily is clearly very
old with distant relatives of the Grs identified in the
Caenorhabditis nematodes, Robertson et al. (2003) suggested that the Ors might be a relatively recent expansion
of dedicated odorant receptors from a particular Gr lineage concomitant with the evolution of terrestriality in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/79

insects from a crustacean ancestor. The availability of a
draft genome sequence for the waterflea Daphnia pulex
[45], a representative of the freshwater branchiopod crustaceans thought by some to be the sister group to the terrestrial insects (e.g. [46]), allows a first test of this
proposal.
Here we describe the chemoreceptor superfamily revealed
by the draft genome sequence for D. pulex, finding six lineages of Grs, including one expanded to 37 genes, for a
total of 58 genes. These presumably mediate the many
"taste" functions in this freshwater crustacean. Consistent
with the prediction of Robertson et al. (2003), we find no
evidence of Ors. This includes the basal and highly conserved ortholog of the unusual DmOr83b protein implicated in partnering with each of the specific Ors in
individual olfactory sensory neurons [47-52]. While it is
always possible that this entire Or gene lineage was lost at
some point in the history of Daphnia pulex, we think it
more likely that the insect Or lineage is indeed a relatively
recently expanded gene lineage concomitant with the evolution of terrestriality in the insects or their hexapod
ancestors.

Results
Absence of Ors
Extensive BLASTP searches of the predicted proteins
encoded by the v1.0, NCBI GNOMON, and merged v1.1
gene builds provided by the JGI at DOE, as well as
TBLASTN searches of the September 2006 draft genome
sequence using representative Grs and Ors from all available insects as queries revealed only multiple lineages of
Grs. In particular, no homolog of the otherwise highly
conserved DmOr83b protein, which has orthologs in all
available insect genomes, was identified. It is always possible that a particular gene might be in a region of a
genome that cloned poorly in the genomic libraries
employed in a genome project, and hence was sequenced
too thinly to be assembled. We therefore also searched all
2,724,768 raw traces deposited in the Trace Archive at
GenBank using the TBLASTN algorithm for any reads with
sequence similarity to all available DmOr83b orthologs
from insects, and found none. Similar searches with representative insect Ors similarly revealed no convincing
matches. We conclude that the D. pulex genome does not
encode a homolog of the DmOr83b protein or any other
insect Or homologs and that the entire insect Or gene
family is absent from this crustacean genome.
A diversity of Grs
We identified fifty eight genes encoding proteins belonging to the Gr family (Table 1 and Figure 1). About half of
these genes are found in tandem arrays across 21 scaffolds
in the sequenced genome (Table 1). While genes within
tandem arrays are usually phylogenetic close to each other

The location and protein ID plus the newly annotated protein ID for each gene model found in the Daphnia genome V1.1 is given, along with
annotation comments. Genes in the first column followed by the letter P indicates Pseudogene, N indicates predicted models needed revision, and
FIX indicates gene models that were not initially predicted and were manually curated.

in the tree, there has been considerable gene movement
within the genome. For example, although Grs1–9 cluster
together in the tree, they are in three tandem arrays spaced
across 2 Mbp on scaffold 4. Grs47–52 form a phylogenetic
cluster, and most are in a tandem array on scaffold 2, but
Gr47 is on scaffold 58.
These Grs are fairly easily recognized through their somewhat conserved TM7 regions near the C-terminus, which
includes a TYhhhhhQF motif in TM7. Almost all Gr genes
in D. pulex have a phase-0 intron six codons before this
motif, an intron that is present in most Gr genes in insects
as well as their nematode relatives, the gur genes [29]. The
only exceptions are the divergent Gr42–46 subfamily (see
below). These Daphnia Grs align fully with the insect Grs,
including a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids at the Nterminus that includes a few conserved amino acids. We
note that several fragmentary or highly degenerate pseudogenes also exist in this genome which we have not
named or included in our analyses.

eral amino acids that are distinctive, most prominently a
glutamic acid (E) residue immediately after the conserved
TY pair in TM7, although the functional significance of
these residues is unknown. Three DpuGrs have such a residue, Grs55–57, and they cluster with the insect sugar
receptors near the base of the tree in our phylogenetic
analysis, although there is only bootstrap support for
Gr55 and 56 clustering with the insect sugar receptors
(Figure 1). Bayesian analysis actually suggests that these
two proteins cluster within this sugar subfamily, internal
to TcGr4 and BmGr7. These insect sugar receptors have a
distinctive set of intron locations [29], and only the last
two are shared with Gr55–57, number 2 and 3 in [29].
These last two introns are shared across the entire superfamily and hence are not diagnostic of the sugar receptors.
We propose that at least DpuGr55 and 56 are functional
sugar receptors, perhaps representing the origins of this
sensory specificity in arthropods, from which the insect
sugar receptors evolved with considerable sequence and
gene structure evolution.

There are three well-conserved and distinctive lineages
within the insect Grs that one might anticipate finding in
the D. pulex set. The first lineage is the carbon dioxide
receptors, exemplified by the heterodimeric pair Gr21a
and Gr63a in Drosophila melanogaster [53,54] and the heterotrimeric set Gr22–24 in Anopheles gambiae [37,55],
which is present in moths and beetles as well [55,56].
Remarkably this otherwise highly conserved lineage is
absent from all other available more basal insect and
arthropod genomes, including D. pulex [56].

The third conserved lineage of insect Grs is the DmGr43a
protein and relatives in other species (AgGr25, AaGr34,
HvCr4, BmGr9/10, TcGr20–28 and 183, and AmGr3),
however there is no obvious ortholog in D. pulex. Nor are
there obvious orthologs for the DmGr66a protein implicated in bitter taste in Drosophila e.g[61], or the candidate
hydrocarbon receptors DmGr68a, 32a, and the 39a protein set [22,62]. Neither of the latter two observations is
surprising as these receptors are only conserved in flies,
indeed the latter three only in drosophilid flies.

The second lineage is the sugar receptors, consisting of
eight Grs in D. melanogaster (Gr5a, 61a, and 64a-f) [5760], nine Grs in the three available mosquitoes [39], five
in the silkmoth Bombyx mori [41], sixteen in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum [43], and two in the honey bee Apis
mellifera [44]. This highly divergent set of proteins has sev-

Instead, most of the remaining D. pulex Grs form three distinctive gene subfamilies without obvious relatives in the
available insect genomes. The first consists of 37 proteins
in the middle of Figure 1 in two well-supported clusters,
specifically Grs1–29, and 47–54. A second subfamily of
12 genes, Grs30–41, share a gene structure with the above

This is a corrected distance tree, with the highly conserved CO2 receptor lineage designated as the outgroup to root the tree.
Bootstrap values from 10,000 replications of uncorrected distance analysis are shown on major branches, followed by Bayesian
posterior probabilities. DpuGr (D. pulex) lineages are highlighted in red. Major groups of insect Grs whose ligands are known
or which are mentioned in the text are highlighted in blue (Ag – Anopheles gambiae, Am – Apis mellifera, Bm-Bombyx mori, HvHeliothis virescens, and Tc- Tribolium castaneum).

subfamily, with three phase-0 introns at the C-terminus,
called 1–3 in [29], that are shared by all the insect chemoreceptor lineages (the only exception is Gr53, which lost
the first of these three). All 49 of these genes also share a
phase-0 intron about half way along the genes, which may
be unique to these Daphnia Grs (it also appears to be
present in Grs55–58, however the alignment is less definitive in them).
A third highly divergent subfamily consists of Grs42–46,
which have a completely different gene structure, having
lost all three of the ancestral phase-0 introns near the Cterminus. Grs42–44 appear to have phase-1 introns near
their N-termini, Gr45 is intronless in its coding region,
and Gr46 has two internal phase-2 introns.
Finally, Gr58 is a particularly highly divergent protein
with a long branch hence was not included in Figure 1,
nevertheless it has all the hallmarks of a Gr, including the
TYhhhhhQF motif in TM7 with a phase-0 intron immediately before the final exon encoding this motif (as well as
two internal phase-0 introns and one phase-2 intron).
There are two fragmentary and highly degenerate pseudogene copies of Gr58 in the genome, one immediately
downstream of it in scaffold_24 and another in
scaffold_21. Similarly highly degenerate pseudogene copies exist for other Grs, such as Gr27 and 47.
Expression of Grs in Daphnia
Insect Grs are generally expressed at low levels in only a
few gustatory or olfactory sensory neurons and studies in
insects are largely limited to Drosophila melanogaster where
promoter::LacZ or promoter::GFP fusion transgenes have
allowed visualization of their expression patterns (e.g.
[63-65]). Transformation techniques are not yet available
for Daphnia, so we examined the only available large study
of Daphnia gene expression, an unpublished Nimblegen
genome tiling array experiment comparing males and
females using whole bodies, performed in conjunction
with the genome project (J. Colbourne personal communication). This reveals generally low but convincing levels
of expression for 27 of these genes (Figure 2). Gr11, 13,
15, 45, and 53 show particularly high levels of expression,
of which all but Gr11, have female-biased expression.
Only one slightly male-biased receptor was identified
(Gr6). PCR amplification of a subset of Grs from female
and male cDNA supported expression for 11 genes and
some showing negligible expression on the tiling array
were also verified using qRT/PCR amplification from
whole bodies. This investigation revealed that 7 genes
having negligible expression on the tiling array, are
indeed expressed (Figure 2). There is no obvious pattern
of expression level with clustering of genes in the phylogenetic tree (data not shown).

Discussion
We describe the 58 Grs we found encoded by the draft
Daphnia genome sequence. We believe these constitute
the entirety of the "insect" chemoreceptor superfamily in
D. pulex. This superfamily of odorant and gustatory receptors was identified originally in D. melanogaster and has
been identified in all other insects with sequenced
genomes, and it was anticipated that it would also be
present in other arthropods. The absence of the Or family,
a single particularly highly divergent and expanded lineage within the superfamily, is consistent with the prediction of Robertson et al. (2003) that the insect Or family
evolved with terrestriality in insects or their immediate
hexapod ancestors, although sequences of additional
crustaceans, other arthropods, and basal hexapods, will be
required to test this hypothesis further. We have undertaken several steps to identify all members of the Gr family, including highly sensitive TBLASTN searches using
only the somewhat conserved TM7 region of these proteins, and HMMER searches of all available predicted proteins using all available Grs in the model set. Grs can
sometimes be extraordinarily divergent, however, so it
remains possible that some have been missed. For example, Kent et al. (2008) report five new Gr genes in the
Anopheles gambiae genome that were missed by Hill et al.
(2002) because they are so highly divergent and automated gene models for them were not sufficiently well
built to find them using PSI-BLASTP searches.
The only Daphnia Grs with a clear relationship to particular insect Gr lineages are Gr55 and 56, and perhaps Gr57,
which cluster with the sugar receptor subfamily. This indicates that Daphnia likely can sense some sugars, presumably dissolved in water and perhaps indicating food
sources [66]. Despite extensive searches we find no
orthologs of the other well-known and highly conserved
Gr lineage in insects, the carbon dioxide heterotrimeric
receptors, represented by DmGr21a and 63a [53-56]. This
is perhaps not surprising given that Daphnia are not
known to be able to sense carbon dioxide, although it
appears that Daphnia epphipia (or resting eggs), do
respond and at times require a carbon dioxide signal to
hatch (see [67]). The only other relatively well conserved
Gr lineage in insects is that of DmGr43a, AgGr25, HvCr4,
and AmGr3, however the conservation here is insufficient
to expect to find this lineage in Daphnia (Figure 1). The
remaining insect Grs for which ligands are known,
DmGr66 for caffeine [61] and DmGr68a and 32a for
cuticular hydrocarbons [22,62], are dipteran-specific lineages, hence were not expected to have Daphnia orthologs.
Instead we believe there are only three other major Gr
subfamilies in Daphnia, all expansions within crustaceans,
consisting of 37, 12, and 5 genes. The highly divergent

ceptors are not coupled to G-proteins and instead function as ligand-gated ion channels [69,70].

An interesting feature of some of these Daphnia Grs, e.g.
31–34, 36, 37, 39, and 41, is that they end immediately
after the conserved TYhhhhhQF motif which forms the
core of TM7. These are the shortest versions of Grs known,
and indicate that the C-terminus of these proteins is
unlikely to be involved in any important interactions with
other proteins. This situation is compatible with recent
findings that the insect chemoreceptors likely have the
opposite membrane topology to the TM7 GPCRs
[50,52,68], because the C-terminus would be external to
the cell where no significant interactions with proteins in
any signaling transduction machinery would be expected.
They therefore support the hypothesis that these chemore-

Conclusion
This repertoire of 58 Grs presumably underlies the many
abilities of Daphnia to sense their external chemical environment, which they do using both a classic "taste" mode
involving physical contact with objects, as well as what
might be considered a "smell" mode in which they sense
dissolved chemicals in the water. As elaborated in the
Introduction, these include food, potential mating partners, and potential threats like fish. Therefore, we suspect
that these genes will be expressed in identified chemosensors, such as the first antennule and feeding appendages
[71]. Our preliminary assessment of expression levels of
these chemoreceptors comparing males and females

reveals apparent female-biased expression for a few of
them, but no clearly male-specific receptors that might
perceive sex differences. The next obvious step in studies
of these Daphnia Grs will be to determine their expression
patterns more precisely. Initially this will be achieved by
RT/PCR studies of surgically separated structures, like the
antennules, although this is technically challenging but
achievable for such tiny animals. While in situ hybridization might allow more refined studies of their expression
patterns, in D. melanogaster at least, Grs typically are
expressed at too low levels for reliable in situ hybridization. Ultimately studies using promoter::GFP fusion transgenes might be required to establish confident expression
patterns once transgenic techniques are developed for
Daphnia. It will be of particular interest to determine
whether any of these six gene lineages, for example perhaps the most highly expanded 37 and 12 gene subfamilies, is exclusively expressed in the antennules or
swimming antennae, in which case these might constitute
the effective "olfactory" receptors of Daphnia.

Methods
Known insect chemoreceptors whose sequences have
been entered in to GENBANK (National Center for Biotechnology Information) were used to search for similar
genes in the Daphnia genome sequence. Protein sequences
were used to perform TBLASTN [72] searches of assembled scaffolds available through two websites: Joint
Genome Institute (JGI) Daphnia pulex V 1.0 and V 1.1 [73]
and Daphnia Genome BLAST [74]. Genomic scaffold
sequences were used to constructgenes manually in the
PAUP*v4 [75] and MEGAv4 [76] text editors, using comparisons with known exons and online programs to predict exon/intron splice sites [77,78]. Divergent Daphnia
proteins were used in iterative rounds of TBLASTN
searches to find additional genes. In three cases genes
were truncated by the ends of contigs, but in each case the
complete gene sequence could be assembled with the aid
of raw reads, and these are indicated by the suffix FIX after
their names. Two genes in the named set are clear pseudogenes, with internal frameshifting deletions, and are indicated by the suffix PSE. All proteins were aligned using
CLUSTALX [79], and gene models refined to fix apparent
alignment difficulties. Intron locations and phases were
located in the alignment in the text editor of PAUP to
assist gene model refinement and subfamily analysis. All
proteins are available as a FASTA file [see additional file
1].
Our manually curated gene models were compared with
the set of 30,907 gene models generated by the JGI known
as v1.1. They were also validated through nr, SwissPro and
Pfam hits. In summary, 13 gene models were identical, 13
needed minor revisions, and 29 needed modification, and
3 (Grs 34, 41, 48) were completely unannotated. 44 genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/79

genes where supported by nr, SwissPro and Pfam hits,
with the drosophilid Gr64 sugar receptor family supporting DpuGr 55 and 56 as potential sugar receptors. We also
compared our gene models with preliminary tiling array
expression (NimbleGen, Madison, WI) results to see if
expressed exons agreed with our predicted models, and 27
gene models gained additional support thereby.
For phylogenetic analysis, representative insect Grs, primarily from Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae,
with a few from Bombyx mori, Heliothis virescens, Tribolium
castaneum, and Apis mellifera, were included in the alignment for comparison. The length-divergent N- and C-terminal regions, as well as internal regions with major
alignment gaps, were removed, leaving 328 aligned
amino acid positions. For the main phylogenetic analysis,
corrected distance was performed in PAUP*v4 using the
heuristic search with tree-bisection-and-reconnection
branch swapping. Distances were corrected for multiple
amino acid replacements in the past using the maximum
likelihood model, the BLOSUM62 amino acid exchange
matrix, and default settings in TREE-PUZZLE v5.0 [80].
Additional Bayesian analysis was performed using
MrBayes v3.1 [81] with the JTT substitution model, four
chains, 1 million generations, and two runs. Trees were
sampled every 100 generations, discarding a burnin of
250,000 generations.
Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique we
designed primers for assessing expression of a subset of
our gene models. This subset included genes having EST
and tiling support as well as those lacking any type of support. Primers were designed and tested on both genomic
DNA and cDNA of Daphnia pulex male and female clones.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT/PCR) was run on a few
models to assess differences between the sexes and to
investigate whether lack of support was due to low levels
of expression which standard PCR cannot amplify to
detectable levels on a gel.
