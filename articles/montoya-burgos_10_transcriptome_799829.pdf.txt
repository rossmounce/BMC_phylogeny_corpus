Transcriptome screen for fast evolving genes by
Inter-Specific Selective Hybridization (ISSH)
Juan I Montoya-Burgos*, Aurélia Foulon, Ilham Bahechar

Abstract
Background: Fast evolving genes are targets of an increasing panel of biological studies, from cancer research to
population genetics and species specific adaptations. Yet, their identification and isolation are still laborious,
particularly for non-model organisms. We developed a method, named the Inter-Specific Selective Hybridization
(ISSH) method, for generating cDNA libraries enriched in fast evolving genes. It utilizes transcripts of homologous
tissues of distinct yet related species. Experimental hybridization conditions are monitored in order to discard
transcripts that do not find their homologous counterparts in the two species sets as well as transcripts that
display a strong complementarity between the two species. Only heteroduplexes that disanneal at low stringency
are used for constructing the resulting cDNA library.
Results: We demonstrate the efficiency of the ISSH method by generating a brain cDNA library enriched in fast
evolving transcripts of a non-model catfish species as well as a control, non-enriched library. Our results indicate
that the enriched library contains effectively more fast evolving sequences than the control library. Gene
annotation analyses also indicate enrichment in genes with low expression levels and non-ubiquitously expressed
genes, both categories encompassing the majority of fast evolving genes. Furthermore, most of the identified
transcripts show higher sequence divergence between two closely related catfish species as compared to
recognized fast evolving DNA markers.
Conclusions: The ISSH method offers a simple, inexpensive and efficient way to screen the transcriptome for
isolating fast evolving genes. This method opens new opportunities in the investigation of biological mechanisms
that include fast evolving genes, such as the evolution of lineage specific processes and traits responsible for
species adaptation to their environment.

Background
Fast evolving DNA sequences are used for answering a
broad range of biological questions relative to population processes and phylogeography [e.g. [1]], species
diversification [e.g. [2,3]], conservation biology [4] and
also genome or phenotype mapping [e.g. [5]]. However,
due to the very same intrinsic quality for which they are
looked for, i.e. their high evolutionary rate, fast evolving
DNA sequences display “lineage specific” changes and
therefore require de novo development each time a new
group of non-model organisms is being investigated.
Despite various methodologies targeted toward the isolation of unspecific polymorphic DNA fragments [e.g.
[6-8]] the identification and the isolation of fast evolving

DNA sequences in non-model organisms is still laborious and expensive, making it a major impediment to
the routine analysis of multiple loci on many taxa.
The isolation of fast evolving genes has gained new
motivation and attention as genes involved in several
actively investigated processes display high substitution
rates: the evolution of species specific traits such as the
human brain [e.g. [9,10]], speciation genes [e.g. [11,12]],
reproduction genes [e.g. [13,14]] or genes governing the
evolution of adaptive traits [e.g. [15]]. Theoretical
approaches suggest that adaptation genes should be fast
evolving so that selection could have a substrate on
which to act [16]. Furthermore, speciation genes, those
that are directly or indirectly involved in the establishment of the genetic barrier between closely related species, consistently displayed high divergence rates [11].
At present, fast evolving genes which often evolve under

positive selection can be identified either through large
genomic comparisons which are feasible only for model
organisms like Drosophila species [e.g. [17,18]] or
human-chimpanzee comparisons [19] or via long term
experimental approaches such as in the discovery of the
hybrid inviability gene Hmr in Drosophila [20]. The
increasing interest in biological mechanisms driven by
fast evolving genes appeals to the development of a
more efficient and cost effective method for the isolation
of such genes across closely related species and which
would not imply the prior knowledge of genetic or
genomic information.
Here we describe a simple and efficient experimental
approach for enriching a cDNA library in fast evolving
transcript fragments. Our method, named Inter-Specific
Selective Hybridization (ISSH) is based primarily on the
principles of the widely used subtractive hybridization
(SH) procedure developed more than two decades ago
for isolating cDNAs of differentially expressed genes
[21-23]. In the original SH protocol, the hybridization of
cDNAs versus mRNAs of different cell lines belonging
to the same organism distinguishes transcripts that are
equally expressed in both cell lines from those that are
uniquely or differentially expressed in the cell line of
interest. In the ISSH approach (Figure 1), the transcriptome of the species of interest ("probed” species) is
reverse transcribed into single stranded (ss) cDNA and
then hybridized against the biotinylated mRNA pool of
a distinct yet close relative ("selector” species). During
hybridization, three populations of transcripts of the
species of interest can be found: (1) transcripts that
never find their selector counterparts due to differential
expression or gene loss; (2) fast evolving transcripts that
find their homologous counterparts but the resulting
heteroduplexes are unstable due to numerous nucleotide
mispairings; and (3) conserved transcripts that form
stable heteroduplexes. The second population of transcripts is in fact composed by sequences of varying
divergence. The transcripts of interest are those that disanneal at the lowest stringencies and are therefore rescued for constructing the cDNA library enriched in fast
evolving transcripts. The ISSH method was applied for
isolating fast evolving transcript fragments of the nonmodel catfish species Ancistrus temminckii (family Loricariidae). We used the zebrafish genome as a reference
for assessing the sequence divergence of the isolated
transcripts and for transcript annotation and
characterization.

genes. The property of evolving fast implies that such
transcripts will disanneal at low stringencies from the
heteroduplexes formed by homologous complementary
sequences of the two species. Our method was applied
to build a cDNA library enriched in fast evolving transcript fragments of brain tissue of the catfish Ancistrus
temminckii. We used as the selector species its close
relative Ancistrus dolichopterus. To assess the efficiency
of the ISSH method we prepared a non-enriched control
cDNA library of brain tissue of A. temminckii using
standard protocols. The two libraries were sequenced
with the FLX Genome Sequencer technology (Roche).
We then “blasted” the enriched and control libraries
against the complete genome of the zebrafish and analyzed the differences. We also annotated the transcripts
producing significant matches and examined their characteristics to highlight the effectiveness of our method.
As the zebrafish is not a close relative to our catfish and
because the sequences of interest display high sequence
divergence, a substantial proportion of the enriched
library yielded no significant Blast matches. Therefore,
we prepared an EST library of a close catfish relative,
Hypostomus gr. plecostomus, belonging to the same subfamily (Loricariidae: Hypostominae), for refining the
analyses.
Analysis of sequence divergence

High-throughput sequencing and reads assembly yielded
2429 and 1255 contigs for the enriched and control

libraries respectively. We blasted the contigs against the
zebrafish genome using parameters suitable for comparing divergent sequences. Only Blast results with E-values
lower than 10e-5 were considered for the analyses; they
represented 45.7% and 40.6% of all contigs of the
enriched and control libraries, respectively. Among the
contigs producing non-significant Blast matches about
half were low-complexity sequences as indicated by
RepeatMasker and were excluded from further analyses
(20.7% and 22% of the enriched and control libraries,
respectively). Significant Blast alignments were classified
by size in order to produce a finer analysis of the differences that exist between the enriched and control
libraries. The sequence divergence comparisons (Table 1)
consistently show that the enriched library displays more
divergent sequences (higher mean) than the control
library using as reference the zebrafish genome. Applying
a mean t-test unambiguously indicates that the mean
divergence per category is significantly higher in the
enriched library than in the control library, and this for
all size categories (Table 1).
When using the zebrafish genome as reference, the
fastest evolving sequences may not find their homologous
counterparts due to the distant evolutionary relationship
between the zebrafish and our non-model catfish. Thus,
performing the same analysis yet using an evolutionary
closer reference - our EST database of the catfish Hypostomus gr. plecostomus - may allow a better understanding
of the efficiency of ISSH method. The sequence

divergence comparisons (Table 1) show again a systematic and significant enrichment in fast evolving sequences
in the enriched library as compared to the control library.
The difference between the two libraries is generally
higher than when using the zebrafish as reference. This is
likely explained by the inclusion of a set of faster evolving
genes which can now find their homologues in the evolutionary closer Hypostomus reference.
Characteristics of the sequences retained by the ISSH
method

In order to better assess the usefulness of the ISSH
method we annotated the contigs of the enriched and
control libraries according to the information collected
from their translated best Blast hit in the Swissprot/Uniprot database with a minimum threshold of E-score ≤
10e-8. In this way only 60 contigs were characterized in
the enriched library (2.5% of all contigs) and 39 in the
control library (3.1% of all contigs). The analysis of the
annotated sequences will serve to test three predictions
that have to be fulfilled if the method achieves its goal.
First, as mitochondrial genes evolve significantly faster
than the vast majority of nuclear genes they should be
more numerous in the enriched library than in the control. The results indicate that mitochondrial genes
represent 22.5% versus 8.6% of the annotated contigs of
the enriched and control libraries, respectively, fulfilling
the prediction. The second expectation concerns the
overall correlation between the expression level and
gene sequence conservation, where conserved genes are
generally expressed at higher rates than fast evolving
genes [24]. The expression level of the annotated contigs
were approximated by using Unigene database information on the expression level of their orthologous genes
in nervous system tissues of the zebrafish or, alternatively, of the mouse or human when the data was not
available. Annotated contigs were classified into four
categories of gene expression levels (Figure 2). We discarded here the mitochondrial genes which are fast evolving yet possess a high expression level. As expected,
the enriched library is essentially composed by genes
belonging to the category with the lowest expressionlevel (58% of the total versus 26% in the control library).
The enriched library also shows a depletion of genes in
the highly expressed gene categories, which are generally
the more conserved ones. The third prediction refers to
the observation that genes with tissue-specific expression evolve generally faster than genes with ubiquitous
expression, a category in which most housekeeping
genes are found [25,26]. As predicted, our method
resulted in an enrichment of non-ubiquitously expressed
genes totaling 57% of the annotated contigs of
the enriched library versus 35% in the control library.
The non-ubiquitously expressed genes are defined as

Figure 2 Number of annotated contigs per category of gene
expression level for the enriched and control libraries. Using
Unigene database information, gene expression level is calculated
as the number of ESTs of the gene under consideration in the
studied tissue divided by the total ESTs of the tissue library,
multiplied by 10’000.

those expressed in less than four tissues according to
Unigene expression information.
In an attempt to better characterize the fast evolving
transcripts isolated in Ancistrus temminckii and which
show a putative orthologous sequence in the Hypostomus gr. plecostomus EST dataset, we search for a tentative annotation by Blastn comparisons against the
mRNA reference sequences (mRNA refseq) database of
NCBI, limited to teleost sequences (a threshold of E <
1e-8 was used). In this way, 26 transcripts present in the
catfishes Ancistrus and Hypostomus, as well as in the
teleost mRNA refseq database were annotated and their
sequence divergence was calculated based on the overlapping region of the sequence alignment, allowing a
direct comparison (Table 2). The tentatively annotated
transcript fragments show an overall high sequence
divergence between the two Hypostominae catfishes
(mean = 0.28 ± 0.09), not much different from the
divergence between Ancistrus and the closest teleost
orthologous sequence of the mRNA refseq database
(mean = 0.39 ± 0.08), which do not include catfish
sequences. Interestingly, about half of the transcript
fragments encompasses coding sequence (cds) (Table 2).

Sequence divergence was calculated using the alignment region with sequence in all species compared. Divergences were corrected using the K2P model with 2
transitions per transversion. The lowest part of the table presents the sequence divergence of two published fast evolving markers used for characterizing
species or genera. Dr: Danio rerio; Ss:
Salmo salar; A.: Ancistrus; H.:Hypostomus.

To estimate whether the sequence divergence is higher
than in recognized fast evolving coding and non-coding
DNA markers, we calculated the sequence divergence of
the mitochondrial cytochrome oxydase I gene (COI),
used by the Barcode of Life Initiative for characterizing
species http://www.dnabarcodes.org/, and the two
introns of the reticulon 4 (RTN4) gene, used to infer
fish phylogenies at the specific level [2]. Most of the tentatively annotated transcripts display higher sequence
divergence between Ancistrus temminckii and Hypostomus gr. plecostomus, as compared to the two reference

markers (Table 2), validating once again the ISSH
method. Likewise, most of the transcripts show higher
sequence divergence between Ancistrus temminckii and
Danio rerio as compared to the COI sequence. However,
the intronic sequences of the RTN4 are much more
divergent than the annotated transcripts. This is likely
explained by the frequent insertion/deletion events in
non-coding sequences and which enhance drastically the
sequence divergence between distantly related species.
We emphasize that the sequences of the transcripts
annotated using the mRNA refseq database likely

represent the most conserved regions of the isolated
transcripts dataset, as faster evolving regions will not
find their sequence counterparts in the refseq database,
which comprises no closely related catfish sequences.

Discussion
The isolation of fast evolving genes can be easily accomplished on model organisms for which abundant genomic and transcriptomic knowledge exist. Bioinformatic
routines and experimental procedures (micro-array technology) are available for this purpose. At present, however, there is no efficient method for doing so in nonmodel organisms. The ISSH method presented here is a
fast and cost-effective procedure for enriching a cDNA
library in fast evolving genes. The various tests we have
performed resulted in a convincing demonstration of
the efficiency of our method. We have shown that the
overall sequence divergence was significantly increased
in the enriched library as compared to the control when
blasting these libraries against the zebrafish genome or
against our Hypostomus catfish EST library. Moreover,
the results of the ISSH method fulfilled the three predictions made upon the knowledge of general properties of
fast versus slowly evolving genes. Briefly, the enriched

Page 6 of 10

library displayed (1) a higher proportion of fast evolving
mitochondrial genes, (2) a higher fraction of genes with
low expression level, and (3) proportionally more nonubiquitously expressed genes. Furthermore, the fast
evolving transcripts with orthologous sequences in the
two catfish species and in the mRNA refseq fish database displayed generally higher sequence divergence
than recognized fast evolving DNA markers.
A complementary support of these results comes from
the Gene Ontology (GO) classification. The GO annotation (Figure 3) showed that genes involved in metabolic
processes were less abundant in the enriched library
than in the control (30% versus 64% of all annotated
contigs in the enriched and control libraries, respectively). This is consistent with the observation that the
set of housekeeping genes is generally rich in metabolic
genes, for example in human [27]. Besides indicating
that the enriched library is depleted in housekeeping
genes, the GO annotation also shows that this library is
enriched in nervous system tissue-specific genes (Neuronal activity, Figure 3), highlighting once more the ability
of the method in isolating genes with tissue-specific
expression that generally evolve faster than ubiquitously
expressed genes.

The proportion of annotated contigs via Uniprot/Swissprot comparisons is rather small, particularly in the
enriched library. This can be explained firstly by the
relatively poor representation of fish genes in the Uniprot/Swissprot database combined with the likely high
sequence divergence between the genes of the non-fish
organism in the database and our catfish. Secondly, not
all contigs may contain coding sequence; they may be
composed mainly of UTR sequence. However, the
enriched library shows no marked bias toward UTR
sequences, which evolved generally faster than their
contiguous coding sequences. Indeed, about 68% of contigs longer that 240 bp display putative open reading
frames (ORF) longer than 80 aa (criterion of the H-invitational annotation project), and 51% of contigs longer
that 300 bp display putative ORFs longer than 100 aa
(criterion of the Functional Annotation of Mouse (FANTOM) project), which corresponds to four and five
times the calculated sequence length without stop
codons in non-coding sequence using the same base frequencies, respectively. Similar proportions are observed
in the control library (70% and 54%, respectively) indicating no strong enrichment in UTR sequences.
Furthermore, a significant part of the isolated transcripts
may be non-coding RNAs. It has been shown, for
instance, that non-coding RNAs constitute more than
half of the mammalian transcriptome [28]. As the annotation of the isolated fast evolving transcripts is difficult
due to the lack of sequence similarity with distant reference species, we are unable for the moment to assess
the proportion of fast evolving non-coding RNAs in our
dataset.
Our method has the advantage of being theoretically
very versatile in terms of evolutionary divergence relating
the species of interest and its selector species. The faster
evolving genes will already show detectable sequence
divergence between closely related species while using a
more distant selector species will allow the isolation of a
wider set of fast evolving genes. Likewise, one can modify
the hybridization temperature to fine-tune the degree of
sequence divergence one is looking for between the species of interest and the selector species. Our method may
also be applicable for screening intra-species gene-associated polymorphism. Only in that objective the ISSH
method may be compared with the In-Gel Competitive
Reassociation and EST Array Hybridization method [29],
which exploits the property that the vast majority of
RFLP fragments between two strains or populations
share the same electrophoretic size. Deviation from this
property generates false positives and, therefore, the
method of Gotoh and Oishi (2003) looses its interest if
more distantly related groups are used.
Interestingly, the ISSH method can also be used for
isolating the fraction of highly conserved genes between

Page 7 of 10

species. This is achieved by rescuing the fraction of ss
cDNA that disanneal only at very stringent conditions,
which guarantees an almost perfect complementation
between the probed and selector pool of transcripts.
Moreover, the species from which the selector pool of
mRNA is extracted may be selected in order to increase
the level of conservation of the enriched cDNA library:
the more evolutionary distant the selector species will
be, the more conserved the isolated transcripts will be.
The ISSH method is not linked to a specific sequencing technology. In this study we used the long-read
454 FLX technology (Roche) to ensure a minimum
sequence length for downstream sequence analyses.
However, this argument is currently less valid as the
Illumina short-read sequencing technology, which produces many more reads at a lower cost per base, has
been recently shown to be useful and accurate in de
novo transcriptome assembly of non-model organisms
[30]. Traditional Sanger sequencing can also be used
providing that the PCR amplified fast evolving transcripts are cloned before sequencing.

Conclusions
We demonstrated that the ISSH method efficiently
enriches a cDNA library in fast evolving genes. As this
new method does not rely on the previous knowledge of
sequence information, it can be performed on every
non-model organism, and is therefore of wide use.
Although the improvements and reduced cost of nextgeneration sequencing technologies may lead to ever
more complete transcriptomes assemblies, and may have
the potential to be used for identifying fast evolving
transcripts with bioinformatic tools, the ISSH method
will still have and interesting role to play. First, the
ISSH method is inexpensive, of little labor, and leads
directly to the set of transcripts of interest. Second, as
the fast evolving genes are often expressed at low level,
they may be hard to retrieve using next-generation
sequencing technologies unless very deep sequence coverage is performed, at high cost. Therefore, the ISSH
method opens new possibilities in screening transcriptomes in search of genes involved in lineage specific
processes and traits, a field of growing interest in evolutionary biology.
Methods
RNA extraction and preparation of the control library

Total RNA was extracted from fresh brain tissue of
Ancistrus temminckii (probed species) and its close relative Ancistrus dolichopterus (selector species) using TRIzol reagent (Gibco). We also extracted total RNA from
our catfish outgroup reference Hypostomus gr. plecostomus. After quantification and quality verification of the
total RNA, mRNA was isolated using the mRNA

Montoya-Burgos et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:126
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/126

Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics). The SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) was used
to prepare the brain control library of Ancistrus temminckii and also the outgroup reference Hypostomus gr.
plecostomus, starting with 1 μg of brain mRNA and the
option of oligo(dT) anchor priming for the first strand
synthesis step.
The ISSH protocol

The selector pool of mRNA, extracted in this work
from Ancistrus dolichopterus, is biotinylated to allow
subsequent separation by magnetic particles coated
with streptavidin. Biotinylation of 5 μg mRNA was
done using the BIO-ULS labeling kit (Kreatech); the
final volume was reduce to 7 μl using a Speedvac concentrator. The probed pool of mRNAs extracted from
the species of interest Ancistrus temminckii is reversetranscribed into ss cDNA using a short-tailed random
hexamer primer (5’-AGGA-(N)6-3’). We used 1 μg of
mRNA (one fifth of the selector’s mRNA amount) and
200 ng of the short-tailed random primer in a total
volume of 12 μl. The reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol for random
priming; the final volume was 20 μl. The RNA template is destroyed by alkaline hydrolysis (0.35 N
NaOH; 0.35 M EDTA) at 65°C for 15 min. The solution is then neutralized with 0.35 N HCl and first
strand cDNAs are purified using the Mini Elute PCR
Purification Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s
protocol but with an additional washing step and two
rounds of elution. The final volume was reduced to 7
μl using a Speedvac concentrator.
Inter-Specific Selective Hybridization

The pool of biotinylated selector mRNA (7 μl) and the
pool of first strand cDNA of the species of interest
(7 μl) are mixed and the total volume is adjusted to 15
μl. An equal volume (15 μl) of 2× hybridization buffer is
added (10 mM EDTA pH8, 1.5 M NaCl, 40 mM sodium
phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 10× Denhardt’s, 0.2% SDS).
The solution is heated at 90°C for 2 min and quickly
placed in a rotary shaker located inside a preheated
hybridization oven at 55°C. The hybridization is carried
on during 60 hours at 55°C. At the end of the hybridization step, 75 μl of NaCl 1 M is added to the hybridization mixture, which is kept at RT.
Separation of the fraction enriched in fast evolving
cDNAs

The selector-probed hybridization mix is sequentially
denatured to separate two fractions of cDNAs with
increasing denaturation stringencies, the first fraction
containing the non-hybridized or non-specifically

Page 8 of 10

hybridized probed cDNAs and the second fraction is the
one enriched in fast evolving transcripts. First, streptavidin magnetic particles (Roche Diagnostics) are prepared
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (1200 μg)
and resuspended in 100 μl of TEN 1000 buffer. The
hybridization mixture is then transferred in to the tube
containing the streptavidin magnetic particles and
placed in a rotary shaker for 45 min at RT. In this step
the biotinylated selector mRNAs, which may be hybridized or not with a complementary probed ss cDNA,
are linked to the streptavidin magnetic particles. The
non-hybridized probed cDNAs are discarded by placing
the tube in a magnetic separator (Qiagen) and by
removing the supernatant. The magnetic particles with
their attached molecules are washed three times at 55°C
for 15 min, in 600 μl of preheated 5× SSC, then resuspended in 50 μl of 0.1× SSC and incubated at 65°C for
15 min. In this last step the fast evolving probed cDNAs
will disanneal from their selector counterpart and this
fraction of interest is recovered in the supernatant after
a magnetic separation. This step is repeated once. The
fraction enriched in fast evolving cDNAs is purified by
ethanol precipitation in presence of ammonium acetate
and glycogen. The pellet is rinsed once in 70% ethanol
and resuspended in 20 μl water.
Second strand synthesis and adapter ligation

The ss cDNAs are transformed into double stranded
(ds) cDNAs using short-tailed random hexamer primers
(CCAC-(N)6) and the DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s random priming protocol. cDNAs are then blunt ended
using T4 DNA Polymerase (Promega), extracted with
phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) and recovered by ethanol precipitation with ammonium acetate.
Double strand EcoRI adapters (Invitrogen) are ligated to
the ds cDNA ends according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The final volume is adjusted to 100 μl with
water and the cDNAs are purified using the High Pure
PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics).
PCR amplification of the fraction enriched in fast evolving
cDNAs

A first PCR amplification is performed using a single
primer (5’-GTCGACGCGGCCGCGAATT-3’) targeted
toward the EcoRI adapter ligated at both ends. The PCR
reaction is done in 50 μl final volume with 10 μl of
cDNA as template and with the following profile: 1 min
initial denaturation at 94°C followed by 35 cycles with
30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 62°C, 2.5 min at 72°C and a final
elongation step of 5 min at 72°C. The PCR product is
checked on 1,5% agarose gel. A nested PCR is performed using specific primers overlapping the end of
the EcoRI adapters and the tails of the two short-tailed

Montoya-Burgos et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:126
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/126

random primers used for the synthesis of the first strand
and then for the synthesis of the second strand (EcoRIAGGA: 5’-TCGCGGCCGCGTCGACAGGA-3’; EcoRICCAC: 5’-TCGCGGCCGCGTCGACCCAC-3’). The
PCR conditions are as described above but the amount
of template DNA is adjusted according to the result of
the first PCR. The PCR products are checked on 1,5%
agarose gel and then purified using the High Pure PCR
Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics).
High-throughput sequencing

For the Ancistrus control and the outgroup reference
Hypostomus gr. plecostomus, shotgun DNA libraries
were prepared with a starting amount of 4 μg DNA.
The mean fragment size was of about 500 bp, obtained
using nebulizers and chemicals from the GS DNA
Library Preparation Kit (Roche Diagnostics) according
to the manufacturer’s manual. This step was not needed
for the Ancistrus library enriched in fast evolving transcripts as the ISSH method results in a PCR product
containing fragmented transcripts, generally in the range
of 300 to 1000 bp. After DNA purification, the DNA
end repair step and the ligation of the barcoding adaptors were performed following established protocols
[31]. The adapter-ligated DNA from each of the three
libraries were pooled and prepared for the 454 sequencing according to standard protocols [32], using the GS
DNA Library Preparation Kit with Titanium reagents,
and following the instructions of the GS FLX manuals
(Roche Diagnostics). The library was sequenced on one
16th region of a full GS FLX sequencing plate with a
prior titration run. Upon completion, sequences were
screened for primer concatemers, week signal, poly A/T
sequences, and barcodes for assigning them to one of
the three samples. The average lengths of the reads
were 180 bp. cDNA assemblies were performed with the
SeqMan software from DNAStar. The cDNA library
enriched in fast evolving genes and the control library of
Ancitrus temminkii were deposited in the Short Read
Archive (SRA) of NCBI under the accession number
SRA009346.1
Blast search and transcript annotation

The Blast search against the zebrafish sequences of all
the EMBL sub-divisions (Expressed Sequence Tag; High
Throughput cDNA sequencing; High Throughput Genome sequencing; mRNA of Standard; Whole Genome
Shotgun) were performed on the Vital-IT high-performance computing facility of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics http://www.vital-it.ch. We used blast
parameter values suitable for comparing divergent
sequences (word size = 7; match score = +1; mismatch
score = -1; initial penalty for opening a gap = 1; penalty
for extending a gap = 2). The local Blast search against

Page 9 of 10

our Hypostomus gr. plecostomus brain EST database was
performed using the software blast-2.2.19 developed by
NCBI. Perl scripts for parsing the blast outputs were
built using Eclipse SDK 3.4.1.
The proportion of contigs with low complexity
sequences or sequence repeats was assessed using
RepeatMasker open-3.2.8 (Smit, AFA, Hubley, R &
Green, P. RepeatMasker Open-3.0. 1996-2004; http://
www.repeatmasker.org). Transcripts were annotated
according to their best Blast hit against Swissprot/Uniprot databases, with a minimal E-score of 10e-8. The
translations into the six frames were performed using
BCM Search Launcher [33] and blasting was done with
Blastp at NCBI. Expected frequency of stop codons in
non-coding sequences was calculated by multiplying the
three single nucleotide frequencies taken from the
sequence data of the corresponding library, and summing
the frequency of the three possible stop codons. Gene
transcription levels in specific tissues were taken from
the Unigene database and are expressed in number of
ESTs of the gene under consideration divided by the total
ESTs of the tissue library, multiplied by 10’000. Gene
ontology classification was performed on Panther
(Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships;
http://www.pantherdb.org), complemented with ontology
information given in Uniprot database. We used only the
top categories of the classification hierarchy, as given in
Panther. Fast evolving transcripts found in Ancistrus temminckii, Hypostomus gr. plecostomus EST, and in the
mRNA reference sequences database of NCBI, restricted
to the Teleostei (Blastn threshold E-score < 10e-8), were
used to asses the sequence divergence. A tentative annotated was given according to the best hit against the
mRNA refseq database. For direct comparison purposes,
sequence divergence was calculated on the sequence
region present in all three taxa. Sequences of the reference fast evolving markers were obtained from GeneBank: Ancistrus brevipinnis COI: EU359402; Hypostomus
boulengeri COI: EU359422; Danio rerio complete genome: NC_002333; Ancistrus cirrhosus RTN4 introns:
EU817562; Hypostomus boulengeri RTN4 introns:
EU817560. The RTN4 introns from Danio rerio were
retrieved from Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org/, locus:
chromosome: Zv8:1:42092991:42094205:1.
