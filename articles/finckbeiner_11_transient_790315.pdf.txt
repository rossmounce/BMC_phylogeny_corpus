Abstract
Background: Despite detailed in vivo knowledge of glycolytic enolases and many bacterial non-enolase members
of the superfamily, little is known about the in vivo function of vertebrate non-enolase enolase superfamily
members (ENOSF1s). Results of previous studies suggest involvement of the b splice form of ENOSF1 in breast and
colon cancers. This study used the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a vertebrate model of ENOSF1b function.
Results: Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) showed that zebrafish ENOSF1b (enosf1b) is zygotic and
expressed ubiquitously through the first 24 hours post fertilization (hpf). After 24 hpf, enosf1b expression is
restricted to the notochord. Embryos injected with enosf1b-EGFP mRNA grew slower than EGFP mRNA-injected
embryos but caught up to the EGFP-injected embryos by 48 hpf. Embryos injected with ATG or exon 10 enosf1b
mRNA-targeting morpholinos had kinked notochords, shortened anterior-posterior axes, and circulatory edema.
WISH for ntl or pax2a expression showed that embryos injected with either morpholino have deformed notochord
and pronephros. TUNEL staining revealed increased apoptosis in the peri-notochord region.
Conclusions: This study is the first report of ENOSF1 function in a vertebrate and shows that ENOSF1 is required
for embryonic development. Increased apoptosis following enosf1b knockdown suggests a potential survival
advantage for increased ENOSF1b expression in human cancers.

Background
Sequence information and computational techniques can
be used to group proteins into evolutionarily meaningful
families and larger superfamilies. Dayhoff defined protein families as groups of proteins with high (>50%)
sequence identity [1]. Members of protein superfamilies
have lower sequence identities, but statistically significant pairwise alignment scores. Both protein families
and protein superfamilies are thought to be monophyletic [1-4]. Since Dayhoff’s original work, newer semiautomated classification schemes revealed thousands of
protein superfamilies [5,6]. The enolase superfamily
(ENOSF), named after the enolase of glycolysis, is used
as a model of protein superfamily evolution [4,7]. Members of the enolase superfamily share a common ENOSF
fold and catalyze a common half reaction: they all
abstract protons adjacent to carboxyl groups from a

wide array of substrates. Evolutionarily conserved acidic
residues, located in loops at the end of two of the b
sheets lining the C-terminal barrel of the ENOSF fold,
coordinate an essential magnesium and are shared by all
ENOSFs. Within the superfamily, different ENOSF
families are distinguishable by the identity of the third
magnesium ligand and by the different combinations of
general acid/base catalytic residues at the ends of the
remaining b sheets in the C-terminal barrel [4,7].
Two of the ENOSF families have representatives in
eukaryotes. The ubiquitous glycolytic enolases reversibly
dehydrate 2-phosphogylcerate to phosphoenolpyruvate
[7,8]. Despite being named for mandelate racemase
(MR), most members of the MR family with measured
enzymatic activities and x-ray structures are acid sugar
dehydratases. While many bacterial MR family members
have known activities and even x-ray structures with
bound ligands and inhibitors [9-20], little is known
about what roles MR family members perform in eukaryotes. Some fungi have catalytically active MR family
members that participate in a sugar metabolizing

pathway that allows these fungi to use the sugar rhamnose as a sole carbon source [21,22]. The next best studied group of eukaryotic MR family members are splice
isoforms of the human ENOSF1 protein. Human cancer
cell lines have three known ENOSF1 splice forms (a, b,
and g). Immunoblotting with polyclonal and monoclonal
antibodies shows that the b isoform (hsENOSF1b) is the
major protein product of the human ENOSF1 locus
[23,24]. In cell culture, hsENOSF1b expression appears
to be regulated by environmental factors such as cell
density, time in culture, and exposure to chemotherapy
drugs that affect thymidylate synthase or folate pathway
enzymes [23-27]. Using patient samples from a Taiwanese population, Kuo et al [28] showed that hsENOSF1b
is expressed in breast tumor tissue and not surrounding
tissue. The a or g splice forms were not found in the
patient samples [28]. The same group also reported a
statistically significant decrease in five year survival of
colon cancer patients with tumor hsENOSF1b expression compared to colon cancer patients without tumor
hsENOSF1b expression [29]. Taken together, in vitro
cell culture data [23-27] and human patient data [28,29]
suggest a connection between hsENOSF1b expression
and cancer.
In this study, we used the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an
in vivo model of ENOSF1b expression. Small adult size,
ease of spawning, and rapidly developing glass-clear
embryos make zebrafish attractive as a vertebrate model
for the study of genes with unknown function. Zebrafish
also have a sequenced genome, allowing for easy gene
finding and straightforward comparison of zebrafish
genes to human genes [30-33]. Building on a previously
published bioinformatics study [23], homology searches
of the zebrafish genome show that zebrafish have an
hsENOSF1b homologue (enosf1b). We show that enosf1b
is expressed ubiquitously early in development and is
then restricted primarily to notochord after the first 24
hours of development. Phenotypes resulting from
enosf1b knockdown by microinjection of enosf1b-targeted morpholino oligonucleotides provide evidence for
enosf1b’s involvement in normal development: enosf1bknockdown embryos have deformed notochords. Further
characterization with apoptosis and cell cycle markers
show that enosf1b-knockdown embryos have increased
cell death in the tissues surrounding the notochord,
while mitosis appears to be unaffected.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis reveals a complicated evolutionary
history for vertebrate ENOSF1b genes

Protein sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis can
be found in Additional file 1. The complete MUSCLE
alignment of all full length ENOSF1b homologues is
found in Additional File 2. BLASTP searches of NCBI

Page 2 of 15

and Ensembl databases followed by MUSCLE alignment
and phylogenetic tree construction reveal that the
ENOSF1b gene was likely present in the last common
ancestor of cephalochordates (Ciona sp, Figure 1) and
vertebrates and then lost in different vertebrate classes.
The anole (Anolis) has an ENOSF1b while no chicken
(Gallus) or zebra finch (Taeniopygia) ENOSF1b homologues were found. With the exception of the guinea pig
(Cavia), rodents as an order appear to have lost or are
losing their ENOSF1b homologues. The kangaroo rat
(Dipodomys) and 13-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus) have predicted ENOSF1b genes that are missing
exons found in other animals. Other sequences with
missing exons (Additional file 3) were excluded from
MUSCLE alignment and phylogenetic tree construction.
While the rabbit (Oryctolagus), guinea pig (Cavia), rat
(Rattus), and rhesus monkey (Macaca) genomes are predicted to contain a full length ENOSF1b homologue,
their predicted sequences are so divergent that they
branch away from their known evolutionary relatives
(Figure 1). The mouse, pig, and sheep do not have identifiable ENOSF1b homologue sequences in their
genomes.
The zebrafish genome contains one full length
homologue of hsENOSF1b

Using hsENOSF1b ([GenBank:NP_059982.2]) as the
query sequence, BLASTP searches of the latest version
of the zebrafish genome revealed a single full length
homologue of human hsENOSF1b, [GenBank:
NP_001070210.2], which we have named enosf1b.
Further bioinformatic searching of the zebrafish genome
with Ensembl genome viewer revealed that enosf1b is
located on linkage group 7, base pairs 59,391,419
through 59,891,418 (Figure 2A). The predicted zebrafish
ENOSF1b (drENOSF1b) protein is 71% identical to hsENOSF1b at the protein level. BLASTP searching of the
PDB [34] showed that the closest homologue of hsENOSF1b and drENOSF1b with a solved structure and
known biochemical activity is fuconate dehydratase
(FucD, [PDB:1YEY]) from the plant pathogenic bacteria
Xanthomonas campestris [12]. Alignments of protein
sequence with the bl2seq algorithm show that hsENOSF1b and drENOSF1b are 51% and 54% identical to
FucD, respectively. MUSCLE alignment of hsENOSF1b,
drENOSF1b, and FucD protein sequences (Figure 2B)
show that both vertebrate ENOSF1b proteins share residues required for coordinating magnesium and proton
abstraction in FucD [4,7,12].

and “enosf1b full length reverse”, Table 1) were used to
amplify enosf1b cDNA, with pooled RNA from multiple
developmental stages. The result shows that enosf1b is
expressed throughout early embryonic development
(Figure 3A). Sequencing of the RT-PCR products cloned
into pEGFP-N1 (p-enosf1b-N1-EGFP) confirmed the
identity of enosf1b (data not shown).
WISH performed with enosf1b antisense probe on
zygote through early cleavage stage embryos showed
that enosf1b was zygotic and expressed throughout the
early embryo (Figure 3B). Embryos undergoing early
somitogenesis (10 somites) ubiquitously expressed
enosf1b, while embryos in mid-somitogenesis (16
somites) had stronger expression in tissues such as the
eye, somite borders, and notochord (Figure 3B). Ubiquitous enosf1b expression decreased while notochord
enosf1b expression in 48 to 72 hpf embryos remained
(Figure 3C). At 96 hpf, there was faint notochord
enosf1b (see higher magnification panel in Figure 3C)
expression and expression in the pancreas (Figure 3C).

Overexpression of enosf1b-EGFP impairs embryonic
development

Following microinjection of EGFP mRNA, fluorescence
was visible throughout the embryos by epiboly and
through 48 hpf (Figure 4A-C). Embryos with microinjected enosf1b-EGFP mRNA demonstrated fluorescence
only in earlier stages but not at 48 hpf (Figure 4C).
When embryos were staged at 24 hpf, approximately
90% of uninjected and EGFP-injected embryos were the
correct stage. Only 20-40% of the enosf1b-EGFP-injected
embryos had reached the 24 hpf stage (Figure 4D, top
graphs); suggesting that they were developmentally
delayed. This delay was more severe when a higher dose
of enosf1b-EGFP was injected (40% for 60 pg/embryo
and 20% for 180 pg/embryo). When embryos of all
three groups were staged at 48 hpf, however, the delay
had disappeared. Interestingly, the proportionate recovery of correct stage by enosf1b-EGFP-injected embryos
at 48 hpf was accompanied by the loss of enosf1b-EGFP
fluorescence (Figure 4D, bottom graphs), which may

suggest that overexpressing enosf1b is not compatible
with normal embryonic growth.
Two separate enosf1b-targeting morpholinos generate
similar dose-dependent phenotypes

Embryos injected with enosf1b ATG MO at either 3.5 or
7 ng/embryo developed severe developmental defects
when compared to uninjected or standard controlinjected embryos. ATG MO-injected embryos had a
shortened anterior-posterior axis, pericardial edema, and
kinked notochords (Figure 5A). Embryos injected with
enosf1b e10i10 MO at the same concentrations developed
a similar phenotype, but of lesser severity (Figure 5A).
When compared to clutches of embryos injected with 3.5
ng of either MO, clutches of embryos injected with 7 ng
of either MO had a higher percentage of embryos with
the respective MO phenotypes: the percentage of
embryos with either phenotype for the respective MO is
dose dependent (Figure 5B, top panel). Embryos with the
phenotype of either MO died by 48 hpf.

The e10i10 morpholino causes mis-splicing of enosf1b

RT-PCR was used to assay the presence or absence of
altered enosf1b transcripts following injection of the
e10i10 MO. Using primers that flank exon 10 (primer
sequences in Table 1), PCR of cDNA from individual
standard control MO or e10i10 MO-injected embryos
(7ng/embryo, all at 48 hpf) revealed the presence of an
additional PCR product ~100 bp longer than the 804 bp
expected product (Figure 5C). Sequencing of the longer

mRNA and the ATG MO also decreased the percentage
of the embryos with the ATG phenotype (Figure 5D,
right panel, p = 0.0227).
Notochord and pronephros is deformed in both enosf1b
morphants

The notochord phenotype was confirmed by WISH for
the notochord-specific transcription factor no tail (ntl)
(Figure 6A, left). While approximately the same diameter and overall length, the notochord in e10i10 and
ATG MO-injected embryos is kinked multiple times.
The expression of a gene with a wider distribution pattern, pax2a, was unaffected in the brain and thymus primordium, slightly reduced in the prospective cranial
nerves and eye, but expanded in the pronephros in the
ATG morpholino-injected embryos (Figure 6A, right).

PCR product revealed insertion of intron 10 (Additional
file 4). This confirmed the presence of mis-splicing
induced by the e10i10 morpholino. As intron 10 contains an even number of base pairs (76 bp), its insertion
alters the reading frame of the 3’ end of enosf1b mRNA.
Injecting morpholinos into p53 mutant embryos does not
alter the ATG or e10i10 morpholino-induced phenotypes

The ATG, e10i10, and standard control MOs (all 7 ng/
embryo) were injected into p53-/- mutant embryos [35]
and control wild-type embryos. As shown in Figure 5B
(bottom panel), there is no statistically significant difference between the percentage of embryos with the ATG
or e10i10 phenotype in injected p53 mutant embryos
when compared to injected wild type embryos.
The morpholino phenotypes are specific to knock down
of enosf1b

Embryos were injected with enosf1b-EGFP mRNA alone
(60 pg/embryo), either ATG or e10i10 MO alone (7 ng/
embryo), or a combination of mRNA and one of the
MOs (final concentrations of 60 pg/embryo enosf1bEGFP mRNA and 7 ng/embryo MO). Figure 5D (left
panel) shows that coinjecting enosf1b-EGFP mRNA with
the e10i10 MO decreased the percentage of embryos
with the e10i10 phenotype. Results of unpaired Student’s
t test show that this decrease is statistically significant (p
value = 0.0380). In addition, coinjecting enosf1b-EGFP

Knockdown of enosf1b increases apoptosis but does not
change mitosis during zebrafish development

Results of TUNEL staining show that the area immediately surrounding the notochord had more apoptotic
cells in ATG and e10i10 MO-injected embryos when
compared to standard control injected and uninjected
embryos (Figure 6B-C). On the other hand, antibody
staining for a specific marker of mitotic cells, phosphorylated histone H3, did not change across the different experimental groups (Figure 6B-C).

Discussion
A previously published phylogenetics study of the
ENOSF1 gene [23] found ENOSF1 homologues in all
the major phyla except plants. Expanding on these
results, we used bioinformatics to find more animal
homologues of the ENOSF1 splice form associated with
increased cancer risk in human patients: hsENOSF1b
[28,29]. The overall topology of the ENOSF1b tree (Figure 1) follows the generally accepted model for evolution within chordates [36-40]. Birds apparently lost their
ENOSF1bs sometime after the last common ancestor of
reptiles and birds (Figure 1). Within the mammalian
clade, the branching pattern is dominated more by missing species and rodents that branch within other orders.
The rat and guinea pig ENOSF1bs should cluster
together with the rabbit ENOSF1b as outgroup. All
three sequences should be a sister group to the primates
([36,41], but see: [42,43]). The missing mouse ENOSF1b,
the diverged rat ENOSF1b, and “normal” ENOSF1b in
the guinea pig support the hypothesis that rodents are
losing their ENOSF1b genes. This is not as unusual as it
may first seem. A recently published study details the
loss of the motilin gene and its receptor during rodent
evolution [44]. On a broader scale, the work of Hahn
and colleagues measures this kind of loss (and gain)
across mammalian lineages and entire gene families [45].

Of the vertebrates typically used as model systems with a
clearly identifiable genomic ENOSF1b, the only diploid
species suitable for small scale laboratory work are the
zebrafish, Danio rerio, and the frog, Xenopus tropicalis. X.
tropicalis has less of the developed molecular biology
resources that make zebrafish such a widely used model
vertebrate [46]. Homology searches of the zebrafish genome show that zebrafish have a hsENOSF1b homologue
(enosf1b), the protein product of which (drENOSF1b) is
predicted to be 71% identical to human hsENOSF1b. The
predicted drENOSF1b has all the key features of the
human cancer-associated gene as well as a bacterial gene
with a known function: drENOSF1b and hsENOSF1b are
both close homologues (slightly > 50% sequence identity)
to the bacterial protein fuconate dehydratase (FucD) and

share the conserved residues needed for that enzyme’s catalytic activity (Figure 2B) [4,7,12].
Results of RT-PCR and WISH experiments also confirm that enosf1b is expressed during development (Figure 3A-C). The pattern of enosf1b loss during
development suggests involvement of drENOSF1 in
notochord function [47-49]. It should be noted that
there is still faint notochord expression at 4 dpf (see
higher magnification inset in 3C) that does not photograph well. While it appears that the notochord signal is
disappearing, it is possible that the decreased enosf1b
staining is due to lack of probe penetration. Embryos at
4 dpf are beginning to grow skin and are known for
having weaker staining of more medial tissues and
higher relative viscera staining [50].

Expression of enosf1b was manipulated during zebrafish development by injecting enosf1b-EGFP mRNA or
antisense morpholino oligonucleotides into 1-2 cell stage
embryos. Injection of enosf1b-EGFP mRNA into 1-2 cell
embryos led to a relatively weak gain-of-function

phenotype: developmental delay at 24 hpf (Figure 4A-C).
While EGFP-injected embryos were essentially identical
to uninjected embryos, significantly fewer enosf1b-EGFPinjected embryos had progressed to the same stage of
development as the control embryos. Interestingly, the

Finckbeiner et al. Cell & Bioscience 2011, 1:32
http://www.cellandbioscience.com/content/1/1/32

enosf1b-EGFP-injected embryos caught up to the EGFPinjected and uninjected embryos at 48 hpf, exactly when
the enosf1b-EGFP signal disappeared (Figure 4D). The
relatively mild gain-of-function phenotype can be
explained by instability of the enosf1b-EGFP mRNA and/
or the enosf1b-EGFP protein [51,52].
Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides were used to
generate enosf1b loss-of-function phenotypes. Multiple
lines of evidence show that the knockdown phenotypes
observed are specific to enosf1b knockdown. First, two
morpholinos that target different evolutionarily conserved regions of the enosf1b transcript led to similar
phenotypes (Additional file 5 and Figure 5A). The second line of evidence supporting the specificity of the
observed knockdown phenotypes is provided by RTPCR for enosf1b following injection of the e10i10 morpholino. Single embryo RT-PCR shows that embryos
with the e10i10 phenotype express a longer transcript
(Figure 5C). Sequencing the longer product revealed
that intron 10 is inserted into the mis-spliced e10i10
transcript (see Additional file 4). Insertion of intron 10
should cause frame shift of the remaining coding
sequence. This effectively removes 4 of the 8 evolutionarily conserved catalytic residues (see Figure 2). The third
line of evidence supporting the enosf1b-specificity of the
morpholino phenotypes is provided by the results of
injecting the morpholinos into p53 mutant embryos.
Some morpholino phenotypes, particularly brain apoptosis, were shown to be caused by a p53-mediated antisense response [53]. The p53 mutant line expresses the
full length p53 but has a mutation in the transactivation
domain and cannot initiate p53-dependent transcription
[35]. Enosf1b-targeting morpholino-injected p53 mutant
embryos are indistinguishable from morpholino-injected
wild type embryos (Figure 5B, bottom panel). The fourth
line of evidence supporting the enosf1b-specificity of the
morpholino-induced phenotypes is the results of the
mRNA-morpholino coinjection, or rescue, experiments.
Coinjecting enosf1b and either of the two morpholinos
“rescues” or decreases the morpholino-induced phenotype (Figures 5D).
The most striking visibly observable characteristic of
both morpholino-induced phenotypes is the kinked
notochord. WISH shows that enosf1b is strongly
expressed in notochord between late somitogenesis and
48 hpf. WISH for a notochord-specific gene, no tail
[54], clearly highlights the severely deformed notochord
in enosf1b morpholino knockdown embryos (Figure 6A).
The salient feature of the knockdown phenotypes produced by different anti-enosf1b, a kinked notochord by
48 hpf, is precisely where and when enosf1b is highly
expressed. WISH for Pax2a [55] was also performed.
Pax2a is a transcription factor that is involved in development of the eye, brain, cranial neurons, thyroid

Page 9 of 15

primordium, and pronephros. The WISH data for pax2a
suggests that enosf1b is involved in the normal development of some of those tissues.
Other assays performed on anti-enosf1b morpholinoinjected embryos also reveal changes in the peri-notochord tissues. When compared to standard control
injected or uninjected embryos, anti-enosf1b morpholino-injected embryos have increased TUNEL staining
[56] in the peri-notochord tissues. The increased apoptosis is apparently not dependent on a stalled cell cycle.
Whole mount antibody staining for an accepted proliferation marker, phospho-histone H3 (pH3) shows that
there is no visible change in the cell cycle in enosf1bknockdown embryos (Figure 6B). Experimental embryos
had equivalent pH3 staining, indicating no change in
achieving M-phase. The TUNEL and phospho-histone
H3 (pH3) results for uninjected embryos shown in Figure 6B are similar to TUNEL results reported elsewhere
[56,57]. Additional support for a cell cycle-independent
increase in apoptosis is provided by the previously
described p53-independence of the morpholino-induced
phenotypes (Figure 5B, bottom panel). Increased apoptosis following enosf1b knockdown is especially interesting given the recent clinical studies implicating human
ENOSF1b as a risk factor for two separate cancers
[28,29]. Perhaps increased ENOSF1b confers a survival
advantage on tumour cells by interfering with apoptosis
[58-61].
The increased apoptosis is limited to the area around
the notochord (see especially e10i10 panel in Figure 6B).
There are two possible explanations for this change.
First, enosf1b could be involved in production of a prosurvival signal or consumption of a pro-death signal by
the notochord. When enosf1b-targeting morpholinos are
injected, enosf1b decreases and the pro-survival signal
disappears or the pro-death signal increases, leading to
increased apoptosis. This idea fits with previous discovery of a soluble signal produced by hsENOSF1b-overexpressing drug resistant cancer cells [62] and the known
signalling role of the notochord. In addition to providing
structural support for the developing embryo, the notochord secretes soluble signalling proteins like hedgehog
which is known to be involved in inducing formation of
the ventral neural tube [49,63]. Notochord-produced
hedgehog probably also plays a role in somite differentiation and inhibition of cardiac mesoderm fate in paraxial mesoderm. Removing the notochord, or interfering
with hedgehog signalling, also interferes with pancreas
development [48,49]. In addition to hedgehog, notochords of different species are known to secrete many
soluble proteins and growth factors like BMPs, TGFbs,
and FGFs [47,49]. A simpler but no less interesting possibility can explain the increased peri-notochord
increase in apoptosis: that is where enosf1b expression is

low enough to be affected by morpholino knockdown.
Cells with decreased enosf1b cannot survive and die.

they reached the desired stage.

Conclusions
Given the recent publications identifying hsENOSF1b
expression as a risk factor in at least two human cancers
[28,64], developing an in vivo animal model of
ENOSF1b takes on added importance. The results of
the WISH study presented here represent the first time
a vertebrate ENOSF1b has been visualized in an intact
model organism. The results of the mRNA and morpholino experiments are the first overexpression and knockdown phenotypes reported for a vertebrate ENOSF1b.
One of our major findings, increased apoptosis following
in vivo ENOSF1 knockdown, has implications for cancer
therapy. Given the results of the clinical studies of
[28,64] and in vitro cell culture data [23-27,62,65], it is
not unreasonable to hypothesize that targeting ENOSF1
catalytic activity or possible interactions with other proteins may lead to increased apoptosis in tumours.

Whole mount In Situ Hybridization (WISH)

Methods
Phylogenetics and bioinformatics

BLASTP [66-68], used within NCBI map viewer [68]
and Ensembl genome browser [69], was used to find the
protein sequences of vertebrate homologues of hsENOSF1b in the latest genome version available. Ensembl
genome browser was used to locate the chromosomal
location of enosf1b, and to identify exon/intron boundaries [69]. Top scoring BLAST hits were used to search
the Zebrafish Gene Collection (ZGC, [70]) full length
clone library. The hsENOSF1b sequence, [Genbank:
NP_059982.2], was used to search the Protein Data
Bank [34] for homologues with known function. The
program bl2seq was used to calculate percent identity
[67,71]. MUSCLE (2 iterations, CLUSTALW output)
was used to align nucleotide and protein sequences and
to generate phylogenetic trees [72]. JalView was used to
visualize alignments [73]. NEBCutter was used to plan
subcloning experiments [74].
Zebrafish husbandry

Zebrafish were maintained and used following approved
NHGRI ACUC protocols. Adult wild type zebrafish (EK
strain) and p53-/- mutant zebrafish [35] were maintained in a recirculating aquaculture system at 28.5°C
and a 14:10 light:dark cycle per Westerfield [75]. Single
adults were separated with plastic dividers in individual
pair breeding boxes (Dura-Cross, LPS Inc. Rochester
NY) the night before spawning. At first light, the divider
was pulled and the adults were allowed to spawn naturally. Eggs were manually separated from the adults,
rinsed free of faeces and debris, and raised at 28.5°C in
embryo media (480 mg Instant Ocean salts, 16 mL

A ZGC cDNA clone corresponding to a truncated zebrafish homologue of human ENOSF1b (enosf1b) in the
vector pME18S-FL (p-enosf1b) was purchased from a
commercial supplier (OPEN Biosystems, Hunstville,
AL). Following confirmatory sequencing in the NHGRI
zebrafish core, MUSCLE alignment of this sequence to
the identified full length zebrafish homologue of hsENOSF1b showed that the 3’ end of this clone contained
multiple gaps of non-existent homology and a polyA
tail. As multiple regions with gaps and polyA tails are
not conducive to successful WISH [50], a fragment of
the clone with better homology to the 5’ end of enosf1b
was created. The XhoI-EcoRV fragment (532 bp) of penosf1b was subcloned into pBluescript SK(-) producing
the plasmid used to make enosf1b riboprobe: pBSenosf1b-5’ (see Additional File 6 for MUSCLE alignments illustrating this process). Plasmids containing
sequences for no tail [54] and Pax2a [55] were kind
gifts of Dr. Milton English (NIH, National Eye Institute).
Linearized plasmids were used to generate antisense or
sense digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled riboprobes using T3 or
T7 polymerase RNA labelling kits (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN). Riboprobes were purified free of salts and enzymes
using a Megaclear kit (Ambion, Austin TX). Embryos
were staged according to Kimmel et al [76] and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight (4% PFA/PBS) at
4°C. Embryos younger than 24 hours post fertilization
(hpf) were manually dechorionated with watchmaker
forceps after fixation. All reagents for the WISH procedure were purchased from Sigma. WISH was performed
as in Thisse and Thisse [50].
Morpholino (MO) antisense oligonucleotide design

MOs were purchased as lyophilized powders from GeneTools (Philomath, Oregon). In addition to the FITCtagged standard control MO (abbreviated here as “std
ctrl,”, see [77]), two MOs that target different evolutionarily conserved regions of the enosf1b transcript or
pre-mRNA were also obtained (Table 2). The FITCtagged MO designated “ATG” targets the conserved
ATG in exon 2 of the processed enosf1b transcript. The
FITC-tagged MO designated “e10i10” targets the
Table 2 Morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MO)
sequences used in this study.

exon10-intron10 splice junction (e10i10) in enosf1b premRNA. Exon 10 was chosen for targeting by spliceblocking MO because it contains 3 conserved residues
necessary for catalysis in other members of the MR
family. Alignments of the protein products of the conserved regions targeted by the two morpholinos can be
found in Additional file 5. Morpholino sequences (Table
2) were in silico tested for specificity by using the
BLASTN program [67,71] to search for alternative targets in the zebrafish genome. Morpholinos were resuspended in RNase-free water and quantified using a
NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific) following
quantification instructions. Immediately before use,
diluted MOs were heated at 65°C for 10 minutes.
Diluted MOs were then stored at room temperature
until injected.
RT-PCR

Twenty zebrafish embryos each at the following stages:
1-8 cell, 25-50% epiboly, 5-20 somites, 24-48 hpf, and
72-96 hpf were dechorionated in pronase when needed
and anesthetized in Tricaine per Westerfield [75].
Embryos were rinsed 3 times in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS), drained of all residual PBS, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. To assay
developmental expression of enosf1b, staged embryos
were thawed on ice, homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad CA), and total RNA purified per Trizol package instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was used to prepare
cDNA using a SuperScript III kit (also Invitrogen). Full
length protein coding sequence of the zebrafish homologue of hsENOSF1 was PCR-amplified ("Full length” primers in Table 1) using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA) and a step down
PCR protocol: 94°C, 10 minutes; 40 cycles of 94°C/30 s,
62°C/30 s, 72°C/60 s (annealing temperature was
decreased 0.5°C/cycle the first 7 cycles to a final annealing temperature of 58°C); 72°C for 60 s. To clone full
length enosf1b for construction of an in vitro transcription vector, full length protein coding sequence of
enosf1b was PCR amplified using a proof-reading polymerase (Platinum Pfx, Invitrogen) and primers designed
to add a 5’ XhoI site, a Kozak sequence, and a 3’ SacII
site to the PCR product (primer sequences in Table 1,
PCR conditions same as above). To quantify mis-spliced
enosf1b following e10i10 MO injection, single standard
control injected or e10i10 MO-injected embryos were
processed to total cDNA using a scaled down version of
the Trizol protocol outlined above. Primers flanking
enosf1b exon 10 (Table 1) were used in PCRs on the
same samples [78]. Twenty percent of PCR reactions
were run on precast 1% Tris-Borate-EDTA agarose gels
containing ethidium bromide. Gels were photographed

under UV light. Mis-spliced exon 10 PCR products were
sequenced in the NHGRI zebrafish core.
In vitro transcription of capped EGFP-polyA and enosf1bEGFP-polyA mRNA

Following digestion with XhoI and SacII, enosf1b was
ligated into pEGFP-N1 previously digested with XhoI
and SacII, generating enosf1b fused in frame to the Nterminus of EGFP (p-enosf1b-N1-EGFP). P-enosf1b-N1EGFP was sequenced in the NHGRI zebrafish core to
verify that enosf1b was being amplified and for absence
of PCR-induced mutations (sequencing data available
upon request). The NheI/NotI fragment of p-enosf1bN1-EGFP was subcloned downstream of the T7 promoter of pcDNA3.1(-) (pcDNA3.1-enosf1b-EGFP-polyA).
The NheI/NotI fragment of pEGFP-N1 was also subcloned downstream of the T7 promoter of pcDNA3.1(-)
(pcDNA3.1-EGFP-polyA).
Both pcDNA3.1-EGFP-polyA and pcDNA3.1-enosf1bEGFP-polyA were linearized 3’ of the polyadenylation
signal sequence and phenol/chloroform extracted to
remove restriction enzyme. The linearized plasmids
were then ethanol precipitated (post-digest cleanup per
[51]), resuspended in nuclease-free H 2 O, and used as
templates for in vitro transcription (mMessage mMachine T7 Ultra in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin TX)). Transcribed mRNA was phenol/chloroform
extracted [78] and quantified on an ND-1000 Nanodrop
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The mRNA was
ethanol precipitated [78], resuspended in nuclease-free
H2O, and stored in aliquots at -80°C until use.
Embryo microinjection

Glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, 1 mm
inside diameter with filament) were pulled on a Kopf
730 vertical capillary puller. Using a sequencing gel
loading pipette tip, capillaries were back-filled with
enosf1b-GFP or GFP mRNA. Pulled capillaries were broken to a narrow tip with a razor blade under a stereomicroscope, calibrated in mineral oil [51], and used to
inject 0.4 nL pulses of in vitro transcribed mRNA into
the blastomeres of 1-2 cell embryos. The same procedure was used to prepare MO injection capillaries. For
MO injection, the injection volume was adjusted to 1.4
nL and the injection target was the cytoplasmic streamers immediately ventral to the blastomeres of 1-2 cell
embryos. Coinjections for rescue experiments used the
injection volume for mRNA injection. Concentrations of
stock mRNA and stock MOs were adjusted to achieve
the final concentrations listed in Results above. Following microinjection, embryos were raised at 28.5°C and
periodically photographed using a Leica MZ16F stereomicroscope with GFP epifluorescence optics.

Scoring microinjection phenotypes and statistics

Fluorescence of EGFP and enosf1b-EGFP mRNAinjected embryos was scored at tailbud stage the night
of the day of injection. GFP-negative embryos in
injected clutches were discarded. GFP was assessed and
stage was scored for surviving embryos at 24 and 48 hpf.
FITC-negative embryos in MO-injected clutches were
discarded the night of injection. FITC-positive embryos
were scored for MO-induced phenotypes daily until
there were no surviving embryos (usually 48 hpf). “ATG
phenotype” was defined as decreased anterior-posterior
axis, severe notochord kinks and pericardial edema.
“E10i10 phenotype” was defined as mild to severe notochord kinks and pericardial edema. Because the FITCtagged MO masked the GFP signal, coinjection and
MO-injected embryos were both treated as MO-injected
the first day: fluorescence-negative embryos were discarded the night of the injection. Control mRNAinjected embryos were scored as described above. Percentage embryos in each clutch were scored for MOinduced phenotype using the criteria described above.
All data values shown in the figures below are the average of three experiments with standard deviation bars.
Total “n” values are the totals of the three independent
experiments. When necessary, two-tailed Student’s t test
was used to calculate p values. All statistics and tests
were calculated in Microsoft Excel.

RT. Equilibration buffer was removed and replaced with
working enzyme solution (50-100 μL of liquid per 20
embryos). Embryos in working enzyme solution were
incubated on a heat block at 37°C for 60 minutes with
300 RPM agitation. While incubating in enzyme, Apoptag Stop/Wash concentrate was thawed and diluted to
working Stop/Wash solution (1 mL concentrate + 34
mL ddH2O). Enzyme was removed and replaced with 1
mL of diluted Stop/Wash solution. Embryos were incubated in Stop/Wash solution at RT for 60 minutes with
agitation. Stop/Wash solution was then washed off in 3
10 minute PBT washes with agitation. The last wash
was aspirated and replaced with anti-DIG horseradish
peroxidase conjugated monoclonal antibody (provided
in the Apoptag kit) diluted 1:9,000 in blocking buffer
(2% Roche blocking reagent, 10% lamb serum, and 1%
DMSO in ddH2O). Embryos were incubated in anti-DIG
antibody overnight at 4°C. Antibody was removed and
embryos were washed 4 times in PBT for 10 minutes at
RT. Washed embryos were stained in Tris-buffered
DAB, (3,3’-Diaminobenzidine: SigmaFast, Sigma-Aldrich)
for 5 minutes at RT in the dark. Immediately after staining, embryos were fixed in 4% PFA/PBS. Tails of
TUNEL-stained embryos were photographed as
described for WISH above. TUNEL-positive spots above
the yolk sac extension (YSE) were counted for 3
embryos from each condition. Statistics were performed
as above.

Whole mount TUNEL assay

The protocol used is modified from the package instructions of the Apoptag TUNEL kit (Chemicon, see also:
[56,57]). Fixed 36 hpf embryos, in microcentrifuge
tubes, were gradually dehydrated in five minute room
temperature (RT) washes of 25%, 50%, 75%, ethanol/
PBS. After two 100% ethanol washes, the embryos were
stored overnight at -20°C. Embryos were then rehydrated to PBT (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) by reversing
the order of the washes above. Embryos were washed an
additional 2 times in 100% PBT and then bleached in
3% peroxide in PBT for 10 minutes at RT. After bleaching, embryos were washed in PBT 3 times for 10 minutes each at RT. Embryos were then permeabilized by
adding 5 uL of 2 mg/mL proteinase K to the final PBT
wash (final volume 1 mL) and incubating for 10 minutes
at RT. Proteinase K was aspirated and permeabilized
embryos were washed twice in PBT (7 minutes at RT)
and then post-fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 15 minutes at
RT. Trace amounts of PFA were removed by exhaustive
PBT washes (five - five minute washes at RT). While
washing in PBT, Apoptag equilibration and reaction buffers were thawed. Working enzyme solution was made
(154 μL reaction buffer + 66 μL enzyme per tube
assayed). The last of the 5 PBT washes was aspirated
and replaced with equilibration buffer for 20 minutes at

Whole mount phosphohistone-H3 (pH3) antibody staining

PH3 staining protocol was developed from the protocol
of [57]. Embryos (36 hpf) were fixed in 4% PFA/PBS as
above. Following fixation, PFA/PBS was aspirated and
embryos were incubated in ice cold acetone for seven
minutes, followed by a brief rinse in ddH2O. Embryos
were then washed in PBT (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) two
times for five minutes at RT. The last PBT wash was
aspirated and replaced with blocking buffer (2% Roche
blocking reagent, 10% lamb serum, and 1% DMSO in
ddH2O). Embryos were blocked for 30 minutes at RT.
While blocking, rabbit anti-pH3 polyclonal antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer. After blocking, embryos were incubated in
diluted anti-pH3 antibody overnight at 4°C. Antibody in
blocking buffer was aspirated and embryos were washed
in 4 15 minute PBT washes at RT. While washing, goat
anti-rabbit HRP conjugated secondary antibody was
diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. The last wash was
aspirated and embryos were incubated in diluted antirabbit secondary antibody for two hours at RT with gentle agitation. Secondary antibody was aspirated and
embryos were washed in 4 15 minute PBT washes at
RT. Embryos were then stained in DAB, fixed in PFA,
and photographed as described above for WISH. PH3-
