Abstract
Background: Bovine Tuberculosis (BTB) is a widespread and endemic disease of cattle in Ethiopia. Information relating
to genotypic characteristics of Mycobacterium bovis strains affecting the cattle population in Ethiopia is limited. We
carried out molecular characterization of M. bovis strains isolated from BTB infected cattle using the spoligotyping
technique. The relationship between distribution of spoligotypes and recorded variables was also investigated. A new
approach that can numerically reflect the degree of genetic polymorphism in a M. bovis population was also
developed. The study was conducted from July 2006 to January 2007 in cattle slaughtered at five representative
abattoirs in Ethiopia.
Results: Forty-five M. bovis isolates were obtained from 406 pathologic tissue specimens collected from 337 carcasses
with lesions compatible with BTB. Twelve spoligotypes were identified from 34 distinct strains; with SB1176 as a
dominant spoligotype (41.2% of the isolates) followed by SB0133 (14.7%). Comparison of spoligotypes with an M. bovis
global database http://www.mbovis.org revealed six new spoligotypes which were subsequently registered in the
database with international identification codes of SB1517, SB1518, SB1519, SB1520, SB1521 and SB1522. The majority
of strains were obtained from cattle slaughtered at Addis Ababa abattoir. On the basis of the Spoligotype Evolutionary
Index, SEI (a numeric expression approach to make standardized comparison of spoligotype evolution), M. bovis
isolates from Ethiopia were relatively more heterogeneous (SEI = 3.2) compared to isolates from other countries. This
might be attributed to extensive livestock movement linked to trading or seasonal migration, high degree of livestock
mingling, and also diversities of the country's agricultural and livestock ecosystems, in addition to lack of disease
control measures that led to high infection prevalence. Multiple spoligotype infection was recorded in nine (50%) of
infected carcasses and this may indicate the prevailing high degree of super infection.
Conclusions: This study provided molecular evidence for the widespread distribution of M. bovis in the cattle
population in Ethiopia. It also demonstrated a relatively high degree of genetic polymorphism of the isolates. Further
molecular investigation of M. bovis strains in humans and other domestic animals is recommended in order to
elucidate the zoonotic importance as well as reservoirs and pattern of transmission among various hosts.
Background
Ethiopia, a country whose economy is largely dependent
on agriculture, possesses the largest livestock resource in
Africa. Livestock sector contributes about 18% of the
national GDP and 30% of the agricultural employment
[1]. However, infectious diseases, accounting for 30-50%
of the total annual losses [2], remain a major impediment
to Ethiopia's livestock economy. Bovine tuberculosis

(BTB) is an important infectious disease of Ethiopian cattle whose existence has been documented in almost all
parts of the country. No recognizable control programs
are implemented except the routine abattoir inspection
that involves whole or partial condemnation of infected
carcasses for the purpose of protecting consumers'
health. Even then, routine meat inspection procedures
with qualified professionals are only practised in a handful of municipal and export abattoirs throughout the
country. It is estimated that more than half of slaughtered
animals each year are illegally processed in backyard system without undergoing proper inspection, thus posing a

great health risk to the consumers. This is further exacerbated by the low sensitivity of routine meat inspection to
detect carcasses with tuberculosis lesions, and subsequently infected meat can get approved for human consumption [3].
Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), the causative agent of
BTB, is a member of the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis
Complex (MTC) that also includes M. tuberculosis, M.
africanum, M. canetti and M. microti. BTB is a worldwide
animal health problem and remains a major threat to
public health in countries in which people live in close
proximity with their cattle and where milk is not pasteurized [4,5]. The correlation between the prevalence of M.
bovis infection in humans and in local cattle populations
highlights the potential threat of this disease to humans
[5]. BTB also has a significant socio-economic impact, as
it can affect international trade of animals and animal
products [6].
Traditional characterization of bacterial pathogens is
becoming increasingly unsuitable for modern epidemiology because it is based on variable phenotypes that are
not necessarily related to genetic descent [7]. In the last
decades, fast, easy and sensitive methods based on the
detection of genetic diversities of Mycobacterium species
and typing of individual strains for epidemiological analysis have been developed [8]. Molecular methods have
become very tightly integrated with traditional epidemiological tracing of tuberculosis and provide a paradigm for
such integration at the local and international levels [7].
Several typing techniques have been used to characterize
isolates of M. bovis, with IS6110 restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP), spoligotyping and multilocus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) as
the most frequently used.
Spoligotyping is a PCR based technique that detects
polymorphism within the genomic direct repeat (DR)
locus which consists of multiple sequences interspersed
with non-repetitive spacer sequences (spacers) [9]. It is
well suited for epidemiological studies of M. bovis isolates, as it has a high level of discriminatory ability allowing disclosure of several epidemiological relationships
[10]. Simplicity and reproducibility of the method has
helped to establish an international M. bovis spoligotype
database http://www.mbovis.org (designed and managed
by Noel Smith and Rainer Hilscher and hosted on University of Sussex servers) that enables the recognition of
new and emerging strains as well as comparison of geospatial distribution and spread of specific strains.
Even though Ethiopia is one of the countries in Africa
with a high prevalence of BTB, there is limited information about the genotypic characteristics of M. bovis
strains infecting animals and in-contact human communities. In addition to its use in designing a more targeted
control measure, the availability of such information

would help study phylogenetic characteristics of the
organism that in turn provide new insight into the natural
history of BTB [11].
The aim of this study was to use spoligotyping tool to
characterise M. bovis strains causing BTB in Ethiopian
cattle. Secondly, to perform a comparative evaluation of
the degree of genetic polymorphism of DR regions in M.
bovis populations based on a new approach of numerical
expression referred to as Spoligotype Evolutionary Index
(SEI).

Methods
Detection of tuberculosis infections by detailed necropsy
examination

During July 2006 to January 2007, carcasses of 3322 cattle
of different age groups, sex, breeds and classes/types
(bull, cow, calf or steer) were subjected to detailed
necropsy examinations for the detection of gross lesions
compatible with BTB. The animals originated from six
geographic regions across the country and were slaughtered at five abattoirs including four Municipal (Addis
Ababa, Adama, Hawassa and Yabello) and one export
(Melge-Wondo) abattoirs. For technical procedures of
detailed necropsy examinations of carcasses, the readers
are referred to the previously published paper from the
same study [3].
Collection of specimens

A total of 406 pathologic tissue specimens were collected
aseptically from 27 different tissues/organs of 337 carcasses suspected to have been infected with TB. These
included lymph nodes such as tracheobronchial, parotid,
retropharyngeal, mediastinal, mesenteric, submaxilliary,
precrural, prescapular, supramammary, inguinal, apical,
ischiatic, iliac sternal and portal and organs/tissues such
as lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, mammary tissue, intestines, heart and inter-costal muscles, abdominal and thoracic membranes, meninges and vertebral bones. The
specimens were labelled and sealed separately, and temporarily stored at -20°C in the veterinary division of the
Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), or in health centres of the
respective districts where the abattoirs were located. Collected specimens were brought together and kept temporarily at the laboratory facilities of the Mycobacteriology
Division of the Infectious Disease Department of the
Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute
(EHNRI), Addis Ababa, before being transferred to a
BSL-3 laboratory at the National Veterinary Institute,
Oslo, Norway for the necessary mycobacteriological analysis.
Culturing and identification of mycobacteria

Specimen processing and culturing for isolation of mycobacteria was carried out following standard procedure

Biffa et al. BMC Veterinary Research 2010, 6:28
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/6/28

described by OIE [12]. Presumptive mycobacterial colonies (based on growth rate, colony characteristic and
detection of acid fast bacilli by the Ziehl-Neelsen staining
technique) were further subjected to Accu-Probe Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex (MTC) culture identification test as described in the manufacturer's manual
(Gene-Probe, Inc. San Diego, California, USA). This
rapid DNA probe test is based on the ability of a chemiluminescent labelled probe of single-stranded DNA to
complement with ribosomal RNA of mycobacteria which
form a stable DNA-RNA hybrid. Positive and negative
control strains of M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) and M. avium
(ATCC 25291) were obtained from the mycobacterium
culture collection of the National Veterinary Institute,
Oslo.
Spoligotyping

Isolation and purification of chromosomal (template)
DNA from the mycobacterial culture was done using
cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) method as
described in the manual for spoligotyping (Isogen, Life
Science, The Netherlands). Briefly, a loopful of mycobacterial colonies grown on Stonebrinck Media was heatinactivated by incubation at 80°C for 20 min in 400 μl of
1× TE buffer. The cells were lysed by lysozyme, SDS and
proteinase K solution. Purification was carried out by
adding CTAB/NaCl solution and incubating at 65°C for
10 min. After adding 750 μl of chloroform and centrifuging for 5 min at 13,000 rpm (Mikr020, Hettich-Zentrifugen, Germany), the aqueous supernatant was transferred
into fresh micro centrifuge tubes and mixed with isopropanol and centrifuged for 15 min. The precipitated DNA
pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol. The pellet was eventually dried for 30 min and redissolved in 20 μl of 1×TE
buffer. The concentration and purity of extracted DNA
was measured using nanodrop spectrophotometer
(Thermo scientific Nanodrop™ 1000, Wilmington, Delaware, USA).
Spoligotyping of the 48 MTC isolates was carried out at
the National Reference Laboratory for Mycobacteria,
Division of Infectious Disease Control, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway as described in the
manual (Isogen). Amplification of the spacer DNA was
carried out in a Corbett thermal cycler (Biotech International) using 30 cycles of DNA denaturation for 1 min at
96°C; annealing for 1 min at 55°C and elongation for 30
sec at 72°C. The presence of amplified products was visualized by electrophoresis at 100 V for 30 min in a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). The
amplified spacers were then hybridized with the known
oligonucleotide spacers ligated to the membrane (Isogen).
Hybridization was performed by incubating the membrane at 60°C for 1 hr. Hybridized DNA was detected by

Page 3 of 11

incubating the membrane in 40 ml of ECL detection liquid (Amersham, Bioscience, UK) for 1 min and visualized
by exposure of a light sensitive film for 20 min (Hyper
film TM ECL, Amersham Bioscience, UK). The membrane was then analyzed by recording the presence or
absence of signals at the sites of the individual probes. M.
tuberculosis (H37Rv) and M. bovis BCG P3, which were
obtained from the National Institute of Public Health,
Oslo, Norway, were included as controls.
Data collection and analysis

Animal factors believed to be associated with BTB were
recorded. These included age, sex, type (class) and breed.
Cattle were classified as young (<6 years) and old (>6
years) based on dentition characteristics [13] and/or
information obtained from animal owners or farm
records. Geographic origin of the animals and the system
under which they were managed were also recorded.
Depending on characteristics and body distribution,
lesions were categorized as localised or generalised.
Fisher's exact test was used to investigate possible associations between distribution of specific spoligotypes and
variables such as breed, geographic origin, management
system and type/severity of lesions. For this purpose, isolates from same carcass showing identical spoligotypes
were considered as one strain, and infected animals were
assumed to originate from different farms.
Differentiation of M. bovis strains by spoligotyping was
done based on the binary system as described by Dale et
al. [14]. The results were entered in a computer-based
strain identification system described in central database
website http://www.mbovis.org. Strains with a code that
had not been described previously were considered as
new. The spoligotyping results were analysed using Bionumerics software program version 5 (Applied Maths,
Kortrijk, Belgium). The dendrogram and strain clustering
were generated by the unweighted-pair group method
with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA). The optimization and
tolerance were set at 1.00%. A cluster was defined as a
group of isolates with ≥ 90% genetic similarities. A dataset for individual variables and spoligotypes was established in an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel 2003).
Frequency distribution of spoligotypes with respect to
abattoir was presented graphically using clustered column with a 3-D visual effect chart. The association
between spoligotype distribution and putative factors
was investigated using Fisher's exact test (two tailed). Distribution of multiple spoligotypes with respect to abattoir, geographic origin and individual characteristics of
animal is presented in tabular form.
Discriminatory power of the spoligotyping method was
established by calculating Hunter-Gaston Diversity Index
(HGDI) [15] using the in silico website of the university of

of distinct spoligotypes; n is number of unrelated strains
(identical spoligotypes isolated from same carcass were
considered as one); xj is frequency of ith spoligotype.
Comparison of genetic polymorphisms within the M. bovis
population

In order to compare the genetic similarity or difference
occurring among the populations (sets of isolates) of
Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex (MTC) isolates
obtained from various geographic regions across the
globe, the Spoligotype Evolutionary Index (SEI) was
developed and employed. The SEI is a numerical expression approach that helps to make standardized comparison of spoligotype diversities and the extent of evolution
of DR regions as described by the number of spacers
absent.

SEI =

⎞⎤
S ⎡

N⎢

⎠⎦
⎣ i=1 ⎝

∑

(1) ;

K ≤ SEI < ∞; K > 0

Where;
S = Number of distinct spoligotypes
N = Number of strains (unrelated)
sdith = No. of spacers absent in the nth spoligotype
sdc = No. of spacers absent in the control strain
O = Total oligonucleotide spacers
f (ith) = Frequency of ith spoligotype
K = Constant (proportion of spacers absent in the
control strain)
Accordingly, for M. bovis BCG (reference strain) the
number of spacers absent (sdc) = 8; O = 43 and K = 8/43 =
0.18. Then equation 1 is reduced to the following expression for comparison of genetic polymorphisms of DR
region within M. bovis isolates obtained from different
geographic regions/countries.

SEI =

S ⎡

⎛ sdi th −8
⎞⎤
× f (i th ) ⎟ ⎥ + 0.18 (2); 0.18 ≤ SEI < ∞
⎟⎥
43
⎠⎦

∑ ⎜⎜⎝
i =1

Interpretation of SEI is based on comparing values with
the" ancestral"/reference strain (M. bovis BCG) whose SEI
score is equal to 0.18 (the lowest value a spoligotype can
have) indicating the minimum change that can happen to
DR region (as reflected by presence/absence of spacers).
SEI can assume any absolute number between 0.18 and

∞. Therefore, the closer the value of SEI to 0.18, the lower
the polymorphism of DR region of a given sets of spoligotypes. Similarly, the higher the value of SEI, the higher the
polymorphism of DR in a given set of strains (several spoligotypes with many missing spacers). This shows that
even if a spoligotype with few spacers deleted (for example SB0120/M. bovis BCG) occurs in a high frequency, its
SEI score is 0.18 suggesting that it has undergone a slight
or no polymorphism in DR region. On the other hand,
higher SEI score is a desirable characteristic of sets of
many spoligotypes with high polymorphism in DR
region.

Results
Of 406 tissue specimens collected and cultured, 25.9%
(105/406) yielded mycobacteria. Out of these, 48 isolates
were found to belong to MTC by the AccuProbe method.
Spoligotyping identified 45 of the MTC isolates from 18
cattle carcasses as M. bovis by lack of spacers 3, 9, 16 and
39-43, a unique property that distinguishes most M. bovis
strains from other members of the group. Three isolates
did not yield any results with spoligotyping (absence of
hybridization signals).
Both control strains yielded standard patterns of spacer
arrangements; absence of spacers 20-21 and 33-36 and
presence of spacers 39-43 for M. tuberculosis H37Rv and
absence of spacers 3, 9, 16 and 39-43 for M. bovis BCG
P3.
Figure 1 presents spoligotype patterns and frequency of
occurrence of M. bovis spoligotypes in the whole material. Considering identical spoligotypes from the same
animal as one, a total of 34 unrelated strains were identified. The strains were grouped into 12 spoligotypes: All
lacked other spacers in addition to those characteristic of
spoligotype SB0120. SB1176, the most frequently isolated
spoligotype (41.2%), was characterized by absence of
spacers 4-7, 24-26 and 28-37. SB0133, the second most
frequently isolated (14.1%), was much closer to M. bovis
BCG except that it lacked spacers 4-7. SB1517 (characterized by absence of spacers 4-5 and 22), and SB0912 (characterized by absence of spacers 4-7, and 28-37) accounted
for 11.8% of the isolates each.
Comparison of the patterns with the global M. bovis
database revealed six spoligotypes that had not been
reported earlier. These were subsequently given an international identification code and registered in the global
M. bovis database http://www.mbovis.org as SB1517,
SB1518, SB1519, SB1520, SB1521 and SB1522. At ≥ 90%
genetic relatedness, the 12 spoligotypes were grouped
into two clusters (Figure 1). The first cluster included
three spoligotypes namely; SB0912, SB1521 and SB1176,
which were characterized by the absence of spacers 4-7
and 28-37, and contained spacers 10-14 and 17-23. The
second cluster, characterized by presence of spacers 11-

Figure 1 Cluster analysis showing genetic relationship among Ethiopian M. bovis strains (n = 34) obtained from cattle revealing gross
pathologic lesions compatible with bovine tuberculosis. The dendrogram was built using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average method (UPGMA). M. bovis BCG (SB0120) and M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) were included as controls. Columns on the right show international spoligotype name and frequency and the corresponding percent of isolation.

14 and 24-38, included nine closely related types; SB1265,
SB0134, SB1517, SB1520, SB1518, SB0133, SB1468,
SB1519 and SB1522.
Assessment of the relationship between distribution of
specific spoligotypes and breed, geographic origin, management system and severity of lesions, did not show significant statistical association (Table 1). Figure 2 presents
distribution of spoligotypes by abattoir. Eight spoligotypes were recorded at Addis Ababa abattoir and this was
followed by 5 spoligotypes from Adama abattoir. Among
the unique spoligotypes, three (SB1518, SB1519 and
SB1520) were only isolated from Addis Ababa abattoir,
two (SB1521 and SB1522) from Adama Municipal abattoir and one (SB1517) from Addis Ababa and Yabello
abattoirs.
Nine out of 18 (50%) BTB confirmed cases were found
to harbour two or more spoligotypes (Table 2). These

cases were recorded from Addis Ababa, central and
southern regions. SB1176 was dominant in all cases of
multiple spoligotype infections. Five distinct spoligotypes
were seen to occur simultaneously in two carcasses (cases
321 and 422), where four spoligotypes (SB1176, SB1517,
SB0133, and SB0912) were present in both cases while
SB0134 was present in 321 and SB1520 in 422. The discriminatory power (HGDI) of the spoligotyping method
was calculated to be 0.81. Also on the basis of the above
findings (the number of distinct spoligotypes (S) = 12,
total number of unrelated strains (N) = 34, total oligonucleotide spacers for DR region (O) = 43, and the constant
(K) = 0.18), the SEI of spoligotype evolution for the current population of Ethiopian M. bovis isolates was computed to be 3.2.

Discussion
Bovine tuberculosis is an endemic disease in Ethiopia and
its existence has been documented in various livestock
production settings across the country. The existence of a
sound disease control policy requires the availability of
information based on scientific knowledge. In Ethiopia
there has not been any adequate BTB and livestock movement control policy, factors that promote build-up and
transmission of disease. This gave impetus to the need for
investigation of genotypic characteristics and geospatial
distribution of M. bovis strains involved in causing disease in cattle. This study investigated molecular characteristics of M. bovis causing gross pathologic lesions in
cattle in Ethiopia. Association of specific genotypes with
recorded variables such as breed, geographic origin, management system under which an animal is managed as
well as forms of TB lesions dissemination in the body was
also investigated. Among the significant findings of the
present study were the documentation of M. bovis spoligotype distribution in various regions, reporting of six new
spoligotypes and development of method for comparison
of genetic polymorphism between the populations (sets
of isolates) of M. bovis. The 34 strains of M. bovis were
grouped into 12 spoligotypes (Figure 1) suggesting that
TB infection in cattle in Ethiopia is caused by heterogeneous strains of M. bovis.
Six of the 12 (50%) spoligotypes detected in our study
have not been reported from other studies. Together with
six additional unique spoligotypes documented earlier
[16,17], the reporting of new spoligotypes in the present
study demonstrated the existence of a high degree of

genetic polymorphism within the population of M. bovis
in Ethiopia with the inherent possibility of continuing
emergence of new strains over time. Likewise, several
new spoligotypes have been reported recently from African countries including Uganda [18], Chad [19], Mali [20]
and South Africa [21] as well as from Iran [22], showing
the existence of high degree of adaptation of M. bovis
strains to the prevailing local production settings.
The high isolation frequency of spoligotype SB1176
(41.2%) conforms to the findings of previous two works
from Ethiopia [16,17] and demonstrates dominance of
this spoligotype as a major cause of BTB in Ethiopian cattle particularly in the central region where the disease is
highly prevalent [3]. Apart from its uniqueness, repeated
isolation of SB1176 at high frequency from Ethiopia may
indicate the existence of a locally evolved clonal strain
with selective genetic advances perhaps linked to virulence and transmissibility. Persistent occurrence of
SB1176 could also indicate the extreme high degree of
reinfection rate prevailing in the area. In humans such
phenomenon is attributed to 'naïve' immune response
[23] or endogenous reactivation of the primary infection
[24]. High stocking density and intermingling linked to
growing businesses of specialized feedlot and dairy enterprises in the central region could have created a favourable environment for persistence and continued
transmission of the genotype. It is of great interest to
examine the current Ethiopian M. bovis isolates by MLVA
analysis using the set of 28 different loci, in order to
explore more genetic variability within identical and
between different spoligotypes.
SB0134 which has previously been isolated from Mali
[20], South Africa [21] and several European countries
including UK [25], France [26] and Spain [10] could have
been introduced into Ethiopia along with imported dairy
cows (from some African and European countries) during
the advent of dairy development operations around 1947.
SB0133 has also been reported recently from Ethiopia
[17] and Uganda [18]. Moreover, SB1468, which was isolated from Addis Ababa and southern regions (pastoral
cattle), has been reported from cattle and humans in pastoral regions of Uganda [18]. The uniqueness of these
spoligotypes (SB0133 and SB1468) to the East African
region, as they have not been reported elsewhere, may
indicate selective adaptation of the spoligotype to pastoral ecosystem. This assertion needs to be further elucidated by molecular investigation of the spoligotype over
time. In a recent study [27], an epidemiologically important clonal complex of M. bovis (mainly characterized by
absence of spacer 30) has been noted to be dominant in
the West African region.
Multiple infections by two or more spoligotypes were
reported in nine cases (50%) whose geographic origin was
linked to Addis Ababa and its surroundings (3 cases),

central (5 cases) and southeast (1 case). Out of these, two
cases (321 and 422), were found to harbour five different
spoligotypes each. These were young Holstein-Friesian
animals whose origin was linked to dairy farms in and
around Addis Ababa area, where BTB is known to be
highly prevalent (23.7% and 46% individual and herd level
prevalence, respectively) [28]. Stress, linked to suboptimal dairy management, prolonged life style as well as
physiological characteristics (such as year round lactation
and pregnancy), of dairy animals could favour high
degree of super infection with different genotypes. This
contradicts the work done by Duarte et al, [29] that
ascribes multiple genotype infections to beef fattening
practice. It is also to be noticed that multiple genotype
infections have been reported in low BTB prevalence
countries such as Ireland [30] and Portugal [29]. Whether
or not the occurrence of multiple spoligotypes was due to
exogenous super infection or reactivation of latent infection could not be ascertained at this stage, and hence
needs to be further investigated by combining epidemiological information with various molecular typing methods. However, in the present study it is assumed that
different sources of infection linked to intermingling of
stock could be taken as a possible explanation for the
reported large proportion of cattle infected with multiple
genotypes. Alternatively, it could also be attributed to
persistence and evolution of 'ancestral' M. bovis strains
circulating within the country's cattle population [31].
The possibilities of new strains being acquired from other
potential sources such as small ruminants and wildlife
could not be ruled out as well. Under Ethiopian context,
this appears plausible as inter-species co-mingling and
frequent contact with wildlife is part of the traditional
animal husbandry system. The reporting of identical spoligotypes from various regions across the country indicates an ongoing transmission of infection due to mainly
livestock trade links between these regions.
The SEI has been calculated from previously published
papers studying the M. bovis populations of other African
countries, Iran and Canada. Comparing the spoligotype
evolutionary index of the current set of Ethiopia's M.
bovis isolates (SEI = 3.2) to the index of sets of isolates
from Uganda (1.8) [18], Mali (0.56) [20], Chad (0.7) [19],
Iran (0.49) [22] and Canada (0.56) [32], revealed a relatively high degree of spoligotype evolution among M.
bovis population from Ethiopia. It appears that the spoligotypes obtained from East African region (Ethiopia and
Uganda) were more polymorphic in DR region compared
to isolates considered above. On the other hand the spoligotype evolution was found to be lower in the Central
and West African region, which could be attributable to
limited cattle imports and fairly recent introduction of
the disease [19,33].

In the present study, we were not able to isolate M.
tuberculosis from cattle and this seems to contradict with
the study done by Berg et al, [17], which reported isolation of nearly 6% of M. tuberculosis from cattle in Ethiopia. Lack of isolation of M. tuberculosis from the large
number of pathologic tissue samples in an environment
with substantial human-animal interaction and where
human tuberculosis is endemic in the local community
may support the expectation that M. tuberculosis exhibits
low virulence in cattle. This is further corroborated by the
fact that M. tuberculosis-infected cattle often produce a
rapidly vanishing infection rather than progressive disease [34,35]. Similar results were reported from Iran,
where no M. tuberculosis was detected among 132 isolates obtained from cattle as all were confirmed to be M.
bovis [22].

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study provided further molecular evidence for widespread distribution of mycobacterial infection due to M. bovis in Ethiopian cattle population. The
occurrence of multiple infections by two or more spoligotypes could indicate the existence of high degree of super
infection in the area. SB1176, which has only been
reported from Ethiopia, was the most dominant spoligotype. We recommend further molecular investigation of
this spoligotype over time as to whether or not it represents an epidemiologically important clonal complex of
M. bovis in the area. Compared to M. bovis isolates from
other countries; the current isolates seem to have a relatively high degree of DR region polymorphism. The need
to further elucidate epidemiological and molecular
genetic characteristics of M. bovis strains causing infections in other domestic animals, wildlife and humans is
emphasized as this may help to establish reservoirs and
pattern of transmission among various hosts.
