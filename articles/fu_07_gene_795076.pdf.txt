Abstract
Background: Tuberculosis remains a leading infectious disease with global public health threat. Its
control and management have been complicated by multi-drug resistance and latent infection,
which prompts scientists to find new and more effective drugs. With the completion of the genome
sequence of the etiologic bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it is now feasible to search for new
drug targets by sieving through a large number of gene products and conduct genome-scale
experiments based on microarray technology. However, the full potential of genome-wide
microarray analysis in configuring interrelationships among all genes in M. tuberculosis has yet to be
realized. To date, it is only possible to assign a function to 52% of proteins predicted in the genome.
Results: We conducted a functional-genomics study using the high-resolution Affymetrix
oligonucleotide GeneChip. Approximately one-half of the genes were found to be always
expressed, including more than 100 predicted conserved hypotheticals, in the genome of M.
tuberculosis during the log phase of in vitro growth. The gene expression profiles were analyzed and
visualized through cluster analysis to epitomize the full details of genomic behavior. Broad patterns
derived from genome-wide expression experiments in this study have provided insight into the
interrelationships among genes in the basic cellular processes of M. tuberculosis.
Conclusion: Our results have confirmed several known gene clusters in energy production,
information pathways, and lipid metabolism, and also hinted at potential roles of hypothetical and
regulatory proteins.

Background
Knowledge about the genome sequence of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis [1] has contributed to recent advancement in
understanding the biology of this organism and its clinical relevance. Concurrent with this development, a highthroughput genome-wide gene expression analysis device
in the form of microarrays has rapidly emerged as a seemingly indispensable tool for studying genomics in the

modern era. These developments have brought about the
revolutionary conception of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in the genomic perspective. Its significance should be clear, as tuberculosis is still causing
millions of deaths in the world.
DNA microarrays have been applied to analyze M. tuberculosis. The first type of application focuses on genotyping,

for example, species identification [2,3] and detection of
drug-resistant mutants [4,5]. The second type of application seeks to explore altered gene expression and understand biological pathways in terms of up-regulated and
down-regulated genes in certain conditions of interest,
such as drug challenge [6], hypoxia [7], starvation [8],
high temperature [9], and in vivo [10]. However, existing
applications do not exploit the full potential of genomescale microarray analysis in configuring interrelationships
among all genes in M. tuberculosis. We pioneered the
approach that applied the Affymetrix M. tuberculosis GeneChip to gene expression analysis. Previously, this GeneChip was used for applications related to genotyping.
Our study is aimed to explore the whole-genome behavior
of M. tuberculosis during log-phase growth by conducting
a bioinformatics analysis on genome-wide gene expression data generated from microarray hybridization. Our
results enrich the current understanding of genome functions based on sequence analysis and functional studies of
individual genes in such aspects as deduction of possible
roles of conserved hypothetical and regulatory proteins.

Results
Active genes involved in growth
Research on M. tuberculosis has yet to answer the questions
of how many and what genes are active during normal
growth in a standard in vitro environment and how they
are related to each other in a global genome-wide sense.
To answer these questions, we adopted the Affymetrix
GeneChip system, which, based on a specific oligonucleotide array format, could provide the absolute signal
intensity in a single condition as well as the signal ratio
between two conditions. Furthermore, its built-in statistical algorithm computes the so-called Detection p-value
that determines the presence or absence of any given
mRNA. It is this feature that we capitalize on to explore
the genomic behavior of M. tuberculosis. A gene is active
when it is expressed. Gene activity is measured by the
expression level (i.e., abundance of corresponding
mRNA) detected by microarray hybridization in this
study.

We found that about one-half of the genes in M. tuberculosis genome participated in bacterial growth during the
log (exponential) phase in standard broth culture. The
average and standard deviation of expression signal intensity for each active gene would reflect its relative level of
activity and the range of variation (Table 1). It was noted
that the extent of gene expression did not necessarily correlated with essentiality; for example, among the ten most
expressed genes, only two were essential genes as defined
by high density mutagenesis [11].

Functional genomic analysis
The microarray data of those genes involved in the in vitro
growth of M. tuberculosis during log phase were analyzed
through the hierarchical clustering algorithm of Eisen's
Cluster program [12]. This cluster-analysis program
allowed us to explore the internal structure of the data and
derive useful information concerning the coordination
and collaboration among the genes. A measure fundamental to clustering is that of similarity. We define similarity between genes by their correlation in terms of gene
expression patterns across multiple samples. The dendrogram generated by the algorithm (Figure 1) was organized
according to this measure and displayed in a way to optimize the similarity of adjacent elements (genes). In the
dendrogram, more related genes were joined earlier, and
several highly dense clusters with peaks spreading along
were visible.

Based upon the above analysis, the dendrogram was partitioned, using a correlation threshold of 0.9, into a
number of disjoint clusters related to functional classes
known previously. Each cluster contained functionally
related genes that might share similar functions or roles in
physiology or metabolism and were likely subject to the
same regulatory mechanism. For instance, one cluster was
found to be similar to the FAS-II operon, and another
cluster comprised largely of genes encoding ribosomal
proteins (Table 2). Notice, however, genes of different
classes may co-exist in the same cluster if they show correlation in their activity. This situation is exemplified by
energy-dependent transportation across cell membrane,
which necessitates the coupling between the gene class of
cell processes and that of energy production.
The clustering results were further visualized through
Eisen's TreeView program to generate a heat map where
the brightness of the red color represented the intensity of
gene expression (Figure 1). Based on the cluster analysis
results and the observation of four conspicuous shining
bands, the map was tentatively divided into four zones
from the top to the bottom, called: zones 1, 2, 3, and 4, in
the consecutive order. Each zone contained clusters of
genes that were strongly correlated in their expression patterns and in that sense, functionally related. Each zone in
the map was represented by genes that expressed most
(i.e., the brightest in red), Thus, the map zones were
labeled according to the functional class (genolist.pasteur.fr/TubercuList/) of their representative genes as
"intermediate and lipid metabolism", "energy", "information", and "cell wall, cell processes, and metabolism",
respectively.
The two most conspicuous clusters in the first zone of the
gene expression map consisted of a cluster represented by
genes in the functional category of intermediate metabo-

represented by genes involved in the FAS-II cycle [6], such
as accD6, kasA, and KasB. The formation of the cluster
with emphasis on the FAS-II cycle reflects the importance
of this pathway in M. tuberculosis growth. As for interme-

diate metabolism, M. tuberculosis can metabolize many
kinds of carbohydrates, hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones
and carboxylic acids [1]. This zone was adjacent to the
energy zone, suggesting the close relationship between
intermediate metabolism and energy production.

Figure 1
The gene expression map of genes involved in the log-phase growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
The gene expression map of genes involved in the log-phase growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The map was generated by
Eisen's cluster-analysis program called CLUSTER and viewed by the TREEVIEW program. Several clusters representing aggregations of functionally related genes are visible in the dendrogram (on the left of the image) showing how genes are grouped.
The detailed image is available at our web site [see Additional file 2] annotated with gene names alongside of the image strip
[see Additional file 3].

The most prominent genes in the second zone of the gene
expression map were the ATP synthase gene complex,
which produces ATP from ADP and is critical in energy
metabolism. In addition, genes encoding enzymes
involved in the respiratory chain, such as the nuo (NADHubiquinone oxidoreductase) gene complex, were clustered into this zone. In another study [13], ATP synthase
and nuo gene complexes were found to be down-regulated
together. Thus, they may be co-regulated.
The third zone of the gene expression map was represented by genes involved in the information pathways,
e.g., dnaQ (DNA polymerase III), recA (recombinase),
rpoA (DNA-directed RNA polymerase), and the 30S and
50S ribosome protein gene complexes (rpsB, rpsC, rplB,
rplC, etc.). As these genes play a vital role in genetic information replication, transcription, and translation, their
expression is essential for maintaining bacterial growth.
We noticed that the gene Rv2258C (encoding a possible
transcriptional regulatory protein) correlated well with a

group of ribosomal protein genes. This result is related to
a report that the production of ribosomes is increased
through the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding
ribosomal proteins during the growth phase of yeast [14].
The last zone of the gene expression map was represented
by genes classified under the category of cell wall, cell
processes, and metabolism. This category comprises
membrane proteins and proteins involved in cell processes, including secreted and transmembrane proteins
[15], as well as enzymes involved in intermediate metabolism. Genes and their protein derivatives located in this
zone are related to cell wall synthesis, transportation of
organic and inorganic substance across membrane, and
immunological responses, such as narK2 (a nitrate/nitrite
transporter), fbpC (mycolyl transferase), hsp (a protein
induced by heat stress), ald (a secreted enzyme), ctpF (a
metal cation transporter), sodA (superoxide dismutase,
which destroys radicals), ompA (an outer membrane protein), amt (an ammonium-transport integral membrane

(a protein in the antigen-85 complex), and genes in the
lipoprotein family (lpqS, lpqH, lppJ, lprF, lpqO and lppD).
The most important feature of mycobacterial cell wall is
the substantial amount (up to 60% of the total mass) of
lipid components, particularly, the very long chain
mycolic acids, which are combined with surface glycolipids to form a pseudolipid bilayer [16]. Since the cell wall
synthesis involves lipid metabolism [6], the main cluster
in zone 4 also contains some genes in this class, such as
fadE26 (encoding acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) and fadD16
(encoding fatty-acid-CoA ligase).

Each zone was tentatively named according to the most
expressed genes it contained. The semantics of each zone
would further depend on whether each zone represents a
concentration of genes in the same functional categories
and that concentration is consistent with the function
classification of the most expressed genes in that zone. So
we further analyzed the percentage distribution of functional classes for the genes in the major clusters of each
zone on the gene expression map (Table 3). The functional classification of a gene is based on current knowledge in the field and can be accessed from the TubercuList
Server (genolist.pasteur.fr/TubercuList/). Our analysis
indicated that each zone contained clusters of genes of

similar functions and the most expressed genes were in
the dominant function class, suggesting that functional
semantics can be assigned to clusters visible from the gene
expression map. Zone-1 featured genes in the functional
classes of metabolism (intermediate and lipid). In zone-2,
there was only a slight dominance of genes in the class of
metabolism and respiration over the class of cell wall and
processes, but notably, it contained a big chuck of energyrelated genes involved in ATP synthesis and electron
transport. Zone-3 was characterized by genes in the information category. Zone-4 had the broadest distribution on
the map and a wide functional coverage, and was thus
least characteristic among the four zones.
There were about a dozen of regulatory genes associated
with the major functional clusters identified in this study
(Table 4). Their significance is reflected by their possible
roles reported in other studies. These genes likely regulate
other genes in the same cluster at the transcriptional level
and deserve to be examined in more details. Regulatory
genes associated with small clusters are considered less
important and hence not examined here.
The Rv2989 gene was associated with the cluster characterized by energy metabolism and respiration in our data.
The association relation appears to be consistent with
reports that this gene is up-regulated at high temperatures
[9] and down-regulated after starvation [8].

Rv3334 was up-regulated at high temperatures [9] as well
as after starvation [8]. This gene is probably in the MerR
(mercury resistance) family and its protein is similar to
many regulatory proteins in sequence.
Rv0081 can be induced by hypoxia [7]. Its presence in
growing bacterial cells is called into question. However,
this gene is only weakly expressed in the present study,
and likely to be up-regulated if oxygen is depleted.
The whiB4 gene encodes a protein homologous to a Streptomyces sporulation factor [17], and the gene is up-regulated after starvation [8], suggesting a possible link
between starvation and sporulation. In addition, the association of whiB4 with the class of cell wall and cell processes makes sense from the point that sporulation could
potentially involve cell membrane.
Rv0653c is probably in the TetR family. Its significance is
reflected by the fact that proteins in this family are
involved in the transcriptional control of multi-drug
efflux pumps and pathogenicity [18]. Another regulatory
gene, Rv0165c, is probably in the GntR family. In E. coli,
GntR regulates gluconate uptake and catabolism as a
repressor [19]. Both Rv0653c and Rv0165c are apparently
involved in a membrane-associated cellular process.
Another gene worth attention is Rv1931c, which regulates
genes important for virulence of M. tuberculosis [20], pos-

Discussion
The availability of the complete genome sequence of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis [1] combined with rapidly
emerging microarray technology [21] has catalyzed the
process of understanding the bacterial biology and pathogenicity and expedited the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics for tuberculosis. The microarray
approach has enabled high-throughput gene expression
analysis on a genomic scale in a field known as functional
genomics [22]. In particular, elucidation of functional
relationships among genes based on genome-wide gene
expression data from DNA microarray hybridization has
been successfully demonstrated for eukaryotes, notably
yeast [12,23], but it has not been done for M. tuberculosis.
To date, the functional classification of genes in M. tuberculosis is mainly based on the biological study of individual genes as well as sequence analysis and comparison
with homologous genes in other bacteria. In this study, we
provide a comprehensive analysis that addresses this issue
from the perspective of functional genomics.
In the application to M. tuberculosis, DNA microarrays
have been used for comparing species, detecting drugresistant mutants, and studying biological behavior under
various conditions. In general, there are two computational paradigms for microarray data analysis. The first
paradigm is to identify genes differentially expressed
across two conditions; the second paradigm is to identify
genes expressed in a coordinated manner that share common roles in cellular physiology or metabolism. Most of
the applications for M. tuberculosis to date are based on the
first paradigm, whereas our study described here is based
on the second paradigm.
In this study, active genes were identified by means of the
Affymetrix GeneChip. As its unique feature, the Affymetrix system uses multiple oligonucleotide probes for
implementing each gene sequence to be interrogated. Furthermore, the system is capable of analyzing the presence
or absence of each mRNA. In contrast to the cDNA microarray system that is focused on differential gene expression across two conditions, the Affymetrix system can
calculate gene expression in a single condition and compare gene expression across multiple conditions. In this
way, the Affymetrix system is more flexible and informative. The flexibility can be attributed to the use of PM/MM
probes, instead of two explicitly defined external conditions, for implementing the test/control mechanism in
microarray hybridization.
Our method for analysis of in vitro genomic activity of M.
tuberculosis can be extended to study functional genomics

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/37

in vivo. Understanding what genes are switched on or off
between in vitro and in vivo conditions would shed light
on issues, such as how biological adaptation leads to bacterial latency, why there is discrepancy between laboratory
sensitivity and clinical efficacy, and so on. Thus, the functional-genomics data obtained in this work can serve as a
reference for interpreting data generated in other contexts.
Our genomic analysis was based on multiple RNA samples extracted during log-phase growth in contrast to other
coordinated gene expression analyses based on samples
collected in a time course or under different conditions.
Our experiment design is justified, given the fact that the
expression level of any gene has considerable fluctuation
from time to time (Table 1) in log-phase growth, as evidenced from the observation that the standard deviation
of a gene expression was sometimes greater than 50% of
its mean across samples. Variation in gene expression
across different time settings enabled the correlation
among different genes to be analyzed. The validity of our
experiments is supported by reconfirmation of several
known growth-related gene clusters. However, our
approach is not applicable to samples collected during
stationary phase, when little variation in gene expression
is expected across samples.
The in vitro broth culture condition has often been used
as the reference condition to study the gene expression of
M. tuberculosis in other conditions, such as hypoxia and
starvation. However, the present study is the first to
explore the functional genomics of this organism grown
in log-phase culture. Bacterial growth can be divided into
four different phases: lag phase, exponential or log phase,
stationary phase, and death phase. It is the log phase that
we focused our study on. During this phase, high growth
activity is evidenced by our data showing that about half
of the genes in the genome were expressed. In contrast,
many genes in M. tuberculosis are repressed during the stationary phase, a condition similar to but milder than the
non-replicating state of tubercle bacilli in an anaerobic
condition [24]. In particular, the dormancy regulatory
gene, dosR is weakly induced during the stationary phase
while strongly induced in an anaerobic non-replicating
state. An interesting finding based on our work is that dosR
is always moderately expressed even in the log phase, suggesting its possible housekeeping role. Our data further
showed that an important gene, acr (hspX), which is
induced under hypoxia [7] and starvation [8], was always
expressed in the log phase. Global gene expression profiling analysis of M. tuberculosis in mouse [25] and human
tissue [10] indicated that lipid metabolism was critical for
the bacilli to survive in the host environment. In these
conditions, isocitrate lyase (ICL), an enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt (a pathway alternative to the tricarboxylic acid
cycle) and related to mycobacterial persistence in macrophages [26], is up-regulated. It is consistent with our find-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/37

ing that icl is weakly expressed or absent in the log-phase
culture.
The extent to which gene expression profiles across a set of
independently collected samples suffice to separate genes
into functional clusters in consistency with prior knowledge is attributable to the rigorous statistical model built
in the Affymetrix system. Several familiar gene groups
with clear designated functions, such as electron transport, protein synthesis and type II fatty acid synthesis,
were observed in the data, offering credence to our analysis. However, genes associated with different functional
classes would be placed in the same cluster if they appear
to co-express. This implies that genes can share commons
roles while differing in their functions, as illustrated by
the earlier example of energy-dependent transportation
across the cell membrane. In fact, comparing gene clusters
based on gene expression with gene classes based on
sequence analysis would offer new opportunities for redefining interrelationships among genes in the genome.
Gene clusters built out of expression profiles can be configured as functional linkage networks among genes but
these clusters do not correspond directly to protein networks [10] constructed using a combination of Rosetta
stone, phylogenetic profile, conserved gene neighbor, and
operon computational methods. Genes, which share similar biological functions, may operate at different stages of
the cell cycle or become active under different conditions,
and hence have different expression profiles [10]. However, some gene families, in particular those encoding
ribosome proteins are closely linked in both gene-expression and protein networks, as seen in our data.

There remained 1051 so-called conserved hypothetical
genes/proteins annotated in the genome sequence of M.
tuberculosis [15], among which many were found to be
active in our analysis, attesting to the predictive power of
the genome annotation program [1]. More importantly,
this finding suggests that many hypothetical proteins
actively participate in the growth process. Unfortunately,
the functions of these hypotheticals remain uncharacterized, reflecting the limitation of the sequence-based
approach to genome annotation. Microarray-based functional-genomics offers a fundamentally different
approach to gene annotation, in which the roles of
uncharacterized genes may be hypothesized if they coexpress with known genes (Table 5).
Organized according to correlations in gene expression
across samples, the gene expression image created by
Eisen's Cluster and TreeView programs (Figure 1) enabled
us to visualize four transcriptional profiles, which, named
according to the functional classes of the dominant genes
in that region and put in a linear order over the image,
were "intermediate and lipid metabolism", "energy and
respiration", "information pathways", and "cell wall, cell
processes and metabolism". The dendrogram was constructed and displayed so that similar clusters were likely
to be located in proximate nodes. In the present application, as the similarity measure is based on the correlation
in gene expression, physical distance on the tree reflects
the degree of correlation among gene clusters, even with
no guarantee of their optimal linear ordering in the tree
[12]. As the expression of the genetic code lies at the heart
of all physiological processes and metabolisms, it is logical that the information gene cluster functionally correlates with other gene clusters, a view supported by the

observation that it was situated around the center of the
image.
As it is now, there are more than 100 transcriptional regulatory genes in M. tuberculosis genome [1,15]. However,
only a fraction of them have been experimentally studied
in detail for their functions. A recent survey shows that
regulatory proteins account for 9 (20%) out of 45 virulence factors identified in M. tuberculosis [27]. Unraveling
the gene regulatory network would allow us to understand both physiological and virulence mechanisms and
to develop novel drugs that work at the level of gene regulation. Since elucidating the roles of these genes and
their clinical relevance is always time-consuming; it is
practically necessary to set up priority for them. A reasonable assumption is that a regulatory gene regulates some
other genes in the same functional cluster with a high
probability. Under this assumption, we have identified
several potentially important transcriptional regulatory
genes involved in major biological pathways (Table 4).
Their significance has been indicated by analysis based on
the literature. Further biological investigation on these
genes is warranted in the future work.
All the microarray data and supplementary materials produced in this study are posted at our web site [see Additional file 1].

Conclusion
Genes involved in the in vitro log-phase growth of M.
tuberculosis have been identified. The gene expression map
(Figure 1) represents broad patters of functional concordance of closely related genes, but more importantly, it
summarizes the coordinated cellular activities associated
with the growth process on the genomic level. As it is
today, hundreds of genes in the genome are annotated as
conserved hypotheticals without clearly specified functions. Our data have shown that more than 100 such
hypotheticals were actually expressed in the cell medium,
and their biological roles can be suggested by their correlation with other known genes. In addition, the roles of
most transcriptional regulatory genes predicted in the
genome remain to be elucidated. In this study, we have
discovered several regulatory genes that may exert regulatory influence on the growth of M. tuberculosis, and their
roles may be inferred by what functional clusters they
join. The data and information generated here provide an
integrated genomic view about gene functions and interrelationships in M. tuberculosis, and can be incorporated in
new experiments for research in tuberculosis. This study
has not only transcriptionally validated several known
gene clusters but also provided insight into a host of
unknown hypothetical and regulatory genes.

Methods
Bacterial culture of M. tuberculosis
M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv was obtained from the culture
collection of the Mycobacteriology Laboratory Branch,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at Atlanta. A
portion of a recently frozen stock was inoculated into 5 ml
of complete Middlebrook 7H9 broth (7H9) supplemented with 10% albumin-dextrose-catalase v/v (Difco
Laboratories, Detroit, MI) and 0.05% Tween 80 v/v
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and incubated at 37Â°C for 5 days.
Then the culture was transferred into 50 ml of 7H9 media,
incubated at 37Â°C with 50 rpm shaking, and grown to log
phase (0.35 OD600). The cells were harvested by centrifugation for RNA preparation.
RNA isolation
Bacterial lysis and RNA isolation were performed following the procedure of [28] at the CDC lab (Atlanta) during
log-phase growth. Briefly, cultures were mixed with an
equal volume of RNALaterâ¢ (Ambion, Austin, TX) and the
bacteria harvested by centrifugation (1 min, 25000g, 8Â°C)
and transferred to Fast Prep tubes (Bio 101, Vista, CA)
containing Trizol (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD).
Mycobacteria were mechanically disrupted in a Fast Prep
apparatus (Bio 101). The aqueous phase was recovered,
treated with Cleanascite (CPG, Lincoln Park, NJ), and
extracted with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v).
Nucleic acids were ethanol precipitated. DNaseI
(Ambion) treatment to digest contaminating DNA was
performed in the presence of Prime RNase inhibitor (5'-3',
Boulder, CO). The RNA sample was precipitated and
washed in ethanol, and redissolved to make a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The purity of RNA was estimated
by the ratio of the readings at 260 nm and 280 nm (A260/
A280) in the UV. 20 ul RNA samples were sent to the UCI
DNA core and further checked through a quality and
quantity test based on electrophoresis before microarray
hybridization.
Microarray hybridization and analysis
In this study, we used the anti-sense Affymetrix M. tuberculosis genome array (GeneChip). The probe selection was
based on the genome sequence of M. tuberculosis H37Rv
[1]. Each annotated ORF (Open Reading Frame) or IG
(Intergenic Region) was interrogated with oligonucleotide
probe pairs. The gene chip represented all 3924 ORFs and
738 intergenic regions of H37Rv. Twenty 25-mer probes
were selected within each ORF or IG. These probes are
called PM (Perfect-Match) probes. The sequence of each
PM probe is perturbed with a single substitution at the
middle base. They are called MM (Mismatch) probes. A
PM probe and its respective MM probe constitute a probe
pair. The MM probe serves as a negative control for the PM
probe in hybridization.

Microarray hybridization followed the Affymetrix protocol. In brief, the assay utilized reverse transcriptase and
random hexamer primers to produce DNA complementary to the RNA. The cDNA products were then fragmented by DNAase I and labeled with terminal
transferase and biotinylated GeneChip DNA Labeling
Reagent at the 3' terminal.

Each RNA sample was hybridized with one gene array to
produce the expression data of all genes on the array. We
performed eleven independent bacterial cultures and RNA
extractions at different times, and collected eleven sets of
microarray data for this study. A global normalization
scheme is applied so that each array's median value is
adjusted to a predefine value (500).

Bioinformatics analysis
The gene expression data were analyzed by the program
GCOS (GeneChip Operating Software) version 1.4. In the
program, the Detection algorithm determines whether a
measured transcript is detected (P Call) or not detected (A
Call) on a single array according to the Detection p-value
that is computed by applying the one-sided Wilcoxon's
signed rank test to test the Discrimination scores (R)
against a predefined adjustable threshold Ï. The Discrimination score calculated for each probe pair is a function
of the PM intensity (PMI) and the MM intensity (MMI), as
given by

The parameter Ï controls the sensitivity and specificity of
the analysis, and was set to a typical value of 0.015, and
the Detection p-value cutoffs, Î±1 and Î±2, set to their typical
values, 0.04 and 0.06, respectively, according to the
Affymetrix system.
In this study, a gene was determined to be always (usually) active if the derived mRNA was present (P-call) in
more than 90% (50%) of the RNA samples with a Detection p-value < 0.001. The gene-expression data were further analyzed using Eisen's Cluster and TreeView
programs [12]. The whole-genome gene expression map
was produced by the hierarchical clustering algorithm
based on the average-linkage method in the program with
the similarity measure defined by Pearson's correlation
coefficient.
