Abstract
Background: The southern cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, is an economically
important parasite of cattle and can transmit several pathogenic microorganisms to its cattle host
during the feeding process. Understanding the biology and genomics of R. microplus is critical to
developing novel methods for controlling these ticks.
Results: We present a global comparative genomic analysis of a gene index of R. microplus
comprised of 13,643 unique transcripts assembled from 42,512 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), a
significant fraction of the complement of R. microplus genes. The source material for these ESTs
consisted of polyA RNA from various tissues, lifestages, and strains of R. microplus, including larvae
exposed to heat, cold, host odor, and acaricide. Functional annotation using RPS-Blast analysis
identified conserved protein domains in the conceptually translated gene index and assigned GO
terms to those database transcripts which had informative BlastX hits. Blast Score Ratio and
SimiTri analysis compared the conceptual transcriptome of the R. microplus database to other
eukaryotic proteomes and EST databases, including those from 3 ticks. The most abundant protein
domains in BmiGI were also analyzed by SimiTri methodology.
Conclusion: These results indicate that a large fraction of BmiGI entries have no homologs in
other sequenced genomes. Analysis with the PartiGene annotation pipeline showed 64% of the
members of BmiGI could not be assigned GO annotation, thus minimal information is available
about a significant fraction of the tick genome. This highlights the important insights in tick biology
which are likely to result from a tick genome sequencing project. Global comparative analysis
identified some tick genes with unexpected phylogenetic relationships which detailed analysis
attributed to gene losses in some members of the animal kingdom. Some tick genes were identified
which had close orthologues to mammalian genes. Members of this group would likely be poor
choices as targets for development of novel tick control technology.

Background
Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, the tropical or south-

ern cattle tick, is one of the most economically important
tick vectors of pathogens that affect the global cattle pop-

ulation [1]. The tick transmits protozoan (Babesia bovis
and Babesia bigemina) and prokaryotic (Anaplasma marginale) organisms that cause babesiosis and anaplasmosis,
which can result in severe agricultural losses in milk and
beef production and restriction in traffic of livestock. The
impact of R. microplus upon the US cattle industry was
such that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) led a
campaign in the mid-20th century which eradicated the
tick from the US [2]. The tick remains prevalent in Mexico
and, since over a million cattle are imported annually into
the US from Mexico, an extensive USDA quarantine program is in place to keep Boophilus ticks from reestablishing
in the US [3].
Acaricides play a critical role in maintaining the success of
the USDA quarantine program and in controlling tick
infestations in Mexico and other parts of the world. However, reports of acaricide resistant R. microplus populations
in Mexico [4,5] and R. microplus outbreaks in the US [6]
highlight the need for development of novel tick control
methodologies. Understanding the genome and the gene
expression profile of the tick should facilitate the development of these control technologies. Several reports have
described projects centered on the acquisition and analysis of tick expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Most of the
reports focused on the genes transcribed in the salivary
glands of ticks such as Rhipicephalus appendiculatus [7],
Amblyomma variegatum [8] and Ixodes scapularis [9]. Additionally, the isolation of 1,344 ESTs from ovaries, salivary
glands and hemocytes of R. microplus has been reported,
however, the sequences have not been submitted to Genbank [10]. Genes expressed in salivary glands and ovaries
are attractive targets for study because these tissues are
involved in critical tick-host-pathogen interactions. In a
more general approach, we have developed a R. microplus
EST database, BmiGI [11], derived from various tissues,
lifestages and tick strains, to facilitate research using
molecular biological and genomic approaches to design
novel tick control technologies. It is hoped the analysis of
the database will lead to discovery of genes which can
overcome tick control problems due to acaricide resistance and identify gene-based vulnerabilities in the processes involved in pathogen infection and transmission. In
BmiGI Version 1, 53 putative acaricide resistance-associated sequences were identified. In the present study, we
have assembled an updated gene index [12] which contains more than double the number of ESTs of Version 1.
We present the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation analysis
and RPS-Blast identification of conserved protein
domains from BmiGI Version 2. Using the comparative
genomics analytical tools Blast Score Ratio [13] and SimiTri [14] which provide visual outputs to allow global
comparisons between genomes, we compared the proteome resulting from the conceptual translation of the R.
microplus EST database with the proteomes from Homo

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/368

sapiens, Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster,
Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We
also performed more detailed SimiTri comparisons using
several of the most abundant protein domains in the proteome of R. microplus.

Results and discussion
BmiGI statistics and GO annotation
In the first version of BmiGI, ESTs were clustered and
assembled into tentative consensus (TC) sequences using
TIGR's autoannotation pipeline tools, and non-clustered,
non-overlapping sequences defined as singleton
sequences. A total of 20,417 ESTs were analyzed and the
assembly yielded 8,270 unique members, including 5,760
TCs and 2,510 singleton ESTs [11]. In the second version
of BmiGI, the total number of new ESTs sequenced was
22,095. These new sequences were combined with the
ESTs in the BmiGI Version 1 for clustering to generate
BmiGI Version 2, resulting in 9,403 TCs and 4,240 singletons.

The number of novel sequences obtained significantly
decreased as EST sequencing proceeded. The first 20,417
ESTs resulted in 8,270 unique members of BmiGI, a
return rate of 41%. The second set, comprised of 22,095
ESTs, resulted in an additional 5,373 new members of
BmiGI, a return rate of 24%. By the final stages of the second round of EST sequencing, a return rate of approximately 5% was being observed and further EST
sequencing of this pooled normalized cDNA library no
longer seemed an efficient use of resources. Future EST
sequencing would likely be more efficient if performed on
libraries synthesized from targeted tissues of specific interest, such as synganglia, ovaries or salivary glands.
Sequencing of several targeted libraries is underway.
The latest release of the annotation for the D. melanogaster
genome sequence [15] notes 19,783 protein-coding transcripts. The latest genome assembly for the A. gambiae [16]
has noted 14,089 gene transcripts. Assuming R. microplus
has a similar number of transcripts as these two arthropods, the BmiGI set of 13,643 unique transcripts represents a significant fraction of the likely set of proteincoding transcripts in R. microplus. However, it is likely that
BmiGI contains ESTs which are derived from non-coding
RNAs, as EST databases have been shown to contain noncoding RNAs [17]. Additionally, during use of BmiGI following annotation by BLAST analysis, it was noticed that
some sequences had very high amino acid identity to
bovine sequences. These likely resulted from bovine
blood remaining in the gut of the adult ticks, one of the
lifestages sampled and included in the pooled RNA used
to synthesize the cDNA library. Additionally, some
sequences appeared to be of protozoan origin and might
have originated from commensual organisms within the

tick or from a sample of Babesia bovis-infected larvae
included during the library synthesis. The autoannotation
pipeline used for assembling the gene index was not readily adaptable to remove bovine or protozoan sequences
and this should be considered when using BmiGI. However, in our experience, these do not form an appreciable
fraction of the BmiGI entries and should be easily identifiable by their high nucleotide identity to bovine or protozoan sequences in GenBank Blast search results.
Functional annotation of BmiGI to assign GO terms and
assist in identification of gene function was performed
with two different methods, the TIGR autoannotation
pipeline and the PartiGene open source software package.
In the BmiGI Version 2 web-hosted annotation, the GO
analysis is presented using the TIGR autoannotation pipeline in which the cutoff for annotation was based on a
search of a non-redundant protein database with E < 1 Ã
10-27. The top protein hit with at least 75% similarity and
50% coverage was taken and the GO terms assigned to
this protein transferred to the TC query. The stringent cutoff is utilized to minimize annotations of false positives

from the Blast analysis and singletons are not assigned
GO terms. As noted in Table 1, the TIGR analysis assigned
1369, 1321, and 1253 TCs to the molecular function, biological process, and cellular component ontologies,
respectively. Catalytic activity and binding are the top two
assigned GO terms in the molecular function category.
Physiological process and cellular process are the top two
assigned GO terms for the biological process category.
Finally, intracellular and cell are the top two assigned GO
terms for the cellular component category.
We wished to attempt to predict gene function for TCs
which were designated as unknowns and not assigned GO
terms by the TIGR pipeline and to include GO annotation
analysis for singletons when possible. Thus, we tried the
software annot8r_blast2go in the PartiGene pipeline [18],
using Blast E-values of 1 Ã 10-8 and 1 Ã 10-25 (Table 1).
When the E-value is set at 1 Ã 10-25, 2,615 TCs (28% of the
total TCs) and 730 singletons (17% of the total singletons) can be assigned a GO annotation. When the E-value
is set at 1 Ã 10-8, 3,608 TCs (38%) and 1096 singletons
(26%) can be assigned one or more GO terms. Thus, 66%

of the members of BmiGI could not be assigned GO annotation, even using a relatively liberal E-value in the Blast.
Singletons were annotated at a lower ratio of the total possible than TCs, most likely due to the singletons generally
containing shorter sequence lengths compared to TCs. It
is possible that some singletons represent transcripts from
low copy number genes which might be unique to ticks or
from genes with low sequence identity to those from
organisms better represented in gene and protein
sequence databases.
Global comparative genomics
We were interested in determining how related the
genome of R. microplus is to other metazoan genomes.
SimiTri [14] was developed for that purpose and is capable of globally comparing a target genome to three other
genomes with the results displayed in an easily interpreted triangular graphic. In fact, SimiTri analysis was
used to compare EST and whole genome databases from
several nematode species, including C. elegans, Haemonchus contortus, and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, and visualize evolutionary relationships between these nematodes
[19]. Hughes et al. [20] used SimiTri analysis for similar
purposes in comparisons of translated ESTs from various
beetles to the proteomes of D. melanogaster, H. sapiens,
and C. elegans. However, since our research priorities are
aimed at developing novel control technologies for cattle
pests in general and R. microplus most specifically, our
comparative analyses were guided by these priorities. We
wished to use comparative genome analysis to help prioritize selection of possible gene or protein targets for developing novel control technologies, which could include
vaccines or design of novel inhibitors aimed at selected
gene products. Ideally, a control technology would
present no toxicity to non-target organisms, with mammalian toxicity presenting greatest concern. Naturally, an
anti-tick control technology which is highly toxic to cattle
would be of limited use when applied to cattle compared
to an effective approach with high target specificity. Thus
we selected the genome of H. sapiens as the representative
mammalian genome for comparative genome analysis
with the BmiGI database, feeling that coding regions without orthologous members in mammals would provider
better targets for further investigations. Likewise, as R.
microplus is an arthropod, we selected the well-characterized genome of D. melanogaster for these comparisons. As
cattle can be parasitized internally by nematodes, we
selected C. elegans as a well-studied representative for the
genome of that type of organism. Finally, the genome of
A. gambiae was of interest as this organism is a blood-feeding arthropod vectoring a number of organisms which
parasitize human red blood cells in a broadly similar fashion as B. bovis and B. bigemina parasitize cattle red blood
cells.

Positional clustering reveals the relationship between
genes from R. microplus and those from the queried
genomes. Additionally, genes which locate along an edge
of the triangle have no significant match to the database
represented on the opposing vertex of the triangle. Using
the conceptually translated sequences of BmiGI, the R.
microplus data was compared with combinations of data
derived from the genome sequences of four other metazoans (H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, and A. gambiae)
and the unicellular organism S. cerevisiae (Figure 1). When
compared with S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens
(Figure 1a), the tick's sequences group closer to D. melanogaster than the other two organisms, with the tick
appearing most distant from S. cerevisiae, an expected
result since S. cerevisiae is a unicellular organism.
Although both R. microplus and D. melanogaster are arthropods, some R. microplus genes appear to be more similar
to human genes than D. melanogaster as evidenced in Figure 1a. Genes with these atypical gene similarities were
selected for more detailed examination of their Blast
results and will be discussed later. Upon replacement of S.
cerevisiae with C. elegans (Figure 1b), most of the predicted
relationships appear clustered near the center, but careful
examination shows slightly greater clustering toward the
D. melanogaster genome than C. elegans or H. sapiens.
Replacement of C. elegans with A. gambiae resulted in a
roughly symmetrical alignment between D. melanogaster
and A. gambiae, although some atypical genes cluster near
H. sapiens (Figure 1c). Finally, when the R. microplus genes
were compared with the three tick EST databases, R. appendiculatus, I. scapularis, and A. variegatum, most genes are
clustered closer to R. appendiculatus than the other two
ticks (Figure 1d). This result is consistent with the phylogenetic classifications of these 4 species of ticks [21].
Phylogenetically, ticks and insects belong to the arthropod phylum and would be expected to share more gene
similarity than genes from ticks and mammals. However,
SimiTri analysis revealed some atypical genes which were
observed to cluster closer to human genes than either D.
melanogaster or A. gambiae genes. The three most atypical
genes are circled in Figure 1aâc and listed in Table 2.
TC14523 contains the closest similarity to human genes
in all the three comparisons of Figure 1aâc. The top Blast
hit for TC14523 is Dusty protein kinase (E-Value = 1 Ã 10138), a protein with a dual functional kinase domain,
whose specific biological role has not yet been identified.
While most databases classify this protein as a receptor
interacting kinase, detailed analysis demonstrated that
this is a single copy unique kinase which seems to be
present in all vertebrates [22]. An EST [GenBank:CD782617.1] from R. appendiculatus, a three host
tick parasitizing livestock, shows 91% nucleotide identity
to TC14523. Thus, at least two ticks possess this gene and
it would be very interesting to know the function of this

gene in humans and ticks. Perhaps the function would
reveal why the atypical sequence similarity exists for this
gene of R. microplus. To further investigate the relationship
of TC14523 to other Dusty protein kinases with a more
powerful method of phylogenetic analysis, we performed
a BlastP and Clustal analysis of the conceptual coding
region of TC14523 followed by generation of the corresponding phylogenetic tree. Figure 2a shows the coding
region of TC14523 is most closely related a Dusty protein
kinase from sea urchin with similarities to several Dusty
protein kinases from various aquatic species and mammals. In fact, other than two Dusty protein kinases from
Apis mellifera, arthropod insect sequences seem to be
absent from the tree of close relatives to the R. microplus
sequence (Figure 2a, Additional files 1 and 2). Perhaps
this gene has been lost from most insects and the absence
of this gene from dipterans would explain why TC14523
clustered near H. sapiens in the SimiTri analysis of Figure
1aâc.

predicted protein-coding region for each R. microplus TC or
singleton was searched against the protein databases for
whole genomes (a-c) using BlastP or tick EST databases (d)
using TBlastN (E value < 1 Ã 10-8). Three translated databases are selected for comparison in each profile. The position for each tile represents its similarity to the hits in each
different genome as calculated by Blast search raw scores.
The color is coded based on the highest Blast score as: red >
300; yellow > 200; green > 150; blue > 100 and purple < 100.

Two other atypical genes in Table 2, TC7573 and TC9268
are related to actin binding. The top Blast hit for TC7573
is Destrin (E-Value = 1 Ã 10-78), an actin-depolymerizing
factor [23], however, TC7573 shows over 99% nucleotide
identity to ESTs from various Bos taurus cDNA libraries,
including those from skin, liver, and placenta, and it is
likely TC7573 is of bovine origin. TC9268 contains 2 PDZ
(postsynaptic density protein, disc-large, zonulin-1)
domains and has sequence similarity to syntenin (E-Value
= 1 Ã 10-76), which is involved in diverse physiological
processes resulting from its interaction with signaling and
adhesion molecules [24]. An EST [GenBank:CD791887]
from R. appendiculatus has 85% nucleotide identity in
the 5' region of TC9268, so this gene is present in at least
two species of ticks. BlastP and phylogenetic tree analysis
(Figure 2b) shows the coding region from TC9268 is very
similar to coding regions from shrimp, honey bee, red
fluor beetle, and several mosquitoes. A Drosophila gene
does not appear in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2b, Additional files 3 and 4), indicating a closely related sequence

The BmiGI entries were TC14523 (a), TC9268 (b), TC13445 (c) and TC12600 (d) and the TC query sequence is noted in the
figure as Rhipicephalus microplus in bold underlined text. The alignments used to generate the trees are included as Additional

to TC9268 is not present in drosophilids, perhaps being
lost from that group of species. In fact, C. elegans does not
show a close relative of TC9268 and the absence of this
gene coding region from both C. elegans and D. melanogaster would explain its atypical clustering in Figure 1b.

The top Blast hit for TC13445 is COP1 (constitutive photomorphogenic 1; E-Value = 1 Ã 10-91), a protein acting as
an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in light signaling in plants
and tumorigenesis in mammals [25]. A R. appendiculatus
EST [GenBank:CD779568.1] has 94% nucleotide identity

to TC13445. The BlastP and tree analysis (Figure 2c)
shows that other than a Tribolium castaneum orthologue,
sequences with high similarity to TC13445 seem to be
generally absent from insects. The T. castaneum orthologue has the closest relationship to the R. microplus gene,
and there is significant similarity to orthologues from
organisms as diverse as fishes, primates, and several species of plants. Although D. melanogaster and Drosophila
pseudoobscura do have sequences with limited similarity
(E-Value = 1 Ã 10-13) to TC13445, the tree analysis showed
both Drosophila sequences fell somewhat distant from the
TC13445 (Figure 2c, Additional files 5 and 6). The nematodes do not appear to have a close relative of TC13445
either and, coupled with the absence of an orthologue in
D. melanogaster with close similarity to TC13445, helps
explain the atypical clustering of this sequence in Figures
1a and 1b.
TC12600 possesses significant sequence similarity to a
protein (Q4RST5) that contains a Laminin_A domain (EValue = 1 Ã 10-124), which exists in the extracellular space,
functioning in the signaling process for morphogenesis
and also playing a structural role [26]. BlastP analysis
shows the closest relatives to the R. microplus sequence are
zebrafish, pufferfish and various mammals (Figure 2d),
with an absence of insect sequences in the phylogenetic
tree (Figure 2d, Additional files 7 and 8) indicating this
gene may have been lost from most insects. It is possible
these atypically clustering sequences, TC14523, TC9268,
TC13445, and TC12600, could represent examples of
convergent evolution resulting from the parasitic lifestyle
of ticks on their mammalian hosts subjecting the tick to
similar environmental and evolutionary pressures as
mammals. However, the atypical clustering seen in the
SimiTri analysis (Figure 1aâc, Table 2) appears to more
likely result from gene loss in the arthropod selected as a
query genome, an event more easily visualized by phylogenetic tree analysis of aligned sequences from many
genomes than SimiTri analysis which is limited to three
genomes. Additionally, the dipterans are better represented among arthropods having sequenced genomes or
significant collections of ESTs. As more non-dipteran
arthropod sequences become available, a better understanding of phylogenetic relationships will develop.
While SimiTri analysis provides a visualization of the similarity of the target genomes to three other genomes, it has
been argued that the calculated distance for each gene,
which is normalized using the sum of the blast scores
against the three genomes, can only represent the relative
distance to the three genomes. It would be preferable to
have a measure that is independent of the genome of
comparison. Also, the most highly conserved sequences
are crowded around the center and there is no clear-cut
division for designating conserved genes and genome spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/368

cific genes. The Blast Score Ratio (BSR) approach was proposed as an improvement to SimiTri analysis and BSR was
used to compare the predicted BmiGI genes to those from
other genomes [13]. Using BSR and a Blast search E-value
of 1 Ã 10-8, the translated BmiGI was compared to the proteomes of C. elegans, A. gambiae, D. melanogaster and H.
sapiens in various combinations (Figure 3). In all three
comparisons, D. melanogaster was the proteome queried
in the Y axis and over 4,000 data points have Blast hits.
The coordinates of each data point represent the distances
to two different genomes, which are calculated by the
Blast score divided by the reference. The reference is the
score of each gene Blasted against itself and serves as a
normalization factor which distinguishes the BSR
approach from SimiTri. A useful check of similarity in the
BSR analysis is to divide the plots into quadrants defined
by lines extended from both the X and Y axis at the 0.4
mark [13]. The quadrant A (orange) represents genes
present only in R. microplus while genes in quadrant B
(green) are most similar to the genome on the y axis.
Genes in quadrant C (red) are equally similar to both
genomes, and genes in quadrant D (blue) are most similar
to genomes on the x axis. A common feature to all three
plots is that more of the data are in the region above a
diagonal line of slope = 1, indicating these peptides are
more related to those of the proteome along the Y axis, D.
melanogaster. Approximately 2,300 peptides were consistently found in BSR quadrant A of all three plots, the quadrant closest to the plot's origin, indicating these genes do
not have close matches in either of the other two queried
proteomes. Also, by comparing the number of peptides
most similar to D. melanogaster (803 peptides; Figure 3a
Quadrant B) to the number most similar to C. elegans (93
peptides; Figure 3a Quadrant D), the difference is striking.
Not surprisingly, this difference decreases when substituting the proteome of A. gambiae for that of C. elegans (Figure 3b). In this case 303 and 183 peptides occur in
Quadrants B and D, respectively. It can be seen that more
points are clustered around the diagonal line in Figure 3b
than Figures 3a or 3c, indicating the R. microplus, D. melanogaster, and A. gambiae proteomes present a closer relationship than those used for the other two plots. This also
is reflected in the number of points in Quadrant C, which
represent genes common to all three proteomes. There are
1113, 1613, and 1367 peptides in Quadrant C of Figure
3a, 3b, and 3c, respectively. Another interesting point
from Figure 3c is that the numbers of peptides in Quadrant B (closer to D. melanogaster) and D (closer to H. sapiens) are 529 and 332 respectively. There are more peptides
with closer similarity to H. sapiens as opposed to D. melanogaster than might be expected based on the phylogenetic distances between the 3 species. By comparison, the
BSR analysis with D. melanogaster and C. elegans (Figure 3)
revealed 803 and 93 peptides in Quadrants B and D,
respectively. A detailed analysis of the peptides in Quad-

rant D of Figures 3a and 3c is underway to understand the
unexpectedly large number of peptides with greater similarity to the human proteome. It is likely that gene loss
events in D. melanogaster, H. sapiens, and C. elegans are
affecting this distribution as we discussed earlier in the
atypically clustering genes from the SimiTri analysis. It is
also of note that BmiGI was derived from ticks which were
not treated to remove commensal microbes. Some of
these ticks were known to be infected with B. bovis and B.
bigemina, and as noted previously, some sequences in
BmiGI appear to be from B. bovis. The genome analysis for
B. bovis was not available at the time BmiGI Version 2 was
developed. Although the percentage is expected to be low,
some of the "unique" sequences in BSR Quadrant A probably result from these commensal organisms. It is also
noteworthy that the atypical genes which SimiTri analysis
revealed as more similar to H. sapiens than D. melanogaster
mapped in the Quadrant D region of Figure 3c (closer to
H. sapiens, data not shown), indicating consistent results
from both approaches.

Figure 3
Blast Score Ratio
Comparative genomics analysis of R. microplus genes using
Comparative genomics analysis of R. microplus genes
using Blast Score Ratio. The BLAST score ratio (BSR)
approach [13] was adopted to compare the predicted BmiGI
genes to other genomes. The quadrant A (orange) represents genes present only in R. microplus while genes in quadrant B (green) are most similar to the genome on the y axis.
Genes in quadrant C (red) are equally similar to both
genomes, and genes in quadrant D (blue) are most similar to
genomes on the x axis. The comparisons have been performed using three different genomes on the x axis, C. elegans (a), A. gambiae (b) and H. sapiens (c) against D.
melanogaster on the y axis.

As the comparative analysis was performed with BmiGI,
which is an incomplete database of tick gene coding
regions, the SimiTri and BSR plots might present different
results once the entire tick genome is available for analysis. In fact, once the I. scapularis genome is available and
annotated [27], a more comprehensive SimiTri and BSR
analysis could be easily done and the I. scapularis results
compared to these presented in our study. It is our feeling
that R. microplus gene coding regions not currently represented in BmiGI are genes expressed in either highly specialized tissues or at very low levels in the tick. A
significant fraction of these genes might be involved in
regulatory processes or gene cascades and could have conserved features across a number of arthropod, or even
eukaryotic, classes of organisms. These genes would have
plotted in the central portions of SimiTri plots and in
Quadrant C of BSR plots. However, it is likely that a
number of low abundance tick-specific genes have not
been discovered during our EST sequencing and would
not be in BmiGI. Genes with little or no similarity to those
from organisms used in the SimiTri analysis would result
in data points along the edges of the plot, while in BSR
analysis, these individuals would plot in Quadrant A.
Additionally, the Blast analysis E-value can be adjusted to
act as a filter on the SimiTri and BSR results. As both SimiTri and BSR only plot sequences which pass the designated Blast E-value cutoff, these comparisons can be made
more or less stringent by varying the E-value. If a query
sequence does not have a Blast hit to any organism in
GenBank, that sequence will not get plotted during either
SimiTri or BSR analysis.
BmiGI is composed of 69% assembled TCs and 31% singletons. Thus the prot4EST translation data contains a sig-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/368

nificant proportion of small proteins resulting from
translation of incomplete open reading frames and a 3'
end bias is certainly present in EST databases generated
from polyA RNA selection methodology as used in deriving BmiGI. In the prot4EST translations of BmiGI, 18%
and 11% of the 9,494 TCs yielded translation products of
< 80 and < 60 amino acids, respectively. The 4,238 singleton translation product set had 29% and 11% of its members with < 80 and < 60 amino acids, respectively. The
combination of the likely 3' end bias of BmiGI and the
generally less conserved nature of 3' untranslated regions
could contribute to bias results of the BSR analysis toward
proteins without matches to the other two queried organisms, thus plotting in Quadrant A. Although this possible
bias should be kept in mind, the prot4EST polypeptide
prediction pipeline contains ESTscan2.0 to recognize and
separate probable protein coding regions from 5' and 3'
untranslated regions [28], reducing their impact on the
BSR analysis. As discussed in the previous paragraph, Blast
E-value will also affect BSR. These small translation products are less likely to have Blast hits to any organism than
longer proteins and, if this happens, would not appear on
the BSR plots.
Protein domain analysis
Since the blast search only gives hits for a fraction of
BmiGI, we performed a protein domain analysis to extract
more information about the coding sequences in the R.
microplus database. The RPS-Blast searches conducted
against the conserved domain database produced 3252
BmiGI entries which have hits representing 1620 unique
domains (E-value of 1 Ã 10-8). The distribution of the
number of BmiGI entry hits versus number of domains is
illustrated in Figure 4, showing that 1050 domains were
represented only once in BmiGI, while 2 domains were
represented in over 40 BmiGI entries. The ten most common domains were listed in Table 3, and these common
domains can be categorized into two groups. One group,
which includes WD40, RNA recognition motif (RRM),
serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin), and the Kunitz-type

protease inhibitor (KU) domains, consists of protein
domains that are common structural modules involved in
protein-protein interactions. The six other domains are
mainly enzymatically functional and include serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic (STKc), mixed function oxidase (P450), protease (Trypsin-like protease, peptidase
M13), esterase (carboxyesterase), and Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 catalytic domains.
To further analyze these domains, we examined the SimiTri profile of sequences identified as containing the top
five domains of Table 3 by comparing the corresponding
sequences from R. microplus with the sequences from the
proteomes of C. elegans, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens
(Figure 5). We also included the KU domain in this analysis because the KU domain has been partially character-

ized in I. scapularis [9]. With the exception of the WD40
domain, most data points are clustered in the center, indicating close similarities among all the proteomes for these
sequences. For the WD40, RRM and Trypsin-like domains,
some domain family members are not found in C. elegans,
indicated by the data points aligned on the SimiTri plot
line joining D. melanogaster and H. sapiens (Figure 5a, 5b
and 5d). Also, there is possibly divergent evolution in the
WD40 sequences as the data are somewhat spread out in
the plot (Figure 5a) as opposed to the tighter clustering
seen in the other domain sequence plots (Figure 5bâf).
Interestingly, for both the STKc and KU domains, one R.
microplus sequence is found conserved among D. melanogaster and C. elegans and absent in H. sapiens, as it maps
to the line joining D. melanogaster and C. elegans (Figure
5e, f). It is possible the corresponding STKc and KU
orthologs have been lost during the evolutionary development of the higher organism, H. sapiens. Each of these
domains play roles in fundamental cellular processes. For
example, WD domains are involved in diverse functions
such as G-protein coupling, RNA-processing, vesicular
trafficking and cell division [29]. The RRM domain provides a plastic RNA-binding platform to regulate posttranscriptional gene expression [30]. Of particular importance are the KU and protease domains, as these domains
are vital to the tick in their role as blood-feeding organisms [31].

Conclusion
This study presents the analysis of BmiGI Version 2, which
contains a significant fraction of the coding regions of the
genome of R. microplus. Our results indicate that many
genes of R. microplus are unique and have no homologs in
other sequenced genomes. With E-value = 1 Ã 10-8, only
34% of the 13,765 members of BmiGI can be assigned
one or more GO terms using this relatively liberal Blast Evalue.
Among the BmiGI members which had Blast hits, BSR
analysis found approximately 2,300 R. microplus
sequences which did not have a close match to sequences
from D. melanogaster, H. sapiens, C. elegans, or A. gambiae.
This highlights there have been unique gene evolutionary
processes in ticks and emphasizes the importance of
sequencing a tick genome to better understand tick biology. In the absence of whole genome sequence [32], EST
data is a good resource for gene discovery and will facilitate the study of acaricide resistance mechanisms in R.
microplus. Our global comparative analysis identified
some tick genes with unexpected phylogenetic relationships which detailed analysis attributed to gene losses in
some members of the animal kingdom.

Methods
R. microplus EST sequences
The construction of the R. microplus normalized cDNA
library, generation of ESTs, and assembly into the R.
microplus gene index have been described [11]. Briefly, a
single normalized cDNA library was synthesized from
pooled RNA samples which had been purified from ticks
subjected to various environmental exposures, including
heat shock, cold shock, host odor, infection with B. bovis,
and various acaricides. The acaricide exposure experiments were performed with several strains of R. microplus
which varied in their levels of susceptibility to pyrethroid,
organophosphate and the formamidine amitraz. We also
included RNA purified from eggs, nymphs, adults and dissected adult tick organs.
Comparative genomic analysis
The ESTs were clustered and assembled into tentative consensus (TC) sequences using TIGR's autoannotation pipeline tools [33], and non-clustered, non-overlapping
sequences defined as singleton sequences. GO terms [34]
were assigned automatically using customized script
based on BlastX search results. We also used PartiGene
[35] as another pipeline for EST analysis, as this open
source analytical package provided some powerful annotation options to compare to the TIGR autoannotation
pipeline results. BmiGI Version 2 was analyzed by PartiGene and, to maintain consistency, the TC and singleton
numerical designations in BmiGI were kept identical. The
protein coding regions of R. microplus were determined by
applying prot4EST [28] to BmiGI and using data from
Uniprot for the Blastp [36]. GO terms were assigned based
solely on Blast E-values using the annot8r module from
the PartiGene package.

For the SimiTri analysis [14], the program was downloaded [37] and BlastP searches were performed using the
prot4EST translated sequences from BmiGI and a cutoff Evalue < 1 Ã 10-8. Blosum62 was used as the matrix for
these searches for its strength in detecting weak similarities between proteins. The predicted proteomes of S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, A. gambiae, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens
were downloaded [38]. TblastN searches were performed
against EST databases from the ticks, R. appendiculatus and
A. variegatum [39] and I. scapularis [40]. The atypically
clustering R. microplus genes were analyzed by BlastP analysis of the conceptual open reading frames as noted in
BmiGI Version 2 followed by generation of phylogenetic
trees using ClustalW [41]and programs from the Phylip
phylogeny inference package [42]. In the Phylip package,
SEQBOOT was used at default values except with 1000
replicates, PROTPARS at default values except with 10
jumbles, and CONSENSE and at all default values. The
consensus trees were viewed using TREEVIEW [43]. Subtrees containing sequences closely related to the BmiGI

In the BLAST Score Ratio (BSR) approach [13], the conceptual translation of the R. microplus reference genome

and H. sapiens which served as Query1 and Query2. The
