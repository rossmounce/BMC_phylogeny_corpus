Abstract
Background: Thermogenic brown adipose tissue has never been described in birds or other nonmammalian vertebrates. Brown adipocytes in mammals are distinguished from the more common
white fat adipocytes by having numerous small lipid droplets rather than a single large one, elevated
numbers of mitochondria, and mitochondrial expression of the nuclear gene UCP1, the uncoupler
of oxidative phosphorylation responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis.
Results: We have identified in vitro inductive conditions in which mesenchymal cells isolated from
the embryonic chicken limb bud differentiate into avian brown adipocyte-like cells (ABALCs) with
the morphological and many of the biochemical properties of terminally differentiated brown
adipocytes. Avian, and as we show here, lizard species lack the gene for UCP1, although it is present
in amphibian and fish species. While ABALCs are therefore not functional brown adipocytes, they
are generated by a developmental pathway virtually identical to brown fat differentiation in
mammals: both the common adipogenic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-γ (PPARγ), and a coactivator of that factor specific to brown fat differentiation in
mammals, PGC1α, are elevated in expression, as are mitochondrial volume and DNA.
Furthermore, ABALCs induction resulted in strong transcription from a transfected mouse UCP1
promoter.
Conclusion: These findings strongly suggest that the brown fat differentiation pathway evolved in
a common ancestor of birds and mammals and its thermogenicity was lost in the avian lineage, with
the degradation of UCP1, after it separated from the mammalian lineage. Since this event occurred
no later than the saurian ancestor of birds and lizards, an implication of this is that dinosaurs had
neither UCP1 nor canonically thermogenic brown fat.

Background
Most mammalian species have two types of adipose tissue, white and brown fat, both of which contain adipocytes that store lipids for the production of energy.
White adipocytes (WAs) generate metabolically useful

energy, while brown adipocytes (BAs) dissipate energy in
the form of heat and are responsible for non-shivering
thermogenesis [1]. White and brown fat differ in morphology as well as function. Mature WAs contain a single
lipid droplet ('unilocular'), few mitochondria, and a

nucleus which is displaced to the cytoplasmic periphery.
BAs employ numerous mitochondria in heat production.
Their lipid is packaged in multiple droplets ('multilocular') and their nuclei are centrally located. The inner mitochondrial membrane of BAs contains uncoupling protein
1 (UCP1). While an alternative non-shivering thermogenesis pathway has been proposed recently for mammalian
brown adipocytes [2], in canonical non-shivering thermogenesis heat production depends entirely on UCP1, which
facilitates proton leakage and short-circuits oxidative
phosphorylation [3].
Although birds can maintain their body temperature by
non-shivering thermogenesis and form multilocular adipocytes in response to cold acclimation [4,5] they lack
functional BAT [4,6]. Expression of UCP1 is the hallmark
of BAs, being absent in WAs, and is the only member of
the UCP multigene family to have unambiguous uncoupling activity under physiological conditions [3]. No
homologs of this gene have been identified in any bird
species [7] (although birds have the paralogous avUCP
[8]). While UCP1 is present in both fish [9] and amphibians [10], its function in cold-blooded animals is
unknown.
Most studies on adipogenesis have focused on the development of white adipose tissue. WA differentiation has
three distinct steps. First, mesenchymal stem cells transform into committed preadipocytes, which have a fibroblastic morphology. Second, white preadipocytes divide
until cell-cell contact inhibits their proliferation [11,12].
Third, in the presence of the appropriate differentiation
factors (in in vitro studies), these preadipocytes enter the
cell cycle again, divide at least two more times and finally
differentiate into WAs [11,12].
Terminal differentiation of WAs is preceded by the induction of CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins beta (C/EBPβ)
and delta (C/EBPδ), which in turn mediate the transcriptional activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor γ (PPARγ) and C/EBPα. PPARγ is a key factor of
WA differentiation [11,12] and its forced expression in
non-adipogenic fibroblasts is sufficient to induce adipogenesis [13]. Thus, PPARγ plays a crucial role in the
expression of many, and perhaps most, fat-cell-specific
genes [12], including those specifying adipocyte-specific
fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4) [14] and other proteins involved in lipid homeostasis [12].
While less is known about BA differentiation, several steps
occur in common with white adipogenesis. During the
initial steps, the mesenchymal progenitor cells become
committed as fibroblast-like preadipocytes. Although
these cannot be distinguished morphologically from
white preadipocytes [12] their gene expression signature is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/17

already different from the latter at this stage [15]. The key
WA differentiation transcriptional factor, PPARγ, is also
involved in BA differentiation [16-18]. However, while
PPARγ is necessary and sufficient to induce the WA differentiation program, it is necessary but not sufficient for BA
differentiation. In addition, a PPARγ interacting protein,
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator
1α (PGC-1α), which is expressed preferentially in BAs relative to WAs, is required to generate the former cell type
[19]. In muscle cells, PGC-1α mediates the increase in
mitochondria by stimulating gene expression of nuclear
respiratory factors (NRF) 1 and 2, and consequently mitochondrial transcriptional factor A (mitTFA) [20].
Here we report that a stem cell-like mesenchymal population derived from embryonic avian limb buds can be
induced to differentiate into BA-like cells in vitro. We show
that whereas UCP1 is absent from the chicken genome
[10,21], foreclosing the development of authentic BAs,
the conditions that induce avian BA-like cells (ABALCs)
elicit expression of a virtually complete mammalian-like
BA differentiation pathway, to the extent that transfected
mouse UCP1 promoter is strongly activated. The unusual
circumstance of a gene being present in a conserved chromosomal context in fish, amphibians and mammals, but
not birds, prompted us to look for it in the same context
in the recently mapped Anolis lizard genome, where it was
also absent. This suggests that the gene, and the capacity
to produce brown fat, were lost no later than in the saurian common ancestor of birds and lizards, a lineage that
also included all theropod dinosaurs.

Results and Discussion
Brown adipocyte-like morphology in cultured limb bud
mesenchyme
The distal tip mesoderm of the embryonic chicken limb
bud at 5 days of incubation contains no cells of the myogenic lineage [22,23], but this limb bud mesenchyme
(LBM) can be induced to differentiate into cartilage
[24,25] or fibroblasts [26] by growth under different density and culture conditions. When grown at low density in
adipocyte differentiation medium (ADM) containing
horse serum (HS), LBM gave rise to a cell population
which contained numerous small Oil-red positive lipid
droplets (Figure 1a, c), which did not fuse even after 22
days in cell culture (Figure 1a, b). In contrast, vascular
stromal cells (VSCs), a characterized population of
chicken white fat preadipocytes [27], grown under the
same conditions, gave rise to cells containing a few large
droplets of Oil red-staining lipid, which fused, forming
even larger droplets (Figure 1d).

Both cell origin and treatment regimen were critical for
producing what we term ABALCs. When LBM cells were
grown in ADM with chicken serum (CS), for example,

they differentiated into cells with the WA phenotype (Figure 1e), and when they were grown in ADM with fetal
bovine serum (FBS) they showed no adipocyte-like morphological features (Figure 1f). Significantly, cells grown
in FBS for 8 days nonetheless constituted a bipotential
preadipocyte population, since when they were transferred into a medium containing CS or HS they uniformly
differentiated into WAs or ABALCs, respectively (data not
shown). We therefore refer to them as limb bud-derived
preadipocytes (LBPAs).
Transmission EM was used to compare the morphology of
ABALCs with WAs obtained from the abdominal fat pads
of 20-day chicken embryos. ABALCs were irregularly
shaped and had many cell processes (Figure 2a). Their
nuclei were relatively large and not compressed to the
periphery by the lipid droplets as in abdominal fat cells,
in which the lipid droplets occupied most of the cell space
(Figure 2b). Cross-sectional area measurements [28,29]
indicated that ABALCs were smaller than abdominal fat
pad WAs (Table 1). The mean volume of a mitochondrion
was similar in both ABALCs and WAs, but mean mitochondrial volume density (Vv) was five-fold higher in
ABALCs than in WAs (Tables 2 and 3). The mean volume
of ABALC lipid droplets was significantly smaller than
those of abdominal fat cells, while the number density of
these lipid droplets was much higher than that in WAs
(Table 3). Measurements of the ABALC lipid droplets
revealed that about 98% had cross-sectional areas of less
than 1.5 μm2, while the areas of the rest ranged from 1.5
to 7.0 μm2 (Additional file 1). In contrast, the cross-sec-

tional areas of 50% of the lipid droplets in WAs were
larger than 7.0 μm2, and ranged from 7.0 to 1,262.2 μm2
(Table 1 and Additional file 1). These dramatic morphological differences between ABALCs and chicken WAs, as
well as qualitative similarities between ABALCs and mammalian BAs, motivated us to take a closer look at these presumptive avian 'brown fat' cells.
ABALCs utilize common pathways of adipocyte
differentiation
As assayed by comparative quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), both PPARγ
and FABP4 mRNAs were expressed in ABALCs. The levels
of expression of each gene were significantly higher in
ABALCs than in LBPAs and in progenitor LBM, although
they were highest in WAs differentiated from VSCs in culture (Figure 3a, b). Oil-red positive lipid staining, together
with increased levels of PPARγ and FABP4, indicate that
ABALCs are indeed adipocytes.
ABALC induction involves pathways specific to BA
differentiation
We found that expression of PGC-1α mRNA was 5 to 10
times higher in ABALCs than in LBM, LBPAs, WAs
obtained from VSCs (VSCAs) in vitro, or late embryonic
white fat cells (Figure 3c). Similarly, the expression of
mRNA for PPARα and DiO2 (Type II iodothyronine deiodinase), additional proteins previously found to be upregulated in BAs relative to their preadipocytes or WAs
[30,31], was increased in ABALCs in comparison to VSC
adipocytes (Figure 3d). Thus, ABALCs not only resemble
mammalian BAs morphologically but also with respect to
their molecular signature.

The ability to quantify PGC-1α mRNA expression provided an opportunity to assay the relationship between
the expression of this gene and mitochondrial biogenesis
in the various cell types of the adipogenic lineage. This
required more straightforward means for measuring mitochondrial parameters than the morphometric analysis of
electron micrographs described above (see Table 2). First

we stained LBM, LBPAs, limb bud-derived WAs and
ABALCs with JC-1, a dye that accumulates specifically in
mitochondria [32]. Flow cytometry demonstrated that
ABALCs had the highest red fluorescence per cell among
all of these cell types (Figure 4). Although red fluorescence
of JC-1 can be indicative of high mitochondrial membrane potential [32], the fact that the red-to-green fluorescence ratio of the ABALC mitochondria was no greater
than the ratios of both LBM and LBPAs (data not shown)
indicated that the observed elevated red fluorescence was
indeed due to increased mitochondrial volume. Next we
used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure mtDNA and
found that ABALCs had about 10 times as many copies of
this genome as LBM, LBPAs, or WAs (Figure 5). Thus,
ABALCs, which have increased levels of PGC-1α mRNA
relative to their progenitor cells, also have increased mitochondrial volume and elevated levels of mtDNA compared with progenitor cells, the bipotential preadipocytes
derived from the latter, or the differentiated cells of white
fat.
The chicken and lizard genomes lack the UCP1 gene
The hallmark of mammalian BAs is the uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation UCP1, which gives brown fat the
unique ability to produce heat. Neither UCP1 nor a
homolog of this gene have been identified in any bird species. Interestingly, UCP1 has been found in the genomes
of several fish species [9] and amphibians [10], where it is
flanked by the Elmod2 and Tbc1d9 genes, as it is in mammals [9]. We compared the genomic regions containing
the UCP1 gene in Homo sapiens, the mouse Mus musculus,
the frog Xenopus tropicalis, the lizard Anolis carolinensis, and
the zebrafish Danio rerio, with the corresponding
sequences in the chicken Gallus gallus (Figure 6). The
regions between the Elmod2 and Tbc1d9 genes in the

chicken [10,21] and lizard genomes do not contain any
open reading frames specifying peptides homologous to
UCP1, nor is there significant similarity at the DNA level.
Correspondingly, the length of this region is markedly
smaller in chicken and lizard compared with the species
which have a UCP1 gene (Figure 6 and Table 4). Blast
search against the chicken nucleotide database using
mouse or D. rerio UCP1 mRNA sequences revealed significant similarity only with mRNA sequences of the UCP1
paralog avUCP.
Activation of an exogenous UCP1 promoter during ABALC
differentiation
Despite the lack of the UCP1 gene in the chicken, our
findings suggested that cells derived from the limb bud of
this species express the necessary regulatory components
for the differentiation of BAs. We found that expression of
the avian uncoupling protein avUCP was not upregulated,
and indeed substantially declined, under ABALC-inducing conditions (data not shown). We reasoned, however,
that if ABALCs were similar to mammalian BAs except for
the absence of UCP1, differentiating ABALCs should be
able to activate an exogenously provided mammalian
UCP1 promoter. To test this hypothesis we transfected
ABALCs, VSC adipocytes and preadipocytes with a mouse
UCP1 promoter-Luciferase construct [33] and assayed relative transcriptional activity in these cell types. We found
that the mouse UCP1 promoter was strongly activated in
ABALCs and slightly in LBPAs, but not at all in adipocytes
obtained from VSCs (Figure 7). The inability of chicken
VSC adipocytes to activate the mouse UCP1 promoter is
in agreement with the finding that during mammalian
WA differentiation in vivo UCP1 promoter is never activated [34]. The ability of ABALCs to activate the UCP1
promoter, however, indicates that rather than being an

Conclusion and evolutionary implications
We have shown that adipocytes with the brown fat phenotype, termed ABALCs, can be induced in embryonic
chicken mesenchymal cells in vitro. ABALCs not only share
morphology with mammalian BAs but also express the

While it has been suggested that BAs and WAs originate
from a common population of mesenchymal cells, it is
not known how and at what stage the differentiation
pathways diverge from one another. The view that BAT
and WAT are distinct terminally differentiated tissues is

supported by their different functions and morphological
features [11] and the fact that precursor cells isolated from
brown or white fat differentiate into BAs and WAs, respectively, in vitro [35]. Furthermore, BAs and WAs have different 'expression signatures' [15]. It is still not clear,
however, if mesenchymal cells of different origin have
restricted ability to differentiate into BAs or WAs or,
rather, if the location of those mesenchymal cells determines their differentiation fate. Our results confirm earlier
findings [34,36] that plasticity of mesenchymal cells is
already lost in VSC preadipocytes, since these precursor
cells were not able to differentiate into ABALCs in
response to the stimulus that elicits this phenotype from
LBM.
Most significantly, because LBM can give rise with near
uniformity to adipocytes with white and brown fat cellular phenotypes under different culture conditions, our
results suggest that LBM may be a source of a common BA
and WA stem cell, which up to now has proved elusive
[11]. If it can be confirmed that LBM of mammalian species indeed generates both WA and authentic BA, this system would be ideal for studying the relationship between

the different adipocyte differentiation pathways, a growing issue in obesity research [11,12].
Results with knockout mice demonstrate that even in
mammals the developmental pathway for producing multilocular adipose tissue does not depend on UCP1 [2]. If
thermogenic brown fat evolved before the loss of UCP1
during avian evolution, the non-thermogenic brown fatlike tissue that would have remained could have had its
own adaptive function. Indeed, all reports of BAT-like tissue in birds and turtles have described it as highly vascularized [5,37,38], suggesting that it can serve as source of
fuel which can be rapidly mobilized and transported to
other sites (for example, muscles), in the form of fatty
acids [39].
While the UCP1 gene is absent in the chicken, we have
demonstrated that the developmental pathway that generates brown fat in mammals is otherwise intact. Attempts
to identify UCP1 in avian species other than chickens
have been unsuccessful [7]. The most parsimonious explanation for the absence of the UCP1 gene in both the
chicken and the Anolis lizard is that it was lost in a com-

saurs than to those of birds. Further investigations of the
possible occurrence of the UCP1 gene and the BA pathway
in testudine reptiles (that is, turtles and tortoises) should
clarify the evolutionary history of brown fat as well as the
phylogenetic relationships among modern amniotes.

Homeotherms, such as mammals and birds, have adaptations that protect developing offspring and young from
the ill effects of cold. In mammals, the embryos are
mainly incubated internally and brown adipose tissue is
particularly abundant at juvenile stages. Oviparous birds
and presumably dinosaurs, lacking thermogenic BAT
(although, notably, an egg-laying mammal, the platypus,
has a UCP1 gene; Table 4), would require other means,
which in birds include feathers, brooding incubation, and
non-shivering thermogenesis mediated by expression of
avUCP in muscles [39,40]. No information is available
concerning avUCP in dinosaurs, but it is not likely that
these large featherless animals were effective brooders.
The lack of thermogenic BAT may thus have been more of
a liability to the developing embryos of oviparous dino-

rpm in a microcentrifuge in microfuge tubes to form a soft
pellet. The pellet was fixed for 1 hour, gently scooped off
the bottom of the tube and further fixed overnight (16 to
18 hours) at 4°C with a chilled (4°C) fixative containing
3% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformadehyde, 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (MW 10,000), 4% sucrose and 2 mM
CaCl2, prepared in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer with a final pH
of 7.4. The pellet was post-fixed in 1% Osmium tetroxide
for 1 hour, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol,
embedded in Spurr's resin and polymerized at 60°C. In

stromal cell adipocytes. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized with Renilla luciferase. Normalized Firefly luciferase
activities were compared using one-way analysis of variance
using the Tukey test. Results are shown as means ± standard
error (N = 8).

addition, abdominal fat pads from 15-day chicken
embryos were fixed, dehydrated and embedded in resin in
the same fashion. Thin sections (silver in interface) from
the resin blocks were mounted on copper grids, stained
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using
JEOL or Hitachi electron microscopes.
Morphometry
Electron micrographs (24.7 × 18.1 cm2) were obtained
from random fields at a magnification of × 7,500. The
magnification was checked at frequent intervals using a
carbon graticule. Volume densities (Vv) of 'cytoplasm'
(area of the cell which excludes nucleus, mitochondria,
and fat droplets), nucleus, mitochondria, and fat droplets
of adipocytes were determined by point counting [29]
using a transparent grid with 682 intersections. Number
densities (number per μm2 of cell) of mitochondria and
fat droplets of the adipocytes were also determined
[28,29]. The β values for the calculation of the number
density [28,29] of mitochondria and fat droplets were
determined by taking measurements from over 275 mitochondria and fat droplets of adipocytes of tissue cultures
from each treatment and abdominal fat pads using the
NIH Image J program. Cross-sectional areas of fat droplets
were determined from electron micrographs, and crosssectional areas of whole fat cells were determined on Toluidine blue stained semi-thin sections from the same resin
blocks, using NIH Image J.
Oil-red staining
Cell cultures were washed with 1× PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4) and fixed for 10 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 1× PBS. Cells were then briefly
rinsed in 1× PBS and stained with a 0.5% Oil-Red O
(Fluka) solution in isopropanol/water (6:4) for 1 hour at
room temperature. Cells were washed in 1× PBS and
stained with Hematoxylin (Fisher) for 2 minutes and then
washed again in 1× PBS. Microscopic pictures were
obtained with an Zeiss Axiovert 40C microscope
equipped with an Olympus C7070 digital camera.

Figure 8
Partial cladogram of the vertebrates
Partial cladogram of the vertebrates. Taxa in which UCP1 are known to be present are indicated by a red dot. Those in
which UCP1 is known to be absent are indicated by a black dot. The question mark indicates the span within the evolutionary
history of the amniotes during which UCP1 and the capacity to produce functional brown fat was lost.

Comparative qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures or cells with the
RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed by AMV
(Fisher). Briefly, 200 to 1,000 ng of RNA and Oligo dT
(0.5 μg primer per 1 μg of RNA) was heated at 70°C for 5
minutes. The tube was chilled on ice for 5 minutes and a
master mix containing AMV buffer, dNTPs (1 mM each
base), 40 units ribonuclease inhibitor and 30 units AMV
RT was added. The reaction was performed at 42°C for 1
hour and stopped by AMV inactivation by heating at 80°C
for 3 minutes. Genomic and mitochondrial DNA were
isolated using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen). Comparative qPCR was performed on the Mx3005P instrument (Stratagene) using Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR
master mix, and following the standard comparative
qPCR protocol. All primers (Additional file 2) were
designed using the Beacon Designer program (Premier
Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA).
Flow cytometry
Cell cultures were washed with Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) and JC-1 dye diluted in 500 μl of DMEM to a
final concentration of 2 μM was added to each well. Cells
were incubated for 10 minutes in a 5% CO2 incubator and
washed with EBSS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and then dissociated in TrypLe Express, counted and resuspended in
EBSS with a density of 106 cells per ml. Freshly isolated
mesenchymal cells were resuspended in EBSS with 2 μM
JC-1 and placed for 10 minutes in a CO2 incubator. The

cells were then washed and resuspended in EBSS. The forward and right angle scatter, as well as green and red fluorescence emissions of cultured and mesenchymal cells,
were measured in a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Data were acquired and analyzed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences).
UCP1 promoter activation assay
A mouse UCP1 promoter pGL/basic construct [33] was a
gift from Dr. J Rim and Dr. L Kozak. LBM cells or VSCs
were grown in plating medium for 1 day. The transfection
complexes containing siPORT-XP-1 (Applied Biosystems), 200 ng of pGL-UCP1 promoter-Firefly Luciferase
construct, 20 ng pGL-TK Renilla Luciferase construct
(Promega) and OptiMem (Invitrogen) were added on the
second day with ADM without antibiotics. Mouse UCP1
promoter activation was estimated on the second day after
transfection by the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay
(Promega) in a model 20/20 luminometer (Turner Biosystems).
