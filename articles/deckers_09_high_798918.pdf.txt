Abstract
The known strains of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) represent genotypic variants of a single
species, and HCMV genotypic variability has been studied in order to reveal correlations between
different disease patterns and the presence of certain HCMV genotypes, either as single or as
multiple infections. The methods used for the detection of HCMV genotypes have not always been
sophisticated enough to achieve complete comprehensiveness, mainly because only one genotype
is usually detected in a certain specimen, due to primer specificity and genome copy number. To
improve detection of variant HCMV genotypes in mixed infections, we developed PCR assays with
degenerate primers targeting two variable HCMV genes, glycoprotein B (gB, UL55) and the Gprotein-coupled receptor gene UL33. Primers were designed to bind conserved sites in the
genomes of HCMV variants and great ape CMVs. To analyse if samples contained one or more
HCMV genotypic variants, PCR assays were supplemented with oligonucleotides containing locked
nucleic acids. This broad-range PCR methodology and subsequent sequence analysis detected all
gB/UL55 and UL33 genotypic variants known to date in primary clinical specimens, but also revealed
that many samples contained genotype mixtures. Importantly, a novel UL33 genotypic variant could
be discovered in several specimens, and one HCMV isolate was plaque-purified containing the novel
UL33 genotype and a so far undescribed variant of gB.

Introduction
The existence of genotypic variants of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was first reported by Chou & Dennison [1]
by analysing glycoprotein B (gB) gene sequences spanning
the gB cleavage site (CLS) of different HCMV isolates.

Four distinct CLS genotypes (gBCLS-1 to -4) were reported.
Later it was shown that gB exhibits variability also at the
N-terminus (gBN-1 to -4) as well as at the C-terminus
(gBC-1 to -2) [2]. Further studies provided evidence for
homologous recombination between gBCLS, gBN and gBC

genotypes [3]. A fifth gBCLS genotype was detected in several AIDS patients [4]. More recently, additional distinct
gBN sequences were described in AIDS patients, but not
assigned to a genotype numbering system [5,6]. Several
laboratories investigated HCMV genotype variability
using PCR-based methods to unravel possible relationships between certain HCMV CLS genotypes and disease
outcome, and although results have been conflicting at
times, the occurrence of infections with more than one
HCMV genotype and its impact on severity of HCMV disease has been considered crucial [reviewed in [7-14]].
For studies of these types, a comprehensive detection of
all HCMV variants is highly desirable. In principle, this
can be done with a set of independent and specific PCR
assays, e.g., specific multiplex PCR, by restriction length
polymorphism analysis, or by microarrays [1,15-17].
However, sequences of unknown HCMV variants would
remain undetected. This is a serious drawback, in particular because recent discoveries of non-human CMV in both
chimpanzees and gorillas revealed a considerably higher
diversity than in humans [18].
An unprejudiced way of analysing specimens for the presence of known and unknown herpesviruses is to perform
PCR with degenerate primers targeting highly conserved
sites within the herpesvirus genome. Such assays proved
to be highly effective in the discovery of herpesviruses
[reviewed in [19]]. However, in mixed herpesvirus infections, usually only one viral genome is preferentially
amplified, due to genome copy number or preferential
primer binding. Using oligonucleotides substituted with
locked nucleic acids (LNA), we recently developed a variant of the universal herpesvirus PCR and applied it to the
detection of unknown herpesviruses in Old World monkeys. Up to three different monkey herpesviruses could be
amplified from single specimens, thereby revealing the
presence of hitherto unknown herpesviruses [20].
The aim of the present study was to universally determine
variable genotypes of two HCMV genes, gB (UL55) and
UL33. The latter encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR) and is present in human and animal CMVs. UL33
signals constitutively, interferes with cellular signaling
networks and modulates cellular function after infection,
thereby probably contributing to HCMV-associated
pathology [[21,22]; reviewed in [23]]. UL33 exhibits
sequence variability but this information came from a
limited number of strains [24]. Here we studied whether
variable genotypes of HCMV gB and the UL33-encoded
GPCR both can be universally and differentially identified
in human clinical specimens by degenerate and LNA-substituted PCR.

Methods
Sample collection, cell culture, and DNA preparation
Twenty-eight blood samples pre-tested positive for HCMV
with a pan-herpes PCR assay [25] were selected from a
random collection of bone marrow transplanted, HCMVseropositive children and from patients suffering from
HIV infection or from different haematologic diseases.
DNA was extracted by standard methods.

In addition, a collection of 89 HCMV patient isolates was
analyzed after virus expansion on human MRC-5 fibroblasts (ATCC CCL-171, passages 3-15) upon HCMV isolation from various clinical specimens (throat washing,
urine, EDTA blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) which
were simultaneously tested to be HCMV DNA-positive by
routine PCR detecting HCMV polymerase. DNA was
extracted from the pellets of infected cells after the second
to sixth-passage. Plaque purification of HCMV isolates
was performed using MRC-5 cells by limiting dilution of
supernatants of infected cultures in log2 steps in a 96-well
plate format. Wells containing a single plaque were harvested 7 days post infection followed by a second plaque
purification using 48-well plates. HCMV plaques were
then propagated in a 6-well plate the cells of which were
used for DNA preparation by standard methods.
Consensus-PCR assays for the amplification of genotypic
variants of glycoprotein B (UL55)
For the comprehensive amplification of the CLS of HCMV
gB genes, degenerate and deoxyinosine-substituted (deg/
dI) primers were deduced from the gB/UL55 gene of
HCMV strain AD169 in a nested format (primer set CMVgBp1; Table 1). Binding sites were selected on the basis of
a multiple alignment of all human and primate CMV gB
genes available in Genbank. Primers were degenerated
and substituted with deoxyinosine at their 3'-end. PCR
was performed with up to 12.3 μl of DNA, containing a
maximum of 250 ng DNA, in first round amplification.
PCR mix (12,7 μl; containing 1× AmpliTaq™ buffer, 2,0
mM MgCl2, 2-5% DMSO, the four dNTPs at 200 mM
each, 2.0 units of AmpliTaq Gold Polymerase and 1 μM of
each sense- and antisense primer) and - if necessary water was added to achieve a total volume of 25 μl. For
second round amplification, 1 μl of the first-round amplification product was added. Thermal cycling was performed in thermocyclers of type TgradientS (Biometra,
Germany), under the following conditions: Initial denaturation 95°C for 2 min, 40 cycles with denaturation at
95°C for 30 sec, annealing at 46°C for 30 sec and elongation at 72°C for 1 min; final elongation at 72°C for 10
min. The annealing-to-elongation phase (ramp-time) was
prolonged to 0,09°C/min. The PCR reactions were performed in duplicate.

A second nested deg/dI primer set was selected (primer set
CMV-gBp2; Table 1) which amplifies two thirds of the
CMV gB/UL55 gene comprising the N-terminal variable
region and the CLS of gB. PCR was performed with the
TaKaRa-Ex PCR system (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) using the
following protocol: The reaction mixture was set up on ice
and contained 50 μL of ExTaq buffer with MgCl2, 400 μM
of each dNTP, 400 nM of each primer, 2.5 units of TaKaRa
ExTaq polymerase (TaKaRa Bio Inc, Japan). Thirty cycles
of amplification were performed, each cycle consisting of
a denaturing step at 98°C for 20 sec, an annealing step at
45°C for 30 sec and an elongation step at 72°C. The duration of the elongation step in the first 15 cycles was 7 minutes and in the last 15 cycles 10 min +5 sec ramp time for
each cycle. The final elongation step was performed for 30
minutes at 72°C. The PCR reactions were performed in
duplicate.

described above. The PCR reactions were performed in
duplicate.
PCR for specific amplification of the UL33-5 gene
UL33-5 sequences were amplified with the primer set
4347-s (5'-CGTTCAACTTACAT AGTTTTGACG-3') and
4347-as (5'-GCGTCTGTAGCGCCACAAAAG-3') at 61°C
annealing temperature. Amplified products had a size of
346 bp.

The primers of the second round of CMV-gBp1 and CMVgBp2 amplified fragments of approximately 550 bp and
1590 bp, respectively. Binding regions of all gB primers
are depicted in Figure 1.

Design of LNA-oligonucleotides specific for gB/UL55 and
UL33 genes
Four LNA-oligonucleotides (TIB MOLBIOL GmbH, Berlin, Germany) were designed to specifically inhibit the
amplification of one of the HCMV gB genotypes 1 to 4.
Their binding sites were located in the region of the CLS.
The four HCMV UL33 genotypes were targeted by only
three LNA-oligonucleotides (LNA-HCMV-UL33-1/2, -3
and -4) because for the closely related genotypes UL33-1
and -2, selection of discriminating LNA-oligonucleotides
was not possible. Therefore, the common LNA-oligonucleotide UL33-1/2 was used (Figures 1 and 2; Table 2).

Consensus-PCR assay for the amplification of genotypic
variants of UL33
For the broad amplification of full-length HCMV UL33
genes (plus short, flanking regions of UL32 and UL34
sequences), nested deg/dI sense primers were deduced
from the UL32 gene and antisense-primers from the UL34
gene of HCMV strain AD169 (primer set CMV-UL33;
Table 1). Primer binding sites were selected on the basis of
multiple alignments which comprised all UL32 and UL34
genes, respectively, of human and primate CMV available
in Genbank. Primers were degenerated and substituted
with deoxyinosine at their 3'-end. Primers used in the second round amplified fragments of approximately 1700
bp, and primer binding regions are depicted in Figure 1.
PCR was performed with the TaKaRa-Ex PCR system as

Sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree construction
PCR product purification, direct sequencing with dye terminator chemistry, as well as nucleotide and amino acid
sequence analysis were performed as described [26].
Sequencing reactions were performed on both strands
with a total redundancy of at least four-fold. Sequence
chromatograms were assembled with the Seqman module
of the Lasergene software (GATC, Konstanz, Germany).
BLAST searches were performed using the NCBI database.
ORF prediction, calculation of identity values and multiple sequence alignments (ClustalW) were performed
using MacVector software (Version 10.0). For phylogenetic tree construction, a nucleotide sequence alignment
was analysed with the neighbor-joining method (MacVector). Alternatively, the Proml module of the PHYLIP pro-

Numerical designation of genotypes and nucleotide
sequence accession numbers
The gB sequences of published HCMV strains were
assigned to gBCLS genotype numbers 1-4 according to the
numbering in earlier studies [1,4]: Merlin [GenBank acc.no. NC_006273], gBCLS genotype 1; Towne [AY315197],
gBCLS genotype 1; AD169 [NC_001347], gBCLS genotype 2;
Toledo [AC146905], gBCLS genotype 3; and isolate C194A
[M60926] gBCLS genotype 4. The complete gB UL55
sequence of the HCMV S3 isolate was determined here for
comparative purposes [GU180092]. The acc.-no. for
chimpanzee cytomegalovirus (CCMV) UL-33 shown in
figure 3 is [NC_003521].

We did not find a numbering system for UL33 genotypes
in the literature, but we observed by phylogenetic tree
construction that the published HCMV UL33 genes clearly
branch in four clades (not shown). Therefore, we assigned
the UL33 genotypes to numbers 1-4 for the purpose of this
study (Figure 3). The novel UL33 genotype, presented
here, was tentatively named UL33-5. The gB UL55 and
UL33 sequences of the novel HCMV variant (HCMV-C5)
were deposited in GenBank under the acc.-nos.
[GU180093] and [GU180094], respectively.

Results
Universal screening of human blood for the presence of
variant HCMV gB/UL55 genotypes
In order to test the ability of the CMV-gBp1 PCR to universally detect all known CLS genotypes of HCMV gB, a random collection of 28 HCMV-positive clinical blood
specimens (S1-S28) was tested with the CMV-gBp1 PCR
(without LNA addition). Amplimers were sequenced and
the genotype determined. All known gBCLS genotypes
(types 1 to 5) were detected. The genotype gBCLS-1 was
detected in 13/28, gBCLS-2 in 2/28, gBCLS-3 in 10/28,
gBCLS-4 in 2/28 and gBCLS-5 in 1/28 specimens (Table 3).
The sequences differed only slightly from the published
sequences or were identical (data not shown).

The existence of mixed infections with different HCMV
variants was analysed by repeating the PCR in the presence of an LNA-oligonucleotide perfectly matching the gB
genotype detected in the first experiment. Prior to use of
these LNA-oligonucleotides, we confirmed that they specifically inhibited the amplification of a perfectly matching gB genotype in the CMV-gBp1 PCR (not shown). In
additional pre-tests, we achieved selective amplification
of a single CLS genotype from mixtures of strains, representing four CLS genotypes, using CMV-gBp1 PCR and up
to three LNA oligonucleotides. These pre-tests were carried out in the same manner as reported by Prepens et al.
[20], and are not described in detail.
In the presence of the genotype-specific LNA-oligonucleotides, an amplimer was obtained by CMV-gBp1 PCR
from 9/28 HCMV-positive blood specimens. Sequence

analysis revealed the presence of a second CLS genotype in
each of the nine specimens. The PCR assay was repeated
again, this time in the presence of two LNA-oligonucleotides in each reaction mixture. In one sample, a third CLS
genotype was found. Thus, upon addition of the respective LNA, gBCLS-2 and -3 were detected in initially gBCLS 1-positive specimens, gBCLS-3 and/or gBCLS-5 in gBCLS-2-

specimens and gBCLS-1 or gBCLS-3 in gBCLS-4-positive specimens (Table 3). In summary, LNA supplementation of
the PCR enabled the differentiation of a total of 38 CLS
sequences, ten more than with degenerate PCR alone.

ence of splice sites. In sample S12, a contiguous consensus
sequence of 1715 bp spanning the 5'-end of the inversely
oriented UL32, the complete UL33-5 ORF and the 5'-end
of UL34 identified strong and conserved splice donor and
acceptor signals (not shown). The spliced UL33-5 gene
was determined to be 1242 bp in length (Exon 1: 27 bp;
exon 2: 1212 bp) with a coding capacity of 413 amino
acids. Based on a multiple amino acid alignment of UL33
proteins, putative structural receptor domains are shown
in Figure 4.

Phylogenetic analysis of UL33 genotypes
Figure 3
Phylogenetic analysis of UL33 genotypes. UL33 proteins (Figure 4) were aligned to construct a phylogenetic tree
using the Neighbor-joining method. A rooted phylogram is
shown, with the UL33 of the chimpanzee cytomegalovirus
CCMV as outlier. The branch length is proportional to evolutionary distance (scale bar). Results of bootstrap analysis
(1000 replicates) are indicated at the nodes of the tree.
Universal screening of human blood samples for the
presence of HCMV UL33 genotypes
The same set of 28 primary specimens was tested for the
presence of different UL33 genotypes with the CMV-UL33
primer set and - in subsequent experiments - in the presence of UL33-type-specific LNA-oligonucleotides. Single
UL33 genotypes were detected in 23 samples, and 2 genotypes in five samples. All known UL33 genotypes known
to date (types 1 to 4; Table 3) were detected. Without LNA
addition, UL33-1, UL33-2, UL33-3 and UL33-4 were
detected in 9, 11, 3 and 5 samples, respectively. The
sequences differed only slightly from the published
sequences or were identical (data not shown). Upon addition of the respective LNA, UL33-4 was detected in initially UL33-1-positive samples and UL33-1 in UL33-3positive samples. Most importantly, a hitherto unknown
HCMV UL33 genotype was discovered: from a primary
blood specimen (S12), genotype 1 was initially amplified,
but after addition of LNA-UL33-1 to the PCR reaction the
novel UL33 sequence was detected (Table 3). It was tentatively named HCMV UL33 genotype 5 (UL33-5) (Table 3).

In pairwise sequence comparisons, UL33-5 was the most
distant genotype, compared to the other four genotypes. It
was most closely related to UL33-2 (88% at the nucleic
acid level and 93% at the aa level). In phylogenetic analysis using the Neighbor-joining method, the UL33-5 genotype formed a branch with UL33-1 and -2 (Figure 3). In
Maximum-Likelihood analysis, the same tree toplogy was
obtained (not shown).

Isolation and plaque-purification of a virus containing the
novel genotype UL33-5
Next, we wanted to isolate HCMV carrying the novel
UL33-5 genotype. Since the clinical specimen S12 was not
suitable for cell culture experiments, we collected eightynine additional specimens which had been tested positive
for HCMV in routine diagnostics, and cultured them on
MRC-5 cells. Early-passage cultures were analysed with
the primer set 4347 which specifically detects UL33-5 but
not UL33-1 to UL33-4. Fifteen samples (17%) were positive. Since these cultures were also mixtures of strains
(data not shown), we re-tested five of them (C1-C5) with
the degenerate primer set CMV-UL33 in order to identify
a sample which predominantly contains a virus with the
UL33-5 genotype. This was the case with culture C5. It was
UL33-5-positive in both PCR assays and therefore contained a virus with the UL33-5 genotype as a majority in
the strain mixture (Table 3). HCMV-C5 was then plaquepurified by limiting dilution. After two rounds of plaque
purification, seven plaques were isolated and passaged
once. PCR followed by sequence analysis revealed that all
contained UL33-5. To study the gB gene of this virus in
more detail, we used two degenerate primer sets, CMVgBp1 and CMV-gBp2. The latter amplified two thirds
(roughly 1.6 kb) of the gB gene including both the N-terminus and the CLS. Sequence analysis revealed a CLS
sequence similar to that of AD169 (gBCLS-2). However, it
differed from AD169 at the N-terminus, and was identical
to a divergent gB sequence detected by Steininger et al. in
an AIDS patient [5]. Thus, we concluded that HCMV-C5
contains a so far undescribed gBCLS/gBN combination. Reinspection of the UL33-1/UL33-5-positive specimen S12
with the CMV-gBp2 PCR revealed the same gBCLS/gBN
combination (although in the previous experiment with
CMV-gBp1 PCR gBCLS-3 was detected; Table 3). This indicated for S12 that this gBCLS/gBN combination might be
part of HCMV genomes which contain either the UL33-1
or the UL33-5 genotype. A comparison of the HCMV-C5
gB gene with those of published strains is shown in Figure
5.

Discussion
Since UL33 has been reported to be a spliced gene with
two exons [21], we inspected the UL33-5 ORF for the pres-

Here we present the application of a broad-spectrum technique for the universal detection and differentiation of

5 was detected after addition of two LNAs (LNA-HCMV-gB-2 and LNA-HCMV-gB-3)

variable genotypes of the gB and UL33 genes of HCMV.
All known HCMV gB and UL33 genotypes could be amplified with two sets (CMV-gBp1, CMV-UL33) of universal
primate CMV primers (Table 1). Most importantly, a
novel UL33 genotype (UL33-5) was discovered that differs
significantly from the known genotypes (Figure 3, 4).
UL33-5 could be identified in a total of 16 clinical HCMV
isolates, one of which was plaque-purified (HCMV-C5).
Both the isolate HCMV-C5 and the UL33-5-positive specimen S12 contained the same gBCLS/gBN combination.
While gBCLS was similar to that found in AD169, gBN was
not (Figure 5). An identical gBN sequence was detected
previously in an HCMV isolate of an AIDS patient [5],
however, the CLS sequence of that isolate was not analysed. The gBCLS/gBN found in HCMV-C5 (and the UL335-positive specimen S12) are reported here for the first

time. During the preparation of this manuscript, two
HCMV isolates were deposited in GenBank with almost
identical genotype sequences for UL33 and UL55
(GQ396662 and GQ221975, respectively). It is inferred
that the novel UL33 and gB sequences may be not rare.
The discovery of this novel HCMV variant indicates that
the primer sets are of a sufficiently broad detection range.
This is underscored by our recent discoveries of novel
CMV gB and UL33 sequences in chimpanzees and gorillas
where these primer sets were employed (CMV-gBp1: [18];
CMV-gBp2 and CMV-UL33: B. Ehlers, unpublished data).
We infer from these findings that the universal primers
would also detect unknown, even more aberrant HCMV
genotypes and variants.

Multiple alignment of HCMV UL33 genotypes
Multiple alignment of HCMV UL33 genotypes. Amino acid sequences were deduced from the complete, spliced HCMV
UL33-1 to UL33-5 ORFs. An alignment of the complete HCMV UL33 proteins was performed using the ClustalW module of
MacVector version 10.6.0. Identical and similar amino acids are boxed and the latter additionally inversed. Mismatches are
shown in lower case. The structural domains of the UL33 GPCR were determined as described in the Results section, and
depicted in white (transmembrane domains), green (extracellular domains and loops) and red (intracellular domains and loops).

The differentiation of HCMV genotypes from mixed infections was achieved by performing PCR in the presence of
LNA-oligonucleotides. Previously, LNA-supplemented
PCR was used for the discovery and differentiation of nonhuman primate herpesviruses in multi-infected samples
[20]. It was adapted here to differentiate HCMV genotypes, and proved to be equally effective. By this
approach, single samples revealed up to three genotypes.
The most important finding was the discovery of the novel
UL33-5 genotype with LNA-supplemented consensus PCR
in a clinical sample (S12) in which only the UL33-1 genotype was detected with consensus PCR alone (Tab. 3).

In principle, known HCMV genotypes can be amplified
with specific primers. However, with more than ten N-terminal and CLS genotypes already known, this could
become very laborious, making LNA-supplemented PCR
approaches with degenerate primers as those presented
here feasible alternatives. With this method, every genotype should be detectable, including unknown ones. In
addition, for genotypes preferentially present in mixed
infections or for the comprehensive analysis of sample
material from rare patients, the LNA-based differentiation
of genotypes from single samples is the method of choice.
Of note, the gBCLS-5 genotype has been detected in five
HIV-positive patients [4]. In accordance with this, we

Multiple alignment of HCMV gB/UL55 variants. An alignment of HCMV gB amino acid sequences was performed as
described in the legend to Figure 4. The alignment starts with Gly20 of the gB protein (the first 19 residues were not determined because their coding sequence is not part of the amplified gB fragment). The core region of the antigenic domain 2 [29]
and the CLS are marked in green and red, respectively.

detected gBCLS-5 in two HIV-positive patients (S1, S3;
Table 3). At the N-terminus, the gB sequence of S3 was
identical to gBN sequences which were retrieved from two
HIV-infected patients [5] (since these authors did not analyse the CLS, further comparisons could not be done).
These findings warrant further investigation on a possible
association of HCMV carrying the gBCLS-5 genotype with
HIV.
For a long time, gB has been in the focus as a suitable target antigen that might be utilized for vaccination and thus
prevention of maternal cytomegalovirus infection. In a
phase 2 placebo controlled, randomized and doubleblind trial, a gB-based vaccine was found to have a vaccination efficacy of 50% [27]. Although the key epitopes for
neutralizing antibodies are supposed to be conserved
between the presently known gB genotypes [28], the core
region of the antigenic determinant 2 [29] is not entirely
conserved (Figure 5). HCMV variants may exist that are
even more diverse and only insufficiently neutralized by
the antibodies elicited by the gB vaccine. The broad-spectrum PCR methodology presented here may prove useful
in detecting these variants.

spectrum. Only two groups of investigators used partially
degenerate primers [36,37]. Methods enabling the detection of multiple genotypes in a single sample were applied
in two studies where approximately 25% to 29% of the
samples were found to be multi-infected with HCMV
strains of different gB genotypes [8,38]. In accordance
with this, more than one HCMV gB genotype was detected
in 32% of the samples S1-S28 in the present study. Thus,
an improved technique for universally detecting and differentiating known and unknown genotypic HCMV variants in clinical specimens would enhance understanding
multiple HCMV infections, the reasons for their occurrence, and the pathogenicity they cause. In contrast to
detection systems used in earlier studies [1,8,36-39], the
methodology presented here is the first that meets this
requirement. It allows to comprehensively detect and differentiate cytomegaloviruses and might help to identify a
correlation between a given genotype or a certain mixture
of genotypes and disease.

Authors' contributions
Whether the GPCR protein encoded by UL33 has a natural
ligand or functions merely through constitutive, i.e., ligand-independent intracellular signalling is not known. All
published functional tests on HCMV UL33 were undertaken with the UL33 GPCR encoded by the laboratory
strain AD169 [30,31]. When the five UL33 amino acid
sequences were compared, intra-genotypic variation was
most pronounced in certain sections. These correspond to
the putative extracellular parts of the GPCR, whereas the
intracellular parts show very low variability (Figure 4).
Ligand interaction was attributed to the extracellular
domain and extracellular loops (primarily loops 2 and 3)
[32]. Since these domains revealed the highest variability
in UL33, it may be useful to additionally examine UL33
genotypes other than AD169. This might help to identify
a ligand for UL33.
Mixed infections with several herpesvirus genotypes are
frequent, and especially immunocompromised patients
are affected [8,13-19,33-35]]. In the latter situation, infections with multiple HCMV gBCLS genotypes correlate with
an increased rate of graft rejection, higher viral loads, and
frequency of infection with other herpesviruses
[33,34,36,37]. For therapeutic purposes, it is therefore
important to early identify genotypes that bear a higher
virulence potential. Relationships between certain HCMV
glycoprotein genotypes and organ manifestations or outcome of HCMV infections have been looked into. However, establishing correlations has frequently been
difficult because of limited testing sensitivity with the
majority of methods using a defined, narrow detection
