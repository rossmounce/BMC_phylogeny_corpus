Abstract
Background: Ever since the discovery of 'genes in pieces' and mRNA splicing in eukaryotes, origin and evolution of
spliceosomal introns have been considered within the conceptual framework of the 'introns early' versus 'introns late'
debate. The 'introns early' hypothesis, which is closely linked to the so-called exon theory of gene evolution, posits that
protein-coding genes were interrupted by numerous introns even at the earliest stages of life's evolution and that introns
played a major role in the origin of proteins by facilitating recombination of sequences coding for small protein/peptide
modules. Under this scenario, the absence of spliceosomal introns in prokaryotes is considered to be a result of "genome
streamlining". The 'introns late' hypothesis counters that spliceosomal introns emerged only in eukaryotes, and
moreover, have been inserted into protein-coding genes continuously throughout the evolution of eukaryotes. Beyond
the formal dilemma, the more substantial side of this debate has to do with possible roles of introns in the evolution of
eukaryotes.
Results: I argue that several lines of evidence now suggest a coherent solution to the introns-early versus introns-late
debate, and the emerging picture of intron evolution integrates aspects of both views although, formally, there seems to
be no support for the original version of introns-early. Firstly, there is growing evidence that spliceosomal introns
evolved from group II self-splicing introns which are present, usually, in small numbers, in many bacteria, and probably,
moved into the evolving eukaryotic genome from the α-proteobacterial progenitor of the mitochondria. Secondly, the
concept of a primordial pool of 'virus-like' genetic elements implies that self-splicing introns are among the most ancient
genetic entities. Thirdly, reconstructions of the ancestral state of eukaryotic genes suggest that the last common ancestor
of extant eukaryotes had an intron-rich genome. Thus, it appears that ancestors of spliceosomal introns, indeed, have
existed since the earliest stages of life's evolution, in a formal agreement with the introns-early scenario. However, there
is no evidence that these ancient introns ever became widespread before the emergence of eukaryotes, hence, the
central tenet of introns-early, the role of introns in early evolution of proteins, has no support. However, the
demonstration that numerous introns invaded eukaryotic genes at the outset of eukaryotic evolution and that
subsequent intron gain has been limited in many eukaryotic lineages implicates introns as an ancestral feature of
eukaryotic genomes and refutes radical versions of introns-late. Perhaps, most importantly, I argue that the intron
invasion triggered other pivotal events of eukaryogenesis, including the emergence of the spliceosome, the nucleus, the
linear chromosomes, the telomerase, and the ubiquitin signaling system. This concept of eukaryogenesis, in a sense,
revives some tenets of the exon hypothesis, by assigning to introns crucial roles in eukaryotic evolutionary innovation.
Conclusion: The scenario of the origin and evolution of introns that is best compatible with the results of comparative
genomics and theoretical considerations goes as follows: self-splicing introns since the earliest stages of life's evolution –

numerous spliceosomal introns invading genes of the emerging eukaryote during eukaryogenesis – subsequent lineagespecific loss and gain of introns. The intron invasion, probably, spawned by the mitochondrial endosymbiont, might have
critically contributed to the emergence of the principal features of the eukaryotic cell. This scenario combines aspects
of the introns-early and introns-late views.

Background
'Introns early' versus 'introns late'
The discovery, in 1977, of the discontinuous structure of
eukaryotic genes and the splicing mechanisms that put
pieces of genes (exons) together was, beyond doubt, not
only one of the most fundamental but also one of the
most unexpected and puzzling discoveries in the 20th century biology [1,2]. Almost immediately, the key question
'Why genes in pieces?' has been posed by Walter Gilbert
who introduced, all in the same seminal News & Views
article, the terms 'exons' and 'introns', and postulated
major evolutionary significance of split genes thanks to
the potential of exon shuffling and alternative splicing [3].
Subsequently, these ideas have been consolidated in the
'exon theory' of gene evolution [4]. Immediately, Ford
Doolittle offered a provocative retort: 'Were they ever
together?" where he speculated that the split state was
ancestral to genes despite the fact that introns are missing
in prokaryotes (or so it appeared at the time) [5]; similar
ideas have been developed almost simultaneously by
James Darnell[6].

Thus the 'introns early' hypothesis (hereinafter intronsearly) was born. This concept is obviously linked to the
'exon theory' of genes independently proposed by Gilbert
and Blake – the two ideas converge on the notion that
introns played a crucial role in the origin of proteins by
facilitating recombination of protein modules [7-9]. More
specifically, it has been postulated that the earliest genetic
elements encoded small domains, conceivably, of the size
close to the typical length of modern exons (~50 amino
acids) which recombined via non-coding sequences (to
become introns) present in some of these elements to
yield 'genes in pieces' encoding full-sized proteins [1012]. This attractive idea circumvents the need for the
unlikely 'invention' of long open reading frames and
seems to account for the characteristic domain organization of proteins. The central corollary of introns-early is
that subsequent evolution of genes involved, mostly, loss

of introns, partial in eukaryotes and complete in prokaryotes.
The absence of introns in prokaryotes which is, certainly,
a potentially embarrassing complication, if not the mortal
blow to introns-early, has been explained away by postulating the 'genome streamlining' mode of evolution for
prokaryotes [4,12,13]. Under the streamlining hypothesis, the main pressure in the evolution of prokaryotes had
been maximization of the replication rate, hence elimination of all non-essential parts of the genomes. The introns,
obviously, would not survive under this evolutionary
regime in the vast prokaryotic populations affected by
intense purifying selection.
The alternative to introns-early is the 'introns late' scenario (hereinafter introns-late) under which introns are a
eukaryotic innovation and, moreover, intron gain has
been a continuous process during evolution of eukaryotes
[14-18]. Introns-late is, more or less, a 'what you see is
what you get' concept according to which prokaryotes –
organisms that currently have no spliceosomal introns
and, of course, no spliceosomes – have never had them in
the first place.
In the years after the formulation of the original, 'strong'
introns-early hypothesis, the discovery of numerous lineage-specific introns persuaded Gilbert and coworkers to
modify their concept by incorporating aspects of intronslate [10,12,19]. The new version – introns-early in the age
of genomics – allows for relatively late (presumably, at
different stages of eukaryotic evolution) gain of a substantial fraction of introns but sticks to the central theme of
introns early which is, essentially, the exon theory: that
presence of many spliceosomal introns in protein-coding
genes is an ancestral feature of genetic systems. Therefore,
throughout the further discussion, I refer to this new,
'weaker' version as 'introns-early'.
Introns-early is a decidedly non-parsimonious scenario in
postulating that a genomic feature that is absent in two of
the three domains of life, bacteria and archaea, is nevertheless ancestral. Of course, parsimony is a statistical principle that does not necessarily apply to singular events in
life's evolution. However, for a non-parsimonious scenario to be viable, it must make clear, readily falsifiable

predictions. Introns-early (the exon theory) leads to at
least four such predictions although only the first two
have been extensively investigated by the proponents of
this hypothesis: i) if primordial genes evolved by recombination of exon-size coding segments, there should be a
substantial excess of phase '0' introns (inserted between
codons) over phase '1' and '2' introns (inserted within a
codon), ii) exon boundaries should correspond to
domain/module boundaries in proteins, iii) ancient paralogs that evolved as a result of gene duplications antedating the advent of eukaryotes should share at least some
intron positions, iv) there should be a difference in intron
density and properties between eukaryotic genes of different age, e.g., between ancestral genes inherited from
archaea and genes transferred from the mitochondrial
endosymbiont.
At face value, the first prediction seems to hold – there is,
indeed, a significant excess of phase 0 introns in all
sequenced eukaryotic genomes[13,20-23]. However,
more mundane explanations for this pattern, based on
selection acting on splice junctions and the concept of
protosplice sites (sites of preferential intron insertion),
have been proposed. In particular, the excess of phase 0
introns has been attributed to preferential fixation of
inserted introns in front of a synonymous position (3rd
base of a codon) allowing selection for splicing efficiency
[24]. Moreover, contrary to the prediction of the intronsearly hypothesis, the excess of phase 0 is somewhat greater
among 'new' introns that appear to have been inserted
into genes relatively late in eukaryotic evolution, as
opposed to 'old' introns that might comprise the primordial heritage under introns-early (see below)[23].
The second prediction, the correspondence between
exons and protein domains (modules), is the one that has
been tested most extensively, and the results have been
cited in support of introns-early[10,25-27]. However, the
distribution of exon lengths alone already indicates that
there can be no straightforward exon-domain correspondence. Indeed, the mean size of an exon in most species is
~50 codons whereas an average domain is about twice as
large. Attempts have been made to define structural modules in proteins in such a manner that they would correspond to exons [25,26] but, despite claims of success, the
consensus remains that there is no objective support for
such a correspondence [14,15,17,28-31]. There seems to
be a role for exon shuffling in the combinatorial evolution
of animal multidomain, extracellular proteins but this is,
obviously, a late, animal-specific development that cannot provide any support for introns-early [32-34].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

been formulated and tested, albeit on a limited data set, in
an elegant study of Cho and Doolittle [35]. The results
were clear-cut: no trace of intron position conservation,
hence no support for introns-early.
The test for intron density and phase distribution in genes
of different ages and origins has been proposed and performed, albeit in a crude manner, by Wolf et al[36]. In this
work, the genes in the nematode genome were partitioned
into those with closest bacterial homologs, hence, probably, of relatively late, conceivably, mitochondrial origin,
and those with closest archaeal homologs and more distant homologs in bacteria, i.e., probably, inherited from
LUCA. A comparison of intron density and properties
yielded almost paradoxical results: if anything, the
"young" genes had a slightly higher intron density and a
slightly greater content of phase 0 introns. A subsequent,
conceptually similar comparison of introns whose position is conserved in distant eukaryotic lineages (e.g.,
plants and animals) – old introns, and lineage-specific,
young introns in a carefully curated gene set produced
nearly identical results[23].
More recently, the two approaches have been combined
in a comparative analysis of intron positions in genes for
cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins [37].
These genes are ancient paralogs, inasmuch as the
cytosolic ribosomal protein genes derive from the
archaeal ancestors whereas those for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are of bacterial origin, but they also have
been inherited by eukaryotes via different routes, i.e.,
from the archaeal host and the mitochondrial endosymbiont, respectively. The two groups of genes have been
found to contain introns, largely, in different positions,
with the few coincident ones being well within the
expected number of parallel gains. Thus, introns seem to
have inserted independently into these ancient paralogs,
contrary to the introns-early prediction.
Taken together, these independent lines of evidence seem
to refute introns-early, even in its modified form, which
allows some late insertion of introns: there is no indication that the genes of LUCA contained numerous introns,
that prokaryotes underwent genome streamlining, or that
exon shuffling had any role in the emergence of the first
genes. However, the introns-early hypothesis incorporated too many good ideas to just go out with a whimper;
in the rest of this article, we shall see that things are not
quite easy for introns-late either and that the latest results
of comparative genomics converge with general, conceptual thinking to stage a partial, modest but tangible renaissance of "introns-early".

The prediction on conservation of intron positions in
ancient paralogs, those that predate the Last Universal
Common Ancestor (LUCA) of the modern life forms, has

Results and discussion
Reconstruction of evolution of eukaryotic genes: numerous
introns from the outset of eukaryotic evolution
Sequences of multiple, complete genomes of eukaryotes
from various lineages enabled reconstruction of ancestral
gene structures and of evolutionary trajectories that led to
the modern genes [38]. In essence, the sequences of a set
of orthologous genes are aligned, the positions of introns
are mapped, and the mapping is converted into a 0–1
matrix. This matrix can then be treated with any of a variety of available methods and models for intron gain and
loss to reconstruct the corresponding evolutionary scenario. Of course, any scenario thus constructed depends
on the topology of the underlying phylogenetic tree, and
this is far from being resolved in the case of eukaryotes.
The simplest approach is evolutionary parsimony which
deterministically assumes the scenario with the smallest
number of events (in this case, intron gain and loss) to
represent what most likely happened in evolution[23,39].
An important limitation of this approach is that it penalizes multiple losses of introns and, accordingly, is likely to
underestimate the number of ancestral introns, perhaps,
substantially, if loss of an intron in the same position in
different lineages is common. More sophisticated methods for reconstruction of evolutionary scenarios are,
mostly, different maximum likelihood (ML) and mixed
parsimony/ML models [40-43]. These models include
some finite likelihood that unique modern introns are
actually ancestral, due to losses in multiple lineages, and
so have the potential of obtaining more accurate estimates
of the number of ancestral introns. However, ML models
also have many parameters that are hard to define opti-

The quantitative differences notwithstanding, the parsimony and ML reconstructions yield qualitatively agreeing
results: the common ancestor of animals and plants had a
surprisingly intron-rich genome (Fig. 1). Depending on
the eukaryotic tree topology, this might mean that the Last
Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) also was quite
intron-rich – indeed, according to the unikont-bikont
phylogeny that has recently come into vogue, the last
common ancestor of animals and plants was the same as
LECA [44-46]. Even under more traditional eukaryotic
tree topologies, where some of the unicellular eukaryotes
are taken to be early-branching lineages. [47,48], the possibility that LECA was intron-rich looms large because
many unicellular forms easily could have lost most of the
introns. In certain cases, where the tree topology was
unambiguous, in particular, in yeast Saccharomyces and in
microsporidia, this eukaryotic genome streamlining is
undeniable[23].
Apart from the qualitative similarity of the conclusions,
the parsimony and ML approaches substantially differ in
the estimates of the relative extent of intron gain and loss
in eukaryotic evolution. The hybrid parsimony/ML model
of Roy and Gilbert yielded an extreme picture of eukaryotic gene evolution that is strongly dominated by intron
loss[40]. Essentially, the history of eukaryotic genes
according to Roy and Gilbert amounts to appearance of
(nearly) all introns in LECA, with (almost) all of the subsequent evolution limited to lineage-specific gene loss
[13]. In a sharp contrast, a different type of probabilistic

model, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, offers an extreme
introns-late scenario, with (nearly) no introns having survived from LECA [49]. The parsimony reconstruction as
well as more general and refined ML models [41-43], suggest a mixed scenario whereby at least some of the eukaryotic lineages, in particular, animals and plants, have
gained a substantial number of introns, actually, more
than the common ancestor of plants and animals is
inferred to have had (Fig. 1). On the weight of all evidence, and despite the great uncertainty that is associated
with the inference of intron density in the root of the tree
(LECA) under ML models, these mixed scenarios seem
more likely than those dominated by intron loss or intron
gain [38]. However, mechanisms of intron insertion
remain a mystery, and furthermore, it seems that intron
gain, if it, indeed, occurred repeatedly during eukaryotic
evolution, has been episodic and, perhaps, associated
with major evolutionary transitions, e.g., origin of animals, as opposed to the more uniform (even if lineagespecific) intron loss process[50,51]. Indeed, it appears certain that, for example, during the evolution of mammals
(~100 million years), and probably, during the evolution
of vertebrates (~600 million years), there has been virtually no intron gain [50,52]. Other eukaryotic lineages
might have a higher intron gain rate, though, as illustrated
by evidence of apparent recent gain in nematodes [53].
Regardless of the details of evolutionary reconstructions,
comparative genomics has compellingly shown that
numerous introns have resided in eukaryotic genomes
since very early in eukaryotic evolution if not from its very
outset. This conclusion, of course, does not redeem the
original introns-early idea which requires numerous
introns at the earliest stages of life's evolution not just at
the origin of eukaryotes. However, it does go a step in that
direction: at least, the radical introns-late position, i. e.,
the scenario of continuous intron insertion during
eukaryotic evolution, such that most, if not all, introns are
relatively new, is hardly defendable anymore. To gain further insight into the status of introns-early, we must now
turn to the ultimate origin of spliceosomal introns.
The apparent origin of spliceosomal introns and
eukaryotic retroelements from group II self-splicing introns
Although, when introns have been discovered, their origin
appeared completely mysterious, the discovery of selfsplicing introns offered a solution that appears increasingly plausible as the diversity of these elements is being
explored in its fascinating details [54,55]. The likely ancestors of spliceosomal introns are the group II self-splicing
introns whose terminal structures, which form the splicing ribozyme, show remarkable similarity to the structures
of the spliceosomal snRNAs and, especially, the complexes formed between snRNAs and the ends of spliceosomal introns [54-56]. It appears that, during the early

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

evolution of eukaryotes, group II introns fragmented into
the active, spliceosomal part, that acts in trans, and the
inert, intronic part.
The pattern of diversity of group II introns is compatible
with this scenario. Group II introns are found in ~25% of
the sequenced bacterial genomes, a few archaeal genomes,
and organellar genomes of fungi, plants, and protists
[54,55]. However, the structural features and behavior of
prokaryotic and organellar group II introns show telling
differences. In prokaryotes, most of the group II introns
contain intact open reading frames (ORFs), with the
reverse transcriptase (RT), maturase, and in many cases,
endonuclease domains, and behave much more like
mobile retroelements than like introns. With a few notable exceptions, they do not insert into biologically important, conserved genes and, most often, actually insert into
intergenic regions, hence, formally, losing the intron status. Prokaryotic groups II introns show signs of both
intragenomic and horizontal mobility, with the homing
mechanism involving reverse splicing and reverse transcription reactions.
The organellar group II introns are notably different. Most
of them reside in evolutionarily conserved, essential genes
and show various degrees of degeneration of the intronic
ORFs[55]. The RT and endonuclease domains, which are
involved in mobility, are typically disrupted whereas the
maturase domain survives in a greater fraction of the
introns. These are, indeed, typical introns, inasmuch as
their splicing is required for the expression of the respective genes. In some of the organellar introns, the ORF is
completely disrupted and splicing is facilitated in trans by
a maturase encoded in a different intron. The mobility of
these introns is limited although some might still occur
within the same organellar genome. Thus, the organellar
group II introns look conspicuously like functional and,
perhaps, evolutionary intermediates between prokaryotic
retroelements (as one should more properly call group II
introns found in bacteria and archaea) and the eukaryotic
spliceosomal introns. The major difference in the spread
and properties of the bacterial and organellar group II
introns is likely caused by the differences in effective population size which is several orders of magnitude greater
for bacteria than it is for organelles [57].
So what happened at the onset of eukaryotic evolution?
The scenarios of eukaryogenesis favored by different
researchers differ dramatically, and this is not the place to
review in any detail the pros and cons of each of these scenarios [58]. In any case, there is no doubt that the symbiosis between an α-proteobacterium, the ancestor of the
mitochondria, and a somewhat mysterious host, the
ancestor of the eukaryotic cytosol and nucleus, was a crucial early event in eukaryogenesis. A rather radical but, in

Page 5 of 23

Biology Direct 2006, 1:22

my opinion, also the most parsimonious and, all things
considered, the most realistic picture of eukaryogenesis is
a non-mysterious one, namely, that the host invaded by
the α-proteobacterium was a garden-variety archaeon (the
case for this scenario has been, in part, presented recently
[59] and will be discussed in full elsewhere). The α-proteobacterial endosymbiont must have brought with it a
certain number of group II retroelements, and these,
apparently, have gone berserk within the host cell [59].
The reasons for their sudden onslaught on the host
genome are not entirely clear. Perhaps, one of the most
important factors was, simply, the small effective population size of the "prekaryotic" chimera which precluded
rapid elimination of the inserted retroelements by purifying selection that holds them at bay in large bacterial populations[60,61]. It is conceivable, also, that the "naïve"
archaeal host lacked (still poorly understood) control
mechanisms operating in bacteria to limit the spread of
group II retroelements.
The spliceosomal introns that have changed to the extent
that their ancestry is not immediately obvious and, in particular, have lost all the activities of prokaryotic group II
introns/retroelements (i.e., the ability to catalyze their
own splicing and reverse splicing) comprise one major
line of descent spawned by the invaders in eukaryotic
genomes. The other line consists of all the numerous
eukaryotic retroelements that insert between genes or
within introns [62,63]. Some copies of these retroelements retain the RT which provides for their mobility and
survival.
Multiple, pivotal roles of ancient introns in eukaryogenesis
and redemption of the exon theory
The chimeric "prokaryote" could survive the attack of bacterial retroelements only if it evolved, in the very least: i)
a mechanism of compartmentalization that separated the
intron-containing transcripts from translating ribosomes
allowing the relatively slow splicing reactions to occur
before translation begins and thus precluding the formation of aberrant polypeptides, and ii) a reasonably efficient mechanism of splicing that acted in trans and hence
was capable of efficiently removing even those introns in
which the ORF was completely disrupted [59]. It is most
tempting to infer that these requirements were the principal driving forces behind the evolution of two of the principal eukaryotic innovations, the nucleus and the
spliceosome. Indeed, as recently detailed elsewhere [59],
the original function of the nuclear compartment might
have been isolation of pre-mRNA transcription and splicing from the cytosolic translation system such that
unspliced transcripts would not be translated to yield deleterious, aberrant polypeptides. The advent of the spliceosome is even more straightforward, with the terminal
segments of Group II introns recruited as snRNAs, the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

ribozyme part of the spliceosome, and the Sm protein,
which is involved in RNA processing in archaea[64,65],
becoming the spliceosome's protein core.
The origin of the nucleus and the spliceosome might not
have been the only innovations brought about by the retroelement onslaught. I propose here that several other
major eukaryotic novelties were triggered by the very same
"intron catastrophe" (Fig. 2). In particular, and in addition to the nucleus, the intron invasion conceivably precipitated the emergence of two additional lines of defense
against the accumulation of abnormal mRNAs and protein. The second, after the nuclear compartmentalization,
defense system is Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD)
which performs "quality control" at the level of transcripts. The NMD encompasses a suite of nucleases and
helicases that is conserved in all eukaryotes and eliminates aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination
codons [66-68]. In particular, the NMD system has been
shown to specifically destroy aberrantly spliced mRNAs
[68-71]. The core of the NMD is thought to have evolved
from a bacterial post-segregational cell-killing, toxin-antitoxin system which contains nuclease domains homologous to those employed in NMD [72]. Thus, it appears
likely that a toxin-antitoxin system from the mitochondrial endosymbiont was recruited for the mRNA surveillance function at an early stage of eukaryogenesis. This
would be particularly important because, at that stage, the
coupling between transcription, splicing, and nucleocytoplasmic transport would not yet have been perfected, and
leakage of (partially) unspliced transcripts into the cytosol
would have been a substantial problem.
The third and last line of defense that is invoked if an aberrant transcript escapes surveillance and is translated
appears to be the incredibly elaborate system of ubiquitinbased signaling which is one of the functional signatures
of eukaryotes and is responsible for most of the regulated
proteolysis and much of protein topogenesis in eukaryotic
cells [73-76]. Although prokaryotes do their fair share of
regulated protein degradation[77,78], they do not seem to
have a direct functional analog or precursor to the ubiquitin system. The prokaryotic homologs – and apparent evolutionary progenitors – of proteins that, in eukaryotes,
comprise the protein machinery of ubiquitin signaling,
are components of the pathways for biosynthesis of
molybdopterin and thyamin [79-82]. I propose that ubiquitin signaling originally evolved as a second line of
defense against the intron invasion that, at least at the
early stages of eukaryogenesis, would have led to an
increase in the formation of abnormal proteins from
translation of leaked unspliced pre-mRNAs, despite the
emergence of the nucleus as the primary protective device.
Hence the driving force for the evolution of a specialized
mechanism to target these aberrant proteins for degrada-

tion. Protein "quality control" might have been the original role of the ubiquitin system and remains one of its
crucial functions to this day [83-85], even as it evolved to
assume many other roles.
Compared to prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a greater
number of multidomain proteins that substantially contribute to the functional complexity of the eukaryotic cell
[86-88]. It seems likely that the early, mobile introns
could have contributed to the emergence of multidomain
protein structure via recombination between (nearly)
identical introns in different genes. Obviously, most of
such events would be strongly deleterious but some might
have created potentially useful domain combinations
without losing much important information, and thus
would be picked by selection. It remains to be investigated
in detail whether or not ancient eukaryotic multidomain

protein whose origin can be traced to the onset of eukaryogenesis tend to contain introns between the domains.
Should it turn out that introns indeed contributed to the
evolution of ancient, eukaryote-specific multidomain
proteins, this would seem to be a new, more realistic
incarnation of the exon theory of genes.
Another outcome of recombination between (nearly)
identical introns located in distant regions of the chromosome could be disintegration of the circular chromosome
of the archaeal host into multiple, linear chromosomes.
Replication of linear chromosomes presents a problem as
it leads to gradual loss of the terminal (telomeric) regions
[89-91]. The solution is evolution of replenishable telomeres, and it is remarkable that the key enzyme of telomeric
repeat propagation, the catalytic subunit of the telomerase, probably, evolved from the RT domain of group II

and provided the solution.

cycle of replication became widespread[96,97]. At this
stage, parasitic retroelements, the would-be group II
introns, would inevitably emerge.

In addition to all these innovations, the intron invasion,
obviously, created the potential for controlled alternative
splicing, a mechanism that came to prominence at a later
stage of eukaryotic evolution and made a crucial contribution to the evolution of complexity in multicellular organisms. In a sense, the (potential) contributions of introns
to eukaryogenesis that are outlined here recapitulate
aspects of the exon theory of gene evolution. Indeed,
although there seems to be no support for a role of introns
in the emergence of the original genes, their roles in
eukaryogenesis might have been multiple and crucial, in
line with the gist of the exon hypothesis – the evolutionary importance of the "junky" intron sequences.

This line of reasoning leads straight to a simple but rather
startling conclusion: introns that currently reside in
eukaryotic genes, after all, do derive, through an uninterrupted lineage of selfish elements, from primordial genetic
elements. Hence at least a formal vindication of another
aspect of introns-early: introns have evolved extremely
early, very likely, earlier than cells themselves.

Self-splicing introns as heritage of the primordial genetic
pool
As discussed above, eukaryotic spliceosomal introns as
well as core components of the spliceosome, most likely,
have evolved from group II self-splicing introns that
should be more appropriately characterized as prokaryotic mobile retroelements. There is every reason to believe
that they are at least as old as prokaryotes themselves if
not older. Of course, scenarios for the origins of the first
cells are widely open to debate. Nevertheless, at least some
of these scenarios – and, in my opinion, the more plausible ones – include some version of a primordial pool of
mixing and matching genetic elements[93,94]. A particular model that has been elaborated recently seizes on the
disparity between the membrane biogenesis and DNA
replication systems in bacteria and archaea to propose
that the primordial genetic pools, that might have thrived
in networks of inorganic compartments at hydrothermal
vents, were the form of life that prevailed on earth until
the separate escapes of the archaeal and bacterial cells
from these hatcheries[95]. This model involves selfish
genetic elements competing for resources and, originally,
selected solely for their ability to replicate efficiently, gradually evolving into "selfish cooperatives" that would
include multiple elements coding for mutually beneficial
functions (e.g., replication, translation, and nucleic acid
precursor synthesis). Wherever there is cooperation, there
will be parasites, and evolution of selfish cooperatives
would inevitably spawn various types of parasitic genetic
elements, the progenitors of modern selfish genetic elements and viruses[95,96].

Under this model, the primordial genetic pool is believed
to have evolved from a pure RNA world to a RNA-protein
system to the modern world of the Central Dogma (DNARNA-protein) through an intermediate stage, possibly,
corresponding to the LUCA, at which a retrovirus-like

Conclusion
Through a synthesis of comparative-genomic data and
bottom-up reconstructions of early stages of life's evolution, it is now possible to outline what I believe to be a
fairly complete and credible history of spliceosomal
introns (Fig. 3). According to this reconstruction, the evolutionary precursors of spliceosomal introns, the selfsplicing group II introns, started out as parasitic retroelements within the primordial genetic pool and have been
retained by the first bacterial (and, possibly, archaeal as
well) cells. Throughout the entire history of the prokaryotic world prior to the advent of the eukaryotes, these retroelements maintained their relatively uneventful selfish
existence, being kept in check by the strong purifying
selection in large prokaryotic populations and, possibly,
also by specific control mechanisms. The beginning of
eukaryogenesis was marked by a massive invasion of
group II introns escaping from the mitochondrial endosymbiont into the host, archaeal chromosome that
formed the basis of the emerging eukaryotic genome. This
intron invasion triggered the formation of the signature
features of the eukaryotic cell including the spliceosome,
the nucleus, the linear chromosomes with telomeres, and
the systems of nonsense-mediated decay and ubiquitin
signaling, either as devices for direct defense against
introns or as inevitable consequences of the invasion (Fig.
2). A substantial fraction of the introns retained their
ancestral positions in multiple, diverse eukaryotic species
although introns in some of the ancestral positions have
been lost whereas some new ones have been acquired.
However, the temporal characteristics of intron loss and
gain appear to be very different: whereas losses seem to
occur in a, more or less, clock-like regime, gains, apparently, have been episodic and, possibly, be associated
with transitional evolutionary epochs. This new understanding of the history of introns has a peculiar bearing on
the nearly 30-year old introns-early vs introns-late controversy. The central idea of introns-early (exon theory) on
the role of introns in the origin of first proteins does not
seem to receive any empirical support. Of course, recombination between RNA molecules could have been one of
the processes that contributed to the emergence of the
genes for first proteins from smaller, peptide-encoding

Reviewers' comments

On a more modest scale, though, the introns-early view
appears to hold true, at least formally: precursors of
introns, most likely, were inherited by modern life forms
from the primordial genetic pool. This is, however, only a
hollow vindication of introns-early. More importantly, it
appears that introns did play a major role in the evolution
of biological complexity albeit, apparently, not at the earliest stage of life's evolution, but rather at the outset of
eukaryogenesis. Thus, there seems to be no real losers in
the introns-early vs. introns-late debate as both views capture important aspects of the evolutionary reality.

Eugene Koonin's paper, like many speculative reviews in
evolutionary biology, presents two intertwined stories: an
evolutionary narrative about past events and forces that produced a particular aspect of the biological world, and a
history of science narrative about how we as a community
have come to hold our present beliefs about such events
and forces – beliefs Koonin now hopes to reformulate.
Koonin's evolutionary story, at least up to the part where
introns drive the evolution of the nuclear membrane, is
timely and, in my view, largely sensible. Most workers in
the field (Gilbert and his colleagues excepted) now

endorse the general view about introns Koonin articulates
here – that all spliceosomal introns descend from Group
II introns introduced into the nuclear genome of the last
common ancestor of all extant known eukaryotes, by the
prokaryotic ancestor of the mitochondrion.

that the eukaryotic nuclear genome is a complexified
descendant of a prokaryotic one. Parsimony would thus
have dictated that introns were introduced into onceintact prokaryotic genes at the time of this prokaryoteeukaryote transition.

Author response: Before addressing some of the specifics of this
review, I must note up front that it is a great honor and a very
special occasion to have this manuscript reviewed by one of the
originators (along with Jim Darnell) of much of our understanding of introns and their evolution, and the author of the
original terms. I try to interfere as little as possible with the historical part of this review, to let the reader enjoy the narrative.
To me at least, this is truly exciting reading.

That is to say, had "Why genes-in-pieces" addressed intron
origins within the then reigning phylogenetic paradigm, it
would have been most akin to introns late. But it didn't,
and origin issues arose first in attempts to explain how
and why (by what mechanism and in response to what
selective forces) mosaic gene organization first came into
being. After all, exon shuffling is only useful after many
introns have been introduced. And even then the benefit
is a long term one: evolution does not look ahead and the
short-term cost would have been prohibitive. So their
presence was an evolutionary mystery.

I think that from the history of science perspective,
Koonin has the early days of introns early about half right
(an excellent score, by the way, given the inherent difficulty of the task). Since I actually coined the terms introns
early and introns late (in a 1987 review not often cited
[American Naturalist 130: 915–928]), I would like to
claim some special knowledge as to how these theories
first arose and have evolved, and some special right to
judge what current data have to say about the truth of
them. No theory is exactly what it was when first formulated. Theories evolve, and are scarcely if ever confirmed
or refuted in their original forms. So part of the process of
science is negotiation over whether the current form is the
natural child of the original, and thus whether a theory's
originators can ever legitimately be said to have been right
or wrong. Such negotiations are not easy: it's [only] a wise
father that knows his own child.
Author response: Sadly, I was unaware of the American Naturalist review as well (not in PubMed). To keep the record
straight, I am not citing it in the body of the article – here is the
citation for the interested reader, in this review, from the author
himself.
So here's how I recall the theory's history. In his 1978
"Why genes-in-pieces" Wally Gilbert famously argued that
the mosaic structure of eukaryotic genes allowed them to
evolve by a subtler mode and faster tempo than could the
genes of prokaryotes, through what came to be called exon
shuffling. This was not yet his exon theory of genes, which
was named by him in 1987 and incorporated much of his
and others' subsequent thinking about the "RNA World"
into a general view about gene origins. Indeed, "Why
genes-in-pieces" did not address origins, or seek to explain
the presence of spliceosomal introns in (all) eukaryotic
nuclear genomes and their absence from (any) prokaryotic genomes. The prevailing notion at the time, however,
was that eukaryotes emerged from within prokaryotes,
through the coming together of several lineages (the Serial
Endosymbiosis Hypothesis of Margulis and Taylor) and

A way around this was to imagine that eukaryotes had not
emerged from within prokaryotes after all, and were
instead a parallel line of descent anciently diverged from
them at some inchoate stage of cellular and genomic evolution. Then we might with equal respect for parsimony
see introns as a primitive genomic feature, since lost from
prokaryotes (through "streamlining"), but retained in
eukaryotes, where they could indeed confer the evolutionary advantages mapped out in "Why genes-in-pieces". A few
of us had already been thinking along just those lines even
before the discovery of introns. Jim Darnell, in particular,
had already speculated that the bizarre and seemingly very
wasteful things that eukaryotes do with mRNA bespeak
retained primitivity. To him (and to me) the elegant efficiency of prokaryotic machinery for gene expression
seemed the more evolutionarily refined, with the loss of
introns being but part of this refinement. For me a crucial
additional component in making this "eukaryotes early"
notion seem reasonable was the articulation of the three
domain concept by George Fox and Carl Woese, and their
redrawing of the Tree of Life (which happened pretty
much simultaneously with the discovery of introns in
eukaryotic nuclear genes, in 1977). In the first versions of
this tree and until the late 1980s, the three domains
emerge independently from a primitive ancestral state
("the progenote").
So the absence of introns in prokaryotes was not as
Koonin asserts "a potentially embarrassing complication"
needing to be "explained away" but rather an important
element in the development of the theory! In the context
of the unrooted three-domain tree, introns early was no
more "a decidedly unparsimonious scenario" than was
introns late. Indeed, if introns played the role in gene
assembly first envisioned or later integrated into the RNA
World hypothesis by Darnell and me (PNAS 83: 1271–
1275) and by Gilbert in his "Exon Theory of Genes", their

presence in the progenote and before may even have been
a precondition for the rapid evolution of complex proteins. Really we know nothing about how genes arose, and
to suppose that they sprang full blown and full length
from noncoding polynucleotides seems to me more of a
stretch than to imagine that they were cobbled together
from smaller oligopeptide-encoding modules. Parsimony
is often in the eye of the beholder, and its relevance in
reconstructing evolution is in any case questionable.
Surely we do not require of real historians that a primary
criterion for constructing narratives about the human cultural or political past be that they invoke only the minimum possible number of historical forces and events! Yet
what are we biological evolutionists but historians of Life?
Author response: To get the history at least closer to the real picture, the introductory text was slightly modified to emphasize
that the full-blown exon theory is a later development than the
original introns-early. With regard to the more substantial
aspect of this comment, I must agree that we know (next to)
nothing about the emergence of proteins. Assembly from short
peptides is one of the possible routes and (autocatalytic) recombination between RNA molecules very well could have contributed to that. However, this is not the same as introns-early.
Inasmuch as there is no evidence of an evolutionary relationship between such putative non-coding sequences and modern
introns, this seems to be a different scenario. Origin of proteins
is, generally, outside the scope of this paper (it is relevant only
inasmuch as introns are implicated) but a clarifying comment
on this issue was added to the Conclusions.
On a more general note, the status of parsimony in reconstructions of the past and the comparison to the historians of the
human civilization ("real historians") seems to beg for some
comment. I believe the role of parsimony depends on the depth
of history one considers. Surely, it would be a little preposterous
to claim that, in February of 1917, Lenin's Bolshevik party
snatched the power in Russia directly from Nicholas II, on the
grounds that considering any intermediate between the two systems would violate parsimony. That is because we know for a
fact that, in February of 1917, the power was transferred to the
pluralist Interim Government, and it was only in October of
that year that the Bolsheviks took over, through an improbable
combination of events. And yet, what guiding principle do "real
historians" have when it comes to early stages of the history of
civilization, where the only evidence available is archaeological
(along, perhaps, with some comparative linguistics)? I believe
one has no choice other than to rely on parsimony or, put
another way, Occam razor. The same applies to the reconstructions of biological evolution, so I do not really agree that the role
of parsimony is questionable. It is, indeed, another and, I think,
more difficult matter that parsimony is "in the eye of the
beholder", i. e., we often effectively apply weighted parsimony,
with the weight of different characters determined either on

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

pure intuition or with some rationale. Herein seem to lie many
problems in deep reconstructions, and much caution is needed.
What tipped the balance against introns early – for me anyway – was nevertheless a powerful parsimony argument,
based on a revision of the phylogenetic consensus. By the
late 1980s, we had come generally to believe in a rooted
three-domain tree, with archaea and eukaryotes sisters,
and bacteria more deeply diverging. So now we introns
early advocates would have to imagine two independent
episodes of intron loss through streamlining (one in the
line leading to Bacteria and the other on the line to
Archaea) rather than the arguably more parsimonious single gain early in eukaryote evolution imagined for introns
late. More importantly, by then we'd come to believe that
the (seemingly) most deeply diverging eukaryote lineages
(Giardia, Trichomonas and the microsporidia) lacked both
mitochondria and introns. Independent loss episodes
would have to be imagined for each of these several
eukaryotic lineages in order to hold on to introns early.
John Logsdon and Jeff Palmer were the first to make us (or
me anyway) aware of the serious unparsimoniuosness of
this scenario. And if, as then seemed likely, eukaryotes
with mitochondria had introns and those which had
never acquired such organelles didn't, why not suppose
that the latter were introduced along with the former, as
Tom Cavalier-Smith did, in 1991. Introns late acquired a
vector for the introduction of introns, and a specific scenario for their origins as genetic entities, from Group II
introns in bacteria.
But, since the turn of the millennium, the balance of phylogenetic arguments for or against introns early has shifted
again, returning to the neutral position! All eukaryotes
likely have introns and likely all have, or once had, mitochondria. So Koonin argues that the door is open again
for something like introns early. However, it does matter
what we take that term to mean. Rather early on in the
introns early – introns late debate, it became clear to most
protagonists that the notion that all introns are primoridial relics, with a history exclusively of loss, would not
wash. Lining up all the positions at which introns are
known in at least one of all the available orthologs of a
given gene forces the conclusion that ancestral exons were
far shorter than needed to code for any credible protein
structural module. For me, the "weaker" or "revised" version of introns early, the one under dispute for most of the
two decades before the turn of the millennium, and in my
judgement the only legitimate child of the 1978 version of
the theory, was this: the first genes were assembled from
smaller protein-coding modules, introns marked the positions at which such modules were joined, and at least
some introns (or intron positions) in some modern
eukaryotic nuclear genes are direct relics of that assembly
process. So even if LECA's genes were chockablock full of

Biology Direct 2006, 1:22

Group II introns or their degenerate spliceosome-dependent products, as long as we see these introns as having
been "introduced into" the nuclear genome (producing
the explosive infectious spread Koonin calls the "intron
catastrophe"), we're dealing with an introns late scenario.
But do we absolutely have to see it that way? We believe
that eukaryotes and archaea are sisters because we believe
that the genes that produce this sisterhood relationship,
which are mostly those of translation and other components of the information processing machinery, tell the
true story of eukaryote origins. And we see the nonarchaeal genes in eukaryotic genomes as having been
"introduced into" the eukaryotic cellular lineage because
we still see the pre-mitochondrial (bacterial) cellular lineage, from which many of these genes likely derive, as having been introduced (as an "endosymbiont") into some
post-archaeal host cellular lineage. Or most of us see it
that way, anyway.
But eukaryotic origin scenarios in which the complexity of
eukaryotic cells and their ability to engulf other cells arise
only after the tight integration of the bacterial and archael
parental lineages are increasingly popular (see Embley
and Martin, 2006, Nature 440: 623–630). In these scenarios, designation of one lineage as host and the other as
symbiont (and the notion that one set of genes was "introduced into" the other), seems pretty arbitrary. Indeed, if
we chose to go with the majority of genes and accept the
analyses of Esser at al. (2004, Mol. Biol. Evol. 21: 1643–
1660) that suggest that the majority of yeast nuclear genes
are of bacterial ancestry, then surely we must seriously
entertain their ironic conclusion that "yeast shares a sistergroup relationship with eubacteria, not with archaebacteria".
The bacterial lineage and many its genes presumably came
already modestly freighted with introns, albeit Group II
introns. There is no reason to assume that all spliceosomal
introns that now dot the eukaryotic nuclear genomic
landscape landed there as the result of de novo events of
transposition of such Group II introns. Put another way,
there is no reason not to assume that some of the Group
II introns in genes that are part of the bacterial heritage
were simply converted, in situ, without moving so much as
a nucleotide to left or right, into the pitiful degenerates we
now call spliceosomal introns. Such a scenario is, mirabile
dictu, perilously close to introns early in what Koonin calls
"its modified form" but considers untenable, favoring "a
massive invasion of Group II introns escaping from the
mitochondrial endosymbiont into the host".
But this scenario is indeed not the same as introns early,
unless we in addition suppose that some individual bacterial Group II introns that have survived as spliceosomal

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

derivatives in eukaryotic nuclear genes were themselves
relics of primitive stages of gene assembly. This may seem
unlikely, given that in bacteria Group II introns appear to
avoid the interior regions of protein coding genes. But
who knows? Maybe bacterial genomes were once riddled
with relict introns, some indeed primordial leftovers.
Maybe these were removed one at a time as translation got
increasingly fast and waiting for splicing increasingly a
burden, and remain mostly where interference with translation is not a big issue. The imposition of the nuclear
membrane, far from being a defense against invading
introns, might have allowed the relatively few such parasites that were part of the bacterial heritage to run amuck.
So it would not be that the nuclear compartmentalization
arose as a barrier to the "attack of bacterial retroelements"
but rather that it arose for some other reason, and permitted the subsequent proliferation of introns.
None of us can present his or her evolutionary hypotheses
without embedding them in a story of the relevant thinking that has gone before, else we would be plagiarists (or
so off-the-wall that our ideas bear no debt whatever to the
past). But each of us has a different take on that past, and
each of us recounts it so as to make his/her own contribution seem to be the product of inexorable logic – not just
for rhetorical purpose but because this is how we come to
understand it, ourselves. Koonin's arguments about the
biology are interwoven with his recounting of the history
of thought in the area, in service of his goal to determine
whether a 38 year old theory is still worthy of consideration because it most parsimoniously explains the present
data. Whether or not the introns early theory is judged to
be parsimonious (and thus more or less believable)
depends on what one takes to be the relative likelihoods
of the inferred genetic processes (streamlining versus massive intron infestation) and the accepted phylogenetic
framework (the Tree of Life) against which its parsimoniousness should be evaluated. The former is unknowable
and the latter has varied radically over the life of the theory, and still varies radically between individual theorists
in the field.
Koonin's evolutionary narrative, as I understand it, is this:
• Genes were probably first assembled from pieces, as
envisioned in the early versions of introns early and later
elaborated in the "exon theory of genes".
• Group II introns, as a class of transposable selfish elements, may well date from this time of gene assembly.
They continue to infest bacterial genomes, albeit at modest level, and the (endosymbiotic) bacterial genome that
became the mitochondrial genome was so infested.

Page 12 of 23
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:22

• The host ("archaeal") genomic lineage was (for some
reason) devoid of such elements, which were introduced
into it by transposition from this (endosymbiotic) bacterial genome. The defenseless host genome became the
scene of a transpositional orgy.
• Compartmentalization of the nuclear genome and several other aspects of eukaryotic cell biology arose as
defenses against this "intron catastrophe".
Author response: This is an important point, and clarification
is due. The first statement among these four is not an integral
part of my narrative. I think that the issue of the origin of first
proteins is wide open (see above) and recombination between
RNA molecules is one of the likely contributed mechanisms
(again, see the revised Conclusion). However, this is not where
I see the link to – and partial vindication of – introns-early.
This connection, mostly, stems from points (ii) – the evolutionary antiquity of the (precursors of) introns and (iV) – the crucial role of introns in eukaryogenesis.
He claims that this scenario "combines aspects of introns
early and introns late views" which it does, and that there
may be "no losers in the introns early vs. introns late debate
as both views capture important aspects of the evolutionary reality." I'm not sure, however, that "aspects" are
enough to legitimize Koonin's version of introns early as
the natural child of the 1978 theory. In my opinion that
theory, even in its weak form, requires that "at least some
introns (or intron positions) in some modern eukaryotic
nuclear genes are direct relics" of primordial gene assembly process. (By 'direct relic' I mean occupying the original
position in the genes and descendant through replication.) That so many introns have been added since, from
whatever source and by whatever mechanism, may mean
that the signal is too small to be detected and the theory
thus formulated is unfalsifiable. This doesn't mean that it
is false, or even useless, although it may no longer be a scientific theory. There are many interesting ideas out there
about how life itself first arose. Few of them (only the
chemically impossible) are falsifiable, but one or more of
them may have elements of truth, and we do know that
life did, somehow, arise. And thinking about such theories stimulates the collection of much data and the generation of many new ideas, as have introns early and introns
late, in their 38-year struggle for the hearts and minds of
molecular evolutionists.
Author response: Parts of the manuscript, including the title (as
per Bill Martin's suggestion), have been modified to de-emphasize the claim that the debate ended in a "draw". I really do not
insist that the current view of the evolutionary history of introns
articulated in the present paper is a true, legitimate child of the
original introns-early. I only would like to maintain that there
is a connection, i.e., some heritage of that view factors in the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

currently emerging picture. If the latter is a true child of
introns-late, but just a nephew of introns-early, that's fine with
me.
Reviewer's report 2

Rockefeller University, New York 10021, USA (nominated by
W. Ford Doolittle)

I think speculation on the origin of eukaryotic cells that
does not go back to the pre-cellular phase of evolution
unlikely to unlock any secrets and at worst to be vacuous.
Therefore I warm to Koonin's last section, "Self-splicing
introns as heritage of the primordial gene pool." To quote
from Carl Woese, "Next comes the evolution of the
eukaryotic cell itself. While biologists have traditionally
seen this as a step (saltation) beyond the stage of bacterial
cells, I do not." ["A new biology for a new century", Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. vol. 68, 173 (2004).] He then goes on
to develop the vast difference in cell structure and organization (and inferentially structural proteins). His objection to eukaryotic cell development AFTER non-nucleated
cell development might be thought to dissolve with the
discovery of proteins in bacteria that have the same threedimensional structure as tubulin and actin [Lowe et al.
(2004) Molecules of the Bacterial Cytoskeleton. Annu.
Rev. Biophys. Biomolec. Struct. 33, 177; Amos et al.
(2004) Structural/functional homology between the bacterial and eukaryotic cytoskeletons. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol.
16, 24]. However that does not undercut the more general
argument for pushing eukaryotic origins back to a very
early stage of cell evolution. What all this suggests to me
is that essentially all of the protein folds existed by the
time sustainable 'life' as we know it arose. If this is the
case, then the platform from which eukaryotes arose
could be the same as that from which the other two kingdoms arose. And then the question is what the pools
looked like from which the extant genomes were constructed. What strikes me now (and always has) is the
unlikelihood of already highly developed, single, nonnucleated cells whose aim in life is to grow and divide
being the entities from which eukaryotes derived. It seems
much more plausible to me to back up and admit that precellular 'life' had passed the Rubicon of coded protein
(peptide) synthesis and probably elementary nucleic acid
duplication (even DNA synthesis). In this gemisch the
quite different polymer synthesis machines, archaeal and
bacterial, must also BOTH have existed before functioning
cells. And if this pre-cellular stage provided the platform
from which the two (and only two?) non-nucleated cell
types arose, multiplied and remained distinct (ignoring
LGT), it is from this same pre-cellular but elaborate stage
that I 3believe2 (too strong and irrelevant a word) that
eukaryotes arose carrying with them somehow the ability
to get along with fragmented nucleic acid (or at the very

least self-splicing intron introduction and removal capacity), an ability with which the whole pre-cellular pool
must have been endowed and which has been maintained
in all multi-cellular eukaryotes and by inference the one
(or more?) single-celled precursors to multi-cellular
eukaryotes. Surely small bits of information predated
large chunks of information and somehow tacking
together sufficiently large pieces of information to make
usable peptides was an early (? primary) task (See for
example the idea of an amoeba-like ancestral protozoan;
maybe we should use progenote, the two decade old
word.) that 'could serve as a genetic melting pot.' (Ogata
et al. 2006. PLoS Genetics 2, e76, May 12). Lacking more
insight into this stage leaves me unwilling to swallow a
primitive self-sustaining eukaryote devoid of a mechanism for recruiting useful information from disjointed
stretches that then swallowed and used non-nucleated
cells as plastids and gene donors. The latter swallowing
surely occurred but by whom? I realize that this position
is not particularly helpful since it generates few (? no)
experiments/measurements/observations, but to discuss
eukaryotic origins as obligatorily arising from either bacteria or archaea or both seems to me wrong-headed.
Eugene Koonin's paper is reasonable, written well and
highly informative on many up-to-date details. But its diagrammatic simplicity embracing the 'later' dependent origin of eukaryotes doesn't convince me that a reasonable
proposal is a right proposal.
Author response: I appreciate the thoughtful comments from
one of the founding fathers of our current understanding of
eukaryogenesis. I think there are, actually, many points of
agreement with respect to the evolution of many complex features of life, including the two distinct DNA replication
machineries (archaeal and bacterial) within a precellular
genetic pool (see our paper with Bill Martin on this subject, ref.
95). What we seem to disagree on is the early (from within the
same pool) vs late (via archaeal-bacterial fusion) origin of
(pro)eukaryotes. For sure, a reasonable proposal is not necessarily a right proposal. But should we not try to stick to a reasonable proposal and explore its implications until it is shown to be
false?

This is an interesting and informative paper, although I
don't think that the current title is very good. Introns early
and introns late are irreconciliable views, they can't both
be right so it is not really a draw. And if they are both
wrong it is not a draw either. The paper is basically an
essay on "some aspects of eukaryotic introns and their
possible evolutionary significance" and a title along those
lines might better advertise its content. That title would
paraphrase one of Ford Doolittle's more famous titles
(54th Symp. Soc. Gen. Microbiol. Pp. 1–21, 1996), which
was intentionally identical to Stanier's famous 1970 SGM
title (Symp. Soc. Gen. Microbiol. 20, 1–38). Too bad that
there is not a 2006 SGM symposium volume, this would
have fit nicely.
Author response: This point is appreciated and well taken. So
much so that the title of the paper has been modified along the
lines suggested. The new title actually seems to give better justice to some of the more substantial (as opposed to historical)
aspects of the present paper. For the reader's understanding: the
original title was 'Introns-early versus introns-late: is it a
draw?' I agree that this is not a "real" draw, and if we formulate the debate as an 'either/or' question, we have to accept that
introns-late has won. However, the version of introns-late that
is currently taking shape has very strong reverberations with
introns-early, hence the original title. The same thought is
expressed in the revised title in a more cautious manner. Several changes to the wording in the Abstract also have been
made, to go along with the new title. Having changed the title,
we could decide to dispense with all this discussion but I think
it might be of certain interest to the reader and worth keeping
in the published record.
As its main thrust (from my viewpoint), the text extends
and further develops the idea in ref. 59 that introns may
have precipitated the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus (as
a consequence of the origin of mitochondria) and NMD
by the compatible notion that introns might have precipitated ubiquitinylation as well. This suggests that several
otherwise puzzling eukaryotic novelties can be better
understood (under these premises) as defense responses in
the broad sense against invading mobile elements (group
II introns, from the mitochondrion in the simplest interpretation). Ideas that aid our understanding need not
require that the ideas are correct (how can we prove anything about early evolution anyway?). But if they help us
to structure the problem (and the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition needs considerable restructuring with the
demise of archezoa) by linking phenomena that appear
otherwise unrelated in a temporal and mechanistic manner that is tangible, then that constitutes progress. This
paper fills that bill.
Author response: I appreciate this comment and, by and large,
agree. This is what I was trying to do, basically, to advance,

Page 14 of 23

Biology Direct 2006, 1:22

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

even if just a little bit, our understanding of the wondrous series
of events associated with eukaryogenesis. A full-scale philosophical discussion certainly is out of place here but it is tempting to
throw in a brief comment. I agree that it is impossible to "prove"
anything about early evolution but, then, this applies to most
general statements about the physical world, even those that
have nothing to do with remote past. Typically, such statements
are accepted as "correct" inasmuch as they i) are compatible
with a large body of diverse empirical data and ii) explain
diverse aspects of the world in an economical and plausible
manner (of course, this is a rehash of the well-known Popperian
paradigm, I have no aspiration to be original here). With
regard to early evolution, it is, most of the time, particularly
hard to properly satisfy criterion (i) although we certainly must
keep trying. Accordingly, criterion (ii) is becoming particularly
important.

Author response: I tend to agree that the difference between
'introns first' and the good, old 'introns early' is minor, so to
avoid confusion, I do not really discuss 'introns first' as a separate concept. As for evidence of gain, even apart from the Coghlan-Wolfe observations on the recent gains in nematodes, I
believe reconstructions provide enough evidence in support of
intron gain, at least at some stages of eukaryotic evolution.
Granted, this is not the same as a "smoking gun", which would
be a pair of highly similar introns in unrelated genes indicating
a recent gain (like the Coghlan-Wolfe results, only more definitive). However, if intron gain was, indeed, episodic in eukaryotic in eukaryotes as suggested in this paper and previously
elsewhere (ref. 50), such unequivocal cases of gain are likely to
be very few and far between, and this seems to be so. Complete
analysis of this issue, obviously, is beyond the scope of the
present paper. Very hopefully, elsewhere.

At the same time, the paper looks further back in evolution towards the origin of genes and aims to reconcile
aspects of introns-early with aspects of introns-late. The
important evidence for intron stasis in animals indicates
that one aspect of introns late in some of its original formulation is wrong: introns are apparently not continuously mobile over time. There was a time when they were
actively mobile, but that time has apparently past. I still
find it interesting that, as far as I know, nobody has ever
observed the same intron in two places in genomes, that
is, recent spliceosomal intron transposition does not seem
to occur at an observable rate. Introns late was saying that
it should be ongoing today. One point for introns late, but
probably for the wrong reason. One could probably calculate the maximum rate at which introns with significant
sequence similarity move, that would be interesting.

The history aspects of the introns early vs late debate are
more easily dealt with accurately by someone who was in
the thick of it. I'm not convinced that the whole introns
debate is needed to understand the novel aspects of this
paper, getting to the point more quickly might keep readers on track more effectively. Introns early vs introns late
is over and I would not recommend warming back up.
The present title as a subtitle of a more informative title
might get the early introns players back into the arena
again, though, which would be interesting. But this paper
is suggesting that they would need to be debating other
ideas, which is unlikely to occur.

Author response: Generally, true: unlike intron loss that is,
more or less, clock-like, intron gain does not at all seem to occur
uniformly in time, which is bad news for a strong version of
introns-late. This being said, there are indications of recent
intron gain in some lineages, and the reference to Coghlan and
Wolfe (Ref. 53) on intron gain in nematodes was added in support of this point.
If one accepts the view of an RNA world, then recombination is splicing, so the idea that splicing was around very
early fits well. The idea that spliceosomal introns are in
situ holdovers from that phase of gene invention (the
exon theory of genes) is part of the eukaryotes early (or
thermoreduction) idea still today, but beyond the New
Zealand and French sections, I don't know that very many
folks are card-carrying members in that club anymore.
Ref. 98 distinguishes introns first from the exon theory,
that could be debated because except for snoRNAs they
are saying the same thing. Ref 98 has "intron gain" in the
title, suggesting that there is some evidence for recent
intron gain, I wonder what that evidence is, in detail.

Author response: Maybe it would be easier and faster to cut to
the chase right away and only discuss the current ideas on the
role of introns in eukaryotic evolution without reheating the old
debate...but I thought revisiting it was interesting. Ford Doolittle's review comes from the very thick of it and corrects my historical aberrations where necessary.
Background, 2nd paragraph: the exon theory of genes came
much later
Author response: Technically, yes, but the main ideas were
there, I think. In any case, modified to reflect history more
accurately.
Results and Discussion, section "Multiple, pivotal roles of
ancient introns in eukaryogenesis...". 4th paragraph: exon
theory of genes, but one that operates in eukaryotes only.
Author response: Yes, this is the gist of it, more or less, as noted
in the text.

The replies to all comments, in particular the comments
of referees 1, 2, and 4, add quite a lot to this interesting
paper that was missing in the first version. This document
now contains the best and most accurate summary of
whence introns early that there is, but as a published referee report, that's something new for the literature. I wonder how to cite it.
What is the consensus of what has been said here? I think
it goes like this: Because RNA recombination was probably involved in the origin of genes, and because splicing is
RNA recombination, introns were probably involved in
the primordial assembly of genes. But (NB: none of) the
introns of eukaryotes were present at any of their current
positions as those first genes arose, because spliceosomal
introns are a secondary invention of the eukaryotic lineage via degeneration of group II introns that were
acquired via the mitochondrion. This is not what either
introns early or introns late was saying, as far as I can
recall. But that debate structured the problem in a way
that gave us concepts to sort the current observations from
genomes into a reasonable temporal sequence of imaginable events. So I still think that the compromise offered by
the title is not delivered. The present view is not introns
early or the exon theory of genes, it is more the intron theory of nuclear origins. Any way one cuts the cake, introns
still seem to carry burgeoning evolutionary significance;
that comes closer to what introns early was saying than to
what introns late was saying.
The view expressed here that the host for the origin of
mitochondria was a garden variety archaebacterium (lacking introns, lacking a nucleus, lacking cytoskeleton, lacking phagocytosis) is a significant part of the present
synthesis. This is what some of us have been saying for
quite a while, the idea can be found in Ford Doolittle's
1996 SGM paper and in papers by Jim Lake (Proc Natl
Acad Sci USA 95:6239–6244, 1998; Nature 431:152–155,
2004), Dennis Searcy (In The Origin and Evolution of the
Cell. Hartman, H. and Matsuno, K. eds. World Scientific,
Singapore. pp 47–78), and others (Nature 392:37–41,
1998; BioEssays 21:99–104, 1996). The significance of this
concept is substantial because it implies that there was no
lineage of eukaryotic-type gene or cell organization that
goes all the way back to the origin of life (an assumption
implicit in most formulations of introns early). The view
of an archaebacterial host suggests that eukaryotes arose
directly from fully-fledged and free-living prokaryotes,
not directly from the same collection of organic molecules
that gave rise to prokaryotes. It is thus mutually exclusive
with regard to the progenote concept, which is closely
related to introns early, but is compatible with some (but
by no means all) symbiogenic views of eukaryogenesis.
An historian of science specialized in the area of endosymbiosis, Jan Sapp, has gotten this aspect of the modern his-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

tory of endosymbiosis and early cell evolution wrong on
several occasions, so it was nice to see it spelled out more
clearly by the authors and referees of this contribution. In
1981, Woese published an interesting paper in the June
issue of Scientific American (p 98ff) that put his progenote
view of eukaryote origins against Margulis's view of
eukaryote origins head-to-head in figures. The progenote
view was the view held by introns early, I suppose, or
introns early might have even been an edifice of the progenote concept, who knows. Twenty five years later, neither
the Woese camp nor the Margulis camp has indicated any
willingness to find the kind compromise that Koonin has
suggested here, as inspection of their more recent papers
will attest. Maybe refugees from those two camps can
someday find a popular solution – not a compromise! –
that squares off well with the observations from genomes.
Reviewer's report 4

(a modified version of this review is to be published as a
separate Commentary in Biology Direct)
This article comes in two parts; the first provides a thorough and up-to-the-minute review of the existing literature on the introns-early/late debate, is easy to follow and
refreshingly even-handed for a field where one is too often
subjected to vehemently partisan advocacy. This part of
Koonin's article is well written and, while there's always
something to disagree with in this field, I have no particular axe to grind. The second half of the article offers some
new material, extending ideas Koonin developed with
Martin (Martin & Koonin 2006 Nature 440:41).
Author response: Again, before addressing some of the specifics,
I want to emphasize that I greatly appreciate this careful,
detailed, and constructive review. If my responses are (relatively) brief and I do not address all the points, just those I felt
were the most important ones, the reason is my wish to avoid
the specter of infinite regression that, indeed, plagues some philosophy journals.
There is plenty in the second part of the paper to take issue
with. In an attempt to avoid the phenomenon in philosophy journals where nit-picky rebuttals sometimes run
longer than the original argument, I will confine myself to
two main ones. The first is that, to buy any of this, one has
to accept two main assumptions, both of which one can
take issue with. If these do not hold, the entire argument
comes crashing down. The second is that I do not think a
good argument can be made that introns proliferated in
the host that Koonin invokes in his model.

So, what are the assumptions we must accept? The first is
that group II introns are related to the spliceosomal
snRNAs and spliceosomal introns, and that the evolution
of the these from group II introns is established, as per the
mitochondrial seed hypothesis (Logsdon 1998 Curr Opin
Genet Dev 8:637). The assumption of common ancestry is
not really debated, since both introns-early and intronslate proponents accept this as given, albeit in different
forms. In the former case, it has been argued that group II
introns are relics of the RNA world (Gilbert & de Souza
1999 In: Gesteland et al The RNA World) and interrupted
RNA genes, and that excision of the group II intron was
required for production of functional RNAs. Group II
introns would thus be early parasites, and, contrary to the
historical situation Koonin alludes to where introns-early
and the exon theory of genes were one and the same, this
is not so in the revised introns-early scenario. However, in
this scenario a satisfactory explanation for how group II
introns could have evolved into a trans-splicing system
comprising 5 snRNAs is not given, though, aside from an
issue of timing, the problem is one and the same as for
introns-late: the origin of the spliceosome.
Mechanistically, support for introns-late rests on the
observation that group II introns-in-pieces are found
(admittedly in a chloroplast genome – that of
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), and this three-piece self-splicing intron does at least provide a plausible intermediate in
an organelle of bacterial endosymbiotic origin (see Stoltzfus 1999 J Mol Evol 49:169 for a model). The importance
of this observation in the context of the mitochondrial
seed hypothesis cannot be denied; other RNA genes in
pieces are found in mitochondria (e.g. tmRNA – Keiler et
al 2000 PNAS 97:7778), even if no split group II introns
have thus far been found in this type of organelle.
The evidence for a common origin for snRNAs and group
II introns is, by necessity, circumstantial; a common origin is invoked on the basis of the chemistry of reaction,
which is in itself a weak argument (see Weiner 1993 Cell
72:161 for a critique). More significant is the demonstration that U5 snRNA can substitute for the ID3 domain of
a group II intron (Hetzer et al 1997 Nature 386:417).
Another piece of evidence comes from recent structural
comparisons of the D5 domain of a group II intron and
U6 snRNA (Sashital et al 2004 Nat Struct Mol Biol
11:1237; Seetharaman et al 2006 RNA 12:235), though
finding similarities between two hairpins, while suggestive, is unfortunately not strong evidence for a common
origin.
Overall, Koonin is being fair to the literature in so far as
these similarities have all been used to argue for a group II
intron origin for the spliceosome, and, as noted above,
group II introns-in-pieces might well be expected to

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

emerge in the mitochondrion. There is no question in my
mind that, compared to models offered by the intronsearly camp, the mitochondrial seed hypothesis is the better-developed hypothesis. It can potentially explain the
stepwise emergence of a trans-splicing system comprised
of several RNAs from a single cis-splicing element (though
the large complement of proteins is more difficult – see
Collins & Penny 2005 Mol Biol Evol 22:1053), whereas the
exon theory of genes was never a good explanation for the
origin of introns. It was quickly realised that this suffered
from evolutionary foresight; introns would have had to
have evolved in order to promote shuffling of domains,
thereby producing new protein variants that would, possibly, be useful at some future point (Blake 1978 Nature
273:267; Doolittle 1978 Nature 272:581). That the exon
theory failed to explain the origins of introns does not
however mean that introns must by implication be late
however (Gilbert & de Souza op. cit.; Poole et al 1999
Bioessays 21:880).
Indeed, it is unfair to argue, as Koonin does, that suggesting spliceosomal introns as a feature of the Last Universal
Common Ancestor is indefensible because there are no
introns in archaea and bacteria. As Koonin points out,
group II introns are found in both bacteria and archaea,
and, if, as widely supposed, spliceosomal introns &
snRNAs and group II introns are descended from a common ancestor, the prediction that genome streamlining in
archaea and bacteria eliminated spliceosomal introns can
be reconciled with the presence of group II introns in
these groups. Under streamlining, group II introns represent the intronic survivors of a period of reductive evolution. There is no direct evidence to support the contention
that the ultimate ancestor was a group II intron, rather it
is an assumption invoked as fact by many introns-late
proponents, and repeated here by Koonin.
Author response: If I understand the idea correctly, it is suggested that there was a stage of evolution of the hypothetical
ancestral eukaryotes when Group II introns interrupted many
genes. There is nothing inherently impossible about that. Moreover, there is a clear parallel with our (with Bill Martin) scenario under which such a stage was a transient one triggered by
endosymbiosis. I believe, though, that the latter version has distinct advantages in terms of compatibility with the available
data and explanatory power. Firstly, organisms with numerous
Group II introns in protein-coding genes (to be concrete, with a
density comparable to the density of spliceosomal introns in
eukaryotes) are not known (some organelles come the closest
but still fall short of comparable density), so it is, at least, less
of a stretch to postulate that condition as a transient one. Secondly, I believe there is a very good reason why such an organism has never been discovered: it never existed because having
those multiple (even if self-splicing) introns under the transcriptional-translational coupling mode of expression would be

Page 17 of 23

Biology Direct 2006, 1:22

too much of a disadvantage. If so, one would think that such an
organism would already have transcription and translation
uncoupled. Again, we are unaware of such organisms – other
than eukaryotes, of course. I think the hypothesis that we proposed with Bill Martin (ref. 59) and that I expand somewhat
in the present paper offers a plausible chain of causation to tie
it all together.
Debate over the timing of the evolution of introns, and
the relative contributions of intron gain and loss, is still
raging, and, on balance, Koonin is perfectly entitled to
assume the mitochondrial seed hypothesis as a starting
point for discussions on the origin of spliceosomal
introns, even if not everyone would agree. It is the second
assumption with which I take issue.
The second assumption, again, is a case of assuming we
know the ancestral state, and in this case concerns the
nature of the endosymbiosis that gave rise to the eukaryote cell. This is the more difficult assumption to defend,
and also that which is most important with regard to the
novel ideas outlined in this paper.
Koonin's assumption is that the host of the endosymbiont
that evolved into the mitochondrion is, as he puts it, a
'garden variety archaeon'. This is a commonly held
assumption, but fails on closer inspection. I will not
develop a full argument here, as I have recently submitted
an article elsewhere on this (Poole & Penny, submitted),
but here are two important issues. First, if archaea had
already become a distinct domain prior to the origin of
eukaryotes, eukaryote nuclear genes of archaeal origin
should group specifically within the diversity of modern
archaea, in exactly the same way as genes of mitochondrial origin fall within the diversity of modern bacteria,
showing a specific relationship to alpha-proteobacteria.
We see this clearly for mitochondrial-origin genes, but
this has not been shown to be the case for supposedly
archaeal-origin genes. That many archaeal genes are similar to eukaryotic genes supports a common origin for the
two domains, but does not demonstrate that eukaryotes
evolved from archaea. For this to be supported requires an
explicit phylogenetic affinity between eukaryote genes
and orthologous genes from a specific group of archaea,
for instance methanogens.
Author response: I maintain that the notion of an archaeal host
for the mitochondrial endosymbiont remains the null hypothesis
that we cannot reject. The argument that the 'archaeal' genes
of eukaryotes should cluster within a specific branch of archaea
is straightforward and substantial at first glance but fails upon
closer consideration. Firstly, even with the mitochondria, the αproteobacterial origin is demonstrable by phylogenetic trees for
a frustratingly small number of genes [see Esser at al. (2004,
Mol. Biol. Evol. 21: 1643–1660)]. It is, mostly, because some

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

of these genes remained in the mitochondrial genome that we
have no doubts as to the origin of the mitochondria. The genes
that moved to the nucleus, in all likelihood, have experienced a
substantial acceleration of evolution which complicates phylogenetic analysis. The same acceleration, probably, affected the
host, archaeal proteins, hampering assignment to a specific
group of archaea. On top of that, just as is the case with the
mitochondria, we do not know the actual gene set of either the
host of the endosymbiont, and given the amount of HGT in
prokaryotes, this is far from being a moot issue. Some of the
'archaeal' proteins of eukaryotes do show phylogenetic affinity
with a specific archaeal lineage, it is just that the signals are
somewhat conflicting. Furthermore, the host did not even have
to belong to one of the presently characterized groups of
archaea. It very well could have been an archaeal branch that
was outside the tree we are aware of and has either gone extinct
or is still lurking somewhere (our understanding of archaeal
diversity is very incomplete, indeed, more so than the understanding of bacterial diversity). It still would be an archaeon
even if the word 'garden-variety' might be risky in such a case.
In summary, the nature of the relationship between eukaryotes
and archaea deserves further, careful investigation but at
present I cannot see how we can reject the straightforward
hypothesis of an archaeal host for the mitochondrial endosymbiont.
The second criticism is that there are no known cases
modern archaea housing bacterial endosymbionts. All
endosymbioses that have generated organelles (chloroplast, secondary and tertiary endosymbioses) subsequent
to the mitochondrion clearly involve eukaryotes
(Archibald 2005 IUBMB Life 57:539), and modern examples of endosymbioses involving eukaryotes are widespread. While there is one example of a bacterium within
a bacterium within a eukaryote (von Dohlen et al 2001
Nature 412:433) this is not equivalent to a bacterialarchaeal endosymbiosis. Consequently, the entire thesis
rests on the unproven ability for archaea to be capable of
hosting endosymbionts.
Author response: Yes, there is no direct evidence of bacterialarchaeal endosymbiosis. Neither is there any evidence of multiple instances of eukaryogenesis. I quite understand that this
might make one feel uncomfortable but I think it is hard to
doubt that here we are dealing with a rare event, apparently,
an event that led to substantial evolutionary consequences just
once in life's history. I think that the very grandiosity of the
transformation of cellular organization that accompanied
eukaryogenesis suggests that it could not be anything other than
a near-unique occasion (more about that below with regard to
Methanosarcina). This is not unlike the ultimate origin of cells:
an enormously complex evolutionary transition for which we
may not have a convincing scenario but we would not question
the origin of cells from "some" kind of precellular (pre)life form
because...what would be the alternative?

Biology Direct 2006, 1:22

With this point in mind, I turn now to the speculative part
of Koonin's paper, in which he argues that group II
introns entered an archaeon via the alpha-proteobacterial
endosymbiont. The consequence is an explosion in
intron-numbers, compensatory evolution of a number of
mechanisms of transcript quality control (the nucleus,
Martin & Koonin op. cit.), nonsense-mediated decay
(NMD), ubiquitinylation), and side-effects such as the
evolution of linear chromosomes with telomeres and telomerase. The major point that needs to be discussed here
is the expansion of group II introns, but before I come to
that, I will deal with several minor points.
Koonin cites a paper wherein it was suggested that eukaryotic NMD evolved from a bacterial toxin-antitoxin system
(Anantharaman & Aravind 2003 Genome Biol 4:R81), and
extends this speculation by suggesting a mitochondrial
origin for this toxin-antitoxin system. The original paper
demonstrates similarity in so far as a universal domain,
the PIN-domain, is found in both proteins involved in
NMD. However, Koonin's hypothesis is phylogenetically
testable – NMD genes which are homologous to bacterial
genes should group with alpha-proteobacterial examples
of these genes in gene trees. One can envisage complications, in that toxin-antitoxin systems are horizontally
transferable, but without phylogenetic analysis the position Koonin takes cannot develop past the speculative
stage. Again with ubiquitin, similarity to bacterial counterparts alone cannot establish the direction of evolution
– more specific tests must be made if these suggestive links
are to form the basis for hypotheses for the origin of key
eukaryotic processes from bacterial or archaeal 'progenitors'. I am open to these possibilities, but feel it is insufficient to determine the direction of evolution based on
similarity; this smacks of the Great Chain of Being, and we
should be able to do better. One might equally argue that
any such similarities are due to reductive evolution in bacteria and archaea (as I pointed out for group II introns
above), but without more specific tests, the two opposing
hypotheses are at loggerheads. We may not always be able
to resolve the precise evolutionary history, but we can at
least formulate alternative hypotheses and attempt formal
tests.
Author response: I am, of course, all for formal tests which are,
however, beyond the scope of the present paper. I should add
that such tests are quite hard in these cases, given the high level
of divergence, in part, probably, due to accelerated evolution in
eukaryotes. For small domains, like PINs and ubiquitin, this
could be prohibitively difficult.
Koonin's main argument however is that he can identify a
selection pressure for the emergence of these mechanisms
of quality control. Crucial to his hypothesis is the claim
that group II introns, upon arrival in the archaeal host

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

have, 'apparently, gone berserk within the host cell' (see
also Martin & Koonin op. cit.). This is a key point, and one
that the reader must accept in order to buy into any of the
ensuing speculation. The argument builds upon the assertion that the small effective population size of this new
'prekaryotic chimera' precluded elimination of invading
group II mobile elements by purifying selection. The host
in this case is an archaeon (and thus asexual) with a small
population size, but I am not sure we have any good
examples to compare the model to.
Group II introns have recently been found in the archaea
Methanosarcina acetovorans &M. mazei (Dai & Zimmerly
2003 RNA 9:14; Rest & Mindell 2003 Mol Biol Evol
20:1134), and seem to have become established as the
result of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria (a recent
transfer represents the ideal analogue to the 'primitive
prekaryote' host genome). Here it seems that none of the
group II introns are inserted in archaeal open-reading
frames, and have a tendency to insert into the reverse transcriptase genes encoded by other group II introns, generating nested introns. I have no idea as to the effective
population size of these two archaea, but that these elements have neither gone berserk, nor inserted into
archaeal protein-coding genes does not serve to
strengthen the model presented by Koonin.
Author response: The case of Methanosarcina is, indeed, quite
interesting. Surely, their genomes are full of acquired bacterial
genes, and there are some Group II introns as well but all this
has not made them eukaryotes. On the one hand, that does not
strengthen the model I discuss in this paper...but, I do not think
this weakens it either. What this case does confirm, is that
eukaryogenesis is no small feat (see above) – in a way, one
might be tempted to think of Methanosarcina as a failed
eukaryote although we have no idea whether or not some sort of
transient endosymbiosis was involved.
Examples of asexual lineages with small population size,
such as Buchnera are more clearly analogous to the endosymbiont, not the host, and here it seems that explosive
expansion of existing selfish elements is not a feature of
these lineages; the opposite is true. Population size could
well play a role, and is in principle testable, but to my
knowledge the only examples of massive expansion of
selfish elements are in organisms with meiotic sex. Here it
has been argued that selfish elements expand at the
expense of the host because outcrossing permits spread,
provided that the cost to the host is less than 0.5 (Hickey
1982 Genetics 101:519). Species with smaller effective
population sizes do seem to have a higher density of elements (e.g. complex multicellular organisms), but these
are all sexual. Conversely, in asexual systems, the theoretical expectation is that selfish elements should be rapidly
eliminated, because they impart a selective disadvantage

on the host, meaning that element-free lineages will outcompete those with elements (Hickey op. cit.; Johnson &
Brookfield 2002 J Evolution Biol 15:42).
Under Koonin's scenario, mitochondrial group II introns
inserted into the host genome sweep to fixation in the
population via drift, and subsequently expand in numbers. It is of course not impossible for drift to sweep a selfish element to fixation, even under Hickey's model.
However, should these then expand significantly in
number over a longer evolutionary period? One key point
that emerges from Hickey's original treatment of this
problem is that there should be attenuation of selfish element activity because in an asexually reproducing lineage
the reduction in fitness imparted on the host by a given
element is also the fitness reduction on the element. There
is therefore selection on the element to become less virulent. This is exactly the opposite of what Koonin's model
(and indeed Martin and Koonin's model) requires.
It has recently been argued that element overload is one
probable cause of extinction of obligately asexual lineages
that have evolved from sexual lineages (Arkhipova &
Meselson 2005 Bioessays 27:76). So, in my mind, for
Koonin's 'berserk introns' theory to work over a long
enough time scale for several complex systems of quality
control to emerge, I would argue that he should at least
have invoked the emergence of facultative meiotic sex.
The problem with this is that sex, with its two-fold reproductive cost, must be invoked under a scenario where
there is a population of primed selfish elements 'waiting'
to spread. While the level of sexuality can be increased in
a facultatively sexual population, this is not so for an asexual population (Johnson & Brookfield op. cit.). As the
ever-present difficulty with models for the origin of sex is
accounting for the short-term selective advantage for sex,
this would represent a rather backwards way of approaching the problem!
A further point worth considering is that Koonin's
archaeon model weakens the introns-late stance because
it eliminates the possibility of the mitochondrion entering an early eukaryote stem lineage that had already
evolved meiosis (see Ramesh et al 2005 Curr Biol 15:185)
for recent discussion on the timing of the evolution of
meiosis). One has to accept the necessity of stem-lineage
eukaryote ancestors irrespective of the absence of extant
primitively amitochondriate eukaryotes. (By stem lineage
I do not mean extant eukaryotes that were designated
archezoa. I mean lineages of eukaryotes that have gone
extinct and which diverged from the lineage leading to the
Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor – see Donoghue 2005
Paleobiology 31:553 for standard definitions of stem and
crown groups) This is because, even if, as Koonin argues,
the ancestors of eukaryotes were archaea bearing alpha-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/22

proteobacterial endosymbionts, there are no intermediate
stages between this hypothetical ancestor and modern
eukaryotes (Poole & Penny, submitted). By invoking a
sexual, eukaryotic host, the spread of introns in eukaryotes can better be accounted for under our current understanding of selfish element spread in sexual populations.
Author response: I appreciate these thoughtful comments.
Admittedly, the connection between sex and propagation of selfish elements during eukaryogenesis has not been explored in
sufficient detail. The "necessity of stem-lineage eukaryote
ancestors", though, is very, very hard to accept, and if we do,
we will also have to accept that we have no clue whatsoever as
to how, under what sort of selective pressure they would evolve
the complex features of the eukaryotic cell. Obviously, I believe
that our model with Bill Martin (Ref. 59), which I extend a little here, goes some way to propose a plausible chain of causation
for eukaryogenesis (see Fig. 2in the present paper) without
invoking mysterious, extinct creatures. This does not mean such
creatures have never existed, just that, following Occam razor,
we probably should try to explain eukaryogenesis as best we can
without their help.
In summary, I am not convinced that the host in the endosymbiosis leading to modern eukaryotes was an archaeon.
This should be detectable phylogenetically, picking out a
specific group of archaea as the closest relatives of eukaryotes in exactly the same way as this is possible for the
mitochondrion. Second, no archaea have been identified
which carry endosymbiont bacteria, so accepting
Koonin's assumption would require that all extant
archaea have subsequently lost this capacity. Nor am I
convinced that the transfer of group II introns into an
archaeal host from its bacterial endosymbiont would have
led to massive expansion of group II elements. This does
not seem to fit with our current knowledge of selfish element spread under an asexual reproductive mode. That
modern methanogenic archaea of the genus Methanosarcina have not suffered from massive intron expansion,
seems to confirm this suspicion.
