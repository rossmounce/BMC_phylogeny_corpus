Abstract
Background: Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) is a member of the Solanaceae family. In spite of its
widespread cultivation and nutritional and economic importance, its genome has not as yet been
extensively investigated. Few analyses have been carried out to determine the genetic diversity of
eggplant at the DNA level, and linkage relationships have not been well characterised. As for the
other Solanaceae crop species (potato, tomato and pepper), the level of intra-specific
polymorphism appears to be rather limited, and so it is important that an effort is made to develop
more informative DNA markers to make progress in understanding the genetics of eggplant and to
advance its breeding. The aim of the present work was to develop a set of functional microsatellite
(SSR) markers, via an in silico analysis of publicly available DNA sequence.
Results: From >3,300 genic DNA sequences, 50 SSR-containing candidates suitable for primer
design were recovered. Of these, 39 were functional, and were then applied to a panel of 44
accessions, of which 38 were cultivated eggplant varieties, and six were from related Solanum
species. The usefulness of the SSR assays for diversity analysis and taxonomic discrimination was
demonstrated by constructing a phylogeny based on SSR polymorphisms, and by the demonstration
that most were also functional when tested with template from tomato, pepper and potato. As a
results of BLASTN analyses, several eggplant SSRs were found to have homologous counterparts
in the phylogenetically related species, which carry microsatellite motifs in the same position.
Conclusion: The set of eggplant EST-SSR markers was informative for phylogenetic analysis and
genetic mapping. Since EST-SSRs lie within expressed sequence, they have the potential to serve as
perfect markers for genes determining variation in phenotype. Their high level of transferability to
other Solanaceae species can be used to provide anchoring points for the integration of genetic
maps across species.

Background
The eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), also known as
aubergine or brinjal, belongs to the Solanaceae, but unlike
most of the solanaceous crop species, it is endemic to the
Old, not the New World. Its progenitor is presumed to
have been the African species S. incanum [1], but its centre
of domestication and genetic diversity lies in the IndoBurma region, where it has been grown for at least 1,500
years [2]. Despite its economic and nutritional importance, its genome has been little studied, in contrast to
those of the other cultivated solanaceous crops tomato,
potato and pepper, in which high density genetic linkage
maps have been established [3-6]. The literature contains
only a few reports describing RAPD [7], AFLP [8,9] and
SSR [10,11] genotyping, a genetic map constructed with
AFLP and RAPD markers [12] and a comparative genetic
map, based on tomato sequences [13].
Microsatellites (SSRs) are short tandem repeats of simple
(1–6 nt) motifs, and their value for genetic analysis lies in
their multi-allelism, codominant inheritance, relative
abundance, genome coverage and suitability for highthroughput PCR-based platforms [14]. It was long
assumed that SSRs were primarily associated with noncoding DNA, but it has now become clear that they are
also abundant in the single and low-copy fraction of the
genome [15,16]. These latter SSRs are commonly referred
to as "genic SSRs" or "EST-SSRs" and are present in 1 to
5% of the expressed plant DNA sequence deposited in
public databases. With the increasing volume of publicly
available unigene and cDNA sequences emerging from
large-scale EST sequencing projects, the conventional
need to generate enriched genomic libraries and to perform the necessary sequencing can now be largely
bypassed [17]. Genic SSRs tend to be more readily transferable between (related) species or genera than genomic
ones, since coding sequence is better conserved than noncoding sequence; however, they do tend to be less informative than conventional SSRs, particularly in the context of
related genotypes [18,19]. On the other hand, they provide a powerful means to link the genetic maps of related
species, and since many of them are located within genes
of known or at least putative function, any allelic variation
present can be exploited to generate perfect markers [20].
We present here our progress in the development and preliminary characterization of a set of eggplant SSR markers,
derived from public database sequence, along with an
evaluation of their experimental and in silico transferability among other solanaceous species.

Results and discussion
SSR motif frequency and distribution
At the time surveyed, the Solanaceae Genomics Network
database (SGN; http://www.sgn.cornell.edu) contained

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/357

3,181 eggplant ESTs, ordered into 1,841 unigenes (617
contigs and 1,224 singlets). An additional 176 sequences
were retrieved from the EMBL sequence database http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/embl. The non-redundant sequence pool
contained 1,864 sequences representing 743,527 bp of
genomic sequence. Within these, 64 contained one or
more SSR (70 in total, including 20 mono-, 11 di-, 36 tri, one tetra- and two hexanucleotide motifs). One
sequence contained three SSRs, while ten SSRs were of the
compound type (SSR containing stretches of two or more
different repeats). The mean separation between two SSRs
was ~10.6 kb, equivalent to one SSR per 29 sequences.
This distance is somewhat greater than that estimated for
several monocotyledenous [15,21] and dicotyledenous
[22] species, perhaps because of the greater stringency of
the criteria and the lesser size of the sequence dataset.
The properties of the 70 SSR loci identified are summarised in Table 1, classified on the basis of repeat motif and
the number of repeat units. Trinucleotides were the most
frequent (51.4%), followed by mono- (28.6%) and dinucleotides (15.7%). Tetra- and hexanucleotides were rare.
Although trinucleotide motifs are less frequent in
genomic libraries, they represent the most common class
in expressed sequence [18,23,24], since variation in repeat
number does not normally affect downstream peptide
sequence, unlike mono-, di-, or tetra-nucleotide motifs,
which generate frameshift mutations and therefore are
more likely to be selected against [25]. All ten possible trinucleotide motifs were recovered, with AAG/CTT the
most frequent (30.6%), as has been seen in other
Solanaceae species [26,27] and more generally within
plant sequence databases [16,28]. CCG/CGG and AGG/
CCT are the most common monocotyledonous EST-SSR
motifs [18,24,29] and were under-represented in dicotyledonous species as well as in the present dataset. Kantety et
al. [30] have observed that AG/CT predominates among
the dinucleotide motifs, presumably reflecting the high
frequency of Ala (AGA) and Leu (GAG) (respectively, 8%
and 10%) in polypeptides [31]. These motifs represented
45.5% of the eggplant dinucleotide SSRs. The second
most abundant motif (36.4%) was AT/AT, which is also
well represented among plant EST sequences [32,33].
Most of the mononucleotide repeats (19/20) were A/T.
The total length of the 64 microsatellite containing
sequence reached the 31,909 bp. Of this 16,862 bp represented untranslated (UTR) – and 15.047 bp represented
protein-coding regions. SSRs were non-randomly distributed among coding regions and UTRs. All of the mononucleotide and majority of the dinucleotide repeats (91%)
were associated with UTRs. Mononucleotide repeats were
evenly distributed among 5' and 3' UTRs while dimeric
ones preferentially associated with 5'UTRs. Triplet repeats
were significantly over-represented in coding region

(75%) and among non-coding regions showed more than
3 folds greater frequency in 5'UTRs. Such dominance of
trimeric over other SSRs in coding regions can be
explained by non-perturbation of the reading frame.
SSR assays and their informativeness
Of the 64 sequences containing one or more SSR, 50
(78%) were amenable to primer design. The markers targeted by EEMS01 to EEMS50 comprised 15 mono-, five
di-, 24 tri- and two hexanucleotide simple repeats,
together with two di- and two trinucleotide compound
loci. The remaining sequences contained either too little
flanking sequence, or the sequences themselves were
refractory for primer design. Thus, primers amplifying
non-redundant loci were designed from about 1.4% of
the initial number of database sequences, a success rate
comparable to that experienced in other species
[23,26,27]. Amplicons were generated from genomic
DNA template from 39 (78.0%) of the 50 loci. Failure to
amplify can be due to a variety of causes, including the
positioning of primers across a splicing site, or to a chimeric origin of the cDNA clones. In all, 31 (79.5%) of the
39 assays were informative across the whole genotype
panel (Table 2), but only 11 (28.2%) were informative
among the sample of cultivated eggplant. The majority of

-

70

the trinucleotide-containing SSRs were informative
between species, but few generated any polymorphism
among the cultivated set, while the dinucleotide SSRs
identified both inter- and intra-specific polymorphism.
Similar results have been reported for eggplant by
Nunome et al. [10,11] who described that 57% of trinucleotide SSRs were informative at inter-, but only 14% at
intraspecific level, while, for the dinucleotide SSRs, the
respective frequencies were 78% and 70%. The repeat
type, primer sequence and PIC (polymorphism information content) of the successful markers are given in Table
3.
Generally, amplicon size was in agreement with expectation, although EEMS 26, 31, 39 and 41 all amplified a
product at least 100 bp larger than expected, presumably
because the amplicon included an intron. EEMS12 produced an amplicon of smaller than expected length, perhaps because of the presence of a deletion within the
genomic sequence, poor priming specificity amplifying a
non-target member of a gene family, or because of minor
sequence variation between the amplified copy and the
consensus sequence [34]. A total of 116 alleles was amplified from the full genotype panel, with the number of alleles per locus varying between 1 and 9 (mean 3.1) (Table

3). The greatest variation in amplicon size (180–236 bp)
was shown by EEMS28. Both the PIC among the 38 cultivated types (PICm) and among the full 44 genotype set
(PICs) were calculated. PICm ranged from 0.05 to 0.68
(mean 0.38 ± 0.12), while PICs varied from 0.04 to 0.76
(mean 0.24 ± 0.09). The highest and lowest PICm were
produced by, respectively, EEMS49 and EEMS20, while
EEMS15 had the highest, and EEMS24, 25, 31 and 36
shared the lowest PICs. The correlation coefficient

between PICm and SSR length was 0.6 (p = 0.0001), in
agreement with the general trend for long SSRs to be more
informative than shorter ones [35]. Trinucleotide motif
SSRs were less informative than the dinucleotide types
(PICs of 0.16 and 0.26 respectively). The former are typically associated with a low level of variability [18,36]. The
overall level of intraspecific polymorphism uncovered
(28.2%) is typical [37-39], and compares poorly with the
rate achievable by genomic SSR assays [37,40,41].

Table 3: Allelic variation in 39 SSR loci. (Continued)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:357

Genetic diversity revealed by SSR markers
Thiel et al [24] have stressed the limitations surrounding
the application of SSR markers for diversity studies,
emphasising the possibility of homoplasy (identical allele
sizes may not be identical by descent), and have pointed
out that allele size differences can also be generated by
indel events, as well as by variation in the SSR repeat
number. However, the genetic relationships between the
accessions of the full genotype panel as displayed by
genetic similarity at the SSR level were in good agreement
with prior taxonomic classification based on both
genomic [9,11] and plastidial markers [42,43]. Thus the
cultivated eggplants clustered with an average genetic similarity of 82% (Figure 1). Three pairs of cultivars ('Tina'
and 'Dourga'; 'Sita 07' and 'Violetta di Firenze'; 'Mostruosa di New York' and '305 E40') and 'Mirabelle', 'DR2'
and 'Lunga violetta napoletana' were identical to one
another. The cluster closest to the cultivated group contained both S. viarum and S. sodomaeum, with a mean
genetic differentiation of ~50% from the cultivated germplasm. The S. torvum accession was more distant (mean
genetic similarity 39%). The third cluster contained the
remaining species S. sisymbrifolium, aethiopicum and
integrifolium which shared a mean genetic similarity of
56%.

The EEMS primers were also applied to amplify template
from potato, tomato and pepper, which all belong to the
Solanaceae. To minimise non-specific amplification, the
same stringency level for PCR was applied as with eggplant template. About 54% (21 of the primer pairs) generated a detectable amplicon from at least one of the three
species; ten of 21 amplified all three templates, seven
amplified potato and tomato but not pepper DNA, two
tomato and pepper but not potato, and one each amplified only from potato and tomato.
The principal co-ordinate analysis (PCO) analysis illustrates the genetic relationships between the members of
the genotype panel (Figure 2). The first three principal coordinates accounted for ~54% of the overall genetic variation, with each in turn contributing 34.2%, 10.3% and
9.4%. The first co-ordinate distinguished the cultivated
forms from the allied genotypes, while the second
allowed the separation of each related eggplant genotypes.
BLAST analyses
Of the 39 functional SSR markers, all but EEMS45 were
developed from anonymous eggplant unigene sequences,
25 of which share significant homology to Arabidopsis
thaliana proteins of unknown function. EEMS45 lies
within a chloroplast phosphate transporter gene (Table
4). Using the source eggplant sequences as a BLASTN
query (the target database has been described in the
'Method' section), 24 (61.5%) of the markers identified

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/357

highly conserved orthologs, with a frequency negatively
correlated with phylogenetic distance from eggplant [44].
EEMS15, EEMS21, EEMS24, EEMS39, and EEMS45 had
homologous counterparts with known function.
Sequences containing homologous microsatellite motifs
in conserved positions were found in 15 potato, 10
tomato and 1 pepper orthologs (Table 4). Contrasting
results are reported in literature on the transferability of
microsatellite markers across members of the Solanaceae
[26,45,46]. The high level of transferability between the
seven Solanum spp. mirrors the experience in other groups
of plants [47]; furthermore we detect a low level of
intraspecific polymorphism which seems to confirm the
conclusion that EST-SSRs are highly conserved across species [48].

Conclusion
In eggplant, as in pepper and tomato [3,49,50], the level
of intraspecific DNA marker polymorphism is rather limited. Nunome et al [11] constructed a genetic map in eggplant based on RAPD and AFLP markers, but only 8.3% of
the RAPD primers were informative, and even the AFLP
primer combinations were only able to deliver a mean of
2.4 polymorphisms each. We have shown that an in silico
analysis of the albeit limited quantity of publicly available
eggplant DNA sequence has enabled the development of
a set of functional SSR markers. Because these sequences
are derived from the expressed portion of the genome,
they are relevant for assaying functional diversity in populations or germplasm collections. Most of the EEMS SSRs
are readily transferable to related species, and so can be
exploited as anchor markers for comparative mapping
and evolutionary studies.

Methods
Mining of SSR-containing sequences and primer design
In all, 3,357 eggplant sequences were retrieved from the
SGN and EMBL nucleotide databases, using the Sequence
Retrieval System (SRS6, http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/). A standalone nucleotide database was built for local BLAST2
searches [51]. PolyA and polyT tracts were removed, by
applying the criterion that no 50 bp window contain a run
of ten A's or ten T's. ClustalW [52] alignment was used to
eliminate redundancy, by setting the following two criteria: (i) where a cluster contained two or more identical
sequences, the longest was retained, and (ii) where the
members of a cluster fell into recognisable sub-groups,
only one member of each sub-group was retained.
Sequences composed entirely of SSR motif (i.e., lacking
any flanking sequence) were discarded, since their
uniqueness could not be established, and in any case,
primer design is not possible. SSR-containing sequences
were identified using MISA software [24], a Perl script
which allows both perfect and compound SSRs to be
detected. A sequence was considered an SSR where a motif

was repeated at least 12 times (1 nt motif), seven times (2
nt) or five times (3–6 nt), allowing for only one mismatch. For compound repeats, the maximum default
interruption (spacer) length was set at 100 bp.
Primer pairs were designed from the flanking sequences,
using PRIMER3 software [53] in batch mode via the
p3_in.pl and p3_out.pl Perl5 scripts within the MISA package. The target amplicon size was set as 100–300 bp, the
optimal annealing temperature as 60°C, and the optimal
primer length as 20 bp. The resulting markers were each
assigned the prefix EEMS (EST Eggplant MicroSatellite).
Local BLASTN analyses were carried out using all EEMS
sequences as queries. The target database contained
1,524,584 entries derived from a variety of solanaceous
species, retrieved from the EMBL sequence database
(Release 93)

Plant material, DNA extraction and PCR
EEMS informativeness was evaluated using a panel of 44
accessions, made up from 38 cultivated eggplant varieties,
breeding lines and rootstocks, and six related wild Solanum species (Table 2). Cross-species transferability was
tested against tomato, pepper and potato DNA. DNA was
isolated from young leaves using the method described by
Doyle and Doyle [54]. PCR amplification was carried out
in 20 μl reactions, each containing 10 ng genomic DNA,
10 nmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mmol/L KCl, 2.5 mmol/
L MgCl2, 0.5 U Taq polymerase, 0.2 mmol/L dNTP, 200
nmol/L unlabeled reverse primer and 200 nmol/L
IRD700-labelled forward primer. A touchdown PCR protocol was applied, consisting of a 94°C/5 min denaturation, 11 cycles of 94°C/30 s, 60°C/30 s decreasing by 0.5°
per cycle, and 72°C/60 s, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C/
30 s, 55°C/30 s and 72°C/60 s. The success of each amplification was monitored by analysis of the reaction product
following 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and successful

amplicons were separated by denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a LI-COR Gene ReadIR 4200
device, as described by Jackson and Matthews [55]. Determination of amplicon size was achieved by including an
lRD700-labelled 50–350 bp ladder in each well. The data
were collected by e-Seq software (DNA Sequencing and
Analysis Software) v3.0.
Data analysis
The polymorphism information content (PIC) of an SSR
combines the number of alleles and their frequency distribution within a population [56]. For the present purposes, it was estimated as by Anderson et al. [57]. The SSR
products were scored as band presence (1) and absence
(0), thus generating a binary matrix. The binary data
matrix was used to compute pair-wise similarity coefficients [58], and the similarity matrices obtained were utilized to construct a UPGMA-based dendrogram [58].
Principal co-ordinate analysis (PCO) was carried out to
display the multi-dimensional relationship between
