Abstract
Background: Ornithine decarboxylase antizymes are proteins which negatively regulate cellular
polyamine levels via their affects on polyamine synthesis and cellular uptake. In virtually all
organisms from yeast to mammals, antizymes are encoded by two partially overlapping open
reading frames (ORFs). A +1 frameshift between frames is required for the synthesis of antizyme.
Ribosomes change translation phase at the end of the first ORF in response to stimulatory signals
embedded in mRNA. Since standard sequence analysis pipelines are currently unable to recognise
sites of programmed ribosomal frameshifting, proper detection of full length antizyme coding
sequences (CDS) requires conscientious manual evaluation by a human expert. The rapid growth
of sequence information demands less laborious and more cost efficient solutions for this problem.
This manuscript describes a rapid and accurate computer tool for antizyme CDS detection that
requires minimal human involvement.
Results: We have developed a computer tool, OAF (ODC antizyme finder) for identifying
antizyme encoding sequences in spliced or intronless nucleic acid sequenes. OAF utilizes a
combination of profile hidden Markov models (HMM) built separately for the products of each
open reading frame constituting the entire antizyme coding sequence. Profile HMMs are based on
a set of 218 manually assembled antizyme sequences. To distinguish between antizyme paralogs and
orthologs from major phyla, antizyme sequences were clustered into twelve groups and specific
combinations of profile HMMs were designed for each group. OAF has been tested on the current
version of dbEST, where it identified over six thousand Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) sequences
encoding antizyme proteins (over two thousand antizyme CDS in these ESTs are non redundant).
Conclusion: OAF performs well on raw EST sequences and mRNA sequences derived from
genomic annotations. OAF will be used for the future updates of the RECODE database. OAF can
also be useful for identifying novel antizyme sequences when run with relaxed parameters. It is
anticipated that OAF will be used for EST and genome annotation purposes. OAF outputs sequence
annotations in fasta, genbank flat file or XML format. The OAF web interface and the source code
are freely available at http://recode.ucc.ie/oaf/ and at a mirror site http://recode.genetics.utah.edu/

Background
Ornithine Decarboxylase Antizymes are important negative regulators of cellular polyamine levels. In mammals,
antizyme-1 inhibits ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an
enzyme catalyzing the first and rate-limiting step in
polyamine biosynthesis. Antizyme-1 binds to ODC and
targets it for ubiquitin-independent degradation by the
26S proteosome in a multiple-turnover manner (a single
antizyme molecule can cause degradation of several ODC
molecules) [1,2]. Additionally, antizyme-1 regulates the
intracellular concentration of polyamines by inhibiting
cellular import of polyamines and accelerating polyamine
export from the cell [3-5]. While genomes of lower
eukaryotes contain single antizyme genes, multiple paralogs have evolved in higher eukaryotes, with at least two
antizymes in vertebrates [6,7], three in mammals [8,9]
and up to five in certain fish species [10]. Antizyme paralogs vary somewhat in their function, although all are
implicated in the regulation of polyamine synthesis (and
some are reported to link with other pathways [11,12]).
Antizyme paralogs usually have a distinct expression pattern with certain paralogs being expressed in a strictly
restrictive tissue-specific manner, such as testis-specific
mammalian antizyme 3 [8,9] or retina and brain specific
antizyme AZR from Danio rerio [13]. Reviews of antizyme
function and distribution are available [10,14,15].
Given the important role that antizymes play in the regulation of polyamine concentrations, it is not surprising
that their own biosynthesis is regulated in response to
changes of cellular polyamine concentrations.
Polyamines' concentrations are sensed during the elongation stage of antizyme mRNA translation. Unlike the great
majority of CDS-es, that for virtually all eukaryotic
antizymes consists of two overlapping open reading
frames. Synthesis of full-length antizyme protein requires
a portion of translating ribosomes to switch translation
phase at the end of the first ORF into the partially overlapping ORF (in +1 translation phase) in a process termed
programmed ribosomal frameshifting [16]. The portion
of ribosomes that do not shift frames, terminate at the end
of the first ORF with release of relatively short encoded
polypeptide. Increases in cellular polyamine levels result
in elevated frameshifting efficiency and so of synthesis of
fully functional antizyme. The competition between
frameshifting and termination at the end of the first ORF
is a sensor of polyamine concentration that provides an
elegant mechanism for regulatory negative feedback (Figure 1A).
The +1 frameshifting event during antizyme biosynthesis
significantly complicates automatic detection of its fulllength CDS in mRNA. This is due to the lack of reliable
and efficient algorithms for predicting ribosomal
frameshifting locations. A number of attempts have been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/178

made recently to develop computational approaches for
predicting instances of the ribosomal frameshifting [1722]. Some of these approaches could be useful for detecting candidate sequences that are prone to efficient (not
necessarily programmed) frameshifting within particular
groups of organisms [17-19,23]. However, they are not
suitable for reliable detection of programmed ribosomal
frameshifting events without experimental verification or
additional expert human involvement. The reasons
underlying the consistent failure to develop highly accurate algorithms for ribosomal frameshifting prediction lie
in the very nature of programmed ribosomal frameshifting. The efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting is modulated by highly diverse sequence elements many of which
evolved independently. The mechanisms by which such
elements alter translation also vary considerably. The situation is further complicated by differences in the translation machinery (sequences of ribosomal components,
differences in tRNAs properties and their relative concentrations) across different organisms, leading to a situation
where the same sequence is shift-prone in one organism,
but in another it is accurately translated in a standard triplet-manner. Therefore, it is not possible to find even a
single nucleotide sequence feature that would specify a
site of ribosomal frameshifting universal for all organisms. Information regarding the diversity of genes utilizing programmed ribosomal frameshifting for their
expression as well as multifarious sequences modulating
frameshifting process is available at the Recode database,
which is currently the richest Internet resource [24,25], as
well as, comprehensive literature reviews on this and
related topics [26-35]. In fact, currently antizyme mRNAs
themselves are the most plentiful source of diverse
frameshift stimulator signals as evident from the recent
detailed review covering nearly three hundred antizyme
mRNA sequences [10]. A collection of sequences
described in that review was used here for the design of
OAF (Additional file 1).
It appears that approaches to predict frameshifting specifically for particular clusters of related genes produce more
reliable results. Such approaches were applied for -1
frameshifting involved in the synthesis of viral polyproteins [21], different types of frameshifting events in
decoding bacteriophage tail assembly genes [20], and +1
frameshifting during the synthesis of bacterial release factors 2 [22]. Indeed ribosomal frameshifting utilized by a
group of homologous genes likely has the same origin.
While evolution introduces organism specific alterations
in the sequence of the frameshifting cassette, as well as,
diversifying protein sequence, a detectable degree of similarity is frequently recognizable. Though existence of
such similarity may not be a universal rule (as evident
with the frameshifting utilized in decoding bacteriophage
tail assembly genes [20] where only genomic localization

of overlapping ORFs is conserved), it holds true for many
cases. Therefore, knowledge of a few examples of ribosomal frameshifting from homologous genes can be sufficient for designing algorithms for automatic and accurate
prediction of ribosomal frameshifting utilized in decoding of homologous genes. By dealing with each group of
homologous genes utilizing ribosomal frameshifting separately one-by-one, we aim to build a collection of autonomic computer tools capable of automatically predicting
most cases of ribosomal frameshifting in newly sequenced
organisms. OAF is our second computer tool designed in
pursuit of this goal. Our first tool, ARFA detects and annotates the programmed ribosomal frameshifting required
for expression of certain bacterial release factors [22].
Both tools will be used for future updates of the Recode
database.

Implementation
OAF is written in Perl, it utilizes BioPerl libraries [36]. The
OAF Web interface was designed using PHP.

Outline of the analysis performed by OAF
Antizyme mRNAs from different organisms have evolved
a remarkable assortment of RNA signals for stimulating or
modulating the +1 ribosomal frameshifting used in their
expression. Many sequence features are shared among
closely related antizyme mRNAs. For example, two distinct types of frameshift-enhancing RNA pseudoknots are
embedded in antizyme-1 and antizyme-2 mRNAs from
mammals. Nevertheless, not a single feature is universally
conserved. Instead of trying to account for known
frameshifting stimulators, we have devised an antizyme
gene detection scheme based on detection of sequences
encoding antizymes. While antizyme protein sequences
are highly diverse, there is a reasonable degree of sequence
similarity within large phylogenetic groups allowing their
detection based on similarity searches. Most importantly,
eukaryotic antizyme genes share the same ORF organisation: the upstream ORF is smaller than the downstream
ORF and the downstream ORF is always in the +1 translational phase relative to the first one. Therefore our

method is based on a search for two overlapping ORFs
corresponding to profile HMMs designed using sequences
of known antizymes. Mutual orientation of the ORFs is
further examined to verify that it corresponds to an
expected transition between translational phases. For
large sequences (>20 kb), OAF performs an initial FASTA
search with relaxed parameters, where a mixture of divergent antizyme sequences is used as a query. This is used to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/178

increase OAF speed by reducing the number of candidate
sequences for subsequent HMM analysis. Relaxed parameters decrease the chances of losing true positives in this
process. The scheme of analyses performed by OAF is
illustrated in Figure 2.

Profile HMMs and automatic classification of antizymes
To design profile HMMs exploited by OAF, we used a collection of protein sequences derived from mRNA fragments using manually assembled ESTs. These sequences
were described in some detail in a recent antizyme review
[10] and are available in this article as an Additional File
1 (manualOAZs.fasta). Evolutionary distances between
protein sequences were estimated using a NeighbourJoining algorithm and poisson correction evolutionary
model implemented in MEGA3.1 program [37]. Based on
these distances, sequences were clustered into 12 homologous groups for which separate pairs of profile HMMs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/178

were designed using HMMER [38]. These HMMs are used
to allow discrimination among different antizyme paralogs and to permit approximate estimation of the taxonomic origins of antizyme encoding sequences. The
clustering is shown on the tree generated with MEGA3.1
(see Figure 3).
A separate profile HMM is built for the frameshift site
itself. This HMM is not used for identification of
antizymes or frameshift sites. However a predicted
frameshift site is compared to the HMM and corresponding E-score can be reported in the output to facilitate fur-

ther processing of data such as identification of unusual
frameshift sites or detection of sequencing errors disguised as cryptic frameshift sites. Figure 1B illustrates conservation of OAZ frameshift sites as a web logo [39].
OAF I/O interface
Input
There are two types of searches that can be performed by
OAF. First a given nucleotide sequence or multiple
sequences (either provided in a user's file in a fasta format
or as a Genbank accession number) can be analyzed for
the presence of antizyme CDS (first two modes in Figure
2). Second (third mode in Figure 2), protein sequences of
known antizymes in a user's fasta file can be used as query
for a search against a database of nucleotide sequences
(either in a local Blast database or in a remote BLAST database at NCBI). A user can specify the genetic code table
and usage of alternative initiation codons (by default CDS
can start only with ATG/AUG).

Output
OAF reports sequences of encoded antizymes either as raw
sequence, or in fasta, genbank or XML format. XML contains detailed information regarding the frameshift site
and is compatible with a future version of Recode database. By default, OAF reports all sequences encoding
antizymes, even if their ORF organization does not correspond to that for utilization of +1 frameshifting or if only
a partial antizyme sequence is found. Such, likely erroneous sequences, can be filtered out automatically.

grouped as corresponding to the same antizyme mRNA.
24 new antizyme sequences, which were not present in
the original dataset (Additional file 1), were detected, see
Table 2.

Web interface
The web interface of OAF (see Availability and Requirements section). It serves mostly illustrative purposes and
has limited capabilities compared to a full version of Oaf.
Web service allows analysis of a single user-provided
sequence for the presence of encoding antizyme.

OAF has detected a number of highly similar variant OAZ
sequences supported by multiple ESTs corresponding to
the same species. Some of these sequences are most likely
allelic variants while others correspond to recent gene
duplication events. OAZ variants are summarized in Table
3.

Results and Discussion

OAF detected a number of sequences whose OAZ clustering (Figure 3) did not match the taxonomy of the source
organisms. These sequences are likely contaminants that
were introduced from pests, symbionts, food or cell hosts
(see Table 4). Some of these contaminations were previously reported in [10].

To evaluate OAF prediction sensitivity for genome annotations, the mRNA sequences of 20 completed eukaryotic
genomes were downloaded from the RefSeq database
[40]. OAF detected 18 OAZ genes (Table 1). No genes
encoding antizymes were detected in plant genomes
(Table 1). To evaluate OAF prediction selectivity, a random sequence database (totalling 10 Tbp) was generated
by a fifth order Markov chains based on six-mer frequencies of each mRNA of the genomic sequences. OAF did not
detect any OAZ sequence in this database.
To estimate OAF accuracy on EST sequences, the June
2007 dbEST was used [41]. OAF detected antizyme
sequences in 6639 ESTs, among them there are 2067
unique sequences coding for antizyme. Many of these
sequences were truncated mRNA fragments that can be

first column. The second column shows the number of OAZ genes

Conclusion
We have developed a simple computer utility for identification of OAZ encoding sequences in nucleic acids, called
OAF (ODC antizyme finder). It performs with high speed
and accuracy on mRNA sequences annotated in completed genomes as well as on raw RNA sequences from
EST collections.

OAZ corresponding to sequences from contaminating organisms are shown. Names of organisms where contaminants were found are given in the
first column. The second column represents the corresponding taxonomic family. The third column shows an OAZ cluster to which an OAZ is
expected to belong based on the taxonomy of the source organism. The third column shows a cluster to which the sequence belongs. The fourth
column lists the likely source of contamination. The fifth contains EST accession numbers.
