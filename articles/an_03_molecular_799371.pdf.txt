Abstract
Background: Aminoadipate reductase (Lys2) is a fungal-specific protein. This enzyme contains an
adenylating domain. A similar primary structure can be found in some bacterial antibiotic/peptide
synthetases. In this study, we aimed to determine which bacterial adenylating domain is most
closely related to Lys2. In addition, we analyzed the substitution rate of the adenylating domainencoding region.
Results: Some bacterial proteins contain more than two similar sequences to that of the
adenylating domain of Lys2. We compared 67 amino acid sequences from 37 bacterial and 10 fungal
proteins. Phylogenetic trees revealed that the lys2 genes are monophyletic; on the other hand,
bacterial antibiotic/peptide synthase genes were not found to be monophyletic. Comparative
phylogenetic studies among closely related fungal lys2 genes showed that the rate of insertion/
deletion in these genes was lower and the nucleotide substitution rate was higher than that in the
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions.
Conclusions: The lys2 gene is one of the most useful tools for revealing the phylogenetic
relationships among fungi, due to its low insertion/deletion rate and its high substitution rate. Lys2
is most closely related to certain bacterial antibiotic/peptide synthetases, but a common ancestor
of Lys2 and these synthetases evolutionarily branched off in the distant past.

Background
Not only fungi, but also certain prokaryotes synthesize
lysine through the 2-aminoadipate pathway [1–3]. However, the prokaryotic pathway is not identical to that of
fungi. The fungal process required to synthesize lysine
from 2-aminoadipate differs from that of prokaryotes [4].
The first step of this fungal-specific pathway is the reduction of 2-aminoadipate.
Aminoadipate reductase converts 2-aminoadipate to 2aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde via an adenosylated derivative. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this reaction requires

Mg2+ and the participation of the products of two genes,
lys2 and lys5 [5]. Recently, it has been shown that aminoadipate reductase is encoded by only lys2, and that the
Lys5 protein appears to be a specific phosphopantetheinyl
transferase for Lys2, converting the inactive apo-Lys2 to
the active holo-Lys2 [6,7].
The lys2 gene is a fungal-specific gene and generally appears to be present in a single copy in the genome. The
Lys2 protein has no extensive homologous protein in eukaryotes, with the exception of fungi, but it does possess
similarity to some bacterial antibiotic/peptide synthetases

[4,8–10]. Recently, Drosophila and mouse were found to
have the analogue of Lys2, which function under degradation of lysine [11]. However, Lys2 is more similar bacterial
antibiotic/peptide synthetases than the animal proteins.
Lys2 has an adenylating, a peptidyl carrier, and a reductive
domain. This protein has twelve conserved motifs. The
adenylating domain contains nine conserved motifs [12].
In this study, we aimed to reveal which bacterial adenylating domain is the most closely related to Lys2.
In addition, in order to determine the substitution rate of
lys2, we compared the lys2 sequences from closely related
fungi. In this study, we sequenced lys2 fragments [13] and
compared them among black-koji molds of the Aspergillus
niger group.

Results and Discussion
The deduced amino acid sequences (each 343 amino-acids long) from Aspergillus awamori IAM 2112, A. awamori
IAM 2299, A. awamori IAM 2300, A. saitoi IAM 2210, A.
saitoi IAM 2215, A. saitoi IAM 14608, A. saitoi var. kagoshimaensis IAM 2190, and A. saitoi var. kagoshimaensis IAM
2191 were identical. Those from A. usamii IAM 2185 and
IAM 2186 differed from the other black-koji molds by one
amino acid. The nucleotide sequences from A. awamori
IAM 2112, IAM 2299, and IAM 2300 were identical. Those
from A. saitoi IAM 2210 and IAM 2215 were identical.
Those from A. saitoi var. kagoshimaensis IAM 2190 and
IAM 2191 were identical. Those from A. usamii IAM 2185
and IAM 2186 were identical. Aspergillus awamori's sequence was 10 nucleotides different from that of A. saitoi

IAM 2210 and IAM 2215, and 40 nucleotides different
from that of A. usamii.
We deposited the sequences in the DNA Data Bank of Japan under accession numbers AB079758, AB085587,
AB079759,
AB085588,
AB085589,
AB079760,
AB085590, AB079761, and AB085591 for A. awamori IAM
2299, A. awamori IAM 2300, A. saitoi IAM 2210, A. saitoi
IAM 2215, A. saitoi IAM 14608, A. saitoi var. kagoshimaensis
IAM 2190, A. saitoi var. kagoshimaensis IAM 2191, A. usamii IAM 2185, and A. usamii IAM 2186, respectively.
Comparisons between A. awamori and Penicillium chrysogenum (Table 1) and between A. awamori and A. fumigatus (Table 2) showed that the rate of insertion/deletion in
lys2 was lower and the nucleotide substitution rate was
higher than that in ITS regions. We therefore believe that
lys2 is a more powerful tool to reveal phylogenetic relationships among fungi than are the ITS regions.
The result of the homology search using BLAST showed
that Lys2 had a more similar sequence to that of certain
bacterial antibiotic/peptide synthetases than did any other existing proteins. In addition, some bacterial antibiotic/
peptide synthetases were shown to contain more than two
homologous regions. For example, RS05859 in Ralstonia
solanacearum GMI1000 has five homologous regions.
Therefore, we obtained 57 amino acid sequences, with a
value of E < 10-25, from 39 proteins (see Materials and
Methods).

The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1ab) shows that the adenylating domains from some bacterial antibiotic/peptide synthetases are distributed quite widely, and that
duplications and/or horizontal transfers occurred many
times. For example, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 has 12 similar
sequences within itself. In this tree, these 12 sequences
were distributed among at least 6 groups. The present
findings indicate that duplication and/or horizontal
transfer occurred in the genome of Anabaena sp. PCC
7120. On the other hand, the adenylating domains from
Lys2 formed a monophyletic cluster. However, the neighbor-joining tree presented here did not clarify which bacterial domain was most closely related to that of Lys2.
In order to determine which bacterial domain was most
closely related to that of Lys2, a maximum likelihood
analysis using PHYLIP version 3.6 [14] was carried out.
We selected 27 amino acid sequences from the 67 sequences used in the neighbor-joining analysis. The alignment used in maximum likelihood analysis is shown in
Fig. 2. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3) indicates that a protein (AGR L 2311) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens is most
closely related to a common ancestor of Lys2, but this result had only weak bootstrap support (17%). In the bootstrap consensus tree (Fig. 3), the branch points at the early
stage of evolution are very weak support. Animals and
plants have no Lys2. If the common ancestor of eukaryotes had a similar protein, the other eukaryotes except for
fungi had lost it.

Conclusions
This study indicated that Lys2 is more closely related to
certain bacterial antibiotic/peptide synthetases than it is
to any other known proteins. However, in the distant past,
a common ancestor of Lys2 branched off from the bacterial antibiotic/peptide synthetase. This study did not find
evidence for a direct horizontal transfer (i.e., at least not a
recent horizontal transfer) between bacteria and a common ancestor of fungi. The lys2 gene has been inherited
during fungal evolution. On the other hand, in the course
of bacterial evolution, the duplication and/or horizontal
transfer have occurred.

Materials and Methods
In this study, we used Aspergillus awamori IAM 2299, A.
awamori IAM 2300, A. saitoi IAM 2210, A. saitoi IAM 2215,
A. saitoi IAM 14608, A. saitoi var. kagoshimaensis IAM
2190, A. saitoi var. kagoshimaensis IAM 2191, A. usamii
IAM 2185, and A. usamii IAM 2186. Potato dextrose agar
was used for the cultivation. Genomic DNA isolation,
DNA amplification, and the sequencing of lys2 fragments
were performed according to the method of An et al. [13].
We compared the nuclear small subunit rRNA genes (18S
rDNAs), ITS1 regions, ITS2 regions, and lys2 genes be-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/9

tween A. awamori and Penicillium chrysogenum and between A. awamori and A. fumigatus. The following
nucleotide-sequence accession numbers were used:
D63695, A. awamori 18S rDNA [15]; U03518, A. awamori
ITS1 [16]; U03519, A. awamori ITS2 [16]; AB076077, A.
awamori lys2 [13]; M55628, P. chrysogenum 18S rDNA;
AJ270768, P. chrysogenum ITS1 and ITS2 [17]; Y13967, P.
chrysogenum lys2 [18]; AB008401, A. fumigatus 18S rDNA
[19]; AF455542, A. fumigatus ITS1 and ITS2. The preliminary sequence of lys2 was obtained from The Institute for
Genomic Research website at http://www.tigr.org.
We performed a homology search using BLAST [20] with
the parameter values given in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes [21]. The query amino acid sequence
was a fragment of Saitoella complicata Lys2 [13]. In this
study, we phylogenetically analyzed 57 amino acid sequences (all sequences had a value of E < 10-25, according
to the BLAST search results) separately from those of fungi. Multiple alignment was created using CLUSTAL W [22]
among the 57 high-scoring sequences and those of 10
fungal Lys2 proteins. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic
tree was constructed using MEGA version 2.1 [23] with
1,000 bootstrap replicates. Based on this tree, we selected
27 amino acid sequences for a maximum likelihood analysis, which was performed using PHYLIP version 3.6 [14].
We used three programs (consense, proml, and seqboot)
for constructing phylogenetic tree with 100 bootstrap
replicates.
