Abstract
Background: The elastin gene (ELN) is implicated as a factor in both supravalvular aortic stenosis
(SVAS) and Williams Beuren Syndrome (WBS), two diseases involving pronounced complications
in mental or physical development. Although the complete spectrum of functional roles of the
processed gene product remains to be established, these roles are inferred to be analogous in
human and mouse. This view is supported by genomic sequence comparison, in which there are no
large-scale differences in the ~1.8 Mb sequence block encompassing the common region deleted in
WBS, with the exception of an overall reversed physical orientation between human and mouse.
Results: Conserved synteny around ELN does not translate to a high level of conservation in the
gene itself. In fact, ELN orthologs in mammals show more sequence divergence than expected for
a gene with a critical role in development. The pattern of divergence is non-conventional due to an
unusually high ratio of gaps to substitutions. Specifically, multi-sequence alignments of eight
mammalian sequences reveal numerous non-aligning regions caused by species-specific insertions
and deletions, in spite of the fact that the vast majority of aligning sites appear to be conserved and
undergoing purifying selection.
Conclusions: The pattern of lineage-specific, in-frame insertions/deletions in the coding exons of
ELN orthologous genes is unusual and has led to unique features of the gene in each lineage. These
differences may indicate that the gene has a slightly different functional mechanism in mammalian
lineages, or that the corresponding regions are functionally inert. Identified regions that undergo
purifying selection reflect a functional importance associated with evolutionary pressure to retain
those features.

Background
As part of the broader NISC Comparative Sequencing Program (see http://www.nisc.nih.gov), we generated
sequences of the genomic region encompassing the locus
commonly deleted in WBS in multiple mammalian species. The resulting multiple-sequence alignments provide
the opportunity to examine properties of orthologous
genes (such as ELN) that might clarify a functional role or
contribution to human disease.
Elastin is a highly hydrophobic protein that plays a major
role providing the property of elastic recoil in dermis,
lungs, and blood vessels. Two types of alternating
domains are characterized: (1) hydrophobic (rich in glycine, valine, and proline) and (2) crosslinking (rich in
alanine and lysine) [1,2]. Both types of domains are
encoded in distinct, usually alternating vertebrate exons,
which may be subject to alternate splicing [3-7].
The single-copy ELN gene is located in a region of conserved synteny between human 7q11.23 and mouse chromosome 5G. This region is referred to as the Williams
region [5,8] and encompasses roughly 30 genes. Genomic
sequences of additional species such as baboon, cow, cat,
and rat show conserved synteny around ELN (Pam Thomas, personal communication), thus indicating that the
gross anatomy of the region does not contribute to any
anticipated changes in ELN function between species.
Moreover, when alignments are viewed at the nucleotide
level, most coding exons in the large region display contiguous columns of nucleotides that are classified as a
match or mismatch, but are devoid of gapped positions.
Contrary to this common characteristic, two of the WBS
genes, ELN [9] and WBSCR15 [10], show strikingly less
sequence conservation, both at the nucleotide and amino
acid levels. Differences in the patterns of their divergence
have not been previously analyzed.
A second, non-conventional feature of ELN is found in its
structure. The exon/intron ratio is unusually low, reflecting small exons interspersed within large introns [3]. This
feature represents a contradiction to the observed correlation between GC-rich genomic sequences and short
intron length [11].
Mutations of ELN are implicated in several human disorders, including supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), Williams syndrome [12], and cutis laxa [13,14]. Disease
phenotypes are associated with multiple types of
sequence changes including large deletions, translocations, nonsense-, frameshift-, and splice-site mutations
[15-18]. Previous studies that examined limited alignments in the 3' end of the ELN locus in five species noted
particularly dense accumulations of repetitive sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/31

immediately downstream of the gene [4,5] that contribute
to rearrangements in the primate lineage.
An analysis of multiple sequence alignments of the ELN
gene from up to 9 species reveals the nucleotide substitution patterns at synonymous and non-synonymous sites.
This approach identifies the presence of numerous inframe insertions/deletions (in/dels) within coding exons
that have lineage-specific characteristics but do not diminish the overall hydrophobic character of the protein. Contrary to the expectation that genes with such a high level
of nucleotide divergence would be undergoing positive
selection, the remaining bases are highly conserved and
are undergoing purifying selection. These results have
implications for the use of animal models with ELN mutations as well as for studies of genomic evolution.

Results
Gene structure
The expectation that orthologous coding exons in the 1.6Mb genomic region commonly deleted in Williams Syndrome [9] align as highly conserved (gap-free) sequences
among mammalian species is confirmed by the RFC2,
LIMK1, and BAZ1B genes. ELN, however, is one example
of a gene with a critical role in development that differs
among its orthologs. Since the functional mechanism of
the ELN protein is not fully elucidated, we sought to discern the nature of the divergence of this unusual gene.
Although maintaining an overall interspersed structure of
hydrophobic and cross-linking domains in all species,
divergence occurs in the form of gaps in aligned coding
exons and species-specific exons. The gapped alignment
columns reveal a range of exon sizes among species (see
Fig. 1 and supplemental Table A). Furthermore cow, pig,
cat, and dog ELN genes have 36 exons, whereas mouse
and rat ELN genes have 37 exons, due to an additional
exon inserted after exon 4 (i.e., 4A). Some of these
changes are recent; for instance the loss of two exons in
human ELN (giving it 34 total) [19].

Alignment of human and mouse ELN cDNA sequences
reveals 64.5% identity at the nucleotide level and 64.1%
identity and 72.6% similarity at the amino acid level
(with about 20% gaps; Table 2). This is well below the
average percent identity of 85% at the nucleotide level and
78.5% at the amino acid level for human and mouse
cDNAs [20] and is more similar to the average of 69%
identity found in intronic regions. Although such divergence is typical of genes undergoing positive selection,
these values are far below that of other genes in the region,
with the exception of WBSCR15/Wbscr15 [10]. Rat and
mouse ELN proteins share the most similarity at 91% consistent with the average percent identity calculated for
11,071 known mouse and rat cDNA orthologs of 92.6%.

The lower level of sequence conservation among ELN
orthologs is also associated with differences in gene structure among species. Although the splice junctions in the
human [16] and other mammalian ELN genes in all cases
contain consensus GT/AG signals, they vary in their positions in the different orthologs. This leads to differences in

the sizes of orthologous exons. For example, there are six
ELN splice junctions that are not shared between mouse
and human based on the whole-genome blastz alignments
([21] shown on Fig. 2). These splice junctions are either
altered by a nucleotide change, fall in a region of sequence
expansion/contraction, or are not represented in the

alignment because the exons failed to align. A closer look
at these exons identifies a lineage-specific deletion in
human ELN (Fig. 2 top panel) that corresponds to mouse
exon 26 (at the 5' end of the exon). Internal deletions of
varying sizes are illustrated in Fig. 2, bottom panel. Additionally, the use of alternative splice junctions can contribute to variable exon size; for instance, an alternate 5'
splice junction in human is also completely conserved in
baboon (data not shown).
The splicing pattern in human ELN uses a uniform phase
1 intron selection [16]. Here, the splice acceptor site falls
after the first nucleotide of the last codon in an exon and
the splice donor site falls immediately prior to the last two
nucleotides of the interrupted codon. Interestingly, this
pattern is also found in the ELN gene of seven other mammals, while being underrepresented in most other genes.
Examination of 35,657 genes from the known gene track
of the UCSC Genome Browser [22] shows that introns
end in a phase 0, 1, and 2 fashion 43%, 32%, and 24% of
the time, respectively; these figures are fairly consistent
with previous studies done on fewer genes [23,24]. The

majority of genes, including many within the Williams
region, use a mixture of these splice options; however, a
minority of genes (2,422 or 6%) contains a uniform splicing pattern throughout. Of these, 42% are phase 0, 46%
are phase 1, and 0.8% are phase 2. Such uniform phasing
may increase the transcript diversity of a gene by providing options that create maximal flexibility in the alternative use of exons without disrupting the reading frame.
Sequence divergence among species
The numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions per synonymous and non-synonymous sites,
respectively, were computed across the ELN gene using
the Li-Wu-Luo method [25]. The complete-deletion
option was used, thus only those codons shared among
all species examined were included in the analyses. While
the above findings suggested that ELN is under positive
selection, studies of nucleotide divergence suggest otherwise, i.e., that ELN is evolving under strong purifying
selection, as indicated by Ks being much higher than corresponding Ka values (Tables 3 and 4). Close inspection
of the pair-wise and multi-species protein alignments

changes in the ELN gene are recent. The lower panel shows gaps in all sequences except one, which would normally indicate
an insertion in that one sequence. However, the gaps differ in size (and are thus likely a product of multiple different events),
suggesting that the region is indeed undergoing dynamic rearrangements. Panels A and B are from the same alignment, however differences result from exons that do not align in different species.

reveal that the majority of insertions are hydrophobic and
targeted more frequently to the hydrophobic domains.
Comparison of Ka/Ks ratios reveal that hydrophobic
regions have accumulated significantly more non-synonymous changes than cross-linking regions (average Ka/Ks
values are 0.217 and 0.121 for hydrophobic and crosslinking regions, respectively; t = 14.8, p < 0.001). Nevertheless, the hydrophobic and crosslinking domains do
not show a perceivable disparity in their functional
importance, since both have significantly higher levels of
synonymous versus non-synonymous substitutions for all
species examined.

where expanded regions of the insertion in exons 6 and 8
are absent in the primate lineage (parts A and B, respectively; see also Figure 1). Many of the inserted amino acids
are represented by 4-fold degenerate codons. The occurrence of identical amino acids in the repeat sequences
reveals the use of different synonymous codons (e.g., this
stretch of alanines: GCT-GCA-GCC-GCT-...GCA-GCT-...;)
within the same species. This suggests that these insertion
events did not result from the expansion of trinucleotide
repeats and/or that mutation and repair mechanisms are
not fully balanced. Furthermore, the inserted codons in
closely related species show convergent differences at synonymous positions. For example, exon 6 of mouse, rat,
cow and pig have an alanine insertion, yet, the mouse and
pig gene share a C at the third codon position, while the
rat and cow share a T. The same site in dog and primates
lacks this insertion. Similarly, in exon 8, the sequence
from cow has adjacent GAGV-repeats; yet, at the nucleotide level, this segment exhibits three synonymous differences at the third codon positions. One possible
scenario that led to these changes is shown in Figure 3D.
Thus none of the segments that contain repetitive variations of only few amino acids (e.g., PGVA or AAAAYKAA
motifs) appear to be the result of internal duplications.

The majority of repeat elements in the elastin protein contain variations of PGVA or AAAAYKAA amino acid motifs
that appear in the hydrophobic and crosslinking
domains, respectively. There are many combinations of
separated, tandem, and periodic repeats, present in
lengths that vary from 5 to 41 amino acids; these data
indicate that no particular repeat consensus is maintained. Furthermore, in contrast to deletions in the coding
regions of the SCA and PRNP genes that align perfectly
between human and mouse [26] the repeat elements in
the elastin gene differ among species. Figure 3 shows two
examples of the substitution patterns in repeat sites,

Compositional differences between hydrophobic (H) and crosslinking (CL) regions of ELN genes among eight mammalian species (Haa - CLaa, %).

Both types of domains contain a large amount of hydrophobic amino acids (hydrophobic regions are glycine-rich
and crosslinking regions are alanine-rich), and have
minor differences in the amino acid content among species (Figure 4). In particular, human and baboon have an
excess of valine in their hydrophobic regions, whereas
bovine has an excess of both valine and proline.
Genomic features
Several features of the ELN locus make it noteworthy. The
genomic interval encompassing the gene has a high GC
content (56%), which is notably higher than the human
genome average of 41%. Similarly high GC content is seen
for the orthologs in seven other vertebrates. The lowest
GC content (in rodents, 50%), is still significantly higher
than the mouse genome average of 42% [20]. Interestingly, the regions immediately flanking ELN show
extreme dips in GC-content. For example, in mouse, a
region of 42% GC is present 65 kb upstream of ELN,
between two uncharacterized genes (matching
pig_EST_BI340999 and mouse XM_132419.1). In
human, GC content dips to 39.9%, 60-kb upstream of
ELN. The regions of low GC content are also found to be
rich in SINES, LINES, LTRs, and simple repeats (data not

shown). Not surprisingly, several of the assembled
sequences have contig gaps near the repeat insertions.
Ancestral repeats (ancestral repeat families are described
in [20]) account for only 7% of the genomic interval containing the human ELN gene, whereas lineage-specific
repeats account for 22% of interspersed repeat nucleotides. Typically, SINES are strongly biased toward
regions of high GC content, as observed in the ELN locus.
However, the relative abundance of SINES in the human
(29%) and mouse (25%) ELN genes is higher than the
genome averages (13.6% and 8.2%, respectively; [20]).
The LTR content is highest in rat and mouse (although
slightly lower than the mouse genome average), suggesting that these species have undergone the most insertion
events.
Small scale deletion rates calculated from three-way alignments of rat, mouse and human show that rodents have
fewer deletions (on the order of 10 bp) in the ELN locus
than in the larger 1 Mb neighborhood (3.26 events per
nucleotide for rat and 3.59 for mouse; versus 3.97 and
4.40, respectively [27]). Insertion rates, in contrast, are
higher in the rat ELN locus (3.34) than in the 1 Mb neigh-

borhood (3.00) and the genome average (2.6 +/- 0.32).
Using gap size of equal or less than 20 bp, we computed
ratios of gap columns per coding nucleotides of the gene
in pairwise human-mouse blastz alignments. Compared
with the overall average ratio of 0.0218 gaps per coding
nucleotide observed for human chromosome 7 genes, the
ELN gene exhibited a striking ratio of 0.737 (species-specific exons were excluded). This observation is consistent
with numerous small-scale gaps observed at the protein
level in multi-species alignments (Figures 1 and 3). A similar analysis in WBSCR5 shows a ratio of .063, in which
one insertion of SPGPV hydrophobic residues is found in
the human protein, while the majority of the remaining
gaps fall within one contiguous area where the mouse
WBSCR5 gene is missing sequence orthologous to human
exon 10.
To date, 32 SNPs have been mapped within a 40,513-bp
region containing the human ELN gene. Only one of these
SNPs is located within a coding region, representing a synonymous substitution in exon 20 (REFSNP # 2071307);
this gives a frequency of 0.0004 SNPs per base pair in coding regions. The silent and non-coding polymorphisms
do not appear to affect the function of the protein, in contrast to missense SNPs found in SVAS patients (with an
occurrence of 1/20,000 births) [28], although their role(s)
in the regulation of transcription cannot be ruled out. In
SVAS patients, 20 different ELN exons show mutations
that affect the reading frame [28]). Even at 1 mutation per
exon, which is lower than observed, the resulting frequency of 0.009 changes per base pair differs from the frequency of synonymous changes by an order of
magnitude. This suggests that although the ELN gene
tolerates silent polymorphisms, mutations in the locus
frequently lead to events that diminish the function of the
protein.

Discussion
Initial comparisons of the human and mouse genome
sequences revealed three classes of genes associated with
divergent coding regions, those encoding extracellular,
immune system, and reproductive proteins [20]. The findings we report here, showing marked sequence divergence
with the ELN gene, are consistent with the elastin protein
being a major component of the extracellular matrix in
vertebrates. Furthermore, the differential alternative splicing seen with the gene might be used to tailor the structural function of the protein in different tissues. Several
alternatively spliced variants are associated with disease
phenotypes such as SVAS [28]. On the other hand, one of
alternatively spliced variants in human possesses highly
hydrophilic exon 26A that may play an important role
through its interactions with other matrix macromolecules [4] and therefore is selectively maintained in the
genome.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/31

Analyses of the human ELN gene reveal a dynamically
evolving region of the genome. For instance, mutant phenotypes associated with various SNPs in SVAS patients
suggest that the gene is susceptible to mutation. Additionally, the excision of two exons in the 3' end of the primate
gene indicates that the region has undergone recent
recombination. Other mechanisms that provide diversity
include species-specific alternative splicing and lineagespecific exons. Thus, there are multiple factors driving
ELN diversity (e.g., SNPs, recombination between repetitive elements, expansion and contraction of in/del units).
These findings are congruent with conclusions drawn in
Watanabe et al. (2002) [29], where it was shown that
early/late transitions in replication timing correlate with
high SNP frequency, increased DNA damage, transitions
in GC content, and concentrated occurrence of diseaserelated genes.
Multi-species nucleotide-level alignments alone do not
provide sufficient information to annotate the coding
sequence of the ELN genes, primarily due to splice junctions that align out of register among species. This pattern
results from the expansion and contraction of in/dels,
which makes the alignment output more complex to
interpret. Furthermore, amino acid alignments show that
the non-conserved amino acids are limited mainly to
hydrophobic or neutral sites. Many of these hydrophobic
residues are encoded by 4-fold degenerate codons that can
expand to "12-fold" degenerate sites. That is, amino acids
V, P, A, and G are encoded by 4-fold degenerate codons,
which in the case of V, P, and G start with the nucleotide
G, followed by any G, C, or T in the second codon position. Finally, 4 nucleotide choices are available in the
third codon. This suggests that nearly any nucleotide substitution in these sites is acceptable for the function of the
elastin protein, as long as it encodes one of these hydrophobic amino acids. Therefore, our results indicate that
nucleotide divergence is generally tolerated, but is localized to specific domains and/or sites (i.e., mainly hydrophobic regions). A potential mechanism for incorporating
runs of similar codons is slippage during replication [30].
However, diseases attributed to trinucleotide repeat
expansion have runs of a single codon (polyglutamine;
reviewed in [31]) and not a varying repeat unit, as seen
with ELN.
It appears unlikely that the amino acid insertions occurred
in an ancient lineage, since the number of duplicated in/
dels varies drastically among the modern sequences. The
identity of the variable repeat unit resembles the recognition site of the elastin-binding protein, PGAIPG [32],
located in human exon 16 [15]. This repeat is in a conserved position in cow, but not other species. Variations in
the hydrophobic repeat sequence could create new recognition sites for this or other interacting molecules, provid-

ing opportunities for modulating the level and type of
interaction. For example, some ligands for the bovine
elastin receptor are chemotactic for neutrophils and
fibroblasts [33,34]. If this were the case for human elastin,
then one would expect similar variability in other species.
For instance VGVAGP is also recognized as a ligand in
human, cow [32], and baboon [19], but is not conserved
in other species. Other identified ligands for the elastin
receptor in bovine (VGAMPG, VGMAPG, VGSLPG,
VGLSPG, and GIAPG) are also chemotactic for neutrophils and fibroblasts [33,34], although they are not
represented in the elastin protein. Since the ligand-binding sites are not conserved, it is likely that each species has
its own recognition signal and the diversity of the repeats
expands the repertoire of interacting molecules.
Beyond the coding region, evolutionary changes of the
ELN gene are also occurring through insertion and recombination of repetitive elements. In general, the ELN gene
in mammalian species contains a somewhat higher proportion of repeat elements that the rest of the genome,
with numerous repeats concentrated ~70 kb upstream of
the first coding exon (in a region of extremely low GC
content). These repeat elements are related in the rodent
lineage, but do not align to other species for which
sequence is available (e.g., cat and human), implying that
they occurred after the human-rodent speciation event.
The cat sequence shows an abundance of LINE1 elements
in its region of low GC content (data not shown), whereas
rodent sequences show a similar distribution of SINEs,
LINEs, and simple sequences. Coupled with evidence of
recombination between ALU repeats in primate species
[19], these observations suggest that the region may contain a hot spot for insertion of repetitive elements.
Our analyses indicate that although ELN appears to be
accumulating mutations (both nucleotide substitutions
and in/dels) in all mammalian lineages examined, the
locations and identity of these changes vary among species, perhaps with different functional consequences. The
fact that the majority of amino acid substitutions and in/
dels observed among eight mammalian species involve
hydrophobic amino acids may reflect selective pressure to
preserve the hydrophobic nature of the elastin protein.
Furthermore, most amino acid substitutions do not
change the chemical properties of the particular site, but
rather interchange similar amino acids (e.g., exchange of
glycine with valine or proline). Most of these evolutionary
changes are concentrated in the hydrophobic regions of
the protein, which represent a more flexible part of the
protein (despite the overall hydrophobicity, these regions
remain accessible on the protein surface [35]). Our results
suggest that changes in the hydrophobic regions do not
lead to major alterations to the structure and function of
the elastin protein, as long as the overall hydrophobic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/31

properties are maintained. In contrast, crosslinking
domains allow fewer substitutions and in/del events than
hydrophobic domains. This can be explained by purifying
selection that not only maintains the primary structure of
the protein, but also affects the spatial arrangement of
crosslinking regions (i.e., the main components responsible for elasticity). In short, the combination of purifying
selection acting to preserve the hydrophobic nature of the
protein and in-frame in/del events have shaped the
evolution of the ELN gene in mammals. Similar multispecies comparisons are needed to establish if this pattern
is specific for ELN or is more generally the case for genes
encoding structural proteins.

Conclusions
Vertebrate ELN is a divergent gene that plays an important
role in human health. Key structural and functional elements of the gene, including sequences of splice junctions
and alternation of hydrophobic and crosslinking
domains, are retained through purifying selection and
remain virtually unchanged across large phylogenetic distances. However, remaining parts of the gene (such
repeated PGVA or AAAAYKAA amino acid motifs, and
others) are more flexible and subject to in/del events that
are selected against in the majority of all other proteincoding genes in the mammalian genomes. The hydrophobic repeat elements that comprise the insertion elements
are likely to play a role in diversifying the repertoire of the
interaction domain of the elastin protein in each species.

Methods
A list of sequences used in this study is provided in Table
1. The multi-species genomic sequences were generated as
part of the NISC Comparative Sequencing Program ([36];
http://www.nisc.nih.gov; 2003 freeze). The human ELN
gene structure was taken from [16]. Alternative splicing in
human ELN is documented in GenBank reference
XP_004897.2 and PIR entry EAHU.
Alignment of genomic sequences was performed using the
PipMaker and MultiPipMaker servers running the blastz
alignment program ([21]). The comparisons were computed as local alignments using the default parameters of
the program [21]. Pair-wise cDNA and protein comparisons used the global alignment program ALIGN, available
at EBI, to calculate a percent identity and similarity. Ratio
of gaps per coding region was computed using whole
genome human-mouse alignments with blastz program
[21].
The exon numbers for the ELN gene correspond to those
of the human cDNA sequence in [16]. Exons that are
absent in humans but present in other species are numbered and lettered consecutively (i.e., the last exon in
bovine ELN is 36 and corresponds to human exon 34; see

supplementary Table A). An additional exon is shared
between the mouse mRNA sequence (NM_007925, [37])
and the rat mRNA (M60647, [38]) (see Figure 1). Calculations of mouse-rat similarity in coding sequences used
data from reciprocal best matches available from the
Homologene database.

Because of the low exon/intron ratio, automated gene prediction fails to find many exons in the ELN gene. In this
study, exons were identified by homology at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, and around the putative
splice sites [16]. Translated amino acid sequences were
aligned using ClustalX [39], and then manually adjusted
to preserve the exon correspondence among species.
Nucleotide sequences from the corresponding coding
regions were then aligned according to the amino acid
alignment using the program BioEdit (T. Hall). The shading of the amino acid alignment that reflects chemical
properties of amino acids (Figure 1) was performed using
the program GeneDoc (Nicholas K.B. and Nicholas H.B.
Jr.).
The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) were estimated
using the Li-Wu-Luo method [25], as implemented in the
program MEGA2 [40].
