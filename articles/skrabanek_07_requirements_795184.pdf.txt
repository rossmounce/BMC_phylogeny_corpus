Abstract
Background: G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are a large and diverse family of membrane
proteins whose members participate in the regulation of most cellular and physiological processes
and therefore represent key pharmacological targets. Although several bioinformatics resources
support research on GPCRs, most of these have been designed based on the traditional assumption
that monomeric GPCRs constitute the functional receptor unit. The increase in the frequency and
number of reports about GPCR dimerization/oligomerization and the implication of
oligomerization in receptor function makes necessary the ability to store and access information
about GPCR dimers/oligomers electronically.
Results: We present here the requirements and ontology (the information scheme to describe
oligomers and associated concepts and their relationships) for an information system that can
manage the elements of information needed to describe comprehensively the phenomena of both
homo- and hetero-oligomerization of GPCRs. The comprehensive information management

scheme that we plan to use for the development of an intuitive and user-friendly GPCROligomerization Knowledge Base (GPCR-OKB) is the result of a community dialog involving
experimental and computational colleagues working on GPCRs.
Conclusion: Our long term goal is to disseminate to the scientific community organized, curated,
and detailed information about GPCR dimerization/oligomerization and its related structural
context. This information will be reported as close to the data as possible so the user can make his
own judgment on the conclusions drawn for a particular study. The requirements and ontology
described here will facilitate the development of future information systems for GPCR oligomers
that contain both computational and experimental information about GPCR oligomerization. This
information is freely accessible at http://www.gpcr-okb.org.

Background
G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are among the
largest and most diverse protein families in mammalian
genomes, and constitute the largest single family of therapeutic targets for drug treatment. They are integral membrane proteins with a central common core made of seven
transmembrane helices connected by intracellular and
extracellular loops (Figure 1). The primary function of
GPCRs is to transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular signals through G-protein dependent and independent
pathways.
The traditional view of GPCR function had focused on the
assumption that monomeric receptors participated in ligand binding and signal transduction processes (Figure
1a). Specifically, a single ligand was assumed to activate a
single receptor by producing a conformational change in
the receptor that would induce activation of a G protein or
effector. Although it is well accepted that a monomeric
GPCR can activate heterotrimeric G-proteins, the view
that they function only as monomers in cells has recently
been challenged by the discovery that numerous GPCRs

Figure 1
Traditional and current views of GPCR signaling
Traditional and current views of GPCR signaling. The
traditional view of GPCR signaling assumed that monomeric
receptors participated in ligand binding and signal transduction. The current view suggests that GPCRs may form homoand/or hetero-oligomers, and that ligand(s) binding to one or
more receptors may activate neighboring receptors in the
oligomeric complex.

form homo- and/or hetero-oligomers (Figure 1b). Functional crosstalk between protomers in a dimeric or oligomeric complex has been described, and it is possible that
ligand binding to one or more receptors may activate
neighboring receptors in an oligomeric complex, giving
rise to a cascade of interconnected signaling events.
The physiological relevance of GPCR oligomerization is
largely accepted nowadays, especially in light of the discovered functional implications of GPCR association that
include pharmacological diversity, G-protein coupling
specificity, downstream signaling amplification or attenuation, and/or internalization (see [1-9] for recent
reviews). This growing amount of information and its
required incorporation into physiologically relevant functional models of GPCRs encourages the development of a
publicly accessible repository of information focused on
GPCR homo- and hetero-oligomers.
Currently available bioinformatics tools for data storage
devoted to GPCRs have been designed with a strong
emphasis on receptor monomers. For example, information repositories such as GPCRDB [10] and tGRAP [11]
include sequence data, alignments of monomers, 2D visualization of monomer units, and mutation information
for receptor mutants. The NC-IUPHAR (The International
Pharmacology Committee on Receptor Nomenclature
and Classification) database on GPCR nomenclature and
drug classification [12] includes the most commonly
studied GPCRs with a particular focus on information
about their pharmacological and functional properties,
and their function, and localization in vivo. These information systems have proven extremely useful to support
structural and functional studies of GPCRs, as shown by
their strong user base. For instance, GPCRDB has established itself as a central repository for GPCR information
with peak access at some 100,000 requests per month
[10]. Information systems such as GPCRDB provide users
with a unified view of information in a given field (or for
a class of molecules), and constitute frequently updated
resources that support structured queries and provide
advanced visualizations.

Given that physiologically relevant functional models of
GPCRs must incorporate GPCR homo- and/or hetero-oligomeric constructs, the explosion of information about
GPCR oligomerization makes this an opportune time for
the development of a web-based information system that
specifically a) stores computational and experimental
information about GPCR oligomerization, and b) allows
browsing, visualization and structured querying of its contents. Such a system would foster and support productive
and quantitative communication and collaboration
between computational and experimental scientists, but is
not currently available in any form. To best serve the
broad GPCR community by providing a comprehensive
and reliable (data-driven, rather than interpretationdriven) GPCR oligomerization information system, it is
important that opinions from GPCR experts in both
experimental and computational fields are given due consideration. This manuscript describes the result of a community dialog we initiated to identify the requirements
for a comprehensive GPCR oligomerization information
system and to design an ontology (information scheme)
to represent such information. The GPCR oligomerization
ontology that we present here is a formal description of
the information concepts required to describe GPCR oligomerization and of the relationships between these concepts. As such, this ontology allows the organization of
information in a formal way, a prerequisite to supporting
many of the requirements that potential users identified
for the future GPCR oligomerization information system
(see Information System Requirements below).

Results
An information system devoted to homo- and hetero-oligomers of GPCRs requires the capability to store, and
allow browsing, visualization and structured querying of
a specialized set of heterogeneous data. To facilitate the
implementation of a comprehensive information system
focused on GPCR oligomerization, it is important to
make informed decisions about the specific usages the
information system will support and what type of information must be stored and queried. Thus, in a first step
towards developing such a system, we have obtained system requirements – a list of features essential to the finished information system – from experts in the GPCR
oligomerization field, and have developed an ontology to
represent the results of GPCR oligomerization studies
(both experimental and computational). The system
requirements and ontology constitute a comprehensive
information management scheme for a GPCR oligomerization information system and can be used to guide the
fine design and implementation of such a system.
Throughout the ontology and this manuscript we define
the word 'protomer' to refer to a protein which is a constituent part of an oligomer. In contrast, we reserve the word
'monomer' for stand-alone GPCR proteins.

Information system requirements
In the following sections, we report the system requirements that have been identified for a comprehensive
GPCR oligomerization information system. Each requirement describes a high-level feature that an information
system for GPCR oligomers must include to be useful, and
explains how this feature will support studies of GPCR oligomers.
1. Providing an electronic repository of both experimental and
computational information about GPCR oligomers
The repository will complement the scientific literature by
offering a unified view of the data and/or conclusions
published in different articles. One of the most daunting
obstacles encountered when directly searching the literature is the existence of varying monomer/oligomer naming schemes or different residue numbering conventions.
This makes it extremely difficult to locate articles of interest using current text searching methods. A useful GPCR
oligomerization information system should make it possible to bypass this problem by supporting the creation of
unified views by aggregating data along different axes. In
an information system for GPCR oligomers, aggregation
could be done at the level of the oligomer or structural
domain, so that obtaining the list of small molecules that
were shown to bind an oligomer would be possible even
if the information was originally published in five articles
where the same oligomer was referred to by three different
names. The GPCR oligomerization information system
should therefore eliminate the common problems
encountered when searching the literature with current
text searching methods. A GPCR information system
should also provide links to the primary literature for each
fact or interpretation offered.

Native oligomeric complexes of GPCRs that satisfy any or
all of the rules recently stipulated by NC-IUPHAR [13]
should and will be properly highlighted.
2. Linking and complementing existing GPCR resources that provide
information about GPCR monomers
There is a rich compendium of established and experimental bioinformatics resources designed to support
GPCR research (e.g., GPCRDB [14], tGRAP [11],
GPCRIPDB [15], NC-IUPHAR [12], Arcadia [16]). A
GPCR oligomerization information system should not
duplicate existing monomer resources, but rather should
focus on interfacing with these resources to import data or
to link to them to relate oligomer-specific data to known
facts about their constituent protomers. This information
is needed to reveal possible changes in the structure-function relations of a specific GPCR oligomer compared to its
monomeric forms. Information available about the monomers found in existing resources includes but is not limited to: transmembrane (TM) helical boundaries,

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:177

sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, predictions of
solvent accessibility of TM residues, snake-like diagrams,
three-dimensional (3D) molecular models, Protein Data
Bank (PDB) files associated with GPCRs, point mutations,
GPCR interacting partners, GPCR cDNAs, chromosomal
locations, and ligand-binding constants. Similarly, a
GPCR oligomerization information system should provide the capability for others to define links to data entries
in the information system. For instance, in the systems to
which GPCRDB links, this requirement is fulfilled when
linked resources export a catalog of the internal and external accession codes for each data item that they contain.
Developments at GPCRDB, such as the creation of web
services, will facilitate this integration with GPCR-OKB.
3. Providing information about the experimental details of the
method used in published studies of GPCR oligomers
A variety of experimental procedures and systems has
been used to study GPCR oligomers. A comprehensive
information system involving GPCR oligomers should
include information about: i) the experimental procedure
used to characterize the oligomer, e.g., Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET), Time Resolved FRET (TRFRET), cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, co-expression of fragments or modified protomers, Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), or use of dimer-specific antibodies
(for a complete review see [17]); ii) the biological system
studied, e.g., native tissue/transfected cells; and iii) the
evidence available for cross-modulation of ligand binding, activation, internalization, e.g., see [18,19]. The user
should be able to search for single or multiple experimental details, in order to identify the multimeric complexes
that have been studied under specified conditions. Knowledge of experimental details used in published studies of
GPCR oligomers will allow users to have a better understanding of the corresponding results. In addition, it will
assist the user in the design of directed pharmacological
and physiological experiments for the specific multimeric
system under study.
4. Providing experimental and computational results rather than
interpretation of those data
Scientific publications contain descriptions of experimental results and of the methods used to produce them. In
contrast, it is not unusual for the interpretation of the data
presented in a manuscript to be challenged in follow-up
publications, as more experimental data become available. Because various interpretations of the data are often
the object of debate until a consensus is reached, the
information system will be most helpful if it stores the
experimental data. In the case of conflicting data, all
experimental results will be reported, with the appropriate
reference.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/177

5. Providing information about the specific residues at oligomeric
interfaces established or predicted by experimental and/or
computational approaches
A detailed information system about GPCR oligomers
should include information about the experimental
method (e.g., cross-linking [1] or site-directed mutagenesis) or computational procedure (e.g., evolutionary trace
(ET) method, correlated mutation analysis (CMA), subtractive correlated mutation (SCM), etc.) used to determine/predict dimerization/oligomerization interfaces
[20]. Availability of information about the composition
of the interfaces of dimerization/oligomerization will
facilitate an understanding of the nature of the interaction
between GPCR subunits. This information is essential to
the design of oligomerization-disrupting mutants directed
towards modulating GPCR function. Interface residues
should be identified both by the absolute sequence numbering and by a GPCR generic numbering system, which
makes it possible to refer, comparatively, to structurally
cognate GPCRs. For family A GPCRs, this generic numbering system consists of assigning each helix residue a
number relative to that of the most conserved residue in
each transmembrane helix, which is arbitrarily assigned
the number 50 [21]. Different sets of index residues are
selected for other GPCR families, i.e., family C GPCRs
[22]. As generic numbering systems for other families are
proposed, they will be incorporated.
6. Providing structural information about physiological GPCR
oligomers
Information about the particular experimental method
used to obtain the structural information (e.g., X-ray diffraction in the case of the extracellular domain of members of family C GPCRs) and/or the specific type of
modeling procedure (e.g., distance-based modeling in the
case of rhodopsin) should be stored and detailed as completely as possible. Results from several computational
techniques, including molecular dynamics simulations
[23], should also be considered for storage as they are
expected to help rationalize possible dynamic mechanisms of GPCR oligomers and suggest potential ways of
modifying receptor function.
7. Providing information about potential mechanisms of activation of
GPCR oligomers
The user should receive detailed information when available about i) activated protomer(s) within the oligomer;
ii) the activating ligands; iii) single or multiple occupancy
of binding sites; iv) types of conformational change
within each protomer; v) symmetric/asymmetric functioning; vi) cis- or trans-activation; vii) possible structural
rearrangement at the interface upon activation; viii)
GPCR-G-protein stoichiometry. Although most of this
information derives from paradigms of G proteindependent signaling, inferences from G-protein inde-

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:177

pendent pathways will also be incorporated as more
detailed information becomes available.
8. Providing detailed information about functional roles of GPCR
oligomers
The user will find beneficial the following information: i)
role of oligomerization in maturation and cell-surface
delivery; ii) ligand regulation (and characterization of the
ligand as agonist or antagonist); iii) cross-modulation of
signaling/binding; iv) negative/positive cooperativity; v)
attenuation/potentiation of signaling in G proteindependent and independent pathways; vi) G-protein specificity; vii) internalization (for a recent review see [2]). By
searching for single or multiple functional details, the user
should easily identify the multimeric complexes that satisfy such criteria.
9. Linking to novel compounds that are proposed to selectively target
GPCR oligomers
Recent evidence for compounds that can selectively activate hetero-oligomers but not homo-oligomers suggests
that GPCR hetero-oligomers can be used as models in the
development of new therapies [24], as well as in the
design of new drugs with reduced side effects [8,25,26].
Therefore, the user will find helpful a connection between
the detailed information available for these multimeric
systems and the compounds they are purported to recognize and bind. To this end, the information system should
link to databases (e.g., PubChem [27]) that contain information about the chemical and structural features of both
synthetic and natural compounds, as well as their vendor
identifier if available. Antibodies that selectively target
GPCR oligomers will also be included in the information
system.
10. Providing information about the physiological relevance of GPCR
oligomers
One of the main requirements for the recognition and
acceptance of GPCRs multimeric receptors recently
defined by NC-IUPHAR [13] is a firm demonstration of
the actual physiological relevance of those oligomeric
complexes/receptors. This is especially important in the
case of hetero-oligomers, for which most of the results
come from heterologous cellular systems where two different GPCRs are co-expressed simultaneously. Therefore,
information concerning co-localization studies in native
tissues, in vivo effects of hetero-oligomer specific ligands
as well as reported in vivo phenotypical changes (e.g.,
pharmacological response or cooperativity) in knock-out
animals should be available to the user.
A comprehensive ontology for the study of GPCR
oligomers
The requirements presented in the previous section call
for the management of various types of information

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/177

about the oligomers, their structural domains, or their
binding ligands. Because each of these information types
relates to one or more other information types, and
because the relationship between such types can become
complex, it is necessary to specify precisely the information type relationships that the information system will
support. To achieve this, we have created a formal ontology for a comprehensive GPCR oligomerization information system currently under development in our
laboratories. The term ontology is commonly used in bioinformatics to denote various types of ways to organize
biological information (from the directed acyclic graph of
the "Gene Ontology" to frame-based systems). Here, we
consider that an ontology is the result of making choices
to represent a specific aspect of reality, e.g., a biological
entity such as a GPCR oligomer within an information
system, database, or knowledge representation system, in
order to make it amenable to certain types of computations (we therefore follow the definition of an ontology
given in [28]). Choices are necessary to simplify the representation so that it only maintains the attributes needed
for the type of computational use planned. From the use
case scenarios and system requirements obtained as a
result of an interdisciplinary effort, we have incorporated
the elements of information that are required to describe
sufficiently the phenomena of GPCR homo- and heterooligomerization, and also how these elements of information combine to form a system that will serve the targeted
users. The ontology is a crucial component of the information management scheme for an information system
because it formally specifies what can be stored in such a
system and what types of computations can be performed
with the stored material. The rest of this section describes
in detail the ontology developed for a comprehensive
GPCR oligomerization information system. The full
ontology is depicted in Figures 2, 3, and 4, and is available
in OWL format from the project web site [29]. A specific
example is illustrated in Figure 5.
1. Ontology primer
1.1 The Oligomer concept
The Oligomer concept is central to the GPCR-OKB, and
we use it here to define the conventions followed in the
rest of this manuscript. Figure 2 shows the Oligomer concept with its connections to other concepts of the ontology. In this manuscript, all graphical representations of
the ontology follow the UML conventions [30]. Briefly,
concepts are depicted by rectangular boxes with their corresponding names reported in the top portion of the box.
Open-ended arrows from one concept to another indicate
that the destination concept is more general than the
source concept (those arrows can be read: 'source "is a"
destination'). Other arrows indicate relationships
between concepts. Attributes of a concept are reported
within each concept box. Attributes conventionally begin

Figure 2
UML diagram of the Oligomer concept and related concepts
UML diagram of the Oligomer concept and related concepts. Each concept is shown as a box, and is named in the top
section of the box. All attributes for each concept are listed in the middle section of the box. Arrows represent relationships
between concepts, and open-ended arrows indicate "is a" relationships. The relationship of one concept to another is indicated
by the text on each arrow. Arrows with [0..*] (zero or more) or [1..*] (one or more) indicate the number of instances of the
concept at the end of the arrow that is associated with the concept at the beginning of the arrow. The Oligomer concept is
central to the GPCR oligomerization ontology and all other concepts in the ontology relate to it either directly (e.g., Oligomer
''is described by'' IdentificationStudy) or indirectly (e.g., Oligomer ''is composed of'' one or more [1..*] Protein that ''belongs
to'' Family).

UML diagram of modeling-related concepts. Structural models of Oligomers are represented in the GPCR oligomerization ontology by a MolecularStructure concept. Each MolecularStructure is created with an instance of MethodType, and may
be analyzed by many computational methods (instances of Analysis). MethodType has two subclasses: IdentificationMethod,
which is used to identify the oligomer, and CreationMethod, which is used to create the MolecularStructure. IdentificationMethod and CreationMethod can have many sub-concepts that describe the precise type of method. In this figure we show
only a few examples of such concepts.

Figure 4
UML diagram of concepts related to oligomerization-induced phenotype changes
UML diagram of concepts related to oligomerization-induced phenotype changes. The GPCR oligomerization
ontology focuses on changes in the phenotype that occur when GPCR protomers oligomerize. There are three types of phenotypic change that are described by the ontology: changes in internalization, changes in signaling, and differences in the ligand
binding of the oligomer as compared to any of the constituent protomers. The effect that ligand(s) binding to one or more of
the protomers in an oligomer may have on binding of ligands to other protomers, or on the change in signaling, is described by
the CrossTalk concept. The Internalization concept is used to describe changes that different ligands have on the trafficking of
the Oligomer to the cell membrane. Any information that is available about the mechanism of activation of the Oligomer is
stored in the MechanismOfActivation concept. The PhysiologicalRelevance concept stores information about the Oligomer in
vivo.

UML diagram of the oligomerization-induced cooperativity effects in HEK-293 cells co-expressing μ-opioid and
δ-opioid receptors. The attribute bindingXTalk compiles any information related to changes in the affinity of the ligandUnderTest (DAMGO) in the presence of another ligand (e.g., TIPP Ψ, deltorphin II, SNC80, or DPDPE). Treatment of HEK-293 cells
with the selective δ-opioid ligand TIPP Ψ results in increased binding of the μ-opioid agonist DAMGO (see CrossTalk1).
Among the δ-opioid selective agonists SNC 80, DPDPE or deltorphin II, only the last leads to a significant increase in
DAMGO's binding affinity (see CrossTalk2-4).

with lowercase letters. If the attribute name is made up of
two or more words, the subsequent words are capitalized
to make it easier to understand the name of the attribute.
For example, Figure 2 shows that the Oligomer concept
has an attribute oligomerName of type String that stores the
name of the Oligomer. The Oligomer concept also has a
protomers attribute that lists the specific protein types that
form the oligomer. The ontology does not track the exact
stoichiometric subunit composition of oligomers because
most of the time this information is not known. Instead
the ontology records what types of GPCRs are known or
predicted to participate in that instance of Oligomer. For
instance, to indicate that the δ-opioid receptor is predicted
to oligomerize with the μ-opioid receptor, an instance of
the Oligomer concept is created with a protomers attribute
that references these two GPCRs. The protomers attribute is
of type Collection<Protein>, a notation that indicates that
this attribute can contain a number of instances of the
Protein concept. The number of Protein instances that can
participate in the relation defined by the protomers
attribute is specified on the arrow from Oligomer to Protein. This is an example of an association between one
concept and another, where one concept can have multiple instances of the other concept. In a UML diagram,
such multiplicities of association are indicated at the start
of the arrow between the two concepts. In this case, the
notation 1..* indicates that an instance of Oligomer may
have one or more Protein instances in its attribute protomers, where the 1 indicates that an Oligomer must have at
least one Protein associated with it, and the * indicates
that there can be more than one Proteins associated with
the Oligomer. Similarly, it is possible (for example in the
association from Protein to Oligomer), that a Protein may
not be a part of any Oligomer at all, or may be a component of many different Oligomers. In this case, the notation reads 0..* (see Figure 2).
1.2 ExternalReference
Similarly to the protomers attribute, the literatureReferences
attribute indicates that each instance of the Oligomer concept is associated with one or more (1..*) ExternalReference instances. The literatureReferences attribute allows
citations and other outside references to be attached to a
particular Oligomer instance. The ExternalReference concept performs this function because its three attributes
(externalID, resourceType and otherReferenceInfo) allow the
identification of published material and external database
links associated with that Oligomer instance. For example, an ExternalReference instance whose attributes are
{externalID = 10926528, resourceType = PubMed and otherReferenceInfo = ""} refers to an article in PubMed whose
primary identifier is 10926528. This information is sufficient to identify the article describing the crystal structure
of rhodopsin [31]. Articles that are not indexed in
PubMed can also be referenced. A reference to this same

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/177

article can also be constructed by using a DOI resource
type: {externalID = 10.1126/science.289.5480.739,
resourceType = DOI and otherReferenceInfo = ""} [32]. The
ExternalReference concept thus allows the cross-linking to
any piece of information that is available online and is in
the public domain. Other types of references that are not
accessible through the above mechanism can be cited
using the otherReferenceInfo attribute.
1.3 TrackedEntity
The TrackedEntity concept shown in Figure 2 provides an
internal identifier that allows other systems to link to data
entries in the information system. Each concept of the
GPCR-OKB ontology that other systems could find useful
to link to (e.g., Oligomer, Protein, Family, Ligand and
IdentificationStudy in Figure 2) inherits the identifier
attribute by extending the TrackedEntity concept. In Figure 2, this is shown graphically either with the openended arrow "is a" relation, or by the <<TrackedEntity>>
special tag. The TrackedEntity concept can be extended
with attributes to track accession codes over time and revision information.
2. Molecules
In Figure 2, the concepts Oligomer, Ligand and Protein
represent molecules. The Oligomer concept is defined by
the following attributes: oligomerName, protomers, studies,
literatureReferences, rules, mechanismsOfActivation, isFormedInER, physiologicalRelevance, and structuralModels. The
attributes oligomerName, protomers, and literatureReferences
have already been described in the previous section. Other
attributes of the Oligomer concept are described below.
2.1 Oligomer
The attribute rules stores information on whether the Oligomer conforms to the list of recommendations recently
stipulated by the NC-IUPHAR subcommittee for the recognition and nomenclature of GPCR multimers
(described in [13]). The concept NciupharRules, also
shown in Figure 2, indicates which of the NC-IUPHAR
rules the given Oligomer satisfies. These rules, which
ensure the existence of an oligomer, are: 1) evidence of
physical association; 2) identification of a specific oligomeric function; and 3) evidence for the existence of the
oligomer in vivo. Each of the three rules has an attribute
associated with it. Each attribute is of a boolean type,
meaning that it can either be TRUE or FALSE.

Oligomers may be assembled either in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and then exported to the cell membrane,
or the individual protomers that form the oligomer may
be exported separately to the cell membrane and the oligomer be assembled there. The attribute isFormedInER
refers to the formation of the oligomer in the ER. A prototypical example of an oligomer formed in the ER, and sub-

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:177

sequently exported to the membrane (receptor
maturation/ontogeny) is the heterodimeric γ-aminobutiric acid GABAB receptor. In fact, subunit GABAB1 is usually retained in the ER, and only its dimerization with
subunit GABAB2 allows for the export of the functional
heterodimer to the plasma cell membrane [33-35]. Similar behavior has recently been described for some members of the class A GPCRs such as αB and αD-adrenergic
receptors heterodimers [36], vasopressin V1a, V2, and the
oxytocin receptors homo- and heterodimers [2], C5a
homodimers [37], and others. Thus, for these oligomers,
the isFormedInER attribute is TRUE. When new techniques
become available that allow the unambiguous verification of export to the cell membrane, then such data will
also be included in the information system.
Other attributes of the Oligomer concept, such as studies,
mechanismsOfActivation
and
physiologicalRelevance,
describe more detailed information related to the oligomer; any structural information available for the oligomer is detailed in the attribute structuralModels. These
information concepts are depicted in Figures 3 and 4 and
will be discussed in the following sections.
2.2 Ligand
In Figure 2, the Ligand concept refers to any molecule that
binds to a receptor (e.g., small molecules or peptides).
Ligands have a name meant for display in the user interface (ligandName), and a collection of external references
(databaseReferences). These references make it possible for
users to follow links to databases where the small molecule, peptide, or protein ligand is described in detail (e.g.,
PubChem [38]). We can also represent novel compounds
by their canonical SMILES representation (smilesStructure). An introduction to canonical SMILES is provided by
[39].
2.3 Protein
The Protein concept represents individual protein chains
or protomeric units, defined by the attribute proteinName.
The organism attribute stores the Latin names for the
source organism. A more detailed description of the Protein is stored in the description attribute. The databaseReferences attribute of protein makes it possible to nonambiguously identify the protein in external databases.
The oligomers attribute lists the Oligomers in which the
protein participates. The attribute tmTopology defines the
location of the transmembrane segments (TM) used when
determining the generic numbering attributes (see
below), and also supports creating snake-like plots of the
oligomerization interface where interacting residues are
highlighted [40]. Each TM is encoded by an instance of
SecondaryStructureElement (see below). Protein is further
qualified with the most specific GPCR family to which it
belongs (see below). Note that we use the term 'family' for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/177

any set of related proteins on a number of different levels
which include super-families, families and classes of proteins. This simplification makes it possible to re-use the
same ontology concept (called 'Family') for all levels of
hierarchy.
2.4 SecondaryStructureElement
This concept stores information about each individual
secondary structure element in a GPCR protein, such as
helices. The helical boundaries for family A GPCRs are
based on the alignment with the rhodopsin crystal structure. Helical boundaries for all other families of proteins
will be defined by secondary structure predictions and
hydropathy profiles. Its attributes include startPosition
(the absolute position in the protein where the element
starts), endPosition (the absolute numbering of the end of
the element) and elementName (the conventional name
given to the secondary structure element. For example, the
third transmembrane segment of the bovine μ-opioid
receptor would be stored as startPosition = 107, endPosition
= 139 and elementName = TM3.
2.5 Family
The Family concept supports a typical hierarchical organization of protein families (parent and children attributes).
For instance, the opioid receptor family has three children
(= opioid receptor type D, opioid receptor type K, and opioid receptor type M). The opioid receptor type D family
then has one parent (= opioid) and one child (= δ-opioid
receptor). The name of the family is stored in familyName,
and the proteins that comprise the family are stored in
memberProteins. Any references in online databases to this
family are stored in databaseReferences.
3. Studies of oligomer and interface identification
3.1 IdentificationStudy
The IdentificationStudy concept describes the studies and
methods that led to the identification of an oligomer or
the interacting structural domains of the protomers at the
oligomeric interface. The methodType attribute describes
the type of method used in the study and is described in
more detail in the following section. The phenotype
attribute indicates if any phenotypic changes were
observed in the referenced study. (The concept PhenotypicChange is described in detail in Figure 4 and is discussed
below). The literatureReferences attribute lists one or more
publications describing each particular study. When the
cell type in which the identification has been carried out
is known, it is represented by the cellType attribute, which
is encoded by the Cell Ontology [41]. When available, the
attributes interfaceDiscovered and residuesFound indicate
the parts of the protomers that have been found to interact
in the Oligomer in the given study (see below). A prototypical example of the attribute interfaceDiscovered is
offered by rhodopsin dimers [42]. Specifically, based on

Page 11 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:177

the AFM-based atomic model of rhodopsin dimers (MethodType = AFM, literatureReferences = [43]) the intradimeric
contacts have been described as involving TM4 and TM5
[42] (interfaceDiscovered = {TM4, TM5}, where TM4 and
TM5 are stored as instances of SecondaryStructureElement
in the composedOf attribute of InteractionDomain,
described below). Of note, a recent crystal structure of a
photoactivated deprotonated intermediate of bovine rhodopsin has shown TM1 as an alternative dimerization
interface [44]. The IdentificationStudy concept also
includes a measurements attribute, which records how various experimental measurements obtained in the study
are affected by treatment with ligands (see LigandEffectOnMeasurement, below). This attribute stores the effect
of ligands on the experimental measurements performed
in the study (see below, and Figure 4).
3.2 InteractionDomain
The InteractionDomain concept groups functionally or
topologically related sets of residues that may or may not
be adjacent in sequence. Other InteractionDomain concept attributes include domainName (e.g., extracellular,
intracellular, transmembrane), and the protomer attribute
that indicates what protein the defined interaction
domain belongs to. If the domain can be mapped to
defined secondary structure elements of the protomer,
this information is stored in the composedOf attribute. For
example, an InteractionDomain with domainName =
extracellular would include four SecondaryStructureElements in the composedOf attribute, where the elementName
would be N-term, EC1, EC2 and EC3, respectively. In the
above example of rhodopsin dimers, there would be one
InteractionDomain instance defined: with protomer = rhodopsin, domainName = TM4_5, and two instances of SecondaryStructureElement in the composedOf attribute, one
with elementName = TM4, the other with elementName =
TM5. The interactingResidues attribute is used in cases
where it is known which residues in a domain interact at
the interface (see below).
3.3 Residue
Information on the residues that are involved in the interaction at the interface is limited. To accommodate cases
where this information is known we have included a Residue concept. The Residue concept represents a single residue. Similarly to the InteractionDomain concept, the
protomer attribute of the Residue concept indicates to
which protein the residue belongs, since a residue at the
dimerization interface may belong to any of the protomers of the Oligomer. The protomer attribute for the various
residues of a particular interface would be the same protein for homodimers, and either A or B for heterodimers.
The position attribute is the absolute position of the residue in the protomer sequence, residueCode is the one letter
code for the residue, and tmIndex and residueIndex support

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/177

the generic numbering system described in [21,22]. For
instance, in the case of the dopamine D2 receptor,
cysteine cross-linking studies have identified specific residues of TM4 at the interface of dopamine D2 receptor
homodimers. One of these residues is Cys1684.58 at the
extracellular end of TM4. Thus, this information can be
represented as follows in the ontology: MethodType =
Cross-linking, interfaceDiscovered = InteractionDomain:domainName = TM4, residuesFound = Cys1684.58, literatureReferences [45]). In the Residue concept, residue
Cys1684.58 would be represented by protomer = dopamine
D2, residueCode = C, position = 168, tmIndex = 4 and residueIndex = 58.
3.4 MethodType
The MethodType concept has three attributes: methodName, explanation and isComputational. The attribute methodName stores the abbreviation or common name of the
method; the explanation attribute stores the description of
that method. The attribute isComputational refers to
whether the method is computational or experimental.
The concept MethodType is further subdivided into CreationMethod and IdentificationMethod (see Figure 3).
IdentificationMethod stores any method used to identify
the existence of an oligomer. CreationMethod stores any
method that can guide the prediction of the oligomeric
interface leading to a 3D model of the complex. For example, a subclass of the IdentificationMethod concept
describing the experimental method coimmunoprecipitation would have methodName = COIP, explanation = coimmunoprecipitation and isComputational = FALSE. Another
subclass to be considered may be FRET (also shown as an
example in Figure 3). The CreationMethod concept
includes, but is not limited to, experimental or computational techniques such as AFM, and CMA (see Figure 3).
Methods such as cross-linking can be considered to be
examples of both CreationMethod and IdentificationMethod.
3.5 LigandEffectOnMeasurement
Treating an oligomer with a ligand can change the intensity of a measured signal (i.e., amount of co-immunoprecipitation,
BRET
signal,
etc.).
The
concept
LigandEffectOnMeasurement encodes this information
for each ligand tested in a study (the type of measurement
tested is specified in the IdentificationStudy instance that
refers to this measurement). This concept includes three
attributes: ligandUnderTest, measuredEffect and phenotypicChange. The attribute ligandUnderTest stores the ligand
used for treatment. The attribute measuredEffect stores how
the measured signal changes upon ligand treatment
(INCREASED,
DECREASED,
UNCHANGED,
NOT_TESTED). If there was also a phenotypic change
recorded with this ligand (relative to any of the component protomers), this change would be stored in the phe-

Page 12 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:177

notypicChange attribute (see Section 6 for details). For
example, four instances of LigandEffectOnMeasurement
would be used to encode the BRET measurements made
on cholecystokinin (CCK) type A receptor in an experiment carried out by Cheng et al. [46], where the carboxylterminal was tagged with Renilla luciferase or yellow fluorescent protein. In the presence of the two agonist ligands CCK and gastrin-4 (= ligandUnderTest), the signal
was observed to be reduced and the measuredEffect in both
cases would be stored as DECREASED. In the presence of
the partial agonist [CCK-26-32]-O-phenylethyl ester
(OPE), the effect was also reduced (although to a lesser
degree). This change would also be stored as measuredEffect = DECREASED. When the antagonist [(D-Trp30)CCK26-32]-O-phenylethyl ester (D-Trp-OPE) was used, the
measuredEffect was UNCHANGED [46].
While a number of published articles have interpreted ligand effects on such measurements as evidence of changes
in oligomerization state, our ontology puts the emphasis
on the storage of experimental results and leaves the interpretation of these results to the end-users of the information.
4. Molecular structures and computational simulations
Figure 3 presents the concepts that encode structural
information and the results of simulation studies on
GPCR oligomers. The structuralModels attribute of Oligomer identifies any type of 3D structural information
that relates to the Oligomer.
4.1 MolecularStructure
Molecular models or experimentally determined structures are encoded as instances of the concept MolecularStructure. The creation attribute of MolecularStructure
describes the protocol followed to create the model, or
indicates the experimental technique used to determine
the structure. Only instances of the CreationMethod subclass of the MethodType concept are used to store information about the methods used to determine a 3D
structure. Examples of instances of the concept MolecularStructure are: a) the different crystal structures of the
extracellular ligand-binding region of the homodimeric
metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 [47,48], b) the
semi-empirical model of mouse rhodopsin oligomers
deduced from AFM studies in native disk membranes
[43], and c) correlated mutation-based models such as the
ones described for opioid receptor [49] or dopamine D2
receptor [45] homodimers. There are two attributes to
store references regarding the MolecularStructure. The
attribute databaseReferences includes references to other
databases with information about this structure while the
literatureReferences stores any articles from the scientific
literature about the structure. Although the two types of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/177

references are represented in the same way in our ontology, it is useful to distinguish the two types.
The predictions attribute stores structural or functional
hypotheses that were derived from the analysis of the
molecular structure. A given molecular structure can be
used in multiple computational analyses, and these are
stored in the analyses attribute. Similarly, several molecular simulation studies (e.g., molecular dynamics, normal
mode analysis, etc.) can be performed on the same structure, and are also listed under the attribute analyses.
Optionally, an images attribute of MolecularStructure (not
included in the ontology) could offer a way to present
users with illustrations of structural information.
4.2 Analysis
The Analysis concept stores information about all computational procedures that have been used to create and to
analyze the 3D molecular structure of the oligomer. It
includes three attributes: technique, programNamesUsed
and literatureReferences. The attribute technique stores the
name of the technique used in the analysis, and programNamesUsed lists the names of the computational packages
that were used in the analysis. Rather than detailing all the
minutiae of the analysis in the ontology, the interested
user will be directed to the journal articles (listed in literatureReferences) that describe the analysis.
5. Mechanism of activation
The concept MechanismOfActivation in Figure 4 allows
the storage of information about mechanistic hypotheses
of oligomeric activation.

Current models of ligand binding and signal transduction
by GPCR dimers can be described as symmetric or asymmetric depending on whether or not both protomers of
the dimer undergo similar or different conformational
changes upon activation. The ligand that is responsible for
the activation mechanism being described in a given
instance of MechanismOfActivation is stored in the activatingLigands attribute. The list of protomers that undergo
a conformational change leading to activation of the oligomer is stored in the activatedProtomers attribute. The
attribute
undergoesInterfaceRearrangement
indicates
whether or not this conformational change is known to
involve domains or residues at the oligomerization interface. A summary of the specific types of structural change
within a protomeric unit will be contained in the attribute
descriptionOfChange (e.g., "TM6 moves away from TM3").
Details will be found in the associated publication, which
information is stored through the attribute literatureReferences. The attribute deducedFromStudies provides information about the computational/experimental studies that
suggested the specific mechanistic hypothesis of activation.

Page 13 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:177

The attribute bindingSiteOccupancy indicates how many
ligand binding sites are occupied in a given GPCR oligomer. The attribute isAsymmetric allows discrimination
between hypotheses of symmetric or asymmetric activation for a given GPCR oligomer. The particular case of
asymmetric activation in which one protomer of a GPCR
dimer is not capable of G-protein coupling, whereas the
other protomer can bind the G-protein but not the ligand
will be denoted by the attribute isTransactivated set to
TRUE. On the other hand, if the ligand-bound protomer
that undergoes a conformational change is also the one
that activates the G-protein, the mechanism of activation
is referred to as cis-activation, and the attribute isCisactivated will be set to TRUE. Both, cis- and trans-activation
attributes are not mutually exclusive and could both be
TRUE. Finally, the stoichiometry of the signaling complex,
i.e., how many GPCRs and G-proteins form a functional
GPCR oligomer, is expressed by use of the attributes numberGPCRs and numberGProteins.
The most unambiguous example of trans-activation has
been described for the GABAB1-GABAB2 heterodimer,
where the ligand-bound subunit (GABAB1) does not
appear to couple to the G-protein, but the other subunit
(GABAB2) within the hetero-dimer can bind the G-protein, but not the ligand [50]. Thus, for the GABAB1GABAB2 heterodimer the attribute isTransactivated would
be set to TRUE. On the other hand, studies of the histamine H1 receptor and α1B-adrenoreceptor homodimers
[51] provide mechanistic hypotheses of cis-activation (i.e.,
the protomer that binds the ligand and undergoes the
conformational change is the same protomer that activates the G-protein). Hence they will be identified by setting isCisactivated = TRUE. Analysis of GABAB chimeric
subunits seems to suggest that in other homodimeric
classes of GPCRs, in which both "subunits" are capable of
binding ligand and signaling to G-protein, both cis- and
trans-activation may take place [50]. In fact, in the case of
the luteinizing hormone receptor dimer the binding of
hormone seems to activate adenylyl cyclase through the
same receptor TM bundle (cis-activation), as well as transactivate through the TM bundle of an adjacent receptor
[52]. Therefore in this example isCisactivated = TRUE and
isTransactivated = TRUE.
A more generic example of asymmetric activation (isAsymmetric = TRUE) is represented by the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) homodimers [53,54]. Using a new class of
synthetic allosteric modulators (information about them
would be contained in the LigandEffectOnMeasurement
concept, see above), recent studies have suggested that
only one heptahelical domain of the mGlu homodimer
can undergo activation. In this case of asymmetric activation, it has also been demonstrated that the binding pockets of both ectodomains of the mGlu homodimer must be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/177

occupied for full activation of the system (bindingSiteOccupancy = 2) [55].
An elegant experimental study of the leukotriene B4
receptor (BLT1) suggests that a functional GPCR complex
is composed of one heterotrimeric G-protein and one
GPCR dimer [56] (numberGPCR = 2; numberGProtein = 1).
Indeed, one protomer only is active in such dimers in the
presence of the G-protein, and this is sufficient for full Gprotein activation (see Damian et al. [57]). Stoichiometry
may become even more complicated in the case of GPCR
oligomers, as recently suggested by Palczewski's lab based
on inferences from AFM studies [58]. As per the specific
conformational changes that BLT1 undergoes, experimental evidence suggests a rearrangement of TM6 [56]. This
information will be stored under descriptionOfChange =
"TM6 rearrangement".
Examples of undergoesInterfaceRearrangement = TRUE have
been reported for the mGluR1 and dopamine D2 receptors. Specifically, crystallographic structures of glutamatebound and unbound forms of mGluR1 [47,48] provide
evidence for the rearrangement of the extracellular
dimeric conformations, which may subsequently induce a
conformational change in the cytoplasmic regions [59].
Finally, cross-linking studies (= deducedFromStudies) of
dopamine D2 receptor in the presence of agonists and
inverse agonists also suggest a conformational rearrangement of the TM4 homodimeric interface upon activation
[60].
6. Phenotypic changes
The phenotype attribute of IdentificationStudy encodes the
change of phenotype associated with oligomerization
(the association observed in the study described by IdentificationStudy). Our ontology only encodes changes in
phenotype that are observed in the presence of different
combinations of GPCRs with their associated ligands [2].
A change occurs if the phenotype of the Oligomer is significantly different from the phenotype of either one of
the protomers (or the homodimers of those protomers)
that participate in the Oligomer. The comparedWith
attribute stores the protomer relative to which the phenotypic changes stored in PhenotypicChange are being compared. Figure 4 shows that the GPCR oligomerization
ontology distinguishes between three types of phenotypic
changes: internalization, ligand binding, and signaling
changes. The PhenotypicChange concept does not include
a literatureReferences attribute since they are already listed
in the IdentificationStudy concept.
6.1 Internalization
The ontology tracks reported changes to internalization of
the oligomer with respect to internalization of the monomer using four attributes: ligandInvolved, readoutProtomer,

Page 14 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:177

boundProtomer and isInternalized. Internalization, trafficking from the cell membrane, is usually observed upon ligand stimulation, and different effects are often observed
with different ligands.
Each tested ligand (attribute ligandInvolved) is associated
with its bound protomer (attribute boundProtomer), and to
the internalization effect observed (isInternalized) on the
protomer being studied (readoutProtomer).
An example of an instance of the Internalization concept
is provided by confocal microscopy studies carried out on
co-expressed sst2A somatostatin receptor and μ-opioid
receptors. Treatment with a sst2A-specific ligand, L779,976, induces the internalization of both the sst2A and
μ-opioid receptors, but treatment with a μ-opioid receptor
specific ligand, [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin
(DAMGO), only induced the internalization of μ-opioid,
not of sst2A. These three results would be stored as 1)
boundProtomer = sst2A, ligandInvolved = L779,976, readoutProtomer = {sst2A, μ-opioid} and isInternalized = TRUE; 2)
boundProtomer = sst2A, ligandInvolved = DAMGO, readoutProtomer = sst2A and isInternalized = FALSE; 3) boundProtomer
= μ-opioid, ligandInvolved
= DAMGO,
readoutProtomer = μ-opioid and isInternalized = TRUE [61].
6.2 Ligand binding
The concept LigandBinding encodes differences in the
binding of a given ligand to the Oligomer with respect to
the protomer. This concept is defined by the following
attributes: a) the ligand tested in the pharmacological
assay (ligandUnderTest), b) the property of ligand action,
indicating whether the ligand is an agonist, partial agonist, antagonist, neutral antagonist or inverse agonist (ligandProperty), c) the protomer (or protomers) that the
ligand is observed to bind (protomersBound), d) the measured change in ligand affinity to the oligomer compared
to the protomer (affinityChange), and e) the presence of
demonstrated ligand binding crosstalk (bindingXTalk) –
see section 6.4. The helper concept MeasuredVariation
records if the affinity was: INCREASED, DECREASED,
NOT CHANGED, or NOT_TESTED.

Results of μ- and δ-opioid receptor co-expression can be
used as an example of the type of information that
attributes of the LigandBinding concept will contain.
Experimental data indicate that the μ-δ opioid oligomeric
complex exhibits a 10-fold lower affinity for both the μselective agonist DAMGO and the δ-selective agonist [DPen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) (comparedWith = μopioid receptor and δ-opioid receptor, respectively) [62].
The information can be represented by two instances of
LigandBinding as follows: 1) ligandUnderTest = DAMGO,
protomersBound = {μ-opioid receptor}, affinityChange =
DECREASED; 2) ligandUnderTest = DPDPE, protomers-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/177

Bound = {δ-opioid receptor}, affinityChange =
DECREASED. On the other hand, endogenous opioid
peptides such as endomorphin-1 (= ligandUnderTest; protomersBound = {μ-opioid}) and Leu-enkephalin (protomersBound = {δ-opioid, μ-opioid}) have enhanced affinity
(affinityChange = INCREASED) for the heteromeric opioid
receptor complex (comparedWith = μ-opioid receptor).
[62].
6.3 Signaling
GPCRs mostly signal through heterotrimeric G proteins
although increasing evidence suggests that GPCRs may
also function in a G-protein-independent manner. In this
section we only refer to classical G protein-dependent signaling pathways, although the ontology can incorporate
information about G protein-independent signaling pathways as well.

GPCR oligomers can signal through different pathways
than a GPCR monomer. The Signaling concept makes it
possible to encode such differences in downstream signal
transduction. Encoding of this concept assumes that a
molecule (in attribute molecule) that belongs to a pathway
(in attribute pathway) downstream of the receptor has
been tested (the type of assay can be described in the
attribute measurementType). The attribute changeInMeasurement records either how the output of the assay differs
from the monomer to the oligomer or the effect that different cross-talk ligands have on specific ligand-mediated
signaling processes (see signalingXtalk attribute below).
For instance, if the levels of cAMP are tested, and the corresponding assay reports that cAMP levels are higher for
the oligomer than for the monomer, then changeInMeasurement will have the value INCREASED. The attribute
activatingLigand records which ligand was used to activate
the receptor. The attribute isDesensitized is used to report
the loss of responsiveness of the protomer to the continuing or increasing dose of activatingLigand. The attribute
isPhosphorylated contains information about whether the
GPCR receptor is phosphorylated or not. Further, the
attribute signalingXTalk indicates if the signal transduction
change corresponds to crosstalk between signaling pathways mediated by the protomers of the Oligomer (see section 6.4). Finally, changes in G-protein specificity are
accounted by the attribute gProteinType. This attribute is
part of the Signaling concept rather than Oligomer as the
G-protein specificity is dependent on the ligand.
For example, in cells co-expressing sst2A and μ-opioid,
addition of L779,976 to the system is able to promote
phosphorylation and desensitization of both receptors,
compared with the μ-opioid receptors expressed alone.
This is stored as comparedWith = μ-opioid, activatingLigand
= L779,976, readoutProtomer = {sst2A, μ-opioid}, isPhosphorylated = TRUE, isDesensitized = TRUE; 2) [61].

Page 15 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:177

An example of possible changes in G-protein specificity
can be illustrated by the effect of agonist stimulation on
co-expressed dopamine D1 and D2 dopamine receptors.
Stimulation results in an increase of intracellular calcium
levels via a signaling pathway not activated by either
receptor alone or when either one of the co-expressed
receptors was activated by a selective agonist. Furthermore, calcium signaling by D1-D2 dopamine receptor coactivation was abolished following treatment with a phospholipase C inhibitor but not with pertussis toxin or
inhibitors of protein kinase A or protein kinase C, indicating coupling to the Gαq pathway. This information would
be stored as molecule = Ca2+, pathway = phospholipase C
dependent pathway, readoutProtomer = {dopamine D1,
dopamine D2}, gProteinType = Gαq [63].
The use of some of the other attributes in Signaling can be
demonstrated using the experiments by Breit et al. on heterologous systems co-expressing sensory neuron-specific
receptors subtype 4 (SNSR-4) and δ-opioid receptors [64].
When these receptors are co-expressed in HEK-293 cells,
each receptor acts as an independent unit. In the heterologous system, the SNSR4 selective bovine adrenal
medulla peptide BAM22 produces similar amounts of
phospholipase C activation as it does in cells expressing
only SNSR4. This is stored as: comparedWith = SNSR4, molecule = phosphoinositol, pathway = phospholipase C,
measurementType = induced accumulation of total phosphoinositols, activatingLigand = BAM22, gProteinType =
Gαq, changeInMeasurement = UNCHANGED.
6.4 CrossTalk
The attributes signalingXTalk and bindingXTalk are used to
describe changes in the affinity or signaling of the ligandA
(i.e., the ligand bound to protomer A of the oligomer,
which should be the same as the value of the attribute ligandUnderTest of the referring instance of LigandBinding,
or ligand in Signaling) in the presence of another ligand
(i.e., a ligand bound to protomer B of the oligomer). The
concept CrossTalk includes attributes that account for the
specific ligands (ligandA and ligandB) and protomers (protomerA and protomerB) involved in changes in affinity
(when referred to LigandBinding or signaling when talking of signalingXtalk) due to crosstalk (changeInProtomerA).

An example of bindingXTalk (sometimes called positive/
negative cooperativity) can be seen in the treatment of
cells or native membranes containing both μ-opioid (=
protomerA) and δ-opioid (= protomerB) receptors [65,66]
with low doses of a selective δ-opioid ligand such as
TIPPΨ (H-Tyr-TicΨ [CH2NH]Phe-Phe-OH) (=ligandB)
produces a two-fold increase in binding affinity (changeInProtomerA = INCREASED) of the μ-opioid agonist
DAMGO (= ligandA). Figure 5 illustrates pictorially this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/177

example together with three other experiments carried out
in the same cell system.
Similarly, for signalingXTalk, in vivo analgesia studies
have shown that pretreatment of mice with the δ-selective
agonist naltrindole NTI lowers the antinociceptive
potency values (ED50) of compounds such as MDAN-19
and MDAN-16 to either δ – or μ-opioid receptors, but has
no effect on MDAN-21 potency [67]. This MDAN (μ-agonist-δ-antagonist) series of bivalent ligands has been
designed by combining pharmacophores from oxymorphone (μ-opioid receptor agonist) and NTI (δ-opioid
receptor antagonist). Thus, this information will be
entered as follows: ligandA = MDAN21, protomerA = μreceptor, ligand B = NTI, protomerB = δ-receptor, changeInProtomerA = UNCHANGED, or MDAN16, protomerA = μreceptor, ligand B = NTI, protomerB = δ-receptor, changeInProtomerA = DECREASED.
7. Physiological relevance
A growing body of evidence refers to the existence of
GPCR oligomers in native tissue. This information is
extremely important as it relates to the physiological relevance of the GPCR oligomer under study. Whether or not
all protomers of an oligomer are identified in the same
cell or within the same subcellular compartments (colocalizationEnvironment) will be indicated by the isColocalized
attribute. Specific functional properties for the GPCR oligomers identified in native tissue (e.g., positive or negative allosteric interaction between the two binding sites of
a GPCR dimer, information about a ligand specific to the
dimer, activation of a specific signaling pathway, or specific internalization or desensitization properties) will be
stored via the inVivoPhenotypicChange attribute. As the use
of knock out animals or RNAi technology may also provide key information on the existence of GPCR oligomers
in vivo, this information will be stored as well using the
geneKnockoutResponse attribute.

The case of GABAB receptors is used here to provide an
example of the physiological information that can be
stored using the attributes described above. For instance,
to indicate that subunits GABAB1 and GABAB2 are co-localized in the brain [34], we will use the attributes isColocalized = TRUE and colocalizationEnvironment = brain. The
deletion of either GABAB1 [68] or GABAB2 [69] in mice
leads to similar phenotypes with no detectable GABAB
responses (=geneKnockoutResponse).

Discussion
As data about GPCR oligomerization accumulate in the
scientific literature, it becomes appropriate to create an
electronic repository to facilitate the browsing, searching
and integration of relevant data. However, the construction of such a resource is not trivial because the resource

Page 16 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:177

should offer information about many various aspects of
GPCR oligomerization and how these aspects interrelate.
To enable the construction of a GPCR oligomerization
information system that is as complete and responsive to
the needs of the GPCR community as possible, we have
gathered the requirements of such a system from experimental and computational experts in the GPCR field.
Based on an interdisciplinary dialog, we have created an
ontology that formalizes information concepts and concept relationships required to store the different aspects of
GPCR oligomerization in an electronic repository. These
concepts are formally defined in the OWL language, a
W3C standard for ontology exchange [70] recognized by
the Open Biomedical Ontologies consortium (OBO)
[71]. Since XML-based exchange formats can be generated
from an ontology (e.g., as is done in the BioPax project
[72]), the GPCR Oligomerization ontology can also support the exchange of data among other GPCR oligomerization-aware systems.
Many ontologies proposed under the OBO consortium
can be reused in a variety of applications (e.g., the Cell
Ontology provides an ontology of cell types useful for a
variety of bioinformatics resources [41] and is re-used in
the ontology described here, as part of the IdentificationStudy concept). However, many successful ontologies
have a more restricted focus, such as the EcoCyc ontology.
The EcoCyc ontology offers a consensual view of how
information about the E. coli metabolic pathways could
be stored electronically [73,74]. The GPCR Oligomerization ontology is similarly necessarily restricted in its focus,
having been designed to make possible the development
of a GPCR oligomerization information system.
Although reusability of the GPCR Oligomerization ontology is likely to be limited, we expect that ideas expressed
in this ontology, for instance about how phenotypic
changes are represented (see below and Figure 4), may be
useful in other fields. Although there are other large-scale
projects underway to define phenotype ontologies (i.e.,
the mammalian phenotype ontology (MPO) [75]), the
phenotypic representation required by the GPCR oligomerization system falls outside of the utility of the
MPO ontology. Specifically, (1) the current focus of MPO
is on phenotype observed at the organ, organism and cell
levels. These phenotypes do not match the pharmacological and signaling phenotypes most often considered in
the GPCR field; (2) MPO models phenotypes, while
reports available in the literature for GPCR oligomers generally characterize phenotypic changes (e.g., the affinity of
ligand X is increased in the oligomer compared to that in
the protomer alone); (3) the tree structure of the MPO
assumes that each phenotype is represented as a distinct
concept of the ontology. Categorizing each distinct phenotype with a different concept of the ontology in this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/177

way does not support computational comparisons of phenotypic changes required by a GPCR oligomerization
information system. For example, obtaining the list of ligands whose binding to the Oligomer is increased when
compared to binding of the same ligand to the protomer
is possible with our ontology, but not with the relations
offered by MPO.
In contrast to the MPO hierarchy of phenotypes, the solution that we retained for the GPCR Oligomerization
ontology models phenotypic changes as concepts which
are endowed with attributes that support explicit comparison and aggregation of phenotypic changes (a phenotypic change that follows this approach is illustrated in
Figure 5). In this respect, the choices made in the GPCR
Oligomerization ontology are driven by the types of computation that we expect an information system will perform with GPCR oligomerization information. Since
protein oligomerization and its impact on downstream
signaling pathways is a regulation and signaling paradigm
that occurs in a variety of non-GPCR systems, we anticipate that our representation of phenotypic changes will be
reusable in other fields, e.g., protein kinases. The phosphorylation of a protein by a protein kinase may change
its enzymatic activity, cellular location or association with
other proteins. The GPCR Oligomerization ontology
models such changes at an intermediate level of detail
which omits mechanistic and precise stoichiometric
details, yet captures the information most useful to scientists who study these regulation mechanisms experimentally.
Although the ontology presented here will continue to
develop as studies of GPCR oligomerization progress, the
version of the GPCR Oligomerization ontology presented
in this manuscript is expected to facilitate the development of future GPCR oligomerization information systems. The information that is entered into systems based
on this ontology can be manually extracted from the literature by expert curators. Because of the possibility of several different interpretations of the primary data presented
in an article, our ontology focuses on primary experimental data that are objective and not subject to interpretation. In addition to primary data, reported oligomeric
complexes of GPCRs that satisfy one or more of the rules
recently specified by NC-IUPHAR will be properly highlighted.
It is worth underscoring that attributes of inference have
been avoided in the construction of this ontology, in
order to offer as objective and neutral information as possible. The user will find always a referenced article or articles for further reading and discussion on the topic of
interest. Our main goal has been to reflect the information
as close to the data as possible so the user can compare

Page 17 of 20

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:177

related studies and make his or her own inferences or
judgments on the conclusions provided by the study or
studies available. For example, in Angers et al., isoproterenol was suggested to induce homodimerization of the β2adrenergic receptor based on inferences from BRET results
[76]. However, further studies with a modified and newer
version of BRET reported that stimulation with the same
agonist did not promote consistent change in the BRET
saturation curves. Thus, the authors concluded that the
dimers form constitutively, and that receptor activation
does not affect their oligomerization state [77]. In this
ontology both examples will be collected as part of identification studies related to β2-adrenergic receptor
homodimers. However, only the increased or unchanged
BRET signal in the presence of that agonist will be
reported, with omission of any inference about oligomer
formation.

oligomers deduced from experiments or computer simulation studies; v) information about potential mechanisms of activation of GPCR oligomers; vi) information
about functional roles of GPCR oligomers and the various
phenotypical changes that occur compared to the individual subunits; vii) novel compounds that are proposed to
selectively target GPCR oligomers; viii) the possible physiological relevance of GPCR oligomers.
The requirements and ontology described in this manuscript will facilitate the development of future GPCR oligomerization information systems that will integrate data
generated by experimental and computational studies of
GPCR oligomerization. The one under current development in our laboratories (GPCR-OKB) will be continually
curated and maintained.

Availability and requirements
The construction of the GPCR Oligomerization ontology
may also lend itself to the possibility of automatically
extracting information that can be directly added to a
database based on that ontology. Curated databases (such
as the one under development in our laboratories) require
curators to read and interpret a manuscript to extract
information that will be added to the database. A more
collaborative strategy could be proposed where structured
information would be embedded in articles in such a way
that the extraction of information can be automated and
will not require human interpretation. The advantage of
this strategy is that the structured information would be
reviewed at the same time as the manuscript and that it
would solve the problem of information extraction from
the literature. The ontology described in this manuscript
would support such a strategy because it is possible to
automatically generate a structured language from an
ontology that could be used to encode information for
embedding in a manuscript. We note that while this strategy is possible, there are still a number of sociological barriers to its widespread use. In the meantime, the GPCROKB ontology presented here will be useful to database
designers and curators who need to manage information
about GPCR oligomerization.

The ontology for GPCR-OKB is available at http://
