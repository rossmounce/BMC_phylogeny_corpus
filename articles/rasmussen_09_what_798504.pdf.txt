Abstract
Background: The declining cost of DNA sequencing is making genome sequencing a feasible
option for more organisms, including many of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists.
While obtaining high-depth, completely assembled genome sequences for most non-model
organisms remains challenging, low-coverage genome survey sequences (GSS) can provide a wealth
of biologically useful information at low cost. Here, using a random pyrosequencing approach, we
sequence the genome of the scuttle fly Megaselia scalaris and evaluate the utility of our lowcoverage GSS approach.
Results: Random pyrosequencing of the M. scalaris genome provided a depth of coverage
(0.05x0.1x) much lower than typical GSS studies. We demonstrate that, even with extremely lowcoverage sequencing, bioinformatics approaches can yield extensive information about functional
and repetitive elements. We also use our GSS data to develop genomic resources such as a nearly
complete mitochondrial genome sequence and microsatellite markers for M. scalaris.
Conclusion: We conclude that low-coverage genome surveys are effective at generating useful
information about organisms currently lacking genomic sequence data.

Background
Next-generation sequencing technologies, such as the 454
(Roche Applied Science) and Solexa (Illumina) platforms,
provide researchers working on emerging- and nonmodel species an affordable means of addressing a wide
range of questions [1]. While completely assembled
genomes of non-model organisms may not be easily
obtained, very low-coverage shotgun sequencing can be
used for various applications, such as to identify microsatellites for population genetic analyses [2,3]. Low coverage
genome survey sequences (GSS) can also provide information about gene content, polymorphisms, functional
elements and repetitive elements [4].

In support of the utility of low-coverage sequencing, simulations have shown that most of the coding sequence in
a genome can be surveyed with less than 2× genomic coverage [5]. As a case in point, the original 1.5× assembly of
the dog genome provided partial sequence of thousands
of dog orthologs of human genes [6]. At even lower coverage, Wernersson et al. [7] were able to recover 38% of
the coding fraction of the mouse-human alignment with
only 0.66× coverage of the pig genome. Furthermore, lowcoverage survey sequencing appears to be an efficient way
of identifying common repetitive DNA sequences. For
example, a large fraction of the repetitive DNA sequences
in the complex, highly repetitive barley genome of were

computationally identified with only ~10% of the
genome sequenced [8]. These studies suggest that as next
generation sequencing becomes more widespread, lowcoverage genome surveys will play a prominent role in
studies of non-model species.
To gauge the suitability of genome surveys at depths of
coverage lower than those used in previous studies, we
partially sequenced the genome of the scuttle fly Megaselia
scalaris (Phoridae) by 454 pyrosequencing. While no
genomic resources had been developed for this species
prior to this point, M. scalaris has a rich history in biological research [reviewed in [9]] and can serve as a representative of a potentially emerging model species for ecology
and evolutionary biology. To this end, one-fourth of a
standard 454 run was conducted with randomly sheared
genomic DNA. Based on flow cytometry estimates of
genome size, the depth of coverage across the genome was
approximately 0.05x0.1x. However, our low-coverage
likely reflects the position of many researchers using nextgeneration technologies for sequencing in non-model
eukaryotes with large, complex genomes. We therefore
view our low-coverage as a bioinformatics challenge and
focus on analyses that can be conducted with limited GSS
data.
Even with only ~0.1× coverage, we were able to generate a
considerable amount of biologically useful information
and genomic resources for M. scalaris. First, because of the
substantial impact repetitive elements (REs) can have on
the structure and evolution of genomes [10,11], we
searched for REs in M. scalaris based on homology to wellcharacterized REs. Novel or lineage-specific tandem REs
were then identified by using a custom program we developed. The effectiveness of these computational procedures was evaluated by performing the same analyses on
low-coverage sequence simultaneously generated from
Drosophila pseudoobscura, for which a well-annotated reference genome sequence is available [12]. Secondly, we
assembled a nearly complete sequence for the ~15.4 kb
mitochondrial (mt) genome of M. scalaris. Thirdly, we
looked for microsatellite loci to develop molecular markers for M. scalaris. Finally, we identified coding regions
and other functional elements in the M. scalaris genome
by comparisons to the completed genomes of Drosophila

melanogaster and other Dipterans. A discussion of the utility and concerns raised by extremely low-coverage survey
sequencing is also presented.

Results
A total of 129,080 sequence reads with a mean read length
of 231 bp were generated from 454 sequencing of randomly sheared Megaselia scalaris genomic DNA. If we
assume the genome size to be approximately 540 megabases, as estimated from our flow cytometry, this coverage
amounts to 0.055×. If instead the genome size is 330 megabases [13], we have 0.090× coverage of the genome.
To expedite analysis, the full set of sequences was filtered
to remove redundant reads that were shorter, internal
fragments of longer reads. The non-redundant set contained 96,625 reads and is hereinafter referred to as the
genome survey sequence (GSS) set. Table 1 summarizes
the proportions of redundant, mitochondrial and identified coding and repetitive (see below) sequence reads contained in the GSS set. The nucleotide content of the GSS
reads showed that the Megaselia genome is G-C poor
(32%) compared to A-T content (68%). Removing repetitive and mitochondrial sequences from the GSS further
increased the nucleotide usage bias to a G-C content of
30%.
Survey of Repetitive Elements (REs)
Two approaches were used to identify repetitive elements
in the M. scalaris genome. The first approach relied on
homology of repeats to well-described REs in publicly
available databases. A total of 102 REs were identified on
the basis of similarity to known elements in the Drosophila
and Anopheles RepBase libraries (Additional file 1). Based
on the number of reads with significant similarity to various classes of REs, retroelements appear more abundant
in copy number than DNA transposons, as is the tendency
in most eukaryotes [14]. LTR retroelements were the most
abundant class (45%), with many copies of gypsy and
copia elements identified. The second most abundant class
was non-LTR elements (LINEs), representing 38% of identified REs, including many jockey elements. Only 4% of
identified REs were DNA transposons.

The second approach used our REFinder.plx http://
www.biology.duke.edu/noorlab/NoorSoft.html program
to identify tandem REs de novo. This method has the
advantage of detecting previously uncharacterized or
highly divergent REs, but was not designed to detect interspersed elements. Before running the program on the M.
scalaris GSS reads, we tested the program on genome survey sequences from D. pseudoobscura bogotana, which were
generated from the same 454 run and at the same coverage as the M. scalaris data. This allowed us to optimize
parameters in the REFinder.plx program and to test the
program's ability to detect previously described REs in the
D. pseudoobscura genome. The contigs generated by the
program matched single units of elements known in D.
pseudoobscura such as Leviathan [15], a bilbo non-LTR, and
ITS sequences. Furthermore, to confirm that REFinder.plx
correctly assembles repetitive sequences, contigs that the
program generated were queried against the assembled D.
pseudoobscura reference genome. In most cases, our contigs
aligned to stretches of the D. pseudoosbcura genome that
were as long or just slightly shorter than the contigs generated by the program. That the alignments spanned the
length of multiple reads suggests that these contigs were
correctly assembled rather than artificial hybrid
sequences.
Starting from a set of 1,741 candidate repeat sequences
that were present in at least two copies in the M. scalaris
GSS reads, REFinder.plx identified 340 tandem repeats,
251 of which were unique repeats that did not show significant similarity to other computationally identified REs
(Additional file 2). The average coverage across all unique
repeat motifs, calculated from coverage across 40 bp windows, was 19.93 (SD = 33.96) with a few repeat motifs
reaching as great as 200× coverage. This high level of
redundancy in repeat coverage suggests that most of the
identified REs are present in high copy number in the M.
scalaris genome. Furthermore, for 239 of the identified
REs, no significant hits were found by BLAST searches of
GenBank, suggesting that most of the identified REs were
unique to M. scalaris or previously uncharacterized in
other species.
The M. scalaris Mitochondrial Genome
We initially assembled the M. scalaris mitochondrial (mt)
genome by aligning contiguous but overlapping sequence
reads while using the D. melanogaster mt genome as a scaffold. From this initial assembly, 648 mitochondrial GSS
sequences were identified and aligned into several large
contigs. Gaps between contigs were amplified and
sequenced by traditional Sanger sequencing when possible. There were two gaps for which we could not obtain
high-quality sequence. The first is located between cytochrome c oxidase subunit II and ATPase subunit 6 and is
flanked by A-T homopolymer tracts (Figure 1). Based on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/382

the size of a PCR fragment that spans this gap, it is approximately 300 bp long. The second gap is located between
the 16S ribosomal RNAs and NADH dehyrdrogenase subunit 2, but we do not have an estimate for its length since
it falls within a highly A-T rich region that varies in size
among other Dipterans and we could not successfully
amplify a fragment spanning the gap.
Although we did not obtain complete coverage, we did
generate a 15.4 kb consensus sequence for the M. scalaris
mt genome (Additional file 3). Coverage across the mt
genome was high except in extremely A-T rich regions (the
gaps mentioned above), where no 454 sequence traces
were recovered. The mean depth of coverage was greater
than 10×, with smaller regions attaining depths greater
than 20× (Figure 2). Overall, the M. scalaris mt genome is
similar to that of other Dipterans. The A-T content is high,
at ~80%. The arrangement of protein-coding genes and
the small and large ribosomal subunit RNAs is identical to
that of most other arthropods (Boore, 1999), although
ATPase subunit 8 was not present in our assembly (Figure
1). The most parsimonious explanation for the absence of
ATPase subunit 8 is that the gene is located within Gap 1
of our assembly between cytochrome c oxidase II and
ATPase subunit 6, where it is normally located in other
arthropods [16].
Since mtDNA sequences are commonly used in phylogenetic and population genetic analyses, we asked if our
low-depth GSS strategy would typically recover a complete mt genome sequence in other species. Therefore,
using the same methods as for M. scalaris, we assembled
the 15.8 kb D. pseudoobscura bogotana mt genome from
our GSS reads (Additional file 4). For D. pseudoobscura,
1.5% of the GSS reads were mitochondrial as compared to
0.5% for M. scalaris. The higher relative abundance of mt
reads in D. pseudoobscura allowed for the assembly of the
complete mt genome with a mean of 20× coverage. These
results demonstrate that a relatively small number of
sequences can recover complete mt sequences in GSS
studies of some species.
Scan for Microsatellites
GSS reads were scanned for the presence of all possible
perfect di- or tri-nucleotide repeat motifs with the program Microscan.plx http://www.biology.duke.edu/noor
lab/NoorSoft.html to find potentially variable microsatellite loci. Only 37 microsatellites with 10 or more repeat
units were identified through this approach in M. scalaris.
This was apparently not due to a failure of the program to
detect microsatellites, as it recovered 429 such microsatellites when run with the D. pseudoobscura bogotana GSS
sequences, despite there being 25% fewer sequence reads
than in the M. scalaris GSS. The M. scalaris genome therefore appears to harbor a much smaller number of micros-

atellites. From these sequence reads, we were able to
design primers and identify variability among strains at a
subset of these microsatellites (data not shown).
Identification of Gene Homologs
Homology searches were conducted to find M. scalaris
reads with significant similarity to annotated genes and
functional elements in other Dipteran genomes. Evaluating the number of "true" matches between Drosophila melanogaster gene sequences and M. scalaris GSS reads is
challenging because of multigene families within both
species, including histones, tRNAs and rRNAs. Hence, a
single D. melanogaster gene may resemble many M. scalaris
genes, and vice versa. Considering this issue, we examined
the number of sequences with similarity between D. melanogaster and M. scalaris in two ways. As a first approach,
we used BLAST to identify which genes in D. melanogaster

bore significant similarity to the nonrepetitive M. scalaris
GSS set. With an e-value cutoff of 10-5, we found 815 D.
melanogaster coding genes with at least one significant
match to a M. scalaris read (Additional file 5). However,
this approach can still identify multiple similar D. melanogaster genes matching a single M. scalaris sequence trace.
To address this, we then eliminated all redundant hits to
single M. scalaris traces, and identified 330 unique M. scalaris reads with significant sequence homology to an
annotated D. melanogaster gene.
For comparison, we also used the annotated genomes of
Drosophila virilis and Anopheles gambiae to conduct gene
homology searches. With D. virilis, 913 potentially
homologous genes were identified, although most of the
genes are uncharacterized in the D. virilis genome annotation (Additional file 6). As with D. melanogaster, we elim-

inated all redundant hits to a single M. scalaris sequence
trace, which identified 306 unique M. scalaris reads with
significant homology to a D. virilis gene. With A. gambiae,
only 133 potential homologs from 98 unique M. scalaris
reads were identified (Additional file 7), likely due to the
combination of the smaller number of annotated genes in
the A. gambiae genome and the longer divergence time
between M. scalaris and Anopheles relative to M. scalaris
and Drosophila. In all, 520 M. scalaris reads were identified
as potential coding sequences by homology searches performed with other Dipteran genomes.

Discussion
Although our preliminary sequencing of the Megaselia scalaris genome resulted in extremely low-coverage (between
0.05× and 0.10×), we were able to perform a number of
bioinformatic analyses that provided useful information
for characterizing this genome as well as generating various genomic resources. We were able to characterize

numerous repetitive sequences in the genome, including
some with homology to known elements and some that
have not been characterized previously. Useful resources
such as a nearly complete mitochondrial genome
sequence and microsatellite markers were also easily
developed from the GSS data. Moreover, partial sequences
for hundreds of orthologs of Drosophila and Anopheles
genes were generated.
An assumption laden in some of our analyses is that the
genome survey sequences studied are "random" segments
from across the genome. We cannot exclude the possibility that certain regions of the genome were more or less
likely to be surveyed due to features such as GC-content.
Indeed, we observed coverage of the mitochondrial
genome was lower or missing in the most extremely A-T
rich regions. This bias may have resulted from the
sequencing process itself or issues with sample preparation and/or library generation. Nonetheless, the

approaches here provide a first, albeit imperfect, approximation of various features of a previously unexplored
genome, and several of our conclusions do not depend
upon a truly random sampling of the genome.
M. scalaris was chosen for partial genome sequencing
because of its interesting natural history and potential to
become a model species in ecology and evolutionary biology. Previous work on M. scalaris has already revealed
much about its ecology, development, sex-determination
system, and life cycle [reviewed in [9]]. The species is
widely distributed and many aspects of its ecology are
peculiar. For example, M. scalaris larvae are notable for the
wide range of organic matter on which they can feed;
reportedly the widest range of any insect [9]. Because larvae are also facultative parasites, they can enter open
wounds and therefore pose some threat to human health,
especially in the developing world [17-19].
A complete M. scalaris genome sequence would also
strengthen comparative and evolutionary genomic studies
of the Dipterans. While there are completed genomes for
12 Drosophila species [20] and the mosquitoes Anopheles
gambiae [21] and Aedes aegypti [22], no genome sequence
is currently available for any Dipteran species outside of
the Drosophilids and mosquitoes. A phorid fly such as M.
scalaris would also serve as a good outgroup in comparative genomic studies of the Drosophilids. For example, the
genome of M. scalaris could facilitate the identification of
regulatory elements and assessing patterns of evolution,
as has been recently suggested also for Tephritids [23].
Applications of Low-coverage Genome Sequence
We anticipate that researchers studying a wide range of
non-model taxa will be drawn to newer, less-expensive
genome sequencing technologies, often for generating
microsatellites [2,3] or other markers [24] to survey population variability and connectivity, phylogenetic position, and other questions. Based on our study of M.
scalaris, using 454 pyrosequencing to sequence genomic
DNA appears to be an effective strategy for generating lowcoverage sequence data, with read-lengths amenable for
assembly or BLAST [25] analyses. Sequence reads also
appear to be distributed throughout the genome, allowing
for partial coverage of many functional elements and hundreds of orthologs of known genes. Thus, low-depth
sequencing provides mostly new sequence and avoids the
high redundancy seen in large-scale genome projects.

The ability to find repetitive sequences is another important test of the applicability of survey sequencing since
identifying and masking repetitive sequences can be crucial for accurately estimating genome coverage, identifying low-copy "gene space", and assembling large contigs.
We identified over 100 M. scalaris transposable element

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/382

copies by homology searches, most of which were LTR retroelements and non-LTR retrotransposons. These REs
could be masked in future genomic work in M, scalaris,
facilitating assembly of the short sequence reads obtained
through 454 or other short-read sequencing. Low-coverage genome surveys therefore appear to be an effective
way to identify repetitive sequences, as several previous
studies have successfully identified repetitive sequences
with low genome coverage in other systems [6,8,26,27].
While available programs like RepeatMasker (Smit and
Green, unpublished data) and others can identify previously known REs, identifying novel REs in unassembled
genomes remains problematic. Our REFinder.plx program was designed to quickly identify as many novel REs
in unassembled genomes as possible. We further validated this program by applying it to comparable GSS
from a species with a fully sequenced and assembled
genome, Drosophila pseudoobscura, and identifying known
elements. However, it was not designed to detect all
classes of transposable elements and, because the program works by assembling and identifying potentially
repetitive sequences in contigs, it can only identify REs in
tandem arrays. It should also be noted that our program
was not designed to identify higher-order repeats or identify the exact boundaries of REs. Other programs for de
novo detection of REs, such as ReAS [28] or ReRep [29],
may provide better detection of other classes of repeats,
such as interspersed elements, in low-coverage genome
surveys. It is also possible that some REs we detected are
hybrids of different elements or that some non-repetitive
flanking ends of REs were incorporated. Nonetheless, it
provides a useful starting point for characterizing a novel
genome of its repetitive element content.
Since no attempt to remove mtDNA from nuclear DNA
was made prior to sequencing, mtDNA sequences were
present in high copy number, which allowed us to assemble most of the M. scalaris mt genome. Even more encouraging was that we were able to assemble a complete mt
genome at 20× coverage from the D. pseudoobscura bogotana GSS reads. This suggests that low-coverage genome
surveys can also be an easy way of obtaining mtDNA
sequences for phylogenetic studies and markers for population genetic studies. The proportion of mitochondrial
traces was 0.5% (648/129,080) for the M. scalaris GSS and
1.3% (1299/98,451) for D. p. bogotana, consistent with
the estimated greater nuclear genome size of the former
(330540 megabases vs. 185 megabases [30]).
While it would be helpful to know exactly how much
sequence data is needed to completely cover a mt genome,
this cannot be easily quantified. Based on a binomial distribution, the expected coverage of a target sequence given

Page 6 of 9
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:382

a certain depth of coverage or level of redundancy, R, can
be approximated by the equation: E(Coverage) = 1 - e-R
Based on this relationship, for a 15 kb mt genome and a
mean sequence read length of 200 bp, approximately 500
reads of mitochondrial sequence are needed to obtain full
coverage. However, this approximation will not hold if
sequence reads are nonrandomly distributed over the target sequence. For instance, a bias towards sequence reads
being in G-C rich regions across the M. scalaris mt genome
likely explains why we did not obtain the sequence of the
A-T rich mitochondrial control region even though we
recovered 648 mt sequence reads, far more than theory
suggests are necessary. The amount of sequence required
for full coverage of a mt genome therefore depends on
biases in sequencing and DNA preparation, as well as biological differences among organisms (or even tissues) in
mt copy number.
The point raised above for mt genome sequencing brings
up a more general caveat for researchers using low-coverage GSS strategies. With low depths of coverage, the probability of obtaining complete coverage of any target
sequence becomes exceedingly low. This holds true for
coding sequences in the nuclear genome as well as
organellar genomes. If specific sequences are the ultimate
goal of genome sequencing, then more directed
approaches would be more appropriate than our random
GSS approach.

sequencer at the Duke Institute for Genome Sciences and
Policy. A low-coverage genome scan of Drosophila pseudoobscura bogotana was conducted in parallel with M. scalaris
on the same 454 run (NCBI Short Read Archive accession
SRA008268). Parallel sequencing of two different species
allowed for the validation of sequencing methods and the
computational analysis used in this study. The M. scalaris
genome sequence traces were submitted to the NCBI
Short Read Archive as accession SRA008342.
Estimates of genome size for both species were made
using flow cytometry. We used the Partec® UV Precise T kit
for extraction and DNA staining of nuclear DNA, following the manufacturer's instructions. Adult M. scalaris
males and females were run separately in the kit, both
alone and with internal controls of Drosophila pseudoobscura. 2C values corresponding to the M. scalaris isolates
were 4 times greater than those for D. pseudoobscura, suggesting a genome size roughly four times larger in M. scalaris. While this estimate is imperfect because of possible
effects of differences in G-C content, it nonetheless provides a crude estimate. The genome size of D. pseudoobscura is 135 megabases [30], so that of M. scalaris would
be roughly 540 megabases.

Methods

Identification of Repetitive Elements De Novo
To identify a subset of highly divergent and lineage specific REs, we developed a Perl script (dubbed
REFinder.plx) that can isolate tandem REs de novo. The
Perl script is available at http://www.biology.duke.edu/
noorlab/NoorSoft.html. Briefly, the program starts by
building a contig around each sequence in a set of userprovided sequences. These contigs are constructed using
an algorithm that uses BLASTn to find contiguous
sequences and aligns them. Assembling reads into contigs
allows the program to identify repetitive sequences that
span the length of multiple reads. Each time the contig is
extended, the program checks if the sequence being added
to the contig aligns anywhere within the existing contig. If
the new sequence aligns within the existing contig, the
entire sequence between the new sequence and the
matched sequence in the existing contig is extracted and
considered a single potential repetitive motif. Reasoning
that sequences present more than once in the GSS reads
were more likely to be repetitive than sequences present in
single copy, we only seeded the program with sequences
present at least twice in the M. scalaris GSS.

Sequencing and genome size estimation
We collected wild Megaselia scalaris individuals from populations in Durham, NC and inbred for 7 to 8 generations
by crossing half-siblings. DNA for sequencing was prepared from adult males and females using a Puregene
DNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and randomly sheared into
fragments for sequencing. One-fourth of a standard 454
sequencing run was performed on a Roche GS-FLX

Mitochondrial Genome Assembly
We initially assembled the M. scalaris and D. pseudoobscura
bogotana mitochondrial (mt) genomes by manually aligning contiguous but overlapping sequences, using the D.
melanogaster mt genome as a scaffold. For M. scalaris, three
gaps in the original assembly were filled by PCR amplifying fragments corresponding to the gaps. PCR fragments

.

Conclusion
We were able to generate genomic resources for Megaselia
scalaris with very limited sequence data obtained through
454-pyrosequencing. Although this was a preliminary
study, the data we have generated is both immediately
useful and will be used to guide future larger-scale
sequencing of the M. scalaris genome. We have also developed scripts for facilitating bioinformatics analysis of GSS
data and made them available to the public. Our encouraging results suggest that low-coverage GSS approaches
will become more popular among researchers working on
non-model organisms, especially as the cost of next-generation sequencing continues to decline.

were then sequenced with Big Dye terminator sequencing
reagents (Applied Biosystems) and run on an ABI 3730
sequencer. When multiple products were amplified, PCR
products were first cloned using a TOPO TA cloning kit
(Invitrogen) and then sequenced. After all gaps were
filled, the original alignment was used as a reference to
identify all mitochondrial sequences contained in the GSS
reads. All mt sequences contained in the GSS were then
aligned and assembled into a consensus sequence using
the program SeqMan in the Lasergene 7.0 software package (DNAStar). Annotation of the mt genome was done
with BLASTx for protein coding regions and BLASTn for
non-coding regions.
Scans for Microsatellites
The GSS reads were scanned for microsatellites with the
custom-built Perl script Microscan.plx, which can identify
arrays of di- and trinucleotide repeats and is specifically
designed for use with FASTA-formatted genome sequence
traces as input (for a review of other microsatellite search
software, see [31]). The program is available at http://
www.biology.duke.edu/noorlab/NoorSoft.html.
Annotation of Functional and Repetitive Elements
To identify functional elements, we used BLASTn [25] to
find M. scalaris reads with significant similarity to annotated features in other Dipteran genomes. Except where
otherwise stated, all BLASTn searches were performed
using the default settings and an e-value cutoff of 10-5. For
comparisons with D. melanogaster, all annotated coding
genes, including tRNAs and rRNAs, in release 5.13 from
FlyBase [32] were queried against all M. scalaris reads. We
repeated these searches using the annotated coding genes
in release 1.2 of the D. virilis genome. For comparisons
with A. gambiae, all protein-coding genes in the PEST
AgamP3 assembly available from VectorBase [33] were
used. To find previously characterized repetitive elements,
we queried all REs present in the Anopheles and Drosophila
libraries of release 13.11 of RepBase [34] against the M.
scalaris reads.

Authors' contributions
DAR executed virtually all of the research and analyses,
and coded REFinder.plx. MAFN coordinated the project,
performed the flow cytometry analyses, and coded Microscan.plx. Both authors wrote the manuscript.
