Abstract
Background: The biosynthesis of aflatoxin (AF) involves over 20 enzymatic reactions in a complex
polyketide pathway that converts acetate and malonate to the intermediates sterigmatocystin (ST)
and O-methylsterigmatocystin (OMST), the respective penultimate and ultimate precursors of AF.
Although these precursors are chemically and structurally very similar, their accumulation differs
at the species level for Aspergilli. Notable examples are A. nidulans that synthesizes only ST, A. flavus
that makes predominantly AF, and A. parasiticus that generally produces either AF or OMST.
Whether these differences are important in the evolutionary/ecological processes of species
adaptation and diversification is unknown. Equally unknown are the specific genomic mechanisms
responsible for ordering and clustering of genes in the AF pathway of Aspergillus.
Results: To elucidate the mechanisms that have driven formation of these clusters, we performed
systematic searches of aflatoxin cluster homologs across five Aspergillus genomes. We found a high
level of gene duplication and identified seven modules consisting of highly correlated gene pairs
(aflA/aflB, aflR/aflS, aflX/aflY, aflF/aflE, aflT/aflQ, aflC/aflW, and aflG/aflL). With the exception of A.
nomius, contrasts of mean Ka/Ks values across all cluster genes showed significant differences in
selective pressure between section Flavi and non-section Flavi species. A. nomius mean Ka/Ks values
were more similar to partial clusters in A. fumigatus and A. terreus. Overall, mean Ka/Ks values were
significantly higher for section Flavi than for non-section Flavi species.
Conclusion: Our results implicate several genomic mechanisms in the evolution of ST, OMST and
AF cluster genes. Gene modules may arise from duplications of a single gene, whereby the function
of the pre-duplication gene is retained in the copy (aflF/aflE) or the copies may partition the
ancestral function (aflA/aflB). In some gene modules, the duplicated copy may simply augment/
supplement a specific pathway function (aflR/aflS and aflX/aflY) or the duplicated copy may evolve
a completely new function (aflT/aflQ and aflC/aflW). Gene modules that are contiguous in one
species and noncontiguous in others point to possible rearrangements of cluster genes in the
evolution of these species. Significantly higher mean Ka/Ks values in section Flavi compared to nonsection Flavi species indicate increased positive selection acting in the evolution of genes in OMST
and AF gene clusters.

Background
Filamentous fungi produce a wide variety of economically
important secondary metabolites (extrolites). An extrolite
is any outwardly directed chemical compound that is
excreted or accumulated in the cell wall of a living organism [1]. Many of these extrolite compounds are beneficial,
such as antibiotics, food grade pigments, enzymes, vitamins, lipids, and various pharmaceuticals; however, others, such as mycotoxins, have deleterious effects [2].
Mycotoxins are some of the most toxic natural substances
known and have been estimated to contaminate up to
25% of the world's food production [3]. Although mycotoxins are widespread, the evolutionary/ecological basis
for their production is largely unknown. There are several
classes of mycotoxins, based on structural and chemical
properties, including polyketides (e.g. sterigmatocystin
and aflatoxins; [4]), cyclic peptides, alkaloids, sesquiterpenoids (e.g. trichothecenes; [5]) and epipolythiodioxopiperazines (e.g. gliotoxin; [6]). The aflatoxin (AF)
pathway is one of the most intensively studied and well
characterized of the polyketide pathways. Aflatoxins are a
family of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites that are
responsible for contamination of agricultural crops,
resulting in staggering losses to the agricultural industry
and untold impact on human health worldwide [7,8].

cystin (OMST), an immediate precursor to aflatoxin B1
[12]. Section Flavi species other than A. flavus and A. parasiticus are mostly of minor importance to agriculture and
include A. nomius, A. bombycis, and the unnamed taxon, all
of which produce aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2, and A.
pseudotamarii, which produces aflatoxins B1 and B2
[15,16].
To better understand aflatoxin production in the
Aspergilli, the organization, function and regulation of
genes involved in AF biosynthesis has been a focus of
study [17,18]. The genes in AF biosynthesis are clustered
in a 70-kb DNA region and encode at least 23 coregulated
transcripts under the control of the regulatory gene aflR
[19,20]. In both the AF and sterigmatocystin (ST) gene
clusters, aflR is a positive regulatory gene required for the
transcriptional activation of most, if not all, pathway
genes [21]. As shown in Figure 1, ST is produced by several
fungal species, including A. nidulans, a model genetic sys-

Aflatoxin-producing fungi primarily belong to Aspergillus
section Flavi, which includes A. flavus and A. parasiticus,
the species most responsible for aflatoxin contamination
of oil-rich crops such as corn, peanuts, cottonseed, and
tree nuts [9]. There are four major classes of AF, depending
on the presence of the characteristic polyketide dihydro(B1 and G1) or tetrahydro- (B2 and G2) bisfuran rings [10]
(Figure 1). A. flavus produces aflatoxins B1 and B2 and
often another mycotoxin, cyclopiazonic acid (CPA)
[11,12]. Isolates differ considerably in the amount of aflatoxins produced, and populations of A. flavus vary in proportions of strains that produce both aflatoxins and CPA,
aflatoxins alone, CPA alone, and neither mycotoxin [11].
Divergence within A. flavus has allowed for further classification of two phenotypic groups based on the morphology of the sclerotia, which are either large (L) or small (S)
with a diameter of greater than or less than 400 μm,
respectively [9]. Geiser et al. [13,14] subdivided A. flavus
into two groups based on RFLPs of nuclear-coding genes
and DNA sequences. Group I contains both L and S strains
that produce aflatoxins B1 and B2, whereas Group II comprises only S strains that often produce B and G aflatoxins
and represents, at least in part, an unnamed taxon. A. parasiticus primarily infects peanuts and is uncommon in aerial crops such as corn and cottonseed [9]. The species
produces both B and G aflatoxins at generally high concentrations and nonaflatoxigenic isolates are uncommon;
CPA is not produced [12]. Nonaflatoxigenic isolates of A.
parasiticus instead often accumulate O-methylsterigmato-

Precursor and terminal metabolites in AF biosynthesis. Sterigmatocystin (ST), O-methylsterigmatocystin (OMST)
and aflatoxins (AF) are synthesized as end products by
numerous ascomycetes. There are four major aflatoxins: B1,
B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxins B2 and G2 are missing the double
bond (indicated in red), which is present in B1 and G1. A. parasiticus produces B1, B2, G1 and G2; nonaflatoxigenic A. parasiticus strains commonly accumulate OMST. The gene aflU is
required for the formation of G aflatoxins [10]; aflQ is
required for the formation of B aflatoxins [17]; and aflP is
required for the conversion of ST to OMST [17]. A. flavus, A.
parasiticus, A. nomius [68], A. pseudotamarii [69] and A. bombycis [68] belong to Aspergillus section Flavi. Emericella is a teleomorphic genus for the sexual stage of Aspergillus. Monocillium
is an anamorphic name associated with a Niesslia teleomorph,
also in the Phylum Ascomycota. The Ascomycota comprise
highly divergent fungal lineages that span 450 million years of
evolutionary history [70].

tem that has been used to identify the genes involved in
ST biosynthesis [22]. The ST and OMST precursors are
environmentally stable mycotoxins and are chemically
and structurally similar to AF. The accumulation of particular extrolites of the AF biosynthetic family often differs at
the species level for Aspergilli. For instance, A. nidulans
synthesizes only ST, while strains of A. ochraceoroseus have
been shown to accumulate ST and AF (Figure 1). In comparison, Aspergillus species in section Flavi, including A.
flavus, A. parasiticus, A. bombycis, A. nomius, and A. pseudotamarii, predominantly synthesize AF. These section Flavi
species have an identical cluster configuration, whereas
gene order in A. ochraceoroseus is more similar to the ST
cluster in A. nidulans [22], indicating that gene order does
not determine whether ST or AF is synthesized [23]. The
recent availability of the complete genome of A. flavus as
well as other Aspergillus species [24-26] will allow us to
further assess the role of gene duplication, recruitment
and reorganization in the evolution of this important
pathway.
To date eight Aspergillus genomes have been sequenced,
including the model organism A. nidulans [27] and species
of industrial (A. niger [28], A. oryzae [29]), medical (A.
fumigatus [30], A. terreus [31], A. fischerianus [32], A. clavatus [33]) and agricultural (A. flavus [34]) importance. All
genomes contain eight chromosomes but vary in their
overall size and in the number of predicted genes. For
example, the genomes of A. oryzae (37.2 Mb, 12,319 predicted genes [29]) and A. flavus (36.3 Mb, 13,091 predicted genes [34]) are very similar and approximately
20% larger than the genomes of A. fumigatus (28.8 Mb,
10,114 predicted genes [30]), A. nidulans (30.1 Mb,
10,701 predicted genes [27]) and A. terreus (29.2 Mb,
10,406 predicted genes [31]). Preliminary comparative
genome analyses reveal large non-syntenous regions
resulting from insertions or deletions in subtelomeric
sequences, intra-molecular recombinations, variation in
the number of repeated elements, tandem repeats, and
gene duplicates [24]. The proximity of the AF gene cluster
to the telomere in A. flavus, and the enrichment of secondary metabolite genes in subtelomeric regions in the
Aspergilli in general, may facilitate the rapid reorganization and evolution of these genes in a species-specific
fashion. This may explain the specificity of AF pathway
extrolite profiles (chemotypes) for specific Aspergillus taxa.
The biological significance of AF chemotypes, like that of
the majority of fungal secondary extrolites, is unclear.
Numerous intriguing ideas regarding the function of AF
pathway gene products have been offered and studies
indicate that the role of these compounds in the survival
of Aspergillus spp. may be extremely diverse [35,36]. Aflatoxins are not essential to the growth of Aspergilli under
certain conditions and are not required for successful

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/111

competition in AF-producing strains [35,37]. However,
there may be an association between the biosynthesis of
AF and developmental processes governing sporulation.
Several studies have demonstrated that chemical inhibitors, mutations, and various environmental stimuli that
suppress the synthesis of AF also affect or inhibit sporulation in Aspergillus spp. [36,38]. Although we do not fully
understand the biological significance of AF extrolites, the
fact that AF and ST clusters are under strong purifying
selection [39] indicates that clustering is actively maintained to counteract degradation by random neutral processes. In this study, we show that gene duplication and
modularity as well as positive selection are responsible for
the ordering and clustering of genes in the AF pathway of
Aspergillus.

Results
AF homologs and gene modules in Aspergillus
We used the predicted polypeptide sequences in A. parasiticus AF gene cluster as our reference sequences in
TBLASTN and TBLASTX comparisons of the A. nidulans, A.
fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus, and A. oryzae genome databases. The genomes for A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, A. flavus,
A. terreus and A. oryzae provide 13X, 11X, 10X, 11X and 9X
sequence coverage, respectively [24-26,34]. Table 1 summarizes the map location (chromosome or contig), Evalue, percent coverage, and gene orientation, which is the
direction of transcription depending on whether the top
(+) or bottom (-) strand is being transcribed, for the two
best homologs across all five Aspergillus genomes. The
total number of putative duplicates for each cluster gene
is plotted in Figure 2A.

In general, there is conservation of gene order and direction of transcription for specific groups of two or more AF
pathway genes. We tested the hypothesis that genes showing a similar pattern of copy number across species have
been duplicated together in groups that we term 'gene
modules'. If the average copy number was less than two
across all five genomes then we also considered the proximity of genes in inferring gene modules. Correlated genes
that are not genomically proximate reflect historical modules that have undergone recent reorganization. The dendrogram in Figure 2B shows that gene copy number for
groups of two or three AF cluster genes is significantly correlated (P < 0.05; 0.8 <r2<1). These highly correlated genes
or modules, which may function as distinct biological
units in AF biosynthesis, are color coded in Figure 3.
We identified seven putative gene modules across the five
Aspergillus genomes. Not all genes in modules are syntenic
across all genomes. There is conservation in gene order
and direction of transcription for 1) all genes in the A. parasiticus, A. flavus and A. oryzae AF gene clusters, 2)
modules with wo genes (e.g., aflR/aflS, aflA/aflB) in

Genome-wide tallies of aflatoxin gene duplicates, correlations among gene duplicates and inferred gene modules
Genome-wide tallies of aflatoxin gene duplicates, correlations among gene duplicates and inferred gene modules. A. The histogram plot shows the total number of putative aflatoxin gene cluster duplicates on y-axis across five Aspergillus genomes. The gene order in the histogram follows the order of genes in the A. flavus cluster (see cluster schematic below
histogram). B. Hierarchical cluster dendrogram showing the correlations among gene duplicates in Figure 2A. Correlations are
based on a dissimilarity measure of (1-r2) in which correlation values are assigned "distance" values ranging from 0.0 (completely correlated, r2 = 1) to 1.0 (completely uncorrelated, r2 = 0). The y-axis represents the height or distance between the
gene groups divided at that point. The dendrogram shows seven putative gene modules listed from left to right as: aflX/aflY, aflJ/
aflR/aflS, aflC/aflW, aflA/aflB, aflF/aflE, aflT/aflQ and aflG/aflL that are highly correlated (0.80 <r2 < 1) across the five Aspergillus
genomes. We consider aflR/aflS/aflJ as correlated since only aflH separates aflR/aflS from aflJ. These correlated pairs are the
inferred gene modules, color coded in Figure 3.

Gene module reorganization in complete clusters and modularity in partial clusters
Figure 3
Gene module reorganization in complete clusters and modularity in partial clusters. The cluster schematic shows
the chromosomal location, gene order and direction of transcription of genes in ST, AF and partial gene clusters. To simplify
comparisons among AF and ST clusters we adopt the new AF gene nomenclature throughout [17]. The seven inferred gene
modules are color coded. The arrows in the cluster at the top indicate the location of noncontiguous recombination blocks in
the A. parasiticus gene cluster [40]. The intergenic regions indicated by the black arrows share a common evolutionary history
and can be concatenated into a single contiguous block such that aflB and aflL are adjacent in a hypothetical ancestor. Similarly
the intergenic regions shown with grey arrows can be reunited such that aflE and aflW are adjacent. Overall this reorganization
mirrors the order of these genes in the A. nidulans ST cluster and highlights the importance of gene module reorganization in
the evolution of AF and ST clusters. A partial cluster duplication has been reported for some strains of A. parasiticus [71]. Syntenic partial clusters of five genes (aflC, aflS, aflR, aflX and aflY) were identified in A. fumigatus and A. terreus.

the A. nidulans ST cluster and the A. parasiticus, A. flavus,
A. oryzae AF clusters, and 3) at least two cluster genes (aflA/
aflB) in A. fumigatus and A. terreus genomes (Figure 3).
Syntenic partial clusters of five genes (aflC, aflS, aflR, aflX
and aflY) were identified in A. fumigatus and A. terreus.
Both the A. fumigatus partial cluster and the A. nidulans ST
cluster reside on chromosome 4 while the A. parasiticus, A.
flavus and A. oryzae AF gene clusters are located near the

telomere of chromosome 3. From these data alone, the
phylogenetic relationships among A. fumigatus, A. terreus,
A. nidulans and section Flavi species can not be fully
resolved, but the observed synteny in the partial clusters
of A. fumigatus and A. terreus may indicate that similar
evolutionary mechanisms have influenced the evolution
of these clusters. Gene modules that are contiguous only
in the AF clusters of certain species may arise from gene

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:111

reorganization that reunites previously separated genes. A
striking example is aflG/aflL, which is contiguous only in
the cluster of section Flavi species, suggesting either
recruitment from other genomic locations or reorganization of cluster genes from an ST ancestor (Figure 3). Population genetic analyses of molecular sequence variation
in the aflatoxin gene cluster of A. parasiticus support the
latter hypothesis [40]. Other putative gene modules aflF/
aflE, aflT/aflQ, and aflC/aflW are separated by more than
35 kb in ST and AF gene clusters.
There was no evidence of partial clustering of two or more
gene modules residing outside the AF and ST clusters.
Thus, we focused on the gene module itself and examined
the orientation and separation of genes in modules residing outside the cluster (Table 1). Our definition of a gene
module is independent of the physical proximity of genes.
Even gene modules that are syntenic in all species clusters
vary in their degree of synteny when residing outside of
the cluster. For example, in A. flavus, the two aflA/aflB gene
modules that map to chromosome 3 but reside outside
the cluster are nonsyntenous. In one module, the aflA and
aflB genes are separated by 30 kb and in the other module
by approximately 40 kb. Other gene modules residing
outside the cluster show a high degree of synteny. For
example, a copy of aflF/aflE on chromosome 7 of A. nidulans (not shown in Table 1) is contiguous and aflF and aflE
are separated by less than 1 kb, comparable to the distance
separating contiguous gene modules in the cluster. In
some cases the orientation of genes in modules residing
outside the cluster in one species matches the configuration of genes in a different species. For example, a copy of
the aflX/aflY module on chromosome 8 of A. nidulans
(Table 1) has the same order and gene orientation as aflX/
aflY found in the AF clusters of section Flavi species (both
genes negatively transcribed). This conservation further
supports the vertical transmission of these modules.
Species-specific adaptation
Initially we observed conserved syntenic relationships
among AF gene clusters that mirrored phylogenetic species groupings. For example, within section Flavi, all species show high conservation in gene order and direction of
transcription. A second grouping that includes A. fumigatus and A. terreus has conserved partial clusters. The apparent outlier, A. nidulans, shares gene modules with both
groups as well as local rearrangements of modules, giving
rise to a unique cluster configuration that is intermediate
in size to partial and full gene clusters. Indeed, if cluster
configuration is indicative of higher-order phylogenetic
relationships among these species, then molecular variation in cluster genes would be expected to track with the
underlying phylogeny and could potentially also be
linked to evolutionary/ecological processes of species
adaptation and diversification.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/111

The impact of positive (adaptive) or negative (purifying)
selection on putative orthologs in full or partial AF clusters in Aspergillus was determined by calculating the ratio
of amino acid (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) substitutions
using GenomeHistory [41]. The magnitude of the Ka/Ks
ratio provides evidence of genes under strong functional
constraints (Ka/Ks < 1) or undergoing adaptive evolution
(Ka/Ks > 1). We considered a linear model that parameterizes the selective pressure (Ka/Ks) on gene clusters in
terms of variation across all cluster genes and species.
Contrasts between section Flavi and non-section Flavi species showed significant differences in mean Ka/Ks values (t
= -6.78, P < 0.0001), and mean Ka/Ks values were significantly higher for section Flavi species than for non-section
Flavi species (Figure 4). With the exception of A. nomius,
pairwise contrasts among section Flavi species indicated
no significant differences in mean Ka/Ks values for A. parasiticus, the A. parasiticus partial cluster duplication, A. flavus and A. oryzae. Similarly, there were no significant
differences in mean Ka/Ks values among non-section Flavi
species; however, mean Ka/Ks values for A. nomius were
more similar to Ka/Ks values of partial clusters in A. fumigatus and A. terreus than to the A. nidulans cluster (t = 3.13,
P < 0.01).

Discussion
Our systematic genomic searches for duplicated AF cluster
homologs followed by correlation analysis revealed seven
putative gene modules: aflA/aflB, aflR/aflS, aflX/aflY, aflF/
aflE, aflT/aflQ, aflC/aflW, and aflG/aflL. Not all the genes
in these modules are contiguous across all five Aspergillus
species. The strong correlation observed among noncontiguous members of gene modules that are sometimes
separated by more than 30 kb is consistent with vertical
transmission but argues against horizontal transfer, which
would require a simultaneous transfer of unlinked copies
to all species, a highly unlikely event. Further evidence in
support of vertical transmission is the report of putative
homologs of AF genes in the pine needle pathogen, Dothistroma septosporum (previously known as D. pini; [42,43])
and in the plant pathogen, Cercospora nicotianae [44].
Among the putative AF orthologs identified in D. septosporum, the gene with the highest percent amino acid identity, dotA, shows 80% similarity to aflM of A. parasiticus
[42,43]. In C. nicotianae, the CRG1 N-terminus zinc finger
motif is homologous to the zinc finger domains of various
regulatory proteins, including aflR of Aspergillus species
[44]. The existence of aflM and aflR homologs in two ascomycete classes (Dothideomycetes and Eurotiomycetes)
further argues against horizontal gene transfer and suggests that high sequence identity is the result of descent
from a common ancestor and strong purifying selection.
It has been long proposed that metabolic gene clusters
may be transferred horizontally between organisms

[45,46]; however, direct experimental evidence that horizontal gene transfer maintains clustering in fungi is lacking. The phylogenetic evidence in support of horizontal
gene transfer is also weak. In fact, phylogenetic analysis of
polyketide synthases among fungal species indicates that
gene duplications and losses can explain the data equally
well and there is no need to invoke horizontal gene transfer [47]. Our comparative analyses suggest that intragenomic reorganization followed by vertical descent and
gene loss is a more plausible mechanism and may explain
the variation in chemotype profiles for different Aspergillus
species. For example, A. nomius and A. bombycis produce
both B and G aflatoxins whereas A. flavus synthesizes predominantly B aflatoxins. Species producing only B aflatoxins may have evolved due to the loss of genes required
for the synthesis of G aflatoxins [10]. Specifically, aflU,
which is missing or nonfunctional in A. flavus isolates,
may be important in G aflatoxin production since the disruption of aflU in A. parasiticus results in the production
of only B aflatoxins [10]. Indeed, the location of the AF
cluster in the telomeric region of A. nidulans, A. flavus and
A. oryzae would facilitate gene loss as well as recombina-

tion, DNA inversions, partial deletions, translocations
and other genomic rearrangements [39,48-50].
Comparative analysis of complete and partial AF clusters
across five Aspergillus species revealed a striking modular
organization of pathway genes. We hypothesize that gene
modules that are contiguous in one species and noncontiguous in others are the result of rearrangements in an
ancestral species. For example, four cluster genes separate
aflG and aflL in A. nidulans whereas aflG and aflL are contiguous in section Flavi gene clusters. If aflG and aflL
underwent reorganization in the evolution of section Flavi
species from an ancestor with a cluster configuration similar to A. nidulans, this suggests that the arrangement of
aflG and aflL in the cluster does not determine whether ST
or AF is synthesized. Indeed, A. ochraceoroseus has a cluster
configuration very similar to A. nidulans and can synthesize both ST and AF [23]. Furthermore, gene modules
need not be contiguous or clustered to remain functional.
For example, an aflR duplicate that resides outside the
cluster in some A. parasiticus strains has been reported to
regulate AF biosynthesis [51], and aflR in the cluster can

Page 8 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:111

control the expression of other genes within the genome
[52]. In contrast, aflD is not expressed at native levels
when moved outside of the A. parasiticus cluster, indicating that clustering does play an important role in regulating the expression of some AF biosynthetic genes [53].
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain clustering in fungal genomes. Clustering can be a means of optimizing coregulation of genes, although clustering is not a
prerequisite for coregulation as evidenced by the discovery of global regulatory genes of secondary metabolite
clusters in Aspergillus spp. [54,55]; conversely, regulatory
genes contained within gene clusters can control the
expression of other genes outside of the clusters [52].
Selection acting on the cluster itself has also been invoked
to explain the presence of gene clusters. In this case, the
selection is independent of the selective advantage that
the products of the pathway confer on the host organism
[45]. This "selfish cluster" hypothesis postulates that horizontal gene transfer is an important mechanism for propagating and maintaining gene clusters in eukaryotes,
reminiscent of the "selfish operon" hypothesis proposed
in prokaryotes [56]. Other hypotheses postulate coadaptation and possibly gene duplication and differentiation
as driving forces in gene cluster evolution [56].
Several mechanisms may have been important in the evolution and retention of AF gene modules. Gene modules
may have arisen from duplications of a single gene
whereby the copy retained the function of the pre-duplication gene, as observed with the nor reductase genes, aflF/
aflE [17]. Alternatively, gene modules may have undergone subfunctionalization in which copies partition the
ancestral function, as with the fatty acid synthases, aflA/
aflB [57,58]. Other gene modules comprise genes that
augment a specific pathway function, as exemplified by
aflR/aflS, the pathway-specific transcription activator and
enhancer [59], and aflX/aflY, the genes required for the
conversion of versicolorin A to demethylsterigmatocystin
[60]. The functional relationships among genes in noncontiguous modules aflT/aflQ and aflC/aflW are unknown
but could include neofunctionalization, an adaptive process in which a completely new function has evolved for
the duplicated copy. In addition to these localized gene
duplication events, we cannot rule out a whole-genome
duplication in an Aspergillus ancestor; conclusive evidence
for this will require further analysis of gene duplicates
among several genomes [61].
Adaptive processes may extend beyond gene modules to
entire clusters of genes. We hypothesize that gene cluster
evolution was driven by selection for new chemotypes, in
this case, OMST and AF from an ST ancestor. If AF gene
clusters evolved by the reorganization and recruitment of
additional genes in an ST ancestor, then partial clusters

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/111

synthesizing intermediate compounds might represent
the earliest or ancestral clusters. Are the partial clusters
identified in A. fumigatus and A. terreus functional and are
they the building blocks for larger clusters? Phylogenetic
studies with sufficient taxon sampling suggest that A.
fumigatus and A. terreus are ancestral to section Flavi
[24,62]. Both A. fumigatus and A. terreus have the aflA/aflB
gene modules and partial clusters of five genes: aflC, aflS,
aflR, aflX and aflY. It has been speculated that a partial
cluster consisting of aflC, aflR, aflS, aflA, and aflB would
have allowed an Aspergillus ancestor to stabilize the
polyketide to an anthraquinone [16]. Anthraquinones are
colorful polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that accumulate in spores and may aid in their dispersal via arthropods
and protection from predation [16]. Spore dispersal
would impart increasing selective pressures on fungi to
synthesize an arsenal of polyketide derivatives to facilitate
the colonization of diverse and sometimes hostile environments. Indeed, our estimates of mean Ka/Ks values
were significantly higher in section Flavi than in non-section Flavi species, indicating increased positive selection
acting on genes in OMST and AF clusters relative to the ST
cluster in A. nidulans and partial clusters in A. fumigatus
and A. terreus.
Overall Ka/Ks ratios for AF homologs were less than one
for both section Flavi and non-section Flavi species, indicating an ongoing process of purifying selection acting to
eliminate mutations that have deleterious effects on
chemotype biosynthesis. Our estimates of Ka/Ks were consistent with values reported by Ehrlich and coworkers in
AF and ST clusters [39]. Within section Flavi, our microevolutionary analyses in A. parasiticus [40] suggest that the
most recent common ancestor (MRCA) either produced
high levels of G1 relative to B1 or was an OMST producer.
Since no species is known to produce only G aflatoxins, a
more likely hypothesis is that the MRCA of section Flavi
was a B and G aflatoxin producer and that selection has
been acting on the G1/B1 ratio. One possible MRCA is A.
nomius, a clear outgroup to section Flavi species that produces both B and G aflatoxins [63,64]. Another possibility
is the unnamed taxon, which can also synthesize B and G
aflatoxins [39]. The differences in aflatoxins produced by
different species most likely represent a complex process
that involves purifying and positive selection acting on a
B and G producing ancestor; specific demographic, environmental and/or evolutionary processes in populations
that maintain or break down AF gene clusters; and the
actions of specific genes that are involved in AF pathway
regulation [52] or other global regulatory genes of secondary metabolite clusters [54,55]. If the AF cluster arose from
rearrangements of gene and/or gene modules in an ancestral Aspergillus species, then the signature of cluster reorganization may still be evident in descendent species.
Preliminary analysis of molecular variation in the afla-

toxin gene cluster of A. parasiticus [40] provides evidence
for cluster reorganization from an ST ancestor, as well as
evidence for recombination, balancing selection and
chemotype-specific adaptation.

Conclusion
Based on correlation and cluster analyses of AF gene cluster duplicates across five Aspergillus species, we inferred
seven gene modules: aflA/aflB, aflR/aflS, aflX/aflY, aflF/
aflE, aflT/aflQ, aflC/aflW, and aflG/aflL. Our definition of
a module includes the possibility that genes may become
separated after their duplication and we hypothesize that
differences in gene order between AF and ST clusters may
be the result of gene reorganization in an ST ancestor.
Gene duplication and vertical transmission appear to be
the driving forces in the evolution and retention of AF
gene modules across all five Aspergillus species. Gene modules may arise from duplications of a single gene, whereby
the copy retains the function of the pre-duplication gene
(aflF/aflE) or partitions the ancestral function (aflA/aflB).
Alternatively, the duplicated copy may simply augment or
supplement a specific pathway function (aflR/aflS and
aflX/aflY) or evolve a completely new function as exemplified with aflT/aflQ and aflC/aflW. Significantly higher
mean Ka/Ks values in section Flavi compared to non-section Flavi species is evidence of adaptation and increased
positive selection acting on genes in OMST and AF clusters
relative to the ST cluster in A. nidulans and partial clusters
in A. fumigatus and A. terreus. Whether patterns of gene
duplication and modularity in the aflatoxin gene cluster
are further influenced by evolutionary processes in populations that maintain or break down AF gene clusters are
unknown and an important area of further research.

Methods
AF homologs in Aspergillus
Genes were considered orthologous if they satisfied the
following criteria: 1) at least two genes were syntenic, 2)
the genes were the best reciprocal TBLASTN and TBLASTX
hits with an E-value less than 10-8, and 3) the genes
showed amino acid similarities of approximately 40% or
greater and at least 70% of the amino acids could be
aligned to the reference sequence. Results from BLAST
searches were further parsed to determine if cluster genes
were single copy or duplicated. The total number of putative gene copies within each genome was determined
using the above criteria with two exceptions: 1) reciprocal
BLAST hits were not performed, and 2) an E-value less
than 10-20 was used when there was more than one copy
to decrease the number of false positives.
Gene modules
We identified as modules any group of two AF cluster
genes that are highly correlated (P < 0.05; 0.8 <r2<1)
across the five Aspergillus genomes. We assessed correla-

tion and clustering using Kendall's coefficient of concordance implemented in the R statistical package [65]. This
was followed by a series of F-tests to test the null hypothesis of no relationship between each pair of highly correlated genes [66]. Significance thresholds were Bonferronicorrected by dividing by the total number of tests performed.
Species-specific adaptation
Phylogenetic studies support a basal placement of A. nidulans and A. terreus relative to A. fumigatus and section
Flavi species [24,62]. Because all species in section Flavi
share a recent common ancestor and are related to nonsection Flavi species by an underlying phylogeny, we cannot assume independence among species with respect to
their Ka/Ks values. We therefore tested whether there was
a difference in mean Ka/Ks values between AF cluster
homologs in section Flavi versus non-section Flavi species
by constructing a linear model to account for variation
between genes. This model can be written as Ka/Ks = mean
of all Ka/Ks values + gene effect + species effect + error.

We tested the null hypothesis that there is no difference in
mean Ka/Ks between species in section Flavi and non-section Flavi by computing and testing arbitrary species contrasts. For example, a contrast of the form c(-3,5,5,-3,-3,3,-3,5) where the species order is A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A.
nidulans, A. nomius, A. oryzae, A. parasiticus partial cluster,
A. parasiticus, and A. terreus would compare the mean Ka/
Ks of the section Flavi species with the mean Ka/Ks of the
non-section Flavi species. In the above contrast, all species
in section Flavi are assigned the same numerical value (-3)
and non-section Flavi species are given a different number
(5) such that the sum of both groups in the contrast is zero
(-3 × 5 + 5 × 3). Contrasts were computed using the
fit.contrast function implemented by Gregory R. Warnes
in the gmodels package in R [67]. The function returns a
matrix containing the estimated regression coefficients,
standard errors, t-values and two-sided P-values. A significant test result may indicate a difference in selective constraints on amino acid substitutions or adaptive evolution
between the two species groups.
