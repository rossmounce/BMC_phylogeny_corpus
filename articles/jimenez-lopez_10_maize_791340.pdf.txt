The maize ALDH protein superfamily: linking
structural features to functional specificities
Jose C Jimenez-Lopez1,5, Emma W Gachomo2, Manfredo J Seufferheld3, Simeon O Kotchoni4*

Abstract
Background: The completion of maize genome sequencing has resulted in the identification of a large number of
uncharacterized genes. Gene annotation and functional characterization of gene products are important to uncover
novel protein functionality.
Results: In this paper, we identify, and annotate members of all the maize aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene
superfamily according to the revised nomenclature criteria developed by ALDH Gene Nomenclature Committee
(AGNC). The maize genome contains 24 unique ALDH sequences encoding members of ten ALDH protein families
including the previously identified male fertility restoration RF2A gene, which encodes a member of mitochondrial
class 2 ALDHs. Using computational modeling analysis we report here the identification, the physico-chemical
properties, and the amino acid residue analysis of a novel tunnel like cavity exclusively found in the maize sterility
restorer protein, RF2A/ALDH2B2 by which this protein is suggested to bind variably long chain molecular ligands
and/or potentially harmful molecules.
Conclusions: Our finding indicates that maize ALDH superfamily is the most expanded of plant ALDHs ever
characterized, and the mitochondrial maize RF2A/ALDH2B2 is the only plant ALDH that harbors a newly defined
pocket/cavity with suggested functional specificity.

Background
Endogenous aldehyde molecules are intermediates/byproducts of several fundamental metabolic pathways [1],
and are also produced in response to environmental
stresses including salinity, dehydration, desiccation, cold,
and heat shock [2,3]. Although indispensable to biological processes, they are however toxic in excessive physiological concentrations [4]. The damaging effects of
aldehydes and derivatives of aldehyde molecules, which
include cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity,
have been well studied in human, bacteria and fungi
[4,5]. Therefore, cellular levels of aldehydes must be
regulated to ensure normal developmental growth
processes.
Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) constitute a large
family of NAD(P)+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the
irreversible oxidation of a wide range of reactive aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids [2]. In

additions, ALDHs have been shown to indirectly detoxify cellular ROS and reduced the effect of lipid peroxidation mediated cellular toxicity under drought and salt
stress [6]. ALDHs are found in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. With the genome of more organisms being
fully sequenced, the numbers of ALDH genes identified
have lately increased [1,4,7,8]. However, relatively few
studies have been conducted on the corresponding plant
enzymes and specifically on maize-ALDHs.
The availability of recently sequenced maize genome
[9] has provided an avenue for gene discovery, functional and comparative genomics studies. This avails a
basis for a close investigation into phylogenetic analysis
and structural features of all maize ALDHs compared to
other well characterized plant ALDHs. Criteria for unified ALDH nomenclature have been well established by
the ALDH Gene Nomenclature Committee (AGNC)
[10]. Based upon these criteria, protein sequences with
more than 40% identity to a previously identified ALDH
sequence represent a family, and sequences with more
than 60% identity within the ALDH family represent a
protein subfamily [10]. We present here a revised and

unified nomenclature for the maize ALDH superfamily
according to AGNC criteria [10].
Some plants express mitochondrial genes that cause
cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), however, nuclear
genes that disrupt the accumulation of the corresponding mitochondrial gene products can restore fertility to
such plants. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that is
observed in more than 150 higher plant species including maize. The hybrid vigor in higher plants depends on
the use of CMS, which is characterized by the absence
of functional pollen. CMS is a useful system for commercial F1 hybrid breeding programs. In maize the male
sterility is caused by a Texas cytoplasm-specific mitochondrial gene (CMS-T), T-URF13 that encodes a
13 kDa URF13 protein [11]. The dominant alleles for
fertility restoration (RF) RF1 and RF2 (also known as
RF2A) have been shown to work together to restore the
URF13-mediated sterility [12,13]. Although many mitochondrial genes associated with CMS have been characterized, the identification and characterization of RF
genes has proven elusive, and only the maize RF2A,
which encodes a mitochondrial ALDH, ALDH2B2, is
the most well characterized RF gene so far [12,13]. Up
to date, the mechanism by which URF13 causes male
sterility in maize is not known, and the functional features of male sterility restorer, RF2A/ALDH2B2, is completely unknown. In addition, the maize line carrying
Texas male sterile cytoplasm is highly susceptible to
southern corn leaf blight, one of the worst plant disease
caused by Cochliobolus heterostrophus race T, which
produces a polyketide T-toxin, a determinant of the fungal virulence. Using computational modeling, we have
identified a novel tunnel like shape ligand binding cavity
in the male sterility restorer, RF2A/ALDH2B2 protein of
maize. Computational modeling is a powerful tool to
predict protein structures, functions and protein-protein
or protein-ligand interactions. Domain organization of
proteins is an intrinsic element of protein structure and
functionality. Therefore, understanding the domain
organizations of proteins is a prerequisite to efficiently
manipulating and predicting the folding structure mediating functionality. The specific biochemical pathway(s)
of plant ALDHs is an area of considerable interest. To
better understand the roles of RF2A/ALDH2B2, we
explore in detail the structural features of the maize
RF2A/ALDH2B2 tunnel like cavity and discuss here it
functional relevance compared to other members of
maize ALDH families.

Results
The maize ALDH gene superfamily: revised nomenclature
and phylogenetic analysis

The release of maize genome sequence provides a powerful tool for identification and functional characterization

of genes. Here, we have searched the entire maize genome [9] and assigned ALDH nomenclature to identified
maize genes based on sequence similarity of deduced
amino acids to previously characterized ALDH genes
(Table 1). To ensure the accuracy of the sequences used
in the maize ALDH gene superfamily identification, we
used ALDH conserved motifs, ALDH active sites and
ALDH defined family criteria (as detailed in the Materials
and Methods) and the Arabidopsis ALDH gene superfamily [7] as database search queries. We verified all annotated maize ALDH open reading frames (ORFs) by
comparing them to the cDNA and EST sequences. The
search resulted in the identification of 24 unique ALDH
sequences encoding members of ten ALDH protein
families (Table 1), two of which (family 2: ALDH2B1,
ALDH2B2; family 11: ALDH11A3) have been previously
identified [14]. Compared to other well characterized
plant ALDHs, maize-ALDH gene superfamily is the most
expanded with 24 vs. 21 genes in rice [15]; 20 genes in
moss [8]; 8 genes in algae [8]; and 14 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana [7]. Five (ALDH2: 6genes; ALDH3: 5 genes;
ALDH5: 2 genes; ALDH10: 3 genes; ALDH18: 3 genes)
out of the ten ALDH families are represented by multiple
ALDH gene members (Table 1), while the remaining five
families (6; 7; 11; 12; 22) are represented by a single
ALDH gene copy (Table 1). As expected, the phylogenetic
analysis showed that Z. mays ALDH sequences are more
closely related to Oryza sativa (Figure 1) and A. thaliana,
than to P. patens and C. reinhardtii ALDHs (Figure 2),
with ADLH23 and ALDH24 found only in P. patens and
C. reinhardtii genome respectively, and C. reinhardtii
lacking the ALDH3 and ALDH7 gene families (Figure 2).
A phylogenetic analysis of maize ALDH sequences with
other putative plant ALDHs revealed that plant ALDHs
are split into four clades and maize-ALDHs share common core plant ALDH families (ALDH2, ALDH3,
ALDH5, ALDH6, ALDH7, ALDH10, ALDH11, ALDH12
and ALDH22) (Table 2; Figure 2).
Structural characterization of maize sterility restorer,
RF2A, a member of class 2 ALDHs

Despite the important role of ALDHs in plant sterility
restoration, and environmental stress responses, only
two reported crystal structures of ALDH proteins from
Pisum sativum have been deposited in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) database up to date. In order to understand
the functional mechanism of ALDH2B2/RF2A mediating
male sterility restoration and other functions in maize,
we analyzed in detail the conformational features of
maize ALDH2B2 using computational biology. We
obtained the best predicted model of the maize RF2A/
ALDH2B2, a mitochondrial associated protein, based on
the ten best structural templates and the crystal structures of mitochondrial ALDHs from different organisms

deposited in the Protein Database (Figure 3). To better
understand the boundary of the catalytic, the cofactor
and the oligomerization domains of the protein, we
colored coded the corresponding domains, and highlighted the predicted amino acids Cys311 and Glu278,
which drive the ALDH reaction with the aldehyde substrate (Figure 3) [16,17]. The quality of the modeled
protein was estimated by the C-score values generated
by I-TASSER software, which reflects the coverage parameters in the structural simulations and the sequence
alignment with the template. C-score is a confidence
scoring function to assessing the quality of a prediction
and estimate the accuracy of the I-TASSER software
predictions, which is based on the quality of the threading alignments and the convergence of I-TASSERâs

structural assembly refinement simulations. Typically, a
good predicted model is obtained when the estimated
level of confidence (C-score) is between -5 and 2. The
quality of the modeled protein as revealed by the
C-score of 1.58 and the percentage identity with the
protein template (Table 3) is good, because this value/
level of confidence (C-score) ranges between -5 and 2,
which is the limit of the acceptable structural model
prediction. The level of confidence for all our predicted
maize ALDH models were in the range of -0.08 to 1.58
(Table 3), indicating that the protein structures were
constructed with high accuracy. Other parameters like
TM-score and root mean square deviation (RMSD) were
used to check the topology and structural similarity of
the models [18]. For ALDH2B2/RF2A, both parameters

were scored as 0.94 Â± 0.06 and 4.0 Â± 2.7Ã respectively.
TM-score is used to assess the topological similarity of
two protein structures, while RMSD is the measure of
average distance between the backbones of superimposed proteins. The RMSD values of the predicted models and the templates although highly variable despite
significant sequence similarity between them (Table 3)
are not unusual. They are indeed in the normal range of
accepted RMSD values. These values however, can be
drastically reduced if the modelled proteins are made
from crystallized maize ALDH structures. Unfortunately,
there is no single crystallized maize ALDH protein
up-to-date. The accepted models were then made
from other organismal ALDH templates as indicated in
Table 3. The biological usefulness of the predicted protein models relies on the accuracy of the structural prediction. For example, high-resolution models with
RMSD values in the range of 1-3 Ã are typically generated by the crystallized model (CM) using close homologous templates. Medium-resolution models, roughly
in the RMSD range of 3-7 Ã are typically generated
from distant homologous templates. Even models with
the lowest resolution but still with a correct topology
predicted by either ab initio approaches or based on
weak hits from threading, have a number of useful
information including protein domain boundary identification, topology recognition and family/superfamily
assignment.

The general structure of ALDH2B2/RF2A shows the
typical common strands and helices in the Rossmann
folding type depicted in different views (Figure 4A). In
order to study the specific domain structures, we examined the conservational residue pattern of the surface as
well as the active pocket of the protein. The most variable surface residues (depicted in blue) are on the periphery of ALDH2B2/RF2A and the conserved residues
(depicted in purple) located in the core of the protein
structures (Figure 4B). Generally, residues that are
implicated in the biological processes such as proteinprotein and protein-ligand interactions are solvent
accessible, and residues implicated in protein structure
and folding stability are located in the core of the protein. Our findings revealed that maize ALDH2B2/RF2Acoenzyme pocket is highly conserved, while the surface
of the opposite side of the pocket is highly variable
(Figure 4B).
The structural comparison of maize ALDH2B2/RF2A
with other mitochondrial ALDH orthologs allowed us to
further validate the accuracy of the modeled maize
ALDH2B2/RF2A. We performed a structural superimposition of the maize ALDH2B2/RF2A with crystallized
mitochondrial ALDH2B2 from different organisms
(human and bovine). The structural protein superimposition (Figure 4C), reveals very little structural deviations
(RMSD <0.515Ã). However, the noticeable structural
differences were located mainly in the tail of the N-term

small differences in some 2 D structural elements
(Figure 4C). In summary, the global topology was quite
similar to the crystallized proteins, indicating that the
modeled ZmALDH2B2/RF2A reflects the crystal-like
structure, and represents the most accurate structure of
the protein ever reported (Table 3).
We next explored and generated the electrostatic surface potentials of maize ALDH2B2/RF2A. We examined
the surface charge distribution in this protein using the

Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) package [19]
as shown in Figure 5. The depicted colors indicate the
different surface properties, with red representing negative charge, blue positive and white neutral (Figure 5). To
further present a detailed view of ZmALDH2B2/RF2A
surface properties, we showed the data in six surface
plots/views, which correspond to rotations around the
vertical (Z) axis (lateral views; front and back views) and
the horizontal (X) axis (top and bottom views) (Figure 5).

of ZmALDH2B2/RF2A is negative (Figure 5) as indicated
by the color coded pattern. However, positively charged
amino acids were observed along the surface, and a visible positive region around the cofactor cleft region, and
the interface between the coenzyme and catalytic domain
are clearly observed (Figure 5).
Sorting out ZmALDH2B2/RF2A structural features

Pocket/cavities mapping analysis of ZmALDH2B2/RF2A
revealed different interesting features (Figure 6A). For the
first time we provide here the anatomy of the catalytic
clefts, the ligand-binding pockets and the structural

tunnels of ZmALDH2B2/RF2A. As shown in Figure 6(A,
B), we detected various hidden specific pockets in
ZmALDH2B2. The structural variability of these pockets
reflects the multifunctionality features of ZmALDH2B2.
The ALDHs have been reported to have variable conformations between non-homologous proteins just like the
ligand molecules, but it is also possible that the shapes of
different protein binding pockets that bind the same ligand
vary [20]. Comparative residue analyses of conserved
NADP+-dependent binding sites with those of well characterized/crystallized ALDH structures are crucial for the
prediction of cofactor specificity and enzymatic

mechanism. In well characterized/crystallized ALDHs,
there is always a conserved Glu residue (whose position
varies according to individual protein sequences) located
on the opposite side of another conserved Cys residue at
the NAD ring cavity formation. These residues are known
to be implicated in proton abstraction from a Cys residue
during the ALDH biochemical reaction. Our computational modeling predicted that Glu and Cys residues
were respectively positioned at 278 and 312 in the
ZmALDH2B2/RF2A primary protein sequence (Figure 6A).
The RF2A protein has a broad substrate spectrum
including aliphatic long chain and aromatic aldehydes
[7]. mtALDHs typically have many potential substrates
[21]. So far, the task of determining the specific aldehyde(s) substrate of RF2A that must be oxidized during
fertility restoration is particularly challenging. Biochemical approaches to defining this substrate are complicated by the fact that mutants of the RF2 gene exert

their effects on male fertility (at least in T cytoplasm
maize) in only a single internal cell layer of the anther
(i.e., the tapetum). To overcome the limitation of biochemical and genetic approach and verify the ability of
RF2A to oxidize a broad substrate spectrum including
aliphatic long chain aldehydes, we here used computational biology to address this crucial question. We next
sought to uncover some hidden structural features of
ZmALDH2B2/RF2A mediating other functions. To do
so, we carried out a detailed anatomic analysis of the
entire pockets/cavities (with the exception of NAD(P)binding cavity). We here focused our attention on
the geometry of ligand-binding sites to predict and
unravel possible hidden ligand binding properties of
ZmALDH2B2/RF2A. We first hypothesized that if
ZmALDH2B2/RF2A mediating male sterility restoration
is dependent on specific protein structural features,
these features will only be found in ZmALDH2B2/

RF2A, owing to the fact that ZmALDH2B2/RF2A is the
only plant ALDH known to play such function. Interestingly, we found that ZmALDH2B2/RF2A has a tunnellike structure (Figure 6B) made of two continuous
cavities, which are big enough to hold various ligands
and possibly allows other reactions than aldedehyde
dehydrogenase activity. If this tunnel-like structure is
critical for male sterility restoration, we expected this
structure to be absent in other ALDH protein families
that lack this functions. To verify our hypothesis, we
analyzed the volume and the interactive properties of
the ligand binding regions of pockets/cavities from different members of rice and maize ALDH superfamily
(Figure 7). An average of 9 pockets were found in individual ALDH structures analyzed across species (Figure
7A, D, E, F, G, H, I). However, only ZmALDH2B2/
RF2A has a very spacious tunnel-like cavity as revealed
by its large calculated volume (1292Ã 3 ) (Figure 6B,
Figure 7B, C). In addition, we calculated/predicted and
proposed possible ligands that could bind to the
described cavities (Figure 7). Our data revealed the
uniqueness of the ZmALDH2B2/RF2A tunnel characteristics. The amino acids sequence analysis (Figure 6B,
Figure 7B, C) showed that the tunnel is predominantly
composed of hydrophobic and neutral amino acids
(72%), with only 28% of charged amino acids. We

postulate that together with its ALDH activity, RF2A/
ZmALDH2B2 is the only maize ALDH candidate that can
hold a big molecule/ligand of hydrophobic characteristic
in its unique and large tunnel. In summary we here provide direct structural evidence that ZmALDH2B2/RF2A
has a specific tunnel-like cavity not found in other
ALDHs, through which this protein could bind to various
molecular ligands mediating other function.
Functional relevance of RF2A/ALDH2B2 tunnel like cavity

The polyketide T-toxin produced by Cochliobolus heterostrophus has been shown to bind the plant protein,
URF13 causing the formation of pores in the inner
membrane of mitochondria [22] and leakage of NAD+
along with other solutes hindering normal mitochondria
function [23]. The interaction between URF13 and the
polyketide from the fungus leads to southern corn leaf
blight disease susceptibility. Due to the spacious volume
and the physic-chemical property of RF2A/ALDH2B2
tunnel like cavity, we hypothesized that it might be
involved in long chain molecule and or polyketide
T-toxin (PKT) sequestration. To test our hypothesis, we
compared the physico-chemical properties of RF2A/
ALDH2B2 tunnel like cavity with well characterized
PKT binding sites in various organisms [24]. The structural models of various iterative PKT domains or

sequence stretches that can potentially control the size
and extent of unsaturated substrates were then analyzed.
In addition, the cavity lining residues (CLRs) and cavity
volumes of the active pocket sites were analyzed. This
allowed us to correlate the cavity volume and hydrophobicity of the active pocket sites to the number of iterations and the degree of unsaturation of the polyketide
products they can hold (Figure 8A). Since T-toxin is a
reducing PKS having a greater proportion of saturated
carbons [24], we hypothesized that the physico-chemical
property of the cavity sequesting T-toxin will be more
hydrophobic in order to accommodate the higher proportion of saturated carbon chain of T-toxin molecule.
Indeed hydrophobicity cavity lining residues analysis
revealed a higher degree of hydrophobicity of the amino
acid residues integreting the RF2A/ALDH2B2 tonnellike cavity structure as expected (Figure 8B). However,
polyketides can contain several hydroxyl groups and
some times unsaturated double bonds that required

some levels of hydrophilic property to chemically fit
into the cavity. Consistant to this characteristic, we
observed also distinct but relatively suttle region of
hydrophilic property certainly required for the accomodation of the carbonyl groups of T-toxin molecule
(Figure 8B). It is known that smallest cavities (300Ã3)
belong to the MSAS type PKSs that perform three iterations [24]. Intermediate sized cavities (800Ã3) belong to
the napthopyrone (NAP) like PKSs that iterate from five
to eight times [24]. The largest cavities, 1780Ã3, were
observed for the T-Toxin models, which perform 20
iterations with the ligands [24]. As shown in Figure 6B,
the RF2A/ALDH2B2 tunnel like cavity falls into the
large volume cavity group with its estimated volume of
1292Ã3. Furthermore, the amino acid residue analysis
(Figure 8B) and the physical property of RF2A/
ALDH2B2 tunnel cavity correlate perfectly with the
characteristic of T-toxin interactive pocket site, suggesting indeed that RF2A/ALD2B2 might be able to bind/

annotated [25], completion of this daunting task is paramount importance in order to elucidate the structural
features of individual proteins to gain insights into their
functional interaction network. In this study, we identified, annotated, and provided for the first time detailed
structural features of selected members of maize ALDH
protein families. ALDH proteins play essential roles in
metabolic pathways that are critical for development
and response to environmental changes [6]. Using the
phylogenetic analysis we uncovered the functional and
evolutionary relationship of maize ALDH protein superfamily with those of rice, Arabidopsis, moss and algae.
Although the evolutionary relationships of ALDHs have
been the focus of extensive studies [7,14], detailed functional characterization of maize ALDH proteins has
never been investigated. The maize genome database
contains 24 genes encoding members of 10 ALDH gene
families (Table 1), which are also represented in other
angiosperm plants including rice, poplar and grape [26].
Maize-ALDH gene superfamily is the most expanded of
plant ALDHs ever characterized. A partial explanation
for so many maize ALDH genes is probably the need
to provide ALDH activity in various subcellular compartments. Although some aldehydes (e.g. acetaldehyde)
are able to move from one subcellular compartment to
another, the molecular sizes of others preclude their
passive diffusion across membranes. This probably justifies the presence of multiple organelle-specific ALDHs
identified not only in maize (Table 1), but also in rice
[15], Arabidopsis [7] and other plant species [8]. The
phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that maize and rice
ALDHs split up into ten protein families (Figure 1), confirming that these two plant species are indeed monocots. When compared to other plant species, the
evolutionary relationships could not be traced to the 10
protein family clades. Instead, they are split into four
major clades (Figure 2), revealing some interesting
observations; ALDH families 2, 5 and 10 seem to cluster
together, suggesting that these families probably
diverged from a common ancestor. Finally, the predicted
cytosolic and mitochondrial ALDH forms in family 2
can be clearly separated from each other. This is in
accordance with results of recently characterized
ALDH2 genes from Arabidopsis and rice [7].
Although the Arabidopsis genome sequence has provided a major key for the identification of crucial genes
in plants, the functions of grass-specific genes need to
be elucidated to gain genetic control of biomass yield,
environmental stress response, and quality in food crops
[27]. Using computational biology, we attempted in this
paper to uncover for the first time some hidden structural features of maize RF2A/ALDH2B2 gene product, a
member of family 2 ALDH proteins. Class 2 maize
ALDH2B2/RF2A was the first plant ALDH ever

characterized [28]. RF2A encodes a nuclear restorer of
cytoplasmic male sterility [28,29] and functions in concert with RF1 to restore CMS in maize. Although RF2
proteins have been identified and characterized from
various organisms, the mechanistic process of maize
RF2A/ALDH2B2 sterility restoration is unknown. The
Texas (T) cytoplasm male-sterile (T-CMS) maize had
never attracted attention until the occurrence of southern corn leaf blight disease in 1972 [30] caused by a
host selective toxin (T-toxin) produced by Cochliobolus
heterostrophus (race T). T-CMS maize is highly sensitive
to T-toxin of C. heterostrophus [31]. In T-CMS maize,
the genomes of T cytoplasm mitochondria contain a
single mitochondrial gene encoding for URF13 protein.
URF13 accumulates in the inner membrane of the mitochondria [11,32] causing T-CMS maize to be sensitive
to T-toxin. In addition, URF13 severely affects the tapetal cell layer of the anthers, which undergo a premature
degeneration at the early microspore stage, resulting in
pollen abortion [13]. Genetic and kinetic studies of the
maize mitochondrial ALDHs reveal two RF2 proteins (i.
e. RF2A and RF2B), and indicate that these two enzymes
have similar, but non-identical substrates. The RF2A
protein has a broad substrate spectrum including longchain aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes,
whereas RF2B can oxidize only short-chain aliphatic
aldehydes [33]. Interestingly, these two mitochondrial
ALDHs do not accumulate in the same tissues or at the
same times [33]. It appears that plant mitochondrial
ALDHs have undergone functional specialization. This
is confirmed by the observation of specific structural
features that distinguish members of mitochondrial
ALDHs from each other (Figure 6B, Figure 7). To better
understand the functional specialization of mitochondrial maize ALDHs, we analyzed in detail all the structural pockets/cavities of RF2A in comparison with
various mitochondrial ALDH proteins from other plant
species. Our data revealed distinct structural features of
RF2A/ALDH2B2 that might mediate novel ligand binding or other functional specialization. Our structural
analysis clearly displayed the uniqueness of the maize
ALDH2B2/RF2A tunnel cavity (Figure 6B, Figure 7).
This tunnel-like structure can hold up medium and
long-chain aliphatic molecules that may be/are harmful
to the mitochondria. Amino acid sequence analysis of
the cavity revealed that this tunnel is made of neutral
and hydrophobic residues suitable for harboring big/
long lipophilic and hydrophobic molecules such as the
T-toxin (Figure 8B), although this interaction needs to
be experimentally tested.

Conclusion
We have identified for the first time all members of the
ALDH protein superfamily in maize; provided a revised,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/10/43

unified nomenclature for these ALDH proteins; analyze
the molecular relationship among maize ALDHs compared to other well characterized plant ALDHs. Our
computational modeling analysis revealed a spacious
tunnel like cavity in RF2A/ALDH2B2, a member of class
2 maize ALDHs, never reported before through which
this protein might functionally diverged from other
mitochondrial plant ALDHs. Our data suggested that
RF2A/ALDH2B2 might interact with long aliphatic
chain molecules and other harmful substrates/molecules
through its tunnel like cavity to prevent their detrimental effects on mitochondrial organelles.

patens and C. Reinhardtii were created in ClustalW
v1.81 [40] using the Gonnet protein weight matrix, multiple alignment gap opening/extension penalties of 10/
0.5 and pairwise gap opening/extension penalties of 10/
0.1. These alignments were adjusted using Bioedit
V7.0.5.3 [41]. The unreliable portions of the sequence in
the alignment were eliminated. Phylogenetic trees were
generated by neighbor-joining (NJ). The estimation of
the phylogeny topology of the branches was tested with
1000 bootstrap replicates using the neighbor-joining
method. Maize and rice tree was visualized with Treeview v.0.5.0 [42] and the more expanded tree composed
of Z. mays, O. sativa, A. thaliana, P. patens and C. Reinhardtii ALDHs was visualized with Treedyn 198.3 [43].

ALDH sequences search and bioinformatics

Previously identified Arabidopsis- and rice-ALDH
sequences retrieved from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/, and rice genomic database (TIGR Rice Annotation
Release 4, http://blast.jcvi.org/euk-blast/index.cgi?project=osa1) were used to search for maize ALDH and ALDHlike DNA sequences from the maize genome release 4a.53
http://www.maizesequence.org[9] using BLASTX,
BLASTN and BLAST 2.2.24 release (low complexity filter;
and based on Blosum62 substitution matrix) [34,35].
Protein motifs of the identified maize-ALDHs were
queried using using the PROSITE release 20.66 [36],
Pfam 23.0 [37], CDD v2.25 (Conserved Domain Database) or CDART (Conserved Domain Architecture
Retrieval Tool) tools [38,39]. After the aboved databases
were run, the retrieved sequences were then double
checked using Pfam 00171 (ALDH family), PS00070
(ALDH cysteine active site), PS00687 (ALDH glutamic
acid active site), KOG2450 (aldehyde dehydrogenase),
KOG2451 (aldehyde dehydrogenase), KOG 2453 (aldehyde dehydrogenase) and KOG2456 (aldehyde dehydrogenase) for the identification domains for maize ALDH
protein superfamily. Putative functions were thereafter
assigned to predicted proteins based upon significant
similarity to functionally characterized proteins as priviously described [15].
The maize ALDH deduced polypeptides were then
annotated using criteria established by the ALDH Gene
Nomenclature Committee (AGNC) [10]. Based on
AGNC-annotation criteria, deduced amino acid
sequences that are more than 40% identical to other
previously identified ALDH sequences compose a family,
and sequences more than 60% identical compose a protein subfamily. Deduced amino acid sequences less than
40% identical would describe a new ALDH protein
family.

Protein modeling, molecular conservation and structural
analysis

To better understand the molecular mechanism of
ALDH2B2/RF2A mediated male fertility restoration in
cms-T, the deduced ZmALDH2B2 protein sequence was
modelled using the top 10 PDB closed templates structures by I-Tasser [44]. An initial structural model was
generated, and subjected to an energy minimization
procedure with GROMOS96 [45], implemented in DeepView/Swiss-PDB Viewer v3.7 [46] to reduce poor van der
Waals contacts and correct the stereochemistry of the
model. For each sequence analyzed, the quality of the
model produced was assessed by checking the protein
sterology using the PROCHECK v.3.5 [47] and the energy
was checked by ANOLEA [48]. The Ramachandran statistic plots were checked and main numbers of amino
acid residues in favorable regions were shown for all the
models.
The predicted organic binding site was based on the
identification of analogs with similar binding sites taking
into account their BS-scores, TM-scores (a scale for
measuring the structural similarity between two structures), IDEN (percentage sequence identity in the structurally aligned region), the coverage of the alignment by
TM-align, the COV of the model, and the structural
alignment (which is equal to the number of structurally
aligned residues divided by their length). A BS-score
value of > 0.5 signifies a binding site prediction with
high confidence. The ligand(s) in the analog structure
were then transferred onto the model and the fitness of
the ligand-model complex (BS-score) was calculated by
comparing the local structure and sequence similarity in
the binding site region.
The ConSurf conservation analysis (ConSurf v3.0) [49]
was made by evolutionary related conservation scores of
the residues for functional region identification from
proteins of known three dimensional structures. The
degree of conservation of the amino-acid sites among 50
close sequence homologues (Identification of functional

Jimenez-Lopez et al. BMC Structural Biology 2010, 10:43

regions by surface-mapping of phylogenetic information)
was estimated. The conservation grades were projected
onto the molecular surface of the proteins to reveal the
patches of highly conserved residues that are often
important for biological function.
Electrostatic Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) potentials were
obtained using APBS v1.2.0 [19] molecular modeling
software PyMol 0.99 (DeLano Scientific LLC) with ff99
forcefield of AMBER package [50] to assign the charges
and radii to all of the atoms (including hydrogens),
which were added and optimized with PDB 2PQR [51],
a Python software package that automates many of the
common tasks used to prepare structures for continuum
electrostatics calculations and provides a platform-independent tool for converting protein files in PDB format
to PQR format. Fine grid spacing of 0.35 Ã was used to
solve the linearized PB equation in sequential-focusing
multigrid calculations in a mesh of 161 points per
dimension at 300.00 K. Dielectric constants were 2 for
the protein and 80.00 for water. The output mesh was
processed in scalar OpenDX format to map the PB onto
the surfaces with PyMOL 0.99. Potential values are
given in units of kT per unit charge (k, Boltzmannâs
constant; T, temperature).
Pockets/cavities and tunnels were obtained using the
interaction energy between the protein and a van der
Waals probe. Favorable binding sites were located energetically, and clustered according to their spatial proximity, to be ranked according to the sum of interaction
energies for sites within each cluster [52].
Protein-ligand interaction sites prediction were calculated by binding hydrophobic (CH3) probes to the protein, and finding clusters of probes with the most
favorable binding energy [52]. To understand the physic-chemical characteristic of the amino acids integrating
the tunnel-like cavity in ZmALDH2B2, the hydrophobicities of amino acid sequence were plotted using the
kyte-Doolittle hydropathy prediction algorithm [53] by
using ProtScale, one of the tools located in the ExPASy
Proteomics Server. For this prediction a a window size
of 5 was used, and the region/domain of the tunnel-like
cavity are highlight in gray.
