Abstract
Background: Burkholderia thailandensis, a close relative of Burkholderia pseudomallei, has previously
been reported only from Southeast Asia and North America. It is biochemically differentiated from
B. pseudomallei by the ability to utilize arabinose. During the course of environmental sampling for
B. pseudomallei in the Northern Territory of Australia, an isolate, MSMB 43, was recovered that is
arabinose positive.
Results: Genetic analysis using 16S rDNA sequencing and DNA/DNA hybridization indicates that
MSMB 43 is most similar to B. thailandensis although multi-locus sequence typing indicates that this
isolate is divergent from both B. pseudomallei and other described B. thailandensis.
Conclusion: We report the isolation and initial characterization of strain MSMB 43, which is a B.
thailandensis-like isolate recovered in Australia.

Background
Burkholderia thailandensis is a less virulent close relative of
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis [1]. B. thailandensis can be differentiated biochemically
from B. pseudomallei by its ability to assimilate arabinose
[1,2]. During the course of environmental surveys for B.
pseudomallei in the rural region outside Darwin, Northern
Territory, Australia, an arabinose assimilating isolate, designated strain MSMB 43, was recovered from a bore water
source that also yielded B. pseudomallei from the same and
subsequent samples.

We report the initial characterization of a B. thailandensislike isolate, the first of its kind, in Australia. In this study
we characterize strain MSMB 43 using phenotypic tests,
16S rDNA gene sequencing, multi-locus sequence typing
(MLST), and DNA-DNA hybridization.

Results and Discussion
Standard biochemical testing, including arabinose assimilation, identified strain MSMB 43 as B. thailandensis.
However, MSMB 43 did not grow at 42°C and produced
little to no gas from nitrate [1,3]. A B. pseudomallei-specific
real-time PCR method targeting a gene in the type III
secretion system (TTS) was performed as previously

described. Strain MSMB 43 was negative by TTS real-time
PCR suggesting that it was not a B. pseudomallei [4].

llei could potentially trigger an unnecessary bioterrorism
investigation.

The accession numbers for the 16S rDNA sequences determined for strains MSMB 43 and Burkholderia thailandensis
ATCC 700388T are [GenBank: EF114404] and [GenBank:
EF535235] respectively. The 16S rDNA sequence of strain
MSMB 43 has 99.7% similarity and 98.9% identity to the
16S rDNA sequence of the B. thailandensis type strain. The
discrepancy between the % similarity and % identity is
due to multiple heterogeneous base calls in the sequence
for MSMB 43, probably resulting from differences in alleles of the 16S rDNA, which has been previously noted for
B. pseudomallei, but not in B. thailandensis [1,5].

Strain MSMB 43 appears distinct from B. thailandensis, B.
pseudomallei, and B. oklahomensis by analysis of MLST
sequences, but unexpectedly the percent DNA-DNA
hybridization is above the 70% threshold that fulfills part
of the current gold standard for species definition [12].

To characterize MSMB 43 further, we performed multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which uses the DNA
sequencing of defined segments of seven housekeeping
genes to determine strain relatedness [6]. Strain MSMB 43
was assigned a sequence type (ST) of 318 on the MLST
website. None of the alleles for strain MSMB 43 matched
alleles of B. thailandensis strains available in the MLST
database [7]. A dendrogram using concatenated
sequences of all B. thailandensis STs in the database, along
with a representative set of B. pseudomallei and B. oklahomensis sequences, indicates that ST 318 of strain MSMB 43
does not cluster with any STs except for ST475 (Fig. 1).
ST475 is represented by only one example, strain 1554,
which is an unassigned Burkholderia species from a water
sample from another bore in the rural Darwin region that
had also yielded B. pseudomallei isolates. MSMB 43 and
strain 1554 share one allele, narK, by MLST. Comparing
the concatenated sequences directly indicates that the
sequence for ST 318 has an identity of 96.8%, 96.3%, and
95.6%, respectively, to the sequences of the type strains of
B. thailandensis, B. pseudomallei, and B. oklahomensis.
To determine the relatedness of strain MSMB 43 to the B.
thailandensis type strain at the whole genome level DNADNA hybridization was performed as previously
described [8,9]. A 91% level of relatedness was determined when DNA from strain MSMB 43 was labeled and
in the reciprocal test using labeled DNA from the B. thailandensis type strain (Table 1).
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a major cause of community
acquired septicemia in Thailand and in tropical northern
Australia, especially the Darwin region of the Northern
Territory [10,11]. As an environmental saprophyte, it has
a wide distribution in endemic areas and poses a hazard
for those who are exposed to it. In northern Australia, the
ability to distinguish the pathogen B. pseudomallei from
less or non-pathogenic species is important since public
health action may result [4,5,9,10]. For instance, the misidentification in the U.S. of B. thailandensis as B. pseudoma-

B. thailandensis is a close relative of B. pseudomallei, but is
much less virulent in animal models such as hamsters
[1,2]. Since access to B. pseudomallei is restricted due to its
classification as a category B select agent, B. thailandensis
and other less virulent related strains may serve as acceptable substitutes for training and research [13,14]. B. thailandensis has also been the subject of increased
investigation recently, especially in genome sequence
comparison studies, to reveal virulence factors in B. pseudomallei [14-16].

Conclusion
We report the isolation and characterization of strain
MSMB 43 from bore water in the rural Darwin region of
tropical northern Australia. This is the first report of a B.
thailandensis-like isolate in Australia. Further genomic
characterization of MSMB 43 may yield insights into the
phylogenetic relatedness of B. thailandensis strains and
may allow identification of yet undescribed virulence factors in B. pseudomallei. The relationship of this isolate to B.
thailandensis strains from southeast Asia and to endemic
Australian Burkholderia species requires further elucidation. The genome of MSMB 43 is currently being fully
sequenced along with a collection of B. pseudomallei, B.
mallei and B. thailandensis strains from various locations
[17]. The sequencing project should help unravel the phylogeny of these Burkholderia and ascertain if MSMB 43 represents environmental Burkholderia species in Australia
which are ancestral to both Southeast Asian B. thailandensis and B. pseudomallei. Recent data show that Australian B.
pseudomallei strains are probably ancestral to those from
southeast Asia [18,19]. The origins of B. pseudomallei may
therefore be linked to environmental Burkholderia species
in Australia such as MSMB 43. In addition, comparison of
B. pseudomallei and closely related Burkholderia strains collected concurrently from environmental sources may provide further insights into horizontal gene transfer among
these species [14].

Methods
Biochemical testing
Standard biochemical testing was performed as outlined
in Weyant et al [3]. Arabinose assimilation was tested
using a minimal salts solution with 10% L-arabinose.

DNA preparation
Whole cell suspensions of bacteria were used for this
study as previously described [5]. Bacteria were grown by
plating one loop (1 μl) of stock cell suspension in defibrinated rabbit blood (stored at -70°C until use) on trypticase soy agar with 5% defibrinated sheep blood (SBA)
(BBL Microbiology systems, Cockeysville, MD) and incubated aerobically 1–2 days at 37°C. A single colony was
suspended in 200 μl of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 in a 1.5 ml
Millipore 0.22 μm filter unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA),
heated at 95°C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 6000 × g for
5 min.
16S rDNA sequencing
Sequencing and analysis of 1488 bp of the 16S rDNA was
performed as previously described [5]. In brief, we used
the Expand Hi Fidelity PCR system (Roche, Indianopolis,
IN). The amplification mix consisted of 1× buffer #2, 200
μM dNTP mix, 0.4 μM primers F229 and R1908, 5 units
Expand Polymerase, and 2 μl of cell extract in a total volume of 50 ul. Reactions were first incubated for 5 min at
95°C. Then, 35 cycles were performed as follows: 15 sec
at 94°C, 15 sec at 60°C, and 1 min and 30 sec at 72°C.
Reactions were then incubated at 72°C for an additional
5 min. PCR products were purified with Qiaquick PCR
purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

Sequencing primers were chosen from a panel of previously described oligonucleotides [5]. Sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems (ABI) BigDye
terminator cycle sequencing ver 3.1 kit as per the manufacturer's instructions, except 0.25 μl of BigDye 3.1 were
used for each reaction instead of 8 μl (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing products were purified
by using Centri-Sep spin columns (Princeton Separations,
Adelphia, NJ) and were resolved using an Applied Biosystems model 3130xl automated DNA sequencing system
(Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA). BestFit in the Wisconsin package (Accelrys, San Diego) was used to assess
the percent identity between sequences.

Multi-locus sequence typing
We used the panel of primers described on the MLST Web
site and in Godoy et al. for both amplification and
sequencing [6,7]. For amplification, we used the Expand
Hi Fidelity PCR system. Amplification mix consisted of 1×
buffer #2, 200 μM dNTP mix, 0.4 μM forward and reverse
primers, 0.9 units Expand Polymerase, and 1 μl of cell
extract in a total volume of 25 ul. Conditions consisted of
an initial 5 min hold at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles at
95°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min with
a final hold at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were purified and sequenced as described above for the 16S rDNA
sequencing except using the MLST primer set.

To determine relatedness to other Burkholderia strains, the
sequences of the seven alleles were concatenated and analyzed using the Neighbor-joining, Kimura 2-parameter
method with 1000 step bootstrap in MEGA 3.1 [6,20].
BestFit was used to assess the percent identity between
concatenated sequences.
DNA/DNA hybridization
DNA-DNA hybridization was performed using MSMB 43
and the type strain of B. thailandensis, strain ATCC
700388T. Cells were harvested and lysed, and the chromosomal DNA was isolated and purified as previously
described [8]. DNA from strain MSMB 43 and strain ATCC
700388T were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a commercial
nick translation kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) and tested for reassociation to unlabeled
DNA from the same strain (homologous reaction), as well
as to each other (heterologous reactions). Relative binding ratios and percent divergence were calculated as
described previously [8].
