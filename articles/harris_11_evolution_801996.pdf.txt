Evolution of small putative group I introns in the
SSU rRNA gene locus of Phialophora species
Lorena B Harris1,2 and Scott O Rogers1*

Abstract
Background: Group I introns (specifically subgroup IC1) are common in the nuclear ribosomal RNA genes of fungi.
While most range in length from more than 200 to nearly 1800 nucleotides (nt) in length, several small putative (or
degenerate) group I introns have been described that are between 56 and 81 nt. Although small, previously we
demonstrated that the PaSSU intron in the rRNA small subunit gene of Phialophora americana isolate Wang 1046 is
capable of in vitro splicing using a standard group I intron pathway, thus qualifying it as a functional ribozyme.
Findings: Here, we describe eight short putative group I introns, ranging in length from 63 to 75 nt, in the rRNA
small subunit genes of Phialophora isolates, a fungal genus that ranges from saprobic to pathogenic on plants and
animals. All contain putative pairing regions P1, P7, and P10, as well as a pairing region formed between the
middle of the intron and part of the 3’ exon. The other pairing regions common in the core of standard group I
introns are absent. However, parts of the 3’ exon may aid in the stabilization of these small introns. Although the
eight putative group I introns were from at least three species of Phialophora, phylogenetic analysis indicated that
the eight are monophyletic. They are also monophyletic with the small introns of two lichen-forming fungi,
Porpidia crustulata and Arthonia lapidicola.
Conclusions: The small putative group I introns in Phialophora have common features that may represent group I
introns at their minima. They appear to have a single origin as indicated by their monophyly in phylogenetic
analyses.
Keywords: Ribosomal RNA genes, Phialophora, Intron, group IC1

Background
Group I introns are capable of self-splicing in vitro, and
members of the IC1 subgroup are relatively common in
the nuclear ribosomal RNA genes of fungi [1-3]. A few
hypotheses have been proposed to explain how group I
introns became established in the rRNA gene locus. Intron
homing is one of the most likely mechanisms for converting an intron-less allele into one containing an intron, and
has been demonstrated in experimental studies. This is
initiated by the product of an intron-encoded homing
endonuclease gene (HEG), which cleaves an intron-less
allele at or near the intron insertion site [3-5]. This generates a double-stranded DNA break at the site of intron
insertion. The intron-containing allele is used as the template to repair the break resulting in insertion of the DNA

version of the intron and co-conversion of flanking exon
sequences. However, very few group I introns contain
open reading frames, indicating that the HEG’s have been
lost, they are elsewhere in the genome (and act in trans)
or they are no longer functional in the genome rendering
the introns immobile. Establishment of group I introns in
the rRNA gene locus appears to have occurred tens to
hundreds of millions of years ago, since the introns are
found in phylogentically diverse organisms and the
sequence diversity is large.
There are no known advantageous effects of group I
introns to host organisms [6]. They have been reported as
selfish or parasitic genes that are adapted to assure their
survival. However, some studies suggest that their widespread distribution indicates their evolutionary success
and importance [7-10]. The presence of these introns in a
broad range of species is due to a dynamic equilibrium
between gains, mutations, and losses tempered by maintenance of accurate splicing of the exons. Both vertical and

horizontal transmissions have been demonstrated, and
transposition has been proposed as the mechanism that is
responsible for movement of the introns within genomes
[3-5,9,11].
In previous studies we reported the presence of self-splicing group I introns in the rRNA small subunit (SSU)
genes of Cenococcum geophilum [12], as well as the location and self-splicing ability of a small (67 nucleotides, nt)
group I intron in Phialophora americana Wang 1046
[13,14]. This small intron may have originated from an
unequal crossover in an ancestor that was amplified in the
genome. Gene conversion, which is active in the rRNA
gene locus, may have increased copy number of the
mutant. Strong selective pressure is in effect in the rRNA
locus to retain the production of the large number of
rRNAs required in each cell. Therefore, the small introns
must have retained their ability to splice in order to allow
the production of functional small subunit rRNA. In this
study we compared eight small putative group I introns
from different isolates of Phialophora species (anamorphic
dematiaceous fungi) in order to study the structure and
evolution of these introns after their establishment in the
rRNA genes. We show that the small introns differ in
sequence, but retain similar structural features.

Methods
Phialophora isolates (P. americana CDC 5, CDC 10,
CDC B3733, NIH 8730, Wang 1046, Wang 10507,
Wang 10508; P. verrucosa NIH 8701; and P. europea
CDC B1214) were obtained from Dr. CJK Wang, State
University of New York, College of Environmental
Science and Forestry, Syracuse, New York. They had
been isolated from plant and human sources (Table 1).
All were grown on MEA (malt extract agar [1.28% maltose, 0.28% dextrin, 0.24% glycerol, 0.08% peptone, and
1.5% agar]) for 14 days at 22°C in 9-cm Petri dishes.
Liquid cultures were grown in PDB (potato dextrose
broth [0.4% potato starch and 2.0% dextrose]). Morphological analysis was performed to confirm taxonomic
characters for the species by light, scanning electron and
confocal laser scanning microscopy [15,16]

DNA from mycelia was extracted using a CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) preparation method [17-19].
The DNA was examined by electrophoresis at 5 V/cm for
1 h on 1% agarose gels in TBE (89 mM Tris-base, 89 mM
borate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and quantified by UV fluorescence intensity. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed to
amplify fragments from 33 bp upstream of the intron site
in the SSU rRNA gene through 50 bp of the 5’ end of 5.8S
rRNA gene (Figure 1). PCR was performed using 0.5 mM
each of primer prITS2 (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC)
and prITS5 (GGAAGTAAAGTCGTAACAAGG) [20]
using a GenAmp PCR Reagent Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). A Thermal Controller (GeneAmp PCR
System 9700, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
was used with a program consisting of 2 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of: 1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 54°C, and
2 min at 72°C. This was followed by a final extension of
10 min at 72°C. Amplification was confirmed by subjecting
aliquots to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels (with TBE
and ethidium bromide, as described above). The PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit
following the manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN,
Valencia, CA). Both strands were submitted for sequence
determination (Gene Gateway LLC, Hayward, CA) using
primers prITS2 and prITS5.
Multiple sequence analyses were performed to corroborate the presence and position of the introns in the
isolates. Intron sequences were used to compare among
the isolates. Sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW2
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html. The
alignments were examined, and manual adjustments
were performed. Phylogenetic analyses were performed
with PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony;
[21]) using Maximum Parsimony, with bootstrapping.
The intron sequences were subjected to secondary
structure analysis using Mfold (vers. 2.2, [22]). Because
of the short lengths of the introns, after the initial determinations of secondary structure, parts of the sequences
were removed and reanalyzed separately. Final manual
adjustments were made in each case.

20 bp
Figure 1 Region of the rRNA gene locus that was
characterized. This fragment from all isolates was amplified by PCR
with primers prITS2 and prITS5, and sequenced. It includes the 3’
end of the SSU rRNA gene (33 bp on the 5’ side of the intron), the
intron (63-75 bp), the remainder of the SSU rRNA (22 bp), internal
transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), and the 5’ end (50 bp) of the 5.8S rRNA
gene.

Results
Previously, the small intron (PaSSU) from P. americana
Wang 1046 was demonstrated to splice in vivo [14], has
group I ribozyme activity in vitro, and phylogenetically
falls within the IC1 subgroup [13]. All of the isolates
examined (except CDC B3733, which is intron-less) contain small introns (63-75 nt in length, designated
PaSSU, PvSSU, or PeSSU) located in the SSU rRNA
gene at position 1516 (relative to E. coli) that can form
similar secondary structures (Figure 2). Nucleotides
characteristic of the PaSSU for group I intron are found
in all of the introns at the 5’ and 3’ splice sites. Because
the PaSSU intron from P. americana Wang 1046 has
been demonstrated to splice in vitro via a group I intron
mechanism, it is assumed that the small putative introns
in the eight isolates exhibit similar splicing characteristics. Further evidence for this is provided by phylogenetic analysis, which indicates that the small putative
introns form a monophyletic clade (Figure 3). Small
degenerate introns from the lichen-forming fungi, Porpidia crustulata (78 nt intron) and Arthonia lapidicola
(63 nt intron) also fall within the same clade with all of
the Phialophora small putative introns, suggesting that
this intron may be widespread among certain groups of
fungi and might have been generated by a single mutational event.
Secondary structures all were consistent and comparable (Figure 2), although some (e.g., PeSSU and PvSSU)
varied to a greater extent in sequence, which is typical
of group I ribozymes. All contained a G·U pair at the 5’
splice site within the P1 pairing region, which consisted
of part of the 5’ exon, and the first 20-30 nucleotides of
the intron (Figures 2 and 4). The mid-section of the
intron paired with part of the 3’ exon. All possessed a
P7 that contained an unpaired nucleotide next to a G-C
pair that holds an exogenous guanosine (characteristic
of all group I ribozyme P7 regions), as well as an
unpaired A on the 5’ side of P7. Downstream from the
P7 region, all had small paired regions that preceded the
3’ splice site. This section also contained half of P10.
The other half of P10 (the internal guide sequence, or

Page 3 of 7

IGS) was within P1, which is characteristic of group I
introns. In isolate P. americana Wang 1046, previously
we demonstrated [13] that the final nucleotide of the
PaSSU intron is a U (an ωU, instead of the common
ωG in most other group I introns). Each of the other
small introns also had a U that is similar to the one in
isolate Wang 1046 at the 3’ end of the intron (Figures 2
and 4).

Discussion
The PaSSU intron (67 nt in isolate Wang 1046), located
in the rRNA SSU gene of P. americana (Figure 1), is the
smallest known intron with demonstrated group I ribozyme activity [13]. Its size affords an opportunity to
study the evolution of intron function. The mechanism
of splicing differs slightly from that of standard group I
introns. It proceeds through two trans-esterification
reactions, as in the group I intron of Tetrahymena thermophila [23,24], but certain variations have been found
in the second reaction, in that it employs a U (an
omega ωU) as the last nucleotide of the intron instead
of the canonical ωG found in almost all other group I
introns investigated to date [13]. The other small introns
described here are in the same location (nucleotide
1516, relative to E. coli) as the PaSSU group I intron in
isolate Wang 1046 (except the intron from Porpidia
crustulata, which is at the 516 position [7]). While they
all have similar secondary structure, their sequences
differ.
Secondary structure conservation is evident in these
small introns. Pairing regions P1, P7, and P10, as well as
another pairing region between the middle of the introns
and the 3’ exons (termed PM) all were maintained in
each of the introns (Figure 2). Furthermore, from our
previous report [13], the P7 regions of these small introns
probably originated as part of the P9.2 regions of larger
group I introns. While the important secondary structures of these small introns are maintained, they alone
may not be sufficient to hold the intron in the active tertiary structure for splicing to occur. Other parts of the
rRNA gene locus may aid in this process. For example, in
our previous in vitro splicing experiments, when RNA
was used that included only the intron plus approximately 20 nt of each of the 5’ and 3’ exons, splicing was
inefficient or failed. However, when a longer section
(approximately 300 nt, including the entire ITS1) of the
exon was included, splicing occurred in vitro [13]. Therefore, part of the SSU and ITS1 rRNA may form the tertiary structure that maintains splicing activity in these
small putative group I introns.
Ribosomal RNA genes are arranged in tandem arrays of
60-200 copies in fungi. Recombination and gene conversion act to homogenize the individual repeats. However,
mutations can lead to a heterogeneous combination of

sequences. In one case, an intron-less allele coexisted
with intron-containing versions. Sequence results
demonstrated that there often were one or more mutant
versions of the introns in each of the isolates (not
shown). While it is unknown whether the mutant introns
are functional, some differed from the functional PaSSU
intron in isolate Wang 1046, and therefore they may be
pseudogenes. Vertical transmissions, mutations and
losses are common in the evolution of group I introns in
fungi [10,25]. The small putative introns in Phialophora,

all appear to have originated from a single unequal crossover event that occurred in a common ancestor [13].
This is supported by three characteristics: 1. All are
found at a single nucleotide position in the rRNA SSU
gene, 2. All have similar secondary structures, and 3.
They form a single monophyletic clade.
Many studies have shown evidence for stable maintenance of group I introns over long periods of time
[1,26,27], which seems to be the case with the small
putative introns described here [13]. Previous studies

Figure 3 Phylogenetic tree comparing the small putative group IC1 introns in the rRNA small subunit gene of species of Phialophora
(Ph.), Arthonia and Porpidia with other group I introns found in the nuclear rRNA gene locus. The tree presented is the single most
parsimonious tree (determined using PAUP [21]), based on 115 nucleotide positions (only P1, P9, and the intron portion of P10 were used for
the analyses). Gaps were counted as a fifth base. Bootstrap values (based on 1000 replications) greater than 50% are shown for the supported
branches. The tree has 748 steps, with a consistency index of 0.5040. When gaps were considered as “missing data”, 12 most parsimonious trees
resulted, with 495 steps and a CI of 0.5515. While the branching pattern differed among the 12 trees, the small putative introns always formed a
monophyletic clade. Triangles indicate clades that are summarized for simplicity, as indicated as follows: Clade A, subgroup IC1 introns from
Ascolacicola austriaca, Cryptendoxyla hypophloia, and Leucostoma personii; Clade B, subgroup IC1 introns from Gaeumannomyces graminis,
Hypocrea pallida, Mycoarachis inversa, and Nectria aureofulva; Clade C, subgroup IC1 introns from Apioplagiostoma aceriferum, Cephalotheca
sulfurea, Cordycepioideus bisporus, and Gnomoniella tubiformis; Clade D, subgroup IC1 introns from Ahtiana sphaerosporella, Arctocetraria

numbers for the Phialophora sequences are provided in Table 1, while those for the other sequences are listed in reference [13]. Lengths of the
introns are indicated within the parentheses, as are the physical positions in the rRNA genes. All locations are in the rRNA SSU gene, relative to
the E. coli rRNA SSU gene, except where noted (i.e., 2449 LSU is in the rRNA LSU gene). Dashed box indicates the clade that includes all of the

suggested the presence of group I introns sporadically in
distant lineages of organisms that did not reflect the
overall phylogeny. Those results suggest horizontal
transmission between distinct lineages [3,11,28-30].
However, most of these involved large introns, the largest of which sometimes contained genes for homing
endonucleases. No open reading frames that encode
proteins for mobility such as homing endonucleases or
reverse transcriptases have been reported in any Phialophora species. Certainly, a protein encoded from these

small putative introns is implausible, and in general,
open reading frames are absent from introns in the
1506-1521 location of the rRNA SSU genes in fungi.
However, the different location for the Porpidia crustulata small degenerate intron (at position 516) suggests
that it might have inserted into the rRNA locus through
horizontal transfer or transposition.
Comparison of the PaSSU (Wang 1046) intron with
other introns inserted at the same site indicate that they
are orthologs, although their sequences and lengths vary

sequences have diverged, they all have a G·U pair at the
5’ splice site, a G-C pair in the P7 guanosine site, an
unpaired A on the 5’ side of P7, and a U as the final
nucleotide of the intron. These introns may represent the
minimum size for group I ribozymes.

by black regions. Intron regions are in white. Dashed lines indicate
regions connected within the intron. Conserved nucleotides are
shown (although there are some G-C pairing differences in P7 in
the introns from isolates NIH 8701 and NIH B1214). Grey area

[1,12,13]. Group I introns inserted at different sites have
been shown to be more distantly related even in the
same species [3,10,31] and thus are likely to be paralogs.
However, introns that are within the 1506-1521 region
group together in phylogenetic analyses [13], and may
represent a single insertion event, followed by mutation
and use of cryptic splice sites. This creates the appearance of intron movement. However, the change in the
splice site might not have been caused by translocation
or transposition of the intron. The similarities in intron
sequences among the isolates and the similarity to the
other group I introns in the same region of the SSU
rRNA gene, and the fact that they appear to be monophyletic [13] indicates that these introns moved into this
location at a time that predated the separation of these
taxa, which probably occurred at least tens of millions
of years ago. Recombination, mutation, gene conversion,
and vertical inheritance have resulted in the present distribution and diversity of group IC1 introns in the 15061521 region of the rRNA SSU genes in fungi, including
the presence of these small putative group I introns.

Conclusions
The set of small putative group I introns from the SSU
rRNA genes of Phialophora species are monophyletic,
presumably having originated from a single mutational
event. All are similar to the functional putative group I
intron from P. americana isolate Wang 1046, in that
each possess a P1, P7 and P10. Although their primary
