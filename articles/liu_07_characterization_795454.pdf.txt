Abstract
Background: lin-4 and let-7, the two founding members of heterochronic microRNA genes, are
firstly confirmed in Caenorhabditis elegans to control the proper timing of developmental programs
in a heterochronic pathway. let-7 has been thought to trigger the onset of adulthood across animal
phyla. Ecdysone and Broad-Complex are required for the temporal expression of let-7 in Drosophila
melanogaster. For a better understanding of the conservation and functions of let-7, we seek to
explore how it is expressed in the silkworm (Bombyx mori).
Results: One member of let-7 family has been identified in silkworm computationally and
experimentally. All known members of this family share the same nucleotides at ten positions
within the mature sequences. Sequence logo and phylogenetic tree show that they are not only
conserved but diversify to some extent among some species. The bmo-let-7 was very lowly
expressed in ova harvested from newborn unmated female adult and in individuals from the first
molt to the early third instar, highly expressed after the third molt, and the most abundant
expression was observed after mounting, particularly after pupation. The expression levels were
higher at the end of each instar and at the beginning of each molt than at other periods, coinciding
with the pulse of ecdysone and BR-C as a whole. Using cultured ovary cell line, BmN-SWU1, we
examined the effect of altered ecdysone levels on bmo-let-7 expression. The expression was also
detected in various tissues of day 3 of the fifth instar and of from day 7 of the fifth to pupa,
suggesting a wide distributing pattern with various signal intensities.
Conclusion: bmo-let-7 is stage- and tissue-specifically expressed in the silkworm. Although no
signals were detected during embryonic development and first larval instar stages, the expression
of bmo-let-7 was observed from the first molt, suggesting that it might also function at early larval
stage of the silkworm. The detailed expression profiles in the whole life cycle and cultured cell line
of silkworm showed a clear association with ecdysone pulse and a variety of biological processes.

Background
The life rhythmicities in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster result from programmed mediation of
a series of heterchronic genes [1-4]. Two small noncoding
RNAs, lin-4 and let-7, are essential components of the heterochronic pathway dictating temporal decisions of cell
fate from one stage to the next [4].lin-4 has long been
thought to regulate the transition from the first to the second larval stages in C. elegans [5-7], and let-7 was also confirmed to be undetectable until the last larval stage and
functions as a temporal switch promoting the transition
from larval to adult stages [8,9]. However, the latest studies showed that lin-4 and one of its target genes, lin-14,
also regulate life span in the adult of C. elegans [10], and
that let-7 can even be found in the 3rd instar larvae of C.elegans [11,12], and may be a master temporal regulator of
late larval development in C. elegans [13]. In Drosophila,let-7 RNA first appears at the end of the third larval
instar, a few hours before puparium formation, and
reaches high levels during pupal development stage
[9,14]. Both the temporal RNAs are functional in a mechanism through post-transcriptionally or translationally
repressing their target genes. lin-4 inhibits the translations
of lin-14 and lin-28 by base-pairing to partially complementary sites in the 3'-UTRs of their mRNAs [15,16], and
let-7 has been confirmed to inhibit lin-41's expression in a
similar fashion through binding to complementary sites
in its 3'UTR [17]. let-7 RNA is consistently detectable in
samples from diverse animal phyla, including chordates,
hemichordates, echinoderms, mollusks, annelids, and
arthropods, but cannot be found in basal metazoans, such
as cnidarians and poriferans, as well as in plants and unicellular organisms [8,18]. The diverse expression patterns
of let-7 family in various species may be responsible for its
important role in developmental regulation [19-21].
The expression level of temporal microRNAs was confirmed to respond to the pulse of steroid hormone 20hydroxyecdysone (Ecd) and/or juvenile hormone (JH)
[22]. Ecd and JH control the development of Drosophila
from embryogensis to adulthood [23-25]. They exert the
opposite effects on the expression of temporal miRNA
genes, such as mir-34, mir-100, mir-125 and let-7 [22]. Furthermore, the opposite effects of JH and Ecd signals could
be mediated by Broad-Complex (BR-C) [22]. The major
developmental transitions in the life cycle of Drosophila
are directed by the pulses of ecdysone [26,27], and ecdysone signals the stage-specific programmed cell death
(PCD) of the larval salivary glands during Drosophila metamorphosis [28], and also triggers the programmed cell
death in anterior silk glands (ASGs) of Bombyx mori [29].
Early Ecd-inducible genes,E74, E75 and BR-C, coordinate
with the temporal and spatial activation of downstream
genes, initiating a genetic cascade that leads to distinct
metamorphic processes such as pupation, PCD of larval

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/88

tissues, remodeling of the central nervous system, and
proliferation and morphogenesis of imaginal discs
[22,26,30]. Ecdysone and the Ecd-inducible gene BR-C are
required in the upregulation of some microRNAs including let-7 as well as the downregulation of other microRNAs [22].
Although a bevy of let-7 family members exist in various
organisms, their dos-a-dos in B. mori has not been
described experimentally [31]. B. mori is a typical member
of the family Bombycidae with about 300 moth species in
the order Lepidoptera. It has recently become a model for
studying the harmful Lepidopteran insects and the commercial production of useful biological substances called
interleukins [32,33], especially after the completion of
draft sequence of domesticated silkworm genome
[34,35]. The overt roles of lin-4 and let-7 in switching the
transition of metamorphosis in other organisms raise the
question of whether similar regulatory RNAs are involved
in the control of metamorphosis development of B. mori
and how the temporal identity conferred by the heterochronic genes is related to the major developmental landmarks that define the silkworm life cycle. As a step
towards a better understanding of roles of let-7, we seek to
explore whether they exist in silkworm genome and how
they are expressed during the life cycle of this insect.

Results and discussion
One homology of let-7 in the silkworm genome
By using of BLASTN based on sequence homology, we
identified one orthologue of let-7 in the silkworm
genome, which was named bmo-let-7 according to a common criterion (Bombyx mori, bmo-) [31]. The same site on
the genome sequence of AADK01002497(NCBI) was further confirmed by using the miRscan program combined
with RNAfold. The mature sequence and its precursor are
at 10858–10879 and 10846–10932, respectively, or at
10857–10879 and 10854–10925, respectively. The
mature sequence, either bmo-let-7 or bmo-let-7*, is on
the 5' arm of the foldback precursor (Fig. 1). The potential
alternative forms of this homology were submitted to
Northern blotting analysis later in order to see if stable
results could be obtained. Using the same prediction
methods, however, we did not find cel-lin-4 homologue in
the silkworm genome.
The extending let-7 family shares common "miRNA seed"
and represents restricted species diversities
There have been over 90 members so far in let-7 family
that contains about 30 different mature sequences, ranging in length from 19 nt to 22 nt. All members share the
two common fragments, GAGGUAG and UUG (Fig. 2),
and they might be the common "miRNA seed" which
could be used to search for target genes according to the
complementarity to sequences in the 3' UTR of all

expressed genes [36]. Seven of ten shared positions are
located at the 5' end of the mature sequence, and the other
three at the 3' end, consistent with the proposal that the 5'
end of the functional small RNA is crucial for the stability
and proper loading of let-7 into the miRISC complex
though both ends are required for downregulation of a
target gene [37].
Twelve positions exhibit exchangeable if the mature
seqence
of
cel-let-7,
5'-UGAGGUAGUAGGUUGUAUAGUU-3' (MIMAT0000001), is used as the reference, U at 5' end being position 1. For example, it is A at
position 1 in five let-7d members, G at position 10 in three
let-7e members, and U at position 10 in three other let-7d
members. At position 11, G is replaced by A in three let-7h
and eleven miR-98 members, or by U in both fru-let-7j
and tni-let-7j. Position 12 is shared by three nucleotides,
G, U and A in the mature sequences of all members. Four
nucleotides near the 3' end, namely, positions 16 to 19 are
also replaceable. Compared with the reference sequence
(cel-let-7), bmo-let-7 substitutes the nucleotide U with A at
3' end, as an exception to uridine preference at both ends.
In addition, deletion of nucleotides can take place at the
3'end. For example, ssc-let-7 is three nucleotides shorter
than the control sequence and twenty-two members are
one nucleotide shorter than the norm sequence (Figs. 2,
3). Taken together, the divergent sequences and replaceable nucleotides may imply their function diversities
among species to some extent.

The extending let-7 family might have evolved from a
common ancient precursor
C. briggsae, C. elegans, B. mori, D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and A. gambiae are Ecdysozoa, Protostomia, and all
let-7 precursors of them are clustered in the same clade
(Fig. 4). B. mori belongs to Insecta, Arthropoda, and bmolet-7 precursor is clustered with those of other insects,
accordingly. Homo sapiens, Fugu rubripes, Danio rerio, Xenopus tropicalis, Bos taurus belong to Chordata Deuterostomia, and let-7 precursors of them, except for has-let-7 and
ssc-let-7, are clustered in one clade. The conserved nucleotides of the precursors are those that tend to form the
mature sequences. Every small RNA locates closely to the
5' end of its precursor. However, the loop regions are significantly more divergent than their mature sequences
between mammalians and insects (Fig. 4). The conserved
fragments on both arms of the precursors and the variations in loop regions support the hypothesis that an
ancient precursor of the let-7 genes may have been common to the earliest animal lineages [18].
It is detectable in the silkworm from the early first molt to
the adult, suggesting that bmo-let-7 might even function
in early larval stages of silkworm
let-7 is notably induced at the last larval stage in C. elegans,
promoting the transformation from the larva to the adult
[9,11], and highly expressed in the late third instar larvae
of D. melanogaster when a pulse of the ecdysone triggers
puparium formation and onset of metamorphosis [14]. In
the case of bmo-let-7, we observed a wide expression profile by using of fifteen stage-specific samples across the
lifespan of the silkworm (Figs. 5, 6). The expression of
bmo-let-7 started at the early first molt, remained at low

level at the early third molt, still increased gradually to the
maximum at pupa and imago. The whole larval duration
from the first to the fifth instars could be divided into two
parts with the boundary at the third instar on the basis of
expression level of bmo-let-7 (Figs. 6 and 7), in accordance
with the division determined by the pulse of ecdysone in
the first four instars [38]. Approximately, the general
dynamic changes in bmo-let-7 levels is also close to the
pulse of Broad-Complext (BR-C) transcriptional factor of
silkworm, which is hardly detectable before the fourth
instar, lowly expressed in the fifth instar, and largely

one titer increases [39-41]. The coordinated changes
imply that the developmental transitions of silkworm are
more likely to be triggered by the cooperation of ecdysone, BR-C, bmo-let-7 and many other downstream genes.
The wide-range emergence implies that bmo-let-7 not only
controls the metamorphosis from late laval stage to the
pupa, as do the other members in let-7 family confirmed
in C. elegans [9,13] and D. melanogaster [8,14], but might
even function in the early larval stages of silkworm. The
antisense probes of bmo-let-7 and bmo-let-7* brought out
the same results in our sequential and parallel blotting
experiments. The two sense probes, however, gave no signals in all samples, confirming the single strand of this

Stage durations in the lifespan of B. mori
Stage durations in the lifespan of B. mori. When reared at 25°C and 85% H.R., the lifespan of silkworm is over 50 days,
consisting of ova, larva, pupa and imago. The embyo duration is about 10 days if proper acid-treatment is performed at hour 24
after oviposition. The first instar is 3 days long, starting at the newly-hatched silkworm or named ant silkworm, ending at just
stopping eating mulberry leaves for the first molt. After spinning, the silkworm will live through pre-pupa of two days before
becoming pupae. The durations vary a lot, ranging from 1 to 10 days.

small functional RNA. cel-lin-4 was beyond detection in
the silkworm by Northern blotting with the antisense and
sense probes, consistent with the prediction results.
Detailed expression profiles from unfertilized egg (ova) to
the third molt and from the early fourth instar to the late
fifth instar
After studying the general expression profile of bmo-let-7
across the whole lifespan (Fig. 5) with fifteen samples
(Fig. 6), we further investigated its expression patterns at
the turning point of each stage. As shown in the expression profiles from unfertilized egg (ova) to the adult and
from ova to the third molt (Fig. 7A), as well as from the
early fourth instar to day-7 in the fifth instar (Fig. 7B), the
signal intensity at the beginning of each molt was stronger
than that at the latest former early instar. For example, the
signal intensities at the early second and third molts
almost doubled those at the early second and third
instars, respectively (Fig. 6); and the signal intensity at the
early fourth molt was also higher than that at the early
fourth instar (Fig. 7A). High level of ecdysone is required
to induce some heterochronic genes before molt, and let7 was also confirmed to be induced by pulse of ecdysone
in D. melanogaster [22]. Both let-7 and ecdysone may be
crucial for the transformation of larval stages [14]. During
the development of silkworm, ecdysone peak comes several hours before the beginning of each molt, and a fall
occurs at ecdysis [38], slightly ahead of scheduel of the
expression profile peak of bmo-let-7 in our tests, well supporting the proposal that bmo-let-7 may be induced by the
pulse of ecdysone.

It has been demonstrated that not conjugated but free
ecdysone plays an important role in the control of cuticle
formation in the embryo [42]. The unfertilized egg (ova)
before oviposition removed from the female abdomen

gave a weak signal of this microRNA (Figs. 6, 7A-T2),
probably due to the slight induction by maternity genes
or/and by large amount of free ecdysone in the adult
organ, oviduct, which overly expressed bmo-let-7 (Fig. 7AT1). bmo-let-7 was undetectable in diapause eggs (data not
shown) because of very low free ecdysteroid fraction [42].
For the same reason, no signal was found in the embryonic development stages at day-2, day-6 and day-9 after
oviposition at 25°C (Figs. 6, 7A), and in the first instar larval stages, even though the free ecdysteroid fraction is
much larger than the conjugated ecdysteroid fraction in
early developing eggs from the second to the fifth
day[42,43]. Probably, it is not the conjugated ecdysteroid
but the free ecdysone that functions in inducing the
expression of bmo-let-7 and only when the amount of free
ecdysone is over a threshold can function properly.
The signal intensity at the beginning of molt was slightly
stronger than that at the end of molt. For example, the
expression levels of bmo-let-7 were higher at the early first
and fourth molts than those at the late first and fourth
molts, respectively (Figs. 6, 7A, B). The instar stages, however, showed different expression profiles. The signal
intensity at the beginning of the second and fourth instars
was almost identical to that at the end of the second and
fourth instars, respectively. A big jump in the expression
profile was observed relative to at the beginning of third
instar, further confirming the watershed between the third
instar and fourth instar where comes the maximum peak
of ecdysone [38]. The duration of the fifth instar is usually
7 days, and the expression pattern during this period was
relatively broad. bmo-let-7 was highly expressed at day 1
and day 2, relatively lowly expressed at day 3 and day 5,
then again highly expressed at the end of the fifth instar.
Moreover, there was no expression difference between
female and male during this stage (Fig. 7B). Taken

were examined here, but only two antisense probes brought out the same positive results. And lin-4 escaped detection in all
samples. All samples were quantified to be 15 µg per well before loading (see Materials and Methods). U6 and 5srRNA hybridizations were used as loading controls and levels of let-7 RNA are quantified relative to 5srRNA. Reproducible and consistent

Detailed7profile of bmo-let-7 accumulation from ova to the late fifth instar
Detailed profile of bmo-let-7 accumulation from ova to the late fifth instar. (A). Expression profile from pre-laid egg
(ova) to to early 3rd molt. In the first test, the oviduct attached to egg was not discarded. In the second test, the oviduct was
completely removed. T-1 stand for the first test (Test 1), T-2 means the second test (Test 2). The mulberry leaf was mainly
used as a control to eliminate the potential contamination. U6 and 5srRNA hybridizations were used as loading controls and
levels of let-7 RNA are quantified relative to 5srRNA. (B). Expression profile from early 4th instar to day-7 5th instar. The female
and male silkworms were differentiated on the basis of gonad while harvesting the materials. U6 and 5srRNA hybridizations
were used as loading controls and levels of let-7 RNA are quantified relative to U6.

together, each upsurge occurs at the turning point
between developmental stages before maturing, suggesting that bmo-let-7 is required for the transformation of larval stages.
A falling in the high level of expression profile is shared by
female and male pupa metamorphosis at pupal-moth
ecdysis
A strong signal was observed in the new female pupa and
adult (Fig. 6). Northern blotting in this assay, however,
revealed an extraordinarily high expression profile across
the whole process of pupation and eclosion of females
and males. A strong signal of the expression was observed

at day-7 of the fifth instar when the silkworm is ripe for
mounting or spinning cocoons (Fig. 7B). After spinning,
the fifth instar larvae enter a prepupation stage. There was
no expression difference between the beginning and the
end of spinning stage, implying that bmo-let-7 is unlikely
related to the process of spinning. The silkworm prepupa
undergoes a molt before pupation, which requires higher
titer of ecdysone [29,44], as confirmed in the process of
transition from prepupa to pupa in D. melanogaster
[24,27]. After pupation, histolysis and histogenesis are
occurring intensively and simultaneously, much more of
this functional RNA should be required for the double
missions, accordingly. The expression profile of bmo-let-7

Detailed
Detailed expression profile of bmo-let-7 during B.mori pupa metamorphosis. (A). Profiling during female pupa metamorphosis under artificial culture conditions. (B). Profiling during male pupa metamorphosis under natural culture conditions.
The two groups were incubated under different conditions, group A under 25°C and 85%RH, group B under 18–30°C and 40–
100%RH. Spinning stage, as well as adult stage, was simultaneously tested in favor of comparative analysis. Two or three days
after mounting, cocoon spinning is finished and the larva becomes prepupa. In the following two or three days, the prepupa
becomes pupa after molting. The pupa takes 8~11 days to transform into a moth which is white-grey colored. Under natural
conditions(18~30°C), the pupa metamorphosis will take 10~11 days; Under man-made conditions (25°C), however, pupa lasts
8~9 days ended as adult moth. U6 and 5srRNA were used as loading controls. 5srRNA and U6 were used as the loading controls and levels of bmo-let-7 RNA are quantified relative to U6.
fell at day 7 pupa in female group, and at day 8 in male
group, when the ecdysone is also lowly produced [45,46],
then resumed to the maximum just before adult emergence corresponding to the rising ecdysone [46]. The
expression falling during pupal-adult metamorphosis of
both female and male should have occurred synchronously if they had been incubated under the same temperature and humidity.
JH and Ecd function oppositely on the developmental
metamorphosis of the silkworm. JH can induce the
expression of some genes and repress the expression of
other genes activated by Ecd [22,47]. JH is highly secreted

by corpus allatum at early period of each larva stage, and
Ecd is highly secreted by prothoracic gland at late period
of each larva stage [27,48]. Insect metamorphosis is triggered by Ecd in the absence of JH, and is carried out by
self-destructive mechanisms of programmed cell death
(PCD) [49]. The let-7 temporal expression alterations are
in synchronization with the pulse of ecdysone [14], as was
further confirmed by our northern blotting results (Figs.
6, 7). Large amount of Ecd is secreted in the late fifth instar
or in just ripe silkworm in favor of spinning cocoons and
molting in pupation [45]. JH is required at late pupa stage
to promote the development of ovary and accumulation
of yelk (or the maturing of oocytes) and to maintain the

functions of testicles. A previous study revealed that in
B.mori, the prothoracic gland hormone secreted during
the first day after larval-pupal ecdysis might be responsible for the development of the ovaries during the pupal
period, especially essential for the initiation of ovarian
development [49]. After pupation, high level ecdysone is
required to drive the tissue differentiation and organ formation of adult moth [44]. Therefore, the Ecd-induced
microRNA, bmo-let-7, is highly expressed in pupae. However, the mechanism of how bmo-let-7 responds to ecdysone and Broad-Complex pathways in the silkworm is
worthy of further study.
bmo-let-7 is widely expressed in tissues/organs of female
and male individuals of the fifth-instar day-3 larvae
bmo-let-7 was moderately expressed in female and male
individuals at the fifth instar day-3 (Fig. 7B). To correlate
expression domains with the functions, we determined
the tissue specificity of bmo-let-7 expression in various tissues of larvae in day-3 of the fifth instar. Reproducible and
consistent results were confirmed by independently parallel Northern blotting experiments with the two antisense
probes (see in Methods). The let-7 small RNA of 22 nt or
23 nt was present in all tissues studied (Fig. 9). Moderate
signals were observed in body wall, midgut, gonad and
malpighian tubule, whereas a weak positive signal
appeared in anterior silk gland and posterior silk gland,
and strong signal was observed in the heads. Sex differences in the expression level were prominent in fat body
and hemocyte, however. The female fat body showed
weak signal but the male fat body exhibited very strong
one. On the contrary, bmo-let-7 was highly expressed in
the female hemocyte but lowly in male hemocyte. The distinct differences in the expression of bmo-let-7 imply that
some unknown mechanisms responsible for its transcription might be functioning differently in fat body and
hemocyte of female and male silkworm.

Tissue-specific or spatial expression patterns have also
been demonstrated in other organisms. As shown in D.
melanogaster, let-7 is widely expressed in a variety of tissues
from prepupae, such as brains, imaginal discs, fat bodies,
salivary glands, and Malphigian tubules, with relatively
higher levels in fat bodies and imaginal discs, and it was
also detected in adult ovaraies and carcasses, suggesting
that it could regulate diverse metamorphic processes, such
as the terminal differentiation of imaginal discs and apoptosis of salivary glands and fat bodies [14]. Furthermore,
various tissues from human also express let-7 RNA,
including brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, trachea, bone
marrow, colon, small intestine, spleen, stomach, and thymus, and the lowest level of human let-7 is observed in
bone marrow likely due to a large proportion of immature
cell in it [8]. Different expression profiles in various tissues from the silkworm indicate that bmo-let-7 might not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/88

only function in triggering transitions of temporal stages,
but more broadly in a variety of metabolisms because
each microRNA can control hundreds of target genes [50].
Expression profile in tissues from just mounting to day-3
pupae suggests its potential roles in histolysis and
histogenesis
Tissues from different stages here presented profiles
breadthwise and lengthwise (Fig. 10). The prospective
fates of organs and tissues such as head, body wall, silk
gland, midgut, fat body and gonad during metamorphic
transformation are different. Silk gland and midgut will
be completely histolyzed during the pupal stage [51-53],
and fat body undergoes reorganization as well as histolysis during larval-pupal transformation [54] and predetermined imaginal tissues differentiate and grow into organs
and external structures [53,55]. The histolysis of larval silk
gland, fat body and midgut is typical of programmed cell
death [49]. Thus, the expression profile of bmo-let-7 in tissues from just mounting to day-3 pupae may reflect its
association with histolysis and apoptosis.

The individuals at just mounting expressed large amount
of bmo-let-7 small RNA (Fig. 8A), but the body wall at this
period only showed very weak signal (Fig.10). Silk gland
and fat body at this time shared a moderate amount. Midgut, however, showed very high level, suggesting that midgut histolysis was triggered once the silkworm stopped
eating or just before mounting. When silkworms have finished spinning cocoons three days after mounting, the silk
gland accomplishes its mission and undergoes histolysis.
At this time, high level expression of let-7 was detected in
silk gland and testis; moderate level was observed in midgut and fat body, and a weak signal appeared in head and
body wall, suggesting that let-7 also promotes the apoptosis of silk gland and the maturation of testisis, as demonstrated during the metamorphosis in D. melanogaster [14].
Just after pupation (pupa 0 hr), silk gland enters the late
stage of histolysis, body wall and fat body are newly reorganized. let-7 was very highly expressed in body wall and
fat body, but very lowly expressed in silk gland of the newborn pupa, suggesting that let-7 functions in the histogenesis of body wall and fat body on the basis of the
conclusion that lin-4 and let-7 control the timing of cell
differentiation and proliferation [50,56]. At day-3 pupae,
weak expression signals were observed in midgut and silk
gland because these two tissues are almost completely histolyzed, but intensive signals appeared in body wall and
fat body which are still undergoing reorganization as well
as histolysis. Taken together, during the metamorphosis
from just mounting to day-3 pupa, the signal intensity in
body wall and fat body was rising to the utmost at newborn pupa, then fell at day -3 pupa. The high level expression of bmo-let-7 in fat body and other tissues is very likely
to be resulted from the ecdysone induction, considering

bmo-let-7 expression profile in tissues from females and males of fifth-instar day-3 larvae
bmo-let-7 expression profile in tissues from females and males of fifth-instar day-3 larvae. Eighteen tissues were
harvested from females and males of day-3 5th instar larvae bred at 25°C and 85% H.R. The two antisense probes(anti-bmo-let7 and anti-bmo-let-7*) were firstly hybridized on different blots, respectively, with equal amount of small RNAs on all loading
wells. After stripping, exchanged the probe for the other blot. The candidate mature sequence is 22 nt or 23 nt, and the potential precursor is 72 nt or 87 nt long, but the precursor transcribed by silkworm genome can not be accumulated enough to be
seen by Northern blotting. 5srRNA and U6 were used as the loading controls and levels of bmo-let-7 RNA are quantified relative to 5srRNA.

the evidence that the programmed autophagy in the Drosophila fat body is induced by ecdysone [57,58]. Silk gland
showed the highest expression level just after spinning
(prepupa 0 hr), and exhibited a falling signal during the
undergoing of apoptosis. In midgut, however, the expression level of bmo-let-7 reached the maximum at just
mounting, and then decreased. Although bmo-let-7 expression is generally response to ecdysone pulse in various tissues as well as in developmental stages, more precise time
points and tissues will be investigated to further determine if the expression of bmo-let-7 is directly induced by
ecdysone in the silkworm.
Effect of ecdysone change on the expression of bmo-let-7
in cultured cells
The expression of bmo-let-7 has been systematically investigated in the whole body and tissues or organs during the
development of silkworm. The results suggested that bmolet-7 generally responds to the pulse of ecdysone. Cell line
culture experiments were then carried out in order to test
whether ecdysone is required to sustain the expression of
bmo-let-7 and how the concentrations of ecdysone are
influencing its expression. This small RNA expression
trends differed even if it was detectable in all cell samples,
which have been incubated in the presence of different
levels of ecdysone for different periods (Fig. 11). For the
control cells (0 µM ecdysone), bmo-let-7 RNA level

increased straightly during the whole culture time, with a
gentle inflexion at 48 h (Fig. 11A ). When the cells were
treated with 3 µM ecdysone, bmo-let-7 was initially up-regulated, then reached a plateau shared by the control at 72
h. Lower level of ecdysone, such as 1 µM, seems to exert
diverse influence on bmo-let-7, down-regulating it slightly
before 24 h, up-regulating it distinctly from 24 h to 48 h,
then down-regulating it again (Fig. 11A). To avoid the
confusion resulted from possible experiment discrepancy,
we especially investigated the effects of different levels of
ecdysone at 24 h after incubation (Fig. 11B). bmo-let-7 was
slightly upregulated in the presence of 1 µM ecdysone and
most effectively induced by 3 µM ecdysone. However,
after treated with 5 µMecdysone, bmo-let-7 RNA level was
almost always stable during the whole examined span of
72 h, and dramatically decreased in the presence of 10
µM. This suggests that the expression of bmo-let-7 might be
induced by low-level ecdysone but repressed by high-level
ecdysone.
The silkworm ovary itself has been confirmed to express
bmo-let-7 (Fig.9), and ovarian cell line BmN-SWU1 was
also validated to produce this small RNA even if no ecdysone was added into the culture medium (Fig.11). During
the culture periods, the untreated cells are very likely to
produce ecdysone, so we cannot rule out the possibility
that the endogenetic and adscititious ecdysones are func-

tioning together in inducing or repressing the expression
of bmo-let-7 RNA. Since bmo-let-7 is undetectable during
the development of silkworm's embryo (Figs. 6, 7), the
embryo cell line is also unlikely to produce detectable
bmo-let-7 RNA. It would be interesting to look at whether
the expression of bmo-let-7 RNA could be observed when
the embryo cell line would have been incubated for certain length of time in the presence of ecdysone. The tissuespecificity and the timing of let-7 expression are conserved
in invertebrates, suggesting that it could exert widely in
mediating diverse metamorphic processes [8]. The programmed ecdysis behaviour in larval, pupal and adult

stages occurs in all of the holometabolous insects, and
depends on coordinated expression of a series of genes
related to peptide signaling [59]. Very low-level expression of let-7 can even be observed in the npr6 mutants of
Drosophila, which are unresponsive to the ecdysone pulse
at the end of the last larval stage (L3) due to the lack of
four BR-C isoforms [14]. It could be speculated that ecdysone might be only one of the factors regulating bmo-let-7,
and some higher upstream components of the heterochronic pathway could also contribute to its expression.

Conclusion
A new candidate member (bmo-let-7) of let-7 family in the
silkworm (B. mori) was identified by computational
approach and its expression was profiled by Northern
blotting. Lines of evidence confirmed that bmo-let-7 is
temporally and spatially expressed in the silkworm and
the expression is in response to the pulse of ecdysone, and
might be related to a number of biological processes such
as cell proliferation, histogenesis, histolysis, organogenesis and apoptosis. It is shown from the cell culture experiment that induction or repression effects of ecdysone on
the expression of bmo-let-7 are concentration-dependent.

Methods
Computational analyses
Both sequence homology search and miRscan program
were used to identify the orthologs of the let-7 gene in the
silkworm genome as reported [60,61]. The mature let-7
sequences of C. elegans and D. melanogaster were downloaded from the miRbase [62], and were used as query
sequences to BLASTN against the silkworm genome in
NCBI with default parameters and a non-stringent cutoff
of E > 1.8 [60]. Then, the miRscan program [63] was used
to scan the genome of silkworm as reported in other
organisms [60,64]. As a result, over 100 candidate microRNA genes were found (data not shown). The precursor's
stem-loop structure was predicted using mfold version 3.2
[65]. All known microRNAs and their precursors were
downloaded from the miRbase [62]. Ninety mature
sequences of this family were submitted to logo analysis
by using the WebLogo program [66]. Twenty-six selected
let-7 members and the sequences of their precursors were
aligned into phylogenetic tree by using MEGA v3.0 [67].
The alignments were processed by using of Boxshade [68].
Animal breeding and sample preparation
Female moths of the domesticated silkworm (Bombyx
mori), DaZao, were allowed to lay eggs for 4 hr at 25°C
and the developing eggs were incubated at 25°C from the
oviposition until hatching, the first day being the day of
oviposition. When developing eggs were incubated at
25°C, head pigmentation came on day 7 (6 × 24 hr after
oviposition), body pigmentation appeared on day 9 (8 ×
24 hr after oviposition), and more than 90% of the eggs
hatched on the tenth day. To prevent entering the diapause, the fertilized eggs were treated with a hydrochloric
acid solution, from 15 to 20 hr after oviposition at 25°C.
After hatching, larvae of the silkworm were reared on mulberry leaves under a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod at
25°C and 85 % H.R. and harvested at desired developmental stages. In order to obtain populations of B. mori at
various larval stages, animals were synchronized after oviposition by means of cold storage and acid treatment,
keeping the diapause eggs at 4°C for at least three months
followed by 5 min of acid treatment with a hydrochloric

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/88

acid solution at 46°C. Moreover, developmental landmarks, including hatching, larval molting, mounting,
spinning, pupariation, and eclosion, were used for more
precise staging. Each organ or tissue was separated by
manual dissection. The mulberry residues were completely removed from the midgut and other tissues by
rinsing with DEPC-treated water.
Firstly, a general temporal expression profile was revealed
using 15 stage-specific samples across the whole life cycle
of silkworm from embryo to imago (adult silkworm).
Unfertilized egg (ova) or pre-laid egg, as the contrast of
oosperm, was collected from the unmated neonatal
female moth. The oviduct fastening the unfertilized egg
was unremoved or removed for further confirmation. The
sex differences were taken into account from day-3 of the
fifth instar to the adult moth. In order to describe the
expression pattern elaborately, we then shortened the
sample-harvested intervals. Fifteen and fourteen samples
were taken for the metamorphosis of female and male
pupae, respectively. The whole life cycle was divided into
three parts for convenience of blotting, from embryo to
the third molt, from the fourth instar to day-7 of the fifth
instar and from spinning (just mounting) to day 2 of
imago. To know the transverse expression profile in various tissues, nine kinds of tissues or organs of day-3 of the
fifth instar were harvested from female and male silkworms, respectively. And different tissues from just
mounting to pupa stages were also taken to present a
lengthways expression profile.
Cell culture and ecdysone treatment
A new cell line of Bombyx mori, BmN-SWU1, was used to
examine the effect on bmo-let-7 caused by different concentrations of ecdysone. The BmN-SWU1 cell line was
recently established in our lab by using of ovary tissue
with different differentiated types, and the cells were cultured in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum at 25°C. Ecdysone treatment was as follows: cells were transferred from a common big culture
flask and then plated in 25-cm2 flasks containing 3 ml of
medium and allowed to grow for 48 h when they reach
about 80% of confluence. 20-hydroxyecdysone (Sigma)
was then added to a final gradient concentrations of 1 µM,
3 µM, 5 µM and 10 µM, respectively. Ecdysone-untreated
cells were used as the control. The cells cultures, with or
without ecdysone, were timed synchronously from the
beginning of incubation to various lengths of time (0–72
h). All samples cells were harvested every 24 h.
Small RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis
We used the small RNA of the mulberry leaves as a control
to eliminate the possible contamination. All samples prepared were frozen in liquid nitrogen before use. Small
RNAs were isolated with mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit

(Ambion) according to the Instruction Manual. The
extracted small RNAs were quantified by spectrophotometer, Gene Quant (Bio-Rad) before loading. Blots were
prepared by electrophoresing 15 µg small-sized RNAs per
lane on a denaturing 12% polyacryamide-7 mol/l urea gel
at 200 V for 1 hr, then at 300 V for 2 h, followed by electroblotting to positively charged nylon membranes
(Ambion) by using semi-dry Trans-Blot Electrophoretic
Transfer (Bio-Rad). After electroblotting, the RNAs were
fixed to the membrane by UV cross-linking (1200 µJ, Stratalinker; Stratagene) followed by baking in a vacuum oven
at 80°C for 30 min. DNA oligonucleotides complementary to predicted candidate bmo-let-7, cel-lin-4, U6 RNA
and 5srRNA were synthesized (Sangon, Shanghai). Two
antisense probes were used to confirm the reproducible
and consistent results. The 5'-ends of the DNA and the
Decade Markers (Ambion) were labeled with [γ-32P] ATP
(Amersham) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara) and
submitted to purification by using Purification Cartridge
(Ambion). The membrane was pre-hybridized in prehybridization solution containing 6 × SSC, 10 × Denhardt's
solution, 0.2% SDS and 300 µg salmon sperm DNA
(Ambion) at 50°C for about 10 hr. Then membranes were
hybridized in hybridization solution containing 6 × SSC,
5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.2% SDS and 300 µg denatured
sheared salmon sperm DNA (Ambion) with 1–5 × 106
cpm eluted radiolabeled oligo probes at temperature of
10–15°C below the calculated dissociation temperature
(Td) for at least 10 h. The blots were washed thrice for 5
min each at 37°C with 6 × SSC and 0.2% SDS and once at
42°C for 30 min. After the final wash, wrap the blot in
plastic wrap and expose to X-ray film at -70°C for proper
time. Strip off the former probe for reprobing by washing
at 90°C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS. Radioactive signals were
quantified with ImageQuant software package (Molecular
Dynamics). The relative levels of let-7 transcript were presented as the ratio of let-7 and U6 or 5srRNA radioactive
signals normalized to a 0~1 scale.
