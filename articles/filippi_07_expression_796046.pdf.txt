Abstract
Background: Dopaminergic neurons form in diverse areas of the vertebrate di- and
mesencephalon to constitute several major neuromodulatory systems. While much is known about
mammalian mesencephalic dopaminergic neuron development, little is known about the
specification of the diencephalic dopaminergic groups. The transcription factors Pitx3 and Lmx1b
play an important role in mammalian mesencephalic dopaminergic specification, and Nurr1/Nr4a2
has been shown to contribute to specification of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter phenotype.
We use zebrafish to analyze potentially evolutionarily conserved roles of these transcription
factors in a vertebrate brain that lacks a mesencephalic dopaminergic system, but has an ascending
dopaminergic system in the ventral diencephalon.
Results: We use a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to
determine whether nr4a2, lmx1b, and pitx3 genes are expressed in mature dopaminergic neurons
or in potential precursor populations. We identify a second nr4a2 paralogue, nr4a2a, and find it coexpressed with Tyrosine hydroxylase in preoptic, pretectal and retinal amacrine dopaminergic
neurons, while nr4a2b is only expressed in preoptic and retinal dopaminergic neurons. Both
zebrafish nr4a2 paralogues are not expressed in ventral diencephalic dopaminergic neurons with
ascending projections. Combined morpholino antisense oligo mediated knock-down of both
nr4a2a and nr4a2b transcripts reveals that all zebrafish dopaminergic neurons expressing nr4a2a
depend on Nr4a2 activity for tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter expression. Zebrafish
lmx1b.1 is expressed in noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus and medulla oblongata, but
knock-down reveals that it is specifically required for tyrosine hydroxylase expression only in the
medulla oblongata area postrema noradrenergic neurons. Both lmx1b genes and pitx3 are not
expressed in dopaminergic neurons, but in a diencephalic territory that might contain precursor
cells for ventral diencephalic dopaminergic neurons. Upon morpholino knock-down of both lmx1b
paralogues, the number of neurons in diencephalic dopaminergic clusters with ascending
projections appears specifically reduced. Thus lmx1b paralogues may contribute to the generation

of diencephalic dopaminergic precursors. Conversely, knock-down of pitx3 does not specifically
affect any diencephalic DA cluster.
Conclusion: Our data indicate a conserved evolutionary role of Nr4a2 proteins in specification
of the neurotransmitter phenotype, albeit it appears to be only one of several regulatory modules
of dopaminergic differentiation, as most ventral diencephalic dopaminergic neurons do not express
nr4a2 genes in zebrafish. For zebrafish lmx1b genes, which are not expressed in mature
dopaminergic neurons, our data suggest a role in diencephalic precursor populations contributing
to the ascending dopaminergic systems. A di-mesencephalic longitudinal domain of lmx1b
expression may be the basis for the expansion and posterior shift of ventral di-/mesencephalic
dopaminergic populations with ascending projections during evolution.

Background
Dopaminergic (DA) neurons control functions as diverse
as initiation of movement, reward associated behaviours
and hormonal homeostasis. Malfunction of DA input
accordingly has been implicated in a broad range of diseases, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, sleep
disorders, and drug addiction [1]. In the mammalian
brain, groups of DA neurons appear at stereotypic positions along the rostrocaudal axis, with defined projection
patterns [2-5]. In the telencephalon, a small population of
DA neurons develops in the olfactory bulb (group A16),
where it makes locally restricted connections. Diencephalic DA neurons are subdivided into 5 groups (A11–
A15), predominantly located in the hypothalamus except
for groups A11, which extends into the thalamus, and
A13, which develops in the zona incerta of the ventral thalamus. Projections from these groups are highly diverse,
ranging from local projections in the hypothalamus (A12)
to some of the most far-reaching DA projections of the
diencephalospinal system (A11). The best characterized
DA neurons are located in the ventral mesencephalon
(mesDA), and classified into three different groups: in the
retrorubral field (RrF, group A8), in the substantia nigra
pars compacta (SNc, group A9) and in the ventral tegmental area (VTA, group A10). The A9 and A10 groups provide
ascending projections establishing the nigrostriatal, the
mesolimbic, and the mesocortical systems.
Due to their involvement in Parkinson's disease, the
mesDA neurons have been the object of intensive studies
aimed at identifying extrinsic and intrinsic molecules
required for their specification and differentiation. In
mice, the generation of mesDA progenitors requires Shh
signaling from the floor plate and FGF8 signalling from
the mid-hindbrain boundary organizer [6]. In combination with other patterning signals, a temporal sequence of
transcription factor expression is established to control
mesDA development (reviewed by [7]). Otx2, Lmx1b and
En1/2 start to be expressed in the ventral midbrain at
E9.0, shortly before Lmx1a and Msx1 (E9.5) [8-11]. Later,
Ngn2 and Mash1 expression has been postulated to
induce the conversion of floor-plate cells into neuronal

progenitor cells [12,13]. When mesDA progenitors exit
the cell cycle and start to differentiate, they initiate the
expression of Nurr1/Nr4a2 [14], an orphan nuclear receptor belonging to the superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. Although Nurr1/Nr4a2 is expressed in
other areas of the mouse embryonic brain, only mesDA
groups have been reported to be affected in Nurr1/Nr4a2
mutants so far. In these mutants, the mesDA progenitors
are normally formed but are lost at later stages of development [15,16]. Thus, Nurr1/Nr4a2 does not seem to be
required for the formation of mDA progenitors, but it is
necessary for their differentiation and maintenance. It has
been postulated that Nurr1/Nr4a2 directly binds the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter to activate its expression [17],
but the proposed mechanisms of Nurr1/Nr4a2 action
have been challenged based on studies of the human th
promoter [18]. The paired-like homeodomain transcription factor Pitx3 appears to control an independent late
step leading to the maturation of mesDA neurons. In the
mes-diencephalic area, Pitx3 expression at E12 overlaps
with TH expression, and in adult mice is restricted to all
mesDA neurons [19-21]. Pitx3-/- mutant mice appear to
form mesDA precursors, but the final steps in differentiation, including expression of TH, and maintenance of
mesDA precursors are deficient.
The control of diencephalic DA development is less well
understood. Progenitors of the diencephalic group A13 in
mouse express both Dlx1/2 and Pax6, but only Dlx1/2
plays a major role in the specification of these neurons
[22]. For tuberal hypothalamic DA neurons in chick
embryos Shh and Bmp7 from the prechordal mesoderm
cooperate to induce the hypothalamic regional markers
Nkx2.1 and Msx1/2, and dopaminergic differentiation in
a Six3-dependent manner [23]. Recently, Otp has been
identified as specifically required for development of the
A11 DA group in mice [24], and for DA neurons of the
posterior tuberculum and hypothalamus of zebrafish
[24,25].
The roles of Otp in mice and zebrafish reveal that some
mechanisms of DA neuronal specification appear to be

conserved throughout evolution. However, from fish to
mammals, the dopaminergic systems have evolved significantly, culminating in the observation that teleost fish do
not develop dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, but
only in the forebrain [26-30]. Zebrafish DA neurons have
been detected in the olfactory bulb (like mammalian
A16), the subpallium (in mammals transient TH expression in lateral ganglionic eminence [2]), the preoptic
region (mammalian A15; [3]), and in the pretectum
(where TH expression is transient in mammalian
embryos). Further, several clusters of DA neurons form in
the ventral thalamus and hypothalamus. These clusters
have been numbered [28], because in the embryo the anatomical correlates are not fully resolved for all groups:
group 1 in the ventral thalamus, groups 2, 3, 4, and 9
(adult only) in the posterior tuberculum, and groups 6
(posterior tuberal nucleus), 7, 10, and 11 in the hypothalamus, the latter two detectable in the adult only. The pretectal DA group has also been named group 8. While there
are no mesDA neurons in zebrafish, group 1 has been postulated on anatomical basis to represent the TH cells of
the retromammillary area, and thus the rostral A9/A10 DA
neurons in mammals [28]. These similarities are emphasized by the finding that zebrafish DA neurons of the posterior tuberculum/ventral thalamus form ascending
projections into the subpallium, and may thus be
involved in neural circuits similar to the mammalian
nigrostriatal system [31,32]. These observations are in
agreement with the hypothesis that, during evolution,
ancient diencephalic equivalents of DA groups A8–A10
might have increased in cell number and expanded laterally and caudally towards mesencephalic territories [33].
Interestingly, in humans the A9, A10 and A11 groups
extend along rostrocaudal axis from the midbrain far into
the diencephalon, including prosomeres P1 and P2 during development [3,34]. Also, in early mouse development (10–12 days post coitum), mRNA for the ratelimiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, Tyrosine
hydroxylase, is expressed in large continuous rostrocaudal
domains extending over the mes-diencephalic border and
several forebrain neuromeric domains [2]. This ontogenetic observation is paralleled by an evolutionary perspective which indicates that the mammalian mesDA system
may have evolved from a diencephalic ascending DA system from fish through amphibian and birds to mammals
[33]. Therefore, it appears likely that early determinants of
dopaminergic differentiation may be expressed in similar
rostro-caudally extending domains. Here, we investigate
in zebrafish the potential contribution of conserved factors to both diencephalic and mesencephalic DA differentiation.
Based on the specific requirement for Nurr1/Nr4a2, Pitx3,
and Lmx1b for mesDA development, we decided to
address potential functions of these transcription factors

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/135

for DA neuronal development in zebrafish. Zebrafish
Nurr1 homologs [35] have not been studied in detail, but
expression of a Medaka fish homolog has been compared
with location of DA neurons [36]. Expression and function of zebrafish lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2 [37] as well as pitx3
[38,39] genes have been studied, but not in relation to DA
neurons. Our analyses of co-expression as well as functional knock-down experiments reveal that zebrafish
nurr1/nr4a2 paralogs are required in a subset of DA precursor cells for control of the neurotransmitter phenotype.
Further, lmx1b and pitx3 are not co-expressed in mature
DA neurons of the ventral thalamus and posterior tuberculum. However, lmx1b activity appears to be required for
specification of these zebrafish DA groups, which likely
constitute the fish ascending DA system. Our data suggest
that the domain of lmx1b expression, extending rostrocaudally from the di- into the mesencephalon in zebrafish,
may be an evolutionary ancient domain required for specification of ascending DA systems.

Results
Identification of zebrafish Nr4a2/Nurr1 paralogs
Previously, one Nr4a2/Nurr1 homolog was identified
during a systematic analysis of zebrafish orphan nuclear
receptors [35]. The predicted 41 amino acid peptide (GenBank AAB68748) described in this publication corresponds to the Sanger Ensembl predicted gene
ENDSARG00000040850, NCBI Gene 30566. A separate
GenScan predicted gene ENDSARG00000017007 exists,
which encodes a transcript that contains this peptide in a
584 amino acids ORF with high homology to mammalian
Nr4a2, and corresponds to the sequence of the zgc:92696
cDNA [40] located on Chromosome 6 at 11,946 Mb in
Assembly Zv6.

In order to identify a potential second Nr4a2 gene resulting from the teleost genome duplication, we searched the
Sanger Zv5 Assembly by Blast with the human Nr4a2
sequence and identified a 3' fragment of a second Nr4a2like gene. Using RT-PCR as well as Sanger Center EST and
genomic trace sequences (see Methods), we sequenced
and assembled the complete 598 amino acid ORF of this
second Nr4a2-like gene. Partial sequence for this second
nr4a2 gene is contained in ENSEMBL release 44 (Scaffold
Zv6_NA1751; ENSDARESTG00000009018), but has not
been linked to a chromosome so far.
Sequence alignment of both zebrafish Nr4a2 paralogous
proteins with human Nr4a2 revealed 72% amino acid
identity for the protein corresponding to the previously
published fragment [35], and 88% identity for the second
protein predicted from our sequence analysis (Additional
files 1 and 2A, B). Based on the higher sequence identity,
we name the second zebrafish nr4a2 gene, predicted from
our sequence to be closer related to the human gene, as

nr4a2a, while the previously published nr4a2 gene is
termed nr4a2b. Phylogenetic tree analysis reveals that
Nr4a2a is the ortholog of the previously published
Medaka Nr4a2 [36]. Further, phylogenetic tree analysis
with other members of the orphan nuclear receptor family
excludes that Nr4a2b is a homolog of other members of
the human Nr4a subgroup, including Nr4a1 and Nr4a3
(Additional file 2C, D). Therefore, nr4a2a and nr4a2b are
the duplicated paralogous genes correlating to human
Nurr1/Nr4a2.
Analysis of nr4a2a and nr4a2b expression pattern
We analyzed nr4a2a and nr4a2b expression patterns by
whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) at 24, 48, 72
and 96 hours post fertilization (hpf) (Fig. 1A–H and Fig.
2A–H). Although the expression patterns are similar and
overlap largely in most regions of the brain, some differences were observed. At 24 hpf, nr4a2a is expressed in few
ventral diencephalic cells (Fig. 1A, E) adjacent to a
hypothalamic domain defined by nkx2.1a expression and
posterior of prethalamic dlx2a expression (Additional file
3) [41,42]), while nr4a2b transcripts first appear in telencephalon and posterior diencephalon (Figs. 2A, E, additional file 3). Both transcripts are expressed in several
bilateral cell groups in the anterior hindbrain. At later
stages (48–96 hpf; Fig 1B–D, F–H; Fig 2B–D, F–H), the
number of nr4a2a- and nr4a2b-expressing cells increases
considerably, and expression domains are more similar
albeit not identical. Both transcripts are detected in the
ventral telencephalon, in several diencephalic areas (pretectum, thalamus, posterior tuberculum, preoptic area,
hypothalamus), in the mid- and hindbrain tegmentum, as
well as in the medulla. Moreover, strong expression of
nr4a2a and nr4a2b can be observed in the inner nuclear
layer of the retina from 72 hpf onwards (Fig. 1H and 2H
insets). To compare precisely similarities and differences
in nr4a2a and nr4a2b expression domains, we have used
the Alexa fluorescent dye conjugated Tyramide Signal
Amplification (TSA) system to perform double fluorescent in situ hybridization. At all examined stages, nr4a2a
and nr4a2b have broad domains of co-expression, but also
non-overlapping expression domains in several areas of
the brain. In particular, in the posterior tuberculum (Fig.
3A–A"), nr4a2b expression is detected only in a posterior
subset of cells of the nr4a2a expression domain. The
observed differences in expression domains are consistent
with the hypothesis that the nr4a2 genes are the result of
a duplication event and may have undergone subfunctionalization, with loss of some promoter elements during evolution.

nr4a2a is co-expressed with TH in dopaminergic neurons
of the pretectum, the preoptic area and in amacrine cells
of the retina
To be able to determine whether some groups of CA neurons express nr4a2 genes, we have combined whole
mount fluorescent in situ hybridizations with anti-TH
immunohistochemistry. At 24 hpf the earliest TH immunoreactive (THir) neurons are located anterior to the diencephalic nr4a2a domain. The most posterior THir cells are
located in proximity of the anteriormost nr4a2a-expressing ones, but there is no co-expression (Fig. 1I). As development proceeds, nr4a2a expressing cells are mainly
detectable dorsal and medial to the DA neurons of the
ventral diencephalon, and are intermingled with THir
cells of the more posterior groups, but there is also no coexpression (Fig. 1J, K, M–M"). Similarly, near the locus
coeruleus, nr4a2a-expressing cells and THir noradrenergic
(NA) neurons are in close proximity to each other, but
double labelled cells are not observed (Fig. 1L). In contrast, co-expression is detectable in the DA neurons of the
pretectum (Fig. 1M–M", N–N") and of the preoptic area
(Fig. 1M–M", O–O"), as well as in the DA amacrine cells
of the retina (Fig. 1P–P", Table 1). In the telencephalon,
at 96 hpf, some scattered nr4a2a-expressing cells can be
detected around the DA neurons of the subpallial area and
of the olfactory bulb, but no co-localization is apparent
(Additional file 4A, B).
nr4a2b is co-expressed with TH in the dopaminergic
neurons of the preoptic area and in the amacrine cells of
the retina
At 24 hpf, nr4a2b transcripts are not detectable in the
proximity of THir neurons (Fig. 2I), but at later stages a
strong nr4a2b domain is observed in the posterior tuberculum, dorsal and medial to the DA neurons. Similar to
nr4a2a, scattered cells around THir neurons express
nr4a2b, but co-expressing cells are not detectable in this
area (Fig. 2J–L). Co-expression of nr4a2b and TH is
observed in the preoptic DA cluster (Fig. 2N–N"), and in
DA amacrine cells of the retina (Fig. 2P–P", Table 1). In
contrast, nr4a2b-expressing and THir cells do not overlap
in the locus coeruleus and in the pretectum, although they
are found in close proximity to each other (Fig. 2M, O).
No co-expression of TH and nr4a2b is observed in the telencephalon (Additional file 4C, D).
pitx3 and TH are not co-expressed in any
catecholaminergic group
pitx3 is a homeodomain transcription factor that has been
recently studied in zebrafish for its role during retinal and
pituitary development [38,39,43]. Beside its strong
expression in the lens and in the pituitary placode, at 24
hpf pitx3 is also strongly expressed in a diencephalic
domain posterior to and non overlapping with the earliest
THir neurons (Fig. 4A, E). At later stages pitx3 dien-

can be excluded (Additional file 5L, P and Table 1). pitx3expressing cells and the NA neurons of the locus coeruleus
are also in close proximity but no overlapping expression
is observed (Additional file 5O). No pitx3 expression is
detected in the telencephalon where the olfactory bulb
and the subpallial DA neurons develop.
lmx1b.1 is co-expressed with TH in the noradrenergic
neurons of the locus coeruleus and medulla oblongata,
whereas lmx1b.2 is not expressed in any
catecholaminergic group
Lmx1b zebrafish orthologs, lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2, have
been shown to have similar expression patterns and
redundant functions in maintaining the isthmic organizer
[37]. Similar to pitx3, at 24 hpf both lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2
are expressed in a broad diencephalic domain posterior to
the earliest THir neurons (Fig. 4I, J and additional file 8A,
I). At later stages their expression in the ventral diencephalon is mainly restricted to positions dorsal and
medial to the DA neurons (Figs. 4K, L and additional file
6K for lmx1b.1, and additional file 8J–L for lmx1b.2), and
no co-expression of lmx1b.1 or lmx1b.2 and TH is detected
in any DA group of the posterior tuberculum at any examined stage (Additional file 7 and Table 1). In the hindbrain, co-expression of lmx1b.1 and TH is observed in the
NA neurons of the locus coeruleus (Fig. 4M–N") and
medulla oblongata (Fig. 4O–P"), as well as of the area
postrema (Additional file 6P–P"). In contrast, although
expressed in close proximity, lmx1b.2 is not expressed in
NA neurons of the hindbrain (Additional file 8M, N).
nr4a2a, but not nr4a2b, is required for formation of DA
neurons in the preoptic area and the pretectum
We examined by loss-of-function experiments whether
nr4a2a and nr4a2b are involved in catecholaminergic neu-

ron differentiation in the zebrafish. First, we inhibited the
translation of both nr4a2a and nr4a2b by targeting the
identical ATG-regions of their mRNAs by morpholino
(MO) MOnr4a2. As a control, we used a five mismatch
morpholino, mm nr4a2-MO, which did not induce any
detectable changes when th expression pattern was compared with wild-type embryos. MOnr4a2 morphants
show complete absence of th expression in the preoptic
region, the retina and the pretectum by 72hpf (Additional
file 9A–D; Table 2). This phenotype is largely maintained
at 96hpf, when nr4a2 morphants still display a nearly
complete absence of th expressing neurons in the retina,
and either weak or no th expression in pretectum and preoptic area (Fig. 5A–D; Table 2). In contrast, the other CA
groups develop normally, including the ventral diencephalic DA clusters, although their spatial organization
appears slightly altered (Fig. 5E–F).
To distinguish between the requirements for nr4a2a and
nr4a2b in preoptic and retinal DA neurons, we next
injected morpholinos that specifically inhibit either nr4a2
gene. Knock-down of nr4a2a completely abolishes th
expression in the preoptic area, the retina and the pretectum, while all other CA groups develop normally (Additional file 9E–H; Table 2), resembling the phenotype
produced by concomitant knock-down of both nr4a2
genes. However, nr4a2b morphants show normal development of all CA groups, except for a slight reduction of
DA amacrine cells (Additional file 9I–L, Table 2).
The absence of th expression in pretectum, retina and preoptic area (i.e. in the DA groups that show co-expression
of th and nr4a2a) suggests that Nr4a2a might directly bind
to the th promoter and regulate its transcription, as it has
been shown in rodents [17]. To determine whether other
differentiation markers are also absent, we analyzed the
expression of dopamine transporter (dat) [26] in MOnr4a2
injected embryos at 96hpf. When compared to controls,
morphant embryos show a strong reduction and/or
absence of dat expression in pretectum, retina and preoptic area (Fig. 5G, H and data not shown), suggesting that
Nr4a2a is necessary for the proper differentiation of these

DA neurons. Recently, it has been reported that morpholino injections may induce activation of p53 and
apoptosis, and that this effect often is independent of
inactivation of the morpholino target gene [44]. Therefore, we controlled experiments by injecting MOnr4a2
together with MOp53, and found the DA phenotype to be
identical to MOnr4a2 injection alone. Thus, p53 activation is not involved in loss of DA neurons upon depletion
of Nr4a2.
In summary, zebrafish nr4a2a is specifically required for
development of dopaminergic neurons in the preoptic
region, the pretectum and the retina, which co-express
nr4a2a and th. At the same time, there is only a minor
requirement for nr4a2b during the development of
dopaminergic neurons in the retina. While co-expressed
in preoptic DA neurons, loss of nr4a2b expression may be
compensated by nr4a2a in preoptic DA cells.
Knock-down of pitx3 does not appear to specifically affect
th expressing cells
Next, we examined the requirement for pitx3 during the
development of catecholaminergic neurons in the
zebrafish. As reported, pitx3 morphants display reduced
head and eye size [39], and retinal defects, which were
also detected in our experiments (Additional files 10 and
11). Based on the report of extensive apoptosis for pitx3
morphant embryos [39], we also co-injected equal
amounts of MOp53. While pitx3 morphant embryos have
severely reduced DA groups, the effect is nearly completely compensated by co-injection of MOp53. We therefore conclude that the DA phenotype observed in pitx3
morphant embryos is due to non-specific neural death

rather than to a direct involvement of pitx3 in the specification or differentiation of DA neurons.
Knock-down of lmx1b.1/2 affects diencephalic DA and
hindbrain NA neurons
Next, we investigated whether lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2 are
involved in catecholaminergic neuron development. To
this end, we knocked down lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2 functions
by simultaneous injection of MOlmx1b1 and MOlmx1b2
[37]. At 72 and 96hpf, lmx1b.1/2 double morphants display an overall mediolateral broadening of the ventral DC
DA groups (Fig. 6A, B and data not shown). The number
of dopaminergic cells in DC group 1 is reduced in
lmx1b.1/2 double morphants as compared to control morphant siblings. Dopaminergic neurons of group 3 and of
posterior DC groups form in normal numbers, but the latter are dispersed to more lateral positions (Fig. 6C, D;
Table 3). At 96hpf, a fraction of lmx1b.1/2 morphant
embryos show a reduction of noradrenergic neurons in
the area postrema (Table 3). Surprisingly, lmx1b.1/2 morphants develop frequently individual ectopic th-expressing cells at locations between the LC and the MO (Fig. 6E,
F; Table 3). Locus coeruleus neurons, however, appear to
form in normal if not slightly increased numbers, but
could not be counted accurately due to dense cell clustering (Fig. 6E, F; Table 3).

In order to assess whether the reduction of group 1 DA
neurons is specific or rather due to non-specific activation
of cell death, we co-injected MOlmx1b1/2 with MOp53 to
concomitantly suppress apoptosis [44]. The phenotype of
the triple morphant embryos is similar to the one of
MOlmx1b1/2 morphants (data not shown and Table 3),

The numbers in brackets represent the number of morphants that show the respective phenotypes and the total number of analyzed morphants. A

indicating a specific involvement of lmx1b genes. To test
whether the MOlmx1b1/2 morphant DA phenotype
might be a late result of early patterning defects, we analyzed expression of diencephalic patterning genes such as
shha and dlx2a, and the differentiation marker elavl3 in
lmx1b.1/2 morphant embryos (data not shown). The
results suggest that, in ventral diencephalic areas where
DA neurons develop, patterning of the forebrain and the
global pattern of neuronal differentiation are normal.
Further, we analyzed pitx3 and nr4a2a expression in
lmx1b.1/2 double morphants. At 28hpf, we observe a
strong reduction of the diencephalic pitx3 expression
domain in the morphant embryos compared to controls
(Fig. 6G, H). This change in expression level is still detectable at 35hpf, but appears to recover later, as it is no
longer detectable at 48hpf (data not shown). Surprisingly,
at 48 hpf lmx1b.1/2 double morphant embryos show a
specific reduction of nr4a2a expression in its most ventral
diencephalic domain (Fig. 6I, J), while all the other
nr4a2a domains appear normal. This result suggests that
nr4a2a expression in the ventral diencephalon might be
regulated by Lmx1b activity in their domain of co-expression (see Fig. 3C–C") or alternatively, the reduction of
nr4a2a expression could be a secondary effect due to the
lack of Lmx1b patterning activity in the ventral diencephalon of morphant embryos. In summary, double
knock-down of lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2 reduces noradrenergic neurons in the area postrema but not in the locus coeruleus, although both regions co-express lmx1b.1 and th. At
the same time, double morphant embryos show a reduction of dopaminergic neurons in DC group 1, despite the
fact that the expression domains of th and lmx1b.1 or
lmx1b.2 do not overlap in the DC region.

Lmx1b may define precursor population for DA neurons
representing the zebrafish ascending DA system
The finding that lmx1b genes, although apparently not
expressed in mature ventral diencephalic DA neurons, are
required for proper formation of DC group 1, suggests
that these genes may contribute to the development of DA
neuron progenitors. In contrast, the fact that knock-down
of nr4a2 genes in zebrafish only affects TH expression in
neurons that co-express nr4a2 indicates that in zebrafish
nr4a2 genes may be needed for late differentiation of a
subset of groups of DA neurons. Therefore, we investigated which of the transcription factors are expressed in
neural stem or progenitor cells, mature neurons, or glia.
Fluorescent double in situ hybridization experiments
show that, at 48 hpf, a subset of lmx1b.1-expressing cells
in the posterior tuberculum co-expresses sox2, encoding a
transcription factor that at this stage identifies proliferative cells along the ventricle of the diencephalon (Fig. 7A–
B"; [45,46]. nr4a2a-expressing cells are located 2–3 cell
diameter away from the ventricle, and they do not express
sox2 (Fig. 7C–D"). gfap, a marker of proliferative and glial
cells, is not expressed in nr4a2a-expressing cells (Fig. 7E–
F"), while the neuronal differentiation marker elavl3
(HuC) is co-expressed at variable levels in nr4a2a-expressing cells (Fig. 7G–H"). Analysis at 32 hpf, 36 hpf, and 60
hpf confirmed the results obtained with 48 hpf embryos
(data not shown). These results indicate that nr4a2aexpressing cells in the posterior tuberculum are differentiating cells of the neuronal lineage.

To investigate the reciprocal spatial relationship of nr4a2, pitx3- and lmx1b-expressing cells in the diencephalon, we
have performed double in situ hybridization at 48 hpf.
Our results show extensive overlapping expression of

Discussion
Although there is considerable mechanistic understanding of midbrain dopaminergic specification in mammals
(reviewed by [5,7], it is unclear whether dopaminergic
groups in different brain territories are specified by independent developmental pathways, or by shared and evolutionary conserved mechanisms [23,47]. The great
evolutionary distance between zebrafish and mammalian
systems may be useful in identifying conserved principles
of brain development and gene function during neuronal
differentiation. To this end, we have analyzed in zebrafish
the roles of Lmx1b, Pitx3, and Nurr1/Nr4a2 transcription
factors, which have been involved in early neuronal specification and expression of the neurotransmitter phenotype of mammalian DA neurons.
We identified a novel zebrafish nr4a2 gene of high
sequence similarity to mammalian nurr1, which we designate nr4a2a, in contrast to the slightly more divergent
nr4a2b [35]. Analysis of nr4a2a expression in relation to
dopaminergic neurons was performed using an optimized
procedure for fluorescent in situ hybridization in combination with anti-TH immunohistochemistry. Analysis of
these fluorescent double stains by confocal microscopy
enabled us to resolve for individual DA neurons whether
they express a specific transcription factor. Our analysis
differs from a previous study of nr4a2 expression in
Medaka [36], which postulated co-expression of nr4a2
and th in the posterior tuberculum, but may have been
unable to distinguish co-expression from expression in
adjacent cell layers or in intermingled cells. In zebrafish,
we detect nr4a2a expression in all pretectal, preoptic, and
retinal amacrine DA neurons, but in none of the other DA
groups. In contrast, nr4a2b was only expressed in preoptic
and retinal amacrine DA neurons. Morpholino antisense
oligonucleotide based translational knock-down of
nr4a2a expression revealed that nr4a2a is specifically
required for expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and
dopamine transporter in all DA neurons that express nr4a2a.
In contrast, the weak effect of knock-down of nr4a2b suggests that it may not be required for DA differentiation, as
nr4a2a may compensate for the loss of nr4a2b function.
Simultaneous knock-down of both nr4a2a and nr4a2b
duplicated the nr4a2a knock-down phenotype. Our data
are consistent with a role of Nurr1/Nr4a2 in the control of
late differentiation and expression of the DA neurotransmitter phenotype, as suggested for mammalian Nurr1
[14-17,48,49]. However, our data reveal that the subset of
DA neurons controlled by nr4a2 in zebrafish is different
from that in mammals, and DA neurons of the posterior

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/135

tuberculum/ventral thalamus, which might represent the
zebrafish ascending system, do not depend on nr4a2, in
contrast to mammalian mesDA neurons. Our conclusion
is that Nr4a2 is not the sole transcriptional module for DA
differentiation. The observation that only a subset of
Nr4a2 expressing cells enters DA differentiation indicates
that Nr4a2 proteins act in a combinatorial fashion with
other transcription factors in late DA differentiation. Our
finding that nr4a2a is not expressed in sox2 expressing
stem and progenitor cells, but that all nr4a2a expressing
cells co-express elavl3, a marker for postmitotic differentiating neurons, further supports the notion that Nr4a2
activity contributes to late aspects of dopaminergic differentiation. Finally, as nr4a2a is not expressed in gfap
expressing glia cells, it can be excluded that nr4a2 acts in
a non-autonomous fashion from adjacent glia cells to
support DA differentiation.
We further investigated the contribution to zebrafish DA
development of lmx1b genes, which have been implicated
in early specification of mammalian mesDA progenitors
[50], and pitx3, which appears to control late aspects of
mesDA differentiation [20,51-53]. lmx1b.1 does not
appear to be expressed in DA neurons, but is co-expressed
with TH in NA neurons of the locus coeruleus and the
medulla oblongata. lmx1b.2 does not appear to be coexpressed with TH in any CA neurons. Interestingly, we
find that NA neurons of the area postrema, medulla
oblongata, are depleted in lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2 combined
MO knock-down embryos, while NA neurons of the more
rostral medulla and the locus coeruleus develop. While
zebrafish lmx1b genes are required for maintenance of the
mid-hindbrain boundary organizer, lmx1b morphants
still express organizer signals including FGF8 until about
20 somite stage [37], which appears to be sufficient to pattern the rostral hindbrain and induce locus coeruleus NA
differentiation [54]. Although lmx1b.1 is co-expressed
with th in the LC, it is apparently not involved in neurotransmitter specification, similar to its rodent orthologue
in the midbrain [50]. Genetically, lmx1b.1/2 act upstream
of pitx3 and nr4a2 genes in zebrafish, as Lmx1b function
is required to establish normal expression level and
domains of pitx3 and nr4a2 in the ventral diencephalon.
Zebrafish lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2, are not co-expressed with
any DA neurons in zebrafish. However, surprisingly, morpholino based combined knock-down of lmx1b.1 and
lmx1b.2 reduced the formation of ventral thalamic group
1 dopaminergic neurons. Further, lmx1b1/2 knock-down
affects both expression of pitx3 and nr4a2 genes in the
ventral diencephalon. As lmx1b.1/2 are not expressed in
the affected population of differentiated neurons, these
findings indicate that it may be required for early specification or maintenance of group 1 DA neurons. As lmx1b
has been implicated in differentiation and maintenance

of DA neurons in the mammalian mesencephalon
[14,50,53], we hypothesize that expression of the
zebrafish orthologues may mark a progenitor domain of
DA neurons. Our findings that sox2, a precursor and stem
cell marker, is co-expressed with lmx1b.1, and that lmx1b.1
and pitx3 are co-expressed in this precursor territory may
support the hypothesis of an evolutionary old lmx1b and
pitx3 expression domain specifying mes-diencephalic DA
development. Similar to mouse, not all DA neurons in
this domain depend on lmx1b genes, and, while a subset
of mouse mesDA neurons depends on pitx3, such a
requirement was not detected in zebrafish. It is interesting
to note that in the 2 day old zebrafish embryo, the combined expression domains of nr4a2a and nr4a2b largely
overlap with the expression domains of lmx1b genes and
pitx3 outside the sox2 progenitor and stem cell area of the
posterior tuberculum and hypothalamus. While genetic
analysis in mice indicates that lmx1b and pitx3 genes contribute to mesDA differentiation independent of nr4a2
[50], our analysis in zebrafish indicates that there may be
common regulatory mechanisms that define the regions
in which all three genes are co-expressed.

Conclusion
Our data indicate a conserved evolutionary role of Nr4a2
proteins in specification of the DA neurotransmitter phenotype. However, Nr4a2 appears to be only one of several
regulatory modules of dopaminergic differentiation, as
preoptic, pretectal, and retinal amacrine DA cells depend
on Nr4a2, but ventral diencephalic dopaminergic neurons do not express nr4a2 genes in zebrafish. In contrast
to mammalian Nurr1/Nr4a2 in mesencephalic DA neurons forming ascending projections, Nr4a2 proteins do
not contribute to DA neurons of the diencephalic ascending systems in zebrafish. For zebrafish lmx1b genes, which
are not expressed in mature dopaminergic neurons, our
data reveal a role in ventral diencephalic precursor populations contributing group 1 DA neurons. Our data suggest a molecular model to explain the shift and expansion
of dopaminergic groups establishing ascending projection
systems from the diencephalon into the mesencephalon
during evolution from fish to mammals [33]. We hypothesize that rostrocaudal and dorsoventral patterning mechanisms establish a precursor domain that extends from
diencephalic prosomere 3 through prosomere 1 into the
ventral mesencephalon and defines a competence
domain to develop ascending dopaminergic neurons. At
the molecular level, this competence domain is established by the co-expression domain of lmx1b and pitx3 in
the posterior tuberculum and dorsal hypothalamus, with
lmx1b expression extending into the midbrain in fish, but
DA development being independent of pitx3. During evolution, minor and gradual changes may have enabled an
expansion of this competence domain, e.g. posterior
expansion of the pitx3 expression domain. Such mecha-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/135

nisms may have provided a molecular basis for the rapid
shift of ascending DA systems from diencephalon to mesencephalon during vertebrate evolution.

Methods
Cloning of nr4a2a
TBLASTX of GenBank and Sanger Sequences with human
and mouse Nr4a2 identified Sanger Centre ENSEMBL
scaffold Zv5_NA41, which contained the nr4a2a coding
sequence, except for a 600 bp gap in the 3' portion of exon
1, as predicted from interspecies comparison. For RT-PCR
amplification of this putative 3' fragment of exon 1, we
designed a forward primer using the annotated sequence
of exon 1 (5'CGCCCTGTCTTTACCAAGCAC3'), and a
reverse primer in the annotated sequence of exon 2
(5'CTGACATCTGTTTCTCCGAGG3'). Both primers contain four 3' end mismatches with nr4a2b, but only one
mismatch with nr4a2a, to prevent non-specific amplification of nr4a2b sequence. Sequencing and sequence comparison to nr4a2b identified a 510 bp fragment as the 3'
portion of nr4a2a exon 1. The 3' end of exon 1 aligned to
a site 10 kb upstream of nr4a2a on scaffold Zv5_N41. The
assembled 3' flanking sequence was verified by genomic
PCR, using a forward primer whose sequence is within the
3' portion of exon 1 (5'GAACCCTGGACAGTCAGAAT3')
and a reverse primer containing assembled flanking
sequence of the first intron (5'CAGCAGTATTATTA
TCCCTGAAC3'). The presumptive 30 amino acid gap in
the middle of exon 1 was filled by assembly of traces from
the genome project (Sanger Institute, UK). Partial nr4a2a
sequence was found in GenBank XM_001346372 and
Ensembl
GENSCAN00000001582
on
contig
Zv6_NA1751, which is not assembled to a chromosome
so far. Complete sequence was submitted to GenBank,
Accession Number EF661661. Amino acid alignments,
calculation of similarity, and phylogenetic tree analysis
(Neighbor Joining method of Saitou and Nei) were performed using VectorNTI software.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH)
WISH with alkaline phosphatase based color reaction was
performed as described [55]. The following digoxigeninlabeled antisense probes were used: nr4a2a; nr4a2b;
lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2 [37]; pitx3 [38]; th and dat [26]; elavl3
[56]; sox2 [46]; gfap [57]; nkx2.1a [41]; dlx2a [42]; shha
[58].
Whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
Single and double whole-mount FISH were carried out
based on reported protocols [59-61] adapted to the
zebrafish. Briefly, after rehydration, prior to proteinaseK
treatment, the embryos were incubated 30 minutes with
1% H2O2 in PBT, to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After hybridization with digoxigenin labeled antisense
probe, the embryos were washed as usual and blocked

with 1% blocking reagent (Roche #1096176) in TNT
buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5%
Tween20). To detect the probe we used a 1:400 dilution of
anti-DIG antibody POD-conjugated (Roche #1207733).
The embryos were then washed several times with TNT
buffer and incubated 1 hour with the tyramide-Alexa488
working solution (Molecular Probes, TSA kit #12), protected from light. The tyramide working solution was prepared according to the kit instructions. We have compared
the sensitivity of the TSA-Alexa stain to detect gene expression with the standard alkaline phosphatase/BCIP/NBT
technique, and found that the TSA-Alexa stain also detects
expression weakly stained using alkaline phosphatase and
chromogenic substrates (see also Fig. 1, 2 and 4 for comparison). However, we can not exclude that the TSA-Alexa
stain misses very low expression levels.
For double FISH, the second antisense probe was always
labeled with DNP-11-UTP ribonucleotides (Perkin Elmer,
#NEL555). After the first staining step, the tyramide working solution was washed away with TNT buffer and the
embryos were incubated 30 minutes with 1% H2O2 in
TNT, to inactivate the peroxidase activity of the first antibody. The embryos were then blocked for 1 hour and
incubated overnight with 1:200 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-DNP antibody (Perkin Elmer, TSA Plus DNP
System, NEL747A). The second staining step was performed like the first one, using a different Alexa-conjugated tyramide (Alexa555 or Alexa647, Molecular
Probes).

phenol red or 0.05% rhodamine dextran and H2O, and
injected into embryos at the 1-cell stage. Injected drop volumes were approximately 2nl, as measured in Halocarbon
oil on a micrometer slide. Morpholino concentrations
were adjusted to the following amounts per embryo: 2ng
MOnr4a2; 6ng MOnr4a2a; 8ng MOnr4a2b; 4ng both
MOlmx1b1 and MOlmx1b2; 2–3 ng MOpitx3. Efficient
knock-down was confirmed by WISH to lim3 in 30hpf
pitx3 morphants [38], and by WISH to fgf8 in 30hpf
lmx1b.1/2 double morphants [37]. For the nr4a2 morpholinos, injection amounts between 0.5 and 8 ng were
tested (data not shown), and the lowest concentrations
for which th expression was efficiently eliminated for DA
groups expressing the nr4a2 gene was used in subsequent
experiments. "Control" embryos were injected with control morpholinos in corresponding quantities: 2ng standard control morpholino (5'CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAAT
TTATA3') (GeneTools) as control for MOnr4a2,
MOlmx1b1/2 mix and MOpitx3; 6ng, 8ng and 4ng of
mismatch MOmcm5 [24] as controls for MOnr4a2a,
MOnr4a2b and MOlmx1b1/2 mix, and MOpitx3, respectively. Further, the following mismatch morpholinos were
used in same concentrations as the gene specific morpholinos: mm nr4a2-MO (5'ATAgTGAcCCTGcACcCAGG
cCATG3'); mm pitx3-MO1 as published [39]; mm lmx1bXMO as published [37]. MOp53 (5'GCGCCATTGCTT
TGCAAGAATTG3') [44] was used in co-injection experiments to assess the specificity of the observed phenotypes.
All morpholinos were synthesized by GeneTools (Corvallis, USA).

Immunohistochemistry
After whole mount FISH, a rabbit polyclonal anti-TH primary antibody [24] was used and detected with a goat
anti-rabbit Alexa555-conjugated secondary antibody
(Molecular Probes). Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described [62].

Knock-down of nr4a2a and nr4a2b reveals different requirements for formation of DA neurons in pretectum, preoptic area and retina. Morphant
embryos were analyzed for th expression by WISH at 72hpf. Embryos
injected with control morpholino showed normal formation of CA groups,
including DA neurons in the pretectum (A, arrow), the preoptic region
(A, arrowhead) and in the retina (C, arrow). The injection of MOnr4a2,
which targets both nr4a2 genes, leads to a strong reduction of DA neurons
in the pretectum (B, arrow), in the preoptic region (C) and in the retina
(D). The same phenotype is observed upon injection of a morpholino targeting only nr4a2a (MOnr4a2a) (E-F). However, the same DA groups
are unaffected by injection of a morpholino targeting nr4a2b
(MOnr4a2b) (I-L). Knock-down of nr4a2b leads only to a mild reduction of th expressing DA amacrine cells (L, arrow), as compared to controls (K, arrows). Scale bar: 100 μm.

Development of CA groups in pitx3 morphants. The numbers in brackets
represent the number of morphants that show the respective phenotypes
and the total number of analyzed morphants. In MOpitx3 embryos, the
posterior vDC DA clusters do form, but cells are often not as tightly organized into clusters as in control embryos (* – in 19/50 morphants, th
WISH stain intensity appeared stronger in morphants than in controls).
CA clusters in the OB and MO are not included here, but may show a
slight reduction of th expressing cells. Defects observed in MOpitx3
embryos are nearly completely compensated by co-injection of 2 ng
MOpitx3 and 4,5 ng MOp53, indicating that the defects are caused by
non-specific activation of p53, and that DA neurons may differentiate
normally in the absence of Pitx3. Notes: (*) morphants with general morphological defects may sometimes form less DA cells. Abbreviations of the
