Systematic search for putative new domain
families in Mycoplasma gallisepticum genome
Chilamakuri CS Reddy1,2, Sane Sudha Rani2, Bernard Offmann1*, R Sowdhamini2*

Abstract
Background: Protein domains are the fundamental units of protein structure, function and evolution. The
delineation of different domains in proteins is important for classification, understanding of structure, function and
evolution. The delineation of protein domains within a polypeptide chain, namely at the genome scale, can be
achieved in several ways but may remain problematic in many instances. Difficulties in identifying the domain
content of a given sequence arise when the query sequence has no homologues with experimentally determined
structure and searching against sequence domain databases also results in insignificant matches. Identification of
domains under low sequence identity conditions and lack of structural homologues acquire a crucial importance
especially at the genomic scale.
Findings: We have developed a new method for the identification of domains in unassigned regions through
indirect connections and scaled up its application to the analysis of 434 unassigned regions in 726 protein
sequences of Mycoplasma gallisepticum genome. We could establish 71 new domain relationships and probable 63
putative new domain families through intermediate sequences in the unassigned regions, which importantly
represent an overall 10% increase in PfamA domain annotation over the direct assignment in this genome.
Conclusions: The systematic analysis of the unassigned regions in the Mycoplasma gallisepticum genome has
provided some insight into the possible new domain relationships and putative new domain families. Further
investigation of these predicted new domains may prove beneficial in improving the existing domain prediction
algorithms.

Background
Domain assignment to the protein sequences has paramount importance in the post genomic era. Protein
domains are the structural, functional and evolutionary
units of proteins. Study of proteins at the domain level
has had a profound impact on the study of individual
proteins. Experimental and/or computational methods
can be used to identify domains in the given protein
sequence. Classification databases such as the Dali
Domain Dictionary[1], CATH[2], SCOP[3] and DIAL[4]
employ structural data to locate and assign domains.
Identification of domains at the sequence level depends
on the detection of global and local sequence similarities
between a given query sequence and domain sequences

found in databases such as Pfam[5]. Due to high evolutionary divergence, it is not always possible to identify
distantly related protein domains by sequence search
techniques. The realization of additional domains in
those circumstances can be tedious, involving manual
intervention, but can lead to better understanding of
overall biological function. We have recently introduced
an automatic multi-step approach, PURE for recognizing
such connections[6,7].
Mycoplasma gallisepticum causes chronic respiratory
disease in chickens and other avian species. The infections result in considerable economic losses in poultry
production. This pathogen has a small genome with 726
proteins [8], but only 498 protein sequences have
known Pfam hits with 46% residue coverage [9]. The
gap in the annotation of this genome emphasizes the
need for further exploration for other methods for
domain assignment from sequence. We have recently
shown that it is possible to enhance prediction of

domains in the unassigned regions by 25% through
indirect connections in the class III adenylyl cyclase
domain containing proteins [10]. Here, we demonstrate
that this method can be scaled up for whole genome
analysis, by taking Mycoplasma gallisepticum genome as
a specific example.

Results and Discussion
The procedure that was followed in this study and
overall results are described in Figure 1. Initially, there
are 726 proteins in the Mycoplasma gallisepticum genome; domains were assigned to the genome with
HMMpfam program of HMMER package [11] by
search against Pfam 21 databases [5,12] with expectation value cut off of 0.01. Only PfamA families are
used in HMMpfam search, since PfamB families were
generated automatically and have no associated annotation, references and relatively low quality data than
PfamA families [12]. The regions in protein sequences,
which are associated with domains, are called ‘assigned
regions’; rest of the regions without PFAM domain

assignment are called ‘unassigned regions’. There were
620 unassigned regions in the 726 proteins. To avoid
false positives in the similarity search, the unassigned
regions with at least 70 residues long were considered.
In our analysis, 434 unassigned regions have at least
70 residues long. Transmembrane, coiled-coils and low
complexity regions were excluded and only 364
sequences passed through this filtering step. A further
filter was placed to ensure adequate secondary structural content giving rise to 359 sequences. 15% cut-off
on predicted structural content was chosen as the
minimum value, consistent with our earlier work [13].
Only 230 out of 359 unassigned regions picked up at
least two hits in PSI-BLAST search; full-length
sequences for all the non-self hits were obtained and
used as query for HMMpfam search to assign domains
to the sequences. Only 62 of 230 unassigned regions
were associated with PfamA domains through homologous sequences and remaining 168 unassigned
sequences failed to pick up domain associations. These
62 unassigned sequences correspond to 71 newly

Figure 1 Methodology of the approach and statistics. Initially, 726 protein sequences were considered from Mycoplasma gallisepticum
genome, which have 620 unassigned regions of different lengths. 434 unassigned regions are at least 70 residues long. Out of 434, only 364
passed through transmembrane and coiled coil filtering and 359 sequences after secondary structure filtering. The remaining unassigned regions
(359) sequences were subject to PSI-BLAST searches, but only 230 unassigned regions picked up at least two hits. We extracted full-length
sequences for each hit in PSI-BLAST and used for HMMpfam search. Here again, only 62 unassigned regions were associated indirectly with preexisting domains which correspond to 48 different domain families.

Among probable new domains, some of the them are first time identified in Mycoplasma gallisepticum genome (indicated by $ or #). Among those unique
domains, some are not even present in other Mycoplasmas (indicated by #), while some of them are present in other Mycoplasmas (indicated by $). Second
column indicates the name of the domain, third column a brief description about the domain and fourth and fifth columns indicate the kind of association
which may be full association (we refer ‘fully associated’ when at least 75% of unassigned region is indirectly aligned with domain region) or partial association
(we call partial associated when at most 75% of unassigned region is indirectly aligned with domain region). Under full and partial columns, we indicate the
protein id and start and end residue number of probable new domain.

predicted domains out of which 58 were fully associated and 13 were partially associated. In the fully
associated domains, at least 75% of Pfam domain
should lie within the unassigned region, otherwise it is
called as ‘partially associated domain’.
These 71 newly predicted domains belong to 48
unique domain families, but among the newly predicted
48 unique domain families, only 22 unique domains
were initially not present in the Mycoplasma gallisepticum genome; for the remaining 26 domains, one or
more copies already exist in the genome. Among the
new predictions, 22 domains appear specific to M. gallisepticum genome, only 15 domains were present in
other Mycoplasmataceae members and remaining
7 domains are unique to the entire Mycoplasmataceae
family members (Table 1).
To validate the newly predicted domains, we generated multiple sequence alignments using CLUSTALW
program [14]. Inputs for multiple sequence alignment

are the unassigned sequence and the representative
sequences of the newly assigned domain obtained from
Pfam database. In most cases, only few family-specific
signature residues are conserved, suggesting extreme
levels of evolutionary divergence from classical members
of such Pfam families.
The number of newly predicted domains was substantial; it raises an interesting question: why were these
domains not annotated in the initial search? It is likely
because of the poor sequences identities between query
and hit. Though sequence analysis-based remote-homology detection approaches, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), are powerful tools, these methods often
face limitations due to poor sequence similarities and
non-uniform sequence dispersion in protein sequence
space. Several interesting approaches have been
employed in different ways to detect remotely related
proteins; one such approach is based on the intermediate sequences. Intermediate sequence procedure

Reddy et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:98
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/98

substantially increases the ability to recognize the distant
evolutionary relationships[15].
There is relatively large number (63) of unassigned
regions, which has picked up at least five homologues
but not associated with any PfamA domain (Additional
file 1: Supplemental Table S1). We examined below few
examples of these regions, which can be regarded as
potentially putative new domain families. Search against
PfamB profile HMM of Pfam24 database showed that
20 unassigned regions, where putative new domain
families were predicted by us, were also associated with
at least one PfamB domain (Additional file 2: Supplemental Table S2). However, about two-third (43 out of
63 unassigned regions) neither have a hit in the PfamA
database nor in the PfamB database. These 43 regions
may indicate potential new domain families, which are
yet to be annotated in the Pfam database (Additional
file 2: Supplemental Table S2).
The NP_853398.1 protein (Figure 2, Figure 3)
sequence, which is 329 residues long, has a single
asparagine synthetase (AsnA) domain from 5 to 241
residues and one C-terminus unassigned region from
242 to 329. When the unassigned region of this protein (242-329) was analyzed, based on the intermediate
sequences using the methodology described above, 106
similar sequences were identified in the PSI-BLAST

Page 5 of 10

search and these hit sequences were from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In the HMMpfam search, however, it was not associated with any PfamA domain,
rather it was associated with PfamB_3316 domain.
This unassigned region has about 62% predicted secondary structural content with 5 helices and 3 bstrands. More interestingly, the predicted b-3a-b-a-ba secondary structure pattern is conserved in all the
homologous sequences. All the homologous sequences
have similar domain architecture. The crystal structure
of E.coli asparagine synthetase also showed the presence of this small subdomain[16]. Aspartate–ammonia
ligase (asparagine synthetase) catalyses the conversion
of L-aspartate to L-asparagine in the presence of ATP
and ammonia. AsnA structure revealed that AsnA
structure is similar to that of the catalytic domain of
yeast aspartyl-tRNA synthetase despite low sequence
similarity. These enzymes have a common reaction
mechanism that implies the formation of an aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate. The cluster of highly conserved residues (GGGIG) motif plays an important role
in the formation of a cavity which can accommodate
bound ATP in aspartyl-tRNA synthetase[16]. Since this
motif is conserved in the newly predicted putative
domain, it may play an important role in the ligand
binding.

Figure 3 Phylogenetic tree of homologues obtained in the PSI-BLAST search. Domain architecture is shown on the top-right. All the
homologues have identical domain architecture with amino-terminal AsnA domain. The mode of deriving phylogenetic trees is as described in
Methods.

In another example, NP_853462.1 protein has an
unassigned region (1-265) in the N-terminal region followed by a C-terminal existing Peptidase_S8 domain.
All the PSI-BLAST hits were from prokaryotes. The
alignment (Figure 4) and conservation of secondary
structures in this region suggests the existence of functionally unidentified domain that could augment the
basic peptidase activity. It is also interesting to note that
all the homologous sequences have similar domain
architectures.

In another protein NP_852844.1, we had analysed an
unassigned region from residues 38 to 109 and the gene
product already was associated with KOW domain at
the N-terminus (from 5 to 37 residues). 109 homologues
could be identified by PSI-BLAST and all homologues
belong to prokaryotic organisms (Figure 5). All the
homologous sequences have similar predicted secondary
structure content. Most of the homologues also have
similar domain architecture with N-terminal KOW
motif and C- terminus as an unassigned region. KOW

motif is only about 35 residues long and links a bacterial
transcription factor with ribosomal proteins[17]. The
presence of conserved residues, with twice the size of
KOW motif at the C-terminal region, suggests the functional role of C-domain in additionally stabilizing the
oligomeric assemblies and thereby perhaps contributing
to improved efficiency of protein expression.
The results presented in this paper, are based on
Pfam21 database with 8957 protein domain families;
updated version of Pfam database (Pfam23) has 10340
domain families. Comparison of 71 newly predicted
domains in the 62 unassigned regions to the updated
Pfam23 database revealed that 67 domains, out of 71,
still remain unassigned in the Pfam23 database.
Among four Pfam23 annotations, three are the same
as our earlier prediction and one annotation differs
from our prediction. Comparison of our results with
conserved domain database (CDD v2.16)[18] revealed
that 34 out of 71 unassigned regions remained

unassigned in the CDD database also, whereas remaining 37 regions are annotated as domains. Out of these
37 annotated domains in the CDD database, 25
domains are the same as predicted by our method
described above. Assignments which differ from the
new Pfam database (Pfam23) and CDD (seeming false
positives and false negatives) were analyzed further. 12
out of 71 PURE predicted domains differ when compared to CDD database (Table 2); These differences
could arise due to inherent differences in the methodologies of CDD and Pfam database construction.
When compared with Pfam23 database, out of 71
PURE predictions, 67 still remain unassigned and three
agreed up on the PURE predictions. But, there is one
disagreement: 124 residue-long protein NP_853458.1
was full-length unassigned sequence and PURE method
assigned ‘VapD_N’ domain with E value of 0.006. In
the Pfam23 database, ‘CRISPR_Cas2’ domain is
assigned to the sequence with E value of 3.4 e-47. This

could be due to the short length of ‘VapD_N’ (40 residues long) domain alignment and the borderline Evalue (0.006 and a cut-off 0.01). Moreover, the
‘CRISPR_Cas2’ (PF09827) domain family is defined
only in Pfam23, but not in Pfam21 database.
The nature of sequence/domain searches is such that
the databases are constantly going through updates
and it is inevitable that our new findings might appear
obsolete due to the constant updates of robust databases such as Pfam and CDD. Where there is concurrence with the newer version of a database, they serve
to validate the approach. Where there is still new
information obtained from PURE approach, this clearly
suggests the value and novelty of the protocol due to
the early realization of additional domains. When the
newer entries are substantially high, this is very
encouraging for the development of the approach suggesting that this has promise for discovering hitherto
unidentified domains.

Filtering of Unassigned regions

Conclusions
Here, we present the results of the application of a new
method for domain identification to full genome of an
avian pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum. In spite of
filters, such as evolutionary conservation and high predicted structural content, about 20% of orphan proteins
contained in this genome could be annotated with a
known functional domain using our approach. Interestingly, our analysis revealed several meaningful alignments, which could relate to as yet functionally
unidentified set of domains. This could be very useful as
a starting subset for further functional screening in wet
lab experiments. Several improvements of the methodology will be addressed in future. Furthermore, cross-genome comparisons of the results from our procedure
between Mycoplasma gallisepticum and other Mycoplasma species are currently being investigated.

PSI-BLAST searches

Methodology
Complete protein sequences of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Strain R) were obtained from National centre for
Biotechnology Information website[19].
Extraction of Unassigned regions

Mycoplasma gallisepticum protein sequences were
scanned against a dataset of Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) obtained from the PfamA database (Pfam version 21.0)[5] which consists of 8957 families, employing the HMMpfam of the HMMER suite[11], with
E-value threshold set to 0.1. Sequences or sequence
regions, which are not associated with any domain in
the above search, were considered as unassigned
regions.

The unassigned sequences thus obtained were subjected
to different filtering steps.
a. To avoid false positives in the PSI-BLAST [20]
search, we considered only unassigned sequences
with at least 70 residues long.
b. Transmembrane regions were excluded by using
HMMTOP [21] and coiled-coil regions by using
COILS[22] from the unassigned sequences. The
above steps carried out to avoid non-specific hits in
the PSI-BLAST [20] search.
c. Standalone version of protein secondary-structure
prediction program PSIPRED[23] was used to predict
the a-helical, b-strand and coil (loop) content of different amino acids of unassigned regions. We employ
15% predicted secondary structural content as the
minimum value, consistent with earlier work [13].

The unassigned sequences, which have fulfilled the filtering criteria, were used to query non-redundant
sequence database [24] employing PSI-BLAST [20], with
low complexity filter turned on (E value cut off 0.001),
to obtain homologues.
HMMpfam search

Only regions of homologues that aligned well with the
query sequence were obtained from PSI-BLAST output
to scan against a dataset of Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs), which were obtained from the PfamA database
(Pfam version 21.0)[5] which consists of 8957 families,
employing HMMpfam of HMMER suite [11].
The indirect association of query sequence through
homologous sequences with HMMs in the Pfam database
gave rise to the definitions of full and partially associated
domains. At least 75% of HMM should indirectly align
with query to be considered as a fully associated domain
and rest were considered as partially associated domains.
Multiple sequence alignments

Multiple sequence alignments of the query unassigned
region and seed sequences of predicted domains which
were obtained from Pfam[9] were performed using CLUSTALW program [14]. Multiple sequence alignments of the
query unassigned region and hits in the PSI-BLAST were
also performed when unassigned regions, where hits were
obtained by PSI-BLAST search, but not in HMMpfam
search. When necessary, alignments were optimized by
manual editing. Phylogenetic trees were calculated using
Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [25]. Phylogenetic tree was
plotted using MEGA package [26].

Additional file 1: Supplemental Table ST1 Predicted putative new
domain families. In our analysis, some of the unassigned regions shared
homologues (at least 5 hits in PSI-BLAST search), but failed to associate
with any Pfam domain in Hmmpfam search. We performed multiple
sequence alignments to assess sequence conservation. 63 unassigned
regions showed good conservation which may indicate putative new
domain family. In the table, second column indicates the protein-id and
third column (UR = Unassigned Region) indicates the start and end
points of unassigned regions. Fourth column indicates the percentage
secondary structural content in the unassigned region by using PSIPRED
program. Fifth column indicates the total number of hits in the PSIBLAST search and the sixth column indicates the number of PDB hits in
PSI-BLAST search. Seventh column indicates the number of different
species among the PSI-BLAST hits and eighth column indicates number
of transmembrane helices which indicates whether protein is likely to be
membrane-bound or not.
Additional file 2: Supplemental Table ST1 PfamB associations in the
unassigned regions. 63 unassigned sequences were used to search
against PfamB database (Pfam 24), only 20 unassigned sequences were
associated with at least one PfamB domain. Unassigned sequence id
along with start and end residues are showed in column two, PfamB
start and end residue numbers are shown in column three, PfamB ids are
shown in column four and the Expectation values with which PfamB
domains associated are shown in the last column.
