Mitochondrial genomes and Doubly Uniparental
Inheritance: new insights from Musculista
senhousia sex-linked mitochondrial DNAs (Bivalvia
Mytilidae)
Marco Passamonti*, Andrea Ricci, Liliana Milani and Fabrizio Ghiselli

Abstract
Background: Doubly Uniparental Inheritance (DUI) is a fascinating exception to matrilinear inheritance of
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Species with DUI are characterized by two distinct mtDNAs that are inherited either
through females (F-mtDNA) or through males (M-mtDNA). DUI sex-linked mitochondrial genomes share several
unusual features, such as additional protein coding genes and unusual gene duplications/structures, which have
been related to the functionality of DUI. Recently, new evidence for DUI was found in the mytilid bivalve
Musculista senhousia. This paper describes the complete sex-linked mitochondrial genomes of this species.
Results: Our analysis highlights that both M and F mtDNAs share roughly the same gene content and order, but
with some remarkable differences. The Musculista sex-linked mtDNAs have differently organized putative control
regions (CR), which include repeats and palindromic motifs, thought to provide sites for DNA-binding proteins
involved in the transcriptional machinery. Moreover, in male mtDNA, two cox2 genes were found, one (M-cox2b)
123bp longer.
Conclusions: The complete mtDNA genome characterization of DUI bivalves is the first step to unravel the
complex genetic signals allowing Doubly Uniparental Inheritance, and the evolutionary implications of such an
unusual transmission route in mitochondrial genome evolution in Bivalvia. The observed redundancy of the
palindromic motifs in Musculista M-mtDNA may have a role on the process by which sperm mtDNA becomes
dominant or exclusive of the male germline of DUI species. Moreover, the duplicated M-COX2b gene may have a
different, still unknown, function related to DUI, in accordance to what has been already proposed for other DUI
species in which a similar cox2 extension has been hypothesized to be a tag for male mitochondria.

Background
Metazoan mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is generally a
small molecule (15-20 kb), and although much larger
mitochondrial genomes have occasionally been found,
they are often products of duplications of mtDNA portions, rather than variations in gene content [1,2]. The
typical mitochondrial gene complement encodes 13 protein subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation enzymes,
2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs. However, the coding sequences
(CDS) can be up to 16, the tRNAs up to 27 (source

MitoZoa: http://mi.caspur.it/mitozoa see [3]), and the
rRNAs can be duplicated and/or fragmented in discontinuous genes, as in oysters [4]. Generally, there is also a
single large non-coding region that is known to contain
regulatory elements for replication and transcription (i.e.
‘Control Region’, CR), but it is unclear whether it is
homologous among distantly related animals or, alternatively, it independently arose from various non-coding
sequences. This difficulty in establishing homology is
because CRs share sequence similarity only among closely related taxa. Finally, the mtDNA is almost always a
circular molecule: only the cnidarian classes Cubozoa,
Scyphozoa and Hydrozoa have been found to have linear mtDNA chromosomes [5]. All metazoan

mitochondrial genes have homologs in plants, fungi
and/or protists [6-9].
The Mollusca is the second largest animal Phylum and
currently 99 complete mitochondrial genomes are available in Genbank; among those, only 38 are from Bivalvia, the second class in terms of species richness among
mollusks. So far, bivalve mtDNA displays an extraordinary amount of variation in gene arrangement, i.e. very
few shared gene boundaries are detectable, and gene
translocations are common across all gene classes (protein-coding genes, tRNAs and rRNAs). For this reason,
bivalve mitochondrial genome may provide an excellent
experimental system to review and test models of mt
gene rearrangement evolution, which were mainly developed in groups with stable genomes, such as vertebrates
or arthropods. In addition, gene duplications and/or
losses are present in almost every bivalve taxon in
which a complete mitochondrial genome is available
(see [10]). It is therefore evident that efforts should be
made to improve the knowledge of bivalve mitochondrial genomes.
Another interesting feature of bivalve mtDNA is its
unusual transmission route, which is found in some species: while in Metazoa mtDNA is known to be usually
transmitted by Strict Maternal Inheritance (SMI;
[11,12]), some bivalve mollusks show a deviation from
this rule, named Doubly Uniparental Inheritance (DUI;
[13,14]). DUI was found in species belonging to seven
different bivalve families: Donacidae, Hyriidae, Margaritiferidae, Mytilidae, Solenidae, Unionidae, and Veneridae
([15,16]). Species with DUI are characterized by the presence of two distinct gender-associated mtDNAs: one
transmitted through eggs (F) and one transmitted
through sperm (M). The F and M genomes show up to
52% nucleotide divergence [17]. DUI seems at first to
violate the universal rule of uniparental inheritance of
organelles, because males receive their mtDNA from
both parents and their tissues are heteroplasmic. However the two mtDNAs segregate independently: the Ftype is transmitted to the next generation only through
females, while the M-type is only transmitted from
father to sons, therefore both genomes are actually
transmitted uniparentally.
Because of its unique features, DUI should be a choice
model to address many aspects of a wide range of biological sub-fields such as mitochondria inheritance,
mtDNA evolution and recombination, genomic conflicts,
evolution of sex and developmental biology (see [18] for
a review).
Recently, evidence for a new example of DUI was
found in the mytilid Musculista senhousia [19]. In this
work we characterized the two sex-linked mitochondrial
genomes of M. senhousia, a step forward to the complete genetic characterization of DUI related sex-linked

mitochondrial genomes. In fact, several unusual features
are coming to light when analyzing mtDNAs in DUI
systems, such as additional protein coding genes ([20],
and references therein) and gene duplications/features
[21,22]. Functional explanations for these features will
require much additional work, but are needed to understand the evolution and maintenance of DUI.

Results
Mitochondrial genome features in M. senhousia

The obtained M. senhousia mtDNAs are 21,557 bp long
in female (F-type) and 20,612 bp in male (M-type) (see
Tables 1 and 2). Sequences are available in GenBank
(Acc. No. GU001953-GU001954). The size of both F
and M mitochondrial genomes are within the size range
of mollusk mtDNAs sequenced to date, i.e. from 7808
bp in Batilaria cumingi to 32,115 bp in Placopecten
magellanicus (source MitoZoa: http://mi.caspur.it/mitozoa; [3]).
M. senhousia F and M gene arrangements are remarkably different from other fully sequenced metazoan
mtDNAs (see [10] for a review). Genome annotations
are reported in Figure 1 and 2, Table 1 and 2. When
compared to other Mytilidae, only four gene boundaries
are shared with Mytilus (tRNAs are not considered), i.e.
rrnS-nad6, nad2-cox3, nad4L-nad5 and nad3-cox1,
while the rest of the genome is different, thus highlighting that gene arrangement evolves rapidly within the
family.
Comparing the two sex linked genomes, protein-coding genes may have different lengths (Table 3). Both Ftype and M-type include a large number of Unassigned
Regions (URs; 29 in F and 27 in M: see Tables 1, 2 and
Additional File 1). Among these, the largest (4,521 and
2,844 bp in female and male respectively) are here
referred as LURs (i.e. Large Unassigned Regions).
Both F and M mt genomes show the same gene order
and contain the full gene complement of the typical
metazoan mtDNA, with two additional tRNAs: trnM
and trnL (Figures 1 and 2; Tables 1 and 2). In males the
cox2 gene is duplicated (Figure 2 and Table 2).
The atp8 gene was reported as missing in several
bivalve mollusks, however, as recently reported [23], the
lack of atp8 would rather be an annotation inaccuracy
due to the extreme variability of the gene. Following
[23], we found an atp8 gene in M. senhousia in both M
and F genomes.
The position of the two ribosomal RNA genes,
obtained through BLAST comparison, does not differ
between male and female. In both sexes, rrnL is located
in a region flanked by the trnM(AUG) and nad3 genes.
Assuming that the first base at the 5’-end comes immediately after the trnM(AUG), and the 3’-end of the gene
corresponds to the first base upstream of the start

codon of nad3 gene, the length of the rrnL genes are
remarkably different: the male rrnL (1,682 bp in length)
is 552 bp longer than the female one (1,130 bp in
length). The rrnS gene is located in a region flanked by
trnS and nad6 genes and, as above, we assumed that the
first base at the 5’-end comes immediately after trnG,
and that the 3’-end of the gene corresponds to the first
base upstream of the start codon of nad6 gene. Here,
the difference in length is reduced to 82 bp: the female
rrnS gene is 819 bp long while the male one is 1,087 bp.
F and M genomes of M. senhousia contain 22 tRNA
genes (see Tables 1, 2 and Additional File 2). As
observed in mtDNA of some other mollusks (Katharina
tunicata, Cepaea nemoralis, Mytilus species complex
and Argopecten irradians), two leucine tRNA genes are
present in M. senhousia. These can be differentiated by
their anticodons: TAA for trnL(UUR) and TAG for trnL
(CUN), which are 2-fold and 4-fold redundant respectively. Consequently, tnrL is 6-fold redundant. An additional trnM was also detected, as in V. philippinarum,
Mytilus species complex, Crassostrea gigas, C. hongkongensis and C. virginica. The additional tRNA coding for
methionine, trnM(AUA), has the TAT anticodon.
In both male and female mtDNAs, trnS(AGN) have a
shortened DHU (See Additional File 2) that is not atypical, as this arm is unpaired in many metazoan taxa
[24-27]. Moreover, mispairing between bases in stems is
consistent across several taxa. For example, the second
base pair in the anticodon stem of trnW has a T-T mispairing in Lampsilis ornata, Mytilus, and K. tunicata
and a T-G pairing in several gastropods [25].
In the F mitochondrial genome of Musculista, 20 out
of 22 tRNA genes are clustered in five groups of two to
six (see Figure 1 and Table 1). Of the remaining two,
trnT lies between atp6 and the 5’-end of cob genes

(with 24 bp overlapping each other) while trnA lies
between nad5 and nad4 genes. Thus, 4 of the 13 protein-coding genes (cob, nad1, nad4L and nad4) have a
tRNA preceding their 5’-end. In contrast, 7 other genes
(cox1, cox2, atp8, atp6, nad2, cox3 and nad5) have a
non-coding sequence at their 5’-end that is capable of
forming a stem and loop structure (see Figure 3).
In male mitochondrial DNA, 19 of the 22 tRNA genes
are clustered in five groups ranging from two to six (see
Figure 2 and Table 2). Of the remaining three, trnT lies
between atp6 and the 5’-end of cob genes (with 25 bp
overlapping each other), trnA lies between nad5 and
nad4 genes and trnE lies between the large unassigned
region (LUR) and the 5’-end of cox1 gene. Thus, 5 of
the 14 protein-coding genes (cox1, cob, nad1, nad4L
and nad4) have a tRNA preceding their 5’-end, while 7
other genes (cox2b, cox2, atp8, atp6, nad2, cox3 and
nad5) have a non-coding sequence preceding their 5’end that is capable of forming a stem and loop structure
(see Figure 3). In a few cases those structures contain
the translation initiation codon (cox1 and cox2 in
females, nad2 in males).
The nucleotide compositions of the two genomes are
summarized in Table 3. Given the G content of the F
and M coding strand (see Table 3), this can be considered as the heavy (H) strand of the molecule. The A+T
content of the H strand is also high (66.5%, F; 67.0%,
M). Variable values of A+T content are common in
mollusks, and they have been reported in L. ornata
(62%, [28]), Pupa strigosa (61.1%, [29]), and C. nemoralis
(59.8%, [25]). In other mollusks, the A+T content is
much higher (Albinaria coerulea, 70.7%, [30]; K. tunicata, 69.0%, [6]; Graptame eborea, 74.1%, [31]). Musculista values in A+T content are among the highest
observed in the Phylum, and reflect the high

heterogeneity of molluscan mtDNA [2]. Moreover, there
is a marked bias in favor of T against C, which is not
restricted to any particular class of genes and does not
differ between the two genomes.
The GC and AT asymmetry between the two mitochondrial DNA strands can be expressed in terms of
GC skew and AT skew calculated according to [32]: GC
skew = (G-C)/(G+C) and AT skew = (A-T)/(A+T),
where G, C, A, and T are the occurrences of the four
bases in the H strand. In M. senhousia F and M mitochondrial genomes, the GC skew and the AT skew are
F: +0.28 and -0.18, and M: +0.23 and -0.17, respectively.
In the M. senhousia male mtDNA 6 out of 14 protein
genes start with the ATA codon and 8 with ATG, while
in the female 7 out of 13 start with ATG and 6 with
ATA (Tables 1 and 2). This pattern differs from that
observed for Mytilus galloprovincialis, where 9 out of 13
protein genes start with the ATG codon, 2 with the
ATA and 2 with GTG [23,33]. In all known metazoan
mtDNAs, the most common start codon is ATG, and it
is a general opinion that the methionine tRNA with the
CAT anticodon represents the ancestral form. Moreover
[24] suggested that the second methionine tRNA arose
by duplication. The F and M genomes of the venerid
Venerupis philippinarum also have two tRNA genes for
methionine, but both have the ancestral CAT anticodon.
TAA is the termination codon ten times in F and nine
times in M mtDNA, while TAG is a stop codon two
times in F, and four times in M. In both M and F genomes, nad5 gene is terminated by an incomplete termination codon T– (Tables 1 and 2), with their likely
completion occurring by polyadenylation after transcript
processing [34].
A total of 4,098 and 3,794 amino acids residues are
encoded by male and female M. senhousia mitochondrial genome respectively (Table 4). All codons do occur

in both Musculista mitochondrial genomes (Table 5).
UUU (phenylalanine) is the most frequent codon, followed by UUA (leucine). UUU is also the most frequent
codon in M. galloprovincialis [33], in L. ornata [28] and
in C. nemoralis [35], whereas UUA (leucine) is most
common in A. coerulea [30], P. strigosa [29], Roboastra
europaea [36], G. eborea [31], and K. tunicata [6]. These
two codons are also the most frequently used in other
invertebrate mtDNAs [37-42]. UUU is also very frequent
in basal chordates (e.g. amphioxus, Branchiostoma lanceolatum, [43]), but not in most vertebrates, where CUA
(e.g., Cyprinus, [44]; Homo sapiens, [45]) or AUU (e.g.,
Xenopus laevis, [46]; Danio rerio, [47]) are the most
frequent.
The least used codons in males are UCG (6), CCG (8)
and CGG (8), while in females they are CCG (4), CGC
(7) and UAG (7). Of these, CGC is also among the least
common in the mtDNA of other mollusks. Synonymous
codons, whether four-fold (4FD) or two-fold (2FD)
degenerate, are recognized by the same tRNA, with the
exception of the methionine codons, which are recognized by different tRNAs (Table 5).
Moreover, 2,754 F and 2,967 M Musculista codons
(72.6% and 72.4% in female and in male respectively)
end with an A or T, a more pronounced phenomenon
than what observed for a typical invertebrate codon
bias. There is a strong bias against the use of C (9.3%
and 11.3% in female and in male respectively) at the
third position nucleotide in all codons: in detail, for
residues with a fourfold degenerate third position,
codon families ending with T are the most frequently
used (46.7% and 46.6% in female and male respectively). This is also the case for two-fold degenerate
codons. In other words, in every case an amino acid
residue can be specified by any NNY codon, both
female and male M. senhousia mitochondrial genomes

have a much higher proportion of NNT:NNC. In fact,
female showed 44.7% of T and 9.3% of C, with NNT:
NNC ratio of 4.8:1; while in male the ratio’s value is
slightly lower: 3.9:1 (43.8% of T and 11.2% of C). At
the second position, there is even a stronger bias in
favor of the use of T usage (45.4% and 44.2% in female
and male respectively)(see Table 6), like in M. edulis
(43.5%), C. hongkongensis (42.5%), C. gigas (42.3%) and
C. virginica (43.0%).

Finally, in eight 2FD and seven 4FD codon families in
females and in seven 2FD and seven 4FD codon families in
males, the most frequently used codon does not match the
tRNA anticodon. This has been observed in other
metazoan mtDNA as well [46-50] and it suggests that strict
codon-anticodon complementarity does not affect the
codon composition of the genome. Deviations from equal
frequency of the four nucleotides in 4FD sites are common
in the animal mtDNA and have been attributed to several

factors, such as unequal presence of the four nucleotides in
the nucleotide pool, preference of the mitochondrial
gamma DNA polymerase for specific nucleotides, or asymmetrical mutation rate owing to different duration of exposure of the lagging strand during replication [40,51-54].
Comparing the two M. senhousia sex linked genomes,
the most conserved protein-coding genes are cox1 and
cob, and the least conserved are nad6 and atp8 (Table 4).
Synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution
values between the two genomes do vary (Table 4). Ka is

particularly low for cox1 (0.042), whereas Ks is not
(0.838), suggesting that this gene is under some selective
constraint (Ka/Ks = 0.05). The conservation of cox1 is
common in animal mtDNA [55,56]. In cob gene, both K
values are lower than average (Table 4) with a Ka/Ks
ratio’s value (0.10) which is close to that of cox1 gene.
The Large Unassigned Region (LUR)

As mentioned, in the female genome the LUR (F-LUR)
is 4,521 bp long and it is included between trnE and the

5’-end of cox1 gene (Figure 1 and 4, Table 1), while in
the male it (M-LUR) is 2,844 bp long, and included
between trnN and trnE genes (Figure 2 and 4, Table 2).
Both start with a dissimilar sequence/spacer 20 and 237
bp long, respectively.
The F-LUR contains two large repeats (Figure 4: Rep1
and Rep2) about 2,150 bp long (2,149 Rep1; 2,151
Rep2), both subdividable in three regions: A, B and C
(named A 1 , A 2 , B 1 , B 2 , C 1 and C 2 ; see Figure 4 and
Additional File 3). Between Rep1 and Rep2, the A subregion is the most conserved (pD = 0.000, see Table 6)
while C is the most variable, although with a low pD
(0.010 ± 0.005). Overall, Rep1 and Rep2 have a pD of
0.004 ± 0.001. The region including the last 202 bp of
the F-LUR shows some similarity (pD = 0.449 ± 0.035)
to the A subregions (A 1 and A 2 ), for this reason it is
indicated here as subregion A’.
All the A-type subregions (A1, A2 and A’) start with a
46 bp conserved motif, named here a, that contains a 10
bp hairpin (ah; see Figure 5). Both the subunits C (C 1
and C2) begin with a hairpin 27 bp long (Ch; Figure 5).
The M-LUR contains an A-like subregion showing a pD
of 0.362 ± 0.032 from A1 and A2 (Table 6), indicated as
A’’ (Figure 4). A’’ starts with a 37 bp motif, here named
a*, similar to a, but 9 bp shorter and with three mutations that allow the formation of a longer hairpin, here
named a*h (31 bp; Figure 5), in comparison to the female
hairpin ah. The M-LUR continues with the subunit B
that is the most conserved region compared to the FLUR showing a pD from B1 and B2 of 0.098 ± 0.007 and
0.096 ± 0.007 respectively (Table 6). At the 3’ end of B
there is a motif, indicated as g (Figure 4) that is similar to
the first part of the subunits C. g is repeated four times in
tandem. The length of g1, g2 and g3 ranges from 268 and
265 bp while the last repeat, g4 , is truncated and measures 17 bp (Additional File 3; Figure 4). The pD among
the g motifs is low and ranges from 0.008 ± 0.005 in the
female (between gc1 and gc2) and 0.019 ± 0.009 between
g1 and g3 (Table 6). The pD of the g motifs between male
and female varies from 0.346 and 0.350 ± 0.027 (Table 6).
At the 5’ end of each g motif a secondary structure is present (g1h, g2h, g3h and g4h respectively; Figure 5): g1h is 14
bp long, while the other three are 28 bp long. g2h and g3h
are identical, g4h has a two bases mutation at the center
of the loop and g1h is identical to the upper portion of
g4h (see Figure 5).
Furthermore, in line with what has been found in
other DUI bivalves, including Mytilus, an ORF coding
for 121 amminoacids has been found in the F-LUR of
M. senhousia. This protein was proposed to have a

functional role in DUI. Detailed analyses on this novel
DUI related putative protein have been published in a
more comparative way (see [20]).
The cox2 duplication in the male mtDNA

The male mtDNA contains an extra copy of the cox2
gene. This is not new for DUI animals, since the female
mt genome of the marine clam V. philippinarum has a
cox2 duplication as well (GenBank Acc. No. AB065375:
Okazaki and Ueshima, unpublished).
In the female Musculista, the cox2 gene (Fcox2) is 660
bp long and is flanked by the “cox1/UR-6” and “UR-7/
atp8” regions at the 5’- and 3’-end respectively (see

Figure 1 and Table 1). In male mitochondrial genome,
the two copies of cox2 are close to each other and
linked by a little non coding region 41 bp long (UR-6).
The two cox2 copies are located between “cox1/UR-5”
and “UR-7/atp8“ regions, and the first is 813 bp long,
while the second is 690 bp long (Figure 2 and Table 2).
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses on Fcox2, Mcox2(690
bp), Mcox2(813 bp) genes and their homologous in
Mytilus species, demonstrated that Fcox2 is more closely
related to the shorter Mcox2 (690 bp), rather than to the
longer one (Figure 6). For this reason, the 813 bp long
Mcox2 seems to be an extra copy of the gene, and thus
it is referred here as Mcox2b.

Discussion
Gene content and order of F and M Mitochondrial
genomes in M. senhousia

In M. senhousia both M and F mtDNAs share the same
gene content and order, except for a duplicated cox2
gene in males, and include the typical gene content of
bivalve mtDNA. It has to be noted, however, that a
common feature of bivalves is the apparent lack of the
atp8 gene. For instance, [2] mentioned that a lack of the
atp8 gene is one of several unusual features of the Mytilus mt sequence. The atp8 gene was considered missing
for almost all bivalve species studied so far, including
Crassostrea hongkongensis, C. gigas, C. virginica, Placopecten magellanicus, Argopecten irradians, Mizuhopecten
yessoensis and Acanthocardia tuberculata. On the contrary, the apt8 gene was found in Hiatella arctica, as
well as in the female mitochondrial genome of the
unionid bivalve L. ornata [28]. A remarkable observation
is that V. philippinarum, another species with DUI [57],
was recently found to contain a putative atp8 gene [58],
which was not found in the first analyses; nonetheless,
this gene apparently encodes 37 amino acids only and
therefore has a questionable gene function. Finally, [23]
examined ORFs from several bivalve mitochondrial genomes and found two novel ORFs (F-orf-ur4 and M-orfur4) in the largest unassigned region of F and M mytilid
ones (UR-4: see [33]). BLASTN searches against EST_others (all ESTs except human and mouse) showed that

both are transcribed in Mytilus spp. BLASTX and PSIBLAST searches using inferred aminoacid sequences of
F-orf-ur4 and M-orf-ur4 failed to detect any significant
sequence similarity with known proteins, so the identity
of those putative proteins is still unclear. Further analyses on structure and evolution patterns suggested that
the novel ORFs “represent good candidates for the previously ‘missing’ atp8 in mytilid mtDNAs” [23]. Therefore, following [23], we also found atp8 putative genes
in both sex-linked mitochondrial genomes of M. senhousia. Our atp8 genes share the same characteristics of the
above mentioned proteins, so we are confident to annotate them as Musculista atp8 genes.
Generally speaking, most mtDNAs are characterized
by strand asymmetry in term of gene distribution. In
both M. senhousia mt genomes, all genes are transcribed
from the same strand, i.e. the asymmetry is at its highest
among Metazoa. Most marine bivalves also share this
feature (Mytilus species-complex, C. gigas, C. virginica,
C. hongkongensis and V. philippinarum). In contrast,
this is not true for the two freshwater species L. ornata
[28] and Inversidens japanensis (Acc. No. AB055625 and
AB055624) (see also [59]). In other mollusks, a relatively
small number of mitochondrial genes are transcribed
from the second strand. The scaphopods G. eborea and
S. lobatum are an exception, with about an equal number of genes encoded by each strand [31,58]. The occurrence of all genes in the same strand is a relatively rare
phenomenon in metazoans and, in addition to bivalves,
it has been reported in some annelids (Lumbricus terrestris, [60]; Platynereis dumerilii, [61]) and brachiopods
(Terebratulina retusa, [62]; Terebratalia transversa, [42];
Laqueus rubellus, [63]). Actually, almost 10% of the
mitochondrial genomes examined to date do have all
genes encoded in the same strand [10]. Moreover, most
of the above mentioned groups, including Bivalvia, are
also characterized by strong differences in gene content
and/or gene order. This allowed [10] to suggest a possible correlation between these two features.
The trnS(AGN) could not be located with tRNAscanSE [64] because of the absence of the DHU arm and
therefore of a normal cloverleaf structure (see [27] for a
detailed discussion), so we used the ARWEN software

copies of trnS(UCN), while Mizuhopecten yessoensis
seems to lack a Serine tRNA. [68] suggested that the
secondary structure of a tRNA gene between a pair of
protein genes is responsible for the precise cleavage of
the polycistronic primary transcript. In the absence of a
tRNA, this role can be played by a stem-loop structure,
the 5’-end part of the gene itself, or a combination of
the two. Potential hairpin structures at protein-protein
gene junctions with no intervening tRNA have been
reported in several studies (e.g., [6,33,39,69,70]). Our

analysis demonstrated that putative hairpins are present
in all the gene junctions in which a tRNA lacks, suggesting a functional role of such intergenic sequences (Figure 3).

local fold symmetry created by the palindrome is
thought to provide the site for DNA-binding proteins
involved in the trascriptional machinery [71]. In more
detail, palindromic motifs (and in general inverted
repeats) have the potential to form single-stranded
stem-loop cruciform structures which have been
reported to be essential for replication of circular genomes in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems [72].
The redundancy of palindromic elements in the Musculista male LUR, when compared to that of the female,
may be possibly related to an increased duplication ratio
of the M mtDNA; we can also speculate that this feature
may have some role in the process by which sperm
mitochondrial DNA becomes dominant or exclusive of
the male germline, although we know that this is also
achieved through a differential segregation during early
embryo development, and likely through a second, more
strict, selection during primordial germ cells establishment (see [73]). Nevertheless, the question of how
sperm mitochondrial DNA becomes dominant or the

The duplication of the cox2 gene

One noteworthy finding of this analysis is the cox2 gene
duplication in the male mtDNA, with the duplicated
gene being longer than the original one, a feature that
might be somehow related to DUI. In fact, an interesting analogy is evident with unionid bivalves, in which
the male cox2 gene show a 200-codon extension, which
is absent in the female mtDNA. Such a feature is found
in all analyzed unionids so far, and it has been related
to DUI functioning [21,22,74-76]. Actually, [21,22] proposed several hypotheses for the role the cox2 extension
may have for DUI, but all are dependent upon identifying a specific function for it, which is not a trivial task.
Moreover, they detected in the male gonad a poly-adenylated mRNA transcript of the cox2 gene that includes
the extension, and they concluded that the extension is
protein-coding and functional.
[21,22] also hypothesized that the COX2 protein
extension might be involved in intracellular interactions
determining the survival of the male mitochondrion. In
other organisms, it has been shown that upon fertilization the sperm-derived mitochondria are targeted for
elimination: a key process in sperm mitochondrial
degradation is ubiquitination [77], in which mitochondria of paternal derivation are tagged with Ubiquitin
and then degraded. In Mytilus, in which an Ubiquitinlike process has been proposed, this degradation would
be sex-specific: the sperm-derived mitochondria survive
in male embryos, whereas they are eliminated in
females. All that considered, [21] proposed that the
COX2 extension could be involved in blocking such
elimination to ensure survival of the male mitochondrion, or, alternatively, the extension could play a role
in the segregation of male mitochondria to the gonad.
In either case, it should be possible to detect the protein
product of the extension outside of the inner

mitochondrial membrane. An in situ hybridization
seemed to demonstrate that the unionid male COX2 is
present on both inner and outer membranes of the
sperm mitochondria (see Figure 4 in [74]).
According to the above mentioned rationales, we
hypothesize that the duplicated cox2b gene in male M.
senhousia may represent a variant of what found in
unionoidean bivalves, with proper signals for DUI mitochondrial tagging lying in the COX2 protein extension
of unionid bivalves, as well as in the duplicated COX2b
protein of Musculista. A support to this view comes
from the observation that an additional putative Trans
Membrane Helix (TMH) is found in the 41 residue long
tail of the Musculista COX2b, although this tail is considerably shorter that the unionid one (200 amminoacids). Actually, five putative TMHs were found in the
unionid extended C-terminus of the male COX2, which
led the Authors to hypothesize that it may have a functional significance for male unionoidean bivalve reproductive success [75,76].

In analogy, we suggest that COX2b might have some
function related to mitochondrial tagging, like the
COX2b and the Unionid COX2 extension. Further studies are needed to gain a more clear role of such proteins in the unusual DUI system of mitochondrial
inheritance. Actually, a duplication similar to the Musculista one was also found in V. philippinarum, but
quite surprisingly in the female mtDNA (see unpublished GenBank annotation). This suggests that cox2
duplication may be uncoupled with maleness. Moreover,
no Mytilus genomes show a similar situation for cox2 or
any other gene, so either duplicated genes or a cox2 tail
may not be strictly necessary to sustain DUI.

Conclusions
The characteristics of the Musculista sex-linked
mtDNAs evidently add to the knowledge of DUI systems, and highlight some unexpected features, shared
among distantly related DUI species. Since it is commonly accepted that DUI is rather a variation of Strict

Maternal Inheritance, than a completely different
mechanism, we think that DUI is a good experimental
model to better understand the general rules, as well as
the molecular features of Metazoan mitochondrial
inheritance (see [18], for a detailed discussion). For the
above mentioned reasons, the complete mtDNA genome
characterization of DUI bivalves is not only a mere
descriptive exercise, but rather a first step to unravel the
complex genetic signals allowing Doubly Uniparental
Inheritance of mitochondrial DNA, and the evolutionary
implications of such unusual transmission route in mitochondrial genome evolution in Bivalvia.

Methods
Sample Collection

Alive M. senhousia specimens from Venice Lagoon
(Italy) were used for this analysis. Males and females
were stimulated to spawn gametes in seawater supplemented with hydrogen peroxide, according to [78]. Each
emission was analyzed with a light microscope to sex
specimens. A total of 10 sperm and 10 egg samples
were then collected after a gentle centrifugation (3,000
g). Seawater was removed, and ethanol added before
storing samples at -20°C.
PCR analyses

Total genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy
Tissue Kit (Qiagen), and partial sequences of cytochrome b (cob) and mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit RNA (rrnL) were amplified and directly sequenced
(primers reported in Table 8), as described in [79].
Sequencing reactions were performed on both strands
with BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit according
to supplier’s instructions (Applied Biosystem) in a 310
Genetic Analyzer (ABI) automatic sequencer.
The 20 sequences obtained for both F and M genomes were aligned (not shown), and, after checking for
variable sites, used to design sex-specific primers to
amplify the entire mitochondrial genome in two overlapping fragments by long PCR reactions. LongPCR was
performed on one Musculista specimen per sex. To
obtain the F genome, F-cob383R and F-16S142F

primers were used. The M genome was amplified with
M-cob386R and M-16S103F. Both pairs of primers
amplified a fragment of 10-11 kb respectively. Long
PCR primer sequences are reported in Table 1.
LongPCR amplifications were performed on a Gene
Amp® PCR System 2720 (Applied Biosystem) in 50 μl
reaction volume composed of 31.5 μl of sterilized distilled water, 10 μl of 5 × Herculase II Fusion Reaction
Buffer, 0.5 μl of dNTPs mix (25 mM each dNTP), 1.25
μl of each primer (10 μM), 5 μl of DNA template (2550 ng) and 0.5 μl of Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase. Reaction conditions were according to supplier’s
recommendations: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min
and then incubated at 95°C for 20 s, 50°C for 20 s, and
68°C for 10 min for 30 cycles and 68°C for 8 min for a
final extension. Long-PCR fragments were then purified
using Wizard ® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System
(Promega).
Shotgun cloning

Sequencing of the two LongPCR fragments was done
using shotgun cloning: amplicons were randomly
sheared to 1.2-1.5 kb DNA segments using a HydroShear device (GeneMachines). Sheared DNA was blunt
end repaired at room temperature for 60 min using 6 U
of T4 DNA Polymerase (Roche), 30 U of DNA Polymerase I Klenow (NEB), 10 μl of dNTPs mix, 13 μl of 10 ×
NEB buffer 2 in a 115 μl total volume, and then gel purified using the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). The resulting fragments were ligated
into the SmaI site of a pUC18 cloning vector using the
Fast-Link DNA ligation Kit (Epicentre) and electroporated into One Shot® TOP10 Electrocomp™ Escherichia
coli cells (Invitrogen) using standard protocols. Clones
were screened by PCR using M13 universal primers and
recombinants were purified using Multiscreen (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Clones were sequenced using M13 universal primers by
Macrogen Inc. (Korea).
Raw sequences were manually corrected, and then
assembled into contigs with Sequencher v.4.6 (Gene
Codes). Hence, the final assemblies were based on a
minimum sequence coverage of 3×.

The tRNA genes were identified by their secondary
structure using ARWEN [65], with invertebrate mitochondrial codon predictors. Analysis of Open Reading
Frames (ORFs) was performed with the ORF Finder
program of NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/
gorf/ using the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code.
Sequences were identified using BLASTX, PSI-BLAST
[80] and BLASTN [81] as implemented by the NCBI
website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.

For all protein coding genes, alignments were computed with ClustalW [82].
When analyzing sequence variability, pairwise p-Distances (pD), their mean values and standard errors (by
the bootstrap procedure) were computed with MEGA
v.5.03 [83]. In order to avoid any model of DNA substitution that can affect statistics (see [79]), the use of a
pD was preferred.
The divergence of protein genes in synonymous (Ks)
and non-synonymous (Ka) sites was calculated by the
modified Nei-Gojobori method with the Jukes-Cantor
correction; the pD at the residue level was also calculated within the MEGA v.5.03 environment [83].
Two-fold, and four-fold degenerated positions were
identified using DnaSP v.5 [84]. The Sequence Manipulation Suite (http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2; [85])
was used to estimate codon usage. Potential DNA secondary structures near or at the 5’-end of protein genes
were predicted using the UNAFold software package
[86] available on the DINAMelt web server (http://
mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt; [86]).
Bayesian analyses on cox2 genes was performed with
the MrBayes 3.1 (5,000,000 generations; [87]).
