Abstract
Background: Whole genome sequence data is a step towards generating the 'parts list' of life to understand the
underlying principles of Biocomplexity. Genome sequencing initiatives of human and model organisms are
targeted efforts towards understanding principles of evolution with an application envisaged to improve human
health. These efforts culminated in the development of dedicated resources. Whereas a large number of viral
genomes have been sequenced by groups or individuals with an interest to study antigenic variation amongst
strains and species. These independent efforts enabled viruses to attain the status of 'best-represented taxa' with
the highest number of genomes. However, due to lack of concerted efforts, viral genomic sequences merely
remained as entries in the public repositories until recently.
Results: VirGen is a curated resource of viral genomes and their analyses. Since its first release, it has grown
both in terms of coverage of viral families and development of new modules for annotation and analysis. The
current release (2.0) includes data for twenty-five families with broad host range as against eight in the first
release. The taxonomic description of viruses in VirGen is in accordance with the ICTV nomenclature. A wellcharacterised strain is identified as a 'representative entry' for every viral species. This non-redundant dataset is
used for subsequent annotation and analyses using sequenced-based Bioinformatics approaches. VirGen archives
precomputed data on genome and proteome comparisons. A new data module that provides structures of viral
proteins available in PDB has been incorporated recently. One of the unique features of VirGen is predicted
conformational and sequential epitopes of known antigenic proteins using in-house developed algorithms, a step
towards reverse vaccinology.
Conclusion: Structured organization of genomic data facilitates use of data mining tools, which provides
opportunities for knowledge discovery. One of the approaches to achieve this goal is to carry out functional
annotations using comparative genomics. VirGen, a comprehensive viral genome resource that serves as an
annotation and analysis pipeline has been developed for the curation of public domain viral genome data http://

Background

Results & Discussion

The emergence of high throughput technologies for
genome sequencing, microarrays and proteomics transformed biology into a data-rich information science.
Sequencing the complete genome of an organism is the
first step in generating the 'parts list' of life. One of the first
efforts involved sequencing of Haemophilus influenzae in
1995 [1]. As of July 2006, more than 403 organisms have
been sequenced completely. Furthermore, the genome
sequencing projects of ~932 prokaryotic and ~608 eukaryotic species have been launched [2]. Enormous data generated by the genome sequencing projects is archived in
both dedicated genomic resources and public domain
databases. While the complete genome sequencing of the
model organisms and microbes are taking the centerstage, viral genome sequencing continue to be individual
efforts [3]. Viruses are a diverse group of organisms and
are most abundant [4,5]. The genome size of viruses varies
from a few hundreds to millions of bases [6,7]. SV-40 was
the first virus for which the complete genome (5,224 bp)
sequence was obtained in late 70s [8]. About ~4000
viruses have been sequenced so far by virologists all over
the world with an objective to study antigenic variation,
geographic distribution, spread and evolution. These
independent efforts enabled viruses to attain the status of
'best-represented taxa' with the highest number of whole
genomes sequenced. However, due to lack of concerted
efforts, viral genomic sequences only added to the entries
in the public repositories until recently. The GOLD
(Genome OnLine Database) is a tracking system for
genome sequencing and provides the update of various
genome-sequencing projects [2] but does not have any
mechanism to specifically monitor viral genome sequencing initiatives.

VirGen: genome annotation & comparative genomics
pipeline
VirGen is developed and maintained at the Bioinformatics
Centre, University of Pune and is available on-line
[19,20]. VirGen has grown since its initial release wherein
data pertaining to eight viral families was archived. With
every release new data in terms of viral families (Table 1)
and utilities for analysis have been incorporated. In addition to the guided tour, release notes and statistics, VirGen
provides a sitemap, which can also be used as a starting
point for navigation. A new module that archives viral
protein patterns is also due for release.

Whole genome sequence data of viruses offer unlimited
opportunities for data mining and knowledge discovery
[9]. The complete genome sequences of two large viral
genomes viz., Mimivirus [7] and Polydnavirus [10] substantiate this fact. Varying coding density and the occurrence
of genes associated with metabolic pathways in these
DNA viruses offers interesting opportunities in viral
genomics in general and in understanding evolution of
viruses in particular [11]. However, it is known that in the
absence of curation and functional annotation of the
genomic data, the utility of the sequence data is minimal
and the sequence merely remains as an entry in the database. Bioinformatics provides large number of databases,
tools and approaches for mining huge sequence data.
Although there exist numerous genome databases for the
model organisms and microbes, there are a few databases,
which archive viral genomic data [12,13]. Most of these
databases are synthesis of experimental work carried out
in the respective laboratories. As a result, these compilations are highly specialized [14-18].

The major focus of this paper is towards sharing with the
research community the issues involved in curation of
viral genomic data apart from demonstrating the utility of
the derived data in understanding the biology, a pre-requisite for development of viral diagnostics, vaccines and
drugs.
Current status
The release (v2.0, dated August 15, 2006) contains
genomic data of 25 viral families (Table 2) that include
2895 genomes and 23121 annotated proteins. As can be
seen, genomic data for both, DNA and RNA viruses infecting animals, plants and microbial species are included in
VirGen.

Issues involved in curation of viral genomes
Genome sequences deposited in the public domain
sequence repositories were retrieved using well-defined
search strategies. The queries were formatted using keywords and MeSH terms to ensure that none of the complete genome sequences were missed. The entries were
curated with respect to taxonomic hierarchy as per the

guidelines provided by the ICTV [21]. For many entries,
the names of viral strains/isolates were not explicitly
present in the field 'organism source' but were available as
a part of feature table annotations. It was also observed
that in case of a few entries, although the published reference explicitly documented the strain information along
with the accession numbers, the same was missing in the
sequence record. Such entries were curated manually.
In case of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), the curation of genomic
records for assignment of genotypes called for exhaustive
sequence analyses. Hepatitis C virus is a member of family
Flaviviridae, genus Hepacivirus and is a major causative

agent of liver diseases. The assignment of Hepatitis C virus
genotypes is essential as molecular epidemiology differs
from subtype to subtype. Also, due to the absence of significant cross-protection among different HCV subtypes,
the exact subtype identification becomes a prerequisite in
determining the suitability of present antiviral therapy as
well as designing new antiviral compounds and vaccines
[22]. Isolation of HCV by standard immunological and
virological techniques [23] is rather difficult. Efforts to
classify HCV at type and subtype level are based on molecular phylogeny using 5'UTR and core, NS3, NS4 & NS5
respectively [24]. However, absence of significant
sequence variation in 5'UTR limits its usage for classification only up to genotype level [25]. Furthermore, intratypic crossing over events have been reported in some of
the HCV genotypes [26]. Given this scenario, use of a single gene or genomic region may lead to inaccuracies in
genotype assignment of HCV. During the process of curation of HCV genomic sequences for incorporation into
VirGen, it was found that a majority of the genomic
records in the public domain repositories lacked the information on genotype. An approach based on whole
genome phylogeny was used to assign the genotypes.
These assignments were further substantiated through literature search. More than 130 records of HCV were annotated and added to VirGen using this process.
Identification of putative genomic records
It was observed that there were many sequences in the
public domain repositories, which were not explicitly
annotated with keywords such as full or whole or complete genome even though their sequence lengths were in
the typical range of the complete genome sequence for a
given species. Such sequences, which are not explicitly
annotated as the complete genome entries have been
referred to as 'putative genomes' in VirGen [19].
Identification of reference dataset
As there exist multiple genomic entries for every viral species, a well-annotated and characterized entry has been
identified as the 'representative genomic entry' for a given
species. The representative entries provide a non-redundant set of viral genome sequences, which are subsequently used for annotation of genomic records,
alignment of genomes and proteomes and to study phylogenetic relationships.
Curation and annotation of complete genomes
VirGen uses sequence-based Bioinformatics approaches
and stringent cutoffs for annotating the viral genomes and
proteomes. Entries are annotated with respect to the
genome organisation, typical to a given family. The annotations are further refined to accommodate genus and species-specific organisation. Using the representative
genomes and the program BLAST [27], the entries are

annotated with respect to individual coding sequences
(cds), polyprotein(s) and individual proteins as described
previously [19].
Compilation of synonyms for viral proteins
One of the issues in curation of molecular data is lack of
standard nomenclature. VirGen addresses this issue by
implementing sequence-based searching to compile a dictionary of synonyms for viral proteins [19,28]. Such a
compilation is essential not only in automating the annotation procedure but also to enhance quality of annotations. This dictionary of controlled vocabulary of protein
names is used in the back-end for enhancing the utility of
keyword-based searches in VirGen. Figure 2 shows tabular
display of genome organisation along with list of alternate
names for membrane protein of Japanese encephalitis virus
strain JaOArS982.
Derived data & its applications
Graphical genome view
The schematic representation of the viral genome/proteome organisation using scalable vector graphics (SVG)
has enabled visualization of individual gene/protein in
the context of the entire genome. This display also facilitates retrieval of gene/protein sequence data in FASTA format, a procedure which may otherwise require a lot of preprocessing. The genome organisation of the Bovine Viral
Diahorrea Virus 1 (BVDV-1) virus is shown in the Figure 3.
As can be seen, a stretch of 996 nucleotides (891–1787
bp) do not have any annotation. A search of this sequence
using BLAST against the viral division of GenBank did not
provide any hit indicating a non-viral origin for the
sequence. Subsequent search against the nr database
picked up a few entries of J-domain containing protein
from Bos taurus, with statistically significant scores, indicating that the sequence was acquired by BVDV-1 from its
host, the bovine, through a process of horizontal transfer.
BVDV is known to acquire such heterologous and homologous inserts [29].
Genome scale multiple sequence alignment
Comparative genomics inadvertently includes multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) in a major way, as the inferences drawn are very informative. Viruses being one of the
smallest replicating species are under severe selection
pressure not only to evade host immune response but also
to sustain its survival in the vector. Availability of genome
data of viruses offers opportunities to study variations at
molecular level.

Bioinformatics tools like MSA can be used to identify such
variations, which when mapped on phenotypic properties
like antigenicity, immunogenicity etc. may provide a
rationale for the observed strain and species-specificity.

with the predicted 3D structures were used to study strain
specificity of mumps virus [30].
MSA module in VirGen is computed using the parallel version of ClustalW [31]. Multiple sequence alignment of
viral genome and proteome at different levels of taxonomic hierarchy, apart from being a prerequisite for phylogenetic analysis and mapping of predicted B and T-cell
epitopes, help to detect species and strain-specific signature sequences and in primer design. The MSA module
can also be browsed independently to access alignments
and dendrograms.
As an example, multiple sequence alignment of NS3 protein for the 26 representative species of genus Flavivirus is
discussed. Variability Index, calculated using the formulae
proposed by Wu & Kabat [32] for MSA of NS3 is shown in
the Figure 4. Variability Index provides information about
the extent of sequence conservation/variation at a given
position in the multiple sequence alignment. As can be
seen from Figure 4, the variability index values range from
1 to 71.5, wherein the value 1 indicates that the residue is

conserved at a given position. A total of 64 amino acid residues spread across the alignment spanning 652 positions
are conserved. The serine protease catalytic triad of NS3
comprising Histidine, Aspartate and Serine (Alignment
positions 56, 80 and 141 respectively) are also conserved.
The alignment position accounting for the highest variability is 349. A closer look at the alignment shows that 11
distinct amino acids viz., His, Asn, Ala, Glu, Gln, Ile, Val,
Met, Thr, Ser, Cys are found to occur at that position. One
of the blocks of MSA showing conserved residues is
shown in Figure 5. This data was used to derive genus-specific signature 'T- [DN]-I- [AS]-E- [VM]-G-A-N' of NS3. To
assess the accuracy of this pattern, sensitivity and specificity values were calculated. A search against NCBI Taxonomy revealed that there exist 84 species in genus
Flavivirus, of which the amino acid sequence data for NS3
is available only for 30 species. The pattern derived using
VirGen representative data, picks up all the 30 species. No
false positives were picked up. Hence, the sensitivity and
specificity of the pattern is 100%. The search against pattern database, Prosite [33] revealed that the reported pattern is novel.

It must be mentioned that these calculations require a
curated non-redundant data set that includes NS3 protein
sequences of all the known species belonging to genus Flavivirus. However, due to availability of limited annotations and NS3 sequence being part of polyprotein entries
in the public domain databases, the curation process
could not be automated completely and required manual
intervention. Thus, the entire procedure of generating a
curated dataset for calculation of sensitivity and specificity
of any pattern is time-consuming and calls for inclusion
of steps that are specific for a given data set.
Multiple sequence alignment can also be used to understand the strain-specific variations. A block of multiple
sequence alignment of envelope glycoprotein (Egp) of 47
strains of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is shown in Figure 6. Important biological activities like hemagglutination, viral neutralization, virion assembly; membrane
fusion and viral binding to cellular receptors are known to
be associated with the 53 kD Egp protein of JEV [34-36].
Egp contains ~500 residues and folds into three structural
domains [37,38]. Of the 500 residues, 318 (63.6%) are
conserved, which amounts to 36.4% of variation. This
variation can be attributed to high selection pressure on
Egp due to its antigenicity as well as the need to maintain
the strain-specific properties. Of the 182 variable positions, singletons account for 100 positions, leaving only
82 sites with information content for phylogenetic analy-

ses. However, singleton sites like K279M play a deterministic role in maintaining neurovirulence [39].
Furthermore, the 399-RGD-401 sequence motif, present
in domain III is unique to the mosquito-borne Flaviviruses and was proposed to form a part of receptor binding
site [40,41]. The mutations found within the loop containing the RGD motif are known to alter tropism or virulence in different Flaviviruses [42]. MSA of 47 strains of
JEV Egp show mutations in this region, leading to occurrence of seven unique tripeptides (RGE, RGH, RGG, RKD,
RED, RGN, MGD). Curation and MSA of Egp sequences
from additional 88 JEV strains revealed that IGD also
occurs in place of RGD. All tripeptides except MGD and
RGN are naturally occurring. MGD was observed in the
attenuated strain (GenPept Accession: 6970068) [42].
Similarly RGN was observed in a strain, which was passaged in Neuro-2a cells (GenPept Accession: 34495383).
The RED tripeptide is present in a highly neurovirulent
and neuroinvasive strain P3 (GenPept Accession:
1488031) [43]. Thus, every variation is significant and can
be correlated with functionality in the context of selection
pressure.
Reconstruction of phylogeny using complete genomes
Molecular phylogenetic studies help to decipher the evolution of viruses and offer a mechanism to understand the
origin and spread of infectious viral diseases. Phylogenetic
trees are usually reconstructed using a single gene/protein

or a region encompassing them [44]. UTRs have also been
used to study phylogenetic relationships [45]. It was
shown that the phylogenetic noise is minimum when
whole genome sequence data was used for reconstruction
of phylogeny [46]. However, phylogenetic analyses using
whole genome data require curation with respect to
recombination and insertion sites [47]. Also the use of
whole genome phylogeny has been restricted due its compute-intensive nature. The phylogeny module of VirGen
includes the whole genome phylogenetic trees obtained
using a parallel version of the PHYLIP (Felsenstein, J.,
Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle and Silicon Graphics Incorporation) implemented on
SGI Onyx 300, a 4 processor parallel machine. The parameters for phylogenetic analysis in VirGen are as described
previously [19]. Whole genome phylogenetic analysis
facilitates identification of unclassified viruses and when
coupled with the antigenicity data, assists in the identification of viral strains, isolated during epidemics.

Reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree of family Flaviviridae
generated using whole genome data is shown in the Figure
7. Confidence of the tree was evaluated using bootstrap
data of 1000 replicates. The unrooted, most parsimonious
tree obtained for 56 species belonging to the genera Flavivirus, Pestivirus and Hepacivirus clearly depicts the clustering of viruses as per their assigned genus. The tree also
shows grouping of Flaviviruses into the mosquito-borne,
tick-borne and no known vector clades. The mosquitoborne viruses show further separation into two clades
namely, those which are transmitted through Aedes and
through Culex. As can be seen from the figure 7, viruses
transmitted by Aedes form two paraphyletic clades; one
clade is made up of Yellow fever virus and Yokose virus and
the other clade contains Dengue virustypesI, II, III and IV.
Cell fusing Agent virus (CFAV) and Kamiti River virus (KRV),
though transmitted by Aedes form a separate clade. Even
though they share common ancestor with other mosquito-borne viruses, the fact that they are known to be

insect-only and fail to replicate in the vertebrate cells or
mice explains the observed branching pattern [48].
Viruses transmitted by Culex mosquito form a monophyletic clade. The branching pattern of the tick-borne
Flaviviruses is gradual as compared to the dispersed
branching of mosquito-borne clades. This could be attributed to the duration of life cycle of their respective vectors
and vectors association with host [47]. Tamana Bat virus
(TABV) branches out separately from rest of the Flavivirus
members possibly due to its sequence divergence. The tree
also shows that the Pestiviruses form a polyphyletic clade
with the mosquito-borne Flaviviruses. Border Disease virus
(BDV), Pestivirus Reindeer (PERSE) and Classical Swine
Fever virus (CSFV) form a group where as Bovine viral
diarrhea virus-1 (BVDV-1) and Pestivirus Giraffe (PESGI)
group separately. Bovine viral diarrhea virus-2 (BVDV-2)
branched out prior to the branching of other Pestiviruses.

The branching of all six genotypes of Hepatitis C virus is
also clearly seen. The tree shows that the unassigned
members of Flaviviridae family form a polyphyletic clade
with the Hepaciviruses, the outermost branch of which is
GB virus B (GBV-B). The latest report of ICTV documents
inclusion of GBV-B as a member of genus Hepacivirus.
Phylogenetic tree reconstructed using the polyprotein
data showed similar branching topology.
Genome to Vaccinome: compilation of predicted epitopes
Availability of genomic sequences has paved way for in silico design of vaccines, a field popularly known as 'reverse
vaccinology' [49]. One of the prerequisites for in silico vaccine design is the availability of a curated data set of antigenic proteins and a set of programs for prediction of
epitopes. As a step towards reverse vaccinology, VirGen
stores predicted B-cell epitopes of antigenic proteins using

sequence-based and structure-based algorithms developed in-house [50-52].
Kolaskar & Tongaonkar's method is a sequence-based
approach for prediction of B-cell epitopes. The algorithm
is based on antigenic propensity, which is assigned to each
of the twenty amino acids depending on their frequency
of occurrence in experimentally determined B cell
epitopes. Parameters like hydrophilicity, accessibility and
flexibility are averaged for every overlapping heptapeptide
from N to C terminii and assigned to the central residue
of every segment. The residues having average antigenic
propensity ≥ 1.0 are termed as potential antigenic determinants. The accuracy of this method is ~75% and has
been implemented in major sequence analysis packages
viz, GCG [53] and EMBOSS [54]. VirGen contains the predicted epitopes of known antigenic proteins. However, if
one wants to predict the B-cell epitopes for any other proteins of interest, using Kolaskar & Tongaonkar approach,
a link is provided to the Antigenic program of EMBOSS.
Conformational Epitope Prediction (CEP) algorithm
developed
in-house
implements
structure-based
approach for prediction of sequential and conformational
epitopes [37,51]. CEP server, for the first time allows mapping of antibody-binding sites on protein antigens with
known structures [52]. The algorithm uses accessibility of
residues and spatial distance cut-off. The major steps
involve identification of at least three consecutive accessible residues to delineate antigenic determinants, extension of the same towards N and C terminii and prediction
of conformational epitopes by collapsing antigenic determinants that are within the spatial proximity of 6Å. Accuracy of the algorithm is 75% when calculated using cocrystal structure data of antigen-antibody complexes from
PDB. The CEP server provides a graphical interface for visualisation of predicted epitopes. Figure 8 shows solvent
accessible surface of one of the predicted conformational
epitopes of envelope glycoprotein of Dengue virus II
(PDBID:1OAN) [55]. This conformational epitope is
made up of two sequential epitopes 342–350 and 382–
394. The antigenicity of the predicted epitope 382–394
has been experimentally validated previously [56]. The
epitope predictions using the CEP algorithm are limited
by the availability of three-dimensional structures of viral
proteins. However, we strongly believe that with the structural genomics initiatives and availability of reliable
approaches such as homology modeling and fold recognition, the three-dimensional structure data on viral proteins will no longer be a rate-limiting factor.
Module for Viral structures
Three-dimensional structural data is essential to understand function of proteins at molecular level. The 3D
structures of proteins are known to be conserved and can

accommodate sequence variation up to 80%. Structures of
~1082 viral proteins and viral assemblies have been
solved and 3D coordinates are available in the PDB [57].
Structural genomics initiatives for viruses have been
launched recently and are limited to a few viral species
such as SARS [58] and Poxvirus [59]. VirGen includes a
module for viral structures that are deposited in PDB. The
PDB entries have been curated with respect to the description of organism source, as variations were found in the
same. The viral structures can be searched using PDB ID as
well as protein and organism description. Precomputed
results of conformational epitope prediction or probable
antibody-binding sites are also made available for these
structures. The structure module facilitates identification
of templates for knowledge-based homology modeling
and identification of targets for structural genomics initiatives. Using homology-modeling approach, the structures of envelope glycoprotein of two strains of Japanese
encephalitis virus have been predicted. These models were
used to design candidates for peptide vaccine for Japanese
encephalitis and helped to gain an insight into strain-specific variations [37,38].
Comparative genomics to understand species-specificity
Analyses of curated data of whole genomes and proteomes reveals molecular variations, which when correlated with the observed phenotype provide a rationale for
species-specific properties. As an attempt towards this,
molecular mechanism of polyprotein cleavage at NS3NS2B in JEV was modeled using the experimental data
available for related flaviviruses since NS3 is a candidate
for anti-viral therapy.

Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), a member of Flaviviridae
is a major causative agent of encephalitis in South-east
Asia [60], the 11 Kb genome of JEV (Figure 9) codes for a
polyprotein that is further, processed into 3 structural and
7 non-structural proteins by proteases of both, the host
and the virus itself. NS3 has two domains, 178 residues at
N' contains serine protease activity and ~450 residues at C'
has helicase activity. The dual activity of NS3 increases its
potential as a target for antiviral therapy. This viral protease is known to be highly efficient when associated with
a hydrophobic stretch of NS2B [61,62]. The two-component protease is required for the cis cleavage of NS2A/
NS2B and NS2B/NS3 as well as trans cleavage of NS3/
NS4A and NS4B/NS5 [63,64]. Molecular mechanism of
cleavage by NS3 has been studied in detail in Flaviviruses
such as Dengue type II [65-67], Hepatitis C virus [68], West
Nile virus [69] and Alkhurma virus [70]. Similar studies of
NS3 in JEV are restricted to biochemical characterisation
[71-73]. A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of cleavage by NS3 requires determination or simulation of the ternary complex comprising of NS3-NS2Bsubstrate. In the absence of crystal structure of JEV NS3, a

comparative modeling approach was used to predict its
structure. Since the functional protease is a two-component system, the structure of its cofactor, NS2B was predicted using molecular dynamics and its interactions were
studied using docking simulations. Ternary complex of
NS3-NS2B-substrate was then modeled to understand the
underlying mechanism.
Prediction of 3D structure of NS3
The 3D structure of NS3 serine protease domain of Japanese Encephalitis virus (Virulent SA-14-14-2 strain) was predicted using knowledge-based homology modeling

approach. Two models of NS3 serine protease of JEV were
built using the crystal structures of NS3 of Dengue virus II
(DEN) PDB_ID: 1BEF [74] and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
PDB_ID: 1JXP [75]. These templates showed remarkable
similarity in terms of fold (two, six β barrel domains that
are separated by a linker region), secondary structure content and conformation of active site. The sequence identity between NS3 of JEV with that of DEN and HCV is
47.16% and 13.3% respectively. The active site residues
His51, Asp75 and Ser135 are found to be conserved.
Sequence and structural alignments were used to identify
the structurally conserved regions (SCR) and loops.

The predicted structures were critically evaluated for stereochemical and geometrical correctness using multiple
methods. Overall G factor score for both the models calculated using Procheck [76] was found to be in the range
of -0.02 indicating that the models are well refined. Similarly, Z-scores calculated by ProsaII [77] were in the range
typical for globular proteins. The plot of combined energy
drawn using ProsaII indicated that the structure is energetically favourable (Figure 10a). Occupancy of (φ,ψ) angles
in the Ramachandran plot [78] was found to be 100% for
both the models. Furthermore, 91% occupancy was
observed in the core regions of the Ramachandran plot,
indicating the essential correctness of the predicted structures. The structural comparisons of both the models with

their respective templates showed rmsd of 1.1Å and 1.8Å
respectively. On the basis of evaluation of the models and
the secondary structural content, the structure predicted
using a template structure of Dengue virus II (1BEF) was
accepted and used for subsequent studies (see Figure
10b).
Modeling cofactor
A hydrophobic stretch of the non-structural protein 2B
(NS2B), an integral membrane protein, serves as a cofactor for NS3 [61,72]. However, this sequence was not identified explicitly in JEV. A detailed analyses of the known
cofactors of NS3 belonging to Flaviviridae family and their
multiple sequence alignments combined with hydro-

pathic profiles generated using Kyte & Dolittle index [79]
helped to identify the putative hydrophobic stretch of
NS2B. The residues, thus mapped for JEV are 62-WEMDAAITGSSR-73. It is known that the binding of the NS2B
to NS3 is a co-translational event [65], where NS2B may
only be partially folded. The structure of only hydrophobic stretch mentioned above was predicted using multiple
MD simulations of 1ns duration. The peptide was found
to adopt helical conformation predominantly (data not
shown).
Docking Cofactor & NS3
In the initial phase, docking of NS3 serine protease with
the cofactor was carried out to study their interactions at
molecular level. The cofactor (NS2B) was first docked
onto NS3, followed by docking of substrate with the complex of NS2B-NS3.

The Kabsch & Sander secondary rendering of predicted
structure of NS3 and NS2B complex is shown in the Figure
11[80]. As can be seen, the binding of NS2B helps in stabilising the structure of NS3 by formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Out of 12 amino acid residues of
NS2B, 6 were found to form 8 the hydrogen bonds with 6
residues of NS3. The NS2B peptide in the complex was
found to adopt extended conformation in place of a helix.
The extended conformation of NS2B contributes to the
formation β- propeller-like domain in NS3 by serving as
one of the blades of the propeller.
Simulation of ternary complex
The exquisite selectivity of serine proteases for particular
substrate is a result of the existence of specific binding
sites on the enzyme for amino acid side chains of the substrate [81]. The substrate is oriented by binding of the
amino acid side chain of the P1 residue in the S1 pocket
(P1 is the substrate residue at the amino terminal, and P1'

is the residue at the carboxyl terminal of the scissile bond)
via hydrogen bond. It is known that the substrate binding
cleft of the Dengue virus II protease is not very extensive
and does not appear capable of providing specific interactions in the absence of NS2B activating peptide, with side
chains beyond P2 and P2' [74]. This observation is consistent with the heterogeneity of residues beyond these
sites as seen in flaviviral proteases.
NS3 of JEV cleaves the polyprotein at specific locations
having the sequence KR-GR (site between NS4B and NS5)
apart from other known cleavage sites. In the absence of
structural information of the substrate, the structure of six
residues (LKRGRP) flanking on either side of the NS4B/
NS5 cleavage site was predicted using the MD strategy
described for NS2B. The ternary complex was obtained by
docking of substrate to NS3-NS2B complex using the
docking protocol mentioned above. Of the 100 docked

structures, 23 were selected based on geometry and the
interactions with NS3. It was observed that the van der
Waal interactions contributed maximally towards the
overall interaction energy. The active site residues His51
and Ser135 were found to interact with Leucine of the substrate via the formation of hydrogen bonds (see Figure
12). The two Arginine residues of the substrate also interact with Thr52 and Thr54 of NS3, both of which are part
of the binding site.
Table 3 shows the amino acid residues of NS3 binding
pocket of DEN and JEV respectively. As can be seen in the
Figure 13, the binding pocket of NS3 of JEV has a deep
curvature as compared to DEN-NS3. The entire surface is
of NS3 except for the binding pocket is neutral. The localization of charged residues in the binding pocket is shown
in Figure 13. The substrate i.e., side chain atoms of Pn residues of the polypeptide interact with the binding pocket

account for the species-specific variation of the microenvironment. Thus, even though the overall fold of the protein is similar to other serine proteases, the
microenvironment of the binding pocket accounts for its
specificity. Such variations have implications in the design
of antiviral drugs.

studying the species-specific variations. Comparative
genomics studies of this kind enable expansion of the
available knowledgebase. The primary as well as the
value-added derived data in VirGen will be highly useful
not only in understanding the strain and species-specific
variations but will also serve as starting point for discovery
of diagnostic kits, antiviral drugs and vaccines. Furthermore, we believe that it would be a useful resource in analysing the outcome of metagenomics initiatives [82,5].

Conclusion

Methods

The reductionalist approach such as whole genome
sequencing enables understanding of life and its processes
at molecular level. However, the challenge in the postgenomic era is to establish the link between the genomic
parts and phenotypic features, which requires systematic
organisation and integration of various databases that
span the spectrum of Biocomplexity. VirGen is a comprehensive genomics resource for viruses. VirGen attempts to
compile and curate the whole genome sequences of
viruses. Various features and utilities to analyse viral
genome data has been discussed using a case study of family Flaviviridae. The NS3 case study involving prediction of
structure of enzyme, cofactor and docking of cofactor and
substrate to explain molecular mechanism of cleavage in
JEV demonstrates the utility of resources such as VirGen in

Data curation & annotations
Various sequence-based [27,31,32,50] and structurebased [37,51,52] bioinformatics approaches were used to
curate, annotate and analyse viral genome sequence data.
Perl scripts were used to retrieve, parse, populate and
update the database.
Homology modelling: NS3
The models were built using Homology module of Insight
II molecular modeling package. Amber-all atom force
field [83] and distance dependent dielectric constant of
4rij was used. The models were refined using steepest
descents and conjugate gradient methods, the detailed
protocol of which is described previously [37,38].

Molecular dynamics simulations: NS2B peptide (co-factor)
The initial conformation of the peptide WEMDAAITGSSR
was assigned randomly from the allowed region of the
Ramachandran plot. The equilibration was carried out for
100ps. Amber force field v1.6 and a distance dependent
dielectric constant of 4rij was used. The trajectory data was
sampled every 10ps, resulting in 100 frames per MD run.
The conformation that is most populated, having the least
energy and lying in the allowed region of Ramachandran
plot was identified for docking studies.
Molecular docking simulations: secondary and ternary
complexes
Docking studies were carried out using the Affinity module of InsightII.

The protocol used is as follows:
▪ Amber force field with implicit solvent model was
employed.

▪ Initially the ligand (NS2B/substrate) was placed near the
binding site.
▪ The residues of protein lying within 5Å radius from the
center of ligand were defined as 'movable atoms' whereas
the rest of the molecule was kept rigid during docking and
was defined as 'bulk set'.
▪ Ligand was flexible with respect to (φ,ψ) torsional
angles. Hydrogen bond donor and acceptor atoms were
defined for both the protein and the ligand. In order to
avoid displacement of the ligand far away from the active
site residues, the ligand was confined to 3Å radius.
▪ Initial coarse search was carried out using
Quartic_vdw_no_Coulb method in which coulombic
terms are not calculated thereby excluding electrostatic
interactions. This allows sampling of larger conformational space in a shorter time interval. 100 docked conformations were collected during this phase in which the

Page 18 of 21

ligand is subjected to random combinations of translational and rotational movements followed by 1000 steps
of minimization using conjugate gradients. The conformations lying within the energy range of 100 kcal and 1Å
RMS deviation were selected.
▪ The conformations collected in previous step were filtered using various parameters like orientation of ligand,
distance from the active-site residues and bad contacts, if
any.
▪ Twenty conformations satisfying above criteria were further refined in the second stage using Group_based
method in which non-bond interactions were calculated
using van der Waals and coulombic cutoffs of 15 and 10Å
respectively. The conformers so obtained were refined by
minimization of 100 steps of conjugate gradient followed
by 50 steps of simulated annealing starting at an initial
temperature of 500 K up to a final temperature of 300 K
with temperature leap of 4 K at each step. The Newton's
equations of motion were integrated using the Verlet algorithm [84] with a time step of 1fs using NVT ensemble.
Temperature control was achieved by direct scaling of
atom velocities. Finally, the conformers were minimized
to a gradient of 0.001 kcal/mole/Å or less using conjugate
gradients.
▪ The conformers were evaluated based on the interaction
energy, which is a sum total of van der Waal and coulombic interactions. The least energy conformer having favorable interactions with the residues in the binding pocket
was selected for further analysis.
