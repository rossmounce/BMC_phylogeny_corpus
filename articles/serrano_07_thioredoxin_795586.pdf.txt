Abstract
Background: Thioredoxin (TRX) is a powerful disulfide oxido-reductase that catalyzes a wide
spectrum of redox reactions in the cell. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of the TRX
system in the oxidative stress response in Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1.
Results: We have identified the trxB1-encoded thioredoxin reductase (TR) as a key enzyme in the
oxidative stress response of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1.
Overexpression of the trxB1 gene resulted in a 3-fold higher TR activity in comparison to the wildtype strain. Subsequently, higher TR activity was associated with an increased resistance towards
oxidative stress. We further determined the global transcriptional response to hydrogen peroxide
stress in the trxB1-overexpression and wild-type strains grown in continuous cultures. Hydrogen
peroxide stress and overproduction of TR collectively resulted in the up-regulation of 267 genes.
Additionally, gene expression profiling showed significant differential expression of 27 genes in the
trxB1-overexpression strain. Over expression of trxB1 was found to activate genes associated with
DNA repair and stress mechanisms as well as genes associated with the activity of biosynthetic
pathways for purine and sulfur-containing amino acids. A total of 16 genes showed a response to
both TR overproduction and hydrogen peroxide stress. These genes are involved in the purine
metabolism, energy metabolism (gapB) as well as in stress-response (groEL, npr2), and manganese
transport (mntH2).
Conclusion: Based on our findings we propose that overproduction of the trxB1-encoded TR in
L. plantarum improves tolerance towards oxidative stress. This response coincides with
simultaneous induction of a group of 16 transcripts of genes. Within this group of genes, most are
associated with oxidative stress response. The obtained crossover between datasets may explain
the phenotype of the trxB1-overexpression strain, which appears to be prepared for encountering
oxidative stress. This latter property can be used for engineering robustness towards oxidative
stress in industrial strains of L. plantarum.

Background
TRX was first characterized as a sole electron donor for
ribonucleotide reductase in Escherichia coli [1]. The catalytic activity of these oxido-reductases can be attributed to
the -CXXC- motif found in these proteins. At this cysteinerich site electrons are transferred from the reduced TRX
towards the substrate (proteins, disulfides, etc). The
resulting oxidized TRX is regenerated via thioredoxin
reductase (TR) using NADPH as a cofactor. Throughout
the years, studies on the effect of the ubiquitous and conserved TRX in cellular metabolism have revealed that it
plays a significant role in a variety of processes, including
oxidative stress, protein repair, and RNA biosynthesis [24].
Intensive research on the role of TRX and TR include the
use of transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. Studies with Bacillus subtilis and Oenococcus oeni showed that
gene trxA was induced under stress conditions like heat
and hydrogen peroxide stress [5,6]. In addition, gene
expression studies in E. coli elucidated that under hydrogen peroxide stress, OxyR (transcription regulator activated by hydrogen peroxide in the cell) exerts
transcription regulation on the TRX system [3]. Proteomic
studies in microorganisms have allowed the identification
of a range of TRX-targeted proteins via the use of a Tandem Affinity Purification tag. In addition, the in-vivo TRXinteracting proteins in Saccaromyces cerevisiae were identified using yeast two-hybrid systems [7]. Both proteomic
approaches revealed possible associations within the
complex networks of redox regulation in microorganisms
and TRX and underlines the broad impact of the TRX system in the metabolic and regulatory network of the cell.
The reducing power of the TRX system and the glutaredoxin system is essential for all organisms. Furthermore,
these two systems are suggested to be the only systems
that maintain the cytoplasm of the cell in the reduced
state [8]. While glutathione is found in eukaryotes and
Gram-negative bacteria, it has been reported that most
Gram-positive bacteria lack the ability to synthesize glutathione but rather import it from the environment. This
is the case for B. subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Lactobacillus plantarum [9]. In the latter organism the gene gshB
which is involved in the second step for the synthesis of
glutathione (glutathione synthase), has not been identified in the genome sequence [10]. Hence, it is believed
that in L. plantarum the TRX system is the only active thiolreducing system.
Little is known about the TRX system and its function in
L. plantarum. This flexible and versatile bacterium is a
member of the human gut microbiota, and is commonly
used in fermented foods. The purpose of this study is to
characterize the TRX system in L. plantarum WCFS1 pursu-

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/6/1/29

ing a functional genomics approach where transcriptomics, enzyme activity assays, and bioinformatics studies will
be used. This investigation clarifies the suggested roles of
TR in the response of L. plantarum WCFS1 to oxidative
stress. Finally, this study unveils the role of TRX reductase
or the TRX system as a redox sensor in the cell.

Results
In silico analysis of the TRX system
The annotated genome of L. plantarum WCFS1 [10]
reveals that the TRX system in this organism is composed
by six ORF's (Open Reading Frames). Four genes are
annotated as TRX encoding genes: trxA1 (lp_0236), trxA2
(lp_2270), trxA3 (lp_3437), and trxH (lp_2633). The
other two genes trxB1 (lp_0761) and trxB2 (lp_2585) are
annotated respectively as TR and nucleotide-disulphide
oxidoreductase. These six genes are dispersed throughout
the genome and are highly conserved within L. plantarum
strains regardless of their ecological niche [11].

Bioinformatics tools were used to investigate the evolutionary relationship of the TRX genes in L. plantarum
WCFS1. The translated gene sequences for trxA2 and trxB1
from L. plantarum WCFS1 showed the highest homology
(pscores higher than e-152) to characterized TRX and TR
respectively of different organisms such as L. lactis and B.
subtilis. In L. plantarum trxB1 and trxB2 have a 28% similarity at the protein level. The orthologous relation of
trxB1 from L. plantarum WCFS1 with trxB of B. subtilis and
the similarity in the alignment with other trxB genes
(including trxB of E. coli) suggests a molecular function of
trxB1 as TR. Interestingly, the sequence of trxB2 does not
possess an active center -CACV- which is an essential characteristic of the TR suggesting that this ORF does not have
the potential of reducing TRX. By phylogeny analysis it
was determined that the trxB2- encoding protein of L.
plantarum WFCS1 is orthologous to the B. subtilis protein
YUMC suggesting that these two sequences have the same
molecular function namely to act as a ferredoxin NAD(P)
reductase [12].
In vivo functionality of the TRX system
The in vivo functionality of the complete TRX system was
studied by quantitative PCR (q-PCR) of RNA isolated
from L. plantarum WCFS1 grown in CDM at 37°C under
anaerobic and oxidative stress conditions. The cultures
were exposed to different temperatures or redox environments created by the addition of diamide or DTT to the
medium. The relative expression expressed in arbitrary
units (Au) of the six different transcripts that compose the
TRX system is presented in Table 1. We observed that
trxA2 and trxB1 were relatively higher expressed under all
studied conditions when compared to the other trxA's and
trxB2 respectively. Moreover, transcript trxB2 and trxA2
were respectively higher expressed when the bacterium

Based on the gene expression data and the in silico
sequence analysis; we propose that trxB1 is coding for the
main TR in the TRX system in L. plantarum WCFS1. To
study the role of this enzyme in more detail, we constructed L. plantarum strains with elevated expression levels of trxB1.
Overproduction of TR
Overproduction of TR was achieved using the NICE
expression system [13]. The transformant (L. plantarum
NZ7601), carries the gene trxB1 under the control of the
nisin promoter. Strain NZ7601 displayed five-fold higher
TR activity after induction with 50 ng/ml nisinZ compared
to the wild type strain NZ7606 (data not shown). The
strain NZ7601 is able to reduce more than 1000 nmol
DTNB·(min·mg prot)-1 compared to 300 nmol
DTNB·(min·mg prot)-1 when no nisin is added to the
medium (Fig. 1). The TR activity of NZ7601 without the
addition of nisin corresponded to the TR activity of the
control strain NZ7606 with values, both under aerobic
and anaerobic growth conditions, of 300 and 320 nmol
DTNB·(min·mg prot)-1 respectively. An elevated expression of the trxB1 transcript was also detected in NZ7601
by northern blot analysis (data not shown).

Next, we evaluated the effect of overproduction of the
reductase in the oxidative stress response. For this we
monitored the growth of the trxB1-overexpressing strain
NZ7601 and wild-type NZ7606 in the presence of
diamide [5 mM], a known thiol oxidant [14] (Fig. 2). Both
tested strains grew with a maximum specific growth rate
(μmax) of 0.36 h-1 when no stress factor was present in the

transcripts evaluated at the same incubation temperature.
When comparing the effect of different growth conditions
within each probe, we observed -with the exception of
trxB2- that the highest expression of each studied transcript is observed under diamide exposure compared to
when grown with DTT or different temperatures (37°C
and 30°C). Our observations suggest a role for both trxA2
and trxB1 genes in the response mechanism of this bacterium towards oxidative stress while the gene, trxB2
together with trxA2 could play a role during a heat shock
or reductive stress.

medium. In the presence of diamide, both strains were
initially similarly affected by the oxidative stress showing
a μmax reduction to 0.17 h-1 and 0.15 h-1, respectively.
However, later on the growth pattern strain NZ7601 differed from that of the wild-type. While strain NZ7606
after reaching an OD600 of 0.5 stops growing and enters
stationary phase, strain NZ7601 continues to grow under
oxidative stress and reaches a cell density comparable to
that observed in the absence of oxidative stress.
This response under oxidative stress of strain NZ7601 was
investigated in a quantitative growth-zone inhibition
assay (Fig. 3). In this assay, we tested the inhibitory capacity of hydrogen peroxide and diamide on strains NZ7601
and NZ7606. We observed that strain NZ7601 at all studied oxidant concentrations showed a smaller inhibition
zone compared to NZ7606.
Transcriptome analysis
To analyze the correlation between TR overproduction
and oxidative stress we carried out transcriptome analyses
of the constructed strains. The mutant and the wild-type
strains were grown in chemostats at a dilution rate of 0.1
h-1, and samples for transcriptome analysis were drawn at
steady state both prior and 30 min after a hydrogen peroxide pulse. Because the NICE system is not suitable for continuous cultivations due to the instability of nisin in the
medium (data not shown), we used a constitutive promoter, PpepN, to drive expression of trxB1. Therefore, two
new strains were constructed: strain NZ7602 carrying

constitutive promoter from L. lactis [15], PpepN, and strain
NZ7607 as a control strain carrying the empty plasmid
pNZ7021. The continuous cultivations were performed in
biological triplicates (Table 2). In the chemostat cultivations glucose present in the medium (100 mM) was consumed to undetectable levels (<0.5 mM) and the biomass
produced was comparable in both strains. In addition, we
found no growth difference between both strains under
this cultivation condition.
The overexpression of trxB1 present in strain NZ7602 was
in itself a good internal control in the transcriptome analysis. The transcript of this gene was found to be 23-fold
more abundant in the trxB1 over-expressing strain compared to the control strain. This increase in transcript level
resulted in a doubling of TR activity in strain NZ7602
compared to the wild-type (data not shown). The ANOVA
statistical test that summarizes the significant effects due
to overexpression of trxB1 showed that there were in total
27 significantly affected transcripts (pvalue < 0.01 and FC
≥1.5) in the trxB1 over-expressing strain when compared
to the wild type (Table 3). We observed that 15% of them
are predicted to be involved in the purine and pyrimidine
biosynthesis. Other affected transcripts are predicted to be
involved in stress-related processes (groEL, npr2), transport and binding proteins (mntH2), protein synthesis
(tuf), protein fate (lp_1023), and genes involved in the
cellular envelope (ica3). It is to be noted that none of the
mentioned stress-related genes has a -CXXC- cysteine-rich
active center. We also observed a significant up-regulation

involved in the energy metabolism of the cell. In L.
plantarum WCFS1, gapB, is the only gene annotated as a
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The in vitro
activity of GAPDH in strain NZ7602 was analyzed and
found to be approximately three-fold higher in comparison with the wild-type (Table 2). Furthermore, a gene
related to cysteine amino acid metabolism was also upregulated in strain NZ7602 specifically the gene coding for
serine O-acetyltransferase (cysE).

(accb2, accC2, accD2, and accA2); nonribosomal peptide

ccpA), and 33 prophage genes.

The transcriptome analysis of cells exposed to a hydrogen
peroxide pulse allowed us to analyze the effect of hydrogen peroxide on both the trxB1-overexpressing and wildtype strains. Oxidative stress significantly affected a total
of 267 transcripts with a pvalue < 0.01 and FC ≥1.5 (Additional file 1). We observed that most of the up-regulated
transcripts (159) are associated with genes related to
defense mechanisms against oxidative challenge: hydrogen peroxide detoxification (npr2, kat, trxA2, pox3, pox5),
exonucleases (rexA, rexB); stress response (asp1, asp2,
groES, groEL); DNA repair (dinP, dnaE, recA); putative
DNA helicases (lp_0910, lp_0308, lp_0432) and
polymerases (umuC); transcription regulator repressor of
the SOS regulon (lexA), ferrous iron transport (feoA, feoB),
as well as an uncharacterized transcription regulator
(lp_1360), a manganese transporter (mntH2), and the
energy metabolism (gapB).

Regulatory networks
In the group of significantly affected genes due to oxidative stress (Additional file 1) the largest group (22%) corresponded to hypothetical proteins. In order to find a
functional correlation in the entire group of peroxideaffected transcripts, we looked for regulatory motifs or
binding sites in the upstream region of the affected genes.
As a result of this analysis, we found two motifs (Additional file 1) in the upstream region of a number of analyzed sequences. The first motif was found in 15 of the
affected genes and had the consensus sequence of the
lexA-DinR regulator in B. subtilis AGAACGTACGTTCG
(Fig. 4) [16]. Within the group that contained this promotor sequence, we found well known stress-induced genes
(ruvA, ruvB, lexA, rexA, rexB) [17]. These genes translate
into proteins known from literature to be induced under
conditions that cause DNA damage or blockage of DNA
replication. Also transcripts with hypothetical functions
(lp_0091, lp_0270, lp_0030, lp_2224 lp_2939 lp_3141,
lp_0981, lp_3022 and lp_1611) contained the lexA-DinR
consensus sequence. It is worth mentioning that these
hypothetical transcripts are highly induced under hydrogen peroxide stress. For example, transcript lp_1611 was
induced 32-fold as compared to the wild-type.

Our data showed that hydrogen peroxide stress also
resulted in significant down-regulation of the expression
of 108 transcripts (Additional file 1). The down-regulated
transcripts correspond to genes involved in glucose catabolic pathways: cellular surface proteins; the mannose
PTS; energy metabolism (ndr, nar genes, adhE, fruk); fatty

The same approach was applied to the data set containing
the genes affected due to trxB1-overexpression. Yet, no significant regulatory motif was found. It can be concluded
that genes belonging to the group of hypothetical transcripts (19%) responding to trxB1-overexpression do not
share a clear single regulatory motif.
Comparison between oxidative stress response and the
effect of trxB1 overproduction
Finally, we explored the crossover between the transcriptional response of TR over production with the transcriptional response obtained following hydrogen peroxide
treatment of both wild-type and NZ7602. This exercise
resulted in a list of 16 transcripts which are affected in
both studied conditions (Table 4). The commonly
affected transcripts constitute 59% of the transcripts
found affected by a trxB1-overexpression (Table 3) and
6% of the genes affected by hydrogen peroxide stress
(Additional file 1). From the 16 affected transcripts 94%

of them (15) responded similarly to an over production of
trxB1 as well as to a hydrogen peroxide pulse; these 15
transcripts were up regulated in both datasets. The up-regulated transcripts (15) have already been described and
correspond to genes involved in stress related processes
(npr2), energy metabolism (gapB), protein synthesis (tuf,
rplB), manganese uptake (mntH2), purine biosynthesis
(trxB1, and pur genes), putative transcript regulators
(lp_1360, lp_0126) and unknown transcripts.

response towards the overproduction of the oxidoreductase TR and hydrogen peroxide stress. Our observations
suggest that overproduction of TR triggers the induction of
a specific set of 16 transcripts associated with oxidative
stress response. This may explain the phenotype of the
trxB1-overexpression strain, which appears to be prepared
for encountering oxidative stress. The transcripts correspond to genes involved in purine metabolism, protein
synthesis, as well as in cellular and energy metabolism.

The only transcript found in both datasets that does not
share the same regulation is groEL. This transcript is 0.6fold down regulated as a result of the overexpresssion of
trxB1 and 1.7-fold upregulated and in response to a
hydrogen peroxide pulse.

The global transcriptome analysis obtained from cultures
affected by hydrogen peroxide stress and in the absence of
heme, offers complementary information for the characterization of the kat, and pox genes in L. plantarum WCFS1.
The catalase gene (kat) of L. plantarum WCFS1 is an
ortholog of the well characterized manganese-dependent
catalase in L. plantarum CNRZ 1288 [18]. Accordingly, in
our dataset the kat transcript and mntH2, which codes for
a manganese transporter, where both is significantly
upregulated three- and two-fold respectively under hydrogen peroxide.

In order to analyze the effect at the metabolic level, the
datasets were superimposed showing they shared two
major metabolic pathways: purine metabolism and
cysteine biosynthesis.

Discussion
In this study, we have characterized the role of TR in oxidative stress response of Lactobacillus plantarum. We found
that overproduction of TR in L. plantarum WCFS1
improved the tolerance of the strain towards an oxidative
stress produced by hydrogen peroxide or diamide. Global
transcriptome analysis revealed a striking similarity in

Hence, our transcriptome analysis only supports the fact
that the gene catalase (kat) of L. plantarum WCFS1 may
code a pseudocatalase, non-heme dependent catalase,
under conditions of hydrogen peroxide stress. Furthermore, under hydrogen peroxide stress the highly upregulated pox transcripts (pox3 and pox5) encoding pyruvate

oxidase were at first an intriguing observation. Pyruvate
oxidase catalyzes a reaction that utilizes pyruvate, oxygen,
phosphate, and water and produces intracellular hydrogen peroxide, carbon dioxide, and acetyl phosphate. Yet,
in this study there was no oxygen added because the cultures were grown anaerobically. However, transcripts
encoding the genes, catalase (kat) and NADPH peroxidase
(npr2) were also found up regulated. If these two latter
enzymes were to be active, they would liberate oxygen and
water respectively from hydrogen peroxide and therefore
explaining the observed behavior of pox3 and pox5 under
hydrogen peroxide stress.
Hydrogen peroxide not only provokes up-regulation of
genes at the transcriptome level. We also observed downregulation of genes involved in main metabolic pathways:
glycolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis, non ribosomal peptide
biosynthesis, and amino acid metabolism. This observation suggests that in the presence of hydrogen peroxide
stress, the cell responds to it with a reduction in biomass
formation. The transcript data suggest that the pathways
mentioned above are being kept temporarily "on hold"
until the cell has detoxified form the oxidative stress
inducing compounds. This reasoning was supported by
metabolite analysis data showing interrupted lactate production after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (data not
shown).
This study is the first to observe the impact of overproduction of TR at the transcriptome level in L. plantarum. The
overexpression of trxB1 affects the expression level of
genes involved in stress related processes, DNA/RNA biosynthesis, and sulfur containing amino acid biosynthesis.
The resulting wide spectrum of pathways affected by TR
has already been established. Research performed by Vido
et al. on aerobic growth of Lactococcus lactis (2005)
revealed that in L. lactis, TR is involved not only in oxidative stress but also in carbon and lipid metabolism [19].
Overproduction of TR in L. plantarum WCFS1 resulted in
regulation of transcripts encoding heat shock and stress
related genes. Especially the stress related gene which was
found to be down regulated in strain NZ7602 (groEL) is
previously reported to be induced in B. subtilis [20] under
stress conditions (heat, salt, and ethanol) together with
TRX. In addition, on transcript level trxA1, trxA2, trxA3,
and trxH were not found significantly affected. This suggests that the protein TRX is not affected at the transcript
level in strain NZ7602. Hence, the transcripts regarded as
significantly affected in strain NZ7602 are more likely to
be a response to the direct manipulation of the TR level
and/or the protein load resulting from TR overproduction
and not to the change in the TRX balance of the cell.

We have shown that transcript levels of gapB and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity
are significantly increased 1.7-fold and 3-fold, respectively, upon overexpression of trxB1 and hydrogen peroxide stress. GAPDH plays an important role and has been
considered the key enzyme of glycolysis for its location in
the pathway and the number of regulatory interactions
associated with this enzyme. A correlation between the
GAPDH and TR has already been reported in literature.
Vido et al., 2005 [21] suggested that a disruption on the
trxB1 gene in L. lactis leads to induction of only one of the
two genes that code for the GAPDH protein, specifically
gapB. Furthermore, the induced GapB was only present in
the reduced form. This functionality prevents the formation of oxidized GapB and sustains formation of the
reduced or active form of GAPDH. Interestingly, in our
case the observed two-fold higher GAPDH activity is a
result of overexpression of trxB1 in contrast to a disruption in trxB1 as reported by Vido et al [19] in L. lactis.
Although overexpression of gapB in the strain NZ7602
results in higher reductase activity, the elevated transcript
levels under oxidative stress were even more interesting.
Studies from Van Niel et al., [22] show that the GAPDH
protein is an easy target for oxidative stress (cysteine residues) and together with glucokinase, fructose 1–6 biphosphate, and aldolase has been found to be inhibited by 2.2
mM hydrogen peroxide in L. lactis [22]. Nevertheless, in
our studies, we observed elevated GAPDH activity upon
exposure to 3.5 mM hydrogen peroxide. Hence, we can
suggest that the functionality of GAPDH is organism
dependent. We suggest that overproduction of TR in L.
plantarum WCFS1 protects the GAPDH under conditions
of oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide. However,
more studies are needed to understand the role of TR in
the regulation of the GAPDH activity.
Using bioinformatics tools we were able to uncover new
main stress response ORF's in L. plantarum WCFS1. For
example the hypothetical ORF lp_1611 which contains
the regulatory motif lexA-dinR. The ORF lp_1611 was
found to be up regulated 32-fold under hydrogen peroxide stress. This ORF is located adjacent to the glycine ABC
transporter operon just in the opposite direction of the
opu genes. The position and direction of lp_1611 may suggest a role as a regulator of transcription; nevertheless,
more analysis such as finding the DNA binding region
and activity in the protein need to be conducted.
Another group of oxidative-stress-affected genes contains
a second regulatory motif that we have termed SRE. In this
group we found three genes that had already been defined
as lexA-dinR regulated genes (rexA, rexB, recA). Moreover,
in the group of genes containing the second motif, we
found genes involved in primary energy metabolism
(gapB) and protein synthesis (rnhb) implying that there is

at least one more regulatory mechanism induced in L.
plantarum WCFS1 upon oxidative stress. We did not find a
unique regulatory motif or SRE motif element in the
group of genes affected by overproduction of TR. This
reflects the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms associated with TRX or TR. Perhaps, these up-regulated genes
are governed by a complex network of signal transduction
events which is initiated by the TRX system. Hence, we
suggest the set of 16 genes is part of the TR-specific defense
mechanism of L. plantarum WCFS1 against oxidative
stress.
In summary, we have presented evidence that TR is a factor in the oxidative stress response in L. plantarum WCFS1.
Our transcriptome data suggest that the TRX system (trxA2
and trxB1) is induced under hydrogen peroxide stress in L.
plantarum WCFS1. Moreover, the discovery of a crossovergroup of genes with a common response under hydrogen
peroxide stress, especially DNA-repairing and stress transcripts, including the pur genes, npr2, and gapB, leads to
the hypothesis that overproduction of TR results in a
"mock-stress-mode." As a result under TR overproduction,
16 transcripts encoding genes involved in purine biosynthesis, cell wall biosynthesis, energy metabolism, cellular
envelope biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism are activated. The activation of these genes provides an explanation of why strain L. plantarum NZ7602 is better adapted
to a challenge with hydrogen peroxide stress in comparison to the wild-type. The observed crossover between TR
overproduction and hydrogen peroxide stress contributes
essential information to understand the oxidative stress
related signal transduction cascade in L. plantarum. Nevertheless, this study clearly needs to be followed up with
experiments showing the effect, on the group of 16 transcripts resulting from an inactivation of trxB1 in L.
plantarum. New leads concerning catalase (kat) and the
GAPDH protein emerged from our transcriptome dataset.
These leads will be further studied. Using regulatory motif
searches we identified a known stress regulatory element:
lexA-dinR and also a new motif: AACTAGCCGCGGTGGC
(Fig. 4). Finally, transcription profiling also revealed new
actors such as the uncharacterized ORF lp_1611 which
seems to play a role in the oxidative stress response in L.
plantarum WCFS1. Current investigations aim at pinpointing the role of TR in the oxidative stress response.

DNA Manipulations
All molecular biology techniques were performed following established protocols by Sambrook [23]. DNA was
digested according to the conditions recommended by the
commercial suppliers of the restriction enzymes (Boehringer, Breda, The Netherlands). In all cases, DNA was
eluted from 0.7% agarose gels using the Purification Kits
from Promega (Leiden, The Netherlands). For a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) we used: 1 μl template DNA (10
to 100 ng), 2 μl of each primer combination (50 ng/ml),
1 μl dNTP's (100 nM), 1 μl Pwo-polymerase (5 U/μl) and
10 μl polymerase buffer (5×) (Roche, Woerden, The Netherlands). The reaction mixtures were adjusted to 50 μl
with deionized H2O.
Construction of strain L. plantarum NZ7100
Previously it has been established that the nisin controlled
expression system can be functionally implemented in L.
plantarum, by chromosomal integration of the regulatory
module encoding genes nisRK [25]. However, the strain
described by Pavan et al. harbors an erythromycin resistance marker. Therefore, a chromosomal lp_0076:::nisRK
gene replacement without resistance marker was constructed. For this purpose, lp_0076 upstream and downstream flanking regions were amplified by proofreading
PCR using genomic DNA of L. plantarum WCFS1 as template. The primers used to amplify the 5'- and 3'-regions
of lp_0075 and lp_0077 respectively were lp_0075-FORW
and lp_0075-REV; lp_0077-FORW and lp_0077-REV,
shown in Table 6. The PCR amplicons obtained were
digested with EcorI-BamhI, and BamhI-XbaI (sites introduced in the primers used are underlined in Table 6) and
cloned into a EcoRI-XbaI digested pUC18Em [26]. The
genetic organization of the resulting plasmid was verified
by PCR and was designated pNZ7130. To introduce additional endonuclease restriction sites in pNZ7130 the multiple cloning sites containing fragment was amplified by
PCR using the primers EM1 and EM2 (Table 6). The
resulting amplicon (35 bp) was digested with BamhI and
BglII and cloned in BamhI digested pNZ7130, yielding
pNZ7131. The 2.6 kb HindII fragment of pNZ7131 that
contains the lp_0076 flanking regions separated by the
multiple cloning site and the erythromycin resistance
encoding gene, was subcloned in vector pNZ84, yielding
the lp_0076 replacement vector pNZ7132. The
lp_0076::nisRK replacement plasmid pNZ7133 was constructed by cloning of the 2.4 kb HpaII-PstI fragment of
pNZ9521 [27] into the NsaI-NsiI digested pNZ7132. The
plasmid pNZ7133 was introduced into L. plantarum
WCFS1 and primary integrants were selected on basis of
erythromycin resistance. The anticipated configuration of
the pNZ7133 plasmid integration in the lp_0076 locus
was confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting (data not
shown). One of the integrants was cultured for 140 generations without antibiotic selection. Subsequently, eryth-

trol. Strain NZ7607 is L. plantarum WCFS1 containing the
pNZ7021 vector.
Nisin Induction
Nisin induction was done as previously described by
Pavan et al [25] using 50 ng/ml nisin for induction.
Quantitative PCR assays
Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing L.
plantarum WCFS1 cultures with the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche, Woerden, The Netherlands). To eliminate
genomic DNA contamination a 60 min DNAse I treatment was included in the isolation procedure. Furthermore, the quality and quantity of the RNA was confirmed
using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay (Agilent Technologies,
Amstelveen, The Netherlands) using the Agilent 2100
expert Bioanalyzer. Cultures of the bacterium were grown
in anaerobic jars on CDM containing 5 mM Diamide at
37°C, or CDM containing 5 mM DTT at 37°C and 30°C.
In all cases 0.5% (w/v) glucose was added as carbon
source. For the reverse transcription reaction 200 ng RNA
was incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes with 270 ng random
nonamers, and 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP mixture. After 5 minutes on ice, the following was added: 5 μl 5 × First strand
Buffer, 2 μl 0.1 M DTT, 1 μl Superscript III (200 UNITS),
1 μl RNASEout (40 UNITS) (all Invitrogen) and water to
a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was incubated at
25°C for 5 min and then at 50°C for 60 min. The reaction
was inactivated by heating at 70°C for 15 min. Generated
cDNA samples were stored at -20°C until use. Quantita-

tive PCR amplification was performed in 96-well plate on
a 7500 Fast System (Applied Biosystems), using SYBR
green for product detection. Each well contained 10 μl
SYBR green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 200 nM of
Reverse and forward primers, and 1 μl of 10-fold or 100fold diluted RT product as template. The qPCR gene-specific probes of L. plantarum WCFS1 of trxA1 (0.3 kb), trxA2
(0.3 kb), trxA3 (0.3 kb), trxH (0.3 kb), trxB1 (0.3 kb), and
trxB2 (0.6 kb) were amplified using specific primer combinations trxA1-FORW and trxA1-REV; trxA2-FORW and
trxA2-REV; trxA3-FORW and trxA3-REV; trxH-FORW and
trxH-REV; trxB1-FORW and trxB1-300; trxB2-truncFORW
and trxB2-truncREV. All primers are specified in Table 6.
Amplification was initiated at 95°C for 10 min, followed
by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 53°C for 30 sec and 60°C
for 60 sec for probes trxA1, trxA3 and trxH. For the other
probes (trxA2, trxB1, and trxB2) the step of 53°C for 30 sec
was changed to 55°C for 30 sec. All samples were measured in duplicate. Control PCRs were included to detect
background contamination (no-template control) and
remaining chromosomal DNA (RT reactions in which
enzyme superscript III was not added). PCR specificity
and product detection were checked post amplification by
examining the dissociation curves of the PCR products.
These melting curve profiles were generated by first heating the samples to 95°C and then cooling them to 60°C
and slowly heating then at 2°C/min to 95°C for detection
of SYBR green fluorescence. In each run, five standards of
the gene of interest were included with appropriate dilutions of the cDNA, to determine the cDNA concentration

in the samples. All q-PCRs amplified a single product as
determined by the melting curve analysis and the releative
expression level is given as arbitrary units (Au).
Growth curves. For the growth experiments, 96-well plates
were used. Each well was filled with 200 μl medium and
10 μl growing cells (OD600 of 1.0). The 96-well plates were
inoculated at 37°C and cell density was measured by
detecting the turbidity of the cultures at 600 nm every 10
min. To study oxidative stress response, either diamide (5
mM) or hydrogen peroxide (3.5 mM) was added to the
medium.
Growth-zone inhibition assays
Cultures were grown at 37°C in MRS until OD600 of 0.4.
At this point, 2.5 ml of culture was plated by mixing with
50 ml of 0.7% Agarose MRS at 40°C. After the agar/culture plates hardened, perforations of 6 mm diameter were
made. In each of these apertures, 30 μl of solution (1 M,
0.5 M, 0.25 M and 0.10 M) of diamide or (1 M, 0.5 M)
hydrogen peroxide was added. Plates were incubated
overnight at 37°C. The growth inhibition towards the oxidative stress agents was measured as the radius of growth
inhibition expressed in centimeters.
Preparation of cell free extracts (CFE)
Cells of a growing culture OD600 of 1.0 (approx. 10 ml)
were harvested by centrifugation at 12.000 × g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The pellet was washed twice with 1 M TrisHCl buffer pH = 7.5. Next, the cells were suspended in 1
ml of 1 M Tris-HCl buffer pH = 7.5 and disrupted by Fastprep (Qbiogene Inc., Illkirch, France) in four treatments
of 40 seconds at speed 4.0. The suspension was centrifuged 2 min at maximum speed and the supernatant or
CFE was transferred to a new vial and used directly. Protein content of the CFE was determined through the
standard BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Etten-Leur, The
Netherlands).
Thioredoxin reductase enzyme assays
The reaction mixture (RM) was prepared by mixing (in
ice) 200 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH = 7.5, 500 μl of insulin (10
μg/μl), 2.5 μl EDTA pH = 7.5 (0.2M), and 40 μl NADPH
(40 mg/ml). For each enzymatic reaction 40 μl RM were
used together with 20 μl TRX (60 μM) from E. coli
(Sigma), and 80 μl CFE. Each reaction was incubated for
25 minutes at 37°C; after this 500 μl of 6M Guanidine
HCl/0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH = 7.5/1 mM DTNB was added.
The final absorbance at 412 nm was measured at 25°C.
Note that the extinction coefficient of DTNB reduction is
13.6 mM-1 and that there are two molecules of TNB per
molecule DTNB being reduded. The background signal in
the assay was determined in the absence of TRX in one of
the assays. TR activity was expressed as nmol of

DTNB·(min·mg protein)-1 and calculated as follows:
Δabs412·(0.620)·(protein content)-1·2·(εDTNB)-1·10^6.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme
assay
The assay mixture contained: triethanolamine-HCl buffer
(pH 7.6), 100 mM; ATP, 1 mM; EDTA, 1 mM; MgSO4, 1.5
mM; NADH, 0.15 mM; phosphoglycerate kinase 22.5 U
(Boehringer, Breda, The Netherlands); and CFE. The reaction was started with 5 mM 3-phosphoglycerate. The
absorption of the assay mixture was monitor at 340 nm
(E340 nm of reduced pyridine-dinucleotide cofactors is 6.3
mM-1). Enzyme activity is expressed as μM of amount of
NADH converted per (min·mg protein)-1. All assays were
performed with two concentrations of cell extract to confirm that reaction rates were proportional to the amount
of cell extract added. Protein content of the CFE was determined through the standard BCA Protein Assay kit.
Continuous cultivations
Cultures were grown at 37°C in CDM [24] which was supplemented with 100 mM glucose and 10 μg/ml of chloramphenicol. A 1 Liter bioreactor (Applikon Dependable
Instruments) was inoculated with cells from an overnight
culture to an initial OD600 of 0.1 in 500 ml medium. A pH
of 5.5 was maintained by the addition of 5 M NaOH and
the stirrer speed was set at 200 rotations per minute
(rpm). The headspace of the fermentors and medium vessel were full at all times with nitrogen gas at a flow rate of
520 ml·min-1. The cultures were kept at the dilution rate
of 0.1 h-1 and steady state was assumed after 5 volume
changes. At steady state or (t0), samples were taken for
transcriptomics, HPLC analysis, dry weight, and enzyme
samples. In addition, at steady state, 50 ml of hydrogen
peroxide was added to the fermentors resulting in a final
concentration of 3.5 mM in the fermentor. After 30 min
(t30), samples were taken for transcriptomics, HPCL analysis, and enzymatic analysis.
Microarrays
RNA isolation
A 40 ml L. plantarum WCFS1 culture at steady state was
added to 160 ml of quenching buffer [30] (60% methanol, 66.7 mM HEPES; pH 6.5; 40°C). Following quenching, the cells were immediately pelleted by centrifugation
at 18.000 × g for 10 min at 20°C. The pellet was resuspended in a screw cap tube containing in 0.4 ml TE, 250
μl acidic phenol, 250 μl chloroform, 30 μl 3 M sodium
acetate pH 5.2, 30 μl 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate, and
1 gram glass beads. The tube was immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and samples were stored at -80°C. The
cells were disrupted with three subsequent 40 second
treatments separated by 1 min on ice in a Fastprep (Qbiogene Inc., Illkirch, France). After disruption, 0.5 ml of the
aqueous phase was used for RNA isolation with a High

Pure kit, which included 1 h of treatment with DNase I
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim; Germany). The isolated
RNA was eluted in 50 μl of elution supplied in the kit.
cDNA synthesis and purification
Before first-strand cDNA synthesis, the absence of
genomic DNA and RNA degradation in the RNA samples
was confirmed using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay (Agilent
Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands) using the
Agilent 2100 expert Bioanalyzer. First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out by the CyScribe Post-Labelling and
Purification kit (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions with
two modifications. The starting amount of mRNA used
per sample was 25 μg and the synthesis reactions were
incubated for 3 h at 42°C.
Data acquisition and processing
Two independent chemostat cultivations were performed
for both wild type and trxB1 over-expression strain. Three
hybridization experiments, all with the same hybridization scheme (see below), were performed with samples
obtained from these chemostats before and after treatment with hydrogen peroxide. Two of these experiments
used samples obtained from the same fermentation. In
each experiment three arrays were used. Per array two
cDNA labeled targets were hybridized on custom
designed L. plantarum WCFS1 11 K Agilent oligo microarrays (GEO Acc. Nr. GPL4318) using the Agilent 60-mer
oligo microarray processing protocol version 4.1. These
microarrays contained an average of three probes per
gene. The hybridization scheme contained the following
cDNA comparisons (1) wildtype with trxB1 over-expression mutant; (2) wildtype with wildtype treated with
hydrogen peroxide; and (3) wildtype treated with hydrogen peroxide with trxB1 over-expression mutant treated
with hydrogen peroxide. Dried slides were scanned in the
Scan Array Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; Packard
Bioscience) at 10 microns. Spot intensity data was quantified (average intensity) in ImaGene version 5.0 (BioDiscovery, Inc., El Segundo, CA). Signal intensities of all
probes were corrected against background and normalized by fitting a plot of M (= 2log [cy5 intensity/cy3 intensity]) against A (= 0.5·2log [cy5 intensity·cy3 intensity])
using the lowess algorithm in BASE [31]. The normalized
data has been made available with GEO Acc. Nr.
GSE8348. The fold change (FC) is defined as 2M. For the
statistical analysis we used microarray analysis of variation (R/maanova) [32]. In this maanova test we used three
variables: fermentation, treatment, and genotype. Moreover we tested the model taking into consideration the
interaction between genotype and treatment. The
maanova test resulted only in two sets of interesting data
because the interaction effect did not reveal significant
changes in transcript levels. One dataset representing the

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/6/1/29

transcripts affected as a result of the overproduction of TR
and another set representing the transcripts affected due
to oxidative stress. These two datasets were denominated
genotype and hydrogen peroxide datasets respectively.
Significantly regulated genes within each dataset were
defined as genes whose nominal pvalues were less than 1%
and had a fold change equal or higher than 1.5.
Regulatory Motifs
Determination of regulatory motifs from a list of genes
was based on predictions of upstream transcriptional
units (TU's) made using an in-house Python program,
alignments of these TU's using the MEME [33] and determining of nucleotide sequences using the MAST software
[34] tools. The MEME software determines through alignments small motifs which are present in the analyzed
sequences and assigns a significant value, Evalue, and score
per position. This significant value represents how well
preserved the motif is, the number of TU's that this motif
has, and the conserved position of the motif in the analyzed TU's. The MAST software allows searching for the
motif in the genome of interest.
