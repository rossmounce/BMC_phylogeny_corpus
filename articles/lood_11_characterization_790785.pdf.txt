Characterization and genome sequencing of two
Propionibacterium acnes phages displaying
pseudolysogeny
Rolf Lood* and Mattias Collin

Abstract
Background: Propionibacterium acnes is a Gram positive rod inhabiting the human skin that also infects
orthopaedic implants and is associated with acne vulgaris. Previously, one lytic bacteriophage, PA6, from P. acnes
has been sequenced and partially characterized. We recently isolated several inducible phages from P. acnes
classified as Siphoviruses based on morphology and partial genome sequencing.
Results: In this study we sequenced the inducible P. acnes phages PAD20 and PAS50, isolated from deep infection
and from skin, respectively. The genomes of PAD20 and PAS50 are 29,074 and 29,017 bp, respectively, compared
with the 29,739 bp of PA6. The phage genomes have 87.3-88.7% nucleotide sequence identity. The genes are
divided into clusters with different levels of similarity between the phages. PAD20 and PAS50 share four genes
encoding identical amino acid sequences. Some deletions and insertions in the genomes have occurred, resulting
in lack of genes, frame shifts, and possible regulatory differences. No obvious virulence factor gene candidates
were found. The phages are inducible, but bacteria can be cured of phages by serial colony isolations and lose
their phages during stationary phase, but are still sensitive to new phage infections. Construction of a phylogenetic
tree based on more than 459 phage genomes, suggested that P. acnes phages represent a new lineage of
Siphoviruses.
Conclusions: The investigated P. acnes Siphovirus genomes share a high degree of homology to other P. acnes
phages sequenced, but not to genomes of other phages isolated from Propionibacteria. The phage genomes are
not integrated in the bacterial genome, but instead, most likely have a pseudolysogenic life cycle.

Background
Propionibacterium acnes is a Gram positive rod normally found on human skin [1], but has also been isolated from infections of orthopaedic implants [2,3], and
has been suggested to be involved in the development
of acne vulgaris. Recently, the first genome of a P. acnes
strain was sequenced [4] and several putative virulence
factors were identified [5]. The sequenced P. acnes genome only contains one cryptic prophage, but it has earlier been shown that some P. acnes strains are carriers
of inducible phages [6]. Other groups have also studied
Propionibacterium phages both in order to establish a
tool to differentiate between serotypes, but also to

further characterize phages mainly infecting bacteria
important for the dairy industry [7-16].
Recently, Farrar et al, sequenced the first genome of a
P. acnes phage, PA6 (GenBank accession no.
DQ431235) [17]. The genome consists of 29,739 bp
dsDNA with 48 putative coding genes. The phage was
determined to be a lytic phage since no integrase or
repressor could be detected in the genome. Eighteen of
the genes were assigned predicted functions based on
their similarities to other known phage genes. Recently,
we isolated and characterized inducible phages from
P. acnes isolated from both deep infections and from
skin of healthy individuals [6]. By comparing the genomes of these different phages, a better understanding
of how the phage influences its host and an insight in
the great genetic diversity seen among phages, as shown

by other comparative studies on phage genomes can be
achieved [18,19].
Phages can enter two principally different life cycles, e.
g. a lytic life cycle or a lysogenic cycle. In the lysogenic
cycle most phages integrate their genome into the host
genome. This is most often regulated by a phage-borne
integrase, but there is also a recent report of a filamentous phage, CTXj from Vibrio cholerae, that uses the
host recombinases XerC and XerD to integrate into the
host genome [20,21]. Furthermore, there are a few
phages known to form stable linear or circular plasmids
as a part of their integration mechanism [22-24], but
most known temperate phages encode their own
integrases.
Other than those two well-defined phage life cycles,
phages are also known to be able to interact with their
host in other life cycles, termed as persistent infections,
pseudolysogeny, carrier-state, and chronic infections
[25,26]. Those phage life cycles, even though common,
are less defined compared to the lytic and lysogenic life
cycles. Common for all states, except the chronic infection, is that the bacteria carry the phage DNA, but the
DNA is not integrated into the bacterial chromosome,
but rather exists as a plasmid. The chronic infection is
characterized by the release of phages from the bacteria
without causing lysis [25].
In this study, we have sequenced the genome of one
phage induced from a P. acnes strain isolated from deep
infection (PAD20), and the genome of one phage
induced from a P. acnes strain isolated from skin
(PAS50), and we have compared the two genomes with
the reported lytic phage PA6 [17]. The phages have earlier been shown to have dissimilarities in the genes
encoding a putative major head protein and an amidase
[6], but no other genes have been examined. This offers
an opportunity to investigate if phages isolated from P.
acnes contribute to the virulence seen in different

strains of P. acnes, and to examine the genetic diversity
seen among phages.

Results and discussion
Genomic organization and homology

The genomic organization of the three examined phages
are very similar, even though some genes differ (see Figure 1). Both phages have a 13 bp ssDNA extension at
both ends of the genome, identical to that of phage
PA6. These extensions enable the formation of potential
concatamers and circularization of the phage genome.
The genome of PAD20 is 29,074 bp and has a GC content of 54.1%, compared to the genome of PAS50 that is
29,017 bp and has a GC content of 53.9%. PAD20 has
two larger deletions in the genome compared to PA6.
The first is a 226 bp deletion resulting in the deletion of
the main part of gp22 and thereby in a frame shift giving rise to a combination of the gene products Gp22
and Gp23 (Gp22.23, see additional file 1). The second
larger deletion is a 378 bp deletion of the entire gp42
gene. PAS50 has two larger deletions and one insertion.
The first deletion in PAS50 is a 207 bp deletion resulting in the deletion of the gp45 gene, and a second deletion of almost 500 bp in a non-coding region,
corresponding to bp 27,932-28,419 in PA6. The insert
in PAS50 is an 84 bp insertion in gp37 resulting in a 28
amino acid larger exonuclease.
To further investigate the genomic organization of the
different P. acnes phages, the genomes were screened for
putative sigma70-dependent promoters and transcriptional
terminators (see Figure 1 and Table 1). Several putative
promoters were detected in all phages upstream of gp7,
gp11 and gp46, as well as upstream of gp45 and gp30,
potentially enabling the phage to transcribe different parts
of the genome at different stages of infection. One of the
promoters with the highest score was upstream of a
hitherto unannotated ORF (3693-3301, gp50). However,

The gp number represents the ORF directly after the regulatory element. Bold letters indicate the putative -10 and -35 site of the promoters, and the
palindromes in the terminators. The score is given as -10/-35 for the promoters based on BPROM as described in Methods, and as minimal free energy (MFE) in
kcal/mol for the terminators.

the predicted gene product does not show any similarity to
known sequences or domains.
Except for the six identified promoters in each genome, one putative transcriptional terminator was also
identified (see Figure 1). The putative terminators are
placed immediately downstream of the amidase and the
holin in the lysis gene cassette.
Even though most of the genes are very similar in the
examined phages, a certain pattern of similarity between
gene clusters can be observed. Packaging genes and
putative head genes have a higher similarity between
PAD20 and PAS50 than between the other examined P.
acnes phage groups. Other than the clusters mentioned
above, gp27-gp48 also shows the highest similarity
between PAD20 and PAS50, except for gp42 and gp43.
This exception is mainly due to the deletion of gp42 in
PAD20. Furthermore, most tail genes and genes
involved in the lysis of the host have the highest similarity between PA6 and PAS50. The overall genome
nucleotide similarity is very high between all phages
examined (PA6/PAS50 - 88.7%, PAD20/PAS50 - 87.8%,
and PA6/PAD20 - 87.3%).

By searching for homologues corresponding to PAD20
and PAS50 proteins using BLASTp [27], most hits were
in the Actinobacteria phylum, with Streptomyces, Mycobacterium and phages infecting Mycobacterium, Propionibacterium, Nocardia, and Bifidobacterium (see Table
2). This is not surprising since these species are closely
related and thereby also might have similarities among
their phages. Most hits were on bacterial proteins, most
likely indicating that these bacterial strains have prophages that have not yet been examined. More interestingly, several phage proteins showed similarity to phages
isolated from low G+C bacteria as Streptococcus and Lactococcus (see Table 2). These species are not very closely
related to P. acnes, but the results might indicate that
their phages have had several possibilities to exchange
genes. Surprisingly, there were no hits on any other Propionibacterium phages or prophages. If this merely
reflects the lack of sequenced phages from Propionibacteria and bacterial genomes in the Propionibacterium
genus, or indicate that phages isolated from P. acnes are
distinct from those infecting other Propionibacteria is
unknown. Furthermore, the putative cryptic prophage in

Phage PAD20 and PAS50 protein sequences were screened for similar proteins using BLAST. All proteins showed the highest similarity to P. acnes phage PA6.
Those hits were not further analyzed since they only indicate that the phages are most related to each other.

P. acnes strain KPA171202 [5] does not show any similarity to PAD20, PAS50 or PA6. However, most recently,
Machuca et al [28] isolated a phage infecting Fusobacterium nucleatum. This phage was partially sequenced (390
bp), and showed 90% sequence identity to parts of gp3
(portal protein) and gp4 in PA6. However, the whole
phage genome of the Fusobacterium phage needs to be

sequenced to conclude how related this phage is to Propionibacterium phages.
Genes encoding packaging proteins and structural
proteins

The packaging and structural proteins (Gp1-Gp19) are
generally very well conserved, with high sequence

Lood and Collin BMC Genomics 2011, 12:198
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/198

similarities between all three phages, ranging from 89.7%
to 99.3% amino acid identity (see Figure 1 and additional file 2) with one exception - gp19. Gp19 has 67.1%
to 77.4% amino acid identity and is predicted to function as a tail protein, with high similarity to collagen.
This protein is likely to be involved in host specificity,
so a more diverged gene would imply that the phages
might have differences in host specificity. The difference
in host specificity between PAD20 and PAS50 is however not very pronounced, since both PAD20 and
PAS50 are equally potent to initiate lysis in most examined P. acnes isolates, even though some isolates can be
used to differentiate the phages [6]. This does not rule
out that a larger screen would detect more differences
in host specificity and more clearly point out the genetic
varieties that determine the host specificity.
Another gene of particular interest is gp17 encoding a
protein that has not yet been assigned a putative function. Gp17 has a H-type lectin domain with E-values
ranging from 0.001-0.04 in the phages examined. Even
though the E-values are rather low, they might still give
an indication of the putative function. H-type lectins are
known to interact with carbohydrates, and the genomic
position of gp17, close to genes encoding tail proteins,
makes it possible that this protein is also a tail protein
interacting with carbohydrates in order to bind to certain structures and potentially mediate a first binding
site for the phage.
The lysis mechanism

All three phages encode an amidase, Gp20, with very
high similarity to a P. acnes autolysin. They also encode
a putative holin (Gp21) with more pronounced sequence
divergence. Phage PA6 and PAS50 have 94% amino acid
identity in the holin protein, while PA6 and PAD20 only
have 84.3% amino acid identity. Interestingly, phage
PAD20 has a deletion in gp22 resulting in a mainly
deleted gp22 and a new open reading frame encoding a
protein with similarities to both Gp22 and Gp23 in PA6
(see additional file 1). gp22 will not be fully translated in
PAS50 due to two internal stop codons.
Identical proteins and putative virulence factors

Several genes (gp39, gp40, gp44 and gp47) encode identical amino acid sequences in PAD20 and PAS50, but
none of these proteins have predicted functions, nor any
significant BLASTp hits, so these genes seem to be specific for P. acnes phages, and might, due to their
sequence similarity be a good tool to use in phylogenetic
analyses of phages isolated from P. acnes. gp29, a gene
in PA6, is absent in both PAD20 and PAS50, but
another ORF in the same region (gp29.1, 19,490-20,056
in PA6) exists in all three phages and might thereby be
more likely to be a true coding gene. However, none of

Page 7 of 14

the putative gp29.1 genes have similarities to other
genes, neither has gp29 in PA6.
Some proteins did get BLAST hits indicating that the
proteins could be putative virulence factors. Among
those are Gp34 that is annotated as a DNA helicase due
to a DnaB helicase domain (E-value 2e-04 for PAD20).
More interesting, this protein also has a Multidrug
Resistance Protein-like transporter domain (E-value 7e06 for PAD20). This domain is less pronounced in
PAS50 (E-value 0.15) and PA6 (E-value 0.001). PAS50
also has a weak hit (E-value 0.21) in Gp30 on a hyaluronidase. However, due to the low similarities to other
proteins, and thereby the low E-values, we can not
assign a function to the phage proteins based on the
similarities to other domains, only determine which
domains they are most similar to.
The phages might also be able to circularize and form
concatamers due to the ssDNA extensions on each side
of the genome. When circularized, a new putative gene
(gp49) can be transcribed. This gene encodes a protein
with some similarity to different nucleoproteins from
Ebola virus, and has a topoisomerase II-associated protein PAT-1 domain (E-value 0.005 for PAS50). Thus,
this gene can only be transcribed when the phage has
circularized and potentially integrated, or formed
concatamers.
Identification of phage proteins

To verify that some of the genes encoded proteins,
PAD20 was precipitated with PEG 6000, the proteins
were separated on a polyacrylamide gel, and then analyzed with MS/MS. All visible bands but band F were
identified (see Figure 2 and Table 3). One of the bands,
band E, was identified as a P. acnes succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit, thus indicating that this
protein exists as a large complex, thereby being eluted
in the same fractions as the whole phage particles during the FPLC gel filtration. Other than the P. acnes flavoprotein, all proteins were identified as phage proteins.
Bands A-D were all identified as the major head protein
of PAD20 (Gp6), which has a calculated molecular
weight of approximately 33 kDa. However, the bands AD have a much higher molecular weight, starting from
approximately 160 kDa for band D, reaching over 500
kDa for band A. Interestingly, we did not get any other
hits on the major head protein with lower molecular
mass proteins, indicating that these proteins tend to
form complexes of 6-8 monomers, based on the apparent molecular weight, that are not disrupted even when
boiling the samples with SDS and reducing agents. A
similar phenomenon has been described before with the
Enterobacteria phage HK97, which has complexes of
covalent linked major head proteins, and not a single
major head protein exist as a monomer [29]. Both the

Lood and Collin BMC Genomics 2011, 12:198
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/198

Page 8 of 14

N-and C-terminal part of the major head protein were
covered, showing that this protein is not processed after
its translation, as some major head proteins require in
order to establish their final conformation.
Other proteins that were identified were Gp14 (tape
measure protein), Gp3 (portal protein), Gp16, Gp15
(minor tail protein) and Gp11 (major tail protein.
Furthermore, band K did not result in a significant hit.
However, the peptide with the highest score was similar
to Gp17 from P. acnes phage PA6. This is further
strengthen by that the apparent molecular weight of the
protein band (29 kDa) is close to the theoretical molecular weight (28,835 Da). Thus, all phage proteins identified seem to be structural proteins, dominated by Gp6
(major head protein) and Gp11 (major tail protein).
Phage life cycle

Figure 2 SDS-PAGE on phage proteins. Phages were purified
using PEG precipitation and gel filtration. The purified phage
proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The protein pattern of
phage PAD20 was identical to that of PAS50. Marked bands (arrow)
were further analysed with MS/MS. Almost all bands were identified
as phage proteins (see Table 3).

The phages used in this study were originally isolated
by mitomycin C treatment of P. acnes isolates. However, those phages were able to infect their host
strains, and thus did not confer superinfection immunity [6]. This data made us conclude that the phages
were lysogenic. A similar phenomenon has been
reported for Leuconostoc oenos phages, where more
than 65% of the bacterial isolates could be induced
with mitomycin C and where the phages were able to
infect their host strains [30].
To further investigate how stable the interaction
between the P. acnes phages and the bacterium was, we
performed ten serial single-colony isolations and then
screened for phages using a PCR assay. All examined
colonies had been cured from phages (data not shown),
indicating that the phages are not true lysogens. This
ability to cure the bacterial isolates from phages suggests
that the interaction between the phage and bacterium
rather might be pseudolysogenic [31-33]. The inability
to cure bacteria from phages was one of the criteria
used to determine that phages from the P. acnes related
bacterium Nocardia erythropolis were lysogenic, due to
that the spontaneous curing of phages was less than
0.4% after 5 serial single-colony isolations [34]. These
phages were also induced with mitomycin C, but they
all showed superinfection immunity. It has also been
shown in several experiments that the environment may
influence the virus-host interaction. This is evident in
the case of phages infecting the archeal species Halobacterium, where the NaCl concentration determines if the
phages enter a lytic cycle, or cause a persisting infection.
At low NaCl concentration, the phages effectively kill
the host, while at higher concentrations of NaCl the
lysis is delayed for several bacterial generations [35-37],
leading to a persistent infection.
To further investigate if P. acnes might harbour pseudolysogenic phages, single colonies from the P. acnes

isolates AD20 and AS50 were inoculated into BHI broth
and different parameters such as OD600 and pfu were
measured two times a day (see Figure 3 and Table 4).
No free infectious phages were detected at any time
point, indicating that if any phages were spontaneously
induced, their number have not exceeded the detection
limit of 100 pfu/ml. However, at time points corresponding to mid-log phase and late-log phase, both
AD20 and AS50 had 10-60% colonies harbouring phage
DNA, as judged by PCR amplification of the major head
gene (see Table 4). However, this carriage of phages is
lost during the stationary growth phase, thus indicating
that the phage DNA is not being replicated at this time
point. Furthermore, the cells at the various time points
were sensitive to PAD20 and PAS50 infection, indicating
that the loss of phages were not due to the development

of resistance (data not shown). This implies that the
phages are not strictly lytic, neither strictly lysogenic.
Much of the data indicates that the P. acnes phages
might have a pseudolysogenic cycle, which is also supported by the genetic information. There are no genes
on the phage genomes with similarities to known integrases or repressors. It is, however, known that certain
filamentous phages can integrate their genomes using
host recombinases [20,21]. However, when extracting P.
acnes chromosomal DNA, phage DNA is lost, as judged
by the absence of a positive PCR reaction for the phage
major head gene (data not shown), indicating that the
phage indeed does not integrate. Thus, it seems like P.
acnes phages can persist as extra-chromosomal plasmids, however when in this state, they are not replicating, since they easily are cured after 10 serial singlecolony isolations.

and genetic material. Earlier attempts to classify phages
according to their proteome have been conducted by
Rohwer et al using 105 phage genomes [38]. We aligned
453 bacteriophage genomes, including PAD20 and
PAS50, using the progressive Mauve algorithm [39] in
order to investigate how the P. acnes phages were
related to other phages. Mauve recognizes conserved
nucleotide segments in the genomes, but has the advantage that it can rearrange the order of these segments,
thereby also identifying genome rearrangements [40].
However, Mauve has several limitations when it comes
to comparing several diverged phage genomes, due to
that Mauve works best with related organisms, and can
not identify conserved regions shared only by a fraction
of the genomes. Thus, aligning the genomes using
Mauve will not generate a reliable phylogenetic tree.
Instead, we used the progressive Mauve algorithm,
which is developed to be able to align more diverged
genomes with less than 50% nucleotide identity. Our
results are in good agreement with the results obtained
by Rohwer et al, but some of the phages are placed differentially. The Sk1-like Siphoviruses with Lactococcus
phage sk1 and phage c2 form two closely related
lineages, and also the lambda-like Siphoviruses align in
a similar way as Rohwer et al. However, Lactococcus
phage r1t is more closely related to Lactococcus phage
Tuc2009 and TPP901-1 in our alignment than was
showed previously. Furthermore, Acinetobacter phage
AP205 is not as diverged from the other Leviphages in
our model as Rohwer shows. Other than that, most
phages cluster in the same groups as was shown by
Rohwer et al, even though we have several more phages
and subgroups of phages, resulting in not as distinct
groupings as in Rohwer’s model. We found that the P.
acnes phage genomes sequenced so far form a new phylogenetic lineage, well separated from other phages, with
no close relatives (see Figure 4 and additional files 3 and
4). Furthermore, the different families of phages are
widely distributed over all classes of bacteria, with
Siphoviruses being the most abundant family reported
in the database. Remarkably, even though PAD20 and
PAS50 have a morphology that classifies them as Siphoviruses, some of their closest related phages are Propionibacterium freudenreichii phage B5 (inovirus),
Acinetobacter phage AP205 (Levivirus) and Pseudomonas phage phi6 segment L (Cystovirus). Furthermore, a
group of podoviruses including Yersinia phage Berlin
seem to be closely related to a group of myoviruses with
Vibrio, Aeromonas and Enterobacteria phages. Also of
interest is that most phages infecting Mycobacterium
and Streptomyces were rather closely related to phages
from Propionibacterium. This is not surprising, since the
bacterial hosts also are related. Of more interest is that
Proteobacteria such as Pseudomonas, Burkholderia and

Page 10 of 14

Ralstonia phages also were related to phages infecting
the Actinobacteria phylum, while other Proteobacteria
as Vibrio and Salmonella were not. Other than that,
bacterial families tend to have closely related phages,
even though the classification of the phage families can
differ in a bacterial species, as the very closely related
Mycobacterium phage Rizal and Rosebush, that are classified as a Myovirus and a Siphovirus, respectively.
Thus, this clearly shows that classification of phages
solely based on morphology is not sufficient to determine to which family a phage should be assigned, but
that genomic data is also necessary.

Conclusions
We have found that phages isolated from P. acnes are
highly similar and show high nucleotide sequence identity. Several of the phage structural proteins were identified using MALDI-TOF MS/MS. The sequenced phages
do not seem to encode any putative virulence factors.
Finally we could show that the phages seem to be able
to cause pseudolysogeny in their hosts.
Methods
Bacteriophages and bacterial isolates

Bacteriophages PAD20 and PAS50 were isolated as previously described [6]. Stock solutions were stored at 4°C
in SM-buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl,
60 mM MgSO4 (7H2O), 0.01% gelatin). Bacterial isolates
KPA171202, AD12, AD20, AD21, AD33 and AS50 were
plated from frozen stocks on Tryptic Soy Broth supplemented with 1.5% agar (Bacto, Mt Pritchard, NSW, Australia) and incubated at 37°C under anaerobic conditions
until colonies were clearly visible.
DNA sequencing and analysis

Since we had problems getting high concentrations of
pure phage DNA, we adapted a PCR based approach.
Phage lysate (1010 PFU/ml) was boiled for 5 min and 1
μl added as a DNA template to Fermentas High Fidelity
PCR Enzyme Mix (Vilnius, Lithuania). Primers were
designed to generate 4-6 kbp long overlapping products
based on the already sequenced P. acnes phage PA6
genome, covering the whole genome (see Table 5). The
overlapping regions were in most cases more than 200
bp, and confirmatory PCRs were run over the whole
genome to exclude that we by this approach missed any
inserts. The PCR was run under the following conditions: 94°C 2 min, 10 cycles of 94°C 30 sec, annealing
temperature 30 sec, 72°C 6 min. This was followed by
35 repeats of 94°C 30 sec, annealing temperature 30 sec
and 72°C 6 min (+20 sec/repeat). PCR products were
cleaned up with SpinPrep PCR Clean-up Kit (Novagen,
Madison, WI, USA). Products were sequenced using
BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied

aligned using a progressive Mauve alignment. For visualization, 28 of the phages representing different clusters of most closely related phages

an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
For each sequencing, a new PCR generated DNA template was used, minimising the impact of the PCR.
When assembled, a >3-fold coverage with identical
nucleotides was achieved. Sequences were assembled
and aligned using the Clustal W algorithm [41]. Analyses were performed using the MacVector v9.5.2 software package (Cary, NC, USA). The sequence of the
ssDNA ends was determined by similarity to phage PA6
after a PCR over the ends of the phage genome.
Identification of promoter regions and terminator
structures

The genome of PAD20, PAS50 and PA6 were screened
for putative sigma70-promoters using SAK and BPROM

Lood and Collin BMC Genomics 2011, 12:198
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/198

(Softberry, Inc.). Using SAK [42], a value higher than 1
was regarded as positive. Terminator structures were
identified using FindTerm (Softberry, Inc.) and EMBOSS
Explorer [43]. Palindromes followed by a high content of
U and with a stable secondary structure (less than -20.0
in minimum free energy) were considered to be transcriptional terminators.
Phage protein identification

The phages were purified according to Boulanger [44],
with some modifications. Briefly, bacterial lysates were
treated with 0.5 M NaCl for 1 h at 4°C to separate
phage particles from bacteria. The solution was centrifugated (10 min, 8,000 g, 4°C) and the supernatant moved
to a new tube. PEG 6000 was added to a final concentration of 10%, and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The phages
were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min at
4°C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in PBS. Whole phage particles were then separated from bacterial proteins using gelfiltration
(Superose 6 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare, Sweden,
Uppsala) operated on a ÄKTAprime plus (GE Healthcare). Protein fractions containing phage particles were
eluted early during the run due to their high molecular
mass. Fractions with phage particles were pooled and
precipitated with 10% PEG 6000 for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in PBS, mixed with SDS loading
buffer, boiled for 3 min and loaded on a 10% SDSPAGE gel [45]. The gels were run at 170 V for 1 h and
stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. All visible
bands were cut out using a sterile scalpel. The gels
spots were destained with 50 μ1 50%.acetonitrile (ACN)
in 25 mM NH4HCO3 and dried using a speed vacuum
for 10-15 min. To the dried spots, 10 mM DTT dissolved in 100 mM NH4HCO3 was added and incubated
for 1 hour at 56°C. The DTT was removed and 55 mM
iodoacetamide dissolved in NH4HCO3 was added and
incubated for 45 min at room temperature in the dark.
The gel pieces were washed several times with
NH4HCO3, followed by dehydration with ACN and
were dried using a speed vacuum. The gel pieces were
incubated with 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Promega) in 50 mM
NH4HCO3 at 4°C for 45 minutes. The digestion continued over night at 37°C, and was terminated by the addition of 5% trifluoroacetic acid in 75% ACN. Samples
were subjected to HPLC-MS/MS, by analyzing them on
a Qtof Ultima API (ESI-MS/MS from Waters, Manchester, UK) coupled to a CapLC (Waters). The peptides
were injected and trapped on a pre-column (C18, 300
μm × 5 mm, 5 μm, 100Å, LC-Packings), and separated
on a reversed phase analytical column (Atlantis, C18, 75
μm × 150 mm, 3 μm, 100Å, Waters). The flow rate
through the column was 250 nl/min. Solvent A was 2%
ACN in water with 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B was

Page 12 of 14

90% ACN, 10% water and 0.1% formic acid. The HPLC
started with 5% solution B for 5 min, increased the concentration of B to 60% in 40 min, and to 80% B in 5
min. The concentration of B was kept at 80% for 25
min and finally at 5% B for 15 min. The mass spectrometer analysis was made by Data Dependent Acquisition
(DDA). The mass range m/z was from 50-1800 for MS/
MS. Only spectra from ions with charge states 2 and 3
were acquired. Generated files were used to search in
MASCOT MS/MS Ions search using a peptide tolerance
of 0.6 Da and a MS/MS tolerance of 0.8 Da. Hits on
peptides were regarded positive if they had a p-value
below 0.05.
Serial single-colony isolation

AD20 and AS50 were cultured on Brain Heart Infusion
Agar plates (BHIA-plates) for three to four days, until
visible single colonies were seen. Ten single colonies
from each bacterium were selected, and ten serial streak
isolations were made. The presence of phages in the
final isolated colonies was detected by a PCR assay
screening for the well-conserved major head gene, as
described elsewhere [6].
Growth curve of P. acnes isolates

P. acnes isolates AD20 and AS50 were plated on BHIAplates for three to four days. Single colonies were inoculated into pre-reduced BHI broth, and samples were
analysed every 12 th hour for OD 600 , cfu, infectious
phages (pfu i ), and carriage of phages (pfu c ). Colony
forming units were measured by dilution of the bacterial
culture and plating on BHIA-plates. Pfui was measured
by sterile filtration of the undiluted growth medium,
using overlay plates as described elsewhere [6]. The
detection limit using this method was >100 pfu/ml. To
investigate the percentage of bacteria carrying phage
DNA (pfuc), single colonies at each time point were subjected to PCR for the identification of the major head
gene, using the recA gene as a positive control, as
described elsewhere [6]. All experiments were performed
in triplicates.
Phage phylogenetic analysis

The software Geneious (Geneious Pro 4.6.6, Biomatters
Ltd) was used to download 451 different phage genomes from GenBank, searching for genomes with
‘phage’ in the title. The genomes for Propionibacterium
phage PAD20 and PAS50 were added, and aligned
using the software Mauve [39] with progressive Mauve,
using the default settings. The generated guide-tree
was then visualized with Geneious. For better visualization, 28 phage genomes were selected based on their
localisation and their relationship with P. acnes phages
on the complete phylogenetic tree, and a new

Additional file 2: Gene comparison between phage PA6, PAD20 and
PAS50. An ‘x’ indicates that the gene is absent, while a minus (-)
indicates that no comparison of the genes were possible.
Additional file 3: Bacteriophage genomes used in phylogenetic
alignment. Bacteriophages used in the phylogenetic alignment are
ordered together with their accession number for reference.
Additional file 4: Phylogenetic tree of more than 450 bacteriophage
genomes. More than 450 bacteriophage genomes were aligned using
progressive Mauve. The generated tree-file was then visualized using the
software Geneious The different colours represents different families of
phages - bright green (Siphovirus), red (Myovirus), blue (Podovirus), pink
(Inovirus), light blue (Levivirus), gray (Cystovirus), purple (Tectivirus),
brown (Microvirus), pale green (Corticovirus), orange (Plasmavirus) and
black (non-assigned).
