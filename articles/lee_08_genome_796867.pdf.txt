Abstract
Background: Biological nitrogen fixation is a prokaryotic process that plays an essential role in
the global nitrogen cycle. Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571 has the dual capacity to fix nitrogen
both as free-living organism and in a symbiotic interaction with Sesbania rostrata. The host is a fastgrowing, submergence-tolerant tropical legume on which A. caulinodans can efficiently induce
nodule formation on the root system and on adventitious rootlets located on the stem.
Results: The 5.37-Mb genome consists of a single circular chromosome with an overall average
GC of 67% and numerous islands with varying GC contents. Most nodulation functions as well as
a putative type-IV secretion system are found in a distinct symbiosis region. The genome contains
a plethora of regulatory and transporter genes and many functions possibly involved in contacting
a host. It potentially encodes 4717 proteins of which 96.3% have homologs and 3.7% are unique for
A. caulinodans. Phylogenetic analyses show that the diazotroph Xanthobacter autotrophicus is the
closest relative among the sequenced genomes, but the synteny between both genomes is very
poor.

Conclusion: The genome analysis reveals that A. caulinodans is a diazotroph that acquired the
capacity to nodulate most probably through horizontal gene transfer of a complex symbiosis island.
The genome contains numerous genes that reflect a strong adaptive and metabolic potential. These
combined features and the availability of the annotated genome make A. caulinodans an attractive
organism to explore symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation beyond leguminous plants.

Background
Biological nitrogen fixation is carried out by a limited
number of prokaryotes that all possess a nitrogenase
enzyme complex that reduces molecular dinitrogen to
ammonia. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria can be divided in two
major groups: free-living nitrogen fixers or diazotrophs
that directly assimilate ammonia for growth and symbiotic nitrogen fixers that pass ammonia to a eukaryotic
host and indirectly profit from nitrogen fixation by occupying a particular ecological niche or by supporting the
population through better feeding. In the latter group, the
symbiosis between leguminous crop plants and rhizobia
is of great importance for agriculture. The term "rhizobia"
is used for bacteria that induce the formation of new
organs, nodules, on the roots of a specific legume host.
Inside the nodule, rhizobia are internalized in plant cells
where they differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids
[for a recent review on legume nodulation, see [1]].
Nitrogen-fixing nodules typically occur on roots; however, some members of the subfamilies Papilionoideae
(Aeschenomyne sp., Sesbania sp., and Discolobium pulchellum) and Mimosoideae (Neptunia oleracea) form stemlocated, aerial nodules [2]. These legumes grow in waterlogged soils of tropical regions and are characterized by
dormant, stem-located adventitious root primordia that
can develop into stem nodules upon inoculation with an
appropriate microbial partner. Although stem and root
nodulation are similar, in the latter the nodular vascular
system is connected to that of the stem via the vascular
bundles of the adventitious root primordium [3].
A particularly well-studied case of stem nodulation occurs
in Sesbania rostrata Brem. upon inoculation with the
microsymbiont Azorhizobium caulinodans [4]. S. rostrata, a
fast-growing annual shrub from the Sahel region of WestAfrica, carries numerous adventitious root primordia that
protrude through the stem cortex and epidermis, creating
a circular fissure, where bacteria can invade and proliferate [5]. The growth properties and the high rate of nitrogen fixation of stem-nodulated plants make S. rostrata
well fit as green manure in rice cultivation and, possibly,
as a pioneer plant for wetland improvement [6].
The bacterium, isolated from stem nodules [4] and originally designated Rhizobium sp. strain ORS571, was
renamed Azorhizobium caulinodans inspired by the stem

(cauli-)nodulating capacity and by the diazotrophic properties of the strain (azo-rhizobium). Its host range for
effective nodulation is very narrow: although nodulation
of several Sesbania sp. has been reported, nitrogen-fixing
nodules are formed only on S. rostrata and S. punctata [7].
A. caulinodans also induces Fix nodules on Phaseolus vulgaris and Leucaena leucocephala [8]. Two features distinguish A. caulinodans from other rhizobia: its taxonomic
position and its dual capacity for free-living and symbiotic
nitrogen fixation. The latter is exceptional [9] and implies
a regulatory mechanism to either assimilate the ammonia
or donate it to the plant in the symbiotic interaction. The
first taxonomic study of A. caulinodans strain ORS571 [10]
showed that it belongs to the Rhodopseudomonas palustris
rRNA branch of purple bacteria, but that it is quite distinct
from both Rhodopseudomonas and Bradyrhizobium spp.
Based on numerical analysis of phenotypes, protein patterns, and DNA-DNA and DNA-rRNA hybridizations, A.
caulinodans was considered as a separate genus with Xanthobacter as closest relative [11]. Xanthobacter sp. are diazotrophic bacteria found in diverse soil habitats and in
association with rice (Oryza sativa) roots [12,13]. Comparison of 16S rRNA sequences indicated that X. flavus and A.
caulinodans are strongly related [14].
Here, we present the genome sequence of the A. caulinodans strain ORS571 and discuss the annotation in function of the organism's biology with reference to
comparative genomics. This information will stimulate
the research on an organism that has real potential for
novel applications in agriculture.

Results
Genome organization
Sequencing of the genome of A. caulinodans strain
ORS571 (hereafter designated A. caulinodans) revealed a
single circular chromosome of 5,369,772 base pairs [15].
Relevant genome features generated with the BLASTatlas
tool [16] are presented in Figure 1 and can be viewed in
detail as a web-based resource [17]. The putative origin of
replication was predicted based on the position of a GC
skew shift (Figure 1) [18] and coincided with the occurrence of a gene cluster typically associated with origins of
replication in circular chromosomes of α-proteobacteria
(Figure 2A) [19]. The specific distribution and orientation

DNA translocase and directing it to the replication terminus in α-proteobacteria [20], confirmed the predicted
location of the origin between AZC_4717 and AZC_0001
(Figure 2B).
Although the overall GC content of the A. caulinodans
genome is 67% and the average GC incidence at the third
position of the codon (GC3) is 85%, the chromosome has
many islands of varying size with different GC (Figure 3A)
and GC3 contents (Figure 3B). In accordance with the
overall high GC content, the codon usage is shifted

toward GC-rich codons (Figure 4A) and, consequently,
GC-coded amino acids are overrepresented (Figure 4B).
Combined computer prediction and similarity searches
(Methods) revealed 4717 protein-encoding genes with an
average coding density of one gene in every 1123 bp
(89%). With the BLASTP program (Methods), the amino
acid sequences were compared with the sequences in the
nonredundant protein database at NCBI. A putative function could be assigned to 3588 genes (76.1%), 954 genes
(20.2%) were similar to hypothetical genes, and the

between the 16S and 23S genes. A total of 53 tRNA genes
representing 44 tRNA species for all 20 amino acids were
assigned by sequence similarity and computer prediction
with the tRNAscan-SE program [21]. Most of the tRNA
genes are dispersed on the genome and are probably transcribed as single units. Thirty out of 57 ribosomal protein
genes occur in a cluster (AZC_2529-AZC_2559), whereas
the others are scattered over the genome (Additional file
1).
Phylogeny and comparative genomics
For phylogenetic analysis (Methods), the genomes of A.
caulinodans and of 44 α-proteobacteria were compared
(Additional file 2). The data set was assembled based on
the available complete genome sequences (closure date
August 15, 2007) and ecological or phylogenetic relatedness. The resulting maximum-likelihood tree (Figure 5A)
showed a great concordance with α-proteobacterial trees
based on complete 16S rRNA genes [22] or sets of protein
families [23]. Our analysis placed A. caulinodans closest to
X. autotrophicus, Nitrobacter winogradskyi, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum, consistent with previous taxonomic studies [9,10,13]. With A.
caulinodans as a reference genome, a graphical representation of the BLAST hits of the proteins encoded by the
genomes of the 13 closest relatives was generated with the
BLASTatlas tool (Figure 1) [16,17].

registered gene (Figure 1; Table 1; Additional file 1).
Three rRNA clusters are ordered as 5S-23S-16S (located
between the protein-coding genes AZC_0613-AZC_0614,
AZC_4195-AZC_4196, and AZC_4435-AZC_4436) and
all have an insertion of a tRNA-Ile and a tRNA-Ala

For a broader view of the gene relationships, the occurrence and organization of the proteins encoded by these
45 genomes were evaluated (Methods). Each gene of a
total data set of 146,315 was classified in one of four
groups: orphans, genes without homologs in other bacteria of the data set; singletons, genes with one representative in the genome and homologs in other genomes;
phage or integrase-related genes; and duplicated genes or
paralogs with more than one paralog in the genome. The
distribution of each of these categories differed in the surveyed genomes (Figure 5B). Paralog representation
ranged from 5% for the Neorickettsia sennetsu strain Miyayama (genome size 0.86 Mb) to 44% for Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. vicae (strain 3841) (genome size 7.79 Mb),
whereas A. caulinodans had 36% paralogs (genome size
5.37 Mb). The data confirmed the observation that the
number of paralogs strongly correlates with the genome
size in a linear regression [24].
Altogether, these analyses demonstrate that currently X.
autotrophicus is the closest sequenced relative of A. caulinodans. However, a comparison of the genomes with the
ARTEMIS comparison tool [25] revealed a very low degree
of synteny (Additional file 3). Although short sequence
stretches are conserved, extensive rearrangements have
taken place. The occurrence of four prophages and numerous transposases in the A. caulinodans genome suggests a

high genome plasticity. In A. caulinodans, 1412 proteins
have no counterpart in X. autotrophicus of which 544
(38%) are catalogued as unknown or hypothetical (Additional file 4). In the remaining group of functionally classified proteins, 46% have GC and GC3 contents different
from the genome averages, suggesting recent acquisition.
Functional protein classes and metabolic pathways
The putative protein-encoding genes were ordered into 17
classes [26] (Table 1) and the metabolic potential of A.
caulinodans was analyzed with the PathoLogic tool of the
BioCyC/MetaCYC suite [27].

These analyses revealed the presence of many regulatory
genes (8%) and several RNA polymerase σ factors, among
which two household σ70 factors (AZC_3643 and
AZC_4253), two σ54 factors (AZC_2924 and AZC_3925;
see below), and five σ factors of the extracytoplasmic subclass (AZC_0389, AZC_1202, AZC_2427, AZC_2453, and
AZC_3238), implying responsiveness to many environmental triggers. As A. caulinodans is a motile bacterium, a
large gene cluster is present (AZC_0615-AZC_0666) for
the formation of a type-III flagellum. A significant number
of chemotaxis genes predicts the capacity to respond to a
wide array of molecules (Additional file 5). While no
complete quorum sensing system could be detected, the
presence of no less than five LuxR-type response regula-

A variety of encoded proteins might offer protection
against toxic compounds in the environment (Additional
file 6). Examples are two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and pathways to degrade or modify plant-derived
molecules, such as protocatechuate, and xenobiotics, such
as cyanate, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, octane, and gallate. Several multidrug efflux pumps, antibiotic-modifying
enzymes, and heavy metal translocation systems probably
confer resistance to deleterious compounds. The production of the siderophores enterobactin and aerobactin
might guarantee iron acquisition from the surroundings.
The surface of bacteria is important for recognition,
attachment, and colonization during the interaction with
a host. Exopolysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides are
involved in nodulation as protective compounds against
defense molecules generated by the plant and as communication signals [28-30]. Other functions could relate to
surface structures, important for interaction with the host
(Additional file 7), e.g. putative adhesion proteins, antigens, and 29 genes that code for proteins with GGDEF/
EAL domains. The latter typically play a role in the transition from a motile planktonic form to a sessile biofilm by
controlling the formation and degradation of the secondary messenger cyclic di-GMP [31]. Hormones also play an
important role in plant-microbe interactions. Both a structural (AZC_0267) and a regulatory gene (AZC_0266)
mediating degradation of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate, are present in the genome.

Over 15% of the genes are dedicated to "transport and
binding", of which more than 50% belong to the ATPbinding-cassette (ABC) transporter class. With 118 complete systems (consisting of a solute-binding protein, a
permease, and an ABC component for the uptake systems,
or an ABC component and a permease for the export systems), and numerous orphan subunits scattered over the
genome, the transporter complement of A. caulinodans
equals that of many other soil bacteria. These high-affinity
transport systems are dedicated to the uptake of peptides,
amino acids, sugars, polyamines, siderophores, nitrate/
sulfonate/bicarbonate, or C4-dicarboxylate and many
unknown substrates (Additional file 8). Accordingly, catabolic pathways are predicted for compounds, such as
amino acids (including citrulline and ornithine), glucuronate, galactonate, galactarate, gluconate, quinate, L-idonate, creatinine, and 4-hydroxymandelate. Sugars, such as
glucose, fructose, sucrose, ribose, xylose, xylulose, and lactose are not metabolized by A. caulinodans; instead, dicarboxylic acids are used as primary carbon source [10], as
reflected by the presence of multiple C4-dicarboxylic acid
transport systems. The occurrence of 16 putative alcohol
dehydrogenase genes suggests that ethanol could be a
major carbon source under flooded conditions. A. caulinodans is also capable of oxidizing hydrogen, an obligatory
by-product of the nitrogenase, and the required hup, hyp,
and hoxA genes are located in a large gene cluster
(AZC_0594-AZC_0613) [32]. Encoded energy metabolism pathways include glycolysis, Entner-Doudoroff, and
TCA cycle. The absence of a gene encoding phosphofructokinase indicates the lack of a functional Emden-Meyerhof pathway.
Nitrogen fixation and related functions
Table 2 lists the genomic position of A. caulinodans genes
related to free-living and symbiotic nitrogen fixation.
These genes code for known functions, such as formation
of the nitrogenase, assembly and stabilization of the complex, synthesis of the MoFe cofactor and the FeS clusters,
electron transport, ammonium assimilation, and regulation of gene expression by nitrogen and oxygen, but also
for proteins whose exact role await experimental confirmation. Several nif genes occur in more than one copy and
are scattered over the genome as solitary loci or clusters of
varying size with GC and GC3 contents matching the averages of the genome (Additional file 1). The NifH phylogeny was congruent with the phylogenetic relationships
based on 16S rRNA [33] or on core protein families [Figure 5A]. The same holds true for the other genes listed in
Table 2 (data not shown).

The transcriptional activator NifA (AZC_1049) acts
together with a σ54 factor RpoN (AZC_3925) to control
the nif/fix gene expression [34]. Nitrogen regulation of
nifA expression is under control of the NtrBC (AZC_3086-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/271

AZC_3087) and NtrYX (AZC_3083-AZC_3084) two-component systems [35,36] that respond to the intracellular
and extracellular nitrogen status, respectively. The expression of these two loci depends on a hypothetical σ54 factor
RpoF [34], which presumably corresponds to AZC_2924.
Oxygen control of nifA expression is mediated by FixLJ
(AZC_4654 and AZC_4655) [37], and the transcription
factor FixK (AZC_4653) [38]. The nifA gene is further controlled at the transcriptional level by a LysR-type regulator
[39] and at the translational level by the nrfA gene product
(AZC_3080) [40]. FixK also activates transcription of the
cytNOQP operon (AZC_4523-AZC_4526), encoding the
high-affinity terminal oxidase cytochrome cbb3 that is
induced under microaerobiosis [41,42]. Mutants in cytNOQP still fix nitrogen under free-living conditions, suggesting the occurrence of another terminal oxidase
[41,43]. The survey of the genome excluded the presence
of a second cytochrome cbb3 complex, but revealed two
cytochrome bd complexes (AZC_1353-AZC_1354 and
AZC_3759-AZC_3760).
A symbiosis region
A region of 87.6 kb, delimited by a Gly-tRNA (position
4346061) and an integrase (AZC_3882) and flanked by
direct repeats (Figure 6), is characterized by an overall
lower GC (Figure 3C) and GC3 contents (Figure 3D) than
the genome averages, and a different preferential codon
usage (Figure 4A). No less than 18 putative transposases
and three integrases are present, suggesting a complex history of horizontal gene transfer events. The region contains the three nod loci that are involved in the synthesis
and secretion of the lipochitooligosaccharide Nod factors
(NFs) [44], but also genes related to chemotaxis, amino
acid uptake, and a putative type-IV secretion system
(Additional file 1).

The three nod loci are not adjacent and have a GC content
lower than that of the surrounding sequences (Figure 3C).
The shifts in GC content correspond to the location of
repeated elements that are flanked by insertion sequences
or tRNAs (Figures 1 and 6). The constitutively expressed
nodD gene (AZC_3792) [45,46] codes for a LysR-type regulator that activates transcription of the two other flavonoid-inducible nod loci. The inducible operon
nodABCSUIJZnoeCHOP (AZC_3818-AZC_3807) [47-49]
encodes most of the enzymatic machinery for NF backbone synthesis, decoration, and secretion. The biochemical role of these proteins has been extensively described,
except for the last four open reading frames noeCHOP that
are involved in NF arabinosylation and are still under
study. Based on similarity with proteins involved in arabinosylation of the cell wall in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
noeC (AZC_3810), noeH (AZC_3809), and noeO
(AZC_3808) might encode the synthesis of a D-arabinose
precursor [50-52]. The third locus encodes the inducible

nolK gene responsible for GDP-fucose synthesis for NF
decoration (AZC_3850) [53,54].
The symbiosis region also contains two conjugationrelated gene clusters with GC and GC3 contents comparable to the genome averages. The cluster AZC_3844AZC_3826 – flanked by two transposases – consists of
repA and genes encoding conjugal transfer, partition, and
plasmid stabilization proteins (Additional file 1). In the
cluster AZC_3856–3877, flanked by a transposase and an
integrase, genes are found that are homologous to the trbBCDEJLFGI genes, a type-IV secretion system involved in
conjugative transfer of the tumor-inducing plasmid in
Agrobacterium tumefaciens [55] (Figure 6).
The genome annotation indicates the presence of a few
additional nodulation-related genes outside of the symbiosis region (Additional file 1). Two response regulators
(AZC_1361 and AZC_2281) homologous to nodW genes
of Bradyrhizobium japonicum and part of a two-component
signal transduction system might be involved in the
response to host-exuded flavonoids [56]. A nodT-related
gene (AZC_3288) [57] might act as the outer-membrane
component in NF secretion together with the inner-membrane NodIJ proteins. None of these four potential nodulation genes has a different GC or GC3 content, in contrast
to the nod genes of the symbiosis region.

Discussion

Azorhizobium caulinodans is a member of the α-proteobacteria, a group with diverse genome architectures. Several
plant-associated representatives, such as Agrobacterium
and Sinorhizobium, have quite considerable genomes and
large circular or linear plasmids. In contrast, A. caulinodans
has a single circular chromosome of 5.37 Mb and no auxiliary replicons. The GC content and the coding density
are in range with other rhizobia and soil bacteria. A.
caulinodans is a motile, nitrogen-fixing, hydrogen-oxidizing, aerobic bacterium with a preference for organic acids
as carbon source. This lifestyle is reflected in the metabolic
pathways and in clusters for flagellum synthesis, motility,
and chemotaxis. A high number of genes are dedicated to
transport and regulation, indicating that a wide range of
substrates can be taken up, but that the pathways are
tightly regulated to limit the metabolic burden. Besides
the well-described role of surface polysaccharides during
plant-microbe interactions, the genome of A. caulinodans
encodes functions that might be involved in biofilm formation, possibly facilitating the interaction with a host.
Ongoing functional analysis will undoubtedly reveal new
players in the ecology of the dual lifestyle of A. caulinodans
[58,59].
Genome analysis combined with phylogenetic studies has
shed new light on bacterial evolution and taxonomy. Core

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/271

functions can be identified that are highly conserved
between related groups, but that may acquire individual
characteristics through accessory genes [60]. Analysis of a
family of core proteins and 16S rDNA sequence comparison revealed that the closest relative of A. caulinodans is
Xanthobacter autotrophicus. Xanthobacter sp. are free-living
nitrogen fixers and the nif and fix genes can thus be considered part of the core functions of the Azorhizobium-Xanthobacter group. The major difference in the lifestyle of
both organisms is that A. caulinodans has acquired the
ability to establish a symbiosis with S. rostrata.
The nodulation capacities are related to the presence of a
symbiosis region with distinct GC and GC3 contents and
codon usage. The association with tRNA loci, which presumably act as targets for the integration of foreign DNA,
and multiple transposons suggest a high plasticity of this
region, as reflected in its composition. The symbiosis
region contains three subclusters related to nodulation,
nodABCSUIJZnoeCHOP, nodD, and nolK that are flanked
by sequences suggestive of independent horizontal acquisition. The repeated elements could be the relics of insertion elements that once played a role in the evolution of
the A. caulinodans nodulation genes that have all the characteristics of archetypal accessory genes.
To study the evolution of nod genes, A. caulinodans forms
an interesting case. The azorhizobial nod genes are only
distantly related to their counterparts in other rhizobia.
Phylogenetic comparisons demonstrated that the nodA
and nodC genes from rhizobia that nodulate temperate
legumes (e.g. S. meliloti, R. leguminosarum bv. viciae and
bv. trifolii, and R. galegae) are grouped together and the
genes from rhizobia that nodulate tropical legumes (e.g.
B. japonicum, B. elkanii, R. loti, R. tropici, and R. etli) form
a second cluster [61,62]. However, the nodA, nodB, and
nodC genes of A. caulinodans belong neither to the tropical
nor the temperate clusters [62,63]. Also, the genetic distance between the nodSU genes of A. caulinodans and their
counterparts in other rhizobia is much greater than the
mutual genetic distance between the nodSU genes of these
rhizobia [8]. The organization of the nodABCSUIJ genes in
A. caulinodans resembles the situation in B. japonicum, but
the upstream and downstream regions are different
[64,65].
At present we do not know the origin of the symbiotic
genes of A. caulinodans. The Rhizobiaceae, which have
been historically considered a true family in phylogenetic
terms, now seem a rather diverse group of bacteria, including Methylobacterium, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia that
share variant, relatively recently acquired, symbiotic gene
clusters. Possibly, the A. caulinodans nod genes are derived
from unexplored rhizobia or even from obligate endophytes. Undoubtedly, the recent and ongoing explosion

the origin of the nodulation functions.

AP009384.

Conclusion

Structural and functional annotation
Coding regions were assigned by a combination of computer prediction and similarity search. Briefly, the proteincoding regions were predicted with the Glimmer 2.02 program [72] and all regions equal to or longer than 90 bp
were translated into amino acid sequences that were subjected to similarity searches against the nonredundant
protein database at NCBI with the BLASTP program [73].
In parallel, the entire genomic sequence was compared
with those in the nonredundant protein database with the
BLASTX program [73] to identify genes that had escaped
prediction and/or were smaller than 90 bp, especially in
the predicted intergenic regions. For predicted genes without sequence similarity to known genes, only those equal
to or longer than 150 bp were considered as candidates.
Functions were assigned to the predicted genes based on
sequence similarity of their deduced products to that of
genes of known function. For genes that encode proteins
of 100 amino acid residues or more, an E-value of 10-20
was considered significant, whereas a higher E-value was
significant for genes encoding smaller proteins (E-value
treshold of 10-10). Genes for structural RNAs were
assigned by similarity search against the in-house structural RNA database that had been generated based on the
GenBank data. tRNA-encoding regions were predicted by
the tRNAscan-SE 1.21 program [21] in combination with
the similarity search.

Extension of symbiotic nitrogen fixation to non-legume
cereal plants is a challenging long-standing goal. Especially, there is a growing interest in nitrogen-fixing organisms that could establish an endophytic, beneficial
relation with important crops, such as rice and wheat
(Triticum aestivum). Interestingly in this context, the occurrence of A. caulinodans has been reported in intercellular
infection pockets located in the cortex of roots of Arabidopsis thaliana and wheat [66]. In fields where S. rostrata
and rice are grown as rotation crops, A. caulinodans seems
to survive very well in the rhizosphere of the rice plants
and in the soil [67]. Moreover, the bacterium invades
emerging lateral roots of rice, and rice seedlings inoculated with A. caulinodans have a high nitrogenase activity
[68]. Finally, A. caulinodans fixes nitrogen under relatively
high oxygen tension as a free-living organism, invades the
host via cracks, and establishes intercellular colonies.
Altogether, these features might be advantageous for primary infection of nitrogen-starved root systems and highlight the potential of A. caulinodans as a candidate model
organism. The genome sequence data provide new opportunities for exploring the regulatory aspects of Azorhizobium nitrogen fixation and the essential features that
implement the ability for endosymbiosis.

Methods
DNA sequencing
The nucleotide sequence of the entire genome of A. caulinodans ORS571 was determined by the whole-genome
shotgun strategy method. For shotgun cloning, DNA fragments of 2 to 3 kb were cloned into the HincII site of
pUC118. For gap closing, the pCC1Fos vector (Epicentre,
Madison, WI, USA) was used, and approximately 35-kb
clones were prepared. The accumulated sequence files
were assembled with the Phrap program [69]. A total of
71,424 random sequence files corresponding to approximately 7.7 genome equivalents were assembled to generate draft sequences. Finishing was carried out by visual
editing of the sequences, followed by gap closing, and
additional sequencing to obtain sequence data with a
Phred score of 20 or higher [70,71]. The integrity of the
final genome sequence was assessed by comparing the
insert length of each fosmid clone with the computed distance between the end sequences of the clones. The end
sequence data facilitated gap closure as well as accurate
reconstruction of the entire genome. The final gaps in the
sequences were filled by the primer walking method. A
lower threshold of acceptability for the generation of consensus sequences was set at a Phred score of 20 for each
base. The nucleotide sequence is available in the DDBJ/

MetaCyc analysis [27,74] detected 229 metabolic pathways, containing 1037 reaction steps. To assess the presence or absence of a metabolic pathway and to decrease
the likelihood of being misled by the many enzymes that
are shared among multiple pathways, the analysis was
emphasized on the presence of enzymes that are unique
to a pathway.
Construction of a phylogenetic tree
The Maximum-likelihood tree was based on 108 core proteins of 45 α-proteobacteria [23] whose sequence data
and annotation files were available and downloaded from
the NCBI Microbial Genome Resource database [75]. The
set of core genes was determined by an all-against-all
BLAST at protein level. Best reciprocal hits were selected,
taking into account a cut-off value defined as 20% similarity and an overlap of at least 150 amino acids. Only proteins present in all 45 genomes as single copy were
considered as "core proteins" and used to construct the
phylogenetic tree. The total alignment contained 32,327
amino acids. The tree was constructed with the Phyml
program [76] and a WAG substitution model [77] and
100 bootstrap replicates were run. Unless indicated otherwise, bootstraps are 100 (Figure 5A).
