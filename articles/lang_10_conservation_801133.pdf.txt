Abstract
Background: The modern coelacanth (Latimeria) is the extant taxon of a basal sarcopterygian lineage and sister
group to tetrapods. Apart from certain apomorphic traits, its morphology is characterized by a high degree of
retention of ancestral vertebrate structures and little morphological change. An insight into the molecular
evolution that may explain the unchanged character of Latimeria morphology requires the analysis of the
expression patterns of developmental regulator genes and their cis-regulatory modules (CRMs).
Results: We describe the comparative and functional analysis of the sonic hedgehog (shh) genomic region of
Latimeria menadoensis. Several putative enhancers in the Latimeria shh locus have been identified by comparisons
to sarcopterygian and actinopterygian extant species. Specific sequence conservation with all known
actinopterygian enhancer elements has been detected. However, these elements are selectively missing in more
recently diverged actinopterygian and sarcopterygian species. The functionality of the putative Latimeria enhancers
was confirmed by reporter gene expression analysis in transient transgenic zebrafish and chick embryos.
Conclusions: Latimeria shh CRMs represent the ancestral set of enhancers that have emerged before the split of
lobe-finned and ray-finned fishes. In contrast to lineage-specific losses and differentiations in more derived
lineages, Latimeria shh enhancers reveal low levels of sequence diversification. High overall sequence conservation
of shh conserved noncoding elements (CNE) is consistent with the general trend of high levels of conservation of
noncoding DNA in the slowly evolving Latimeria genome.

Background
Evolutionary change of cis-regulatory regions is not well
understood, and there are conflicting observations about
how much cis-regulatory evolution is linked to diversification of gene expression. Compensatory changes in cisregulatory regions argue for a weak correlation of both
[1,2]. Nevertheless, strong DNA sequence conservation
of enhancers of developmental regulator genes [3-8]
implies purifying selection to keep such regions preserved across species and functionally constrained in
their cis-regulatory functions. Comparative genomics is

widely used for the detection of conserved noncoding
elements (CNE) which can be examined experimentally
for cis-regulatory function [8-12]. Despite certain discussion [13-18], cis-regulatory modules (CRM) are regarded
as likely targets for adaptive molecular changes that lead
to morphological variation [13,16].
The modern coelacanth (Latimeria) represents the most
basal lineage of living sarcopterygians. Its species diversity
is considered to have remained low within its long time of
existence of at least 360 million years [19], with a certain
peak of species abundance in the Triassic and Jurassic
eras. Concomitant with this reduced species divergence,
its morphology has remained almost unchanged [20].
Latimeria possesses structures such as the intercranial
joint that are otherwise known only from long-extinct vertebrates. The vertebral column is poorly developed, and
the notochord is retained in adults seemingly serving as

the principal axial skeleton [21]. Thus, the few morphological changes may be reflected in its ancestral type genetic
makeup. Previous studies are in good agreement with this
view. The characterization of the Latimeria HOX cluster
[22] and procadherin gene cluster [23] provide evidence of
the slow evolution of the Latimeria genome and conserved
noncoding DNA. The orthologous Otx2 enhancers FM
and AM [24] and the HoxC8 early enhancer [25] revealed
strong conservation in DNA sequence and in enhancer
expression in mouse transgenic experiments.
To study the evolution of the regulatory architecture of
a developmental gene, sonic hedgehog (shh) provides a
good candidate. The shh gene encodes a morphogen that
directs many developmental processes in vertebrates
[26-28]. The transcriptional regulation of shh is tightly
regulated, and its expression in the embryonic midline is
specific to the ventral neural tube and the notochord.
Those shh tissue-specific expression domains are conserved in a wide range of vertebrate species such as in
mouse and zebrafish [26,27] but also in the agnathan
lamprey [29] and chondrichthyan dogfish [30]. The cisregulatory regions that regulate shh expression in the
central nervous system and the notochord have been
mapped extensively in several species and have been
functionally characterized in mouse and zebrafish
[31-40]. Thus, shh represents an ideal gene locus for a
detailed examination of cis-regulatory sequence conservation in the context of the slow genome sequence evolution and the ancient type morphology of the coelacanth.
In our report, we demonstrate that the Latimeria
menadoensis shh locus contains all conserved proximal
enhancers shared nonuniformly by fishes and land vertebrates. We provide experimental verification for enhancer activity of the putative Latimeria enhancers in
transgenic zebrafish and electroporated chick embryos.
From DNA sequence comparison of the shh locus of
different vertebrate lineages, we infer that Latimeria
conserved noncoding elements represent the ancestral
gnathostome set of enhancers that diverged variably
during vertebrate evolution.

encompasses the shh genomic region, spanning from
8 kb upstream to 12 kb downstream of the predicted
shh start codon [GenBank accession number FJ603040].
Repetitive DNA and interspersed elements made it difficult to align the entire BAC clone sequence in a single
contig, and correct assembly was verified for the 20-kb
region by PCR amplifications. The shh coding portion
was deduced from DNA sequence comparisons to
mouse and chick shh. Phylogeny reconstruction with
shh coding sequences of higher vertebrate species indicated that indeed the Latimeria shh orthologous gene
had been sequenced (Figure 1).
We identified the homologous conserved sequences in
the Latimeria menadoensis shh genomic region that
were identified previously in various lobe-finned and
ray-finned vertebrates [42-45]. Several noncoding conserved sequences were detected in intronic and
upstream regions of shh, and the distribution and frequency of these conserved blocks followed recognizable
patterns. They overlap with the previously characterized
enhancer regions of zebrafish and mouse (Figure 2a).
An upstream enhancer, SFPE1, directs shh floorplate
expression in mouse. Two other enhancers within intron
2, SBE1 and SFPE2, drive shh expression in the ventral
brain and notochord [32,36]. In zebrafish, the enhancers
ar-A and ar-B in intron 1 and ar-C in intron 2 mediate
shh expression in the notochord and the ventral neural
tube. Both ar-A and ar-C predominantly mediate

Results
Isolation of the Latimeria sonic hedgehog locus

Three variants of hedgehog exon 2 [GenBank accession
numbers FJ603041, FJ603042 and FJ603043] sequences
were obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from
genomic DNA of Latimeria chalumnae using degenerate
primers. The shh-specific paralog was deduced from
DNA sequence comparisons and used as a probe to
screen a Latimeria menadoensis BAC (Bacterial Artificial
Chromosome) library [41]. The BAC clone 123-O2 was
shotgun sequenced, and approximately 1200 sequence
reads resulted in a 5X DNA coverage of the BAC clone.
After assembly, a 20-kb contig was obtained that

Overall Conservation of CNE. Histograms present sum lengths of DNA sequence conservation in the shh genomic region from pairwise

enhancer to the shh 3’ end). Alignments were established with mLAGAN, conservation parameters for CNE identification were set as: Min Y: 50,

notochord expression, while ar-B predominantly directs
shh expression in the floorplate [33,40].
The intronic enhancer ar-A is well conserved in all
analyzed sequences. A second peak of conservation
upstream of the Latimeria shh gene was detected to correspond to the enhancer ar-D in zebrafish or SFPE1 in
mouse. Conservation of this region among Latimeria
and other sarcopterygians was detected in a region of
approximately 300 bp, which expanded conservation to
zebrafish ar-D by 50 bp at the 5- and 150 bp at the 3
end (Additional file 1). Furthermore, the ar-D enhancer
is not conserved in pufferfishes (e.g., Takifugu rubripes)
and medaka (Oryzias latipes). The third peak of conserved sequence found in Latimeria is the region corresponding to ar-B, a floorplate-specific enhancer in
zebrafish. It showed similarity with actinopterygian and
with marsupial species, but with none of the other

sarcopterygians for which genomic data are available.
This result suggests that the ar-B enhancer has been
lost independently in the different tetrapod lineages. In
opossum, the sequence that retains ar-B conservation is
interrupted with approximately 230 bp of repetitive
DNA. The 5- part of this conservation is further conserved in shh loci of placental mammalian species, such
as human (Additional file 2). It forms part of a diverged
mammalian-specific CNE that vice versa is only rudimentarily conserved in Latimeria.
In summary, Latimeria has retained conservation of
all four putative enhancers that were previously
described in the actinopterygian zebrafish. A fourth
region with CNE was detected in the second intron.
This is the region corresponding to ar-C in zebrafish
(and SFPE2 enhancer in mouse). This region was previously shown to be strongly conserved in Latimeria

factor, and a FoxA2 element was also shown to be functional in the mouse SFPE2 enhancer [36].
Finally, we examined the rates of divergence within
conserved shh enhancer sequences among sarcopterygian species with the relative rate test [51]. This test
estimates different rates of DNA sequence diversification
between two lineages by comparing them to an outgroup sequence. The DNA sequence alignments were
obtained from partial enhancer regions that were found
in all analyzed species (Table 1, Additional file 4). We
used either Latimeria or zebrafish as outgroup
sequences. Congruent to the overall conservation, the
mammalian enhancer sequences showed elevated rates
of divergence compared to chick or Latimeria, with
opossum putative enhancer sequences at intermediate
rates and the placental mammalian species at highest
rates (Table 1). In conclusion, all CNEs that were previously identified either in mouse or in zebrafish are
present in Latimeria and thus are candidate enhancers
of shh expression in the Latimeria embryonic midline.

[34]. Therefore, all four enhancers must have evolved
before the split between the lobe-finned and ray-finned
fish lineages.
Overall conservation of noncoding DNA was estimated to get a more quantitative measure of shh CNE
in the different lineages. We calculated the sum lengths
of CNE from pairwise comparisons of two shh genomic
regions, spanning from the SFPE1/ar-D upstream
enhancer to the shh 3’-UTR (Figure 2b). As no conservation was found to ar-D in medaka and fugu, for
further analysis, the 5’ limit of teleost shh genomic
regions was defined to be a teleost-specific CNE further
upstream (Additional file 3). Notably, Latimeria shows
the highest sequence similarity with chick among vertebrates. Conservation is comparatively high with opossum but remarkably reduced when compared to mouse
and human. Compared to actinopterygian species, sarcopterygian shh genomic regions share more CNE relative to their phylogenetic distance [46-48].
Conserved Latimeria enhancer sequences were analyzed for putative transcription factor binding sites using
the JASPAR CORE vertebrata database [49] (Additional
file 1). Binding motifs of those transcription factors
were searched, which are known to be expressed in the
neural tube, especially the floorplate [36,50]. Several elements were found, such as homeobox or IRX elements,
and we detected putative FoxA2 binding sites in the arA and ar-D enhancer. The ar-D FoxA2 putative binding
site was only conserved among sarcopterygians but not
in zebrafish. FoxA2 is a floorplate-specific transcription

Functional mapping of orthologous enhancers

The enhancers ar-A, ar-B and ar-C of zebrafish and the
SBE1, SFPE1 and SFPE2 of mouse shh were mapped by
functional analysis to overlap exactly with conserved
noncoding sequences [32-34,36,40,43,44]. However, the
SFPE1 orthologous enhancer in zebrafish, denoted as
ar-D, is a 2.4-kb fragment that is too large to suggest
that the CNE within contains the functional enhancer.
The fine mapping of the zebrafish ar-D enhancer was

carried out to confirm that the conserved zebrafish ar-D
sequence is reponsible for the enhancer effect in the
2.4-kb fragment. This would improve the predictive
value of this CNE in predicting a Latimeria enhancer.
Five partially overlapping DNA fragments of 500 bp or
700 bp were coinjected with a minimal 0.8-kb shh
promoter construct [31] linked to a LacZ reporter
(Additional file 5). Weak activation of notochord and
floorplate expression was observed for fragments that
represent the shh 2.5- to 1.5-kb upstream region (fragments 2-5). The expression was not considerably higher
than background staining and was probably originated
from the 0.8-kb proximal shh promoter. Specific reporter gene expression in the anterior floorplate (anterior
to the level of the yolk extension) was observed for
DNA fragment 1, ranging from position -836 to -1339.
The region that is responsible for the ar-D enhancer
effect overlaps fully with a CNE that is present in all the
other compared sarcopterygian sequences (Figure 2a).
This region is further part of the mouse SFPE-1 enhancer. We thus postulated that this CNE would also function as a specific enhancer in Latimeria.
To check whether the Latimeria conserved noncoding
sequences had enhancer activity, reporter gene expression analysis was conducted in transient transgenic zebrafish embryos. This analysis had already been carried
out with Latimeria ar-C in a previous study [34], and the
aim here was to analyze other conserved regulatory
regions that potentially drive shh midline expression.
Conserved noncoding elements of Latimeria shh intron 1
located between exon 1 and the intronic enhancer ar-A
did not drive specific reporter gene expression (data not
shown). Latimeria putative enhancer orthologs ar-D, arA and ar-B were cloned into the above-mentioned shh
minimal promoter constructs, containing GFP (Green
Fluorescent Protein) instead of a LacZ reporter. Transient mosaic expression of GFP was measured as read out
of reporter construct activity 24 hours after injection of
zebrafish zygotes (Figure 3). The reporter expression
directed by the zebrafish shh upstream region resembled
the tissue-specific expression of the isolated ar-D enhancer (Additional file 5). GFP expression was observed in
the ventral brain and in the anterior parts of the floorplate (data not shown) [33,40]. Similarly, Latimeria ar-D
also directed floorplate-specific GFP expression (Figure
3b). However, the reporter expression was extended to
the posterior parts of the floorplate. Among GFP-expressing embryos, fluorescence in the posterior floorplate
cells (posterior to the start of the yolk extension) was
detected in only 4% of specimens with the zebrafish
upstream region but in 75% of corresponding embryos
with Latimeria ar-D (Table 2). These results indicate that
the CNE in the Latimeria upstream region is a functional
midline enhancer which has similar but not identical

activity in zebrafish to the zebrafish ar-D enhancer. On
the basis of our DNA sequence comparison, Latimeria
ar-D was found to contain sarcopterygian specific
sequences with a puative FoxA2 element (92% match).
Potentially, these elements can account for the posteriorly extended expression direction of Latimeria ar-D in
the ventral neural tube of zebrafish.
The Latimeria conserved sequence that overlaps with
the zebrafish ar-A enhancer drives specific expression in
the notochord indistinguishable to the activity of zebrafish
ar-A (Figure 3c). This result indicates that Latimeria
indeed carries a functional ar-A enhancer. However, no
activity could be detected from the Latimeria ar-B orthologous fragment when the conserved region alone or a
broader region of 888 bp were tested at 24 hpf and 48 hpf
(hours post fertilization) (Figure 3d and data not shown).
Since a Latimeria ar-B enhancer may have diverged from
that in zebrafish, a sarcopterygian model system was chosen to test putative Latimeria enhancer function. Latimeria ar-B enhancer activity was tested in chick, which is
evolutionarily more closely related to Latimeria than zebrafish and shows higher overall noncoding DNA sequence
similarity with Latimeria. This might also imply higher
conservation of cis- and trans-interactions. Besides, the arD enhancer was also tested for reporter expression activity
in chick. Since Latimeria ar-D directed posterior floorplate
expression in zebrafish, the question arose whether this
anteroposterior restricted pattern of activity is due to a
zebrafish-specific trans-effect or if it is a more general
response also seen in chick. As many transcription factors
are supposed to have pleiotropic functions [13], the transacting factors may thus evolve independently to responsive
cis-regulatory regions. In this case, trans-factors may be
present in the chick neural tube, although the ar-B enhancer itself is absent in that species.
The previously described Latimeria ar-B and ar-D gfpreporter constructs were electroporated either in the hindbrain or in the spinal cord of chick embryos. GFP reporter
gene expression was compared to control electroporations
with the zebrafish 0.8-kb shh promoter construct, carried
out in parallel. We also carried out another control experiment with the construct -2.4shh:gfpABC [33]. This plasmid contains regulatory regions equivalent to plasmid I1
+I2-2.2shh::lacZ characterized by Müller et al. (2000) [52]
and was shown to be specifically expressed in the floorplate of the chick neural tube (Figure 4, Table 3). Weak or
no background GFP expression in the spinal cord was
detected with the 0.8-kb shh control plasmid. Electroporation with the Latimeria ar-B enhancer resulted in significantly enhanced GFP expression. However, the expression
pattern was not specific to the ventral neural tube. This
result suggests that the Latimeria ar-B sequences carry
enhancer activity but are either not restricted to the ventral neural tube or are interpreted in a nonspecific fashion

in chick. The Latimeria-arD enhancer directed tissuespecific GFP expression in the floorplate, both in hindbrain and in the posterior spinal cord. This result is similar
to those observed in transient transgenic zebrafish
(Figure 3b).
Summarizing, only the predicted Latimeria conserved
enhancers ar-D and ar-A were found to be functional in
zebrafish. The Latimeria ar-B enhancer was providing
unspecific enhancement of GFP expression in chick,
both in the hindbrain and in the posterior neural tube.

These results suggest that all three regions are functional enhancers in Latimeria, albeit that experimental
verification in Latimeria is currently not feasible.

Latimeria shh. Several previous studies with Latimeria
enhancers of different loci or genomic regions are in
agreement with this interpretation. The analysis of the
Latimeria procadherin gene clusters [23] described the
Latimeria genome as being very stable and having suffered very little from diversifications such as gene duplications or gene conversion events. The characterization
of Latimeria HOX clusters revealed a consistently
slower diversification of Latimeria CNE with repsect to
tetrapods [22]. The Latimeria orthologous Otx2 enhancers FM and AM [24] as well as the HoxC8 early enhancer [25] revealed strong DNA sequence conservation
across vertebrates. Otx2 enhancer expression direction
was similar to that obtained with skate orthologs, and
the HoxC8 early enhancer was described to direct gene
expression in mouse, similar to the mouse ortholog.
Our study extends the observations cited above to the
characterization of a set of proximal regulatory modules
within a locus. With availability of the Latimeria genome sequence, a more comprehensive comparative
genomic analysis should be possible with a multitude of
developmental regulator genes. Such an approach may
also reveal how far conservation of cis-regulatory regions
at developmental regulator genes is related to its ancient
type morphology.
Conservation of the four enhancers ar-A, ar-B, ar-C
and ar-D in Latimeria and zebrafish reveals preservation
of an ancestral set of enhancers that originated before
the split between ray-finned and lobe-finned vertebrates
(Figure 5). Lineage-specific losses of ar-D and ar-B are
observed in more derived species. Those are likely structural enhancer rearrangements that display a functional
turnover within a cooperating system [33] of cis-regulatory regions at the shh locus.
So far, there is not enough data available on shh proximal genomic regions of ancestral gnathostomes (represented by chondrichthyes such as sharks). However,
there is reason to speculate that the intronic and
upstream enhancers are potentially present in such species. Embryonic expression of shh in the embryonic
midline has been shown to be strongly conserved in

distantly related vertebrate species such as lamprey [29]
or dogfish [30].
The analysis of total conservation of CNE (Figure 2b)
in the shh orthologous genomic regions indicates interesting trends in the conservation of CNE across actinopterygian and sarcopterygian species. A lower overall
conservation is observed among teleost species. Less
conservation of noncoding DNA in teleost lineages has
also been reported previously in DNA sequence comparisons of vertebrate Hox clusters [53], which was
related to the fish-specific genome duplication [54].
Among sarcopterygians, we found an elevated similarity
of CNE between Latimeria and chick and lower conservation to the mammalian sequences. It indicates that
the shh genomic region has stayed remotely constrained
across sarcopterygian evolution but has more recently
diversified in the mammalian lineage. Comparisons of
the conserved blocks of the enhancers ar-A, ar-C and
SFPE1/ar-D by relative rate tests [51] are in line with
this interpretation. Mammalian orthologs show substantially more diversification than chick or Latimeria. Likewise, the mouse ar-C orthologous enhancer SFPE2 is
floorplate-specific and has been reported to be inactive
in transgenic zebrafish [34]. Chick and Latimeria orthologs [34] showed notochord specific expression, similar
to the zebrafish ortholog [32,34,40].
Expression specificity of Latimeria and zebrafish
orthologous enhancers

The analysis of expression of putative Latimeria orthologous enhancers in transgenic zebrafish and chick provided confirmation of functionality, though it cannot
definitively corroborate the endogenous tissue specificity
in Latimeria. Although similar, there are qualitative differences in expression patterns generated by the Latimeria ar-D sequence and the 2.4-kb zebrafish shh
upstream region that contained the ar-D enhancer. This
region directed expression in anterior parts of the floorplate and the ventral brain. The expression of the Latimeria ar-D enhancer in the posterior floorplate can

conserved among sarcopterygians (Additional file 1).
Those regions can contain elements, such as the the
putative FoxA2 binding site, which are bound by floorplate-specific transcription factors. A FoxA2 binding site
was previously shown to be functional in the mouse

floorplate-specific enhancer SFPE2 [36] and the mouse
ar-D orthologous enhancer (SFPE1), characterized in
mouse, also revealed to drive reporter gene expression in
posterior parts of the floorplate [32]. However, as these
regions were analyzed in different model organisms,

these data may not fully be comparable. Also, the mouse
SFPE2 enhancer is inactive in zebrafish [34] but contains
a functional FoxA2 element. Thus, other elements may
be responsible or additionally required for posterior
floorplate expression of Latimeria ar-D. The subtle differences in reporter gene expression by orthologous
enhancers from different species have also been reported
previously and appear to be a common phenomenon
[24,33,34,36,55]. Divergent expression direction may possibly be explained by different binding site compositions
of the orthologous enhancers or differing transcription
factor availability and affinity to the same set of transcription factor binding sites among different species.
Similar to the observed changes in ar-D activity, Latimeria ar-B proved also to be differently interpreted in
zebrafish, compared to its zebrafish homolog. In the
transgenic reporter assays employed, Latimeria ar-B did
not drive reporter gene expression in zebrafish. However, an unspecific activation of GFP expression by Latimeria ar-B was observed in chick embryos. This
suggests that ar-B is a functional cis-regulatory region in
the first place. The lack of tissue-specific expression
might simply reflect different interpretations of ar-B
enhancer elements in zebrafish, chick and Latimeria.
We observed conserved sequences among teleost species
that map zebrafish ar-B but that are not present in Latimeria (Additional file 1). Those regions may be required
to obtain specific reporter gene expression. Again,
changes in transcription factor binding site composition
and transcription factor availability and affinity can
result in reduced responsiveness of the reporter system
applied in different species. Alternatively, Latimeria ar-B
might require the cooperation with other enhancers for
tissue-specific activity. As zebrafish shh floorplate
enhancers cooperate with each other [33], there might
be a balancing gain and loss of enhancer functions
among the complete set of shh midline enhancers that
together preserve the tissue-specific activity. Similarly,
shh and twhh reporter constructs showed ectopic activity when a limited number of enhancers were assayed
out of context of additional enhancers [33,56]. Following
this speculation, the loss of tissue-specific activity of one
enhancer might be complemented by a gain of tissue
specificity through synergism with another enhancer.

Keeping in mind the limitations, cross-species reporter
analysis remains the only approach to obtain expression
data of Latimeria cis-regulatory elements.
An open question that has not been addressed in this
study is whether Latimeria carries orthologous putative
shh long-range enhancers. A CRM that regulates shh
limb bud expression is located 1 mb away from mouse
shh within the lmbr1 locus. This enhancer was found to
be conserved in most vertebrate lineages, including
chondricthyes [35,38,39,57-60]. Other shh long-range
enhancers have been detected, such as endoderm-specific enhancer elements [58] and the ventral forebrain
specific enhancer SBE2. This latter CRM is conserved
only in sarcopterygians and is located in humans at a
distance of 460 kb upstream of SHH [35,37]. A Latimeria genome project will therefore be immensely
useful in addressing the presence such long distance cisregulatory modules.

Conclusions
The Latimeria menadoensis shh genomic region represents a locus with the ancestral set of enhancers that
emerged before the split of lobe-finned and ray-finned
fishes. In contrast to more derived vertebrate lineages
that exhibit losses and rearrangements of shh enhancers,
Latimeria reveals low levels of enhancer sequence evolution and high overall conservation of noncoding DNA at
the shh proximal genomic region. The conserved cisregulatory architecture of this set of shh midline enhancer is consistent with slow rates of evolution of the
Latimeria genome. The high overall sequence conservation of shh CNE may be indicative of a high retention of
ancestral cis-regulatory DNA in the Latimeria genome.
Methods
Amplification of an ExonII specific probe of Latimeria
menadoensis

The DNA sequence of shh Exon II was amplified by
PCR from 100 ng of genomic DNA of Latimeria chalumnae using the oligonucleotides SHHE2F1:
CNATHTCNGTRATGAACCAGTGG and SHHE2R1:
CTGCTTTSACNGARCARTGDAT. The amplification
product was ligated into the PCRII vector (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), transformed, and single clones
from transformations were isolated and prepared. The
insert of each clone was sequenced using the primers
M13(-20) and M13(reverse) on an ABI PRISM 3100
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA), using the Big Dye Termination Reaction chemistry (Applied Biosystems). Suitable clone inserts were
used as DNA template for the preparation of a 233-bp
shh-specific 32P-labeled probe for BAC library screening.
32
P-labeling was achieved by random priming [61].

[46-48].

BAC library Screening and BAC-clone sequencing

The Latimaria menadoensis BAC library VMRC4 [41]
was screened for shh-specific BAC clones. One nylon filter set was hybridized overnight in 0.6 M NaCl, 0.02 M
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.2 M Tris pH
8.0, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 0.05%
sodium pyrophosphate at 65°C with the shh-specific
probe. The filters were washed twice with 1 × salinesodium citrate (SSC), 0.1% SDS, once for 30 minutes at
room temperature and once for 40 minutes at 37°C.
Three shh-positive BAC clones were isolated.
Large-scale BAC clone preparation was obtained with
the Large Construct Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A
total of 20 μg of BAC clone DNA in 500 μl TE (10 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA), pH 8.0, was fragmented by sonication (Branson Sonifier, Danbury, CT, USA) with 4 × 1second pulses at 300 W (5-mm microtip). The 2- to 3-kb
fraction was isolated from the sheared DNA by preparative gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments were endpolished with Klenow enzyme (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
and blunt-end ligated into pUC18 vector (Roche). Resulting bacterial clones from transformations were isolated
into 384-well plates and grown in 1 ml LB (Luria-Bertani)
broth (50 μg/ml ampicillin).

The subcloned BAC clone 123-O 2 was sequenced
using the shotgun approach. Clone plasmid DNA was
prepared manually. The inserts were sequenced directly
with the universal primers M13(-20) and M13(reverse)
as mentioned above. Sequences were quality trimmed
with PHRED [62] and assembled with the Sequencher
software (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). DNA contigs were aligned to vertebrate shh sequences and to
conserved noncoding elements of shh genomic regions,
obtained from the UCSC genome browser [63]. Contig
gaps were closed by PCR with gap-specific primers and
direct sequencing. Phylogeny reconstruction with shh
coding sequences was performed with RAxML [64].
Analysis of conserved noncoding sequences

The shh genomic regions of different vertebrate species
were extracted with the UCSC genome browser or
Ensembl genome browser (human SHH: hg18_dna range=chr7:155271852-155314196, mouse shh: mm8_dna

medaka shh: oryLat2_dna range=chr20: 1772801217784191, Fugu shh: combination of two sequences:
AJ507296.1 and fr1_dna range=chrUn:293195538293226682 (misassembly in the Fugu genome sequence
around shh exon1)). Annotations of genomic regions
were done manually by DNA sequence comparisons and
repetitive DNA was masked with repeatmasker [65]
using wublast, default speed/sensitivity, masking interspersed and simple repeats. Genomic regions were
aligned with the program Shuffle-LAGAN and alignments were visualized with the program VISTA
(mVISTA, [66]; LAGAN Alignment program, [67]. Conserved sequence blocks were also extracted using VISTA.
For relative rate tests, alignment blocks were determined as conserved sequences that are found in all
compared DNA sequences. Alignment blocks were
established with Dialign TX [68], and relative rate tests
were performed with MEGA4 [69].
Subcloning of enhancers and transgenic analysis

Latimeria shh enhancers were amplified by PCR from
BAC clone DNA using specific oligonucleotides (Additional file 6). The oligonucleotide pairs optionally contained the restriction sites SalI/PstI, NotI/SacII or NotI/
KpnI. PCR products were cloned into linearized plasmid
vectors 0.8-kb shh:GFP [31,34]. Microinjection solution
(10-20 ng/μl circular plasmid DNA and 0.1% phenol
red) was injected through the chorion into the cytoplasm of zebrafish zygotes. Transient mosaic expression
of GFP in 24-hours old embryos was analyzed using a
fluorescent stereomicroscope (Leica MZ FLIII, Leica
Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland).
The zebrafish ar-D enhancer and the Latimeria ar-G
fragment was characterized in coinjection experiments,
essentially as described in Müller et al. (1999) [40]. Analysis of 24 hours old embryos was then carried out as
described by Chang et al. (1997) [31]. Transient mosaic
expression was measured as readout of reporter construct
activity by counting b-Gal-stained cells. PCR-amplified
fragments of zebrafish shh upstream DNA regions were
obtained with specific oligonucleotides (Additional file 6).
In vivo experiments with chick embryos were
performed by in ovo electroporation. Eggs from WhiteLeghorn chickens were incubated at 38.5°C in an atmosphere of 70% humidity. Embryos were staged following
Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) [70]. Chick embryos
were electroporated with 2 mg/ml supercoiled plasmid
DNA with 50 ng/ml Fast Green. Electroporations were
carried out as performed by Müller et al. (2000) [52].
This method was previously shown to yield transfections
of dorsal, lateral and ventral cells of the spinal cord with
transfection bias in lateral regions [52]. Briefly, DNA
was injected into the dorsal lumen of HH stage 11-12
neural tubes at two different levels: hindbrain or spinal

cord. Electrodes were placed at both lateral sides
encompassing the dorsal and ventral extremes of the
neural tube. Electroporation was carried out in one
direction (shown on the right side of Figure 4) so that
the nonelectroporated half of the neural tube served as
a negative control. Electroporation was performed with
the Edit Type Cuy21 (Nepa Gene, Ichikawa, Chiba,
Japan) electroporator delivering eight 50-ms square
pulses of 10 V. Transfected embryos were allowed to
develop for 24 hours.
Chick embryos were fixed for 4 hours at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, rinsed, embedded in 5% agarose,
10% sucrose and sectioned in a Leica vibratome (VT
1000S, Leica Microsystems). Immunostaining was performed following standard procedures. Briefly, sections
were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS-T (1x PBS
(137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM
KH2PO4, pH 7.4), 0.1% Tween-20), incubated overnight
with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) and detected using an anti-rabbit Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Images
were collected by fluorescence microscopy.
