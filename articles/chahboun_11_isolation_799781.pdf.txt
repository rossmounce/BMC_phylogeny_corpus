Abstract
Background: Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A), mainly represented by subtype A1, is the most toxic substance
known. It causes naturally-occurring food poisoning, and is among the biological agents at the highest risk of being
weaponized. Several antibodies neutralizing BoNT/A by targeting its heavy chain (BoNT/A-H) have been isolated in the
past. For the first time however, an IgG (4LCA) recently isolated by hybridoma technology and targeting the BoNT/A
light chain (BoNT/A-L), was shown to inhibit BoNT/A endopeptidase activity and protect in vivo against BoNT/A. In the
present study, a phage-displayed library was constructed from a macaque (Macaca fascicularis) hyper-immunized with
BoNTA/L in order to isolate scFvs inhibiting BoNT/A endopeptidase activity for clinical use.
Results: Diversity of the scFvs constituting the library was limited due to the frequent presence, within the genes
intended to be part of the library, of restriction sites utilized for its construction. After screening with several
rounds of increasing stringency, as is usual with phage technology, the library got overwhelmed by phagemids
encoding incomplete scFvs. The screening was successfully re-performed with a single round of high stringency. In
particular, one of the isolated scFvs, 2H8, bound BoNT/A1 with a 3.3 nM affinity and effectively inhibited BoNT/A1
endopeptidase activity. The sequence encoding 2H8 was 88% identical to human germline genes and its average
G-score was -0.72, quantifying the high human-like quality of 2H8.
Conclusions: The presence of restrictions sites within many of the sequences that were to be part of the library
did not prevent the isolation of an scFv, 2H8, by an adapted panning strategy. ScFv 2H8 inhibited toxin
endopeptidase activity in vitro and possessed human-like quality required for clinical development. More generally,
the construction and screening of phage-displayed libraries built from hyper-immunized non-human primates is an
efficient solution to isolate antibody fragments with therapeutic potential.

Background
Clostridium botulinum, and certain other Clostridium
spp., secrete seven serotypes (A-G) of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). Three BoNTs (A, B and E) are mainly
responsible for human botulism, a disease occurring
naturally, in the form of food poisoning. Botulism is also

part of the A list of the six diseases at the highest risk of
being caused by bioweapons, according to the Center for
Disease Control [1]. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A) is
regarded as the most toxic substance on Earth and its
LD50 values are 1 ng/kg for the intravenous and subcutaneous routes, and 3 ng/kg by pulmonary route [2]. Botulinum toxins exert their toxicity by cleaving proteins that
constitute the intraneuronal SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor)
complex, which allows cholinergic vesicles to bind the
pre-synaptic membrane of neuromuscular synapses and
release their content. In particular, BoNT/A cleaves

SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa), due
to a zinc metalloprotease activity borne by its light chain
(BoNT/A-L). This proteolysis inhibits SNARE activity
and causes flaccid paralysis, including that of respiratory
muscles. Despite botulinum lethality, vaccination against
botulinum toxins is questionable because it would prevent the ever-increasing medical uses of BoNTs (for a
review of these uses, see [3]; for a discussion on the limits
of vaccination against botulinum toxins see [4]). At present, treatment against botulism consists of supportive
care and passive immunization with equine antitoxin [5],
which may however cause hypersensitivity and serum
sickness [6]. To avoid these side effects and increase their
half-life, particularly for prophylactic use, well-tolerated
antibodies are needed. These may be represented by
recombinant antibodies.
Antibodies neutralizing botulinum toxins generally target the heavy chains of these toxins, inhibiting toxin entry
into cells [7-14]. Recently however and for the first time,
an antibody directed against the light chain of botulinum
A (BoNT/A-L), the human IgG 4LCA isolated by hybridoma technology, was shown to neutralize the proteolytic
activity of BoNT/A in vitro and exhibited protective activity in vivo. Moreover, when 4LCA was administered in
conjunction with an antibody directed against the heavy
chain, both acted synergistically and showed increased
protective capacities [15]. A llama antibody also inhibiting
BoNT/A-Lc enzymatic activity was presented even more
recently, and its epitope was mapped to support the design
of synthetic inhibitors [16]. In the present study, we
describe the isolation of a human-like recombinant scFv
inhibiting BoNT/A endopeptidase activity in vitro, in the
perspective of its clinical development.
In previous studies, we have used immune phagedisplayed libraries originating from macaques (Macaca
fascicularis) to isolate antibody fragments of nanomolar or
picomolar affinities against tetanus toxin [17], the two
units of anthrax lethal toxin [18,19], ricin [20], and against
a surface antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus [21]. The choice
of non-human primates (NHPs) is based on the phylogenetic proximity between NHPs and humans. This choice
allows the isolation of fragments with human-like character, thus augmenting their therapeutic value. At a later
stage, the best NHP antibody fragments might be germline-humanized to obtain antibody fragments with a
higher percentage of identity with human germline
sequences than antibody fragments of human origin, thus
potentially better tolerated [22-24]. Another potential
advantage of our strategy is that we choose animals from
which, prior to the immunization, no DNA encoding antibody fragments are amplified so that the library is not
directed against non-relevant antigens, but rather exquisitely focused on the immunogen. From this “zero” point,
the immunization is conducted until a high titer is reached

and can not be increased with additional immunizations.
Such a response is defined as hyper-immune [25] and may
span over most, or all, epitopes with high-affinity antibodies. Because hyper-immune NHPs are used for the construction of our libraries, we have argued that they could
be referred to as “hyper-immune libraries” [26]. In the present study, the strategy of utilizing a hyper-immune NHP
library was chosen again. Diversity of the scFvs constituting this library was however limited by the frequent presence of NcoI and Hind III restriction sites within the
genes encoding scFvs and utilized for library construction.
After multi-step panning, phages displaying incomplete
scFvs overwhelmed the library. A single-round of panning
with high stringency was more successful and several fullsized scFvs were isolated, whose human-like character was
quantified. One of these scFvs inhibited the endopeptidase
activity of BoNT/A and may be proposed for clinical
development. This study exemplifies again the potential of
our strategy, and indicates how to solve difficulties similar
to the problem encountered here.

Results
Animal immunization, phage-displayed library
construction

The immunization utilized the non-toxic light chain of
botulinum A1 (BoNT/A1-L) as immunogen, but the
response was evaluated with an ELISA utilizing the whole
toxin (BoNT/A1) as capture antigen because BoNT/A1
better represents the agent to be neutralized in clinical
use. Ten days after the third injection, the ELISA titer was
measured as 1/100 000 and was anticipated to correspond
to an hyper-immune response. A fourth injection was
given to the macaque eight months after the third one
and, just before this, fourth injection, no PCR products
could be amplified from the bone marrow. At the sixth
and tenth days after this fourth injection however, the
amplification of genes coding VH and VL was very effective with all primers, and then the quantity of the amplified products decreased. On the tenth day, the titer was
measured again as 1/100 000, confirming that a stable,
hyper-immune, response had been reached. The genes
encoding VH and VL which had been amplified during
the sixth and tenth days were regarded as optimal. They
were pooled and cloned in pGemT for the construction of
 light chains and Fd sublibraries of 10 4 and 5 × 10 4
clones, respectively. Next, the scFv library was constructed
in pHAL14 by two consecutive cloning steps, starting with
the VL gene fragments and followed by the VH fragments.
The final scFv antibody gene library consisted of 3.3 × 108
independent clones, but with only 37% full size inserts as
determined by colony PCR. Twenty clones of the library
were sequenced prior to screening, and the BLAST analysis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) of these
sequences revealed that only seven of them corresponded

to full-sized scFvs. Partial sequences corresponded to
internal NcoI restriction sites in 8 of 20 VH gene fragments, plus a HindIII restriction site on one. The existence
of partial VH gene fragments, possibly corresponding to
recombination in 4 occurrences (data not shown), was
also observed. Despite this low rate of full-sized inserts
(7/20 or 35%), the immune library was packaged.
Isolation of scFvs directed against BoNT/A1

A single round of panning followed by forty washes, was
performed and resulted in the isolation of 2.4 × 104 clones.
Randomly chosen, 288 individual clones were grown in SB
medium, and culture supernatants were tested for binding
to BoNT/A1 by ELISA. Thirty nine positive clones expressing scFvs reacting with BoNT/A1 were isolated and the
corresponding DNA was sequenced. These 39 clones corresponded to 14 non-redundant, full-sized scFvs.
Affinity measurement

From the 14 clones selected previously, 10 scFvs were
efficiently expressed and purified before measuring their
affinities for BoNT/A. These scFvs had nanomolar affinities, from 1.52 nM (2A3) to 7.57 nM (3C6) (table 1),
with an average value of 3.9 nM.

IGKJ1 was dominant, again limiting VL diversity, except
for two occurrences of IGKJ3 and two occurrences of
IGKJ4. The germinality index (GI), indicating percent
identity between framework regions (FRs) of the selected
scFvs and those coded by their most similar human
germline genes, was calculated. It was averaged on VH
and VL for each scFv and ranged from 82% to 88%
(Table 2). The G-scores, another indirect way to predict
tolerance but based on a comparison with somatic
(expressed) genes, ranged from -2.689 to 0.518 (Table 3).
Enzymatic assays

In a preliminary assay, 2H8 was the only scFv to present
a distinct level of endopeptidase inhibition while all
other clones showed almost no inhibition of proteolysis,
comparable to that of the negative controls, scFvs
43RCA and 38RCA directed against ricin. Consequently,
2H8 was more precisely evaluated for its inhibition
capacity (Figure 1) in a second experiment, in which a
concentration of 2H8 equal to 0.5 μg/ml (18.5 nanomolar) inhibited 50% of the endopeptidase activity of 43.5
pg/ml of BoNT/A1 (0.29 picomolar). Inhibition of 50%
of the endopeptidase activity thus corresponded to a
molar ratio of antigen binding sites/antigen (2H8:BoNT/
A1) of 64,000:1 (0.0185 10-6:0.29 10-12).

Computational analysis

Analysis of the genes encoding the 10 scFvs indicated a
high diversity of the VH sequences, despite the loss of
diversity due to panning and presence of the NcoI and
HindIII sites. All IGHV genes were represented, except
for IGHV2, combined with representatives of all IGHD
genes except for IGHD4 (Table 2). These genes were
only combined with representatives of IGHJ4 and IGHJ5
but, as these genes only encode the last part of CDR3
and FR4, this limited diversity of the J genes was not
expected to severely impact diversity of the VH paratopes. Diversity of the VL part of the paratope was however smaller with only IGKV1 being represented but for
one occurrence of IGKV3 and one occurrence of IGKV4.

Discussion
Botulinum toxins (BoNT) are the most poisonous substances on Earth, and botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A)
is the most potent. In a broad study, sixty six genes
encoding BoNT/A were studied [27] and subtype 1 was
encountered on 54 occurrences, with the remaining
strains scattered among 3 other subtypes. This study thus
focused on the most prevalent BoNT/A subtype, A1. We
targeted its light chain (BoNT/A1-L) because several
antibodies targeting the heavy chain, and inhibiting toxin
entry into cells, have already been isolated [7-14]. The
description of BoNT/A neutralization by targeting
BoNT/A-L and inhibiting its endopeptidase activity is
fairly recent, and to date only one human (4LCA) and
one llama (Aa1) antibody with this capacity have been
isolated [15,16]. In confocal microscopy, signals corresponding to 4LCA co-localized in cells with signals corresponding to BoNT/A, representing direct evidence that
4LCA did not act by preventing BoNT/A internalization
and that 4LCA was internalized for neutralization [15].
Also, the structure of Aa1 complexed with BoNT/A-L,
and the epitope of Aa1 on BoNT/A-L, was determined
by crystallography [16]. Inhibition of endopeptidase activity by antibodies directed against the light chain of
BoNT/A is thus thought to mainly depend on their direct
interaction, initiated outside of the cells but persisting
within. Such a mechanism of inhibition has the advantage
that it may be activated after entry of the toxin in the

cells so that antibodies with this activity might be proposed for re-formatting as transbodies or intrabodies
[28], which would enter cells even if not complexed with
the toxin and thus would be usable after a longer delay
than antibodies that prevent toxin cell entry. In addition,
one may anticipate that an antibody inhibiting endopeptidase activity may also have other protective mechanisms
in vivo, such as promoting toxin clearance by recruitment

The human-like character of the 10 selected scFvs was evaluated through the
calculation of G-scores, to indirectly predict their immunogenicity.

of immune effectors [29]. For these reasons, it was
decided to isolate an antibody fragment inhibiting BoNT/
A1-L endopeptidase activity, in anticipation of its protective capacity and potential clinical development.
The present library was constructed as previously
described [18,19,21] to yield high affinity-scFvs [17] due to
its hyper-immune nature [30], corresponding to the
hyper-immune response from which this library was built.
Non-toxic BoNT/A1-L was utilized for immunization but
complete BoNT/A1 was preferred as antigen for ELISAs,
panning, affinity measurements and endopeptidase assay
as the present study aimed at isolating scFvs that bind to
BoNT/A1-L but as part of BoNT/A1, the toxin to be neutralized. After library construction however, internal controls showed an unusually low rate of inserts (37%), which
was confirmed by sequencing as almost half (8/20) of
inserts presented an internal NcoI restriction site. An HindIII internal restriction site was also observed, plus partial
sequences probably caused by recombination, so that only
35% (7/20) of scFv sequences were full-length. Former
macaque immune libraries [19-21] did not exhibit this rate
of partial VH gene fragments as apparently, a higher rate
of VH gene fragments with NcoI restriction sites was
employed by the immune response against BoNT/A1-L
compared to all former immunizations. Notwithstanding,
the constructed library was screened using a traditional
protocol consisting of successive rounds of panning, with
increasing stringency due to an increasing number of
washing steps between rounds. After the first round, with
5 washing steps, the presence of full-sized inserts further
decreased. This decrease was due to the library being overwhelmed by plasmids carrying partial-sized inserts or no
insert at all, which replicate more rapidly and this preferred replication had not been counterbalanced by the
selection applied during the first round of panning. After
the second round, with 10 washing steps, scFvs with

Figure 1 Neutralisation of 10LD50/ml BoNT/A with scFv 2H8. 2H8 reacted with BoNT/A1 (43.5 pg/ml; 10 LD50/ml) and showed dose dependent
inhibition of endopeptidase activity in vitro. The negative controls (43RCA and 38RCA), directed against ricin toxin, showed no inhibition at equivalent
protein concentration. Results are mean with range (n = 2). BoNT A1 toxin control (10 LD50/ml): broken line. Buffer control: dotted line.

partially- and full-sized inserts were completely lost and
the panning was thus unsuccessful. However, it was anticipated that NHP hyper-immune libraries do not absolutely
need multi-step panning, in contrast to naïve libraries
where scFvs of interest are rare, so that it was decided to
adapt the panning strategy and use only a single round of
panning, similar to other studies [31-33]. A high stringency, in the form of 40 washes, was chosen for this single
round because it was required to counterbalance the preferred replication of phages with incomplete, or no, scFvs.
Also, it was expected that scFvs of interest, present in the
library, would have a high affinity and thus would be
retained even after 40 washing steps. This single-round
panning allowed the elution of clones, of which two hundred and eighty eight were randomly hand-picked and
small-scale expression of scFvs was induced. The supernatants were tested in ELISA for their reactivity against
BoNT/A1 and thirty nine scFvs were rated as positive.
The numerous negative supernatants could correspond to
plasmids carrying no or partial inserts and again beginning
to overwhelm the library, to scFvs with weak affinities or
to scFvs having a low expression level in this format. After

sequencing these thirty nine positive clones, fourteen
full-sized, non redundant scFvs were isolated. Of these
fourteen, ten were expressed and purified in quantities sufficient for further evaluation. The sequencing of these ten
scFvs showed a high level of diversity, most particularly in
the VH region. Given that diversity, it was expected that
these ten scFvs might target different epitopes and perhaps
inhibit endopeptidase activity. This was the case for only
one of them, 2H8, which bound the BoNT/A1 holotoxin
with high affinity (3.3 nM) and inhibited SNAP25 cleavage.
The inhibition capacity of 2H8 might be compared to that
of the only two antibodies with similar activities, previously published. The molar ratio of antibody to toxin
(antibody:toxin), at which 50% inhibition of endopeptidase
activity is observed, is the best parameter to evaluate an
inhibiting activity as this ratio is independent of toxin and
antibody quantities utilized in the test. In a previous study,
the IgG 4LCA was tested in an in vitro endopeptidase
assay but at a single dose, allowing 63% reduction of
BoNT/A endopeptidase activity [15]. This dose corresponded to a 10,000:1 molar ratio (antigen binding sites of
IgG 4LCA:BoNT/A), which is comparable to the 64,000:1

Chahboun et al. BMC Biotechnology 2011, 11:113
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/113

molar ratio observed when 2H8 inhibited 50% of the
BoNT/A endopeptidase activity. In effect, scFv 2H8 has a
smaller steric hindrance than an IgG thus the expression of
2H8 as an IgG should lower that ratio. In another study,
the llama antibody Aa1 inhibited 50% of BoNT/A-L endopeptidase activity at a 200:1 molar ratio (Aa1:BoNT/A-L)
[16]. However, it should be noted that Aa1 was tested only
against the BoNT/A light chain (BoNT/A-L) and not the
whole toxin. In the view of clinical development, such a test
is less realistic than an evaluation utilizing BoNT/A, as was
performed with 4LCA and with 2H8.
The G-score of a variable domain (VH or VL) characterizes the human-like character, or humanness, of this
domain. Assuming a high level of humaness corresponds
to a high degree of tolerance in clinical use, as is generally
accepted [34-36], the G-score parameter indirectly predicts tolerance of the variable domains it characterizes.
Here, the G-score of 2H8 VL (-0.901) corresponds to a VL
that is “as human” (as similar to human VLs) as 19% of
the human VLs present in the Kabat database. Similarly,
its VH, with a G-score equal to -0.530, is “as human” (as
similar to human VHs) as 29% of human VHs. For both
V-regions, these similarities testify for the human-like
character of 2H8 and predict good tolerance in clinical
use. Another way to evaluate the immunogenicity of 2H8
is to calculate the identity level of its FRs with its most
similar, human, germline-encoded FRs. This identity level,
also called germinality index (GI) [18], indirectly predicts
the tolerance of any given VH or VL sequence based on
the theoretical assumption that germline-encoded
sequences are best tolerated, as they are part of the
“immunological self”. The GI value of 2H8 is equal to
88%, thus high. For instance, this value is identical to the
GI value of another macaque antibody fragment, 35PA83
[18], which was germline-humanized up to a GI of 97.8%
[22]. This last GI value corresponded to only four macaque residues that had to be left after the humanization
process, with the rest of the FRs encoded by germline
genes. Only two of these four residues were exposed to
solvent, and thus unlikely to raise any immune response in
humans. Based on the GI identity of 2H8 with 35PA83,
success of germline-humanization of 2H8 may be anticipated. Overall, the sequence analysis of 2H8 by G-score
and GI quantifies the human-like character of 2H8, and
predicts its good tolerance. To suppress any risk of immunogenicity however, germline-humanization of 2H8 is
recommended as it should be as successful as a germlinehumanization, presented formerly [22].

Conclusion
In the present study, scFv 2H8, directed against the light
chain of botulinum toxin A, was isolated. It presented
an inhibition capacity and human-like qualities required
for clinical development. ScFv 2H8 was isolated despite

Page 6 of 9

the presence of restriction sites utilized for library construction within the genes encoding the scFv intended
to be part of the library, using an adapted single-round
panning strategy. This result exemplifies the efficiency
of phage-displayed libraries built from immunized nonhuman primate to isolate antibody fragments with therapeutic potential.

Animal immunization

Four subcutaneous injections of the botulinum neurotoxin light chain A1 (BoNT/A1-L) (Metabiologics Inc.,
Madison, Wi, USA) were administered with a one
month-interval, except for the fourth injection given with
an eight-month interval, to a male cynomolgus macaque
(Macaca fascicularis). The first injection consisted of 80
μg of the light chain of BoNT/A mixed with complete
Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma, Isle d’Abeau, France) and for
the remaining injections, incomplete Freund’s adjuvant
was used.
Construction of the anti-BoNT/A1-L antibody library

RNA was isolated from the bone marrow using Tri
Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc, Cincinnati,
USA), and was retro-amplified. Seven primers were used
to amplify DNA encoding  light chains, and nine primers were used to amplify of DNA encoding Fd fragments of the g chain [30]. To obtain two sub-libraries
encoding these light chains or Fd fragment, the corresponding PCR products were pooled and subcloned in
the pGemT vector (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin).
Later, these PCR products were reamplified as DNA
encoding the VL (variable region of the light chain) or
VH (variable region of the heavy chain) regions only,
with two oligonucleotide primer sets introducing restriction sites as described elsewhere [30]. During the first
step of the library construction, the VL fragments were
inserted into pHAL14 [21,37,38], and then the VH fragments were inserted into pHAL14 containing the VL
repertoire. For this, the pHAL14 vector and the VL

Chahboun et al. BMC Biotechnology 2011, 11:113
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/113

fragments were digested with MluI and NotI (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany), the enzymes were
inactivated, pHAL14 was dephosphorylated using calf
intestinal phosphatase (MBI Fermentas), and the DNA
was purified. VL PCR products (270 ng) were inserted
into 1 μg of the dephosporylated pHAL14 preparation in
four separate ligation reactions. DNA was precipitated
from the reaction mixes with ethanol and sodium acetate,
the pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol, and then
four aliquots (25 μl) of XL1-Blue MRF’ (Stratagene,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were used for electroporation. Plasmids (the VL library) were isolated using a Plasmid Midi Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The VL
library and the VH fragments were digested with NcoI
and HindIII (New England Biolabs), and ligation and
electroporation were then performed as described for VL.
The library was packaged using hyperphages [39,40].
Screening of the library against BoNT/A1

A plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Danemark) was coated with holotoxin BoNT/A1 (Metabiologics, Madison, Wisconsin) at a
concentration of 20 μg/ml in PBS (ON, 4°C). The plate
was then saturated with TBS/BSA 3% (2 hours, 37°C) and
phages were incubated (2 hours, 37°C) in the wells. One
single round of panning composed of forty washes was
then performed using TBS/Tween 0.1% as the washing
buffer, with an interval of 5 min between each wash [41].
The plate was finally rinsed with sterile TBS and the
phages were eluted with trypsin (10 mg/ml in TBS, incubated at 37°C, 30 min). The eluted phages were used for
infecting E. coli (SURE strain, Stratagene) previously cultured in SB (Super Broth) medium supplemented with tetracycline (10 μg/ml). Infected E. coli were later grown in
Petri dishes (ON, 37°C).
ScFv production and purification, ELISA and affinity
measurements

ScFvs were expressed following a previously described
method [19] but purified on a His Trap column (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) using a Profinia automate (Biorad, Hercules, California), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purity was verified and scFvs were
quantified using capillary electrophoresis on an Experion
device (Biorad). For ELISA, plates were coated as for panning and the rest of the procedure was performed as previously described [19]. Affinities were measured by surface
plasmon resonance with a BIAcore X (General ElectricBiacore, Uppsala, Sweden) instrument. Holotoxin BoNT/
A1 was immobilized at a maximum of 800 resonance
units on a CM5 chip (General Electric-Biacore) via amine
coupling, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A
flow rate of 30 μl/min was maintained during measurements. For each measurement, a minimum of six scFv
dilutions (10 to 0.1 μg/ml) in HBS-EP buffer (General

Page 7 of 9

Electric-Biacore) were each tested for 1000 s. After each
scFv dilution, the chip was regenerated with glycine 1.5
(General Electric-Biacore), run at 10 μl/min for 30 s. Constants were calculated using the Biaevaluation software
(Biacore) [42] and were verified by internal consistency
tests [43].
DNA sequencing, sequence analysis

Twenty scFvs were isolated before panning and sequenced
by GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). Thirty nine scFvs
were isolated after panning and sequenced by Beckman
Coulter Genomics (Takeley, United Kingdom). Sequences
of the scFvs isolated after panning were compared with
human germline sequences, using the IMGT/V-QUEST
tool, available on-line from the International ImmunoGeneTics information system® (IMGT) (http://www.imgt.
org.) [22]. This tool finds the human germline sequences
most similar to any given variable region and also calculates its Germinality Index (GI), defined as the percent
identity between its FRs and those encoded by its most
similar human germline sequences. Human germline
genes encode proteins belonging to the “immunological
self”, thus the GI evaluates the degree of identity of any
given variable region with the human “immunological self”
to indirectly quantify its immunogenicity [22]. For the
time being however, there is no benchmark regarding GI
of human antibodies. This is in contrast with G-score,
which evaluates the percentage of identity of any given
VH or VL with all human expressed VH or VL, respectively, belonging to the same family and present in the latest release of the Kabat database. G-score is also available
on line (http://www.bioinf.org.uk) to predict potential
immunogenicity, indirectly but by comparison with
somatic, not germline, sequences. It is an evolution from
the former H-score (originally called Z-score) [24,44]. The
G-score is zero for a VH or VL sequence having the same
identity level with its human counterparts than the average
identity level of human VH or VL sequences present in
Kabat’s database, respectively. Positive scores correspond
to higher than average identity level, and conversely for
negative scores.
Enzymatic assay

Previously published in vitro endopeptidase immuno-assay
for BoNT/A toxin [45] was modified and used to assess
inhibitory properties of the scFvs. In this assay, the curve
presenting ELISA signal as a function of BoNT/A endopeptidase activity has a linear part, utilized in the present
study, where a 50% signal decrease corresponds to a 50%
decrease in endopeptidase activity. Here, BoNT/A1 was
purchased from Metabiologics (lot # A062805-01 with
specific activity of 2.3 × 108 mouse i.p. LD50/mg). This
toxin preparation was diluted to a stock concentration of
87 pg/ml (20 LD50/ml) in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES,

Chahboun et al. BMC Biotechnology 2011, 11:113
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/113

20 μM ZnCl2, pH7.0, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, 5 mM DTT).
All scFvs were diluted to 10 μg/ml in reaction buffer and
150 μl was added to all wells in column 1 of a 96-well low
binding polypropylene plate (Nunc). 75 μl of reaction buffer was then added to all wells in columns position 2 to
11. Twofold dilutions of antibody samples were performed
across the plate, initiated by removing 75 μl from wells in
column 1 and completing by discarding 75 μl from wells
in position 11. The stock solution of BoNT/A (75 μl) was
added to all the wells to provide a final concentration of
43.5 pg/ml toxin, corresponding to 10 LD 50 /ml. The
toxin/antitoxin mixture was briefly shaken on a plate shaker for 1 min at room temperature, then incubated for
1 hr at 37°C, before being transferred (50 μl/well) to
another 96-well ELISA plate previously coated with custom made SNAP-25(137-206) peptide. The plate was incubated for ~18 hr at room temperature and washed 3 times
in PBS-0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (wash buffer). Specific cleavage of SNAP-25 (137-206) peptide by the BoNT/A toxin
was detected with a commercial anti-SNAP-25 mouse
monoclonal antibody (Lifespan Biosciences LS-C39152/
10719), diluted 1:750 in wash buffer containing 2.5% (w/v)
skimmed milk powder, of which 100 μl were added to all
wells. The plate was incubated at room temperature for
90 mins, washed and reaction visualised by addition of
100 μl/well of diluted anti-mouse-HRP conjugate (Sigma),
diluted 1:2000 in wash buffer containing 2.5% (w/v)
skimmed milk powder) [45].
