Abstract
Background: The genus Aquilegia, consisting of approximately 70 taxa, is a member of the basal eudicot lineage,
Ranuculales, which is evolutionarily intermediate between monocots and core eudicots, and represents a relatively
unstudied clade in the angiosperm phylogenetic tree that bridges the gap between these two major plant groups.
Aquilegia species are closely related and their distribution covers highly diverse habitats. These provide rich
resources to better understand the genetic basis of adaptation to different pollinators and habitats that in turn
leads to rapid speciation. To gain insights into the genome structure and facilitate gene identification, comparative
genomics and whole-genome shotgun sequencing assembly, BAC-based genomics resources are of crucial
importance.
Results: BAC-based genomic resources, including two BAC libraries, a physical map with anchored markers and
BAC end sequences, were established from A. formosa. The physical map was composed of a total of 50,155 BAC
clones in 832 contigs and 3939 singletons, covering 21X genome equivalents. These contigs spanned a physical
length of 689.8 Mb (~2.3X of the genome) suggesting the complex heterozygosity of the genome. A set of 197
markers was developed from ESTs induced by drought-stress, or involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis or floral
development, and was integrated into the physical map. Among these were 87 genetically mapped markers that
anchored 54 contigs, spanning 76.4 Mb (25.5%) across the genome. Analysis of a selection of 12,086 BAC end
sequences (BESs) from the minimal tiling path (MTP) allowed a preview of the Aquilegia genome organization,
including identification of transposable elements, simple sequence repeats and gene content. Common repetitive
elements previously reported in both monocots and core eudicots were identified in Aquilegia suggesting the
value of this genome in connecting the two major plant clades. Comparison with sequenced plant genomes
indicated a higher similarity to grapevine (Vitis vinifera) than to rice and Arabidopsis in the transcriptomes.
Conclusions: The A. formosa BAC-based genomic resources provide valuable tools to study Aquilegia genome.
Further integration of other existing genomics resources, such as ESTs, into the physical map should enable better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive radiation and elaboration of floral morphology.

Background
Recent progress in genomic research using the model
species A. thaliana and crop species, such as rice,
maize, sorghum and tomato, has dramatically enhanced
our capacity to unravel the genetic basis of biological
diversity and the evolution of complex traits and genetic
pathways in plants. These include genes and pathways

determining plant architecture and fruit size [1,2], flowering time [3-6], light response [7,8] and plant defence
[9]. However, when studying fundamentals about how
organisms have adapted to their natural environments,
the information derived especially from crops is of limited application. In these species, many of the traits have
undergone intensive artificial selection over the course
of directed genetic improvement. In addition, these
plant species are often highly inbred due to either artificial selection or self-pollination, which may lead to an
increased likelihood of accumulating deleterious alleles,
and consequently the loss of atypical patterns of much

of the genetic variation displayed in natural systems
[10,11]. It is, therefore, critical to identify and develop
new model species from natural settings, with welldefined ecologies and abundant examples of adaptation
to various environments to advance our understanding
of plant evolution, development and ecology.
Several important factors need to be carefully
weighed when choosing new model species to develop
tools for genomic studies [12,13]. First, it is desirable
that the new systems encompass a wide range of morphological and ecological diversity occurring in the
flowering plants. This will not only allow understanding of the morphological variation in response to critical phenomena, but also facilitate investigation of the
physiological adaptation to new environments. Second,
with the information accumulated from the increasing
number of model systems within grasses (e.g., rice,
maize, sorghum, and Brachypodium distachyon) and
core eudicots (e.g., Arabidopsis, Medicago, tomato, and
Mimulus), the development of phylogenetically intermediate model systems would greatly facilitate genome
comparisons among these taxa and bridge the deep
evolutionary distance between the well-developed Arabidopsis and rice model systems [13,14]. Third, it is
ideal that genetic resources developed for new model
systems could be transferable to a wide-range of
related species, serving to address many questions for
the community at large [13].
Aquilegia, the columbine genus [15], is emerging as a
new evolutionary genomic model in a relatively unstudied area of the plant phylogenetic tree, the basal eudicots. Aquilegia species are so closely related that they
have been considered a species flock or syngameon
[15,16]. This group was extensively studied by Verne
Grant as an interesting example of recent adaptive
radiation leading to rapid speciation [16]. Variation in
pollinators has apparently driven the evolution of a wide
variety of floral morphologies and, along with adaptation
to different habitats, likely induced rapid reproductive
isolation [16,17]. Approximately 23 different species in
North America emerged in as little as 1-3 million years
[18] resulting in little sequence variation in DNA
regions such as chloroplast and rDNA [15]. Remarkably,
ecologically and morphologically distinct species share
the majority of sequence polymorphisms making them
difficult to distinguish at the molecular level [17,19-21],
which again suggests that these taxa are of very recent
origin. As such, it is not surprising that it has long been
known that species of Aquilegia are highly cross-compatible [16] which provides an opportunity for genetic studies across multiple fields such as ecology, physiology
and morphology [11,16 ,22,23]. The feature of cross
compatibility not only facilitates the genetic dissection
of traits, but also suggests that genomic tools developed

from a single species will be readily transferred to a
wide range of additional species [24].
Phylogenetically, Aquilegia belongs to the plant family
Ranunculaceae, which is a basal-eudicot lineage [23,25].
This position of being approximately equidistant, evolutionarily, from the current monocot (rice) and coreeudicot (Arabidopsis) model plant systems provides a
unique opportunity for comparative studies among
angiosperms of sequence information, genome structure,
and the conservation/diversification of developmental
pathways. For instance, it has been hypothesized that a
whole-genome duplication occurred near the base of the
eudicot lineage yet Aquilegia, and thus the Ranunculales,
appears to have predated this event [26-28]. Moreover,
Aquilegia possesses unusual floral morphology such as
petaloid sepals, nectar spurs and a recently evolved
novel floral organ, the staminodium, not available for
study in current model systems [29]. These traits, along
with its small genome size (~300 Mb), all support Aquilegia as an important new model for plant development,
ecology and evolution.
Here, we report the construction of a physical map of
the A. formosa genome using the High Information
Content Fingerprinting (HICF) method [30]. A single
individual from the wild was used for library construction because inbreeding depression has been found to
be exceptionally strong in all species of Aquilegia studied to date [31]. This plant has also been used as a
grandparent in a large F2 cross between A. formosa and
A. pubescens, which was utilized as the tissue source for
a large EST database http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/
cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=aquilegia and is being used
for QTL mapping. In addition, we integrated a total of
197 markers (many derived from the EST database) by
multi-dimensional pool hybridization, and produced
BAC end sequences of a minimum tiling path. Thus, the
physical map described here integrates across a number
of studies and genomic resources for Aquilegia. The
physical map and other information presented here will
help facilitate the long-range assembly of Aquilegia genome sequence and fine-scale mapping of QTLs as well
as comparative genomic studies. Because all species of
Aquilegia are highly similar at the genetic level (see
above), this resource should be important for genomic
studies spanning the entire genus.

Results
BAC library characterization

Two complementary restriction derived large-insert
BAC libraries of a single A. formosa plant were used for
constructing a physical map. Tissue was collected in the
wild along Bishop Creek Inyo Co., CA and sent to
Amplicon Express (Pullman, WA) for library construction. This same individual A. formosa plant has been

used as a parent to construct an A. formosa × A. pubescens F2 population for genetic mapping and EST
sequencing [32]. As summarized in Table 1, the A. formosa HindIII BAC library (AF_Bb) has an estimated
genome coverage of 15.2X and contains 29,568 clones
with an average insert size of 144.6 kb (N = 186). The
insert sizes range from 60-300 kb, and 87% of the clones
have an insert size of 100 kb or larger. The library has
4.8% empty vector clones. The A. formosa MboI BAC
library (AF_Bc) has an estimated genome coverage of
13.3X and contains 28,800 clones with an average insert
size of 110.9 kb (N = 187). The insert size range is 35290 kb. The library contains 59.4% clones with insert
size of 100 kb or larger, and 0.5% empty vector clones.
Other than these two libraries, a third BAC library was
constructed from A. coerulea “Goldsmith” ADQ47,
which is currently being used for whole genome sequencing at Joint Genome Institute (JGI) for comparative
genomic studies. The library was created by partial
digestion of high molecular weight genomic DNA with
HindIII according to the procedure of Peterson et al.
[33]. The library consisted of a total of 47,616 clones
with an average insert size of 131 kb to cover 20.7 genome equivalents.
HICF fingerprinting

A total of 28,728 and 28,393 clones from A. formosa
AF_Bb and AF_Bc BAC libraries, respectively, was successfully fingerprinted using HICF method of Luo et al.
[30]. The analysis resulted in an average of 83.7 and
78.6 bands per clone for the AF_Bb and AF_Bc libraries,
respectively, with an overall average of 81.1 bands per
clone (Table 1). Of the 57,121 successfully fingerprinted
clones from both libraries, 50,155 were successfully
assigned electronic fingerprints with the GenoProfiler
[34] software for subsequent assembly using FPC v8.5.3
software [35]. Given 128 kb for the average insert size
from both libraries, the clones included in the FPC project represent approximately 21X of Aquilegia genome
(1N ≃ 300 Mb) (Table 2).
Physical Map Assembly

Fingerprints from both BAC libraries were combined
for contig assembly using a tolerance of 3 and a cutoff

containing 39,489 (78.7%) clones and 10,674 singletons.
Eight clones were manually removed due to poor
fingerprinting. The average Sulston score was 0.879.
After using the DQer to break up contigs consisting of
more than 10% questionable clones, a consecutive
reduction in stringency at 1e-5 for each End-End and
Single-End merge using the “clone plus markers
(CPM)” function at a tolerance of 3 was performed to
reassemble contigs. The final systematic contig assembly was calculated at a cutoff value of 1e-35. Further
manual contig merges, based on the results from marker hybridization (as described in “Methods”), were
conducted at a cutoff value of 1e-20 and tolerance of 3,
and resulted in a total of 832 contigs consisting of
46,216 (92.1%) clones and 3,939 singletons (Table 2).
A minimal tiling path (MTP) was selected using default
parameters of FPC and 6,505 clones were selected for
end sequencing.
Overgo probe hybridization and marker integration

To bridge genetic and physical maps and isolate a list of
genes implicated in environmental adaptations, floral
development and color for further studies, overgo
probes were developed from (a) a list of markers that

expressed upon drought stress, (c) a list of genes potentially related to anthocyanin biosynthesis [36] and (d) a
list of genes associated with flower development. Each
hybridization experiment included a total of 125 markers assigned in 15 pools and each pool consisted of 25
markers (Figure 1). We considered a “hit” (i.e., positively
identified BAC) as one that all three different pools containing a probe produced a clear hybridization signal.
This 3-dimentional-pool hybridization approach has the
advantage of reducing the number of false positive
clones. Results from the first pool hybridization
anchored a total of 95 drought-induced genes to the

physical map with 79 markers hybridized to a single
contig, 10 to two contigs, and only 6 markers to three
or more contigs (Table 3). Similarly, the second pool
hybridization placed 102 markers on the map and
anchored a total of 65 contigs. Among these 102 markers were 87 genetically mapped markers that collectively anchored 54 contigs, covering a total of 76.4 Mb
(25.5% genome) (Table 4). Furthermore, most of these
markers from the second pool hybridization were
mapped to separate contigs, only 14 contigs contained 2
markers, and only 1 contig had 3 markers (Table 5). All
the markers, except TC32786, which failed to hybridize,
were derived from genes potentially involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis and mapped to different contigs
(Table 6). In summary, results from the two hybridization experiments anchored a total of 197 markers to the
physical map. Among the markers were 177 markers
(90%) mapped to single contigs, 12 (6%) mapped to 2
contigs, and 8 (4%) mapped to multiple (≥3) contigs.
Details of all contigs are available from the WebFPC
project located at http://www.genome.clemson.edu/physical_maps/aquilegia.

Validation of the contig assembly

Results from marker hybridization were also used to
verify the contig assembly because, in theory, all clones
that hybridized to a non-repetitive overgo probe are
expected to be in the same contig. Alternatively, positive
clones could be located at the ends of different contigs
that do not have enough overlap to be assembled into a
single contig under the stringency used for the analysis.
On the other hand, BAC clones from unrelated contigs
would be hybridized if an overgo probe happens to contain a repeat. To test these predictions we randomly
chose ctg3184 (which contains 166 clones) from among
those contigs that had multiple probe hybridizations.
Pool hybridization anchored three markers to this contig. The first marker, Aq_SR_ctg_116, hybridized to 5
clones, among which were 4 clones (as labelled in green

Figure 2 Contig3184 of the A. formosa FPC build. A total of 4 (labelled in green on the left), 6 (labelled in violet in the middle) and 9
(labelled in green on the right) BACs were positively hybridized to marker Aq_SR_ctg_116, Aq_SR_ctg_92 and Aq_SR_ctg_97, respectively. These
BACs were neighbouring to each other in three clusters in association with corresponding markers. Hybridization of the BAC library with the
probe derived from the BAC end sequence, AF_Bb010H19f (labelled in salmon orange) identified 8 BACs, five of which were also clustered in
this contig as marked in light blue. Only AF_Bc library was used for the hybridization experiment.

included in the project due to the failed fingerprint and
(b) 2 clones located at the very two ends of another contig, ctg318 (Figure 3, blue-labelled clones), possibly due
to the presence of low copy homologous sequence shared
with the probe. Thus, the hybridization results were consistent with and in support of the contig assembly, which
is based on the fingerprint similarity of the BACs.
In another independent validation analysis, oligo primers were designed from a set of 8 markers for PCR
amplification on all positively hybridized clones. As
summarized in Table 7, other than Aq_SR_Ctg_8 and
Aq_SR_Ctg_133, which only gave 10/12 and 3/4 successful PCR amplifications, respectively, the remaining 6
markers allowed amplification of expected amplicons
from all positive clones. For example, overgo marker
Aq_SR_Ctg_30 derived from an ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme E2 homolog hybridized to 8 positive BACs, and
PCR analysis using a gene-specific primer pair generated
matching amplicons from all these 8 positive clones,
confirming the potential presence of the gene in these

clones. The results were also consistent with the contig
assembly in which 7 of the 8 clones were assembled in a
patch in ctg567 (Figure 4, green-labeled clones) while
the absence of the last BAC was due to failed HICF fingerprinting of the clone, which in turn excluded the
clone from the framework physical map. In summary, a
physical map was constructed through 3 major steps.
First, an initial build was generated under high stringency with a Sulston score at 0.879. Second, contigs
were further connected through a series of automated
merges utilizing consecutive stepping-down stringencies
from 1e-50 to 1e-35. Third, the physical map was
further analyzed by manual editing of the contigs at
lower cutoff at 1e-20 and tolerance at 3 according to
marker hybridization data and an increased requirement
for three end clone matches. The fidelity of the contig
build could be confirmed by two sequence-based
approaches, including (a) identification of neighbouring
clones by hybridization with probes derived from BACend sequence of the same contig, and (b) analysis of the

Figure 4 Verification of FPC build. Hybridization of the AF_BC BAC library with marker Aq_SR_ctg_30 (as highlighted in blue) identified 8
clones. Of these 8 clones were 7 clones (highlighted in green) in Ctg567 based on the FPC assembly. The remaining 1 clone did not have HICF
data in the FPC and was therefore not seen in the build. All of these 8 clones generated amplicon of the expected size.

BAC end sequencing

BAC end sequencing from both forward and reverse
directions of 6,505 BACs covering a minimal tiling path
of the physical framework generated a total of 12,086
(93% success) high quality sequences (at least 100 contiguous bases ≥ phred20) with an average length of 567
bases. This was equivalent to one sequence tag per 24.8
kb (considering the genome size of 300 Mb). After filtering for vector contamination and trimming for quality, the BESs were deposited in GenBank’s GSS
sequence repository: library AF_Bb has accessions
ER936645-ER942217 and library AF_Bc has accessions
ER967023-ER973759. Comparison of the BESs to multiple plant chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes indicated a low level of plastid-origin BACs, 0.2% for each
organelle. The BAC sequences, excluding those of putative plastid origins, encompass 6,834,517 base pairs,

which corresponds to approximately 2.3% of the Aquilegia genome [23].
The BAC end sequences have an average GC content
of 37.6%. Microsatellites were identified from 2,091
BESs, and primers could be designed to flank 1,630 of
the SSRs. These putatively mappable markers include
570 dinucleotide repeats, 550 trinucleotide repeats, 525
tetranucleotide repeats, and 177 pentanucleotide repeats.
A set of 1,729 sequences matched known transposable
elements. Considering only the best matching element
for each BAC end sequence, the most commonly
matched species from the database was grapevine (V.
vinifera) with 414 BAC ends having matches to grapevine elements. The matches encompassed 66 different
repetitive elements including multiple members of the
gypsy, copia, MuDR and En/Spm classes. These matches
had an average Smith-Waterman score of 682. The next
most common organisms for matches consisted of A.
thaliana (370 BAC ends to 76 elements, score of 662),
Populus trichocarpa (296 BAC ends to 43 elements,

Fang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:621
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/621

score of 878), followed by Medicago truncatula (166
BAC ends to 59 elements, score of 577), and Oryza
sativa (143 BAC ends to 57 elements, score of 430).
The most commonly identified individual element was
Atlantys1_1 that matched 143 A. formosa BAC ends.
Atlantys1_1 represents an internal coding segment of
the larger Atlantys endogenous retrovirus in the Ty3gypsy family. This family is widespread across plants;
Atlantys accounts for much of the genome size variation
in rice [37] and also has RepBase records originating
from A. thaliana, Lotus japonicus, and Sorghum bicolor.
Other commonly identified elements include copia42PTR_I, an LTR retrotransposon from Populus matching
83 BAC ends; POPGY1_I, the internal portion of a
Gypsy-type retroelement matching 64 BAC ends; and
Copia-31-lTR_VV, a LTR retrotransposon from V. vinifera matching 60 BAC ends (Additional file 1)
After filtration of organelle, transposable elements
and repetitive sequences, the remaining BESs were
assembled with CAP3 [38] followed by mining for
potential gene coding regions. The assembly resulted in
8,140 singlets and 458 contigs. Two different strategies
were used to identify potential coding regions in the
unique sequences. In the first approach, the non-redundant dataset was compared to the tentative Aquilegia
consensus EST sequences from the Gene Index Project
[39] with tblastx [40] at a stringency of 1e-25. The
results indicated 2,488 of the genomic sequences have at
least one EST match. As the EST resource represented
only an imperfect representation of the transcriptome, a
BLASTX of Arabidopsis, Oryza and Vitis gene models
was further performed with a cut-off E value of 1e-25 in
the second approach, resulting in an additional 750, 337
and 921 potential coding non-redundant BAC ends,
respectively. Of the 8598 non-redundant sequences,
2,782 (23% of the total 12,086 BESs) were flagged as
potential coding regions.
An overall comparison to three plant model genomes
was performed by a blastn [40] of all the BESs to the
whole genome sequences with an E-value cut-off of 1e10. Aquilegia sequences exhibited relatively low similarity to A. thaliana and O. sativa with only 348 and 245
matches, respectively, while there were 906 matches
with V. vinifera genome (Figure 5). The results provided
the first global sequence information to support the
phylogenetic placement of Aquilegia in angiosperms,
and the observation from the shared transposable element between Aquilegia and the grapevine further
reiterates the close colineage between these two clades.
The fact that Aquilegia genome contains transposable
elements similar to both monocot and eudicot species
also highlights the uniqueness of Aquilegia in studying
plant evolution. We identified 906 Aquilegia BAC-end
sequences that aligned with one or more of the 19

chromosome-based pseudomolecules of the Vitis genome (Additional file 2) and 207 sequences aligned to
unanchored Vitis genomic sequence. The alignment of
the 906 Aquilegia BESs to the corresponding chromosome-based pseudomolecules of Vitis genome was summarized in Table 8. Using the series of synteny mapping
algorithms, we mapped 54 blocks of synteny to the V.
vinifera draft genome assembly (Figure 6).

Discussion
Aquilegia represents a unique clade of basal eudicots
possessing a number of important unique features,
including its phylogenetic position in the lower eudicots,
unusual floral morphology (e.g., petaloid sepals, nectar
spurs and staminodia), and its distribution in diverse
ecological habitats. Collectively, all these traits contributed to Aquilegia being developed as a new model system
for studying floral variation, adaptive radiations and evolution [23,32,36]. To further understand the genome
structure and provide molecular insights bridging monocots and eudicots and facilitate molecular dissection of
the traits associated with inflorescence development and
environmental adaptations, a BAC-based genomic
resource, including three BAC libraries and a physical
map, was developed in this study. Among the three
libraries were two libraries derived from A. formosa,
representing 15.2X and 13.3X genome equivalents,
respectively, for physical map construction. A third

library was constructed from A. coerulea Goldsmith to
have 20.7X genome coverage for further comparative
genomics studies to address the molecular basis for
floral variation and adaptive radiation within the genus.
The Aquilegia physical map was composed of 50,155
clones and had a deep 21X genome coverage.

Page 10 of 15

Furthermore, a collection of BACs orchestrating a minimal tiling path from the contig assembly were isolated
for BAC end sequencing to provide a glimpse of the
genome organization of this model plant. Both the physical map and the BESs could also serve as landmarks
for genome sequence assembly and anchoring ESTs to
the genome. Marker hybridizations using a total of 197
markers associated with drought-stress, anthocyanin
biosynthesis and floral development not only allowed
integration of genetic map into the contig framework,
but also identified candidate genomic regions for further
gene isolation and characterization. The genome
resource is expected to serve as a pivotal platform for
comparative genomics study to elucidate genome variations between monocots and basal eudicot and to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying
environment adaptation and floral variations.
In recent years, HICF fingerprinting has been commonly applied to replace traditional agarose [41] and
polyacrylamide gel methods [42] in various genome fingerprinting projects due to its high-throughput procedure, increased number of fragments generated from
each clone and more improved contig assembly than
other approaches [43]. In this study, an average of 81
restriction fragments was generated from the clones in
the FPC project. The high-informative fingerprints provided high resolution identity from each clone for accurate contig assembly that can be further verified by
marker hybridization in which 189 (96%) of the total
197 genetic markers hybridized to only 1 or 2 contigs
instead of scattering around the entire genome.

Figure 6 Syntenies shared between Aquilegia and V. vinifera. A total of 54 syntenies, where both pair-end sequences from the same BAC
match the same locus in Vitis genome, were identified by SyMAP analysis. The black dots in green Vitis bars indicate all annotated ESTs from the
Vitis genome. The blue Aquilegia bars are the Aquilegia contigs that have syntenies aligned to Vitis genome. The name of each contig was
described in each bar. The contigs were arranged based on the order of their corresponding orthologs in Vitis genome. The contigs assigned to
the same Aquilegia “pseudochromosome” (marked as Aquilegia chr 0) may not overlap each other. There might be gaps among the contigs in
the same “pseudochromosome”. The purple lines connecting the green Vitis bars and blue Aquilegia bars indicate the match syntenies.

Fang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:621
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/621

Furthermore, the positively hybridized clones were overlapped in clusters in most contigs, indicating that the
contig assembly, which is based on fingerprinting similarity, is consistent with the sequence-based results. The
accuracy of contig assembly could also be verified by
PCR amplicon analysis as shown in Table 7. Thus, we
are confident with the strategy for building a physical
map that begins with contig assembly at high stringency
at cutoff 1e-50 and tolerance 3, which gave a high average Sulston score of 0.879, followed by a series of EndEnd and Single-End merges of the small BAC scaffolds
under gradually decreased stringency till 1e-35, followed
by further manual editing at 1e-20 based on marker
hybridization data. Among the successful 197 markers
used for the hybridization were 87 markers that have
been genetically mapped; these markers anchored a total
of 54 contigs that cover 76.4 Mb (25.5% of the genome)
on all 7 linkage groups (Table 4). These mapped contigs
not only organize a framework to study the Aquilegia
genome, but also pave the way for gene isolation and
characterization by map-based cloning approach to
further understand the genes of interest.
The genes involved in anthocyanin pigmentation biosynthesis in wheat are arranged in a gene cluster in the
short arm of chromosome 7 [44-46]. Similar clustering of
the genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites was also reported from grapevine [47]. Unlike
these species, the 16 anthocyanin biosynthesis related
genes in Aquilegia appear to be dispersed in the genome
(Table 6), suggesting the unique deployment of the genes
in this lower eudicot genus. However, a number of additional genes belonging to the anthocyanin and broader
flavonoid pathway have been identified [36] but not
assayed here, and therefore the possibility cannot be
ruled out that some gene clustering might be identified
in the future. The contigs anchored from this study could
serve as resource for unravelling the molecular basis
underlying floral color variation and evolution.
An expansion in the physical span of the contigs was
observed in this study. The collective physical span of
all contigs as calculated by the CB map function of FPC
software [35] was estimated to be 689.8 Mb (~ 2.3X
genome size, 1N = 300 Mb). As only 197 marker hybridization results were analyzed and these markers were
biased toward specific biological functions, it cannot be
ruled out, although unlikely, that the contig assembly is
not best optimized and some contigs remain to be
further merged together. As the single A. formosa individual used for BAC library construction has been shown
to be highly heterozygous at more than 30 SSR and
SNP loci (Hodges, unpublished data), the excessive physical length might be due to the heterozygous genome
collected from the field that was composed of highly
diverse haplotype DNAs as a result of the outcrossing

Page 11 of 15

nature of the species. Similar inflated length from physical map has been reported from other outcrossing species, including poplar [48] and grapevine [49]. As the
genome sequencing project is near finishing, further
assembly and analysis of genome sequence will uncover
more details about the genome components and suggest
events that took place affecting genome structure of this
basal eudicot taxa. To maintain the accuracy in contig
assembly, further reduction in stringency to merge more
contigs was not pursued in this study. In the future, fingerprint contig assembly can be refined through more
hybridizations using additional mapped markers and
probes designed from the end clones of contigs.
The BESs from the minimal tiling path clones also
provided insights into the genome composition of this
novel model plant, including low GC content, transposable elements and gene content. Interestingly, higher
homology in putative coding regions shared between
Aquilegia and the grapevine, V. vinifera, in comparison
to two other model plants, including rice and Arabidopsis was also observed (Figure 5). As Vitis is
affiliated with the earliest diverging lineage of rosids in
the core eudicots of the angiosperms [50], and Aquilegia is in basal eudicots in the phylogenetic tree [23,32],
the close conservation between these two species not
only provides a global molecular evidence to support
the phylogenetic lineage that connects basal eudicots
to core eudicots but also provides a rich resource for
investigating the genome evolution, such as the events
of genome duplication and subsequence variation
[51-53], in the course from monocots to eudicots in
angiosperms. In this report, preliminary comparative
genomics studies using SyMAP uncovered 54 syntenic
blocks between Aquilegia and Vitis (Figure 6). These
syntenies provide a first glimpse of the Aquilegia structural organization and a rich resource to trace the
events of DNA translocation during the evolution of
these two lineages. Further characterization of the
shared transposable elements from the Aquilegia genome will also provide insights into the evolution of
plants. More extensive survey using the whole-genome
sequence information in the near future is expected to
aid in-depth studies into the evolution genomics of the
basal eudicot taxa. On the other hand, the discovery
that alignment of the BESs from the physical framework contigs failed to identify significant synteny with
other reported genomes also reiterates the significance
of the unique genome structure of Aquilegia in understanding the evolution of the plant genomes.

Conclusions
The BAC-based genome resource established from this
study, including deep genome coverage libraries from A.
formosa and A. coerulea, a partially integrated physical

Fang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:621
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/621

map is expected to promote better understanding of the
genome structure of the unique intermediate between
rice and Arabidopsis. It will also provide tremendous
insights into the molecular clues and genetic networks
underlying ecological adaption and morphological diversity. Results from the analysis of the BESs derived from
the minimal tiling path (MTP) indicated a close similarity in both transposable elements and annotated gene
models with the grapevine genome further suggesting
the significance of the genome resource in studying the
molecular elements involved in the lineage of evolution
progression. This genomic resource is expected to facilitate comparative genomics research, gene isolation and
characterization to address the unique biological feature
of this novel model plant.

Methods
BAC DNA fingerprinting and contig assembly

DNA was isolated from a total of 58,368 clones from
both AF_Bb and AF_Bc BAC libraries by following standard alkaline lysis miniprep methods [54], and used for
fingerprinting using the HICF method of Luo et al. [30].
The fingerprinting profiles were further processed by
GeneMapper 3.7 (Applied Biosystems), GenoProfiler 2.0
[34], and uploaded to FPC v8.5.3 software [35] for contig assembly. To maintain the quality of contig assembly
the initial build was processed at high stringency using
the cutoff of 1e-50 and a tolerance of 3. The DQer function of the FPC package was performed to break down
all contigs with more than 10% of Q clones to reduce
false assembly. Further reassembly was conducted by
consecutive reductions of the stringency at 1e-5 for the
Ends-Ends analysis followed by Single-End analysis until
the final cutoff of 1e-35 with tolerance of 3 was reached.
The accuracy of the contig assembly was examined by
marker hybridization and PCR analysis. Further manual
editing of the assembly was conducted based on the following principles: (a) cutoff at 1e-20 and tolerance at 3,
(b) for 2 contigs to be merged, the first contig needs to
have at least 3 matched clones (matched clones are
clones shared at least 41 common bands under the
designated stringency) and the second contig needs to
have at least 2 matched clones, (c) only 2 matched
clones are required for contig merge if these 2 contigs
also share the same genetic marker(s),
Overgo design and hybridization

To establish a genome resource from an environmental
and ecological model plant to better support gene identification and characterization, a collection of stress-induced
genes were first chosen for hybridization to anchor the
potential stress-related markers in the physical map.
Furthermore, a BAC library from A. coerulea was also
included in the hybridization for comparative genomics

Page 12 of 15

studies. Briefly, ESTs preferentially up-regulated by
drought-stress were generated from subtractive hybridization analysis (Henry, unpublished data). The low complex
sequences were further removed by a pipeline composed
of Repeat Masker [55] with the RepBase database [56],
Cross_Match [57] and Tandem Repeat Finder [58]. The
remaining sequences were screened for overgo oligomers
by OligoSpawn [59]. A total of 125 pairs of oligomers
were synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies).
Overgo probes were individually labelled by following the
procedure of the Clemson University Genomics Institute
(CUGI) hybridization protocol http://www.genome.clemson.edu/resources/protocols. An in-house experimental
design script http://www.genome.clemson.edu/software/
hybdecon/exp_setup was used to assign probes into 15
pools in a 3-dimensional pooling design, with each pool
containing 25 probes (Figure 1). All 32-P labelled probes
were mixed in their corresponding pools, denatured and
added to hybridization against 2 BAC libraries, including
the AF_Bb library of A. formosa and a HindIII library of A.
coerulea. Hybridization was performed at 60°C for 2
nights. Filters were washed with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C
for 30 minutes for 5 times and exposed to phosphor
screens, and the images were recorded by a Typhoon 9400
Imager (GE Healthcare, Bio-Sciences). The addresses of
the positively hybridized BAC clones were manually
scored using the software HybSweeper [60], and subsequently deconvoluted for positive BACs corresponding to
each probe with an in-house PERL script Hybdecon
http://www.genome.clemson.edu/software/hybdecon.
Hybridization results were then incorporated into FPC
project to anchor markers into the contig framework.
By following the same procedure, another set of 125
overgo probes was designed from various resources,
including 87 mapped markers, 16 genes potentially
involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis [36], 12 genes
involved in floral development (Kramer, unpublished
data) and 10 other SNP markers for additional pool
hybridization. Successful markers were integrated into
the map. Sequence information of all overgo probes
were listed in Additional file 3.
Contig validation by marker hybridization and PCR
analysis

For PCR validation, primers were designed from a total of
8 markers randomly chosen from the drought-stress
induced ESTs (Table 5). All positively hybridized BACs
corresponding to every individual marker were analyzed
by PCR amplification. The condition for the PCR reaction was 94°C for 1 min for initial denaturation, followed
by 25 cycles of denaturing at 94°C for 15 sec, annealing
at 55°C for 30 sec, and extension at 60°C for 60 sec, followed by a final cycle of extension for 10 min. The
reagents were PCR kit from Clonetech (Palo Alto, CA).

Fang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:621
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/621

The amplicons were resolved in 1.0% agarose gel and
ethidium bromide stained, and the presence/absence of
the amplicons of expected sizes were examined.
BAC end sequencing

A total of 6,505 overlapping BAC clones that constituted the minimal tiling path were rearrayed and cultured in 96-well deep plates for DNA isolation, and
approximately 300 ng of each individual DNA was
used for BAC end sequencing by universal T7 and Sp6
primers for both ends using the “Dye Terminator”
chemistry from ABI kit version v3.1 and resolved on
ABI3730XL sequencer. In-house quality control software was used to filter and trim raw sequences. The
pipeline includes publicly available tools such as Phred
[57], Cross_Match [57] and Lucy [61] for base calling
and vector masking. Trimmed sequences of less than
100 bp or with greater than 5% N bases were removed.
The high quality, trimmed sequences were searched
for organelle origin by BLAST [40] against multiple
genomes from GenBank: A. thaliana, Nicotiana sylvestris, O. sativa, and Ranunculus macranthus chloroplast
genomes and the A. thaliana, N. tobacum, O. sativa
and V. vinifera mitochondrial genomes. The software
RepeatMasker version 3.2.7 [55] coupling with a
RepBase library [56] of all known Viridiplantae repetitive elements was used to identify repeats from the
Aquilegia BESs. Classification of the repeat families
was based on the annotation in the database. A CUGI
PERL script was used to identify microsatellites with at
least five dinucleotide, four trinucleotide, three tetranucleotide or three pentanucleotide motifs in a row.
Primer3 [62] was used to identify primers surrounding
each predicted SSR element.
Synteny mapping

BAC-end sequences anchored to fingerprint contigs
were assessed for synteny with the V. vinifera draft genome assembly http://www.plantgdb.org/VvGDB using
the SyMAP [63] software. First, repetitive/low-complex
motifs were screened and masked with Repeatmasker
[55]. Next, BLAT [64] was used to align the FPC
sequences (BES and markers) using the nucleotide/
nucleotide search mode with a minScore of 30 and a
minIdentity of 70.

the probes, marker sequences were processed through a pipeline

remove low complex sequence regions before screening for overgo
oligomers by OligoSpawn.
