Abstract
Background: The dishevelled and axin genes encode multi-domain proteins that play key roles in
WNT signalling. Dishevelled prevents β-catenin degradation by interfering with the interaction of
β-catenin with the degradation-mediating Axin-APC-GSK3β complex. This interference leads to an
accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin, which enters the nucleus and interacts with transcription
factors that induce expression of Wnt-target genes. Axin, as a component of the degradationmediating complex, is a potent negative regulator of Wnt signalling, whereas Dishevelled is a potent
activator. Both Dishevelled and Axin possess a DIX (Dishevelled/Axin) domain, which mediates
protein-protein interactions, specifically homodimerization.
Results: An evolutionary trace analysis of DIX domains identified conserved residues which, when
mapped onto the crystal structure of the Axin DIX domain and a comparative model of the
Dishevelled DIX domain, allow their categorization as residues of either structural or functional
importance. We identify residues that are structural and functional determinants of the DIX
domain fold, as well as those that are specific to homodimerization of Axin and Dishevelled.
Conclusion: This report provides the first explanation of the mutant phenotypes caused by nonsynonymous substitutions in the Dishevelled and Axin DIX domain by correlating their presumed
functional significance with molecular structure.

Background
Signalling by members of the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins relies on dynamic interactions between protein
complexes to regulate transcription, the cytoskeleton and
cell adhesion [1,2]. Binding of Wnt proteins to their receptors, members of the Frizzled and LRP families, leads to
the activation of Dishevelled, a multi-domain protein that
mediates many functions of Wnt [1-3] and this triggers a
sequence of protein-protein interactions, which culminate in specific effector activities.

In the 'canonical' pathway, Wnt proteins regulate transcription of specific genes by modulating the amount,
activity and intracellular location of β-catenin, a multidomain protein with a role in linking Cadherins to the
cytoskeleton, in addition to being an effector of Wnt signalling [4]. In the absence of Wnt, a soluble pool of β-catenin is targeted for degradation by a multiprotein
complex assembled around the scaffolding protein Axin
and in which glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is the
catalytic component. GSK3β phosphorylates β-catenin,

thus targeting it for degradation by the proteosome [1,4].
Upon Wnt signalling, Dishevelled prevents β-catenin degradation by interfering with the interaction of the AxinAPC-GSK3β complex and β-catenin [1,5-8]. This activity
involves a direct interaction between Dishevelled and
Axin [8] and leads to an accumulation of cytoplasmic βcatenin, which enters the nucleus and interacts with transcription factors of the LEF/TCF family, inducing the transcription of Wnt-target genes.
The central role of Dishevelled in Wnt signalling and the
key role of Axin in the activity of β-catenin suggest that the
interaction between these two proteins represents a central event for Wnt activity. The interaction between these
two proteins is mediated for the most part through their
DIX (Dishevelled/Axin) domains, although other regions
of both proteins are also involved [5,6,8]. A third protein
containing a DIX domain, and also involved in Wnt signalling, is the coiled-coil protein DIX-domain-containing
1 (DIXdc1, also known as Ccd1). It acts as a positive regulator of WNT signalling and although the molecular
mechanism underlying this function is not clear [9,10], it
interacts with Dishevelled through its DIX domain. In
contrast, the interaction of DIXdc1 with Axin is not
dependent on its DIX domain [10].
The DIX domain is a region of approximately 83 to 85 residues in length located at the N-terminus of Dishevelled
and at the C-terminus of Axin and DIXdc1 (Figure 1A).
While the domain architecture in Figure 1A are those of
human Dishevelled 1, rat Axin 1 and human DIXdc1, the
relative location of the domains in each of these protein's
homologues is similar. The DIX domain has been shown
to be involved in dimer formation, which has led to the
suggestion that this kind of interactions might mediate
the regulation of the activity of the Axin-based complex
[5,11-13]. A crystal structure of the Axin DIX domain
(1WSP) has recently been reported [14]. It consists of a
five-stranded β-sheet in which the β-strands are in the
order 2-1-5-3-4 and a single α-helix (residues T776 to
L784) that packs into the concave groove of the β-sheet
(Figure 1B). This fold is similar to the common β-grasp
fold of the ubiquitin superfamily [15] and is widespread
among proteins (Figure 1C). Proteins containing ubiquitin-like folds often have an additional helix between βstrands 4 and 5, which is absent form the DIX domain.
Examples of such proteins are ubiquitin itself and the
Phox-Bem1 (PB1) domain-containing proteins whose
PB1 domains form asymmetric dimers [16-18] that are
similar to those of the Axin DIX domain [14].
Only a limited number of functionally important amino
acids in DIX domains have been identified and additional
single or multiple substitutions may shed light on the precise function of this domain. Here we have performed a

sequence-structure analysis of the DIX domain of Axin
and Dishevelled using the evolutionary trace analysis
approach first described by Lichtarge et al. [19], to identify
residues that could be selectively targeted in mutagenesis
studies. Trace residues were mapped onto the crystal structure of the Axin DIX domain and onto a comparative
model of the Dishevelled DIX domain, allowing their categorization as residues of either structural or functional
importance. These residues could be further categorized as
either conserved or class-specific. Most conserved residues
cluster on the protein-protein interaction interface
required for DIX homotypic interactions. Many of these
are absolutely conserved, whereas the class-specific surface-exposed trace residues are likely required for specificity of DIX domain interactions. The analysis reported
here provides a structure-based explanation of the mutant

phenotypes caused by non-synonymous substitutions in
the Dishevelled and Axin DIX domain.

Methods
Comparative modelling
A comparative model of the human Dishevelled 1 DIX
domain, residues M1 to E85, was created using Modeller
9v1 [20] based on the coordinates of chain B residue C750
to D832 of the asymmetric unit of the Axin DIX domain
(1WSP) [14]. The latter was identified as a structural
homologue by the homology recognition algorithm
FUGUE [21]. A structure-based sequence alignment of the
Dishevelled and Axin DIX domain was created using ClustalW [22] and manually edited in order to ensure that secondary structural elements remained gap-free. Secondary
structure for the human Dishevelled 1 DIX domain was
predicted using JPred [23]. Model geometry was validated
using PROCHECK [24]. Topologically similar folds to that
of the Axin DIX domain were identified using DALI [25].
Evolutionary trace analysis
One hundred and twenty sequence homologues of the
human Dishevelled 1 DIX domain were identified using
BLASTp with the database search parameter set to nonredundant protein sequences. Of these, 63 were retained
for evolutionary trace analysis (see Additional file 1). Protein sequences that were discarded for this analysis were
either redundant sequences, hypothetical proteins or
sequences annotated as 'unknown' proteins. Of the
retained sequences, 22 were of Axin, 31 of Dishevelled
and 10 of DIXdc1. These sequences were aligned using
ClustalW [22] and manually edited to ensure no gaps
were inserted into areas of known secondary structure.
Evolutionary trace analysis of the resulting sequence
alignment was performed using TraceSuiteII [26] according to the method of Lichtarge et al. [19]. This method, in
brief, assumes that architecture-defining residues are
mostly invariant, whereas residues that are functionally
important may undergo numerous substitutions over
time. Furthermore, it assumes that proteins that have
diverged recently would share greater sequence identity
than those that diverged earlier. A phylogenetic tree is
constructed base on a multiple-sequence alignment and
this tree then arbitrarily partitioned (denoted by vertical
lines across the tree). Each partition will contain a different set of tree nodes. The sequences associated with these
nodes are aligned to generate a consensus sequence for
that partition. Trace residues in a particular partition are
those that are conserved. Residues conserved in the first
few partitions (close to the root of the tree) were conserved in the distant past and are most often important for
structural reasons. Residues conserved in later partitions
(close to the branches of the tree) were conserved more
recently and are associated with function. Trace residues
are then mapped onto a molecular structure, which is
examined visually to identify clusters of residues.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/70

Trace residues were mapped onto the structure of the Axin
DIX domain (1WSP) and the comparative model of the
Dishevelled DIX domain. Based on their location in the
relevant structure, the trace residues were classified as
either (1) conserved and buried, (2) conserved and surface exposed, (3) class-specific and buried or (4) class-specific and surface exposed. Class-specific residues are
residues that are conserved only in a subset of sequences,
such a subset being defined as a class. Residues were classified as buried if less than 30% of their side chain is solvent accessible.

Results and discussion
Comparative modelling
A comparative model of the Dishevelled DIX domain was
created in order to gain some insight into the functionally
significant elements of this domain. We used the
sequence of the human Dishevelled 1 DIX domain to
search for structural homologues to act as templates for
comparative modelling. The Axin DIX domain of Rattus
norvegicus (1WSP) was the only structural homologue of
the human Dishevelled DIX domain identified with certainty by the homology recognition server FUGUE (Zscore 19.18). The R. norvegicus Axin and the human
Dishevelled DIX domain share 30% sequence identity. A
sequence-based secondary structure prediction of the
human Dishevelled DIX domain showed that the position
and identity of secondary structural elements match those
of the Axin DIX domain crystal structure (data not shown;
[14]). Given the degree of sequence identity, which is an
established measure of comparative model accuracy [20],
and their similar predicted secondary structure content
and related protein-protein interaction function, it is
likely that the overall structures of the Dishevelled and the
Axin domains are similar. The final model of the DIX
domain of human Dishevelled 1 contained all of the protein's N-terminal 85 residues, 93.4% of which are in the
most favoured region of the Ramachandran plot, 6.6% are
in the additionally allowed regions. None are in the disallowed region.
Structural homology
The DIX domain has a typical β-grasp fold characteristic of
the ubiquitin superfamily. A search of the Protein Databank using the fold comparison server DALI identified
PB1 domains as structurally similar to DIX domains, sharing similar topology and, after examination of their
dimeric structures, similarity to the putative Axin DIX
homodimer evident in the crystal structure of that domain
[14]. The PB1 domains are known to form asymmetric
homodimers and/or heterodimers using acidic residues
on β-stands 3 and 4 of one domain that interact with basic
residues on β-strands 1-2 of an adjacent domain [16-18].
These interactions are conserved to the extent that consensus sequences can be defined for different PB1 types [27].
These neither match with any sequence of the DIX

domain, nor is the complementary of electrostatic surface
potentials of PB1 domains evident in the Axin DIX crystal
structure. The DIX domain may therefore represent
another example of a β-grasp fold forming homotypic
dimers, but through interactions that are not predominantly electrostatic in nature.
Evolutionary trace analysis general results
In order to determine the possible structural or functional
role of specific residues in the DIX domain, sequences of
DIX domain-containing proteins were aligned and the
observed sequence conservation mapped onto the DIX

domain structures. The alignment of available Axin,
Dishevelled and DIXdc1 proteins shows that there are
only few residues that are absolutely conserved (see Additional file 2). However, there are several residues that are
conserved within each of the families and most of these
are located on strand β4. The alignment in Additional file
2 was used to construct a dendrogram (see Additional file
3) and a trace of conservation (Figure 2). Analysis of the
mapped traces for partitions 01 to 10 reveal several buried
residues that form part of the domain's core, as well as a
large cluster of surface exposed residues centred around
the loop L4 connecting β-strands 3 and 4 (Figure 2 and

Additional file 3). Since this analysis included DIX
domain sequences from all three known families of DIXdomain containing proteins, absolutely conserved trace
residues can be considered structural and functional
determinants of the DIX fold. Traces were also derived for
the set of 31 Dishevelled homologues on their own, with
similar results to that of the larger group (data not
shown). However, noise levels were significantly higher
due to the greater sequence conservation among Dishevelled homologues. The most divergent Dishevelled
sequence known, that of the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis,
still shares 45% sequence identity with human Dishevelled. This is also evident in Additional file 3, where the
divergence of vertebrate and most invertebrate Dishevelled family members is evident only much later (P06P08) than the divergence of vertebrate and invertebrate
members of the Axin family (P02).
The higher degree of sequence conservation observed for
the DIX domain of Dishevelled may reflect the fact that it
is associated with multiple functions: DIX domain homotypic interactions, its interaction with lipids and binding
to actin [28], which might have necessitated the conservation of many residues over evolutionary time. The DIX
domain of Axin has only one reported function, homotypic DIX-DIX protein interactions, which likely allowed a
greater degree of divergence between homologues. Too
few homologues of DIXdc1 have been reported to make a
similar conclusion and the scarcity of sequence data for
this family precluded its detailed analysis.
Identification of trace residues
Partition P08 was chosen as the partition for which residues would be mapped onto the structures of the DIX
domain. In this partition almost 40% of the sequences
aligned had diverged. In later partitions, P09-10, too
many trace residues were evident to make any meaningful
predictions regarding their structural or functional importance. Twenty eight trace residues were identified within
partition P08. These are listed in Table 1 for the Axin DIX
domain and in Table 2 for the Dishevelled DIX domain.
The tables list the trace category of each residue and correlate their predicted significance with known mutagenesis
data, where available. Table 1 also lists the residues that
form crystal contacts between the adjacent DIX domain
chains in the asymmetric unit of the Axin DIX crystal
structure. Of the 28 identified trace residues in Axin, 13
were buried-conserved or buried-class-specific residues
and 15 were surface exposed-conserved or surface
exposed-class-specific residues, whereas Dishevelled had
8 residues of the former and 20 of the latter (Figure 3 and
4). Following is a detailed analysis of each of these four
trace residue categories, starting with residues that are
structurally important followed by residues that are functionally important.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/70

The absolutely conserved buried trace residues in Axin are
Y757, P765, L777, F780 and P818. The equivalent positions in Dishevelled are occupied by Y8, P16, L30, F33
and P71 (Figure 3 and 4). In Dishevelled P16 is actually
categorized as conserved, surface exposed, which likely
reflects the fact that more of it is solvent exposed, based on
the criterion stated under Methods, than in Axin. In both
structures the leucine and phenylalanine are located on
the α-helix and their side-chains project into the domain
core. The tyrosine is located on strand β1 and the second
proline on loop L5. Both form hydrophobic contacts
within the core, although the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine is surface exposed. The conserved nature of these residues in all DIX homologues suggests that they are key
structural determinants of the DIX fold, a hypothesis supported by mutagenesis data. A mutant of Axin in which
F780 was substituted with arginine is unable to form Axin
homodimers [12], whereas a mutant of Dishevelled in
which the corresponding F33 is substituted with a serine
exhibits a loss-of-function phenotype [29].
The class-specific buried residues, by virtue of their position, are also of structural importance but their nature is
not conserved among the DIX homologues. The Axin residues L817, I824 are both part of the hydrophobic core. A
mutant in which L817 is substituted with glutamic acid
cannot form Axin homodimers attesting to its importance
in maintaining the DIX fold for proper function [12]. The
remaining Axin trace residues that fall in this category
(S798, G804, V805, E809, F820, I825 and G826) are
classed as buried, but all of them are partially solvent
accessible. In Dishevelled the position corresponding to
L817 in Axin is L70, which together with V77 and S79
form part of the Dishevelled DIX core.
In contrast to the aforementioned residues, residues that
are either conserved or class-specific, but surface exposed,
may by virtue of their location at the protein surface be
important to protein function, i.e. Axin and Dishevelled
protein-protein interactions. Most of the solvent accessible trace residues, both those that are absolutely conserved and class-specific, are clustered on one side of the
domain centred on loop L4 (Figure 3 and 4), which is part
of the putative Axin dimerization interface [14]. In Axin
and Dishevelled, only 5 of the 16 and 4 of the 21 solvent
accessible trace residues are located elsewhere, respectively. While most of these residues in Axin and Dishevelled are charged or polar, there is one notable exception.
The residue F801 in Axin and the corresponding residue
in Dishevelled, F56, are highly conserved and completely
solvent exposed, being positioned on the tip of the turn of
loop L4. Although no functional data exist for this residue, the fact that this hydrophobic residue is absolutely
conserved in all 65 DIX homologues and completely solvent exposed suggests it might have a crucially important

function in DIX domains. The only conserved solvent
exposed residue for which functional data exists is V59 in
Dishevelled, the same position in Axin being V806. Substitution of V59 in Dishevelled with alanine results in a
loss-of-function Dishevelled phenotype [29]. Trace residues that fall in the conserved, surface exposed category
are all likely to be required for DIX dimerization in general, since this is the only known function that the Axin,
Dishevelled and DIXdc1 DIX domains share.
Surface exposed class-specific trace residues by definition
occupy positions of functional importance because they
are evolutionarily conserved, but their identity may vary
between homologues. Such residues can be considered to
be specificity determinants, residues that allow for specific
interactions between domains that are otherwise similar.
In the DIX domain for Axin one trace residue of this category has known functional significance (Table 1). Residue
F807 on strand β4, if substituted with arginine, inhibits
the formation of Axin homodimers [12]. The corresponding residue in the Dishevelled model structure is K60,
which is known to be required for Dishevelled DIX
homodimerization and is part of the Dishevelled lipidbinding motif [11,28,30]. Both residues are functionally
important, but are not conserved in known sequences.
Other residues in this category (Table 1 and 2) are likely
equally important to specific DIX-DIX interactions and
their substitution would likely allow the selective perturbation of these interactions (see following section).
Residues whose substitutions have no effect on DIX-DIX
homotypic interactions serve as a useful negative control
for trace analysis. Two substitutions in the DIX domain of
mouse Axin, F759R and K796A, have no effect or only a
slightly diminished ability to homodimerize [12]. Neither
of these residues is well conserved in DIX domains and
were therefore not identified as trace residues (residues
labelled # in Figure 2). This, taken together with the fact
that residues of importance to function were correctly
identified in Axin and Dishevelled, validates our analysis.

Putative functional residues
The residues that are located in the hydrophobic core of
the DIX domains, if modified, could lead to structural
changes that affect the ability of the domain to mediate
protein-protein interactions. As mentioned above, existing mutagenesis data supports this conclusion. Substitution of the conserved F780 in Axin renders it unable to
homodimerize [12] and substitution of the corresponding residue in Dishevelled, F33, exhibits a loss-of-function
phenotype [29]. These observations indicate that mutagenesis experiments aimed at investigating the function of
the DIX domain should be carefully designed bearing in
mind that some residues will contribute to the formation
of the overall fold and others to function. Trace residues
in Axin and Dishevelled that are buried and either conserved or class-specific should therefore not be mutated if
the desire is to investigate function without affecting the
fold. Instead, the residues that are surface exposed should
be selected.

Residues that are conserved and surface exposed are likely
required for DIX-DIX interactions generally, since they are
absolutely conserved and homotypic protein-protein
interaction is the only known function all three protein
families share. The trace residues likely involved in this
function are K795, F801, V806 and D813 in Axin, and residues K50, F56, V59 and D66 in Dishevelled. One exception may be K781 in Axin and K34 in Dishevelled. While
these residues fall into the conserved, surface-exposed
trace category, their role may, exceptionally, be structural
rather than functional. They do not cluster with other
trace residues at the DIX dimerization interface, but are
located on a surface roughly perpendicular to it. Since no
other trace residues cluster there, it is unlikely to represent
another functional site. Part of the lysine side chain, specifically the alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-carbon
atoms, lie along the surface of the protein, so part of the
side chain can form hydrogen bonds with underlying
hydrophobic residues. These lysine residues may therefore
seem absolutely conserved, because they shield these
underlying residues from solvent.

The DIX domain shown as a ball model in grey, with residues whose substitution are known to affect function coloured: residues involved in DIX dimerization and lipid-binding are coloured orange, the residue involved in actin binding is pale brown and
additionally identified residues are coloured olive (see Table 2). (C) The Dishevelled DIX domain rotated 90° relative to structures in A.
Class-specific residues determine the specificity of the
interaction, a conclusion that is also supported by mutagenesis data. Substitution of K60, E61 and N74 in Dishevelled and F807 in Axin all have functional consequences
(Table 1 and 2). Other exposed class-specific residues
have been implicated in Axin dimerization, but have not
been studied experimentally. Analysis of the Axin DIX
domain crystal structure implicated trace residues I764,
E800, F807, E808 and K827 in the formation of interchain contacts in the crystal structure of the Axin DIX
domain [14]. Their location is similar to that of residues
that mediate homodimerization in the structurally similar
PB1 domains. Given the good correlation between these
data and our evolutionary sequence-structure analysis, the
remaining trace residues that are so far uncharacterised
should be functionally interesting. In Axin these residues

include T768, Q779, V797, E821, E822, while in Dishevelled they are T15, V19, D32, M52, D53, D55, V58, E62,
F73, G75 and W80.
Residues not identified as trace residues
Several residues in the DIX domain of Dishevelled were
not identified in our trace analysis, but having been substituted, have a loss-of-function phenotype in Drosophila
[29] or have demonstrably lost their ability to activate
Wnt-target gene reporters [14]. In the former case the substitutions in Drosophila Dishevelled that exhibit a loss-offunction are V43E, G64V and R82Q; in the latter case the
substitution that leads to an inability to activate Wnt-target gene reporters is Y27D (residues in Figure 2 and Additional file 2 labelled with black *; the amino acid
numbering for the first three residues is that of Drosophila

Dishevelled, that of Y27 is for mouse Dishevelled 2
[14,29]). Some of these residues are poorly conserved in
DIX-domain containing proteins (see Additional file 2) or
are partially conserved within one of the three protein
families and were therefore not identified in the trace
analysis. Why do these substitutions have a phenotypic
effect? The substitution G64V is made within loop L4,
which forms part of the DIX dimerization interface. By virtue of its location on this interface close to residues mediating protein-protein interactions, it could still have an
effect on Dishevelled function. The substitution V43E, at
the C-terminal end of the α-helix, likely affects the
domain structure, because substitution of the small buried hydrophobic valine with the larger charged glutamate
may force strand β2 further form the α-helix, slightly distorting the fold. No similar structural explanation can be
offered for the effect observed for substitution R82Q or
Y27D. Both these residues are solvent-exposed, have no
obvious structural importance and are located away from
the dimerization interface. As such, they may exhibit a
loss-of-function for reasons other then the loss of the DIXDIX homotypic interaction. These two residues may perhaps be responsible for intramolecular interactions
between the DIX domain and other domains within
Dishevelled and Axin. Such interactions have been
reported [5,6,8]. In every case, these residues may not be
of general importance to DIX domain structure and function, but may be specifically important in a particular
homologue.

Structure-based multiple-sequence alignment of DIX domains from
Axin, Dishevelled and DIXdc1. Residues that are absolutely conserved
have a black background, those that are conserved in a majority of
sequences are shaded grey or light grey. The secondary structure assignment of the Axin 1 Rattus norvegicus crystal structure 1WSP is shown
above the alignment. # coloured cyan are sites of non-synonymous amino
acid substitution in Axin that have no effect on or only diminished ability
to dimerize and * coloured cyan are unable to dimerize [12]. * coloured
black are sites of non-synonymous amino acid substitution in Dishevelled
that lead to a loss-of-function [29], whereas * coloured red are residues
constituting the putative Dishevelled lipid-binding motif and * coloured
green are required for Dishevelled actin-binding [28,30]. The amino acid
number of the first and last residue of Rattus norvegicus Axin 1 and for
Homo sapiens Dishevelled 1 (DSH1) are given. Each protein sequence
is labelled with the protein name followed by the name of the species the
sequence is from. In the case of Axin and Dishevelled, the numbers after
the protein name, where present, denote orthologs. DSH, Dishevelled;

Conclusion
The sequence-structure based analysis presented here
identifies a cluster of functionally significant residues
located on loop L4 and strand β4 that contain most of the
conserved residues in DIX domains. We identify residues
that are structural and functional determinants of the DIX
domain fold and residues that likely mediate specific
homotypic interactions between Axin DIX domains and
Dishevelled DIX domains. Based on the domains structural homology to PB1 domains, which are known dimerization modules, and the observed crystal contacts
between chains in the asymmetric unit of the Axin DIX
crystal structure, it is likely that the residues clustered on
loop L4 and strand β4 constitute the dimerization interface of DIX domains in general. Existing mutagenesis data
identified several residues of functional importance at this
interface, supporting this conclusion. We predict that several other residues are also important to function. Investigating these should shed more light on the precise role of
DIX domains as dimerization modules.
