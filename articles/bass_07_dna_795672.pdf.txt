Abstract
Background: It is much debated whether microbes are easily dispersed globally or whether they,
like many macro-organisms, have historical biogeographies. The ubiquitous dispersal hypothesis
states that microbes are so numerous and so easily dispersed worldwide that all should be globally
distributed and found wherever growing conditions suit them. This has been broadly upheld for
protists (microbial eukaryotes) by most morphological and some molecular analyses. However,
morphology and most previously used evolutionary markers evolve too slowly to test this
important hypothesis adequately.
Results: Here we use a fast-evolving marker (ITS1 rDNA) to map global diversity and distribution
of three different clades of cercomonad Protozoa (Eocercomonas and Paracercomonas: phylum
Cercozoa) by sequencing multiple environmental gene libraries constructed from 47–80 globallydispersed samples per group. Even with this enhanced resolution, identical ITS sequences (ITStypes) were retrieved from widely separated sites and on all continents for several genotypes,
implying relatively rapid global dispersal. Some identical ITS-types were even recovered from both
marine and non-marine samples, habitats that generally harbour significantly different protist
communities. Conversely, other ITS-types had either patchy or restricted distributions.
Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest that geographic dispersal in macro-organisms and
microbes is not fundamentally different: some taxa show restricted and/or patchy distributions
while others are clearly cosmopolitan. These results are concordant with the 'moderate endemicity
model' of microbial biogeography. Rare or continentally endemic microbes may be ecologically
significant and potentially of conservational concern. We also demonstrate that strains with
identical 18S but different ITS1 rDNA sequences can differ significantly in terms of morphological
and important physiological characteristics, providing strong additional support for global protist
biodiversity being significantly higher than previously thought.

Background
In 1934, Baas-Becking stated with respect to microbes that
'everything is everywhere' with the important qualification 'the environment selects' [1]. This ubiquitous dispersal hypothesis (UDH) of global dispersal with transient
local occurrence is the focus of increasingly active debate
[2-5]. It is supported by many surveys of protist morphospecies on a global scale, but exceptions have been proposed [6-8]. Microbial cosmopolitanism is thought to be
driven primarily by the random dispersal pressure generated by vast population sizes of cells below a body-size of
approximately 1 mm [9]. A dependent hypothesis states
that global protist species richness is consequently relatively low, as opportunities for allopatric divergence are
limited or absent, and that the local to global species ratio
is high, theoretically approaching 1 [5]. In other words,
the diversity of microbial species found in one locality
generally represents global levels of diversity within that
habitat. However, recent molecular studies have contributed several new perspectives [7,10-16], mainly 1) that
diversity of 18S rDNA genotypes (18S-types) within morphospecies can be very high; 2) that many 18S-types have
cosmopolitan distributions, and 3) some 18S-types
within morphospecies have ecologically and/or geographically restricted distributions. These and other investigations indicate that protist morphospecies usually offer too
crude an evolutionary resolution to be ecologically
informative [17-21], reinvigorating the debate about at

what level of taxonomic distinction are protists in fact cosmopolitan [22]. Foissner and colleagues promote a moderate endemicity model [23,24], which proposes that
while some protist morphospecies have cosmopolitan
distributions, other, perhaps rarer protists have restricted
distributions. Evidence for this hypothesis is comprehensively reviewed in [25]. Our culture-independent, molecular screening approach provides a robust framework for
testing the moderate endemicity model at high phylogenetic resolution, as it does not distinguish between protists which differ in ease of propagation in the laboratory,
or ease of detection and study by microscopy.
Cercomonads are benthic heterotrophic flagellates (5–50
µm long) comprising the genera Cercomonas, Eocercomonas, and Paracercomonas [14]. They are abundant in
soils [26-28] and aquatic environments, being among the
most prominent bacterivorous protozoa. As global dispersal should theoretically be easier for marine protists, making endemicity less likely, we preferentially sampled soil
and freshwater environments to test the UDH more rigorously. As some cercomonad 18S-types are globally distributed [10,14], we used ITS1 rDNA sequences, which evolve
significantly faster than 18S rDNA sequence (Fig. 1), to
determine whether geographically restricted distributions
could be detected within cercomonad 18S-types at this
higher level of resolution. As there are hundreds of different cercomonad 18S-types [14], we used PCR primers tar-

geted to three very narrow taxonomic groups comprising
1 to 3 18S-types each (Figs 2, 3). This approach enabled us
to maximize the chances of detecting the same genotypes
in different samples even when rare. To be representative,
we targeted three different regions of the cercomonad tree
incorporating at least one genus from each of the two
main cercomonad clades (Fig. 2) [14]. Our intensive sampling of the rapidly-evolving ITS1 rDNA marker reveals
both ubiquitous and restricted distributions and thus
demonstrates that biogeography in microbes and macroorganisms differs only in degree. We also show that cercomonad strains within a single 18S-type can differ in
terms of phenotype and ecological preferences.

Results and discussion
Fig. 2 is a general tree of cercomonad diversity, showing
the positions of the three very narrow lineages targeted in
this study. In order to achieve a very intense sampling of
these lineages and avoid amplifying a vast number of
intermediate lineages (much greater than shown on this
sample tree) irrelevant to our present purpose we used
PCR primer pairs including one primer highly specific for
each narrow lineage (see Methods). Fig. 3 shows that
despite the extreme narrowness of our primer specificity
we recovered up to 18 distinct ITS-types within a single
18S-type, and that two groups (β,γ – Fig. 3C,D) have some
globally distributed ITS-types (six found in both hemispheres and three or more biogeographical regions, treating the Palaearctic as a single region). The other group (α
– Fig. 3B) was sampled from only three biogeographical
regions (Table 1), and revealed many ITS-types from two
regions but only one from all three. Most ITS-types (21 of
36) were detected only in one region. The provenances of
all 18S- and ITS-types are shown in Table 1. As more
libraries were screened within each clade, individual ITStypes were increasingly recovered from more than one
continent. This suggested that the true diversity present in
the environment remained undersampled. To explore this
further, we did two things.
Firstly, for group α, which contains the largest number of
putatively geographically restricted ITS-types, more clones
were sequenced from the libraries constructed from the
largest number of successfully amplified eDNAs (environmental DNA samples; see Methods) – those from Europe
marine and Panama marine – and those producing the
highest number of putatively 'endemic' (and incidentally
the most divergent) ITS-types – New Zealand and Australia; see Table 1. All 44 new sequences from these four
libraries matched ITS-types previously recovered; suggesting that sampling of these libraries was at or near saturation (16 ITS-types being recovered from 110 sequence
reads). One of these ITS-types (h, Fig. 3B), previously only
recovered from Panama, was thereby shown to be present
in European samples. Secondly, primers specific to subc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/162

lades of α (Fig. 3B) were designed in order to probe intensively previously untested eDNAs to determine whether
ITS types retrieved from only one or two locations in the
original analysis were in fact more widely distributed.
PCR screening and sequencing showed that clade a (Fig.
3B), previously detected only from Peru was also present
in New Zealand, although clade f, originally from Australia/New Zealand could still only be found in Australasian samples. These additional experiments show that
there was at least some undersampling in our initial data
set. Thus some ITS-types are probably actually more
widely distributed than Figs 3B–D suggests, especially for
groups β and γ where this more intensive additional sampling was not done. However, this extra sampling of
group α increased the geographic distribution for only
two clades.
Furthermore, of 21 ITS-types detected from only one biogeographical region (grey arrowheads, Fig. 3B–D), five
were retrieved from more than one library, all within
group α. Given the high level of our sampling, this suggests that these ITS-types are biogeographically restricted
(our additional sampling and lineage-specific primers
found none of these ITS-types elsewhere). It is particularly
striking that sequence DB-0505-31 on Fig. 3B was
detected in three separate freshwater Australasian libraries
and in no others. One should therefore not extrapolate
from our finding four clear examples of global ubiquity to
the conclusion that this is true of all cercomonad ITStypes. It cannot reasonably be argued that all genotypes
are both globally distributed and equally abundant on all
continents. If they were, we should easily have found DB0505-31 in libraries constructed from other continents. It
seems probable that it is either really restricted to Australasia or else dramatically more abundant there at the time
of sampling. Even the latter is contrary to the core assumptions of the UDH, unless it could be demonstrated that
none of the samples on any other continents were from
ecologically similar sites to those sampled from Australasia. It is possible that such ITS-types have a patchier distribution than those that are easily found at many sites
globally; but although patchiness combined with rarity
and undersampling might account for the restricted distribution of some of the sequences we encountered in single
libraries, it is unlikely to explain all examples of apparent
biogeographic restriction. Three of the five ITS-types
detected in more than one library but from only one biogeographical region were from Australasia. These are
shown in Figs 3B and 3C as clusters X (including DB0505-31 mentioned above) and Z. Both putative clades
are supported by multiple unique and identical sequence
motifs in conserved alignment regions of ITS1, as shown
in Fig. 4. X and Z are illustrative of the dominance of Australasian-derived sequences (12 ITS-types) in the set of 21
ITS-types recovered from only one biogeographical region

(= 57%). As is well known, Australasia is the most geographically isolated continent and shows exceptionally
high endemicity for higher animals, e.g. monotremes and
marsupials, and plants [29,30]. Perhaps it also has an
unusually high level of endemic cercomonad genotypes.
It is theoretically possible that seasonal differences in cercomonad strain occurrence and/or relative abundance
could account for some of the distribution patterns
described here. However, unpublished data from comprehensive sampling of cercomonads at several sites in the
UK suggest that if such shifts in abundance occur they
would certainly not preclude detection by the very specific
primers used in this study (Howe and Bass, unpublished).
Many, if not all, genotypes detected at these sites were
present in both winter and summer. The times of sample
collection for the present study are given in Table 1.
Nine ITS-types were recovered from both marine and nonmarine environments (Fig. 3B–D). Though only a small
proportion of the total, this suggests that the marine/non-

marine transition is unusually easy and rapid for these cercomonads. Protozoa in marine and non-marine habitats
are largely distinct [11,12]. Many major taxa are restricted
to one or the other environment: Radiozoa, Phaeodarea,
Xenophyophorea, Pelagophyceae, and most foraminiferan subgroups are exclusively marine, whereas Mycetozoa (for example) are never marine. Even in groups where
some marine/freshwater shifts have occurred, there are
many substantial subclades that are apparently exclusively
one or the other, for example in bodonids and Goniomonas [11,12,15]. Some lineages have clearly undergone
such shifts more frequently than others and are apparently more adaptable in this respect. Yet even in such
groups not all strains can be encouraged to adapt physiologically from 'marine' to 'non-marine' (or vice versa) conditions in laboratory cultures, and even where this can be
achieved there is no guarantee that it can and does happen
in nature. On present evidence the fraction of protist lineages able to live in both marine and non-marine habitats
is very small.

The unusual capacity of some cercomonads to make relatively rapid switches between marine and non-marine
environments might greatly facilitate their global dispersal. To see if an ability to grow in marine habitats is a general property of these cercomonads, we tested strains from
clades α and γ isolated from soil or freshwater in marine
media: strains XT179, NZ1.5C, XT160, EC South Africa,
5A New Zealand, and Panama 111 (all clade α), and C73,
XT196, 11.7E, and C76 (clade γ) were inoculated into
media at different concentrations, and observed for five
weeks. The results are summarized in Table 2. None of the
strains could grow in full strength seawater medium
(SWM), showing that not all strains with the same 18S
rDNA sequence can grow in both marine and non-marine
media, even though some ITS genotypes can be found in
both habitats (Fig. 3). In fact, only strain 11.7E grew at all
well in 50% SWM, although the cells were unusually inactive. All other strains tested grew very poorly or not at all
in 50% SWM, and grew with highly varying degrees of vigour in 25% SWM. Our observations, based on replicated,
standardized cultures, show that cercomonad strains with
identical 18S rDNA but different ITS1 sequences can differ
in several respects: salinity tolerance, propensity to form
cysts, vigour in standard non-saline media (growth density and persistence over time), size and basic cell morphology (Table 2). In our experiments the greatest
differences in salinity tolerance were between strains with
slightly different 18S sequences, even when the degree of
genetic difference was at or below our threshold for defining unique 18S-types. This reinforces the growing awareness that taxonomic units based on 18S rDNA identity are
at least sometimes insufficiently resolving to identify distinct ecological entities [18-21]. Given the very close
rDNA similarity between the strains studied, it appears
that the evolution of many physiologically and evolutionarily significant characters may be relatively rapid in cercomonads.
The strains used for the culture experiments were all isolated from soil and freshwater and we had no prior evidence suggesting that any could grow in marine media;
none of these cultured ITS-types correspond to those
retrieved from the libraries (also indicative of non-exhaustive sampling of ITS-types). The culture experiments suggest that some ITS-types are tolerant to a wider range of
salinity levels than others, and that there are ITS-types
which are genuinely restricted to non-marine environments. Of the 19 ITS-types detected in more than one
library, none was exclusively marine, whereas nine were
found only in non-marine libraries. This suggests a freshwater ancestry for these cercomonad groups and that only
a minority of ITS-types tolerate high salinity. Many protists persist in unfavourable environments by encysting.
Different ITS-types may also differ in propensity to form
cysts; for example in Paracercomonas ekelundi (SCCAP_C1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/162

– Table 2) they are 'formed readily' [31], whereas this is
not true of all other ITS-types within that 18S-type (Table
2). Our culture experiments also showed that cultures of
identical ITS-types were more similar to each other than
those with different ITS1 sequences in respect of a suite of
traits, which are likely to be ecologically significant (Table
2).
These observations suggest that differences in ITS
sequence may be useful as markers for identifying clearly
distinct biological/taxonomic units. It has been shown for
strains from a broad range of taxa (ciliates, green algae,
plants, sea urchins, and abalone) that boundaries of sexual compatibility appear to coincide with phylogenetic
groups defined by individual compensatory base changes
in ITS2 rDNA [32,33]. More recently, Amato et al. [34]
have shown that cryptic sister species are profuse in the
diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia, where biological species
correspond to strains with identical helix regions of ITS2.
In Pseudo-nitzschia the degree of differentiation between
strains was similar for ITS2 and ITS1, although in at least
one case divergence in ITS1 sequences was more marked
than that in ITS2 [34]. With this one exception, ITS1
sequences within a biological species were identical. If cercomonads are similar to diatoms, ciliates, and green algae
in this respect, then the majority of 'species' would have
no detectable variation in ITS1, and the majority of separate ITS1 types would be separate species. In this scenario
it would be unsurprising that distinct ITS1-types respond
differently to culture variations. However, it is not known
whether cercomonads are sexual, and there are insufficient morphological characters (without using electron
microscopy) that could be robustly related to ITS divergence. Thus biological species cannot currently be defined
for cercomonads.

Conclusion
Our study is so far unique in screening such large numbers
of globally distributed eDNAs with PCR primers so narrowly targeted as likely to include relatively few 'sibling
species'. Our data demonstrate on the one hand that global dispersal of at least some cercomonad ITS-types occurs
faster than divergences among these relatively fast-evolving markers. On the other hand, many ITS-types appear to
be more restricted in distribution; several are candidates
for being genuinely endemic to one biogeographic region.
Still more intensive sampling would be necessary to
decide whether the majority of strains found only once in
this study fall in the cosmopolitan or endemic category.
However, our results are more decisive than earlier indications in the ciliate Paramecium that one sibling species of
the P. aurelia complex may be endemic to Eurasia [35]),
whereas many are cosmopolitan. Some assertions of
endemicity in Paramecium [35] were attributable to undersampling [36]. Several species are almost certainly genu-

inely geographically restricted (i.e. not cosmopolitan;
[35,37]), though in some cases apparently because of latitudinal/climatic factors [35] rather than limited dispersibility, and thus not counter-examples to the ubiquitous
dispersal theory. Targeted species-specific environmental
DNA sampling is needed in these ciliates along the lines
of our present study to distinguish between undersampling, latitudinal/climatic geographic restriction, and genuine historically based endemicity. Thus, just as for
animals and plants, some protist species or reasonable
surrogate markers for species such as ITS genotypes are
genuinely cosmopolitan, whereas others show continental endemism. In this respect our results support the moderate endemicity model described above.
To measure true levels of endemism in microbial eukaryotes would require extensive testing of a large number of
protist groups from across the eukaryote tree with at least
as much intensity as we demonstrate in this paper. What
is now clear is that some of the perception of greater cosmopolitanism in microbes [5] is attributable to the taxonomic artefact of lumping huge numbers of genetically
very different organisms into a single crude 'morphospecies'. Our study confirms that the 18S-type, currently the
most frequently used marker for distinguishing protist
strains, is too coarse for distinguishing between ecologically and biogeographically significant units in cercomonads. The next key question is whether cercomonad ITStypes correspond to biological species. If they do, cercomonad species numbers are likely to be at least 100
times greater than yet described. Thus currently the
number of protozoan species is probably hugely underestimated.

Methods
Environmental Sampling
Globally dispersed environmental samples were collected
from soil, freshwater, and marine sediments, by different
individuals using separate collecting apparatus, and DNA
extracted under sterile conditions as described previously
[10]. Provenances of all environmental DNA extractions
(eDNAs) used in this study are shown in Table 1. In each
sampling region a range of habitats was sampled over as
broad a geographical area as possible. A broad overview of
sites is as follows. Panama: Pacific and Caribbean slopes
(coast and interior); New Zealand: North and South
Island (coast and interior); Peru: soils from both sides of
the Andes – predominantly lowland wet tropical forest;
Tasmania: soil samples from around the perimeter of the
island; British Columbia: a transect from Vancouver to the
Okanagan valley, plus the West coast of Vancouver Island;
Europe: primarily UK but also France, Germany, and
Greece. Less widespread samples were taken in India,
Japan, and Australia. The habitats sampled included wet
and dry soils, scrapings from rocks, sediments and decay-

ing material associated with mosses, freshwater sediments
and scrapings from submerged rocks, plants, and detritus,
and coastal sediments and rock scrapings.
Molecular Screening
Cercomonad clade-specific primers were designed from
culture-derived 18S rDNA alignments: forward primers
VM1B (group α) 5'-TAGTACAACGTAACCCTTGGT,
VM4B (group β) 5'-AATAGTGGGGCTTAGGCTTGCC and
VM5 (group γ) 5'-CTTAGTGAGCTTCAGAGATTGATGTACATA. Reverse primers, situated in 5.8S rDNA, were the
eukaryote-universal 369R 5'-TCGCATTACGTATCGCATTTCGCTG (first round PCR) and Bii 5'-TGCGTTCTTCATCGWTACGAG (nested PCR). The primers were
designed from a total cercomonad alignment of approximately 150 sequences to be specific to one or more cercomonad 18S-types. The phylogenetic positions of the
three groups is shown in Fig. 2 in the context of a subset
of all cercomonad lineages. The exact location of the
primer site in the SSU was determined by the existence of
regions that provided the degree of specificity required.
This degree of specificity required between groups: α comprises a single 18S-type because it was relatively frequently
represented in our database, and therefore we judged that
it would be relatively easy to find in eDNAs. β comprises
three, quite divergent, 18S-types – the interest here was
that we had only previously retrieved members of this
clade as cultures from Panama. γ comprises three very
closely related 18S-types, individually for which it would
have been effectively impossible to design reliably robust
primers. All primer sets were tested with known positives
and negatives, and a PCR protocol chosen that amplified
only sequences within those clades.

Nesting was necessary as the initial amplifications frequently produced faint/invisible bands after gel electrophoresis. PCR cycling conditions were 5 min. initial
denaturation (95°C), followed by 35 cycles of 32s at
95°C, 36s at 68°C (α), 65°C (β and γ), 1.5 min. at 72°C,
then 5 min. at 72°C. Multiple PCR products for each environment were pooled prior to separation on a 1% agarose
gel from which they were excised and cleaned using the
GFX Gel Purification Kit (GE Healthcare). The resulting
fragments were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit
(Invitrogen). At least 16 colonies were selected from each
library and sequenced as previously reported [10].
Sequences of each group were aligned manually using SEAL [38], and preliminary BioNJ trees constructed [39].
These were used to refine the environmental sequence
alignment and reduce the environmental sequence sampling (113 down to 18 group α sequences; 110 to 9 group
β; 109 to 16 group γ) and determine genotype boundaries
as described below. All effectively identical sequence copies were then removed from the alignment, leaving only

those sequences deemed to be clearly different from each
other. The length of the amplicon for each group was
dependent on the position of the group-specific (forward)
primers in the 18S rDNA, at the 5' end. The full amplicon
length was retained in the alignments for Figs 3B–D in
order to maximize tree quality. The alignment lengths
analyzed were as follows: group α = 278 positions; group
β = 414 positions; group γ = 335 positions. Final trees
were calculated using maximum likelihood (ML) with an
eight category Γ + I site rate variation model. All model
ML parameters were previously estimated using likelihood treescore from a preliminary BIONJ tree [39,40]. We
used a general time-reversible rate matrix (GTR) with six
substitution categories estimated from the alignment
using the BioNJ tree. Additional analyses was performed
by maximum parsimony with gaps coded as a 5th character state [39]. In both approaches 10 random replicate
heuristic searches with stepwise addition and TBR were
used for the topology searches (ML trees shown on Fig. 3).
100/1000 bootstrap replicates (for ML/parsimony respectively) were conducted using the same settings.
Evolutionary rate comparison (Fig. 1)
To confirm that the cercomomad ITS sequences evolve
significantly faster than any region of 18S rDNA sequence
we constructed complementary alignments for both datasets in SE-AL using all available sequences derived from
cultured representatives of the three cercomonad groups
studied. We calculated the phylogenies using parsimony
and ML as described above [39,40]. Scales of the ML
results were standardised and differences in parsimony
scored (minimum changes) for each alignment were
recorded. The length of both 18S and ITS1 alignments was
213 positions. The beginning of ITS1 was determined to
follow the end of the 18S sequence as given in [41], which
point coincided with the junction between conserved
(18S) and highly variable (ITS1) regions in our extensive
cercomonad rDNA alignment. The V4 region of 18S rDNA
was selected as the most variable region of that gene, to
provide the most appropriate comparison between the
genes and also because it is the region we use to define
unique 18S-types, in a similar way to that described for
ITS1, below.
Group α subclade-specific primers
An initial amplification was carried out with VM1B and
369R. The products of each reaction were diluted 1:10 and
used in a nested PCR with VM1B and highly specific subclade primers for the two subclades a and f on Fig. 3B.
These primers were situated in ITS1 rDNA to provide the
necessary high degree of specificity. The PCR protocols
were optimimzed in the same way as described for α-, β-,
γ-specific primers. For clade a, two specific primers were
used, a1 and a2, the latter being used in a second nested
PCR step using the diluted products of the VM1B-a1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/162

amplification. The corresponding primer sequences are
a1: 5'-ATTATCAGTTAAAGGCTTTCGCCTAG; a2: 5'-ACAGAATCCCTCATCGCTAGGATG (clade a, originally
detected only from Peru); f (clade f, originally detected
only from New Zealand and Australia): 5'-AGAGAGAAGCGGGCCATAACAC. Following PCR optimization
of each primer set using known positives and negatives,
primer sets a and f were each used to probe eight eDNAs
from four locations: Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania,
and Panama, including the eDNA from which bands were
obtained using the VM1B-Bii set. The PCR products from
each location were pooled separately and run on a gel.
Primer f produced a band only for Australasian region
samples, whereas primer a2 (following nesting) produced
bands for both Australia and Panama (no bands for either
were seen after the first nested PCR using a1). The two visible bands were cloned and sequenced, yielding only the
identical ITS-type to which they were designed. This suggests that a double nesting PCR approach (i.e. three serial
amplifications in all) can be necessary when probing with
such specificity, probably because of the low concentrations in environmental samples of some individual ITS
types.
Estimation of clonal variation in rDNA cistrons and PCR/
sequencing error
As a control for properly interpreting whether observed
differences in ITS could be caused by polymorphic differences among the many copies within a single genome
and/or by PCR/sequencing errors, we made rDNA libraries from clonal cultures and measured intra-clonal differences in the resulting alignment for two phylogenetically
distant cercomonad strains (Cercomonas sp. 'AZ6' ATCC
50418 &Cercomonas C59 [14]). For each strain 24 clones
were sequenced on both strains along the full amplicon
length. The sequence difference percentage was calculated
by dividing the total number of mismatches by (24 ×
number of alignment positions) then multiplying by 100.
The distribution of sequence variation in the alignment is
shown in Table 3, which shows that sequence variation
caused by combined PCR nucleotide incorporation error
and intra-clonal rDNA polymorphism is low (mean =
0.1%) and that the more rapidly evolving regions of the
gene are not more variable in this respect than relatively
conserved regions. It is not possible to distinguish
between actual intra-nuclear differences between gene
copies and nucleotide misincorporation errors during the
initial PCR. However, this approach estimates or overestimates the upper limit of intra-nuclear polymorphism levels and provides a measure of the total intrinsic level of
errors generated by our methodology. The alignments
were created from an initial PCR amplification of DNA
extracted from each culture using the cercozoan-specific
primer 1259F (5'-GGTCCRGACAYAGTRAGGATTGACAGATTGAAG) and the eukaryote-universal primer 28Sr1

sequencing were 1259F, 369R, pre-Bf (5'-GTAGGTGAACCTGCAGAAGGATC) and 1733R (5'-TGATCAAGTTTGATTCAGTTCTCGGAT).
Definition of unique genotypes
The threshold of divergence used for defining unique genotypes was much higher than divergence due to combined
errors, which were measured as described in the preceding
section. The standard requirement for two genotypes to be
considered distinct from one another was at least four differences within the most variable positions of their ITS1
sequences. A degree of subjectivity regarding these decisions was allowed, depending on the degree of variability
of the exact region of the alignment in which they
occurred. However, these decisions always erred on the
side of stringency and it is likely that we have underestimated the total number of ITS-types detected in this study.
If so, this would mean that on average, we overestimate the
degree of cosmopolitanism of each ITS-type. Single nucleotide differences in conserved regions of the alignment
were discounted as likely sequencing errors and/or polymorphic sites. One example of each unique ITS-type produced by this study has been deposited in GenBank
(Accession numbers EF174336-EF174385).
PCR recombination (chimaera formation)
Chimaeric sequences are caused by DNA template switching between PCR cycles. We took the following precautions to eliminate chimaeras from our dataset. 1) Our
amplicons were as short as possible, and PCR extension
times were set for at least three times as long as necessary
(this was determined empirically). Chimaera formation
frequency is relatively low in each experiment [10] and is
minimal where amplicon length is small and extension
time is long. 2) The short ITS1 region was scanned in
order to check that the sequence variability and signature
sequences were consistent along its length. If a PCR
recombination event had occurred it would be easily
detectable. 3) Identical sequences recovered from more
than one library were deemed non-chimaeric. The likelihood of the exact same chimaera being produced in inde-

pendent libraries on multiple occasions is extremely
remote.
Culturing
To test whether monoclonal cercomonad strains isolated
from non-marine environments can grow in marine
media, we inoculated strains from clades α and γ into the
following culture media: Volvic mineral water (Danone)
enriched with a sterile (boiled) barley grain; 100% Artificial Sea Water (ASW; CCAP recipe); 50% ASW; and 25%
ASW. 12 days after the initial inoculations 1 ml of each
strain's culture was inoculated as follows: 100% ASW into
50% ASW and vice versa, to test whether viable forms of
each strain persisted in 100% ASW even when they could
not be seen, and in the second case, to test whether strains
were growing (or at least moving around) in 50% ASW
had acclimatized to the degree to which they could persist
in 100% ASW. Observations reported in Table 2 were
made from these experimental cultures and others of the
same strains examined over the previous 18 months. Cultures used for these experiments are marked with open circles in Fig. 1. No cultures from clade β were used as they
are all dead.
