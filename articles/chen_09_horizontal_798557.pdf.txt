Abstract
Background: The universal ribosomal protein S4 is essential for the initiation of small subunit
ribosomal assembly and translational accuracy. Being part of the information processing machinery
of the cell, the gene for S4 is generally thought of as being inherited vertically and has been used in
concatenated gene phylogenies. Here we report the evolution of ribosomal protein S4 in relation
to a broad sharing of zinc/non-zinc forms of the gene and study the scope of horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) of S4 during bacterial evolution.
Results: In this study we present the complex evolutionary history of ribosomal protein S4 using
660 bacterial genomes from 16 major bacterial phyla. According to conserved characteristics in the
sequences, S4 can be classified into C+ (zinc-binding) and C- (zinc-free) variants, with 26 genomes
(mainly from the class Clostridia) containing genes for both. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree
of the S4 sequences was incongruent with the standard bacterial phylogeny, indicating a departure
from strict vertical inheritance. Further analysis using the genome content near the S4 genes, which
are usually located in a conserved gene cluster, showed not only that HGT of the C- gene had
occurred at various stages of bacterial evolution, but also that both the C- and C+ genes were
present before the individual phyla diverged. To explain the latter, we theorize that a gene pool
existed early in bacterial evolution from which bacteria could sample S4 gene variants, according
to environmental conditions. The distribution of the C+/- variants for seven other zinc-binding
ribosomal proteins in these 660 bacterial genomes is consistent with that seen for S4 and may shed
light on the evolutionary pressures involved.
Conclusion: The complex history presented for "core" protein S4 suggests the existence of a gene
pool before the emergence of bacterial lineages and reflects the pervasive nature of HGT in
subsequent bacterial evolution. This has implications for both theoretical models of evolution and
practical applications of phylogenetic reconstruction as well as the control of zinc economy in
bacterial cells.

Background
The ribosome is an elaborate ribonucleoprotein complex
whose evolution is intrinsically linked with that of the
cell. It has been recognized since the 1970's that the
molecular core of the ribosome was in place before the
divergence of the three primary organismal lineages, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucarya (the domains of life). The history of these lineages, as inferred from the ribosomal RNA
(rRNA) and represented by the universal phylogenetic tree
(UPT) [1], provides an organismal reference by which the
evolutionary history of a gene can be studied. Despite
conservation of a large portion of the ribosomal structure
among the lineages, the ribosomes of each domain of life
contain certain sequence and structural signatures that are
unique to and constant within the domain. Such signatures have been identified in both the rRNA and ribosomal proteins (r-proteins), including many r-proteins
that are specific to one of the primary lineages. This suggests that both large and small scale changes in the ribosome were still evolving after the domains diverged and
then spreading among all of a domain's developing subbranches [2]. The exact mechanism by which homogenization of the branches might have occurred is unclear and
certainly a matter of some debate, but pervasive horizontal gene transfer (HGT) among aboriginal cellular life
[3,4] is one possible mechanism. Studying the pattern by
which such a signature spread among the evolving lineages can help resolve the dynamics of the evolutionary
process at the time.
Horizontal gene transfer, the acquisition of non-inherited
genetic material, is widely regarded as a common and
important evolutionary phenomenon [5-10]. It is now
understood that HGT allows microorganisms to break out
of strictly clonal, bifurcating lineages in their search for
genetic innovation [11]. Despite the complexity of the
ribosome and the potential for malfunction from acquiring a new version of a single ribosomal component, r-protein genes are known to have been horizontally
transferred within a domain of life, although no interdomain HGT has been identified. The first instance of
HGT of an r-protein gene was reported by Brochier et al.
[12] for S14. In their study, they classified the bacterial
S14 sequences into distinct groups based on characteristic
insertions/deletions (indels) and presented phylogenetic
evidence that, in some cases, the groups were at odds with
the classical bacterial phylogeny. They argued that these
discrepancies, as well as unusual gene ordering and duplications in the affected lineages, were the result of ancient
HGT events. Thus, they proposed that there must have
been some evolutionary pressure favoring the fixation of
the transferred r-protein gene, in accordance with the
"complexity hypothesis" of Jain et al. [13] regarding the
lower probability of HGT for informational genes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/179

A later bioinformatics study further extended analysis of
HGT and gene duplication in the r-proteins. Using
genomes of thirty bacteria and genomic data for r-proteins
of mitochondria and chloroplasts from seven eukaryotic
organisms, Makarova et al. [14] found six additional
ribosomal proteins (S18, L28, L31, L32, L33, L36) that
shared similar evolutionary patterns to S14 within the
bacterial lineage, including discrepancies in genome
organization and gene copy number. Furthermore, they
showed that the phylogenetic patterns were related to the
zinc binding ability of the r-proteins. Two variants were
found of each r-protein: one containing a zinc finger motif
with four conserved cysteine residues (or occasionally
three cysteine and one histidine residue) and another with
a complete or partial disruption of the motif. The two variants were referred to as C+ and C-, respectively. Their data
suggested that in each case the C+ variant was the ancestral form and that ancient gene duplication followed by
disruption of the zinc finger in the paralog and later loss
of the original C+ gene in some lineages (differential gene
loss; DGL) was the major evolutionary pattern with HGT
also occasionally occurring.
Following initial identification of C- variants of bacterial
zinc-binding r-proteins, other laboratories began investigating their regulation in organisms with both C+ and Cgenes to better understand the evolutionary pressures giving rise to the C- forms. It was predicted theoretically [15]
and then found experimentally, first in Bacillus subtilis for
S14 and L31 [16,17] and then in Streptomyces coelicolor for
S14, L28, L31, L32, L33, and L36 [18] and in Mycobacterium tuberculosis for S14, S18, L28, and L33 [19], that the
paralogous C- versions of some r-protein genes were upregulated under conditions of low zinc. These groups proposed that the C- paralogs served two possible functions,
release of free zinc into the cell in low zinc environments
(by ribosomal exchange with the endogenous C+ protein)
and/or continued production of ribosomes under zinclimiting conditions. Whether these are the only pressures
that gave rise to the C- forms is unknown, but it is clear
that some ribosomal proteins have a unique and interesting evolutionary history related to zinc binding.
All seven zinc binding r-proteins discussed above, except
for S14, are unique to Bacteria. Such domain specific rproteins are signatures of the bacterial ribosome. Roberts
et al. [2] showed that the signatures are not limited to just
entire domain specific ribosomal proteins, but can also
take the form of domain specific insertions in the r-proteins that are universally distributed among all three
domains of life. Such a case is found in the universal rprotein S4, a two domain protein ~200 amino acids in
length that is essential for the initiation of small subunit
(SSU) ribosomal assembly and translational accuracy. The

C-terminal domain of S4 (residues 46–206; all residues
given in terms of Escherichia coli numbering) is known to
be an RNA binding domain, binding to both rRNA and
messenger RNA (mRNA) [20-22], and is homologous
between Bacteria and Archaea. While the overall sequence
identity for the C-terminal domain is only 36% among
bacteria and 32% across all domains of life, the region
making contact with the ribosomal RNA is conserved with
an average sequence identity of 46% and 40% respectively. The N-terminal domain, in contrast, appears to be
non-homologous between Bacteria and Archaea and was
identified in [2] as a bacterial-specific structural signature
that coevolved with a bacterial specific extension of an
RNA helix (helix h16) on the 16S rRNA. Alone, the bacterial S4 structure has been determined only without the
unstructured N-terminus [23], but when complexed with
the ribosome the structure of the full protein has been
determined. The crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus ribosome [24] shows that the N-terminal
domain of S4 contains a zinc finger motif ligated to a zinc
atom and the sequence analysis presented here shows
conservation of the four cysteine residues in the zinc-finger motif only in a subset of the bacterial lineages. This
variation in zinc binding ability within the bacterial lineages of S4 was overlooked in previous studies of the evolutionary history of zinc-binding r-proteins.
The recent growth in the number of available bacterial
genome sequences allows a broad evolutionary history of
a gene to be reconstructed, especially in regard to HGT
[25,26]. Besides sequence data for phylogenetic reconstructions, full genomes provide data on genome organization and gene distribution, which are particularly useful
in aiding interpretation of possible HGT events. In this
study, we use 660 available bacterial genomes to study the
evolution of ribosomal protein S4 in the bacteria. We find
that S4 can be classified into C+ and C- variants (zinc
binding and non-zinc binding, respectively), with multiple independent origins of the C- form. A maximum likelihood tree of S4 shows disagreement with the standard
bacterial phylogeny, indicating a more complex evolutionary history than previously known. Considering the
fact that the S4 gene is part of a highly conserved gene
cluster in bacteria consisting of the S10-spc-α operons
[27], we see surprising evidence for the endogenous origin
of the C- form in some phyla and hypothesize that both
the C+ and C- forms may have been present before the
bacterial phyla diverged with different lineages sampling
from the variants according to the local environment. In
accordance with this hypothesis, we also present evidence
that C- paralogous copies in genomes containing both
variants of S4, as well as all S4 genes outside the α-operon,
are results of HGT events. Regulation of the paralogous S4
genes seems to differ from the zinc-binding r-proteins previously identified, and the expanded distribution of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/179

C+/C- variants in all the zinc-binding r-proteins we
present may provide insight on the evolution of zinc
usage in bacterial lineages.

Results
Sequence alignment and classification of bacterial rprotein S4
To study the history of S4 in bacteria, we first extracted
688 sequences of S4 and paralogs from 660 complete and
draft bacterial genomes (complete list in Additional File
1). We then constructed a multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) of the sequences using automated alignment tools
followed by manual correction (see Methods). Any evolutionary study of a large set of diverse organisms is likely to
reveal a complex history, so to aid further analysis of the
relationships between the sequences we classified them
into six types using key sequence and structural signatures
that define apparently monophyletic groups (such features are also known as synapomorphies). These types
classify the sequences according to the presence of or disruption pattern in the zinc finger motif. We find one C+
version (with four conserved cysteines) and five C- subtypes (with various patterns of loss of the zinc finger). C(I), C-(II) and C-(III) sequences possess a seven residue
indel present in the C+ type but show gradual loss of the
four cysteines (from two to one to zero). C-(IV) and C-(V)
subtypes are missing the indel characteristic of the C+ type
as well as all four cysteines. Further distinctions between
the C- subtypes are based on sequence signatures in the Nterminus. Figure 1 shows a sample of the N-terminal portion of the alignment from all of the major bacterial phyla
grouped according to these classifications.

From a conservation analysis of the MSA, it is apparent
that the S4 sequences can be broadly classified into C+
and C- variants (following the notation introduced by
Makarova et al. [14]) based on the conservation of four
cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain. C+ type
sequences contain two conserved pairs of cysteine residues in a "CXXC...CXXXXC" motif. The first pair appears
near the beginning of the sequence (at residues 9 and 12)
and the second pair in a seven residue segment that is an
insertion relative to most of the C- sequences (the first red
block in Figure 1). As shown in the T. thermophilus ribosome structure, these four cysteine residues bind a zinc ion.
Within the C+ group, the N-terminal domain is highly
conserved with an average percent sequence identity of
65%. The C+ group includes sequences from diverse bacteria groups: Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi,
Clostridia, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria (Beta and Delta classes) and Thermotogae.
The C- variants of S4 show less homogeneity than their C+
counterparts. By definition, they all lack the four cysteine

residues, but other characteristic features in the N-terminus allow them to be further classified according to their
likely evolutionary origin. The major distinguishing feature between the C-forms is the presence or absence of the
seven residue indel that contains the second pair of
cysteine residues in the C+ form. Three C- types, C-(I), C(II), and C-(III), possess the indel, but have disruption of
the zinc binding motif. Each of these types is confined to
a small portion of the bacterial tree, while sequences containing the indel with the conserved cysteine residues are
seen in a wide variety of bacteria. This difference suggests
that each of these three groups may have been formed by

relatively recent, independent mutations of an ancestral
C+ form.
To test this hypothesis, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the sequences in the C-(I), C-(II), and C-(III)
groups relative to the C+ sequences. The first group, C-(I),
includes the S4 sequences from most of Betaproteobacteria
and all of Gammaproteobacteria. The remaining Betaproteobacteria are all of the C+ type, and, interestingly, the C-(I)
Betaproteobacteria show a gradual loss of the four cysteine
residues from two to one and, finally, to zero. The Gammaproteobacteria also show a distribution of two, one, or

zero cysteine residues. The C-(I) sequences have also lost
a three residue turn (the second red block in Figure 1)
compared to all of the other variants of S4. Figure 2 shows
a maximum-likelihood (ML) reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of S4 in Proteobacteria except Alphaproteobacteria, which lack the seven residue indel. In the tree,
Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria share a common ancestor
containing the C+ variant of S4 and the root of the Proteobacteria also appears to have been a C+ type S4. The most
parsimonious explanation for the origin of the C-(I) form

The C-(II) group contains all and exclusively sequences
from the Epsilonproteobacteria. These sequences do contain
the three residue turn that the C-(I) Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria sequences are missing. Additionally, the pattern of disruption in the zinc-binding motif is markedly
different from the C-(I) group. In C-(II) sequences, the
four cysteine residues are consistently replaced by two
glutamic acid residues, one arginine residue, and one serine residue, as opposed to the variety of residues seen in
C-(I). differences in both the pattern of indels and of
motif disruption suggest an independent origin for the C(II) form and phylogenetic analysis supports this interpretation. In the tree shown in Figure 2, Epsilonproteobacteria
branches outside of the C-(I) group, appearing to diverge
near the root of Proteobacteria. The low bootstrap values at
higher branch points do cast uncertainty as to whether
Epsilonproteobacteria diverged from a common Proteobacteria ancestor or directly from the bacterial root. In either
case, however, the C-(II) sequences would be a result of an
independent mutation event in an ancestral C+ form that
occurred after the divergence of the Epsilonproteobacteria
lineage. Conservation of the "EXXE...RXXXXS" motif suggests that a salt bridge may have replaced the zinc finger as
a structural element in the C-(II) S4 sequences, and
threading of an epsilonproteobacterial sequence onto the
T. thermophilus crystal structure of S4 confirms that the residues would be properly oriented.
The final C- type containing the seven residue indel, C(III), is made up of S4 sequences from a subset of Spirochetes: the genus Leptospira. All other Spirochetes currently
sequenced lack the indel in r-protein S4. C-(III) sequences
have a zinc disruption pattern of "VXXM...LXXXXS" or
"VXXM...FXXXXF" and do have the three residue turn
missing in C-(I). Additionally, there are numerous
sequences signatures separating the C-(III) sequences
from those in either group C-(I) or C-(II). Phylogenetically, these sequences appear to branch directly from the
root of the C+ form, no further relationships can be
resolved. Since the C-(III) group appears to monophyletically descend from an ancestral C+ form, we consider that
it too was an independent evolution of zinc disruption in
S4.
All of the remaining S4 C- sequences lack the seven residue indel and both pairs of cysteine residues. C-(IV), the
largest C- group, consists of r-protein S4 sequences from a
wide variety of bacteria: Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria,

Aquificae, Bacilli, Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria, Chlamydiae, Chlorobia, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, DeinococcusThermus, Deltaproteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Mollicutes, Planctomycetes, Spirochaetes, and Verrucomicrobia. The N-terminal domains of the C-(IV) sequence are much less
conserved than the C+ form, having an average percent
identity of 36%, and do not contain any characteristic
sequence or structural signatures by which they could be
further classified.

A small number of Clostridia sequences (17) constitutes
the last defined type, C-(V). These C- sequences lack the
seven residue indel, but are different from C-(IV)
sequences (and all other S4 sequences) in that they are
missing a "PGXHG" motif starting at residue 38. This
motif is highly conserved in the other S4 sequences and is
unambiguously alignable across all other groups. In C-(V)
Clostridia sequences, this region is 2–4 residues shorter
and can not be reliably aligned to the other types. All but

one of the S4 sequences in this group are from genomes
that also contain a C+ type S4.
Phylogenetic reconstruction of S4's evolutionary history
The evolutionary history of S4 was analyzed using a ML
phylogenetic reconstruction of all the sequences of r-protein S4 and its paralogs obtained from the 660 genomes,
as described in Methods. Figure 3 shows an unrooted phylogenetic tree obtained from a consensus of 1000 ML
trees. Like many phylogenetic reconstructions using a
large number of sequences, branch points above the bacteria phyla level are difficult or impossible to reliably
determine [28] and most branches appear to radiate from
a few ancestral points in our consensus tree. Trees of the
C-terminal RNA binding domain and the N-terminal bacterial specific domain were also generated separately using
the same method (data not shown). The C-terminal tree
had similar branchings as the tree shown in Figure 3, but
with fewer well-supported branches near the bacterial
root. The N-terminal domain, however, is too short to
draw any reliable conclusions regarding its relative contribution to the phylogenetic signal.

The consensus phylogenetic tree of the entire protein
shows good agreement with the classifications of S4 that
we introduced earlier. It is roughly divided into two central foci, one representing the C+ form (white) and the
other the C-(IV) form (blue), although a few C-(IV) lineages branch within the C+ half. C-(I), C-(II), and C-(III)
(gray) are recent, independent mutations of an original
C+ form (discussed above), and we treat them as C+ for
the remainder of the discussion. The C-(V) form (yellow)
is a monophyletic branch descending from the C-(IV)
root.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/179

Comparing the S4 phylogenetic tree with the classical bacterial phylogeny, many bacterial groups show good agreement with the tree at the phyla level: The phyla Aquificae,
Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae, Tenericutes (Mollicutes) and Verrucomicrobia in the C-(IV) branch and Acidobacteria, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Deinococcus-Thermus, Fusobacteria, and
Thermotogae in the C+ branch are all monophyletic with
high support values in the tree. A few other groups, most
notably the Proteobacteria and the Firmicutes, are monophyletically supported at the class level. Proteobacteria
classes Beta/Gamma-, Delta-, and Epsilonproteobacteria
independently meet at the root of the C+ branch, while
Alphaproteobacteria originates in the C-(IV) branch. In the
Firmicutes, Clostridia (non-paralogs) branches from C+
while Bacilli branches from C-(IV). The remaining bacteria
phyla, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, and
Spirochaetes, have more convoluted branching patterns,
with members branching in either the C+ or C-(IV) group
with little regard for classical phylogeny. Disagreement
with the classical bacterial phylogeny is an indication that
a process more complex than standard vertical inheritance
occurred with r-protein S4 during bacterial evolution.

Within the C+ branch of the tree, three bacteria phyla are
monophyletic with high support values and yet contain
both C+ and C-(IV) forms: Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and
Deinococcus-Thermus. In each case, there are two branches
descending from the phylum that are monophyletic, one
with respect to C+ and one to C-(IV). Despite the
sequences in each C+ branch containing the seven residue
indel characteristic of the C+ group and sequences in each
C-(IV) branch lacking the indel, the branches have a
higher average sequence identity (56%, 46%, 60%,
respectively) than in general would be expected for a C+
and a C-(IV) group (~40%). We therefore consider it likely
that these are real phylogenetic branches and not artifacts,
particularly for Actinobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus.

Identification of paralogous and duplicated S4 genes
A key element that led to the identification of HGT and
gene duplication with DGL in previous bacterial r-proteins was the analysis of genomes containing multiple
copies of the r-protein genes [14]. Among the 660 bacterial genomes in our study, 26 organisms from the groups
Clostridia, Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes and Planctomycetes possess more than one copy of the S4 gene (marked
with a dagger symbol on the tree in Figure 3). Most have
two copies, as shown in Table 1, and normally one copy
is a C+ form and the other a C-(IV) or C-(V). Two
Clostridia, Alkaliphilus metalliredigens and Clostridium acetobutylicum, have three copies of the S4 gene, both have one
C+ and two C-(V) variants. The genomes of Methylobacillus
flagellatus, Psychromonas ingrahamii, and Leptospira borgpetersenii do not match the above pattern in that both
genes are of the same type. However, in each of these three
cases the sequence identities of the two copies are
extremely high, 100%, 99%, and 100%, respectively.
These cases are undoubtedly recent gene duplication
events. In fact, P. ingrahamii and L. borgpetersenii have
duplicated a large segment of their conserved operon cluster. M. flagellatus is known to have a large 140 kbp repeat
in its genome [29], this repeated region contains the S4
gene.

Also within the C+ branch, the C-(IV) Chlorobi and C+
Epsilonproteobacteria group together, with an average percent identity of 50%. However, the Chlorobi sequences
have nearly as high average percent identity with C-(IV)
groups (46%) and the support value of 52 is fairly low, so
this grouping may be a reconstruction artifact.

Usually in a case of two divergent copies of a gene in a
genome, one copy is the original and the other a paralog,
either from an ancient gene duplication or from an HGT
event. Without experimental evidence of activity, determining which is the active gene and which the paralog can
often be problematic. In the case of r-protein S4, however,

the genome content can provide evidence to make a determination: many ribosomal protein genes in bacteria are
known to be located in conserved gene clusters. The gene
for S4 is usually located in a cluster along with the genes
for ribosomal proteins S13, S11, and L17 and the gene for
the RNA polymerase alpha subunit, which together are
known as the α-operon because they are co-regulated in E.
coli. If two copies of the S4 gene are present in a genome
with one copy inside the α-operon and the other outside
it, we assume the copy inside the α-operon is the original
form and the other the paralog. In every genome containing two divergent S4 genes, the C+ form is located in the αoperon and the C-(IV) or C-(V) form outside. Using the
above criteria, we conclude that the C+ form is the original S4 sequence and the C- form the paralog in these
genomes. It then remains to determine the origin of the
paralogous C- sequences, whether by HGT or gene duplication.

phylogenetic tree in Figure 3 and C+ genes in the αoperon. Since the vast majority of Beta- and Deltaproteobacteria have only a single C+ copy of S4, we consider it
unlikely that this pattern resulted from an ancient gene
duplication that was lost in all Beta- and Deltaproteobacteria except these four organisms. Given the high support
values near the branch with Cyanobacteria, we find it more
likely that these organisms obtained the gene through a
horizontal transfer from Cyanobacteria, although the S4
sequence is not similar enough to any available sequences
for the specific source organism to be determined. Betaproteobacteria species M. flagellatus, which possesses only two
copies of C-(IV) outside of the α-operon, also groups
nearby in the tree and also likely received its C-(IV) S4
gene from Cyanobacteria before its large-scale genome
duplication occurred. It must have lost its original C+
gene subsequent to the HGT, as it is no longer present in
the α-operon.

One clear-cut case of HGT appears to have occurred in the
Proteobacteria. One Beta- and three Deltaproteobacteria have
S4 paralogs that group within the C-(IV) branch of the

Another example of probable HGT, albeit with a more
complex pattern, is seen in the Clostridia. All Clostridia
except one, Finegoldia magna, contain the gene for the C+

form of S4 in the α-operon. Fifteen Clostridia also contain
a gene for the C-(V) form of the S4 sequence. Figure 4
shows an expansion of these two Clostridia branches from
the consensus phylogenetic tree. In the C+ branch, all of
the organisms with multiple copies of S4 are descended
from a single branch. If we assume that the C+ form represents the vertical phylogeny in this group, then the pattern is consistent with either a single HGT event in the
ancestor of the Clostridium and Alkaliphilus genera with
later differential loss in a few branches; or with three later
HGT events, one for Alkaliphilus, a second for Clostridium
perfringens, and a third for the branch containing the
organisms Clostridium botulinum/kluyveri/acetobutylicum/
novyi. However, two organisms possess three copies of the
S4 gene, and the percent identities between the two C-(V)
copies are 60.3% and 54.3% for A. metalliredigens and C.
acetobutylicum, respectively. So there may have been an
additional recent HGT of the transferred C-(V) gene. The
support values are too low to allow a determination the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/179

source of this recent HGT, but additional genomes of
related organisms could shed light on the history of the C(V) form of S4.
In the two remaining lineages with genomes containing
multiple S4 genes, multiple occurrences are relatively rare.
Of the four Planctomycetes genomes available, one contains both the C+ gene in the α-operon and C-(IV) out of
it while the other three contain only C-(IV) out of the
operon. The low number of available Planctomycetes
genomes sequenced makes it impossible to reconcile the
origin of the paralog using a parsimony argument. In the
Actinobacteria, the three genomes with two copies of the
S4 gene can be accounted for by two recent HGT events
(see Figure 5), one in the Salinispora genus and the other
in the species Frankia sp. EAN1pec. Both of these paralogous genes appear to have originated in a Streptomyces
source. The two Salinispora species also have acquired paralogs of five other zinc-binding r-proteins.
Regulation of C- S4 paralogs
To fully understand the evolutionary pressure giving rise
to paralogous genes, it is helpful to know their regulation
mechanism, especially when the two copies have similar

functions. For the previously known zinc-binding ribosomal proteins, experiments on specific bacteria have
shown that the paralogs can be turned on and off in
response to zinc conditions. In B. subtilis (S14, L31) [17],
M. tuberculosis (S14, S18, L28, L33) [19], and S. coelicolor
(S14, L28, L31, L32, L33A, L33B, L36) [18], the C- paralogs were found to be expressed only under low zinc conditions. Their regulation was controlled by the zinc uptake
regulator (Zur) transcription factor, except for L33B and
L36 in S. coelicolor, the regulation of which was controlled
by a sigma factor (σR).
The established Zur binding-sites from Actinobacteria,
Bacilli and Proteobacteria are AT-rich palindromes found
upstream from the genes being regulated [15,18,19].
Using a profile of Zur binding motifs from these bacterial
groups, we searched the 26 genomes containing multiple
copies of the S4 gene (from Actinobacteria, Clostridia and
Beta/Deltaproteobacteria) for candidate Zur binding sites
(see Methods). We were able to identify Zur binding sites
upstream of the gene cluster of r-proteins L33, S14 and
L28 and upstream of the paralogous genes of both L31
and L32 in Salinispora arenicola and Salinispora tropica, but
no binding sites were found near the paralogous S4 genes.
Neither were Zur binding sites found near ribosomal protein paralogs in the remaining genomes. Unfortunately, a
Zur binding motif has not yet been reported for Clostridia,
which comprises most of the genomes with paralogous
copies of the S4 gene. Therefore, we can not exclude the
possibility that the paralogous copies of S4 in Clostridia
are regulated by Zur binding to a motif different from any
in our profile.
However, according to gene expression data from two separate genomic-scale gene expression experiments in C.
acetobutylicum [30] and Clostridium novyi [31], the paralogous C-(V) genes are not expressed under normal growth
conditions but are up-regulated during sporulation. This
leaves open the possibility that the C-(V) genes are related
to some aspect of ribosomal function during sporulation
and not used to regulate the zinc environment in
Clostridia. If the C-(V) S4 proteins are indeed incorporated
into ribosomes in clostridial spores, it would be interesting to examine any changes to these ribosomes, such as
altered structure or changes in the assembly process.
Comparison of genome content near S4
Having used genome context in the analysis of several
cases of horizontal transfer, we next examined the genome
regions near S4 and the α-operon in the genomes of the
bacteria without multiple copies looking for conserved
patterns. Overall, the organization of the α-operon and
nearby genes is highly conserved across a large number of
bacterial groups. Many of the genomes have the conserved
consensus gene cluster shown in Figure 6A, containing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/179

genes for initiation factor A (infA), L36, S13, S11, S4, RNA
polymerase subunit A (rpoA) and L17. Variations are
mainly seen in Gammaproteobacteria and Magnetococcus,
which do not have infA near the cluster. Intriguingly,
genes for both the C+ and C-(IV) forms of S4 can be found
in the α-operon (green background in Figure 3). In fact,
eight phyla have the gene for the C-(IV) form located in
the α-operon, including all three of the phyla containing
closely branching C+ and C-(IV) forms (Actinobacteria,
Chloroflexi and Deinococcus-Thermus). Five other phyla,
Aquificae, Bacteroidetes, Chlorobi, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, contain only the C-(IV) form in the operon.
The remaining bacterial genomes, still covering a diverse
set of bacteria, contain only an S4 gene of the C-(IV) form
that is not located within the α-operon (red background
in Figure 3). Figure 6B and 6C shows examples of the
genomic context of the α-operon and the S4 gene, respectively, in these genomes. The organization of the genes
remaining in the α-operon is unperturbed, but the context
around the S4 gene is variable. Conservation of organization near the S4 gene can only be seen at the level of order
or family; no correlations with the organization of any
other genes could be detected at higher levels of taxonomy. When not located in the α-operon, the gene for S4
appears to be quite mobile.

Discussion
The ancestral form of S4 in the bacteria
Given the widespread occurrence of C-(IV) genes within
the α-operon (see Figure 7), one must question the
hypothesis that the C+ zinc-binding form of S4 is ancestral in the bacteria. If the C-(IV) form were a result of a single ancient gene duplication of a C+ gene, one would have
expected to find nearly all of C-(IV) genes located outside
of the α-operon. Instead, five classical bacteria phyla contain exclusively the C-(IV) gene in the α-operon. Moreover, three bacteria phyla contain monophyletic branches
of both the C+ and C-(IV) genes, each organized in the
typical α-operon style. Although it is known that horizontally transferred genes can replace their native copies in
the genome, so called in situ gene displacement [32], such
occurrences are still thought of as exceptions rather than
the rule. The number of in situ displacements required to
achieve the current distribution of C-(IV) genes in the αoperon would require replacement events of a much
higher frequency or different character than that previously reported.

We propose instead that neither C+ nor C-(IV) is the sole
ancestral form of S4 and interpret the data as implying the
presence of both forms during the time when the bacterial
lineages were diverging. The developing bacterial lineages
would have sampled S4 genes from the bacterial pool
according to some unknown criteria, perhaps related to

the local environment (e.g., thermophilic organisms
acquiring the zinc-binding form for added stability).
While this sampling would have been functionally equivalent to HGT with in situ gene displacement, in that the
gene order would be maintained, it would not have necessarily been mechanistically related to the process by
which HGT occurs today.
Additional support for the existence of innovation sharing
within gene pools comes from signatures in the S4 protein
that were reported by Roberts et al. [2] to distinguish the
bacterial and archaeal/eukaryal lineages. S4 proteins from
both archaea and bacteria possess the RNA binding C-terminal domain, but have an N-terminal architecture distinct to each domain of life. Furthermore, the archaeal
version of the α-operon is organized with S4 preceding
S11 (S13-S4-S11), as opposed to S11 proceeding S4 as in
bacteria (S13-S11-S4). Clearly, large-scale evolutionary
changes occurred in S4 after (or at) the Bacteria and

Archaea divergence, and yet the signatures are unvarying
within each domain. Excluding the possibility that all
extant bacteria can trace their vertical ancestry to a single
individual cell and all extant archaea to another single
cell, the respective organism pools at the time must have
been able to efficiently share genes in an in situ manner
that allowed the homogenization of the bacterial pool.
This is the same evolutionary process required to support
both a C+ and a C-(IV) form of the S4 gene in the bacterial
pool.
Origin of S4 outside the α-operon
If, as suggested above, a bacterial pool allowed both the
C+ and C-(IV) forms of the S4 gene to be brought into the
genome in situ as needed, the question arises as to the origin of the C-(IV) gene outside of the α-operon in genomes
where it is the sole copy. We propose that this organization is the result of HGT of the C-(IV) gene into C+
genomes after the phyla had diverged from the bacterial

gene pool and the in situ evolutionary dynamic had
slowed. Loss of the original C+ gene would have then
allowed a reduction in zinc use without perturbation to
growth of the organisms.
Figure 8 depicts the four possible evolutionary paths
(labeled A-D) starting from either a C+ or C-(IV) gene
inside the α-operon and ending with a single C-(IV) type
gene outside the α-operon. Path A involves a gene dupli-

cation of a C+ type, mutation of the C+ type into a C-(IV)
type, and finally loss of the original C+ gene. This path is
ruled out for two reasons: first, no duplications of C+ S4
genes were observed in any of the 660 genomes studied,
and second, the path depends on an unlikely set of mutation events. The C-(IV) genes outside the α-operon are
indistinguishable in sequence from the C-(IV) genes
inside, including the loss of a characteristic seven residue
indel. The probability of an independent mutational dele-

unclassified proteobacterium Magnetococcus sp. MC-1,
which is phylogenetically closest to the Alphaproteobacteria
[33,34], contains the gene for the C+ form of S4 in the αoperon. Thus, the Proteobacteria phylum likely contained
the C+ gene originally.

tion of seven residues from a C+ gene leading to the exact
same indel pattern as in the pre-existing C-(IV) gene is
low. Additionally, there are other sequences signatures,
such as residue 15 (in the RRXG motif) being glutamic
acid in C+ and leucine/phenylalanine in C-(IV) and residue 21 being leucine in C+ and glycine/proline in C-(IV),
that support a common origin for all of the C-(IV)
sequences.
Path B specifies HGT of a C-(IV) gene into a genome containing the C+ type in the α-operon followed by loss of
the C+ gene. Evidence supporting path B comes from the
pattern of S4 HGT events presented in Results. The evolutionary history of S4 contains several relatively recent horizontal transfers, as supported by our analysis of genomes
containing multiple copies of the S4 gene. In each of these
cases, a C-(IV) gene was transferred into a genome with
the C+ form of the S4 gene in the α-operon. Additionally,
in two instances there was loss of the original C+ gene following the HGT of a C-(IV) gene, the clostridium F. magna
and the betaproteobacterium M. flagellatus, exactly as prescribed in path B.
Both of the remaining paths, C and D, start with a C-(IV)
gene and involve later acquisition of an additional C-(IV)
gene either through duplication of the original or HGT,
respectively. Our analysis found neither duplications nor
horizontal transfers in any genome with the C-(IV) gene
in the α-operon, although the sample size of known HGT
events is low. Furthermore, there is phylogenetic evidence
that some of the groups now containing only a C-(IV)
gene outside of the α-operon are descended from lineages
originally containing the C+ gene, which would preclude
paths C and D. For example, all Alphaproteobacteria contain only the C-(IV) gene outside of the α-operon, while
all other Proteobacteria have the C+ form (or recent variations thereof) in the α-operon. Even the genome of the

The above arguments provide support for our hypothesis
that C+ was the original form of the S4 gene in the branch
of the tree containing C-(IV) outside the α-operon (red
background in Figure 3) and that these branches received
the C-(IV) gene through HGT. The original source of the
C-(IV) S4 gene must have been one of the phyla containing C-(IV) natively, i.e., one with the C-(IV) gene in the αoperon, but once the S4 gene made the transition from an
operon gene to a standalone gene it may have become
more readily transferable. Later HGT events may therefore
have originated from organisms having already received
prior transfers. From the phylogenetic tree in Figure 3 the
best candidate phyla for the original source are Aquificae,
Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia, but the low support values near the radiating points in the tree leave a great deal
of ambiguity as to the exact source. Given the strict presence of the C-(IV) form and absence of an S4 gene in the
α-operon in the groups, it appears that both the HGT
events and native gene losses are likely ancient.
Evolutionary pressure and the loss of zinc binding in
ribosomal proteins
Insight into an evolutionary process comes from not only
describing the mechanism of change, but also the pressures behind the change. As discussed earlier, seven other
r-proteins have been reported to bind zinc and to have
evolutionary histories disrupted in a similar pattern to
what we have reported for S4. Table 2 shows the occurrence of C+, C-, or both C+ and C- genes of these r-proteins in the major bacterial groups (a complete
breakdown by organism is available as Additional File 1).
C+ was reported as being the ancestral form of these r-proteins [14] and, if that is indeed the case, it is clear from the
distribution that large groups have developed either the
ability to do without zinc for specific r-proteins or to
switch to C-paralogs under low zinc conditions. Specifically, we see characteristic divisions below the phyla level,
e.g. Alphaproteobacteria have replaced the C+ genes for
almost all zinc-binding r-proteins with C- genes, Epsilonproteobacteria has exclusively C- forms of three, and
Magnetococcus sp. MC-1 encodes the C- gene for only one.

These observations point to the conclusion that some bacteria evolved to use C- variants of the zinc-binding ribosomal proteins (including S4) to regulate the zinc
economy of the cell. Whether this lower zinc usage was a
response to a change in the zinc conditions in the environment or whether some other change in the environment

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:179

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/179

(such as lower temperature) caused the decreased need for
zinc is still unclear.

Conclusion
The cellular information processing system is generally
believed to be much less subject to the influences of HGT
than other genetic systems. While recent metagenomic
studies have not reported any reliable HGT events for the
ribosome among the three domains of life, examples of
disagreement with the UPT among the bacterial versions
of seven zinc-binding r-proteins S14, S18, L28, L31, L32,
L33 and L36 have been well documented [12,14]. According to our study of 660 bacterial genomes, the bacterial
version of the universal r-protein S4, shares similarities
with these seven proteins, namely they all have two different versions of the sequence, zinc-binding (C+) and nonzinc-binding (C-), and their evolutionary histories all
show patterns of disagreement with the standard UPT.
The evolutionary history of r-protein S4 reconstructed
here shows that S4 was subject to horizontal transfer
throughout the history of the bacterial lineages. Recent
HGT of the standard character was observed along with
other less well-defined evolutionary dynamics of ancient
origin. We propose wide-spread sampling of ancestral C+
and C- forms of the S4 gene from a bacterial gene pool as

a possible explanation, but definitive proof of such an
ancient event cannot be easily obtained. The present study
was only possible given the large number of available bacterial genomes, and perhaps additional genomes of other
diverse bacterial lineages would provide additional evidence for or against this proposition. Experiments detailing the purpose and regulation of paralogous S4 genes in
Clostridia also may shed light on the differences between
the C+ and C- forms.
In more practical terms, it should now be understood that
even "core" proteins can have a more complex evolutionary history than can be explained by vertical inheritance.
One recent study attempting to reconstruct an organismal
tree of life included S4 in a concatenated gene tree [35].
Although the authors did attempt to remove genes subject
to HGT, none was detected in the case of S4. It is clear
from the present study that doing so is not always a simple
proposition. Accurate evolutionary relationships for S4
were only uncovered with extensive coverage of the bacterial tree along with heavy use of genome content. Others
have shown that concatenated genes trees may lack resolution [36], and this may be a direct result of mixing genes
with different complex relationships, like the one
reported here for S4.

Methods
S4 sequence acquisition and alignment
The analysis was based all of the complete bacterial
genomes available at the time in NCBI GenBank. Additionally, in order to provide further data for a few poorly
represented phyla, draft genomes from three Planctomycetes, five Fusobacteria, and six Verrucomicrobia were
obtained from the Joint Genome Institute, as identified
through the Genome OnLine Database (GOLD) [37]. A
complete list of the genomes used is provided as Additional File 1.

To find S4 sequences and paralogs in the genomes, a nonredundant sequence profile was constructed as described
in Sethi et al. [38] starting with annotated S4 sequences
from the Swiss-Prot database [39]. This profile was used to
do a BLAST search [40] on each genome with a cut-off of
10-7. Fragments containing only the C-terminal RNA
binding domain were removed. Sequence were classified
as C+ or C- by comparison to annotated sequences and
then all sequences of each type were aligned using the
ClustalW [41] multiple alignment function. The C+ and
C- multiple alignments were combined using the ClustalW profile alignment function and the resulting alignment was hand edited to correct poorly aligned regions.
The complete sequence alignment is provided as Additional File 2. All operations were performed within the
MultiSeq [42] bioinformatics analysis environment.
Phylogenetic reconstructions
Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were reconstructed using
RAxML version 7.0.4 [43]. A value of 10 was used for the
maximum initial rearrangement distance (-i 10) and a
value of 25 for the number of rate categories (-c 25). The
tree for Proteobacteria was calculated using the JTT amino
acid model [44] (-m PROTMIXJTT) and the tree for Bacteria using the WAG model [45] (-m PROTMIXWAG), as
these models gave the best likelihood scores for a given
maximum-parsimony tree of the respective alignments. A
total of 1000 likelihood searches were performed for each
alignment starting from unique, random maximum-parsimony trees (-f d -# 1000). The tree with the highest likelihood score was taken to be the ML tree. A consensus tree
was constructed from the ML tree by removing bipartitions found in fewer than 50% of the other most likely
trees. Following, 5000 non-parametric bootstrap runs
were performed starting with the topology of the ML tree
(-b -t ml.tre -# 5000) to determine support values for the
bipartitions. Support values were mapped onto their corresponding branches in the consensus tree. Sequences
from a few genomes (Candidatus Carsonella ruddii PV, Sorangium cellulosum 'So ce 56', Symbiobacterium thermophilum
IAM 14863, Petrotoga mobilis SJ95, Rubrobacter xylanophilus
DSM 9941, Myxococcus xanthus DK 1622, Clostridium
phytofermentans ISDg) were highly mobile during ML
reconstruction (likely long-branch artifacts) and so were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/179

excluded from the reconstruction and added afterwards
using stepwise maximum-parsimony addition (-f p -t
ml.tre).
Zinc regulatory motifs
Zinc regulation protein binding motifs, which are AT rich
palindromes on the intergenic region of DNA strand were
searched using MEME/MAST [46]. MEME was used to
make a position specific substitution matrix (PSSM) based
on input palindromes. The input profile of Actinobacteria
was taken from experimentally determined Zur binding
sites in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Streptomyces coelicolor [18,19] and the profiles for Bacillus group and γ-proteobacteria were taken from [15]. Then the resulting
matrixes were used as input of MAST to search for other
binding sites in the whole genomes. Only those genomes
that have paralogs of S4 genes were subjected to this analysis. The three reference profiles mentioned above are provided as Additional File 3, 4, and 5.
