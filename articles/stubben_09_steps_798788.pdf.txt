Abstract
Background: New and improved antimicrobial countermeasures are urgently needed to
counteract increased resistance to existing antimicrobial treatments and to combat currently
untreatable or new emerging infectious diseases. We demonstrate that computational comparative
genomics, together with experimental screening, can identify potential generic (i.e., conserved
across multiple pathogen species) and novel virulence-associated genes that may serve as targets
for broad-spectrum countermeasures.
Results: Using phylogenetic profiles of protein clusters from completed microbial genome
sequences, we identified seventeen protein candidates that are common to diverse human
pathogens and absent or uncommon in non-pathogens. Mutants of 13 of these candidates were
successfully generated in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and the potential role of the proteins in
virulence was assayed in an animal model. Six candidate proteins are suggested to be involved in
the virulence of Y. pseudotuberculosis, none of which have previously been implicated in the virulence
of Y. pseudotuberculosis and three have no record of involvement in the virulence of any bacteria.
Conclusion: This work demonstrates a strategy for the identification of potential virulence factors
that are conserved across a number of human pathogenic bacterial species, confirming the
usefulness of this tool.

Background
Microbial disease is the major cause of human death and
morbidity and for many infectious diseases, no preventive

vaccines are available [1]. Where therapies do exist, escalation of resistance to antimicrobials hinders treatment of
common bacterial infections and accentuates the need for

new approaches [2,3]. Therefore, it is imperative to identify appropriate targets for medical countermeasures such
as antimicrobial drugs or cross-protective vaccines active
against several pathogenic strains or species. An alternative to "killing" bacteria, which exacerbates the selection
of antimicrobial resistance, is to "disarm" bacteria by
interfering with their capacity to be virulent, thus enabling
the bacterium to survive and evoke an appropriate
immune protection [4]. Targeting such virulence factors
through the development of antivirulence (as opposed to
antimicrobial) compounds has indicated that it is possible to target common virulence genes [5,6].
Virulence is typically described as the damage a pathogen
causes to the host during infection [7]. Gene products that
contribute to virulence can therefore be described as virulence factors. Traditionally a gene has been classified to
encode a virulence factor by experimentally introducing a
mutation into the protein of interest and determining
whether virulence of the resultant mutant is reduced.
Genome-wide screens for identifying novel virulence factors have traditionally employed transposon mutagenesis
to inactivate genes in a selected bacterial strain and then
screening the resulting insertion mutants for attenuation
in an appropriate animal infection model. An adaptation
of this method has been the incorporation of unique DNA
tags in signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) which enables mutants to be screened en masse in animal infection
models [8]. However, this approach is limited to a single
strain of a particular bacterial species and a particular
infection model. Therefore the approach typically identifies highly specific virulence factors with limited extrapolation to generic virulence determinants of other
pathogens. Another approach is to identify genes up-regulated in vivo, such as in vivo expression technology (IVET)
[9]. However, this approach also identifies genes other
than those required for virulence and both STM and IVET
identify genes in a pathogen that are also present in nonpathogens.
Computational approaches to identifying virulence factors have often been made through whole-genome comparisons of two or more bacteria, where the presence or
absence of genes between closely related pathogenic and
non-pathogenic strains can suggest genes that potentially
play a role in virulence [10,11]. For example, Garbom et
al. [12] identified novel virulence-associated genes in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis by looking at the hypothetical genes
(genes of unknown function) conserved in six human
microbial pathogens. Expanding on this work, we have
used whole proteome searches to identify virulence-associated proteins common to diverse pathogenic bacteria
that are absent in non-pathogenic species. The identified
factors can then be exploited for the development of medical countermeasures such as antimicrobials, vaccines or
diagnostics.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/501

In contrast to computational approaches based on similarity, genomic context methods involve several non-similarity based approaches to predict protein functions and
interactions [13-17]. Phylogenetic profiles particularly
suit our objective of identifying conserved virulence factors across multiple human pathogenic species. The
method was originally designed to identify functionallyrelated proteins that evolve in a correlated fashion by
characterizing proteins by a binary string that encodes the
presence or absence of the protein in every known
genome [18]. The method has been improved and
expanded in numerous ways, including new approaches
to characterize profile patterns by domains [19] and protein families [20] and by integrating phylogenetic information to compute probabilities of observing different
profile strings [21,22]. Phylogenetic profiles have been
used to identify virulence factors related to bacterial food
poisoning [23] and intracellular pathogenesis [24]. In this
work, we have utilized a similar approach to identify
potential virulence factors present in a group of extreme
human pathogens, bacteria from the Centers for Disease
Control category A and B pathogen lists (http://
www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp).
We
impose two primary criteria: first, the putative target genes
must be broadly present in the diverse pathogens within
these two groups. Second, the putative target genes should
be absent or highly divergent in non-pathogens. This
enhances the likelihood that candidates are implicated in
virulence and minimizes the potential activity of future
countermeasures against the host commensal flora.

Results
Clustering of proteins
Our targets of interest are proteins that are present in
diverse pathogens but absent from non-pathogens, and
therefore we had to decide which proteins in different
organisms should be treated as the same protein. We
began by doing an all against all BLAST comparison of a
collection of 617,000 proteins from all 214 completely
sequenced microbial genomes available at the time. The
resulting 123 million BLAST hits were grouped into clusters using single-linkage clustering at eight different percent identity and query coverage cut-offs. Finally,
phylogenetic profile tables were created to summarize the
presence or absence of proteins within a cluster across all
genomes.
Searching for virulence-associated proteins
We searched for virulence-associated proteins in the phylogenetic profile tables using the BLAST Clusters link on
the Toxin and Virulence Factor website (TVFac) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (http://www.tvfac.lanl.gov). We
assigned representative strains taken from the CDC category A and B pathogen lists to the target group (Table 1).
Fifty-two non-pathogenic strains were included in the
background group (Additional file 1). These were selected
Page 2 of 9

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:501

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/501

from the 214 genomes as having no association with
human pathogenesis, or in fact no pathogenesis in animal
and plants. Bacteria that have been identified as opportunistic pathogens were excluded from both lists as their
mode of action may be as much to do with an immunocompromised host as the possession of traditional virulence factors by the bacteria. Next, we selected a minimum
of five hits to the category A and B pathogens and maximum of three hits to non-pathogens and identified 1024
potential generic virulence factor candidates using the
50% identity and 90% coverage cutoffs (Table 2). Other
combinations were exhaustively tested but more stringent
cutoffs resulted in too few candidates whilst less stringent
ones gave too many for our purposes.
Selecting candidates for experimental screening
Since it was impractical to experimentally test all 1024
candidates, additional down-selection was performed to
narrow the number of candidates to a more manageable
number. The final proteins used in experimental testing
were selected based on a number of different criteria. The
selected protein is required to have an ortholog in Y. pseudotuberculosis since this was our experimental pathogen to
investigate virulence and 87 candidates were found to
have no Y. pseudotuberculosis homolog in the cluster. Since
it is possible that one closely-related protein could compensate for the loss in function of the other [25], a further
21 clusters with multiple hits to Y. pseudotuberculosis were
also removed. Since only completely sequenced microbial
genomes were included in the database, each target protein was also compared against protein sequences from
eukaryotes and other organisms by following links on
TVFac to pre-computed BLAST results available at NCBI
(National Center for Biotechnology Information). Those

targets with an identity of 50% or more to eukaryotes,
and/or 50% or greater identity to 3 or more non-pathogens, were also removed from the list. By these considerations the number of candidates was narrowed down to 17
potential targets for experimental testing, of which thirteen of these were successfully constructed as mutants
(Table 3).
The top hit from the cluster search was a superoxide dismutase C (SodC) with hits to nine category A and B pathogens and none from the non-pathogen group. Although
several forms of this enzyme are found in both pathogenic
and non-pathogenic bacteria as well as most other organisms including eukaryotes, this particular cluster included
only pathogenic bacteria. This suggests that SodC from
pathogens is distinct from non-pathogens at the amino
acid sequence level when compared at the described cutoffs (50% identity and 90% coverage). Similarly, where
targets are given as absent in a certain bacterium, this does
not mean that no homolog can be found in that organism, but rather no homolog can be found at the cut-off
levels used for this search.
Testing virulence in Y. pseudotuberculosis
The growth rate of each mutant was compared to that of
the wild-type (Additional file 2). No statistically significant differences between growth curves were observed (P
> 0.05, using an ANCOVA, comparing sigmoidal dose
models, fitted to the data). It is therefore unlikely that any
of the genetic mutations in this study have affected the
ability for them to grow in media. Mice were inoculated as
described with doses ranging from 1 to 104 cfu of wild
type Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32953 (see Methods for
complete details). The median lethal dose (MLD) via the

Strains of select agents (CDC category A and B bacteria) assigned to the target group in profile searches. Genomes sequences from some select
agents were unavailable at the time (Clostridium botulinum and Chlamydia psittaci) and the toxin-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and
Clostridium perfringens were excluded from the searches. Where multiple strains had been sequenced (such as for Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia
pestis), a single representative strain was selected so that results were not skewed to favor species with multiple entries.

A total of 1024 potential virulence factor clusters were identified in
the phylogenetic profile tables. At least five hits to pathogens of
interest were required and no more than three hits to non-pathogens
were allowed.

i.v. route was calculated to be 2 cfu, consistent with that
previously reported [26]. Thirteen of the 17 target genes
were inactivated by allelic replacement in Y. pseudotuberculosis and tested for reduced competitiveness with the wild
type strain after i.v. challenge of mice. Four genes could
not be constructed despite repeated attempts. For this
study, a mutant was considered to be attenuated if it had
a competitive index (CI) value of 0.2 or less. Based on this,
six genes were identified that reduced virulence of Y. pseudotuberculosis (Table 3). None of the encoded proteins
have been previously reported to play a role in virulence
of Y. pseudotuberculosis, although three have been reported

as playing a role in the virulence of other bacteria. It is
possible however, that the genes themselves are not
directly involved in virulence but have an effect on other
genes that are.

Discussion
The lifestyles of all of the pathogens selected for this study
are known to involve survival in phagocytes and of the
genes down-selected, several are implicated in the survival
of bacteria within phagocytic cells. SodC is known to be a
virulence factor in several pathogenic bacteria including
Neisseria meningitides [27], Burkholderia cenocepacia [28],
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Salmonella
choleraesuis [29] and Brucella abortus [30], and disruption
of the sodC gene in these bacteria have generated attenuated mutants. Further work has characterized the role of
superoxide dismutase C in the virulence in Y. pseudotuberculosis [31]. SodC is known to protect bacteria in phagosomes from the bactericidal action of superoxide anion,
and SodC orthologs were found in most of the pathogens
targeted for this study [32]. Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Bacillus anthracis are also known to
have SodC, but these enzymes do not show significant
sequence homology with the cluster of SodC orthologs in
this study at the 50% identity and 90% coverage cut-offs
used.

Virulence-associated genes identified by computational methods and selected for experimental screening. These targets have been ranked by their
competitive index (CI) value in Y. pseudotuberculosis. The CI value shown is the mean of the CI calculated from 3 spleens individually plated in
triplicate. The top six candidates are deemed virulence-related by our experimental criteria. Hits to pathogens include all five members of the

Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ are believed to be limiting in the
phagosome, and transport systems for these ions are common to many of the pathogens targeted for this study [33].
Bacterial MntH proteins are homologous to the eukaryotic NRAMP (natural-resistance-associated macrophage
protein) family of proteins that transport either Mn2+ or
Fe2+. Mutants of the mntH gene (manganese transport
protein) have been shown to be attenuated in Salmonella
typhimurium [34]. In S. typhimurium, the magnesium transport ATPase gene, mgtB, is found on a pathogenicity
island, SPI-3, and its expression is controlled by the PhoP/
Q signal transduction system which is an essential system
in Salmonella virulence [35].
HemY is a putative protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase that is
found as part of the haem biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. Haem is a tetrapyrrole derivative commonly used as a
prosthetic group in proteins such as cytochromes, catalases and peroxidases and is essential for respiration and
defence against oxygen intermediates. This later function
suggests a possible involvement as a host defense mechanism. Although no hemY gene has been associated with
virulence to date, Staphylococcus aureus mutants of hemB
have been shown to reduce virulence in the Caenorhabditis
elegans infection model [36].
YPTB3827 is an uncharacterized protein which contains
the COG domain COG2982, involved in outer membrane
biogenesis [Cell envelope biogenesis, outer membrane].
The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is made
up of four major components: lipopolysaccharide, phospholipids, beta-barrel proteins, and lipoproteins [37].
Together they play a number of roles including maintaining the integrity of the cell, uptake and secretion of solutes
and interaction with the host cell. YPTB3827 has not previously been associated with virulence. However, it is possible that disruption of this protein may affect virulence
though interactions with the host cell, or through secretion of certain proteins. Further work on this protein will
be required to further characterize its role and to elucidate
its role in virulence.
Of the 17 targets, four could not be constructed as
mutants suggesting that their function may be essential to
the virulence of the cell. Each of these were compared to
the Database of Essential Genes (DEG: http://
tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg) and two, YPTB2995 and YPTB2026,
showed over 50% identity to proteins described as essential in this database [38].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/501

of potential targets in pathogens versus non-pathogens - is
a promising tool for the identification of potential virulence-associated proteins. However, further work is
needed to confirm whether these targets are important to
Y. pseudotuberculosis outside the laboratory and whether
these targets are also associated with virulence in other
pathogens. Work is currently underway to characterize
each of the targets and to demonstrate their roles in virulence. This work has already been completed for superoxide dismutase where it has been shown to be essential for
the virulence of Y. pseudotuberculosis in both insect and
mammalian hosts [31]. Similarly, to confirm the identified targets as generic, we are now carrying out studies in
a range of bacterial pathogens.
An advantage of our approach is that commensal flora,
which often play important roles in the well-being of
humans, should be minimally affected. This is dramatically illustrated in the development of Clostridium difficileassociated colitis where the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics significantly impacts the commensal gut
flora producing an environment where the pathogenic C.
difficile can proliferate [39]. Additional grounds for targeting virulence per se is furnished by recent metagenomic
studies in humans, which suggest that the human metagenome contains several orders of magnitude more microbial genes than Homo sapiens genes and that our bodies
themselves contain perhaps ten times as many microbial
cells as "human" ones [40,41]. Avoiding potential disruption to this vast microbial community is thus highly desirable as commensals are now known to contribute to gut
immunity and the synthesis of vital nutrients [39,42,43].
Since this work was started, the number of whole genome
sequences has increased greatly and new protein family
and cluster databases are readily available for searching.
The TVFac website now includes phylogenetic profile
tables created from 14 database cross-references and three
UniRef clusters in UniProt [44]. As of July 2009, over
1430 microbial and nearly 80 eukaryotic genomes are currently represented in these tables. Further studies could be
carried out with these extended datasets with the possibility of identifying more potential candidates. The success
rate we observed in spite of these limitations suggests that
improved methods along the lines suggested should further enhance the discovery of virulence-associated proteins that are conserved within a number of human
pathogenic bacteria.

Methods
Conclusion
Of the 13 mutants constructed, six were identified as having potential association with the virulence of Y. pseudotuberculosis (42%), suggesting that this selection process guided primarily by the comparative presence or absence

Our approach in finding virulence-associated genes common to human pathogens followed three levels of computational pre-screening followed by experimental analysis
of the resulting candidates. The computational steps
reduced the number of potential targets from over 77,500

to 17 candidates. The experimental screening suggests that
six of these candidates are virulence factors in Y. pseudotuberculosis and potential targets for countermeasures (flowchart in additional file 3).
Computational methods
A collection of 617,000 proteins was downloaded from
214 completely sequenced microbial genomes available
on the NCBI ftp site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bac
teria) in February 2005. The entire set of proteins was
blasted all against all using BLASTP 2.2.10 on a 240-node
Linux cluster. Soft-masking was used to avoid initial
matches based on low complexity sequences and to allow
extensions through masked regions. For each query protein, the top 1000 subject proteins with an e-value below
10-5 were retained producing a final tab-delimited blast
output file with almost 123 million rows of data. The proteins were grouped into clusters at eight different percent
identity and query coverage cutoffs using a custom-built
single-linkage clustering program written in C++. The
clustering results were loaded into a MySQL database and
cross-tabulations were run to create profile tables summarizing the presence or absence of proteins across all
genomes. For example, 418,000 proteins were grouped
into 77,500 clusters ranging in size from 2 to 506 proteins
using 50% identity and 90% query coverage cut-offs. The
corresponding profile table therefore contains 77,500
rows for each cluster and 214 columns, one for each
genome.

The profiles tables were searched using the BLAST Clusters
link on Toxin and Virulence Factor website (http://
www.tvfac.lanl.gov). In order to facilitate comparisons
among groups of organisms in the profile tables, we first
collected detailed information on host-pathogen interactions including the source of infection, methods of transmission and the ability of the pathogen to cause infection.
The organism-based annotations were then linked to the
search page to allow users to quickly highlight and select
a target and background group. We selected "CDC pathogens -species" to highlight one representative strain of category A and B pathogens and moved those 13 taxa to the
target group (Table 1). Next, we highlighted "non-pathogen Bacteria" and moved those 52 taxa to the background
group. Finally, we selected a minimum of five hits to the
target and 3 hits to the background and the 50% identity
and 90% query coverage cutoffs. These search criteria
identified 1024 cluster profiles summarized in Table 2.
Experimental methods
Bacteria and plasmids used in this work are listed in additional file 4. Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32953 was
selected because the complete genome sequence is available [45]. It was maintained in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/501

and on LB agar. Plasmid pAJD434 [46] and PCR products
were introduced into Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 by electroporation. PCR products were purified using Millipore
Microcon Ultracel YM-100. All Y. pseudotuberculosis
IP32953 strains containing the pAJD434 plasmid were
grown in LB media supplemented with 100 μg/ml trimethoprim, and 0.8% arabinose when λ Red Recombinase genes were required to be induced at 28°C. Mutants
constructed in Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 were grown in
LB supplemented with kanamycin at a final concentration
of 50 μg/ml. Congo-red magnesium oxalate (CR-MOX)
agar were prepared as described by Riley and Toma [47].
Unless otherwise stated, chemicals were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, United Kingdom). Enzymes were
purchased from Promega Ltd (Southampton, United
Kingdom).
Construction of Y. pseudotuberculosis mutants was carried
out using a previously published method [48]. Briefly,
primers were designed for each target gene to be disrupted
that included 20 bp complementary to the 5' or 3'
sequence of the kanamycin gene of the plasmids pK2 or
pUC4K followed by 50 bp of upstream or downstream
sequence flanking the gene to be disrupted. PCR products
were generated using the plasmid pK2 as a template,
excess template was digested with DpnI and the PCR products were transformed into Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953
pAJD434, by electroporation. Following overnight incubation at 28°C in LB supplemented with 0.8% arabinose,
transformants were selected on LB agar supplemented
with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and trimethoprim (100 μg/
ml) for 48 h at 28°C. Transformants were screened by
PCR using target gene-specific and kanamycin gene-specific primers (Additional file 5). Mutant strains were cured
of the pAJD434 plasmid by growth at 37°C in LB media
supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Cured mutant
strains were screened for the virulence plasmid pYV by
PCR for two genes located on this plasmid; virF and yscC
(Additional file 6). The retention of the Yersinia virulence
plasmid (pYV) was also confirmed by culture on CR-MOX
plates, where plasmid retention results in small red colonies and plasmid loss results in large pink colonies [47].
To measure bacterial growth, mutants and wild-type bacteria were grown overnight in 20 ml LB broth (wild type)
or 20 ml LB broth + kanamycin (50 μg/ml, mutants) with
shaking at 28°C. 100 ml of fresh culture of the same
medium were seeded from the over-night cultures and
grown at 28°C as before. Growth was recorded over 24
hours by measuring the OD600 at various time-points and
the growth curves were graphed and analysed using
Graphpad PRISM v4.0. Data was fit to the model: Y = Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(1+10^((LogEC50-X)*HillSlope)),
where X is the logarithm of time, Y is the response; Y starts

at the Bottom and goes to the Top with a sigmoid shape.
Growth curves were compared using an ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance).
The median lethal dose (MLD), the expected median dose
required to produce morbidity or death in 50% of the
population tested, was determined as previously
described [49]. Briefly, groups of six female 6-week-old
BALB/c mice (Charles River laboratories) were infected via
intravenous (i.v.) injection with 0.1 ml serially diluted (in
sterile PBS) exponential-phase cultures grown at 28°C in
LB broth (wild type) or LB broth supplemented with kanamycin (mutant). Humane endpoints were strictly
observed, and animals deemed incapable of survival
(unable to right themselves or unresponsive to a pinch on
the foot or tail) were killed by cervical dislocation. The
MLD was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench
[50].
For in vivo competitive index studies, mutant and wildtype strains were grown separately to exponential phase in
20 ml LB broth with shaking. Broth cultures were then
centrifuged (10 minutes, 4,000 g) and the pellet re-suspended in 10 ml sterile PBS and centrifuged again (10
minutes, 4,000 g). The bacteria were washed and re-suspended in 10 ml PBS and the optical density adjusted to
an OD600 of 0.55 to 0.6 with sterile PBS. Wild type and
mutant bacterial suspensions were then mixed in a 1:1
ratio and serially diluted with sterile PBS to give an inoculation concentration of approximately 1 × 103 cfu/ml.
Groups of 6 mice were then dosed with 0.1 ml of this solution by the i.v. route as above. Retrospective viable counts
were determined by plating out dilutions (in triplicate) on
LB agar and LB agar supplemented with kanamycin to
determine the input ratio. After 5 days, spleens were
recovered and passed through sieves (70 μm; Becton Dickinson) to produce a cell suspension in 3 ml of PBS. Cell
suspensions were serially diluted in sterile PBS and plated
onto LB agar and LB agar supplemented with kanamycin
to determine the output ratio. The competitive index (CI)
is defined as the output ratio (mutant/wild type) divided
by the input ratio (mutant/wild type) [51,52].

Growth curves. Growth curve for wild type and mutants over 24 hours
measured by optical density (600 nm). Curve shown is a sigmoidal dose
response model that best describes the data in its integrity; no significant
differences were seen between individual models (p > 0.05 using an
ANCOVA, comparing sigmoidal dose models, fitted to the data). Plot

Overview of methodology. Each of the first three computational (or semicomputational) steps results in a large reduction of the potential search
space (which can not be usefully shown to scale). Clustering provides an
operational definition of the "same" protein in different organisms. Profiling determines which clusters are overrepresented in pathogens. Filtering selects those clusters which meet experimental criteria. The resulting
candidates are then screened experimentally.
