Abstract
Background: Entamoeba histolytica is an intestinal protozoan parasite of humans. The genome has
been sequenced, but the study of individual gene products has been hampered by the lack of the
ability to generate gene knockouts. We chose to test the use of RNA interference to knock down
gene expression in Entamoeba histolytica.
Results: An episomal vector-based system, using the E. histolytica U6 promoter to drive expression
of 29-basepair short hairpin RNAs, was developed to target protein-encoding genes in E. histolytica.
The short hairpin RNAs successfully knocked down protein levels of all three unrelated genes
tested with this system: Igl, the intermediate subunit of the galactose- and N-acetyl-Dgalactosamine-inhibitable lectin; the transcription factor URE3-BP; and the membrane binding
protein EhC2A. Igl levels were reduced by 72%, URE3-BP by 89%, and EhC2A by 97%.
Conclusion: Use of the U6 promoter to drive expression of 29-basepair short hairpin RNAs is
effective at knocking down protein expression for unrelated genes in Entamoeba histolytica,
providing a useful tool for the study of this parasite.

Background
The human parasite Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) is
a unicellular protozoal parasite that phylogenetically is
placed on one of the lowermost branches of the eukaryotic tree, closest to Dictyostelium discoideum [1]. It is an unusual organism, having 9,938 predicted genes, with slightly
less than one third (31.8%) of its predicted proteins having no homologues in GenBank [2]. Humans are its only
natural hosts, and E. histolytica is spread by ingestion of
contaminated food or water via the fecal-oral route and

thus tends to endemically infect people under circumstances where hygiene is poor [3]. It has a simple life cycle,
alternating between infective quadrinucleate cysts and
invasive motile trophozoites [3]. 80% of people infected
with E. histolytica are colonized asymptomatically; in the
remaining 20%, trophozoites invade into the intestinal
epithelium, resulting in clinical disease [3]. It is estimated
that there are 50 million symptomatic cases of amebic colitis and 100,000 deaths per year worldwide due to E. histolytica [4].

The discovery that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can initiate post-transcriptional sequence-specific gene silencing
of cellular genes [5] via translational repression or degradation of mRNA in most eukaryotic cells has become an
important tool in assessing and manipulating gene function. This mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi) may
have evolved as a defense against viruses and transposable
elements with dsRNA intermediates [6,7]. The small RNA
intermediates in this process, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), result from dsRNA being cleaved at 21- to 23- nucleotide intervals [8] by an RNase III-type protein, Dicer [9],
and are then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing
complex (RISC), which includes Argonaute "Slicer" protein [8,10]. The antisense strand of the siRNA is used to
guide the RISC to its target mRNA, which is then cleaved
by Argonaute [11,12]. RNAi effects can be amplified by
the action of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs).
siRNAs act as primers for RdRPs, which form new dsRNAs
using the target mRNA as a template, which are subsequently cleaved into siRNAs with sequences corresponding to target mRNAs but differing from the original
dsRNAs [13,14]. Genes encoding RdRPs have been identified in many organisms, but not in flies or mammals [12].
E. histolytica possesses the molecular machinery for RNAi.
It has a gene [GenBank:XM_645408] [2,15,16] encoding
a protein which has a single RNase III domain and possesses RNase III activity, and could perform the Dicer role
as a dimer. It also has two Argonaute homologs [GenBank:XM_651344, XM_651422] [2,15-17] and an RdRP
[GenBank:XM_646217] [2,15]. Exploitation of RNAi for
knockdown of gene expression is an attractive approach
for E. histolytica, as there is no evidence for meiotic division or detectable homologous recombination of genes
[18-20], thus it has not been possible to generate gene
knockouts [18,21]. Multiple copies of the genome, and
even nuclei, occur in the parasite due to an apparent lack
of the normal cell cycle regulatory checkpoints [22,23].
Homologous Entamoeba cell-cycle regulation genes are
divergent from typical eukaryotic versions and may not
have equivalent function [19]. This presents difficulties in
studying gene function or in isolating recessive mutations
[18]. The study of the function of individual genes in the
past has been limited to other techniques, such as the
over-expression of wild-type or mutant genes, and other
methods of gene inactivation such as antisense [21,24].
Methods of RNAi used in E. histolytica have included the
use of long dsRNA expressed by an E. histolytica RNA
polymerase II promoter, which was successfully used to
knock down expression of the E. histolytica proteins
Diaphanous, Klp5 and EhSTIRP [18,25,26], and the soaking of trophozoites in artificial siRNAs to knock down γtubulin expression [20]. These reports of RNAi use in E.
histolytica showed knockdown of a single gene or of a gene
family. Here, we report in this study the success of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/38

method of expression of short hairpin RNAs driven by the
E. histolytica U6 promoter to knock down protein expression in E. histolytica of three unrelated genes.
Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) have a similar structure to
siRNAs except the sense and antisense strands are connected at one end by a short loop, and function like siRNAs to knock down gene expression [27]. shRNAs can be
produced from an expression vector as a single transcript
from a RNA polymerase III promoter. The eukaryotic U6
promoter offers two advantages over other RNA polymerase III promoters: the promoter region immediately
upstream of the transcribed sequence for the U6 small
nuclear RNA gene includes all the required regulatory elements [28,29], and the termination sequence consists of 4
to 5 thymidine residues rather than a poly-A tail [28,29].
A variety of shRNA loop and stem lengths have been
tested, with the loop UUCAAGAGA [28] used in a number
of mammalian shRNA constructs, including Gou et al
(2003) [30], and is also used in the constructs in this
study. Longer hairpins with 29-base pair stems appear to
be better inhibitors of gene expression than ones with
shorter 19–21 bp stems [31]. Increased effectiveness has
also been seen for similarly-sized longer artificial siRNAs,
with only one siRNA apparently generated per longer
shRNA or siRNA [31,32].
Genes selected for knockdown: The three genes selected
for knockdown in this study, Igl, URE3-BP, and EhC2A,
are genes involved in amebic virulence under study in our
laboratory; they were selected since we wanted to create an
additional tool for studying the function and role of these
genes in amebic virulence.
Igl, the intermediate subunit of the galactose- and Nacetyl-D-galactosamine- (Gal/GalNAc) inhibitable lectin
[33,34], is a 150 kDa protein. The Gal/GalNAc lectin, the
major defined amebic adhesin, is a virulence factor mediating adherence to target cells in the first step of contactdependent cell killing [3]. The lectin binds to terminal
galactose or GalNAc residues in glycoproteins on the surfaces of target cells, and is composed of three subunits: the
heavy subunit Hgl (containing a carbohydrate-recognition domain), the intermediate subunit Igl, and the light
subunit Lgl [3]. The integral-membrane Hgl is disulfidebonded to the GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol)anchored Lgl. Igl is also GPI-anchored to the membrane
[3]. Evidence that Igl is associated non-covalently with the
Hgl-Lgl heterodimer includes that Igl and the Hgl-Lgl heterodimer co-migrate in native gel electrophoresis, and
affinity-purification of Igl with monoclonal antibodies
results in the co-purification of the Hgl-Lgl heterodimer
[3,33,34]. Igl is encoded by two unlinked gene copies, Igl1
[34]
and
Igl2
[Gen[GenBank:AF337950]
Bank:XM_647302] [2]; [GenBank:AF337951] [34], pro-

ducing ~1100 aa proteins that are 81% identical and
contain 32 CXXC repeats. CXXC repeats are also found in
a family of transmembrane kinases of E. histolytica and the
Giardia lamblia variant-specific surface proteins [35].
URE3-BP, Upstream Regulatory Element 3-Binding Protein [GenBank:AF291721] [36], is a 22.6 kDa calcium-regulated transcription factor encoding two EF-hand motifs,
which are associated with calcium-binding activity [36].
URE3-BP binds to the URE3 (Upstream Regulatory Element 3) consensus motif, TATTCTATT, found in the promoter of hgl5, which is one of the genes encoding the Gal/
GalNAc lectin heavy subunit, and is also present in the
ferredoxin 1 (fdx1) promoter, thereby regulating the
expression of these genes [36]. The human neuronal protein DREAM (calsenilin) is the only other known example
of a calcium-responsive transcription factor with EF hands
[36].
EhC2A [GenBank:XM_650207] [2] is a 22 kDa calciumbinding membrane protein containing a conserved C2
domain, is associated with the ability to bind phospholipids, and has a proline-rich C-terminal tail. This protein
was found to be associated to the amebic phagosome
[37]. A C2 domain, identified originally in protein kinase
C, is a Ca2+-binding motif that allows calcium-dependent
protein anchoring to or interaction with membranes;
these domains are found in a number of signaling proteins in eukaryotes [38].
A gene for which we have previously shown knockdown
is PATMK, Phagosome-Associated Transmembrane
Kinase 96 [GenBank:XM_650501] [2,39]. PATMK is a
transmembrane kinase family member found in the early
phagosome and is involved in the phagocytosis of human
erythrocytes [39]. It contains an intracellular putative
kinase domain, a short membrane-spanning region, and
an ectodomain containing CXXC-repeats like Igl [35,39].
We report here the effectiveness of shRNAs in silencing
genes in Entamoeba histolytica. Expression of 29-bp shRNAs driven by the E. histolytica U6 promoter was successful in knocking down protein expression of the three
different and unrelated genes in E. histolytica reported in
this study, and we previously showed knockdown for a
fourth gene [39]. This method of gene knockdown
appears to function well for a variety of gene types, and
should be a useful tool for studying gene function in this
organism.

Results
Construction of shRNA constructs
The RNA polymerase III promoter of the E. histolytica U6
gene [GenBank:U43841] [40] was amplified beginning at
-333 from the transcription start site of the U6 small

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/38

nuclear RNA gene, and the shRNA-encoding DNA was
added by PCR at the transcription start site [30,39] (Figure
1A). The resulting U6 promoter-shRNA constructs were
cloned into pGIR310 modified to contain a short
polylinker (Figure 1B). The shRNAs were designed to have
a 29-nucleotide complementary stem with a 9-nucleotide
loop (Figure 1C). The sense strand sequences of the
shRNA constructs transfected into HM1:IMSS trophozoites, the oligonucleotide (oligo) sequences used to create them by PCR, and the oligo sequences used in
quantitative reverse-transcription real-time PCR (qRTPCR) amplification to assess mRNA knockdown are
shown in Tables 1, 2, 3.
shRNA transfectants
Transfectants were maintained at 15 μg/ml hygromycin.
For knockdown studies, the hygromycin concentration
was increased every 24 hours until the final level of selection was achieved, and was maintained for 48 hours, in
order to increase the copy number of the episomal shRNA
vector [41-43]. The level of hygromycin selection was
increased until the desired knockdown was attained, up to
100 μg/ml. Transfected trophozoites selected with 100 μg/
ml hygromycin continued to grow and divide for at least
two weeks under continuous selection. A shRNA directed
against green fluorescent protein (GFP) [30], with a
sequence matching nothing in the E. histolytica genome,
was utilized as a control for transfection and hygromycin
selection for the Igl and URE3-BP transfectants. GFP
shRNA transfectants were selected with the same level of
hygromycin as other shRNA transfectants. For EhC2A, a
scrambled control matching nothing in the E. histolytica
genome was created, containing the same nucleotides as
the EhC2A (363–391) shRNA, but in a different order.
Sequences of the shRNA sense strands are shown in Table
1. Non-transfected HM1-IMSS amebae were also
included, with the results for Western blotting and qRTPCR being statistically the same as the GFP controls. Three
biological replicates were grown per shRNA transfectant,
and one for the nontransfected HM1:IMSS amebae. All
sample trophozoites were grown in 25 cm2 tissue culture
flasks, and were harvested for crude lysate and for RNA
isolation on the same day from the same flask. For protein
and mRNA comparison, actin was used as the "housekeeping" control gene, as a loading and normalization
control.
Knockdown of Igl protein
Four Igl shRNA constructs targeted Igl. One construct, Igl1
(272–300), specifically targeted Igl1. Three constructs, Igl
(1198–1226), Igl (2412–2440), and Igl (2777–2805),
were targeted to sequences conserved in both Igl1 and 2
(Table 1). The GFP shRNA transfectants were used as controls. Transfected trophozoites were selected with 100 μg/
ml hygromycin for 48 hours before harvesting. Blots were

probed with anti-Igl1 antibody, and with anti-actin antibody as a loading and normalization control. The level of
Igl1 in the GFP shRNA transfectants was defined to be
100% (Figure 2, Table 4). The Igl1-specific (272–300)
shRNA transfectant had a decreased amount of Igl1 protein, 27.8 ± 3.9%, as compared to the GFP shRNA control
(Figure 2, Table 4). Igl (1198–1226) had 42.3 ± 6.2% and
Igl (2777–2805) had 38.1 ± 9.4% of the GFP control Igl1
level. The Igl (2412–2440) shRNA construct had no effect
on Igl1 levels (95.3 ± 9.7% of the level in the GFP shRNA
transfectants) (Figure 2, Table 4). HM1:IMSS nontransfected amebae were not statistically different from the GFP
shRNA control (Table 4). The Igl (1198–1226) and Igl
(2777–2805) transfectants, when selected with 30 μg/ml
hygromycin rather than 100 μg/ml, yielded less knockdown, having ~70% and ~65% of the control level of Igl1
(data not shown).

shRNA system for Entamoeba histolytica. (A) Diagram
of the two-step PCR process for generating short hairpins
shRNA constructs were made using the method of Gou et al
(2003) [30]. Genomic DNA (or subsequently, the cloned U6
promoter) was used as a template to amplify the E. histolytica
U6 promoter and to add the hairpins. The primers in the first
PCR round were the forward primer, containing a HindIII site
and 5' end of the U6 promoter, and a first reverse primer,
containing the U6 promoter 3' end, the shRNA sense strand
sequence, and the 9-nucleotide loop. To yield the final product, in the second PCR round, the same forward primer was
used, with a second reverse primer containing the loop
sequence, the antisense strand sequence, the termination
sequence, and a NotI recognition site, using the first round
product as a template. The primers used to generate the
PCR products are listed in Table 2. (B) Modification of amebic expression vector pGIR310 to express shRNA The tetracycline repressor cassette in expression vector pGIR310, a
modification of pGIR308 [49,50], was replaced with a
polylinker containing a SalI and NotI site, flanked by HindIII
sites. PCR products were cloned into the HindIII and NotI
sites. pGIR310 confers hygromycin resistance in amebae and
ampicillin resistance in E. coli bacteria. (C) Expected structure of 29-basepair shRNA before processing by Dicer The
29-basepair stem and 9-nucleotide loop are shown.

Knockdown of Igl mRNA
Short sections of Igl were amplified via qRT-PCR using
template cDNAs synthesized from the Igl and control GFP
shRNA transfectant mRNAs. Four oligo pairs were used to
amplify Igl. Two sets of oligos targeted both Igl1 and Igl2
simultaneously, with one pair amplifying a 5' section and
the other a 3' section conserved in both Igl1 and Igl2. The
two others were specific for Igl1 or Igl2, targeting a nonconserved region. The oligo sequences and regions of Igl
transcript amplification are shown in Table 3, and summarized qRT-PCR data for Igl is shown in Table 5. All samples were compared to the GFP control shRNA
transfectants. Three of the four Igl shRNA transfectants
showed knockdown of Igl transcripts for all sets of oligo
pairs, ranging between ~60 and ~80% of the Igl level in
the GFP shRNA control (Table 5). Igl (2412–2440)
shRNA transfectants did not show any knockdown, and
the HM1:IMSS nontransfected trophozoites were not statistically different from the GFP shRNA control (Table 5).
Knockdown of URE3-BP protein
Two shRNA constructs were used to target URE3-BP:
URE3-BP (350–378) and URE3-BP (580–608). Transfected trophozoites were selected with 100 μg/ml hygromycin (GFP control or URE3-BP (350–378) shRNA) or 75
μg/ml hygromycin (URE3-BP (580–608) shRNA) for 48
hours before harvesting. Actin was used as a normalization and loading control. There was significant reduction
of URE3-BP protein in both URE3-BP shRNA transfectants: for URE3-BP (350–378) it was 10.8 ± 1.0% and 13.8
± 2.6% for URE3-BP (580–608) as compared to the GFP
shRNA control (Figure 3, Table 6). HM1:IMSS samples
were also included, but were not statistically different
from the GFP shRNA control (Table 6).

The Ambion siRNA finder [51] was used to select 21 mers from the entire coding sequence of URE3-BP, the poly-proline region of EhC2A, or the
identical or divergent regions of Igl1 and Igl2, which were then checked for sufficient GC content, lengthened to 29 nucleotides, and tested for
sufficient sequence uniqueness by blasting each 29 mer using the E. histolytica Genome Project database [52]. A scrambled sequence was created as
a control for EhC2A. A sequence directed against GFP [30] was included as a control for the Igl and URE3-BP selections. The constructs are named
such that the numbers in parentheses following the gene name indicated the location of the shRNA sense strand within that gene sequence.

Knockdown of URE3-BP mRNA
Three different oligo pairs, one amplifying the 5' end of
URE3-BP, one the 3' end, and one a section in the middle,
were used in qRT-PCR to amplify URE3-BP in cDNA from
GFP shRNA control transfectants, URE3-BP (350–378)
and URE3-BP (580–608) shRNA transfectants, and
HM1:IMSS nontransfected trophozoites. Oligo sequences
are shown in Table 3. Actin was used as the normalization
control. The URE3-BP (350–378) shRNA transfectant had
an average of about 69% of the GFP control URE3-BP
transcript level, and the URE3-BP (580–608) shRNA
transfectant had about 13% of the of the GFP shRNA control URE3-BP level (Table 7).
Knockdown of EhC2A protein
Two shRNA constructs targeted EhC2A, EhC2A (363–
391) and EhC2A (502–530). Transfectants were selected
with 90 μg/ml hygromycin for 48 hours before harvesting.
The scrambled control EhC2A (363–391 scrambled)
shRNA transfectant was used as a control for EhC2A protein levels. HM1:IMSS nontransfected amebae were not
included. The level of EhC2A protein in the EhC2A (363–
391 scrambled) control shRNA transfectant was defined
as 100 ± 5.0% (± SE). The EhC2A (363–391) shRNA transfectant yielded a knockdown of EhC2A protein to a level
of 3.0 ± 0.4% (P < 0.0001). The EhC2A (502–530) shRNA
transfectant had no knockdown effect on EhC2A levels

(106.1 ± 7.3%) and was statistically the same (P = 0.3141)
as the EhC2A (363–391 scrambled) shRNA control transfectant (Figure 4). Student's t test was used for statistical
analysis. qRT-PCR was not performed for these samples.
Northern blots of small RNAs
Since the E. histolytica U6 promoter had never been characterized, we tested if shRNAs or other small RNAs were
being produced by the U6 promoter. The PATMK samples
were included because they had been shown to have significant knockdown of PATMK protein levels as compared
to the scrambled PATMK shRNA control transfectant [39],
and therefore would be good candidates for expressing
the shRNAs. Northern blotting of the PATMK [39] and Igl
shRNA transfectant small RNAs was performed. Transfected trophozoites were selected with 30 μg/ml hygromycin for 48 hours before harvesting, since we had seen
protein knockdown previously at that level of selection
[39]. Non-transfected HM1:IMSS amebae were included
as a negative control. Fifty μg of small RNAs from PATMK
shRNA transfectants [39] and the Igl shRNA transfectants
were probed with oligo probes targeting the respective
sense and antisense strands of the shRNAs (Figure 5). The
PATMK (3552–3580) [39] and Igl (2777–2805) shRNA
samples had substantial expression of ~70 and ~30 nucleotide small RNAs, the expected sizes for the unprocessed
hairpin and the processed siRNA respectively. There was

The sequences shown in Table 1 were used to design primers for two-step PCR, based on the method used by Gou et al (2003) [30] and
diagrammed in Figure 1A. The final PCR product contained the E. histolytica U6 promoter with a HindIII site on the 5' end, an ApaI site at the 3' end
of the U6 promoter, the 29-nt sense strand of the hairpin, the 9 bp loop TTCAAGAGA, the antisense strand of the hairpin, and the U6 terminator
sequence followed by a NotI restriction site. The forward primer, "U6 HindIII forward", contained the HindIII recognition site and the 5' end of the
U6 promoter, the first reverse primer (R1) contained the sequence of the sense strand of the shRNA and the future loop, and the second reverse
primer (R2) contained the loop sequence, the antisense strand sequence, and the U6 termination sequence. A control GFP sequence [30] was used
to design oligos for creating a shRNA construct as a transfection control.

not a correlation of the small RNA abundance with the
degree of protein knockdown, as the small RNAs were
more abundant in Igl (2777–2805) than in Igl (1198–
1226), yet both had similar degrees of knockdown.

Discussion
We have utilized the U6 promoter to drive expression of
shRNAs with a 29-bp stem and a 9-nt loop to knock down
protein expression of three unrelated genes: a membrane
protein, Igl, the intermediate subunit of the Gal/GalNAc
lectin; URE3-BP, a calcium-regulated transcription factor,
upstream regulatory element 3- binding protein; and
EhC2A, a membrane-binding protein. Previously we had
reported preliminary experience with this system in the
near-complete knockdown of phagosome-associated
transmembrane kinase 96 (PATMK) [39]. In the work
reported here, the highest level of protein knockdown for
Igl was 72%, for URE3-BP 89%, and for EhC2A 97%. We
concluded that this was a reliable and effective system for
gene knockdown in E. histolytica. This method has advantages over other methods used for gene silencing: the U6shRNA expression cassettes are small (420 bp), appear to
be active against different types of genes, yield significant
knockdown, and the expression vector, once transfected,
allows continuous expression of shRNAs, thus avoiding

performing multiple transfections, and the shRNAs can be
easily synthesized via PCR.
Not every transfected shRNA construct was equally effective in silencing gene expression. For example, neither the
EhC2A (502–530) nor the Igl (2412–2440) shRNA construct blocked gene expression. In the case of Igl (2412–
2440), the run of four thymidines at positions 19–23 in
the shRNA sense strand could possibly cause RNA
polymerase III to terminate the transcript prematurely. In
the case of the EhC2A (502–530) shRNA construct, the
shRNA could bind to two locations in the mRNA, both the
originally targeted region (502–530), but also about 100
nt upstream (406–434), and perhaps this had an inhibitory effect on the ability of this shRNA to allow knockdown.
Factors other than the shRNA sequence affect the ability of
a shRNA to down-regulate gene expression. The secondary
structure of the transcript affects the ability of the RISC to
bind to its target site [44,45], and the relative abundance
and stability of an mRNA may play a significant role in
determining whether a given shRNA will effectively lead
to the degradation of its target message. In addition, the
stability of a protein product may also be a determinant in

Oligo pairs were designed to amplify short sections of Igl or URE3-BP. For Igl, four pairs of oligos were used: one amplifying the 5' end (Igl 5' oligo
pair) and one the 3' end (Igl 3' oligo pair) of Igl1 and Igl2 simultaneously; and a pair each to amplify a short section unique to Igl1 or Igl2 (Igl1 oligo
pair and Igl2 oligo pair, which have the same reverse primer in common) near the 5' end of the mRNA. Three oligo pairs were used to amplify short
sections of URE3-BP: one pair the 5' end, one pair the middle, and one pair the 3' end. The actin and Jacob primers were designed to amplify all
family members or alleles [35].

the detection of a knockdown phenotype. The protein
with the least knockdown in these studies, Igl, was the
most abundant; EhC2A was the least abundant and had
the most knockdown [46]. The level of hygromycin utilized to select for transfectants was an important determinant of the extent of protein knockdown. Igl knockdown

was twice as effective with 100 μg/ml as with 30 μg/ml of
hygromycin selection.
The qRT-PCR data was not correlated directly with the
level of protein knockdown. For the Igl transfectants, the
mRNA knockdown level was not as high as the protein

The average level of Igl1 protein in the GFP control shRNA transfectants was defined as 100% expression of Igl1 protein for computational
purposes. Protein levels of Igl1, using actin as a standard for comparison, were quantified from Western blotting. Values are expressed as the
percentage of the GFP level ± SE, with the P-value following each, calculated using Student's t test. For Western blotting, there were three
biological replicates, each run in triplicate sets of serial dilutions (1:2, 1:4, and 1:8), with the exception of the HM1:IMSS nontransfected samples
having one biological replicate rather than three. Protein levels were not statistically different between the Igl1 (272–300), Igl (1198–1226), and Igl
(2777–2805) samples (tested with ANOVA, one-tailed, α = 0.05, 0.1 < P < 0.25) or the GFP, HM1:IMSS, and Igl (2412–2440) samples (tested with

(580–608) transfectants had similar levels of protein
knockdown; however, the mRNA levels in the URE3-BP
(350–378) transfectants were higher (67% of the control
level), versus the URE3-BP (580–608) transfectants
(13.5% of the control level). This difference is probably
not due to partial mRNA decay, since the qRT-PCR data
showed consistent URE3-BP levels among the three oligo
pairs amplifying the 5', middle, and 3' sections of the transcript. One possible explanation could be that the secondary structure of the URE3-BP mRNA at the location of the
URE3-BP (350–378) shRNA could interfere sufficiently
with the RISC being able to cleave the mRNA but still
allow RISC binding, allowing for a degree of translational
inhibition in addition to some mRNA destruction.

The E. histolytica U6 promoter appears to be functional
and producing shRNAs: the Northern blots of the small
RNAs detected two sizes of small RNAs when probed with
oligos that were complementary to the individual sense
and antisense strands of the shRNAs. These may represent
the unprocessed hairpin and the resulting siRNAs after
Dicer processing. Surprisingly, the abundance of the small
RNA was not proportional to the level of silencing. Northern blots may not be sensitive enough to identify lowlevel small RNA production, with low-level production
adequate for protein knockdown.

Conclusion
We report the knockdown of three genes in this study: Igl,
the intermediate subunit of the Gal/GalNAc lectin; the
calcium-responsive transcription factor URE3-BP; the
membrane-binding protein EhC2A, by transfecting E. histolytica with expression vectors using the E. histolytica U6
promoter to drive expression of shRNAs targeting endogenous genes. We have previously reported the knockdown
of transmembrane kinase PATMK [39]. These genes come

For qRT-PCR, samples were amplified with the actin oligo pair as a control, or with four pairs of Igl oligos: Igl 5', amplifying the 5' end of both Igl1
and Igl2, Igl 3', amplifying both Igl1 and Igl2 at the 3' end, and oligos specific for Igl1 and Igl2 individually, amplifying Igl1- or Igl2-specific sequences
near the 5' end. Oligo sequences are shown in Table 3. Three biological replicates were each assayed in quadruplicate sets with each oligo pair, with
the exception of the HM1:IMSS samples, which had one biological replicate. Igl and actin levels were calculated by using both the relative standard
curve and the ΔΔC(t) method [54,55] and actin was used as the normalization control. The average level of Igl in the GFP control shRNA
transfectants was defined as 100% expression of Igl mRNA for computational purposes. Igl levels in the Igl transfectant samples and nontransfected
HM1:IMSS were compared to the GFP control, and are shown as the percentage of Igl mRNA relative to the GFP control (± SE). Statistical analysis
was performed using Student's t test (two-tailed), groups were compared using ANOVA, and the GraphPad QuickCalcs P-value calculator [53] was
used to calculate P-values.

Methods
Culture of trophozoites
E. histolytica strain HM1:IMSS trophozoites were grown
axenically in TYI-S-33 (Trypticase-yeast extract-ironserum) (TYI) medium supplemented with 1× Diamond's
vitamins (SAFC Biosciences, Lenexa, KS, USA), 15% heatinactivated adult bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products,
West Sacramento, CA), 100 U of penicillin/ml and 100 μg
streptomycin sulfate/ml (Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA), at 37°C in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks [47] in a volume of 50 ml, and then transfected as described below.

Each membrane was probed with anti-actin antibody as a
loading control, or with anti-URE3-BP antibody. URE3-BP
protein levels are summarized in Table 6.

Transfection of amebae
Plasmid DNA was prepared using the HiSpeed Qiagen
Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Medium 199
(M199) (Gibco BRL/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was
supplemented with 5.7 mM cysteine, 25 mM HEPES, and
0.6 mM ascorbic acid [48], adjusted to pH 7.0 and filtersterilized. Twenty μg plasmid DNA diluted in 100 μl supplemented M199s medium (M199S) in 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes was mixed with 15 μl of SuperFect or Attractene
transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and
incubated at room temperature to allow transfectioncomplex formation as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Heat-inactivated bovine serum was added to the remaining M199S to a 15% concentration. Amebae were harvested by tapping the tissue culture flasks on a benchtop,
were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and suspended in M199S with serum to 2.5 × 105 amebae/ml.
Tubes containing transfection complexes were filled with
the suspended trophozoites, the contents mixed by inversion, and the tubes were incubated horizontally for 3
hours at 37°C. Tube contents were added to warm TYI in
25 cm2 tissue culture flasks, and incubated overnight at
37°C. 15 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) was added for selection after the overnight incubation [49]. After 4–5 days, 25 ml of the TYI was removed to
a new 25 cm2 tissue culture flask, and 25 ml fresh TYI with
hygromycin was added to each of the flasks. Transfectants
were usually apparent 1–2 weeks after transfection.
E. histolytica shRNA constructs
All short hairpin RNAs used in this study were expressed
by the U6 promoter [GenBank:U43841] [41] (Figure 1A)
and cloned into the amebic expression vector pGIR310, a
modification of pGIR308 [49,50] by the addition of a
short polylinker containing HindIII, SalI, and NotI restriction sites (Figure 1B). Modified pGIR310 conferred resistance to hygromycin in E. histolytica and to ampicillin in
Escherichia coli (E. coli). All shRNA constructs used in these
studies had the same structure: a short hairpin consisting

The average URE3-BP transcript level as measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to actin was defined as being 100% in the GFP shRNA control
transfectants. HM1:IMSS nontransfected amebae were also included. Three different oligo pairs amplifying the 5', middle, and 3' sections of URE3-BP
were used (sequences and locations are shown in Table 3). Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. Three biological replicates were each
assayed in quadruplicate with each oligo pair, with the exception of the HM1:IMSS samples, which had one biological replicate. Values are expressed

members. From the pool of selected 21 mer sequences,
those with runs of more than 4 As or Ts were eliminated,

Sequence selection for shRNA constructs
The Ambion siRNA finder [51] was used to select possible
siRNA sequences of 21 mers beginning with two adenine
residues. To select sequences that would target Igl1 and
Igl2 both separately and simultaneously, those portions
of their coding sequences which were identical or divergent were input separately, while the entire coding
sequence of URE3-BP was used to select siRNA sequences.
For EhC2A the portion of the gene sequence selected for
targeting was the poly-proline region (bases 301–567)

(2777–2805) were selected with 30 μg/ml hygromycin for 48
hours before harvesting. HM1:IMSS non-transfected amebae
were included as negative controls. Small RNAs were
extracted using the mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit
(Ambion) (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).
Fifty μg small RNA were loaded per lane on a 12% denaturing acrylamide gel and transferred to membrane. rRNA
bands were analyzed to ensure equal RNA loading. Oligo
probes matching to the sense and antisense strands of the
hairpins were end-labeled with 32P and were hybridized with
each corresponding sample blot overnight at 37°C overnight,
washed with low and medium stringency conditions, and
exposed overnight to film. Note the two product sizes,
which may correspond to the unprocessed hairpin (~60–70
nucleotides) (blue arrows) and the processed siRNA products (~30 nucleotides) (red arrows).

and those with GC content between 30% and 50% were
lengthened to 29 bp by adding the next eight bases in the
genomic sequence. The TIGR E. histolytica Genome Project
database [52] was used to check that each 29-bp sequence
was unique to its gene, with non-unique ones eliminated.
A minimum of four unique sequences were selected per
gene. To create a scrambled control sequence, one of the
selected sequences was chosen, and the bases were scrambled (each began with the AA dinucleotide); these
sequences were then checked to confirm they matched
nothing in the E. histolytica genome. In addition, a
sequence targeted to the green fluorescent protein (GFP)
was included as a control [30]. The chosen sequences,
those ultimately transfected into E. histolytica HM1:IMSS
trophozoites, are shown in Table 1. Constructs that did
not successfully transfect are not shown.
shRNA primer design
Primers were designed based on the method used by Gou
et al (2003) [30] to yield PCR-generated shRNA constructs
in a 2-step PCR process diagrammed in Figure 1. The final
PCR product contained the E. histolytica U6 promoter followed by the sense strand of the hairpin, the 9 bp loop
(TTCAAGAGA) [28], the antisense strand of the hairpin,
and the U6 terminator sequence [30]. An ApaI restriction
site (GGGCCC) was included between the 3' end of the
U6 promoter and the beginning of the shRNA sequence
[30]. To facilitate cloning of the PCR product into the
expression vector, a HindIII site was added to the 5' end of
the U6 promoter sequence, and a NotI site was added following the terminator sequence. The selected siRNA
sequences, shown in Table 1, were used to design oligos
to create shRNAs. Two rounds of PCR were employed to
generate the final shRNA constructs, using one forward
primer and two reverse primers, whose sequences are
listed in Table 2. In the first round of PCR, the E. histolytica
U6 promoter followed by the sense strand and the loop
were generated using a forward primer amplifying the 5'
end of the U6 promoter and a first reverse primer containing the sequence of the sense strand of the shRNA and the
future loop (Figure 1A, Table 2). A second round of PCR
created the completed shRNA construct: the product from
the first round was used as a template, using the same forward primer as in the first round, and a second reverse
primer containing the sequence of the loop, the antisense
strand sequence, and the U6 termination sequence (Figure 1A, Table 2). The control GFP sequence [30] was used
to design oligos for making a shRNA control construct.
Sense strand sequences chosen to make the Igl, URE3-BP
and EhC2A shRNA constructs successfully transfected into
trophozoites are shown in Table 1, and PCR oligos used
to amplify these sequences to generate shRNAs via PCR
are shown in Table 2.

PCR conditions for generating shRNAs
Initially, E. histolytica genomic DNA was used as a template for the first round of Igl shRNA PCRs. For the URE3BP and EhC2A shRNA PCRs, the cloned U6 promoter was
used as the PCR template: the Igl shRNA plasmids were
digested with HindIII and ApaI and the U6 promoter was
gel-purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Two rounds of PCR were used to
generate the shRNA constructs.

The first PCR round generated the sense strand of the hairpin and the loop. Reaction volumes of 40 μl were set up,
each consisting of 0.6 μl SAHARA™ DNA polymerase (Bioline USA Inc., Taunton, MA, USA), 4 μl 10× SAHARA™
PCR buffer, 3.2 μl 50 mM MgCl2, 2 μl dNTP mix (stock 10
mM each), 0.4 μl U6 HindIII forward oligo (100 μM
stock), 0.4 μl R1 oligo (100 μM stock), 1 μl (200 ng E. histolytica genomic DNA or 25 ng gel-purified digest of HindIII/ApaI U6 promoter), and 28.4 μl sterile water. Cycling
conditions were as follows: 95°C for 8 minutes, 10 cycles
of 95°C 45 sec, 40°C 1 min, 68°C 1 min 30 sec; 25 cycles
of 95°C 45 seconds, 52°C 1 min, 68°C 1 min 30 sec, and
a 5 min final extension at 68°C. 5 μl of each PCR product
was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to check that
the products were ~380 bp.
In the second PCR round, the first round PCR product was
used as a template to add the antisense strand of the hairpin, the terminator sequence and the NotI site. Each 100
μl-volume reaction contained 2 μl SAHARA™ DNA
Polymerase (Bioline USA Inc., Taunton, MA, USA), 10 μl
10× SAHARA™ PCR buffer, 8 μl 50 mM MgCl2, 5 μl dNTP
mix (10 mM each), 0.8 μl U6 HindIII forward oligo (100
μM), 0.8 μl R2 oligo (100 μM), 2 μl PCR product from the
first PCR round, and 71.4 μl sterile water. Cycling conditions were: 95°C for 8 minutes, 10 cycles of 95°C 45 sec,
18.5°C 1 min 30 sec, 68°C 1 min 30 sec; 30 cycles of
95°C 45 seconds, 55°C 1 min, 68°C 1 min 30 sec, and a
5 min final extension at 68°C. The low annealing temperature in the early cycles of the second PCR was used since
the loop is the only overlap between the first round product and the second round reverse oligo. The second round
PCR products were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis
for products of the correct size (~420 bp). Sometimes a
smaller product was present in addition to the correct size
product in the final PCR product; this was ignored since it
had no effect on the subsequent cloning steps. These final
PCR products were ethanol-precipitated, then they and
modified pGIR310 were digested with HindIII and NotI.
The digested expression vector was gel-purified using the
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
The PCR products were ethanol-precipitated at -20°C
overnight, resuspended, ligated into modified pGIR310,
transformed into E. coli, and colonies screened. Plasmids
with inserts were sequenced, and those with perfect U6

promoter and hairpin sequences were cultured, plasmids
were isolated using the Qiagen HiSpeed Maxiprep Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and transformed into
HM1:IMSS strain trophozoites as described above.
Western blotting
The Igl, URE3-BP, or EhC2A shRNA transfectants were
grown in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks and selected beginning with 15 μg/ml of hygromycin, with the hygromycin
level increased every 24 hours until the final level of selection was reached, and this level was maintained for 48
hours before harvesting. The GFP control, all three Igl, and
the URE3-BP (350–378) transfectants were selected with
100 μg/ml, the URE3-BP (580–608) shRNA transfectants
with 75 μg/ml, and the EhC2A samples with 90 μg/ml
hygromycin. The final concentration of hygromycin selection differs since the selection was increased until the
desired level of knockdown was achieved. There were
three biological replicates per shRNA transfectant, and
one for the HM1:IMSS nontransfected trophozoites. Trophozoites were harvested as described above for transfection, counted, resuspended in ice cold Lysis Buffer (150
mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 5× Sigma protease inhibitor cocktail (P2714) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 25 μg/
ml E-64 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)) at an initial
concentration of 2 × 106–5 × 106 amebae/ml, and lysed by
sonication by pulsing twice for 10 seconds each with a 10
second rest on ice between pulses. Protein was quantified
and sample lysates were diluted to the same protein concentration, were serially-diluted 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 with
Lysis Buffer, and were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12%
(Igl) or 15% (URE-BP and EhC2A) gels. All sample lysates
and dilutions were done in triplicate (technical replicates). Gels were transferred to PVDF membrane, membranes were cut in half so each half could be probed
separately, were blocked in 5% milk, and incubated with
either antibodies against Igl1, URE3-BP, EhC2A, or control antibodies against actin (anti-actin from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA) or Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)).

The ECL kit from Roche (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used to treat membranes after secondary antibody incubation, bands were visualized on film,
film images were electronically scanned, and Scion Image
Beta 4.0.3 software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD,
USA) was used to quantify band intensity. The background value was subtracted from each band value, the
ratio of Igl, EhC2A, or URE3-BP band value to the control
actin band value was taken for normalization, and then
the sample shRNA transfectant lines were compared to the
control GFP shRNA or scrambled shRNA transfectant line.
HM1:IMSS nontransfected samples were also included.
Values for each shRNA transfectant were averaged, and the
SE for each average was calculated using the total number

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/38

of biological replicates multiplied by the number of technical replicates. Statistical analysis was performed using
Student's t test (two-tailed) or ANOVA. The GraphPad
QuickCalcs P-value calculator was used to calculate the Pvalues [53].
Isolation of total RNA
Igl, URE3-BP, and control GFP transfectant shRNA lines
were selected with hygromycin as described above for
Western blotting, and samples were collected and frozen
in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 80°C for RNA isolation at the same time as those harvested for crude lysate for protein analysis. Total RNA isolated from each shRNA transfectant and nontransfected
HM1:IMSS sample using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) was treated with RNase-free recombinant DNase I (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for 30
minutes at 37°C, and purified on RNeasy columns using
the RNeasy Mini kit as per the manufacturer's instructions
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Five μg RNA per sample was
reverse-transcribed using SuperScriptII (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and anchored oligo dT, including
samples with no reverse transcriptase added (no-RT controls). To check samples for residual DNA contamination
in the no-RT controls, each was screened with primers specific for the Jacob cyst-specific gene [35]. If residual DNA
contamination was observed, the RNA was treated again
with DNase I as above, re-purified on RNeasy columns,
and re-screened.
Quantitative reverse-transcription real-time PCR (qRTPCR)
After the screen for residual DNA contamination was
completed, the cDNA was quantified, and sample cDNAs
were diluted to 100 ng/μl. HM1:IMSS cDNA was also serially-diluted for making a standard curve. All primers used
for qRT-PCR in this study were selected to amplify <400
bp sections of mRNA. Amplification of actin [35] was performed for use as a normalization control. Oligo
sequences used in qRT-PCR are shown in Table 3. Each
oligo pair was checked using the E. histolytica genomic
database [52] to validate that only the gene intended
would be amplified, except for actin and Jacob, which
were designed to detect all family members [35]. An MJ
Research Opticon2 DNA Engine (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA) was utilized for all qRT-PCR runs. ~200 ng of each
sample or control cDNA, or serially-diluted HM1:IMSS
cDNA for standard curves, was added to each sample well
in a 96-well plate for each set of amplifications. cDNA
from each biological replicate was run in quadruplicate
(technical replicates), and there were three biological replicates per transfectant line, except for HM1:IMSS nontransfected samples, which had one biological replicate.
No-RT controls were also included for each set of samples.
Each well contained in addition to the cDNA: 1.25 U Hot-

StarTaq (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), 1× HotStarTaq PCR
Buffer, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM each dNTP, 1 μM each
oligo, 1:10,000 dilution of Sybrgreen (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), 0.15% Triton X-100, and water to a
volume to 25 μl per well.
qRT-PCR cycling conditions were 95°C for 15 minutes,
followed by 40 cycles of 95°C 30 s; 54°C 30 s; 72°C 45 s,
followed by one cycle of 72°C for 3 min. At the end of
amplification, a melt curve was performed from 70°C to
95°C, increasing 0.2°C every cycle with a 5-second hold.
The CT values were averaged for each oligo pair for each set
of technical replicates, and sample values were normalized to the housekeeping gene actin. The GFP shRNA
transfectant line was used as a baseline control for comparison to the URE3-BP and Igl shRNA transfectant lines;
HM1:IMSS samples were included as a secondary control.
The differences in gene expression for the URE3-BP and
Igl transfectant lines as compared to the GFP transfectant
line were calculated by using both the relative standard
curve and the comparative C(t) method (ΔΔ C(t) method)
[54,55]. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's
t test (two-tailed), groups were also compared using
ANOVA, and the GraphPad QuickCalcs P-value calculator
[53] was used to calculate P-values.
Isolation of small RNAs
Three of the Igl shRNA transfectant lines, Igl (1198–
1226), Igl (2412–2440), and Igl (2777–2805), as well as
the two PATMK knockdown shRNA lines, PATMK (2273–
2301) and PATMK (3552–3580), and the PATMK scrambled control [39], were grown in 25 cm2 tissue culture
flasks, and selected with 30 μg/ml hygromycin, since this
level of selection had yielded substantial knockdown of
PATMK [39]. Small RNAs were isolated from each sample
as well as control nontransfected HM1:IMSS trophozoites
using Ambion's mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Applied
Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Northern blotting of small RNAs
Oligo probes were designed to match the sense or antisense strands of each hairpin. Fifty μg of small RNAs were
loaded per lane on a 12% denaturing acrylamide gel and
transferred to Hybond™-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham
Biosciences/GE Healthcare Biosciences Corp, Piscataway,
NJ, USA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. rRNA
bands were analyzed to insure equal RNA loading. Oligo
probes matching to the sense or antisense strands of the
hairpins were end-labelled with 32P and were hybridized
with each corresponding sample blot strip overnight at
37°C overnight, washed with low and medium stringency
conditions, and exposed overnight to film.
