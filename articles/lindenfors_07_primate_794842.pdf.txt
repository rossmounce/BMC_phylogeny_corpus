Abstract
Background: Social and competitive demands often differ between the sexes in mammals. These
differing demands should be expected to produce variation in the relative sizes of various brain
structures. Sexual selection on males can be predicted to influence brain components handling
sensory-motor skills that are important for physical competition or neural pathways involving
aggression. Conversely, because female fitness is more closely linked to ecological factors and social
interactions that enable better acquisition of resources, social selection on females should select
for brain components important for navigating social networks. Sexual and social selection acting
on one sex could produce sexual dimorphism in brain structures, which would result in larger
species averages for those same brain structures. Alternatively, sex-specific selection pressures
could produce correlated effects in the other sex, resulting in larger brain structures for both males
and females of a species. Data are presently unavailable for the sex-specific sizes of brain structures
for anthropoid primates, but under either scenario, the effects of sexual and social selection should
leave a detectable signal in average sizes of brain structures for different species.
Results: The degree of male intra-sexual selection was positively correlated with several
structures involved in autonomic functions and sensory-motor skills, and in pathways relating to
aggression and aggression control. The degree of male intra-sexual selection was not correlated
with relative neocortex size, which instead was significantly positively correlated with female social
group size, but negatively correlated with male group size.
Conclusion: Sexual selection on males and social selection on females have exerted different
effects on primate brain architecture. Species with a higher degree of male intra-sexual selection
carry a neural signature of an evolutionary history centered on physical conflicts, but no traces of
increased demands on sociocognitive tasks. Conversely, female sociality is indicated to have driven
the evolution of socio-cognitive skills. Primate brain architecture is therefore likely to be a product
of ecological and species-specific social factors as well as different sex-specific selection pressures.
Our results also highlight the need for acquisition and analysis of sex-specific brain components in
mammals.

Background
Primate brain architecture has been shown to correlate
with both ecological [1-3] and social [4-9] factors. Social
and competitive demands often differ between the sexes,
however, which should leave predictable marks in the relative sizes of key brain structures [4,8-11]. The aim of this
paper was to investigate the relationship between selection in relation to sex and the evolution of brain architecture in primates, and to draw attention to this largely
neglected aspect of mammalian brain evolution.
Selection in relation to sex occurs whenever any genetically influenced morphological trait or behavior increases
the fitness of one sex, but not the other. One well-known
instance of this process in mammals is male-male competition for sexual access to females, which has resulted in a
diverse array of characters important for males in conflict
situations [12,13]. In primates, for example, this type of
male intra-sexual selection has been shown to result in
sexual size dimorphism in traits important for male combat, such as canine teeth [14,15] and body mass [16,17].
We used phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate
whether two types of selection in relation to sex-intra-sexual selection on males through male-male physical competition and social selection in females-have had
predictable effects on species-typical brain structures in
primates. To be successful in male-male physical competition, a primate male in a polygynous species not only
needs to be large and have imposing canines, but also to
display, control and use his weapons and size effectively.
No matter what their physical equipment might be, males
without such abilities should self-evidently be less able to
succeed in competitive situations. A male can potentially
be proficient in the use of his assets through quick, agile
and skillful movements, thus gaining an edge on his
opponent physically, or he can use intelligence to outwit
the competition, thus decreasing the amount of direct
physical conflict necessary. The former strategy involves
physical movements, while the latter involves cognitive
processes intended at avoiding such movements.
From this reasoning, we derived four, not mutually exclusive, hypotheses involving male intra-sexual selection. (i)
If physical combat is important, the effects of sexual selection on brain architecture should mainly act on brain
regions with roles in motor skills and the coordination
between sensory and motor information [10], whereas
(ii) if non-combat social skills are important, we would
expect to see effects of sexual selection on brain regions
with more general integrative and associative functions,
such as the neocortex [4-9]. (iii) It may also be the case
that larger male body mass, resulting from male intra-sexual selection, puts increasing demands on the parts of the
brain that handle autonomic nervous activity. (iv) Finally,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/20

selection due to increased demands from competitive situations would also be expected to influence structures
that relate to aggression, threat, fear and aggression control.
We investigated four predictions derived from these
hypotheses. These are all subject to the caveat that brain
functions are often distributed between many separate
structures; selection for a specific function will therefore
tend to change several functionally connected brain structures simultaneously [18,19]. (1) We expected sexual
selection for better motor skills [10] to influence components within almost all parts of the brain that function in
sensory-motor activities. These range from the motor cortex and other cortical areas in the neocortex that initiate
voluntary motor activities, through the mesencephalon
and diencephalon, to the cerebellum in which fine adjustments of movements are made, and further through the
medulla oblongata and pons. (2) In contrast, if males are
more commonly in need of strategic cognitive abilities
when competing, this should mainly, if not exclusively, be
reflected in the relative size of the telencephalon through
an increased neocortex volume [20]. (3) If effects of sexual
selection are limited to effects that are caused simply by
the need to control a larger body, then this should produce relatively larger brain components involved in autonomic nervous activity, primarily the hypothalamus and
the medulla. (4) Structures involved in facilitating aggressive behavior (the central gray region in the mesencephalon, the hypothalamus, and amygdala) are expected
to be larger in more sexually selected species; in contrast,
structures relating to controlling aggression (such as the
septum) should be smaller, although this last expectation
is not straightforward as it could as well be argued that
more aggressive species also need to better control this
aggression.
We also investigated a hypothesis related to the drivers of
female reproductive success. In comparison with males,
female reproductive success is more closely linked to ecological factors, including the acquisition and defense of
resources and protection from predators [21-23]. That
causes and consequences of sociality should be considered independently for the two sexes is also indicated by
observations that separate dominance hierarchies are
often maintained for males and females in primate groups
[24], and that primate social groups simply tend to have
more females than males [25,26]. Although males also
form alliances in primates [27-29], the conditions favoring these alliances tend to be more restrictive both within
and across species [30,31]. Thus, cooperation is likely to
be more important for females and also more closely tied
to ecological demands than in males. In terms of social
selection, we therefore focused on one key prediction
(prediction 5): we expected that brain components

BMC Biology 2007, 5:20

involved in tasks relating to sociality and cooperation are
selected for primarily in females [5,11,32], predicting that
these brain structures are larger in species characterized by
greater female sociality. Such brain centers are primarily,
but not exclusively, found in the telencephalon (cerebrum), and within the telencephalon, in the neocortex in
particular [33,34].
In summary, at least two sex-specific selection factors
should leave imprints on how the brain is organized in
different primate species, producing five predictions. Predictions 1â4 involve sexual selection on males for
increased sensory-motor coordination, increased size of
the areas relating to autonomic functions, cognitive abilities in the context of strategic planning and social networks, and changes in the structures that relate to
aggression and fear. The fifth and final prediction involves
social selection on females, related to increased cognitive
abilities in the context of social networks.
If social or sexual selection exists, it could have one of two
effects on sex-specific brain measurements. On the one
hand, it could select for larger brain structures in both
sexes; on the other hand, it could lead to sexual dimorphisms. Regarding the first possibility, recent research has
shown that in anthropoid primates, the degree of sexual
selection on males is correlated with larger canine size and
greater body mass not only in males, but also in females
[15,17]. Effects on females as a result of selection on
males could be due to genetic correlations between the
sexes in genes determining the character in question [3539], but this is usually expected to be a temporary phenomenon [36,40,41]. More probable is that selection on
females correlates with intrasexual selection operating in
males [40,42], although other mechanisms are also possible [40].
Alternatively, if a selection pressure results in sexual
dimorphisms in brain architecture, this would also result
in a higher average value for the trait in a species, simply
because the values for one sex would be increased relative
to the other sex and would therefore increase the mean for
that species. We therefore had strong reasons to expect
that selection in relation to sex should be clearly detectable regardless of its specific effects on male and female
brains. We emphasize these points because the brain volume data examined in our study are from unsexed primate specimens (Additional files 1 and 2) [43]. The
results presented below provide a strong argument for
obtaining sex-specific measures for more detailed analyses
within and across species.

Results
Our first set of analyses concerned the major subdivisions
of the brain. These tests showed that body mass dimor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/20

phism was significantly positively correlated with the relative volumes of the medulla oblongata, mesencephalon
and diencephalon, and negatively correlated with the relative volumes of the pons and telencephalon (Table 1).
The telencephalon may also have been the target of social
selection differing between the sexes, as indicated by a
negative correlation between relative telencephalon volume and male group size, but a positive correlation with
female group size, whereas correlations in the opposite
direction were found in analyses of the diencephalon
(Table 1). These analyses controlled for total brain volume (see Methods).
To further assess how functional differences between
males and females operate on different brain structures,
we analyzed specific structures of the telencephalon. The
results concerning social selection showed that sociality
for both males and females was correlated with different
components of the telencephalon. Whereas male group
size was significantly negatively correlated with the relative volumes of the septum, schizocortex and perhaps the
neocortex (partial regression p = 0.064), female group size
was positively correlated with relative neocortex volume
[32] and negatively correlated with relative hippocampus
volume (Table 2). Body mass dimorphism also correlated
negatively with the relative sizes of the septum, striatum
and schizocortex, but positively with the relative size of
the amygdala (Table 2). As in the case of the brain components, these analyses also controlled for total brain volume.
For methodological reasons involving a possibly confounding effect of body mass (see Methods), we re-ran all
analyses with female body mass forced into the regression
models (Additional files 3 and 4). These results support
the same patterns as those presented above, except that
the relative volume of the pons in this scenario was not
significantly correlated with sexual size dimorphism
(Additional file 3). Although these results are similar to
those presented, Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) indicate
that these regression models were unstable (see Methods).
To ensure that our results were not due to undue influences of results concerning the large volume of the neocortex, we repeated our analyses after removing the
neocortex volumes from the "remaining brain volume"
variable used to correct for allometric effects (Additional
files 5 and 6). These results also support the general patterns presented above, except that the diencephalon was
no longer significantly correlated with male and female
group sizes, and female group size was positively correlated with the relative volumes of the septum and striatum
but not significantly correlated with that of the hippocampus.

Variation in female group sizes is larger than variation in
male group sizes, which could unduly influence our
model choice in the stepwise regression analyses. The
larger variance of female group size could tend to include
female group size in the model first, thereby possibly forcing the correlated measure of male group size out of the
models. For this reason, we checked all results by including the group sizes of the two sexes independently in all
models. This produced qualitatively similar results to
those presented above; for example, whenever male group
size was non-significant when female group size was also
included, it was also non-significant when female group
size was not included. Thus, with only the few exceptions
outlined in the previous two paragraphs, the results presented in Tables 1 and 2 remained consistent when running the analyses with alternative assumptions.

Discussion
Our analyses indicate that selection in relation to sex has
been an important influence on primate brain architecture. The results showed that sexual selection on males has
acted positively on the relative sizes of the medulla, mesencephalon and diencephalon, but negatively on the pons
and telencephalon. In the case of social selection, the average group size of females was positively correlated with
the relative size of the telencephalon. As has already been
shown elsewhere using the same dataset [32], this latter
effect is apparently mediated through a positive correlation between female group size and the relative size of the
neocortex. This indicates that female sociality is responsible for the evolutionary change in relative neocortex size
that has taken place in haplorhine primates. These results
also suggest that social demands on females and competitive demands on males require skills mainly handled by
different brain components.
Our analyses fail to support the hypothesis that sexual
selection on males has selected for enhanced cognitive
abilities, based in particular on the negative correlation
between sexual dimorphism and relative telencephalon
volume, and the lack of a significant association between
sexual dimorphism and neocortex volume. Further indications that selection on physical combat skills are more
important is that the mesencephalon, diencephalon (containing the hypothalamus) and amygdala, all involved in
governing aggressive behaviors, are positively correlated
with the degree of sexual selection, whereas the septum,
which has a role in facilitating aggression control, is
instead negatively correlated with the degree of sexual
selection. Moreover, male group size is positively correlated with the relative volume of the diencephalon (but
see Additional file 5) and negatively correlated with relative septum size, further strengthening the conclusion that
aggression is an evolutionarily important component of
male-male interactions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/20

The main structures of the brain that were positively correlated with the degree of male intra-sexual competition
(the medulla oblongata, mesencephalon and diencephalon) all contain important motor centers. The same
is true for the cerebellum and the telencephalon, but the
former is not significantly correlated with size dimorphism and the latter even exhibits a negative correlation.
Given the distributed nature of the motor centers in the
brain, analyses of the main brain structures provides only
indirect support for the hypothesis that sexual selection
acts on motor centers; more detailed data on specific brain
structures are therefore needed.
The medulla oblongata and the diencephalon are important for autonomic nervous system activity. Significant
correlations involving these structures suggest that larger
body size resulting from sexual selection has placed
demands on brain structures involved in handling a larger
body. Thus, while not providing direct support, our
results are in line with two hypotheses that deserve further
scrutiny: that sexual selection selects for (i) brain structures important for success in male-male conflict through
better body control, and (ii) better handling of a larger
body through increased importance of structures involved
in autonomic tasks.
The effects of social selection are more clear-cut in that
they suggest that different strategies used by males and
females have left marks on primate brain architecture,
with female social group size positively and male group
size negatively correlated with telencephalon size. Thus,
demands of male and female sociality differ fundamentally in skills governed by the telencephalon, and within
this region, especially the neocortex. The neocortex is
important for cognitive skills involved in navigating complex webs of social relationships [44,45]. As stated in the
Background, there are several reasons to expect that such
social abilities concern the reproductive success of females
more than males. Our results also indicate that the relationship between neocortex volume and male group size
actually may be negative, further highlighting the specifically female aspect of handling social relationships in primates. More detailed analyses on the relative sizes of
structures within the neocortex would be expected to
reveal that it is these areas that process social information
that are positively correlated with female group size.
An important question concerns the epigenetic mechanisms by which species differences in brain architecture
arise during ontogeny, in particular the relative roles of
early, genetically guided ontogenetic processes versus later
processes influenced substantially by environmental
input and/or hormones. For example, experimental evidence indicates that perturbations of sensory inputs cause
neural reorganization [46,47]. However, regional differ-

Page 5 of 9
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2007, 5:20

entiation occurs early in ontogeny, prior to and/or independently of neural innervation from the periphery
[48,49], and mutations that influence architectonics prior
to innervation by the periphery have been discovered
[50]. The role of neurogenesis later in mammalian ontogeny (e.g. in adults) appears to be relatively minor in primates, and restricted to the hippocampus and olfactory
bulbs [51-53]. Thus, adult neurogenesis is highly unlikely
to explain species differences in overall brain architecture.
Finally, many species differences in brain structure size
fall outside the range of intra-species variation [18,54].
Thus, while earlier, predominantly prenatal processes are
undoubtedly crucial, species differences, such as those
analyzed here, may be somewhat moderated by later
ontogenetic effects.
From our study of unsexed specimens, we cannot determine if social and sexual selection have produced sexual
dimorphisms in brain size, or whether selection acting on
one sex has had correlated effects on the other sex, thus
producing larger brains for that species. The results presented here therefore emphasize the value of obtaining
sex-specific data on brain structures. Several authors have
proposed or tested hypotheses for sexual dimorphism in
brain structures [10,11,20,55,56]. Several additional
hypotheses can be tested. For example, in more social species, females should be expected to have relatively larger
neocortices than males. Contrary to our results, however,
the fact that reported incidences of innovation behavior
are higher in males than in females across species [57]
could be taken to indicate that males have greater cognitive abilities. It can possibly be argued that female primates use their neocortices mainly to navigate social
webs, whereas male neocortices are free to perform other
tasks. On the other hand, as indicated by our results, in
more sexually selected species, a suite of other brain structures should be larger in males than in females. To investigate such sexual dimorphisms, however, sex-specific
measures of brain components are necessary.
We have no reason to expect that the patterns presented
here apply only to anthropoid primates; similar patterns
should be detectable in other mammal clades, provided of
course that sufficient variation in sociality and/or intrasexual competition exists. It is even possible that these factors have driven brain evolution in mammals and thus
may explain differences in brain architecture among different mammal orders. This especially concerns the relatively large neocortex-a hallmark of primates and a trait
indicated by this study to be a consequence of the high
degree of female sociality in primates-but should also
involve other structures.

Conclusion
The results presented here indicate that selection in relation to sex is an underappreciated force in primate brain
evolution. Social selection on females and sexual selection on males accounts for significant variation in primate
brain architecture. Whereas female sociality is tied to
increased cognitive abilities, male sociality and sexual
selection on males is not. Instead, sexual selection on
males has favored brain structures involved in aggression,
sensory motor functions and autonomic functions. This is
important because selection pressures acting on the brain
have previously almost exclusively been treated as uniform in males and females. Given available data, however, it is impossible to know whether these effects lead to
dimorphism or correlated effects in both sexes. Development of new datasets that make use of sexed brains will be
needed to address this fundamental question.

Methods
Data on volumes of different brain structures were gathered from the literature [43,58]. The major structures of
the brain included in the analyses were the pons, medulla
oblongata (including the reticular formation), cerebellum
(including the brachium and the nuclei pontis), mesencephalon (excluding the reticular nucleus), diencephalon
and telencephalon (cerebrum). To further investigate
hypotheses regarding different substructures of the telencephalon, we also used volume information for the septum, striatum, amygdala, schizocortex (entorhinal,
perirhinal and presubicular cortices), hippocampus, and
neocortex (isocortical grey and underlying white matter).
As noted above, information was unavailable for the sexes
of the animals for the brain measurements.
We also gathered data on body mass [59] and group size
[60] for the species with brain data. Female group size
served as a proxy for social complexity [32], whereas sexual size dimorphism was used to measure sexual selection
[17]. The number of data points limited our choice for
alternative variables indicating strength of sexual selection. Instead, we repeated some of the analyses using
canine dimorphism as a proxy for sexual selection, and
these analyses produced results similar to those for body
mass. The fact that more data were available on primate
body masses than canine dimensions led us to prefer the
former to the latter; thus, body mass dimorphism results
are presented here. Although data exist for strepsirhine
primates, these were not included in the analyses because
there is very little variation in both sociality and sexual
size dimorphism in the species for which data on the volumes of different brain structures is also available [61-63].
All variables were log10-transformed prior to analysis.

more dimorphic and live in larger groups than platyrrhine

(New World) primates. That is, the causal factors we use
in this study are similar within taxonomic groups, because
of their shared evolutionary history. For this reason, we
employed phylogenetically independent contrasts that
use differences between species and taxonomic groups
instead of the species' values themselves [64]. This
approach produces statistics untainted by problems
caused by similarity due to common descent. We used
Purvis' [65] estimate of primate phylogeny, which was created using a super-tree technique to combine a large
number of source phylogenies. This phylogeny uses information published to the date of its construction and
unites knowledge gathered from both molecular and morphological data. It is therefore based on more information, and covers more species, than any alternative
phylogeny. Hypothesis testing was performed using the
aforementioned phylogenetically independent contrasts
[64], as implemented in the computer program PDAP
[66]. Diagnostic tests showed that branch lengths given in
Purvis [64] needed no adjustment [67].
Because we were interested in investigating the effects of
multiple independent variables on different brain components, we analyzed the influence of these variables using
stepwise multiple regression. To investigate which variables were significantly correlated with the dependent variables, we used a backwards-removal procedure with all
variables initially included in the model, and then
sequentially removed variables with significance levels >
0.1. Because correlations exist between female body mass
and total brain volumes, between female body mass and
dimorphism, and between male and female group sizes,
we tested whether collinearity rendered our multiple
regression models unstable by calculating Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) [68]. With only one exception, the VIFs
were < 10, indicating that collinearity was unlikely to have
a major impact on the stability of the models [68,69]. The
exception involved female body mass and "remaining
brain volumes," which had VIFs> 10, but these analyses
were restricted to secondary analyses (Additional files 3
and 4).
To control for allometric effects, we subtracted the volume
of the brain component under scrutiny from the total
brain volume and used this "remaining brain volume" as
a covariate in all regression models. Including total brain
volume instead of the "remaining brain volume" as a covariate produced results similar to those presented here,
but we feel that the measure we used better corrects for
part-whole correlation problems. The volumes of all
examined brain parts were closely correlated to our
"remaining brain volume" measure (p << 0.001; Table 1).
We chose "remaining brain volume" rather than body
mass when controlling for allometric effects primarily
because including female body mass and "remaining

brain volume" together in the regression models almost
always gave non-significant partial regression coefficients
for female body mass. In addition, brain volume is both
statistically and conceptually closer to the brain components under scrutiny than is body mass. To make sure that
our results were not due to indirect effects of body mass,
we double-checked our regression models by forcing
female body mass into the equations (Additional files 3
and 4). Because the effect of sexual selection on male size
has been shown to be a main cause of sexual size dimorphism in haplorhine primates [17], inclusion of male
body mass has the unwanted effect of including effects of
sexual selection in the body mass measure. For this reason, inclusion of male body mass, or the mixed body
masses of Stephan et al. [43], produced results that were
difficult to interpret. Although sexual selection also affects
female body mass, these effects are smaller than those on
males [17].
The telencephalon (cerebrum) is by far the largest substructure in the haplorhine primate brain (65â85% of the
total brain volume) and the largest substructure within
the telencephalon is by far the neocortex (40â80% of the
total brain volume). Selection pressures affecting the relative size of the neocortex could therefore also affect the
relative sizes of all other brain components (e.g. if the
neocortex becomes comparatively larger, the other brain
components automatically become comparatively
smaller). For this reason, we checked our results by repeating the analyses while excluding the neocortex from the
"remaining brain volume" variable. Results that were statistically significant in the first round of analyses but nonsignificant when excluding the neocortex volumes (or vice
versa) have to be judged carefully (Additional files 5 and
6).
