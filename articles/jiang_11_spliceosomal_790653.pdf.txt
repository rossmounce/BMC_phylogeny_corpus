Spliceosomal intron size expansion in
domesticated grapevine (Vitis vinifera)
Ke Jiang1*, Leslie R Goertzen2

Abstract
Background: Spliceosomal introns are important components of eukaryotic genes as their structure, sizes and
contents reflect the architecture of gene and genomes. Intron size, determined by both neutral evolution,
repetitive elements activities and potential functional constraints, varies significantly in eukaryotes, suggesting
unique dynamics and evolution in different lineages of eukaryotic organisms. However, the evolution of intron size,
is rarely studied. To investigate intron size dynamics in flowering plants, in particular domesticated grapevines, a
survey of intron size and content in wine grape (Vitis vinifera Pinot Noir) genes was conducted by assembling and
mapping the transcriptome of V. vinifera genes from ESTs to characterize and analyze spliceosomal introns.
Results: Uncommonly large size of spliceosomal intron was observed in V. vinifera genome, otherwise inconsistent
with overall genome size dynamics when comparing Arabidopsis, Populus and Vitis. In domesticated grapevine,
intron size is generally not related to gene function. The composition of enlarged introns in grapevines indicated
extensive transposable element (TE) activity within intronic regions. TEs comprise about 80% of the expanded
intron space and in particular, recent LTR retrotransposon insertions are enriched in these intronic regions,
suggesting an intron size expansion in the lineage leading to domesticated grapevine, instead of size contractions
in Arabidopsis and Populus. Comparative analysis of selected intronic regions in V. vinifera cultivars and wild
grapevine species revealed that accelerated TE activity was associated with grapevine domestication, and in some
cases with the development of specific cultivars.
Conclusions: In this study, we showed intron size expansion driven by TE activities in domesticated grapevines,
likely a result of long-term vegetative propagation and intensive human care, which simultaneously promote TE
proliferation and repress TE removal mechanisms such as recombination. The intron size expansion observed in
domesticated grapevines provided an example of rapid plant genome evolution in response to artificial selection
and propagation, and may shed light on the important genomic changes during domestication. In addition, the
transcriptome approach used to gather intron size data significantly improved annotations of the V. vinifera
genome.

Background
Eukaryotic genes contain spliceosomal introns that are
post-transcriptionally removed by the spliceosome, an
RNA-protein complex [1]. The length, position and
phase of spliceosomal introns are important components
to the evolution of genome architecture [2]. However,
most intronic regions are often considered ‘junk’ DNA
similar to intergenic regions or other non-coding
sequences. Increasing scrutiny of genomic data has
revealed many conserved non-coding sequences (CNS)

in the non-coding DNA of both plant and animal
genomes [3]. CNS may conduct important functions and
experience selective constraints [4]. One major function
of CNS is regulating gene expression via interactions
between small DNA motifs and transcription machinery
(transcription factors and RNA polymerase) [5]. The regulatory motifs are enriched in 5’ promoter regions and
the first introns of plant and animal genes [6].
Plant genomes usually have compact genes due to
small introns [7]. Arabidopsis, the plant model system
first completely sequenced, has an average gene size of
2000 bp and average intron size of 180 bp [8]. Intron
size is hypothesized to be constrained by energy use in

transcription, as large introns may require more energy
to be transcribed and spliced, so there is selection
against introns of excessive size [9]. However, in certain
genes, selection against intron size may be counteracted
by a selective preference for bigger introns with more
regulatory elements and finer control of gene expression
[10].
Transposable elements (TEs) are known to be major
components of plant genomes [11]. The origin and proliferation of TEs in plant genomes shaped plant genome
dynamics and genetic diversity. Unlike the human genome in which TEs are predominantly in introns [12],
plant TEs are usually found in intergenic regions, possibly a result of strong purifying selection against TE
insertions in exons and introns [13]. The observed plant
genome size expansions of cereals are thought to be
results of whole-genome duplications and TE invasions
in non-coding regions [14]. However, in a few cases, TE
insertions in introns altered temporal and spatial expression patterns of specific genes. The insertions caused
significant genetic and phenotypic changes and seemed
to be preserved by natural selection [15]. During plant
domestication, key traits selected by human may be the
result of genetic diversity generated by TE insertions
[16].
To further investigate intron size evolution in plant
genomes, we present a novel approach to identify and
analyze introns of large size using genomic data for a
domesticated grapevine cultivar (Vitis vinifera Pinot
Noir). The specific objectives are to investigate the size
distribution of introns; relationship between intron size
and gene function, determine the contents of introns
and examine the associations between intron size evolution and grapevine domestication. Generally, we show
that introns of truly extraordinary size are widespread in
cultivated grapevines, a phenomenon not observed in
other plant genomes.

Results
EST collection, processing and assembly

In total, 353,748 publicly available EST sequences of
V. vinifera were clustered into 26,111 clusters, 8,560 of
which represented by only one EST sequence. The largest cluster is composed of 1,998 EST sequences. The
distribution of cluster size suggested that one-third of
V. vinifera genes are not expressed at very high levels
(32.8% singletons) and a few (3 clusters contain more
than 1000 ESTs) genes are highly expressed across the
representative EST libraries. Among the 26,111 clusters,
5,678 clusters contain no intron, while 20,433 clusters
were predicted to be spliced. Among all clusters, 17,059
clusters were predicted to encode proteins, in which
15,369 predicted proteins show homology to Arabidopsis
proteins and 15,683 proteins show homology to Populus

proteins (BLASTP, E-value < 0.001). BLAST searches
against an EST database of other Vitis species showed
that 15,089 clusters (60.5%) had high similarity hits in at
least one other species of grapevine.
Identification and annotation of large genes and introns

The average intron size, predicted by the annotation of
the first draft sequences of Vitis vinifera Pinot Noir, is
slightly larger than other sequenced plants [17]. After
mapping the assembled consensus sequences to V. vinifera genomic regions, 2,697 introns having size between
3 kb and 100 kb were identified in 2,563 genes (10% of
all assembled clusters, 13% of spliced clusters). Among
these genes, 1,179 (46.0%) only have one EST sequence
(singletons), a higher proportion than among all predicted genes from EST clusters (32.8%). This indicates
that if the number of EST sequences in cluster is a good
indictor of expression level, genes with large introns had
lower expression level compared to all genes (46.0% vs
32.8% singletons).
Comparisons between the 2563 clusters (predicted
genes from EST clusters) and existing gene annotations
of the V. vinifera genome revealed that 1,812 clusters
matched to known annotations with 100% identity, with
1,137 matches that showing identical transcription start/
end sites and exon/intron structure between our predictions and known annotations. However, in 217 matches,
multiple EST-predicted genes (487 clusters) matched to
single annotated genes, while 188 clusters matched to
multiple annotated genes. The later case represented
one type of annotation error in V. vinifera genome, in
which a single gene supported by expression data was
incorrectly split into multiple annotated genes due to a
large intron between coding regions. Among the 188
clusters, 99 clusters correspond to multiple, consecutively annotated genes, suggesting that additional introns
are needed between annotated genes to correct the
annotations (Figure 1).
The function or gene ontology of the 2,563 genes,
suggested by their Arabidopsis and Populus homologs
and Pfam protein domain families, does not show bias
to any particular gene family, indicating that intron size
is not correlated with gene function. In the 2,563 genes,
2,697 introns between 3 kb to 100 kb (cf. 20 in Arabidopsis and 54 in Populus, respectively) were identified
(Figure 2). Among Arabidopsis, Populus and Vitis, genes
with conserved exon/intron structure, which means
identical exons/intron numbers, intron positions and
phase, were identified for detailed intron size comparisons. Because Vitis genome is still in an intensive annotation process, causing constant modifications of
annotation, UTR regions are not considered in this
study. Only 39 genes having conserved exon/intron
structure in Arabidopsis and Populus were identified

sequences (Chromosome 11, 13563038 to 13608929 bp), known annotation (GSVIVT00031451001 and GSVIVT00031453001) and gene expression

from the 2,563 genes and subjected to one-to-one comparison, which will be an underestimate because of the
uncertainties in Vitis annotation. This is also supported
by the fact that a lot of remaining genes showing an
extra or missing exon at 3’ or 5’ end in Vitis. Among
the 39 genes, 74 introns larger than 3 kb were identified.

The one-to-one comparison of intron sizes revealed that
the V. vinifera genome, four times larger than Arabidopsis overall, has experienced a 12-fold expansion of
intron size in these 39 genes. The genome size of
V. vinifera is nearly identical to Populus but experienced
a 5-fold expansion of intron size in these 39 genes
(Figure 3b). The increase in intron size is generally the
same in each individual gene (Figure 3a). In addition,
large introns in the 39 genes are predominantly 5’introns (over 40% intron 1 and intron 2).
Contents of large introns and TEs

introns identified in V. vinifera (> 3000 bp). Last bar on the right
represent all introns larger than 20 kb.

RepeatMasker screening and BLAST searches of the
2,697 large introns suggested that over 80% of the
intron contents were made up of repetitive elements.
The dominant types of repetitive elements are low complexity sequences, simple repeats, LTR retrotransposons
and LINEs. The number of Copia-type LTR retrotransposons is about 6.5 times that of the Gypsy-type, in
contrast to less Copia than Gypsy in the V. vinifera genome overall [17]. The distribution of similarities
between flanking LTR regions of the 591 complete LTR
retrotransposons is shown in Figure 4a. When compared
to the similarities between LTR regions identified in
V. vinifera genome overall (Figure 4b), LTR regions in
introns contain more highly similar pairs (about 30% of
the pairs with identity higher than 99%, |2, P < 0.01),
suggesting younger LTR retrotransposon insertions and
recent LTR retrotransposition activity in these introns.
Based on an estimate of substitution rate in LTR

regions, age estimates of LTR retrotransposons in
introns identified a burst of LTR retrotransposon activities: <10,000 ya (LTR similarity 100%) (Figure 4a). For
these young LTR-retrotransposons, Copia/Gypsy ratio is
5.8, close to the ratio for all LTR-retrotransposons in
large introns, indicating that recent LTR-retrotransposon proliferation is not biased towards either retrotransposon family.
In the 39 genes with identical exon/intron structure/
number in Arabidopsis and Populus, repetitive elements
comprised roughly 90% of the 74 intronic regions, in

which 10 complete LTR retrotransposons were identified.
Among the 74 introns, 1 intron contains only a LINE; 1
intron contains only LTR elements; 15 introns contain
LINEs and other repetitive elements; 15 introns contain
LTR elements and other repetitive elements; 5 introns contain LTR, LINEs and other repetitive elements; 34 introns
contain only other repetitive elements; and 3 introns do
not contain repetitive elements. According to a BLAST
search against the V. vinifera genome, ‘other repetitive elements’ were highly repetitive within V. vinifera and likely
represented un-classified or unnamed grapevine-specific

TEs. The three introns without any identified repetitive elements all contain LINE-like ORFs otherwise highly repetitive in the V. vinifera genome.
Characterizations of four selected introns (all containing LINE insertions) in Vitis species and domesticated
varieties revealed intron length variation across these
species and varieties (Table 1). None of the native Vitis
species have LINE insertions in introns. For the first
two introns, the size expansion was not found in any
Vitis species or variety, including Pinot Noir, possibly
suggesting that the LINE insertion is only present in the
specific individual or lineage that was used for genome
sequencing. The third intron contained identical LINE
insertions in both alleles of Pinot Noir (homozygous),
but was heterozygous in Dolcetto (Figure 5a). The
fourth intron had LINE insertions in all varieties of
domesticated grapevines, but was absent from introns of
wild species. Pinot Noir, as well as Cabernet Sauvignon,
Chardonnay and Riesling, are homozygous for this LINE
insertion, but Dolcetto is heterozygous with one insertion-negative and one insertion-positive allele. In addition, Sangiovese and Zinfandel contain an additional
LINE insertion in one allele. Together with a ‘Pinot
Noir’ allele, both varieties are heterozygous for the
intron length and carrying additional TE insertions not
apparent in Pinot Noir genomic sequences (Figure 5b).

Discussion

and genomic sequences in an automated workflow. This
approach has been rarely used before because sufficient
EST and genomic data are needed but available for only a
few plant species [19]. Domesticated grapevine ranks in
the top 25 taxa with the largest collections of ESTs and is
the fourth whole plant genome sequence available, making
it ideal for the EST mapping approach described here.
EST cluster number in this study is higher than the predicted gene number of V. vinifera [17], suggesting that
gene prediction based on EST consensus sequences covered a gene range comparable to genomic annotation. By
manually checking selected matches between EST consensus sequences and genomic regions, the rate of correct
mapping is 100%. Therefore, our workflow accurately
identified the corresponding genomic regions of EST consensus sequences, thus correct intron positions and sizes.
Annotation errors such as splitting single gene into
multiple ones as a result of unsually long introns, were
revealed by comparing ESTs to current annotations
(Figure 1). This was expected in two ways: correct prediction of genes in genomic sequences is very sensitive
to gene size because large size genes are more likely to
be predicted incorrectly due to fragmentation [20]; the
large introns present in these genes tend to cause prediction algorithms to split exons at both ends of large
introns into two separate genes. Incorporating ESTs into
gene prediction algorithms can clearly refine genome
annotation as suggested by Coyne et al. [21].

Transcriptome and intron identification

Genome-wide intron analysis has only been done in very
few plants [18]. In this study, we identified introns on a
whole genome scale by combining a large EST data set

decrease gene expression (energy cost hypothesis) [9].
Such hypothesis was supported by this study if we consider that the number of ESTs is a good indicator of
gene expression level. However, there is evidence against
this hypothesis in genes expressed in specific mammal
organs/tissues [22] and plant genomes [23].
In contrast, gene size and/or intron size seems to be
not related to gene function in this study. Among identified large genes, there is no particularly overrepresented gene family. There are still about 20% of
expanded intronic regions not accounted for by similarity searches or repeat masking, suggesting unique
sequences in introns are also evolving. Most of these
unique sequences may be evolving neutrally since there
may not be any selective constraint on them. However,
a few of them may contain very important regulatory
elements controlling gene expression patterns thus
under selective constraints.
Intron size expansion, TEs, grapevine evolution and
domestication

Comparisons of genome sizes and intron sizes between
Populus and Vitis revealed that intron sizes has increased
much more than genome size. Either grapevine specific
intron expansion or Populus specific intron contraction
can explain the intron size difference between the two
plants. The young LTR retrotransposons and unique presence of these TEs in domesticated grapevine both suggested that an intron size expansion is more likely to be
the case. Wendel et al. [18,24] proposed that intron size
dynamics may be decoupled with genome size evolution

by showing that intron size stayed static in multiple
rounds of genome expansion and contraction in cotton
(Gossypium). In contrast, we showed that Vitis intron size
has experienced a 5-fold expansion compared to Populus,
with either unknown fluctuation in genome size, or none
at all. Intron size dynamics in Vitis seem to be decoupled
from genome size evolution but our data suggested expansion instead of conservation of intron size.
A major force behind the intron size expansion in
grapevine is the proliferation of TEs, consistent with
previous observations [17]. Among various TEs, LTR
retrotransposons provides a proxy to estimate temporal
aspects of their activities due to their unique structure.
Several studies have estimated the age of LTR retrotransposon insertions in plant genomes such as rice, Medicago and maize [25-27]. Peaks of LTR retrotransposon
activity were identified including some that were very
recent and possibly related to plant domestication
[28,29]. Vitte and Panaud [30] suggested that plant LTR
retrotransposons evolved following a ‘burst and contraction’ model, which could explain the observed ‘peaks’ of
LTR retrotransposon activities in various plant genomes.
Different age estimates of Vitaceae family all placed its
origin at around 110 million years ago [31-33]. As a
result, LTR retrotransposon bursts observed in the
introns are much younger than the divergence of Vitales
(with a single family Vitaceae) from the common ancestor with rosids, suggesting that increased retrotransposon activity, as well as intron size expansion, is also
associated with unique evolutionary changes along the
grapevine lineage such as recent domestication.

Jiang and Goertzen BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/52

V. vinifera expanded introns contain significantly
more identical LTR pairs, suggesting that more young
LTR retrotransposons have been preserved in introns of
domesticated grapevine (Figure 4a). Here we suggest
that the most recent burst of LTR retrotransposons in
grapevine may be associated with domestication, either
as a result of artificial selection on the nearby genes or
genomic regions (local effect), or a non-adaptive byproduct of the domestication bottleneck and specific
reproduction modes in domesticated grapevines
(genome-wide effect). There is no enrichment of any
particular gene families in genes with TE invaded
introns. Threrfore it is very unlikely that all of the TEs
and introns, or nearby genes with diverse functions,
which are randomly distributed in genome, were
selected by humans in the domestication process.
Instead, LTR retrotransposons in the most recent burst
were more likely to be preserved in introns than previous bursts due to vegetative clonal propagation of
domesticated grapevine plants. Recent and variety-specific TE insertions in introns were discovered in our characterization of large introns from several commonly
cultivated grapevine varieties, suggesting that initial TE
invasion of introns spread with clonal propagations (see
results, Table 1) [34]. This may be explained by the following reasons: first, somaclonal propagation of plants
(or tissue culture) was suggested to promote or induce
LTR retrotransposon activity [35,36]. Domesticated
plants with vegetative propagation may generate more
LTR retrotransposons than wild species and non-clonal
cultivated plants. Second, plant genome expansions
caused by TE proliferation are counteracted by rapid
DNA removal as a result of recombination [37]. However, due to a domestication bottleneck and vegetative
propagation, the linkage disequilibrium (LD) in cultivated grapevines can be found at extremely long distance compared to wild species [38], suggesting that
recombination is repressed in large chunks of chromosomes. TEs, in particular LTR retrotransposons, in
domesticated grapevines, may not be removed as effectively as in wild species. Third, LTR retrotransposons, as
mutagenesis factors, may cause deleterious mutations if
inserted in genes. The mutants were selected against
and removed from populations very quickly in natural
environments [39]. In domesticated plants, intensive
human care produces an environment with relaxed
selective constraints, in which LTR retrotransposons
invaded genes were more likely to persist. Particularly,
vegetatively propagated cultivars such as domesticated
grapevine have a uniform genetic background as a result
of clonal reproduction to preserve desired traits. This
reproduction mode facilitated the spread and fixation of
introns with LTR retrotransposons (and other TEs) to
the entire clonal population or variety. This may be the

Page 7 of 9

major reason why excessive TEs were not observed
within genes of other plant genomes, including domesticated plants without clonal propagation such as rice
[40,41].

Conclusions
In this study, the intron size dynamics in domesticated
grapevine suggested that intron size expansion, mainly
caused by TE invasions, was associated with the plant’s
unique and recent evolutionary history. Intron size
expansion and burst of TE activity may all be related to
major evolutionary changes associated with domestication in grapevine. Investigation of intron size expansion
not only reveals a unique pattern of plant genome
dynamics, but also raises an interesting question: what is
the role of introns, a somewhat neglected portion of the
genome, in plant genome architecture, function and
evolution?
Methods
EST data collection, processing and assembly

All currently available V. vinifera Expressed Sequence
Tags (ESTs) were obtained from NCBI GenBank using
the PartiGene package [42]. Only V. vinifera ESTs were
included in this study, including over 140 varieties and
cultivars. Vector and poly-A sequences were trimmed by
the built-in functions of PartiGene. Cleaned EST
sequences were clustered using both CLOBB (the
default clustering method of PartiGene [43]) and TGICL
[44]. Both methods employ megaBLAST [45] searches
to produce clusters based on sequence similarity. For
both methods, a similarity cut-off of 99% and greater
than 100 bp overlap were employed. Both approaches
yielded similar numbers of EST clusters and the clustering results of TGICL were adopted for further analyses.
The clusters were assembled and the consensus
sequences for each cluster were predicted by PHRAP
[46]. The protein coding potential of the clusters were
predicted by ESTScan [47].
Identification of large genes and introns

EST consensus sequences were mapped to genomic
sequences of V. vinifera Pinot Noir [17] to identify
genomic locations and exon/intron structures of the
predicted genes. The mapping process was performed
with BLAT, by which ESTs or cDNAs were aligned to
genomic regions with near identity [48]. Most alignment
gaps in BLAT results represent intronic regions. Genes
with putative large introns were selected by two criteria:
first, the similarity score from BLAT search is higher
than 99%; second, the mapped genomic region (excluding introns) cover 95% of the EST consensus sequence.
These criteria ensure that predicted gene sequences
were mapped to the correct genomic positions. The

Jiang and Goertzen BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:52
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/52

process was automated with a Perl script for parsing
BLAT results, in which the gap sizes were calculated
and gap sequences (size range 3 kb~100 kb) and coding
regions associated with them were extracted. Extracted
gap regions were manually inspected for splicing signals.
Gaps with canonical donor and acceptor splice sites (5’end GT and 3’-end AG) were considered introns. The
entire process was also conducted on Arabidopsis and
Populus ESTs and genomes to characterize large introns
in those plant species.
Genes with putative large introns were submitted to
the following analysis: 1, the coding regions were predicted and translated into protein sequences by ESTScan
[47]; 2, predicted coding regions were compared to
Genoscope annotations by similarity searches and manual corrections; 3, BLAST searches were conducted
using the predicted coding regions as queries against an
EST database of Vitis species other than V. vinifera. Presence of high similarity hits in non-V. vinifera EST database suggested that the genes have EST data in at least
two closely related species, thus they are very likely truly
expressed; 4. BLAST searches using predicted protein
sequences were conducted against the Arabidopsis and
Populus genomic databases to identify the homologous
genes in the two plant genomes as an indicator of possible function. In addition, the predicted V. vinifera proteins were subjected to HMM search of protein
functional domains against Pfam database [49].
Analysis of large intron contents and selected individual
introns

Identified large introns (3 kb~100 kb-long) were subjected to the following analysis: 1, the intronic sequences
were screened by RepeatMasker [50] to identify repetitive elements using an Arabidopsis repetitive element
library; 2, the introns without any repetitive elements
detectable by RepeatMasker were subjected to BLAST
searches against the V. vinifera genome. Presence of
large number of high scoring hits (cut-off E-value =
0.001) suggests grapevine-specific repetitive elements. 3.
Full length LTR retrotransposons in intronic regions
were identified by LTR_FINDER [51]. The sequence
similarity between two LTR regions were used to estimate the age of LTR retrotransposon insertions using
the methods described by SanMiguel et al. [52], with the
JC substitution model used to correct for multiple substitutions in LTR regions [53]. All statistical analyses
were conducted with the statistical package R [54].
To characterize homologous introns in other Vitis species and varieties, intronic regions that met the following
criteria were chosen: 1, there is only one repetitive element
in the intron, suggesting a relatively recent expansion; 2,
the total intron size without repetitive elements does not
exceed 3 kb (to facilitate PCR amplifications). Primers

were designed for the flanking exon sequence as well as
conserved regions within the repetitive elements to allow
scoring either the presence or absence of the elements in a
given intron (primer sequences available upon request).
PCR amplifications of selected intronic regions were performed for one individual each of six wild grapevine species: V. rotundifolia, V. californica, V. girdiana, V. aestivalis
and V. labrusca, V. jacquemontii, and seven V. vinifera
cultivars: Cabernert Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Dolcetto,
Pinot Noir, Riesling, Sangiovese and Zinfandel. Alleles
with or without TE insertions were determined by the size
of the PCR product.
