Abstract
Background: The majority of filarial nematode species are host to Wolbachia bacterial
endosymbionts, although a few including Acanthocheilonema viteae, Onchocerca flexuosa and Setaria
equina have been shown to be free of infection. Comparisons of species with and without symbionts
can provide important information on the role of Wolbachia symbiosis in the biology of the
nematode hosts and the contribution of the bacteria to the development of disease. Previous
studies by electron microscopy and PCR have failed to detect intracellular bacterial infection in Loa
loa. Here we use molecular and immunohistological techniques to confirm this finding.
Methods: We have used a combination of PCR amplification of bacterial genes (16S ribosomal
DNA [rDNA], ftsZ and Wolbachia surface protein [WSP]) on samples of L. loa adults, third-stage
larvae (L3) and microfilariae (mf) and immunohistology on L. loa adults and mf derived from human
volunteers to determine the presence or absence of Wolbachia endosymbionts. Samples used in the
PCR analysis included 5 adult female worms, 4 adult male worms, 5 mf samples and 2 samples of
L3. The quality and purity of nematode DNA was tested by PCR amplification of nematode 5S
rDNA and with diagnostic primers from the target species and used to confirm the absence of
contamination from Onchocerca sp., Mansonella perstans, M. streptocerca and Wuchereria bancrofti.
Immunohistology was carried out by light and electron microscopy on L. loa adults and mf and
sections were probed with rabbit antibodies raised to recombinant Brugia malayi Wolbachia WSP.
Samples from nematodes known to be infected with Wolbachia (O. volvulus, O. ochengi, Litomosoides
sigmodontis and B. malayi) were used as positive controls and A. viteae as a negative control.
Results: Single PCR analysis using primer sets for the bacterial genes 16S rDNA, ftsZ, and WSP
were negative for all DNA samples from L. loa. Positive PCR reactions were obtained from DNA
samples derived from species known to be infected with Wolbachia, which confirmed the suitability
of the primers and PCR conditions. The quality and purity of nematode DNA samples was verified
by PCR amplification of 5S rDNA and with nematode diagnostic primers. Additional analysis by

'long PCR' failed to produce any further evidence for Wolbachia symbiosis. Immunohistology of L.
loa adults and mf confirmed the results of the PCR with no evidence for Wolbachia symbiosis.
Conclusion: DNA analysis and immunohistology provided no evidence for Wolbachia symbiosis in
L. loa.

Background
The majority of filarial nematodes are infected with Wolbachia endosymbionts, including the major pathogenic
species in humans, Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and
Onchocerca volvulus [1,2]. Research on the symbiosis of
Wolbachia bacteria and filarial nematodes has highlighted
the contribution of bacteria to inflammatory disease
pathogenesis and the use of antibiotic therapy as a novel
method of treatment [3–5]. A few filarial nematode species, including Acanthocheilonema viteae, Onchocerca flexuosa and Setaria equina, are free of Wolbachia infection [6–
9]. Studies using these species have helped define the contribution of Wolbachia to inflammatory pathogenesis [10–
13] and the effects of antibiotic depletion on development and fertility [14,15]. Determining the extent of Wolbachia infection in filarial nematodes could also shed light
on the evolutionary history of the symbiosis and give
insight into the nature of the mutualistic association.
The association of Wolbachia with severe inflammatory
reactions post-treatment of B. malayi and O. volvulus with
ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine [10,16,17] prompted
us to examine whether L. loa was infected with Wolbachia
and thus could potentially contribute to the rare but serious severe adverse neurological events (SAE) following
ivermectin treatment [18]. Previous electron microscopy
studies have failed to find intracellular bacteria in L. loa
microfilariae [6,19] and adults [20,21] and PCR analysis
of microfilariae from two patients also failed to detect
Wolbachia [22]. Here we have used molecular and immunohistochemical analysis to confirm this finding in a
larger number of samples derived from different endemic
areas.

Methods
Parasites
Nematode samples from infected humans and animals
were obtained with the approval of the ethics committees
and regulatory authorities of all institutions and countries
involved in this study.
Loa loa
Microfilariae
Microfilariae samples were obtained from venous blood
samples from individuals diagnosed with Loa loa from
Cameroon (3), Gabon (2) and Benin (1). Whole blood
samples were either frozen directly or filtered to collect

microfilariae, which were either frozen, fixed in 80% ethanol or used directly for the extraction of DNA.
Third-stage larvae (L3)
L3 larvae were collected from Chrysops fed on human volunteers from Cameroon. Engorged flies were maintained
in insectaries for 12 days at 23–28°C and 77–80%
humidity. Heads of infected flies were dissected in RPMI
medium and the recovered L3s washed three times. Larvae
were either frozen in liquid N2 or used to inoculate a drill,
Mandrillus leucophaeus, for the recovery of adult worms.
Adult worms
Two adult female worms were obtained following surgical
removal from infected individuals in Gabon and fixed in
80% ethanol. Adult worms (three female and four male
worms) were recovered from subcutaneous tissues of a
two-year old drill born in captivity, seven months after
subcutaneous inoculation with 200 L3 in the inguinal
region and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate
buffered saline.
PCR
PCR analyses were conducted in two separate laboratories, in the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the
Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, and are therefore described for each laboratory.
Liverpool
DNA was extracted from the parasites by the phenol/chloroform method, as follows. Worms were placed in 500 µl
of TEN (20 mM Tris pH 7.5; 50 mM EDTA; 100 mM NaCl)
with 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K and 1 µl β-mercaptoethanol, and incubated in a 55°C water bath until
the parasites were digested. Phenol: chloroform: isoamyl
alcohol (25:24:1, Sigma, UK) was added to the lysate, gently mixed, and after a 2 minute centrifugation, the aqueous phase was removed to a clean tube. The organic phase
was re-extracted with 200 µl TEN and the aqueous phases
combined. To precipitate the DNA, 1.2 ml of room temperature ethanol was added and the DNA pelleted by centrifugation, followed by washing with ice cold 70%
ethanol, centrifugation, and drying of the pellet; the pellet
was then resuspended in 200 µl of sterile distilled water.
DNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260
nm (Adult female, 226, 157 µg/ml; microfilariae 73, 102
µg/ml; L3, 2 µg/ml). By PCR, L. loa samples were confirmed to be positive for L. loa DNA [23] and negative for

Onchocerca species [24], M. perstans and M. streptocerca
[25] and Wuchereria bancrofti [26].
16s rDNA
For amplification of bacterial 16s rDNA, 5 µl of DNA was
amplified with the eubacterial primers 27f (5'-GAG AGT
TTG ATC CTG GCT CAG-3') and 1495r (5'-CTA CGG CTA
CCT TGT TAC GA-3') as previously described [10].
ftsZ
To increase the sensitivity of the reaction [27], ftsZ primers (ftsZ UNIF 5'-GG [CT] AA [AG] GGT GC [AG] GCA
GAA GA-3' and ftsZ UNIFR 5'-ATC [AG]AT [AG]CC AGT
TGC AAG-3') [28] were used with a proof-reading DNA
polymerase enzyme (Bio-X-Act, Bioline, U.K.). One
microlitre of DNA was amplified with 0.4 µM of each
primer, 1 X buffer, 350 µM dNTPs, 2.5 U DNA polymerase
and between 1.5 mM and 2.5 mM MgCl2. After an initial
denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes, samples were heated
at 94°C for 10 seconds, 65°C for 30 seconds, and 68°C
for 1.5 mins for a total of ten cycles, after which the samples were amplified for an additional 20 cycles with an
annealing temperature of 55°C and an extension time of
68°C for 1.5 mins plus an extra 20 seconds each cycle.
WSP
WSP primers were based on the sequence of Brugia malayi
Wolbachia WSP (WSP-FILF 5'-CGC TTG CAG TAC AAT
AGT GAG-3' and WSP-FILR 5'-GCT TCT GCA CCA ATA
GTG CT-3'). One microlitre of adult or 5 µl of microfilarial/L3 DNA was amplified with 0.2 µM of each primer, 1X
buffer that contained 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM of each
dNTP, 2.5 U of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase and water to
50 µl. Following activation of the DNA polymerase at
95°C for 15 minutes, the mixes were heated at 94°C for
45 seconds, 60°C for 45 seconds with a decrease of 1°C
per cycle for 5 cycles, then at 55°C for 35 cycles, with an
extension step at 72°C for 90 seconds and a final extension step of 8 minutes.

PCR products were visualised on an agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide.
Hamburg
Individual L. loa worms (4 male, 3 female) or microfilariae were homogenised in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8; 20 mM EDTA; 2% SDS), then incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C with 0.1 volume of 10 mg/ml Proteinase K
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA was extracted twice
in phenol:chloroform, ethanol precipitated, and the pellet
was resuspended in 200 µl water. The DNA concentration
as determined by absorbance at 260 nm had a range of
15–145 µg/ml with an average of 53 µg/ml. PCR of the
nematode 5S rDNA was performed as previously
described [25] to confirm the quality of the DNA.

http://www.filariajournal.com/content/2/1/9

The following primer sets and annealing temperatures
were used to amplify the eubacterial 16S rDNA and ftsZ
sequences: 16S rDNA forward: AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG
CTC AG, reverse: AAG AGG TGA TCC AGC C [14]; ftsZ
forward: CTT GGT GCT GGT GCT TTG CCT, reverse: TAC
CAA TCA TTG CTT TAC CCA. PCR was performed on 2 µl
of genomic DNA in a 50 µl reaction in 1X Hotstar Taq®
buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.2 µM dNTPs, and 20 µM of each primer. The cycle conditions were an initial step of 95°C for 15 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 2
minutes, 72°C for 1 minute, and a final extension at 72°C
for 10 minutes. Products were separated on agarose gels in
1X TBE and visualised with ethidium bromide. FtsZ primers were also used with the Elongase® taq polymerase mix
(Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom) with 2 mM Mg2+ as
per the manufacturer's protocol.
Immunohistology
Antisera to recombinant Brugia malayi Wolbachia WSP
A rabbit was immunised and boosted with purified
recombinant Brugia malayi Wolbachia WSP protein and
the serum tested in a Western blot. A single band of 28
kDa was detected in B. malayi protein extract, whereas
there was no recognition of a Wolbachia-free A. viteae
extract or when pre-immunisation serum was used (not
shown). Likewise, when used in immunohistology, this
antibody specifically labelled Wolbachia from 14 species
of filarial nematodes tested but did not cross react with
any nematode tissue (D. W. Büttner, pers. comm.; our
unpublished observation).
Immuno-electron microscopy
L. loa microfilariae were fixed and embedded for immunoelectron microscopy as described previously [29]. Sections cut at 90 nm and mounted on nickle grids were
blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS with
0.01% Tween 20 and then reacted with rabbit anti-WSP
serum (dilutions of 1 in 20 to 1 in 100), washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit colloidal gold conjugate (20
nm diameter, British Biocell, UK). Sections were counterstained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate solution and
examined on a Phillips CM10 transmission electron
microscope.
Light immunohistology
L. loa adult worms fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline were embedded in paraffin. Sections
were probed with rabbit anti-WSP serum (1:250) and visualised using the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method according to the manufacturer's
recommendations (Dako Diagnostika, Hamburg, Germany). Anti-rabbit mouse immunoglobulin was used as a
secondary antibody (clone MR12/53, Dako Diagnostika)
and Fast Red TR salt (Sigma) as the chromogen with

haematoxylin (Merck) as the counterstain. Brugia malayi
adult female worms were used as a positive control.

Results
PCR
To determine the presence of Wolbachia in L. loa at the
molecular level, PCR was performed on genomic DNA
with primers for the eubacterial 16S rDNA, ftsZ and WSP
sequences. No PCR product was obtained with any of the
primer sets with L. loa and A. viteae DNA (Figure 1),
although all DNA samples produced a nematode 5S rDNA
signal, indicating that there was DNA at sufficient concentration for detection in one round of PCR. The 16S rDNA,
ftsZ and WSP primers were functional as all primer sets
produced a visible product at the expected molecular
weight in the positive controls (Figure 1). Additional anal-

ysis by 'long PCR', which has been reported to increase the
sensitivity of the identification of Wolbachia in arthropods
[27], was used; however, neither the Elongase® polymerase mix nor the Bio-X-Act polymerase used with the ftsZ
primer sets produced a signal from L. loa of the expected
molecular weight (Figure 1).
Immunohistology
No labelling of WSP was detected in sections of L. loa
microfilariae by immuno-electron microscopy. Light
immunohistology of L. loa adult worms showed no labelling of male or female worms (Figure 2). Labelling of positive controls (B. malayi) confirmed the specificity of the
antisera to Wolbachia (Figure 2).

Discussion
Here we present data of molecular and immunohistological analyses that failed to provide evidence for Wolbachia
symbiosis in L. loa. This confirms previous findings on L.
loa by electron microscopy and PCR [6,19–22] and
extends these observations to a larger sample of adult
worms, infective larvae and isolates of microfilariae from
three different endemic areas.
The release of Wolbachia into the blood following antifilarial chemotherapy has been shown to be associated
with severe systemic inflammatory reactions in individuals infected with O. volvulus or B. malayi [16,17]. One of
the objectives of this study was to determine whether Wolbachia might contribute to the rare but severe neurological
adverse events following ivermectin treatment of L. loa
[18]. We conclude that the neurological consequences of
SAE following ivermectin treatment of individuals with L.
loa are not associated with Wolbachia. In people coinfected with L. loa and O. volvulus or W. bancrofti, adverse
events induced by Wolbachia derived from the latter two
species may nevertheless contribute to post-treatment
reactions. Double blind placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the effect of doxycycline depletion of Wolbachia on
the development of post-treatment reactions to filarial
chemotherapy are currently underway in individuals
infected with B. malayi, W. bancrofti, O. volvulus, and coinfection with O. volvulus and L. loa. In two patients with
L. loa treated with doxycycline for six weeks (200 mg/day),
microfilaraemia was still detected at 120 days of follow up
[22].

http://www.filariajournal.com/content/2/1/9

populations or individual nematodes exist without infection. Similarly with species shown to be aposymbiotic,
populations may exist that contain symbionts, particularly if the absence of bacteria is due to a secondary loss of
Wolbachia. In this regard it would be worthwhile to analyse samples of monkey strains of L. loa, which may be
ancestrally 'primitive' compared to the strain parasitising
humans. Additional studies on the extent of Wolbachia
symbiosis in infected species and the infection status of
the human filariae M. perstans and M. streptocera are
important areas for future research.

Conclusions
We conclude that this study provides no evidence for Wolbachia symbiosis in L. loa. It is therefore highly improbable that Wolbachia contributes to the neurological
consequences of SAE following ivermectin treatment in
individuals with infections of L. loa unaccompanied by
other filarial species.

Studies on species of filarial nematodes infected with Wolbachia suggest that the symbiosis exists throughout all
samples of populations and individual parasites [1,2]. The
ubiquity of infection, congruence with host phylogeny
and deleterious effects of antibiotic clearance on embryogenesis, development and viability suggest a mutualistic
dependency [1,2]. It is clear, however, that some species of
filariae, including L. loa, can cause widespread infection
without the need for bacterial symbionts. Although further studies are needed it has been suggested that the
absence of Wolbachia in A. viteae and Setaria sp. is a consequence of their divergence from the lineage prior to the
acquisition of Wolbachia infection. Conversely, the
absence of Wolbachia from O. flexuosa and L. loa is more
likely to be due to the loss of bacterial symbionts [2]. Further analysis incorporating the results of the present study
could provide additional insights into the evolutionary
biology of the filarial nematode-Wolbachia symbiosis.
Although data collected so far support the conclusion that
filarial nematode species with evidence of symbiosis are
ubiquitously infected, sampling of these species is inevitably limited and we cannot rule out the possibility that
