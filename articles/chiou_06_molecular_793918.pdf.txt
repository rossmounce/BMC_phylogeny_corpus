Abstract
Background: Meningococcal disease is infrequently found in Taiwan, a country with 23 million people. Between 1996
and 2002, 17 to 81 clinical cases of the disease were reported annually. Reported cases dramatically increased in 2001–
2002. Our record shows that only serogroup B and W135 meningococci have been isolated from patients with
meningococcal disease until 2000. However, serogroup A, C and Y meningococci were detected for the first time in 2001
and continued to cause disease through 2002. Most of serogroup Y meningococcus infections localized in Central Taiwan
in 2001, indicating that a small-scale outbreak of meningococcal disease had occurred. The occurrence of a
meningococcal disease outbreak and the emergence of new meningococcal strains are of public health concern.
Methods: Neisseria meningitidis isolates from patients with meningococcal disease from 1996 to 2002 were collected and
characterized by serogrouping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The
genetic relatedness and clonal relationship between the isolates were analyzed by using the PFGE patterns and the allelic
profiles of the sequence types (STs).
Results: Serogroups A, B, C, W135, Y, and non-serogroupable Neisseria meningitidis were, respectively, responsible for
2%, 50%, 2%, 35%, 9%, and 2% of 158 culture-confirmed cases of meningococcal disease in 1996–2002. Among 100 N.
meningitidis isolates available for PFGE and MLST analyses, 51 different PFGE patterns and 30 STs were identified with
discriminatory indices of 0.95 and 0.87, respectively. Of the 30 STs, 21 were newly identified and of which 19 were found
in serogroup B isolates. A total of 40 PFGE patterns were identified in 52 serogroup B isolates with the patterns
distributed over several distinct clusters. In contrast, the isolates within each of the serogroups A, C, W135, and Y shared
high levels of PFGE pattern similarity. Analysis of the allelic profile of the 30 STs suggested the serogroup B isolates be
assigned into 5 clonally related groups/ clonal complexes and 7 unique clones. The ST-41/44 complex/Lineage 3, and the
ST-3439 and ST-3200 groups represented 79% of the serogroup B meningococci. In contrast, isolates within serogroups
A, serogroup W135 (and C), and serogroup Y, respectively, simply belonged to ST-7, ST-11, and ST-23 clones.
Conclusion: Our data suggested that serogroup B isolates were derived from several distinct lineages, most of which
could either be indigenous or were introduced into Taiwan a long time ago. The serogroup A, W135 (and C), and Y
isolates, respectively, belonged to the ST-7, ST-11, and ST-23, and the represented clones that are currently the major
circulating clones in the world and are introduced into Taiwan more recently. The emergence of serogroup A, C and Y
strains contributed partly to the increase in cases of meningococcal disease in 2001–2002.

Background
Neisseria meningitidis is one of the major causative agents
of bacterial meningitis and septicemia in children and
young adults, with an estimated 500,000 cases and
50,000 deaths per year worldwide [1]. This organism is
subdivided into 13 major serogroups based on the chemical and serological properties of the capsular polysaccharide [2]. Serogroups A, B, and C of this species have
historically been the main cause of most endemics and
epidemics of meningococcal disease [1]. However, serogroups W135 and Y meningococci have become more significant recently. Serogroup W135 meningococcus was
responsible for the Hajj-associated meningococcal disease
outbreak in 2000 and subsequent epidemics in Africa [35]. The incidence of serogroup Y meningococcal disease
has also increased since the 1990s in North America [6-8].
Between 1996 and 2002, 17 to 81 clinical cases of meningococcal disease were reported annually in Taiwan, a
country with 23 million people. Of 292 reported clinical
cases, 158 were confirmed by bacterial culture. Our record
shows that only serogroup B and W135 meningococci
have been isolated from patients with meningococcal disease until 2000. However, serogroup A, C and Y meningococci were detected for the first time in 2001 and
continued to cause disease through 2002. A few cases of
the disease were caused by serogroup Y meningococcus,
with most of infections localized in Central Taiwan in
2001, suggesting that a small-scale outbreak of meningococcal disease had occurred. The occurrence of a meningococcal disease outbreak and the emergence of new
meningococcal strains are of public health concern.
Analyses of N. meningitidis isolates using molecular subtyping methods are useful for epidemiological studies.
Among the subtyping techniques, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
currently are the most widely adopted epidemiological
tools for cluster designation, disease outbreak investigation, and tracking the global spread of meningococcal
clones [9-11]. In this study, N. meningitidis isolates collected from patients in 1996–2002 were characterized
using PFGE and MLST methods. The genotyping results
are used to describe the molecular epidemiology of the
recent meningococcal disease in Taiwan and infer the evolutionary origins of the causative agents.

Methods
Bacterial strains
A total of 158 N. meningitidis isolates were cultured from
blood and cerebrospinal fluid specimens collected from
patients with meningococcal disease in hospitals throughout Taiwan from 1996 to 2002. Bacterial isolates were
sent to the four district laboratories of the Center for Disease Control, Taiwan, with reporting forms that contained

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/25

patient information (name, sex, date of birth, residency,
day of onset, and symptoms). Serogroup was determined
at the four district laboratories using the slide agglutination method with antisera from Murex Biotech Ltd., Dartford, England [12]. There were 100 isolates available for
genetic characterization. The PFGE size reference strain,
N. meningitidis M413, was kindly provided by Dr. T. Popovic of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The bacterial isolates were stored
in 15% glycerol at -75°C until use.
PFGE
The PFGE procedures described by Popovic et al. were
applied in this study [9]. NheI-treated genomic DNA fragments of N. meningitidis M413 were used as the size reference markers. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained
with 1 mg/L ethidium bromide and the PFGE profile
recorded using a digital camera system (Kodak Electrophoresis Documentation and Analysis System 290) with
1792 × 1200 pixels.
MLST
The primers for PCR amplification and sequencing of the
housekeeping genes abcZ (putative ABC transporter), adk
(adenylate kinase), aroE (shikimate dehydrogenase),
fumC (fumarate hydratase), gdh (glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase), pdhC (pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit),
pgm (phosphoglucomutase) were synthesized in Mission
Biotech Corp. Taipei, Taiwan, according to the primer
sequences of the Neisseria MLST database website [13]
Bacterial DNA was extracted using a commercial kit (Viogene Blood & Tissue Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep
System, Taipei, Taiwan). The target DNA was amplified by
PCR following the reaction conditions supplied at the
above website. PCR amplified DNA was sent to Mission
Biotech Corp. for nucleotide sequence determination.
Sequence segments of the 7 genes (abcZ, 433 bp; adk, 465
bp; aroE, 490 pb; fumC, 465 bp; gdh, 501 bp; pdhC, 480
bp; pgm, 450 bp) from each isolate were compared with
the previously observed allelic sequences in the Neisseria
MLST database for identification of ST and the relationships of the STs with the defined clonal complex are automatically assigned. Sequences of new alleles were sent to
the curator of the Neisseria MLST database for new allele
and ST code assignment.
Data analysis
The digital PFGE image was analyzed using BioNumerics
software (Applied Maths, Maths, Kortrijik, Belgium). A
PFGE pattern with one or more DNA bands different from
the others was taken as a unique PFGE pattern and a new
PFGE code was assigned. The discriminatory power of the
two subtyping methods was evaluated by a discriminatory
index as calculated by Hunter [14]. A dendrogram of
PFGE patterns was constructed using the unweighted pair

group with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA) method and
the Dice similarity coefficient. Clonal relationships
between the STs were constructed using the Minimum
Spanning Tree (MST) method of the BioNumerics cluster
analysis module. The MST method incorporated the
BURST algorithm as a set of priority rules for cluster analysis [15].

Results
During the period 1996 to 2002, 17 to 81 clinical cases of
meningococcal disease were reported annually from hospitals to the Center of Disease Control, Taiwan. Each year
between 11 and 46 cases were confirmed by the bacterial
culturing method (Table 1). Serogroup B and W135
meningococci ranked as the first and second most common serogroups, responsible for 50% and 35% of the
confirmed cases, respectively (Table 1). Only serogroups B
and W135 meningococci were detected during 1996–
2000. Serogroup A, C, and Y meningococci emerged for
the first time in 2001 and continued to cause disease
throughout 2002. Serogroup Y meningococcus caused
more cases of meningococcal disease than serogroup A
and C combined. Most of these cases were in Central Taiwan, suggesting that a small-scale outbreak of serogroup Y
meningococcal disease apparently occurred at that time.
The cases caused by the emerging serogroup A, C and Y
strains as well as the increased cases caused by serogroup
W135 were attributed to the dramatic increase in cases of
meningococcal disease in 2001. Serogroup B strains also
contributed to the increase of meningococcal disease in
2002.
Of the 158 N. meningitidis isolates, 100 were available for
PFGE and MLST analyses. The analyses identified 51 different PFGE patterns and 30 STs. The indices of discriminatory power for PFGE and MLST were 0.95 and 0.87,
respectively. Although the PFGE method exhibited higher

discriminatory power than MLST, isolates with identical
PFGE patterns (e.g. NMEN06.0010) were further differentiated into three STs (Figure 1).
The genetic relatedness between the isolates was evaluated
by cluster analysis with the PFGE patterns. As shown in
the dendrogram (Figure 1), serogroup B isolates exhibited
a high level of genetic diversity. A total of 40 PFGE patterns were identified in the 52 serogroup B isolates, with
the patterns distributed over several distinct clusters. Serogroup B isolates between clusters shared a low level of
PFGE pattern similarity, with no single genotype predominated among the isolates. This suggested that the isolates
were derived from multiple clonal origins and no single
major circulating strain existed. In contrast, the isolates
within each of the serogroups A, C, W135, and Y shared
high levels of PFGE pattern similarity and PFGE patterns
within each of the serogroups tightly clustered (Figure 1).
One of the four PFGE patterns (NMEN06.0056) was predominant in serogroup W135 isolates. Of the 31 serogroup W135 isolates typed, 19 were of NMEN06.0056
genotype. Serogroup C clustered tightly with serogroup
W135 and shared a 69% pattern similarity.
Of the 30 STs, 21 belonged to new ST types, which had not
been identified before (Figure 1). Of the 21 new identified
ST types, 19 were found in serogroup B isolates. To evaluate the clonal relationships between the isolates, allelic
profiles of the 30 STs were analyzed by the MST method.
In addition, the STs were deposited into the Neisseria
MLST database and the relationships with defined clonal
complexes were automatically assigned by software in the
database. In the MST analysis, STs matching at 4 or more
loci were regarded as clonally related. The analysis established the relationship between STs in the clonally related
groups, including ST-11 group (ST-11 and ST-3016), ST41 group (ST-41, ST-154, ST-437, ST3466 and ST-3468),

ST-3200 group (ST-3200, ST-3441, ST3469, ST3470, ST3503 and ST-4836), and ST-3439 group (ST-1393, ST3192, ST-3442, ST3439 and ST3440) (Figure 2).
Searches of the Neisseria MLST database found that some
STs belonged to defined clonal complexes, including the
ST-7 (ST-5 complex/Subgroup III), ST-11 group (ST-11
complex/ET-37 complex), ST-23 (ST-23 complex/Cluster
A3), ST-41 group (ST-41/44 complex/Lineage 3), ST-162
(ST-162 complex), and ST-3465 (ST-32 complex/ET-5
complex) (Figure 1).
In this study, the clonality of the N. meningitidis isolates
was defined on the basis of ST types. Clonal relationships
inferred by the STs were also related to the clustering relationships constructed using the PFGE patterns. Isolates
within a clonally related group or clonal complex shared
higher levels of PFGE pattern similarity than those in
other groups (Figure 1). The serogroup B isolates were
assigned to 5 clonally related groups and clonal complexes and 7 unique clones. The ST-41/44 complex/Lineage 3, and the ST-3439 and ST-3200 groups represented
79% of the serogroup B meningococci. The hypervirulent
ST-41/44 complex/Lineage 3 consisted of five different
STs and the isolates with different STs also shared a lower
PFGE pattern similarity. High genetic divergence was also
observed in the ST-3439 and ST-3200 groups, containing
5 and 6 STs, respectively. Serogroup A, serogroup W135
(and C), and serogroup Y isolates were characterized as
ST-7, ST-11, and ST-23, respectively. They belonged to the
hypervirulent ST-5 complex/Subgroup III, the hypervirulent ST-11 complex/ET-37 complex, and the ST-23 complex/Cluster A3, respectively.

Discussion
Meningococcal disease is a notifiable disease in Taiwan.
Physicians and hospital authorities have obligation to
report any suspected and confirmed case within 24 hours
to local public health department. The disease is infrequently reported in Taiwan. The annual incidence of
meningococcal disease was 0.94 cases per 100,000 population in 1953 and then declined to below 0.001 between
1980 and 1987 [16]. In 2001, reported cases dramatically
increased with an annual incidence rate of 0.2 cases per
100,000 population. The clinical isolates were limited to
serogroups B and W135 in 1996–2000. Thus, the emergence of serogroup A, C, and Y strains in 2001 is of great
concern. Our genotyping data suggested that the serogroup A, C, Y and W135 strains originated from hypervirulent lineages that had been circulating in various parts of
the world for decades [10,11,17-20]. Even though serogroup W135 meningococci have been detected in Taiwan
before 1996, the high level of genetic relatedness between
the strains in each of the serogroups A, C, W135, and Y
suggested that the original clones have been recently

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/25

introduced into Taiwan. In contrast, most serogroup B
clones could be indigenous or were introduced a long
time ago. The high level of genetic diversity among the
serogroup B isolates suggested that the meningococci have
multiple clonal origins and that strains within a clonally
related group are derived from genetic variation during
clonal expansion.
The two serogroup A strains were characterized as ST-7,
which belong to the hypervirulent ST-5 complex/Subgroup III. ST-5 and ST-7 belonged to the ST-5 complex/
Subgroup III and differed only at the pgm locus (allele
pgm3 is characteristic for ST-5 while allele pgm19 is for ST7) [10]. ST-5 strains have been responsible for serious outbreaks in Africa since 1988; however, ST-7 strains are
replacing ST-5 strains in Africa since their emergence in
1995 [10]. ST-7 strains are expected to cause the next epidemic wave of serogroup A meningococcal disease in
Africa [10,20].
The serogroup W135 meningococcus belonging to ST-11
was responsible for a global outbreak of meningococcal
disease in the year 2000 that was related to the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia [5,21]. The W135 strain was
derived from clonal expansion within the ST-11 complex/
ET-37 complex and not from a new clone [11]. Since
2000, serogroup W135 meningococci of ST-11 have been
isolated in many African countries, including Algeria,
Cameroon, Chad, Senegal, Niger, Central African Republic, and Burkina Faso during the large outbreak of 2001–2
[4,20,22]. Serogroup W135 strains in Taiwan belonged to
ST-11; however, they were apparently introduced before
the Hajj pilgrimage outbreak. The study by Yazdankhah et
al., using a variable-number tandem repeat typing
method, also showed that a serogroup W135 isolate from
Taiwan in 2000 was genetically distinct from the Hajjrelated W135 strain in 2000 [23].
Although serogroup Y strains have not been associated
with large epidemics, cases of meningococcal disease
caused by this serogroup have been increasing in the USA
and Canada since the 1990s [6-8]. Our data indicated that
clinical serogroup Y strains recently emerged in Taiwan
were derived from a ST-23 clone. ST-23 is also a prevalent
type found in Japan [18]. ST-23 strains were the cause of a
small-scale outbreak of meningococcal disease in Central
Taiwan in 2001. In an unpublished carriage study conducted in 2001, we detected meningococci in 51 (2.56%)
of 1988 nasopharyngeal swabs sampled from men of 19–
21 years old. Of the isolates, 25 (49%) were serogroup B,
7 (14%) were serogroup W135, 13 (25%) were serogroup
Y, and 6 (12%) were non-serogroupable. All the serogroup W135 isolates were characterized as ST-11, and 11
of the 13 serogroup Y isolates were as ST-23. This indicated that, like the ST-11 strains, the ST-23 strains have

widely distributed in Taiwan. The new emerged ST-23
strains may have adapted to this environment and then
become major circulating strains for meningococcal infection in Taiwan.
The MLST analysis revealed that most serogroup B strains
had new STs unique in Taiwan, implying that they could
have originated from indigenous clones. In this study we
identified three major clonal complex or clonally related
groups, namely the ST-41/44 complex/Lineage 3, ST-3200
group and ST-3439 group, which represented 79% of all
serogroup B isolates. The ST-3200 and ST-3439 groups
probably evolved from indigenous clones. ST-1393, the
sole ST of the ST-3439 group that had been identified
prior to the study (as shown in Figure 2), was also identified for the first time in a strain from Taiwan. In contrast,
the strains within the hypervirulent ST-41/44 complex/
Lineage 3 most likely were derived from an imported
clone. This is an example of an imported clone that has
successfully adapted to a new environment and then
become a major circulating causative agent. The ST-11 and
ST-23 strains have also successfully adapted within the
Taiwanese population and continue to cause disease
throughout 2003–2004.

Conclusion
Serogroup B isolates collected in 1996–2002 were derived
from multiple clonal lineages. Since most of the isolates
were characterized as new STs unique to Taiwan, they
should derive from indigenous clones. Although three
major clonal lineages were defined by phylogenetic analysis of the allelic profiles of the STs, no a predominant
PFGE:ST genotype emerged at a particular time. Serogroup
B strains caused only sporadic infections and were never
responsible for any apparent disease outbreak in Taiwan.
The emergence of serogroup A, C and Y strains contributed partly to the dramatic increase in cases of meningococcal disease in 2001–2002. In our record, serogroup A,
C and Y strains emerged for the first time in 2001. Serogroup Y strains had apparently caused a small meningococcal disease outbreak in central Taiwan in 2001. Strains
of serogroups A, C and Y belonged to three worldwide epidemic clones within the ST-5 complex/Subgroup III, ST11 complex/ET-37 complex, and ST-23 complex/Cluster
A3. Introduction of hypervirulent N. meningitidis strains
into Taiwan increases the burden of the disease in the
country since new strains may adapt to the environment
similar to the serogroup W135 strains, which have
become major circulating strains in Taiwan.
