Abstract
Background: The Type I interferons (IFN) have major roles in the innate immune response to
viruses, a function that is believed to have led to expansion in the number and complexity of their
genes, although these genes have remained confined to single chromosomal region in all mammals
so far examined. IFNB and IFNE define the limits of the locus, with all other Type I IFN genes except
IFNK distributed between these boundaries, strongly suggesting that the locus has broadened as
IFN genes duplicated and then evolved into a series of distinct families.
Results: The Type I IFN locus in Bos taurus has undergone significant rearrangement and expansion
compared to mouse and human, however, with the constituent genes separated into two sub-loci
separated by >700 kb. The IFNW family is greatly expanded, comprising 24 potentially functional
genes and at least 8 pseudogenes. The IFNB (n = 6), represented in human and mouse by one copy,
are also present as multiple copies in Bos taurus. The IFNT, which encode a non-virally inducible,
ruminant-specific IFN secreted by the pre-implantation conceptus, are represented by three genes
and two pseudogenes. The latter have sequences intermediate between IFNT and IFNW. A new
Type I IFN family (IFNX) of four members, one of which is a pseudogene, appears to have diverged
from the IFNA lineage at least 83 million years ago, but is absent in all other sequenced genomes
with the possible exception of the horse, a non-ruminant herbivore.
Conclusion: In summary, we have provided the first comprehensive annotation of the Type I IFN
locus in Bos taurus, thereby providing an insight into the functional evolution of the Type I IFN in
ruminants. The diversity and global spread of the ruminant species may have required an expansion
of the Type I IFN locus and its constituent genes to provide broad anti-viral protection required
for foraging and foregut fermentation.

Background
Viruses are constantly evolving to find more effective
means to survive and multiply in their host species [1-3].
The immune defense system, in turn, exists in a perpetual
state of co-evolution with the pathogens to limit infec-

tious disease, a circumstance often likened to an "arms
race." The primary defense mechanism against viruses in
vertebrates is Type I IFN (interferon) of the innate
immune system [4]. It can reasonably be argued that complex organisms like mammals can only survive as long as

immune defenses can adjust to the strategies of invading
pathogens. Accordingly, a rapidly evolving, adaptable IFN
system is essential to mammals if they are to endure viral
infections. Type I IFN are also pleiotropic cytokines, with
significant roles in modulating adaptive immunity, cell
proliferation and cell death, and numerous other processes vital to mammalian health and survival [1]. Most
likely as a response to these challenges, Type I IFN demonstrate a complex evolutionary history that has resulted
in the divergence of at least eight distinct subfamilies: IFNkappa (IFNK), IFN-beta (IFNB), IFN-epsilon (IFNE), IFNdelta (IFND), IFN-zeta (IFNZ), IFN-alpha (IFNA), IFNomega (IFNW), and IFN-tau (IFNT) [5].
Mammalian Type I IFN probably emerged during tetrapod evolution from an older cytokine family, Type III IFN,
which provides the primary viral defense mechanism in
fish [6,7]. It is difficult to determine exactly when Type I
and Type III IFN diverged because no Type I IFN has been
identified in amphibians, but the split definitely occurred
prior to the divergence of birds and mammals approximately 310 million years ago (MYA) [5,8]. Type III IFN,
known more commonly in mammals as either IFNlambda (IFNL) or interleukin (IL)28 and IL29, is encoded
by a five exon gene, opposed to the single exon Type I IFN,
and acts through a different receptor complex than Type I
IFN [9,10]. Despite these differences, both Type I and
Type III IFN have similar mechanisms of induction, activate the same signaling pathways, and trigger the same
biological actions in the target cell [11]. Type III IFN has
been retained in some mammalian species including
humans and mice but has been lost in others [12]. Even
when present, it appears to have assumed a less dominant
role as an antiviral agent [11] and may have been supplanted as major player in antiviral defense with the emergence of contemporary Type I IFN.
All Type I IFN elicit an antiviral response, but some may
play a more dominant role as first responders than others.
IFNA and IFNB were the first Type I IFN to be characterized in human and have been assumed to constitute and
the primary viral defense mechanism [13,14]. IFNA is
released by almost all cell types and a few of its family
members, specifically human IFNA2a and IFN2b, are currently approved for treatment of a range of viral diseases
including hepatitis B and C, condylomata acuminate
(genital warts), and AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma [15].
IFNB is the main IFN secreted by fibroblasts in response
to a viral challenge, but is clearly produced by multiple
cell types [16]. It acts in the immediate antiviral response
and helps regulate the later expression of several IFNA
[17]. IFNW and IFNZ both appear to have developed specific niches in antiviral protection for certain species.
IFNW has been implicated in protection against specific
viruses, such as parvovirus, particularly in cats [18,19],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/187

while murine IFNZ provides a unique combination of
high antiviral activity with relatively low lymphomyeolosuppresive activity [20], suggesting it may act to suppress
viruses targeting the bone marrow and spleen. IFNK is predominately expressed in keratinocytes where it is acts
through a unique cell-associated viral protection mechanism [21,22]. IFNE is expressed in a variety of cell types,
but has been suggested on the basis of rather meager evidence to serve a specific role in reproductive tissues either
in viral protection or early placental development [5,23].
IFND and IFNT, on the other hand, are not induced by
viruses but instead are released by the early pre-implantation embryos of swine and ruminant species, respectively,
where they appear to trigger responses in maternal uterine
endometrium that allow the pregnancy to become established [24,25].
The arrangement of Type I IFN genes within the locus
likely reflects the origins and subsequent evolution of
individual family members. All Type I IFN in human and
mouse are clustered in an approximately 400 kb length of
DNA, located on the short arm of chromosome 9 (9p21)
in human and on the centromere-proximal region of
chromosome 4 (4C4) in mouse [26-28]. Two genes of
ancient origin, IFNB and IFNE, define the outer limits of
the locus. All the other Type I IFN genes, except IFNK, are
distributed between these two ancient genes, indicating
the locus has expanded internally as IFN genes duplicated
and then evolved into their respective families [27]. However, species-specific expansion and contraction of families has occurred, with some IFN families only existing in
certain taxonomic groups. For example, IFND has only
been identified in the pig and is absent in the mouse and
human, while IFNZ is represented in the mouse, but only
remnants of the gene has been found in rats, while it is
completely absent in humans [20,25,29]. The IFNW,
which are considered to have arisen from the IFNA at least
129 MYA [16,30], constitute a particularly variable grouping. A single functional IFNW and at least two pseudogenes are present in humans, but only a single
pseudogene can be identified in mice [27]. Even more
bewildering, the family appears to have expanded in cats,
which, on the basis of cDNA evidence, possess at least 10
variants [31], but not even a relic of the open reading
frame can be found in the related carnivore, the dog [32].
Ruminant species, such as cattle, are known to possess
several, apparently functional, IFNW [33,34]. There is
also one example of a Type I family, the IFNT, that arose
relatively recently (36 MYA) in the lineage to the ruminant artiodactyls. As a consequence, the IFNT are absent
from all species except those in the sub-order Ruminantia
[33,35]. Together, these data suggest that novel IFN genes
can be gained and existing genes discarded in response to
specific environmental challenges, which most likely
include threats from emerging new pathogens. In addi-

tion, existing IFN may become co-opted into new roles
unrelated to viral pathogenesis, as has occurred in the case
of the IFND [20,25,29].

LAST, but it can identify shorter sequence matches than
megaBLAST. It was not specifically designed for cross-species comparisons.

Although it has been clear for some time that there are
similarities in the organization of the Type I IFN locus of
cattle and that of other species [36,37], it was equally evident that the bovine locus must have some unique features, most notably because of the existence of the IFNT,
genes unique to ruminant species whose protein products, although active in antiviral assays, have a primary
role as hormones of pregnancy [38]. Cattle also have multiple IFNB while all non-ruminant species so far examined
possess only a single copy IFNB [5]. Together these findings suggest either a decreased restriction on duplication
of Type I IFN genes in cattle or evolutionary pressure to
acquire additional genes. The recent sequencing of the
bovine genome has provided the first opportunity for a
detailed study of the Type I IFN locus in a ruminant species. Here we provide a detailed description and full annotation of the bovine locus and some inferences about its
evolutionary history.

4. TBLASTN was designed to compare a protein sequence
with a nucleotide database dynamically translated in all
reading frames.
NCBI databases
1. The "genome (reference)" database represents the most
current publicly available assembly of a genome. The
most current assembly of the bovine genome at the time
this work was completed was assembly 3.1. The most current assembly for other species examined in this work are
placed in parenthesis here â human (36.2), mouse (37.1),
horse (1.1), and dog (2.1).

2. The "WGS contigs" database contains the contigs, or
overlapping unassembled sequences, that forms the basis
for the assembled genome. Both pig and cat do not have
an assembled genome available at this time and only the
"WGS contigs" database could be searched for genomic
information for these species.

Methods
Annotation
Most of the IFN gene candidates were identified through
the National Center for Biotechnology and Information
(NCBI)'s bovine genome resource by using the basic local
alignment
search
tools
(BLAST)
http:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/BlastGen/Blast
Gen.cgi?taxid=9913[39]. Additional searches were performed through NCBI by using the appropriate genome
resource http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/[40] for
other species, which are discussed later in this section, and
by using the basic nucleotide BLAST suite http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/
Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastHome[41,42].
Several combinations of BLAST algorithms and databases
within NCBI were utilized for this work and are described
below [43].
BLAST algorithms
1. MegaBLAST was designed to compare highly related
nucleotide sequences and works best when the target
sequence has a 95% identity or higher to the query
sequence.

2. Cross-species megaBLAST, also referred to as discontiguous BLAST, is a derivative of megBLAST that ignores certain bases, thereby allowing mismatches. It was designed
to compare nucleotide sequences from one species to
nucleotide sequences in another species.
3. BLASTN also compares nucleotide query sequences to a
nucleotide database. This algorithm is slower than megaB-

3. The "traces-WGS" database contains the trace data for
whole genome shotgun sequence (WGS) bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequencing. This database
contains single pass sequencing reads that are not
trimmed based on quality or vector contamination.
4. The "nucleotide collection (nr/nt)" database contains
all Genbank, RefSeq, EMBL (Europe's primary nucleotide
database), DNA Database of Japan (DDJB), and many
Protein Databank (PDB) sequences. The "nucleotide (nr/
nt)" database is subdivided into "human nucleotide (nr/
nt)," "mouse nucleotide (nr/nt)," and "others nucleotide
(nr/nt)" databases. The "others nucleotide (nr/nt)" database does not contain any mouse or human sequences.
Bovine IFNB, IFNA, IFNW, and IFNT cDNA sequences
(Table 1) from GenBank were used to perform a megaBLAST search in the bovine "genome (resource)" database.
Human IFNE, murine IFNZ, porcine IFND, human IFNK,
and human IFNL/IL28-29 sequences (Table 1) were queried with cross-species megaBLAST in the bovine "genome
(reference)" database because no bovine homologues for
the latter group of genes have been reported. The translated sequence for each of the non-bovine IFN cDNA were
also queried with TBLASTN in the bovine "genome (reference)" database because the TBLASTN algorithm can
often identify homologues that are not detected through
other searches. IFNL/IL28-29 nucleotide and amino acid
sequence were also queried in the bovine "WGS contig"
database by using a cross-species megaBLAST and
TBLASTN search, respectively, to verify no sequence with

high identity to IFNL/IL28-29 in the bovine genome was
missed. Specific genes were analyzed in the bovine
"traces-WGS" database to verify frameshift mutations or
nucleotide variations from the query sequences.

was performed through the Maximum Composite Likelihood method in MEGA version 4 (MEGA4) http://
www.megasoftware.net/[49] to determine the IFN family
for each gene [50,51].

The Bovine Genome Sequencing and Annotation Consortium created a consensus predicted gene set through an
algorithm, termed GLEAN, developed during the annotation of the honey bee that used latent class analysis to
automatically combine disparate gene prediction evidence [44]. Since the majority of positive megaBLAST,
cross-species megaBLAST, and TBLASTN matches were
clustered on two scaffolds, Chr8.25 [Genbank:
and
Chr8.34
[GenNW_001495421]
bank:NW_001495430], all GLEAN models on those two
scaffolds were also annotated through Apollo http://
apollo.berkeleybop.org/current/index.html[45,46].
In
brief, Apollo is a genome annotation viewer and editor
that was originally designed for the annotation of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The Bovine Genome
Sequencing and Annotation Consortium created input
files for Apollo containing EST matches, cDNA matches,
translated protein matches, and gene model data including all GLEAN models for the bovine genome assembly
3.1. GLEAN models present on scaffolds Chr8.25 and
Chr8.34 that had not been identified in the aforementioned searches were queried through BLASTN and discontiguous megaBLAST in the "others nucleotide
collection (nr/nt)" and "human nucleotide collection (nr/
nt)" databases to verify their status as IFN genes or
another gene family. Discontiguous megaBLAST and
TBLASTN searches in human, mouse, equine, porcine,
feline, and canine "genomic (reference)" and "WGS contigs" databases were performed for the unique IFN family
discovered during the annotation of Chr8.34.

IFNT was queried with megaBLAST in the bovine "tracesWGS" database to validate the number of IFN genes
present in the genome. Bovine sequence matches that had
greater than 94% sequence identities to the query IFNT for
more than 400 basepairs (bp) were visually inspected. An
IFNT match was counted as a positive if the sequence had
greater than 98% identity to an IFNT cDNA in the portion
of the trace with a quality score, available through NCBI,
higher than 40 on a scale between 0 and 100. The total
number of IFNT matches in the WGS contig database was
divided by the bovine genome coverage to approximate
the total IFNT gene number.

The 64 identified IFN genes and pseudogenes and the
original query cDNA from Genbank (Table 1) were
aligned through CLUSTALW in BioEdit version 7.09 http:/
/www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/BioEdit.html[47,48].
A
pairwise comparison to known IFN nucleotide sequences

Phylogenetic Reconstruction
Alignments for the genomic IFN ORFs were created
through ClustalW in BioEdit version 7.09, with individual
genes denoted by their GLEAN numbers. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed in MEGA4 through the Neighborjoining (NJ) method with bootstrapping test (1000 replicates). The tree was rooted to IFNK [5] and a second tree
was created with the assumption of a non-uniform rate of
change between sites (gamma = 1).
Identification of repetitive elements
The localization and identity of all repetitive elements
were determined by using the RepeatMasker program
http://www.repeatmasker.org/[52], which uses the RepBase library of repeat elements [53]. Sub-locus 1, corresponding to 20000â711500 bp in scaffold Chr8.25, and
sub-locus 2, corresponding to 2000â446000 bp in scaffold Chr8.34, sequences were first selected through
Apollo and imported into a word processing program,
Microsoft Word. All gaps within the scaffolds, which are
represented by an "N" in the bovine assembly, were
removed manually. IFN sub-loci sequences were then analyzed in RepeatMasker version 3.1.9 run in default mode

with blastp version 2.0MP-WashU http://blast.wustl.edu/
[54] to determine the percentage of repetitive elements.
Bos taurus was set as the assumed species within the program parameters. Simple repeats and low complexity
regions were not masked, which means they were not
excluded as start sites for a BLAST match, and the matrix
was optimized for 42% GC content based on sub-loci
optimization pre-runs.

The IFNA and IFNB are also present in multiple copies,
with 13 and 6 genes, respectively, although neither family
is as large as the IFNW. An apparent IFNB pseudogene,
deemed nonfunctional due to a frameshift deletion, also
exists.
IFND are only represented as three pseudogenes, a not
unexpected finding, as a functional gene has only been
reported previously for the pig [56].

Results and discussion
IFN Gene Families in Bos taurus
Evidence for the presence of all previously known Type I
IFN subfamilies except IFNZ was found on chromosome
8 of the bovine genome assembly 3.1 (Table 2). IFNZ has
only been reported in mouse [27,55], and so its absence
in Bos taurus was anticipated. Both IFNK and IFNE are
present as single genes with intact ORF and are assumed
to be functional, providing the first evidence that either of
these subfamilies is present in ruminants. Bovine IFNK
and IFNE have 81.2% and 84.7% nucleotide identity
respectively when compared to their human orthologues,
values that are similar to their degree of conservation
between human, cat, dog, and pig (A. Walker, unpublished data). The IFNW family is greatly expanded compared to other species that have so far been examined.
There are 24 potential IFNW and at least 8 pseudogenes.
The query IFNW [Genbank:M11002] [34] exactly matches
two IFNW annotated from the genome database (GLEAN
09983 [Bovine Genome Database temporary ID:2733]
and GLEAN 10004 [Bovine Genome Database temporary
ID: 2525]). The remaining IFNW range in sequence identity from 86% to 96% relative to the query sequence.

The number of predicted IFN genes in each subfamily based on
genomic analysis of the mouse, human, and bovine are shown.
Predicted pseudogenes based on frameshift mutations or stop codons
within the first 100 aa of the coding sequence have been excluded
from the table. The bovine Type I IFN locus has an expansion of both
the IFNB and IFNW subfamilies. Cattle have also acquired two novel
IFN subfamilies, IFNT and a previously unidentified IFN family, termed
IFNX, discovered during this analysis.

Three apparently functional IFNT are found within the
locus. Surprisingly none of these provide an exact match
for any of the many cDNA and gene sequences that have
previously been reported. Previous mRNA sequencing of
the IFNT family had indicated that at least 18 bovine IFNT
might exist [57]. Only three IFNT are present in the
bovine genome assembly 3.1, however. One particular,
well established sub-family, the IFNT2 grouping [57], is
not represented at all in the assembly. Additional analysis
revealed 45 acceptable matches to IFNT in the WGS contig
database. Since the bovine genome at this time has 7.1 X
coverage, the number of IFNT matches divided by this
coverage value suggests the possibility of around six IFNT.
One explanation is that these "extra" genes have been lost
in the assembly process, but even this higher value is still
significantly lower than the 10 to 18 IFNT previously
believed to exist. Some of the latter are most likely alleles.
Most interestingly, we detected a novel Type I IFN, which,
as we shall discuss later, consists of three potentially functional genes and one pseudogene, none of which provides
a close sequence match with any previously described
Type I IFN. For convenience, and until an appropriate
nomenclature is approved, this new family will be termed
IFNX.
A weak sequence identity to IFNL was found on chromosome 13, specifically located on scaffold Chr13.80 [Genbank:NW_001493172] from 635,850 to 636,120 bp. This
sequence appears not to encode a functional gene in
either the 3.1 assembly or the WGS contig database. These
data suggest that the Type III IFN family exists only as a
relic and is no longer a functional component in bovine
pathogen defenses.
Locus Map
The Type I IFN locus is organized similarly in mouse and
human, and possibly also in pig, i.e. there is relatively
conserved synteny across rodents, primates, and swine.
Two mammalian IFN genes of ancient origin, IFNB and
IFNE, define the outer limits of the locus, with all the
other genes, except IFNK, distributed between these two
markers. The genes are predominantly (but not exclusively) localized on one strand and transcribed in the
same direction as the IFNB and IFNE [27]. The relative

Page 5 of 15

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:187

arrangements of the murine and human versus the bovine
IFN locus are illustrated in Fig. 1. The bovine Type I IFN
locus is clearly organized differently than that of the other
two species. Instead of a single stretch of DNA defining
the locus, cattle have two sub-loci (1 & 2) encompassing
701 kb and 441 kb, respectively, separated by a gap estimated to be approximately 11 megabases (Mb) in assembly 3.1 (but ~750 kb in assembly 4.0). The gene density
based on the both predicted open reading frames (Gene
Sequence map) and bovine EST and mRNA alignments
with the assembled sequence (BT UniG map) is lower in
the region between the two IFN sub-loci than much of the
rest of chromosome 8, but many genes are present and
actively transcribed.
The following explanation of the locus organization has
been based on the chromosome map assigned during the
assembly process and reported by NCBI (Fig. 2). An IFNB
defines the distal end (relative to the start of the chromosome map) of sub-locus 2 (Fig. 1 &2). IFNE, while present
in the bovine, is located towards the distal end of sublocus 1. The majority of the genes in both sub-loci are
transcribed in the same direction as the distally placed
IFNB, except one cluster of IFNW and IFNA and the solitary IFNE, which are transcribed in the opposite direction.
IFNK is present in a single "copy" nearer to the start of the
chromosome map and well separated (6.044 Mb) from
the closest sub-locus (sub-locus 1) (Fig. 1). The bovine
IFNK location is very similar to that in the human where
a single IFNK is located 6.5 Mb from the Type I IFN locus
[22] (Fig. 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/187

There are three clusters of IFNA/IFNW. Two of them are
on sub-locus 1, one at the proximal end, the second
placed about half way along (Fig. 2). A gene set in the first
IFNA/IFNW cluster 1 is a palindrome to one in the second
cluster. The corresponding gene pairs have complete
nucleotide identity within their coding regions, suggesting
that the duplication or gene conversion event that led to
their formation occurred quite recently. The third cluster
of IFNA/IFNW is at the distal end of sub-locus 2, but lacks
the duplicated group of four genes in IFNA/IFNW clusters
1 and 2.
Only one non-IFN gene is detectable within sub-loci 1
and 2, an intronless kelch-like 9 (KLHL9) located 33.5 kb
proximal to IFNA/IFNW cluster 2 in sub-locus 1 (Fig. 2).
The orthologous KLHL9 gene can be found in the Type I
IFN locus of the mouse approximately 25 kb from the
nearest functional IFN (IFNA8) [27] and 29 kb from the
nearest IFN (IFNA6) in human. The fact KLHL9 has
resisted duplication despite residing close to genes undergoing multiple duplications is noteworthy and possibly
indicates that multiple copies of this gene are not well tolerated.
The presence of KLHL9, which appears to be under different evolutionary constraints than IFNW and IFNA, close
to IFNA/IFNW cluster 2 suggested the cluster as whole
might be under different evolutionary control than cluster
1 or 3. Evolutionary divergence rates do not indicate that
this is the case, however (Table 3). While cluster 1 does
have a slightly higher divergence rate than cluster 2, all

three clusters are relatively constant in their rate of change.
Inter-cluster divergence is actually very low in all three of
the IFNA/IFNW clusters.
The IFNT and two IFNW pseudogenes are neighbors at the
distal end of sub-locus 1, suggesting that this cluster of
genes originated from an IFNW that had become isolated
from other IFNW before the divergence of the IFNT. Its
unique position outside the IFNA/IFNW clusters and
close to the edge of the sub-locus may have permitted the
rapid expansion and evolution of the IFNT family without
the restraints placed on the clustered IFNW.
All non-ruminant species examined to date, including
mouse, human, cats, dogs, rabbits, and pigs, contain only

one IFNB [16]. In cattle, this family has clearly expanded
and extends from the distal end of IFNA/IFNW cluster 3 to
the end of sub-locus 2. Interspersed within these multiple
IFNB are members of the previously unidentified IFN
family, IFNX. Again, it is tempting to hypothesize that the
IFNX and expanded IFNB family were able to emerge due
to their location on the edge of the sub-locus 2, as suggested for the IFNT in sub-locus 1.
Repetitive Elements within Sub-loci
Repetitive elements have been implicated in gene duplication by creating regions predisposed to homologous
recombination [58,59] and also in organizing the assembly of enhanceasomes, as recently described for transcription of IFNB [60]. Over one third of the bovine Type I IFN
locus consists of interspersed repeats, rather less than the
43% assessed for the murine Type I IFN locus [27].
Repeats are more enriched in sub-locus 1 largely because
of the presence of a greater number of long interspersed
nucleotide elements (LINE) and long terminal repeats
(LTR) (Table 4). LINE2 elements are absent in both subloci. Short interspersed nucleotide elements (SINE)s are
present in similar proportions, approximately 15%, for
both sub-loci. The arrangement of these elements provides no obvious insight into whether the sequences are
involved in gene duplication or in controlling transcription.

Palindromic IFN within IFNA/IFNW clusters 1 and 2
As mentioned previously, a gene set located on the distal
end of IFNA/IFNW cluster 1 is a palindrome to a gene set
on the distal end of cluster 2 (Fig. 3A). Two IFNA and two
IFNW are present in each gene set and these are designated as A(1) and A(2) for the two IFNA and W(1) and
W(2) for the two IFNW in cluster 1. A(1) and A(2) are
located at the proximal and distal ends of the gene set in
cluster 1, respectively. W(1) and W(2) are located from
proximal to distal between A(1) and A(2). The genes with
identical ORFs in cluster 2 are designated as A(1)/, A(2)/,
W(1)/, and W(2)/ (Fig. 3B). The ORF and the first 350 bp
of the 3/ UTR for the two IFNA and IFNW gene pairs are
identical, and an approximately 550 bp promoter for both
IFNA gene pairs and the W(2)/W(2)/ pair are also identical. The promoters of the W(1)/W(1)/pair, while closely
similar (99%), are not identical, however. All nucleotide
differences between the W(1)/W(1)/ gene pair are within
a region between 300 bp and 400 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site.

The percentage of repetitive elements for the Type I IFN sub-loci was
calculated in RepeatMasker 3.1.9. The length of nucleotide sequence
encompassing the repetitive element divided by the length of the total
nucleotide sequence for either sub-locus 1 or sub-locus 2 was used to
calculate the percentage shown in each column. Sub-locus 1 has a
higher proportion of LINE1 and LTR elements than sub-locus 2
resulting in a higher total number of interspersed repeats within sublocus.

Two different evolutionary processes, either gene duplication or gene conversion, could possibly explain the existence of the IFNA/IFNW palindromic gene sets. Gene
duplication involves the formation of a new gene copy.
Gene conversion, on the other hand, does not generate
new gene copies, but instead homogenizes existing genes.
Both gene duplication and gene conversion have been
specifically implicated in the evolution of the IFNA in
human, chimpanzee, dog, rhesus monkey, rat, and mouse
[30,61,62]. Gene conversion, specifically, was predicted
by two different statistical programs, GARD and GENECONV, in humans, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, and
mice. Furthermore, despite IFNA genes aligning in conserved positions on a locus map for chimpanzees and
humans, the subfamily separated into species-specific
clades on phylogenetic analysis [61], strongly indicating
gene conversion has occurred in the IFNA subfamily in
these two species. Although gene duplications cannot be
unambiguously distinguished from gene conversions
[63], the latter seldom involve sequence longer than 1 kb
in mammals, with 3 kb considered the maximum length
[63]. Therefore, when the sequence tract involved is "too
large" for gene conversion, gene duplication is usually
implicated [64]. The palindomic gene set involves at least
a 27 kb tract, far exceeding this size limit and reducing the
likelihood of a conversion event. Therefore, a segmental
duplication event, which is a specific type of gene duplication that involves a large segment of a locus, combined
with an inversion is the best explanation for the palindrome [65].
Selective Pressure on the ORF of Type I IFN Subfamilies
Comparison of the rate of non-synonymous nucleotide
change relative to the rate of synonymous change can provide information about the type of selection operating on
the members of a multigene families [66]. If neutral selection is occurring, then all nucleotides in a sequence are
equally likely to change. Consequently the rate of synonymous nucleotide changes (dS) will be equal to the rate of
non-synonymous changes (dN) and dS:dN will equal 1.
Rapid change in the amino acid sequence is the desired
endpoint for positive selective pressure. Hence, in this scenario, dN will exceed dS, and dN:dS will be greater than 1.
Conversely, if strong selection against amino acid change
is present (purifying selection), dN will be less than dS
and dN:dS will be less than 1. Virtually all pairwise comparisons within IFNA, whatever the species [61,67], and
IFNT [57] have shown the overall value for dN not to be
significantly higher than dS. Indeed, dN values have been
generally calculated to be lower than dS, consistent with
the conclusion that there has not been strong positive
selection for amino acid change within the coding regions
of these subfamilies of IFN.

Palindromic gene sets within IFNA/IFNW clusters 1 and 2. (A) An enlarged image of IFNA/IFNW clusters 1 and 2 from
Fig. 2 is shown. (B) The promoter (Pr), ORF, and 3/ UTR for each gene have been depicted in a schematic of both gene sets
(not drawn to scale). The direction of gene transcription is indicated by an arrow above each gene and the GLEAN number is
written below each gene (GLEAN 09981 [Bovine Genome Database temporary ID:2371], GLEAN 09982 [Bovine Genome

3/ UTRs are shown in matching solid colors. The only gene pair that does not have 100% nucleotide identity in the promoter,
W(1)/W(1)/, is indicated by diagonal stripes through the promoter box.
The dN:dS for all multigene bovine IFN subfamilies,
including only IFN annotated during this work, is illustrated in Fig. 4. The dN and dS values for every gene pair
in a Type I IFN subfamily were calculated and plotted
against each other. No multigene IFN subfamily (IFNA,
IFNB, IFNW, or IFNT) in bovine has a dN significantly
exceeding dS. In fact, bovine IFNA and IFNW provide

strong evidence for purifying selection. The significance of
purifying selection within IFNW and IFNA subfamilies
was also verified through a codon based Z-test (p <
0.001), which determines selective pressure for a gene pair
or group of genes based on the difference between dN and
dS through a one-tailed t-test (Table 5). Four IFNB pairs
out of 15 pairwise comparisons examined provide some

evidence for purifying selection on the basis of the pairwise codon based Z-test (Table 6), but such selective pressures are not evident for the family as a whole (p = 0.171).
On the other hand, the same test employed for neutral
selection provided no evidence for a lack of selective pressure operating on any members of the IFNB subfamily (p
= 0.343), indicating the six genes comprising the bovine
IFNB subfamily may be too few for a meaningful analysis.
Since only three IFNT were identified, statistical analysis
of this subfamily from the genomic data was not possible.
The classic model of gene duplication states that after a
duplication event one gene continues to perform the
ancestral function while the second either rapidly evolves
to fill a new niche or becomes inactive [65,68,69]. As a
consequence gene duplication is usually followed by a
period in which there is an acquisition of non-synonymous nucleotide changes in one of the two genes, leading
to a divergence in amino acid sequence. This temporary
relaxation of purifying selection, in which dN:dS
approaches 1, permits the gene to become fine-tuned to
its new role or, more commonly, results in pseudogenization. Such a sequence of events does not appear to have
occurred during the large scale expansion of the IFNW
family where there is strong evidence for purifying selection operating on the coding regions of the genes (Fig. 4
& Table 5). One potential explanation is that sub-functionalization is occurring through alterations in the manner in which these genes are subjected to transcriptional
control rather than in the structure of the proteins themselves. Evidence for positive selective pressure in the regulatory regions of IFNW would strongly support this
hypothesis, but a detailed promoter analysis is beyond the
scope of this work.
IFNX: Evidence for a novel subfamily
Based on the current assembly, the IFNX subfamily consists of three potential genes and one probable pseudogene. The origin of these genes is currently unclear, but they
appear to constitute a unique IFN subfamily, whose closest relatives are the IFNA based on a Maximum Composite Likelihood divergence analysis, with IFNX sharing over

The significance of purifying selection in the coding regions of IFNW
and IFNA subfamilies was verified through a codon based Z-test
analyzing the overall average for the subfamilies. The p-value is shown
in the second column with p-values less than 0.05 considered

65% nucleotide identity to IFNA and only about 45%
nucleotide identity to IFNB. They are clearly defined on
phylogenetic trees based on their ORF as a distinct clade
that is most closely related to IFNA; however, phylogenetic analyses are conflicting with regard to when IFNX
first appeared. Phylogenetic trees calculated on the
assumption that all nucleotide sites within the coding
sequence change at the same rate indicate IFNA separated
from IFNX prior to or corresponding with the radiation of
eutherian mammals, i.e. more than 150 MYA [35] (Fig.
5A). Conversely, phylogenetic trees that take into account
substitution rate variation from site to site indicate that
bovine IFNX and bovine IFNA emerged from a common
ancestor after the radiation of the major mammalian
orders (Fig. 5B). In other words, this model recognizes
that certain amino acids and, by corollary certain nucleotides, are more highly conserved than others across subfamilies. This second model most closely matches the
amino acid differences among IFN subfamilies, since
amino acids critical to preserving the tertiary structures of
IFNB, IFNA, IFNT, and IFNL are much more highly conserved than ones in less critical regions of the proteins
[55,70]. Preliminary examination of IFNX indicate some
of the more highly conserved amino acids for other Type
I IFN, such as cysteine residues 1 and 99 (discussed
below), are also conserved in IFNX. In addition IFNX and
the IFNX pseudogene are absent in human, mouse, porcine, feline, and canine genomic databases, yet some remnants of their presence might be expected if this family
emerged early in the evolution of mammals and prior to
the main radiation events.
Two of the three potential IFNX genes contain the four
conserved cysteine residues required for the disulfide
bonds (1â99; 29â139) encountered in IFNA and those
Type I subfamilies that emerged from IFNA, namely
IFNW, IFND, and IFNT. The third potential gene, GLEAN
24316 [Bovine Genome Database temporary ID:2755],
contains an early termination codon at codon 125, which
eliminates the second disulfide bond (29â139) (Fig. 6),
raising the possibility that it is a second pseudogene. The
"trace-WGS" database was visually examined to verify the
presence of this early stop codon. Five BACs, all of which
were in the minus orientation, contained sequences that
exactly matched the complementary sequence to Glean
24316, i.e. all contained the early termination codon.
Previous studies of IFNA have identified three regions that
are strongly associated with IFN-receptor interaction and
are termed interferon receptor recognition peptides
(IRRP)1â3 [70-72]. IRRP1 (27â35) and IRRP2 (78â105)
control the initial binding of IFN to the Type I receptor
and are highly conserved among IFNA. IRRP3 (123â140)
modulates the downstream signaling pathways, so that
amino acid changes in this region can explain some differ-

Selective Pressure on the coding regions of bovine Type I IFN
Selective Pressure on the coding regions of bovine Type I IFN. Pairwise analysis of the coding region between every
gene pair in a Type I IFN subfamily was used to calculate dS and dN, and the two values were plotted against one another. No
comparisons were made between genes belonging to different subfamilies, i.e. an IFNB gene and an IFNA gene. In addition, all
probable pseudogenes, which contained early stop codons or frameshift mutations, were not included in the analysis. The grey
diagonal line in the graph represent neutral selection rate where dS = dN. Gene pairs undergoing positive selection would
appear above the diagonal and gene pairs undergoing purifying selection would appear below the diagonal. The graph clearly
shows that no positive selection is occurring within the coding regions of any Type I IFN family. Furthermore, IFNW and IFNA
subfamilies appear to be undergoing purifying selection.

ences in biological activity among different IFNA. The
protein products of the three IFNX do not possess identical IRRP1 and IRRP2 motifs as IFNA, but these two
regions are highly conserved within the subfamily,
emphasizing, first, the possible importance of this motif
and second that the IFNX family is unique and distinct
from IFNA. IRRP3 was absent in GLEAN 24316 again suggesting that it may be a pseudogene. The two remaining
IFNX members differed in their IRRP3 sequences, a not

unexpected finding as changes in this region may provide
subtle differences in biologic activity between the two
family members. None of the IFNX genes contain the Nglycosylation sequence (N-X-S/T) common in other Type
I IFNs that could alter IFN-receptor interaction.
No evidence for IFNX expression could be found in any
EST databases, although, genes with high identity to IFNX
exist in the equine genomic database. The conservation of

ID:2546], and 24316 [Bovine Genome Database temporary ID:2733]) and are aligned with bovine IFNA [Genbank:DQ396807].
The mature coding sequence of the three potentially expressed IFNX genes differs as follows 164 amino acids (aa) for Glean
24310, 163 aa for Glean 24314, and 124 aa for 24316. Conserved cysteine residues form disulfide bonds in IFNA between positions 1â99 and 29â139 and are shown in yellow. Glean 24316 has an early stop codon that eliminates the second disulfide
bond, but both Glean 24314 and Glean 24310 encode these conserved residues. Regions strongly associated with receptor
binding in IFNA, or interferon receptor recognition peptides (IRRP), are boxed in blue.

this gene family in species that diverged at least 80 million
years ago suggests that the family may have an important
function in ungulates. However, the apparent absence of
IFNX genes in pigs, also an ungulate, is puzzling. Possibly,
IFNX has a specific function in herbivores that is not
required in omnivores, most likely in immune defense
against particular viruses or other pathogenic organisms
affecting such species.
The identification of a novel Type I IFN gene, the IFNX, is
an unexpected and possibly important finding. The proteins encoded by this family of genes differ sufficiently in
primary sequence from related Type I IFN to justify a separate designation from the related IFNA and IFNB. The
presence of a distinct cluster of IFNX within the Type I IFN
locus, the phylogenetic position of IFNX as a separate
clade within the IFN tree, and the conservation of critical
amino acid residues, are totally consistent with classifying
the IFNX as a distinct Type I IFN subfamily. Whether IFNX
are responsive to a viral challenge and able to interact with

the Type I IFN receptor and elicit a typical Type I response
in their target cells has yet to be verified. Substantial work
will be necessary to characterize this subfamily fully, but
its place as a separate clade within the Type I IFN would
appear to be assured.

Conclusion
The Type I IFN locus has undergone substantial transformation in ruminants compared to humans and mice. The
conserved locus structure has been transformed, subfamilies have expanded, and two subfamilies not present
in either humans or mice exist. The division of the locus
into two sub-loci may have provided an opportunity for
genes to duplicate and contribute to an expanded function of the Type I IFN. The divergence of the successful
pecoran ruminant sub-order and its geographic spread
might have required improved protection against unique
ruminant pathogens. The IFNX sub-family and the greatly
expanded ruminant specific IFNW are likely candidates
for providing such protection. Radically new functions for

Type I IFN might also have been gained, such as the one
exemplified by the IFNT, whose appearance coincided
with, and possibly permitted, the acquisition of the
unique, synepitheliochorial placentation that characterizes the Ruminantia sub-order and requires powerful conceptus signaling before the trophoblast has even attached
to the uterine wall [24]. The ancient Type III IFN (IFNL/
IL28-29) may have become a casualty of the expansion
and broadened the role of the Type I locus, as only an
inactive IFNL remains in the bovine genome. It is tempting to speculate that the function of IFNL has been
replaced as the component genes of the Type I IFN locus
expanded.
The authors concede that the bovine genome assembly is
a work in progress and that the predicted arrangement of
individual IFN genes may have to be modified as data are
reanalyzed. In addition, it is clear that an individual animal possesses unique genomic peculiarities, including
inversions, duplications, and presence and absence of specific genes and that the IFN locus of a single Hereford cow
may not be replicated precisely in other breeds. Nevertheless, with the exception of the size of the "gap" between
the two sub-loci, the organization and sequence of the
bovine Type I IFN have remained relatively constant
through the most recent assemblies. The unique features
of the locus, which include the presence of the gap itself,
the arrangements of IFNW/IFNA clusters, the dramatic
expansion of the IFNW, the presence of the IFNX, and the
separation of IFNT from the IFNW/IFNA clusters are consistent observations and unlikely to undergo drastic reevaluation in future versions of the assembly.
