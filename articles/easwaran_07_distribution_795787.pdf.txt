Abstract
Background: DNA replication in higher eukaryotic cells is organized in discrete subnuclear sites
called replication foci (RF). During the S phase, most replication proteins assemble at the RF by
interacting with PCNA via a PCNA binding domain (PBD). This has been shown to occur for many
mammalian replication proteins, but it is not known whether this mechanism is conserved in
evolution.
Results: Fluorescent fusions of mammalian replication proteins, Dnmt1, HsDNA Lig I and
HsPCNA were analyzed for their ability to target to RF in Drosophila cells. Except for HsPCNA,
none of the other proteins and their deletions showed any accumulation at RF in Drosophila cells.
We hypothesized that in Drosophila cells there might be some other peptide sequence responsible
for targeting proteins to RF. To test this, we identified the DmDNA Lig I and compared the protein
sequence with HsDNA Lig I. The two orthologs shared the PBD suggesting a functionally conserved
role for this domain in the Drosophila counterpart. A series of deletions of DmDNA Lig I were
analyzed for their ability to accumulate at RF in Drosophila and mammalian cells. Surprisingly, no
accumulation at RF was observed in Drosophila cells, while in mammalian cells DmDNA Lig I
accumulated at RF via its PBD. Further, GFP fusions with the PBD domains from Dnmt1, HsDNA
Lig I and DmDNA Lig I, were able to target to RF only in mammalian cells but not in Drosophila
cells.
Conclusion: We show that S phase in Drosophila cells is characterized by formation of RF marked
by PCNA like in mammalian cells. However, other than PCNA none of the replication proteins and
their deletions tested here showed accumulation at RF in Drosophila cells while the same proteins
and deletions are capable of accumulating at RF in mammalian cells. We hypothesize that unlike
mammalian cells, in Drosophila cells, replication proteins do not form long-lasting interactions with
the replication machinery, and rather perform their functions via very transient interactions at the
RF.

Background
In higher eucaryotes DNA replication progresses in a
defined spatio-temporal pattern. Specific segments of the

DNA/chromatin replicate as discrete regions, which when
visualized by light microscopy, are called replication foci
(RF). It is suggested that each replication focus is consti-

tuted of a subchromosomal domain of adjacent replicons
from the same chromosomal region that replicate
together in time and space and their associated protein
machines (replisomes). These subchromosomal domains
are maintained as single units through multiple rounds of
cell division, and they occupy stable positions in the
nucleus [1-4]. The existence of various patterns of RF has
been demonstrated in living mammalian cells by labeling
the RF with fluorescent proteins fused to core replication
factors, like DNA Ligase I or PCNA [5-8]. Such studies
have shown that replication proteins continuously assemble at many subchromosomal domains to form RF, and
continuously disassemble from sites that have completed
replication (reviewed in [9]. This cycle of assembly and
disassembly progresses throughout S phase giving rise to
the distinct patterns of RF.
For an understanding of the process of DNA replication as
it occurs in vivo, it is essential to define the mechanisms
by which various proteins assemble at the RF. The first
protein identified at these foci during S phase was PCNA
[10,11]. PCNA forms a homotrimeric ring around the
DNA and functions as a processivity factor for the replicative DNA polymerases [12,13]. Many other proteins have
since been shown to be accumulated at these sites, including the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1)
[14], DNA polymerase alpha [15], DNA Ligase I [16,5],
RPA70 and cell cycle regulators cyclin A and cdk2 [17],
and DNA repair factors like uracil-DNA-glycosylase [18].
Such replication factors undergo dynamic re-distribution
in the nucleus during S phase. In the G1 phase, most replication proteins are homogeneously distributed in the
nucleoplasm. Upon entry into S phase, replication proteins form punctate patterns that co-localize with sites of
active DNA synthesis. This accumulation at RF is mediated by specific peptide sequences in the replication proteins called replication foci targeting sequence (RFTS). A
known mechanism of recruitment of replication factors to
RF is through the interaction with PCNA, via a short
amino acid motif termed PCNA binding domain (PBD).
This has been observed to be a recurrent mechanism utilized by many replication factors. Over the years many
proteins involved in DNA metabolism and cell cycle regulation have been shown to interact with PCNA via the
canonical PBD found in Dnmt1 [19,7] and DNA Ligase I
[20]. The PBD is conserved in homologous proteins from
archaebacteria, yeast, worms, flies, amphibians and mammals [21]. Such conservation across different classes of
organisms suggests that the recruitment of proteins to RF
mediated by PBD-PCNA interaction is a mechanism conserved throughout evolution. Indeed, many features of
DNA replication are conserved in higher eucaryotes.
Firstly, general features of the replication process itself,
like bi-directional replication fork movement, continuous
leading and discontinuous lagging strand synthesis,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/42

requirement of RNA primers to start DNA synthesis are all
conserved [22]. Secondly, the proteins involved in controlling DNA replication and catalyzing the process of
DNA replication are conserved in diverse eucaryotes [23].
Thirdly, organization of replication into RF that follow a
spatio-temporal pattern is a conserved feature in diverse
eucaryotes that have been analyzed [24,25]. Other than
the conservation of the PBD in homologous proteins,
however, there is no experimental evidence whether the
mechanisms by which replication factors accumulate at
RF are conserved in evolution. We have, therefore, analyzed the ability of mammalian replication proteins to
accumulate at the RF in Drosophila cells and vice versa.

Results
PCNA is highly conserved in S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster
and mammals
The mechanistic basis for the association of replication
factors with RF has been proposed to be mediated via
interaction of PBD with PCNA. To understand whether
the PBD-mediated association of proteins with RF is conserved in evolution, we first analyzed the conservation of
PCNA protein sequence from divergent eucaryotes, especially the regions shown to interact with the PBD of
p21Cip1/Waf1 [26]. The alignment in Figure 1A shows that
PCNA is conserved in organisms as divergent as yeast, flies
and mammals. HsPCNA is about 35% identical to
ScPCNA and 70% identical to DmPCNA. The residues of
PCNA that interact with the PBD of p21Cip1/Waf1 are more
than 75% identical. Also the PBD is conserved in homologous proteins involved in DNA metabolism from archaebacteria, yeast, worms, flies, amphibians and mammals
(Figure 1B) (see also [21]) suggesting that the association
of proteins to RF mediated by PCNA is a mechanism conserved through evolution. We put this hypothesis to test
by analyzing whether the PBD containing mammalian
replication proteins can accumulate at RF in Drosophila
cells.
Human PCNA and Drosophila PCNA can accumulate at
RF across the two organisms
Before testing whether replication proteins could accumulate at the RF across species and whether PCNA binding
would be required, we had to first establish whether the
PCNA in the two systems were interchangeable in that it
could load onto RF in the heterologous system. To this
end, we analyzed the association of human PCNA
(HsPCNA) with RF in Drosophila cells (S2 cells) and Drosophila PCNA (DmPCNA) in mouse cells (C2C12 cells).
As shown in Figure 1 both have 70% overall amino acid
identity.

Expression plasmids encoding HsPCNA, GFP-HsPCNA
and GFP-DmPCNA were constructed and introduced into
cells by calcium phosphate transfection. Subnuclear local-

ization of HsPCNA in transfected S2 cells was accomplished by indirect immunostaining with anti-PCNA
antibody (FL261, Santa Cruz) that reacted specifically
with HsPCNA (Figure 2A). Transfected cells in S phase
showed punctate BrdU staining representing RF to which
HsPCNA colocalized (Figure 2B). Also GFP-HsPCNA is
targeted to RF in S2 cells (Figure 2B). Similarly, mammalian C2C12 cells expressing GFP-DmPCNA showed complete colocalization of GFP-DmPCNA with RF (Figure
2C). Since the available antibody against DmPCNA cross
reacts with mouse PCNA, localization of untagged
DmPCNA in mouse cells was not possible. Owing to the
high sequence similarity of HsPCNA with DmPCNA (Figure 1A) and the conserved structure of PCNA from divergent eucaryotes [27], efficient association of HsPCNA
with RF in S2 cells indicates that HsPCNA must be replacing endogenous PCNA in S2 cells. Thus, these results
show that the basic replication machinery in the two
organisms is conserved and core replication factors are
interchangeable.
It appears from the images that the size of RF in Drosophila are larger than in mammalian cells. However,
measurement of the size of RF in mammalian cells
showed that the average size of early/mid-S phase RF is
0.52 µm (std. deviation = 0.11) while in Drosophila the
average size is 0.37 µm (std. deviation = 0.06). The contrary appears to be the case in the images because Drosophila nuclei are small and the images are presented at a
higher digital zoom as can be seen from the different scale
bars for mammalian and Drosophila nuclei. Further,
compared to mammalian cells, there appears to be lower
number of RF in Drosophila cells. This is probably due to
the smaller size of the Drosophila genome (about 1/22
times the mammalian genome).
Subnuclear localization of PCNA interacting proteins
during S phase in Drosophila cells
In order to determine whether the mechanisms mediating
recruitment of proteins to RF in different organisms are
conserved, we evaluated the ability of mammalian Dnmt1
to accumulate at RF in Drosophila S2 cells. S2 cells were
transfected with plasmids encoding chimeric fusions of
the N-terminal domain of Dnmt1 with the GFP epitope
(NMT-GFP) (summarized in Figure 3A). NMT-GFP accumulated at RF in mouse C2C12 cells (Figure 3B). NMTGFP has a PBD and therefore it is predicted that this fusion
protein should target to RF in Drosophila S2 cells. Surprisingly, NMT-GFP did not colocalize with RF in S2 cells
(Figure 3C). Rather, in S2 cells, NMT-GFP seemed to be
diffused throughout the nucleus as well as aggregating in
some regions to form large structures. To test whether this
is an artifact of the fusion protein in S2 cells, S2 cells were
transfected with a plasmid encoding full length untagged
Dnmt1(s) and the association of Dnmt1(s) with RF was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/42

analyzed. Like NMT-GFP, Dnmt1(s) did not accumulate
at RF (Figure 3D; top panel) in the majority of cells,
though in about 10% cells in S phase Dnmt1(s) seemed
to partially colocalize with RF (Figure 3D; bottom panel),
or with a subset of Drosophila chromatin. The latter did
not correspond to the chromocenter (data not shown).
The extent of colocalization of Dnmt1 and BrdU was analyzed quantitatively by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PC) and Mander's coefficient. The former
gives an estimate of intensity-based correlation of the
green (Dnmt1) and red (BrdU) signals. The PC value
ranges from -1 (no correlation) to +1 (complete correlation) with values in between indicating different degrees
of partial correlation. The average PC value (N = 10) for
Dnmt1 and BrdU is 0.66 (std. deviation = 0.08) indicating
that there is a partial colocalization. The Mander's coefficient measures the fraction of green (Dnmt1) signal overlapping with red (BrdU) signal and vice versa. On an
average 23% (std. deviation = 9%) of Dnmt1 signal
showed overlap with BrdU while 47% (std. deviation =
13%) of BrdU signal showed overlap with the Dnmt1.
This indicates that there is a higher proportion of Dnmt1
that is present in regions devoid of BrdU and there is a
partial colocalization of Dnmt1 and BrdU. However, a
closer look at the images shows that Dnmt1 tends to accumulate in regions that are devoid of BrdU and partial
colocalization with BrdU occurs in regions where the
Dnmt1 signal is lower than the average.
It is surprising that a PBD-containing protein that efficiently accumulates at RF in mammalian cells does not
behave similarly in Drosophila cells even though their
basic replication machinery is similar. Reduced efficiency
in the targeting of Dnmt1to RF in Drosophila cells could
be an artifact of a protein that is foreign to Drosophila as
this organism lacks a Dnmt1homologue. So we tested the
targeting of human DNA Ligase I (HsDNA Lig I) to RF in
S2 cells. DNA Ligase I is a core replication enzyme
involved in ligating Okazaki fragments during synthesis
of the lagging strand. DNA Ligase I is conserved in evolutionarily distant organisms and the Drosophila DNA
Ligase I (DmDNA Lig I) homologue is 50% identical to
HsDNA Lig I (Figure 4). A GFP fusion of HsDNA Lig I was
expressed in S2 cells and its subnuclear localization was
analyzed. GFP-HsLig showed a diffused nuclear distribution in S2 cells in all interphase stages without any discernible colocalization with RF in S phase (Figure 3E). In
contrast, as shown previously [5], GFP-HsLig was efficiently targeted to RF in mouse cells (Figure 3F). Strikingly, the inability of GFP-HsLig to accumulate at RF in
any of the S2 cells in S phase suggested that the PBD is
unable to function as a replication foci targeting sequence
(RFTS) in Drosophila. To further test this, the PBD from
Dnmt1 (termed MTPBD) and HsDNA Lig I (termed
HsLigPBD) were individually fused to GFP and expressed

in Drosophila cells. Both MTPBD-GFP and HsLigPBDGFP were diffusely distributed in the nucleus and did not
show any discernible localization or exclusion from the
RF (Figure 3G). The same fusions though were clearly targeted to RF in mammalian cells ([7] and data not shown).
Thus, even though the 10 aa PBD plus the 10 aa region
rich in basic residues are enough for targeting to RF as
observed in mouse cells, it is unable to do so in Drosophila cells. Alternatively, in Drosophila, the mechanism
behind recruitment of proteins to RF may not be dependent on the PBD, but rather some other unique protein
motif might function as an RFTS.
Search for an RFTS in Drosophila
To determine whether another protein sequence functions as an RFTS in Drosophila, we sought to clone a replication protein from Drosophila and identify its RFTS.
Since DNA Ligase I is well conserved from yeast to
humans, we searched the Drosophila genome database
and the EST database (BDGP) [28] for putative DNA
Ligase I homologues with DNA Ligase I sequence from
different organisms (mouse, human, yeast) as query.
Three putative homologues were identified in the EST
database, viz. LD41868. AT15112, and LD06019 with
corresponding predicted proteins CG5602, CG17227 and
CG12176 respectively (Figure 4A). Comparison of the
protein sequences of these potential homologues with
HsDNA Lig I showed that the putative DNA ligase I in
Drosophila is CG5602 (henceforth called DmDNA Lig I;
Figure 4A–C). The EST clone (LD41868) coding for
CG5602 was obtained and the sequence was verified. An
81 bp segment in the coding region of the predicted gene
was found to be absent in the cDNA clone (Figure 4D).
The DmDNA Lig I protein sequence was analyzed in order
to identify sequences similar to the PBD. This revealed the
presence of a PBD sequence (designated as DmDNA Lig IPBD) that had all the features of HsDNA Lig I-PBD
required for accumulation at replication foci, viz. the 10
amino acid region interacting with PCNA immediately
followed by the 10 amino acid sequence rich in basic residues (Figure 4E). Additionally, two sequences with weak
similarity to the conserved PBD were identified and called
as PBD-1 and -2 (Figure 4E).

To determine whether DmDNA Lig I employs some other
protein sequence as an RFTS instead of the conserved
PBD, a series of deletion mutants of DmDNA Lig I fused
to GFP were constructed (Figure 5A) and their subnuclear
localization with respect to RF was analyzed in both
mouse and Drosophila cells. Immunoblotting analysis
showed that proteins of the correct size were expressed
from these plasmids (data not shown). The full length
protein fused to GFP (GdL) did not show accumulation at
RF in Drosophila S2 cells (Figure 5B), whereas it colocalized with RF in mammalian C2C12 cells (Figure 5B).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/42

None of the deletions, GdL-1, -2, -3 and -4, showed colocalization with RF in both Drosophila and mammalian
cells (Figure 5A and data not shown). Thus, neither the
full length DmDNA Lig I nor any of the deletions fused to
GFP accumulated at RF in Drosophila cells. The fact that
only GdL, but none of GdL-1 to 4 associates with RF in
mouse cells indicates that this association is mediated by
the DmDNA Lig I-PBD. Thus, the ability of the minimal
DmDNA Lig I-PBD to accumulate at RF in Drosophila and
mouse cells was analyzed. As observed with HsLigPBDGFP and MTPBD-GFP (Figure 3G), DmLigPBD-GFP colocalized with RF in mammalian C2C12 cells but not in
Drosophila S2 cells (Figure 5C). Taken together, these
results show that: (i) DmDNA Lig I associates with RF in
mouse cells via the DmDNA Lig I-PBD; (ii) interestingly,
DmDNA Lig I does not accumulate at RF in Drosophila
cells.
In summary, except for PCNA none of the other replication proteins accumulate at RF in Drosophila cells. Most
notably, DmDNA Lig I does not accumulate at RF in Drosophila cells while it does so in mouse cells. This probably
indicates a fundamental difference in the kinetics of association of proteins with RF in Drosophila cells and mammalian cells.

Discussion
The observation that immunostaining for PCNA and
BrdU incorporation sites gives a punctate pattern indicates
that in Drosophila cells, like mammalian cells, DNA replication is organized in discrete structures or RF (Figure 2).
This is consistent with the previous observation that replication in Drosophila Kc cells occurs at subnuclear foci
[25]. The polymerase clamp PCNA is highly conserved
between human and Drosophila (Figure 1) and HsPCNA
and DmPCNA can efficiently accumulate at RF across the
two organisms (Figure 2). This indicates that PCNA, a
conserved central core at the replication fork, is structurally and functionally exchangeable at the RF between
mammals and Drosophila. In a recent report, Kisielewska
et al. showed that GFP-PCNA can be used as an S-phase
marker in early stage embryo during syncytial nuclear
divisions [29]. However, this study revealed that there is
no punctate accumulation of GFP-HsPCNA during these
early embryonic nuclear divisions. Our own unpublished
results on live transgenic Drosophila embryos expressing
GFP-HsPCNA corroborate these results. Inability of GFPHsPCNA to form RF in these early cell division cycles is
best explained by the short S phases resulting from firing
of closely spaced origins unlike that in adult cells.
It has been proposed based on homology search data that
proteins with PBD accumulate at RF in S phase cells [21].
However, in Drosophila cells PCNA interacting proteins
(Dnmt1 and DNA Ligase I) did not show any accumula-

tion at RF (Figure 3). Due to the general inability of PBDGFP fusions from different origins (Dnmt1, HsDNA
Ligase I, DmDNA Ligase I) to accumulate at RF in Drosophila cells, we argued that in Drosophila another
domain might function as an RFTS. However, deletion
analysis of DmDNA Ligase I fused to GFP showed that
neither the full length DmDNA Ligase I nor any of the
deletions accumulated at RF in Drosophila cells (Figure
5). However, DmDNA Ligase I accumulated at RF in
mammalian cells via its PBD (Figure 5C). This also indicates that DmDNA Ligase I fused to GFP is expressed and
folded properly and that the inability to accumulate at RF
in Drosophila cells cannot be attributed to improper
expression or misfolding.
The absence of accumulation of both HsDNA Lig I and
DmDNA Lig I at RF in Drosophila cells, and rather a diffused nuclear distribution, could be attributed to a high
background of overexpressed protein that might occlude
accumulation at RF. Such occluded accumulation could
be then revealed by detergent extraction of soluble proteins [30]. However, the CMV-IE promoter used in all the
expression vectors here is much weaker in Drosophila
cells compared to the mammalian cells. The expression is
about 10 times lower in Drosophila cells compared to
mammalian cells as indicated by the observation that the
intensity of GFP signal in Drosophila cells is 10 times less
than that in mammalian cells. Thus, lower expression levels in Drosophila cells preclude masking of GFP-fusion
protein accumulation at RF.
Interestingly, amongst the various PCNA-binding proteins tested only Dnmt1 and its deletion, NMT, showed
some punctate distribution in the nucleus, which was
though mostly excluded from BrdU stained regions. This
punctate pattern was more evident with NMT whereas the
GFP fusions of HsDNA Lig I and DmDNA Lig I showed
more diffused nuclear pattern. In mammalian cells
Dnmt1 shows a preference for heterochromatic regions
via a domain in its N-terminus called TS during the G2
phase. Analysis of the punctate Dnmt1 pattern with Drosophila heterochromatin stained using anti-HP1 antibody
did not reveal any preferential accumulation of Dnmt1 at
Drosophila heterochromatin (data not shown). Thus, it is
not completely clear what the punctate Dnmt1 pattern
means. Further, this punctate pattern is more pronounced
with NMT-GFP where the accumulation tends to be
around the nucleolus in most cells (Figure 3C). One
explanation for this accumulation could be that the N-terminal domain of Dnmt1 has multiple functional
domains that have been show to interact with DNA and
various proteins (like PCNA, HDAC, Rb, HP1, G9a) in
mammalian cells. In mammalian cells these interactions
are regulated, for example, we have shown that the interaction with PCNA is cell cycle dependent [7]. However,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/42

Dnmt1 being a completely foreign protein in Drosophila
cells, these interactions or other non-specific interactions
might not be regulated, which probably results in some
aggregation.
The fact that except for PCNA, no localization at Drosophila RF was observed with the other replication factors
analyzed here does not rule out very transient and shortlived associations of these factors with the RF. This is supported by recent studies from our group where clear differences in the mobility and interaction of PCNA binding
proteins and PCNA with RF were measured. Whereas
PCNA formed a stable accumulation at the RF, PCNA
interacting proteins like DNA Ligase I and FenI only transiently associated and were not stable components of the
replication machinery [31,32]. Thus, lack of accumulation
of proteins at RF does not exclude interaction with components at RF. This could be true for studies on other proteins and their cognate cellular structures and lack of
accumulation cannot be interpreted as absence of activity
at the respective cellular structures.

Conclusion
In conclusion, no accumulation of replication factors at
RF could be detected in Drosophila cells, suggesting a fundamental difference between Drosophila and mammalian cells. While replication in Drosophila cells seems to
rely on transient interaction with highly mobile factors,
mammalian cells seem to have evolved more stable interactions with higher order structures possibly to cope with
the challenges of replicating a genome 22 times as big as
the fly genome.

Methods
Expression plasmids
The various plasmid constructs encoding translational
fusions of Dnmt1 [7], HsPCNA [6], DmPCNA, HsDNA
Ligase I [5] and DmDNA Ligase I with GFP were derived
from the following vectors: pEMT [33], pEGFP-N2 (Clontech), pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), pEVRF0 [34]. Eucaryotic
expression in all cases is driven by the cytomegalovirus
immediate-early enhancer-promoter. Wherever PCR was
used to generate the required insert, the sequence was verified by sequencing (GATC). The PBD inserts for MTPBDGFP, HsLigPBD-GFP and DmLigPBD-GFP fusion proteins
were generated from annealed sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to PBD coding region
(sequences available on request). The oligonucleotides
were flanked with overhangs corresponding to products
of Eco RI and Xma I digestions. The sense and anti-sense
oligonucleotides were annealed in Sequenase buffer [0.2
M Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.2 M MgCl 2, 1 M NaCl] and subcloned into pEGFP-N2 digested with Eco RI and Xma I.

Cell culture and transfections
Drosophila Schneider's line 2 (S2 cells) were grown in a
humidified atmosphere at a temperature of 25°C and
maintained in Shields and Sang M3 medium (Sigma)
with 10% FCS at a density of 0.5 × 106 to 2 × 106 cells/ml.
Transient transfections were done using the CaPO4-DNA
coprecipitation method [35,36]. Cells were transfected at
a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. 48 hrs after transfection, the
cells were washed gently with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS), fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and immunostained.
BrdU labeling and immunofluorescence staining
For immunostaining and microscopic analysis, S2 cells
were cultured on polylysine coated glass coverslips to
enhance attachment of cells to the coverslip. For detection
of RF, cells grown on coverslips were incubated in
medium with 100 µM BrdU for 15 min (pulse labeling),
washed twice with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde
in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X100 for 10 min, washed twice with PBS and blocked in
0.2% fish skin gelatin (FSG) for 30 min. The cells were
then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (Beckton-Dickinson) or rat monoclonal anti-BrdU
antibody (Harlan Seralab) along with other desired primary antibodies against replication proteins (DNA Ligase
I, Dnmt1, PCNA) for 1 hr at 37°C. The primary antibodies
were diluted in buffer containing 0.2% FSG, 20 U/ml
DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.5 mM ßmercaptoethanol, 0.33 mM MgCl2, 33 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.1. The following primary antibodies were used in the various
experiments: rabbit anti-PATH52 (against Dnmt1) [1:
2000; [[37]]], mouse monoclonal anti-PCNA (1:1000
with methanol fixed cells, Clone PC10, Dako), rabbit
anti-PCNA (1:100, FL-261, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-DNA
Ligase I [1:250, [[5]]]. Fluorophore (FITC/Texas red/Cy5/
Alexa Fluor 568/Alexa Fluor 647) conjugated secondary
antibodies were used for detection. DNA was counterstained with Hoechst 33258 or TOPRO-3 and cells were
mounted in mowiol with 2.5% DABCO as an anti-fade
agent.
Microscopy and image analysis
Immunostained cells were examined on a Zeiss LSM 510
microscope with 63× or 100× NA 1.4 Plan-Apochromat
oil immersion objective with Nomarski optics. Ar-laser
(488, 514 nm), HeNe-laser 1 (543 nm) and HeNe-laser 2
(633 nm) were used to excite the fluorophores. Images
were acquired using the Zeiss LSM510 software and processed, assembled and annotated using Adobe Photoshop
and Adobe Illustrator.

Colocalization analyses were performed on raw images
after correcting for background using the JACoP plugin in
ImageJ [38]. The average size of replication foci was deter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/8/42

mined by measuring the diameter (in the xy plane) of 7–
10 RF per nuclei from 5 nuclei for each cell type using
ImageJ tools.
Search for DNA Ligase I homologue in Drosophila
DmDNA Ligase I cDNA was identified by searching the
Drosophila genome database and the EST database
(BDGP) [28] with DNA Ligase I sequences from different
organisms (mouse, human, yeast) as query using the
BLAST program [39]. The sequences obtained were
aligned pairwise using BLAST2 [40] for generating the
schematic of alignments shown in Figure 4A. Phylogenetic comparison of the human DNA Ligases and the
putative Drosophila Ligases were done using the JotunHein method [41] in the Lasergene program. The
DmDNA Ligase I cDNA clone (LD41868) was obtained
from ResGen. Multiple sequence alignments were generated using the Lasergene software.
