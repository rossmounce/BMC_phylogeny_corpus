Abstract
Background: In plants, HIR (Hypersensitive Induced Reaction) proteins, members of the PID (Proliferation, Ion and
Death) superfamily, have been shown to play a part in the development of spontaneous hypersensitive response
lesions in leaves, in reaction to pathogen attacks. The levels of HIR proteins were shown to correlate with localized
host cell deaths and defense responses in maize and barley. However, not much was known about the HIR
proteins in rice. Since rice is an important cereal crop consumed by more than 50% of the populations in Asia and
Africa, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of disease responses in this plant. We previously identified the
rice HIR1 (OsHIR1) as an interacting partner of the OsLRR1 (rice Leucine-Rich Repeat protein 1). Here we show that
OsHIR1 triggers hypersensitive cell death and its localization to the plasma membrane is enhanced by OsLRR1.
Result: Through electron microscopy studies using wild type rice plants, OsHIR1 was found to mainly localize to
the plasma membrane, with a minor portion localized to the tonoplast. Moreover, the plasma membrane
localization of OsHIR1 was enhanced in transgenic rice plants overexpressing its interacting protein partner,
OsLRR1. Co-localization of OsHIR1 and OsLRR1 to the plasma membrane was confirmed by double-labeling
electron microscopy. Pathogen inoculation studies using transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing either OsHIR1
or OsLRR1 showed that both transgenic lines exhibited increased resistance toward the bacterial pathogen
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. However, OsHIR1 transgenic plants produced more extensive
spontaneous hypersensitive response lesions and contained lower titers of the invading pathogen, when compared
to OsLRR1 transgenic plants.
Conclusion: The OsHIR1 protein is mainly localized to the plasma membrane, and its subcellular localization in that
compartment is enhanced by OsLRR1. The expression of OsHIR1 may sensitize the plant so that it is more prone to
HR and hence can react more promptly to limit the invading pathogens’ spread from the infection sites.

Background
In plants, there are no immune cells against invading pathogens. Nonetheless, they have evolved different strategies for
defense [1,2]. The current model depicts that plants can
recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
to trigger an immune response. If such a defense mechanism is compromised by effectors produced by the pathogens,
host plants that possess resistance proteins which can recognize the effectors will still be able to trigger an immune
response. Both PAMP-triggered and effector-triggered

immunities may result in hypersensitive response (HR),
which is characterized by the rapid and localized responses
that lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species, cell
wall fortification and a special form of programmed cell
death (PCD), also known as hypersensitive cell death [3-5].
PCD is an important mechanism of removing unwanted
cells in order to model or remodel newly-forming organs
[6-8]. Stress-induced PCD in both plant and animal cells
may involve the endomembrane system [9].
HR involves the expression of genes and the de novo
synthesis of proteins that are part of several defense
response signaling pathways [4,10,11]. HR-like lesions can
be induced in the absence of pathogens by overexpressing
defense-related genes [4,12-14]. These genes can be

categorized into 4 classes: pathogen-derived genes, genes
involved in defense signal transduction, killer genes, and
general metabolism-perturbing genes [13]. Furthermore,
plants exhibiting transgene-induced cell death are also
resistant to pathogen infection by activating the defense
signaling pathways [11,13].
Hypersensitive Induced Reaction (HIR) proteins are a
group of proteins involved in HR. They belong to the
PID (Proliferation, Ion and Death) superfamily, whose
members function in cell proliferation, ion channel regulation and cell death [15]. HIR protein expression in
maize and barley is associated with localized host cell
death and disease resistance responses [15,16]. Their
genes are up-regulated in plant leaves during the development of spontaneous HR lesions [15-17].
Rice is an important cereal that provides calories to
more than 50% of the Asian and African populations.
However, rice production has suffered from various
pathogenic attacks [1]. While HIR proteins from other
cereals have been shown to be involved in defense
responses [15,16], the information on the HIR proteins
in rice is very limited. We previously identified the rice
HIR1 (OsHIR1) as the interacting partner of the rice
Leucine-Rich Repeat protein 1 (OsLRR1) via yeast twohybrid and in vitro pull-down experiments [18]. OsLRR1
enters the endosomal pathway and its ectopic expression
in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana can enhance the host
resistance toward the virulent pathogen Pseudomonas
syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 [18].
In this study, we provide evidence to show that
OsLRR1 enhances the plasma membrane localization
of OsHIR1. We also demonstrate the involvement of
OsHIR1 in triggering hypersensitive cell death and plant
defense response using transgenic A. thaliana.

Results
OsHIR1 encodes a Band 7-domain protein which is upregulated upon pathogen challenge

OsHIR1 was identified as a putative interacting partner of
OsLRR1 [18]. The OsHIR1 protein exhibits high similarity (from 84% to 96% identity) to homologues from dicots
and monocots (Figure 1a), including maize (Zea mays)
[15], barley (Hordeum vulgare subsp. Vulgare) [16],
wheat (Triticum aestivum) [19], pepper (Capsicum spp.)
[20], and A. thaliana [21,22]. For all the close homologues of OsHIR1, computational analysis [23,24] reveals a
putative N-myristoylation site at the N-terminus, followed by a transmembrane domain that is embedded
within a Band 7-domain, which covers most of the
OsHIR1 protein (Figure 1b). In an unrooted phylogenetic
tree (Figure 1c), HIR proteins can be further divided into
two branches: dicots and monocots. Among HIR homologues from monocots, the OsHIR1 shares the highest
similarity with the maize ZmHIR1 (96% identity).

To show that OsHIR1 is related to the plant defense
response, we investigated whether its gene expression is
responsive to pathogen challenge. Northern and western
blot analyses showed that both the mRNA and protein
levels of OsHIR1 increased after the rice plant was
inoculated with the pathogen Xoo LN44 (Figure 1d). On
the other hand, no such change was observed after
mock treatment (Figure 1d).
Subcellular localization of OsHIR1 and the possible
interaction with OsLRR1

We previously reported that the OsHIR1 proteins were
retained in the membrane-associated protein fraction and
might be localized to the plasma membrane [18]. However, a more detailed electron microscopy analysis showed
that a minor portion of OsHIR1 signals could also be
found to the tonoplast (Figure 2a, lower left panel).
To study the possible effects of OsLRR1 on the subcellular localization of OsHIR1, we constructed transgenic rice
lines overexpressing OsLRR1. A transgenic line that exhibited a high level of OsLRR1 gene expression was chosen
for subsequent electron microscopy analysis (Figure 2b).
Interestingly, in addition to the elevated level of OsLRR1
mRNA, the expression of the OsHIR1 gene in the OsLRR1
transgenic line was also enhanced (Figure 2b).
Immuno-gold electron microscopy studies showed that
not only the signal density of the OsLRR1 proteins, but
also that of the OsHIR1 proteins, in the plasma membrane, was increased in the OsLRR1 overexpressing line by
at least two folds, when compared to the untransformed
control (Figure 2c). On the other hand, there was no significant difference (Student’s t-test, p < 0.05) between the
number of OsHIR1 signals in the tonoplast of the OsLRR1
overexpressing line and that in the untransformed control.
These results indicated that OsLRR1 enhanced the plasma
membrane localization of OsHIR1.
To further confirm the in vivo interaction between
OsHIR1 and OsLRR1 in the plasma membrane, a double
labeling experiment was performed using rabbit antiOsLRR1 antibodies and mouse anti-OsHIR1 antibodies.
Secondary antibodies conjugated with gold particles of
different sizes (6 nm anti-rabbit IgG and 15 nm antimouse IgG) were employed to distinguish between the
two target proteins. Proximal occurrences of large and
small gold particles were detected in the plasma membrane (Figure 2d), supporting the notion that OsLRR1
and OsHIR1 co-localized and interacted in the plasma
membrane.
Ectopic expression of the OsHIR1 can cause spontaneous
hypersensitive response lesions in the leaves of
transgenic A. thaliana

To perform a rapid gain-of-function test of OsHIR1,
transgenic A. thaliana plants ectopically expressing

OsHIR1 were generated. Three weeks after germination,
the leaves of about 20% of the OsHIR1 transgenic plants
(Col-0/OsHIR1) exhibited white spontaneous HR lesions
located randomly at the margins and tips (Figure 3a, red
arrows). As negative controls, the untransformed wild
type (Col-0) and transgenic plants with the empty vector
(Col-0/V7) exhibited normal growth. Transgenic plants
expressing OsLRR1 (Col-0/OsLRR1) did not exhibit visible differences in the size, shape, or color of the leaves,
when compared to the negative controls (Figure 3a).
To further observe the effect of OsHIR1 on cell death, lactophenol-trypan blue staining was performed using the
leaves of the transgenic A. thaliana. The expression of
OsHIR1 caused extensive spontaneous cell death (Figure 3b,
black arrows). On the other hand, the expression of
OsLRR1 only resulted in very mild spontaneous cell death
(Figure 3b). This explains the lack of visible lesions found in
OsLRR1 transgenic plants (Figure 3a). No spontaneous cell
death was observed in the untransformed control and transgenic plants containing the empty vector (Figure 3b).
Ectopic expression of OsHIR1 in transgenic A. thaliana
enhances resistance to P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000
(Pst DC3000)

Previous studies indicated that the ectopic expression of
OsLRR1, the interacting protein partner of OsHIR1, can
enhance resistance toward bacterial pathogens in transgenic A. thaliana [18]. Using a similar experimental

Page 5 of 10

approach, we tested the effects of OsHIR1 in A. thaliana
on the Pst DC3000-induced disease. Since OsHIR1 transgenic plants exhibiting extensive spontaneous HR
responses under normal growth conditions would eventually die, we chose those individual plants that exhibited
the mildest spontaneous HR responses for the subsequent
pathogen inoculation tests. The expression of OsHIR1 in
these plants was confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown).
When the untransformed wild type (Col-0) or A. thaliana transformed with the empty vector cassette (Col-0/
V7) was inoculated with the pathogen Pst DC3000, disease
symptoms (yellowing and necrosis) gradually appeared
and the infected areas spread out from the original inoculation sites (Figure 4a). Such symptoms were alleviated in
the transgenic line expressing OsLRR1, consistent with the
results of our previous study [18]. The spread of pathogen
infection was also suppressed by the ectopic expression of
OsHIR1 (Figure 4a). Consistent with these visible symptoms, transgenic plants expressing either OsLRR1 or
OsHIR1 exhibited a lower titer of pathogens when compared to Col-0 and the empty vector control (Figure 4b).
However, the OsHIR1 transgenic lines showed a stronger
effect on lowering the pathogen titer when compared to
the OsLRR1 transgenic line (Figure 4b).
The expression levels of PR1 and PR2, two defense
marker genes in the salicyclic acid pathway related to
the defense against biotrophic pathogens such as Pst
DC3000 [25], were monitored in both mock- (Figure 4c)

and pathogen-inoculated (Figure 4d) plants. In both
mock-treated and pathogen-inoculated plants, the
expression levels of PR1 and PR2 were elevated in both
OsHIR1 and OsLRR1 transgenic plants when compared
to Col-0 and transgenic plants containing the empty
vector cassette. However, the OsHIR1 transgenic plants
exhibited significantly higher levels of PR1 and PR2 gene
induction than the OsLRR1 transgenic plants (p < 0.05).

Discussion
OsHIR1 is a member of the Band 7-domain-containing
proteins (Figure 1). Many of these proteins are lipid

raft-associated and may cluster to form membrane
micro-domains, and in turn recruit multi-protein complexes functioning in membrane trafficking and signal
transduction [26]. Signaling components found in
plasma membrane lipid rafts may play important roles
in defense responses. For example, an E3 ubiquitin
ligase, RING1, is induced by pathogen infection, localizes to plasma membrane lipid rafts, and can trigger
programmed cell death in A. thaliana [27].
Here the membrane localization of OsHIR1 was confirmed with electron microscopy studies (Figure 2). We
also showed that OsHIR1 and OsLRR1 co-localized to

Zhou et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:290
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/290

the plasma membrane (Figure 2), possibly via lipid rafts.
This result further confirms the tight interaction
between OsHIR1 and OsLRR1 previously shown by
yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays [18].
Overexpressing OsLRR1 can induce the expression of
OsHIR1 gene and can increase the portion of OsHIR1
localized to the plasma membrane (Figure 2). Therefore,
it is likely that the function of OsHIR1 is regulated by
its interacting partner OsLRR1.
It is an interesting observation that a minor portion of
OsHIR1 is localized to the tonoplast (Figure 2).
Although it has not been explicitly discussed in previous
researches, proteomics studies have identified rice and
Arabidopsis HIR1 homologues in both the plasma membrane and vacuole protein fractions [21,22,28-31]. A
recent report showed that the vacuolar contents discharged and accumulated in the extracellular space
could induce hypersensitive cell death [32]. However,
the biological significance of the tonoplast localization
of OsHIR1 remains unclear at this point.
OsLRR1 is a positive signaling component of plant
defense responses [18]. The regulatory actions of
OsLRR1 on the expression and localization of OsHIR1
suggest that OsHIR1 may be downstream of OsLRR1 in
a defense response pathway. Previous studies of HIR1
homologues from maize, barley, and pepper indicated
that they are associated with HR and disease resistance
[15,16,20].
In transgenic A. thaliana ectopically expressing
OsHIR1, a portion of plants underwent uncontrolled
spontaneous HR (Figure 3) and eventually died. OsHIR1
transgenic plants with the mildest spontaneous HR phenotype could survive and were more resistant to the
bacterial pathogen Pst DC3000. The protective effects of
OsHIR1 included the alleviation of disease symptoms,
the lowering of pathogen titers, and the increased
expression of defense marker genes. Similar effects
could be obtained by expressing OsLRR1, the interacting
protein partner of OsHIR1 [18] (Figure 4). In general,
OsHIR1 showed a stronger enhancing effect on disease
resistance when compared to OsLRR1. In the native system, OsLRR1, which is trafficked in the endosomal
pathway, may participate in the surveillance of pathogen-related signals and then induce the production and
regulate the plasma membrane localization of OsHIR1.
It is likely that the protective function of OsLRR1 is at
least in part mediated through OsHIR1.

Conclusion
The OsHIR1 protein identified in rice is mainly localized
to the plasma membrane where it may co-localize and
interact with the OsLRR1 protein. The overexpression of
OsLRR1 can enhance the plasma membrane localization

of OsHIR1. Ectopic expression of either OsHIR1 or
OsLRR1 can cause spontaneous hypersensitive cell death
and increased resistance toward bacterial pathogens, with
OsHIR1 demonstrating a more pronounced effect than
OsLRR1. We speculate that the expression of OsHIR1
may sensitize the plant so that it is more prone to HR and
hence can react more promptly to restrict the spread of
the invading pathogens from the infection sites. OsLRR1
may act as a regulator for the functions of OsHIR1.

transformation of A. thaliana was done as described
previously [48]. T3 homozygous lines carrying a single
insertion locus were used in this study.

Plant growth and pathogen inoculation

Electron microscopy studies

Rice lines were grown on soil in a greenhouse under
natural sunlight for 4 to 5 weeks. Pathogen inoculations
were performed using Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae
(Xoo) race LN44 by a leaf-clipping method [34,40,41].
The same procedure was used for mock treatment
except that the pathogen was replaced with water. The
day 0 sample was collected before treatment. Other
samples were collected at 2, 4, and 6 days after treatment at around the same time of day (between 08:00
and 10:00 am).
For pathogen inoculation tests in A. thaliana, seedlings were first grown on Murashige & Skoog salt mixture agar plates for 2 weeks before being transferred to
Floragard potting soil and cultivated in a growth chamber (22-24°C; relative humidity 70-80%; light intensity
80-120 μE on a 16 h light-8 h dark cycle). Preparation
of the Pst DC3000 culture, inoculation (by syringe infiltration of 0.1 ml inoculums at a concentration of 106
colony-forming unit/ml in 10 mM MgSO4 supplemented with 0.02% (v/v) Silwet L-77), and subsequent
pathogen titer determination at 5 days post-inoculation
were performed as previously described [42]. For the
pathogen titer measurement, leaf discs were macerated
and extracted with 10 mM MgSO4, and the results were
obtained from plate counting [42]. Error bars are standard errors of the pathogen titer calculated from samples collected from 3 individual plants each consists of 3
leaf discs.

For single labeling experiments, the embedding, sectioning, and immunolabeling steps were performed as
described [18,49] using mouse anti-OsHIR1 serum or
rabbit anti-OsLRR1 serum [18]. All the sections were
captured by formvar-coated 100 mesh hex nickel grid
(Cat. No. G100H-Ni, Electron Microscopy Sciences).
The subcellular localization of targeted proteins were
subsequently detected by gold-labeled secondary antibodies (1:50 in 1% PBS-BSA) against mouse (EMS25173)
or rabbit (EMS25109) IgGs. Aqueous uranyl acetate/lead
citrate post-stained sections were examined with the
Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Background signals were monitored by
negative control experiments without the application of
the primary antibodies [18]. All images were captured at
regions showing clear plasma membrane and tonoplast,
with the magnification between 50,000× to 80,000×. At
least ten randomly selected areas (1-2 μm2) per section
were used for counting the density of immuno-goldlabeled dots (number of dots per μm 2 ) for statistical
analysis.
For double labeling experiments, tissues were collected
from the untransformed control. Sample preparation,
labeling, post-staining, and detection procedures were
the same as in single labeling experiments, except that
rabbit anti-OsLRR1 serum and mouse anti-OsHIR1
serum (both 1:50 in 1% PBS-BSA) were applied simultaneously to the sample grid to detect the target proteins.
Goat anti-rabbit IgG (6 nm gold particle: EMS 25104)
and goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (15 nm gold particle:
EMS 25173) were applied simultaneously to detect the
primary antibodies.

Transgenic plant construction

To construct transgenic rice lines overexpressing
OsLRR1, the full-length coding region of OsLRR1 was
subcloned into the binary vector pSB130 [43], using the
primer set 5’- CCGAATTCATGGGGGCGGGGGCG
CTG-3’ and 5’-CAGGTCGACGCTAGCAGTTGGTGTCATATACAG-3’. Constitutive expression was driven by
the Zea mays ubiquitin promoter [44]. The recombinant
construct was introduced into the japonica rice SN1033
via an Agrobacterium-mediated protocol [45,46] using
the A. tumefaciens strain EHA105.
Transgenic A. thaliana expressing OsLRR1 was from
our previous work [18]. To construct transgenic A.
thaliana expressing OsHIR1, a cDNA clone containing
the full-length coding region was inserted into a binary
vector (V7; [47]) and placed under the control of the
cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter using the primer
set 5’-AGTTCTAGAATGGGTCAAGCACTCGGTT
TGGTAC-3’ and 5’-AAAAATCTA GATTAGATCAA
TTTGGCCTGGAGCTG-3’. Agrobacterium-mediated

Western blot analysis

Total proteins were extracted [49] and electrophoretically separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4% stacking; 12.5% resolving) before being transferred to an
activated polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane
pre-treated with absolute methanol for 5 min followed
by protein transfer buffer for another 5 min, using the
Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot® Electrophoretic Transfer Cell
(170-3930; Bio-Rad). The blotting, blocking (with Western Breeze™ blocking solution), and detection (using the
Western Breeze™ Immunodetection Kit; WB7106, Invitrogen) procedures were performed according to the
manufacturer’s manuals.
Primary antibodies against the OsHIR1 protein [18]
were used. Anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated
to an alkaline phosphatase (provided in the Western

Lactophenol-trypan blue staining

Spontaneous cell death was detected using lactophenoltrypan blue staining as previously described [50].
Bioinformatics analysis

Alignment of amino acid sequences was done using the
ClustalW2 program http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/. The GenBank accession numbers of HIR1 homologues in this work are: rice OsHIR1 (accession no.
NM_001068279), barley HvHIR1 (accession no.
AY137511), wheat TaHIR1 (accession no. EF514209),
maize ZmHIR1 (accession no. NM_001112153), pepper
CaHIR1 (accession no. AY529867), and Arabidopsis
AtHIR1 (accession no. NM_125669). The putative Nmyristoylation site was predicted by ScanProsite [23]
and CSS-Palm 2.0 [24]. The putative transmembrane
domain was predicted by TopPred [51].
