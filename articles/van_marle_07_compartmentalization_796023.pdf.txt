Abstract
Background: Recently there has been an increasing interest and appreciation for the gut as both
a viral reservoir as well as an important host-pathogen interface in human immunodefiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1) infection. The gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the largest lymphoid organ
infected by HIV-1. In this study we examined if different HIV-1 quasispecies are found in different
parts of the gut of HIV-1 infected individuals.
Results: Gut biopsies (esophagus, stomach, duodenum and colorectum) were obtained from eight
HIV-1 infected preHAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) patients. HIV-1 Nef and Reverse
transcriptase (RT) encoding sequences were obtained through nested PCR amplification from
DNA isolated from the gut biopsy tissues. The PCR fragments were cloned and sequenced. The
resulting sequences were subjected to various phylogenetic analyses. Expression of the nef gene
and viral RNA in the different gut tissues was determined using real-time RT-PCR. Phylogenetic
analysis of the Nef protein-encoding region revealed compartmentalization of viral replication in
the gut within patients. Viral diversity in both the Nef and RT encoding region varied in different
parts of the gut. Moreover, increased nef gene expression (p < 0.05) and higher levels of viral
genome were observed in the colorectum (p < 0.05). These differences could reflect an adaptation
of HIV-1 to the various tissues.
Conclusion: Our results indicated that different HIV-1 quasispecies populate different parts of the
gut, and that viral replication in the gut is compartmentalized. These observations underscore the
importance of the gut as a host-pathogen interface in HIV-1 infection.

Introduction
Recently there has been an increasing interest and appreciation for the gut as a viral reservoir and an important
host-pathogen interface in human immunodefiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1) infection [1-4]. The gut associated lym-

phoid tissue (GALT) is the largest lymphoid organ
infected by HIV-1. Studies on simian immunodeficiency
virus (SIV) have indicated the gut is an important site for
CD4+ T-cell depletion [1,4], and this appears to be similar
in humans [5]. The inflammatory milieu in the gut is conPage 1 of 14

sidered to play a key role in CD4+ cell loss, as a lack of
CD4+ cell replenishment in the gut of HAART treated HIV1 infected individuals was associated with increased
inflammatory gene expression and immune activation
[2]. These observations have also led to the hypothesis
that HIV-1 may "hide" from antiretroviral therapy in the
gut [2]. This would be consistent with the notion that the
gut could act as a separate reservoir for viral replication
[6]. However, very little is known about the HIV-1 quasispecies that reside in the gut.
Viral variability significantly affects pathogenesis and
infection. Disease progression in HIV-1 infection is
accompanied by an increasing diversity in viral sequences
found within the infected individual [7]. HIV-1 is highly
divergent due to the error-prone reverse transcription step
in the HIV-1 life cycle [8]. Factors such as viral fitness,
availability of target cells for infection, antiretroviral therapy, duration of infection and the host immune response
influence which viral quasispecies arise during the course
of infection [9-13]. For both SIV and HIV-1 it has been
suggested that the immune system can push viral evolution towards HIV-1 quasispecies with increased pathogenic properties [7,14-17]. In HIV/AIDS patients on
antiretroviral therapy, viral sequences evolved over time
in genes not targeted by the drugs, despite undetectable
plasma viral loads [18-20]. These observations suggested
that viral replication continued in tissues or cell compartments not efficiently targeted by the antiretroviral drugs.
The contribution of the gut to increasing viral diversity in
the host is unresolved. In addition, it is unclear to what
extent viral replication in the gut is compartmentalized.
The distribution and composition of the lymphoid tissues
vary amongst different locations in the gut. For instance,
lymphocytes in the small intestine can be found in organized structures, so-called Peyer's patches, but are also
found in the lamina propria and as intraepithelial lymphocytes throughout the gut (reviewed in [21]). The
Peyer's patches are found in the duodenum, but their frequency increases further down the small intestine, with
the largest number present in the ileum (reviewed in
[22]). In humans, lymphocytes in the large intestine (i.e.
cecum, colon and rectum) are found as isolated lymphoid
follicles, with the highest frequency in the rectum [23,24].
The distribution of the type of T-cells in the GALT is different than the periphery, as 70% of the intraepithial lymphocytes in the small intestine are CD8+ T-cells [25].
Moreover, throughout the intestine the majority of CD4+
T-cells are CCR5 positive [26]. Therefore, the different
parts of the gut could select for different HIV-1 quasispecies, and thus act as reservoirs for different viral strains.
The goal of the current study was to determine if viral replication in the gut is compartmentalized. We analyzed
HIV-1 sequences of the Nef (negative factor) and the

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/87

reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding region amplified by
PCR from biopsy material taken from different locations
within the gut of HIV-1 infected individuals. These analyses demonstrated that for both RT and the Nef encoding
region viral diversity differed significantly among the various gut tissues, and phylogenetic analyses clearly demonstrated clustering of nef DNA sequences at different sites.
Furthermore, our observations suggested compartmentalization of HIV-1 replication in different parts of the gut,
and indicated that the gut is a distinct multi-compartment
viral reservoir in HIV-1 infected individuals.

Results
Clustering of HIV-1 nef sequences by gut tissue
compartment
To get insight into potential compartmentalization of
HIV-1 replication at different locations within the gut, we
focused on analyzing the Nef and RT encoding regions of
HIV-1. These regions were amplified by nested PCR from
DNA isolated from different gut tissues (esophagus, stomach, duodenum and colorectum) and peripheral blood
lymphocytes (PBL). The samples were obtained from a
previously described cohort of HIV seropositive homosexual men followed at the Southern Alberta Clinic (SAC),
Calgary, Alberta, from 1993 to 1996 [6,27]. This cohort
was recruited prior to the introduction of HAART (Highly
Active Antiretroviral therapy) at the SAC in late 1997.
Eight patients at various clinical stages of HIV infection/
AIDS were selected and gut tissue samples from one visit
were analyzed (Table 1). Although cDNA was synthesized
and viral sequences could be detected with our real-time
RT-PCR analysis using small amplicons (discussed in sections below), the sequences spanning the entire viral
regions of interest were the most readily and consistently
amplified from DNA. Therefore, we focused on these proviral sequences for the current study. Analysis of these
sequences also exploits the "banking-effect" of proviral
DNA in the chromosomal DNA of different cell populations offering some insight into "the history" of the infection [28] and seeding of the gut tissues. We chose to

HIV-1 viral sequences were amplified from PBL and
biopsy tissue DNA using our nested PCR protocol. For
seven patients RT and Nef encoding sequences were
obtained from 3 or more tissues (gut tissues and/or PBL),
while for one patient (#8) only sequences from two tissues could be obtained (stomach and esophagus). Neighbour-Joining trees revealed clustering of the nef sequences
by individual patient (bootstrap values of >90) (Fig. 1).
The clones of the Nef encoding sequences also clustered
by gut tissue from which they were obtained (i.e. esopha-

analyze the HIV-1 Nef and RT protein encoding sequences
as these proteins have various effects on viral replication
and the RT region has been shown to evolve by tissue
compartment [8,29-31]. Both proteins are targeted by the
cellular immune response [32-34], and therefore suitable
targets to determine how HIV-1 evolves in different parts
of the gut. The Nef protein is highly variable [32], but is
relatively more conserved than the highly diverse envelope protein [35], which could make it easier to detect
phylogenetic relationships within the patient population.
Finally, the Nef protein has been implicated as an important pathogenic determinant of HIV-1 [36-47], and its

Nef sequence by tissue compartment (esophagus (E), stomach (S), duodenum (D), colorectum (C) and PBL) within patients,
indicative of compartmentalization of viral replication in the gut, resulting in the evolution of different HIV-1 quasispecies in different parts of the gut. (Bootstrap values > 70 are indicated.)

gus, stomach, duodenum and colorectum). No mixed
clustering with sequences of different tissues was
observed, indicating that within a patient distinct HIV-1
quasispecies were found within different parts of the gut.
Analysis of the clustering pattern for the patients for
which we were able to obtain viral sequences from PBL
revealed clustering of these sequences with each other
(bootstrap value >90) (Fig. 1). This indicated that the viral
quasispecies found in the periphery were different from
those found in the gut. No obvious phylogenetic relation-

ship of PBL sequences with sequences of a particular gut
tissue (i.e. esophagus, stomach, duodenum or colon) was
observed among the different patients. In contrast to the
Nef encoding region, similar tight clustering for the RT
encoding region was not found for any of the patients
(Fig. 2). However, for various patients a large number of
the RT encoding sequences from the esophagus and stomach clustered together. The latter could suggest that there
may be a selection for a particular RT encoding sequence
in these tissues among patients.

To corroborate our observations, the sequences from all
clones for the Nef and the RT encoding region were used
to derive consensus sequences for each tissue compartment for each patient. Bootstrap analysis of these consensus sequences revealed clustering of nef sequences by

A

patient, and for two patients by upper (esophagus and
stomach) and lower (duodenum and colorectum) gut tissue compartment (Fig. 3A) (bootstrap value >90). This
suggested a clustering of nef sequences by upper or lower
GI-tract in select patients. Similar to our previous results,

sequences obtained (Fig. 4) did not reveal any particular
signature sequences for specific gut tissues. Taken

together, these observations indicated that viral replication in the gut was compartmentalized, resulting in different HIV-1 quasispecies populating different parts of the
gut.

HIV-1 diversity in different gut tissues
To determine to what extent viral diversity differed among
the different gut tissues, the mean total (d), and nonsynonymous (dN) pair-wise distances were calculated for the
Nef and RT encoding sequences obtained from the
esophagus, stomach, duodenum and colorectum tissues
of all patients (Fig. 5). Significantly lower d and dN values

A

(i.e. codon/amino acid changing substitutions) were
observed for the RT encoding region for both the esophagus and the duodenum, compared to the stomach and
colorectum (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). In contrast, for the Nef encoding region, a significantly higher d
value was observed in both duodenum and colorectum (p
< 0.05). Further analysis of the Nef encoding region

Figure 5
Viral molecular diversity of the Nef encoding region in gut tissues of HIV-1 patients
Viral molecular diversity of the Nef encoding region in gut tissues of HIV-1 patients. Viral Nef sequences were
more diverse (higher mean total distance (d)) for the duodenum and colon compared to the stomach and esophagus (A).
Moreover, viral evolution tended towards a more diverse Nef protein in the colorectum as reflected by a significantly higher
mean total non-synonomous distance (dN, i.e. amino acid changing mutations) (B). A similar analysis of the RT coding region of
HIV-1, also revealed significant differences in viral molecular diversity in the different tissues for both mean total distance (d)
(C) and non-synonomous distance (dN) (D). These observations indicated that different selection pressures were acting in different parts of the gut depending on the viral region. (* = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01 ***, = p < 0.001, Dunn's multiple comparison

revealed a higher dN value in the colorectum (p < 0.05),
suggestive of a more diverse Nef protein in the colorectum. Similar to the analysis of the consensus Nef protein
sequences (Fig. 4), analysis of all the inferred protein
sequences for both the Nef and RT protein obtained from
the different patients did not reveal any signature
sequences for any of the tissue compartments, nor were
there any obvious differences in domains important for
protein function [36-39,48-50](data not shown).
Increased viral replication and nef gene expression in the
colorectum of HIV-1 infected patients
The differences in viral diversity suggested that HIV-1
evolved to varying degrees in the different gut tissues. A
previous report observed differences in viral loads
between blood and colorectum [51], indicative of differences in viral growth between these compartments. To
extend the observations obtained with our phylogenetic
analysis, we used real-time RT-PCR to determine the relative levels of viral genomic RNA in our patients in esophagus, stomach, duodenum and colorectum (Fig. 6A). The
fold increase in transcript levels was expressed relative to
the levels observed in the esophagus, since in all patients
we found the lowest level of transcript in this tissue. Significantly higher levels of viral genomic RNA in the colorectum compared to esophagus were observed in the 8
patients analyzed in this study (p < 0.05), suggesting HIV1 replication differs in different parts of the gut. Finally, as
our results indicated a more diverse Nef protein in the
colorectum, we used real-time RT-PCR to analyze the
expression of all HIV-1 RNA transcripts (genomic and
mRNAs) containing the Nef protein open reading frame
(Fig. 6B), as well as nef gene specific mRNA transcripts
[52](Fig. 6C) in the different gut tissues. Indeed, an
increased expression of viral mRNA and nef gene specific
mRNA transcripts (p < 0.05) was observed among all
patients in the colorectum.

Discussion
The current study clearly indicated that different genes of
HIV-1 evolved differently in different parts of the gut. Previous studies have shown that HIV-1 quasispecies found
within a patient in the colorectum were different from
those found in blood and brain [29,53], suggesting that
gut is a separate evolving compartment for HIV-1 replication. To our knowledge our study is the first demonstration that HIV-1 replication in the gut is in itself further
compartmentalized. Distinct viral quasispecies were
found in the esophagus, stomach, duodenum and colorectum that were different from those found in the periphery (PBL). The data also indicated that viral replication
and viral nef gene expression, varied across the gut tissues.
The results obtained for the Nef protein encoding region
in our cohort is the most convincing evidence of compartmentalization of HIV-1 replication, resulting in the evolu-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/87

tion of different HIV-1 quasispecies in different parts of
the gut.
Varying viral diversity was observed for both the Nef and
the reverse transciptase (RT) encoding region in the gut.
Both regions are primarily targeted by the cellular
immune response, which will significantly impact viral
quasispecies evolution [32-34]. However, their role in
determining viral replication and infectivity could also
shape viral evolution in these different gut tissue compartments [8,29-31]. The RT region did not exhibit the same
pattern of clearly defined clustering that was observed for
the Nef encoding region. As the RT region is highly conserved due to its importance in viral replication, distinct
clustering would be less likely to be picked up in these
phylogenetic analyses due to high levels of sequence
homology. However, despite the lack of clustering of the
RT region, we did observe a consistent clustering pattern
of a large number of stomach and esophagus derived
sequences from different patients. This could suggest that
there are particular requirements for the RT protein for the
infection of the esophageal and stomach tissues, but we
did not observe distinct RT protein sequence motifs. Alternatively, the immune system could have selected for specific RT protein sequences in these tissues. This is
consistent with compartmentalization of the infection of
the gut by HIV-1, and again illustrated that the RT is under
different selection pressures compared to the Nef encoding region.
Of particular interest was the more diverse nef gene in the
colorectum among the patients. Differences in immune
selection pressures in the colorectum could push viral
evolution towards more diverse nef sequences. The Nef
protein plays a role in determining HIV-1 infectivity and
viral replication [30,31]. The observed differences could
reflect different adaptation of HIV-1 to the colorectal tissues, which may explain the higher viral RNA and the
increased nef gene expression in the colorectum, further
supporting compartmentalization of HIV-1 replication in
the gut. Alternatively, the differences in viral replication in
the different gut tissues could be the result of different levels of infection due to differences in the amount of infectable cells (i.e. CD4+ cells) in those tissues, or differences in
the amount of viral RNA produced by each infected cell.
In turn, the elevated viral replication could result in higher
viral diversity in the colorectum due to increased error
prone replication. Of note, in the brain all these factors
not only affect viral evolution and compartmentalization
of viral replication, but also play an important role in
pathogenesis (reviewed in [54]).
The patients analyzed in the current study were primarily
chosen based on their HIV/AIDS status and not selected
on any other common pathological features. In addition,

as our sequences were derived from DNA, we did not sample the viruses that were actively replicating and responsible for pathogenesis in the different tissues. This may
explain why we did not find any clear differences in
sequence motifs in the Nef protein that could be linked to
viral pathogenesis or altered protein function [36-39].
Alternatively, the lack of common features among the Nef
protein sequences may be due to the fact that in specific
patients the Nef protein may play a major role in pathogenesis, while in others it may not. More patients will
need to be analyzed to address this question. Nonetheless,
our results clearly indicated that different HIV-1 strains
end up in the different tissues. This could be the result of
particular tissue requirements for HIV-1, immune selection, as well as the earlier mentioned differences in the
number of HIV-1 infectable cells in these tissues. The latter may also be reflected by the clustering of Nef protein
encoding sequences by upper and lower GI tissues in
some of the patients. The immune response and the cells
of the upper or lower GI tissues may have distinct features
in common, thereby selecting for more related HIV-1 varieties. However, as we only observed this clearly in two of
the patients analyzed, this may not be a common feature.
Again, the implications of these observations for HIV-1
pathogenesis remain to be determined.
Despite the fact we did not find direct links to pathogenesis in our analyses, the clustering and differing viral diversity of the Nef protein encoding sequences is of interest.
The Nef protein plays many roles in pathogenesis, which
is underscored by the observation that deletions in the nef
gene, rendering the protein nonfunctional, have been
associated with long-term non-progression or absence of
HIV-1 associated neurological disease [40-47]. Indeed,
the Nef protein has many cytotoxic properties[37-39,5561]. It has both apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities,
and also has various effects on the infected cell (reviewed
in [47,55-57]). The Nef protein also has proinflammatory
actions and its expression results in the induction of
cytokines and chemokines, which is affected by the Nef
protein sequence [62-64]. Given the important pathogenic role proposed for gut mucosal inflammation in
CD4+ cell depletion, [1,2,4,5], our observations may also
point to a pathogenic role for the Nef protein in the gut.
This notion is strengthened by previous observations in
HIV/AIDS patients with neurological disease in which
increased viral diversity in blood and brain was associated
with neurological impairment [14]. The reverse is also
true, and we have shown that for the Nef encoding region,
viral evolution tended towards a more conserved and possible more pathogenic Nef protein in the brain [62]. These
and other observations indicate that host-dependent
selection pressures can push viral evolution towards viral
strains with a more pathogenic phenotype, which is relevant for both systemic and organ specific pathogenesis

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/87

[7,14-16]. The increased viral diversity of the Nef protein
encoding region in the colorectum may be the result of
increased viral replication. This could increase the chance
of pathogenic HIV-1 strains evolving in this part of the
gut. Further studies involving patients categorized by
pathology will be required to determine to what extent
this plays a role in HIV-1 pathogenesis, and are currently
ongoing in the laboratory.
Finally, it has been proposed that HIV-1 can "hide" in the
gut from antiretroviral therapy [2]. It is also possible that
the gut could act as a reservoir for pathogenic viral strains
that are not easily identified in the periphery, in that
respect acting as a "hide out". Our results showed that different HIV-1 quasispecies were found in the gut tissues
that differed from those found in the PBL within each
patient, which would be consistent with this notion.
However, analysis of multiple viral regions of the actively
replicating viruses in the different tissues over multiple
visits will be necessary. These studies will allow us to
determine how the gut is seeded, and if the different gut
tissues not only act as "hide-outs" for HIV-1 drug resistant
strains, but also as reservoirs for pathogenic viral strains.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our observations indicate that the different
parts of gut act as distinct compartments for HIV-1 replication containing different HIV-1 quasispecies. These
results suggest that the gut could contribute to overall viral
diversity. Together with the important role the gut plays as
host-pathogen interface in the development of AIDS, this
has major implications for treatment of this devastating
disease. The complex nature of the gut viral reservoirs has
to be taken into account when designing therapeutic
approaches, as the gut may be a sanctuary site for drug
resistant strains or a source of pathogenic HIV-1 strains.

Materials and methods
Patients
Patients were enrolled from a previously described cohort
of HIV seropositive homosexual men followed at the
Southern Alberta Clinic (SAC), Calgary, Alberta, from
1993 to 1996 [6,27]. This study was reviewed and
approved by the Office of Medical Bioethics of the University of Calgary and all patients signed an informed consent at enrollment. Patients were prospectively followed
and laboratory testing included plasma viral load and
CD4 counts, for each patient during each visit. In addition
upper and lower endoscopies were performed in order to
harvest tissue for further testing. This cohort was recruited
prior to the introduction of HAART (Highly Active
Antiretroviral therapy) at the SAC in late 1997. Antiviral
therapies during the study consisted of no treatment,
monotreatments with AZT, DDI, DDC, D4T, and 3TC or
combinations thereof.

Gut biopsy samples
Gastrointestinal tract biopsies were taken during the study
period at the level of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum
and colorectum. The biopsies taken via endoscopic procedure were shipped cryopreserved and stored at -70°C,
within 1 hour of collection [6]. Plasma or serum was collected and stored at -70°C and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated and stored in liquid
nitrogen[6,27]. Eight patients at various clinical stages of
HIV infection/AIDS were selected. All patients had a CD4
count of lower than 400 at the time of biopsy (Table 1).
Nucleic acid sequence analyses were performed on the gut
biopsies taken at one visit for this subset of patients.
Nucleic acid isolation and PCR amplification of viral
sequence from PBL and gut biopsies
Chromosomal DNA was isolated from the tissue biopsies
from each patient using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON). The HIV-1 proviral DNA regions encoding
the Nef (negative factor) and RT (reverse transcriptase)
protein were amplified using a nested PCR and 0.2 μg of
chromosomal DNA as template. The nested PCR protocol
for both the first and second round PCR, consisted of an
initial denaturation step of 5 min at 94°C, 45 cycles of 1
min at 95°C, 1 min at the annealing temperature of the
primer set used, 2 min at 72°C, followed by a final extension step of 10 min at 72°C. For the nef region, the primers used for the first round PCR were NEF8678F 5'-GTA
GCT GAG GGG ACA GAT AG-3' and NEF9540R 5'-AGG
CTC AGA TCT GGT GTA AC-3' (Tm = 50°C), and for the
second round NEF8748F 5'-GAA GAA TAA GAC AGG
GCT-3' and NEF9425R 5'-AGT CCC CAG CGG AAA GTC
CC-3' (Tm = 40°C) [62]. For the RT region, the first round
primers consisted of RT2470 5'-GTA CAG TAT TAG GAC
CTA CAC CTG-3' and RT3261 5'-ATC AGG ATG GAG TTC
ATA ACC CAT CCA-3' (Tm = 55°C), and for the second
round consisted of RT2604 5'-CCA AAA GTT AAA CAA
TGG CCA TTG ACA-3' and RT3251 5'-AGT TCA TAA CCC
ATC CAA AG-3' (Tm = 55°C). All viral sequences were
amplified using pfu polymerase to reduce introduction of
mutations during amplification. In addition, dilution
experiments of the template were performed to prevent
selective amplification of the most dominant viral
sequences at the expense of less frequent viral sequences,
and thus skewing sampling of the viral quasispecies. For
these experiments, 2 to 10 fold dilutions of the template
DNA were made. The dilutions at which still an abundant
PCR product could be obtained were used for our
sequence analysis.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
The resulting Nef and RT encoding PCR fragments were
isolated from gel using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit
(Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, ON) and directly sequenced to
obtain overall consensus sequences for the different tissue

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/87

compartments. In addition, the gel purified PCR fragment
were cloned by filling in the incomplete fragment ends
with Klenow, phosphorylation using T4 polynucleotide
kinase, and insertion into the EcoRV site of pSL1180. All
enzymes were obtained from Invitrogen (Burlington, ON)
and New England Biolabs (Pickering, ON) and used
according to the manufacturer's specifications. Where
possible up to five to ten clones per patient/sample were
analyzed to determine the composition of the viral quasispecies for the Nef and RT encoding region. DNA
sequences were determined by automated sequencing on
an ABI sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Streetsville, ON)
and a Li-Cor 4300 DNA Analysis sequencing system (Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) according to the manufacturers' protocols and reagents. All sequences have been
submitted to Genbank (accession numbers EF656787 to
EF657121)
The inferred amino acid sequence for each cloned nucleic
acid fragment was obtained for each sample. These protein sequences were screened for the integrity of the coding sequences (i.e. stop codons, deletions and/or
insertions), as well as common amino acid motifs
between the different patients and samples. In addition,
changes in amino acid residues or motifs that have been
shown to be important for function of the Nef and RT protein were analyzed [36-39,48-50]. The nucleic acid
sequences were subjected to an extensive phylogenetic
analysis, using the MEGA version 3.1 software package
[65]. Neighbor-Joining trees were constructed using the
Kimura-2-parameter model with 5000 replicates for the
bootstrap analysis. Bootstrap values of >70 were considered significant. Reference sequences of prototypic HIV
isolates were included to rule out possible contamination
with laboratory strains. The MEGA software was also used
to calculate mean total (d), nonsynonymous (dN, i.e.
codon changing substitutions) and synonymous (dS, i.e.
non-codon changing substitutions) distances for the
nucleic acid sequences from all patient and tissue compartments as well as for individual tissue samples. All distances and phylogenetic analyses were performed through
pair-wise comparison and pair-wise gap stripping of each
sequence.
Real-time PCR analysis of viral genome and nef gene
expression in the gut tissues
Total RNA was isolated from the gut tissues using Trizol
(Life Technologies, Burlington ON) and used as template
for the synthesis of cDNA using a previous described protocol [62,66]. Real-time quantitative PCR using this cDNA
and the iCycler IQ system (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Canada)
was performed as follows. The cDNA was diluted 1/1 with
water, and 5 μl was used per PCR reaction. Each 25 μl reaction contained 5 μl of cDNA, 11.5 μl of Supermix (BioRad), 6.5 μl of SYBR-Green (1/50,000 dilution; Bio-Rad),

1 μl of fluorescein (1/10,000; Bio-Rad), and 1 μl of primer
mix. The amplification protocol consisted of an initial
denaturation step of 3 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles
of 95°C for 30 s, 30 s at the annealing temperature (Tm)
of the primers, and 72°C for 30 s, and a final elongation
step of 72°C for 1 min. The amplicons were subjected to
a melt curve analysis to ensure proper amplification, in
which the temperature was raised from 65 to 99°C in 1°C
increments, and data acquired for 8 s at each temperature
increment. The viral genome, nef containing RNA, and nef
mRNA levels were normalized against GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and expressed as
relative fold change compared to the RNA levels in the
esophagus. All real-time RT-PCR quantifications were performed in duplicate and repeated with two different
batches of cDNA. The primers used were: nef Forward
