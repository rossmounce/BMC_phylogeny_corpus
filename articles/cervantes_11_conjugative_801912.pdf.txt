Abstract
Background: Bean-nodulating Rhizobium etli originated in Mesoamerica, while soybean-nodulating Sinorhizobium
fredii evolved in East Asia. S. fredii strains, such as GR64, have been isolated from bean nodules in Spain, suggesting
the occurrence of conjugative transfer events between introduced and native strains. In R. etli CFN42, transfer of
the symbiotic plasmid (pRet42d) requires cointegration with the endogenous self-transmissible plasmid pRet42a.
Aiming at further understanding the generation of diversity among bean nodulating strains, we analyzed the
plasmids of S. fredii GR64: pSfr64a and pSfr64b (symbiotic plasmid).
Results: The conjugative transfer of the plasmids of strain GR64 was analyzed. Plasmid pSfr64a was self-transmissible,
and required for transfer of the symbiotic plasmid. We sequenced pSfr64a, finding 166 ORFs. pSfr64a showed three
large segments of different evolutionary origins; the first one presented 38 ORFs that were highly similar to genes
located on the chromosome of Sinorhizobium strain NGR234; the second one harbored 51 ORFs with highest similarity
to genes from pRet42d, including the replication, but not the symbiosis genes. Accordingly, pSfr64a was incompatible
with the R. etli CFN42 symbiotic plasmid, but did not contribute to symbiosis. The third segment contained 36 ORFs
with highest similarity to genes localized on pRet42a, 20 of them involved in conjugative transfer. Plasmid pRet42a was
unable to substitute pSfr64a for induction of pSym transfer, and its own transfer was significantly diminished in GR64
background. The symbiotic plasmid pSfr64b was found to differ from typical R. etli symbiotic plasmids.
Conclusions: S. fredii GR64 contains a chimeric transmissible plasmid, with segments from two R. etli plasmids and a S.
fredii chromosome, and a symbiotic plasmid different from the one usually found in R. etli bv phaseoli. We infer that
these plasmids originated through the transfer of a symbiotic-conjugative-plasmid cointegrate from R. etli to a S. fredii
strain, and at least two recombination events among the R. etli plasmids and the S. fredii genome. As in R. etli CFN42,
the S. fredii GR64 transmissible plasmid is required for the conjugative transfer of the symbiotic plasmid. In spite of the
similarity in the conjugation related genes, the transfer process of these plasmids shows a host-specific behaviour.

Background

of them are able to establish a symbiotic relationship

formation of nodules, where bacteria differentiate into
nitrogen fixing bacteroids [1]. The genomes of these
bacteria contain a circular chromosome. Some, like
Agrobacterium tumefaciens, also contain a linear chromosome, in addition to a variable number of plasmids,
which may carry up to 50% of the genomic sequence.
The bacterial genetic information required for the establishment of the symbiosis is usually localized on large
plasmids, or in genomic islands [2].

Conjugative transfer is thought to be the most relevant
mechanism that contributes to the dissemination and
diversification of genetic information, particularly that
localized on plasmids. Conjugation systems are constituted
by a DNA transfer and replication (Dtr) component,
encoded by tra genes and a cis-acting oriT site, and a
mating pair formation (Mpf) component, encoded by trb
genes [3]. Information on the conjugative transfer
mechanisms of rhizobial plasmids is still scarce. However,
two groups of plasmids containing a functional set of conjugative transfer genes have been described: Type I, which
are regulated by quorum-sensing [3-5], and Type II, which
have permanently RctA-repressed transfer genes [3,6].
A third type of conjugative plasmids has been recently
proposed, represented by the largest plasmids of R. leguminosarum bv viciae strains [3]. Some plasmids are mobilizable in the presence of transmissible plasmids, either by
cointegration (conduction) [7], or by classical (trans)
helper mechanisms [8,9]. Specifically in the bean nodulating type strain Rhizobium etli CFN42, we have previously
shown that it contains a quorum-sensing regulated selftransmissible plasmid (pRet42a) [5], and that transfer of
the symbiotic plasmid (pRet42d) occurs only in the presence of pRet42a. The event requires cointegration of both
replicons. This may be achieved through IntA-dependent
site-specific recombination between attA and attD sites,
or through RecA-dependent homologous recombination
among large sequence segments shared between the replicons. The cointegrate is able to transfer, using the
pRet42a-encoded machinery. In the transconjugants, the
cointegrate is usually resolved to regenerate the wild-type
plasmids, but in a few cases, resolution of the cointegrate
leads to the formation of recombinant plasmids that contain segments of each plasmid, pRet42a and pRet42d [7].
Mesoamerica has been identified as the place of origin of
bean plants and Rhizobium etli bacteria [10], while soybean and its nodulating bacteria (Sinorhizobium fredii) originated in East Asia [11]. In the early XVI th century,
common beans and their symbionts were transported to
Europe and other parts of the world. A survey of beannodulating strains in Granada, Spain, showed the presence
of strains belonging to five different species: R. etli, R. gallicum, R. giardinii, R. leguminosarum and S. fredii [12].
The usual host of Sinorhizobium fredii strains is soybean
(Glycine soja), not common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris).
Nevertheless, the bean-nodulating strains classified as
S. fredii, were unable to nodulate cvs. Williams or Peking
of Glycine max. Hybridization of digested genomic DNA
with nodB and nifH genes from R. etli, showed a very
weak signal [12]. R. etli bv phaseoli symbiotic plasmids
(pSyms) are characterized by the presence of three copies
of nifH. The bean-nodulating S. fredii strains showed only
one copy of this gene [12]. While conjugative transfer may
explain the acquisition of new symbiotic features by strains

belonging to diverse species, the relationship between
R. etli and bean-nodulating S. fredii is not so easily established. In order to gain further insight into the mechanisms and pathways leading to the generation of new
rhizobial strains, in this work we present the analysis of
the bean-nodulating S. fredii strain GR64, isolated from
the soil in Granada. The results indicate that the plasmids
present in GR64 likely derived from conjugative transfer
and rearrangement events among sequences localized in at
least three different replicons, including two different plasmids and a chromosome.

Results
Plasmid pSfr64b is required for symbiosis but pSfr64a is
dispensable

Strain GR64 contains two plasmids: pSfr64a (183 kb) and
pSfr64b (~400 kb) (Figure 1A, Table 1). A band corresponding to a megaplasmid (~1300 kb), has been visualized [13], but is not always clearly apparent in the gels.
Plasmid pSfr64b was identified as the symbiotic plasmid
[13], because it hybridizes with the nifH gene. Nodulation
assays confirmed that the genetic information in pSfr64b
is necessary and sufficient to establish symbiosis. Table 2
shows that all derivatives carrying pSfr64b, were able to
form nodules (GR64, CFN2001-1, GMI9023/pSfr64b),
and that the construct lacking pSfr64b (GR64-4) was
unable to nodulate beans. Consistent with previous findings [14,15], the number of nodules was decreased in an
Agrobacterium genomic background. On the other hand,
lack of pSfr64a had no effect on the symbiotic process
(GR64-2), and its presence in Agrobacterium did not confer nodulation capacity to the receptor, indicating that
pSfr64a encodes none of the essential symbiotic genes.
Plasmid pSfr64a shares sequences with the R. etli pSym,
pRet42a, and with the chromosome of Sinorhizobium
fredii NGR234

We sequenced plasmid pSfr64a (GenBank accession number: CP002245). The main features of this plasmid are
shown in Figure 2 and Additional File 1. Plasmid pSfr64a
is 183 612 bp long. The genetic organization of this plasmid clearly reveals its chimeric nature, since 38 (23%) of
the 166 ORFs encoded in the plasmid presented highest
similarity to sequences of the chromosome of Sinorhizobium fredii NGR234, while 87 (52%) were most similar to
ORFs encoded in R. etli CFN42 plasmids pRet42a (36
ORFs, 22%) and pRet42d (51 ORFs, 31%).
The functional assignment of the 166 ORFs (Figure 2,
Table 3) shows that the plasmid is largely involved in
metabolic, transport and conjugative functions.
Among the ORFs shared between pSfr64a and pRet42a,
the self-transmissible plasmid of CFN42, most are related
to conjugative transfer (20 ORFs), only two were ascribed
to macromolecular metabolism. Interestingly, both are

related to DNA metabolism, one was classified as a putative nuclease, and the other as a probable DNA methylase. In Figure 3, it can be appreciated that the genomic
region shared between pRet42a and pSfr64a is markedly
colinear. Colinearity is disrupted by the absence of an
homolog to the regulatory gene cinR of pRet42a, and the
presence of pSfr64a ORFs 147 and 148, which encode
hypothetical proteins. The correspondence between
pSfr64a and pRetCFN42 ORFs is presented in Additional
File 1. Figure 2 shows that the segment of pSfr64a shared
with pRet42a has a high GC content, compared to the
rest of the plasmid. This feature is also present in the
similar pRet42a sequence.
The ORFs similar to the pSym of CFN42 (pRet42d)
include the repABC genes (Figure 2, Table 3). This is
congruent with our finding that pSfr64a and pRet42d

are incompatible (data not shown). The pSfr64apRet42d-shared ORFs are mainly involved in small
molecule metabolism (26 ORFs), and carbohydrate
transport (13 ORFs). It is noteworthy that, in spite of
the fact that pRet42d carries genes engaged in symbiotic
functions, none of these are present in pSfr64a.
Within the region similar to pRet42d (ORFs 46 to
110), the colinearity is restricted to small segments,
some of them in inverse orientation. (Figure 3, Additional file 1). The repABC genes (pSfr64a ORFs 164 to
166) were adjacent to the transfer region, separated
from the other pRet42d genes. It has been amply documented that plasmid pRet42d is subject to frequent
genomic rearrangements, due to the presence of reiterations and a high density of insertion sequences [16-20].
R. etli ORFs encoding transposon-related proteins
located near to the sites where colinearity is disrupted
are indicated in Figure 2 (purple arrows) and Additional
File 1. For example, pSfr64a ORFs 122 to 146 are
colinear with pRet42a ORFs 139 to 162. The adjacent
ORF on pRet42a (ORF 138) encodes a transposonrelated protein. It is possible that these sequences are
related to the generation of rearrangements, causing the
interruptions in colinearity. ORFs 114, 115, 116, 117,
118 and 121 show homology to ORFs encoded in
another Rhizobium etli strain; IE4771 [21]. The genome
of this strain has been sequenced, but not assembled, so
we cannot assign them to the pSym, although that is
their most probable localization.
The majority of the ORFs shared between pSfr64a and
the chromosome of NGR234 are related to small molecule metabolism (15 ORFs), and to the transport of

small molecules (11 ORFs). As shown in Figure 3 and
Additional File 1 this region is also highly colinear with
the corresponding genes on the chromosome of
NGR234. Data presented in this section suggest that
pSfr64a was assembled during evolution as a chimeric
structure, harboring segments from two separate R. etli
plasmids and the chromosome of a Sinorhizobium
strain, such as NGR234.
Plasmid pSfr64a is transmissible and required for transfer
of pSfr64b

The structural conservation on pSfr64a of genes
involved in conjugation, raised the possibility of selftransmissibility of this replicon; therefore, the conjugative capacity of GR64 plasmids was studied. The results
(Table 4) show that plasmid pSfr64a is transmissible at
a high frequency. The symbiotic plasmid pSfr64b was
also able to perform conjugative transfer, but only when
pSfr64a was present. We conclude that pSfr64a provides
transfer functions to pSfr64b. The process could be
similar to what we described for CFN42, where pRet42a
induces pSym transfer by cointegration. Alternatively,
pSfr64b mobilization could be induced in trans. Interestingly, the transfer frequency of this pSym was found

and repB genes group strain GR64 with other beannodulating Sinorhizobium strains isolated from the
South of Spain (Granada and Sevilla) [22,23] and from
the North of Africa (Tunisia) [24] (Figure 4C). The data
obtained indicate that GR64 has a S. fredii chromosome
but carries a pSym that allows nodulation of Phaseolus.
However, this plasmid differs from typical R. etli pSyms
in its replication genes, allowing it to coexist with plasmid pSfr64a, which does share its replication genes with
the R. etli pSym. Another feature that differentiates this
pSym is the presence of a single copy of the nifH gene.

Genomic background determines functionality of
conjugative plasmids

In order to assess the specificity of pSym transfer induction, we constructed derivatives containing diverse plasmid
combinations, in either R. etli or S. fredii genomic backgrounds, as described in Materials and Methods, and
determined the transfer frequency of the self-transmissible
and symbiotic plasmids (Table 4). Analysis of a derivative
containing the R. etli self-transmissible plasmid pRet42a in
S. fredii background (GR64-3) showed a dramatic decrease
in the transfer ability of the plasmid as well as no transfer
of the GR64 pSym. These results suggest that the genome
of GR64 contains an inhibitor of pRet42a transfer. The
decrease in pRet42a transfer could mask its function as
helper for pSym transfer induction. The fact that pRet42a
transfer is also decreased in a derivative lacking the pSym
of GR64 (GR64-5), points to a chromosomal location of
the putative inhibitor locus. Similarly, S. fredii pSfr64a was
unable to perform conjugative transfer or induce transfer
of pSfr64b in R. etli genomic background (CFN2001-3).
Only R. etli pRet42a was still able to induce pSfr64b transfer in the R. etli background (CFN2001-2).
The pSym of GR64 differs from the typical R. etli pSym

To further analyze the bean-nodulating S. fredii strain
GR64, we performed a phylogenetic analysis with chromosomal genes (recA, rpoB), and with the plasmidencoded genes nifH and repB. The results (Figure 4)
show that, based on the phylogeny of the chromosomal

Discussion
Genomic comparisons of S. meliloti, A. tumefaciens, and
R. etli [25], and between Rhizobium leguminosarum bv
viciae and Rhizobium etli [26], have shown that chromosomes are well conserved both in gene content and gene
order, whereas plasmids presented few common regions
and lacked synteny, except for some pairs of plasmids
whose features indicate that they were part of the ancestral
genome, and may be considered as secondary chromosomes [26,27]. In R. etli, the symbiotic and self-transmissible plasmids are the less conserved replicons [25] with
fewer collinear blocks [26].
In this paper we show that a conjugative plasmid from a
bean nodulating S. fredii strain is formed by large segments of replicons found in strains belonging to different
species from diverse geographic origins. These replicons
include two plasmids of R. etli, and a S. fredii chromosome. In GR64, bean-nodulation is provided by pSfr64b.
Although the phylogenetic relationship of the GR64 nifH
gene shows that it is closely related to the R. etli gene
(Figure 4), pSfr64b differs from the typical R. etli pSym in
other features (see above).
We have previously reported that R. etli pRet42a is able
to form a cointegrate with the pSym, and thus promote
its conjugative transfer, and that in some cases (10% of
the events), resolution of the cointegrate leads to the generation of recombinant plasmids containing segments of
both pRet42a and the pSym [7]. Also, the occurrence of
frequent genomic rearrangements in rhizobial species has
been amply documented [19,20,25,28].
Integrating these data, we propose that the R. etli plasmids were transferred to a S. fredii strain and recombination events among the plasmids, the chromosome,
and possibly another endogenous S. fredii plasmid, led
to the generation of plasmids pSfr64a and pSfr64b. This
would indicate that pSfr64a is an evolutionary “new”
plasmid of chimeric origin, that was generated after R.
etli strains arrived to Europe, following the discovery of
America, when bean seeds coated with bacteria were
most likely introduced to that continent [29]. It is noteworthy that pSfr64a, in spite of carrying a large segment

of chromosomal origin, would not be considered as a
secondary chromosome, as it can be cured without
affecting the saprophytic phenotype of the strain (data
not shown). It is possible that such a plasmid is an
“intermediate” in the formation of secondary chromosomes. Other plasmids with a structure similar to that
of pSfr64a, have yet to be described. The finding of such
a plasmid in a natural environment may be a living
example of a pathway that allows shuffling of the
repABC genes, which has been proposed as a strategy to
explain the plasmid diversity of Rhizobium [26]. Also,
the fact that the repABC genes are located adjacent to
the transfer region that is similar to that of pRet42a,
and separate from the other sequences that are similar

to the R. etli pSym, highlights the impact of evolutionary
forces leading to this arrangement, which is highly conserved in many plasmids, and must have evolved in a
relatively short time period.
Strain NGR234 was isolated in 1965 by M. J. Trinick,
from Lablab purpureus nodules in Papua New Guinea
[11]. The complete genome of strain NGR234 has been
sequenced [30]. Very recently, the classification of
NGR234 was changed from Rhizobium sp to Sinorhizobium fredii. However, no genomic sequence of a type
strain of S. fredii is available at present. Genome analysis
of other S. fredii strains, both, typical and bean-nodulating,
would help to define if the sequence migrated to a plasmid
in a S. fredii ancestor, or in a more recent event.

The segment containing sequences similar to the
R. etli transmissible plasmid pRet42a includes the genes
involved in conjugative transfer. Conjugative transfer of
Agrobacterium tumefaciens pTi and other rhizobial plasmids is subject to quorum-sensing regulation [3,4,31]. In
pRet42a, transcription of tra and trb genes is activated
by the autoinducer TraI and the transcriptional regulators TraR and CinR. The repressor encoded by traM is
not active [5]. Plasmid pSfr64a contains similar regulatory genes, indicating that its transfer is probably regulated by quorum-sensing. Some differences, such as
absence of cinR may account for specific responses to
different host-related or environmental conditions. Preliminary data indicate the participation of new elements
for the activation of the conjugative transfer of pSfr64a.
A comprehensive study of the regulatory mechanisms
governing pSfr64a transfer will be addressed in the
future.
We have shown that the pSym of GR64 is able to perform pSfr64a-dependent conjugative transfer. The process
could be similar to what occurs in CFN42, where pRet42a
forms a cointegrate with the pSym, allowing its transfer.
Alternatively, pSfr64b mobilization could be induced
in trans. The analysis of this process will be pursued in the
future.
R. etli plasmid p42a was defined as self-transmissible
because it may be transferred from diverse genomic
backgrounds, such as Agrobacterium, containing no
other plasmids [5,32]. The conjugation experiments performed in this work, show that pRet42a transfer is significantly decreased in GR64 background, suggesting the
presence of host-specific elements that interfere with the
transfer function. Regarding pSfr64a, conjugation occurs
at high frequency when the donor is the native strain.
Transfer has not been determined from plasmid-less
strains, so that the lack of transfer from R. etli background could be due to the presence of an inhibitor, or
to the lack of a required factor, encoded in the chromosome or pSfr64b. These data suggest that a plasmid may
be “sequestered” by a host, and imply that the plasmid
needs to adjust the appropriate expression of conjugal
transfer functions to the new host environment.

Conclusions
Bean-nodulating S. fredii strain GR64 carries a conjugative plasmid (pSfr64a) that has a large segment similar to
the R. etli pSym, including replication, but not symbiosisrelated genes, another segment similar to pRet42a, containing the transfer region, and a third segment, similar
to the S. fredii NGR234 chromosome. The generation of
this plasmid can be explained by the transfer of a symbiotic-conjugative-plasmid cointegrate from R. etli to a
S. fredii strain; at least two recombination events among
the R. etli plasmids and the S. fredii genome need to be

Page 8 of 11

invoked to explain the chimeric composition of plasmid
pSfr64a. The structure of the symbiotic plasmid of GR64
could also be the result of these recombination events.
Plasmid pSfr64a is required for conjugative transfer of
the symbiotic plasmid. In spite of the similarity among
pSfr64a and R. etli pRet42a conjugation related genes,
the transfer process of these plasmids shows a host-specific behaviour.

Methods
Bacterial strains and plasmids

The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are
described in Table 1. R. etli strains were grown at 30°C
on PY medium [33]. Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium
tumefaciens strains were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB)
medium [34] at 37°C and 30°C respectively. When
required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations (in μg ml-1): nalidixic acid (Nal) 20, spectinomycin (Sp) 75, kanamycin (Km) 15, neomycin (Nm)
60, rifampicin (Rif) 100, streptomycin (Str) 50, tetracycline (Tc) 2 for Rhizobium and 10 for E. coli, gentamicin
(Gm), and erythromycin (Ery) 100.
Genetic manipulations

Conjugation experiments were performed on PY plates
at 30°C, using overnight cultures grown to stationary
phase. Donors and recipients were mixed in a 1:2 ratio
and incubated overnight. The mixtures were collected
and suspended in 1 ml of 10 mM MgSO4-0.01% Tween
40 (vol/vol). Serial dilutions were plated on suitable
selective media. The transfer frequency was expressed as
the number of transconjugants per donor.
A derivative of GR64 carrying a Tn5mob-labeled pSym
was constructed by mating GR64 with strain S-17/
pSUP5011 and selecting for resistance to Nal and Nm.
Tagged plasmids were mobilized to A. tumefaciens
GMI9023 [35] in triparental crosses, using pRK2013 [36]
as helper, and selecting for RifR NmR transconjugants.
Transconjugants carrying the tagged pSym (pSfr64b)
were identified using Eckhardt type gels.
To determine the presence of transmissible plasmids,
we randomly labeled strain GR64 with Tn5-GDYN, by
mating it with E. coli S17/Tn5-GDYN [17] and selecting
NalR SpR transconjugants. The labeled transconjugants
were used as donors in conjugations with A. tumefaciens
strain GMI9023. As the transposon integrates randomly
into the chromosome or plasmids present in a strain, its
integration into a transmissible plasmid confers a selective marker to the plasmid. Plasmids present in the
selected transconjugants were visualized with Eckhardt
gels.
The Tn5-GDYN element contains the sacR-sacB
genes, which confer sucrose sensitivity in several gramnegative bacteria, so that selection of sucrose-resistant

colonies allows the isolation of plasmid-less derivatives
[17]. Plasmid-curing was carried out by plating overnight cultures of the transposon-labeled strains on PY
plates containing 12.5% sucrose. Sucrose-resistant colonies were selected and verified as SpS. Plasmid profiles
of such colonies were analyzed in Eckhardt type gels.

were grown in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks with Fahraeus
agar medium [42], without added nitrogen, at 28°C. Nodulation was scored at day 15 after inoculation. Surface-sterilized nodules were crushed on PY plates, and the plasmid
pattern of single colonies was checked on Eckhardt type
gels.

Construction of S. fredii and R etli derivatives with diverse
plasmid content

Amplification and sequencing of recA, rpoB, and nifH
gene fragments

We constructed various derivatives of GR64 (Table 1):
GR64-1 has pSfr64a labeled with Tn5-GDYN and
pSfr64b with Tn5mob. This construct allowed us to
obtain a derivative cured of pSfr64a (GR64-2). The
absence of pSfr64a in GR64-2 was confirmed by Southern type hybridization of plasmid profiles probed with
purified pSfr64a (Figure 1B), and of total restricted DNA
(data not shown). Tn5-GDYN-labeled-pRet42a from R.
etli CFN42 was introduced into GR64-2 to generate
GR64-3. A derivative of GR64-2 with a Tn5-GDYN
inserted in pSfr64b was constructed. This strain was used
to generate GR64-4, cured of both plasmids. Tn5GDYN-labeled-pRet42a from R. etli CFN42 was introduced into GR64-4 to generate GR64-5. To construct
GR64-6, Tn5-GDYN-labeled-pSfr64a was introduced
into GR64-4. CFN2001 is a derivative of R. etli CFN42
that lacks the pSym (pRet42d), and the self-transmissible
plasmid pRet42a [37]. This strain was used as receptor to
select transconjugants carrying the Tn5mob-labeled
pSym of GR64 (CFN2001-1), the Tn5mob-labeled pSym
of GR64 and Tn5-GDYN-labeled pRet42a of R. etli
CFN42 (CFN2001-2), and both plasmids of GR64
(CFN2001-3). Other derivatives carried either pSfr64a::
Tn5-GDYN or pSfr64b::Tn5mob in Agrobacterium strain
GMI9023 genomic background.

Partial nifH, recA and rpoB fragments were amplified with
the primer pairs nifH40F/nifH817R, recA41F/recA640R
and rpoB454F/rpoB 1364R as previously described [43,44].
All amplifications were performed with Taq polymerase
(USB-Amersham). Amplification products were purified
using Roche’s PCR product purification system. Both
strands were commercially sequenced by Macrogen,
Korea.

Plasmid profiles

Plasmid profiles were visualized by the Eckhardt technique [38], as modified by Hynes and McGregor [39].
Filter blot hybridization and plasmid visualization

For Southern-type hybridizations [40], Eckhardt type gels,
or 1% agarose gels where restricted DNA was electrophoresed, were blotted onto nylon membranes, and hybridized
under stringent conditions, as previously reported [41], by
using Rapid-hyb buffer. Probes were linearized by digesting them with appropriate restriction enzymes and were
labeled with [a32P]dCTP by using a Rediprime DNA labeling system. All restriction endonucleases, [a -32P]dCTP,
hybridization buffer, and labeling systems were purchased
from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.
Nodulation assays

Overnight cultures were used to inoculate surface-sterilized Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Negro Jamapa seeds. Plants

Phylogenetic inference

Reference nifH, recA, rpoB and repB sequences were
retrieved via BLASTP searches from a locally maintained
BLAST database containing all fully sequenced Rhizobiales
genomes, and via remote BLASTP searches against NCBI’s
non-redundant database. The query sequences for nifH,
recA and rpoB used in the BLASTP searches were those
obtained from the sequenced PCR amplicons from strain
GR64, while that of repB was obtained from the sequence
of pSfr64a. Nucleotide sequences were translated and
aligned using muscle 3.7 [45]. The resulting protein multiple sequence alignments were used as masks to generate
the underlying codon alignments using custom Perl
scripts.
Models of nucleotide substitution were selected by the
Akaike information criterion (AIC), using MODELTEST3.7 [46]. Among-site rate variation was modelled by a
gamma distribution, approximated with 4 rate categories,
each category being represented by its mean. Maximum
likelihood (ML) trees were inferred under the AICselected models of nucleotide substitution for each data
set using PhyML v3.0.1 [47]. The robustness of the ML
topologies was evaluated using a recently developed Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like test for branches implemented in
PhyML v3.0.1 [47]. For the sake of clarity, a small selection
of the most relevant sequences was performed to show
herein, based on the results of the phylogenetic analysis
with the full set of homologous sequences.
Sequencing of plasmid pSfr64a

Plasmid pSfr64a was purified by the Hirsch method [48],
and used to construct a shotgun library with inserts of
approximately 1-2 kb. A total of 1970 high-quality readings were collected by using the ABI3730XL automatic
DNA sequencing machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). Gaps were filled in by performing appropriate

Cervantes et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:149

PCR amplification. Assemblages were obtained by the
PhredPhrap-Consed software [49-51]. The quality of the
final assembly was less than 1 error per 100,000 bases
and had an average coverage of 6.5X.
Annotation

Open reading frames were predicted by using GLIMMER 3.0 [52,53] and annotation was carried out with
the help of BLASTX [54] comparisons against the GenBank nonredundant database [55], INTERPRO [56]
searches, and manual curation by using ARTEMIS [57].
To compare partial genomic sequences with the nonredundant database of GenBank, BLASTX searches were
performed, and the top hits were classified with respect
to organisms with which they matched.
Nucleotide sequence accesion number

Plasmid pSfr64a accession number is GenBank:
CP002245. GR64 nifH, recA, and rpoB accesion numbers
are respectively GenBank: JN034672, JN034673,
JN034674.
