Abstract
Background: LTR retrotransposons are one of the main causes for plant genome size and
structure evolution, along with polyploidy. The characterization of their amplification and
subsequent elimination of the genomes is therefore a major goal in plant evolutionary genomics.
To address the extent and timing of these forces, we performed a detailed analysis of 41 LTR
retrotransposon families in rice.
Results: Using a new method to estimate the insertion date of both truncated and complete
copies, we estimated these two forces more accurately than previous studies based on other
methods. We show that LTR retrotransposons have undergone bursts of amplification within the
past 5 My. These bursts vary both in date and copy number among families, revealing that each
family has a particular amplification history. The number of solo LTR varies among families and
seems to correlate with LTR size, suggesting that solo LTR formation is a family-dependent
process. The deletion rate estimate leads to the prediction that the half-life of LTR retrotransposon
sequences evolving neutrally is about 19 My in rice, suggesting that other processes than the
formation of small deletions are prevalent in rice DNA removal.
Conclusion: Our work provides insights into the dynamics of LTR retrotransposons in the rice
genome. We show that transposable element families have distinct amplification patterns, and that
the turn-over of LTR retrotransposons sequences is rapid in the rice genome.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) make up a large part of
eukaryotic genomes. They represent a genomic fraction of
3% in baker's yeast [1], ~20% in fruit fly [2-5], 45% in
human [6,7] and over 80% in maize [8,9]. Due to their
repetitive nature and to the fact that they harbor regulatory signals, TEs are responsible for chromosomal rearrangements [10], fragmental gene movements [11,12]
and for the evolution of gene regulation and function

[13,14]. Hence, the activity of TEs is currently considered
to be one of the major processes in genome evolution.
In plants, Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons
are the most common type of TE: they are ubiquitous in
the plant kingdom [15] and are the main constituents of
large plant genomes [15,16]. Moreover, these elements
have been shown to be responsible for wide genome
expansions [8,9,17-21] and are considered to be major

players in the remarkable variation of genome size
observed in flowering plants [22,23], along with polyploidy.
LTR retrotransposons are class I TEs and thus replicate
using a RNA intermediate, through a "copy-and-paste"
mechanism. They are related to retroviruses with which
they share their structure: the complete copies consist of
two LTRs that flank an internal region. LTR sequences contain the signals for transcription initiation and termination, while the internal region encodes the proteins that
are necessary for the retrotransposition cycle. LTR retrotransposons are classified into two major families: the
Ty1/copia-like and Ty3/gypsy-like elements.
Plant LTR retrotransposons vary in size from 2 to 18 kb
and harbor LTRs that vary in size from a few hundreds
bases to several kilobases [15,24]. LTRs are terminated by
a short inverted dinucleotide, usually 5'-TG-3' and 5'-CA3' [15]. Their well-defined structure, their role in genome
size expansion, their prevalence and their repetitive nature
make LTR retrotransposons good models to study genome
evolution. In all plants analyzed, LTR retrotransposons
appear to have undergone recent amplifications (i.e.
within the past 15 million years) [9,25-34]. LTR retrotransposons are nevertheless present in all plant lineages
and thus of ancient origin (reviewed in [15] and [24]).
The distribution and structure of LTR retrotransposons
have been studied in several species, in particular in the
two model plants for which a nearly complete genomic
sequence is available: Arabidopsis thaliana [25-27,30,31]
and rice (Oryza sativa L.) [28,32,33]. In rice, however,
these studies have been based on either numerous LTR retrotransposon families but within a relatively small portion of the genome [28,32] or small subsets of LTR
retrotransposon families within approximately the entire
genome [33]. In our study, a set of 41 LTR retrotransposon
families was analyzed on the almost complete rice
genome (~365 Mb). This comprehensive structural analysis provides insights into both the amplification and the
subsequent elimination of LTR retrotransposon
sequences and reveals the highly dynamic nature of the
rice genome.

Results and discussion
Global analysis of 41 LTR retrotransposon families: copy
number, current genomic fraction and DNA amount
deleted since their insertion
We extracted the paralogous copies of 41 LTR retrotransposons families (16 gypsy-like and 25 copia-like families,
Table 1) from the rice genome sequence using Blaster, a
program suite based on the Blast program [35] and
improved for the detection of transposable elements [4].
Through this initial Blaster search, we retrieved from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/218

rice genome sequence more than 13,000 LTR retrotransposon copies, with copy numbers per family ranging from
a few copies to over 2000 copies per haploid genome
(Table 2). Because the total sequence of the 12 rice pseudomolecules analyzed represents only ~94% (365 Mb) of
the rice genome, we believe, however, that the copy numbers of these families could possibly be higher.
Altogether, these elements represent 7.8% (30.4 Mb) of
the current rice genome. If all the copies mined correspond to real paralogous copies of the families and if their
size upon insertion was similar to that of their corresponding reference copy, they represented 136.8 Mb
upon insertion, suggesting that 106.4 Mb (77.8%) of the
DNA conferred by their insertion has been removed.
The analysis of the mined copies revealed that some reference copies harbor insertions, most of them smaller than
200 bp, and a few larger than 200 bp. It also revealed that
one family shares LTR with a LArge Retrotransposon
Derivative (LARD). To correct for the possible detection of
false paralogous copies, we therefore applied a filter discarding any fragment smaller than 200 bp, and did not
take into account families with larger inserts or other
problematic features (see Material and Methods). With
this new filter, we estimate that 5154 copies from 19 families, which represented 52.3 Mb upon insertion, remain
today in the rice genome as 20.2 Mb, leading to a loss of
32.1 Mb (61.4%).
We believe that the first data are an over-estimate and that
the latter may be an under-estimate of the total percentage
of DNA eliminated from the rice genome. Hence, we estimate that the percentage of DNA that has been eliminated
from the rice genome since the insertion of the detected
copies is comprised between 61% and 78%.
To get an overview of the deletion process for each family,
we computed the distribution of the copy size relative to
the reference copy size (Table 2). This analysis revealed
that, for all families, most of the copies are highly truncated (most of the families have a median length below
15%). In addition, since each genomic copy shows a high
sequence identity with its corresponding reference copy
(median range: 0.81–0.96), all the copies belonging to a
given family also share high sequence identity. Taken
together, the high degree of deletion and the high level of
identity between copies within a family suggest that LTR
retrotransposon copies start being eliminated from the
genome shortly after their insertion.
Rice LTR retrotransposons amplify in burst-like patterns
which differ among families

sequence turn-over process in the rice genome, we first

The elements highlighted in bold correspond to the elements for which the LTR position was validated after comparison of the literature data with
our annotation. Total size of the element is given after homogenization of the two LTRs (see Materials and Methods). Data extracted from the
literature are from [28], except for RIRE1 [44] and Tos17/Osr1 [45].

wanted to estimate the insertion dates of the largest set of
copies possible, for each family.
For copies with 2 LTRs, the best method to estimate insertion date is based on the divergence between the two LTRs
of each copy [9]. For copies lacking one or two LTRs (i.e.,
truncated copies of LTR retrotransposons or copies of
other types of TEs such as LINEs or DNA transposons), the
method currently used is based on pairwise nucleotide
identity between elements that are closely related at the
phylogenetic level or between genomic copies and a consensus of the element [36-38]. However, this method esti-

mates the overall insertion date of the set of copies as a
whole, and cannot estimate the insertion date for each
individual genomic copy. Moreover, consensus-based
methods greatly depend on the quality of the consensus
and thus on the selection of the copies used to build it.
To overcome these caveats, we designed a new method
(see Materials and Methods and Figure 1) to estimate the
insertion date of the truncated copies. As we showed in a
previous work on three rice gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons [29], rice LTR retrotransposons amplify in bursts,
leading to the insertion of many related copies in a short

period of time. If this is true for all rice retrotransposons,
it should be possible to find, for each truncated copy, a
copy with two LTRs that originated from the same amplification burst, and has approximately the same age. The
age of a given truncated copy can then be estimated using
both the age of the most related copy with two LTRs, and
the sequence identity existing between this complete copy
and the truncated one (Figure 1).
By applying this method on the complete dataset of all
genomic copies detected (after filtering by length), we

could analyze the amplification timing of 10 LTR retrotransposon families (6 copia-like and 4 gypsy-like), for
which an insertion date could be estimated for more than
15 copies. The histograms of these data, presented in Figure 2, show at least one peak per family, revealing that the
10 families have all undergone at least one burst of amplification. These bursts, however, vary in extent and age
between families. Some families such as Hopi/Osr27,
Osr17, Houba/Osr13 and Osr7 have undergone very recent
amplification (divergence less than 0.01, i.e. less than 0.4
My), whereas that of other families, such as Osr15, Osr29,

Figure 1
New method to estimate the insertion date of truncated copies
New method to estimate the insertion date of truncated copies. When a burst of amplification occurs, all the copies
deriving from one master copy insert approximately at the same time. Upon insertion, all the new copies are identical in
sequence as well as the two LTRs of each copy, leading to a null divergence between copies (Div = 0) and between the two
LTRs of each copy (DivLTRs = 0). Over time, all sequences evolve at the same rate, so both the divergence between two copies
and the divergence between the two LTRs of one copy are equal at a given time. Hence, if the nucleotide divergence between
a truncated copy and a copy with two LTRs ("2 LTRs" copy) is equal to the nucleotide divergence between the two LTRs of
the "2 LTRs" copy, the two copies originated from the same burst of amplification and the insertion date estimated for the "2
LTRs" copy can be used as an approximation of the insertion date of the truncated one.

Osr30, Osr8, RIRE1 (divergence around 0.05, corresponding to 1.9 My, or Osr30 (around 0.03, corresponding to
1.2 My) is more ancient. Some families, such as Dagul or
Houba/Osr13, seem to have undergone several bursts of
amplification, since several peaks are noticeable. The
dates of these peaks vary between families from around
0.02 and 0.05 for Dagul to 0.01 and 0.04–0.06 for Houba/
Osr13. Some of the older peaks, such as the second peak
for Dagul, could only be observed through the addition of
the dated truncated copies, illustrating that estimating the
insertion date of truncated copies is important to describe
the amplification process LTR retrotransposons in rice as
accurately as possible.
In terms of magnitude, some families, such as Hopi/Osr27,
Osr30 or Houba/Osr13, have undergone large bursts of
amplification, involving over 350, 100 and 80 copies per
burst, respectively. Interestingly, Dagul, Hopi/Osr27 and
Houba/Osr13, which are among the 5 most recently ampli-

fied elements, were previously characterized by our team
using the subtractive "Representational Difference Analysis" (RDA) cloning technique between rice and foxtail
millet [39], and were subsequently shown to have
inserted recently in the rice genome [29,39]. This suggests
that the RDA technique mainly allows the extraction of
young highly repeated sequences. The new data concerning these three elements confirm those that we obtained
for 30% of the rice genome [29]. In particular, they confirm that the amplification burst of Hopi/Osr27 was large
and rapid, and took place in a very recent past [29] or may
still be actively transposing.
The elimination of LTR retrotransposon sequences is
efficient in rice, with a half-life of 3–4 My
As shown above, we estimate the amount of LTR retrotransposon DNA removed from the rice genome around
61–78%. Considering that most of this removal occurred
within the last 5 My (most of the copies have inserted in

this time lap), we estimate the half-life of a LTR retrotransposon sequence to be comprised between 3 My and 4 My.
In a recent paper, Ma and collaborators [33] estimated the
half-life of a retrotransposon sequence in the rice genome
to be less than 6 My, using the pairwise comparison
method for global insertion date estimation of the copies
and a conservative substitution rate that is half as fast as
ours (3.5 × 10-9 substitutions per site per year versus 1.3 ×
10-8 in our case). After adjusting their results with the substitution rate we used, our results on a large sample are in
agreement with a half-life of 3 My. In both studies large
deletions could not be taken into account in the elimination process. Since such deletions could induce the elimination of one or more complete elements, we believe that
the elimination of LTR retrotransposons sequences in the
rice genome is even more efficient than a 3 My half-life.
To complete our analysis of the elimination process, we
classified the copies according to their truncation level,
into copies that harbored two LTRs, one LTR and the internal region, only one LTR, and only the internal region
(designated as "2 LTRs", "LTR-IR", "LTR" and "IR", respectively). Results of this analysis, shown in Table 3, reveal
that most of the copies are highly truncated. For all families except Osr2 and Osr12 (where the dataset was smallest), the copies harboring two LTRs represent less than
50% of the total number, with a median at 18.9%.
Using these data along with the timing data obtained for
the families (Figure 2), we found that the percentage of
truncated/complete copies is correlated with the age of the
family, with the younger families having fewer truncated
copies than the older ones. For instance, Hopi/Osr27,
which has amplified mainly within the last 0.4 My (LTR

divergence < 0.01) shows 40% of complete copies,
whereas for Osr8, which has amplified around 1.5–2 My
ago (LTR divergence mainly within the range 0.04–0.05),
these copies represent only 18.7%. These results are in
agreement with previous studies, in which the same correlation was found [33]. This feature, however, cannot be
viewed on Figure 2, because no insertion date could be
estimated for most ancient copies.
In addition, the proportion of the different types of truncated copies over time scale increments of 0.01 (~0.4 My),
presented in Figure 2, reveals very young truncated copies
(e.g. for families Dagul, Hopi/Osr27, Osr17 and Houba/
Osr13), revealing that the elimination of LTR retrotransposon sequences is very efficient in the rice genome.
Processes of DNA removal: solo LTRs and accumulation of
deletion analysis
The global analysis of our data showed that the elimination of rice LTR retrotransposon sequences is efficient in
rice (half-life of 3–4 My). But what are the mechanisms
responsible for the elimination of the copies? As shown in
previous studies [27,29,33], the elimination of LTR retrotransposon sequences in plants is the result of several cellular processes such as homologous recombination
(leading to the formation of solo LTRs), and the accumulation of small deletions through illegitimate recombination. In our study, we believe that the "LTR" fragments
have arisen from both homologous recombination and
the accumulation of small deletions or larger rearrangements, and that the two other types of truncation ("LTRIR" and "IR") have arisen from the last two processes only.
To study the formation of solo LTRs and other mechanisms, we analyzed separately the temporal dynamics of

(i) the "LTR" fragments and (ii) the "LTR-IR" and "IR"
fragments.
Solo LTR formation
Our analysis of the "LTR" fragments per 0.01 time scale
increment (Figure 2) revealed that the different LTR retrotransposons harbor different amounts of "LTR"
sequences. For instance, Dagul, Osr29 or Osr30 display a
large number of "LTRs" compared to the other types of
truncated sequences, whereas Houba/Osr13 or Osr17 do
not show as many (Table 3). The formation of solo LTRs
has been proposed to occur through unequal homologous recombination [19,27] and/or double-strand break
repair [24]. In both cases, both the size of the internal
region and the LTR size would impact the number of solo
LTRs formed: (i) since these mechanisms are based on the
physical closeness of the two LTRs, the number of solo
LTRs is expected to decrease with the size of the internal
region, and (ii) since they are based on the presence of
homology between the two LTRs, the number of solo LTRs
is expected to increase with the size of LTR. Because both
internal region and LTR sizes vary through time in a given
copy, these points can be made only when comparing elements that show similar insertion times, for instance
Hopi/Osr27 vs.Osr17 and Osr8 vs. Osr29. HopiOsr27 has a
larger internal region (10686 vs. 5491 bp), and a larger
LTR (1103 vs. 466 bp) than Osr17. Its LTR frequency is
higher (27% vs. 8%). Osr8 and Osr29 have similar internal region size, but Osr8 has bigger LTRs (1220 vs. 656
bp) and its LTR frequency is higher (58% vs. 30%). Therefore, LTR size seems to have an impact on solo LTR formation, but not the size of the internal region, suggesting that
formation of solo LTRs is a family-dependent process.
More data are however needed to confirm this pattern.
Accumulation of small deletions
The accumulation of small deletions has been proposed
to occur through illegitimate recombination, as shown by
the observation of small patches of micro-homology
flanking the deleted sequences [27,33,40]. To better estimate the efficiency of this process, we analyzed the deletion rate and DNA loss rate. Since illegitimate
recombination is supposed to be a general mechanism in
the cell, it is expected to affect similarly all types of LTR
retrotransposons and truncated sequences. Therefore,
under the assumption that the accumulation of deletion is
similar in all families, and occurs continuously through
time, we estimated the deletion rate and the deletion loss
rate by combining the data obtained for 34 families using
a method derived from one classically used in animals
([41,42] and Materials and Methods).

Figure 3 shows the relationship between the number of
deletions per bp and the number of substitution per bp.
The ratio of deletion to point mutation (represented by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/218

the slope) was estimated using maximum likelihood (see
Materials and Methods). Through this analysis, werevealed a deletion rate of 0.095 deletion per substitution
(95% confidence limits: 0.094–0.096). With a mean deletion size of 29.28 bp (95% confidence limits: 27.15–
31.69), the corresponding DNA loss rate (deletion rate
times the mean deletion size) is 2.79 bp per substitution.
Using this coefficient, we estimate that half of a LTR retrotransposon sequence is removed through accumulation of
deletions within approximately 19 My (or 0.25 substitutions) in the absence of selection. This estimation can be
compared to the DNA loss rate estimated for D. melanogaster [43]. In D. melanogaster, both mean deletion size
(60.7 bp) and deletion rate (0.114) are greater, resulting
in a greater DNA loss estimate of 6.9 bp per substitution.
These results suggest that the removal of transposable element sequences through neutral accumulation of small
deletions is more efficient in D. melanogaster than in rice,
probably partially accounting for the genome size difference between these two species.
This half-life of 19 My is very different from the one we
calculated based on the global size of the copies because
it does not take into account selection against TE insertions and has to be considered as a quasi-neutral deletion
rate estimate. Homologous recombination and selection
will accelerate the elimination of TEs and thus increase the
global DNA loss observed for these sequences. Moreover,
with this method, we detect only the accumulation of
small deletions (smaller than the copy size), and do not
take into account larger rearrangements (hence, the small
mean deletion size, compared to the high degree of truncation for most copies). In particular, because it is based
on the analysis of the sequence pairs in the terminal tree
forks, it takes into account only the newer deletions. If
small deletions appear faster than large rearrangements in
the rice genome, some large rearrangements may not have
been taken into account by this method.
These results reveal that, even though the neutral accumulation of small deletions plays a role in LTR retrotransposons DNA removal in rice, this force is not the
predominant force shaping genome size.
Power and limits of our analyis
Any comprehensive analysis of the structure and evolution of LTR retrotransposons in a given species requires a
large LTR retrotransposon database and a large genomic
sequence as starting point. For our search to be as representative as possible of the whole genome, we analyzed
41 LTR retrotransposons families, including 16 gypsy-like
and 25 copia-like families. As revealed by our study, these
families are low, – middle- and high-copy number families (Table 1). We thus believe that this sample is representative of LTR retrotransposons in rice. The use of such

a large database, coupled with the analysis of a large
amount of rice sequence (~365 Mb, i.e. 93.6% of the
entire genome) allows a particularly extensive characterization of the evolutionary dynamics of LTR retrotransposons in rice. To our knowledge, this is the first time that
such an extensive study is made.
The second key point is the quality of the detection. In
particular, estimating how fast copies are eliminated from
a genome requires to accurately mine complete copies
(which can be fragmented by other insertions), as well as
small fragments that have been highly truncated. The use
of Blaster, a program suite based on the BLAST program
[35] and improved for the detection of transposable elements [4], is particularly powerful to mine such copies.
Along with the use of Blaster, the use of a database containing sequences of both the triggered LTR retrotransposons and other rice repetitive elements (see Material
and Methods), allows a powerful mining of copies fragmented by other insertions. Moreover, the detection of
very fragmented copies was enhanced by using the LTR
retrotransposon database as subject and the genome as
query in the Blaster search.
Because of these features, we believe that our method
detects accurately both complete copies and truncated
fragments. Since an accurate detection and estimate of the
copy size is a critical point in any study on LTR retrotransposons evolutionary dynamics, we analyzed the distribution of copy size for each family.
First, we expected that the longest copy detected and the
reference copy would have the same size because insertions in genomic copies (as compared to the reference

copy) were not taken into account in the computation of
the copy size. Results of the Blaster output, presented in
Table 2, reveal that this is true for most of the families (31/
41). For 6 families (Hopi/Osr27, Osr2, Osr8, Osr20, Osr34
and Osr44), the slight difference in size between the longest copy and the reference copy (99.3 to 99.9% of the reference copy size) is due to the homogenization of the two
LTRs in the reference copy (see Material and Methods).
For four other families (Osr22, Osr31, Osr38 and RIRE1),
however, the longest copy detected is more than 5%
shorter than the reference copy, which suggests that this
copy was not detected by our search. Osr22, Osr31 and
Osr38 were originally characterized by searching part of
the rice genome sequence [28]. Since this sample does not
completely overlap ours, it is likely that these reference
copies were not included in our genomic sample. For
RIRE1, however, the reference copy could not be detected
because this sequence is not derived from a genomic copy,
but is a chimeric sequence that originated from the cloning of several genomic copies [44].
Second, we expected that some short copies could be false
paralogous copies of our targeted families. Mainly, we suspected that some of them could correspond to (i) uncharacterized repeated sequences inserted in the reference
copy, and (ii) fragments corresponding to coding regions
of uncharacterized elements sharing a high sequence
identity with the element analyzed (in silico cross-hybridization between two different families). To check for these
possibilities, we looked at the position of the mined copies on the reference copy, using the alignment that we had
generated. This analysis revealed that some reference copies harbor insertions, most of them smaller than 200 bp,
and a few larger than 200 bp. It also revealed that one
family shares LTR with a LARD element.
Thus, we believe that such a verification step is essential to
interpret the data. For instance, one may not want to perform a detailed analysis of a LTR retrotransposon that
shares LTRs with a LARD element, because this feature
would artefactually increase the number of solitary LTRs
detected. In order not to take into account possible false
paralogous copies, we applied a filter discarding any fragment smaller than 200 bp, and did not analyze the deletion process in families with larger inserts or other
problematic features (see Material and Methods). This
conservative strategy had mainly two draw-backs: first,
some real paralogous copies with a size below 200 bp
would be missed due to the filter, leading to an under-estimate of copy number and total fraction of the genome
occupied by these elements. However, since the raw data
most probably over-estimate these numbers, we believe
that the comparison of the two outputs (with and without
filter) give a good estimate of these parameters. Second, it
decreased the number of families that could be used to

perform a detailed analysis of the deletion process. However, by starting with a large number of 41 families, we
could estimate the deletion process for 19 families, a large
enough number to get an estimate that is representative of
the genome.

transposons. To our knowledge, insertion of truncated
copies has not been described, meaning that if this is possible, it would occur rarely. Consequently, we believe that
the frequency of such events is low, and should not have
a large impact on our results.

Finally, the use of a new method to date truncated copies
allowed us to get a more detailed appreciation of the integration and elimination processes than with complete
copies alone, and, therefore, a more accurate estimate of
temporal parameters of the deletion processes. We
showed in earlier studies (29) that three rice gypsy-like
LTR retrotransposons amplify through burst of amplification. Here, the use of complete copies harboring 2 LTRs
revealed recent amplification bursts for several other families, suggesting that this is a general feature of rice LTR retrotransposons. Therefore, we developed a method to date
LTR retrotransposon fragments based on sequence identity between truncated fragments and a complete copy
that comes for the same amplification burst. This method
requires the conservation of at least one complete copy
per burst. Therefore, we did not expect to estimate the
insertion date of all truncated copies, particularly for
ancient ones, because copies of ancient burst were
expected to be all truncated. It is thus possible that we
missed some ancient bursts. However, this should not
have any impact on the detection of the more recent
bursts that we detect.

During our analysis, we revealed for Hopi/Osr27 and Osr8
the presence of truncated copies sharing a deleted region
compared to the reference copy. These two subsets of copies also share similar insertion times, suggesting that they
correspond to the amplification of truncated copies. Since
this was observed for 2 elements only, we believe that this
process does not affect tremendously our conclusions on
the overall deletion process. Moreover, since the formation of small deletions is a cellular process and should
therefore affect similarly all types of elements, the conclusions drawn on the deletion rate are not affected by this
observation.

Because old copies are more likely to be deleted than new
ones, this technique revealed ancient amplification
events, thus improving our characterization of the amplification process. Moreover, the estimation of the insertion
date for all types of copies allowed us to analyze the
number of truncated copies per time period, leading to a
more accurate characterization of the deletion process.
However, due to the stringent parameters that we used to
ensure a robust association between a truncated copy and
a dated copy harboring two LTRs (see Materials and Methods), the insertion date could not be estimated for all
truncated copies (Table 3).
Finally, our method allows an extensive characterization
of LTR retrotransposon copies in today's rice genome, as
well as their temporal dynamics of insertion and deletion,
leading to a comprehensive analysis of the processes
involved in their evolutionary dynamics in the rice
genome.
Our results are based on the assumption that the copies
extracted are derived from the insertion of complete copies. This assumes that the mechanism of retrotransposition do not lead to truncated copies upon integration.
This mechanism has been well studied in retroviruses, and
it is commonly accepted that it also applies to LTR retro-

Conclusion
Through the analysis of 41 rice LTR retrotransposon families, and the use of a new method to estimate the insertion date of both truncated and complete copies, we could
precisely describe the amplification and elimination of
LTR retrotransposon sequences in the rice genome (O.
sativa L.). We show that most of the copies were inserted
within the last 2 My, and that the amplification process
varies both in timing and extent between families. The
copies are subsequently efficiently eliminated from the
genome, through both solo LTR formation and accumulation of deletions. We estimate the half-life of LTR retrotransposon sequences in the rice genome to be less than 3
My. However, if only the neutral accumulation of small
deletions is taken into account, this half-life would be
close to 19 My, revealing that this process is not a major
force of LTR retrotransposon removal in the rice genome.
Rather, negative selection of these sequences or larger
rearrangements may be involved. Altogether, these results
reveal a high turn-over of LTR retrotransposon sequences
in the rice genome and therefore provide an explanation
for the rapid differentiation of intergenic regions in grass
genomes. To our knowledge, our study is the first to analyze rice LTR retrotransposons in such an extensive way.

Methods
Mining of LTR retrotransposons in the rice genome
We started by compiling a dataset containing all the rice
LTR retrotransposon sequences available from the literature [28,44,45] and from the public databanks [46,47].
We subsequently updated this dataset with the LTR retrotransposon sequences that we had previously characterized [29,48]. We then eliminated the redundancy of this
first dataset by performing dot plot comparisons, leading
to a final non redundant database containing 47 LTR retrotransposon sequences. Through this search, we found

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:218

that Osr13 is Houba/Osr13, Osr25 is Dasheng, Osr26 is
Retrosat1/RIRE2, Osr27 is Hopi/Osr27, Osr33 is RIRE8.
Some of these annotations were in agreement with ref 28,
Table 1, some were not. Moreover, we could not find any
significant similarity between RIRE1 (from Genbank
accession D85597) and Osr11, between Osr27 and RIRE9
(from Genbank AB033547) or between Tos17 and Osr21,
as stated by other authors (28). Since this paper did not
clearly states how the "pre-existing names" were associated with the "Osr" elements, we decided to follow our
annotation, not the one published (28), and kept the Osr
nomenclature for the elements that we did not annotate.
We then carefully analyzed the boundaries of each retrotransposon, and corrected then when needed. For each
LTR retrotransposon reference copy where LTRs were
detected, the two LTRs were homogenized by replacing
the 3' LTR by the sequence of the 5' LTR, to avoid differences in match between the two LTRs. A fasta file of the
sequences of the 41 LTR retrotransposon reference copies
contained in this database is available in additional file 1
on the BMC Genomics website.
To annotate possible insertions in the LTR retrotransposon genomic sequences that we would retrieve, we completed this dataset with known rice TEs such as DNA
transposons, Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Element (MITE) sequences and partial LTR retrotransposon
sequences that were available in the public databanks
[46,47]. Similarly, three LArge Retrotransposon Derivatives (LARDs) (Osr25/Dasheng, Spip and Squiq) and their
autonomous counterparts (Retrosat1/RIRE2/Osr26 [49],
RIRE3 and RIRE8/Osr33, respectively [48]) contained in
our dataset were used only for the annotation of genomic
copies. Indeed, the high sequence identity shared between
the LTR sequences of each LARD/retrotransposon couple
could have induced ambiguous annotation of the
genomic copies, and notably artefactually increase the
number of LTRs detected for these two families. Hence,
the final dataset that we further analyzed contained 41
LTR retrotransposons, including 16 Gypsy-like and 25
Copia-like families that varied in element and LTR size
(Table 1).
We extracted the copies of these 41 LTR retrotransposons
in the rice genome sequence using Blaster, a program suite
based on the BLAST program [35] and improved for the
detection of transposable elements [4]. For the current
study, we first performed a nucleotide-nucleotide BLASTN
search, using the 12 rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare)
pseudomolecules (representing almost 365 Mb, (i.e ~93%
of the entire genome) as query and our transposable elements dataset (containing LTR retrotransposons, LARDs
complete sequences, LTR retrotransposons partial
sequences and MITEs sequences, see above) as subject. We
then filtered the resulting High Scoring Pairs (HSPs),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/218

using a 1 × 10-10 E-value threshold. Finally, the selected
HSPs were connected by means of a dynamic programming algorithm based on HSP scores and the physical distance that separated them (Blaster suite, [4]). Thus, pieces
of retrotransposons that are separated by large insertions
(such as insertions of other TEs) can be connected
together in the genomic sequence. Extracted copies whose
sequence harbored stretches of N, indicating the presence
of unfinished sequences, were then eliminated in order
not to bias the estimation of copy size and the classification of the copies (see below for detail of these procedures).
Characterization of the LTR position for the 41 LTR
retrotransposons
The precise localization of the LTR was a key step in our
study, both for the classification of the copies based on
their truncation level and the estimation of their insertion
date. Therefore, we carefully checked the position of the
LTRs of the 41 non redundant reference copies. This was
performed as follows: we first extracted the data concerning LTR position in the literature. We then annotated the
LTR position by (1) aligning each reference sequence with
itself, using a "BLASTN 2 sequences" analysis [50] and (2)
comparing the first half of the sequence with the second
half, using Smith and Waterman local alignment, thus
making it possible to detect repeated regions of the same
orientation within each reference copy. We then compared the results (data not shown). When at least two
methods out of the three gave the same results, we considered the position to be accurate and kept the element for
further analysis (names in bold face in Table 1). Hence,
we did not analyze 7 elements any further, either due to a
lack of any observable LTRs whatever the method (Osr9,
Osr10, Osr11, Osr18) or because our analysis did not confirm the LTR positions described in the literature (Osr16,
Osr23, Osr31). In Table 1, these elements are referred to as
"RT only" and "ambiguous LTR position".
Analysis of short copies and size filter
Because the reference copies are derived from genomic
copies, we expected some of them to contain uncharacterized insertions, such as unknown MITEs or pieces of
unknown transposable elements. For this reason, certain
short copies retrieved by our Blaster search could correspond to paralogous copies of these TEs, and not to the
LTR retrotransposons of interest. To check for such possible insertions in the reference copies, we aligned all the
mined genomic copies on their corresponding reference
copies, and looked for subsets of copies that were a complete match with the same region of the reference copy.
This allowed us to spot sub-regions of the reference copies
that were highly repeated thus revealing inaccurate
boundaries for Osr4, presence of a LARD element related
to Osr14, as well as insertions in some reference copies.

Page 11 of 15

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:218

Two types of inserts were found: inserts with a size over
200 bp in reference copies Osr1, Osr5, Osr22, Osr34,
Osr37, Osr39, Osr40 and smaller inserts in many other
copies.
To discard these false-positive genomic copies that would
lead to an over-estimate of the deletion rate, we filtered
out every fragment with a size below 200 bp, and did not
further analyze the 9 families for which insertions larger
than 200 bp, or a related LARD element, were found. Families which LTR size is shorter or close to 200 bp (Osr19,
Osr44, Tos17, Osr20, Osr24, Osr43) were also discarded,
because the filter could lead to an under-estimation of
LTR copy number. Finally, we thus conducted a precise
analysis of the deletion process for 19 families (10 of copia
type and 9 of gypsy type).
Classification of the copies according to their truncation
level
For each genomic copy, Blaster produces an alignment
(connected HSPs) showing the coordinate correspondence between each genomic copy and the reference
sequence. Therefore, if the position of the LTR is annotated in the reference copy, the position of the LTR (if it
exists) can be determined for each genomic fragment.
Using the LTR position of our reference sequences, and
the alignments generated for each genomic copy by
Blaster, we thus classified the genomic copies as "2 LTRs",
"LTR-IR", "LTR", and "IR" (Internal region). Note that the
presence of a LTR or an internal region does not necessarily mean that it is complete, since it can harbor internal
deletions.
Copy size
To estimate the global genomic part corresponding to the
41 families, we extracted the length of each copy as given
by the Blaster search. For subsequent analysis, we needed
to estimate the copy length more accurately and thus did
not want to take into account small stretches of mismatch
that could have been excluded in the Blaster length computation. For our detailed analysis of the deletion process,
we therefore computed the copy length by extracting the
sequence of each copy, the sequence from Blaster start
position to Blaster end position, and then aligning each
copy with its corresponding reference copy, using the gap
global alignment program [51], with the following
parameters: matches (+10), mismatches (-7), gap open (16), gap extension (-6). We chose these parameters to
allow for long gaps (possibly corresponding to large insertions/deletions) in the alignments. The length was then
computed by counting the positions of all matches and
mismatches in the alignment.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/218

Insertion date
We estimated the insertion date of the complete copies
using the method proposed by SanMiguel and co-workers
[9], which is based on the divergence between the two
LTRs of the copy. Due to the LTR retrotransposon replication cycle, when a new copy inserts in the genome, its two
LTRs are identical in sequence. As time elapses, the two
LTR sequences accumulate mutations and thus diverge
from each other. This divergence can be converted into an
insertion date by the use of a substitution rate, with the
equation: T = D/2t, where T is the time elapsed since the
insertion, D the estimated LTR divergence and t the substitution rate per site per year. The observed divergence
between LTRs was corrected for homoplasy using the
Jukes and Cantor model [52] and the substitution rate
that we used was 1.3 10-8 substitutions per site per year, as
proposed by Ma and Bennetzen [53] after calibrating the
substitution rate of the adh genes [54] to rice LTR retrotransposons. This divergence was calculated only for copies where at least 100 bp could be aligned between the two
LTRs. For the copies lacking at least one LTR, we could not
use this method. Therefore, we estimated their insertion
date as follows: we used all the truncated copies as query
against all the complete copies using a Blaster search. Each
truncated copy was therefore coupled to the complete
copy with the best match, and the insertion date of this
complete copy was used to estimate the insertion date of
the truncated one. When the best score was shared by
more than one complete copy, the date of the truncated
copy was estimated only if the LTR divergence (i.e., the
age) of the oldest and youngest of these matching complete copies did not differ of more than 1%, to ascertain
that these complete copies originated from the same
amplification burst. This procedure allowed us to purge
any fragments that originated from recombination events
involving two copies with different insertion times. In this
case, the age taken into account was the one of the youngest copy.

The insertion date of the truncated copies was computed
as follows: the nucleotide divergence between the truncated copy and the best matching complete copy was
computed, and compared to the nucleotide divergence
existing between the two LTRs of the complete copy. If
these two copies originated from the same amplification
burst, these two numbers should be similar (Figure 1).
They were considered similar if they did not differ of more
than 1%.
Deletion rate estimates
To estimate the deletion rate, we used the maximum likelihood approach proposed by Petrov et al. [41,42]. This
method is based on the relative ratio of deletions versus
nucleotide substitutions. According to the assumptions
that (1) the rates of deletion and substitution do not vary

Page 12 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:218

over time and (2) at any given time, the number of substitutions and deletions follows a Poisson distribution, a
maximum likelihood estimator can be calculated. The
confidence limits can be found using the χ2 approximation of log-likelihood ratio. A modified version of this
estimator, that corrects for the sizes of the deletions and
the sizes of the sequences in which they occurred, has subsequently been proposed [43]. To compare the two methods, we estimated the deletion rate given by these two
estimators on several samples from different species
including rice (data not shown). Both lead to nearly identical results, indicating that deletion size are small compared to the sequences in which they occur. Considering
this, we performed our final analysis using the uncorrected estimator, because its confidence limits can be easily computed.
Multiple alignments for each family were obtained by first
computing the pairwise global alignment with the reference sequence using the gap program [51], and then stacking all pairwise alignments to obtain a master-slave
multiple alignment. Regions that were not present in the
reference sequence were removed from the multiple alignments, so insertions were not taken into accounts. Finally,
sequences that could not be properly aligned with the rest
of the set were removed. Trees were built using the
PHYLIP 3.5c package [55]. For each alignment, we built a
distance matrix correcting for multiple substitutions with
the Kimura two-parameters model [56]. Neighbor-joining
algorithm was used to build the phylogeny.
From these phylogenies, we extracted only the terminal
forks and not all the terminal branches as in [41,42]. This
improves the methods at several key points: first, any gap
present in the alignment of the two sequences of a fork
has appeared after the divergence of these two sequences.
Therefore, deletions are unambiguously assigned to a
time scale, estimated by the branch length. Second, the
size of the sequence where the deletion occurred corresponds to the size of the pairwise alignment between the
two sequence pairs (excluding parts of the alignment corresponding to terminal gaps), and can therefore be accurately monitored. Third, the divergence time between
these paired sequences being shorter than between
sequences from different terminal branches, deletion estimates are less biased by possible gaps aggregations (over
long time periods, the observation of a large gap could be
the result of one large deletion, or several recurrent deletions of smaller extent).
The a half-life of a sequence was calculated using a continuous decay formula, as in [42]: L = L0exp(-rt), where L is
the length of the sequence at time t, L0 is the length at time
0, and r the product of the average size of a deletion by the
rate of deletions per substitution or per year.
