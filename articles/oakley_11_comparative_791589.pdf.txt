Abstract
Background: Because biotechnological uses of bacteriophage gene products as alternatives to conventional
antibiotics will require a thorough understanding of their genomic context, we sequenced and analyzed the
genomes of four closely related phages isolated from Clostridium perfringens, an important agricultural and human
pathogen.
Results: Phage whole-genome tetra-nucleotide signatures and proteomic tree topologies correlated closely with
host phylogeny. Comparisons of our phage genomes to 26 others revealed three shared COGs; of particular
interest within this core genome was an endolysin (PF01520, an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase) and a holin
(PF04531). Comparative analyses of the evolutionary history and genomic context of these common phage
proteins revealed two important results: 1) strongly significant host-specific sequence variation within the
endolysin, and 2) a protein domain architecture apparently unique to our phage genomes in which the endolysin
is located upstream of its associated holin. Endolysin sequences from our phages were one of two very distinct
genotypes distinguished by variability within the putative enzymatically-active domain. The shared or core genome
was comprised of genes with multiple sequence types belonging to five pfam families, and genes belonging to 12
pfam families, including the holin genes, which were nearly identical.
Conclusions: Significant genomic diversity exists even among closely-related bacteriophages. Holins and
endolysins represent conserved functions across divergent phage genomes and, as we demonstrate here,
endolysins can have significant variability and host-specificity even among closely-related genomes. Endolysins in
our phage genomes may be subject to different selective pressures than the rest of the genome. These findings
may have important implications for potential biotechnological applications of phage gene products.

Background
Concerns over the spread of antibiotic resistances
among bacteria have led to a ban on antimicrobial additives to animal feeds in the European Union (EU) [1,2].
Since its enactment in 2006, the EU-wide ban on the
use of antibiotics in animal feed (Regulation 1831/2003/
EC) has stimulated a renewed interest in bacteriophage

biology and the use of phages and/or phage gene products as alternative antibacterial agents [3,4]. Prior to
the discovery and widespread use of antibiotics, bacterial
infections were commonly treated by administering bacteriophages which were marketed and sold commercially
for human use up until the 1940’s. Bacteriophages continue to be sold in the Russian Federation and Eastern
Europe as treatments for bacterial infections [5].
Recently our laboratory reported the genomic and
molecular biological characteristics of two phages isolated from poultry intestinal material and poultry processing drainage water by screening for virulent

Clostridium perfringens bacteriophages [6,7] and demonstrated efficacy of the lytic proteins encoded by the bacteriophage endolysins as a C. perfringens antimicrobial
[8]. These phages belonged to the Siphoviridae, a family
within the tailed phages. The tailed bacteriophages
belong to the order Caudovirales, have icosohedral
heads, contain a linear, double-stranded DNA genome
that can vary from 17 to 500 kb, and represent ca. 95%
of all the bacteriophages examined by electron microscope [9]. Caudovirales are further divided into three
families based on tail morphology: phages with contractile tails are placed in the Myoviridae, those with short
tails are members of the Podoviridae, and phages with a
long non-contractile tail belong to the Siphoviridae
[10,11].
Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive, spore
forming, anaerobic bacterium that is the 2 nd leading
bacterial cause of foodborne illness in the U.S., accounting for 10% of foodborne illnesses [12]. C. perfringens
can cause food poisoning, gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), enteritis necroticans, and non-foodborne gastrointestinal infections in humans and is a veterinary
pathogen causing enteric diseases in both domestic and
wild animals [13,14]. C. perfringens is considered the
cause of necrotic enteritis among chickens, and although
this does not generally present a threat to humans, it
could potentially become a far greater problem for the
poultry industry and consumers if antibiotics are withdrawn from animal feeds [13,14].
Bacteriophages have evolved a wide variety of antimicrobial compounds that can control C. perfringens
and other pathogens and are of potential biotechnological importance. To realize this potential, it is essential
to have a blueprint of the genomic machinery underlying phage-mediated bacterial lysis. Here we report the
results of comparative analyses based on genome
sequences of four newly isolated C. perfringens phages
and focus on the genomic context and evolution of the
phage endolysin genes.

Results and Discussion
To first determine the whole-genome relatedness of
phages FCP9O, FCP13O, FCP26F, and FCP34O to
each other and to other Clostridial phages, we used two
approaches: correlations of tetra-nucleotide frequencies
and clustering of predicted proteins based on sequence
similarities. The results of both methods were consistent
with each other and demonstrated close genomic relationships among our phages, more distant relationships
to other Clostridial phages, and consistent correlations
between phage and host phylogenies. Our phages were
generally quite closely related - both techniques showed
that the genomes of FCP34O and FCP13O were most
closely related to each other and formed a distinct

Page 2 of 12

group from FCP26F and FCP9O (Figure 1). All four
genomes were similar to the genome of FCP39O, previously published by our research group [6], and
belonged to a larger clade (Figure 1B, 1C) containing
FCPV1, a C. perfringens phage isolated in Russia [7].
Genomic comparisons of our phages to two other C.
perfringens phage genomes (FSM101 and F3626), three
C. difficile-infective phages (FC2, FCD27, and
FCD119), and one C. botulinum-infective phage (FCSt) showed phage phylogeny closely associated with host
phylogeny (Figure 1B, 1C). Our results of nearly identical topologies between tetra-nucleotide and proteomic
trees is consistent with previous uses of tetra-nucleotide
distributions as genomic signatures [15,16] and to infer
co-evolution between virus and host [17].
Core and accessory genomes of Clostridial phages

To determine if our phages contain a common set of
genes shared with other Clostridial phages, we compared predicted ORFs based on classifications of clusters
of orthologous groups (COGs) among the three host
groups shown in Figure 1. COGs represent individual
proteins or groups of paralogs from at least three
lineages corresponding to ancient conserved domains
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/) and thus provide
an informative means to compare conserved functions
across genomes [18].
Three COGs were shared among bacteriophages
infecting C. perfringens, C. difficile, and C. botulinum
(Figure 2). These shared COGs were COG5412, annotated as a phage-related protein of unknown function;
COG0629, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein; and
COG0860, a phage endolysin, N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (Figure 2). Endolysins, together with holins, are the key bacteriophage-encoded enzymes
involved in cell wall degradation and lysis of the host
and are typically transcribed from adjacent ORFs in the
phage genome [8,19-21]. To better understand the evolution and natural variability of an endolysin in its genomic context, we investigated the phylogeny of the Nacetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase across multiple host
genera and compared the phylogeny and host associations to the domain architecture of the endolysin-holin
gene neighborhood.
Statistical associations between domain architecture and
phylogeny

To compare our phage sequences and domain architecture to others, we retrieved amidase sequences belonging to the pfam protein family PF01520 from 26
publicly available bacteriophage genomes (Additional file
1, Table S1) and analysed these as fully described in the
methods. Bacteriophage endolysins typically contain two
domains: an enzymatically active domain and a cell wall

FCP13O, FCP26F, FCP34O, and FCP39O), ‘Other C. perf’: other C.

binding domain, some of which have been elucidated
with crystal structures [22]. We constructed an alignment of both putative domains after building a Hidden
Markov Model from representative sequences in the
Conserved Domain Database belonging to PF01520 and
considering only columns with >10% sequence conservation to eliminate highly variable positions and control
for sequence length heterogeneity.
Several interesting conclusions could be drawn from
these analyses. First, to determine whether there is a significant association between the phylogeny of the amidase protein and the identity of the bacterial host, we
used the UniFrac statistic [23] which assesses unique
versus shared branch lengths by host for the observed
tree relative to a null distribution of host groups randomly permuted within the tree. Significant clustering
by host group was found with both UniFrac (p < 0.001)
and the Parsimony test (p < 0.001) which performs a
similar analysis based on tree topology [24]. The association between phage lytic enzymes and host is wellknown [25]; here we show a strong and statistically significant association between the N-acetylmuramoyl-Lalanine amidase phylogeny and host for a large number
of phages across five host genera (Figure 3).
Second, to better understand the genomic context of
the amidase protein and associated holin genes, we used
the same statistical approaches to formally compare the
association between the domain architecture and phylogeny of the amidase protein. The five phages sequenced
by our group belong to their own clade within the amidase tree and were the only genomes in which the holin

is immediately downstream of the amidase protein in
the presumed direction of transcription, a reversed
arrangement of the typical domain architecture (Figure
3). Interestingly, though F3626, FC2, and FCD27
belonged to a sister clade, this domain architecture was
unique even among these other Clostridial phages (Figure 3). To confirm this domain architecture for our
phages, we re-sequenced the appropriate regions of
F9O, F13O, F26F, F34O, and several other phage isolates, all of which shared the amidase-holin arrangement. Holin genes were identified using multiple
sequence-similarity approaches as described in detail in
the methods, and included identifications of transmembrane domains. The association between gene phylogeny
and domain architecture was strongly significant as
determined by UniFrac (p < 0.001) and P tests (p <
0.001).
Because lysis of bacterial cells generally requires both
an endolysin and a holin - membrane disruption (the
function of the holin) is considered to be requisite for
the endolysin to attack the peptidoglycan [19] - understanding the phylogenetics and genomic context of
these genes are important milestones to develop biotechnological applications. The unusual domain architecture we observed suggests that either the typical gene
order or the reverse is a successful evolutionary strategy.
The transcriptional regulation of these genes in our
phages remains unknown, but searches for transcriptional promoters and terminators using BPROM (Softberry, Inc., Mount Kisco, NY, USA; http://linux1.
softberry.com/berry.phtml) and TransTerm (http://nbc3.
biologie.uni-kl.de) did not find either within the regions
of our endolysin and holin genes; these genes may be
co-transcribed. Efficacy of the endolysin as recently
demonstrated for phages FCP26F and FCP39O [8]
could potentially be improved by successful holin
purification.
Genomic arrangement and context of orthologs

Twenty-one pfam families were identified among the
four phage genomes (Figure 4). Of these, only one,
PF04233, annotated as a homolog of phage Mu protein
gp30, was found in only one genome (FCP13O). Three
other pfams were found in 2-3 genomes and were
absent from the other(s). A prophage antirepressor
(PF02498) was present and 100% identical in the genomes of FCP9O, FCP13O, and FCP26F, but, interestingly, a syntenous protein of FCP34O (gene product 22,
Figure 4), had no significant sequence similarity to these
sequences based on pairwise blastp and no significant
matches to any pfam domains. Similarly, 3’-phosphoadenosine 5’-phosphosulfate sulfotransferase (PAPS reductase)/FAD synthetase (pfam01507) genes were present
in the genomes of FCP13O and FCP34O with 100%

Figure 3 Phylogeny of the phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase, N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase. Sequences represent 31
phage sequences available from IMG retrieved based on annotations of COG0860 or PF01520. Sequences were aligned to a hidden Markovmodel based on representative sequences from cd02696 of the CDD as described fully in the text. Domain architecture is shown by symbols on
outer ringfor genes immediately upstream and downstream of the endolysin. Gene symbols are scaled according to gene lengths and
coordinates as published for each genome. Clade shading scheme represents phage host as shown in the legend; significant associations
between phage host and gene phylogeny were determined by UniFrac statistics based on branch length (p < 0.001) and P-tests based on
topology (p < 0.001).

pairwise sequence similarity, but approximately syntenous ORFs in the genomes of FCP9O and FCP26F had
no significant blastp similarity to COG0175 and did not
match any pfam domains. The majority of pfams (17/
21) were present in all four bacteriophage genomes (Figure 4). Detailed statistics for each genome are shown in
Additional file 2, Table S3.
Conservation and variability of core genome

To investigate shared genes in more detail and to classify
the majority of predicted ORFs which were not assigned
to COGs or pfams, we next compared the distributions
of pfams and sequence-similarity groups derived by

clustering of all predicted ORFs across all four genomes
to determine a core and accessory genome (Figure 5).
Most gene clusters (41/61) were shared by all four genomes on the basis of sequence similarity (Figure 5a). Of
the 17 pfam families that were common to all four genomes, we considered 12 to represent a ‘conserved core
genome’, and five to represent a ‘variable core genome’
based on pairwise sequence similarities (Figure 5b). The
five pfam families in the core genome containing highly
variable genes were: PF01520, the N-acetylmuramoyl-Lalanine amidase (COG0860); PF11753 of unknown function; PF10145, a tail tape measure protein (COG5412);
PF 02511, a thymidylate synthase (COG1351) involved in

nucleotide transport and metabolism; and PF11651, a
P22 coat protein (Figure 5b).
In the conserved core genome, genes within each of
the 12 pfam families were very similar to each other,
with a maximum pairwise sequence difference of 8%
based on amino acid alignments with bl2seq (Figure 5b).
Genes belonging to these 12 pfam families were
involved in the following functions: tail protein, phage
anti-repressor, ssDNA binding, portal protein, minor
structural protein GP20, hydrolase, CHC2 zinc finger,
terminase large subunit, virulence-associated protein E,
and the holin (Figure 5b).
The holin genes were among the most conserved, with
100% identity among all sequences, and the amidase

genes were the most variable (Figure 5b), suggesting
these two genes are subject to very different rates of
evolution despite their colocation in the genome and
paired function in the lytic cycle. Holins target the relatively invariable cytoplasmic membrane, while phage
endolysins recognize and degrade the cell wall, which is
highly variable. It has been suggested that holins may
function as a type of lysis clock, governing the timing of
lysis of the host [26]. As the primary determinant of the
length of the infective cycle, holins can be considered to
experience stabilizing selection as there are opposing fitness advantages to extending the vegetative cycle and
allowing phage replication versus lysing the host to
release progeny phage to infect new host cells [19]. In

variable core genome and boxes in white defined as a conserved core genome.

contrast, the phage endolysins generally contain an
enzymatically active domain and a cell-wall binding
domain which recognizes highly-specific ligands on the
host cell surface [27], and thus each domain is under
strong directional selective pressures. Our data clearly
show strong sequence conservation of the holin protein,
and very distinct sequence types within the associated
amidase for a group of closely related phages.
Detailed sequence comparisons of variable core genome
and association with host genotype

For the four pfam families with known functions in the
variable core genome, multiple-sequence alignments of
the four genomes presented here and FCP39O
sequenced previously by our group [6] revealed some
striking differences in amino acid length and content.
For all four proteins, two very distinct sequence types
were represented.
For the amidase, FCP39O and FCP34O were most
closely related and clearly distinct from the sequence
types of FCP9O, FCP13O, and FCP26F (Figure 6a).
The N-terminal portion of the protein from amino acid
residues 1-166 of the multiple sequence alignment was
the most variable portion of the protein (Figure 6a), and
corresponds within approximately 5 residues to the
enzymatically active domain (EAD) determined structurally and experimentally [22] for the endolysin from

Listeria phage 2389 (NC_003291). The C-terminal portion of the protein, corresponding to the cell wall binding domain (CBD) of Listeria phage 2389 is more
conserved than the EAD in our phages (Figure 6a).
The tape measure proteins (PF10145/COG5412) of
FCP26F, FCP9O, and FCP39O were all 780AA long
and 96% similar to each other and quite different from
those of FCP13O and FCP34O. The tape measure proteins of FCP34O and FCP13O were 95% similar to each
other, but only 473AA residues in length with a 225 AA
N-terminal portion of the protein encoded by another
ORF immediately upstream in the genome. For the portion of the protein encoded by a single reading frame,
alignments of these five sequences revealed a deletion of
89 residues in the tape measure proteins of FCP34O and
FCP13O (Figure 6b). Whether these represent gene fissions or fusions, or insertions or deletions relative to the
ancestral state remains unknown, as do the consequences
for the structure and function of the protein, but clearly
these questions warrant further study.
For the thymidylate synthase (PF02511/COG1351), the
phage relatedness patterns were the same as for the tape
measure protein, with FCP34O and FCP13O containing a similar genotype distinct from that of FCP9O and
FCP39O, largely defined by a variable region from residues 93-139 (Figure 6c). Similarly, the P22 coat proteins
(PF11651) of FCP13O and FCP34O were distinct from

those shared by FCP9O, FCP26F, and FCP39O (Figure
6d).
In contrast to these groupings, genomic fingerprints of
the C. perfringens host based on rep-PCR defined three
main host groups: 1) Cp34O and Cp9O, 2) Cp13O and
Cp39O, and 3) Cp26F as a more distantly related group
(Figure 6e). Interestingly, the single gene phage similarities
based on the tape measure protein, the thymidylate
synthase, and the coat protein reflected the whole-genome
groupings shown in Figure 1 with FCP13O and FCP34O
most similar to each other and FCP9O, FCP26F, and
FCP39O forming a separate group. In contrast, sequence
similarities based on the amidase protein were not concordant with the other genes in the core genome or the
whole-genome clustering. Based on these data, we concluded that the selective pressures on the amidase genes
for these phages are somehow unique from the rest of the
genome. This result may have important implications for
potential biotechnological applications in which amidase
proteins are used separately or together with other gene
products such as holins for bacterial control.
Endolysin protein structure

To investigate the association between the sequence
variability of our phages and the structure of the EAD
and the CBD of the amidase, we constructed a structural model using as a template a related structure from
a Listeria phage (PDB; 1XOV) previously solved with
crystallography [22]. Comparative modelling of bacteriophage lytic enzymes is becoming a common tool to
inform the development of phage lysin-based biocontrol
agents [28]. N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases are
one of at least six types of phage endolysins and attack
the amide bonds between the amino sugar MurNAc and
L-Ala of the cross-linking peptide stem in the peptidoglycan layer of the host cell wall [21]. The specificity of
the enzyme is thought to be due to recognition of specific ligands on the host cell surface by the CBD [21]. Our
modeling revealed that the enzymatic core is formed by
a twisted, six-stranded b-sheet flanked by six helices
(a1-a6) linked through a loop region to the cell wall
binding domain which consists of two anti-parallel bsheets (Figure 7). The areas of highest sequence conservation were concentrated in the CBD and the central
portion of the enzymatic domain (Figure 7). Several
point mutations within the CBD may contribute to its
specificity, but interestingly, for our phages, the N-terminal EAD was much more variable than the CBD, suggesting much higher diversifying selective pressures on
this portion of the protein.

previously published has provided new insights into
genomic conservation and variability. Sequence and
structural variability of the endolysin EAD may have
important implications for the potential to target specific strains of pathogenic bacteria. Sequence and structural conservation of the CBD suggests the potential to
tailor specificity for detection and differentiation of target cell populations, extending previous work [29]. Holins and endolysins represent conserved functions across
divergent phage genomes and, as we demonstrate here,
endolysins can have significant variability and host-specificity even among closely-related genomes. Endolysins
in our phage genomes may be subject to different selective pressures than the rest of the genome, with important implications for potential biotechnological
applications of these phages and their gene products.

Methods
Bacteriophage Genome Sequencing

Purification and propagation of bacteriophages and subsequent genomic DNA purification was carried out as
previously described in detail [6]. Sequencing of the bacteriophage genomes was completed by MWG Biotech,
Inc High Point, NC by Sanger and pyrosequencing to
14-fold redundancy that included primer-walking to fill
gaps.
Genome Annotations and comparisons

Gene predictions and genome annotations were performed with the IMG pipeline [30], which uses a combination of Hidden Markov Models and sequence
similarity searches. Briefly, gene predictions were performed with GeneMark [31] and then compared to
COG PSSMs obtained from the CDD database [32],
searched against the KEGG genes database [33] with
BLASTp, and then searched against the Pfam [34] and
TIGRfam [35] databases using BLAST prefiltering and
subsequent comparison to HMMs using hmmsearch
[36]. To compare the phylogeny and protein domain
architecture of phage-encoded endolysin and holin
genes, genomes of 26 bacteriophage were retrieved from
IMG (Additional file 1, Table S1) based on top ortholog
hits to COG0860. Genome accession numbers and basic
summary statistics are shown in Additional file 1, Table
S2. Gene predictions, annotations, and genome coordinates are listed for each genome in Additional file 2,
Table S3.
Tetra-nucleotide distributions for Clostridial phage
genomes and correlation coefficients between genomes
were calculated with TETRA [37]. Correlation coefficients were transformed to a dissimilarity matrix for
tree construction using the hierarchical clustering algorithm hclust in R [38], which was also used to generate
dendrograms and visualize tetra-nucleotide distributions.

Figure 7 Three-dimensional structures indicating amino acid conservation for Clostridium bacteriophages FCP9O, FCP13O, FCP26F,
FCP34O, and FCP39O. Percent sequence conservation among the five phages is shown from highest 100% (red) to lowest 60% (blue) for
cartoon (A) and surface based (B) models. Dashed circles illustrate the putative enzymatically-active domain (EAD) and the putative cell-wall
binding domain (CBD). Low sequence conservation represents regions under high diversifying selection, primarily in the enzymatically-active
domain.

Proteomic comparisons of Clostridial phage genomes
was performed with a custom analysis pipeline we constructed using CD-HIT [39] for clustering of predicted
ORFs. Output was parsed with a series of perl scripts,
and dendrograms constructed in mothur [40] using the
Jaccard similarity index. COG and pfam designations
from IMG for each genome were used to determine
shared and accessory functions across the 12 Clostridial
phage genomes. To construct genome maps, annotated
genome files were transferred to Artemis [41] and

genome maps constructed with DNA Plotter [42]. repPCR of host genomes was performed as previously
described [43].
Tree construction

Bacteriophage endolysin sequences belonging to
COG0860 and/or PF01520 were retrieved from IMG
and Genbank genomes using BioPerl. A seed alignment
of 100 representative sequences belonging to conserved
domain cd0269 in the CDD (10) was used to build a

Oakley et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:282
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/282

Hidden-Markov profile and the phage sequences shown
in Figure 3 were aligned to this HMM model using
Hmmer 3.0 (14). Aligned sequences were imported into
ARB [44] where trees were constructed with neighborjoining and maximum-likelihood methods restricted to
columns sharing at least 10% sequence identity. When
identical topologies were obtained with both methods,
tree files were exported and visualized with ITOL [45].
The significance of associations between phylogeny and
host, and phylogeny and protein domain architecture
was assessed with UniFrac [23] and Parsimony tests
[24], which use a Monte Carlo approach to compare
observed phylogenies with a null model derived from
random permutations.
Designation and comparisons of core versus accessory
genomes

Shared and unique genes, COGs, and pfams were determined by two methods. First, the same analysis pipeline
described above was used to group predicted ORFs on
the basis of sequence similarity as determined by CDHIT [39]. Second, classifications from IMG were used to
determine shared and unique COGs and pfam families.
The similarity of genes belonging to each pfam family in
the core genome was determined by pairwise blastp
implemented with the bl2seq algorithm in a perl script.
Structural Modeling

The 3D structure of the endolysin from FCP26F
(ORF22, pfam01520) was modeled using the HHpred
server with default settings [46]. Briefly, the HHpred
method is specialized in remote homology detection
using hidden Markow models (HMMs) built from PSIBLAST profiles and secondary structures. The crystal
structure of Listeria PlyPSA (Protein Data Bank code
1XOV chain A, [22]) was used as a template since it
had the highest sequence and secondary structure
scores. Lastly, a 3D model was generated using MODELLER [47] and visualized using the UCSF Chimera
molecular analysis program [48]. Sequence conservation
among our five phages was calculated using the mavPercentConservation method based on the AL2CO algorithm [48] which performs calculations in two steps.
First, amino acid frequencies at each position are estimated and then the conservation index is calculated
from these frequencies. The results were then mapped
to the predicted protein structure of FCP26F using the
following color parameters: lowest (60%) and highest
(100%) sequence conservation.
