Comparative genomics of VirR regulons in
Clostridium perfringens strains
Antonio Frandi1, Alessio Mengoni1, Matteo Brilli2*

Abstract
Background: Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium causing severe diseases such as gas
gangrene and pseudomembranosus colitis, that are generally due to the secretion of powerful extracellular toxins.
The expression of toxin genes is mainly regulated by VirR, the response regulator of a two-component system. Up
to now few targets only are known for this regulator and mainly in one strain (Strain 13). Due to the high genomic
and phenotypic variability in toxin production by different strains, the development of effective strategies to
counteract C. perfringens infections requires methodologies to reconstruct the VirR regulon from genome
sequences.
Results: We implemented a two step computational strategy allowing to consider available information
concerning VirR binding sites in a few species to scan all genomes of the same species, assuming the VirR targets
are at least partially conserved across these strains. Results obtained are in agreement with previous works where
experimental validation of the promoters have been performed and showed the presence of a core and an
accessory regulon of VirR in C. perfringens strains with three target genes also located on plasmids. Moreover, the
type E strain JGS1987 has the largest predicted regulon with as many as 10 VirR targets not found in the other
genomes.
Conclusions: In this work we exploited available experimental information concerning the targets of the VirR toxin
regulator in one C. perfringens strain to obtain plausible predictions concerning target genes in genomes and
plasmids of nearby strains. Our predictions are available for wet-lab researchers working on less characterized C.
perfringens strains that can thus design focused experiments reducing the search space of their experiments and
increasing the probability of characterizing positive targets with less efforts. Main result was that the VirR regulon is
variable in different C. perfringens strains with 4 genes controlled in all but one strains and most genes controlled
in one or two strains only.

Background
Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive anaerobic
species able to form heat-resistant endospores and to
live in many habitats, from marine sediments to animal
gut, to soil. The genus Clostridium comprises species
causing severe diseases such as botulism, tetanus, gas
gangrene and pseudomembranosus colitis that are generally due to the secretion of powerful toxins. C. perfringens is the most prolific toxin producer within the
genus; several of its extracellular toxins and enzymes
have been identified as for instance a-toxin (plc, phospholipase C), b-toxin (hemolysin family toxin), -toxin,

θ-toxin (pfoA), -toxin (colA, collagenase) and others.
Toxins are thought to act synergistically in the development of pathogenesis, and C. perfringens strains show a
high degree of phenotypic and pathogenic variability, so
that understanding the control of the expression of
toxin genes is critical to help in fighting diseases caused
by this bacterium. The identification of similarities and
differences in the set of pathogenic instruments (i.e.
genes) of different strains will help to define effective
strategies of infection control.
Pathogens usually have precise control mechanisms
for toxin production so that expression only takes place
when required e.g. when the density of the bacterial
population overcomes a certain threshold, or when the
bacterium reaches a certain cell-type/organ.

In bacteria, quorum sensing and environmental signal
detection and transduction depend on the activity of
dedicated two component systems consisting of a membrane bound sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. The kinase activity of the sensor is activated by
specific signals, triggering phosphorylation of the cognate response regulator. The phosphorylated regulator
then actively changes gene expression of its target genes
through binding of specific DNA motifs [1]. In C. perfringens a major role in integrating environmental signals with virulence competes to the two-component
VirR/VirS system, where VirR is the response regulator
and VirS the membrane anchored sensor protein [2]
(figure 1a). The first VirR regulated promoters have
been located upstream of toxin genes [3] and subsequent works showed that VirR target sequences are
formed by a pair of imperfect direct repeats, separated
by 7-8 nucleotides (depending on how the repeat is
defined) [4]. These repeats are known as VirR box1 and
VirR box2 (VB1 and VB2) and are located within a core
region of about 50 base pairs located immediately
upstream of the -35 element of the promoter of regulated genes. The two VirR boxes are both required for
VirR mediated transcriptional activation, and mutation
of either of them drastically reduces the expression level
of target genes. The binding of VirR to its boxes is
required for the efficient positioning of the RNA polymerase to the promoter. Furthermore in all the
upstream regions of genes directly regulated by VirR,
the two boxes are in the same relative position with
respect to the promoter and are on the same face of the
helix. DNA spacing and helical phasing play a crucial
role in the transcriptional activation by VirR, as demonstrated by the insertion or deletion of 5 base pairs in the
region between VB1 and VB2 that displaces them on
opposite faces of the DNA double helix: in this situation
a pronounced reduction of the expression level of genes
controlled by VirR was observed [5].
The VirR/VirS regulatory network is not only involved
in direct control of toxin encoding genes (figure 1a), but
also of several other genes such as hyp7 (vrr) a gene
encoding a regulatory RNA (VR-RNA) which controls
the rate of transcription of colA, plc, ptp (protein tyrosine phosphatase) and cpd (encoding 2’,3’-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase) [6]. A recent paper dealing with
the in silico identification of VirR regulated promoters
in C. perfringens str. 13 followed by experimental validation, allowed to identify additional direct VirR targets,
namely virT, virU and ccp (a-clostripain gene) [7]. The
former two genes are particularly interesting because
they are regulators of gene expression. Two genes only
appeared to be controlled by virT (pfoA and ccp), while
virU is active with respect to pfoA, ccp, hyp7, and virT.
A mutational analysis revealed a clear parallel with what

Page 2 of 10

observed for hyp7, because the gene expression level of
their targets is unchanged in virT or virU nonsense
mutants, with respect to the wild-type, allowing to conclude that the functional forms are the virT and virU
RNA [7]. Moreover, three additional genes regulated by
VirR and coding for hypothetical proteins, were found
in different C. perfringens strains: CPF_1074, CPF_0461
in C. perfringens ATCC13124 and CPR_0761 in C. perfringens SM101 [8]. It is now clear that the two component VirR/VirS system is at the top of a hierarchical
regulatory cascade where it directly stimulates the transcription of several virulence-related genes including
three different regulatory RNAs that are in turn able to
control several other genes [6]. Because of the large heterogeneity in toxin production by C. perfringens strains
[8], it is interesting to define the genes belonging to the
direct VirR regulon in closely related genomes to assess
the degree of evolutionary conservation of the VirR regulon. This could also clarify the evolutionary patterns
that are at the basis of the divergence between these
strains from a common ancestor. However the experimental strategy cannot be easily implemented for all
strains, so that it is necessary to integrate information
from different strains in a bioinformatics protocol. In
this work we extend the bioinformatic approach of [7]
to scan the genomes and plasmid sequences of all available genomes of C. perfringens strains (Table 1), and
identify genes that are putatively controlled by the VirR/
VirS system. We implemented a two step strategy allowing to consider information concerning VirR binding
sites in all these genomes and defining the core (evolutionary conserved) and accessory (strain-specific) VirR
regulons in different strains. Results obtained could help
to better define strategies for pathogenicity studies and
control strategies in C. perfringens and can moreover be
used to design focused wet-lab experiments.

Results and Discussion
Comparisons of C. perfringens strains

As a preliminary analysis we studied the variability of
the selected genomes using both standard phylogenetic
techniques and a comparison of all intergenic sequences.
The alignment of rrnA operons for a total of 4719 nt
was used to build a Neighbor-Joining tree revealing that
these strains are closely related [Additional file 1: panel
a]. In agreement with a low differentiation on ribosomal
operon sequences, bootstrap support for the branching
pattern was quite low; in fact, 32 variable sites only
were found in the alignment, which were evenly distributed between strains [Additional file 1: panel b]. However, the comparison of a large number of intergenic
sequences extracted from the genomes revealed that
some of them are quite variable between the different
strains with respect to the very conserved rrnA operon

step strategy that allowed to use information coming mainly from a single strain to do the predictions on all other strains in a less biased way.
In the first step a position weight matrix (PWM) calculated from a limited number of experimentally validated motifs is used to scan the
genomes and to make a list of possible targets. Within that list we looked for sequences corresponding to known targets using clustering, we
retrieved their motifs and we obtained a second PWM. This includes the variability of the motif in several strains and was used for the final scan
of the genomes.

Regulon prediction in sequenced C. perfringens strains

The presence of VirR and VirS sequences was checked
in all strains using blast and the functionally characterized sequences of Str. 13 as queries. We found that they
are indeed both present in all strains and that they are

moreover always organized in what resembles a bi-cistronic operon with the two genes often overlapped (data
not shown). We scanned available C. perfringens genomes using the VirR position weight matrix (PWM)
derived from experimental observations, following the
procedure reported in figure 1 (see Methods for details).
At the time we performed this analysis (April, 2009), the
NCBI microbial genome database stored three different
complete genomes for C. perfringens corresponding to
strains 13, ATCC 13124 and SM101, plus the draft genomes of five strains (ATCC 3626, JGS1721, JGS1987,
F4969, JGS1495) in the form of whole genome shotguns
(Table 1). Despite the higher probability of errors in
gene assignments characterizing draft genomes, we
decided to include them to expand the scope of our
genomic comparison. A whole genome scanning was
performed using a PWM derived from the region comprising several experimentally validated VirR binding
sites [7,8]. A new PWM was generated from the targets
identified in the first scanning by using 30 motifs found
in the promoters of genes that are orthologous to
known targets and then used for a second genome scanning. In this way we avoid the biases that affect the first
matrix, obtained from only a few sequences mainly
coming from one strain. After our two-step strategy, we
collected all genes with a motif scoring more than 0.88,
which is the lowest value observed for an experimentally
tested VirR target gene (corresponding to gene
CPF_1074, [8]). At this threshold we retained at end 53
occurrences of the VirR motif. Analysis of their location
with respect to the start codon of the downstream coding sequence revealed thet most of them are at around
100 bp from the beginning of the gene (figure 2). The

Figure 2 Distribution of distances from gene. The distance of the motifs with respect to the translation start site (x-axis) is shown. Motifs are
grouped by homology of the downstream gene (cluster identifier is on the y-axis). Most of the targets are located in the first 200 nt from the
start of the gene, but some of them (and notably several corresponding to characterized ones) are located at larger distances. Red circles
correspond to orthologous groups from Table 2.

larger distance observed for some of the motifs may be
due to longer 5’ untranslated regions or may account
for some different level of regulation for those genes.
The list of genes putatively regulated by VirR was
splitted in three different groups after clustering similar
sequences (see Methods), by defining the: i) conserved
VirR regulon as formed by chromosomal genes retrieved
in at least two different genomes; ii) the accessory regulon with chromosomal genes present in a single strain;

The conserved VirR regulon

The conserved regulon (Table 2), appeared to contain all
known target genes [7,8] with the exception of CPR 0761
and virT. The former can be identified in the genome of
strain SM101 only, while the latter has been found in
strain 13 and ATCC3626; in both cases we were able to
identify a VirR binding motif in their promoter (Table 3).

Genes identified as VirR targets that are present in a single strain. Strain JGS1987 suggests an expansion of the VirR regulon. †: draft genomes.

Frandi et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/65

One target only appeared to be conserved in all tested
strains, corresponding to the a-clostripain gene. Four
genes were shown to be conserved in all strains but
SM101. Interestingly, strain SM101 appeared to have
the lowest degree of conservation of VirR targets. A
search for the corresponding gene sequences in the genome confirmed that they are absent, in agreement with
a previous comparative analysis that showed the absence
of several virulence factors and toxins and the presence
of specific repertoire of genes encoding bacteriocins [8].
On the converse, missing genes in draft genomes cannot
be considered as surely absent. Concerning CPE0920
(virU) and CPF_1074, corresponding to a regulatory
RNA encoding gene and to a gene with unknown function respectively, they have not been identified in some
of the genomes, but using their sequences we were able
to identify regions with perfect matching using blastn
(data not shown) and to locate VirR motifs in their
upstream regions (see Table 2). Myers et al. [8] showed
that purified VirR is able to bind the promoter of
CPR_0761 and of CPF_0461. From our analysis it
emerged that CPF_0461 in str. ATCC1324 is the ortholog to CPR_0762 in str. SM101, for which too we predicted the presence of a VirR binding motif upstream.
This motif is the same attributed to CPR_0761 and
whose ability to bind VirR has been tested by Myers et
al., 2006. Our comparative analysis, then suggests that
the truly regulated gene could be the latter, because of
the conservation of the site upstream of its homologs in
two other organisms (ATCC3626 and ATCC1324),
while we were not able to find sequences resembling
CPR_0761 in any other C. perfringens strain by blasting
both protein and nucleotide sequences against their genomes. Alternatively, the two genes can also form an
operon, with CPR 0761 performing an unknown
function.
The accessory VirR regulon

We consider this dataset low confidence for two reasons: first of all this group of genes comprises only one
experimentally verified target, i.e. virT (CPE0845, [7])
and moreover, all other genes have been found in draft
genomes only. The list of all putative targets of VirR is
shown in Table 3.
Notably, JGS1987 is characterized by an expansion of
the VirR predicted regulon, while the accessory regulon
of ATCC3626, F4969 and SM101 strains is composed of
a single gene. The case of virT, a regulatory RNA, is
particularly interesting. This sRNA implements a negative feed-back loop on some of the VirR targets i.e. pfoA
and ccp [7]. Our analysis showed that virT is present in
two strains only (strain 13 and strain ATCC3626). We
can thus predict that the other strains lack this negative
control and express pfoA and ccp at different levels
eventually by using additional regulations. Actually,

Page 6 of 10

strains as ATCC 13124 produces large quantities of
gangrene-associated toxins [9] and JGS1987 is a Type E
strain which, tough containing an enterotoxin gene
(cpe), did not show enterotoxin production [10]. The
relatively large predicted regulon (10 genes) of JGS1987
may contain genes responsible for its peculiar pathogenicity profile. Within such regulon seven genes code
for proteins of unknown function. One of them corresponds to a resolvase/recombinase (AC3_0180) suggesting a possible scenario in which host invasion is linked
to gene mobilization. The other two genes with assigned
function in the putative regulon of strain JGS1987
include a 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase and a putative
lipid A export permease. The first one has been associated with resistance to oxidative stress in C. perfringens mutants after transposon mutagenesis [11].
Concerning the putative permease of lipid A, it is
known that lipid A is one of the main mediator of bacterial pathogenesis and strongly stimulates in ammation
in host tissues [12], so that our prediction is reasonable.
The ‘mobile’ VirR regulon

Our analysis identified three targets located on plasmids,
one coding for -toxin (pCP8533etx_p28) in plasmid
pCP8533etx from strain NCTC 8533B4D, in addition
with two hypothetical proteins, sharing 98% identity, in
pCP8533etx (pCP8533etx_p40) and in pCPF5603
(pCPF5603_50) of strain F5603, respectively. Concerning
plasmid pCP8533etx, we noticed that it is also present
in the shotgun sequences from ATCC3626 (data not
shown based on blastn comparisons) and also in that
case we were able to find a VirR motif upstream of the
gene encoding -toxin.
Plasmid analysis

Plasmids can be transferred between species, and gene
content similarities between plasmids can be used to
trace gene flow between different strains. To evaluate
evolutionary relationships relating plasmids from C. perfringens species, we performed an analysis to quantify
the number of genes shared by each pair of plasmids.
For this reason, we built the phylogenetic profiles of the
proteomes encoded by plasmids in these strains. The
phylogenetic profiles for each group of proteins were
obtained by comparing all those proteins one against
each other with the package Blast2Network [13]. A phylogenetic profile, or phyletic pattern, is represented by a
matrix where each row corresponds to a plasmid molecule and each column to a given protein family. The cell
at the intersection between row i and column j indicates
the presence of a component of protein family j in plasmid i. A phylogenetic profile can be thus interpreted as
a graph with two types of nodes: those corresponding to
plasmid molecules are connected to nodes of protein
families if the corresponding plasmids contains the gene

Frandi et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/65

encoding that protein. These matrices can become very
large when many plasmids and proteins are involved, so
that their analysis and biological interpretation is difficult. A strategy for dimensionality reduction can be
through deletion of nodes corresponding to protein
families and connection of plasmids directly, through
edges that reflect the number of shared protein families
(see [Additional file 2] for a scheme). The obtained
hypergraph is reported in figure 3, where plasmids are
connected by links weighted on the basis of the number
of common genes. A group of four connected plasmids
(i.e. sharing several genes), including pCP8533etx and
pCPF5603, was found. This finding is in agreement with
previous data showing that plasmids pCPF5603 and
pCP8533etx evolved from insertion of mobile genetic
elements carrying enterotoxin or etx genes, respectively,
onto a common progenitor plasmid [14]. This group of
plasmids is connected to a second group, composed of
three plasmids (plasmid 1, plasmid 2 and pBCNF5603)
through a bridge represented by pCP13. This implies
that pCP13 shares different genes with plasmids from
both groups i.e. it may be considered as an evolutionary
link between the two groups, one including plasmids
with putative VirR targets and the other one with no
targets. Plasmids pCP13 and pBCNF5603 seem to have
acquired regions from different sources during evolution. Interestingly pCPF5603, belonging to the first
group, and pBCNF5603 have been isolated from the
same strain, but do not share common regions. The

Page 7 of 10

gene encoding the enterotoxin (cpe) is only present in
pCPF5603 and pCPF4969 and the link from pCP13 to
pCP8533etx and pCPF5603 comprises the gene encoding b-toxin. These data confirm and extend the detailed
analysis performed by [15]. They observed that plasmids
pCPF5603 and pCPF4969 share a region of about 35 kb
that it is not present in pCP13. From our analysis it
emerged that the genes comprised in that region could
be conserved also in plasmids pCP8533etx and pCW3.

Conclusions
In this work we exploited experimental information concerning a small number of promoters controlled by VirR
to predict the corresponding regulons in all other C.
perfringens genomes and plasmids available. Our results
are in agreement with previous analysis and suggest that
the size of the VirR regulon is quite variable in the analyzed strains as also evidenced by works showing that
these strains encode different repertoires of toxin genes.
Particularly interesting are the cases concerning vrr,
virU and virT, because they encode regulatory RNA that
affect gene expression of several other genes. Thus, even
at the short phylogenetic distances spanned by these
strains [Additional file 1], there could be significant
changes in the regulatory cascade initiated by VirR. An
event of gain or loss of a VirR target can affect the gene
itself only, such as when the event involves a gene coding for a toxin, or it can spread downstream of VirR
when it involves a regulatory gene, so that also its

plasmid gene content (see Methods for a concise description of the methodology). Values connecting nodes (plasmids) correspond to the
percentage of shared genes with respect to the total number of genes of the two plasmids (Jaccard coefficient) and can be considered as a
measure of relatedness in terms of evolutionary history (common ancestor) and horizontal transfers and recombination. After this analysis, two
groups of plasmids emerged, that are connected through the edge between plasmids pBCNF5603 and pCP13. In the right group of plasmids we
identified some VirR targets. The high similar gene content of some of the plasmids in that group may suggest a high rate of horizontal
transfer/recombination between different strains, so raising the possibility of the transfer of the VirR targets. Moreover, the connection between
the two groups can also suggest that transfers between the two groups of plasmids can happen.

targets will be affected. As an example consider the regulation exerted by VirR on virT in Str. 13 (figure 1a).
This gene is present only in Str. 13 and in Str.
ATCC3626, where it is regulated by VirR. Experiments
have demonstrated that virT encodes a small RNA able
to repress the expression of ccp and pfoA and all these
genes are positively controlled by VirR. The loss/gain of
virT or of VirR binding sites in its promoter will thus
have an impact on its own expression, but this will propagate downstream to ccp and pfoA.
The prediction of VirR targets in the genome of strain
JGS1987 revealed the presence of 10 specific putative
targets that could be important for the peculiar characteristics of this strain.
On an evolutionary perspective, we noticed that once
one gene have been found to be regulated by VirR in one
genome, it is either regulated by VirR in other genomes
or it is lost. This suggests that many of these genes are
useful only when controlled by VirR, and also in this
case, that their function is not essential for pathogenesis.
Then we can imagine that after loss of the VirR binding
site these genes are rapidly deleted from the genome;
alternatively the deletion may involve both the gene and
its promoter. This may happen when the deletion of relatively large genomic regions occurs. Actually, genomes of
C. prefringens strains have been shown to possess many
different genomic islands which may be subjected to frequent events of rearrangemens [8].

Methods
Binding sites identification

To identify motifs corresponding to the binding site of
VirR we devised the following strategy (illustrated in figure 1b). Using experimentally validated VirR targets
(CPE0163, CPE0846, CPE0845, CPE0920, CPE0957 from
[7] and CPF_1074 and CPF_0461 from [8]), we derived a
position weight matrix describing the region encompassing the VirR box 1 and 2, for a total of 34 nucleotide
positions. This matrix was used for a first scanning of
whole genome sequences. All the motifs identified
upstream of known targets or their orthologs in the other
strains were used to build a second PWM that was used
for a second round of genome scanning to identify candidate VirR targets. Genome scanning was performed with
a sliding window approach from first nucleotide to genome length - L, where L is the motif’s length. Each 34mer was scored using the function proposed in [16]:
Si =

1
L

∑ [2 + log (F )],
2

ij

j

where F ij is the frequency of the i th base at the j th
position. Si is an information-based measure of potential
binding sites. We retained only motifs having a score

Page 8 of 10

larger than or equal to the lowest score for an experimentally validated target, corresponding to a threshold
of 0.88. Each motif found along the genome was then
associated with a gene when located within the region
going from 100 nucleotides downstream to 600 nucleotides upstream of the corresponding first codon and on
the same strand of the motif.
Clustering protein sequences

Protein sequences of candidate targets were clustered
using the MCL algorithm coupled with Blast2Network
[13], whose source code was changed accordingly. Blast2Network performs an all-against-all Blast comparison
of protein sequences, followed by translation of the
results in an adjacency matrix. From here on we changed the B2N code to allow the use of the MCL with a
similarity measure corresponding to the normalized
alignment bit score between homologous sequences:
norm
S ij
=

Sij
Sii

,

where Sii is the maximal score attainable using the ith
query and it corresponds to the query aligned with itself.
The adjacency matrix is normalized to make it stochastic, a prerequisite for the MCL algorithm used to define
clusters of orthologous sequences. The MCL algorithm
simulates flow alternating two algebraic operations on
matrices: expansion of the input matrix (Mout = Min *
Min) models the spreading out of flow and inflation (mij
r
= m ij ). Parameter r controls the granularity of the clustering and it is set to 2.
After these two steps we apply diagonal scaling to
keep the matrix stochastic and ready for the next iteration. Inflation models the contraction of flow, and it is
thicker in regions of higher current and thinner in
regions of lower current. The consequence is that the
flow spreads out within clusters while evaporating inbetween clusters leaving at convergence an idempotent
matrix revealing the clusters hidden in the original adjacency matrix.
Plasmid analysis

Concerning the identification of VirR targets, we analysed plasmids with the same procedure used for genomes. Phylogenetic profiling and the hypergraph
describing the similarity in gene contents of different
plasmid molecules were calculated using the software
Blast2network [13] and visualization with the software
Visone [17]. The phylogenetic profiling technique is
described in detail in several papers, e.g. [18,19] so that
we will not discuss it here in detail, it is enough to say
that by comparing the distribution of different genes in
different plasmids we can quantify the extent at which

Frandi et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:65
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/65

proteins tend to co-occur which is an indication of the
degree of functional overlapping between different proteins. We want to spend some word concerning the
hypergraph shown in figure 3. Let’s suppose to have an
adjacency matrix describing homologies between proteins encoded by several different plasmids. In this
matrix, element m ij corresponds to the similarity
between sequences i and j. However these matrices can
be quite large (i.e. the total number of proteins in the
study set), so that it is possible to apply some dimensionality reduction approach to extract the information
we are interested in. In our case, given the mobility of
genes encoded on plasmids, we wanted to assess the
degree of similarities between them in term of gene content, and to identify the most plausible routes for gene
exchange in the strains under analysis. One way to do
that is to calculate the similarity in the phylogenetic
profiles of each plasmid and then reduce the original
matrix to a new one whose size corresponds to the
number of plasmids in the dataset. In this new matrix,
the values correspond to the similarity in gene content
between every pair of plasmids. Given the binary nature
of phylogenetic profiles calculated by B2N, it is possible
to to quantify the level of similarity between them using
the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Plasmids with highly
similar gene content will then give very tight clusters,
and plasmids in-between different clusters (sharing
some of their genes with plasmids in one clusters and
some other genes with an otherwise unrelated cluster of
plasmids) could be important because they share genes
with different molecules i.e. they could represent preferential routes for the passage of genes between plasmids
that are not in contact.
Alignments and Phylogenetic analysis

The alignment of rrnA operons was performed using the
software muscle [20] with default parameters. The alignment has a total of 4719 nucleotides, 32 of which are
variable, and was used as input to the software mega
[21] to build a phylogenetic tree. The algorithm used
was the Neighbor-Joining with different rates for transitions and transversions and 100 bootstrap replicates.
Comparison of intergenic sequences

The comparison of intergenic sequences was performed
as follows: all intergenic sequences were extracted from
the genome of Str. 13 using gene annotations and were
then filtered for a minimum length of 100 nucleotides,
obtaining 1633 sequences. These sequences were then
blasted against the other genomes. We retained each
first blast hit when the e-value of the alignment was less
then 1E-06. The boxplots shown in [Additional file 1:
panel c] have been obtained for the totality of matches
for a genome.

each plasmids the protein families they code for. By comparing the two
rows corresponding to the two plasmids, by using e.g. the Jaccard
coefficient, it is possible to reconstruct the graph of plasmids, connected
by links that corresponds to the number of shared proteins with respect
to the total number of protein families encoded by these plasmids.
