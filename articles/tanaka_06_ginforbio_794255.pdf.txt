Abstract
Background: Genome databases contain diverse kinds of information, including gene annotations
and nucleotide and amino acid sequences. It is not easy to integrate such information for genomic
study. There are few tools for integrated analyses of genomic data, therefore, we developed
software that enables users to handle, manipulate, and analyze genome data with a variety of
sequence analysis programs.
Results: The G-InforBIO system is a novel tool for genome data management and sequence
analysis. The system can import genome data encoded as eXtensible Markup Language documents
as formatted text documents, including annotations and sequences, from DNA Data Bank of Japan
and GenBank encoded as flat files. The genome database is constructed automatically after
importing, and the database can be exported as documents formatted with eXtensible Markup
Language or tab-deliminated text. Users can retrieve data from the database by keyword searches,
edit annotation data of genes, and process data with G-InforBIO. In addition, information in the GInforBIO database can be analyzed seamlessly with nine different software programs, including
programs for clustering and homology analyses.
Conclusion: The G-InforBIO system simplifies genome analyses by integrating several available
software programs to allow efficient handling and manipulation of genome data. G-InforBIO is
freely available from the download site.

Background
The number of microbial genomes for which sequence
data are available is increasing each year. Currently, complete nucleotide sequences of more than 300 strains are
available in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database (INSD), which includes DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank
[1], and the sequence data are summarized in the portal

site, Genome Information Broker (GIB) [2,3]. Genome
data are composed primarily of annotation and sequence
data, and the large volume of annotation data and long
nucleotide sequences must be integrated for effective
genome research. Such genome data are used for analyses
that include comparisons of genomic structures between
closely related species [4,5], phylogenetic analysis [6], and

detection of ubiquitous [7,8] and species-specific genes
(ORFans) [9,10]. It appears that genomic analyses require
high-capacity computers and many programs to study
multiple long sequences.
Software programs, including Artemis [11], ASAP [12,13],
ERGO [14], and GenDB [15], have been developed to
integrate annotation data and the results of various
sequence analyses. However, a compact and easy-to-use
sequence analysis package is needed by research laboratories outside of genome sequencing centers. Therefore, we
developed the G-InforBIO system, an integrated system
for analysis of microbial genomes that functions as a data
management and sequence analysis program. Herein, we
describe the functions of the G-InforBIO system and illustrate its uses with microbial genome data.

Implementation
System architecture
The G-InforBIO system is programmed in Java
(j2sdk1.4.2_05), which is one of the most widely used
computer languages in bioinformatics [16]. The inputs are
annotation and whole-genome sequence files. Annotation files formatted as a flat file (FF), eXtensible Markup
Language (XML), and tab-deliminated text can be
imported. The genome database is constructed automatically after importing. The database items generated on the
G-InforBIO system are Accession, Feature, Location, Qualifier-key, Qualifier-value, and Whole Sequence. The definitions of these items, except Accession and Whole
sequence, are provided on the International Nucleotide
Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) web site [17].
Terms in the Accession and Whole sequence fields should
be unique to each genome. The Whole Sequence is the
name of a whole-genome sequence file with the extension
wgs, formatted as a fasta file. When an FF is imported, the
whole-genome sequence file is produced automatically.
In the G-InforBIO system database, annotation data are
listed, and annotation data for one gene in a genome are
recorded separately in multiple lines. The lines have a
common term in each Accession, Location or Whole
Sequence field to identify the gene location and the
genome, and each of the lines has specific terms in Feature, Qualifier-key, and Qualifier-value fields respectively
to represent annotation information. Lines can be
extracted using keyword searches by annotation data from
the database in the G-InforBIO system.
Gene and protein sequence data retrieval from the
database
Nucleotide and predicted protein sequences in the database can be retrieved for use by the analysis programs integrated in G-InforBIO. Specific nucleotide sequences can
be cut out with reference to the Location field of the
extracted lines in the database from the whole-genome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/368

sequence files assigned in the "Whole Sequence" field.
The excised nucleotide sequences are complementary,
joined, and partial sequences, whose description styles are
defined in INSDC [17]. Predicted protein sequences are
recorded in the Qualifier-value field, which lines have
translation in the Qualifier-key field in the database. Specific predicted protein sequences encoded by the same
gene locations as the extracted lines are retrieved from
their predicted protein sequences recorded in the database. Sequences in a multi-fasta file are named with line
numbers in the database, followed by Accession, Feature,
and Location fields for each line extracted. If no lines are
extracted in the database, all nucleotide or predicted protein sequences are retrieved. Retrieved nucleotide and protein sequences can be transferred to the analysis programs
in G-InforBIO or be exported as a multi-fasta file. Additionally, locations selected by clicking on the database can
be also retrieved and transferred to the analysis programs
as the same manner.
Sequence analysis
The G-InforBIO system contains nine programs for
sequence analysis. ClustalW [18], BLASTCLUST [19], and
Self-Organizing Map (SOM) [20,21] can be used for clustering analyses based on sequence similarity. BLAST [22],
Blat [23], DDBJ Blast [24], MegaBLAST [25], and Sim4
[26] can be used for homology analyses, and primer3 can
be used for primer design [27]. Results of some of these
programs are displayed as text documents, and it may be
difficult to interpret the data. Therefore, graphical result
viewers were designed to display results of ClustalW [18],
BLASTCLUST [19], SOM [20,21], BLAST [22], Blat [23],
MegaBLAST [25], and Sim4 [26] analyses in G-InforBIO.

Furthermore, results from one analysis program can be
simply utilized for the other analysis programs through a
sequence file. For example, a dataset (fasta file format) of
nucleotide sequence clusters generated by BLASTCLUST
[19] can be imported into ClustalW [18] for phylogenetic
analysis.
Graphical genome viewer (feature Viewer)
The Feature Viewer in the G-InforBIO system can display
maps of two genomes contained in the database. Gene
location and annotation information are retrieved from
the database. There are two Feature View windows, and
each window is composed of the map viewer and the
sequence viewer. In the map viewer, gene regions are represented as pentagons for genes with reference to their
location information, and annotation data of genes
appear in a table in this viewer. In the sequence viewer,
users can browse the nucleotide sequence around a
selected gene by clicking on the map viewer.

Page 2 of 7

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:368

A specific nucleotide sequence selected by users can be
also excised from a sequence as a text file in the Feature
Viewer. Additionally, the selected nucleotide sequence is
translated automatically into six-frame protein sequences.
Retrieved nucleotide and protein sequences can then be
captured and transferred to the analysis programs in GInforBIO.
Download of genomic data from DDBJ
We used the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interface [28,29] in the G-InforBIO system to download FFs
with the extension .seq of genome data from the SOAP
server of XML Central of DDBJ [30] in the GIB [2,3]. FFs
published from GenBank, which have the extension .gbk,
can be imported after they are downloaded manually
from the file transfer protocol (ftp) site [31].

Results
We used the G-InforBIO system to analyze FFs containing
genomic data of two Xylella fastidiosa strains. It was
reported that their genomic differences are limited to
phage-associated chromosomal rearrangements and deletions [32], and their genome structures were compared
with G-InforBIO.
Download and import of FFs
Available genomes, including chromosomes and plasmids, are listed in the Remote DB window of G-InforBIO.
As shown in Fig. 1, target genomes were retrieved from the
list with Xylella as keywords of Organism name, and their

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/368

FFs were downloaded. The X. fastidiosa genome database
were constructed on G-InforBIO by importing 5 FFs
downloaded, including genomes of X. fastidiosa 9a5c (1
chromosome and 2 plasmids) and X. fastidiosa Temecula
(1 chromosome and 1 plasmid).
Keyword searches of genes and retrieving sequences from
the database
Gene annotation information is listed in the Search Entry
window, and imported genome data can be browsed.
From the X. fastidiosa genome database, 216 phage-related
genes on both X. fastidiosa chromosomes were extracted
with keywords of product for the Qualifier-key field and
phage-related for the Qualifier-value field as shown in Fig.
2. Protein sequences encoded by the 216 extracted genes
were directly transferred to the analysis programs.
Graphical viewer for comparative genomics
The retrieved phage-related protein sequences and
genome sequences of two Xylella fastidiosa strains, 9a5c
and Temecula, were analyzed with some analysis programs integrated in G-InforBIO and compared with
graphical result viewers. BLASTCLUST [19], which is
based on the BLAST score-based single-linkage clustering,
was used for identification of similar phage-related proteins between the two strains under the default conditions, and then 111 of 216 retrieved sequences were
assigned to 36 clusters, which respectively encompassed 2
to 7 proteins. The graphical result viewer of BLASTCLUST
[19], which shows the distribution of the clustered pro-

tein coding regions on both chromosomes as shown in
Fig. 3A, revealed that genes for the clustered phage-related
proteins are concentrated in particular locations on each
chromosome. MegaBLAST [25], which is called Alignment
View in the system, is used for alignment across entire
genomes to identify common regions and identified it
many regions common between the two chromosomes.
The graphical result viewer of MegaBLAST [25], which
shows the distribution of regions common between two
genomes as shown in Fig. 3B, revealed fragmentations
and complex inversions in the chromosome structures.
Green dashed lines in Fig. 3B show locations of genes for
phage-related proteins in a cluster, generated with BLASTCLUST, on each chromosome. Interestingly, the clustered
phage-related proteins by BLASTCLUST were encoded
near the ends of the inverted fragments and near deleted
regions on each chromosome. Additionally, six phage-

related DNA polymerase sequences from two strains,
which are encoded near other phage-related protein
genes, were retrieved as shown in Fig. 2 and were aligned
by using ClustalW [18]. Their phylogenetic relationships
were examined by using the neighbor-joining method
[33] with the DNA polymerase sequence encoded by
ORF40 on Xanthomonas oryzae phage OP1 genome [DDBJ:
AP008979] as an out group in G-InforBIO. The capture of
the result is shown in Fig. 3C. They were assigned to three
clusters, which encompassed the 9a5c cluster (two phagerelated DNA polymerases on 9a5c strain chromosome),
the Temecula cluster (three phage-related DNA polymerases on Temecula strain chromosome), and a single cluster (one phage-related DNA polymerase on Temecula
strain chromosome). The 9a5c and the Temecula clusters
were closely related to each other. Thus, it seems that
chromosomal rearrangements and deletions of two Xylella

information, such as predicted coding regions, for specific
genes. Genome data can be constantly updated through
downloads of current data from INSDC [17] by the system.

Conclusion
We developed the G-InforBIO system, which allows seamless handling of genome data from management to analysis. The system is also helpful for interpretation of results
because it provides a graphical view of the linkage of the
data and results of various analyses. The results of analyses, however, depend on the quality of the annotation

New genome analysis tools and algorithms will be developed in the future, and the object-oriented architecture of
the G-InforBIO system will allow integration of programs
constructed in Java or C language. Therefore, we anticipate
that this system will expand to contain additional tools
for genomic analysis. The system allows comprehensive

used to analyze fungal genomes in G-InforBIO.
