Abstract
Background: New Zealand's lesser short-tailed bat Mystacina tuberculata is one of only two of c.1100 extant bat
species to use a true walking gait when manoeuvring on the ground (the other being the American common
vampire bat Desmodus rotundus). Mystacina tuberculata is also the last surviving member of Mystacinidae, the only
mammalian family endemic to New Zealand (NZ) and a member of the Gondwanan bat superfamily
Noctilionoidea. The capacity for true quadrupedal terrestrial locomotion in Mystacina is a secondarily derived
condition, reflected in numerous skeletal and muscular specializations absent in other extant bats. The lack of
ground-based predatory native NZ mammals has been assumed to have facilitated the evolution of terrestrial
locomotion and the unique burrowing behaviour of Mystacina, just as flightlessness has arisen independently many
times in island birds. New postcranial remains of an early Miocene mystacinid from continental Australia, Icarops
aenae, offer an opportunity to test this hypothesis.
Results: Several distinctive derived features of the distal humerus are shared by the extant Mystacina tuberculata
and the early Miocene Australian mystacinid Icarops aenae. Study of the myology of M. tuberculata indicates that
these features are functionally correlated with terrestrial locomotion in this bat. Their presence in I. aenae
suggests that this extinct mystacinid was also adapted for terrestrial locomotion, despite the existence of
numerous ground-based mammalian predators in Australia during the early Miocene. Thus, it appears that
mystacinids were already terrestrially-adapted prior to their isolation in NZ. In combination with recent
molecular divergence dates, the new postcranial material of I. aenae constrains the timing of the evolution of
terrestrial locomotion in mystacinids to between 51 and 26 million years ago (Ma).
Conclusion: Contrary to existing hypotheses, our data suggest that bats are not overwhelmingly absent from
the ground because of competition from, or predation by, other mammals. Rather, selective advantage appears
to be the primary evolutionary driving force behind habitual terrestriality in the rare bats that walk. Unlike for
birds, there is currently no evidence that any bat has evolved a reduced capacity for flight as a result of isolation
on islands.

Background
Only two of c.1100 extant bat species use a true walking
gait when manoeuvring on the ground – the lesser shorttailed bat Mystacina tuberculata of NZ, and the common
vampire bat Desmodus rotundus of Central and South
America [1]. Mystacina tuberculata is the sole surviving
member of Mystacinidae, which is the only living mammalian family endemic to NZ, although its distribution
once included Australia [2]. A second NZ species of
Mystacina (M. robusta) has become extinct c.1967 [3].
Exactly when and from where mystacinids first colonized
NZ is not yet clear, but early Miocene mystacinid fossils
have recently been found in NZ [4,5] and middle Cenozoic Australia has been proposed as their probable source
[4,6]. Desmodus rotundus is a member of the Central and
South American family Phyllostomidae. Mystacinids and
phyllostomids fall within the Gondwanan bat superfamily Noctilionoidea, but molecular divergence dates
indicate that the two families diverged 41–51 Ma [7], and
terrestrial locomotion appears to have evolved independently in Mystacina and Desmodus.
Today, Mystacina tuberculata populations are restricted to
extensive areas of old-growth indigenous NZ forests dominated by Podocarpus, Dacrydium, Agathis and Nothofagus
spp [8]. This bat spends more time on the ground than
any other: up to 40% of its foraging time [9,10] is spent
scurrying with rodent-like agility over tree branches and
the forest floor using its broad, backwards-facing feet and
thick-skinned wrists as points of contact with the substrate. When foraging under leaf litter, humus or snow, it
folds its long ears and often disappears completely, reemerging only sporadically [8,11].
As long-recognized [e.g. [8,9,12-18]], M. tuberculata's consummate terrestrial habits are reflected in numerous
adaptations in its postcranial skeleton including specializations of the wing, foot, leg, spine, and pectoral and pelvic girdles. When moving terrestrially, its wings are furled
tightly in a protective leathery sheath-like portion of the
plagiopatagium. Its reduced pro- and uropatagia enable
free movement of its fore and hindlimbs respectively
[14,15]. Unique secondary talons at the base of the thumb
and toe claws of M. tuberculata increase grip on the substrate, as does a system of adhesive, gecko-like grooves in
its soft, deeply-wrinkled pedal soles [12-15]. Mystacina
tuberculata is an important pollinator of NZ's endemic
parasitic wood rose, Dactylanthus taylorii, the world's only
known ground-flowering plant to be pollinated by a bat
[19].
Previous hypotheses for the evolution of terrestriality in
bats
It has previously been assumed that the specialized terrestrial habits of mystacinids evolved in NZ following their

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/169

isolation there, just as flightlessness evolved rapidly and
independently many times in island birds of NZ and elsewhere [e.g. [20-22]]. In the case of mystacinids, a lack of
native terrestrial mammalian predators in NZ has been
hypothesised to have facilitated evolution of terrestriality
[e.g. [1,9,11,17]]. In the case of Desmodus rotundus, by contrast, the absence of mammalian nocturnal predators and/
or competitors is not regarded as the driving force behind
evolution of terrestrial locomotion; instead, it has been
suggested that a running gait confers an energetic benefit
and hence selective advantage by enabling Desmodus to
chase prey that flee in the middle of a feeding event [1].
Until now there has been little opportunity to test hypotheses for the evolution of terrestrial locomotion in mystacinids. Recently, however, postcranial remains of an
Australian early Miocene mystacinid have been recovered
from the Riversleigh World Heritage Area (WHA), northwestern Queensland. In this paper we describe the distal
humerus of this bat and examine the likely functional
attributes of its elbow based on comparison with morphology of this joint and associated musculature in
Mystacina tuberculata. We discuss the implications of our
findings for the temporal and geographical origins of
habitual terrestriality in mystacinids.

Results
Elbow morphology and implications for locomotion in
Mystacina tuberculata
The morphology of the elbow in bats has long been recognized as a rich source of information, both systematic
[16,23-29] and functional [27,28,30-33]. In particular,
the morphology of the distal humerus has been widely
used to infer flight mode and terrestrial capability in
extinct and extant bats. In Mystacina species, the humeral
capitulum is non-spherical (with its articular surface
delimited laterally and medially by ridges and grooves)
and its articular surface is mostly aligned with the shaft
(Figure 1). This results in a relatively rigid humeroradial
articulation that allows motion only in the anteroposterior plane, and is associated with relatively fast, direct
flight [28,32,33].

However, the medial process (epitrochlea) of M. tuberculata is significantly broader than that of most fast-flying
bats, and its separation from the trochlea and deep scars
for muscle attachment suggest a relatively large muscle
mass and hence the capacity for relatively more manoeuvrable flight [28]. Thus, humeral morphology in M. tuberculata appears to represent a trade-off between the
demands for fast, direct flight and manoeuvrability. This
is congruent with the suggestion of Webb et al. [34] that
the wing morphology of M. tuberculata represents a compromise between different adaptive pressures: i.e. slow,

manoeuvrable foraging flight within dense forest, and
fast, direct commuting flight between forest patches.
Unlike birds, bats use all four limbs for terrestrial locomotion [1]. Not surprisingly, chiropteran elbow morphology
has previously been correlated with terrestrial agility as
well as flight mode; extensive articulation between the trochlea and the radius characterizes not only bats that are
fast, direct fliers but also those that are relatively agile on
the ground [e.g. molossids and some vespertilionids;

[18,32,33,35]]. However, this is not the case in bats that
use a true walking gait, namely species of Desmodus and
Mystacina. Desmodus rotundus retains (plesiomorphically)
a spherical central capitulum and large medial muscle
mass enabling considerable rotational (anteroposterior
and lateral) movement in the elbow joint (Figure 2A).
Mystacina tuberculata, on the other hand, shares with
molossids, for example, a more derived precise and
restrictive bony articulation between the humerus and
radius (Figure 2B, C), but combines this with the special-

ized muscle morphology described below. The very different morphological and myological constraints on the
elbow joint in species of Desmodus and Mystacina is consistent with independent evolution of a quadrupedal
walking gait in these two lineages as proposed by Riskin et
al. [1].
The humerus of M. tuberculata is additionally characterized by a conspicuously laterally inclined humeroradial
articulation (Figures 1, 2B). This humeral specialization
results in a distinctive movement of the radius during
walking because it causes the radius to move in a laterallydirected arc. Video footage [36] and treadmill frames [[1],
Figure 1C, F] of terrestrial locomotion by M. tuberculata
confirm this observation. The humerus is held closely
adducted and parallel with the long axis of the body, and
the radius moves in a plane away from the humerus and
body, never actually coming to lie beneath the body as it
does in most quadrupedal mammals. The characteristic
lateral inclination of the trochlea directs the radius laterally during the stride and pushes the body sideways and
forward, resulting in a scuttling rather than striding movement. With the body held close to the substrate, this style
of locomotion is well suited to moving in confined places,

and presumably also for digging through and under leaf
litter.
The distal spinous process of M. tuberculata is characteristically elongate and represents the distalmost extremity of
the humerus. The direction of flexor muscle action differs
depending on the position of the radius because the distal
position of the spinous process shifts the flexors from the
centre of rotation. When the elbow is flexed, the distal
spinous process forms a wide angle with the radius so that
the distance between the process and the distal wing is
greater. Consequently, the mechanical advantage accrued
by the muscles for flexing the hand is also greater It is possible that during terrestrial locomotion (when the elbow
is half-flexed) the greater distance and moment arm
improves flexion power of the muscles operating the distal carpus which remains flexed. This is congruent with
the general tendency for the extensor and flexor muscles
of the chiropteran hand to act as inelastic cords that automatically move the manus with movements of the forearm in flight [32].
Myology and functional morphology of the humerus of
Mystacina
Myological examination of the forelimb of Mystacina
tuberculata reveals that the morphology of the humerus
reflects specializations in muscular morphology and presumably therefore muscle action. Dissection of the elbow
of M. tuberculata (NMNZ LM 1231) shows that the characteristic deep supraepicondylar groove proximal to the
lateral epicondyle (Figure 1) is occupied by the tendon of
the large M. extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL; Figure 3).
This muscle originates in a strap-like tendon from the posterolateral rim of the groove. The tendon extends across
the lateral surface of the humerus and attaches to the
tubercle on the lateral side of the distal humerus, directly
proximal and slightly posteromedial to the deep tendon
groove. As such, the ECRL tendon inserts markedly medially. A wide portion of the ECRL tendon is lodged within
the humeral groove; anterior to the groove, the body of
this tendon houses a sesamoid. The tendon leaves the
groove through the characteristic cleft before entering a
conspicuously large muscle. The flexor muscles of the carpus and digits and the pronator teres muscle originate on
the medial rim of the distal spinous process. Their medial
origin is displaced distally, which results in a considerable
distance between the flexor muscle origins and the radius,
resulting in a larger moment arm for the flexor muscles.

The ECRL position, with its tendon housed in the conspicuous lateral supraepicondylar humeral groove, is unique
among bats. The origin of the ECRL winds around the lateral side of the humerus and attaches to the posteromedial tubercle; thus, the origin of the ECRL is more medial
than in other bats which may give the muscle slightly

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:169

more leverage on the humerus. The ECRL inserts on the
dorsal base of the first metacarpal and anterodorsal base
of the second metacarpal which it directly extends
[32,37,38] and acts indirectly to extend the entire distal
part of the wing [38]. Because the ECRL is conspicuously
large in M. tuberculata compared to that of other bats [e.g.
[32,33,35,37,38]], its action should result in a powerful
concomitant extension of the first and second metacarpal.
The direction of this motion appears to be tightly constrained because of confinement of the tendon's origin in
the deep humeral groove.
One possible function of this powerful arrangement could
be to facilitate take-off. Mystacina tuberculata launches into
the air from the ground by leaping from a quadrupedal
stance rather than flapping its wings [34] thereby necessitating some levering action of the limbs. The powerful
extending action of the ECRL on the first and second metacarpal, mediated by the pulley-like arrangement on the
groove, would push both metacarpals towards the ground
and lever the bat's body into the air. A similar launching
action is used by Desmodus rotundus which flexes its elongated thumbs to push off from the ground [37,39]. Notably, in M. tuberculata the proximal third of the second
metacarpal is covered by padded toughened skin [also
noted by [17]]. This type of skin also occurs on the dorsal
carpal area – the surface on which Mystacina walks – suggesting that the broad, flattened proximal second metacarpal is also frequently in contact with the substrate.
However, because the metacarpals are normally carried
flexed and off the ground when Mystacina walks [1], it suggests an alternative locomotor role for metacarpal II,
probably in launching.
Humeral morphology in an early Miocene Australian
mystacinid
Australian mystacinids are known from craniodental fossils from deposits ranging in age from 26 to 12 Ma (late
Oligocene to middle Miocene) in South Australia,
Queensland and the Northern Territory [2,6]. Two partial
fossil humeri (Figure 1A–E) from early Miocene (c.20 Ma)
sediments in the Riversleigh WHA, northwestern Queensland (18° 15' 35" S, 138° 06' 41" E) are the first postcranial remains referable to an Australian mystacinid.
Collectively, the morphology, size, provenance and depositional association of the fossil humeri indicate that they
are specifically referable to the early Miocene mystacinid
Icarops aenae, known otherwise from dentaries and upper
and lower teeth from the Riversleigh WHA (see Methods).

The fossil humeri have been identified as mystacinid
because they exhibit the following suite of derived features shared only with M. tuberculata and the recently
extinct NZ M. robusta (Figure 1F–L): distal articular surface
more or less aligned with shaft of humerus and inclined

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/169

laterally with respect to the long axis of shaft; non-spherical central capitulum; long distal spinous process well
separated from the trochlea; broad separation between
central and lateral capitulum; prominent (tall) trochlea;
deep radial fossa; and deep, wide groove, and well-developed tubercle, proximal to the lateral epicondyle. They
differ from Mystacina species in the following less-derived
features: distal articular surface slightly less inclined laterally with respect to the long axis of the shaft resulting from
the greater distal extent of the lateral capitulum and epicondyle; and supraepicondylar groove and associated
tubercle proximal to the lateral epicondyle slightly less
developed. They differ additionally from M. robusta in
being approximately 20% smaller. The tip of the spinous
process is broken off in both Australian fossil humeri; this
tip appears to be more curved towards the trochlea and
the medial profile more convex in M. robusta than in M.
tuberculata.
The presence of a lateral supraepicondylar groove much
like that in M. tuberculata suggests that the ECRL was similarly arranged in I. aenae. It can therefore be expected that
I. aenae had similar capacities of powerful metacarpal
extension. If this arrangement is related to levering the
animal off the ground, as we suggest here, it would be a
strong indication of terrestriality in I. aenae. Furthermore,
although the tip of the spinous process is missing in both
Icarops humeri, the position of its base indicates a medial
position of carpal flexor muscles and pronator teres that
corresponds to that seen in M. tuberculata. Thus, carpal
flexion patterns in I. aenae were similar to those of M.
tuberculata. Lastly, the lateral inclination of the humeroradial articulation, although less pronounced, is similar to
that of M. robusta so that adaptation for a scuttling walk
seems probable. In summary, the humeral morphology of
I. aenae is strongly suggestive of at least facultatively efficient terrestrial locomotion.

Discussion
Origin of mystacinids and their dispersal to New Zealand
Mystacinidae is a member of the superfamily Noctilionoidea, the only one of the four currently recognised extant
bat superfamilies that appears to have a Gondwanan origin [[7,40]; however, see [41]]. Molecular divergence
dates suggest that mystacinids diverged from other noctilionoids sometime between 41 and 51 Ma [e.g. [7,40,42];
[Figure 4]. A gap in the Australian land mammal record
from 55 to 26 Ma [43] means that the early history of
mystacinids in Australia is unknown, but the fossil record
documents their presence as part of the indigenous fauna
for at least 14 million years from 26 to 12 Ma. The oldest
Icarops fossils are currently from the 26 Ma magnetostratigraphically-dated Ditjimanka Local Fauna (LF) of Lake
Palankarinna, South Australia [28°46'30"S, 138° 24'E;
][6,44]. Although they are generally more plesiomorphic

than Quaternary mystacinids, Icarops taxa also exhibit
dental apomorphies of their own, suggesting that the Australian Icarops and NZ Mystacina lineages diverged at least
26 Ma [6]. Mystacinids are also known from the early
Miocene (19–16 Ma) St Bathans Fauna of Central Otago,
South Island, NZ (44°52'S, 169°49'E)[4,45] but as yet
cannot be referred to either lineage.
If the molecular phylogenies and divergence dates for
mystacinids are correct, and the highly derived humeral
morphology shared by Icarops and Mystacina spp does
reflect specialized terrestrial locomotory ability, this represents strong evidence that habitual terrestriality evolved

in mystacinids sometime between 51 and 26 Ma (Figure
4).
The fossil record sheds little light on whether or not NZ
might have been colonized before Australia by noctilionoids, but Australia's Oligo-Miocene mystacinids are
closely related to those of NZ and are less derived, which
may be an indication that Australia was the source of NZ's
mystacinids [6]. NZ began rifting from Gondwana c.82
Ma [46] but separation from eastern Australia of the (now
mostly submerged) Zealandia continental fragment was
not complete until formation of the Cato Trough near
present New Caledonia c.52 Ma [47,48], with a distance

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:169

of c.1600 km now separating the NZ part of Zealandia
from the Australian mainland. Isolated, wind-assisted dispersals by bats from Australia to NZ have been recorded
during historic times [9], and the ancestor of NZ's only
other surviving endemic mammal, the vespertilionid bat
Chalinolobus tuberculatus, probably made this crossing less
than 2 Ma [49]. There are no records of bat dispersals in
the opposite direction, against the westerly winds that
have prevailed since establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current c.35 Ma [50]. For NZ birds, a similar
pattern of colonisation from Australia and rarity of
"reverse traffic" is well-documented [e.g. [51]].
Palaeoecology and extinction of Australian mystacinids
Our data suggest that the terrestrial habits of mystacinids,
at least as expressed in specializations of the humerus,
were established before isolation of the lineage in NZ – in
Australia and in a time and place well-populated by terrestrial nocturnal predators. The latter included rat- to catsized marsupial carnivores such as dasyures (dasyurids),
cat- to leopard-sized marsupial lions (thylacoleonids),
cat- to dog-sized thylacinids, dog-sized carnivorous/
omnivorous kangaroos (species of Ekaltadeta), mouse- to
cat-sized bandicoots (yaralids) and large predatory bats
such as megadermatids, as well as hawks, terrestrial crocodiles, lizards and snakes [[43]; see Methods below].

In NZ, too, at least one group of small terrestrial mammals was present until at least the early Miocene, overlapping temporally and geographically with mystacinids [as
recorded in the 19–16 Ma St Bathans Fauna; [5]], and so
provides further evidence that the evolution of terrestriality in mystacinids did not arise in the absence of non-volant mammals in NZ.
Although it is likely that terrestrial foraging by extant M.
tuberculata makes it vulnerable to introduced mammalian
predators [e.g. feral cats and stoats; [11,52,53]], there is as
yet limited available data on the actual risk of terrestriality. Indeed, Lloyd [8] has argued that although some individuals may be caught while on the ground, mystacinids
would not be easy prey – they are cryptic, fast moving,
with acute hearing and sense of smell, and can quickly
take flight [8]. Based on the evidence presented here, it
seems reasonable to assume that Icarops aenae was similar
to M. tuberculata in these respects. The slightly less-developed morphological humeral specializations in at least I.
aenae, one of four known Australian mystacinid species,
suggest that the terrestrial habits of mystacinids may have
further developed in NZ in the absence of terrestrial mammals but in the presence of falcons, moreporks and laughing owls which were significant predators [54].
In NZ, Mystacina's terrestrial foraging behaviour has been
correlated with its exceptionally broad omnivorous diet

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/169

[9,11,14,15] that is broader than that of any bat recorded
and includes nectar, flowers and fruit as well as flying and
terrestrial invertebrates including spiders, centipedes and
weta orthopterans [9,52,55,56]. An omnivorous diet in
Australian Miocene mystacinids, and in particular I. aenae,
has been been deduced on the basis of craniodental features [6]. For example, the dilambdodont molars of
Mystacina species and I. aenae are typical of insect-eating
bats, while their anterior teeth indicate adaptations for
both frugivory and nectarivory [57,58]. Like other chiropteran frugivores, Mystacina tuberculata and I. aenae have a
greater allocation of tooth area at the anterior end of the
tooth row (individually large teeth accounting for half the
upper tooth row length) than in more insectivorous and
carnivorous species. They also share a reduced number of
lower incisors, a fused mandibular symphysis and large
canines, features that act together to support a quicklymoving, extensible tongue in nectar-feeding bats [58].
Mystacina tuberculata roosts singly or communally in tree
hollows, but also uses its teeth to burrow into fallen trees
to excavate complex roosts [9,15]. It is also known to have
inhabited caves along with M. robusta at times during the
last 15 000 years [59,60]. Large populations occur only in
extensive (>1000 ha) areas of old-growth indigenous forests dominated by species of Podocarpus, Dacrydium, Agathis and Nothofagus and containing many large trees
suitable for such roosts (>1 m girth and >25 m high),
numerous epiphytes and deep leaf-litter [8]. The palaeohabitat of Icarops aenae appears to have been similar: 20
Ma the Riversleigh forests in which it foraged were c.15
degrees further south than the present fossil sites. The Australian climate was cooler and wetter with extensive cover
of Gondwanan forests dominated by species of Nothofagus
(Brassopora type), podocarps, araucarians, myrtaceans and
casuarinaceans [61,62].
What caused the extinction of mystacinids in Australia is
not clear but available evidence suggests that it was probably loss of suitable forest habitat resulting from climate
change. Australian Tertiary mystacinids range in age from
c.26 to 12 Ma [2,6,63], but they are absent from the
diverse bat faunas of Riversleigh's early late Miocene
Encore LF (c.10 Ma; 12 spp) and early Pliocene Rackham's
Roost LF (c.4.5 Ma; 10 spp) [43]. By the late Miocene,
mystacinids seem to have disappeared from Australia
[2,63], perhaps as a result of cooling temperatures and
reduced rainfall which began in the mid to late Miocene.
This climatic change resulted in gradual replacement of
wet Gondwanan-type forests by relatively drier forests,
woodlands and, by mid Pliocene time, grasslands over
much of the continent. Closed forests retreated to the
coastal margins of Australia and it is possible that mystacinids survived there during the late Miocene but they are
not known from Plio-Pleistocene bat faunas in those areas

including, for example, the early Pliocene Hamilton,
Chinchilla and Bluff Downs LFs and the Pliocene Big Sink
LFs, nor from the Mount Etna, Texas, Bucchan, Victoria
Fossil and Mammoth Cave assemblages [64,65]. Increasingly rapid cycles of climate change resulted in pronounced post-Miocene rainforest contraction and
expansion, resulting in further biodiversity loss: the

mammalian familial diversity) since the early to middle
Miocene [66].

terrestrial niche in NZ. Mystacinids appear to have had a
long history as omnivores on Gondwanan forest floors
where mammalian predators and potential prey were
plentiful [43].

Conclusion

In NZ, mystacinids found refuge in cool wet rainforests,
surviving there for at least 16 Ma (other colonizing bat lineages did not fare as well; Hand et al. in prep.). The slightly
less-developed morphological humeral specializations in
at least I. aenae suggest that the terrestrial behaviours of
mystacinids may have further developed in NZ, though in
the presence of avian predators and at least one lineage of
now-extinct non-volant mammals.

Australian Oligo-Miocene fossils suggest that the specialized terrestrial locomotion of mystacinids did not develop
in NZ in the absence of ground-dwelling mammalian
predators and competitors, but that facultatively-terrestrial behaviour in Gondwanan mystacinids may represent
an exaptation for exploiting a predator-"free" nocturnal

Our data suggest that the evolution of terrestrial behaviour in mystacinids may have been driven by selective
advantage or energetic benefit, as has been proposed for
the vampire Desmodus rotundus [1]. There is little doubt
that the exceptionally diverse diet of M. tuberculata has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/169

been facilitated by its extraordinary terrestrial foraging
and burrowing behaviour [9,11,14,15]. Australia's Icarops
aenae also appears to have been diversely omnivorous [6].
An opportunistic approach to feeding may have conferred
a selective advantage for bats inhabiting the high latitude
forests of early Cenozoic Gondwana as well as their survival during later glaciation events in NZ. On-going studies of the seasonal foraging ecology and energy budget of
M. tuberculata [e.g. [67-70]] may provide further clues
about the driving forces underlying terrestriality in mystacinids, as well as any likely trade-off between aerial and
non-aerial locomotion in bats that walk.

Methods

In New Zealand, during the last 750 yrs since the arrival of
people [71], forest cover has been reduced from 78 to
23%, and 31 alien mammal species have become established [72]. These major ecological changes have affected
Mystacina species directly by increasing predation and
competition and indirectly by transforming remnant forest ecosystems [73]. These pressures led to the extinction
of M. robusta within the last 50 years and a precipitous
decline in the population of M. tuberculata from an estimated 12.5 million (pre-human) to c.50 000 today [73].
In the case of M. robusta, mainland populations appear to
have declined rapidly following introduction of Pacific
rats (Rattus exulans) by Polynesians [60], although the last
known populations on Big South Cape Island and adjoining Solomon and Pukaweka Islands were exterminated
following the accidental introduction of ships rats (Rattus
rattus) in 1964 [74].

Additional material
QM F30584, left dentary containing m2 and m3; QM
F24509, right m1; QM F30575, left M1; all from type
locality [6]. A left dentary containing m2 and m3, with
alveoli for c1, p3, p4 and m1, and an isolated left M1,
recovered from Outasite in the Riversleigh WHA, may also
represent this species [Icarops sp. cf. I. aenae; ][6].

For Australia, there is no direct evidence of any mammalian extinctions coinciding with its first colonization by
murids c.5 Ma [75,76], although there is speculation that
the demise of the extinct frugivorous-omnivorous marsupial ektopodontid and numbigilgid lineages may have
resulted [77,78]. The available fossil record suggests, however, it is unlikely that mystacinids survived in Australia
long enough to overlap with rodents.
In the Pacific and globally, bats have reached most oceanic islands, the insectivorous hoary bat Lasiurus cinereus
of the Americas, for example, having colonised the
Galápagos and Hawaiian Islands [79]. Unlike in birds,
where flightlessness has evolved independently many
times in island taxa, such as in Pacific rails [20], there
remains no evidence of loss of flight in any extinct or
extant bat.

Diagnosis
Humerus similar in basic morphology to that of Quaternary mystacinids Mystacina robusta and M. tuberculata but
differs in lateral extension (development of tubercle) of
proximal rim of lateral epicondyle, and less inclined distal
articular surface (with respect to humeral shaft).

The morphology and provenance of the humeral remains
indicate that they are referable to the Australian Miocene
mystacinid genus Icarops (see Comparisons below). At
least two Icarops taxa are represented in Riversleigh sediments (Icarops aenae and I. paradox) and another from Bullock Creek in the Northern Territory (I. breviceps) [2,6,63].
An isolated upper molar from Lake Palankarinna, northeastern South Australia [mystacinid indet.; [6]] also
appears to be referable to Icarops. Other bats represented
in Riversleigh's Oligo-Miocene deposits are: diverse and
abundant hipposiderids (>22 spp), megadermatids (>5
spp), and much rarer remains of molossids (2 spp) and
vespertilionids (1 sp.) [43]. The morphology of the distal
humeri described here differs distinctly from that found in
all other bat families [e.g. [28] Figure 2] except Mystacinidae (see Description and Comparisons below), and the
specimens are most parsimoniously referred to Riversleigh's only known mystacinid genus, Icarops. Comparison with skulls and skeletons of Recent Mystacina spp
indicate that the humerus is also an appropriate size to be
attributed to a species of Icarops.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:169

The fossil humeral remains are specifically attributed to
Icaops aenae because of the depositional association of the
humeral fragment QM F30573 with I. aenae craniodental
remains (QM F30584, a left dentary containing m2 and
m3, and QM F30575, an M1) preserved less than 15 cm
away in a hand-sample of limestone collected from
Wayne's Wok Site in which the dentary was partially
exposed. This association is particularly noteworthy in a
fossil deposit in which bat remains are relatively common
(>1000 specimens) but non-hipposiderids rare (less than
0.5%). QM F30574, a left humeral fragment from View
Delightful Site, is of the same morphotype and size as QM
F30573 and is therefore also referred to Icarops aenae.
Locality and age
Wayne's Wok Site occurs on the western edge of freshwater limestones comprising Hal's Hill, and View Delightful
Site on the southern edge of Godthelp Hill, both part of
the D Site Plateau, Riversleigh WHA, Lawn Hill National
Park, Queensland, Australia [64,80]. On the basis of Riversleigh stratigraphy and faunal assemblages, the Wayne's
Wok and View Delightful deposits have been interpreted
to be early Miocene in age [66,80-83].
Associated fauna and palaeoenvironment
The associated fauna from Wayne's Wok Site includes
lungfish, teleost fish, frogs, chelids, scincids, agamids,
pythonids, typhlopids, crocodylids, birds, pilkipildrids,
acrobatids, petaurids, pseudocheirids, burramyids,
ektopodontids, phalangerids, macropodids, potoroids,
wynyardiids, diprotodontids, palorchestids, yalkaparidontids, dasyurids, thylacinids, perameloids, notoryctids,
megadermatids and hipposiderids. The high diversity of
vertebrates represented in this deposit, together with the
fact that it contains complete skulls of marsupials but only
fragmentary bat material, suggests that these fossils probably accumulated in a pool or lake rather than a cave. The
fauna of the VD deposit is as yet poorly-sampled but
includes a burramyid, koala and palorchestid [43] as well
as hipposiderid bats. Archer et al. [84] give reasons for
regarding early Miocene assemblages at Riversleigh to represent closed forest communities.
Description
The following description of the humerus is based on
both specimens (QM F30573 and QM F30574) except
where indicated. Terminology for humeral morphology
and orientation is given in Figure 1M–O and follows previous workers [28,32,38]. The shaft is only just wider than
deep (anteroposteriorly), and the distal part of shaft is
only slightly flattened anteroposteriorly and curved in a
cranial direction. In QM F30573 the maximum width of
the articular surface is 3.2 mm and that of the shaft 2.0
mm; in QM F30574 it is 3.1 mm and 2.0 mm respectively.
The articular surface is slightly offset with respect to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/169

shaft of the humerus, so that in anterior view (Figure 1A,
D) both the trochlea and the lateral epicondyle rim are lateral to the edges of the shaft. The articular surface is
inclined with respect to the long axis of the shaft (i.e. it is
not perpendicular to the shaft) so that the trochlea is taller
than the lateral epicondyle. The medial process (epitrochlea) is relatively narrow, in width approximately onequarter that of the articular facets. The distal spinous process is well-separated from the trochlea. Its tip is missing in
both specimens but clearly would have extended distally
beyond the trochlea. The trochlea, central capitulum and
lateral epicondyle are all prominent, the trochlea most
prominent. The central capitulum is non-spherical and
occupies less than one-third the width of the articular surface. The central and lateral surfaces of the capitulum are
separated by the capitular groove, and the capitulum and
trochlea separated by the trochlear groove. The trochlear
and capitular grooves are equally deep and slightly
inclined in a lateral direction. The trochlea's medial margin is concave, a ridge extends proximally along the shaft
to enclose medially the deep and broad radial fossa. Posteriorly, the trochlear ridge extends proximally onto the
shaft for a short distance (Figure 1C, F). A broad, shallow
longitudinal depression is bounded laterally by a ridge
that extends 2 mm proximally along the shaft. There is no
depression for articulation with the ulnar olecranon process. At each end of the articular surface is a deep fossa. The
medial fossa is bordered by the trochlear rim anteriorly
and posteriorly by the lateral rim of the medial process
(epitrochlea). The lateral fossa is surrounded by the rim of
the lateral epicondyle. Immediately proximal to the rim is
a broad and deep groove that extends across the lateral
shaft and onto the posterior face of the shaft. This lateral
supraepicondylar groove is bounded by a raised rim
(almost as distinctive as the lateral epicondyle rim) that is
marked proximally by a large tubercle (Figure 1B, E).
Comparisons
The Riversleigh fossil humeral fragments share morphological features with many bat families. A non-spherical
central capitulum and articular surface more or less
aligned with the shaft are characteristics of molossids, vespertilionids, miniopterids, mystacinids, mormoopids and
rhinolophids. In archaeonycteridids, most emballonuroids, most other noctilionoids, hipposiderids and pteropodids, the capitulum is spherical and articulation
conspicuously offset laterally with respect to the shaft. In
myzopodids the articulation is aligned but the capitulum
is spherical.

In the Riversleigh fossil specimens there is a broad separation between the central and lateral capitulum, as in
molossids, mystacinids and miniopterids, and unlike
most other bat groups [e.g. see [28] Figures 3 to 5, and
[85] Figures 7 to 12]. The fossils differ from miniopterids

in lacking a deep groove distally between the central and
lateral capitulum. The Riversleigh specimens also lack the
conspicuous depression for articulation with the ulna on
the posterior surface that is exhibited by most vespertilionids and palaeochiropterygids.

LP0453664 and DP0770660 for Riversleigh WHA fossil research and collaboration by UNSW and NZ researchers, and by Phil Creaser and the
CREATE fund at UNSW.

The medial process (epitrochlea) is wider than in most
vespertilionids and molossids, but not as wide as in palaeochiropterygids, archaeonycteridids, rhinolophoids,
emballonuroids, natalids, most noctilionoids and pteropodids; it is similar in relative width to that in mystacinids, myzopodids and furipterids. The distal spinous
process is well separated from the trochlea, as in most bat
families, but not molossids and vespertilionids. It is also
relatively long (extending distally beyond the trochlea) as
in many bat groups.

References

The radial fossa is deep and the distal part of the shaft is
slightly flattened as in mystacinids, molossids and vespertilionids but not most other bats. Lateral and medial fossae are deep, and the trochlea prominent, as they are in
molossids and mystacinids but not most other bats.
The lateral supraepicondylar groove or depression developed proximally to the tubercle of the lateral epicondyle
is broader and deeper with a more conspicuous rim than
in other bats, with the exception of mystacinids in which,
as in the Riversleigh specimens, it occupies an area equal
to that of the lateral (epicondylar) fossa. In other bat families in which the groove may occur, such as molossids
and vespertilionids, it is conspicuously shallower and
smaller in area [e.g. [32], Figure 6, [85], Figures 7 to 12].
As noted above in Results, the humeral fossils exhibit several derived features shared only with M. tuberculata and
M. robusta (Figure 1G–L).
