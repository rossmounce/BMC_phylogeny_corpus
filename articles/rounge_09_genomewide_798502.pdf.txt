Abstract
Background: Cyanobacteria often produce several different oligopeptides, with unknown biological
functions, by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Although some cyanobacterial NRPS gene cluster
types are well described, the entire NRPS genomic content within a single cyanobacterial strain has never
been investigated. Here we have combined a genome-wide analysis using massive parallel pyrosequencing
("454") and mass spectrometry screening of oligopeptides produced in the strain Planktothrix rubescens
NIVA CYA 98 in order to identify all putative gene clusters for oligopeptides.
Results: Thirteen types of oligopeptides were uncovered by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses.
Microcystin, cyanopeptolin and aeruginosin synthetases, highly similar to already characterized NRPS,
were present in the genome. Two novel NRPS gene clusters were associated with production of
anabaenopeptins and microginins, respectively. Sequence-depth of the genome and real-time PCR data
revealed three copies of the microginin gene cluster. Since NRPS gene cluster candidates for microviridin
and oscillatorin synthesis could not be found, putative (gene encoded) precursor peptide sequences to
microviridin and oscillatorin were found in the genes mdnA and oscA, respectively. The genes flanking the
microviridin and oscillatorin precursor genes encode putative modifying enzymes of the precursor
oligopeptides. We therefore propose ribosomal pathways involving modifications and cyclisation for
microviridin and oscillatorin. The microviridin, anabaenopeptin and cyanopeptolin gene clusters are
situated in close proximity to each other, constituting an oligopeptide island.
Conclusion: Altogether seven nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters and two gene
clusters putatively encoding ribosomal oligopeptide biosynthetic pathways were revealed. Our results
demonstrate that whole genome shotgun sequencing combined with MS-directed determination of
oligopeptides successfully can identify NRPS gene clusters and the corresponding oligopeptides. The
analyses suggest independent evolution of all NRPS gene clusters as functional units. Our data indicate that
the Planktothrix genome displays evolution of dual pathways (NRPS and ribosomal) for production of
oligopeptides in order to maximize the diversity of oligopeptides with similar but functional discrete
bioactivities.

Background
Cyanobacteria produce a high number of chemically
diverse oligopeptides exhibiting various types of bioactivities ranging from mild enzyme inhibition to initiation of
acute toxic effects in pro- or eukaryotes [1]. More than 600
individual compounds have been described and probably
many peptides have remained undiscovered. Most oligopeptides can be assigned to chemical classes, of which
aeruginosins, anabaenopeptins, cyanopeptolins, microcystins, microginins, and microviridins are among the
most recognized ones [2]. Some classes have well characterized biosynthetic pathways [3-6], while for others,
hardly anything is known. The biological functions of
cyanobacterial oligopeptides are unknown, despite
knockout studies for microcystins and cyanopeptolins
[3,4,7]. However, gene knockouts in the relevant cyanobacterial strains have turned out to be difficult. Thus, the
link between a given oligopeptide and the gene cluster has
generally been difficult to establish. Since the precise functions of the peptides are unknown, the reasons for the vast
structural peptide diversity (both within- and between
classes of oligopeptides) remain obscure.
Several of the oligopeptides classes are produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). NRPS pathways
have been verified for microcystins [3,6,8], cyanopeptolins [4,9,10] and aeruginosins [5]. NRPSs have a modular
structure with distinct activation domains (A-domains),
thiolation domains (T-domains), and condensation
domains (C domains) that are easily identified due to signature sequences [11]. Conserved sequence motifs also
allow identification of additional modules and domains
that often are present in NRPS enzyme complexes, including metyltransferases (M-domains), epimerases (Edomains), thioesterase (TE domains), halogenases, and
ABC transporters. The oligopeptide products of NRPS
gene clusters may be predicted in silico based on binding
pocket analyses of A-domains [12,13], phylogeny and the
co-linearity rule, i.e. the order of A-domains is co-linear
with the amino acid sequence of the finished peptide [14].
Similar predictions of secondary metabolites from NRPS
gene clusters have been performed successfully previously
in Streptomyces ([15]). Some oligopeptides are, however,
synthesized ribosomally [16-18], and it is at present
unknown if this is the case also for other classes. Due to
insufficient genomic information this question has been
hard to address.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/396

recombination between sequences within the same
genome (intragenomic) may occur even between different
classes of NRPS clusters due to a general high genetic similarity (see Majewski and Cohan [22] and Papke et al.
[23]) among the building blocks (i.e. the modules)
[9,10,24] of NRPS gene clusters. Recombination events
and point mutations may be reinforced by positive selection for the new variant, indicating that the new oligopeptide variant may have biological significance [25].
Welker et al, 2006 [2] indicated that production of oligopeptides is concentrated within certain genera of cyanobacteria. Why do most strains belonging to in the NRPS
producing genera produce several classes of oligopeptides
and multiple variants of the same oligopeptide class? Further, what is the biological significance of the many
recombination events within the NRPS gene clusters? So
far, most studies have investigated single NRPS operons
(and their oligopeptides) or compared variants of the
same class of operons in different strains. It is likely that
all the different oligopeptides within a strain contribute to
its survival and fitness, therefore the most relevant
approach to take is to examine the entire genome of a
strain for NRPS genes. Such an approach should establish
relationship between each oligopeptide and operon, and
consequently reduce the need for knock-out mutants. Furthermore, the possibility of ribosomal synthesis of some
oligopeptide classes can be addressed. In addition, it will
be possible to investigate whether exchange of modules
between different classes of NRPS gene clusters within the
same genome occurs.
Here, we have selected a Planktothrix rubescens strain, NIVA
CYA 98, that produces all major classes of oligopeptides
according to Welker et al [2] and shotgun sequenced the
genome by massive parallel pyrosequencing (454) to high
depth (18.5×). We have characterized the oligopeptides of
this strain in detail by LC-MS-MS. This has enabled a correlation of NRPS gene clusters found within the genome
with the identified oligopetides. A putative gene cluster
could be identified for all structurally characterized oligopeptides. However, for two NRPS gene clusters no oligopeptide were detected. Overall, the data show that the
combined LC-MS-MS and 454 genome sequencing is a
very powerful approach for finding putative secondary
metabolite genes.

Results
Evolutionary and phylogenetic studies of individual
NRPS gene clusters have revealed frequent horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) between related strains [19-21]. This
is likely to generate new or recurrent variants of the enzymatic modules, leading to a change in oligopeptide profiles. In addition to HGT (intergenomic recombination),

Oligopeptides produced by Planktothrix NIVA CYA 98
Prior to 454-genome sequencing we performed a LC-MSMS mass spectroscopic fragmentation analysis of Planktothrix NIVA CYA 98. This analysis revealed thirteen oligopeptides representing all major oligopeptide classes
(Additional file 1: Table S1, Additional file 2: Figure S1).

Aeruginosins, anabaenopeptins, microcystins, and microginins were found to occur with at least two variants each,
typically differing by one amino acid or, as for microginins, by the presence/absence of Cl in the molecule
(Additional file 1: Table S1). An aeruginosin with a previously unreported molecular mass of 593.5 Da [M+H]+ was
detected, but not fully elucidated. The oligopeptide nature
of a second unknown compound with a mass of 1971.8
Da [M+H]+ could not be verified due to the production of
immonium ions in MS fragmentation experiments. The
molecular mass suggested that the oligopeptide might be
a microviridin, which is the only known cyanobacterial
oligopeptide class within this size range. A full structural
elucidation was not attempted.

The genome of Planktothrix NIVA CYA 98 and detection
of NRPS gene clusters
The 454 pyrosequencing-generated genomic sequence
dataset consisted of 570912 reads, with the average read
length at 262 bp, totaling 150 Mb (Short read archive
SRA008127). An assembly produced 692 contigs larger
than 500 bp. The average contig size was 8240 bp and the
largest contig was 129206 bp. The genome size was estimated at 5.5 Mb with an average GC content of 40.0%. An
average sequencing depth of 18.5× was obtained, and the
gaps between contigs were no larger than 100 bp within
the NRPS gene clusters regions (positions shown in Figure
1). In this work, we were able to detect all NRPS gene clusters by performing BLAST [26] comparisons of the entire

genome assembly with a relevant selection of NRPS
domains. We have focused our assembly on the putative
NRPS sequences. For these sequences we have performed
closing of gaps (5 gaps, maximum gap length of 7 bp) and
confirmation of correct assembly with PCR and Sanger
sequencing (total 5700 bp).
Gene clusters for all structurally determined oligopeptides
detected by LC-MS/MS were found among the contigs.
These were identified utilizing BLAST searches with characterized A- and C-domains as query sequences. A BLASTn
search identified 30 distinct regions with high similarity
to previously characterized A-domains (E value < 10-10).
Other regions were similar to known A-domains (E value
range 10-10 to 10-1), but lacked typical A-domain characteristics. Twenty-eight regions similar to known NRPS Cdomains (E value < 10-10) were also identified using
BLASTn search. In addition, a number of other domains
and genes connected to NRPSs were found, including
those encoding ABC-transporters.
Seven distinct NRPS gene clusters present in Planktothrix
NIVA CYA 98
The annotation of the genome uncovered seven distinct
NRPS clusters (Figure 1 and Additional file 3: Table S1)
distributed on twelve contigs. Three NRPS gene clusters –
aer, oci, and mcy – were highly similar in domain structure
and sequence to clusters previously associated with the
production of aeruginosins (96% identity to [GenBank:
AM071396]) [5], cyanopeptolins (95% identity to [GenBank: DQ837301]) [4,9,10], and microcystins (99% identity to [GenBank: AJ441056]) [3,6,8], respectively. The
oligopeptide structures predicted by gene identity and
order were in agreement with the structural data obtained
in MS fragmentation experiments (Additional file 1: Table
S1). We are therefore confident that the NRPS encoded by
clusters mcy, oci, and aer are responsible for the synthesis
of two demethylated microcystins (mcy), the cyanopeptolin oscillapeptin G (oci), and two aeruginosins (aer) by
NIVA CYA 98.

A large NRPS gene cluster was situated in close proximity
to the cyanopeptolin gene cluster (oci), but transcribed in
the opposite direction on the same contig (contig 13459).
The novel gene cluster (anaABCDE) encodes six basic
NRPS modules, including an epimerase and a methyltransferase domain, and an ABC transporter (Figure 1).
The size, organization and amino acid specificity of Adomains predicted a link between this gene cluster and
production of anabaenopeptins. A reliable prediction of
amino acid specificity in the AnaA-A1 and AnaA-A2
domains was not possible. However, the occurrence of
lysine in all anabaenopeptins suggested that the protein
complex named AnaABCDE was responsible for production of all four anabaenopeptin variants – with AnaA-A2

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/396

domain activating Lys and relaxed amino acid specificity
of the AnaA-A1 (Tyr/Arg) and AnaB-A3 (Val/Ile).
The Planktothrix CYA 98 genome also contains another
new NRPS polyketide hybrid gene cluster (micACDE). The
gene cluster encodes three basic NRPS modules, a
polyketide module and an aminotransferase. In silico analyses of the novel MicACDE suggested that the gene cluster
corresponded to the microginin oscillaginin B produced
by NIVA CYA 98. Oscillaginin A is chlorinated and thus a
halogenase is predicted to be part of the biosynthetic
pathway. However, BLAST searches could not identify a
complete halogenase in the gene cluster or in the entire
genome.
The products of the two remaining NRPS gene clusters
could not be assigned to oligopeptides detected by LCMS-MS. NRPS-like gene cluster 1 did not contain an ABC
transporter and the assembly of contig 153 (polyketide)
and 13820 (peptide synthetase) into a single contig displayed low sequence depth in the contig breakpoint. NonNRPS genes flanked NRPS-like gene cluster 2. The comparison of oligopeptides detected by mass spectroscopy
and predicted by genetic analysis did not identify any
NRPS gene clusters associated to the production of oscillatorin and the putative microviridin.
Multi copy NRPS gene clusters
To assess the quality of the contigs containing NRPS gene
clusters, sequence depth per base were analyzed (Additional file 1: Table S1). Contig 13900 (length 32 kb) containing the 21 kb microginin gene cluster and the contig
containing NRPS-like gene cluster 1 displayed higher
sequence depth than the average sequence depth of the
genome. Higher sequence depth per base is expected to be
observed when reads from repeats and duplicated regions
are collapsed into a single contig during the assembly
process. The sequence depth per base of the microginin
contig (13900) indicated three copies and the read-alignment also showed about 28 sites to be variable among the
reads (Additional file 3: Figure S1), were each read variant
was represented by approximately 1/3 of the reads covering that site. The 3X copy number of the microginin gene
cluster was confirmed by real-time PCR in an independent
study (see Nederbragt AJ, Rounge TB, Jakobsen KS: Identification and quantification of genomic repeats and sample contamination in assemblies of 454 pyrosequencing
reads, submitted).

PCR and Sanger sequencing showed that contig 13690
was present in two repeats within the cyanopeptolin gene
cluster. This contig (13690) also showed two-fold higher
sequence depth per base (Additional file 1: Table S1) and
which is in agreement with the sequence depth per base/
number of gene copy relationship as shown by Neder-

Altogether, the NRPS gene clusters accounted for 4.1%
(226 kb/5500 kb) of the entire Planktothrix genome when
considering the putative duplication of contigs 153,
13820 and 13900. The typical GC content of NRPS clusters ranged from 37 to 42% (Additional file 1: Table S1).
a) Microviridin biosynthesis

Ribosomal synthesis of microviridin and oscillatorin
Since NRPS gene cluster candidates for microviridin and
oscillatorin synthesis could not be found, putative ribosomal synthesized precursor genes were searched for and
found in the genes mdnA and oscA, respectively. BLAST
identified a gene cluster mdnACBDEF (Figure 2a and Additional file 3: Table S1), in close proximity to the anabaenopeptin and cyanopeptolin gene clusters, with high
similarities to microviridin biosynthesis genes from
Microcystis [17]. A putative microviridin precursor MdnA

Proposed microviridin and oscillatorin biosynthetic pathways. Orange arrows, with protein name and predicted function above, illustrate the genes size and transcription direction. a) MdnA is proposed as microviridin precursor. MdnCB are
predicted to ligate the ring structures, MdnD is responsible for acetylation. A microviridin with unknown side chain was predicted based on the precursor sequence (MdnA) and gene similarities to the Microcystis microviridin gene clusters [16]. b) The
alignment of sequences with high similarities to Microcystis MdnA shows two highly conserved regions in the leader peptide
(green dashed line) and core peptide (red dashed line). The leader-core transition is unknown. c) oscA is proposed as the oscillatorin precursor encoding 619 amino acids, includes eight of the 10 amino acids in oscillatorin (bold text). The tryptophan is
suggested as a precursor to oscillatoric acid (Osc). Based on in silico analyses of the gene cluster, the oscillatorin precursor is
likely to be cleaved by peptidase S33. Modification of tryptophan and addition of valine is carried out by unknown enzymes. A
putative cyclo-ligase is may be involved in cyclization.

included a leader and core peptide region with conserved
motives (Figure 2b). Based on in silico analyses of the
MdnA core peptide and comparison to the microviridin
biosynthetic pathway in Microcystis, a microviridin biosynthesis pathway in Planktothrix NIVA CYA 98 can be
suggested. The pathway includes cleavage, ligation,
acetylation and possible metylation and results in an in
silico predicted microviridin with an unknown side chain.
The genomic island, constituting the microviridin gene
cluster and the two NRPS gene clusters ana and oci, we
term an oligopeptide island. Interestingly, it includes both
putative ribosomal and NRPS biosynthetic pathways.
tBLASTn search identified an 1853 bp open reading frame
in the Planktothrix genome that encoded an eight amino
acid sequence identical to Pro-Asn-Glu-Arg-Gly-Tyr-GlyLeu sequence of oscillatorin. The protein, here named
OscA (accession AM990468), has unknown function. The
ninth amino acid flanking Leu is tryptophan suggested by
Sano and Kaya [27] to be modified to oscillatoric acid
(Osc), another part of oscillatorin. The probability of a
coincidental occurrence of the nine amino acid sequence
is 1.0 × 10-12 (see calculation in Methods) and we therefore suggest that the main part of oscillatorin is produced
ribosomally as an integral part of this protein. Similar
schemes have been shown for other oligopeptides [1618]. Thus, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for oscillatorin involving ribosomally encoded amino acids (ProAsn-Glu-Arg-Gly-Tyr-Gly-Leu), plus a valine of unknown
origin, and cyclization of the oligopeptide by a modifying
enzyme possibly encoded by the putative formyltetrahydropholate cycloligase found in the osc gene cluster (Figure 2c). A BLAST search showed similarity to a
hypothetical protein L8106_04601 from Lyngbya sp. PCC
8106 (53% identity). Interproscan http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
InterProScan/[28] identified motifs similar to pectate
lyases (Pfam CL0268).
Intra-genomic evolutionary processes unveiled by
phylogeny
Phylogenetic analyses of A-, C-, M-, E-domains (Additional file 3: Figures S2, S3, S4 and S5) and NRPS-ABCtransporter genes (Figure 3) including the Planktothrix
CYA 98 NRPS sequences, supplemented with other NRPS
sequences, showed clustering according to gene cluster
type rather than strain or genera. A- and C- domains also
showed functional clustering according to amino acid
specificity and position in the gene cluster, respectively
(Additional file 3: Figures S2 and S3). The phylogenetic
analyses including only Planktothrix CYA98 domains indicated the same clustering according to gene cluster and
position. However, due to the low number of sequences
and few variable sites, the topology did not receive sufficient support (data not shown). Split decomposition
analyses were used to identify conflicting phylogenies,

Discussion
Metabolomics and the genome-wide approach
Here, we show that combining information about all oligopeptides (from LC-MS-MS) with whole genome
sequencing of a Planktothrix strain is a powerful method to
deduce the relations between oligopeptides and the corresponding NRPS gene clusters Identification of putative
ribosomal pathways of oscillatorin and microviridin further demonstrates the power of the genome-wide
approach. All sequence information needed to identify
and characterize the oligopeptide gene clusters was
derived from de novo shotgun sequencing of a previously
unsequenced cyanobacterial genus, Planktothrix. The gene
clusters were assembled to completion by Sangersequencing only a few short PCR fragments. The Plank-

tothrix strain was not axenic, but in silico analyses of the
454-sequences solved this potential problem (Nederbragt
AJ, Rounge TB, Jakobsen KS: Identification and quantification of genomic repeats and sample contamination in
assemblies of 454 pyrosequencing reads, submitted). The
gene clusters were identified without making an effort to
assemble the complete genome. This is the most complete
oligopeptide investigation in a single cyanobacterial
strain to date, and we demonstrate here that the genomewide approach using high-throughput sequencing combined with structural determination of the metabolites
has the potential to accelerate oligopeptide research and
increase our understanding of secondary metabolite synthesis in general.
Link between NRPS gene clusters and oligopeptides
In silico analyses of the microcystin, cyanopeptolin and
aeruginosin gene clusters correlate with the produced
microcystin (desmethyl-RR), oscillapeptin G (cyanopeptolin) and aeruginosin A and a new aeruginosin variant
detected by the MS analyses.

The link between the novel ana gene cluster, situated in
close proximity to the cyanopeptolin gene cluster, and the
anabaenopeptins is highly likely due to the correlation
between the bioinformatic predictions and the LC-MS-MS
deduction of the anabaenopeptins. It is likely that AnaABCDE produce all four anabaenopeptin variants due to
relaxed specificity of the AnaA1 and AnaA2 domain. The
epimerase domain suggests a D-amino acid in the A2
position, corresponding to the conserved Lysine in the oligopeptide, in agreement with structural analyses of anabaenopeptins [29]. However, the mass spectrometry
analysis cannot differentiate between the D-and L-configurations of amino acids.
In silico analyses of MicACDE show that this gene cluster
corresponds to the oscillaginin B produced by the strain.
The chlorinated oscillaginin A requires an additional halogenase, but we were unable to detect a complete oligopeptide halogenase in the genome. The chlorine atom
is attached to the polyketide part of the molecule, so a
potential different halogenase outside the contig or in
trans may be involved.
The microcystin, cyanopeptolin, and aeruginosin and the
newly discovered anabaenopeptin and microginin gene
clusters all share many features including ABC transporter
genes. The function of NRPS ABC-transporters has not
been determined, but it has been suggested that they are
involved in the export of oligopeptides from the cells.
Additionaly, the ABC transporter mcyJ is shown to be
essential for microcystin production [30]. All five NRPS
gene clusters are co-linear and consist of very similar

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/396

NRPS and PKS modules. Compared to previously characterized gene clusters, we observed small changes in aeruginosin gene cluster architecture [5], new tailoring genes/
domains (ociG and ociH encoding unknown functions)
and an additional NRPS module in the cyanopeptolin
gene clusters (eight NRPS modules cyanopeptolin gene
cluster, in contrast to previously described seven modules
[10]) and a mcyA gene without a methyltransferase in the
mcy gene cluster [31]. NRPS-like gene cluster 1, lacking an
ABC transporter and therefore believed to be incomplete
and NRPS-like gene cluster 2, containing only one NRPS
encoding module, could not be linked to oligopeptides.
An almost three-fold higher sequencing depth per base
and abundance in real-time PCR analysis suggested three
copies of the microginin and the NRPS-like 1 gene clusters
(Nederbragt AJ, Rounge TB, Jakobsen KS: Identification
and quantification of genomic repeats and sample contamination in assemblies of 454 pyrosequencing reads,
submitted). The variations (point mutations) in the reads
detected in the microginin gene clusters point towards
some sequence variation between the copies.
Independent NRPS gene cluster evolution and finding of
an oligopeptide island support similar, but discrete,
oligopeptide functions
The phylogenetic analyses showed individual functional
domains within a NRPS class to be more closely related,
compared to NRPS modules from other NRPS classes
within the same strain. This indicates independent evolution of each gene cluster, in line with data from single
NRPS studies [9,10,25]. Our results therefore indicate that
NRPS domain evolution is influenced more by functional
constraints acting on the domains, than by the evolutionary relationships between strains. ABC transporters genes
were shown to evolve together with their respective gene
clusters as sign of a functional unit. Consequently, they
are useful for studying NRPS gene cluster evolution. While
the general module architecture was conserved within a
gene cluster type, frequent tailoring domain rearrangements were shown resulting in new features like the Gdomain, and OciH of the cyanopeptolin and partial halogenases in OciG and AerB. A module rearrangement by
intra-gene cluster recombination (identical ociA C2 and
C3) seems likely in the cyanopeptolin gene cluster.

An oligopeptide island – a parallel to pathogenicity
islands including the three closely located oligopeptide
gene clusters oci, ana and mdn (4597 and 2139 bp distance
between gene clusters respectively) was observed. Colocalization of cyanobacterial oligopeptide gene clusters
has not been reported previously and may indicate a common target or class of targets for the peptides. There were
no further signs of closely linked NRPS gene clusters.

Page 7 of 11

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:396

However, a completely assembled genome is needed to
determine the relative positions of the NRPS gene clusters
to each other.
Dual origin of oligopetides through NRPS and ribosomal
pathways
If oscillatorin and microviridin were produced by NRPSs,
the corresponding gene clusters would be large and thus
easily detected in the genome by this method. These oligopeptides contain only L-amino acids suggesting a possible ribosomal pathway with subsequent modification and
cyclization. It is therefore not unexpected that we have
identified genes that a likely to ribosomally encode the
precursor of oscillatorin and microviridin. The high similarity between the microviridin (mdn) gene cluster presented here and in two Microcystis strains [17] strongly
suggest that the mdn gene cluster produce microviridin.
However the length of the side chain, modifications of
amino acids and occurrence of additional functional
groups are unknown. Ribosomal pathways through the
activity of a set of processing enzymes have been shown
for microviridins [17] microcyclamide [18] and patellamides [16], demonstrating that at least two fundamentally different biosynthetic pathways are used by
cyanobacteria to produce oligopeptides.

Conclusion
The present study suggests that NRPS gene clusters encoding the synthesis of aeruginosins, anabaenopeptins, cyanopeptolins, and microginins evolve independently of one
another. Using phylogenetic methods we showed that
there are low levels of recombination between similar
modules in functionally different NRPS gene clusters
within one and the same strain. The recombination levels
have not been possible to assess without this genomewide sequencing approach. In addition, the strain NIVA
CYA 98 features a likely ribosomal production of oscillatorin and microviridin. All of these six oligopeptide
classes are known as potent inhibitors of different types of
proteolytic enzymes, including serine proteases, metalloproteases, and carboxypeptidases [27,32-37]. This
strongly suggests dual pathway of evolution of protease
inhibitors in Planktothrix NIVA CYA 98, allowing different
rates of evolution for each NRPS and ribosomal oligopeptide gene clusters. Elucidation of evolutionary rates
between the different oligopeptide gene clusters, in particular NRPS- and ribosomal derived, requires further studies. It is tempting, however, to attribute the dual evolution
and high diversity of protease inhibitors in NIVA CYA 98
to an "arms-race" between unknown pathogens, competitors or grazers in cyanobacteria [38,39].

Methods
Cyanobacterial culture and growth conditions
Planktothrix rubescens NIVA CYA 98 was isolated in 1982
from Lake Steinsfjorden, Norway. The strain has been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/396

maintained in continuous culture in the NIVA culture collection of Algae in Z8 medium and light at a photon flux
density of 10 μmol m-2s-1, and a light-dark cycle of 12:12
hours.
Oligopeptide analysis
Oligopeptides were extracted from filters with cultured
Planktothrix after lyophilisation using 50% MeOH as
described previously [37]. For the detection and identification of oligopeptides, Liquid Chromatography Mass
Spectroscopy (LC-MS-MS) was used. The MS-MS detector
was run in total scanning mode for the mass range of 500
to 2000 Da during the entire Waters Acquity Ultra-performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) linear gradient
(from 10% to 45% acetonitrile in water, both containing
0.1% formic acid, within 10 minutes at a flow rate of 0.25
mL min-1). Compounds with a molecular mass within the
range of 500–2000 Da were further analyzed in fragmentation experiments with the detector in daughter ion scanning mode.

The structural elucidation of cyanobacterial oligopeptides
on the basis of MS fragmentation experiments were identical to previously described studies [9,10,40,41].
Sequencing and bioinformatics
DNA was extracted from cells frozen in isopropanol using
a phenol-chloroform extraction. Massive parallel pyrosequencing was performed according to manufacturer's protocol on two PicoTiter Plates with a GS FLX instrument
performed at Roche Penzburg, and at University of Oslo,
Norway. PCR and Sanger-sequencing with specific primers (Additional file 3: Table S2) was used to close two gaps
in the NRPS gene clusters and confirm the correct assembly of the cyanopeptolin gene cluster which was not possible to assemble with only 454 sequences. The
gsAssembler 1.1.02 program (Roche-454, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assemble the 454-reads in contigs at
default settings.

Axenic Planktothrix cultures are very difficult to obtain. A
BLASTn search against the 16S rDNA database [42,43]
confirms the contamination in Planktothrix NIVA CYA 98.
16S sequences similar to Planktothrix, Pseudodevosia insulae, Mesorhizobium, Flavobacterium psychrophilum and
uncultured cyanobacteria were identified. However, due
to large domination of Planktothrix in the culture only
small fragments of other genomes were sequenced, and
these sequences were not assembled in to large contigs
due low number of reads. BLASTn of contigs showing
atypical GC content and/or low sequence depth per base
were shown to be contamination (Nederbragt AJ, Rounge
TB, Jakobsen KS: Identification and quantification of
genomic repeats and sample contamination in assemblies
of 454 pyrosequencing reads, submitted).

Page 8 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:396

Identification of contigs containing NRPS domains was
performed with BLAST searches at the UiO Bioportal
http://www.bioportal.uio.no with cyanopeptolin and
microcystin A- and C-domains as query sequences, and
confirmed using blast2go against the non-redundant protein sequences (nr) database. ORFfinder http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/[44] and Vector NTI
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) were used to find and translate open reading frames (ORF). Identification of
domains, binding pocket signatures and A-domain substrate specificities were performed using the NRPS database [45]. A-domain specificities were also substantiated
using phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 3: Figure S2).
Functional predictions of other genes in connection with
NRPS gene clusters were determined using BLAST, and
conserved motifs searches using InterProScan http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/[28]. A-, C-, M-, Edomains and ABC transporter gene Bayesian inference
and neighbor joining (NJ) phylogeny was performed as
described in Rounge et al [10] using MEGA 3.1 [46],
MrBayes 3.1 [47], ProTest [48] and the UiO Bioportal. In
addition to all the NRPS-domains from Planktothrix NIVA
CYA 98, the phylogenetic analyses also include NRPS
domains from other cyanobacteria (M-domain phylogenies also include other bacteria)(Accession numbers for
the sequences used in the phylogenetic analyses are listed
in Additional file 3: Table S3). The additional domains
from other strains showed that the NIVA CYA 98 domains
cluster in several different groups. Split decomposition
analyses were performed using SplitsTree4 [49] with
default settings (uncorrectedP method) and 1000 bootstrap replicas, and Phi test for recombination [50]. The
probability of a coincidental encoded amino acid (Paa) is
the number of codons encoding the amino acid divided
by the total number of possible codons (i.e. 64). The
probability of a coincidental occurrence of an amino acid
sequence is P = Paa 1 × Paa 2×...Paa n. The coincidental
occurrence of the amino acid sequence of oscillatorin is
therefore P = (4/64)×(2/64)×(2/64)×(6/64)×(4/64)×(2/
64)×(4/64)×(6/64)×(1/64) = 1.0 × 10-12. This calculation
does not take into account codon usage bias.
