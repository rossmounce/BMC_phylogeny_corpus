Abstract
This report focuses on the 2005 Annual meeting held in Caxambu, Minas Gerais, Brazil that was
convened and organized by the Brazilian Society of Protozoology http://www.sbpz.org.br/. This is
an annual event and details of these meetings can be found on the Society's website. Within the
space available it has been impossible to cover all the important and fascinating contributions and
what is presented are our personal views of the meetings scientific highlights and new
developments. The contents undoubtedly reflect each author's scientific interests and expertise.
Fuller details of the round tables, seminars and posters can be consulted on line at http://
www.sbpz.org.br/livroderesumos2005.php.

Background
The meeting was attended by principally Brazilian scientists and students and a smaller number participants from
other Latin American countries, Europe, the United States
and Japan. Of the 546 participants 72.94% (380) were
students. The scientific sessions were divided into 10 peer
lectures, 13 round tables in which 4 invited speakers
explored specific areas and 382 posters. There were also 4
sessions in which selected posters were presented orally.
In these sessions a total of 35 posters were presented by
the senior author who in most cases was a postgraduate
student. In this report we provide a "snapshot" of what, in
our view, are the highlights of newest developments.

The event was inaugurated by José Franco da Silveira (vice
president of the Brazilian Society of Protozoology) who
presented an autobiographical sketch of the 2005 recipient of the Samuel Pessoa award – Prof. Luiz Hildebrando
Pereira da Silva. Prof. Hildebrando, director of the "Instituto de Pesquisas em Patologias Tropicais de Rondônia"
(IPEPATRO), gave the opening Samuel Pessoa lecture
emphasizing that parasitological research projects in a
Tropical Research Institute in Amazonia integrate science
and regional health problems through collaborative programs and "brain circulation". He highlighted the economic disequilibrium in Brazil caused by the destruction
of the Amazonian forest by logging companies, cattle

farmers and soja bean planters. In spite of these products
being some of the countries principal exports they produced an unacceptably low salary index per capita/per
acre which could be higher if native forest resources were
exploited intelligently.

Cellular traffic
Mark Field (Cambridge University, UK) presented his
recent data on the developmental regulation of endocytosis in Trypanosoma brucei, which undergoes massive
remodeling of its surface. He showed that bloodstream
and procyclics have different levels of small GTPases
(Rabs) that control the traffic. Rab 11 is 20 fold enriched
in bloodstream compared to procyclic forms, while Rab 4
levels are similar. Using RNAi his group demonstrated
that these two different stages have different patterns of
cellular traffic pathways and control and that over 600
genes are involved in trafficking. But how is the regulation
of genes orchestrated and what are mechanisms that control the differential traffic during development? Ulisses
Lopes from UFRJ showed that the Rho proteins of
Trypanosoma cruzi are small GTPases responsible for
cytoskeleton remodeling mainly through actin filaments.
One of them, TcRho1 presents a CaaX motif at the C-terminus that targets the protein for farnesylation. Mutants
lacking the CaaX motif results in cell dispersion and death
during differentiation, suggesting that is required for metacyclogenesis. He also identified the OCRL1 and TcRJLs.
The first is responsible for Lowe Syndrome in humans but
its function in trypanosomes is unknown. The second
belongs to a new family of Ras-related GTPase proteins in
T. cruzi genome and is found in other trypanosomes and
Giardia.
Using electron microscopy Maurilio Soare's group (UFRJ,
Brazil) studied the endo and exocytic vesicles near the
flagellar pocket of Trypanosoma cruzi and presented evidence of the presence of GM1 enriched lipid rafts in these
entry points. This type of membrane structure was also
detected in the flagellum of T. brucei and T. cruzi by David
Engman's group (Northwestern University, Chicago,
USA). He showed that the flagellar calcium binding protein (FCaBP) in these trypanosomes is dependent on myristoylation and palmitoylation, and calcium binding acts
as a switch for the membrane localization. This is part of
a kinase signaling pathway that controls flagellar function
by affecting the lipid order and membrane organization.
Lipid raftsstructures were also found by Narcisa Cunha e
Silva's team (UFRJ, Brazil) in the reservosomes, which are
large organelles present in T. cruzi epimastigotes that accumulate proteins and lipids. When the parasite undergoes
metacyclogenesis the reservosomes disappear.
The diversity and peculiarity of Rab small GTPase in vesicular trafficking of ameba was presented by Tomoyoshi

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/5/1/4

Nosaki (Gunna University Graduate School of Medicine,
Japan). He compared phagocytosis of pathogenic Entamoebae histolytica with non-pathogenic Entamoebae dispar.
Amoeba phagosomes show small GTPases, Rab1/5/7/8
and 11 in addition to several cytoskeleton components,
signal transduction, transport, mitochondria-like protein,
metabolic enzymes, ubiquitin systems and several hydrolases (Euk. Cell and MBP 2005). Interestingly, amoebae
have a larger number (91) and unique Rab GTPase compared to humans or other higher eukaryotic cells (~60).
Moreover, they have a unique pre-phagosomal vacuole
(PPV), which contains protease and amoebapore that fuse
to form primary and secondary phagosomes. Nosaki's
group characterized proteins interacting with Rab5 and
Rab7, involved in the formation of PPV.
Isabelle Coppens (John Hopkins University School of
Public Health, USA) showed that Toxoplasma gondii uses
cellular trafficking to obtain host cell nutrients. The parasite manipulates the distribution of host cell microtubules
and vimentin but not actin to surround the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in a way that a corset of host microtubules is formed around it. This dynamic association is
used to divert low-density lipoproteins (LDL). One components of this machinery is GRA7, a 236 amino acid protein, which acts like a garrote that sequesters host
endocytic organelles within the vacuolar space. My-Hang
Huynh's team (John Hopkins University, USA), presented
aspects of trafficking involved in T. gondii cell invasion in
which proteins found in micronemes are secreted to form
the new PV. By knocking-out T. gondii M2AP protein, they
found a decrease in the microneme MIC2 expression,
which is retained in the ER/Golgi, severe impairment of
cell invasion in vitro, attenuated virulence as well as gliding motility problems. They propose as a model in which
M2AP forms a complex with MIC2 in an early endosome,
which is processed and added to micronemes.

Host parasite interaction
Oscar N. Mesquita (UFMG, Brazil) examined membrane
alterations during the interaction of macrophages with
Leishmania by defocusing under optical microscopy. He
detected and quantified small random changes and large
alterations as ruffles on the cell surface. The variations
were conserved, indicating that they are produced by discrete events. Ruffles were inhibited by adding cytochalasin. When a parasite is added to the cell using the optical
tweezers he found dramatic perturbations in the small
movements, but ruffling activity was not modified. Antonio Gonzalez Aguilar (CSIP, Spain) demonstrated that the
alternative splice of the Lyt1 gene of T. cruzi generates a
membrane protein. This membrane protein is the TcTox
involved in the parasite's escape from the PV. Phytomonas
serpens that expresses this gene is able to escape from the
PV and multiply in the macrophage's cytoplasm. The

other spliced form of Lyt1, codes for a protein expressed
in the epimastigote's kinetoplast, and is probably
involved in DNA replication.

Control of gene expression
Artur Scherf (Institute Pasteur, France) described recent
advances in explaining the expression of Var genes by Plasmodium falciparum. Var genes encode the Plasmodium
erythrocyte surface proteins (Pefr1), whose expression
delimits infected red cell adhesion. Dr Scherf proposed a
model for the control of Car gene expression that depends
on where the Var gene is located in the nucleus. Nonexpressed Var genes are in heterochromatin regions that
prevents transcription. In contrast, the expressed Var gene
chromatin is acetylated outside the heterochromatic
region. The next question to be answered is how the gene's
expression site is selected?
T. cruzi surface mucin-like molecules are encoded by a
large multigene family. Vanina Campo (Instituto de
Investiagaciones Biotecnológicas, Argentina), explained
that the expression of this diverse group of genes is controlled by post-transcriptional mechanism, including
alternative splicing and mRNA stabilization. Key factors
that control expression are RNA recognition motives in
these genes, which are sites for binding of protein factors
that stabilize specifically groups of mRNA. Stenio Fragoso
(IBMP, Brazil) characterized TcZFP1a CCH-zinc finger
protein, possibly involved in post-translation control of
gene expression. He showed that it is expressed cells submitted to nutritional stress and is located in cytoplasmic
spots. The protein expressed in E. coli in fusion with GFP
and purified by Ni-columns interacts with RNA sequences
containing poly C RNA. It does not bind to AU rich elements (ARE). This, together with other CCH zinc finger
proteins, is differentially expressed during metacyclogenesis as seen by microarray analysis.
T. cruzi is composed by two major phylogenetic groups, T.
cruzi I and T. cruzi II. Santuza Teixeira's group (UFMG,
Brazil) found that multigene families of group I are more
homogeneous than those of group II. Hybrid strains
showed intermediate variability. According to her data,
mismatch excision repair may be different in the two
groups, particularly TcMSH2 activity, one of the proteins
responsible for this type of repair. Nancy Sturm (UCLA,
USA) showed polymorphisms in the kinetoplast maxicircle sequences of these two groups and that a variable RNA
editing could compensate these differences.
A key factor in explaining differential gene expression of
trypanosomatids is the control of translation initiation.
The group lead by Oswaldo Pumpilio Melo Neto
(FIOCRUZ, Brazil) presented results characterizing multiple homologues for the eIF4E subunits of Leishmania and

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/5/1/4

Trypanosoma involved in cap binding and translation initiation control in trypanosomes. L. major has four homologues but only eIF4E1 binds to cap, while in T. brucei
both eIF4E1 and E2 are involved in this same process but
that, only eIF4E3 was essential.

Epidemiology
The Sudan is one of the countries that has had some of the
worst epidemics of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) known to
man and Muntaser Irahim (Institute of Endemic Diseases,
Sudan) compared this disease to a serial killer. The actual
number of people who have died over the years is
unknown but when the epidemic in the West Nile region
was first recorded in the 1950's a whole tribe died was
wiped out. Since then there have been estimates that over
250,000 people have been victims of the "serial killer".
The variable severity of the disease is considered to be
linked to both ethnic and geographical elements. Recently
it has been shown that the graver symptoms leading to
death are linked to certain genes. In Brazil it has been
noted that VL epidemics have a 10 year cycle and it was a
surprise to learn that in the Sudan the disease also strikes
every ten years. Detailed molecular studies have shown
that the aetiological agent, Leishmania (Leishmania)
archibaldi is closer to L.(L.) donovani and it has been suggested that the latter originated from the former when
man migrated from Africa. There is a possibility that there
are wild animal reservoirs and that these are in fact the primary source, however, in its epidemic form the disease is
clearly an anthroponosis.

Highlights of immunology
Diverse aspects of immunity and immunopathology of
malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease and toxoplasmosis were addressed.
The malaria speakers enriched our knowledge on diverse
topics such as the molecular aspects of the immunopathology of P. falciparum malaria and the presence of crossreactive epitopes between diverse species of malaria parasites. Jürg Gysin (Institut Pasteur, France) described his
work on a roptry protein (RSP-2) which is present on the
surface of non-infected human erythrocytes. His results
suggest that in part anemia is related to the destruction of
these cells by RSP-2 specific antibodies with the aid of
monocytes. Subsequently, Lars Hviid (Rigshospitalet,
Denmark) summarized several years of studies on pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) which established that
PAM resulted from preferential sequestration of parasitized red blood in the placenta. The molecular target for
immunity against PAM was identified as the PfEMP-1
(var2CSAgene) which is expressed on the surface of
infected red blood cells capable of binding to chondroitin
sulfate A. Based on this they proposed an anti-PAM vaccine. Gerhard Wunderlich (USP, Brazil) concluded that

the repertoire of the P. falciparum var genes in the Amazon
Basin is limited and that this indicated a reduced gene
pool of this species throughout the region. Denise Mattei
(Institute Pasteur, France) elucidated some of the mechanism by which clag-2 gene products modulates adhesion
of infected red blood cells through expression of certain
PfEMP-1. Finally, Antoniana Krettli (FIOCRUZ, Brazil)
discussed the presence of cross-reactive epitopes present
in sporozooites of P. falciparum and P. gallinaceum sporozooites. This cross-reactive epitope may be a new antigenic marker for the detection of protective immunity
against P. falciparum sporozooites.
Flavia Ribeiro-Gomez (UFRJ, Brazil) found that the course
of experimental infection with L. major can be modified
by the presence of apoptotic neutrophils. In the case of
BALB/c mice these cells have a deleterious role in the
infection mediated by the increase in secretion of TGFbeta by macrophages. On the other hand, the presences of
apoptotic neutrophils increase the resistance of C57BL/6
mice by a mechanism that is dependent on the neutrophil
elastase, and TNF-alpha and NO secretion.
The presentations on the immunity to T. cruzi focused on
subjects that are expected to be the new trends in the years
to come. Sarah Williams-Blangero (South-Western Foundation for Biomedical Research, USA) described elegant
human genetic studies concluding that several clinical features of chronic Chagas' disease are genetically linked.
Nobuko Yoshida (UNIFESP, Brazil) shed some light on
the poorly understood molecular mechanisms responsible for oral infection, describing also a possible method
for the eventual blockage of this type of infection. Maurico Rodrigues (UNIFESP, Brazil) focused his presentation
on a so far poorly studied molecule extremely abundant
in the amastigote forms of the parasite. He concluded that
the amastigote surface protein-2 is highly conserved
among the different strains of the parasite being recognized by protective CD4 Th1 and CD8 Tc1 cells. These
results indicate that this molecule may provide an excellent target for vaccination. Walderez Dutra (UFMG, Brazil) explored the presence of regulatory molecules on the
surface of antigen presenting cells (APC) as key factors
controlling the reactivity of pathogenic T lymphocytes. So
far, she has observed that APC from symptomatic individuals have an activated profile that may explain at least in
part the higher reactivity of T lymphocytes. Studies in
Chagasic humans performed by Juliana de Assis
(FIOCRUZ, Brazil) described an interesting correlation
between the frequency of CD4+CD25+ regulatory cells
and the indeterminate forms of the disease. Joseli Lannes
(FIOCRUZ, Brazil) presented data where she described
that CCR5 inhibitors may be explored as tools to reduce
the heart immunopathology of experimental Chagas' Disease.

Monoxenic Trypanosomatids
The presentations at round table on the monoxenics and
evolutionary perspectives of the Trypanosomatidae family
ranged from the origin of endosymbionts to origin of the
group. Cristina Motta (UFRJ, Brasil) emphasized that the
trypanosomatid endosymbiont cannot survive outside its
host and that like mitochondria it lacks the septum and
FtsZ ring that are essential in bacterial division. Recent
sequence data indicates that they are closely related to Bordetella bronchiseptica and that endosymbiosis was a single
event. Based on the 18S rRNA, SL RNA and protein coding
genes from an extensive taxa set Julius Lukes (Institute of
Parasitology, Czech Republic) concluded the trypanosomatids were monophyletic group that originated from
paraphyletic bodonids. The 18S rRNA was not informative for insect parasites and indicated that members of this
group are not host specific. Similarly bird trypanosomes
do not appear to be vector specific and are found in mosquitoes, black flies, hippoboscids and midges. The vector
of the T. avium clade in the Czech Republic appears to be
black flies while the United Kingdom the vectors of the T.
corvi clade are hippoboscids and mosquitoes. There
appears to be an overall low level of host specificity with
the surprising possibility of insect parasites infecting
warm blooded vertebrates. The available taxonomic data
strongly favours the hypothesis that the group evolved
from flagellates of insects. One of the important biological characters of the trypanosomatids is that their morphology is reversible during their life cycles and Angela
Lopes (UFRJ) questioned what mechanisms are responsible for this cellular modulation. She drew attention to
potential importance of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in
this process. PAF is a phosopholipid with that has diverse
physiological and patho-physiological actions. Another
substance found in serum and reduviid bug saliva, lysophosphatidycholine (LPC) has been found to modulate
cellular differentiation of Herpetosoma samuelpessoai and it
is possible that LPC reacts via the PAF receptor. There has
been an increase in immuno-suppressed individuals in
recent years and human cases of monoxenic trypanosomatids in man have been recorded. With this in mind
Elvira Saraiva (UFRJ, Brazil) investigated the infectivity of
Blastocrithidia culcis to human monocytes that had been
exposed to HIV-1 transactivator protein. The intracellular
survival of B. culcis was greater in cells exposed to HIV-1
Tat protein and TGF-β1. In Aedes aegypti the parasite
adhered and penetrated the gut wall and adhered to the
salivary gland wall. This could lead to transmission by bite
which could lead to infection in immuno-suppressed
individuals.

Chemotherapy & treatment
The problems of developing new drugs for neglected diseases were discussed by Simon Croft, coordinator of
Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi – http://

Page 4 of 6

Kinetoplastid Biology and Disease 2006, 5:4

www.dndi.org). The development cost of a new drug is in
the order of US$800 million dollars which is prohibitive
for neglected diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.
He emphasized that there have been enormous advances
in biochemical and cell biological studies of the pathogens such as leishmania and trypanosomes but that the
data must be used in an organized fashion for the
Research and Development (R & D) of new drugs. The
major R & D stumbling block in the past has been the lack
of coordinated efforts between commercial companies
who have the expertise and groups from the countries in
which the diseases are endemic. However this is possible
with sustainable funding and to this end non profit making organizations have been formed to funnel funds into
this area and forge collaborative links. A virtual model targeting the product profile has been developed to accompany development at different stages so that decisions as
to the feasibility of success can be critically assessed, thus
avoiding investing in a product that will not meet the
basic requirements.
Other participants discussed the specific need for the
development of drugs for leishmaniasis and American
trypanosomiasis. Eder Romero (Universidade Nacional
de Quilmes, Argentina) explored the use of nanotechnology for delivering drugs in concentrations up to 100 times
less than those administered by traditional methods. The
delivery vehicle (nanoship) also has the advantage of
being able to target a specific disease compartment at
either the tissue or cellular level. Federico Gomes-de-lasHerus, (GlaxoSmithkline disease of the developing World
Drug Discovery Centre, Spain) explained how the GSK
centre, which has 100 full time scientists and the full support of the parent drug company, works via a partnership
with Medicines for Malarial Venture (MMV) and Global
Alliance for TB (GATB) in developing new drugs for
malaria and tuberculosis. An important concept in this
process is the Target Product Profile which for malaria is:
treatment of uncomplicated malaria, suitable for sensitive
& resistant Plasmodium, oral administration and fast activity, 3 day treatment, well tolerated, suitable for use in
combinations and affordable for the target population. It
was emphasized that the high cost of drugs is because very
few reach the market place. Hector Freilij (Hospital de
Niños Ricardo Gutiérez, Argentina) drew attention to the
importance of congenital transmission of Chagas disease
in urban areas of large towns such as Buenos Aires. The
infected mothers are from endemic areas and are asymptomatic. Of three children only one may become infected
during pregnancy and treatment of the children under 5
years old is successful. In urban areas of Argentina Chagas
disease has become a childhood disease and the majority
of the children are asymptomatic. A major question is if
such cases go untreated will they develop the more severe
clinical forms of Chagas disease later in their lives. Luis

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/5/1/4

Villa Villanueva (Médecins San Frontiéres, Spain) voiced
his concern as to the availability of drugs for the treatment
of Chagas Disease since the major drug companies were
not interested in continuing to manufacture them. Alternative manufacturing sources within endemic countries
are a solution to this problem and Biomaguinhos
(FIOCRUZ, Brazil) has signed contracts to produce some.
It was pointed out that this may solve Brazil's future problem but will it help other Latin American countries where
Chagas disease is endemic?
The treatment of the extreme variety of clinical forms of
cutaneous leishmaniasis that may lead to more severe
clinical symptoms such as mucocutaneous leishmaniasis
and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis is a challenge to the
clinician. Edgar de Carvalho (UFB, Brasil) addressed this
problem by documenting some of the important immunological parameters (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL2, IL-10 IL15, and
T cells CD4, CD8, CD69, CD28-, CD62L-) associated with
the different clinical forms. With the intuitive of improving the chemotherapeutic responses GM-CSF and pentoxyfilline were associated with antimony therapy to control
some of the adverse effects caused by the cytokines.

Parasite vector interaction
Marcelo Jacobs-Lorena (Malaria Research Institute, USA)
reviewed the approach of using transgenic mosquitoes in
preventing malaria transmission. The main strategy has
been to genetically engineer mosquitoes to make them
resistant to the pathogen, introduce them into the population that will theoretically reduce transmission. He
stressed that this is a complementary approach to drugs
and vaccines. Due to the complexity of the fitness problem in the nature, his group is now trying to introduce
transformed bacteria as a source of heterologous genes
(paratransgenic). He also showed his recent results
describing the role of SPRN6, a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family, which is expressed by
insect infected cells. SPRN6 RNAi and knockouts have an
increased infection load. More interesting is the fact that
expression of this protein is differently involved in the
mosquitos' defenses against different species of Plasmodium. In another presentation, Eloi Garcia (FIOCRUZ,
Brazil) reported the role of eicosanoids in trypanosomatid-triatomine interactions. He focused his talk on the
interaction of Rhodnius prolixus with Trypanosoma rangeli.
The vector is infected when it feeds; the parasite proliferates in the gut and is eliminated with faeces but in approximately 10% of the insects the flagellates penetrate the gut
wall and reach the salivary gland. Data published in 2004
showed that eicosanoids produced by insect cells protect
the vector against T. rangeli induced mortality. The
increase in mortality is correlated with decrease in aggregation of hemocytes, the defense cells that are present in
the insect hemolymph. In contrast, hemocyte microaggre-

gation is promoted by arachidonic acid, which protects
the insects. Possible platelet-activating factor (PAF) like
molecules are being proposed to mediate these aggregation effects since the WEB 2086, a PAF agonist, increased
insect survival, at the same time that less hemocytes aggregation was seen.
The meeting's closing conference was given by Antonio
Teixeira (UnB, Brazil) who discussed the pathology of
Chagas Disease and evidence that T. cruzi is in fact the
genetic vector of kinetoplast DNA. The integration of parasite kDNA into the vertebrate genome in this scenario
would be responsible for the immunopathology of Chagas' disease.
