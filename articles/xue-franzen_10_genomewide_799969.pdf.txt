histone acetyltransferase in budding yeast during
stress adaptation reveals evolutionarily conserved
and diverged roles

Abstract
Background: Gcn5 is a transcriptional coactivator with histone acetyltransferase activity that is conserved with
regard to structure as well as its histone substrates throughout the eukaryotes. Gene regulatory networks within
cells are thought to be evolutionarily diverged. The use of evolutionarily divergent yeast species, such as S.
cerevisiae and S. pombe, which can be studied under similar environmental conditions, provides an opportunity to
examine the interface between conserved regulatory components and their cellular applications in different
organisms.
Results: We show that Gcn5 is important for a common set of stress responses in evolutionarily diverged yeast
species and that the activity of the conserved histone acetyltransferase domain is required. We define a group of
KCl stress response genes in S. cerevisiae that are specifically dependent on Gcn5. Gcn5 is localised to many Gcn5dependent genes including Gcn5 repressed targets such as FLO8. Gcn5 regulates divergent sets of KCl responsive
genes in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. Genome-wide localization studies showed a tendency for redistribution of
Gcn5 during KCl stress adaptation in S. cerevisiae from short genes to the transcribed regions of long genes. An
analogous redistribution was not observed in S. pombe.
Conclusions: Gcn5 is required for the regulation of divergent sets of KCl stress-response genes in S. cerevisiae and
S. pombe even though it is required a common group of stress responses, including the response to KCl. Genes
that are physically associated with Gcn5 require its activity for their repression or activation during stress
adaptation, providing support for a role of Gcn5 as a corepressor as well as a coactivator. The tendency of Gcn5 to
re-localise to the transcribed regions of long genes during KCl stress adaptation suggests that Gcn5 plays a specific
role in the expression of long genes under adaptive conditions, perhaps by regulating transcriptional elongation as
has been seen for Gcn5 in S. pombe. Interestingly an analogous redistribution of Gcn5 is not seen in S. pombe. The
study thus provides important new insights in relation to why coregulators like Gcn5 are required for the correct
expression of some genes but not others.

Background
Evolutionary changes frequently involve modifications
to gene regulatory programs. Several lines of evidence
indicate the importance of transcriptional regulation in
evolution. First, comparative studies have shown that

cis-acting regulatory elements that are binding sites for
regulatory transcription factors evolve rapidly [1-3].
Second, the proportion of genes encoding transcription
factors is higher in genomes encoding larger proteomes consistent with the disproportionately higher
regulatory requirements of more complex organisms
[4-7], For example, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has about 100 genes encoding homeobox transcription factors [8] compared to 7 such genes in yeast

(S. cerevisiae) [4,9], while the total proteome in the
nematode is less than 4-fold larger than that in yeast.
Third, several yeast species whose common ancestor
has undergone whole genome duplication have preferentially maintained paralogous pairs of transcription
factors during the re-haploidisation process that
ensued, suggesting that transcription factors have a
higher than average evolutionary potential [4]. Finally,
it has been suggested that non-coding RNA, which is
much more abundant in complex organisms with large
genomes, plays important roles in regulating the transcription levels of genes [10]. More recently it has
been suggested that protein interactions between transcription factors and co-regulator proteins they recruit
to target genes may also be important for evolutionary
potential [11,12]. Thus, evolutionary changes in the
interactions of transcription factors with DNA binding
sites and the co-regulators they recruit would predict
that the involvement of co-regulator proteins in different regulatory pathways should be evolutionarily
diverged.
Gcn5 is a phylogenetically conserved transcriptional
co-regulator that is found throughout the eukaryotes.
Gcn5 was the first transcriptional co-regulator protein
shown to contain a histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
activity [13] and it is the catalytic subunit of several
related HAT complexes, notably the SAGA complex
[14]. These complexes acetylate lysine residues in chromatin, primarily within the N-terminus of histone H3
[15]. The subunit composition of the SAGA complex is
highly conserved across the large evolutionary distance
between S. cerevisiae and S. pombe [16]. The SAGA
complex is a direct target for recruitment by transcriptional activators in vitro [17,18] and in vivo [19] and is
physically associated to a greater or lesser extent with
the promoter and/or transcribed regions of many
expressed genes in S. cerevisiae [17] and S. pombe [20].
The HAT domain is the most highly conserved part of
Gcn5 and it has been shown to be inter-changeable
between humans and yeast [21]. Gcn5 is thus structurally conserved throughout evolution and appears to
function in a conserved fashion by acetylating a conserved set of lysine residues in target proteins. Interestingly, Gcn5 has also been reported to be important for
regulation of stress-response genes in budding and fission yeasts [22,23], suggesting that some physiological
roles of Gcn5 may also have been conserved but this
has not been studied systematically.
Yeasts offer a powerful system for comparative studies
because highly divergent organisms can be cultured and
manipulated under comparable environmental conditions [24]. Our previous studies show a specific role of
fission yeast Gcn5 in programming a subset of stress
response genes in S. pombe [22]. To further understand

functional and evolutionary aspects of Gcn5, we here
study the equivalent stress responses in the evolutionarily diverged budding yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. kluyveri.
We show that Gcn5 is required for a common set of
stress responses in the budding and fission yeasts. We
further report results from a genome-wide study of
Gcn5’s role in the KCl stress response in S. cerevisiae
that is comparable to our previous studies in S. pombe.
The results reveal interesting novel insights with regard
to the function of Gcn5 in S. cerevisiae and show that it
regulates a different set of stress genes compared to
those identified in S. pombe. Further, we show that
Gcn5 is located throughout the transcribed regions of
many S. cerevisiae genes as has also been shown for S.
pombe [20], but that there are also mechanistic differences in Gcn5 action between the two species. The
study provides an interesting view of the interface
between aspects of a transcriptional regulator that are
highly conserved and their functionally divergent applications in evolutionarily distant species.

Results and Discussion
Gcn5 is required for several common stress responses in
divergent yeast species

To compare the physiological roles of Gcn5 over a large
evolutionary interval, we chose to compare the phenotype of gcn5Δ mutants in S. cerevisiae and its distant
budding yeast relative S. kluyveri, using a range of environmental stress conditions, including several conditions
where Gcn5 dependence has previously been demonstrated in S. pombe [22]. First, we replaced the GCN5
gene from wild type S. kluyveri with a standard KANMX cassette as described in the Materials and Methods.
Fig. 1A shows the result of testing the phenotypes of
gcn5Δ mutants of the three yeast species under different
environmental-stress conditions. gcn5Δ mutants in S.
pombe are not distinguishable from wild type cells on
rich medium as shown previously [22], but they show a
mild growth deficiency in S. cerevisiae and S. kluyveri.
We observed that Gcn5 was required in S. cerevisiae
and S. kluyveri for adaptation to stresses mediated by
KCl and CaCl2 as previously observed in S. pombe [22].
Gcn5 is also required in all three species for other stress
conditions, such as Calcoflour White, MnCl2 and Caffeine. These common stress sensitivity phenotypes suggest a specific phenotypically conserved role for Gcn5
because Gcn5 dependence is not universally observed in
the three different species for a range of other stress
conditions. These conditions include LiCl, MgCl2, NaCl
and sorbitol for which none of the yeasts require Gcn5
for stress adaptation. Also for ethanol, elevated temperature and SDS, Gcn5 appears to be differentially important in the different yeast species (see Additional file 1).

Figure 1 Gcn5 is required for several common stress responses in divergent yeast species and defects in its conserved histone
acetyltransferase domain cause stress sensitivity. (A) Gcn5 is required for efficient growth under a common set of environmental stress
conditions in evolutionarily divergent yeast species. The figure shows serial dilutions of wild type (wt) or mutant (gcn5Δ) yeast cells spotted on
normal growth media (control) or media containing stress inducing levels of KCl, CaCl2, Calcoflour White, MnCl2 and caffeine. (B) The domain

boundaries are shown. The extent of domain identity between S. cerevisiae and S. pombe is shown (%). The approximate position of each
mutant triple-alanine substitution mutant, starting at residues 126, 129 and 132 respectively, is shown. (C) The HAT activity of Gcn5 is required
for Gcn5 dependent stress responses. Cell plating assay performed as in Fig. 1A showing S. cerevisiae gcn5Δ cells carrying pRS316 plasmids
expressing either wild type GCN5 or GCN5 with substitution mutations in the HAT domain as indicated in (B). Wild type (wt) and GCN5- (gcn5Δ)
cells were used as controls.

differences is shown in Additional File 1. The conserved
stress conditions thus provide ideal models for studying
divergence and evolvability of gene regulation in evolutionarily distant organisms. To facilitate comparison of
Gcn5’s role in the conserved stress responses of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, it was necessary to further characterize the stress response role of Gcn5 in S. cerevisiae.
Defects in the conserved HAT activity of Gcn5 cause
stress sensitivity

The HAT domain of Gcn5 is the most conserved domain
with a sequence homology of 67% between budding yeast
and human [25]. To test whether Gcn5 HAT activity is
important for the stress response we tested the ability of
plasmids expressing wild type or mutant gcn5 alleles,
containing triple alanine substitutions, to rescue the salt
sensitivity of gcn5Δ. The Gcn5-KQL and Gcn5-PKM substitution mutants have previously been shown to abolish
HAT activity, while the Gcn5-PKE mutant maintains full
catalytic activity [25]. The relative location of the
mutated amino acid residues in the Gcn5 HAT domain is
indicated in Fig. 1B. Expression of wild type Gcn5 and
Gcn5-PKE restores wild type growth levels during KCl
and CaCl2 stress while strains expressing the Gcn5-PKM
and Gcn5-KQL proteins with defective HAT activity display the same level of stress sensitivity as gcn5Δ (Fig. 1C).
We conclude that the conserved HAT activity of Gcn5 is
required for its role in stress responses.

Identification of Gcn5 dependent KCl stress response
genes

Next, we investigated the role of Gcn5 in the KCl stress
response of S. cerevisiae. Comparison of the expression
profiles for gcn5Δ cells in relation to wild type in the
absence and presence of KCl showed that a significant
number of genes become more dependent on Gcn5
under KCl stress conditions, as shown by the broader
distribution of Gcn5-dependent effects in the presence
of KCl (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, there is a fairly equal distribution between genes that require Gcn5 for expression, consistent with its role as a coactivator, and genes
that are directly or indirectly repressed by Gcn5. To
define a group of Gcn5 dependent KCl responsive
genes, we selected a group of 92 genes as summarised
in Fig. 3B. Briefly, the group of 92 genes contains KClinduced genes that show reduced expression in the
gcn5Δ mutant during KCl stress (64 genes, see Additional file 3) as well as KCl-repressed genes that show
increased expression in gcn5Δ during KCl stress (28
genes, Additional file 3). The gene ontology categories
most significantly associated with Gcn5 dependant KCl
response genes (Table 2) include categories that would
be expected to play an important role during adaptation
to KCl stress conditions, such as ion homeostasis.

Identification of KCl stress response genes

To study how Gcn5 is involved in the KCl stress response
of S. cerevisiae, we first identified genes with changed
expression levels during KCl adaptation in wild type
cells. Fig. 2A shows that many genes show either
increased or decreased expression in response to KCl
(see also gene list in Additional file 2). The gene ontology
terms most significantly associated with the sets of KClinduced and repressed genes are shown in Table 1. The
response to KCl-stress conditions is complex but appears
to include down-regulation of some general cellular functions (e.g. translation, amino acid biosynthesis) as well as
induced expression of genes involved in stress adaptation
(e.g. stress response and ion homeostasis). Down regulation of genes involved in protein synthesis during the
response of S. cerevisiae to other stress conditions has
been reported previously [26,27]. More than 30% of
genes regulated during KCl adaptation are general environmental stress response genes [28] (Fig. 2B). We found
a similar proportion of common stress response genes
among the KCl stress response genes of S. pombe, as
described previously [22]. We also found similar gene
ontology categories for KCl-induced genes in both yeast
species, such as response to stress/stimuli, oxidoreductase activity and carbohydrate metabolic process.

environmental stress response genes in S. cerevisiae. (A) Scatter

change in expression. (B) A subset of KCl response genes is

Characterization of direct Gcn5 target genes

We validated several Gcn5-dependent KCl response
genes by semi-quantitative PCR (Additional file 4A).
This group includes a membrane transporter VMR1
(YHL035C) and a heat-shock-response gene SSA4
(YER103W). The latter is consistent with a recent report
that Gcn5 and Elp3 induced histone H3 acetylation is
important for regulating Hsp70 expression [29]. Interestingly, we also confirmed that the FLO8 gene, which
encodes a transcriptional regulator, is up-regulated in
gcn5Δ (Fig. 4A, left panel). This is typical of many Gcn5
dependent genes and its dependence on Gcn5 for its
stress-regulated repression is of interest because Gcn5 is
generally regarded as a transcriptional activator. One
possibility is that up-regulation of FLO8 in gcn5Δ could
be an indirect effect of the Gcn5 defect. To identify
direct targets of Gcn5 we performed ChIP-on-chip
experiments to identify the genome-wide localisation of
myc-tagged Gcn5 using high resolution tiling arrays
under the KCl stress conditions in which Gcn5 is

required for FLO8 expression. This analysis showed
reproducible interaction of Gcn5 with the FLO8 transcribed region under KCl stress conditions, suggesting
direct repression of FLO8 expression by Gcn5 (Fig. 4A,
middle panel). Direct association of Gcn5 with FLO8
was further confirmed by semi-quantitative PCR (Fig.
4A, right panel), The antibody used for precipitation of
Gcn5-myc is specific because no signals were detected
either in the absence of antibody or in a strain lacking
the specific epitope tag in the presence of antibody (see
Additional file 4B). We conclude that Gcn5 functions as
a negative regulator for FLO8 under KCl stress conditions. A repressive role of the Gcn5-containing SAGA
complex has been reported previously. In S. cerevisiae,
Gcn5 is required for repression of ARG1 on rich media
where expression is not required but the role of Gcn5
switches on minimal media, where it is required for
induction of ARG1 [30]. A similar function of Gcn5 and
the SAGA complex has been reported in S. pombe, in
which Gcn5 represses ste11 and mei2, while another

SAGA subunit, Spt8 is required for their activation
under inducing conditions [31].
As expected, we observed enriched association of Gcn5myc on many Gcn5-dependent genes. However, there
are other Gcn5-dependent genes for which we do not
observe enrichment of Gcn5. The detection of transcription factor genes, such as FLO8, among the direct Gcn5
targets suggests that many of the indirect target genes
might be regulated by such transcription factors. This is
true for Flo8, where 39 of 44 Flo8 target genes identified
previously [32] are dependent on Gcn5 in our study. Of
these 39 genes, 37 were up-regulated and 2 were downregulated in the absence of FLO8. In gcn5Δ cells, where
FLO8 is up-regulated, these genes show the opposite
regulatory patterns as would be expected if their Gcn5
dependence is an indirect consequence of defects in the
direct regulation of FLO8 by Gcn5 (Fig. 4B).
Changes in the pattern of Gcn5 localization under stress
conditions

To analyse the genome-wide pattern of Gcn5 localisation as well as whether the localisation pattern changes
upon KCl stress, we analysed the distribution of Gcn5
within genes in the absence and presence of KCl using
average gene analysis. In this method, data for each
gene is mapped onto a hypothetical gene of average
length, thus allowing studies of average Gcn5 distribution across a model gene for different groups of genes.
First we examined the average localisation of Gcn5 in
sets of genes that are either up-regulated, down-regulated or unchanged in cells lacking Gcn5 (Fig. 5A). In
the absence of KCl, Gcn5 tends to be most abundant at
or close to the promoter region (Fig. 5A left panel).
This is consistent with previous data showing that Gcn5
is localised predominately to promoter regions [33] as
well as the known pattern of histone acetylation within
genes [34,35]. In the presence of KCl, the average localisation of Gcn5 is predominantly within the transcribed
region of genes (Fig. 5A right panel). The changed average distribution of Gcn5 to transcribed regions during
KCl stress conditions suggests a role of Gcn5 in the
transcribed regions of genes under these conditions.
Such a role has been suggested for Gcn5 on the GAL1
gene where it appears to play a transcription-coupled
role in nucleosome eviction in the transcribed region
[36] during induction of the gene by galactose. Recently
we showed that Gcn5 plays an important role in transcriptional elongation in S. pombe [20]. It is thus possible that an elongation-related role of Gcn5 may be
conserved throughout the eukaryotes.
In S. pombe, Gcn5 tends to be preferentially located
within the transcribed regions of highly expressed genes
in the absence of stress [20]. To test whether this is so
in S. cerevisiae we used average gene analysis to test the

Page 8 of 16

distribution of Gcn5 in sets of genes containing genes
expressed at different levels (Fig. 5B). In the absence of
stress Gcn5 tends to be preferentially localised to highly
expressed genes but it is not preferentially located in the
transcribed region. However, during KCl stress the average localisation of Gcn5 is in the transcribed region but
its preference for highly expressed genes under these
conditions is marginal and may not be significant.
It was reported previously [36] that a very long coding
region expressed from the GAL1 promoter was more
sensitive to defects in Gcn5 than the normal GAL1
gene, which has a shorter coding region. In particular,
the level of RNA Polymerase II at the 3’-end of the
long-gene coding region was sensitive to defects in
Gcn5. This suggests that Gcn5 might be particularly
important for transcription of long genes in S. cerevisiae.
To investigate this at the genome-wide level we used
average gene analysis to study the distribution of Gcn5
on gene sets containing genes of different length, both
in the absence and presence of KCl stress (Fig. 5C). In
the absence of stress (Fig. 5C, left panel) the level of
Gcn5 at transcribed regions is inversely related to their
length. This pattern is completely changed upon KCl
stress, where there is a clear positive correlation
between the levels of Gcn5 in the transcribed regions
and gene length (Fig. 5C, right panel).
The changes in the average distribution of Gcn5 upon
KCl stress could be due to a shift in the location of
Gcn5 on individual genes or it could result from
enhanced or depleted levels of Gcn5 on specific classes
of genes that together make up the observed average
localisation patterns. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used K-means clustering to identify the
most clearly defined gene sets according to their average
Gcn5 localisation pattern (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, we
identified five gene clusters for which the average Gcn5
localisation pattern was representative of the majority of
individual genes within the cluster (see Additional file
5). Comparison of the average Gcn5 localisation for
these clusters in the absence and presence of KCl
showed differences that can account for the overall
changes in average Gcn5 localisation. Notably, Cluster 2,
containing genes for which Gcn5 tends to be located in
the transcribed region, shows enhanced Gcn5 association in response to stress. Furthermore, Cluster 3, containing genes with an even distribution of Gcn5
throughout the gene, shows a strong reduction in the
average level of Gcn5 association. The changes in these
two clusters are the main reasons for the apparent shift
of Gcn5 to transcribed regions during stress. The
remaining clusters show smaller changes in the average
Gcn5 localisation pattern but the subtle changes that do
occur also tend to specifically enhance the level of average Gcn5 association with transcribed regions.

Strikingly, Cluster 2 is significantly enriched in long
genes (>2000 bp, p = 1.31 E-67); it contains 605 genes
that are longer than 2000 bp, representing about half of
all the genes within this length category. Cluster 3 is significantly enriched in short genes (<500 bp, p = 5.85 E47) and includes 301 genes shorter than 500 bp. Thus,
adaptation to KCl stress is associated with a net transfer
of Gcn5 from short genes, where it tends to be evenly
distributed throughout genes, to long genes, in which it
is predominantly localised within the transcribed region.
Fig. 6 shows the re-distribution of Gcn5 on individual
genes chosen from Clusters 2 and 3 in response to KCl
mediated stress. The Gcn5 redistribution between different genes thus accounts for the changes in average
Gcn5 localisation shown in Fig. 5C.
Comparative analysis of gene regulation by Gcn5 during
stress adaptation

Since gene regulatory networks evolve rapidly (see
Introduction), we did not expect Gcn5 to be involved
in evolutionarily conserved functional applications
even though it is a highly conserved protein at the
structural and mechanistic levels. It was therefore of
interest that Gcn5 plays a role in adaptation to a
common set of stress responses in evolutionarily
divergent yeasts (Fig. 1A). To determine whether
cross-species conservation is also seen at the level of
Gcn5 target genes, we identified a set of Gcn5-dependent KCl response genes in S. pombe (123 genes, see
Additional file 6) in previously published microarray
data [22], using the same criteria as for S. cerevisiae
data in this work. Gene Ontology analysis showed
that several functional categories are enriched in
Gcn5 dependent KCl response genes in both yeasts
(e.g. transmembrane transporter activity, iron-ion
binding, glutamate metabolic process). To compare
whether orthologous pairs of genes are involved in
Gcn5 dependent adaptation to KCl stress in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, we used unambiguous orthologous
relationships that have been predicted for 2900 pairs
of genes [37], which is about half of all S. cerevisiae
genes. Comparison of the 92 Gcn5 dependent KCl
responsive genes in S. cerevisiae with the equivalent
group of 123 genes identified in S. pombe revealed
only 2 cases where both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe
genes were members of an orthologous group, with
the same regulation pattern (Fig. 7A). The extent of
the overlap is at a level that would be expected by
chance and may thus not be statistically significant.
The two orthologous pairs are YDL171C-SPAB1E7.07,
encoding a glutamate synthase, which has a function
in detoxification, and YDR223W-SPAC22H10.11C,
encoding a transcriptional corepressor, involved in
the regulation of ribosomal protein gene

transcription. It was formally possible that the KCl
response could be so diverged between the two yeast
species at the gene level, that there would be few or
no co-regulated orthologous gene pairs that are
potential targets for Gcn5. However, this appears not
to be the case since there are many orthologous gene
pairs that are regulated similarly in response to KCl
stress in both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (Additional
file 7). We conclude that Gcn5 regulates divergent
sets of KCl responsive genes in S. cerevisiae and S.
pombe.
Finally, we wanted to find out if there is a similar
change in the distribution pattern of Gcn5 when cells
are subjected to stress conditions in the two yeasts.
To allow comparison with the S. cerevisiae ChIP-onchip data described above we performed analogous
ChIP-on-chip experiments to determine the localisation of Gcn5-myc in S. pombe during KCl stress adaptation. Equivalent data in the absence of stress have
been published recently [20]. We selected groups of
genes from S. cerevisiae and S. pombe that showed a
level of Gcn5 enhancement greater than 2.6-fold (log2
1.4) in both the absence and presence of KCl. The
localisation pattern in S. cerevisiae differs between the
two conditions consistent with the results in Fig. 5
(Fig. 7B upper panel), while the pattern for Gcn5-myc
in S. pombe is similar under both conditions (Fig. 7B
lower panel). The different behaviour of S. cerevisiae
and S. pombe suggests that there are differences in
the redistribution behaviour of Gcn5 between the two
yeasts.
The results published here provide new insights
regarding the role of coregulator proteins such as Gcn5
during physiological adaptation in the budding yeast, S.
cerevisiae. The results also provide insights about how
the enzymatically conserved Gcn5 protein is utilized
divergently in evolutionarily divergent organisms.
Although Gcn5 plays a role in a set of stress responses
that seems to be conserved across the large evolutionary
distance between budding and fission yeasts, we find
that Gcn5 is important for the expression of divergent
sets of genes during adaptation to at least one of these
stress conditions. This finding is consistent with existing
findings that support the highly evolvable nature of gene
regulation networks (see Introduction). The divergent
requirement for Gcn5 might thus be due to altered
recruitment to target genes as a result of changes in the
position or composition of transcription factor binding
sites or changes in the repertoire of protein interaction
partners available to transcription factor proteins. A
recent comparative study provides a similar example
between much more closely related species, S. cerevisiae
and Candida glabrata [38]. The gene expression
responses to oxidative stress are remarkably conserved

Figure 7 Gcn5 differs in gene regulation and genome-wide localisation in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe during KCl stress adaptation. (A)
Gcn5 regulates different sets of KCl responsive genes in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. The Venn diagram shows the relationship between gene sets
identified in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. (B) The altered Gcn5-myc gene distribution pattern between normal and KCl-stress conditions in S.
cerevisiae is not observed in S. pombe. The average gene distribution of Gcn5-myc is shown for genes that are associated with Gcn5 in both the
absence and presence of KCl stress. The distribution of Gcn5 is shown for conditions in the absence (blue line) and presence of KCl (red line) for
S. cerevisiae (average of 383 genes, upper panel) and S. pombe (average of 504 genes, lower panel), respectively.

between these two species, but the underlying regulatory
networks differ. Each species appears to have different
response motifs and the oxidative stress response transcription factor (Yap1p in S. cerevisiae and Cgap1p in C.
glabrata) show clear differences in the way they “read”
the cis-regulatory elements present in target promoters.
Other examples of transcription networks, such as the

regulation of S-phase related transcription in budding
and fission yeasts by the MBF/SBF transcription factors,
show a high level of evolutionary conservation between
transcription factors and their target genes [39].
Gcn5 is a structurally and mechanistically conserved
protein that functions by acetylating other proteins,
notably histone H3, in a specific manner via its HAT

Xue-Franzén et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:200
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/200

domain or by specifically binding to acetylated histone
H3-K14 residues via its Bromo domain. As mentioned
above the difference in the identity of Gcn5-dependent
stress genes in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe is most likely
a result of divergence in the genes to which Gcn5 is
recruited in different yeasts, since gene regulation networks are known to evolve rapidly. Over the evolutionary distance separating S. cerevisiae and S. pombe we
would not expect to find any conservation of biological
function for the Gcn5 protein. It is thus interesting to
consider why Gcn5 function is required for a common
set of stress responses in the different yeast species studied here. One possibility is that the evolution of Gcn5
function is constrained by some aspect of its function,
other than the target genes it regulates. For example,
Gcn5, or perhaps other proteins in the SAGA complex,
could be regulated by evolutionarily conserved stressspecific signaling pathways that modulate Gcn5 activity.
This mechanism would require some stress genes to be
Gcn5 dependent but the identity of such genes could be
different in different yeasts. Interestingly, there are
known examples in which coregulators are direct targets
for signaling pathways [40]. It is also possible that loss
of Gcn5 recruitment to stress genes during evolution
often creates growth defects during stress that tend to
be suppressed by acquisition of Gcn5 recruitment by
other genes involved in the same stress response, as a
result of natural selection.
The results provide new insights into the mechanistic
role played by Gcn5 during stress adaptation, which
appear to show both similarities and differences between
S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. We provide further support
for the direct role of Gcn5 as a repressor of many genes
as has been suggested previously for both S. cerevisiae
and S. pombe (discussed above). The re-distribution of
Gcn5 between genes during stress adaptation appears to
be more dynamic in S. cerevisiae than in S. pombe,
where the average Gcn5 localisation profiles are similar
in the absence and presence of stress. The gene cluster
(Cluster 2) showing enhanced association of Gcn5 in
the transcribed region during stress adaptation contains
about one third of all the genes. 145 of these genes are
regulated during KCl adaptation and 199 are dependent
on Gcn5. These gene sets are significantly enriched in
long genes (p < 0.0005). Therefore, the enhanced Gcn5
binding during KCl adaptation can account for some of
the observed regulatory changes and Gcn5 may have a
role in transcribed gene regions that is specific for long
genes. The role of Gcn5 in transcribed regions is associated with the efficiency of transcriptional elongation in
S. pombe. This may also be the case in S. cerevisiae but
further studies are required to test this. Gcn5 has been
shown to be important for eviction of nucleosomes
from the transcribed region of the GAL1 gene [36],

Page 13 of 16

which would be consistent with an elongation role in S.
cerevisiae.

Conclusions
Gcn5 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that is
required for a common set of stress responses across a
highly divergent range of yeast species. These responses
require the activity of the conserved HAT domain but
are mediated by divergent sets of Gcn5 dependent
response genes in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. Gcn5 is
localised to S. cerevisiae genes that require its activity
for their repression as well as for activation, thus providing support for the suggestion that Gcn5 can function as
a direct repressor of gene activity in addition to its characterized role as a transcriptional coactivator. Gcn5
localisation tends to shift from short genes to the transcribed regions of long genes during stress adaptation in
S. cerevisiae. No such change is detectable in S. pombe.
In the absence of stress Gcn5 is preferentially localised
on highly expressed genes in S. cerevisiae, as previously
reported for S. pombe.
Methods
Strains, plasmids and growth conditions

The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 3.
The GCN5 deletion mutation in S. kluyveri, was made
by first inserting PCR products (c. 500 bp) containing
sequences up- and down-stream of the Gcn5 coding
sequence into pFA6a-KanMX6 at the BamHI and EcoRI
sites, respectively. The primers used are listed in Additional file 8. A DNA fragment containing the KanMX
cassette flanked by the up- and down-stream flanking
regions was then amplified and transformed into the
wild type strain of S. kluyveri, Y090. Kanamycin resistant
colonies in which the Gcn5 coding region was replaced
by the KanMX cassette were selected on plates containing G418 (50 mg/ml) and confirmed by PCR.
S. cerevisiae strains expressing Gcn5 derivatives containing
substitution mutations in the HAT domain were made by
transferring mutant alleles of GCN5 from existing plasmids, PKE-pRS306, PKM-pRS306, KQL-pRS306, YG5pRS414 [25], to pRS316 [41]. The PvuI fragment from
the donor plasmid containing GCN5 replaced the equivalent fragment from pRS316 that lacked GCN5. The new
plasmids, PKE-pRS316, PKM-pRS316, KQL-pRS316, YG5pRS316 (control containing wild type GCN5) were transformed into gcn5Δ deletion strain BY7285 and BY17285
and transformants were selected on SD-ura plates.
S. cerevisiae and S. kluyveri strains were cultivated in
YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto peptone and
2% glucose) and S. pombe strains were cultivated in
YEA medium (0.5% yeast extract, 3% glucose, 0.2% casamino acids with 100 mg/L of adenine, uracil and leucine, respectively) All the spotting assays were

performed by spotting 5-fold serial dilutions of cells on
rich medium supplemented with different stress-inducing compounds as shown in Fig. 1A and Fig. 1C. Concentrations of KCl, CaCl2, Calcoflour White, MnCl2, and
caffeine for S. cerevisiae and S. kluyveri were 1 M, 0.25
M, 20 ug/ml, 4 mM and 6 mM, respectively. The
equivalent concentrations for S. pombe, were 1 M, 0.1
M, 2 mg/ml, 2 mM and 8 mM respectively. The growth
incubation temperature was 25°C for S. cerevisiae and S.
kluyveri and 30°C for S. pombe. For other stress conditions see Additional File 1.
Gene expression profiling

S. cerevisiae wild type and gcn5Δ strains were compared by
expression profiling under exponential growth conditions
at 25°C. To determine the effect of KCl stress on gene
expression, cells were treated as described in [22]. For
each condition, at least two biological replicates were
used. An equivalent number of replicates were analyzed
using each of the two possible Cy3/Cy5 dye orientations
on double spotted microarray slides (Eurogentec SA Seraing, Belgium) and the results were used to calculate the
mean fold change value for each gene for each condition
tested. RNA extraction, probe labelling and hybridization
were performed as previously described [42]. Slides were
scanned using a Bio-rad VersArray ChipReader and quantified with Imagene 4.2 software. All the primary data
were normalized by Lowess normalization using GeneSpring software. Regulated genes were defined as genes for
which the fold changes exceeded a level equivalent to one
standard deviation about the overall population mean and
for which the change was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
The significance of gene expression changes was assessed
using Student’s t-test to determine the probability that
mean fold change values differ from a ratio of one. The
null hypothesis tested was that there is no difference.

Unchanged genes were defined as genes having a fold
change value less than 1.2. All gene expression profiling
data analyzed in this study is available at Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/
geo under accession number: SuperSeriesGSE 16556/Subset series GSE5218.
ChIP-on-chip microarray

Two biological replicates are used to study enriched binding sites of Gcn5-myc under normal conditions and 1 M
KCl treatment conditions in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.
The ChIP-on chip experiments were carried out as in [20]
except the differences in material in culture medium (S.
cerevisiae: YPD, S. pombe: YES) and array used (GeneChip
S. cerevisiae Tiling 1.0R, Genechip S. pombe tiling 1.0FR).
The data are available at GEO under accession number:
SuperSeriesGSE 16556/Subset series GSE16514.
ChIP-on-chip data analysis

Raw data from Affymetrix (CEL format) were analyzed
using Model-based Analysis for Tiling-array (MAT) software [43] with a bandwidth of 250 in order to identify
regions enriched in Gcn5. Visualization of data was performed using Affymetrix integrated genome Browser
(IGB). Average gene analysis was done as in Johnsson et
al [20]. ChIP-on-chip data of normal conditions and
KCl stress conditions were normalized in order to have
the same overall standard deviation and mean value.
Gene with different expression levels were assigned into
three groups by the mean signal intensities of at least
three biological replicates of cDNA wild type cells on
double spotted cDNA microarray slides (from SuperSeriesGSE 16556/Subset series GSE5218). K-means cluster
analysis was performed using GeneSpring software. The
number of clusters and iterations was 5 and 100 respectively. Standard correlation was used as the similarity
measure.

Verification of gene expression and CHIP-on-chip data with
semi-quantitative PCR

To verify the gene expression profiling results, cell treatment and RNA extraction were as previously described
[22,42]. Reverse transcription of RNA was carried out
using reagents from Fermentas (Cat. No. K1611) according to the manufacturers instructions, followed by PCR.
To verify the enriched binding of Gcn5-Myc from
CHIP-on-chip data, chromatin immunoprecipitation was
carried out as described above without the amplification
step. Semi quantitative PCR was used to compare
immuniprecipitated material for binding and non-binding regions (indicated in the Fig. 4A as fragment A and
B) in relation to input (chromatin extract before IP).
The primers used are shown in Additional file 8.
Gene ontology analysis

GoMiner http://discover.nci.nih.gov/gominer/ was used
to find gene ontology (GO) terms that are significantly
enriched in selected sets of genes with different expression patterns in relation to the frequency of their occurrence in the set of all genes (p ≤ 0.02). p-values were
not corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. The statistical analysis performed by the GoMiner algorithm is
fully discussed elsewhere [44].
