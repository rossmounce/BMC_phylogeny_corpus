Abstract
Background: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important process, which contributes in
bacterial pathogenesis and drug resistance. A number of methods have been proposed for
detection of horizontal gene transfer. One successful approach to the detection of HGT events is
due to Novichkov et al. (J. Bacteriology 186, 6575–85), who rely on comparing phylogenetic
distances within a gene family with genomic distances of the source organisms. Building on their
approach, we introduce outlier detection in the correlation between those two sets of distances.
This approach is designed to detect horizontal transfers of core set of genes present in many
bacteria. The principle behind method allows detection of xenologous gene displacements as well
as acquisition of novel genes.
Results: Simulations indicated that our method performs better than Novichkov et al's original
approach. The approach very efficiently identified HGT between distantly related bacteria and also
a limited number of gene transfers between closely related bacteria. In combination with sequence
similarity and likelihood tests, it yields a measure robust enough to derive a set of 171 genes
deemed likely to have been horizontally transferred. Further analysis of these 171 established
horizontal transfer events gave interesting insights in the direction of transfer.
Conclusion: The majority of transfers between archaea and bacteria have occurred in the
direction from bacteria to archaea rather than the other way round. Genes transferred between
the archaea and bacteria are mostly metabolic genes. On the other hand, genes transferred within
the bacterial phyla are mainly involved in translation.

Background
Transfer and subsequent incorporation of genetic material
from one organism to a phylogenetically distinct organism is termed Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). Horizontally transferred genes are thought to confer biological
properties, which are beneficial to the host organism. It is
also often seen that a horizontally transferred gene provides the recipient organism better compatibility with its

ecological environment. One of the examples of such ecological adaptation is the presence of horizontally acquired
archaeal genes in the thermophilic bacteria like Aquifex
aeolicus [1]. Bacteria are also known to acquire antibiotic
resistance as well as virulence properties via HGT [2]. Horizontal gene transfer thus contributes to bacterial evolution and possibly plays an important role in speciation
[3].

A number of methods have been proposed to detect horizontally transferred genes. These can be broadly classified
as nucleotide compositional methods, phylogenetic
methods and similarity based methods. The basic idea
behind compositional methods is that each genome has a
compositional signature [4-6] and hence, genes acquired
from foreign genomes are expected to be distinct in their
composition from the rest of the host genome. Phylogenetic methods, on the other hand, rely on comparison of
a gene tree with a reference tree and subsequent detection
of incoherence [3,6,7]. Similarity-based methods generally use BLAST based searches to find the most related
sequence [1,8,9]. If this closest Blast hit is from a distant
taxon, then the sequence is identified as horizontally
transferred.
Compositional methods are computationally less
demanding than phylogenetic methods. They require
only knowledge of the genome under study. The fundamental problem with compositional methods is the
assumption that the same genomic signature can be
applied to all parts of the genome, thus possibly mistaking compositionally biased proteins like membrane proteins or ribosomal proteins for horizontally transferred
genes. In addition, these methods are unable to detect
transfer among compositionally similar organisms. It is
also often difficult to determine the source of a horizontally transferred gene using compositional methods.
The phylogenetic methods are most rigorous and probably most accurate but are computationally more demanding. It is very difficult to automate tree comparison
methods. Hence, most of the phylogenetic studies on horizontal gene transfer are focused on few genomes or few
gene families.
Although similarity based methods are computationally
less demanding, these methods have been criticized
because the closest BLAST hit does not necessarily imply
phylogenetic proximity [10]. The strength of their predictions depends on the sequence similarity criteria used. It
has been also reported that genome size and variability in
rates of evolution can affect results of these methods [11].
Like compositional methods, on their own, sequence similarity methods cannot detect the direction of transfer,
either. In addition, some of the similarity based methods
like the one described by Podell and Gaasterland [8]
require knowledge of a whole proteome. As observed by
these authors, such an approach can lead to false positives
in case of insufficient database coverage of the given species. It has been shown that the HGT predictions by different methods have very little overlap [12].
Novichkov et al. proposed a robust approach for detecting
HGTs which involves neither building phylogenetic trees

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/9

nor compositional analysis [13]. This approach is based
on comparing evolutionary distances within a set of
orthologs to corresponding intergenomic distances (Figure 1). In the absence of HGT and under uniform evolutionary rates, one expects that evolutionary distances
between orthologs and corresponding intergenomic distances display a linear relationship (Figure 1A). A gene
transfer between a donor species and an acceptor species,
however, will result in outliers (Fig. 1B). Novichkov et al.
used multiple statistical tests to rank genes according to
their probability to have been horizontally transferred.
They applied this method to selected genomes and to
selected groups of orthologous proteins (Clusters of
Orthologous Groups of proteins, COGs), which share
same function [14]. This approach was designed to detect
xenologous gene displacement (XGD), in which a gene is
displaced by an ortholog from different lineage.
Here, we simplify Novichkov et al.'s approach by introducing one single measure, Cook's distance [15,16], to
detect HGT. This simplification helps us to apply the
method to a much larger set of genomes and a much
larger number of COGs than analyzed by Novichkov et al.
Using simulation we demonstrate that our method can
detect horizontal transfer at much closer distance than
Novichkov et al.'s method. Combining this approach with
sequence similarity we can also detect the direction of
HGT.
In this study, we analyzed 1965 orthologous protein families from the COG database [see Additional file 1]. Combining the proposed protocol with stringent sequence
similarity search and likelihood tests, we have also built a
dataset of 171 genes, which, with high confidence, have
undergone horizontal transfers. Our analysis of these 171
HGTs between different prokaryotic domains gives interesting insights into the direction of transfers as well as
functional characteristics of transferred genes. We find
that most of the transfers between archaea and bacteria
have occurred from bacteria to archaea. The majority of
genes transferred between archaea and bacteria are
involved in metabolism, while most of the transfers
within the bacterial domain involve translational genes.

Results
As previously mentioned, in the absence of HGT, distances among proteins, evolving at constant rate, should
be proportional to the respective genomic distances (Fig.
1A). A gene transfer between a donor species and an
acceptor species, however, will result in individual protein
distances that disagree with the corresponding genomic
distances (Fig. 1B). Such transferred genes can thus be
detected as outliers. After analyzing several outlier detection measures, we found that Cook's distance (CDISS)
performed well for outlier detection. As described in

It needs to be mentioned that rare cases of horizontal
transfer of ribosomal genes are known [17,18]. However,
availability and analysis of a large number of prokaryotic
genomes have shown that evolutionary relationships
among prokaryotes are generally well represented by 16S
rRNA sequences [19,20].

Figure 1
Schematic diagram of changes in protein distances with HGT
Schematic diagram of changes in protein distances
with HGT. (A) In a protein family where no horizontal
transfer of gene has occurred, the protein tree will exactly
follow species tree. In such a case, plotting genomic distances
vs. protein distances will show a perfect correlation. (B) On
the other hand, if a gene is horizontally transferred, e.g., from
species SA to species SB, the protein tree will not resemble
the species tree. In this case, some protein distances (like
BC) will appear to be greater and some other protein distances (like AB) will appear to be smaller than the corresponding genomic distances. These outlying points (BC, AB)
will result in disturbance in correlation and can be detected
with Cook's distance.
Methods, we used an average CDISS value, <CDISS>, for
all the distances involving a gene under study. In this
paper, we used this approach to analyze HGT in large
number of proteins families.
For this analysis, we relied on Clusters of Orthologous
Groups of proteins or COGs [14]. The orthologous groups
in COG database were built by automated sequence
searches, followed by careful manual curation for functional conservation. We further filtered COGs to retain
only 1965 groups, which show reasonable correlation
between inter-protein and intergenomic distances. These
measures were taken to ensure a constant rate of evolution.
Although there are various ways to calculate intergenomic
distances, none of them is without limitation. In this analysis, we utilized 16S rRNA sequences for this calculation.

Simulation and assessment of <CDISS> measure
In order to assess the performance of CDISS in detecting
HGT, we first carried out an in silico experiment. This simulation was performed on 8 COG families (COG1660,
COG1666, COG1949, COG2844, COG3091, COG3852,
COG4536, COG5007), which showed very high correlation (r >0.95 and p-val < 10-5) between rRNA and protein
distances. The correlation as well as the visual inspection
of the protein trees indicated that the phylogenies of these
families were very close to the species trees as derived
from 16S rRNA sequences. To simulate a HGT scenario for
a COG family, we randomly selected an acceptor and a
donor species. We replaced the protein-protein distances
involving acceptor species with corresponding distances
involving donor species. The procedure was carried out
100 times on each of the above 8 COGs. In each case, the
<CDISS> value corresponding to the horizontally transferred sequence was noted. Figure 2 shows an ROC curve
for this simulation at various cut-offs on <CDISS>. For
further calculations, the <CDISS> cut-off corresponding
to 5% false positives was chosen. At this cut-off, 90% of
true positives could be detected. It should be noted that a
realistic scenario, where the transferred gene can diverge
due to various cellular processes such as amelioration, can
be much more complicated and difficult to detect. On the
other hand, the protein sequences, which passed this
stringent cut-off, are very likely to have originated from
another organism.

Acquisition of a gene from a distant bacterium can result
in stronger disturbances in protein distances as compared
to gene transfer between closely related species. It is hence
easier to detect distant transfers compared to gene transfers between closer species. To evaluate the sensitivity of
the method, it is important to see the distribution of
genomic distances between acceptor and donor species in
our predictions. Figure 3A shows the percentage of correctly predicted HGT events at various transfer distances.
It can be seen that although the frequency of HGT
detected at closer transfer distances was low, the method
could detect a number of transfers between closely related
species. We could correctly detect around 40% of the
transfers between species, which are closer than a 16S
rRNA distance of 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site. In
the ideal case where the correlation between 16S rRNA
and protein distance was perfect (r = 1.0), the method
picked up all the simulated transfers, independent of the
distance.

For comparison, we also tested the approach of Novichkov et al. using this simulation. Again, we calculated the
number of correctly predicted HGTs in simulated transfers. Figure 3B shows the percentage of correctly predicted
HGTs at various transfer distances by their approach.
Using Novichkov et al. approach, smaller number of
HGTs was detected when compared to our method. Since
their method was designed to predict only XGDs, simulated transfers only at a 16S rRNA distance > 0.36 nucleotide substitutions per site could be identified.
Detection of HGT in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase families
The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are fundamental for the
process of translation. Many groups have studied the phylogenetic organization of these proteins [21-23]. The phylogenetic trees of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases show
various anomalies as compared to the species tree. These
anomalies have been explained by many genetic events
like gene duplication, domain acquisition, loss of genes as
well as horizontal gene transfer. In recent years, horizontal gene transfer in some of these molecules has been studied in detail [21,22,24-26]. These aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases constitute a good example to test the proposed method.

Table 1 lists aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for which there
is strong evidence supporting horizontal gene transfer. It
is interesting to see that our method predicted 6 out of 8
cases correctly. Among the remaining 2 cases, HGT in the
histidyl-tRNA synthetase family would have been predicted with slightly relaxed cut-off of 1.3/D.
The correlation plot of leucyl-tRNA synthetases is shown
in Fig. 4. Recently, a detailed analysis of this family has
shown that leucyl-tRNA synthetase has been horizontally
transferred from bacteria to the archaeon, Halobacterium
sp. NRC-1 [21]. It is clear from the Fig. 4 that the points
corresponding to Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (COG protein
ID, VNG2223G) stand out in the plot, and they were
picked up by our <CDISS> measure.
Percentage of transfer in different bacteria
After verifying our new method on previously characterized HGTs, we applied the method to 1965 protein families available in the COG database. These families show a
correlation coefficient above 0.3 (see Methods) between
protein and rRNA distances. Among these COGs, 4183
proteins were predicted as horizontally acquired. We
could also rank the genomes according to the percentage
of horizontally acquired genes [see Additional file 2].
Interestingly, for the top four of these genomes we find
independent evidence in the literature supporting this
high rate of HGT [1,27,28]. We observed the highest percentage of gene acquisition in Aquifex aeolicus and Meth-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/9

anosarcina acetivorans. It was shown earlier that
hyperthermophilic bacterium, A. aeolicus, has very high
percentage of genes with archaeal origin [1]. The
archaeon, M. acetivorans, was also previously predicted to
have acquired ~30% of genes from bacterial lineage [28].
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and Pyrococcus abyssi showed the
third and fourth highest percentage of HGT. The lowest
percentage was found among Lactococcus lactis, Pasteurella
multocida, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pyogenes,
Yersinia pestis and Escherichia coli. Previously, Koonin et al.
[27,28] have also shown that N. meningitidis and E. coli
display comparatively low percentage of horizontally
acquired genes.
Computing a core set of horizontally transferred genes
The 4183 proteins discussed above were picked up based
on the <CDISS> measure alone. Simulation results and
comparison with known biological examples indicated
that the <CDISS> measure picked up horizontally transferred genes in majority of the cases (Table 1). However,
to reduce the possibility of false-positives, we further
short-listed 171 proteins which show very high similarity
with a distant bacteria and hence probably have undergone HGT. These 171 genes have passed three stringent
criteria of HGT, viz. outlier detection, high sequence similarity with distant sequence and likelihood tests confirming anomalies in protein sequence trees. The Methods
Section describes the details of this filtering. We have high
confidence that these 171 genes have indeed undergone
horizontal gene transfer. We further divided these genes
based on the type of transfer. Among these 171 genes, 118
genes have been transferred between archaea and bacteria.
The remaining 53 genes have been transferred between
different bacteria.
Genes transferred between archaea and bacteria
The 118 genes, exchanged between archaea and bacteria
[see Additional file 3] were further divided into those,
which have been transferred from archaea to bacteria and
from bacteria to archaea. Surprisingly around 74% of
these transfers were from bacteria to archaea. A large
majority of transfers were to Methanosarcina acetivorans
(35.6%) and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (18.6%). Among
these archaeal genes, there were genes involved in pathways such as citric acid cycle, proline biosynthesis and
glycerol metabolism.

Among, the remaining 26% of genes, transferred from
archaea to bacteria, the majority were acquired by Firmicutes (9.3%), viz., Clostridium acetobutylicum (7.6%) and
Bacillus species (1.7%) and thermophiles (11.9%) viz.
Aquifex aeolicus (3.4%), Thermotoga maritima (5.9%) and
Deinococcus radiodurans (2.5%).

Therefore, we analyzed the functional categories of the
171 gene candidates, which most probably have been horizontally acquired – 118 transferred between archaea and
bacteria along with 53 transferred between bacterial
phyla. The analysis of their functional categories, as
described in COG, clearly showed distinct functional preferences among different groups of transferred genes. The
genes transferred from bacteria to archaea were very
strongly enriched in metabolism related genes (Fig. 5).
On the other hand, the genes, which were transferred
within the bacterial domain, were more populated with
translation related genes (COG category: J) than with metabolic genes (Fig. 5).

Discussion

ROC curve analysis carried out on simulated data
ROC curve analysis carried out on simulated data. As
described in the text, false positive accumulation rate and
true positive accumulation rate were calculated by varying
the <CDISS> cut-off at regular intervals. The false positive
and true positive rates at different <CDISS> cut-offs are
plotted.

Horizontal gene transfer between different bacterial phyla
A similar analysis was carried out on 53 genes [see Additional file 4] where transfer between different bacterial
phyla (rRNA distance > 0.3) is observed. The majority of
genes are acquired by the thermophiles (54.7%). The
highest number of genes was gained by Aquifex aeolicus
(37.7%), followed by Deinococcus radiodurans (13.2%)
and Thermotoga maritime (3.8%).
Functional characteristics of transferred genes
As mentioned earlier, the transferred genes are fixed in
genomes probably because they confer an evolutionary
advantage to the host. Different groups have analyzed
functional categories of horizontally transferred genes
and have reported conflicting results. Jain et al. [29] suggested that HGT may have preferentially occurred among
cell growth maintenance and metabolism-related genes
rather than among genes involved in transcription and
translation. In a separate study, Nakamura et al. [30]
found that horizontally transferred genes are biased
towards cell surface, DNA binding and pathogenicity
related functions. However, Choi and Kim [31] did not
find any strong preference for a particular functional category.

In this paper we proposed, a simple framework for detection of horizontal gene transfer. The general assumption
behind this framework is that genomic distances correlate
with distances of proteins, evolving at constant rate. The
procedure is based on detecting anomalies in correlation
of genomic and protein distances. In contrast to a related
previous study [13], the present approach is simpler and
defines a single parameter, Cook's distance, for detection
of HGT. This score performs well on simulated data as
well as on known biological examples. This approach can
be successfully applied to a much larger dataset than the
dataset used in the earlier study [13]. Although using
present day proteins, our simulation results show that
Cook's distance measure can be used to detect transfers
between distant as well as closely related bacteria (Fig. 2).
Robust support for each of the predictions can be
obtained only by detailed individual analysis. But our correct prediction of the previously known HGT events in
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and the prediction of high
frequency of HGTs in A. aeolicus further support the overall success of this method.
As mentioned in our simulation results, we chose a
<CDISS> cut-off such that the false positive rate was
restricted to only 5%. We chose this stricter and conservative cut-off to reduce false positives but this makes the
method less sensitive to detection of transfers within
closely related bacteria. In particular, we can detect only
40% of transfers within bacteria belonging to closely
related genera (16S rRNA distance < 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site). In addition, the method relies on the
availability of orthologous protein sequences from different bacteria. The method cannot be applied to sequences
where such information is either unavailable or insufficiently available. Hence acquisition of genes belonging to
a flexible gene pool, like mobile elements or prophages, is
difficult to detect using this method. Also, important
requirement for this method is that the protein family
under study should evolve at a constant rate. Protein families, which do not adhere to this criterion, cannot be ana-

The percentage of correctly detected HGT events at different transfer distances. A) This analysis is carried on simulated data as described in text. It can be seen that detection of HGT increases as the distance between acceptor and donor
species increases. The detection reaches 100% when the transfer distance is greater than 0.12. But ~40% of horizontally transferred genes can still be detected at lower transfer distances (16S rRNA < 0.1). B) Similar simulation was carried out using
Novichkov et al.'s method. It can be seen that Novichkov et al.'s method is customized to detect only transfers between very
distantly related bacteria (16S rRNA > 0.36).

lyzed by this method. Another simplification lies in the
use of 16S rRNA sequences to calculate intergenomic distances. While generally useful for delineation of a species
tree, in rare cases even the 16S rRNA distances show
anomalies. In such cases, usage of other measures of
intergenomic distances may be required.
In spite of the above limitations, the principle behind this
approach offers certain inherent advantages over other
methods. The predictions of similarity based methods, as
recently proposed by Podell and Gaasterland [8], depend
on fine tuning of many factors like filter threshold, definition of 'self' species or ranking of BLAST hits. On the other
hand, our simplification of Novichkov et al.'s original
approach depends only on a single robust parameter
<CDISS>. In contrasts to Novichkov et al.'s approach, our
method is not limited to detecting XGDs but also transfer
of novel genes. Without the need to compute and compare phylogenetic trees, this approach is computationally
less demanding and can be applied to large-scale datasets.
Unlike similarity-based methods [1,8,9], which depend
on large-scale genomic information, this approach utilizes sequences from a single orthologous protein family.
Also, it is not sensitive to unavailability of certain gene
sequences from a given set of organisms. In contrast to
composition based methods, our approach uses protein
sequences and hence our results are not influenced by
nucleotide compositional variations due to codon bias or
positive selection. It is difficult to establish the direction
of horizontal transfer using similarity based methods.
This, too, is remedied by the <CDISS> measure that identifies only those genes, which have been horizontally
acquired (Fig. 1).

We have also derived a dataset of 171 horizontally transferred genes. Detailed analyses of this selected set of genes,
which are involved in HGTs, give some interesting
insights. Surprisingly, the transfers between bacteria and
archaea mainly consist of gene transfer from bacteria to
archaea rather than the other way around. We also find
that the majority of these recent HGT events have
occurred among metabolic genes. Archaea, which
obtained genes from bacteria, mainly involve M. acetivorans and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. This observation is in
accordance with the fact that Methanosarcinaceae are metabolically as well as physiologically very versatile and exist
in extensively different environments [32]. Acquiring new
metabolic genes like those involved in proline biosynthesis possibly helps in coping better with the diverse ecological environment. The other archaeon, Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1 also seems to have obtained important enzymes
like those involved in the TCA cycle (fumarase) and Glycerol biosynthesis (glycerol dehydrogenase). It is postulated that moderate thermophiles like Halobacterium sp.
NRC-1 share their habitats with multiple bacterial species
and hence appear to possess a much greater number of
acquired bacterial genes than other archaeal species [27].
It is interesting to note that Halobacterium is one of the few
archaea, which possess TCA cycle.
Fewer genes have been transferred from archaea to bacteria than vice versa. These genes are mainly acquired by
thermophilic bacteria – A. aeolicus, T. maritima and D.
radiodurans. This is in agreement with previous suggestion
that these thermophilic bacteria probably acquired genes
from archaea, which are also hyperthermophiles [1,27].
Interestingly though, the number of genes acquired by

these thermophiles from other bacteria is much more
than those obtained from archaea.
Another interesting observation is the higher frequency of
transfer between bacterial genomes of translational genes
as compared to metabolic genes. Although, a number of

HGT events in the translational proteins have been
reported earlier [33-35], higher propensity of these genes
in HGT compared to any other functional category has
not been reported. There is a striking difference in frequencies of functional categories of genes transferred
within bacterial phyla as compared to the genes trans-

ferred between archaea and bacteria. Such differences in
the functional categories between interphyletic and intraphyletic transfers are only reported in cyanobacterial
genome analysis [36]. This difference in transfer frequencies can be explained based on the 'Complexity Hypothesis' proposed by Jain et al. [29]. Most of the translational
category proteins are part of a multi-protein machinery.
Replacement of a single protein in this machinery by a distant ortholog is probably hazardous. This may explain our
observation of the low frequency of horizontally transferred translational proteins between archaea and bacteria
as compared to the interbacterial transfers.

sequences corresponding to 4569 COGs were downloaded from NCBI ftp-site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/
COG/COG. We performed the analyses on microbial protein sequences from 63 bacterial and archaeal genomes
[see Additional file 5]. For this study, we have used 16S
rRNA distances to represent intergenomic distances. The
16S rRNA sequences were obtained from the NCBI website. Availability and analysis of large number of prokaryotic genomes have shown that evolutionary relation
between prokaryotes is well represented by 16S rRNA
sequences [19]. The tree based on prokaryotic 16S rRNA
sequences used in this analysis is very similar to recently
published tree [37].

Conclusion
In this article, expanding on a previously proposed
method by Novichkov et al., we proposed a simplified
approach to detection of horizontal gene transfer. The
simplification helped us in applying the method to a
much larger dataset. Using simulations as well as already
known examples of horizontal gene transfer we also
showed that the method performed well. Our simulation
indicated that the method could detect transfers much
more efficiently than previous method. This increase in
efficiency is due to the different design of the two methods. Novichkov et al.'s method is designed to detect only
XGDs while our method can detect XGDs as well novel
gene acquisitions. Our method is more efficient in detecting HGT between distantly related bacteria than between
closely related bacteria. Although not devoid of limitations, our method has added advantages over other methods proposed previously.
We further filtered our predictions using stringent
sequence similarities as well as likelihood tests. This led to
a dataset of 171 genes, which with high confidence had
undergone horizontal gene transfer. We hope that these
171 genes will be useful in future analysis. Our analysis of
171 genes provided interesting insights into nature of horizontal transfers. The majority of transfers between
archaea and bacteria have occurred in the direction from
bacteria to archaea rather than the other way round.
There is a disagreement over functional properties of horizontally transferred genes. Hence we carried out analysis
of functional properties of these genes. Genes transferred
between the archaea and bacteria are mostly metabolic
genes. On the other hand, genes transferred between bacterial phyla are mainly involved in translation. Our finding indicated that functional property of a transferred
gene probably depends on phylogenetic distance between
the acceptor and donor bacteria.

Multiple alignments and distance calculation
Multiple alignments of protein sequences in each COG
were produced using CLUSTALW 1.83 [38]. Default input
parameters were used for these alignments. The distances
between rRNA and protein sequences were calculated
using DNAdist and protdist program, provided by
PHYLIP package [39], respectively. DNAdist was run using
F84 model and protdist was run using Dayhoff's PAM
matrix model. For each COG with N proteins, all
(N+1)*N/2 pairwise distances between protein and
between 16S rRNA were measured. A linear regression
analysis between these protein distances and corresponding 16S rRNA distances is carried out. Only 1965 COG
families, which show a correlation above r > 0.3 (p-val <
10-5) and which have more than 8 protein members were
used for further analysis. This step was used to make sure
that the protein-protein distances in the family are generally proportional to corresponding distances between 16S
rRNAs.
Cook's distance (CDISS)
Cook's distance is used to detect outliers in a correlation
[15,16]. In this study, the CDISS measure was used to
detect a protein-protein distance (Yj) not in agreement
with the corresponding rRNA-rRNA distance (Xj). A linear
regression relation between Xj and Yj is given by:

ˆ
Y j = a + bX j

ˆ
where Yj is the predicted value for Yj based on linear
regression equation 1.
For the ith distance pair (Xi, Yi), the CDISSi value is calculated as follows:

2
∑ (Y j − Y j (i))
j ≠i
CDISSi =
p× MSE

Here, the mean <CDISS> value over all the distances
involving a given protein was used as a measure of its
deviation from the expected phylogenetic relation. A cutoff of 2/D (D = number of protein-protein distances,
(N+1)*N/2, in given COG family) was used for prediction
of horizontally transferred genes. In our simulation (see
Results) 90% of True Positives and 5% of false positives
are observed to be above this cut-off.
Core set of horizontally transferred genes
Each candidate protein predicted to be horizontally transferred, was aligned with every other protein sequence in
the given protein family. All pairwise alignments were
done with the help of the EMBOSS package using the
Needleman-Wunsch algorithm [40]. All the HGT candidate proteins, which show high sequence identity (at least
40%) with a distant protein, were selected. Based on this
criterion we could select 257 such proteins. Archaeal proteins with best match with a bacterial protein were considered as acquired from bacteria. Similarly, bacterial
proteins with best match from archaea were considered as
acquired from archaeal domain. All the transfers between
bacteria, with 16S rRNA distance > 0.3 and belonging to
different phyla, are noted as transfers within bacterial
domain. Only 171 genes, which passed the likelihood
tests described below, were short-listed.
Likelihood calculation and tree comparisons
For likelihood calculations, we divided a COG family into
the following groups-Archaea, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes,
γ-proteobacteria, α-proteobacteria, β-proteobacteria,
Chlamydiae-Spirochaetes and rest of the bacteria (Aquificae, Thermotogae, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus,
Fusobacteria). From a given COG, a set of sequences,
comprising subgroup of bacteria to which transferred
gene belongs and subgroup of bacteria to which donor
gene belongs, was selected. For each such set, we built a
protein tree and a 16S rRNA tree using the Tree-Puzzle
package [41]. Protein trees were built using VT model and
16S rRNA tree were built using HKY model. We compared
the likelihood of protein sequences to have evolved
according to protein tree and 16S rRNA tree using Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [42], one-sided Kishino-Hasegawa
test [43] and expected likelihood weight test [44]. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/9

likelihood calculations and statistical tests were also carried out using the Tree-Puzzle package. For a given group
of bacteria, we checked whether the 16S rRNA tree could
be rejected at a 5% significance level. In case of a HGT, the
likelihood of the protein family to follow the 16S rRNA
tree is significantly lower than to follow the protein tree.
For sake of clarity and ease of interpretation, the calculations were carried out on smaller groups rather than entire
COG family. Some families had more than one incident
of HGT. In such cases, results could be much easily understood if the COG family was divided into individual
groups of bacteria. All the likelihood based tree comparisons are provided [see Additional file 6].
In certain cases, where the number of bacteria in a given
group was less than 4, we could not carry out above calculation.
Among the 257 sequences, for 171 sequences the 16S
rRNA tree could be rejected at 5% significance level. These
171 sequences are used for further analysis.
These 171 sequences thus passed three criteria of HGT,
namely Cook's distance, similarity criteria and likelihoodbased tests.
The functional categories of these short-listed proteins
were obtained from the COG database.
