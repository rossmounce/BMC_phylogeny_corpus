Molecular epidemiology of hepatitis C infection
in Cyprus within the general population and
high-risk cohorts
Victoria L Demetriou and Leondios G Kostrikis*

Abstract
Background: Initial data on the molecular epidemiology of HCV infection in Cyprus showed a highly polyphyletic
infection and multiple points of introduction into the general population. The continuation and expansion of this
investigation is presented here including high risk groups.
Findings: The samples include additional subjects from the general population, a group of inmates and HIV/HCV
coinfected individuals, whose strains were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced in partial Core-E1 and NS5B regions.
The results confirm the broad genotype distribution and polyphyletic infection on the island, and no new subtypes
were found. Monophyletic clusters between strains of the prisoners and the injecting drug users imply sharing of
infected equipment, and highlight the risk of widespread transmission in these cohorts, although no spill-over to
the general population was observed.
Conclusions: The results of this study underline the impact of population movements and high-risk population
groups on the changing molecular epidemiology of HCV, with strains moving to Europe from Asia, Africa and
Eastern Europe by means of immigration and modern transmission routes.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of
chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and death, giving rise to a
major global public health issue [1]. It is a highly genetically diverse RNA virus within the family Flaviviridae, and
is separated into 6 confirmed genotypes and multiple subtypes that exhibit 30-35% and 20-25% nucleotide variation,
respectively, at the level of complete genomes [2]. Determination of genotype is important due to clinical implications, but knowledge of the sequence diversity is also
significant for studies on molecular epidemiology and
evolution, and for classification and nomenclature [2,3].
Genotypes 1-3 display a worldwide distribution, while genotypes 4-6 are more geographically restricted and represent long-term endemic infection [4]. Subtypes 1b and
genotype 2 are associated mainly with blood transfusions,
especially in older patients, and subtypes 1a and 3a predominate among injecting drug users [5,6]. Genotype 4 is
found mainly in North Africa and Mediterranean

countries, Egypt in particular, but has recently been
spreading to Europe and North America largely via intravenous drug users and immigrants [7], genotype 5 is
restricted primarily to South Africa [8], and genotype 6 is
found in Southeast Asia [9]. Globalisation is continually
changing the face of worldwide HCV epidemiology as a
result of modern transmission and human migration [10].
In the eastern Mediterranean region where Cyprus lies,
HCV genotypes are not distributed uniformly [11-13].
Cyprus is a small island, but sits at a crossroad connecting
Europe, Africa, and Asia, giving rise to a high rate of influx
of tourists and political and economical immigrants from
Eastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union,
Africa and Southeast Asia. Also, as it is now a member
state of the European Union, entry into Cyprus is easy,
facilitating the introduction of new infectious diseases.
The HCV genotype distribution and molecular epidemiology among the general population and intravenous drug
users in Cyprus has been reported, revealing a polyphyletic
infection with high genetic heterogeneity, small monophyletic clusters among the intravenous drug users, and the
discovery of unclassified isolates [14,15]. The study is

extended here by investigating additional samples from
Cyprus, and specifically from high-risk cohorts, including
incarcerated individuals and patients coinfected with
HIV-1.
Study subjects

Since the last study of the molecular epidemiology of HCV
infection among the general population of Cyprus [14],
sampling continued from 2008 to 2009 and blood samples
were obtained from five (2 male) chronically infected HCV
patients between the ages of 27 and 34, attending private
clinics and public hospitals in Cyprus. All patients had
been tested positive for HCV antibodies by a second-generation immunoassay (INNO-LiPA), and for HCV RNA
by diagnostic RT-PCR (COBAS Amplicor, Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ, USA). The epidemiological features
of the study subjects varied, as one patient was Cypriot
and the rest were from Greece, Bulgaria and Belarus. Two
of the participants stated that they had practised intravenous drug use, and for three the route of transmission is
unknown.
Having previously obtained results from injecting drug
users [15], and the fact that serving a prison sentence has
been shown to be a significant risk factor for HCV infection, a cohort from the incarcerated population were
included in this study as a high-risk cohort. A total of 25
samples from individuals serving a prison sentence had
been taken for standard diagnostic purposes between June
2009 and January 2010 and any samples tested PCR-positive for HCV were retrospectively added to this study after
written consent from the study subjects (16 individuals).
Epidemiological and risk-behaviour details were collected
from seven individuals. The participants were predominantly male (6, 85%), aged between 22-41 years, four
(57%) were Cypriot, and three (43%) were of other nationalities (Greek, Georgian and Portuguese). All individuals
who had been previously tested for coinfection with HBV
and HIV (6, 85%) stated that they were tested negative for
either infection. Three subjects had served multiple prison
sentences. All interviewed persons stated that they had
practiced intravenous drug use, six of which in Cyprus,
and three had also practiced injecting drug use abroad.
The median stated duration of injecting drug use was 5
years (interquartile range, 2-6 years). Regarding other possible routes of transmission and high-risk behaviour, none
of the study subjects had ever had a blood transfusion, six
(85%) had tattoos, all had practised unsafe heterosexual
contact, and one participant believed that he had been
infected with HCV during a fight within the correctional
facilities.
Finally, a third group included in this study were HIV/
HCV coinfected subjects, who are generally considered
to arise from two types of risk groups: injecting drug
users and men who have sex with men (MSM) [16-20].

From the 251 samples collected from HIV-1 seropositive
patients from 2005-2009 for the study of the molecular
epidemiology of HIV-1 in Cyprus [21], 14 were known to
have HCV coinfection, according to results of routine
diagnostic tests. All coinfected samples were subsequently included in this study, six of which (43%) were
on antiretroviral therapy at the time of sampling. This
cohort consisted of 10 male subjects (71%), with a median age of 34 years (interquartile range 32-45). The subjects displayed a variety of nationalities, with five (36%)
being from Cyprus, four (29%) from Georgia, and one
patient (7%) each from Bulgaria, Latvia, Italy, Britain and
the USA. The stated routes of HIV-1 transmission for
these patients was heterosexual contact for nine (64%),
homosexual contact for two (MSM) (14%), intravenous
drug use practises for two (14%), and one (7%) was a haemophiliac. No further specific details, however, were
available regarding HCV transmission. All patients
appeared epidemiologically unlinked, apart from one
male and one female subject from Georgia, who were
partners at the time of sampling [21]. Bioethics approval
for the collection of, and experimentation on these samples was obtained from the Cyprus National Bioethics
Committee (ΕΕΒΚ/ΕΠ/2005/03 and ΕΕΒΚ/ΕΠ/2009/02).
Sampling and processing

All participants gave their informed consent, and clinical
and epidemiological data were collected by use of anonymous coded questionnaires. Blood was collected from
each participant by qualified personnel and plasma was
isolated as previously described [14,22]. Viral RNA was
extracted from 200 μl plasma using the QIAmp® UltraSens® Virus kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples included in
this study were investigated with a RT nested PCR in partial Core-E1 and NS5B regions of the HCV genome
and all positive samples were sequenced as described
previously [14].
Molecular epidemiology within the general population
and high-risk groups

Phylogenetic analyses were performed on the Core-E1 and
NS5B sequences derived from the general population, the
incarcerated group and the HIV/HCV coinfected cohort,
following multiple sequence alignments in MEGA v4 [23]
with previously investigated HCV sequences from the general population and intravenous drug users in Cyprus
[14,15] and reference strains of known subtypes derived
from the Los Alamos HCV database [24] to investigate
genotype distribution and sequence variability. Each set of
aligned sequences was analysed with the model testing
tool in MEGA v5 [25] and the best available evolutionary
distance estimation model was chosen to construct Maximum Likelihood trees using Geneious v5.4 [26]. For the

Demetriou and Kostrikis BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:468
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/468

Core-E1 dataset the HKY approach was used with a
gamma parameter of 0.45 and for the NS5B dataset the
Kimura-2-parameter approach was used with a gamma
parameter of 0.77 and a proportion of invariable sites (I)
of 0.29. Bootstrap analysis was carried out with 500 replicates and values above 70 were considered sufficient for
subtype assignment. Clusters were determined by an arbitrary threshold of genetic distance < 5%. The phylogenetic
trees constructed from the sequences of the Core-E1 and
NS5B regions are seen in Figures 1 and 2, respectively,
where the samples from the various cohorts are represented with different symbols. HCV genotype 1 was the
most frequent (47.7% in the Core-E1 region), followed by
genotypes 3, 4, 2, and 5 (12.1%, 8.4%, 2.8%, and 0.9%,
respectively in the Core-E1 region).
From the five new samples of the general population,
four were PCR positive and they were classified as 3a (two
strains, one from an injecting drug user), 1b (one strain)
and unclassified genotype 4 (one strain). The latter was
from a Bulgarian female and appears to belong to the
unclassified group of genotype 4 isolated previously identified [14,27] and is the only strain from this group that
clusters closely to another sample from Cyprus, but was
only PCR positive in one of the two genomic regions.
Hence, the genotypes found in this group are ones known
to be present on the island [14,15].
From 25 samples taken for diagnostic testing from individuals serving a prison sentence at the state prisons, 13
were PCR-positive in the Core-E1 region and 16 in the
NS5B region. The HCV genotypes found in this cohort
were 3a (56%), 1b (31%) and 1a (13%) which have been
associated with intravenous drug use [6,28,29], and showing a majority agreement with the genotype distribution
in the Cypriot intravenous drug user population [15].
Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained from the
group of prisoners confirmed the polyphyletic nature of
the local epidemic, but certain small monophyletic clusters also appeared among the injecting drug users and
the inmates, suggesting a history of equipment sharing
within small groups of users on the island, and that these
inmates have had directly or indirect contact with the
intravenous drug users discussed previously [15]. Within
subtype 3a, sample HCVP05, from a 23 year old Cypriot
male, clusters within an existing cluster of strains from
Cypriot intravenous drug users (two male, one female) in
both trees. The subjects of this cluster are also of similar
age (19-24 years). Within the same subtype, two separate
clusters are seen between strains of the prisoners’ cohort.
One is formed by samples HCVP04, HCVP07 and
HCVP09, derived from one female and two male subjects, aged 21-35 years, two Cypriot and one of unknown
nationality. This cluster is only observed in the NS5B
tree, as two of the samples were PCR-negative in the
Core-E1 region. The other small cluster is formed in

Page 3 of 8

both trees by samples HCVP15 and HCVP16, from two
male subjects ages 39 and 49, one Cypriot and one of
unknown nationality. Within subtype 1b, sample
HCVP17, from a 42 year old Cypriot male, groups closely
with an existing cluster of strains from Cypriot and
Greek male injecting drug users in the trees of both
genomic regions. It is interesting that the Cypriot subjects who cluster together here are in a similar age group
(39-47 years) that indicates the probability of a long duration of drug use. In the same subtype, another small cluster is observed, involving sample HCVP12, from a 24
year old Georgian male, and a strain of the general population, CYHCV93, from a 39 year old Georgian male who
was infected through intravenous drug use and, interestingly is a 2 k/1b recombinant strain, known to circulate
in certain injecting drug user circles in Eastern Europe
[30]. However, sample HCVP12 was PCR negative in the
Core-E1 region, and so it cannot be seen if it was 2 k in
this region and whether it would cluster with the same
sample from the general population. This phylogenetic
relationship in the NS5B region and the similar demographic and epidemiological characteristics (Georgian
nationality, male, 25 years old, history of intravenous
drug use), could mean that the strain in question is also a
recombinant of this type, but this would have to be confirmed with additional sequence data. The small clusters
are formed between strains from individuals with common
characteristics (nationality, age group, injecting drug use),
demonstrating that such users are more likely to associate
with each other, increasing the danger of sharing injecting
drug use equipment. These results underline the significance of rapid and uncontrolled transmission between
injecting drug users and inmates. Even though intravenous
drug use is generally considered to be the main risk factor
for prisoners, the routes of transmission could be multiple,
due to the range of risk behaviours in prisons, including
unsanitary tattoo and piercing procedures and getting into
fights [31-33], which were all stated behaviours from the
study subjects of this cohort. No strains from the general
population were included in these clusters, illustrating that
the HCV epidemic in the high-risk groups runs in parallel
to the HCV-infected general population.
From the samples from individuals coinfected with HIV
and HCV, eight were PCR positive for both regions, and
sequences could be obtained from seven samples. The
results showed the existence of HCV genotypes 1a (3 samples), 1b (2 samples) and 3a (2 samples), which are all genotypes previously found among coinfected subjects, but in
different geographical locations [17,19,34-37]. Two strains
cluster closely together (genetic distance < 1%) in subtype
1b in both trees, and they are derived from two individuals
who were a heterosexual couple at the time of sampling,
strongly implying transmission from one individual to the
other, but it cannot be certain whether infection was

through sexual practises or household transmission. Their
HIV-1 strains also display a similar clustering both in the
full genome analysis [21] and in investigations of the gag,
pol (Pr/RT) and env regions separately [22]. No other
strains from this cohort form clusters and none show significantly close phylogenetic relationships with samples
from neither the general population nor the other highrisk cohorts. It is likely that the routes of transmission for
the two viruses were the same in many cases. Of all the
stated risk behaviours in this group, the most improbable
transmission route for HCV is the heterosexual contact,
where it may have been acquired through another
unknown route. Regarding the country of origin, the
Cypriot study subjects in this cohort carried HCV genotypes 3a and 1a, Georgians carried 3a and 1b, and both
the Latvian and Bulgarian subjects were infected with
HCV subtype 1a. Concerning risk behaviours, the MSM
carried HCV genotypes 3a and 1a. The subjects who were
infected with HIV through heterosexual contacts were
infected with all three HCV subtypes found in this cohort,
possibly signifying the fact that they may have transmitted
HCV through different routes, or simply representing the
fact that they were more individuals in this subgroup than
for other HIV transmission routes in this cohort. The
intravenous drug user whose HCV strain was sequenced
was infected with 1a, a strain typically found in injecting
drug users.
All the high-risk groups (intravenous drug users, incarcerated population and HIV/HCV coinfected individuals)
display a similar genotype distribution, due to common
risk behaviours. HIV/HCV coinfection has been associated
mainly with injecting drug use and MSM behaviour, and
even among coinfected MSM, injecting drug use is significantly associated, as well as multiple other risk behaviours
[17-19,34-39]. The small number of HCV-positive samples
found in the HIV-infected cohort from 2005-2009 could
imply a low prevalence of HCV infection among MSM on
the island at the moment. However, as this risk group is
getting increasing attention with regards to HCV transmission in Europe, this prevalence could also change in
Cyprus in the near future. Even though an increasing incidence of genotype 4 has been reported in Europe, in intravenous drug users and MSM coinfected with HIV
[13,19,36,39-42], no such cases were found in the highrisk groups, even though they were present in the general
population. More studies need to be carried out to establish a more representative global picture of the epidemiology of HCV in individuals coinfected with HIV.
The overall data obtained here show a polyphyletic
infection, certain monophyletic clusters among injecting
drug users and prisoners of similar age and nationality,
and no spill-over to the general population. The general
picture of the molecular epidemiology of HCV infection
obtained from an epidemiologically diverse set of samples

Page 6 of 8

from various cohorts confirms a high genetic heterogeneity, broad genotype distribution, and multiple points of
introduction, similar to the pattern seen for HIV in Cyprus
[22]. These data are representative of the geographical
position of Cyprus, which lies at a crossroad between
three continents resulting in population movements that
appear to greatly influence the epidemiology of HCV on
the island. Also, the diverse background of the study subjects emphasise the impact of immigration from various
countries and increasing occurrence of injecting drug
abuse on the island’s HCV epidemic, highlighting the risk
of widespread transmission in this high-risk cohort. The
results here support that the point of entry of HCV on the
island or in any of the cohorts investigated was not due to
a single-transmission introduction.
In conclusion, the results of this study reveal the molecular epidemiology of the HCV infection in Cyprus in
more detail and demonstrate the changing HCV epidemiology, with genetically diverse strains finding their way
into Europe from the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe, by means of injecting drug abuse and immigration.
Also, the broad genotype distribution and multiple points
of infection have implications on clinical management,
and highlight the urgent need for risk reduction and prevention strategies.
