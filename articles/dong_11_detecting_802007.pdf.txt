Detecting transmission and reassortment
events for influenza A viruses with genotype
profile method
Changzheng Dong*†, Liya Ying† and Dongfang Yuan

Abstract
Evolutionary events of transmission and reassortment for influenza A viruses were traditionally detected by
phylogenetic analysis for influenza viruses’ eight gene segments. Because the phylogenetic analysis can be
complex, we developed genotype profile method which packaged the phylogenetic algorithms to analyze
combination patterns of gene segments and integrated epidemiology knowledge. With the method, the analysis
of reassortment and transmission becomes a simple and reliable process that combines genotypes, which is
identical for the biological process of the virus. An application called IVEE that implements the method is available
for all academic users to apply the method http://snptransformer.sourceforge.net. Furthermore, we found that a
previous summary of the reassortment events in swine influenza A viruses may be inaccurate.
Keywords: influenza A virus, genotype, genotype profile method, reassortment, transmission, phylogenetic analysis,

Background
Influenza A viruses annually cause seasonal epidemics
and occasional global pandemics in humans. Three pandemics occurred in the 20th century, in 1918, 1957 and
1968, which were the result of the transmission of avian
viruses or a reassortment between human and avian
viruses that greatly changed virus antigenicity [1,2]. At
the end of 2008 or the beginning of 2009, a novel swine
reassortant was transmitted to humans [3], and a global
pandemic broke out in Mexico and USA in April 2009
[4]. Researchers confirmed that the reassorted virus consisted of six gene segments that emerged from triplereassortant viruses circulating in North American swine
and two gene segments from Eurasian avian-like swine
H1N1 viruses [3,4]. Because the common ancestor of
the new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV)
and its most closely related swine viruses existed
approximately 10 years ago, the reassortant viruses may
have been circulating in pigs for several years before
their transmission to humans [3]. Due to the lack of

swine surveillance, the details regarding the reassortment event are unclear.
Phylogenetic analysis has been an essential method for
research into the molecular evolution of influenza A
viruses, especially for cross-host transmission and reassortment). Holmes et al. sequenced 156 complete genomes of human H3N2 influenza A viruses collected
between 1999 and 2004 from New York, USA, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that multiple reassortment
events had occurred among the co-circulating clades [5].
Nelson et al. showed that segmental reassortment has
played an important role in the genomic evolution of
H1N1 since 1918 and that intra-subtype reassortment
appeared to be an important process in the evolution
and epidemiology of H1N1 influenza A virus [6]. Nelson
et al. found that multiple clades of both H1N1 and
H3N2 entered and co-circulated in the United States
during the 2006-2007 influenza season, even in localities
that were distant from major metropolitan areas [7].
These data were concordant with other research by the
same group concluding that the stochastic processes of
viral migration and clade reassortment played a vital
role in shaping short-term evolutionary dynamics [8].

in Hong Kong containing genes from both 2009 S-OIV
and triple-reassortant virus which implied that swine
might be a reservoir of reassortment for 2009 S-OIV
[9]. Li et al. revealed avian reassortment patterns of
highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus in
eastern Asia [10] and the HAPI H5N1 virus had crosshost transmitted to human and caused fatal respiratory
illness [11].
Traditionally, transmission and reassortment events
have been mostly revealed by separate phylogenetic analysis for the eight gene segments [5-11]. This analysis
method is not so straightforward, and the key process
lies in identifying the lineages to which each gene segment belongs, a process that requires professional
knowledge about numerous virus lineages. Rabadan et
al. proposed an interesting method for revealing potential reassortment that calculates the paired nucleotide
differences of the third codon positions between the
same segments of any two virus strains [12,13]. If the
two viruses have a common origin, the differences
between all eight segment pairs should be proportional.
In contrast, a violation of this rule probably indicates
potential reassortment events. The method sounds reasonable; however, several factors may interfere with the
calculation of the differences, such as time since divergence, number of generations and geographical isolation.
Most importantly, it is difficult to parse the exact parents for potential reassortment. Lu et al. introduced the
concept of genotype to define gene segment combinations [14] and developed an online tool called FluGenome [15] to determine genotypes for influenza A viruses
and to detect virus reassortment in theory. Lineages for
each segment are assigned by a cutoff of 10% nucleotide
difference by p-distance in the phylogenetic tree of all
nearly complete sequences of influenza A viruses (see
Figure 1). The genotypes can be determined by comparing the genomic sequences of new viruses with the genome database using the BLAST algorithm. The best
BLAST results are used to assign lineages to the viruses
and create genotypes by the sequential combination of
the lineages for each segment in the gene order. Thus,
the nomenclature of influenza A viruses consists of all
eight gene segments, rather than the serotype of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase alone. Reassortment can be
detected, in theory, by combining the known genotypes
in the database. Unfortunately, FluGenome only provided the process for determining the genotypes, and
the analysis process for the reassortment was not implemented directly. Furthermore, the hundreds of genotypes that are collected in the database complicate the
analysis even in theory.
In this study, we introduce the concept of “genotype
profile” based on “genotype” to describe classic or dominant virus strains. With genotype profiles, the genotypes

Page 2 of 13

for the viruses were divided into several basic genotypes
and various rare genotypes that may be transmitting
viruses or reassortants. Employing genotype profile
method, analyzing reassortment and transmission events
is a simple and reliable process that combines basic genotypes, similar to the biological process of the virus,
while complex phylogenetic analysis is packaged under
the method. An application called IVEE that implements
the method is available for all academic users to apply
the method.

Methods
Genotypes

“Genotype” was previously defined by Lu et al. as a
sequential combination of the lineages for each of the
eight segments in an influenza virus genome [14]. A letter was assigned to each lineage of PB2, PB1, PA, NP
and M, and a number followed by a letter was assigned
to each lineage of HA, NA and NS, with the number
representing the serological subtype or allele. For example, [A, D, B, 3A, A, 2A, B, 1A] is the genotype of
human seasonal influenza virus subtype H3N2 with PB2
(1st position) of lineage A, PB1 (2nd position) of lineage
D, PA (3rd position) of lineage B, HA (4th position) subtype 3 of lineage A, NP (5th position) of lineage A, NA
(6th position) subtype 2 of lineage A, MP (7th position)
of lineage B and NS (8th position) subtype 1 of lineage
A, which follows the numbering system of influenza
genome segments.
We downloaded the genotype information for all influenza A viruses of humans, swine and avian species in the
database on 10th Sep, 2010 from FluGenome [15]. In total,
there were 3161, 324 and 2572 genomes for human, swine
and avian viruses, respectively, and the number of types of
corresponding genotypes was 26, 40 and 397, respectively.
Two virus strains (A/Texas/09/2009 and A/Canada-ON/
RV1527/2009) were used to determine the genotypes of
2009 S-OIV because 2009 S-OIVs and their genotypes
were not included in the FluGenome database till now.
We downloaded their complete genomic sequences from
the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource [16] and determined
their genotypes via FluGenome. Most of the lineages of
gene segments could be confirmed directly; however, the
lineage of NA was assigned using looser parameters (80%
coverage and 80% identity).
Genotype profiles

We defined genotype profiles as lists of all genotypes of
classic or predominant virus strains for humans, swine
or avian species to filter hundreds of not so important
genotypes and import epidemiological knowledge for
viruses (see Table 1). With such a definition, the genotypes for the viruses could be divided into common genotypes and rare genotypes. Common genotypes meant

that these genotypes occur frequently and mainly refer
to classic or predominant virus strains, whereas rare
genotypes have low frequencies. However, in some
cases, such as human infecting, highly pathogenic avian
H5N1 viruses, they should not be considered genotypes
in the human genotype profile (we name them basic
genotypes) because they have not yet adapted to human
hosts, despite the fact that these genotypes were
observed in human hosts with high frequencies. Similarly, some reassortants that have not adapted to their
hosts may be isolated with high frequency due to frequent sampling. Thus, the difference between common
genotypes and basic genotypes depends on whether the
hosts are natural hosts or new hosts after adaptation
and are judged based on epidemiological knowledge of
influenza A viruses. We further assumed that most of
the viruses that have rare genotypes are transmitting
viruses or reassortants that emerged from combinations
of basic genotypes, and would test the hypothesis later.
Occasionally some rare genotypes such as [A, A, A, 1A,

A, 1A, B, 1A] for A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 had low frequencies due only to the lack of sampling. These genotypes were all excluded from the genotype profiles to
decrease the complexity of the genotype profiles. Genotype profiles for human, swine and avian species were
established by the following steps: (i) divide genotypes
for the viruses into common genotypes and rare genotypes with a cutoff of 5 for genotype frequencies; (ii)
common genotypes were further checked based on
knowledge of the evolutionary history of influenza A
virus to distinguish basic and non-basic genotypes; (iii)
basic genotypes in genotype profiles were further classified into groups and subtypes; (iv) rare genotypes and
non-basic genotypes were analyzed following the process
for detecting transmission and reassortment events
described below.

to detect transmission and reassortment events (see
Figure 1). The detecting process includes two steps.
First, ascertain whether the genotypes exist in the genotype profiles. If the genotypes of candidate viruses exist
in the genotype profiles, the genotypes are basic genotypes as long as the sampling hosts are the same as the
hosts of the basic genotype or transmission genotypes
when they are different. Thus, the virus is a transmission virus if it has switched hosts from the natural host
to the host from which it was sampled. For example, the
frequent observation of avian genotypes [K, G, D, 5J, F,
1J, F, 1E] and [G, G, E, 5J, F, 1G, F, 1E] in humans

provided evidence that humans were infected with avian
H5N1 viruses (see Table 2). Otherwise, the genotypes
are considered potential reassortants only if they do not
exist in the genotype profiles. Next, observe the characteristics of the lineages of the genotypes and infer the
possible reassortment parents by combining the basic
genotypes of the genotype profiles. In most cases, the
reassortment parents and how they were combined can
be easily concluded, except for some novel genotypes
that have emerged from unknown origins. We can then
test the hypothesis that most of the viruses that have
rare genotypes are transmitting viruses or reassortants.

Comparing swine reassortment patterns with previous
work

Rabadan et al. proposed a distance-based statistical
method to analyze the reassortment phenomena and
applied the method to human and swine influenza A
viruses [13]. We collected the strain names of swine
viruses from their paper and retrieved their genotypes
from FluGenome. A/swine/Miyazaki/1/2006 was not
included in the genotype database of FluGenome, and its
genotype was determined manually by collecting its relevant genomic sequences from NCBI. A/swine/North Carolina/35922/98’s genotype was not determined because of
the lack of its entire genome sequence. The genotypes
were further used to detect the potential reassortment
events by our genotype profile method as described above.

for human influenza A viruses: [A, A, A/B, 1B, A, 1A, B,
1A] and [C, D, E, 1A, A, 1F, F, 1A] for subtype H1N1
as well as [A, E, B, 2A, A, 2A, B, 1A] for H2N2 and [A,
D, B, 3A, A, 2A, B, 1A] for H3N2. This means that the
genotypes of most dominant circulating H3N2 viruses
belong to [A, D, B, 3A, A, 2A, B, 1A], with PB2 lineage
A, PB1 lineage D, PA lineage B, HA subtype 3 lineage
A, NP lineage A, NA subtype 2 lineage A, MP lineage B
and NS subtype 1 lineage A. The genotype nomenclature system consists of all eight gene segments, rather
than serotypes of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase
alone. Thus, the status of the whole virus genome is
clearly reflected by the combination of the lineages of
eight gene segments.
With the help of the genotypes, we could reconstruct
the evolutionary history of the human influenza A virus.
In 1918, a global pandemic was caused by the influenza
A virus subtype H1N1. Taubenberger et al. isolated and
sequenced a virus strain named A/Brevig Mission/1/
1918, which had the genotype [A, A, A, 1A, A, 1A, B,

Dong et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:395
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/395

1A] (see Table 2). They proposed that the virus was originally transmitted from avian host and adapted to
human before the 1918 pandemic [1,2,17,18] while some
researchers argued that the evidence for the avian-origin
hypothesis was not enough and it might be the result of
a reassortment or a recombination between human and
swine viruses [19-22]. It’s hard to solve the debate
exactly due to the lack of sampling viruses dominating
in that era and the factors such as constraining selection
and reassortment/recombination complicates phylogenetic analysis [19-24]. Regardless of its origin debate,
the H1N1 virus varied quickly and caused the subsequent seasonal epidemics [1,2]. During the 1930s and
1940s (the sampling time of strains in FluGenome was
1933-1947), the genotype [A, A, A, 1B, A, 1A, B, 1A],
which had a different HA lineage, dominated. In the
next decade (the sampling time of strains in FluGenome
was 1948-1957), nearly all circulating strains were [A, A,
B, 1B, A, 1A, B, 1A], a strain that reappeared in 1977
and remained up to date. In 1957, three avian gene segments (PB1, HA and NA) replaced the corresponding
human-adapted segments of influenza A (H1N1) [1,2],
and a novel subtype H2N2 with genotype [A, E, B, 2A,
A, 2A, B, 1A] was produced. In 1968, similar events
occurred and led to the new H3N2 reassortant with
genotype [A, D, B, 3A, A, 2A, B, 1A], where PB1 and
HA were derived from avian strains [1,2].
Swine

Swine influenza A viruses can be classified into classic
swine, Eurasian avian-like swine and triple-reassortant
swine viruses. Classic swine influenza viruses have the
genotype [B, A, C, 1A, A, 1B, A, 1A] and only exist in
the subtype H1N1. Because of divergence over long periods of time, the differences between the genotypes of
human and classic swine influenza viruses (i.e., subtype
H1N1) are large, and only the lineages for PB1, NP and
NS are concordant. Around 1980, avian-like swine influenza A viruses appeared in Europe [25] and then
appeared in Asia [26], replacing almost all of the previously predominant classic swine viruses [27,28]. The
avian-like viruses have the genotype pattern [F, G, I, 4,
F, 6, F, 1E], which is entirely different from the patterns
for classic swine or human viruses. Furthermore, some
gene segments, such as PB1 (lineage G), NP (lineage F),
MP (lineage F) and NS (lineage 1E), are similar to segments that are conserved in avian viruses. It is also
notable that the swine viruses that are subtype H3N2
have the same genotype, [A, D, B, 3A, A, 2A, B, 1A], as
the human viruses. In fact, the swine genotype was
transmitted from humans, and the genome sequences of
the human and swine H3N2 subtypes were highly
homologous to date [29,30]. In 1998, the swine H3N2
virus reassorted with avian viruses and classic swine
viruses to produce the novel triple reassortant with the

Page 7 of 13

genotype [C, D, E, 3A, A, 2A, A, 1A] [31,32]. The triple
reassortants contain PB1 (lineage D), HA (lineage 3A),
NP (lineage A), NA (lineage 2A) and NS (lineage 1A)
from human H3N2 viruses; PB2 (lineage C) and PA
(lineage E) from avian viruses and MP (lineage A) from
classic swine viruses. The reassortants spread to subtypes H1N1 and H1N2 via reassortment with classic
swine H1N1 viruses and, occasionally, with human
H1N1 viruses [33,34]. In April 2009, the first global pandemic in the 21st century broke out in Mexico and the
USA, eventually forcing the WHO to increase the pandemic level to the final alert phase (phase 6). The pandemic was caused by a new reassortant originating from
swine with the genotype [C, D, E, 1A, A, 1F, F, 1A].
Most of the gene segments of the 2009 S-OIV emerged
from the triple-reassortant viruses (i.e., subtype H1N1),
whereas NA (lineage 1F) and MP (lineage F) were
derived from a Eurasian avian-like swine virus (i.e., subtype H1N1). This is an entirely new genotype that has
not been previously observed, although a very similar
genotype, [C, D, E, 1C, A, 1F, F, 1A], was found in a
swine virus isolated in China in Jan, 2010 (see Table 2)
[35]. The latter was also reassorted from triple-reassortant swine viruses isolated in China in 2006 and Eurasian
avian-like swine viruses in China, where the avian-like
swine viruses provided HA (lineage 1C), NA (lineage 1F)
and MP (lineage F). This further confirmed the inference
that 2009 S-OIV was first produced about ten years ago.
Avian

Because avian species, including waterfowl and domestic
poultry, are natural reservoirs for influenza viruses,
genetic diversity is abundant and various genotypes are
present in avian hosts, especially in waterfowl. Nevertheless, distinct patterns in the genotypes of avian species
were clearly observed: [C, F, E/H, 4, H, 6, E, 1D/2B] for
waterfowl and [K/G, G, D/E, 4, F, 6, F, 1E/1F/2A] for
domestic poultry (see Table 1 and Additional file 1,
Table S1). Additional file 1, Table S1 shows genotypes
and typical hosts for multiple subtypes of waterfowl and
domestic poultry. For example, waterfowl such as mallard ducks and green-winged teals mainly have the
waterfowl genotype pattern regardless of their serotypes.
Interestingly, the domestic poultry genotype was present
in the viruses of subtype H5N1 isolated from mallards.
This may have been the result of bi-directional virus
exchange [10,36]. Similarly, most genotypes of chicken
and duck viruses maintain the domestic poultry genotype pattern, whereas some of the viruses have waterfowl genotypes.
Conserved lineages and genotype codes

From genotype profiles, various conserved lineages of
genotypes could be observed (see Table 1). For example,
lineage A for PB2 is conserved in human H1N1 viruses,
whereas lineage B is conserved in classic swine, lineage

Dong et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:395
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/395

C is conserved in waterfowl and lineage K/G is conserved in domestic poultry. It is not surprising that lineage C for PB2 could be found in triple-reassortant swine
viruses and 2009 S-OIV because PB2 of these viruses
emerged from avian viruses. We found that lineage H
for NP and lineage E/F for MP are both conserved in
avian viruses. Thus, if the lineages for the first three
gene segments of the viruses are used, we may define
“genotype codes” for human, swine and avian viruses.
[B, A, C] is the genotype code for classic swine viruses,
whereas [F, G, I] is for Eurasian avian-like swine viruses
and [C, D, E] is for triple-reassortant swine viruses. The
genotype code [A, A/D/E, A/B] for classic human
viruses is somewhat complex due to their frequent reassortment. Actually, the dominant viruses of subtypes
H1N1 and H3N2 have simple codes: [A, A, B] ([A, A,
A] for H1N1 viruses in the 1930s and 1940s) and [A, D,
B], respectively. It is not surprising that human 2009 SOIV has the same [C, D, E] code as the triple-reassortant swine viruses. Similarly, the genotype codes for
avian viruses are [C, F, E/H] and [K/G, G, D/E]. Using
genotype codes, it becomes easy to classify candidate
viruses. If the genotype code for a virus is [C, D, E], it is
likely a triple-reassortant swine virus or human derivative like 2009 S-OIV. Similarly, it is obvious that [F, G,
I] is Eurasian avian-like swine influenza A virus.
Detecting transmission and reassortment events

Table 2 lists the potential transmission and reassortment
events of human and swine influenza A viruses that
belong to rare genotypes when genotype profiles are
constructed. For example, the virus strain A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (genotype [A, A, A, 1A, A, 1A, B, 1A]) is
the oldest influenza virus that has been sequenced and
was proposed to be transmitted from avian species [17].
There are many avian genotypes in human and swine
viruses, with serotypes varying from H5N1 to H9N2, all
of which are the result of direct transmission across
hosts. Bastien et al. isolated three strains (genotype [C,
D, E, 1B, A, 1A, A, 1A]) in Canada that were the products of genetic reassortment between seasonal H1N1
and triple-reassortant influenza viruses [37]. The genotype of 2009 S-OIV, [C, D, E, 1A, A, 1F, F, 1A] (see
Table 1), consists of gene segments that originate from
the triple-reassortant virus, subtype H1N1 (genotype [C,
D, E, 1A, A, 1B, A, 1A]), and Eurasian avian-like swine
virus, subtype H1N1 (genotype [F, G, I, 1C, F, 1F, F,
1E]). Transmission and reassortment events are common for subtype H1N1 swine viruses, probably due to
the co-occurrence of classic swine, avian-like swine and
triple-reassortant swine viruses and swine is the intermediate host for reassortment. Reassortment between
triple-reassortant swine or avian-like swine viruses with
classic swine (H1N1) or human H1N1 viruses can all be
observed. For avian species, transmission events across

Page 8 of 13

hosts also occur. The Avian Influenza Virus Sequencing
Project operated by the USDA Agriculture Research Service reported transmission events of classic swine
viruses (genotype [B, A, C, 1A, A, 1B, A, 1A]) and triple-reassortant swine viruses (genotype [C, D, E, 3A, A,
2A, A, 1A]), most of which were transmitted from swine
to turkeys (data not shown). The latter was also confirmed by Olsen et al. in Canada [38]. Because avian
viruses have complex genotypes and abundant genetic
diversity, it is difficult to trace transmission and reassortment events among avian species. However, it is still
possible to infer potential cases of transmission and
reassortment between waterfowl and domestic poultry
because their genotype patterns are different.
Comparing swine reassortment patterns with previous work

Table 3 lists the reassortment events in swine influenza
A viruses detected by Rabadan’s method [13] in the left
part of the table. Most gene segments have one of the
two swine-origin lineages (S1 and S2) except for some
lineages being avian (A) or human (H) derived. Due to
the mixed lineages of S1 and S2, the gene segments may
be the result of reassortment. To our surprise, we found
that most of the virus strains belonged to the classic
swine, triple-reassortant swine and Eurasian avian-like
swine virus groups when the results of the genotype
profile method were analyzed. Rabadan’s distance-based
method was based on such a rule: the nucleotide differences at the third codon position between two segments
of two strains should be proportional if the two segments have a common origin. A violation of this rule
indicates that the co-occurrence of two segments may
be the result of reassortment events. The rule will
experience problems when the reference strains and segments for swine viruses are not selected carefully. For
example, if a classic swine strain is set as the reference
strain, then all triple-reassortant viruses will be classified
as reassortants because some segments originate from
classic swine viruses, whereas others do not. With
regard to Eurasian avian-like swine viruses, which have
no shared segments with the classic swine virus, their
classification results would be uncertain and dependent
on paired nucleotide differences. If the differences are
proportional by chance, the viruses would be classified
as descendants from the reference strain, or they may
be classified as reassortants. For example, two Eurasian
avian-like swine viruses (A/swine/Italy/1521/98 and A/
swine/Cloppenburg/IDT4777/2005) with the genotype
[F, G, I, 1B, F, 2A, F, 1E] are considered to have all classic swine lineages by Rabadan’s method, whereas our
method regards them as basic genotypes for Eurasian
avian-like swine viruses that were possibly reassorted
from Eurasian avian-like and triple-reassortant swine
viruses [39,40]. Another example, consider A/Swine/
Indiana/9K035/99 and A/Swine/Minnesota/55551/00,

which were reported to be new triple-reassortant swine
viruses by Karasin et al [41]. However, Rabadan
assumed that all gene segments except HA had the
same lineages as classic swine. In fact, the H1N2 reassortant viruses were derived from traditional H3N2
triple reassortants and H1N1 classic swine viruses. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the results of genotype profile method (see Additional file 1, Table S2 and
Additional file 1, Figure S1). These examples show that
our method is easy to use and accurate for analyzing
reassortment process, whereas the distance-based
method has difficulty dealing with complex situations,
although it does work in certain cases. In our opinion,
genotypes of triple-reassortant and Eurasian avian-like
swine viruses in genotype profiles can be considered
transmission and reassortment events. Thus, genotypes
such as [B, A, C, 1A, A, 2A, A, 1A] and [C, D, E, 2H, A,
3A, A, 1A] are true reassortants that can be determined
by genotype profiles. However, for H1N1 strains belonging to the classic swine viruses, the genotype profile

method could not identify whether they are reassortants
because our method has difficulty inferring intra-subtype reassortment events within the same host, as will
be discussed below.
The greatest advantage of the genotype profile is that it
is a straightforward method following the real viral reassortment process. In fact, the phylogenetic analysis process is hidden under the definition and construction of
genotypes [14]. As shown in Figure 1, lineages were
defined as significant clusters (about 10% nucleotide difference by p-distance) in phylogenetic trees constructed
by all viruses with full genomic sequences. There is no
need to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees as long as the
shape of the trees has not changed due to epidemiology
and no novel lineage needs to be assigned. The determination of genotypes is then performed by finding a position for the virus in the established trees using a BLAST
algorithm. The genotype profile method takes advantage
of the phylogenetic algorithms’ inferring from sequences,
integrates epidemiology knowledge into genotype profiles

and keeps the epidemiological interfaces for the users to
assemble.
An application (see Figure 2) called “Analysis Tool for
Influenza A Virus Evolutionary Events (IVEE)” that
implements genotype profile method is available for all
academic users from the website http://snptransformer.
sourceforge.net. In current version, the genotype profiles
as shown in Table 1 are embedded and fixed in the program by the authors. The custom genotype profile function will be implemented in the next version, which
allows the users to edit the genotype profiles to satisfy
various research demands such as updating the newlydiscovered genotypes and studying the historic reassortment events. Furthermore, each genotype will be associated with a representative virus strain to help read the
analysis results.
The genotype profile based method still had limitations when inferring intra-subtype reassortment within
the same host. For example, nearly all human H3N2
viruses have the genotype [A, D, B, 3A, A, 2A, B, 1A],
which restrains distinguishing intra-subtype reassortment events as Holmes [5] and Nelson have done [6].
The reason is that a cutoff of a 10% nucleotide difference by p-distance for defining lineages in the phylogenetic tree is too coarse to distinguish some virus clades
among subtypes, although it is sufficient for inter-subtype reassortment. One possible solution is to define
clades under lineages by FluGenome with lower cutoffs
such as 1%. In fact, the WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution Working Group has developed a web tool for HPAI
H5N1 HA clade prediction http://h5n1.flugenome.org
based on FluGenome with average distances of ≧1.5%
between clades. The tool and its unified nomenclature
system for the HA clade designation of HPAI H5N1 viral
strains were used later to facilitate resolution of the
nomenclature problem and to make comparisons among
virus clades easier across publications. However, the clade
designation was designed only for HA without taking into
account other gene segments. We suggest that a similar
international committee should be established to assign
unified clades for all segments of influenza A viruses.
This will greatly help research and increase our knowledge of the evolutionary tendency of influenza A viruses.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we extended the concept of “genotype” to
“genotype profile” to describe classic or dominant virus
strains and constructed the genotype profiles for influenza A viruses of humans, swine and avian species.
Genotype profiles not only decrease the complexity of
combinations of hundreds of genotypes but also provide
epidemiological information of influenza A viruses for
the analysis. With genotype profile method, the analysis
of reassortment and transmission events is a simple and

Page 11 of 13

reliable process that combines genotypes. We detected
various transmission and reassortment events from rare
genotypes stored in FluGenome and found that one previous summary of the reassortment events in swine
influenza A viruses may be inaccurate. Using genotype
profile method, surveillance for virus transmission and
reassortment becomes straightforward and it’s possible
to setup an automatic surveillance system for detecting
such evolutionary events.
