Abstract
Background: Many researchers have reported on the optimization of protease production;
nevertheless, only a few have reported on the optimization of the production of organic solventtolerant proteases. Ironically, none has reported on thermostable organic solvent-tolerant
protease to date. The aim of this study was to isolate the thermostable organic solvent-tolerant
protease and identify the culture conditions which support its production. The bacteria of genus
Bacillus are active producers of extra-cellular proteases, and the thermostability of enzyme
production by Bacillus species has been well-studied by a number of researchers. In the present
study, the Bacillus subtilis strain Rand was isolated from the contaminated soil found in Port Dickson,
Malaysia.
Results: A thermostable organic solvent-tolerant protease producer had been identified as Bacillus
subtilis strain Rand, based on the 16S rRNA analysis conducted, as well as the morphological
characteristics and biochemical properties. The production of the thermostable organic solventtolerant protease was optimized by varying various physical culture conditions. Inoculation with
5.0% (v/v) of (AB600 = 0.5) inoculum size, in a culture medium (pH 7.0) and incubated for 24 h at
37°C with 200 rpm shaking, was the best culture condition which resulted in the maximum growth
and production of protease (444.7 U/ml; 4042.4 U/mg). The Rand protease was not only stable in
the presence of organic solvents, but it also exhibited a higher activity than in the absence of organic
solvent, except for pyridine which inhibited the protease activity. The enzyme retained 100, 99 and
80% of its initial activity, after the heat treatment for 30 min at 50, 55, and 60°C, respectively.
Conclusion: Strain Rand has been found to be able to secrete extra-cellular thermostable organic
solvent-tolerant protease into the culture medium. The protease exhibited a remarkable stability
towards temperature and organic solvent. This unique property makes it attractive and useful to
be used in industrial applications.

Background
Currently, enzymes have attracted the world attention due
to their wide range of industrial applications in many
fields, including organic synthesis, clinical analysis, pharmaceuticals, detergents, food production and fermentation. Enzymes are gradually replacing the use of harsh
chemicals in various industrial processes [1]. Proteases are
one of the most important groups of industrial enzymes
and they account for nearly 60% of the total enzyme sale
[2-4].

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/8/1/20

However, cultivation conditions are essential in a successful production of an enzyme, while optimization parameters, such as pH and temperature, are important in
developing this cultivation process [15].
In this study, the effects of physical factors on the production of a thermostable organic solvent-tolerant protease,
from Bacillus subtilis strain Rand, were identified and
investigated.

Results and discussion
In industrial applications, with thermopiles and thermostable enzymes, the isolation of enzymes is dominating over micro-organisms [5]. Bacterial proteases,
especially from Bacillus sp., are the most widely exploited
industrial enzymes and among the bacteria, Bacillus sp.,
are producers of extra-cellular proteases [6].
The industrial use of proteases, in detergents and in
leather processing, requires that the enzymes be stable at
higher temperatures. Thermostable proteases are advantageous in some applications because of the higher processing temperatures which can be employed, resulting in
much faster reaction rates, increasing the solubility of
non-gaseous reactants and products, and reducing the
incidence of microbial contamination by mesophilic
organisms [7].
Thermophilic enzymes are potentially applicable in a
wide range of industrial processes, particularly and mainly
due to their denaturant tolerance and extraordinary operational stability at high temperatures. Such enzymes are
used in chemical, food, pharmaceutical, paper, textile and
other industries [5,8,9].
Enzymatic conversions in non-aqueous media have been
shown to possess many potential industrial applications.
The areas of application vary widely from food additives,
flavours and fragrances to pharmaceuticals, pesticides and
specialty polymers [10]. Enzymes, which are stable and
active in non-aqueous media, are in large demand for
their increasing application in organic synthesis [11]. The
use of proteases in peptide synthesis is limited by the specificity and the instability of the enzymes in the presence
of organic solvents, since reactions occurred in organic
media. However, little attention has been given to the
study of organic solvent-stable protease [12].
Each organism or strain has its own special conditions for
the maximum enzyme production [13]. The general rules
for the optimization of microbial protease production are
affected by various physical factors which include pH, cultivation temperature, shaking condition and aeration.
These factors are important to promote, stimulate,
enhance and optimize the production of proteases [14].

Screening and isolation of bacteria
Contamination and hot surrounding area may provide a
good environment for the growth of micro-organisms
producing thermostable, organic solvent-tolerant proteases. Several samples were obtained from a car service
workshop located in Port Dickson, and hot spring water
from Batang Kali and Selayang, Malaysia. The temperatures were between 45 to 90°C when the sample was collected. From a comprehensive screening on the Skim Milk
Agar (SMA) plate, ten isolates (L1, L2, BK, BK1, BK2, PD,
PD1, PD2, PD and Rand) showed positive results by forming zone of lyses around the colonies on the SMA. All
these isolates were found to be able to produce protease
(data not shown). Among the ten isolates, Rand was
detected to have the highest protease activity (34.9 U/ml),
and was selected for further study.
Identification of isolate Rand
16S rDNA analysis
The primers are highly conserved among prokaryotes and
found to amplify the whole region of the rRNA gene,
which is 1500 bp. The PCR product sequencing was done
by the First BASE Laboratories Sdn Bhd (Shah Alam,
Selangor, Malaysia). The DNA homology search on the
GenBank database http://www.ncbi.nih.gov was performed. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the
comparison of the 16S rDNA sequence of this isolate and
other strain of Bacillus. All the sequences were aligned
with CLUSTALW from Biology Workbench database at
http://workbench.sdsc.edu[16]. 16S rDNA sequences of
other Bacillus were obtained from the GenBank database
http://www.ncbi.nih.gov. The results gathered from the
16S rDNA analyses show that Bacillus subtilis strain Rand
is very close to Brevibacterium halotolerans, Bacillus malacintesis strain LMG 22477, Bacillus malacitensis strain CECT
5687 and Bacillus axarquiensis strain LMG 22476 (Figure
1). The partial sequencing of the 16S rDNA shows a
99.6% similarity to different strains of Bacillus subtilis. In
addition, the analysis of the cellular fatty acids also shows
a good correspondence to the profile of the Bacillus subtilis
group.

Strain Rand is an aerobic, rod-shaped, with 0.7–0.8 μm in
width and 2.5–3.0 μm in length gram positive bacteria.

analysis.

The biochemical, morphological and physiological properties of strain Rand are listed in Table 1.
According to the 16S rDNA analysis, the biochemical
results and morphological properties of the bacterium
were identified as Bacillus subtilis strain Rand.
Organic solvent-stability of crude enzyme
Enzymes are usually inactivated or denaturated in the
presence of organic solvents [12]. The effects of different
organic solvents on protease stability were studied. The
relative activity, which remained after 30 min of incubation in 25% (v/v) of organic solvent, is shown in Table 2.
The activity of the enzyme, without any solvent (control),
was taken as 100%. Rand protease showed a remarkable
stability in the presence of all of the solvents, except pyridine (log P 0.71) as shown in Table 2. The remaining
activity of the Rand protease was found to be 104, 197,
130, 134, 146, 209, 151, 152 and 151% in the presence of
butanol, benzene, toluene, p-xylene, n-hexane, n-decane,
n-dodacane, n-tetradecane and n-hexadecane, respectively
(data not shown). This level of stability, towards hydrophobic and hydrophilic solvents, is unique. The remaining activities of alkaliphilic protease, from Bacillus subtilis
TKU07, were 65% and 90% in the presence of only 20%

(v/v) of butanol and toluene [17]. Gupta and Khare
reported that crude P. aeruginosa PseA protease showed a
remarkable stability in the presence of most solvents, having the logarithm of the partition coefficient (log P) above
2.0, but was less stable in the presence of hydrophilic solvents [11]. The stability of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa protease, in the presence of organic solvents (of which the
values of the log P were equal to or more than 3.2), was
almost the same as the one found in the absence of
organic solvents [18]. Purified protease, from Pseudomonas
aeruginosa PseA strain, was found to be stable in the presence of a range of organic solvents, but was detected to be
less stable in benzene and isooctane [19]. In another
study, the protease from Pseudomonas aeruginosa stain K
was activated when compared to the control, in the presence of 25% organic solvents, with the Log P values
exceeding 4.0; however, in the presence of 25% organic
solvents with the Log P values below 4.0, the stability of
the protease was lesser after 30 min of incubation [20].
Slightly over 20% of the activity remained [21] in the
crude protease derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa sanai, in the presence of butanol, chloroform, and hexane.
However, the results in this study showed that the protease, from the Rand strain, was not only stable in the
presence of various organic solvents (with the Log P val-

incubated at different temperatures ranging from 37 to
70°C for 30 min, rapidly cooled, and the protease activities were measured by the standard assay procedure. The
protease appeared to be stable and was found to be able
to retain its full activity after 30 min of incubation in the
temperature ranging from 37 to 55°C (Figure 2). The
crude enzyme retained 80% activity (0.086 mg/ml), even
after the heat treatment at 60°C for 30 min. A reduction
in the enzyme activity was observed at the temperature
values above 60°C.
The Rand protease is more thermostable than other
organic solvent tolerant proteases. Ghorbel et al. isolated
a protease from Bacillus cereus BG1 which retained 89.5 of
its original activity, after 15-min incubation at 55°C, in
the presence of 2 mM Ca2+; meanwhile, no activity was
detected in the absence of Ca2+ [12]. An organic solvent-

of some organic solvents with the Log P values below 2.0.
These results indicated that this protease might be a novel
solvent-stable protease.

stable protease from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PST-01 was
reported to be stable at the temperature below 50°C [23].
A solvent stable protease, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa
PseA retained 80% of its initial activity after heating, for
30 min at 55°C [11]. In particular, TKU004 metalloprotease had 10% of its activity retained at 60°C, but was
completely inactivated at 70°C [24]. The Rand protease
displayed a greater stability at higher temperatures, and
thus was suitable to be used in industrial and biotechnological applications.
The effects of temperature on the production of protease
Temperature is a critical parameter which needs to be controlled and this is usually varied from organism to another
[13]. The optimum temperature for the production of protease and bacterial growth was investigated from 30°C to
65°C. In shaken cultures, 37°C was found to the optimum temperature for both protease production and bacterial growth (Figure 3). The incubation at 30, 40, 45 and
50°C was found to decrease the production of protease,
and no protease activity was detected at 55, 60 and 65°C.
The optimum temperature for crude protease, produced
from B. subtilis strain 38, was 47°C [25]. The optimum
temperature for the protease produced by Bacillus sp. MIG
was found to be 30°C [26]. Meanwhile, the optimum
temperature for the production of protease by Bacillus sp
SMIA-2 was 60°C [7]. The optimum temperature for the
protease produced by Bacillus licheniformis was 50°C [27].
The studies by Frankena et al. [28] showed that there was
a link between enzyme synthesis and energy metabolism
in bacteria, and this was controlled by the temperature
and oxygen uptake. As for the extra-cellular enzymes, temperature was found to influence their secretion, possibly
by changing the physical properties of the cell membrane

[14]. On the other hand, a lower growth of Rand strain at
high temperatures could be due to the lack of dissolved
oxygen in the medium, which resulted to a low protease
activity. It is a well-known fact that protein conformation
changes or degraded at higher temperatures, and hence,
causes a decrease in the protease activity [29].
The effects of pH on the production of protease
The pH of the medium started to decrease after 4 h to 4.5
after 8 h of growth (Figure 4). The increased acidity was
due to the production of acids during the bacterial
growth. After that, the pH was slightly increased to 5.2 at
12 h, and to 6.4 at 16 h. It turned neutral at 20 h and
remained constant up to 48 h. The rise in the pH after 8 h
of incubation could be due to utilization of organic acids
or the production of alkaline compounds.

Extra-cellular protease was detected over a broad pH range
(pH 4.0 to 9.0), with the optimum production of protease
and bacterial growth exhibited at pH 7.0 (Figure 5). The
bacterial growth and production of protease in an acidic
medium at pH 6.0 were higher as compared to that in
alkaline at pH 8.0. However, at an extreme acidity of pH
4.0, the production of protease was found to be greatly
reduced. The optimum pH for the production of protease
determined in this study is in agreement with the optimum pH for the protease from Bacillus sp. MIG [26]. The
crude protease enzyme, produced from B. subtilis strain
38, had the optimal pH at 6.5 [25]. Malathu et al. reported
an extra-cellular protease from a novel bacterial isolate
showing the maximum activity at pH 7.5 [1]. Meanwhile,
Nascimento and Martins reported an optimum pH of 8.0
for a protease derived from therophilic Bacillus sp strains
SMIA-2 [7].

Effect of pH on protease production. Bacterial cultures
were adjusted to pH 4, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0,
13.0 and incubated at 37°C with 150 rpm for 24 h. Protease
activity at pH 7 was considered as 100%.

Moon and Parulekar [30] reported that the pH of culture
has been shown to strongly affect many enzymatic processes and transportation of various components across the
cell membrane.
The effect of agitation rate on the production of protease
Micro-organisms vary in their oxygen requirements. In
particular, oxygen acts as a terminal electron acceptor for
oxidative reactions to provide energy for cellular activities.
The variation in the agitation speed has been found to
influence the extent of mixing in the shake flasks or the
bioreactor, and also affect the nutrient availability [7].

The effects of agitation rate on the production of protease
and bacterial growth were investigated. Figure 6 shows
that the highest protease production and bacteria growth
were obtained when agitated at 200 rpm. At this speed,
the aeration of the culture medium was increased, and
this further led to a sufficient supply of dissolved oxygen
in the media [13]. Although the production of protease
was found to decrease when shaken at 250 rpm, the static
condition almost inhibited its production.
As a conclusion, higher agitation rates could increase the
oxygen pressure of the system but did not bring about the
increase in production, probably because at a high agitation rate, the structure of enzyme would be altered [31].
However, lowering the aeration rate could cause a drastic
reduction in the protease yields [24]. This indicates that a

activity at 200 rpm was considered as 100%.

reduction in oxygen supply is an important limiting factor
for growth as well as protease synthesis [7].
The effects of inoculum size on the production of protease
The finite volume of a culture medium means that it can
only contain limited nutrients for the micro-organism.
Furthermore, the consumption of the nutrients is largely
dependent on the population of bacteria. To ensure a high
production of enzyme in the limited volume of medium,
the bacterial inoculum size should therefore be controlled.

Inoculating several production media, with various inoculum sizes (from 1% to 11%) of the isolate Rand, could
affect the production of protease and bacterial growth.
The maximum production of protease and bacterial
growth were achieved with an inoculum size of 5% (v/v)
(Figure 7). Similar result was also reported by Mabrouk et
al. [32] who found the maximum production of protease
by Bacillus licheniformis ATCC21415 with an inoculum
size of 5% (v/v). A higher inoculum of 11% (v/v) was
found to reduce the production of protease more than if
the lower inoculum size of 1% (v/v) was used. Therefore,
high inoculum sizes do not necessarily give higher protease yield. The increase in the production of protease
using small inoculum sizes was suggested to be due to the
higher surface area to volume ratio, which resulted in the
increased production of protease [14]. In addition, an
improved distribution of dissolve oxygen and more effective uptake of nutrient also contributed to a higher protease production. If the inoculum sizes are too small,
insufficient number of bacteria would then lead to a
reduced amount of secreted protease [33].

Effect of inoculum size on protease production. Culture media were incubated with 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0 and

at 200 rpm for 24 h. Protease activity at with an inoculum
size of 5% (v/v) was considered as 100%.

However, higher inoculum sizes could lead to or cause a
lack of oxygen and depletion of nutrient in the culture
media. Different optimum inoculum sizes have been
reported by other researchers for different bacteria: 1.0%
(v/v) for Aspergillus flavus [34] and 4.0% (v/v) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain K [14].
Under optimized conditions (growth temperature of
37°C; bacterial inoculum size at AB600 = 0.5, 5% (v/v); initial pH of 7.0; 24 h of incubated time; agitation rate of 200
rpm), the highest protease activity of 444.7 U/ml (4042.4
U/mg) was obtained.

Conclusion
The aim of this study was to optimize the physical factors
affecting the productions of thermostable and organic solvent-tolerant protease. For this purpose, the organic solvent-tolerant and thermostabe protease were isolated
from a newly isolated bacterium (Bacillus subtilis strain
Rand). The bacterium was identified, based on the 16S
rDNA analysis, biochemical tests and morphological
study conducted.
It can be concluded that the maximum bacterial growth
and production of protease were achieved under optimized conditions.
The extra-cellular protease was found to exhibit a remarkable stability towards several organic solvents. In more
specific, it was found to retain 100% and 80% activity at
55 and 60°C, respectively, after 30 min of incubation.

Bacterial isolation
The bacteria used in this study were isolated from contaminated soil mixed with engine oil collected from a car service workshop in Port Dickson, Malaysia. A soil sample (3
g) was suspended in a sterilized Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB)
(50 ml). The sample was incubation at 50°C (the temperature during sampling) with an agitation rate at 150 rpm
for 24 hr.
Identification of the bacteria
In this study, Bacillus subtilis strain Rand was identified
based on the 16S rDNA analysis, morphological properties and biochemical characteristics. The 16S rDNA
sequence was amplified via the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), using two universal primers, known as forward (5'GAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3')
and
reverse
(5'CGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3').
The
16S
rDNA
sequence of Bacillus subtilis strain Rand was analyzed using
the software package MEGA 4 [35]. Prior to gram staining,
pure bacterial strain was streaked on the nutrient agar
plate and incubated for 24 h at 50°C for the morphological study. An observation of this was then done under a
light microscope. The morphological and physiological
characteristics were further determined at Deutsche
Sammlung Von Mikroorganismen (DSMZ), Germany.
The physiological characteristics study included catalase
and oxidase test, anaerobic growth, Voges-Proskauer test,
growth at 30, 50 and 55°C, growth in medium at pH 5.7,
2%, 5%, 7% and 10% NaCl, fermentation of D-glucose, Larabinose, D- xylose, D-mannitol, D-fructose, hydrolysis
starch, gelatine, casein and Tween 80, use of citrate and
propionate, nitrate reduction, indole production, phenylalanine deaminase and arginine dihydrolase test.
Production media and growth condition
The culture was grown in standard 500 ml blue cap bottle
containing 50 ml of production media. The medium consisted of (g/l); CaCl2.2H2O 0.5, KH2PO4 0.2,
MgSO4.7H2O 0.5, NaCl 0.1 and 1% peptone [36]. The pH
of the media was adjusted to 7.0 before being autoclaved
at 121°C for 15 min. The bacterium was grown for 18 h at
37°C on a shaker at 150 rpm. The culture was centrifuged
at 10,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was used as
crude enzyme for further study.
Protease assay
The protease activity was determined by a slight modification method proposed by Rahman et al. [37]. Azocasein
(0.5%, 1 ml) was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris-HCl-2 mM CaCl2
pH7.0. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of
enzyme solution into the azocasein solution and incubated at 50°C for 30 min. An equal volume of 10% (w/v)
TCA was added to terminate the reaction, and the mixture
was then allowed at room temperature for 30 min, before

centrifugation in eppendoft micro-centrifuge at 13,000 ×
g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and mixed
with an equal volume of 1 N NaOH. The absorbance was
read at 450 nm. One unit of protease activity is defined in
the assay conditions, giving an increase of 0.001 absorbance unit at 450 nm per minute [38]. As a control, the
enzyme was added at the end of the incubation period.
Protein assay
Protein was measured using the method suggested by
Bradford [39], with bovine serum albumin as the standard.
Organic solvent-stability of crude enzyme
Three millilitre of crude protease was incubated with 1.0
ml of organic solvent at 50°C with a constant shaking at
150 rpm for 30 min. The proteolytic activities were measured at zero time and the after incubation period using the
assay method described above. For control, the solvent
was replaced by distilled water. The organic solvents chosen in this study were toluene, n-tetradecane, n-hexadecane, n-dodacane, pyridine, p-xylene, n-hexane, benzene,
n-decane and butanol.

protease production) for 24 h under 150 rpm of agitation
rate.
The effects of agitation rate on the production of protease
The effects of agitation rate on the growth and production
of protease were studied by cultivating the bacteria under
different agitation rates (0 to 250 rpm). These cultures
were incubated at 37°C for 24 h.
The effects of inoculum size on the production of protease
The effects of bacterial inoculum size (A600 = 0.5) on the
growth and production of protease were investigated
using different inoculum sizes ranging from 1 to 11% (v/
v). The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 24 h, under
the agitation rate of 200 rpm (i.e. the optimum agitation
rate for the production of protease). Each experiment was
carried out in triplicates and the results were taken in the
means of three independent determinations.
Statistical analysis
For statistical analysis, a standard deviation for each
experimental result was calculated using the Excel Spreadsheets available in the Microsoft Excel.

Thermostability of crude enzyme
In this research, the effects of temperature on the crude
protease stability were studied. The crude enzyme (without any CaCl2) was incubated for 30 min at different temperatures (37, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70°C). The treated
enzyme was immediately put in ice-bath for 15 min
before measuring the activity. The proteolytic activities
were measured at zero time and after the incubation
period, using the assay method described in the earlier
section.

Competing interests

The effect of temperature on the production of protease
The ability of the Bacillus subtilis strain Rand to grow and
produce protease, at elevated temperatures (30 to 65°C),
was studied. For this purpose, separate cultures were incubated at 30, 37, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65°C for 24 h, with
agitation at 150 rpm.

The effect of pH on the production of protease
A loop-full of 24h-old single colony of Rand strain was
transferred from a fresh Nutrient agar plate into a 1 L blue
cap bottle of production medium (pH 7.0). The culture
was incubated at 37°C and 150 rpm on the shaker for 48
hours. Then, some samples were taken at 4 h intervals so
as to determine the protease activity and the pH level of
the culture medium. The effects of the initial medium pH
on the growth and production of protease were studied by
adjusting the media (with 1 M NaOH or HCl) to different
pH levels ranging from 4 to 13. The media were autoclave,
cooled and inoculated with an overnight culture of isolate
Rand, and incubated at 37°C (optimum temperature for
