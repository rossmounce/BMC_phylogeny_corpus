Natural selection retains overrepresented out-offrame stop codons against frameshift peptides in
prokaryotes

Abstract
Background: Out-of-frame stop codons (OSCs) occur naturally in coding sequences of all organisms, providing a
mechanism of early termination of translation in incorrect reading frame so that the metabolic cost associated with
frameshift events can be reduced. Given such a functional significance, we expect statistically overrepresented
OSCs in coding sequences as a result of a widespread selection. Accordingly, we examined available prokaryotic
genomes to look for evidence of this selection.
Results: The complete genome sequences of 990 prokaryotes were obtained from NCBI GenBank. We found that
low G+C content coding sequences contain significantly more OSCs and G+C content at specific codon positions
were the principal determinants of OSC usage bias in the different reading frames. To investigate if there is
overrepresentation of OSCs, we modeled the trinucleotide and hexanucleotide biases of the coding sequences
using Markov models, and calculated the expected OSC frequencies for each organism using a Monte Carlo
approach. More than 93% of 342 phylogenetically representative prokaryotic genomes contain excess OSCs.
Interestingly the degree of OSC overrepresentation correlates positively with G+C content, which may represent a
compensatory mechanism for the negative correlation of OSC frequency with G+C content. We extended the
analysis using additional compositional bias models and showed that lower-order bias like codon usage and
dipeptide bias could not explain the OSC overrepresentation. The degree of OSC overrepresentation was found to
correlate negatively with the optimal growth temperature of the organism after correcting for the G+C% and AT
skew of the coding sequence.
Conclusions: The present study uses approaches with statistical rigor to show that OSC overrepresentation is a
widespread phenomenon among prokaryotes. Our results support the hypothesis that OSCs carry functional
significance and have been selected in the course of genome evolution to act against unintended frameshift
occurrences. Some results also hint that OSC overrepresentation being a compensatory mechanism to make up for
the decrease in OSCs in high G+C organisms, thus revealing the interplay between two different determinants of
OSC frequency.

Background
The biased codon usage in many genomes is generally
believed to result from selection for maximizing translational speed and/or accuracy [1-3], although there is
reservation as to what extent the notion can be generalized to all organisms including humans [4,5]. In theory,
optimal synonymous codons result in the maximum

translational speed. However, the preservation of suboptimal synonymous codons suggests that maximizing
translational speed is not the only determinant of codon
bias. Synonymous codons may also play a role in gene
regulation and generation of the correct protein conformation [6-8]. In some sense translational accuracy may
be more important than the speed of translation, and
reading frame maintenance is a key functional requirement of translational accuracy as a result of the triplet
nature of the genetic code. Given the complexity of the
protein synthesis process, it is expected that a certain

proportion of all transcriptional and translational processes may go awry even under normal conditions.
Additional mechanisms like frameshift suppression and
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay help to reduce the
incidence and impact of such errors at different steps of
the protein synthesis pathway [9,10]. Despite these
mechanisms, erroneous proteins cannot be entirely
eliminated. Whether and how the cell can deal specifically with these incorrect and often truncated proteins is
currently uncertain.
The presence of stop codons in the alternate reading
frames stop the translation in an incorrect frame (Figure
1) and truncate the portion of frameshift peptides.
Although this property of the coding sequence has been
known for a long time [11], it has been taken for
granted by most researchers. In a study on 72 bacterial
genomes, the occurrences of OSCs were examined specifically in detail with the results suggesting that OSC
frequency and bias might have influenced the evolution
of the bacterial genome [12]. The functional significance
of an increased OSC frequency can be explained by the
ambush hypothesis: OSCs could reduce the metabolic
costs of accidental frameshifts, and a positive correlation
between the usage of codons and the number of ways
codons can be part of hidden stops (i.e., OSCs) is
expected [13].
Natural selection can act on the coding sequences to
increase OSC frequencies and minimize the influence of
translational frameshift errors in different ways. It has
been proposed that the genetic code has been optimized
to maximize the number of OSCs that could be
embedded within the coding sequence [13-15]. On a
shorter time-scale, evolution of the coding sequences
might contribute by favoring dicodons (codon pairs)
that encode OSCs. Presumably it would also be
mediated by mechanisms such as synonymous codon
usage bias and specific oligonucleotide biases. We noted

Page 2 of 13

only one study on single-stranded RNA viral genomes
that has directly studied the expected and observed frequencies of these out-of-frame stop codons (OSCs) [16].
Other studies on dicodon bias [17] and overlapping
genes [18] have touched upon the topic of OSCs indirectly (that is, the results are not directly relevant to the
investigation of relative abundance of OSC, as shown
later in the discussion section). A clear limitation is that
the calculation of odds ratio adopted by these studies
examines only up to two simple types of compositional
biases at a time. Furthermore, the reading frame context
of coding sequences is frequently ignored, or the individual frames are not taken into account. In general, these
limitations led to an unsatisfactory and incomplete
description of k-mer frequencies that biased the
expected number of OSCs, and only the basic association between genomic G+C content and OSCs could be
identified [18].
To address the shortcomings of the previous studies,
we adopted an approach using Markov models to analyze the coding sequences of prokaryotic genomes. The
Markov model is based on the concept of portraying the
coding sequence as a Markov chain with defined state
path and transition/emission states. This approach is
superior in preserving the reading frame context and
allowing nested models to account for multiple codon
or oligonucleotide biases simultaneously. Additionally it
provides the distribution of expected OSC frequencies
for each genome and hence allows hypothesis testing in
a formal statistical framework. With the availability of
nearly a thousand complete prokaryotic genomes at the
time of study, we were able to utilize this vast amount
of data to look for any significant deviation of OSC frequencies on a per genome basis. We provide evidence
in support of the ambush hypothesis and suggest the
near-universal presence of selection against translation
of frameshift products in prokaryotic genomes.

Methods
Genome sequences

Complete prokaryotic genomic sequences were obtained
from NCBI GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi. Protein coding sequences were identified using gene annotations available in the associated
GenBank files. Non-protein coding genes (e.g. pseudogenes and rRNA genes), incomplete genes, coding
sequences with less than 100 codons, extra-chromosomal sequences and sequences containing ambiguous
bases were excluded from analysis. Genomes of bacteria
that utilize a non-standard genetic code, such as Mycoplasma spp., and mitochondrial genomes were analyzed
separately. Additionally, ‘artificial metagenomes’ were
constructed from randomly selected prokaryotic genomes for conducting mixed genome analysis [19].
Distribution and usage bias of OSCs in alternate reading
frames

Absolute OSC counts and OSC densities in the +2 and
+3 reading frames (corresponding to the reading frame
resultant from +1 and -1 frameshifts respectively) were
calculated on a per gene and per genome basis respectively. The absolute OSC counts for the 2 alternate
reading frames of all genes in each genome were compared using paired 2-sample t-test. Correction for multiple comparison was done by controlling the false
discovery rate at the 5% level using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Relationship of the ratios with G+C
content, GC skew and AT skew of protein coding
sequences was assessed using multiple regression
analysis.
OSC usage bias was defined as the relative codon frequencies of the three stop codons in the two alternate
reading frames and assessed by principal component
analysis (PCA) as done previously [20]. To investigate
the contribution of the G+C content of the 3 codon
positions to the OSC usage bias, multiple linear regression analysis was performed with the first principal
component as the dependent variable and G+C content
of each codon position as regressors. The relative
importance of the regressors is estimated using the proportional marginal variance decomposition (PMVD)
metric by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates as implemented in the R package ‘relaimpo’ [21].
Analysis of OSC relative abundance in the coding
sequence

Although the abundance of any trinucleotide can be
expressed as a odds ratio given frequencies of its component mononucleotides and dinucleotides (gxyz = fxyz fx
fy fz /fxy fyz fxnz) [22], the metric should not be directly
applied to the analysis of OSC relative abundance in

protein coding sequences because of internal stop codon
avoidance in the coding frame. For example, the dicodons TAATTA and TTAATA are equivalent in length,
nucleotide and dinucleotide composition, but the former
is not allowed in the coding frame while the latter contains an additional OSC. As stop codons in the coding
frame could not contribute to formation of OSCs, the
number of expected OSC occurrences would also
increase. Thus, the avoidance of in-frame stop codons
will lead to asymmetry of trinucleotide occurrences in
the alternate reading frames.
A Monte Carlo approach is used to estimate the
expected OSC frequencies for each genome. To reduce
the impact of sampling bias from heavily sampled genera and species such as Staphylococcus aureus, we
trimmed the original set of available prokaryotic genomes so that on average one genome per genus is
included for analysis. Random coding sequences matching the distribution of gene lengths in the target genome
were generated using second-order and fifth-order
three-periodic Markov models trained on the set of coding sequences, as implemented in the MARKOV package of GenRGenS [23]. The expected frequencies of
OSC occurrences in the simulated sequences were then
compared to the frequencies observed in the actual
sequences using the one-sample t-test, with correction
for multiple comparison performed by controlling the
false discovery rate at the 5% level using the BenjaminiHochberg procedure. 200 Monte Carlo trials were performed for each genome.
Origin of OSC bias in selected genomes

To investigate the origin of an excess of OSC abundance
in a genome, we selected several reference genome
sequences for further analysis. These included diverse
genomes with different degrees of OSC relative abundance. Random coding sequences matching the distribution of gene lengths in the genomes were generated
using different codon-based Markov models trained on
the sets of coding sequences. These different models
accounted for one or more of the following properties
of protein coding sequence: codon usage bias, dicodon
usage bias and dipeptide bias. As the models were not
implemented in the GenRGenS package, the functionality of random sequence generation under these models
was implemented in an in-house Perl program. The
Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generation
algorithm as implemented in the CPAN module Math::
Random::MT::Auto http://search.cpan.org/dist/MathRandom-MT-Auto/ was used, as the numbers generated
were known to have suitable statistical properties for
Monte Carlo analysis [24]. The OSC frequencies in the
alternate frames of the simulated sequences were then

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/491

compared to that in the actual sequences using the onesample t-test.
Relationship between OSC overrepresentation and
optimal growth temperature

We explored the possible relationship between genomic
OSC overrepresentation and phenotype of the organism.
As a test case, we examined the correlation between the
degree of OSC overrepresentation and the organism’s
optimal growth temperature using multiple linear
regression analysis, as the growth temperature has been
shown to be associated with genomic sequence composition. Regression model comparison was performed
using ANOVA and stepwise variable selection using
Akaike information criterion. Data on optimal growth
temperature of the organisms were obtained from previous studies [25,26].
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using R version 2.10.1.
All p-values reported are for a two-tailed test, and p <
0.05 is considered statistically significant.

Results
Distribution of OSCs in alternate reading frames

Among the 990 analyzed genomes (Additional File 1,
Supplementary Table S1), the mean OSC densities range
from 1.82 to 27.6 per 100 codons. When the OSCs are
analyzed by reading frames, the mean OSC densities for
frame +2 range from 1.52 to 13.2 per 100 codons and
the mean OSC densities for frame +3 range from 0.11
to 15.3 per 100 codons (Figure 2). OSC densities for
both reading frames decrease with increasing G+C content of the coding region, and the rate of decrease was
greater for frame +3. The mean OSC density was found
to be very strongly and negatively correlated with the G
+C content in the coding regions by linear regression (p
< 0.0001; r = -0.9721, R2 = 0.9451). The negative correlation is consistent with our expectations as all three
stop codons are AT-rich. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that accounting for GC skew of coding
regions and genome length slightly improved the model
fit (p < 0.0001; adjusted R2 = 0.9608) when compared to
the original model by ANOVA (p < 0.0001).
When comparing absolute OSC counts on a per gene
basis, 421 out of 990 genomes (42.5%) have a significantly higher OSC count in the +2 reading frame, while
520 (52.5%) have a higher OSC count in the +3 reading
frame. The ratio of absolute OSC counts in the 2 alternate reading frames on a per gene basis was found to be
correlated with the GC ratio (ratio of [GC]:[AT] content) of coding sequences (Figure 3). The x-intercept of
the regression line is noted to be 0.9378. Hence, OSC
occurrences for frames +2 and +3 are predicted to be

Page 4 of 13

approximately equal at a G+C content of 48.40%, as
exemplified by the case of Dehalococcoides sp. VS with a
G+C content of 48.15%. Multiple regression analysis
showed that accounting for coding genome size, GC
skew and codon positional effects improved the model
fit (adjusted R2 = 0.7530) when compared to the original
model by ANOVA (p < 0.0001), although the G+C content at codon position 1 was found not to contribute
significantly to the regression model.
OSC usage bias in alternate reading frames

The first three axes from PCA of OSC usage bias
accounted for 92.7%, 3.9% and 2.5% of the total variance
respectively (Additional File 1, Supplementary Figure S1).
Linear regression of the first PCA axis with G+C content
showed a strong correlation (R 2 = 0.9151; p < 0.0001)
(Figure 4). Among the OSCs, the TAG frequency in
frame +3 was the only one not to be associated with the
first PCA axis at all (Additional File 1, Supplementary
Figure S2), and hence not considered to be associated
with the G+C content of the coding sequence.
The OSC usage bias in each alternate reading frame is
considered below individually. For the +2 frame, OSC
occurs in the dicodon sequence NT[GA|AA|AG]NN in
the protein coding frame. As the third codon position is
the most variable codon position due to degeneracy of
the genetic code, variation of G+C content at the third
codon position (GC3) should have the greatest effect on
OSC usage bias for frame +2. As expected, relative frequencies of TAA and TAG for frame +2 decreased with
increasing GC3 while that of TGA increased (Figure 5),
despite the equivalent nucleotide composition of TAG
and TGA. However, as G+C content in all codon positions are highly correlated, the OSC usage bias would
also be highly correlated with G+C content at other
codon positions. To resolve the situation, the relative
contribution of the G+C content at different codon
positions to OSC usage bias was estimated by the
PMVD metric, which emphasizes the conditional importance of one regressor in the presence of other regressors [27] and hence can account for the significant
multicollinearity among the G+C content at different
codon positions. Results showed that GC3 is the dominant independent regressor of OSC usage bias in the +2
frame (Figure 6A), suggesting that correlation of GC1 or
GC2 with OSC usage bias is mostly a result of their
multicollinearity with GC3.
The coding sequence prerequisite for OSC occurrence
in the +3 frame is the dicodon NNT[GA|AA|AG]N. In
this case, OSC usage bias is not directly affected by GC3
(which should only affect overall OSC frequency) but by
the first and second codon positions of the second half
of the dicodon. Regression analysis confirmed that GC1
is the dominant independent regressor (Figure 6B).

+2 frame (91.81%), which is consistent with the PCA results shown in Additional File 1, Supplementary Figure 2.

Analysis of OSC relative abundance in the coding
sequence

Almost all the examined genomes (334/342; 97.7%)
showed overrepresentation of OSCs in the +2 frame when
compared to frequencies predicted by the second-order
three-periodic Markov model. This model accounted for
the codon position-specific trinucleotide bias including
codon usage bias. Only 3 genomes (0.9%) showed a statistically significant underrepresentation of OSCs in the +2
frame under the same model. When compared to the
OSC frequencies predicted by the fifth-order three-periodic Markov model, 185 genomes (54.1%) still showed statistically significant overrepresentation of OSCs in the +2

frame, while 26 genomes (7.6%) showed underrepresentation of OSCs in the same frame. For the +3 frame, 57 and
53 genomes (16.7% and 15.5%) showed overrepresentation
and underrepresentation of OSCs respectively when compared to frequencies predicted by the second-order threeperiodic Markov model. When examined under the fifthorder three-periodic Markov model, the number of genomes with OSC overrepresentation in the +3 frame greatly
increased to 306 (89.5%), while only 4 (1.2%) showed
underrepresentation.
When both alternate reading frames were considered
together, 339 genomes (99.1%) showed OSC overrepresentation under the second-order three-periodic Markov

Tse et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:491
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/491

model, while 319 genomes (93.3%) showed OSC overrepresentation under the fifth-order three-periodic Markov model. The percentage deviations of the observed
from mean expected OSCs were found to range from
-0.0343% to +5.69% and -0.111% to +0.616% under the
second- and fifth-order three-periodic Markov models
respectively. There are significant positive correlations
between G+C content and the degrees of OSC overrepresentation under both models (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = 0.838 and 0.630 for the second- and
fifth-order three-periodic Markov models respectively)
(Figures 7A and 7B).
Mixed genome analysis was conducted with 8 artificial
metagenomes with sizes ranging from 5.2 to 12.2 MB.
OSC overrepresentation was found in all cases, ranging
from 0.084 to 0.841%, under both the second- and fifthorder three-periodic Markov models. These results
indirectly suggested that the phenomenon of OSC overrepresentation is stable to distant horizontal gene transfer, and should apply to presently uncharacterized
genomes that may have arisen from extensive horizontal
gene transfer with significant sequence compositional
diversity and phylogenetic incongruence [28,29].
Origin of OSC bias in selected genomes

The expected frequencies of OSC occurrences in the
selected genomes under the different models were
shown in Table 1. The results showed that expected
OSC frequencies calculated using codon-based models
showed significantly greater deviation from observed
values when compared to the three-periodic nucleotidebased models.
All the simpler Markov models chosen were nested
within the more complex models (Additional File 1,
Supplementary Figure S3), with the codon usage bias
model being the simplest and the fifth-order three-periodic Markov model being the most complex. Hence,
comparisons could be made between any two nested
models to infer how different oligonucleotide or codon
biases contributed to the predicted OSC frequency as
shown in Table 1.
OSC selection in genomes utilizing alternate genetic
codes

Some prokaryotes, such as the Entomoplasmatales and
Mycoplasmatales, utilize an alternate genetic code in
which UGA is not a stop codon [30]. Other genetic
codes with non-standard stop codons are also utilized in
mitochondrial genomes. We extended the analysis under
the second-order three-periodic Markov model to these
genomes with alternate genetic codes (Table 2) which
showed varying results. There was clear evidence for
OSC overrepresentation in the genomes of Mesoplasma
florum and Mycoplasma agalactiae, while OSC

Page 8 of 13

underrepresentation is present in the genome of Ureaplasma urealyticum. For the mitochondrial genomes,
the results are similar with a mix of OSC underrepresentation and overrepresentation among the various species. However, their small sizes and the small number of
genes limited the statistical significance of the results,
which illustrated that the present method is less useful
in the analysis of organeller and viral genomes.
Relationship between OSC overrepresentation and
optimal growth temperature

Prokaryotes included in our analysis were classified into
one of the following 4 categories: psychrophiles, mesophiles, thermophiles and hyperthermophiles. The degree
of OSC overrepresentation was found to correlate negatively with the optimal growth temperature of the
organism after correcting for the G+C% and AT skew of
the coding sequence (p = 3.97 × 10-5). The relationship
between OSC overrepresentation and optimal growth
temperature was also supported by stepwise variable
selection on the multiple linear regression model using
Akaike information criterion.

Discussion
Ever since the recognition of the reading frame in ribosomal translation of protein coding sequence, it has
been realized that off-frame stop codons play a role in
avoiding production of erroneous protein products. At
the very least, erroneous peptides resulted from frameshift have reduced function or be entirely non-functional, and consume precious cellular resources; and in
the worst case, they may be toxic and interfere with
normal cellular metabolism. Hence, it is natural to postulate that OSCs would be selected for in the course of
genome evolution. An increase in the occurrences of
OSCs results in more truncations of the erroneous peptides due to frameshifts, and leads to less metabolic
wastage and potentially less toxic products. In agreement with this line of reasoning, there is empirical evidence that protein production increases with the
number of OSCs in the coding gene [31].
Our study is divided into two main parts. Firstly, we
showed that GC bias in the coding sequences is the primary determinant of OSC frequencies, consistent with
the results of a smaller study [12]. Furthermore, with a
lone exception, individual OSC biases are also primarily
determined by the G+C content of the coding
sequences. Hence, these results establish the need to
account for the effect of nucleotide compositional bias
on OSC frequencies. In the second part of the study, we
investigated the effects of higher order compositional
biases, like dinucleotide, hexanucleotide and dicodon
biases, that have been recognized in genomes previously
[32-35]. Markov modeling provides a straightforward

and natural way of describing these biases and hence
allow for the estimation of the effects of the different
biases on OSC frequencies. Perhaps the biggest advantage of Markov modeling in the context of this study is
the ease with which nested models could be developed
and compared. These models would have been more
complicated to implement using previous approaches
like k-mer shuffling [36] or odds ratio of word counts
[22]. The generation of random genomes under different
models greatly facilitates the study of a wide range of
genomic features in relation to the underlying

compositional biases, and the flexibility of the approach
is only limited by the computational expense of the
associated Monte Carlo method.
The selection of Markov models examined represents a
balance of biological relevance and statistical considerations. Markov models with orders of six or above were not
examined in the present analysis due to the limited size of
prokaryotic genomes resulting in insufficient sample sizes
for parameter estimation. Furthermore, except for special
cases like palindromic sequences, it is uncertain whether
any biological mechanism exists to produce such a high-

order oligonucleotide bias. The same argument applies to
the codon-based Markov models. At the other end of the
spectrum, Markov models simpler than second-order
nucleotide-based models reflect only simple nucleotide
composition or dinucleotide bias and could not account
for the absence of in-frame stop codons. The choice of
second- and fifth-order nucleotide-based three-periodic
Markov models as used in the present study is not arbitrary. Previous work in applying Markov models to gene
prediction have shown them to be the most useful models
for describing protein coding sequences [37,38], and are
important in the majority of current gene prediction
programs.

The results of the present study supported the general
presence of selection for OSC in prokaryotic genomes,
with more than 93% of examined genomes clearly showing OSC overrepresentation under the nucleotide-based
Markov models. In further support for the ambush
hypothesis, the magnitude of OSC overrepresentation is
found to be significantly correlated with G+C content.
The results showed that genomes with higher G+C content tend to have a higher degree of OSC overrepresentation. As the same genomes have less OSCs as shown
in the first part of the study, the increased OSC overrepresentation might well be a compensatory mechanism
to boost the number of OSCs. This observation

highlighted a previously overlooked aspect of the
ambush hypothesis – the selection for OSCs can occur
simultaneously at multiple levels and there exists a complex layer of interaction among them.
On the other hand, the magnitude of OSC overrepresentation was found to be quite modest, and does not
exceed 6% in the most pronounced case. However,
before dismissing the practical significance of the effect,
it should be reminded that the present calculations were
done on a per genome basis. Taking the case of Yersinia
enterocolitica as an example, OSC overrepresentation of
around 0.64 per 1000 codons in its 4.6 MB genome
would translate to an excess of over 800 OSCs. Even a
weak selection of OSCs can sometimes produce unexpected and significant effects in the phenotype, as exemplified by the recent discovery of a positive association
between numbers of mitochondrial OSCs and the accuracy of vertebrate morphogenetic development [39]. In
our results, OSC overrepresentation is negatively correlated with optimal growth temperature of the organism
in general. We hypothesize that low temperatures may
promote non-specific binding of transcriptional or initiation factors to incorrect sites and thus confer a selectional advantage to a greater abundance of OSCs. While
there is insufficient data to indicate that translational or
transcriptional error rates are elevated in low temperatures, we note that our proposed mechanism shares
conceptual and functional similarities with the arrest of
initiation factor-dependent translation initiation
mediated by the cold shock response [40].
Our results provide a picture of OSC selection averaged over the whole genome. As the probability and
adverse effects associated with frameshift occurrences
may vary with individual genes, so will the “selection
pressure” to incorporate additional OSCs into its coding
sequence. Thus, it is possible that excess OSCs are not
evenly distributed but more concentrated in a subset of
genes, in which they may exert a pronounced effect
against frameshift peptide translation. Logically, genes
with frameshift-prone slippage regions such as homopolymeric tracts [41] would benefit most from excess
OSCs. Alternatively, it may be possible that highly
expressed genes would also be under selection for more
OSCs, as the absolute number of errors would increase
with greater transcription and translation activity. While
the uneven distribution of OSCs in the genes and genomes was not explored in the present study, we calculated the ratio of OSCs in the +2 and +3 frames, which
showed significant variation among the different genomes and could not be fully explained by the genomic
G+C content as shown in figure 2. With respect to the
importance of the physical distribution of OSCs, the
concept of the “tri-frame model” and its application of
the ribosome occupancy distribution may provide a

Page 11 of 13

useful framework for understanding the uneven distribution of OSCs with respect to reducing mistranslation
and modulating gene expression [42].
The diversity of results from the detailed analysis on
selected genomes is useful in showing that codon or
dipeptide biases alone could not explain the near-universal observation of OSC overrepresentation in prokaryotic genomes. We notice that the expected OSC
frequencies under the dicodon bias model closely match
the actually observed freqencies, suggesting that dicodon
bias may play an important part in affecting OSC occurrences. However, there appears to be exceptions, like
Pyrococcus furiosus, for which the dicodon bias model
failed to model the observed OSC frequency (Table 1).
A related observation is that the simpler models appear
inadequate in describing the compositional biases in the
coding sequences. For example, the zeroth-order codonbased Markov model assumed complete independence
of each codon from its neighbors, thus implying the
absence of dinucleotide or other compositional biases
across codon boundaries. Hence, the presence of biologically inaccurate assumptions renders the model irrelevant for comparison. Since the above results have
largely ruled out the role of the lower-order compositional biases, another prime candidate for contributing
to the OSC overrepresentation is local synonymous
codon usage. This possibility could not be confirmed
with the current methods and deserve exploration in
future studies.
Maintenance of the reading frame of a coding
sequence is a complex and error-prone process. During
the transfer of genetic information from DNA to protein, errors resulting in frameshifts may occur during
DNA replication, mRNA transcription and ribosomal
translation. It is also possible that some errors may arise
from DNA and RNA mutations, that may occur spontaneously or be induced by mutagens. To minimize the
metabolic impact of these errors, the cell has several
layers of defense. Firstly, the relevant cellular processes
have been highly optimized to avoid the errors in the
first place. For example, higher fidelity of DNA replication could be achieved with the use of proofreading
DNA polymerase. Next, if errors had nonetheless
occurred, the appropriate response mechanisms will be
engaged. Damaged DNA may be recognized and corrected with the cellular DNA repair machinery while
translational frameshifts may be reduced with frameshift
suppressor tRNAs. Finally, the cell possesses a certain
degree of metabolic robustness to resist the negative
effects of these errors, such as the presence of alternative metabolic pathways. In this framework, the selection
of OSCs in coding sequences could be considered a passive second layer of defense against frameshift errors. It
is uncertain if there is greater selective pressure against

Tse et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:491
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/491

transcriptional than translational frameshifts, given that
the effect of OSCs is identical in both cases. A related
mechanism identified to play a similar role in potentially
reducing mistranslation errors is the selection on
codon-pair context during gene evolution to maximize
mRNA decoding fidelity by optimizing translational efficiency [43]. This effect would be independent of and
additive to that provided by OSCs.
As a final note, we would like to explore the differences between the present results and those from a
previous study [17]. In that study, the authors examined the preferred and avoided dicodons in different
genomes and noted that some avoided dicodons allows
for out-of-frame UAA/UAG stop codons (but not
UGA stop codons) in alternate reading frames. However, to put their findings in perspective, we noticed
that the set of preferred dicodons also included dicodons that encode such OSCs, and no calculations were
performed to confirm whether the net effect of the
dicodon bias actually decreased OSC frequencies.
Thus, there was no direct demonstration of OSC
avoidance in the genomes. More importantly, by calculating the odds ratio of dicodon frequencies based on
the constituent codon frequencies, they have shown
only the effect of dicodon bias on overall OSC frequencies and not the actual difference between
observed and expected OSC frequencies. For instance,
our analysis on Laribacter hongkongensis strain HLHK9
[44] (Table 1) revealed OSC overrepresentation in its
genome though its dicodon bias actually decreased the
OSC abundance relative to its codon usage and dipeptide biases. Hence, it is clear that the results from the
previous study are not sufficiently informative in the
investigation of OSC selection in genomes.

Conclusions
We have presented the largest and most comprehensive study to date of OSCs in prokaryotic genomes
using Markov models and the Monte Carlo method.
Results showed widespread overrepresentation of OSCs
and the degree of overrepresentation increases with G
+C content of the coding sequence. The latter observation is postulated to be a compensatory mechanism to
make up for the decrease of OSC frequency with G+C
content. Taken together, the findings of the study provided evidence in support of selection for OSCs at the
genomic level, in agreement with the ambush hypothesis which stated that OSCs can reduce the metabolic
cost associated with unintended frameshift events.
