Abstract
Background: The repABC plasmid family, which is extensively present within Alphaproteobacteria,
and some secondary chromosomes of the Rhizobiales have the particular feature that all the
elements involved in replication and partitioning reside within one transcriptional unit, the repABC
operon. Given the functional interactions among the elements of the repABC operon, and the fact
that they all reside in the same operon, a common evolutionary history would be expected if the
entire operon had been horizontally transferred. Here, we tested whether there is a common
evolutionary history within the repABC operon. We further examined different incompatibility
groups in terms of their differentiation and degree of adaptation to their host.
Results: We did not find a single evolutionary history within the repABC operon. Each protein had
a particular phylogeny, horizontal gene transfer events of the individual genes within the operon
were detected, and different functional constraints were found within and between the Rep
proteins. When different repABC operons coexisted in the same genome, they were well
differentiated from one another. Finally, we found different levels of adaptation to the host genome
within and between repABC operons coexisting in the same species.
Conclusion: Horizontal gene transfer with conservation of the repABC operon structure provides
a highly dynamic operon in which each member of this operon has its own evolutionary dynamics.
In addition, it seems that different incompatibility groups present in the same species have different
degrees of adaptation to their host genomes, in proportion to the amount of time the
incompatibility group has coexisted with the host genome.

Background
The repABC plasmids are a typical genome component of
many Alphaproteobacteria species. In fact, more than 20
Alphaproteobacteria species have at least one repABC plas-

mid (see refs [1,2] for recent reviews), these repABC plasmids may be the commonest plasmids in
Alphaproteobacteria species. In some species these repABC
plasmids constitute a significant amount of the bacterial

genome; such is the case of Rhizobium leguminosarum
3841, in which repABC plasmids account for 35% of the
genome [3]. This plasmid family includes several incompatibility groups, meaning that more than one type of
repABC plasmid can reside in the same bacterial species
[1,2]. For instance, Rhizobium etli CFN42 has 6 plasmids,
all of them repABC plasmids [4]. In contrast to other low
copy-number plasmids, in which the elements involved in
plasmid replication and segregation are located on different loci (each one under its own regulatory circuit), the
repABC plasmids contain all the elements required for
replication and partition within the repABC operon. In
general, this transcriptional unit comprises three proteinencoding genes (repA, repB, and repC) and a gene encoding a small antisense RNA (ctRNA) [5], which is located
within the repB-repC intergenic region. The proteins
encoded in the repABC operon have an intricate relationship, with RepA and RepB interacting both with themselves and with each other. These proteins, in conjunction
with the centromere-like sequence, parS, function as the
plasmid's segregation machinery [1,2,6]. On one hand,
RepA is a transcriptional repressor of the operon, while
RepB acts as its co-repressor by contacting the operator
sequence. The third protein-encoding gene of the operon,
repC, is essential for plasmid replication; it encodes the
initiator protein, RepC, which exerts its function by binding the origin of replication located within its own coding
sequence [1,2,6]. Taking these observations into account,
it is reasonable to hypothesize that the repABC operon is
under concerted evolutionary pressures aimed at maintaining its functionality and avoiding incompatibility
with other repABC operons. Remarkably, this operon is
not only the replication system of repABC plasmids, but of
some secondary chromosomes of some Rhizobiales species. For instance, the second chromosomes of Agrobacterium vitis S4 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 have a
repABC origin of replication [7].
At the structural level, the various repABC operons are
only superficially homogeneous; they are highly diverse
in DNA sequence, and some possess specific structural
elements shared only by few members of the family. These
distinctive elements fall into three types: (a) the number
and class of regulatory elements involved in operon transcription; (b) the number and position of centromere-like
sequences (parS sequences); and (c) the presence of peptide-encoding minigenes [1]. Several Alphaproteobacteria
genomes possess repAB genes that are not in close association with the ctRNA or repC sequences. However, it has
been shown that replication of some Alphaproteobacteria
plasmids depends only on RepC and a ctRNA, without the
involvement of the repAB genes. This suggests that fusion
of different modules could participate in the generation of
new repABC plasmids, indicating that the different ele-

ments may have experienced different evolutionary histories.
Plasmid stability requires an exquisite balance among all
of the interacting molecules involved in plasmid replication and segregation. Perturbation of this balance, for
example by the introduction of any replication or segregation element in excess, could lead to plasmid incompatibility. It has been shown that repABC plasmids contain at
least four elements involved in plasmid incompatibility:
the RepA and RepB proteins, the small antisense RNA, and
the parS sequences [6,8-10]. Phylogenies made with RepA,
RepB, and RepC proteins have shown that different replicons residing in the same bacterial strain tend to belong to
different clades [11]. Other study found that phylogenetic
analyses of repABC gene lineages had a lack of evolutionary congruence with the species tree [7]. These observations suggest that divergent evolution followed by
episodes of horizontal transfer have played a central role
in originating new incompatibility groups. We might
therefore expect that incompatibility groups residing in
the same genome would be different enough so as to not
interfere with each other.
In this study, we analyzed three aspects of repABC operons. First, because it is known that repABC operon has
been horizontally transferred, through phylogenetic analyses, we examined horizontal gene transfer of entire
operon versus horizontal transfer of individual genes
within this operon. This is a key point, since a previous
study has shown that some bacterial operons present horizontal gene transfer events that affect not the entire operons but single genes within the operons [12]. Second, we
determined the degree of differentiation among repABC
operons from different plasmids residing in the same
strain (which implies different incompatibility groups).
Third, we established the degree of evolutionary adaptedness among different repABC operons coexisting in a single species. In principle, because all the elements of the
partition and replication systems are contained in the
same operon and the encoded proteins interact, these elements might be expected to present almost the same history. Contrary to this, we found significantly different
histories for the various elements of the repABC operon.
Moreover, we detected different selective constraints
among the elements composing the operon, and even
within individual components. As expected, when different incompatibility groups coexisted in a species, these
groups were clearly differentiated from one another.
Finally, we found different levels of adaptation to the host
genome within and between repABC operons coexisting in
the same species.

Results
The collection of homologous repABC operons
To date, at least 81 repABC operons have been recognized
across the class Alphaproteobacteria [1]. Because we wanted
to utilize only homologous groups with the same domain
structure, we established strict criteria for defining homologous rep genes and operons (see Methods). As a result of
this, we analyzed only 49 operons herein (see Additional
file 1). Twenty-one genomes had at least one repABC
operon, and most of the operons were located on plasmids. A few genomes, such as those from genera Brucella
and Agrobacterium, had repABC operons located on replicons that are considered secondary chromosomes (see
Additional file 1). Two Rhizobium species, R. etli CFN42
and R. leguminosarum 3841, had the highest number of
repABC operons, with seven operons each. All plasmids
from these species had a single operon, with the exceptions of plasmid p42f from R. etli CFN42 and plasmid
pRL11 from R. leguminosarum 3841, which each had two
operons per plasmid. We also found six faulty operons
that were missing one of the three protein-encoding
genes; five out of six were composed of repA and repB

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/536

genes, while the remaining one consisted of repA and
repC. In four of six cases, the faulty operons coexisted with
complete operons. In many species only one gene was
present; by far the most widely distributed gene was repA,
followed by repC (see Additional file 1).
There is no a single history for the repABC operon
Our first goal was to test whether the elements of the
repABC operon have a common evolutionary history. A
single history would be expected if the entire operon had
been transferred; on the opposite, if the individual genes
were transferred, several histories would be expected.
Given that the partition and replication elements functionally interact with each other and compose a single
transcriptional unit, we expected to find a single history a
priori. To test this possibility, we constructed individual
Bayesian phylogenies for each protein, and used the phylogenies to construct a strict consensus tree. We obtained
phylogenies with strong support, but no two phylogenies
gave the same topology (see Figure 1). For example, when
we considered the phylogenies for RepA and RepC, only
five nodes out of 40 achieved a posterior probability

below 0.95 (see Figure 1). There was a large degree of conflict among the individual phylogenies, as demonstrated
by the fact that the strict consensus tree had many polytomies and was poorly resolved (Figure 2). Only 25% of the
nodes composing each phylogeny were shared among the
three phylogenies. Since confidence sets of genes trees
have been used to compare competing gene trees [13], we
used this method to examine whether the differences
among the phylogenies of RepA, RepB, and RepC were
more than would be expected by chance (see Methods).
The individual alignments of each protein rejected all but
its own phylogeny, indicating that the phylogenies of the
different proteins were significantly different from each
other. Therefore, horizontal gene transfer has affected the
individual genes within the operon. Actually each gene
has had many unique horizontal gene transfer events
since protein alignments rejected all but its own phylogeny. Here we will describe the positions of a couple plas-

mids in the rep phylogenies to make this clear. First
example, the proteins coded by genes of the repABC
operon located on plasmid pXAUT01 of Xanthobacter
autotrophicus occupy drastically different positions in all 3
phylogenies (see Figure 1, green arrows). Actually, in each
rep phylogeny pXAUT01 clusters with distinct groups,
with very good support in every case. In other example,
the horizontal gene transfer has affected either 2 of the
genes or one gene, as 2 phylogenies agree while the third
disagrees; for example, whereas the plasmids pSymA and
pSMED02 cluster with pOANT01, in RepA and RepB phylogenies, plasmid pOANT01 does not cluster with the
other 2 in RepC phylogeny (see Figure 1, red squares). The
horizontal gene transfer events that have affected the rep
genes are very particular, as they did not disrupt the
operon structure. Gene displacement in situ is the most
probable process behind this observation given that the
operon is conserved in all the cases. As expected, the phy-

logenies for RepA and RepB, whose genes are next to each
other, were more alike to one another than to RepC, as the
Robison-Fould distance (a metric used to compare phylogenies, in which increasing distance indicates increasing
disparity between phylogenies) between the phylogenies
of RepA and RepB was smaller than that between RepC
and either RepA or RepB (see Additional file 2). Since the
evolutionary distance within the RepA, RepB, and RepC
phylogenies is not that vast (see Figure 1), we checked if
in situ gene displacement occurred by means of homologous recombination. To see if this might be the case here,
we performed recombination analyses on the DNA alignments. In all three genes we found evidence of recombination, pairwise identity plots of the localized
recombination events are presented in Additional file 3.
We identified one event for repA, two for repB, and up to
four for repC (see Additional files 3 and 4). The above
results suggest that in situ gene displacement within the
operon, through homologous recombination, has
affected the repABC operon.
Different levels of functional restriction within and
between Rep proteins
The most common method for modeling the variation of
evolutionary rates among sites is the gamma distribution.
Its shape parameter, α, determines the extent of rate variation among sites; a small α represents extreme rate variation, while a large α value represent a minor variation in
rate [14]. Given that the main reason for the heterogeneity
of evolutionary rates among sites seems to be differences
in their selective constraints (due to the functional and/or
structural requirements of the gene), we herein used the
shape parameter α as a proxy for the functional restriction
of each studied protein. In addition, we used the total
length of each phylogeny as a proxy to examine the level
of protein conservation. Among the three studied proteins, RepA showed the lowest total phylogenetic length
and the highest among-site rate variation (reflected
through the smallest shape parameter α), indicating that
RepA was the most conserved protein, and that it experienced the highest level of functional restriction. The confidence intervals of the total length of the RepA
phylogenies did not overlap with those of the two other

phylogenies (see Table 1). Interestingly, the among-site
rate variation was not significantly different between
RepA and RepC, but the among-site rate variations of
these two proteins were significantly different from that of
RepB (see Table 1, shape parameter α column). Therefore,
although RepA was the most conserved protein, RepA and
RepC had similar levels of functional restriction.
To assess functional restriction inside the proteins, we
next identified domains using Pfam [15], and assigned
substitutions rates for individual sites for each protein
using a discrete-gamma distribution (see Methods). We
found that different domains had different substitution
rates. For instance, in RepA protein, the ATPase domain
almost did not have positions with highest substitution
rates (see Figure 3, dotted lines, family MipZ), whereas the
nucleotide-binding domain did have positions with the
highest substitution rates (see Figure 3, domain CbiA).
Similarly, most of the sites in the ParB-like nuclease
domain of RepB (see Figure 3, dotted lines, family ParBc)
had substitution rates that were smaller than those of the
plasmid partition family domain (see Figure 3, family
RepB). Only one domain was identified for RepC, but the
substitution rates of its sites varied (Additional file 5).
Notably, whereas RepA (the most conserved protein) was
affected by a recombination event within its more variable
domain (see Figure 3, Recombination, upper panel),
RepB seems to have been affected by recombination
throughout its sequence (see Figure 3, Recombination,
lower panel). Thus, we detected different levels of functional restriction not only between the studied proteins,
but also within them.
Well differentiated incompatibility groups
We used Rhizobium etli CFN42 and Rhizobium leguminosarum 3841 to compare and contrast incompatibility
groups, because these strains each harbored six repABC
compatible plasmids (i.e., six incompatibility groups). We
made four DNA alignments, one for each rep gene and
one for the intergenic region between the repB and repC
genes, which encodes a small antisense RNA gene that acts
as a strong incompatibility factor. To evaluate the degree
of distinction among the rep genes and intergenic region

repB. Notably, the intergenic region comprised the shortest distance, but did not have any invariant position (see
Table 2). Moreover, this locus had the highest among-site
rate variation, as reflected in the smallest shape parameter
α (see Table 2). This suggests that the intergenic region is
under higher functional restriction compared to the rep
genes; this finding is compatible with the presence of the
small antisense RNA-encoding sequence in the intergenic
region. Neither the intergenic region nor the rep genes
showed any evidence of recombination. These results suggest that there was a high degree of differentiation among
the examined incompatibility groups.

the extent to which selection has been effective in molding the pattern of codon usage [16], and compare the
codon usage of foreign genes versus that of highly
expressed native genes. Here, we used the CAI to assess the
adaptation of the repA, repB, and repC genes to their host
genomes. We first calculated the relative synonymous
codon usage values of highly expressed native genes
(those encoding ribosomal proteins from each species),
and then used CAI to compare the codon usage of the
repA, repB, and repC genes to those of the reference genes
(see Methods). CAI values can range from 0 (reflecting
equal use of synonymous codons) to 1 (reflecting the
strongest bias, codon usage is equal to that in the reference ribosomal protein-encoding genes). We found a
clear trend in the CAI values within and between the studied repABC operons. In general, repA genes had the highest
CAI values, followed by repB genes (see Figure 4). The
repABC operons located on different plasmids had different CAI values, with those located on plasmids appearing
to be the newest (e.g., p42a and p42d in R. etli CFN42, see
Discussion) having the smallest CAI values (see Figure 4,

Codon Adaptation Index as a measure of evolutionary
adaptedness
The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) is a simple measure of
synonymous codon usage bias. This index uses a reference
set of highly expressed genes to assess the relative merits
of every codon, and then determines a score for the gene
or genes in question based on the use frequency of all
codons in that gene [16]. The CAI can be used to evaluate

red circles). Notably, in plasmids harboring two repABC
operons, one always failed to meet the abovementioned
pattern of CAI stratification. For example, plasmid pRL7
from R. leguminosarum 3841 contained the pRL7.1 and
pRL7.2 operons, and the former had a higher CAI value
for repB than repA (see Figure 4, green squares). Given that
the degree of codon bias in unicellular organisms correlates with the level of gene expression, our results suggest
that repA is more highly expressed than the other two
genes, and repB is expressed at a higher level than repC.
Furthermore, it seems that the different operons have different levels of expression.

Discussion
The repABC operon is not only important because it is the
replication-partition system of repABC plasmids, a common component of Alphaproteobacteria species, but
because it is also the replication-partition system of some
secondary chromosomes in Alphaproteobacteria species.
Our present analyses functioned at two levels: within the
repABC operon and between repABC operons in those
cases where several repABC operons coexisted in the same
genome. We did not find a single history within the
repABC operon; clearly, each protein had its own phylogeny. This is somewhat surprising, since repA, repB, and
repC form an operon, and it would seem that they should
have similar histories if the entire operon had been horizontally transferred. Instead, even RepA and RepB, which
compose the partition system and physically interact, had
different phylogenies. This contrast with a recent work in
which relaxase sequences were used as tools for classification of conjugative systems. In that study it was found that
relaxases and the IV coupling proteins (T4CP), which map
next to each other and belong to a minimal gene set that
allows plasmid to be conjugally transmitted, evolve congruently for long periods of time [17]. Thus, it seems that
compared with some elements of the transfer machinery
the repABC replication-partition system is highly diverse.
Quite notably, every single gene of this operon presented
evidence of horizontal gene transfer. In situ gene displacement is a likely process behind this, since the structure of
the repABC operon is completely conserved. We think in
situ gene displacement could have occurred through
homologous recombination, as we found homologous
recombination events across the 3 rep genes. Although in
situ gene displacement appears unlikely, there is evidence
that shows that this process is not that scarce.
Omelchenko et al found that within the bacterial operons
they had analyzed in situ gene displacement was a frequent event [12]. A striking difference between in situ gene
displacement and other types of horizontal gene transfer
events is that the former leaves intact the operon structure,
so that, the operon is completely functional.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/536

The proteins differed not only at the topological level, but
also at the level of functional restriction. RepA and RepC,
which belong to different systems, were under similar levels of functional restriction, suggesting that key elements
of the partitioning and replication systems are under similar functional restrictions. In contrast, RepB had a very
different level of functional restriction. We also found different levels of functional restrictions within proteins. For
example, the ATPase domain of RepA (Figure 3, family
MipZ), which forms a complex with the chromosome partitioning protein and is indispensable for partitioning,
presented the lowest substitution rates. As well the only
recombination event presented in repA did not affect the
ATPase domain but a relatively unconserved part of the
gene. Therefore, it seems that the different proteins, and
even the different parts of the proteins themselves, are
under different functional and/or structural constraints.
Of the three genes studied, repA was the most conserved
and might have the highest expression level. This is not
unexpected, as RepA is known to have several functions,
and its expression is required in both the presence and
absence of partition, suggesting the need for high-level
translation in order to maintain sufficient RepA levels. In
contrast, repC, which is a replication initiator protein, had
the lowest CAI values, perhaps due to the higher levels of
homologous recombination in this gene (see below).
Horizontal gene transfer could be very important in
allowing the variability of this operon. Indeed, if horizontal gene transfer had not affected the genes within the
operon, these genes would have to have a single evolutionary history. Instead, we found that the reverse was
true. The proteins encoded in those genes not only presented different phylogenies, they also had different functional restrictions, even within the proteins themselves,
and the CAI values differed among the genes. Given the
presence of differences at several levels, it is very logical to
think that horizontal gene transfer has unconnected the
various portions of the operon, allowing each part to have
a particular evolutionary history. In this way, genes with
very different functional restrictions could be located next
to each other, as seen for repB and repA.
The existence of multiple repABC operons located on different replicons in the same genome implies the presence
of different incompatibility groups. We herein showed
that when multiple repABC operons coexisted in the same
genome, they were well differentiated from one another.
We did not find evidence of homologous recombination
in these cases; this is not unexpected, since homologous
recombination would homogenize the sequences, meaning that the different groups would no longer be compatible with each other. The intergenic region, which encodes
a small antisense RNA (a very important determinant for
incompatibility), was highly conserved and found to be
under high functional restriction, yet it did not have any

invariant sites. Although this sequence has changed only
minimally due to functional restrictions, it has still accumulated sufficient changes to allow the coexistence of the
different incompatibility groups. In agreement with our
within-operon analysis, repA and repC were highly conserved, with repC being the most highly conserved
between operons (it had the smallest average distance). As
mentioned above, repC also had the most homologous
recombination events. This suggests that homologous
recombination might be reducing the divergence of repC,
potentially also explaining the low CAI values for this
gene (homologous recombination would be erasing any
improvement in the CAI values). In a report on the
genome sequence of R. leguminosarum, Young and coworkers suggested that a recent recombination event had
taken place, and divergence of RepC was not critical for
plasmid compatibility [3]. Here, one of the recombination events detected in repC involved the sequence from
pRL8, which is a plasmid of R. leguminosarum 3841.
Different repABC operons had distinct levels of adaptation
to their host genome, with no two repABC operons presenting the same CAI values. We think that amelioration
might be playing a role in the adaptation of repABC operons to their hosts. Plasmids p42a and p42d were suggested to be newly acquired plasmids based on their lower
GC values, poor conservation, and poor functional connectivity with the rest of the genome [4]. These two plasmids had the worst CAI values, implying that they are not
well adapted to their host's genome. In contrast, the
operon from p42f, which appeared to be the oldest plasmid harbored within R. etli CFN42, had the highest CAI
values, suggesting that this operon is highly adapted.
These findings indicate that the longer a repABC operon
coexists with its host genome, the more adapted the
operon becomes. This may result in more effective replication and partitioning processes. As well plasmids, which
had the most adapted operons, presented essential genes
as well; for instance plasmids pRL11, pRL12, and pRL10,
which all have essential genes [3], had the operons with
higher CAI values than the rest of plasmid of R. leguminosarum 3841.

Conclusion
In summary, we herein report finding different histories
and functional constraints within the repABC operon. In
addition, when multiple repABC operons were present in
the same genome, they had different levels of adaptedness
to the host genome, and this seems to be related to the
length of time each operon had been associated with the
host genome. Finally, horizontal gene transfer with conservation of the operon structure provides a highly
dynamic operon in which each member could have its
own evolutionary dynamics.

Methods
Detection of homologous genes and operons
We first identified the homologous of the RepA, RepB,
and RepC proteins across the known Alphaproteobacteria
genomes (see Additional file 6). The RepA, RepB, and
RepC proteins from symbiotic plasmids of R. etli CFN42
and S. meliloti 1021 were used as seeds, and were queried
against the proteomes encoded by the other genomes
(Additional file 6), using BLAST [18] with an E-value cutoff of 1.0e-12. We retained all cases where a seed protein
had a hit in any other proteome and the proteins aligned
along at least 70% of their lengths. We then selected for
DNA sequences wherein repA was next to repB, and repB
was next to repC (by definition, the only gene between
repA and repC was repB), this was taken as a complete
operon. The homologous protein groups contained only
proteins whose genes formed complete operons. For each
homologous protein group, we constructed an alignment
with MUSCLE [19], and used this alignment to infer a
phylogeny (see below). To generate the DNA alignments
of repA, repB, and repC, we used their protein alignments
as references, and performed nucleotide alignment using
the "tranalign" program from The European Molecular
Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) [20]. The recombination analysis was carried out on these DNA alignments.

Other sets of DNA alignments were created for each of the
operons contained in R. etli CFN42 and R. leguminosarum
3841. The intergenic region between repB and repC was
also considered. We then used jModelTest [21] to carry
out statistical selection of the best-fit models of nucleotide
substitution for every DNA alignment. Finally, maximum
likelihood distance matrices were inferred using the
model specifications from jModelTest; this was done with
PUZZLE [22].
Phylogenetic Analysis
Phylogenies were created using MrBayes v3.1.2 [23],
allowing the MCMC sampler to explore all of the fixedrated amino acid models included in MrBayes. The
number of rate categories for gamma distributions was set
to four, with a proportion of sites allowed to be invariable. We performed two runs with four chains each, for
5,000,000 generations. Trees were sampled every 1000
generations, 20% of all generations were removed as
burn-in, and a consensus tree was taken. We also estimated the best amino acid models, including the amino
acid matrices with the highest posterior probability, estimates of the proportion of invariable sites, and estimates
of the gamma shape parameter.

A strict consensus tree was created from all three Bayesian
phylogenies, using CONSENSE [24].

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:536

We established the similarities of the phylogenies using
the Robinson and Fould distance (RFd), as calculated with
TREEDIST [24].
We used confidence sets to assess whether the differences
in topology between the individual Bayesian phylogenies
exceeded those expected to occur by chance. We used
expected likelihood weighting [13], which provides a simple and intuitive method for making multiple comparisons of models and constructing the corresponding
confidence sets. This test has the benefit of being less conservative than the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [13]. The
topologies tested included those from the RepA, RepB,
and RepC phylogenies. PUZZLE [22] was used to carry out
this test for each protein alignment.
Recombination analysis
Although methods that use the substitution patterns or
incompatibilities among sites seem be the most powerful
strategy for identifying the presence of recombination
events, no single method seems to perform optimally
under all different scenarios [25]. Thus, the best strategy is
often to use a combination of methods. Here, we used the
RDP3 program [26], which implements a number of
methods for identifying recombination events, including
GENECONV [27], RDP [26], MaxChi [28], Chimera [28],
SisCan [29], and Bootscanning [30]. We identified a
recombination event as valid when at least three of the six
methods indicated positive findings.
Functional regions and among-site rate variation in Rep
proteins
We identified the various protein domains by applying
the Pfam-A component of Pfam [15]. For this analysis, the
RepA, RepB, and RepC proteins of symbiotic plasmid
p42d from R. etli CFN42 were queried against Pfam-A. For
every position of each protein alignment, a substitution
rate was assigned using a discrete-gamma distribution.
The discrete-gamma distribution used five rate classes and
was implemented through PUZZLE.
Codon Adaptation Index as measure of evolutionary
adaptedness
This analysis was done only for the repA, repB, and repC
genes located on operons found within species R. etli
CFN42 and R. leguminosarum 3841. We used the utility
"cusp" from EMBOSS to calculate a codon usage table for
the genes encoding the ribosomal proteins in each species. Using these tables as a reference, we applied the "cai"
program of the EMBOSS suite to calculate Codon Adaptation Indices for the repA, repB, and repC genes.
