Abstract
Background: The bacterial Hfq protein is able to interact with diverse RNA molecules, including regulatory small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs), and thus it is recognized as a global post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression. Loss of Hfq
has an extensive impact in bacterial physiology which in several animal pathogens influences virulence. Sinorhizobium
meliloti is a model soil bacterium known for its ability to establish a beneficial nitrogen-fixing intracellular symbiosis
with alfalfa. Despite the predicted general involvement of Hfq in the establishment of successful bacteria-eukaryote
interactions, its function in S. meliloti has remained unexplored.
Results: Two independent S. meliloti mutants, 2011-3.4 and 1021Δhfq, were obtained by disruption and deletion of the
hfq gene in the wild-type strains 2011 and 1021, respectively, both exhibiting similar growth defects as free-living
bacteria. Transcriptomic profiling of 1021Δhfq revealed a general down-regulation of genes of sugar transporters and
some enzymes of the central carbon metabolism, whereas transcripts specifying the uptake and metabolism of
nitrogen sources (mainly amino acids) were more abundant than in the wild-type strain. Proteomic analysis of the
2011-3.4 mutant independently confirmed these observations. Symbiotic tests showed that lack of Hfq led to a
delayed nodulation, severely compromised bacterial competitiveness on alfalfa roots and impaired normal plant
growth. Furthermore, a large proportion of nodules (55%-64%) elicited by the 1021Δhfq mutant were non-fixing, with
scarce content in bacteroids and signs of premature senescence of endosymbiotic bacteria. RT-PCR experiments on
RNA from bacteria grown under aerobic and microoxic conditions revealed that Hfq contributes to regulation of nifA
and fixK1/K2, the genes controlling nitrogen fixation, although the Hfq-mediated regulation of fixK is only aerobiosis
dependent. Finally, we found that some of the recently identified S. meliloti sRNAs co-inmunoprecipitate with a FLAGepitope tagged Hfq protein.
Conclusions: Our results support that the S. meliloti RNA chaperone Hfq contributes to the control of central metabolic
pathways in free-living bacteria and influences rhizospheric competence, survival of the microsymbiont within the
nodule cells and nitrogen fixation during the symbiotic interaction with its legume host alfalfa. The identified S. meliloti
Hfq-binding sRNAs are predicted to participate in the Hfq regulatory network.
Background
Hfq is a ubiquitous and abundant bacterial protein which
assembles into ~12 kDa ring-shaped homohexamers that
resemble those formed by the Sm proteins of the eukaryotic
splicing complex [1,2]. It was originally identified in the
model bacterium Escherichia coli as a host factor essential

for Qβ RNA bacteriophage replication [3]. In uninfected
bacteria Hfq retains the ability to bind many mRNAs and
trans-acting antisense small non-coding regulatory RNAs
(sRNAs), thereby influencing, directly or indirectly, on the
stability and/or translation of functionally diverse RNA
molecules [4-6]. This variety of interactions place Hfq at a
crucial node in bacterial post-transcriptional regulatory networks underlying a wide range of cellular processes and
pathways [6-8]. Consequently, mutations in the hfq gene

were early observed to have a severe impact on bacterial
physiology resulting in alterations in growth rate, cell morphology and tolerance to harsh environments [9]. In several
enterobacteria and other facultative intracellular mammal
pathogens these deficiencies ultimately compromise virulence traits such as motility, host invasion or growth/survival in the intracellular niche [10-16]. The virulencerelated phenotypes of the hfq mutants have been shown to
be largely dependent on the deregulation of the membrane
homeostasis and RpoS- or RpoE-mediated stress response
pathways, which have been reported to involve the activity
of sRNAs in some of these pathogenic bacteria [15,17-19].
The α subdivision of the proteobacteria includes diverse
species which share the capacity to establish a variety of
long-term interactions with higher eukaryotes [20]. The
pleiotropic phenotype conferred by hfq mutations is also
common to all α-proteobacteria representatives in which the
Hfq function has been genetically addressed. For example,
in Brucella spp. the Hfq defective mutants showed osmosensitivity, reduction in the fitness of long-term cultures and
impaired survival into host macrophages, further supporting the relevant role of this protein in the establishment and
maintenance of chronic intracellular infections [21,22].
Besides its general contribution to stress adaptation Hfq has
been also shown to influence the nitrogen fixation process
in free-living (Rhodobacter capsulatus) and symbiotic
(Azorhizobium caulinodans and Rhizobium leguminosarum
bv. viciae) α-proteobacterial diazotrophs [23-26]. In these
microorganisms Hfq acts as a positive post-transcriptional
regulator of nifA, the gene encoding the major transcriptional activator of the genes coding for the nitrogenase
complex. However, in contrast to the situation in A. caulinodans Hfq is not essential for the diazotrophic growth of the
phototrophic purple bacterium R. capsulatus [24,25].
Sinorhizobium meliloti belongs to the group of α-proteobacterial species (collectively called rhizobia) able to
engage in symbioses with legume plants. The outcome of
these interactions is the formation of new specialized
organs within the host, the root nodules, where bacteria
undergo a process of profound morphological differentiation to their endosymbiotic form, the bacteroid. The nodules provide the microoxic environment demanded by the
rhizobial nitrogenases to catalyze the reduction of the
chemically inert atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia that
can be metabolized by the plant. The S. meliloti-Medicago
truncatula (sativa) symbiosis is a recognized tractable
model system for deciphering molecular mechanisms
employed by the infective rhizobia in their transition from a
free-living state in soil to their final residence within the
nodule cells [27,28]. Despite the emerging role of Hfq in
the establishment of successful prokaryote-eukaryote interactions, the functions of this RNA chaperone in α-proteobacteria, and in particular in the nitrogen-fixing
endosymbionts, have remained largely unexplored. None-

theless, a recent study has revealed the influence of Hfq on
the stability of known S. meliloti sRNAs, thus anticipating
the importance of this protein in sRNA-mediated regulatory
pathways in this model symbiotic bacterium [29]. Here, we
have determined global Hfq-dependent changes in gene
expression and protein accumulation coupled with the characterization of the symbiotic behavior of hfq knock-out
mutants to pinpoint the function of this RNA chaperone in
the alfalfa symbiont S. meliloti. We found that loss of hfq
alters growth and energy-producing carbon metabolic pathways in free-living bacteria, and severely compromises the
nodulation competitiveness and the efficiency of the symbiosis with alfalfa. Furthermore, we provide experimental
evidence of Hfq binding to some of the recently identified
S. meliloti sRNAs [30], which predicts that these molecules
could be major players in the rhizobial Hfq regulatory network.

Results
The S. meliloti hfq genomic region

The hfq gene corresponds to ORF SMc01048 (formerly
denoted as nrfA) of the S. meliloti genome project (http://
iant.toulouse.inra.fr/bacteria/annotation/cgi/rhime.cgi)
which has been annotated at bps 1577127-1577369 in the
chromosome of the reference strain 1021 [31]. It is predicted to encode an 80 amino acids-long polypeptide with
72% similarity and 45% identity to the well-characterized
E. coli Hfq protein and 77%-100% identity to its α-proteobacterial counterparts. A multiple amino acid sequence
alignment revealed that the conservation between the rhizobial and enterobacterial Hfq proteins is restricted to the predicted Sm1 and Sm2 motifs likely forming the RNAbinding pocket, whereas the enterobacterial genomes
encode a protein with a C-terminal extension (Fig. 1a).
The S. meliloti hfq gene seems to form a dicistronic
operon with the downstream hflX-like gene coding for a
putative GTP-binding protein. Upstream of hfq are
SMc01047 and trkA coding for a D-alanine aminotransferase and a potassium transporter, respectively (Fig. 1a).
Immediately upstream of trkA is the gene cluster specifying
the nitrogen assimilation system ntr (ntrB-ntrC-ntrY-ntrX).
This genomic arrangement is essentially conserved in all
the nitrogen-fixing endosymbionts of the order Rhizobiales.
The exception is the absence of either the trkA or
SMc01047 homologs between the ntr operon and hfq in a
few species (i.e. M. loti, R. leguminosarum bv. viciae). In
contrast, the S. meliloti hfq upstream region totally diverges
from that of its related intracellular animal pathogens (i.e.
Brucella sp.). Enterobacterial and α-proteobacterial
genomes only conserve the hflX gene downstream of hfq in
this chromosomal region.

Construction and growth characteristics of the S. meliloti
hfq mutants

As a first approach to address the S. meliloti Hfq functions
in vivo two independent hfq knock-out mutants were constructed in strains 2011 and 1021. These S. meliloti strains
are derived from the same progenitor (S. meliloti isolate
SU47) although they exhibit some phenotypic differences
in growth, induction of host gene expression or response to
phosphate starvation [32,33]. Nonetheless, partial sequence

and restriction analyses revealed that the 1021 and 2011 hfq
genomic regions are identical (data not shown).
A mutant (2011-3.4) and a control strain (2011-1.2) were
first generated in 2011 by disruption of hfq with the mobilizable suicide vector pK18mobsacB mediated by single
homologous recombination events. PCR amplification and
sequence analyses of the resulting mutant alleles revealed
that in 2011-3.4 pK18mobsacB disrupted the predicted Sm2
domain by inserting after nt 171 of the Hfq coding sequence

Torres-Quesada et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:71

(Fig. 1a). In 2011-1.2, plasmid integration was mapped to
nt 231 of the Hfq ORF, thus affecting the translation of the
non conserved last three amino acids of the protein (Fig.
1a). Both hfq strains formed colonies with wild-type morphology when grown in TY agar. However, the 2011-3.4
mutant exhibited a markedly slower growth than the strain
2011-1.2, which behaved as the wild-type 2011 strain on
plates (not shown). When grown in TY broth with aeration
no differences were observed between the wild-type 2011
strain and its derivative 2011-1.2 whereas the hfq insertion
mutant 2011-3.4 showed a delayed lag phase and reached
the stationary phase at lower optical density (Fig. 1b). This
new observation further supports that the reduced growth of
the 2011-3.4 strain was due to hfq inactivation rather than to
polar effects caused by pK18mobsacB integration. Furthermore, the plasmid pJBHfq expressing the hfq gene from its
own promoter fully complemented the growth phenotype of
the hfq insertion mutant.
A second mutant was constructed in the reference strain
1021 by pK18mobsacB-mediated double crossing over
resulting into a complete marker-free deletion of the Hfq
ORF (Fig. 1a). The growth phenotype on TY agar plates
previously observed in the 2011-3.4 hfq insertion mutant
was used as a reference to discriminate between the colonies corresponding to the 1021Δhfq strain and those of the
wild-type revertants after the second cross over event. A
Southern hybridization further confirmed the expected
genomic arrangement in the mutant (not shown). In liquid
TY medium the 1021Δhfq strain also exhibited reduced
growth rate which was complemented with plasmid pJBHfq
as expected (Fig. 1b).
Therefore, 2011-3.4 and 1021Δhfq mutants displayed
apparent indistinguishable free-living growth defects when
compared to their respective parent strains and they have
been combined in this study as independent genetic tools to
identify general rather than strain-specific Hfq functions in
S. meliloti.
Hfq-dependent alterations of the free-living S. meliloti
transcriptome and proteome

Hfq-dependent changes in transcript abundance were first
investigated by comparing the expression profiles of wildtype 1021 and 1021Δhfq strains grown to lag phase (OD600
0.5-0.6) on whole genome Sm14kOLI microarrays (see
http://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/transcriptomics/transcriptomics-facility/sm14koli.html for details on content
and layout of microarrays). Hybridization signals to oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the intergenic regions
were not analyzed further in this study. A total of 168 genes
(2.7% of the 6206 ORFs predicted in the S. meliloti 1021
genome) displayed at least 2-fold changes in their mRNA
levels (i.e. 1 ≤ M ≤ -1) and were catalogued as differentially
expressed in both strains (see additional file 1: differentially
accumulated transcripts in S. meliloti 1021 and 1021Δhfq

derivative strain; the microarray data described in this work
have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database under
accession number A-MEXP-1760). Of these, 91 were found
to be down-regulated and 77 up-regulated in the 1021Δhfq
mutant. Replicon distribution of the 168 Hfq-dependent
genes revealed that 103 (61%) were chromosomal and 65
had plasmid location; 45 (27%) in pSymA and 20 (12%) in
pSymB (Fig. 2, upper charts). Taking into account the gene
content of S. meliloti 1021 with 54% genes annotated in the
chromosome, 21% in pSymA and 24% located on pSymB,
this distribution showed a replicon bias in Hfq activity with
1.3-fold more impact than expected on pSymA-encoded
transcripts. The former observation is more evident when
looking at the location of genes scored as down-regulated in
the 1021Δhfq mutant; as many as 34 (37%) of these 91
down-regulated genes were pSymA-borne which is almost
1.8-fold more than expected for the ORF content of this
megaplasmid.
According to the S. meliloti 1021 genome sequence annotations (http://iant.toulouse.inra.fr/bacteria/annotation/cgi/
rhime.cgi)and the KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/
kegg/) 137 (82%) out of the 168 genes with altered expression in 1021Δhfq could be assigned to particular functional
categories, whereas 31 (18%) exhibited global or partial
homology to database entries corresponding to putative
genes with unknown function (Fig. 2, upper circle graph).
More than half of the genes with functional homology are
predicted to encode proteins and enzymes for the transport
(45 genes) and metabolism (39) of small molecules, mainly
sugars and amino acids, whereas the remaining 53 are
related to regulation of transcription (5 genes), electron
transport or nitrogen fixation (17; including the regulatory
genes fixK1/K2) and other cell processes (31) such as macromolecule or central intermediary metabolism. Within the
latter group several genes with a major role in translation
and cellular RNA/protein turnover were differentially regulated in the mutant; SMc01929 coding for RNAseJ,
SMc03796 encoding a putative endoribonuclease L-PSP
likely involved in mRNAs cleavage, SMa1126, degP4 and
degP1 annotated as determinants of different types of proteases, and rplS/rpmA both encoding ribosomal proteins.
All these genes except SMa1126 and degP4, were up-regulated in the mutant.
As an independent supporting approach to investigate the
Hfq function in S. meliloti the proteomic profiling of the
wild-type strain 2011 and its hfq mutant derivative 2011-3.4
was also determined. Analysis of 24 Coomassie-stained
2D-gels from bacteria grown on TY medium to lag phase
(OD600 0.5-0.8) revealed on average 293 spots of which 33
corresponded to individual polypeptides with reliable differential accumulation in the wild-type and mutant strains
(see additional file 2: differentially accumulated proteins in
S. meliloti 2011 wild-type and 2011-3.4 insertion mutant
derivative). Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) revealed

that 28 of these proteins are encoded in chromosomally
located genes, 4 in pSymB and only one in the pSymA
megaplasmid, thus confirming the major role of Hfq in regulating S. meliloti chromosomal traits (Fig. 2, lower charts).
Of these 33 proteins, 21 were over-represented and 12
under-represented in the 2011-3.4 mutant strain. Classification of the differentially expressed proteins according to the
S. meliloti 1021 and KEGG databases identified three main
functional categories; transport (12 proteins), small molecule metabolism (8) and chaperones and/or stress factors
(4) whereas the remaining 9 were catalogued either as
involved in translation (i.e. Tig trigger factor and Efp elongation factor P) or as hypothetical conserved proteins with
unpredicted function (7) (Fig. 2, lower circle graph).
Comparison of the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles
described in this study revealed an overlap of 9 genes identified as differentially expressed in hfq mutants and wildtype strains in both analyses. Their predicted encoded proteins are the periplasmic components of the ABC transporters of myo-inositol (IbpA), fructose (FrcB), α-glucosides
(AglE), amino acids (SMc02259), leucine (LivK) and Lamino acids (AapJ and AapP) as well as two enzymes
related to myo-inositol catabolism, IolE and IolD. Therefore, regardless the recognized phenotypic differences
between the 1021 and 2011 strains both approaches support
the general conclusion that Hfq has a major impact in the
regulation of transport and metabolism in S. meliloti.

Hfq influences central metabolic pathways in S. meliloti

Among the 91 genes found to be down-regulated in the hfq
deletion mutant, 40 (44%) are predicted to encode functions
for the uptake (14 genes) and metabolism (26 genes) of
small molecules with a major proportion related to the utilization of carbon substrates (Fig. 3, upper circle charts).
Eleven of these genes form part of operons encoding the
different components (i.e. the periplasmic-solute binding
protein, the permease or the ATP-binding protein) of the
ABC transporters for myo-inositol (ibpA, iatA and iatP
genes), α-glucosides (aglE and aglF), fructose (frcB and
frcK), ribose (SMc02031), glycerol (SMc02514 and
SMc02519), and other organic acids/alcohols (SMb20144)
[34]. An additional gene (SMb20072), displaying more than
32-fold reduction (M value -5.87) in transcript abundance
in the hfq mutant has been annotated as coding for a putative myo-inositol-induced periplasmic solute-binding protein [34]. However, it seems to be an independent
transcription unit, not clustered apparently with genes
related to sugar uptake. The remaining 2 down-regulated
transporter genes are likely involved in the uptake of glycine betaine (SMc04439) and iron (SMc04317). The predicted reduced efficiency in the import of primary carbon
substrates by the 1021Δhfq mutant was accompanied by the
down-regulation of 8 genes involved in sugar catabolism:
iolC, iolD, iolE and iolB integrating the operon for the utilization of myo-inositol, SMc01163 which encodes a putative
glucose-fructose oxidoreductase, SMc00982 likely encod-

ing a dioxygenase, and 2 putative alcohol dehydrogenaseencoding genes, adhA1 and SMa1156, predicted to be
involved in fermentation of carbon substrates. Lack of Hfq
also led to a reduction in the abundance of the SMa1227
transcript, which likely codes for a transcriptional regulator
of the Crp superfamily, some of which have been shown to
govern central carbon metabolic pathways in bacteria
through cAMP binding [35]. In addition to the down-regulation of genes of energy production pathways, some transcripts encoding components of the electron transfer chain
such as CycA, EtfA1 or SMa1170 (probable cytochrome c)
were less abundant in the mutant. Another set of down-regulated genes in the hfq deletion mutant includes those
involved in processes fuelled by sugar catabolism such as
the biosynthesis of amino acids (ilvC, SMc03211,
SMc03253, pheAa, mtbC, SMc02045 and glyA1), vitamins
(cobP, SMc04342) and purines/pyrimidines (purU1, pyrC).
This transcriptomic profiling predicts a physiological
state of bacteria demanding alternative nutrient sources to
support growth and macromolecule biosynthesis in the hfq
mutant. Indeed, our results also revealed that more than
50% of the transcripts with enhanced abundance in the
mutant as compared to the wild-type strain encode proteins
for the transport and catabolism of different N compounds.
Up-regulated transport genes have been shown or predicted
to be involved in the uptake of L-aminoacids or peptides
(aapJ, aapQ, aapP, oppB, oppC, SMc00140, SMc01597,

SMc02259, SMb21572, SMb20605), branched-chain aminoacids (livH, livM, livG, livF, livK), uracil/uridine
(SMc01823, SMc01824, SMc01825, SMc01827), sugar
amines (SMb21151) or other complex N substrates such as
the polyamines spermidine and putrescine (SMc01966,
SMc01965, SMc01963). Consequently, loss of hfq also
resulted in the up-regulation of an important set of genes
likely related to the utilization or modification of amino
acids and other N compounds. The transcripts corresponding to the 3 genes specifying the glycine cleavage system,
gcvP, gcvH and gcvT (M values 2.06, 2.02 and 3.32, respectively), and to SMc01930 (M value 3.26) encoding a putative methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase likely operating in the
catabolism of branched-chain amino acids were particularly
over-represented in the mutant.
The proteomic analysis of the other hfq mutant (2011-3.4)
used in this study identified periplasmic solute binding proteins of ABC transporters and metabolic enzymes as the
predominant sets of polypeptides which accumulation in
the cell was altered by disruption of the hfq gene by the
insertion of pK18mobsacB (Fig. 3, lower circle graphs).
Down-regulated transport proteins are all involved in the
uptake of different sugars; myo-inositol (IbpA), mannose/
xylose/glucose (AraA), fructose (FrcB) and α-glucosides
(AglE). Accordingly, several enzymes of the central carbon
metabolism were also less abundant in the mutant: a putative myo-inositol catabolic protein (IolE), a predicted

Torres-Quesada et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/71

malonic semialdehyde oxidative decarboxylase (IolD) and
a probable acetyl-CoA synthetase (AcsA1). Conversely, the
transporters overproduced by the 2011-3.4 mutant are all
related to the import of N substrates such as peptides
(DppA1 and DppA2), leucine (LivK), L-amino acids (AapJ
and AapP), other aminoacids (SMc02259), glycine betaine
(SMc02378) or choline (ChoX). Other up-regulated proteins as a result of the hfq mutation include metabolic
enzymes such as ornithine cyclodeaminase (Ocd), a probable arginase (ArgI1), a putative adenosylhomocysteinase
(AhcY) and a phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PckA).
Ocd and ArgI1 catalyze enzymatic reactions of the urea
cycle whereas AhcY is involved in the metabolism of sulphur-containing aminoacids. PckA catalyzes the conversion
of oxalacetate into phospho-enol pyruvate, thus initiating
the gluconeogenic pathway.
In summary, transcriptomics and proteomics independently suggest that in both S. meliloti hfq knock-out
mutants metabolism is biased towards the gluconeogenesis
pathway so that growth of free-living bacteria is mainly
supported by the utilization of amino acids rather than primary carbon substrates as energy sources.
Loss of Hfq affects S. meliloti nodulation kinetics,
competitiveness and symbiotic nitrogen fixation

Nodulation and competition tests were first performed in
order to evaluate the symbiotic behaviour of the S. meliloti
hfq mutants. Sets of 24 alfalfa plants grown hydroponically
in test tubes were independently inoculated with bacterial
suspensions of the wild-type strains (1021 and 2011) and
the knock-out hfq mutants (1021Δhfq and 2011-3.4). The
number of nodules per plant induced by each strain and the
percentage of nodulated plants were recorded at daily intervals post-inoculation (dpi). No significant differences were
observed in the onset of nodulation (i.e. time of appearance
of the first nodule) or the average number of nodules per
plant at the end of the experiment (30 dpi) when the wildtype S. meliloti 1021 strain and the mutant 1021Δhfq were
compared (Fig. 4a, left plot). The hfq mutant was also able
to nodulate 100% inoculated plants, further supporting similar nodulation efficiency of both strains (Fig. 4a, right
plot). However, a discrete delay in nodulation of the mutant
when compared to the wild-type nodulation kinetics was
revealed by both assays. Comparison of the symbiotic
behaviour of the 2011-3.4 mutant with that of its parent
strain 2011 led to identical conclusions (data not shown).
Together these results suggest that the loss of Hfq does not
affect the ability of S. meliloti to elicit nodule organogenesis on alfalfa roots but it probably influences on bacterial
adaptations to the plant rhizosphere.
Competition assays were then performed on alfalfa plants
grown in two different solid media; Leonard assemblies and
agar plates (Fig. 4b). Taking advantage of the tagging of the
2011-3.4 mutant with the Km resistance marker of

Page 7 of 20

pK18mobsacB co-inoculation suspensions were prepared in
this case by mixing S. meliloti 2011 and 2011-3.4 suspensions at 1:1 ratio. Thirty dpi nodules were able to fix nitrogen as revealed by their pink colour because of the presence
of leghemoglobin. A total of 180 nodules (121 from plants
in Leonard jars and 59 from plants on plates) were excised
from roots, crushed and simultaneously plated on TY and
TY-Km to identify nodule-occupying bacteria. Only 2.5%
of the nodules analyzed (mean of the two experiments)
were found to contain the mutant 2011-3.4 (Fig. 4b). Nonetheless, wild-type bacteria were also found within these
nodules and therefore the former percentage represents
double occupancy. The remaining nodules (97.5% on average) were exclusively occupied by the wild-type 2011
strain. These findings revealed that loss of Hfq has a major
impact on nodulation competitiveness of S. meliloti on
alfalfa roots.
Major differences in the symbiotic behaviour of the 1021
wild-type strain and the 1021Δhfq mutant were also
observed when looking at the final number of nitrogen-fixing nodules (i.e. pink nodules expressing the plant leghemoglobin) induced by each strain when inoculated
independently on alfalfa plants. This parameter was determined in plants grown either in test tubes or agar plates. At
the end of the experiment (30 dpi) 95% nodules elicited by
the wild-type strain were pink as indicative of active nitrogen-fixation, whatever the plant growth conditions,
whereas 55% (test tubes)-64% (agar plates) nodules
induced by the 1021Δhfq mutant remained white (Fig. 4c,
left graph). Furthermore, the first wild-type pink nodule
appeared on average 13 dpi. In contrast, this time was estimated to be 18 dpi in plants inoculated with the 1021Δhfq
strain. Finally, growth of alfalfa plants inoculated with S.
meliloti 1021 and 1021Δhfq strains were also compared in
experiments performed on Leonard jars during 30 days
(Fig. 4c, right panels). Plants inoculated with the hfq mutant
exhibited leaves with pale green colour and reached
roughly half of the height of the 1021-inoculated plants.
Dry weight determinations of individual plants confirmed
this perception; the average weight of plants inoculated
with the 1021Δhfq strain was hardly 64% of that of wildtype-inoculated plants. These results indicate that Hfq also
influenced late symbiotic stages and is required for the
establishment of an efficient nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.
1021Δhfq-induced nodules are almost devoid of nitrogenfixing bacteroids

To analyse in more detail the endosymbiotic phenotype
associated to an hfq mutation we performed optical microscopy on nodules induced by the 1021 wild-type strain and
its 1021Δhfq mutant derivative (Fig. 5). Wild-type nodules
were elongated and pink coloured as indicator of active
symbiotic nitrogen fixation (Fig. 5a). Bright-field microscopy of longitudinal sections of these nodules revealed the

visualized as little vesicles (Fig. 5d).

A large proportion of 1021Δhfq-induced nodules were
white and less elongated than those induced by the wildtype strain, thus revealing symbiotic deficiencies (Fig. 5e).
The remaining nodules appeared pink and exhibited wildtype histology (not shown). Light microscopic observation
of longitudinal sections of the Fix--looking nodules
revealed that the bacteroid-infected tissues were restricted
to the interzone II-III which even showed much less autofluorescence than in wild-type nodules when observed

extending to the base of the nodule, did not look as a typical
nitrogen-fixation zone III but instead it resembled the
senescence tissues (zone IV) of wild-type nodules. A detail
of this zone (Fig. 5h) further evidenced the histological
reminiscences of zone IV where a major proportion of plant
cells were devoid of differentiated bacteria and started to
collapse as revealed by the appearance of some cell debris
[37]. The few plant cells housing bacteroids were not pink
as in the wild-type nodules, but rather they appeared dark,

probably because of leghemoglobin degradation concomitant to bacterial death. We interpret this histology as the
1021Δhfq mutant retained some capacity to infect the host
and to differentiate into bacteroids but it was compromised
in the survival as endosymbiotic bacteria within the nodule
cells. This deficiency is the major determinant of the Fixphenotype observed in these nodules.
Hfq contributes to the regulation of nifA and fixK1/K2

An important set of pSymA-encoded transcripts with a
decreased accumulation in the 1021Δhfq mutant included
those corresponding to the two copies of the fixK regulator
(fixK1 and fixK2) and their downstream-dependent genes
coding for the components of the respiratory chain associated to the nitrogenase complex (fixN1, fixQ1, fixP1, fixG,
fixQ2, and the two copies of fixM) (Fig. 3, upper circle
graph). This was a surprising finding since it is well documented that transcription of nitrogen fixation genes (fix/nif)
is oxygen-regulated in legume nodules and only induced
under microoxic conditions in free-living bacteria [38].
Nonetheless, it has been also reported that a moderate
decrease of the ambient oxygen concentration (to 5%) in
the gas phase over a culture is sufficient to trigger ATPdependent autophosphorylation of the deoxygenated FixL
hemoprotein in the FixLJ-FixK phosphorelay cascade [39].
In S. meliloti phosphorylated FixJ not only activates transcription of the fixK1/K2 regulatory genes but also of nifA,
the transcriptional activator of the nif genes specifying the
nitrogenase complex. Expression of nifA has been shown to
demand more stringent microaerobic conditions [38].
Therefore, down-regulation of the fix genes in the hfq
mutant can be only explained if our culture conditions (15ml test tubes) enabled some level of expression of fixK1/
fixK2 in the wild-type 1021 strain and the accumulation of
the corresponding transcripts is influenced by the lack of
Hfq. Indeed, β-galactosidase assays in the wild-type 1021
strain carrying a fixK::lacZ transcriptional fusion demonstrated a 4-fold induction of fixK transcription in our culture
conditions compared to better aerated cultures (i.e. 20-ml
cultures in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks). Similar experiments
with a nifA::lacZ transcriptional fusion revealed no signs of
transcription of nifA whatever the aeration of the culture
(not shown). These findings and the fact that nifA expression had been also shown to be influenced by Hfq in other
α-proteobacterial diazotrophs [23-26] prompted us to further investigate the effects of Hfq on both nifA and fixK
expression in more stringent microaerobic conditions by
RT-PCR (Fig. 6). Confirming the results of microarray
experiments FixK transcripts were readily detected in RNA
from wild-type bacteria grown under assumed aerobiosis
(Fig. 6; line 1), whereas the 1021Δhfq failed to accumulate
these transcripts in these culture conditions (Fig. 6; line 2).
As expected, after 4 hours incubation in a microoxic atmosphere (2% O2) wild-type fixK expression was clearly

Page 10 of 20

induced as compared to aerobiosis (Fig. 6; compare lines 1
and 3). Strikingly, similar amounts of the FixK transcript
were detected in the RNA from the hfq mutant extracted
after the same treatment (Fig. 6; line 4). In contrast, nifA
expression was only detected after bacterial incubation in
microaerobiosis (Fig 6; line 3), further confirming that transcription of this gene demands lower O2 concentrations than
fixK. A significant reduced amount of NifA amplification
product was detected in the 1021Δhfq mutant RNA,
although this was still visible in ethidium bromide stained
gels (Fig. 6; line 4). Together, these results indicate that full
expression of fixK and nifA requires Hfq. Nonetheless, Hfqmediated regulation of fixK does not operate under in vitro
microoxic conditions and, therefore it could not be relevant
to symbiosis.
Some S. meliloti sRNAs bind Hfq

Mechanisms underlying Hfq-dependent post-transcriptional
regulation of gene expression could involve interaction of
the protein with either mRNA or sRNA molecules. We have
recently reported on the computational prediction and
experimental validation of seven S. meliloti sRNAs,
denoted as Smr RNAs, exhibiting differential expression
patterns potentially relevant to symbiosis [30]. To test
which of these Smr transcripts are Hfq targets we have used
RNA co-inmunoprecipitation (CoIP) with a chromosomally-encoded FLAG epitope-tagged Hfq protein specifi-

2) and after (lanes 3 and 4) culture incubation for 4 h in microaerobiosis
(2% O2). 16S was amplified as constitutive control of expression. Mocktreated (no RT) RNA samples were also PCR amplified with the same
primer combinations to check for absence of DNA contamination (not
shown).

cally recognized by monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies in
cell extracts of a S. meliloti hfqFLAG strain (Fig. 7, left
panel). This modification did not alter the growth phenotype of the wild-type strain (not shown), thus suggesting
that the tagged variant of the S. meliloti Hfq protein is
uncompromised in its ability to bind RNA, as reported in
other bacterial species [40]. CoIP RNAs were subjected to
Northern analysis with oligonucleotide probes for the Smr
RNAs [30]. For each sRNA, Hfq binding was assessed at
the growth phase in TY broth where the sRNA was previously shown to be most abundant; log phase for transcripts
SmrC7, SmrC9, SmrC14, SmrC16, SmrB35 and SmrC45
and stationary phase for SmrC15. As a control of binding
specificity, identical analyses were performed in extracts
from the wild-type strain 1021 which does not express any
polypeptide recognized by the anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig.
7, left panel). As expected, no hybridization signal was
detected for any of the tested sRNAs in CoIP samples from
this control strain (Fig. 7, right panel). In contrast, hybridization bands corresponding to SmrC9, SmrC15, SmrC16
and SmrC45 full-length transcripts were readily detected in
CoIP RNA from the S. meliloti hfqFLAG strain and thus, they
were concluded to specifically bind to the epitope-tagged
Hfq protein (Fig. 7, right panel). Comparison of Smr transcripts abundance in the CoIP samples and their expression
levels in S. meliloti likely revealed different binding efficiencies of these sRNAs to Hfq. Therefore, the lack of
hybridization signals to SmrC7, SmrC14 and SmrB35
probes could be interpreted as either absence in the CoIP
RNA or very low binding affinity to Hfq which renders
these sRNAs under the detection level of the Northern
hybridization. Additional bands of different intensity, not
detected in the S. meliloti total RNA, corresponding to
RNA species smaller than the full-length transcripts were
also visible when CoIP RNA was hybridized to SmrC9,
SmrC16 and SmrC45 probes. A recent report addressing
the stability of the seemingly homologous SmrC15 and
SmrC16 sRNAs in a S. meliloti 2011 Δhfq mutant suggested that Hfq protects both full-length transcripts from
degradation and stabilises degradation products corresponding specifically to the 3'-half of SmrC16 [29]. Our
results corroborate that both, SmrC15 and SmrC16 sRNAs
do bind Hfq and also suggest that the major band detected
by the SmrC16 probe could correspond to a degradation
product of this transcript interacting with a particular high
efficiency with the protein. Nonetheless, the identity of this
SmrC16-derived product remains controversial since the
probe used in our study hybridizes to the 5'-half rather than
to the 3'-end of the full-length transcript. Thus, further verifications should be carried out to elucidate this apparent
contradiction. Similarly, the additional faint hybridization
bands detected with SmrC9 and SmrC45 probes could be
interpreted as corresponding to degradation products of

Discussion
There is increasing evidence that the ubiquitous RNA chaperone Hfq acts as a global post-transcriptional regulator
controlling gene networks underlying key steps in the interactions of pathogenic bacteria with their eukaryotic hosts
[41]. However, its role in beneficial host-microbe interactions had not been investigated in detail. Here, we have
genetically addressed the function of Hfq in the nitrogenfixing endosymbiont S. meliloti, both as free-living bacterium and during the symbiotic interaction with its legume
host alfalfa. As summarized in the model shown in Fig. 8,
our results suggest the involvement of Hfq in bacterial pathways affecting central metabolism, rhizospheric competence, survival within the nodule cells and symbiotic
nitrogen fixation. Hfq had been previously reported to have
a role in the regulation of nitrogen fixation genes in several
α-proteobacterial diazotrophs [23-26]. Therefore, the pres-

Torres-Quesada et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/71

ent study extends the role of Hfq in beneficial nitrogen-fixing bacteria to other processes related to the interaction
with the plant host, further supporting the predicted universal role of Hfq in the establishment and maintenance of
chronic intracellular residences regardless the outcome of
these infections. Furthermore, we provide the first experimental evidence of S. meliloti sRNAs-binding Hfq, thus
anticipating the involvement of these molecules at different
levels in the complex S. meliloti Hfq regulatory network.
Hfq influences growth and central carbon metabolism in S.
meliloti

Hfq loss-of-function affected the free-living growth of S.
meliloti, thus confirming the predicted pleiotropy of this
mutation in bacteria. To investigate the molecular basis of
this growth deficiency we combined transcriptomic and
proteomic profiling of two independent S. meliloti hfq
mutants (1021Δhfq and 2011-3.4) exhibiting similar freeliving growth defects. These experiments identified 168
transcripts and 33 polypeptides displaying reliable differential accumulation in the respective mutant and wild-type
strains, with 9 genes common to both sets. The differences

Page 12 of 20

between the wild-type 2011 and 1021 strains could partially
explain the limited overlap between proteins and transcripts
regulated by Hfq in both genetic backgrounds. However,
this has been also observed in Salmonella and more likely
reflects the differential global effects of this protein on transcription, transcript stability and translation [42]. Nonetheless, both analyses converged in the identification of genes
coding for periplasmic solute binding proteins of ABC
transporters and metabolic enzymes as the dominant functional categories influenced by an Hfq mutation. The extensive role of Hfq in the regulation of nutrient uptake and
central metabolism has been also highlighted by global
transcriptome/proteome analyses of other hfq mutants such
as those of E. coli, Salmonella tiphymurium, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa or Yersinia pestis [15,43-45]. Furthermore, in
Salmonella and E. coli the massive regulation of genes
encoding periplasmic substrate-binding proteins of ABC
uptake systems for amino acids and peptides involves the
Hfq-dependent GcvB sRNA [46]. GcvB homologs of distantly related bacteria conserve a G/U-rich stretch that
binds to extended complementary C/A-rich regions, which
may serve as translational enhancer elements, in the mRNA

targets [46]. The apparent widespread distribution of GcvB
RNAs in bacteria suggests that a similar regulatory mechanism for ABC transporters could also exist in S. meliloti.
Loss of Hfq also resulted in the general down-regulation of
genes of the main central energy production pathways
based on sugar uptake and catabolism as well as of some
other genes predicted to participate in the biosynthesis of
macromolecule building blocks such as amino acids or
nucleosides. This seems to impose a metabolic shift favouring TCA and gluconeogenesis which are supported by the
up-regulation of the amino acid supply and nitrogen metabolism (Fig. 8). Furthermore, some genes encoding components of the electron transfer chains were also downregulated in the mutant, which predicts the reduction of the
proton motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. We
conclude that this metabolic rearrangement could explain
the growth phenotype of the S. meliloti hfq knock-out
mutants.
Lack of Hfq affects different stages of the S. meliloti-alfalfa
symbiosis

Early events of the symbiotic interaction of rhizobia with
their legume hosts involve active colonization of the plant
rhizosphere and the subsequent response to specific rootexuded compounds (i.e flavonoids) to trigger Nod factor
signalling pathways leading to nodule organogenesis
[27,28,47]. The rhizosphere is a complex environment providing bacteria with a wide range of carbon and nitrogen
compounds. Therefore, the ecological success of the
legume symbionts demands high metabolic plasticity,
which in S. meliloti is guaranteed by the large sets of genes
encoding ABC transporters and metabolic enzymes [31]. It
is well documented that metabolic traits related to carbon
supply and catabolism are important for S. meliloti to successfully compete for nodulation in the rhizosphere [48].
We have shown that the S. meliloti hfq mutants, when independently inoculated, are able to nodulate alfalfa roots at
similar rates than the wild-type strains; although a slight
delay in nodulation was observed. These results evidence
that the hfq mutation did not compromise the perception
and production of the specific symbiotic signals (i.e. flavonoids and Nod factors, respectively) that trigger nodule
organogenesis but suggest that bacterial adaptation in the
rhizosphere was affected. Indeed, in the presence of the
wild-type strain an hfq knock-out mutant was unable to
elicit nodules, further supporting that the metabolic alterations linked to the loss of Hfq represent a major disadvantage for the competitive colonization of the alfalfa
rhizosphere.
Although the S. meliloti hfq mutants were able to induce
nodules on alfalfa roots (Nod+ phenotype) we noticed that a
large proportion of these nodules looked non-fixing. Furthermore, we also observed a significant delay in the onset
of symbiotic nitrogen-fixation (i.e. expression of the leghe-

Page 13 of 20

moglobin) in the remaining mutant-induced nodules (36%45%) as compared to wild-type kinetics. As expected, these
symbiotic deficiencies negatively affected the outcome of
symbiosis (i.e. plant growth). Together, these findings indicate an influence of Hfq in intermediate and/or late symbiotic stages. A closer examination of the white 1021Δhfqinduced nodules revealed scarce presence of leghemoglobin
and a small proportion of plant cells containing nitrogenfixing endosymbiotic bacteria. Furthermore, signs of premature bacteroid senescence were observed in these nodules. These results suggest that loss of Hfq affects the
ability of S. meliloti to survive within the intracellular environment of the host. This phenotype has been reported as a
common feature of hfq mutants of phylogenetically distant
pathogenic bacteria [10-12,15,21,22].
Legumes provide invading bacteria with defined and
dominant energy sources (i.e. dicarboxylic acids for bacteroids) other than the carbon substrates used for free-living
growth in the rhizosphere [47]. Therefore, although the
alteration of central metabolic pathways could contribute to
different extent to the colonization of developing nodules,
they provide only a partial explanation for the hfq endosymbiotic phenotype. Besides nutrient compounds, invading
bacteria has to perceive and respond to a variety of plant
signals to successfully colonize legume nodules [27,28],
these include; reactive oxygen species released by the host
upon infection [49], peptides likely transported into bacterial cells by the product of the bacA gene to launch bacteroid differentiation [50,51], the low pH of intracellular
compartments [52] or the microoxic environment
demanded by the nitrogenase complex to fix atmospheric
nitrogen [38]. Our proteomic analysis identified GroEL2,
GroEL3, GrpE and IbpA chaperons as deregulated in the
2011-3.4 hfq mutant. Four groESL operons and an additional groEL gene are present in the S. meliloti genome,
being the groEL1 required for nodulation and nitrogen-fixation [53,54]. Thus, it can be speculated that Hfq-dependent
chaperones could help also infective rhizobia to cope with
the prolonged stress within the plant host. On the other
hand, the transcriptomic profiling revealed that the accumulation of FixK1/FixK2 transcripts is Hfq-dependent. RTPCR experiments on RNA obtained from cells subjected to
more stringent microaerophilic conditions revealed that
Hfq-mediated regulation of fixK operates in our assumed
aerobic conditions but not in microaerobiosis. In S. meliloti
fixK expression is also subjected to indirect autoregulation
through the inhibition of the FixL sensor kinase by the FixT
protein [55,56]. Therefore, our findings add another level of
complexity to the FixK-dependent regulatory circuit whose
biological significance remains to be elucidated. The same
RT-PCR experiments showed that Hfq also contributes to
the positive regulation of nifA, although transcripts of this
gene were still detected in the mutant. Down-regulation of
nifA would impact on nitrogenase synthesis, thus explain-

Torres-Quesada et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/71

ing the Hfq effects on the onset and probably the efficiency
of nitrogen fixation itself in 36%-45% nodules that supported growth and development of the 1021Δhfq-inoculated
plants in our assays. In addition, it has been recently
reported that the effects of a mutation in the nifA gene
extends beyond the regulation of the nitrogen fixation genes
to influence other cellular processes such as motility or synthesis of extracellular proteins [57]. Therefore, the downregulation of this gene provides further explanation for the
symbiotic phenotype of the hfq mutant. It has been recently
reported that the Hfq-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of nifA in R. leguminosarum bv. viciae involves the
cleavage of NifA mRNA in its 5' region by RNAseE,
thereby making the Shine-Dalgarno sequence accessible for
the ribosomes [26]. Given the synteny of the nifA genomic
region in S. meliloti and R. leguminosarum it is tempting to
speculate on a similar mechanism controlling NifA translation in the alfalfa endosymbiont.
Detailed genome-wide identification of Hfq-dependent
symbiotic genes in planta is a technical difficult task that
can be approached by mimicking specific symbiotic conditions in bacterial cultures. Therefore, our study is definitely
worth extending to all abiotic and biotic stresses impacting
the S. meliloti symbiotic lifestyle. Nonetheless, the similarities among hfq-related phenotypes in phylogenetically distant bacterial species anticipate a conservation of major Hfq
downstream target genes governing common adaptive
responses of bacteria for the interaction with and the invasion of their eukaryotic hosts.
Some S. meliloti sRNAs are Hfq targets

Trans-acting antisense regulatory sRNAs are major components of Hfq-dependent regulatory networks helping bacteria to deal with external stimuli [5,8,58,59]. Cellular
processes controlled by Hfq-binding sRNAs include quorum sensing, transport and metabolism, synthesis of virulence factors, sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides or
general adaptation to a variety of abiotic stresses including
low pH or oxidative stress [41]. Therefore, many of the
recently identified S. meliloti sRNAs are predicted to fulfil
similar functions in an Hfq-dependent manner [30,60,61].
We used a genetically modified S. meliloti 1021 strain
expressing a chromosomally-encoded FLAG-epitope
tagged Hfq protein to search for Hfq targets among the
seven differentially expressed sRNAs identified and
mapped in our previous work [30]. This is a generic strategy that has been shown to retrieve high amounts of Hfqbinding RNAs with high specificity [40,59,62]. Our CoIP
experiments identified 4 out of the 7 sRNA transcripts as
specific targets of Hfq: SmrC9, SmrC15, SmrC16 and
SmrC45. Accordingly, the conserved secondary structure of
these sRNAs, as inferred from co-variance models,
revealed several single stranded AU-rich stretches (del Val
and Jiménez-Zurdo, unpublished) which are predicted to

Page 14 of 20

interact with Hfq [6]. S. meliloti encodes an Hfq protein
conserving the RNA binding core but lacking the C-terminal extension of γ- and β-proteobacterial Hfqs. In E. coli
this C-terminal domain is dispensable for sRNA binding
but required for auto- and riboregulation [63]. Therefore,
the mechanistic and biological implications of sRNAs binding to a naturally-occurring truncated variant of Hfq remain
as open questions.

Conclusions
The S. meliloti RNA chaperone Hfq is a pleiotropic regulator influencing central metabolic pathways in free-living
bacteria and several aspects of the symbiosis with its
legume host alfalfa: nodulation competitiveness, survival of
endosymbiotic bacteria within the nodule cells and expression of the key regulators of nitrogen-fixation. The identified Hfq-dependent phenotypes, mRNAs and sRNAs in a
beneficial plant-interacting rhizobacteria such as S. meliloti
constitute a new baseline to further investigate the Hfqmediated pathways controlling common strategies of phylogenetically distant bacteria to colonize, infect and survive
within their eukaryotic host cells.
Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids, media and growth conditions

Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study along with
their relevant characteristics are listed in Table 1. S. meliloti
wild-type and hfq mutant derivative strains were routinely
grown in complex tryptone-yeast TY [64] or defined MM
media [65] at 30°C and E. coli strains in Luria-Bertani (LB)
medium at 37°C. For microaerobic growth bacteria were
initially grown in 25 ml of TY medium in aerated shaken
flasks to O.D600 nm 0.5. Cultures were then flushed with a
2% oxygen-98% argon gas mixture during 10 min and incubated for a further 4 h. Antibiotics were added to the media
when required at the following final concentrations: streptomycin (Sm), 250 μg/ml; ampicillin (Ap), 200 μg/ml; tetracycline (Tc), 10 μg/ml; and kanamycin (Km), 50 μg/ml
for E. coli and 180 μg/ml for rhizobia.
Growth rates of rhizobial strains were monitored in an
automated BioScreen C MBR machine (Growth Curves
USA, Piscataway, NJ). Tested strains were initially grown
in TY to late log phase (109 cells/ml; O.D600 nm 0.9-1.0).
Aliquots of 1 ml of the starting cultures were centrifuged;
the pelleted cells were washed with fresh TY and finally
resuspended in 1 ml of the medium. Ten μl of the bacterial
suspensions (~107 cells) were inoculated into 340 μl of TY
broth in Bioscreen Honey comb 100-well plates which were
incubated at 30°C with continuous shaking. Absorbance
readings at 600 nm were recorded every 2 h until the cultures reached the late stationary phase. OD values of uninoculated media were subtracted from cultures OD readings

Construction of the S. meliloti hfq mutant derivatives

A 1,684-bp DNA region containing the 243-bp hfq ORF
and flanking sequences (714-bp upstream and 727-bp
downstream of hfq) was PCR amplified with Pfu poly-

merase using the primers pair Hfq_Fw/Hfq_Rv (for all the
oligonucleotides cited hereafter see the additional file 3:
oligonucleotide sequences) and S. meliloti 1021 genomic
DNA as template. This DNA fragment was inserted into
pGEM®-T Easy vector generating plasmid pGEMhfq. For
the construction of the S. meliloti 2011 hfq insertion mutant
derivatives two internal regions of the gene were Taq ampli-

fied from pGEMhfq with primers combinations hfqforw1/
hfqrev2 and hfqforw3/hfqrev4 and subcloned into the suicide vector pK18mobsacB generating plasmids pK18_1.2
and pK18_3.4, respectively. Both plasmids were independently conjugated into the 2011 wild-type strain by triparental matings, using pRK2013 as helper, yielding mutants
2011-1.2 and 2011-3.4 which were selected as KmrSmr colonies in MM agar as a result of pK18mobsacB integration
into the hfq gene by single homologous recombination
events. Mutations were verified by PCR and the precise
location of plasmid insertion into the hfq gene was determined by sequencing of the PCR products. For the generation of the S. meliloti 1021 hfq deletion mutant, plasmid
pGEMhfq was amplified with Pfu polymerase with divergent primers (hfqi_1/hfqi_2) flanking the hfq ORF and carrying an internal HindIII restriction site. The PCR product
was HindIII-digested and autoligated generating plasmid
pGEMΔhfq that contains a 1,447-bp S. meliloti 1021
genomic region in which the hfq ORF was deleted and
replaced by a HindIII site. This region was retrieved from
pGEMΔhfq and inserted into pK18mobsacB as an EcoRI
fragment yielding pK18Δhfq which was mobilized into the
wild-type 1021 by a triparental mating with pRK2013 as
helper. Transconjugants arising from a single cross-over
event were selected as KmrSmr colonies in MM and simultaneously verified to retain sacarose sensitivity in TY agar
(10% sucrose). KmrSmrSacs bacteria from an isolated colony were further cultured in TY broth and 106 cells from
this culture were finally plated on TY agar containing 10%
sucrose to select double cross-over events (i.e. excision of
pK18mobsacB). Deletion of the hfq gene in the mutant bacteria was checked by colony PCR with oligonucleotides
5HfqMut/3HfqMut followed by HindIII restriction of the
PCR products.
To express Hfq under the control of its own promoter for
complementation of the mutants an 842-bp DNA fragment
containing the Hfq coding sequence along with 571 nt of
the upstream region was PCR amplified with Pfu using
primers 5Hfq_C/3Hfq_C and pGEMhfq as the template.
The PCR product was inserted into pGEM®-T Easy yielding pGEMHfq and finally cloned into the low copy plasmid
vector pJB3Tc19 as an EcoRI fragment generating pJBHfq
which was conjugated into the S. meliloti hfq mutant derivatives by triparental matings.
Modification of the chromosomal hfq gene to express a
C-terminal epitope-tagged Hfq protein was done as follows.
A dsDNA fragment encoding 3 tandem FLAG epitopes (3 ×
FLAG; Sigma-Aldrich) was first generated by annealing of
the 3 × Flag and 3 × Flag-i 69mer oligonucleotides which
were designed to leave 5'-end overhangs complementary to
XbaI and HindIII recognition sequences. The resulting
DNA fragment was then inserted between these two restriction sites in pBluescript II KS+ giving pKS3 × Flag. The
full-length Hfq coding sequence (without the TGA stop

Page 16 of 20

codon) along with 655 bp of its upstream genomic region
was PCR amplified from pGEMhfq with the primers pair
5HfqTag/3HfqTag both carrying XbaI sites at the 5'-end.
The resulting PCR product was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy
and retrieved as an XbaI DNA fragment which was gel
purified and inserted at the XbaI site of pKS3 × Flag yielding pKS3 × Flag5. A second 873-bp DNA fragment containing the stop codon for the translation of the epitopetagged Hfq protein was generated by PCR amplification of
the hfq downstream region from pGEMhfq using the primers pair 5FlxTag/3FlxTag which incorporates HindIII sites
at both ends of the resulting fragment. The amplification
product was inserted into pGEM®-T Easy, recovered as a
HindIII fragment, gel purified and finally cloned into the
HindIII site of pKS3 × Flag5 to obtain pKSHfq3 × Flag.
This plasmid was used as template to amplify an 1,839-bp
DNA fragment with a variant of primers 5HfqTag and
3FlxTag in which the XbaI and HindIII sites were replaced
by EcoRI and SphI sites, respectively. The resulting PCR
product was cloned in pGEM®-T Easy to obtain
pGEMHfq3 × Flag, then retrieved as an EcoRI/HindIII
fragment and finally inserted between these two restriction
sites in the polylinker of pK18mobsacB giving pK18Hfq3 ×
Flag. This plasmid was mobilized by a triparental mating to
the wild-type strain 1021 for replacement of the hfq gene by
the modified allele. Four out of the 18 colonies screened by
colony PCR after the second cross-over event were found to
incorporate the 3 × FLAG coding sequence and were kept
for further Western analysis with commercial FLAG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich).
All plasmid constructs requiring previous PCR amplification of the cloned inserts were checked by sequencing. The
correct genomic arrangements in all the S. meliloti hfq
derivative strains were assessed by Southern hybridization
of genomic DNA with the appropriate radioactive labeled
dsDNA probes using standard protocols.
Transcriptomics

Total rhizobial RNA was purified from log cultures in TY
broth (10 ml) using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) following manufacturers instructions. Cy3- and
Cy5-labeled cDNAs were prepared from 20 μg total RNA
according to an amino-allyl dye coupling protocol as previously described [66,67].
Two slide (Sm14KOLI microarrays) hybridizations were
performed with labeled cDNA from RNA preparations corresponding to 3 independent bacterial cultures following
described protocols [67,68]. This represents a total of 12
potential hybridization data per spot. Slides were scanned
with the GenePixTM Personal 4100A Microarray Scanner
(MDS Analytical Technologies Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Mean hybridization signal and mean local background
intensities were determined for each spot of the microarray
images with the GenePix 5.0 software for spot detection,

Torres-Quesada et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/71

image segmentation and signal quantification (MDS Analytical Technologies Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The log2
value of the ratio of intensities was determined for each
spot according to Mi = log2(Ri/Gi), being Ri = Ich1i - Bgch1i
and Gi = Ich2i - Bgch2i; where Ich1i and Ich2i are the signal
intensities in channels 1 and 2, respectively, and Bgch1i and
Bgch2i are the background intensities of each spot in channels 1 and 2, respectively. The mean intensity (Ai) was calculated for each spot using the formula: Ai = log2(RiGi)0.5
[67]. Normalization and t-statistics were carried out with
the EMMA 2.8.2 software developed at the Bioinformatics
Resource Facility, Center for Biotechnology (CeBiTec),
Bielefeld University (https://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/
groups/brf/software/emma/cgi-bin/emma2.cgi[69]) which
implements a normalization method based on local regression accounting for intensity and spatial dependence in dye
biases [70]. Genes were scored as differentially expressed if
the confidence indicator P was ≤ 0.05, the mean intensity A
≥ 8 and the expression ratio M ≥ 1 or ≤ -1, as calculated
from at least eight of the 12 replicates per spot.
Proteomics

Preparation of protein extracts and 2D-gel electrophoresis
were carried out essentially as described previously [71].
The S. meliloti wild-type 2011 and derivative strains 20111.2 and 2011-3.4 were grown in 500 ml TY broth to log
phase (OD600: 0.5-0.9). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C and 6,000 × g for 20 min and cells were
washed twice with LS buffer (68 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.5
mM KH2PO4, 9 mM NaH2PO4). The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 40
μg/ml RNase, 20 μg/ml DNase, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride). The cells were disrupted by either sonication or French press. Cell debris were removed by
centrifugation at 4°C and 12,000 × g for 20 min. Proteins
were precipitated during 4 h with 4 volumes of cold acetone
and collected by centrifugation at 4°C and 15,000 × g for 10
min. Acetone was allowed to evaporate in a laminar flow
cabinet and the proteins were solubilized in free-dithiothreitol (DTT) rehydration solution (8 M urea, 2% CHAPS and
traces of bromophenol blue). Protein concentration in the
supernatant was determined by the Bradford assay. For 2D
electrophoresis, 600 μg of proteins were solubilized in 495
μl of rehydration solution and 5 μl of 28% DTT and 2.5 μl
of IPG buffer were added. The mixture was subjected to
isoelectric focusing using Immobiline DryStrip (18 cm-pH
4 to 7) (Amersham Biosciences) using the following program: 1 h at 0 V, 12 h at 30 V, 2 h at 60 V, 1 h at 500 V, 1 h
at 1000 V and a final phase of 8,000 V until reaching
75,000 V/h. The strips were equilibrated for 15 min with
shaking in a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8 containing
6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS and 2% DTT, subjected to
a second equilibration for 15 min with the same solution

Page 17 of 20

containing 2.5% iodoacetamide and 0.01% of bromophenol
blue instead of DTT and then loaded onto 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. Second-dimension electrophoreses were performed at 20 W per gel, with a previous 30 min step at 4 W
per gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue R. Spots
corresponding to differentially accumulated proteins were
excised from the gels, digested with trypsin and subjected
to MALDI-TOF MS (Unidad de Proteómica, Parque Científico de Madrid). Peptide fragmentation and sequencing was
only performed if necessary. Protein identification was
done with the help of PRIAM application (http://
www.priam.prabi.fr) and MASCOT program [72].
Reverse transcriptase PCR

Total RNA of the wild-type 1021 and 1021Δhfq deletion
mutant strains grown under both oxic and microoxic conditions was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) following manufacturers instructions.
Each RNA sample (5 μg) was reverse transcribed with the
AMV reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics, Germany)
using random hexamers as primers in 10 μl reaction mixtures. cDNA preparations were diluted to 100 μl and 1 μl of
each sample was subjected to 25 cycles of PCR amplification for the detection of NifA and FixK1/K2 transcripts
with primer pairs nifAFw/nifARv and fixKFw/fixKRv,
respectively. As the reference, the abundance of the 16S
RNA was assessed by amplification of each cDNA with
primers 16SFw/16SRv. Possible contamination of the RNA
preparations with DNA was assessed by PCR amplification
of the samples with each combination of primers.
Plant assays and nodule microscopy

Medicago sativa L. 'Aragón' seeds were surface sterilized
as previously described [73], germinated on 0.8% water
agar plates in the dark at 28°C for 24 h, and finally transferred to either test tubes, Leonard assemblies or agar plates
containing a nitrogen-free nutrient solution [74]. Seedlings
were inoculated with 1 ml of a bacterial suspension at
OD600 nm 0.05. Nodulation kinetics of the assayed strains
were determined in two independent sets of 24 plants
grown hydroponically in test tubes by recording the number
of nodulated plants and the number of nodules per plant at
different days after inoculation. For competition assays, 7days-old alfalfa plants grown in Leonard jars or agar plates
were inoculated with 1:1 mixtures of the S. meliloti wildtype 2011 strain and its hfq insertion mutant derivative
2011-3.4 (Kmr). A representative number of mature nodules (50-130 depending on the experiment) were collected
30 days after plants inoculation, surface-sterilized for 5 min
in 0.25% HgCl2, crushed and simultaneously plated on TY
and TY-Km agar to record the number of nodules invaded
by wild-type and 2011-3.4 strains. The efficiency of the reference S. meliloti 1021 and its hfq deletion mutant derivative (1021Δhfq) in symbiotic nitrogen fixation was assessed

Torres-Quesada et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:71
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/71

in Leonard assemblies by determination of the dry weigh of
individual plants 30 days after inoculation with the rhizobial strains.
Microscopy was performed on mature (30-days-old) nodules from plants grown and inoculated in agar plates. Nodulated roots were embedded in 3% agarose and 100 μmtransversal sections were made using a Leica VT1200S
vibratome. Nodule sections were observed under an optical
Nikon AZ100 microscope.
Western blot and co-inmunoprecipitation assays

To verify the expression of the 3 × FLAG tagged Hfq protein, 0.05 OD whole cell protein fractions of the S. meliloti
1021 wild-type strain and the S. meliloti 1021hfqFLAG derivatives (two independent clones arising from the second
crossing-over were tested) were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting during 50 min at 100 mA (TE77PWR semidry apparatus, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked for
1 h in 1.5% dry milk in TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.18
M NaCl) and hybridized as follows: ANTI-FLAG® monoclonal antibody (Sigma #F7425; 1/1000 in TBS) for 1 h at
room temperature, 3 × 10 min wash in TBS, α-mouse-HRP
(1/5000 in TBS) for 1 h at room temperature, 3 × 10 min
wash in TBS. Blots were developed by incubation for 2-3
min in 20 ml of luminol solution [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6,
NaCl 150 mM, 8 mg luminol (Sigma Aldrich), 1 mg 4iodophenol, 0.01% H2O2] and exposed to Konica Minolta
medical films.
For co-inmunoprecipitation, the 1021 wild-type strain
and its derivative 1021hfqFLAG were cultured in 200 ml of
TY broth to OD600 nm 0.6. Total RNA was prepared from 25
ml of each culture as previously described [30]. The
remaining cells (175 ml) were collected by centrifugation
(10 min, 4000 × g, 4°C). The pellets were washed with cold
PBS, chilled on ice, resuspended in 8 ml of lysis buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and
1% TRITON X-100) and disrupted by sonication in three
cycles of 10 s bursts at 32 W with a microprobe. Cell
lysates were incubated 30 min at 4°C with shaking and centrifuged (20 min, 12000 × g, 4°C). Forty microliters of the
ANTI-FLAG M2® resin (Sigma #A2220) were added to the
cleared lysates followed by incubation overnight with shaking at 4°C. The suspensions were centrifuged; the beads
were resuspended in 1 ml lysis buffer and transferred to
spin columns, followed by five washes in 1 ml of the same
buffer. Protein/RNA complexes were recovered from beads
by incubation with 15 ng of 3 × FLAG Peptide® (Sigma
#F4799) followed by elution in 100 μl of water. Phenol:chloroform extracted RNA was concentrated by ethanol
precipitation and resuspended in 70 μl of water. Aliquots of
10 μg of total RNA and 10 μl of the co-inmunoprecipitated
RNA were subjected to Northern analysis with the Smr
sRNAs probes as described [30].
