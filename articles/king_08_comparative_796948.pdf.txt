Abstract
Background: Whooping cough caused by Bordetella pertussis in humans, is re-emerging in many
countries despite vaccination. Several studies have shown that significant shifts have occurred in
the B. pertussis population resulting in antigenic divergence between vaccine strains and circulating
strains and suggesting pathogen adaptation. In the Netherlands, the resurgence of pertussis is
associated with the rise of B. pertussis strains with an altered promoter region for pertussis toxin
(ptxP3).
Results: We used Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), Multiple-Locus Variable Number of
Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
to characterize the ptxP3 strains associated with the Dutch epidemic. For CGH analysis, we
developed an oligonucleotide (70-mers) microarray consisting of 3,581 oligonucleotides
representing 94% of the gene repertoire of the B. pertussis strain Tohama I. Nine different MLST
profiles and 38 different MLVA types were found in the period 1993 to 2004. Forty-three Dutch
clinical isolates were analyzed with CGH, 98 genes were found to be absent in at least one of the
B. pertussis strains tested, these genes were clustered in 8 distinct regions of difference.
Conclusion: The presented MLST, MLVA and CGH-analysis identified distinctive characteristics
of ptxP3 B. pertussis strains -the most prominent of which was a genomic deletion removing about
23,000 bp. We propose a model for the emergence of ptxP3 strains.

Background
Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella pertussis are closely related respiratory pathogens that
infect mammalian species.B. bronchiseptica causes chronic
respiratory tract infections in a wide variety of mammals
but has only been sporadically isolated from humans
[1,2]. B. parapertussis consists of two distinct lineages that
infect sheep and humans, respectively [3]. B. pertussisis is
a human pathogen that causes pertussis, also known as
whooping cough, a disease that is particularly severe in
infants.
For about 50 years, many countries have been immunizing young children with pertussis vaccines to control disease. Despite vaccination, pertussis remains endemic,
with regular epidemic outbreaks. World-wide, whooping
cough causes up to 300,000 deaths every year, mostly
among unvaccinated infants [4]. Even in countries with a
high vaccination coverage, a significant increase in the
pertussis incidence has been observed since the 1990s [57]. In the Netherlands, such an increase in pertussis has
been observed since 1996 [8].
The resurgence of pertussis in countries with high vaccination coverage has been attributed to a number of factors,
including increased awareness with regard to the disease,
improved diagnostics, waning vaccine-induced immunity
and pathogen adaptation [4,7]. Consistent with pathogen
adaptation, numerous studies have demonstrated that the
B. pertussis population has changed in several countries
where vaccination has been implemented since the 1950s
[9-13]. In particular, antigenic divergence was found
between circulating strains and vaccine strains with
respect to pertussis toxin (Ptx) and pertactin (Prn).
In the Netherlands this divergence between vaccine and
circulating strains has played a role in the reemergence of
pertussis [7,14]. More recent studies have also found polymorphism in other surface proteins, including tracheal
colonization factor A (TcfA) [15,16], the serotype 2 and 3
fimbrial subunits (Fim2 and Fim3) [15,17-19] and in the
promoter region for the ptx operon [20]. The latter mutation was found in the Netherlands since the 1990s and we
observed that strains with a particular allele of the ptx promoter (ptxP), i.e. ptxP3, have expanded in the Dutch B.
pertussis population. The increase in frequency of ptxP3
strains coincided with the increase in pertussis notifications in the Netherlands. Moreover B. pertussis strains carrying this novel allele for the pertussis toxin promoter
were shown to confer increased virulence [21].
In recent years genomic tools like DNA microarrays have
been used for comparison of the genetic composition of
different strains within a species. Several microarray-platforms have been developed and applied to specifically

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/311

address questions related to the genome of B. pertussis [2225].
In the study presented here we used Multi-Locus Sequence
Typing (MLST), Multiple-Locus Variable Number of Tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA) and a microarray-based
Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) method to
investigate the heterogeneity of the strains dominating the
current Dutch pertussis epidemics, in particularly the
ptxP3 strains. We have developed an oligonucleotide
microarray representing 94% of the gene repertoire of the
B. pertussis Tohama I strain, of which the genome has been
sequenced [26]. This microarray allowed us to study the
gene contents of the strains involved in the Dutch epidemics and thus to identify (other) polymorphic loci
associated with epidemic phenotype. Representative
Dutch isolates from 1993 to 2004 were selected since pertussis epidemics have been occurring regularly in the
Netherlands since 1996. We aimed to identify MLST,
MLVA and gene profiles associated with the Dutch epidemics and to determine the characteristics and heterogeneity of those epidemic strains.

Results
Dutch strains were selected from the period 1993–2004.
The period 1993–1995 was characterized by a relative low
level of notifications. In 1996 a sudden increase in notifications was observed and this high level has been maintained until today [5].
MLST analyses
Three genes known to be polymorphic in the period
1993–2004, ptxP, fim3 and prn, were selected for the MLST
analysis of 158 strains. The ptxP gene occurred as two alleles, ptxP1 and ptxP3. The fim3 gene occurred as four alleles
(fim3-1, fim3-2, fim3-3, fim3-4), while three prn alleles
were observed (prn1,prn2 and prn3).

We observed 9 different MLST-profiles in the period from
1993 to 2004 (Fig. 1). A number of MLSTs (i.e. MLST141,
MLST311, MLST313 and MLST323) were found in low
frequencies in the whole period (< 1.5%) and combined
into a single group designated R. The highest frequency of
the minor MLSTs (25%) was found in 1996. For clarity,
we will discuss first discuss MLSTs with ptxP1, followed by
those harboring ptxP3. Strains with the ptxP1 allele were
gradually replaced by ptxP3 strains, which were predominant from 1998 on. The ptxP1 allele was linked to fim3-1
(linkage 100%) and three prn alleles, prn1, prn2 and prn3
(linkage, respectively, 16%, 30% and 54%). MLST113
predominated until 1996 (frequencies 61% to 42%) and
showed a gradual decrease in frequency from 1996 to
1999, after which it was not detected. MLST111 was
detected in the period 1994–1997 (frequencies 9%–
25%). MLST112 strains were found in the whole period,

Figure 1 trends in MLST frequencies of Dutch B. pertussis strains from 1993 to 2004
Temporal
Temporal trends in MLST frequencies of Dutch B. pertussis strains from 1993 to 2004. The MLST designation was
based on the allele number in the order ptxP, fim3 and prn. E.g. MLST113 represents strains with ptxP1, fim3-1 and prn3. MLSTs
found in frequencies less then 1.5% in the whole period were combined into a single group designated R.

with the exception of the years 2002 and 2004, in frequencies of 8%–22%.
In contrast to ptxP1, ptxP3 was linked to two fim3 alleles,
fim3-1 and fim3-2 (linkage, respectively, 52% and 48%).
As was observed for ptxP1, ptxP3 was associated with prn1,
prn2 and prn3 (linkage 2%, 96%, 2%). Thus in contrast to
ptxP1, ptxP3 was mostly linked to prn2. Two predominant
MLSTs associated with ptxP3 were observed, MLST312 and
MLST322. MLST312 was found throughout the whole
period and predominated in 1998 and 2004 (frequencies
44% and 58%, respectively). MLST322 was first detected
in 1997 (frequency 6%) and predominated in the period
2000 to 2003 (frequencies 50% to 85%).
MLVA analyses
A collection of 222 clinical isolates from the period 1993
to 2004 were typed by MLVA and 38 types were found. Of
the 38 MLVA types, 6 have not been described before (see
Additional file 1). Most types (64%) were found in a single isolate only and these were combined into a single
group, designated R (Fig. 2). The remaining four types
MLVA26, MLVA27, MLVA29 and MLVA37 were found in
frequencies of, respectively, 4%, 41%, 30% and 4% in the

whole period. In the period 1993–2004, MLVA29 was
found in frequencies of 16%–58%, but was not observed
in 2001, 2003 and 2004 (Fig. 2). It was the predominant
type in the year 1996 (frequency 58%). MLVA27 was not
detected in 1995 and was observed in frequencies of 18%
to 78% in the other years. It was the predominant type
from 1999 to 2004. Compared to MLVA27 and MLVA29,
MLVA26 and MLVA37 were detected in much lower frequencies (3%–21%), and only in the years 1993–1999. In
1995 the highest frequency of minor types was observed
(50%).
The genetic diversity based on MLVA types showed a
decrease from approximately 80% in the early nineties to
42% in 2003 and 2004 (Fig. 3 and see Additional file 2).
The relationship between MLST and MLVA types was
investigated by constructing a minimum spanning tree
based on MLVA-types of 222 B. pertussis strains (Fig. 4).
Two main clusters were observed. The majority of the
strains in cluster 1 belonged to the related MLVA types 29
and 37. Most of the strains (94.7%) of MLVA type 29 and
37 had the ptxP1 allele (MLST-profiles 111, 112 or 113).
Similarly, most strains in cluster 2 belonged to the related

Temporal trends in MLVA frequencies of Dutch B. pertussis strains from 1993 to 2004. Frequencies of different
MLVA-types are shown. MLVA types found in frequencies lower than 1.6% in the whole period were combined into a single
group designated R.

MLVA types 27 and 26 and most (92%) of the strains of
these MLVA types carried ptxP3 allele (MLST-profiles 312
or 322).
CGH analyses
Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH) with the B. pertussis oligonucleotide microarray
based on the Tohama I genome was used for genomic
analyses of the ptxP1 and ptxP3 lineages in order to determine if they differed with respect to gene content. Fortythree Dutch clinical isolates, isolated in the period 1993–
2004, were analyzed with CGH, seventeen ptxP1 strains
and twenty-six ptxP3 strains. Complete hybridization profiles for twenty-five B. pertussis isolates are presented in
Fig. 5. Of the 3,581 genes spotted on the microarray, 98
(2.7%) were found to be absent in at least one of the B.
pertussis strains tested. The 98 genes were clustered in eight
contiguous loci or regions of difference (RDs) (Table 1).

All strains isolated between 1993 and 2004 contained a
deletion in two RDs relative to the Tohama I strain: RD-3
(23 genes, 24.9 kb) and RD-5(7 genes, 8.6 kb). The 22
gene products of RD-3 (see Additional file 3) were classi-

fied in gene class groups (Table 2). Four (17%) cell envelope proteins, three (13%) regulators and 2 (9%) proteins
involved in transport and binding were observed. Five
(22%) proteins were hypothetical proteins, seven (30%)
were proteins with an unclassified function. One gene
product (4.3%) is involved in central intermediary metabolism and one (4.3%) in energy metabolism. Four of the
genes (17%) were pseudo genes in Tohama I. The RD-5
contained seven genes (see Additional file 4), including
three (43%) genes, classified in the category transport and
binding, coding for proteins involved in iron transport
(Table 2). Two genes (29%) in RD-5 are pseudo genes in
Tohama I (Table 2). RD-3 and RD-5 are both flanked by
IS481 in Tohama I, on one side and both sides, respectively.
The ptxP1 and ptxP3 lineages were distinguished by RD10, a region comprising 18 genes and 22.7 kb (Table 2,
and see Additional file 5). RD-10 was present in all ptxP1
strains analyzed. The ptxP3 allele is linked to two fim3
alleles, fim3-1 and fim3-2, and RD-10 is absent in all
strains belonging to these lineages. Hierarchical clustering
based on CGH data using Pearson correlation grouped the

the 18 genes in RD-10 (see Additional file 5), four (21%)
genes were classified in energy metabolism, four (21%)
genes were involved in transport and binding. Further several single genes (5%) coded for a putative exported protein, a transcriptional regulator and a protein involved in
iron transport, respectively (Table 2). Five of the 18 genes

(26%) were pseudo genes in Tohama I. RD-10 is flanked
by IS481 elements on both sides in the Tohama I strain.
Four genes present in RD-10 (BP1955-BP1958) were
duplicated in the Tohama I genome at positions BP0579BP0582 [26]. In agreement with this, the log ratio values
for these genes in strains missing RD-10, were intermedi-

Minimum spanning tree based on MLVA of Dutch B. pertussis strains isolated from 1993 to 2004. Each circle represents a different MLVA-type, indicated by the number in the middle of the circle. The size of the circle is related to the
number of isolates within the particular MLVA-type. Green and red colors indicate, respectively the ptxP1 and ptxP3 allele frequencies within MLVA. The distribution of the MLST types is shown in boxes for the most commonly found MLVA types. In
some cases the MLST types are not 100% due to the fact that not all strains were types by MLST.

ate between those for genes which were absent or present
as a single copy, respectively. In contrast, identical log
ratios were observed between Tohama I and ptxP1 strains
indicating that the genes encoded by BP0579-BP0582 are
also present at positions BP1955-BP1958 in ptxP1 strains.

The presence of RD-10 was investigated with PCR in,
respectively, 20 and 35 additional ptxP1 and ptxP3 strains.
This set of strains included isolates from Denmark, Finland, France, Sweden and the Netherlands. In all cases the
absence of RD-10 was linked to the ptxP3 allele.

B. pertussis strains carrying the ptxP3 allele were isolated
for the first time in the Netherlands in 1988. In order to
analyze the homogeneity of the ptxP3 strains further, we
extended our microarray based CGH analysis to six strains
carrying the ptxP3 allele isolated prior to 1993 (data not
shown). As was observed for strains from the period 1993
to 2004, RD-10 was missing in all 6 strains. An additional
deletion of two genes (RD-1*, BP0515-BP0516) was
observed in four of the early ptxP3 strains. The genes in
BP0515 and BP0516 encode for a phage-related hypothetical protein and a hypothetical protein respectively (see
Additional file 6).

Interestingly, in strains missing RD-10, the PCR spanning
the deletion resulted in two distinct PCR fragments (sizes
approximately 1.9 and 2.9 kb). DNA sequencing showed
that in the 1.9 kb PCR fragment the genes flanking RD-10,
BP1946 and BP1969, were separated by one copy of
IS481, while in the 2.9 kb PCR fragment, two copies of the
IS481 separated these genes (data not shown). The second
type was found only in strains isolated in 1993–1997.
A number of RDs were found infrequently in 11 strains
analyzed with CGH and were not linked to a particular
lineage as defined by MLST or MLVA; RD-6 (19 genes,
18.7 kb), RD-27 (1 gene, 0.8 kb), RD-28 (2 genes, 1.7 kb),
RD-29 (17 genes, 16.9 kb) and RD-18 (9 genes, 9.4 kb)

The number of genes belonging to COG classes is indicated for each RD, for all RDs combined (Tot in RD) and for Tohama I [26]. In the last
column the % of each class present in all RDs relative to Tohama I is indicated.

(See also Additional files 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11). Sequencing
analysis showed that only part (0. 2 kb) of the RD-27 gene
was deleted. The five RDs contained 48 genes of which
four (8%) coded for proteins involved in transport and
binding, five (10%) for cell envelope proteins and four
(8%) for regulatory proteins. Seven (15%) of these 48
genes are pseudo genes (Table 2). All loci were flanked by
IS481 sequences on at least one side in the Tohama I
strain. RD-6, RD-28 and RD-29, were each found in a single strain belonging to the ptxP1 lineage. RD-27 was found
in 6 strains of the ptxP1 lineage. Finally, RD-18 was found
in both the ptxP1 lineage and the ptxP3 lineage in, respectively, 1 and 4 strains. The number of pseudo genes found
in the RDs (18%) was higher compared to the whole
genome (10%) [25].

Discussion
In the Netherlands the upsurge of pertussis was characterized by the expansion of strains carrying a novel allele for
the Ptx promoter (ptxP3), which completely replaced the
resident ptxP1 strains [20,21]. It is possible that the ptxP3

allele has increased bacterial fitness and contributed to
the upsurge of pertussis. However, the ptxP3 allele may
also be linked to other polymorphic loci important for fitness. In this study we have characterized the ptxP1 and
ptxP3 lineages using MLVA, MLST and CGH, to establish
genetic relationships and to identify loci uniquely associated with ptxP3 strains. Further, this study highlights the
microevolution of B. pertussis within closely related lineages.
The genetic diversity, based on MLVA frequencies, of the
B. pertussis population showed a gradual decrease in the
period 1993 to 2004 from 80% to 40%. This reflects the
expansion of ptxP3-fim3-2 strains, the population of
which was less diverse than the ptxP1-fim3-1 and ptxP3fim3-1 populations (genetic diversities, respectively, 44%,
63% and 71%). The low genetic diversity of the ptxP3fim3-2 population may reflect recent the expansion of a
single clone, consistent with its recent appearance in the
Dutch population.

The emergence of fim3-2 has also been observed in Canada and in Russia [18,19]. In view of the many surface
antigens expressed by B. pertussis, it is remarkable that a
single amino acid change in fim3 may affect the competitive balance between strains. The alleles for the Ptx S1 subunit and Prn code for protein variants which differ in one
to seven amino acids [9,27], yet large changes in allele frequencies have been observed over the years, also suggesting that minor mutations may have a noticeable effect on
strain fitness.
Consistent with studies from other groups [23,24,24,25],
we observed a number for RDs comprising large deletions
in B. pertussis isolates which were flanked by one or more
IS481 copies. A comparison of these studies is complicated by the different designations used for the RDs. We
propose a common nomenclature for the RDs observed in
B. pertussis according to the article by Brinig et al, [23]. In
the latter work, 26 RDs were described and we propose
that novel RDs should be numbered starting from RD-27.
Here RDs were numbered according to Brinig et al [23].
Most frequent were deletions in RD-3, RD-5 and RD-10.
RD-3 and RD-5 were absent from all analyzed strains isolated in the period 1993 to 2004. RD-5 contains several
genes that are predicted to be involved in iron uptake,
which is essential for survival of most bacteria in the host.
However, the B. pertussis genome contains several distinct
gene clusters involved in iron uptake not all of which may
be essential [26]. The absence of RD-10 was associated
with ptxP3 strains. RD-10 is comprised of 18 genes, four of
which are duplicated and found elsewhere in the Tohama
I chromosome: maleate cis-trans isomerase, a probable
hydrolase (a pseudo gene in Tohama I), a conserved
hypothetical protein and a putative isochorismatase.
CGH and PCR analyses indicated that these four genes are
duplicated in all strains analyzed belonging to the ptxP1
lineage. The duplication of part of RD-10 may have
allowed the preservation of genes important for fitness.
Among the RD-10 genes lost in the ptxP3 lineage are those
encoding for an ABC transporter system an iron uptake
protein a putative transcriptional regulator and a putative
exported protein. The deleted segment did not harbor any
known virulence-related genes, nevertheless some of these
genes may be involved in virulence. ABC transporter components can be surface associated and may be involved in
virulence [28].
In the ptxP3 strains the region flanking the RD-10 deletion
occurred in two forms. In one form the DNA regions
flanking the deletion were separated by one IS481 copy
and in the second form by two IS481 copies. The form
with two IS481 copies was found mostly in strains isolated in 1993–1997 but not in strains isolated after that
date. All strains isolated after 1998 were found to have the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/311

one copy of IS481 in this region. This suggests that the
form with two copies of the IS481 is the precursor form,
from which the second form arose after a second recombination step.
A number of RDs were deleted from one to six strains. The
RD-18 deletion was observed in two strains characterized
by the allele combinations ptxP1-fim3-1 and ptxP3-fim3-2,
respectively, and these deletions therefore may reflect
independent genetic events, suggesting that deleting RD18 is beneficial for the bacterium.
As yet it is not clear if and how these deletions affect fitness. As observed by others [23-25], we found the deleted
regions to be enriched for pseudo genes compared to the
genome, suggesting (part of) the deleted regions were not
essential. Further, the loss of (functional) genes may
increase fitness by lowering metabolic costs and the
number of immune targets. In several bacterial species
such as Shigella, Chlamydophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Yersinia pestis and Salmonella enterica, the absence of certain genes has been correlated with some beneficial effect
such as an increase in pathogenicity or the onset of virulence [29].

Conclusion
Based on the combined results of the three typing methods, we present a model for the evolution of the ptxP1 and
ptxP3 lineages (Fig. 6). It was assumed that point mutations preceded the deletion of RDs. Further variation in
Prn was not used to derive relationships between strains,
as it is caused by reversible insertion and deletion of
repeat units and hence not a useful long-term phylogenic
marker [9]. Thus the tree is mainly based on two point
mutations found in ptxP and fim3 resulting in three lineages, ptxP1-fim3-1, ptxP3-fim3-1 and ptxP3-fim3-2. The
assumption that variation in Prn occurs at relative high
frequency and is reversible, is reflected by the occurrence
of all three detected variants in the ptxP1-fim3-1 and
ptxP3-fim3-1 lineages (Fig. 6). However, the frequencies
clearly differ, Prn3 and Prn2 predominating in, respectively, ptxP1-fim3-1 and ptxP3-fim3-1. Most of the strains
in the ptxP3-fim3-2 lineage harbored Prn2 (98%), while
Prn1 was absent (Fig. 6). Clustering based on CGH and
MLVA both indicated that ptxP1 and ptxP3 strains represented distinct lineages. The ptxP3-fim3-1 and ptxP3-fim32 strains could not be distinguished by CGH or MLVA,
possibly reflecting recent decent from a common ancestor. Since ptxP3 was first detected relatively recently, in
1989, we presume that this allele was derived from ptxP1,
which predominated in the period 1950 to 1989. As fim32 was not detected before 1996, it seems likely that a
mutation in a ptxP3-fim3-1 strains resulted in the ptxP3fim3-2 lineage, and this was indicated in Fig. 6. We cannot
exclude the alternative hypothesis, however, that the ptxP3

Model for the evolution of the Bordetella pertussis ptxP1 and ptxP3 lineages
Model for the evolution of the Bordetella pertussis ptxP1 and ptxP3 lineages. The tree is mainly based on two point
mutations found in ptxP and fim3 resulting in three lineages, ptxP1-fim3-1, ptxP3-fim3-1 and ptxP3-fim3-2. A single strain carrying
the ptxP1-fim3-4 alleles was not included. The deleted regions are indicated in boxes and the frequency in the population is

allele arose twice, in a fim3-1 and fim3-2 background. An
event which occurred before the branching off of ptxP3,
was the deletion of RD-3 and RD-5, two regions which are
absent from all the Dutch strains analyzed from the
period 1993 to 2004. The absence of RD-10 was characteristic for the ptxP3 lineage suggesting that its deletion preceded the point mutation in ptxP3 or that it occurred early
in the history of this lineage (as assumed in Fig. 6). It is
also possible that the deletion conferred a strong selective
advantage resulting in clonal expansion and replacement
of ptxP3 strains still harboring RD-10. An analysis of
strains from different European countries by PCR also
revealed that RD-10 was absent in ptxP3 strains. Conversely, RD-10 was present in all European ptxP1 strains
studied (results not shown).
Brinig et al. [23], also analyzed Dutch ptxP1 strains with
CGH and did not observe deletion of RD-10 in these
strains. This study did not include any Dutch ptxP3 strains.
Strains in which RD-10 was deleted were found in Australia, Italy and the USA [23]. Similarly, Caro et al. [24]
and Heikkinen et al. [25] described the loss of RD-10 in B.
pertussis isolates in French and Finnish strains (designated
RD-4 and locus 3, respectively). In the latter paper the loss
of RD-10 was found in all strains of a certain PFGE profile
(SR11) that is associated with nationwide epidemics. It

would be interesting to determine if in other countries
RD-10 loss is linked to ptxP3 as shown in our study.

Methods
Strains
B. pertussis isolates were selected from the strain collection
of the Dutch National Institute of Public Health. For this
study we focused on B. pertussis isolates isolated between
1993 and 2004. The selection criteria included the location of isolation and serotype. A total of 222 strains were
used for MLVA-typing [20], 133 for MLST typing [9,13],
and 43 for CGH analysis (See Additional file 12). The
strains selected for CGH analysis were all typed with
MLVA and MLST and were representative of the most
prevalent MLVA- and MLST-types from 1993 to 2004. This
work does not require approval of the ethical commission.
MLVA- typing and MLST-typing
MLVA typing was essentially performed as described previously in Schouls et al, 2004). For MLST, gene fragments
of the pertactin gene (prn), the pertussis toxin promoter
(ptxP) and the fimbriae 3 gene (fim3) were sequenced
essentially as described previously [15,18,20]. For the
MLST designation the different fim3 alleles were numbered as follows: fim3A = fim3-1, fim3B = fim3-2, fim3C =

Page 10 of 14

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:311

fim3-3 and fim3A* = fim3-4. For each strain, every unique
sequence of the ptxP, fim3 and prn loci received a distinct
allele number. The compositions of these loci were
expressed in an allelic profile based on the allele numbers.
E.g. ptxP3-fim3-1-prn2, was abbreviated to 312. The MLVA
and MLST profiles were clustered with the Bionumerics
software by using a categorical coefficient and a graphing
method called minimum spanning tree [20].
Culture of strains and DNA isolation
The B. pertussis strains used for microarray analysis in this
study are listed in Additional file 12. Strains were cultured
for 72 hours on Bordet-Gengou agar plates at 35°C. Subsequently, they were grown at 35°C in Verweij medium
(NVI, Netherlands) with 200 μg ml-1 heptakis (2,6-di-omethyl)-β-cyclodextrine for 24 hours while being shaken
at 200 rpm. Chromosomal DNA was isolated using the
Promega Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit
(Promega, Madison, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The precipitated DNA was dissolved
in 100 μl of EB (elution buffer, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0) (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
B. pertussis DNA array design and construction
70-mer oligonucleotides were selected from the complete
genome sequence of B. pertussis strain Tohama I in collaboration with OPERON by using microarray probe design
methodology as described by OPERON [30]. Each oligonucleotide was designed with an optimal specificity and
sensitivity to its target gene and has an optimized Tm
value. A total of 3751 unique 70-mer oligonucleotides,
representing 94% of the genes of a B. pertussis Tohama I
strain, were chosen to form the microarray. In addition,
97 oligonucleotides derived from intergenic sequences
and 34 control oligonucleotides were included in the
microarray. All oligonucleotides were dissolved in 50%
dimethyl sulfoxide and spotted on UltraGAPS coated
slides in three replicates (Corning, NY, USA) by ServiceXS
(Leiden, Netherlands).
Labeling of genomic DNA
For each CGH hybridization we labeled the DNA of a test
strain and the reference strain ATCC BAA-589 Tohama I.
We mixed 4 μg chromosomal DNA of B. pertussis with 20
μl of the 2.5 × Random Primer Mix (BioPrime DNA labeling kit; Invitrogen) in a total volume of 41 μl of water,
boiled the mixture for 5 minutes, and then placed it on
ice. The samples were centrifuged for 2 minutes at 13,200
rpm and were mixed with 5 μl 10× dNTP mix [2 mM
dATP, dCTP and dGTP, 0.5 mM dTTP (Roche)], 2.5 μl of
1 mM Cy3 dUTP (for reference strain) or Cy5 dUTP (for
the test strain) (Amersham Biosciences, UK) and 1 μl Klenow polymerase (40 U μl-1) (BioPrime DNA labeling kit;
Invitrogen). The samples were incubated for 3 hours at
37°C. Subsequently, the test and reference samples were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/311

purified separately using CyScribe GFX Purification Kit
(Amersham Biosciences, UK) and then eluted in 60 μl elution buffer. The incorporation of the Cy dyes in the
labeled target sequences was measured with a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). For each
CGH experiment equal amounts of Cy3 dye (reference)
and Cy5 dye (test) were used. The volume of the samples
was decreased using a speedvac concentrator (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, USA). The labeled test and reference samples were mixed together with 79.2 μl of
hybridization solution [3.44 × SSC (Invitrogen), 0.32 %
SDS (Invitrogen), 1.0 mg yeast tRNA/ml]. Before loading
on the microarray the hybridization solution was heated
for 3 minutes at 100°C and 5.8 μl of 10 × DIG blocking
buffer was added.
Microarray hybridization
Before hybridization of the microarrays, 600 mJ of UV
energy was applied to the Corning microarrays using a
UV-chamber (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) and the
microarrays were prehybridized for 45–60 minutes at
42°C in pre-warmed prehybridization solution (5× SSC,
0.1% SDS and 0.1 mgml-1 BSA). The prehybridized microarrays were washed twice for 5 minutes with 0.1× SSC at
room temperature. Finally the microarrays were washed
with purified water for 30 seconds and were dried by
blowing air with a Quick-Dry-filtered Air Gun (Matrix
Technologies Corporation, Hudson, NH, USA). The
labeled DNA hybridization mixture was applied to the
microarray using lifterslip coverslips and hybridization
was carried out in a Genemachines Hybchamber
(Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) for 14–18
hours at 60°C in a water bath. The arrays were then disassembled in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C and washed for 5
minutes with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, in a hybridization oven
at 60°C, followed by two washes 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for
5 minutes at room temperature and four washes with 0.1×
SSC at room temperature for one minute. Finally the
slides were washed for 10 seconds in 0.01× SSC and then
dried using a Quick-Dry-filtered Air Gun (Matrix Technologies Corporation, Hudson, NH, USA). Slides were
scanned using a ScanArray 4000XL microarray scanner
(Packard BioChip Technologies/Perkin Elmer) equipped
with ScanArray express software.

Eighteen and 25 strains analyzed were hybridized at 42°C
and 60°C, respectively. Essentially identical results were
obtained, but the higher wash temperature resulted in a
lower background and these results are shown in Fig. 5.
All subsequent washes were performed according to the
manufacturer's instruction (Corning, NY, USA).
Image and Data analysis
The images were analyzed using Genepix Pro 5.1 software
(Axon Instruments). Two-color array image data were

submitted to an in-house microarray database. Raw
microarray signal data (no background subtracted) were
collected from the database, and after exclusion of control
and blank spots the data were normalized in R [31]. The
normalization employed a four-step approach consisting
of: (1) log2-transformation, (2) quantile normalization of
all scans, (3) calculating log2 (Cy5/Cy3) ratios per spot,
and (4) taking the median from replicate spots. Visualizing the normalized log2-ratios as density plots and quantile-quantile plots showed an approximately normal
distribution with an average of 0.012 and a standard deviation of 0.315. Based on this normal distribution, setting
a cutoff for deletion at -1 would predict deleted genes with
a False Discovery Rate (FDR, [32]) of 7.7 %; setting the
cutoff at -1.5 corresponds to a FDR of 0.014%. On the
basis of preliminary PCR validations, we determined a
cutoff for the normalized intensity ratio of < -1.5, indicating the absence of the gene. These genes were selected for
further analysis with PCR or sequence analysis. The combined normalized data were visualized with TIGR MultiExperimentViewer [33]. The logarithm of the
hybridization ratio [log2 (Cy5/Cy3)] is indicated in the
yellow-black-blue color scale. [log2 (Cy5/Cy3)] = -3 = Yellow, [log2 (Cy5/Cy3)] = 0 = Black, [log2 (Cy5/Cy3)] = +3
= Blue.
PCR confirmation and sequence analysis
PCR analysis was employed in order to confirm the results
predicted by the microarray hybridizations. The PCR
primers were designed to target the flanking regions of
each deletion so that the amplified region spanned the

missing locus. The primers used in this study are listed in
Table 3. The PCRs were performed under the following
conditions: 20 μl total reaction volume, 10 μl Hotstart
(Qiagen), 10 pmol of each primer (Eurogentec, Seraing,
Belgium), 10 ng chromosomal DNA and 5% DMSO or
1.0 M Betaine (Sigma, St. Louis, USA). The amplification
was carried out in a Geneamp PCR system 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) according
manufacturer's recommendations. After amplification, 10
μl of each PCR product was observed via 1% agarose gel
electrophoresis with SYBR-Safe (Molecular Probes,
Carlsbad, USA) staining. To determine the deletion
boundaries, PCR products were purified using ExoSAP-IT®
(USB, Cleveland, USA). Subsequently the purified PCR
products were sequenced using standard Big Dye Terminator v 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Nucleotide sequencing was performed with an Applied
Biosystems 3700 DNA Analyzer. Sequence data obtained
from the ABI-3700 was compared to the B. pertussis
sequence Tohama I using the DNA-sequence analysis program KODON to determine the precise location of each
deletion.
