Abstract
Background: Among Coffea species, C. canephora has the widest natural distribution area in
tropical African forests. It represents a good model for analyzing the geographical distribution of
diversity in relation to locations proposed as part of the "refuge theory". In this study, we used both
microsatellite (simple sequence repeat, SSR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
markers to investigate the genetic variation pattern of C. canephora in the Guineo-Congolean
distribution zone.
Results: Both markers were first compared in terms of their informativeness and efficiency in a
study of genetic diversity and relationships among wild C. canephora genotypes. As expected, SSR
markers were found to have a higher genetic distance detection capacity than RFLP. Nevertheless,
similarity matrices showed significant correlations when Mantel's test was carried out (r = 0.66, p
< 0.0001). Finally, both markers were equally effective for group discrimination and phylogenetic
studies, but SSR markers tended to outperform RFLP markers in discriminating the source of an
individual among diversity groups and in putative hybrid detection. Five well defined genetic groups,
one in the Upper Guinean forests, the four others in the Lower Guinean forests, were identified,
corresponding to geographical patterning in the individuals.
Conclusion: Our data suggested that the Dahomey Gap, a biogeographical barrier, played a role
in wild C. canephora differentiation. Climatic variations during the Pleistocene and/or Holocene
probably caused the subgroup differentiation in the Congolese zone through the presence of a
mosaic of putative refugia. Recent hybridization between C. canephora diversity groups, both for
spontaneous individuals and cultivars, was further characterised according to their geographic
dissemination or breeding history as a consequence of human activities.

Background
The species richness in some African zones has attracted
attention on the origin of diversification in tropical forests
[1-4]. In particular, the Guineo-Congolean regional center

of endemism (Zone I on White's map, 1983) includes
about 8,000 spp., about 80% of which are endemic. This
zone also corresponds to one of the 34 biodiversity
hotspots defined by Mittermeier et al. [5]: the Guinean

forests, divided into the Upper Guinean and Lower Guinean forests by the Dahomey Gap. Analyses of patterns of
geographical distribution of species richness and endemism of extant organisms could partly help in understanding these species composition patterns [e.g. [3]].
Species richness in the tropics has been attributed to the
gradual accumulation and/or preservation of species over
a long geological period in stable equatorial climates (the
"museum model") [6-8] and/or to high speciation rates in
response to late Tertiary geological events and unstable
Pleistocene climates [9,10]. In fact, all major glacial
advances in the Arctic resulted in great paleoenvironment
and vegetation variations in the African tropics [2]. At
least for the most recently evolved taxa, a certain amount
of speciation and a great deal of subspeciation is said to
have occurred during the late Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, especially since the last severe glaciation which
cumulated around 18,000 B.P. [11]. To explain how
plants and animal species survived during particularly
cold and arid periods, Maley [2] proposed putative refugia, where the respective ancestors of the present species
formed isolated populations, leading to allopatric, or geographical speciation [12]. Some of the refugia were
located along the West African coast from Sierra Leone to
Côte d'Ivoire, from southwestern Cameroon to western
Gabon, in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (formerly Zaire) and along the Zaire river [2].
Through a study of the African Rubiaceae genera distribution, Robbrecht [13] gave additional support in favour of
the refuge area concept, and demonstrated the importance
of fluvial refugia in some taxa.
Molecular phylogenies and species-level diversity could
be used to further unravel the forest diversification patterns. A population-genetics rather than a species-level
approach has also been proposed to test the role of the relatively recent time frame of Pleistocene events [14]. Climatic changes have affected the genetic structure of many
tree species in Europe [e.g. [15-17]]. For Africa, major
advances are under way for vertebrates [e.g. [14,18]], but
very few studies have focused on tree species of West and
Central Africa [19-22], and only one has attempted to
establish the relationship between the molecular genetic
variation of a tree species, i.e. the shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa), and the possible evolution of vegetation after the
last glaciations in the Sudano-Sahelian region of Africa
[19].
Coffea species (Rubiaceae) are endemic to intertropical
forest zones in Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius, Comoros
and Réunion [23-27]. There are over 103 accepted species,
including the two most commonly cultivated species, C.
arabica L. and C. canephora Pierre ex A. Froehn [28].
Within C. arabica, a predominantly self-pollinating (autogamous) species, there is a genetic structure with low dif-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/167

ferentiation between accessions from the east and west
side of the Great Rift Valley in Ethiopia as recently
revealed with microsatellites [29]. The hybrid origin of C.
arabica with C. canephora and C. eugenioides as the likely
progenitors [30] was probably recent, and its colonization
of Ethiopia likely occurred after the formation of the Great
Rift Valley [31]. The systematic position and geographic
distribution of C. arabica is isolated among diploid Coffea
species [27,28]. On the contrary, C. canephora is one of the
two Coffea species, along with C. liberica Hiern[28,32],
with the widest natural distribution area of the genus.
Moreover, these species are both diploid, allogamous
(self-incompatible), and belong to the same phylogenetic
clade [27]. They present overlapping geographical distributions, which extend west to east from Guinea to
Uganda, and north to south from Cameroon to Angola
[28,33]. This feature represents an exceptional resource
for understanding the evolution and adaptation of tropical trees in these regions.
Few studies have been undertaken to assess the genetic
diversity of natural C. canephora populations. Allozymic
surveys revealed marked geographical clustering for two
groups: the "Guinean" group, composed of populations
from Côte d'Ivoire, and the "Congolese" group, consisting
of two subgroups, SG1 and SG2, with populations from
the Central African Republic and Cameroon [33,34].
Based on RFLP data, five wild C. canephora groups were
further distinguished and the diversity structure was
found to be conserved even when cultivated material,
known as Robusta coffee, was included in the analysis
[35]. Due to the increase in the number of microsatellite
markers suitable for coffee species analyses [e.g. [36-38]],
PCR-based assays are becoming increasingly attractive
and compatible with the requirements of evolutionary
studies or conservation genetics on large sets of genotypes.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based marker systems
like simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been widely
used in recent years, replacing restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) in DNA fingerprinting [39]. However, few studies have been carried out to compare the efficiency of RFLP and SSR markers for characterizing genetic
diversity [40]. Both techniques offer the advantage of
implementing nuclear co-dominant, locus-specific markers dispersed throughout the genome. Polymorphism
detected by RFLP assays reflects restriction size variations,
while microsatellite variants differ in the number of short
(1–6 bp) amplified tandem repeats [41]. Their use in the
assessment of population genetic structure has both
advantages and drawbacks. While RFLPs assay are time
consuming and labor intensive, among PCR-based markers, microsatellites require sequence information for
primer pair design but, once developed, they are highly
transferable across species, especially within the genus

[e.g. [42,43]]. Because of their extremely high level of polymorphism, they are probably the most efficient markers
for fingerprinting, assignment tests or paternity analyses
[44]. Differences in the resolution power of RFLP and SSR
loci are thus expected because of differences in their mutation rates and processes. The simultaneous use of these
molecular methods could help in inferring the signature
of natural histories of organisms at different time scales,
i.e. evolutionary history and historic migration patterns.
Moreover, the recent development of Bayesian
approaches in assignment tests, as implemented in STRUCTURE[45], has greatly increased the potential for understanding population structure.
In the present study, we investigated Coffea canephora
genetic diversity across the West and Central African geographic range of the species. Spontaneous individuals are
naturally distributed in two postulated refugia areas, i.e.
the Upper Guinea and Lower Guinea/Congo regions, separated by the Dahomey Gap. Using both SSRs and RFLP
loci, we evaluated the relative efficiency of these DNAbased marker systems, associated with different mutation
rates, in resolving genetic diversity, population structure
and gene flow among samples of C. canephora.
The final aims were:
(i) to analyse the C. canephora genetic variability structure
and assess any relationship between the molecular variation of the species and the possible signature of the past
evolution of vegetation in the Guineo-Congolian region
of Africa
(ii) to evaluate the impact of human agricultural activities
on gene flow, dispersal and migration of both wild and
cultivated stocks through the detection of putative interdiversity group hybrids
(iii) to define core sets of C. canephora accessions that best
capture the species diversity in terms of alleles.

Results
Efficiency of RFLP and SSR markers for polymorphism
detection
In the 107 sampled Coffea canephora accessions (Figure 1,
table 1, and table 2), genetic polymorphism indexes (Na,
HO and HE) at the 16 SSR loci and 8 RFLP loci were found
to be highly variable throughout all geographic samples
and types (Table 3). A total of 154 alleles across the SSR
loci were detected, giving an average of 9.6 alleles per
locus, ranging from 3 at M804 to 20 at M368. In comparison, the RFLP loci analysed gave 59 alleles with an average of 7.4 alleles per locus. The PIC value and gene
diversity were quite even for SSR and RFLP loci, i.e. 0.62
vs. 0.59 and 0.65 vs. 0.63, respectively.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/167

Structure of C. canephora natural diversity
Dissimilarity matrices were constructed on the whole
sample based on shared-allele distances and revealed that
the average genetic dissimilarities for RFLP (0.604) and
SSR (0.626) markers were very similar. The average
genetic dissimilarities obtained for the wild genotypes
were also similar for both marker types, RFLPs (0.581)
and SSRs (0.595). The correlation coefficient obtained
with Mantel's test matrix correspondence test was, indeed,
statistically significant (r = 0.66, p < 0.0001).

Genetic distance estimates obtained from the wild genotypes were used to derive Neighbour-joining trees for both
the RFLP and SSR data. The topology of each tree (Figure
2) was unique but both trees discriminated the five a priori
genetic groups (A, B, C, D, and E) from Dussert et al. [35].
Nevertheless, the SSR tree was not completely congruent
with the RFLP tree. One difference was that group C,
which occupied an intermediate position on the tree
based on SSRs, occurred at a more distant position from
groups [B-E-A] within group D based on RFLPs. Another
contrast was noted with respect to the A individuals which
clustered together near the E group based on SSRs and one
of its individuals fell into the group E, based on RFLPs.
The internal branches were generally longer for the RFLP
tree. Despite these differences, both tree topologies
reflected the same distinct clades, corresponding to a geographical patterning in the individuals. Plants from Côte
d'Ivoire mostly clustered with plants from Guinea (group
D). Individuals from northwest Congo, southeast Cameroon, and southwest Central African Republic fell within
the same clade (group C), in line with their geographic
proximities in Central Africa. The plants of Central African
group C clustered near plants from West Africa (group D).
From the eastern part of the geographical distribution,
plants from northeast Congo clustered with plants from
southeast Cameroon and south Central African Republic
(group E), near plants from the southern border of Central African Republic (group B). The genotypes of a population from northwest Congo and a population from
southwest Cameroon (group A) clustered near the B and
E clades. Several individuals (marked with asterisks)
appeared to be classified with groups other than their a
priori groups. We performed a population structure analysis to further assess the group memberships of the plants
and to detect actual migrants, hybrids or misclassified
individuals.
The structure analysis using STRUCTURE with admixture
showed that the five groups (K = 5) were genetically distinct based on SSR data (Figure 3). The results indicated
that most of the plants had a high membership in their
own cluster, with 97, 97, 69, 90, and 92% mean ancestry
for the A, B, C, D, and E groups, respectively. In comparison, with the RFLP data, plants from groups B, C, and D

formed separated clusters with high membership in their
own cluster (87, 91 and 88% on average, respectively).
However, mixed ancestry between groups A and E at even
proportions (A and E contributing to 50 and 44% ancestry
on average) was observed, corresponding to a grouping by
geographical regions. For this mixed group, we considered
that plants possessing <80% ancestry in the [A+E] cluster
were putative hybrids. Despite this discrepancy, the level

of admixture per group was very low and similarly estimated by both markers (Table 4). Eight genotypes were
identified as admixed by SSRs, with over 20% ancestry
from other groups. Five of them were also identified by
RFLPs. Some of these putative hybrids, 4/7 and 2/5
detected by SSRs and RFLPS, respectively, were confirmed
with the reassignment test implemented in GENECLASS2
(Table 4). The five individuals identified as putative

contained >20% group E or group A ancestry (Table 4).
On the RFLP tree, these individuals nested within the
same clade, with an intermediate position on the between
groups [A-B-E] and [C-D]. They occurred at the base of the
D clade on the SSR tree. The individual AC663, classified
a priori in group A, and identified as a putative AE hybrid
with RFLPs, fell into the group E cluster in the RFLP tree.
The genetic differentiation of wild C. canephora groups,
evaluated with FST values, were found to be higher for

RFLPs compared to SSRs, with 0.50 vs. 0.33, respectively
(Table 5). Pairwise RFLP-based or SSR-based FST values
ranged from 0.29 to 0.67 and from 0.20 to 0.50, respectively, with substantially lower FST values within regions
than between regions. Group D (West Africa) showed the
highest levels of differentiation detected with all other
groups with both marker types, whereas the A-B and E-B
comparisons (groups from Central Africa), gave the lowest FST values with RFLP and SSR data, respectively. Mantel's tests revealed that pairwise FST estimates among
samples calculated from SSRs were not significantly differ-

permutations).
Cultivated sample origin
When the cultivated genotypes were included in the
neighbour-joining tree construction, the topology of the
trees in five groups could not be identified appropriately
with RFLPs and the clusters were even less separated using
SSRs (data not shown). Since some of the cultivated
plants might be of putative hybrid origin (Table 2,
"hybrid" group), we assessed the cultivated genotype origin by population structure analysis.

Assignment tests using GENECLASS were first performed to
assess genotypic similarities of the cultivated plants with

respect to the five wild genetic reference groups. Using
RFLPs, of the 46 cultivated plants, 10 (22%), 13 (28%)
and one (2%) were assigned to groups A, E, and D, respectively, whereas the remaining individuals (48%) were all
unassigned. In comparison, SSRs only assigned 8 (17%),
9 (20%) and one (2%) individuals to groups A, E, and D,
respectively, whereas 28 (61%) remained unassigned.
Considering the overall dataset, assigned cultivated individuals, except for three of them, were correctly classified
within their a priori group of origin with both RFLP and
SSR data. Genetic groups B and C were not represented by
cultivated genotypes. None of the a priori group D individuals were reassigned to D, suggesting a possible mixed
ancestry origin.

Dussert et al. [35]. The colour bars represent percentages of ancestry from the different groups observed in one individual.

Genetic admixture analysis was conducted with STRUCTURE using the overall dataset with both cultivated and
wild plants, while excluding wild individuals from group
B. The four groups (K = 4) observed, corresponding to
groups A, C, D, and E, were found to be genetically distinct with either RFLPs or SSRs. The mean proportion of
population membership of wild genotypes to their own
clusters was 72, 84, 90, and 92%, for groups A, C, D and
E, respectively, using RFLPs; and 69, 82, 89, and 93% for
groups A, C, D and E, respectively, using SSRs. This confirmed that the previously defined genetic groups were
still responsible for the observed population structure,
even after the addition of cultivated individuals.
Admixture analysis with RFLPs of individual genotypes
identified hybrids among individuals from a priori group

A (3/14 = 21%) and a priori group E (8/24 = 33%). All
plants from a priori group D were detected as hybrids
between groups D and E. In comparison, the SSR analysis
detected slightly more hybrids with 4/14 = 29% in a priori
group A, 13/24 = 54% in a priori group E, and all plants
from a priori group D.
Most of the hybrids 13/17 = 76% and 13/23 = 57%, for
RFLPs and SSRs, respectively, were identified as originating from hybridization between a priori groups D (West
Africa) and E (Central Africa). These hybrids shared an
equivalent average fraction of ancestry from both groups
(49%D-45%E with RFLPs and 43%D-48%E with SSRs),
suggesting that most of them could be classified as first
generation hybrids.

The combined data analysis of cultivated coffee trees
using both marker types and both population structure
analyses allowed us to identify the putative hybrid origin
of many cultivated plants (25/46 = 54%) (Table 2).
Principal coordinate plots representing the genetic similarity between wild and cultivated C. canephora for SSRs
are presented in Figure 4 on the basis of SSR data. The variance explained by the first two axes was greater for RFLPs
than for SSRs (45.2% vs. 16.7%). However, on both plots,
wild individuals were genetically distinct, with no overlap
of the five genetic groups. The distribution of cultivated
individuals overlapped that of wild groups, with putative
hybrids located at intermediate positions.

Discussion
Our analysis of C. canephora genetic diversity through
RFLP and SSR markers revealed a marked geographic
structure in subgroups, which could be interpreted with a
broad scope of regional and historical influences. The
detection of inter-diversity group putative hybrids
allowed us to evaluate the influence of humankind on the
original natural distribution and the occurrence of gene
flow between wild and cultivated stocks.

Core set selection
We selected core sets of both wild and cultivated accessions from C. canephora that capture the maximum
number of SSR or RFLP alleles for sample sizes 12 and 25.
Core sets of 12 captured 48/59 and 103/154 of the RFLP
and SSR alleles, respectively. Gene diversity in each core
set was equivalent to that found in the entire sample
(Table 6). Each core set contained wild and cultivated
accessions from the different groups, and a substantial
fraction of putative hybrids.

The choice of the appropriate marker for any specific
study depends principally on the purpose of the research
and the biology and genetic structure of the species. The
recent development of assignment tests based on Bayesian
approaches [45-47] has greatly increased the potential for
understanding population structure across its diversity

Principal component analysis of wild and cultivated C. canephora accessions based on their SSR polymorphism.
The first axis represents 10% of the variation and the second one represents 6.5% of the variation. The wild C. canephora accessions are represented by colored symbols (A, B, C, D, E). The cultivated accessions assigned to wild genetic groups are represented by empty corresponding symbols (cA, cD, cE). The individuals identified as putative hybrids are represented by a cross

range. In parallel to our SSR study, we thus re-analysed the
RFLP data from Dussert et al. [35] on the same accessions
to better compare and assess the associated diversity.
RFLP – SSR comparison
Direct marker system comparison
The genetic data parameters obtained in this study from
SSRs were first compared with those obtained with RFLPs.

One of the greatest differences between the two categories
of markers concerns their respective polymorphism levels.
Estimates of genetic variability HE and PIC-values, were
higher for SSRs than those calculated from RFLPs. This difference in allele variation reflects differences in mutation
level: replication slippage is indeed thought to occur more
frequently than single nucleotide mutations and insertion/deletion events. RFLP loci are thus characterized by
lower mutation rates as compared to SSRs, whose mutation rates can range from 10-3 to 10-4 depending on their
genomic position [48]. Levels of polymorphism detected
with RFLP and SSR markers have been compared in soybean [40], also indicating the hypervariability of SSR loci
and greater expected heterozygosity.
The higher mutation rates of SSRs also had an effect on
genetic distance values. The dissimilarity values taken over

all pairwise comparisons were on average higher for SSRs
(0.63) than for RFLPs (0.60). However, the comparison of
both dissimilarity matrices revealed that estimates based
on RFLPs and SSRs were highly correlated (r = 0.66, p <
0.0001), indicating congruence between the assays. As a
consequence of the mutation rates, the PCO gave a higher
percentage of variation explained by the two first axes
with RFLPs than for SSRs (45.2% vs. 16.7%), indicating a
better separation of groups with fewer multilocus genotypes. However, both plots gave similar resolution in the
distinction between individuals of the different groups.
Our two NJ trees mainly gave congruent results.
Discriminatory power and assignment capacity
The overall information generated by both markers to
facilitate the determination of phylogenetic relationships
and classifications, cluster analysis and population structure analysis in the C. canephora gene pool was further
assessed. Indeed, the differences in mutation rates would
also likely affect the power of the different markers to
detect population differentiation.

In our data, overall and pairwise FST estimates obtained
with RFLPs were higher than those obtained with SSRs.
However, in spite of the differences, SSR and RFLP multilocus FST estimates were not significantly different (R =

0.72) when computed over the entire set of samples. In
fact, the high level of polymorphism, typical of SSRs, may
induce downward bias in the population differentiation
estimates. The degree of differentiation assessed through
SSRs, and thus the FST values, are expected to be lower
than those calculated using RFLPs [49]. A marked population subdivision similar to that noted in our study was
also found at RFLP loci in brown trout [50] and soybean
[40]. Moreover, the consistency of our results obtained
from both markers is congruent with the findings of the
other study comparing SSR and RFLP variation [40].
Finally, the RFLP and SSR multilocus diversity structure
analysis divided wild coffee trees into largely concurrent
five groups, with main branches on the individual neighbour-joining tree. Comparable diversity structuring was
obtained, e.g. in terms of distinguishing geographical origins from West Africa and Central Africa.
At a smaller geographical scale, RFLPs and SSRs showed a
different resolution power in detecting the genetic struc-

ture in the wild samples. The Bayesian analysis using
STRUCTURE revealed five clearly distinct groups with SSR
data, while samples from the southwest Cameroon/northwest Congo region–a priori groups A and E–were clustered
with the RFLP data. A higher membership in their own
cluster was obtained with SSRs (89% vs. 72% mean ancestry over all wild groups with SSRs and RFLPs, respectively). Moreover, the SSR data allowed the identification
of slightly more admixed plants, putatively hybrids, both
within the wild and cultivated pools. The GENECLASS
assignment test, which has been shown to be effective
even if clusters are not in HWE, gave congruent results.
In conclusion, SSR markers outperformed RFLP markers
in terms of discriminatory power in cluster analyses and
assignment tests. Moreover, SSRs were also more efficient
in discriminating the source of an individual genotype
among putative diversity groups on a local scale. This
advantage of SSR markers when analysing genetic affinities at individual levels was also demonstrated in a study

comparing SSR and allozyme markers in brown trout
[50].
C. canephora genetic diversity and history
Organisation of C. canephora natural diversity
The genetic structure analysis carried out on the African
samples of wild C. canephora using RFLPs and SSRs
revealed marked separation between the West and Central
African samples corresponding, in their composition, to
the Guinean and Congolese groups of Berthaud [33]. This
marked separation might be related both to the large geographical distances and to historical events. Indeed, the
last glaciations and the subsequent migration from various Pleistocene refugia had caused large-scale changes in
vegetation patterns, most notably around the Dahomey
Gap and Cross River [2]. The western forests from Guinea
and Côte d'Ivoire are separated from the Central forests of
Cameroon, Central African Republic and Congo by the
current 300 km wide Dahomey Gap, which is known to
be an important biogeographic barrier. This area is
thought to have become an extremely arid and much
wider area during the last glacial maxima, around 18,000
BP, separating the forest refuges of southwest Ghana and
west Cameroon [2]. Divergence through this geographical
isolation might have led to genetic differentiation of the
C. canephora populations. When analysing C. liberica,
another Coffea species with the same geographical distribution, N'Diaye et al. [32] reported that the two varieties
C. liberica var. liberica Bull. ex Hiern and C. liberica var.
dewevrei (De Wild. & T. Durand) Lebrun, had high
genetic differentiation and were characterised by marked
reproductive barriers between the two varieties, with a
pollen viability of their F1 hybrids similar to that of interspecific hybrids. However, although highly differentiated,
the West (group D) and Central African (A, B, C, and E)
groups of C. canephora present fully interfertile individuals
(see below). This suggested that the two main C. canephora
diversity groups do not present a state in the speciation
process as advanced as that of the two C. liberica varieties.
Phylogenetic studies have indeed revealed the role of the
Dahomey Gap on lineage origins in the Upper Guinea
regions [27,51]. But a similar distinct evolutionary split
between populations in Upper Guinea and those of Lower
Guinea across the Dahomey Gap has also been observed
in shea tree species [19] and in Fire-crested Alethe birds
[52].

The refugia scenario concerning the African Guineo-Congolian rainforest is supported by the fact that a similar
speciation pattern has been observed in various genera
[reviewed in [4]], particularly in African Rubiaceae genera
[13]. Isolation of populations in refugia was also suggested to influence divergent adaptations and diversification at the species level [e.g. [14,18]]. Within the Central
African zone, the distribution of the four C. canephora

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/167

groups (A, B, C, and E) showed a complex pattern. This
regional pattern of differentiation could be interpreted as
evidence of cycles of fragmentation and subsequent
expansion of forest habitats. The Congolese region consisted of a mosaic of several Pleistocene refugia [2] that
might explain the pattern of genetic diversity in the Central African zone. Although it is difficult to precisely localise the refugia, the reconstructed hypothesized areas [2]
were found to be related to species diversification. For
example, Anthony et al. [14] suggested a role of these
Pleistocene refugia in structuring gorilla genetic diversity.
For C. canephora, the refugia origin of sub-group E is most
likely located in the Congo-Zaïre basin (Figure 5). Meanwhile, the C. canephora group C might derive from the
expansion of the Biafran forest refugia, inside curve of the
Gulf of Guinea, from Cross River to Sanaga River (west
Cameroon sensu lato). The late Holocene phase of dramatic climatic disturbance could also have been favourable for C. canephora diversification in Central Africa.
Culminating about 2,500 years ago, it led to a catastrophic
reduction in central African rainforests, in the region of
south Cameroun, south Central African Republic, Gabon
and Congo, and still exerts a major influence on the
present forest vegetation distribution [53]. This event
involved a brutal extension of savannas, favourable for
the expansion of pioneering species such as oil palm [54].
The return of wetter conditions favourable for forest reinvasion began around 2,000 years B.P. from residual forests. This climatic disturbance caused fragmentation of
the ancient Okoume (Aucoumea klaineana) distribution
area into two subgroups, as suggested by the two tree varieties observed at the molecular level [21]. This process
could also have produced the spatial genetic structuring of
C. canephora in the Congolese zone. Both the intensity
and length of these recent range expansion episodes could
explain why coffee trees did not accumulate enough differentiation to lead to reproductive barriers and speciation.
Impact of human cultivation on inter-group gene flow and
hybridization
The genetic structure analyses conducted in the present
study seem to be efficient for reliable detection of admixtures and individual identification. Indeed, deviations
from a priori diversity group classifications, are in line
with issues concerning the introduction of non-indigenous wild or cultivated C. canephora plants or with the
putative hybrid origin of cultivars.

Assignment tests confirmed that the landraces have
remained genetically very close to the original wild populations. Indeed, since the 19th century, many local cultivars were cultivated spontaneous forms of C. canephora
directly collected in adjacent forest populations. This was
the case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Côte

d'Ivoire (for "Kouilou" genotypes), Togo and Benin (for
"Niaouli" genotypes), and Central African Republic (for
"Nana" genotypes). Even improved material from INEAC
(Table 2) has undergone few breeding cycles. Moreover,
contact between local spontaneous forms and adjacent
plantations could have promoted intermixing of individuals both in the wild and cultivated germplasm. In fact,
according to the domestication syndrome definition
(Hammer 1984), Robusta coffee trees should be considered as "cultivated" or "semi-domesticated" rather than
"domesticated", since no heritable distinctive traits could
be discerned when compared to their wild relatives.
The putative hybrid origin of some cultivars is suggested
by the present data. In particular, most of the a priori
group D (from Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea) and some of a
priori group E (from southeast Cameroon and south Central African Republic) cultivated forms turned out to be
putative F1 hybrids between these two genetic groups.
Humans have contributed to this phenomenon since cultivated material originating from Central Africa, in particular from the Congo region, has been introduced in West
African countries, such as in Côte d'Ivoire since 1930
(Portères, 1937). The low level of genetic introgression we
observed in the putative hybrids suggests a recent contact
between the local and exogenous material. Hybrids
between the Guinean and Congolese group material had
been previously identified by Berthaud [33] in cultivated
variants on the basis of their vigour and yield. The use of

intergroup hybrids and the efficiency of reciprocal recurrent selection was subsequently demonstrated [55]. This
contrasts markedly with the cultivation history of C. arabica, whose varieties originated from a narrow genetic
base [56]. Polymorphism was further reduced during
selection cycles and by the predominant autogamy of C.
arabica.
In this study, the putative intergroup hybrids, corresponding to various introgression levels detected and supposedly of wild origin, probably resulted from either culture
escapes or from cross-pollinisation with neighbouring
plantations.
Consequently, the core sets we propose contain both wild
and cultivated accessions from the different groups, and a
non-negligible fraction of putative hybrids. They provide
good reference sets for further identification of spontaneous or cultivated material.

Conclusion
The high degree of concordance between the SSR and
RFLP data for diversity group differentiation indicates that
our set of markers provided adequate genome coverage
for accurate germplasm characterization. Even though
these loci have likely evolved at different rates, they
revealed comparable diversity structure with five well-differentiated groups corresponding to geographical patterning in the individuals. The molecular variation was

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:167

correlated with the natural distribution in two postulated
refugia areas, i.e. the Upper Guinea and Lower Guinea/
Congo regions, separated by the Dahomey Gap.
A more intense and larger scale sampling would be
required for more detailed geographical mapping of the
diversity and more genetically precise refugia identification, especially in the Central African mosaic zone.
SSR genotyping provided highly informative data for
multi-locus discrimination of individuals and putative
hybrid detection. These data could be related to the recent
history of coffee agricultural activities. Inter-group hybridizations were detected at a non-negligible frequency, especially between a priori group D ("Guinean" in West Africa)
and E ("Congolese" in Central Africa). The previous
observation of heterosis of Guinean-Congolese cultivars
suggests that the high diversity included in these diversity
groups represents an excellent genetic reservoir that could
be tapped for adapted stock breeding schemes. This study
also provides an excellent basis for determining the
appropriate scale of wild population conservation and
management.

Methods
Study species and sampled genotypes
Coffea canephora is a widespread species throughout westcentral Africa [33]. More than 700 wild genotypes were
collected by ORSTOM (now IRD, Institut de Recherche
pour le Développement, France) in collaboration with
CIRAD, FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), IPGRI
(International Plant Genetic Resources Institute), and
MNHN (Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle),
between 1975 and 1987, in five African countries: Côte
d'Ivoire and Guinea in West Africa; and Cameroon,
Congo and Central African Republic in Central Africa [2326,33]. These genotypes are conserved in the only reference collection for wild forms of C. canephora, i.e. the Divo
collection, Côte d'Ivoire. In parallel, CIRAD assembled a
collection of cultivated material, also conserved at the
Divo experimental station. This collection contains more
than 600 accessions of diverse origins: local varieties and
populations, forms taken from village plantations, and
selected material [26,33,35,57].

In this study, a total of 107 Coffea canephora genotypes (61
wild and 46 cultivated) were selected from the initial set
analysed in Dussert et al. [35]. The wild genotypes were
sampled in order to have a representation of each of the
40 forest populations studied throughout the range of the
species (Figure 1, Table 1). For the cultivated material, a
random proportional sampling was done for each of the
10 principal origins identified in collection (Table 2).
Total genomic DNA was extracted according to the
method described by Ky et al. [58].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/167

RFLP analysis
Two restriction enzymes were used to digest the genomic
DNA: EcoRI and HindIII. Out of the 26 initially tested
probes, eight were retained for their polymorphic and
mono-locus characteristics. Selected RFLP probes corresponded to previously mapped loci distributed on six
linkage groups of the C. canephora linkage map (Table 3)
[59].
SSR analysis
Sixteen SSR loci (Table 3) were amplified as previously
described [38,42] using a touchdown PCR profile optimised for each set of primers: touchdown 60°C to 55°C
or touchdown 55°C to 50°C. PCR products were detected
on an IR2 Automated DNA Sequencer (LI-COR, model
4200L-2, Lincoln, NE, USA) using an M13 primer coupled
to the infrared tag IRD700 or IRD800 after migration on
25 cm 6.5% KBplus (LI-COR, CAT# 827-05607) polyacrylamide gels. The gel images were processed by SAGA GT™
software (LICOR Biotech) to estimate the size of amplicons according to a 50–350 bp size standard (LI-COR,
CAT# 829-05343, 829-05344).

The sixteen SSR loci were evenly distributed throughout
the Coffea genome and nine of them mapped on nine different linkage groups of the intespecific map [C. heterocalyx × C. canephora) × C. canephora] (Table 3) [60].
Data analysis
Genetic diversity
For each SSR and RFLP locus, we assessed genetic polymorphism within total or wild samples by calculating the
observed number of alleles (Na), observed and expected
heterozygosity (HO and HE), and the polymorphism information content (PIC) using the POWERMARKER v3.25 software [61]. In these analyses, individual wild plants of
possible hybrid origin, as determined by genetic structure
analysis (see below), were excluded from the wild pool.
Genetic affinities among individual genotypes, Cluster analyses
Neighbour-joining trees were constructed using the
shared-allele distances for both the RFLP and SSR data
using POWERMARKER v3.25 software [61]. Bootstrapping
was conducted with 2000 replicates and the trees were
implemented in the PHYLIP package [62] to obtain a consensus tree, visualized in TREEVIEW (taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html). The Mantel matrix
correspondence test was used to compare individual
genetic distances generated by each marker type using
POWERMARKER v3.25.

In order to display patterns in the individual genetic distances, a principal coordinate analysis (PCO) was performed on both the RFLP and SSR dataset. For each
individual, we calculated the frequencies of each allele (0,
0.5, and 1) at each locus, and used this data to perform a
Page 16 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:167

principal component analysis (PCA), "French PCA" in
STATISTICA V6.1 http://www.statsoft.com. This analysis was
computed for the whole sample, with cultivated and putative hybrids, as determined by genetic structure analysis
(see below), included as additional passive elements.
Genetic structure
For statistical investigation of genetic structure of the C.
canephora wild sample and detection of intermediate types
(hybrids between diversity groups), two different Bayesian analyses were performed.

The genetic structure was first investigated for both RFLP
and SSR datasets with the Bayesian approach in STRUCTURE
V2.1[45,47]. Parameters were set at K = 5 for the number of
groups, 30,000 for the burn-in time and 1,000,000 for the
number of runs, with five repetitions. The number of clusters (K = 5) was confirmed as the value that maximized the
increase in the posterior probability of the Ln P(D) data
according to the formula [Ln P(D)k-Ln P(D)k-1], as suggested by Garnier et al. [63]. We assessed the proportion
of qi membership of each genotype to the five genetic
groups, i.e. the proportion of its genome drawn from each
group. We assigned each individual genome to one group
when the average proportion of membership was qi >
0.80, i.e. over 80% ancestry to their own cluster. In the
case of admixed individuals, we jointly assigned them to
two or more groups if the proportion of membership to
each one was 0.20 < qi < 0.80. For each individual, we calculated a 90% CI of the qi parameter.
We also used the "leave one out" procedure and the
method proposed by Cornuet et al. [64]. The Bayesianbased maximum likelihood test implemented in
GENECLASS2 V2.0 [46] has been shown to be effective in genotype assignment, even when populations deviate from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [65,66]. Each individual to
be reassigned was removed from its source group and the
frequency estimates of each locus were modified accordingly (Monte Carlo simulations of 1,000 independent
individuals for each candidate group). Differences in loglikelihood values were computed to assign individuals to
one group with a risk of 0.01. The reference groups used
were the a priori A, B, C, D, and E groups. This software
was also used to assign cultivated plants to the wild
genetic groups.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/167

correlation between the two FST matrixes generated by
each marker type was investigated by Mantel's test of
matrix correspondence in GENETIX.
Core set
To assist in the use or conservation of wild and cultivated
Coffea canephora germplasm, we defined core sets of accessions that capture the maximum RFLP or SSR diversity
using the principal component score strategy (PCSS) [68].
Based on Khi-2 distances, a factorial analysis is applied to
transform initial data into factor scores. Iterative selection
of individuals maximising subset variability is based on
their relative contribution to the generalised sum of
squares (GSS), expressed in percentage.

excluded. The partition of the genetic variation between
wild genetic groups for both RFLP and SSR data was estimated with the FST of Weir and Cockerham implemented
