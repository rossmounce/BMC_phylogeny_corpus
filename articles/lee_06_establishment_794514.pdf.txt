Abstract
Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are an abundant form of genetic variation in the genome
of every species and are useful for gene mapping and association studies. Of particular interest are nonsynonymous SNPs, which may alter protein function and phenotype. We therefore examined bovine expressed
sequences for non-synonymous SNPs and validated and tested selected SNPs for their association with measured
traits.
Results: Over 500,000 public bovine expressed sequence tagged (EST) sequences were used to search for coding
SNPs (cSNPs). A total of 15,353 SNPs were detected in the transcribed sequences studied, of which 6,325 were
predicted to be coding SNPs with the remaining 9,028 SNPs presumed to be in untranslated regions. Of the cSNPs
detected, 2,868 were predicted to result in a change in the amino acid encoded. In order to determine the actual
number of non-synonymous polymorphic SNPs we designed assays for 920 of the putative SNPs. These SNPs
were then genotyped through a panel of cattle DNA pools using chip-based MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Of
the SNPs tested, 29% were found to be polymorphic with a minor allele frequency >10%. A subset of the SNPs
was genotyped through animal resources in order to look for association with age of puberty, facial eczema
resistance or meat yield. Three SNPs were nominally associated with resistance to the disease facial eczema (P <
0.01).
Conclusion: We have identified 15,353 putative SNPs in or close to bovine genes and 2,868 of these SNPs were
predicted to be non-synonymous. Approximately 29% of the non-synonymous SNPs were polymorphic and
common with a minor allele frequency >10%. Of the SNPs detected in this study, 99% have not been previously
reported. These novel SNPs will be useful for association studies or gene mapping.

Background
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are an abundant form of genetic variation in every species. SNPs are
more stable than other genetic markers, such as simple
sequence repeats although they are not as informative due
to their predominantly biallelic nature. They are distributed throughout the genome and in Homo sapiens SNPs
have been estimated to occur at a frequency of approximately one in every 1,000 bp [1] making them the most
common form of genetic variation. SNPs are extremely
useful for association studies, gene mapping and phylogenetic studies. They provide genomic landmarks of past
events shaping individuals, breeds and species. In species
of agricultural importance, SNPs can be used to identify
regions influencing important economic traits. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms have also been shown to be
responsible for a number of economically desirable phenotypes in sheep, such as the muscle hypertrophy phenotype callipyge and the fertility phenotype Inverdale [2,3].
A public SNP database (dbSNP) has been established by
the National Center for Biotechnology Information to
store sequence variation information from a variety of
species [4]. There are currently 19,395 Bos taurus SNPs
deposited in this database.
SNPs can be identified in coding regions (cSNPs) or noncoding regions. A subset of SNPs in coding regions give
rise to variation in the amino acid sequence of the
encoded protein and are known as non-synonymous
SNPs (nsSNPs). Such SNPs have been reported to occur
less frequently than synonymous SNPs, presumably due
to evolutionary constraints as selection eliminates deleterious substitutions from the population [5]. Non-synonymous SNPs are therefore of interest as they are more likely
to affect the function of the encoded protein and so may
influence a phenotype of interest. Indeed, it has been estimated that 20–30% of nsSNPs affect protein function
[6,7].
SNPs are very amenable to high-throughput analysis but
in vitro SNP discovery can be a lengthy and expensive
process. Identifying SNPs in silico and then validating the
polymorphisms in vitro provides a cost effective method
of SNP discovery for mapping or association studies.
We developed a pipeline for detecting cSNPs and validating these SNPs cost-effectively. Available cattle expressed
sequence tagged (EST) sequences were mined to identify
cSNPs yielding 15,353 putative transcribed SNPs, of
which 6,325 were predicted to be in coding regions. 2,868
of the cSNPs were predicted to be non-synonymous. A
subset of the non-synonymous SNPs was genotyped
through pools containing DNA from a number of cattle of
different breeds and 29% of these SNPs were confirmed to
be polymorphic in the animals tested (minor allele fre-

quency >10%). Finally association was calculated
between a subset of the validated non-synonymous SNPs
and a number of economically important phenotypes.

Results
In order to detect non-synonymous SNPs 528,218 public
bovine expressed sequences were assembled into contigs
and polymorphisms in these contigs detected using conservative criteria. In total the region examined encompassed over 11,000 kbp of bovine expressed sequence and
resulted in the detection of 15,353 putative SNPs in 7,145
contigs. The sequence of the contigs is given in Additional
file 1 and the SNP allele frequencies are listed in Additional file 2. 6,325 of the SNPs were predicted to be coding SNPs and 2,868 of the cSNPs were predicted to result
in a change in the amino acid encoded at that position.
The severity of the change of amino acid was calculated
using an index that combined the scores from a Blosum90
and PAM250 substitution matrix. The putative synonymous and non-synonymous cSNPs are given in Additional file 3. If all base substitutions were equally likely,
76% of the cSNPs would be expected to result in an amino
acid change. We found 45.3% of the cSNPs were predicted
to be non-synonymous indicating that there is strong
selection pressure against amino acid changes in the
sequences studied. The ratio of non-synonymous SNPs to
synonymous SNPs reported here is in good agreement
with the findings of groups who have calculated this ratio
from human sequences [5,8].
The frequency of base substitutions at each of the codon
positions for non-synonymous and synonymous SNPs
was calculated and is shown in Figure 1. As expected the
majority of the substitutions (93.5%) occurred in the
third position for synonymous SNPs and at the first and
second positions (87.1%) for non-synonymous SNPs.
Candidate SNPs were also categorized according to nucleotide substitution as either transitions (A/G or C/T) or
transversions (A/C, A/T, C/G, or G/T). Of the 15,353 putative SNPs detected, 15,335 SNPs could be categorized in
this manner with the remaining 18 showing 3 alleles at
the SNP position. 66.2% of the SNPs detected were the
result of transitions, even though transitions represent
only one third of the potential types of mutation. A high
frequency of transitions has been observed in other SNP
discovery programs and the transition frequency observed
here is in good agreement with human data where
approximately 70% of SNPs were found to be the result of
transitions [9-11]. We found the frequency of transitions
was significantly higher among synonymous SNPs
(81.9%) than non-synonymous SNPs (51.6%; χ2 = 665.8;
P = 8.0 × 10-147). The frequency of the various substitutions is illustrated in Figure 2. Within the non-synonymous SNPs, the frequency of transitions between
conservative substitutions (index score ≥ 2) and radical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/298

substitutions (index score ≤ -2) was also examined. In this
case no significant difference was found between the two
groups (43.9% and 43.8% respectively; χ2 = 0.33; P =
0.97). A high frequency of transitions has been observed
in other SNP discovery programs [11] and reflects the high
frequency of C to T mutation after methylation.
For each contig, the proportion of nsSNPs was plotted
against SNP density and a polynomial regression fitted,
weighting by the total number of SNPs the contig contained (Figure 3). Only the linear term was found to
explain any effect of SNP density, and this accounted for
less than 1% of the variation in the proportion of nsSNPs.
Therefore, although the proportion of SNPs that are nonsynonymous increases with SNP density, SNP density is a
poor predictor of this proportion. The nsSNPs detected in
this study appear to come from contigs with a range of
SNP densities and are not substantially more frequent in
contigs with high sequence variation.
In order to determine the percentage of in silico derived
non-synonymous SNPs that were polymorphic, 920 nsSNPs were genotyped through pools of cattle DNA using
chip based MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The pools
used consisted of either a single pool containing DNA
from 57 animals of a variety of breeds (see methods) or
four pools each containing DNA from eight animals from
a total of seven breeds plus a back-cross containing two
breeds (see Table 1). The pooling strategy provided power
to reliably identify SNPs with a minor allele frequency
(MAF) greater than 10% and may detect SNPs with a MAF
greater than 3%. In total, 795 of the 920 putative nsSNPs
tested could be reliably scored giving a strike rate of 86%,
while 125 of the assays failed. In total 227 of the putative

nsSNPs were confirmed as polymorphic in the animals
tested, while 568 of the putative nsSNPs were not confirmed in the animals tested indicating that they are not
polymorphic, are rare (MAF <10%), or polymorphism is
specific to breeds not tested in this study. The number of
nsSNPs that were polymorphic in the pools tested is illustrated in Figure 4. In total 19 SNPs were polymorphic in 1
pool, 25 were polymorphic in 2 pools. 44 were polymorphic in 3 pools and 139 were polymorphic in all 4 pools
tested. These 139 SNPs are found in 131 contigs, of which
128 could be annotated with a human RefSeq, giving 112
unique genes. These SNPs represent a subset of highly pol-

ymorphic non-synonymous SNPs and include a number
of SNPs in immune response genes, such as Major Histocompatibility Complex genes. These genes are known to
be extremely polymorphic. The full list of nsSNPs tested
and their allele calls is available in Additional file 4.
As there were a large number of nsSNPs that were polymorphic in all pools tested we needed to eliminate the
possibility that this was due to spurious amplification of
a closely related gene with a different nucleotide at the
extension position. We therefore genotyped 55 nsSNPs,
which we scored as polymorphic in all four breed pools,
across four individual animals. Only one of these SNPs
was heterozygous in all four individual animals tested
indicating that amplification of closely related genes is
not a serious contaminant in our cSNP discovery program. Approximately 0.8% of the candidate nsSNPs
detected in this study were previously deposited in
dbSNP. Of the 227 polymorphic nsSNPs validated in this
study, 3 had been previously deposited in dbSNP. We
have deposited all 15,353 putative SNPs detected in this
study in dbSNP.
We tested the utility of a subset of these SNPs to detect by
association quantitative trait loci for meat yield, age of
puberty and Facial eczema resistance. Facial eczema is a
metabolic disease that results from a fungal toxin, sporidesmin, which damages the liver and there is heritable
variation in facial eczema resistance in cattle [12]. A total
of 41 SNPs in 33 genes with relevance to reproductive
traits (6 SNPs in 5 genes), disease resistance (26 SNPs in
19 genes) and body composition (9 SNPs in 9 genes) were
genotyped through appropriate animal resources and
allele frequencies and association with phenotype calculated. The results are shown in Table 2 and Additional file
5. SNPs in the BCL10, GBP1 and C8A genes were nominally associated with resistance to facial eczema in Jerseys
(P = 0.004; 0.006; 0.03 respectively) while SNPs in the
ABCC3, OAS1 and HRG genes were nominally associated
with resistance to facial eczema in Friesians (P = 0.008;
0.04; 0.05 respectively). There are more nominally significant (P < 0.01) results than expected by chance with 3
exceeding that threshold where less than one would be
expected, however, none of the individual SNPs reach a

genome wide level of significance. Additionally no SNP
was significantly associated with facial eczema resistance
in both Jerseys and Friesians.
It was found that the allele frequencies of some of the genotyped SNPs were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
These SNPs are highlighted in bold in Table 2. The reason
these SNPs do not obey Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is
unknown, however, it may reflect the fact that the effective
population sizes are relatively small, the animals were not
randomly mated and the animals genotyped were not a
random sample but were chosen as they were outliers in
the population.

Discussion
Using public bovine expressed sequence data we have
identified 15,353 candidate SNPs in the genome of Bos
taurus. One putative SNP was detected approximately
every 716 bp for the sequences studied. 6,325 of the putative SNPs are predicted to be coding sequence SNPs and
2,868 of the cSNPs are predicted to be non-synonymous.
The low frequency of non-synonymous SNPs detected,
with respect to the frequency expected if all base substitutions in coding regions were equally likely, implies that
the genes studied are under strong selection pressure.
Recently, the deleterious mutation rate was estimated by
comparing the coding sequences of many genes between
Bos taurus and Homo sapiens. This analysis concluded that
87% of amino-acid changing mutations were deleterious
[13]. Therefore, any non-synonymous SNPs detected in
this study may affect the function of the encoded protein.
The non-synonymous SNPs we detected were in a variety
of genes with differing biological functions and on a
number of different bovine chromosomes and may influence traits of economic interest. Additional programs such
as SIFT or SNPs3D may be used to predict whether the
amino acid substitution will affect protein function
[14,15]. However, it is likely that direct association or
linkage studies will be needed to determine the real effect
of allele substitution on phenotype in an animal or population.
Polymorphisms that affect biological function can also
occur outside coding sequences [16], particularly in the

derived from cDNA from a limited number of animals,
therefore some of the SNPs detected may be restricted to
particular animals. Additionally, high-throughput EST
sequencing is prone to sequencing errors and this may
result in some false positive SNPs. A previous study identifying bovine SNPs from EST data reported a SNP validation rate of 38% for non-synonymous SNPs which had
been detected more than once in EST data, although they
validated only a small number of SNPs [17]. Therefore,
our results are consistent with these findings.
Approximately 0.8% of the non-synonymous SNPs predicted from this study were previously identified and
deposited in NCBI dbSNP with the remainder representing novel bovine SNPs. Many of these SNPs could potentially be used as genetic markers in known genes. All SNPs
detected in this study and their allele frequencies have
been deposited in dbSNP.

proximity of genes such as in splice junctions and promoters. As all of the SNPs detected in this study are in the
vicinity of genes, any of these SNPs could potentially
influence phenotype or be in linkage disequilibrium with
a phenotype-altering mutation. Therefore all SNPs
detected in this study are useful for association studies
although non-synonymous SNPs are of particular interest.
Approximately 66% of the polymorphisms detected in
this study were the result of transitions. Transitions represent only one third of the possible types of substitutions
yet they are reported to account for approximately 70% of
all substitutions. Our data is in good agreement with previous studies that have calculated the frequency of transitions in human genes [9,10]. The fact that our transition
frequency is so close to the expected value implies that our
SNP detection strategy is accurate. A high false positive
SNP discovery rate would be expected to result in a high
frequency of transversions.
The percentage of nsSNPs that were polymorphic was
determined by genotyping 920 putative SNPs through
pooled DNA from cattle of different breeds. 29% of the
SNPs were found to be polymorphic in the samples tested.
However, the pooling strategy only allowed reliable detection of SNPs with a minor allele frequency >10%. Therefore many more of the SNPs may be polymorphic, but
with a lower MAF. The SNPs were also genotyped through
a limited number of cattle breeds, therefore, some SNPs
may be present or polymorphic in breeds not tested in this
study. Also, many of the ESTs used for SNP detection were

Forty one validated polymorphic SNPs in 33 genes of
interest were genotyped through animal resources which
had been measured for age of puberty, retail beef yield or
resistance to facial eczema. The number of nominally significant associations and the strength of these associations
with facial eczema resistance was higher than expected by
chance although no single SNP reached a genome wide
level of significance. The most significant SNP was in the
gene B cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and showed association with facial eczema resistance in a Jersey population.
BCL10 encodes a protein that appears to both activate and
be activated by NFκB and overexpression of BCL10 causes
weak apoptosis mediated via an amino terminal caspase
recruitment domain (CARD) [18,19]. The BCL10 protein
is a positive regulator of lymphocyte activation and proliferation [20]. It is more likely that this gene is in linkage
disequilibrium with a resistance conferring polymorphism in Jerseys, than responsible for facial eczema resistance per se, as the SNP in this gene was not associated with
facial eczema resistance in Friesians.

Conclusion
We have developed a pipeline for detecting, validating
and genotyping large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms using Bos taurus as a model organism. However, this strategy could be successfully applied to any
organism for which sufficient EST sequence data exists.
We have detected 15,353 putative SNPs in the vicinity of
genes in this study and 6,325 candidate cSNPs, of which
2,868 were predicted to be non-synonymous. Approximately 0.8% of the non-synonymous SNPs detected in
this study were previously deposited in dbSNP while 99%
appear to be novel bovine SNPs. These novel SNPs have
the potential to add greatly to the previously discovered
bovine SNPs although some additional SNP validation
work is required. These SNPs can be used for association

studies or gene mapping and we have found SNP associations for resistance to facial eczema in Jersey or Friesian
populations at a higher rate than expected by chance,
although no single SNP reached a genome wide level of
significance. Whether these genes are involved with facial
eczema resistance in specific breeds, false positives, or are
merely in linkage disequilibrium with a resistance
enhancing polymorphisms remains to be determined.

MCL graph clustering algorithm [22]. The parameters
used for the MCL re-partitioning were -I 2 -adapt. For each
assembly set the unmasked sequences were then assembled into contigs using CAP3 [23]. The default parameters
of all programs were used unless otherwise stated. The
contig generation process is summarised in Table 3. All
AgResearch bovine sequences used are publicly available
at NCBI and have accession numbers DY037420 –
DY223196 and DY588300 – DY588367.

Methods
Generation of ESTs
Tissue samples were collected from a number of animals
both from research farms and commercial farms. These
animals were of different ages and stages of development
and the tissues that were collected are listed in Additional
file 6. Tissue was sent to Genesis Biotechnology (Auckland, New Zealand) or Life Technologies (Carlsbad, California) where cDNA clones were generated and single pass
sequenced giving ESTs. All cDNA libraries were non-normalised with the exception of BEMN. All animal handling
and procedures were approved by the AgResearch Animal
Ethics Committee.
Contig assembly
Single pass sequences were vector trimmed, quality
clipped and masked by Genesis Biotechnology. For the
contig assembly all EST sequences were further cleaned by
re-checking for possible vector contamination against
UniVec using Cross_match. A total of 528,218 public and
AgResearch bovine sequences were assembled into contigs after masking using RepeatMasker. The contig assembly used a divide-and-conquer strategy [21] where an
initial coarse partitioning of ESTs was performed to generate correct and feasible assembly sets of no more than
50,000. A simple graph based clustering algorithm was
used to generate the assembly sets in which each EST is a
node and ESTs are joined by an edge if a BLAST alignment
exists between them with an e value ≤ 1 × 10-10. This value
was chosen to ensure that pairs of ESTs with a 40 bp overlap of 80% identity (the relevant CAP3 parameters used
for the assembly) would always be connected. Assembly
sets correspond to connected components of the graph.
Our initial partitioning generated one infeasible assembly
set. This set was partitioned into smaller sets, using the

Contig annotation
Contigs were annotated with their top human RefSeq (3/
2006) hit using discontiguous Mega BLAST and the following options -m 8 -D 2 -t 21 -W 11 -q -3 -r 2 -G 5 -E 2
-e 1e-5 -N 2 -F "m D" -U T -v 5 -b 5. Discontiguous Mega
BLAST, which is based on the use of discontiguous templates [24], is designed for alignments of diverged
sequences, most notably sequences from different organisms. The options used here are optimised for alignments
where the percent sequence identity is typically 91% [25].
The options specify a template 21 bp long of which 11
positions must be identical to the template match. The
options align both coding and non-coding sequences and
do not allow the initiation of seeds from the template
match in low complexity or repetitive regions, although
they do allow extension through these regions.
cSNP detection
A SNP detection program (SNooPy) was developed to
detect single nucleotide polymorphisms in the EST
sequences using stringent criteria. SnooPy retrieves contigs with four or more constituent ESTs. Positions with
polymorphisms that fulfil the following criteria are then
identified: minor allele frequency (MAF) must equal at
least 15% or two divided by the contig depth (whichever
is greater); there must be at least four aligned ESTs in the
region containing the polymorphism; SNPs are disqualified if more than 5% variation is found in the surrounding
10 bp; no more than three variants at a single position are
allowed and SNPs detected in the first or last 20 bp of the
assembled sequences were not allowed. Synonymous and
non-synonymous cSNPs were detected by initially manually blasting the contigs in which putative SNPs had been
identified against SWISS-PROT using the following BLAST

options -e 1e-5 -F "m S" -v 50 -b 50. The results of the
BLAST, along with the initial contig sequence, were then
evaluated by calculating the frame of the contig sequence
translation using programs SNP_SEQ and PROTEIN and
hence identifying all cSNPs, including those that result in
a change in the amino acid sequence. An index score for
the severity of the amino acid change was calculated by
adding the PAM250 substitution matrix score and the
BLOSUM90 substitution matrix score. The SNooPy,
SNP_SEQ and PROTEIN programs are available on
request from the corresponding author.
Validation of non-synonymous SNPs
All human exon sequences, along with 100 bp on either
side, were extracted from ENSEMBL. These exon
sequences were stored in a BLAST database. Contigs containing putative non-synonymous SNPs were then blasted
against this database in order to detect intron-exon
boundaries flanking the SNP. As intron-exon boundaries
have been shown to be highly conserved between mammalian sequences [26] the cattle exon boundaries were
inferred from the human boundaries. Only SNP-containing sequences, predicted to be from single exons with >25
bases flanking the SNP were used in assay design. In order
to determine the percentage of in silico derived putative
nsSNPs that were polymorphic 920 candidate nsSNPs
were genotyped through pooled cattle DNA. 268 SNPs
were genotyped 4 times (pools A-D) through a single pool
containing 57 animals. These animals consisted of 4
Angus, 4 Simmental, 4 Hereford prime, 4 Hereford, 4
Limousin, 4 Murray Grey, 4 Belgian blue, 4 polled Herefords, 4 Shorthorn, 4 Red Devon, 4 Charolais, 4 Piedmontese, 5 Jersey and 4 Jersey × Limousin backcross animals.
The SNPs genotyped in this manner are highlighted in
bold in Additional file 4. The remaining 652 putative nsSNPs were genotyped through four breed pools of cattle
samples (Table 1). All SNPs were genotyped using the
MassEXTEND assay (Sequenom). Forward and reverse
amplification primers and an extension primer were
designed in the region of each putative SNP using SpectroDESIGNER™ 1.3.4 (Sequenom). The target region was
amplified with these gene specific primers (Additional file
4). Amplification was carried out with the HotMaster PCR
kit (Eppendorf) as follows; 94°C for 1 min, 35 cycles of
94°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec, 65°C for 45 sec, then
65°C for 3 min. After PCR amplification, unincorporated
dNTPs were removed by shrimp alkaline phosphatase. A
detecting primer immediately adjacent to the polymorphic site was added together with a specific combination
of deoxy and di-deoxy nucleotides (Additional file 4) and
thermosequenase (GE Healthcare). The extension products were then analyzed by mass spectrometry on a Biflex
2 MALDI-TOF (Sequenom). For the single pool genotyped 4 times, SNPs were considered polymorphic if at
least 1 pool showed the minor allele with a peak height ≥

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/298

10% of the major peak. For the breed pools SNPs were
considered polymorphic if at least 1 pool showed the
minor allele with a peak height ≥ 12.5% of the major
peak. This allowed us to detect SNPs with a MAF of 3–
10%. These thresholds were chosen as the peak height of
the minor allele was indistinguishable from background
when it was < 10% of the major allele peak height. 55 polymorphisms were confirmed by genotyping 4 animals
individually (3 Jersey × Limousin animals and 1 Friesian)
using MassEXTEND as described above.
DNA extraction and generation of pools
All genomic DNA was extracted from 10 ml of whole
blood or from frozen semen using saturated NaCl as
described previously [27]. DNA was quantified using a
NanoDrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
Technologies). Pools were created by mixing equimolar
amounts of DNA samples to a final concentration of 5–10
ng/µl.
Association studies
In total 41 SNPs, in 33 genes were genotyped across
resources that had phenotypes measured for traits of economic importance. The SNPs were multiplexed into 4
assays and primers designed using MassARRAY Assay
design V3.0 (Sequenom). The SNPs were genotyped
across the appropriate resources using the iPLEX system
(Sequenom) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The full list of multiplexed genotyped SNPs and primers
used is available in Additional file 7.
Resource populations
Disease resistance
This population consisted of 112 Jersey-sired and 53 Friesian-sired animals that are facial eczema resistant and 104
Jersey-sired and 54 Friesian-sired animals that are facial
eczema susceptible. Resistance or susceptibility to facial
eczema was calculated by measuring activity of the liverderived serum enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase
(GGT) as an indicator of liver injury from facial eczema.
GGT levels were measured either after orally dosing the
animals with the naturally occurring sporidesmin toxin or
after natural challenge at pasture and high and low outliers were chosen [12].
Percentage meat yield in the carcass
This population consisted of 349 animals from a variety
of breeds, which had been previously identified as having
high or low retail beef yield percentage. The number of
animals from each breed and their method of selection
are listed in Table 4.
Reproductive traits
This population consisted of 95 Angus animals, of which
46 were from an AGE+ (increased age at puberty in heif-

Association testing
Disease resistance
For facial eczema, association with each SNP was tested by
fitting breed of animal and each SNP genotype nested
within breed in a model against standardised loge GGT.
Standardising was performed on a within-herd/group
basis to account for herd/group effects of natural and artificial challenges of sporidesmin.
Body composition
Animals with outlier phenotypes for retail beef yield were
from 6 sources/breeds. For Angus, Hereford and Simmental, Breeding Values calculated by Breedplan were used
and for the other three sources, standardised residuals
after fitting fixed effects such as slaughter group, age at
slaughter and cohort (generally birth year, sex and preslaughter grazing mob) were tested for association by fitting each SNP within source/breed.
Reproductive traits
There were two sex-related traits for the puberty dataset;
average scrotal circumference over 3 to 6 monthly measurements around puberty in males and a standardised age
at first oestrus for females. Animals used were a random
subset of males and females born in two years of the selection experiment. Association was tested primarily by looking for greater allelic segregation between the two
selection lines than would be expected to arise by genetic

drift [29]. Additionally for the two traits, each SNP was fitted within each selection line to test for an association.
The two traits were combined using the genetic correlation between the two traits to give one measure for all animals and again tested.
