Abstract
Background: Functional and comparative studies of insect genomes have shed light on the complement of
genes, which in part, account for shared morphologies, developmental programs and life-histories.
Contrasting the gene inventories of insects to those of the nematodes provides insight into the genomic
changes responsible for their diversification. However, nematodes have weak relationships to insects, as
each belongs to separate animal phyla. A better outgroup to distinguish lineage specific novelties would
include other members of Arthropoda. For example, crustaceans are close allies to the insects (together
forming Pancrustacea) and their fascinating aquatic lifestyle provides an important comparison for
understanding the genetic basis of adaptations to life on land versus life in water.
Results: This study reports on the first characterization of cDNA libraries and sequences for the model
crustacean Daphnia pulex. We analyzed 1,546 ESTs of which 1,414 represent approximately 787 nuclear
genes, by measuring their sequence similarities with insect and nematode proteomes. The provisional
annotation of genes is supported by expression data from microarray studies described in companion
papers. Loci expected to be shared between crustaceans and insects because of their mutual biological
features are identified, including genes for reproduction, regulation and cellular processes. We identify
genes that are likely derived within Pancrustacea or lost within the nematodes. Moreover, lineage specific
gene family expansions are identified, which suggest certain biological demands associated with their
ecological setting. In particular, up to seven distinct ferritin loci are found in Daphnia compared to three
in most insects. Finally, a substantial fraction of the sampled gene transcripts shares no sequence similarity
with those from other arthropods. Genes functioning during development and reproduction are
comparatively well conserved between crustaceans and insects. By contrast, genes that were responsive
to environmental conditions (metal stress) and not sex-biased included the greatest proportion of genes
with no matches to insect proteomes.
Conclusion: This study along with associated microarray experiments are the initial steps in a coordinated
effort by the Daphnia Genomics Consortium to build the necessary genomic platform needed to discover
genes that account for the phenotypic diversity within the genus and to gain new insights into crustacean
biology. This effort will soon include the first crustacean genome sequence.

Background
Among the major groups of the phylum Arthropoda – Chelicerata, Myriapoda, Crustacea, Hexapoda (insects and relatives) – the crustaceans and insects are allies [1]. They are
together classified as members of the Pancrustacea, although
their reciprocal monophyly is currently disputed [2-4].
Despite this phylogenetic uncertainty for taxa that have likely
diverged some 600 million years ago [5] the model crustacean Daphnia is expected to share genes that are central to
arthropod biology and development with well studied
insects, such as Drosophila, Anopheles, Bombyx and Apis.
Indeed, gene-by-gene investigations have already demonstrated the functional conservation of selected loci involved
in germline formation and embryonic patterning between
representative crustaceans and insects [6-8]. Yet, these two
classes of animals have also evolved in radically different
environments; branchiopod crustaceans are adapted to
aquatic habitats, while the insects are predominantly
adapted to terrestrial habitats. It is therefore expected that
proteins required for life in these particular environments
will reflect the biotic and abiotic challenges faced by these
particular taxonomic groups. Furthermore, model crustaceans like Daphnia (order Cladocera) have a highly specialized mode of reproduction called cyclical parthenogenesis
[9], which involves environmental sex determination and is
derived from obligate sex [10]. Thus, the genetic control of
cyclical parthenogenesis may have arisen from modifications in the structure and/or the regulation of arthropod
reproductive genes. Similar mechanisms may apply for a
variety of other adaptations, including Daphnia's morphological transmutations in response to predator kairmones
(called cyclomorphosis), their ability to shift from direct
development into diapause within ephemeral habitats, and
mechanisms for acclimating to both natural and anthropogenic stressors such as hypoxia or metal contamination. The
evolution of these traits is expected to involve species-specific
modifications of gene regulation, the restructuring of genes
common to arthropods [11] and innovations unique to their
aquatic habitats. Additionally, transitions in breeding systems and the origins of other adaptive traits probably also
involve novel genes or lineage specific gene family expansions [12].
Comparative studies into the functional conservation of
genes and the genetic basis of adaptation are made easier by
the rapid development of genomic data and technologies.
For example, cross-species comparisons within the Nematoda, based on over 265,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
from 30 species, indicate that roughly 40% of the 93,000
characterized genes have no known homologues within the
phylum [13] while 23% of genes are unique to each species
[14]. These large differences in gene content reflect (in part)
the ecological diversity of the sampled nematodes, including
free-living species and others that are plant or animal parasites. Not surprising, genetic novelty can be linked to an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/217

organism's specialized lifestyle. For instance, unique
sequences of the parasitoid nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis are nearly 10 times enriched with signal peptides compared to conserved sequences, suggesting that the
proliferation of these genes is accelerated because of their
defensive role against host immunity [15]. Aside from the
deeply divergent nematode comparisons [16], studies have
thus far been restricted to the eukaryotic crown group [17],
contrasts among species from the same order (i.e., primates,
rodents) or species belonging to a similar class (insects). This
situation is a consequence of the currently sparse coverage of
genome sequencing projects along the metazoan phylogenic
tree. Therefore, the addition of a crustacean to the growing
list of sequenced insect genomes will expand the analysis of
gene content among the ecologically diverse arthropod
assemblage and provide information on the degree of protein family expansions by appropriately rooting the insect
phylogeny.
Given the diversity of crustacean body plans, their fascinating biology and their key phylogenetic relationship to model
invertebrates with sequenced genomes, the paucity of crustacean molecular data is striking. Indeed, protein sequences
from all crustaceans represent only 0.1% of 6.9 million
records in the NCBI taxonomic database. Among crustaceans, the freshwater zooplankton Daphnia pulex has a rich
history of attracting attention from biologists – which now
involves researchers in the fields of ecology and evolution,
development, toxicology and genetics. Here, we present the
first systematic study of transcribed sequences in D. pulex.
The results of our survey highlight the diversity of crustacean
genes that are shared with insects, and also uncovers gene
family expansions that likely reflect the demands of aquatic
existence, particularly homeostasis, defense/immunity,
oxyregulation, and chemical sensing. In companion papers,
we describe the development of the first D. pulex microarray
used to investigate sex-biased transcriptional regulation of
these genes (Eads et al. submitted) and the genomic
response of this sentinel species to toxic metals commonly
found in the environment (Shaw et al. submitted, and in
prep). These studies are the initial steps in a coordinated
effort by the Daphnia Genomics Consortium [18] to build
the necessary data banks and reagents needed to discover
genomic changes responsible for the phenotypic diversity
within the genus and to gain new insights into crustacean
biology. This effort will soon include the first crustacean
genome sequence.
We report on the construction of D. pulex cDNA libraries and
the sequences and analyses of 1,546 ESTs, of which 1,414
represent approximately 787 nuclear genes. We analyze
these transcribed sequences against those of sequenced
model invertebrates. Comparing gene inventories by assigning homology among distantly related genomes is not trivial
[19]. The first challenge is to discriminate between genetic

gains or losses and genes whose sequences are sufficiently
divergent to escape detection. The problem is exacerbated by
lineage specific gene or genome duplications, by varying
rates of molecular evolution and by the sometimes fragile
association between sequence similarity and the preservation of gene functions [20]. The second challenge is to recognize that reference genome annotations and data banks are
fluid, even those for premier model systems. Therefore, this
study uses sequence similarity searches for Daphnia genes
against a number of different genomic databases for five reference species while intentionally setting low statistical cutoff values. By comparing Daphnia sequences to genes from
four insect species and using Caenorhabditis for an outgroup,
we point to functional classes that are shared with the
insects. The related microarray data of Eads et al. and Shaw et
al. in companion papers demonstrate that most of the
sequenced Daphnia genes are differentially transcribed in a
manner consistent with their putative functions, thus reinforcing their provisional annotations based on sequence
alignments to genes from model insects. Our study details
the comparative and functional characterization of Daphnia
transcripts using well studied insects and a phylogenetic
approach.

Results
Production and quality assessment of cDNA libraries
Equivalent non-normalized cDNA libraries were constructed from a genetically clonal Daphnia isolate sampled
from a natural pond along the Oregon coast. The clone
was cultured under growing conditions favoring parthenogenetic reproduction. Consequently, the animals were
predominantly juvenile females, adult females and
brood-carrying females with a small proportion of males.

The strength of conclusions derived from the comparative
analysis of expressed gene sequences rests, in large part,
on the quality of cDNA libraries. Therefore, we performed
quality control tests on 768 randomly chosen cDNA isolates. The cDNA size distribution was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR amplified inserts. The
average molecular weight of inserts sampled from the
libraries was 825 bp. To assess the cDNA diversity within
the libraries, we sequenced single pass 5' reads from the
cDNA inserts. Of the 768 sequence reads, 619 were
informative. Only four plasmids were void of inserts and
the failed reads (19%) were the result of capillary failures
of the sequencer. Following an assembly of the ESTs,
unique sequences comprised 68% of the total, reflecting
the relative abundances of specific cDNA within the nonnormalized libraries. This number diminished to 43%
with over twice as much sequencing effort (see below).
To assess potential contamination of cDNA clones derived
from prokaryotes and mitochondria, and to measure the
distribution of full length ORFs, we aligned the translated
sequences to proteins in Genbank. Of the unique

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/217

sequences, 50% matched Genbank entries with e-values <
1 × 10-10. A separate query of the NCBI non-redundant
protein database identified 204 sequences with e-value
scores < 1 × 10-27. A total of 34 ESTs (6%) were identified
as mitochondrial gene transcripts. No ESTs were identified as non-Daphnia. Thus, the cDNA libraries are high
quality with a high level of diversity and low levels of contaminant sequences.
To investigate whether the libraries contained full-length
or nearly full-length inserts, sequences from 170 clones
with high similarity to known proteins (Blastx < 1 × 10-27)
were investigated for the presence of a translational start
site. Of these sequences, 109 ESTs (64%) contained
unambiguous open reading frames with an annotated
ATG translational start site at their 5' end, and 44 ESTs
(26%) did not contain an ATG that aligned with the start
sites of corresponding database sequences. Of the remaining sequences, 7 ESTs (4%) were likely full-length because
gapped alignments of the amino acids suggested poor
evolutionary conservation at the N-terminus of the proteins, and 10 ESTs (6%) were unresolved because alignments failed altogether. We therefore estimate that 64–
68% of the cDNAs are full-length, or close to full-length.
This result may be an overestimate since many conserved
genes within our non-normalized libraries encode for
ribosomal proteins (34% of 170) which seldom have long
transcripts. Indeed, the maximum length of investigated
cDNA for open reading frames was < 2 kb, whereas the
maximum length of PCR amplified inserts was nearly 3.5
kb. However, when the number of cDNA with and without annotated start sites were compared and sorted by
their molecular weights, no association was found
between the proportion of full-length transcripts and the
size of cDNA, neither by including ribosomal genes (t =
0.39, df = 86; p = 0.70) nor by excluding these genes in the
comparison (t = 0.19; df = 60; p = 0.85). A separate investigation of the consistency in our production of fulllength or near full-length cDNA was conducted by calculating the proportions of sequences that shared nucleotides within the first 50 bases of the longest EST within
contigs (see below for assembly of contigs). Of 233 ESTs
forming 81 separate contigs, 202 (87%) shared the first 50
bp of the longest EST from each contig. These data suggest
that the majority of the cDNA clones are near full-length.
Analysis of EST sequences
In total, we produced 5' sequence reads from 1,648 cDNA
isolates. In addition to the 768 randomly selected clones,
880 were selected on the basis of their transcription profiles in microarray experiments. After the removal of vector, poly-A tails and poor quality reads (Table 1), 1,546
high quality ESTs with an average size of 540 bp (SD =
188, min = 107, max = 852 bp) remained to be clustered
(Genbank accession numbers EE681877-EE683416). The
ESTs were assembled into 804 clusters (including 568 sinPage 3 of 18

Functional annotation of assembled sequences
Confident over the quality of the D. pulex cDNA libraries
and EST sequences, we explored the range of likely biological or biochemical functions of the genes represented by
the ESTs sequences by querying the NCBI non-redundant
protein databank (NR) using Blastx [21]. Of the 787
assembled sequences, 452 (58%) matched at least one
known protein with an e-value threshold of 1 × 10-3 and a
minimal value of 33 aligned amino acids (Additional file
1). The distribution of their e-value scores showed that
26% of matched sequences have scores < 1 × 10-50, while
79% have scores < 1 × 10-10 (Figure 1a). Therefore,
searches for putative homologues in the protein database
gave strong to suggestive information regarding possible
biological and biochemical functions. As expected, a survey of the distribution of best Blastx matches against the
NCBI taxonomic domains showed that the majority
(72%) of assembled Daphnia sequences matched best
with those derived from other invertebrates (Figure 1b),

# assembled sequences

We investigated the proportion of assembled sequences
that may be composed of alternative transcripts of the
same genes by further clustering these sequences using
more relaxed parameters (see methods). Forty-seven additional clusters were discovered. Eleven were composed of
2 assembled sequences that are likely allelic variants of the
same genes, based on their matches to a single location in
a preliminary draft assembly of the Daphnia genome
sequence at the mid-point of the genome sequencing
project (4 × coverage; deposited at wFleaBase). These
allelic sequences were 84% to 97% similar to each other
over a range from 77 to 665 overlapping nucleotides. By
contrast, 21 of the additional clusters were of transcripts
derived from duplicated genes or from conserved gene
families, based on their matches to different locations in
the draft genome sequence. In 14 cases, the clusters were
composed of 2 sequences. Six clusters consisted of 3
sequences and a single cluster contained 4 similar
sequences that shared 86–93% of their nucleotides in
pair-wise comparisons. Overall similarities between
sequences from closely related genes ranged from 62% to
93% among 220 to 807 overlapping bases. As expected for
sequences originating from separate loci, their average
similarity (85.5%) was significantly lower than that of
allelic sequences (91%)(t = 2.02; df = 44; p = 0.01).
Finally, 4 of the additional clusters were composed of
paired splice variants from unique loci, while 8 clusters

contained from 2 to 4 alternatively spliced transcripts
from multiple loci. Therefore, the ESTs from this survey
provided sequence tags for up to 787 new Daphnia genes,
where some genes represent alternative transcripts or are
closely related transcripts from duplicated genes.

gletons) with an average of 1.93 sequences/cluster (SD =
3.95, min = 1, max = 95). After excluding clusters identified as mitochondrial DNA sequences, 787 nuclear genes
remained. These non-redundant sequences are hereafter
referred to as assembled sequences. We expect that some
pairs of assembled sequences will be found to derive from
the same locus, either due to excessive polymorphisms
between alleles, or because of the alternative use of 5'exons, or due to sequences from truncated cDNA clones
that failed to overlap. However, given the high proportion
of estimated full-length clones in the libraries, we anticipate the latter class to be small.

whereas 25% of the highest scoring hits matched best
with vertebrate sequences (including those from rodents,
primates and other mammals). The cDNA libraries are
free of contaminants, as only 6 assembled sequences (1%)
matched bacterial proteins. A closer examination of the
distribution of the best Blastx hits within the classes of
invertebrates showed that 79% of 323 assembled

sequences matched annotated proteins from insects (Figure 1c): 23% from Drosophila, 16% from Anopheles, 15%
from Apis, 4% from Bombyx and 21% from other insects.
This large insect constituency within the best Blastx
matches is clearly a consequence of the limited representation of sequences from Crustacea in the databanks. A
survey of the NCBI protein database revealed that out of

Page 5 of 18

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:217

6,897,314 archived sequences, only 10,485 (or 0.1%)
were from Crustacea. Only 19 assembled sequences (6%)
best matched proteins from Branchiopoda, the class that
includes Daphnia, while an additional 10 assembled
sequences best matched proteins from other classes of
Crustacea (Malacostraca, Ostracoda).
The assembled Daphnia sequences that matched annotated proteins from genetic model species were assigned
Gene Ontology (GO) terms using Blast2GO [22]. Their
putative functions spanned a spectrum of biological and
biochemical processes (Figure 2a). A total of 227 assembled sequences were assigned 799 biological process
terms from the fourth level of the GO. The predominant
terms were for metabolic processes ascribed to 190 assembled sequences. These terms included cellular metabolism
(22%), primary metabolism (21%), macromolecule
metabolism (18%), biosynthesis (10%), biopolymer
metabolism (7%), catabolism (5%) and regulation of
metabolism (< 1%). From among these processes, 72
assembled sequences were annotated to involve protein
biosynthesis, while 30 sequences involved the catabolism
of proteins. Sixteen sequences were attributed roles in chitin metabolism, including chitinases and peritrophins.
The next most predominant biological process terms were
related to the localization of cellular components (establishment of localization, transport, protein localization),
which were ascribed to 33 assembled sequences. Four of
these sequences coded for genes involved in oxygen transport (hemoglobin). Thirteen of these sequences encoded
genes with putative homologues in insects that specifically transport charged atoms like metals, of which seven
were also ascribed the functions of cell and ion homeostasis (Figure 2a). Finally, the remaining assembled
sequences with GO biological process terms were likely
involved in cell communication (such as signal transduction, cell signaling and adhesion), development, and
physiological processes that specify a response to external
stimuli, stress and cell death.
A total of 288 assembled sequences were additionally
assigned 371 GO molecular function terms (Figure 2b).
One hundred and thirteen sequences were suggested to
have catalytic activities that included hydrolase (17%),
transferase (6%), oxidorectuctase (4%), ligase (1%) and
isomerase activities, among others. Another 105 assembled sequences were likely involved in structural activities.
Their GO terms included structural constituent of the
ribosome (18%), structural constituent of the cuticle
(9%) and structural constituent of the cytoskeleton (1%).
Indeed, Daphnia genes matched to 67 of the total number
of 194 listed Drosophila ribosomal components. The next
major functional class was represented by 86 sequences
putatively involved in binding, which included 27
sequences coding for nucleic acid binding proteins, 18

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/217

carbohydrate (also listed as pattern and chitin) binding
proteins, 17 nucleotide binding proteins, and 15 proteins
that bind ions (calcium, zinc, iron). The remaining 11
sequences within this class were protein or lipid binding.
The final major functional class contained 26 assembled
sequences assigned to have transporter or carrier activities;
twelve sequences were annotated as ion transporters.
A number of assembled sequences likely encode conserved proteins involved in gene regulatory functions.
Daphnia genes with such potential functions based on
sequence homologies included 19 sequences involved in
transcription regulation and 14 sequences with translational regulator activity (Additional file 2). Examples of
regulatory genes involved in arthropod development
included a putative homologue to maf-S, which is a basicleucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor in Drosophila
that is required for the development of pharyngeal structures [23]. A Daphnia sequence also matched closely to the
Dorsal switch protein 1 (Dsp1) gene that regulates a number
of homeotic genes in Drosophila [24] and is therefore
involved in many developmental pathways. The putative
homologue to the fly gene shaggy (sgg) was identified,
which is part of the Notch, Wnt and Smoothened signaling pathways. Interestingly, two other regulators of the
Notch signaling pathway called Cdc42 [25] and neurotic
(nti or O-fut1) were also identified (Additional file 3). The
fly gene nti is specifically required for the proper localization of Notch at the cell surface [26], is essential for the
physical interaction of Notch with its ligand Delta, and is
an essential component for neurogenesis [27]. A second
gene involved in neurogenesis was identified as homologous to similar to Deadpan (Side), which is a basic helixloop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor. A Daphnia gene
was also matched with the fly zinc-finger-C4 transcription
factor (ZnFC4) called ftz transcription factor 1 (ftz-f1),
which coordinates stage-specific responses to the steroid
hormone ecdysone during metamorphosis [28] and
directs key developmental events at the transition
between prepupal and pupal stages of Drosophila development [29]. The putative functions for the other identified
transcription regulators (Additional file 2) included the
regulation of mitotic progression (the TFIIH transcription
factor Cdk7) and important roles during gametogenesis
(Rab11, bic, and the C2H2-zinc finger transcription factor
Meics). Other putative transcription factors included
genes matching CG1876I that contains a helix-turn-helix
(HTH) DNA-binding motif, CG18619 that contains a
bZIP DNA-binding motif and CG3224 that contains a
putative zinc-finger DNA-binding motif. Finally, among
the regulators of translation (Additional file 2), Daphnia
genes matched to 7 of the total number of 24 listed Drosophila translational elongation genes, yet matched only
to 2 of the 58 listed translational initiation genes in flies.
Their putative functions include DNA repair (RpLP0),

autophagic cell death (eIF-5A, Ef1gamma), immune
response (RpS6, Thor), regulation of cell growth (Thor)
and germ-line stem cell division (piwi).
To discover Daphnia genes that may jointly participate in
conserved biological processes or within gene interaction
networks, we investigated GO classes that were highly represented within our list of putative homologues to fly proteins. Significant functional groupings of Daphnia genes
were expected, because more than half of the sequenced
ESTs were chosen based on their differential expression
patterns in separate microarray experiments examining
developmental differences among males and females,
juveniles and adults, and toxicological responses to metals (Eads et al. submitted; Shaw et al. submitted). Seventeen genes were identified as candidates for
gametogenesis (Additional file 4); the majority of these
loci are involved in oocyte development in flies. Daphnia
loci matching the fly genes mago, Rab11, chic, Tm1, tsu and
bic may play conserved evolutionary roles in specifying
the anterior-posterior axis of the oocyte. All 6 genes save
bicaudal (bic) coordinate to assemble the pole plasm at the
posterior end of the Drosophila oocyte by localizing maternally derived transcripts for oskar. Moreover, mago, Tm1
and Rab11 are known to interact in genetic screens [30],
while a two-hybrid-based fly protein interaction study
[31] implicates tsu and possibly a translational elongation
RpLP1 homologue (Additional file 3) within this network.
One other Daphnia gene with weak sequence similarity to
Sop2 may have transport functions during oogenesis [32]
and two genes similar to the signaling gene Cdc42 and to
tsr were respectively identified, which are involved in follicle cell development [33,34]. Other genes similar to snf,
RpS3A and sgg in flies are also candidate for oogenesis.
Only two genes from our survey have known homologues
in flies that function in spermatogenesis. The gene Act5C
has a role in sperm individualization [35] and Meics is
associated with central spindle and mid-body microtubules during meiosis [36]. The chic gene in flies is important in gametogenesis for both sexes [37]. These Daphnia
genes sharing sequence similarities with Drosophila loci,
which are known to coordinate conserved developmental

processes, are prime candidates for functional investigations of early crustacean development.
In contrast to genes that participate in biological processes
that are shared between Crustacea and Insecta, gene families that have expanded in Daphnia compared to insects
may be indicative of new gene functions linked to their
specific biology and ecological setting. Therefore, we identified GO classes that were overrepresented within our
dataset compared to the Gene Ontologies for the D. melanogaster proteome using Fisher's exact test, and counted
multiple assembled sequences that matched to unique
Drosophila proteins (Additional file 1). Some lineage
expansions seemed to occur primarily by tandem duplication, while other radiations implied interesting functional
specializations or innovations. Among the 53 Daphnia
sequences that were provisionally annotated as cuticle
proteins and genes involved in chitin metabolism and
molting, only 13 singularly matched to a fly gene (Additional file 5). In most cases, 2–4 assembled sequences
matched to the same protein in the fly genome. Yet in
another case, 15 sequences matched with the D. melanogaster gene CG6305, which contains an insect cuticle
protein domain. Because we could not produce a reliable
sequence alignment for all 15 assembled sequences, we
conclude that the observed gene expansion was not an
artificial result from inadequate clustering of redundant
ESTs. Yet, from the pairwise comparisons of these 15
sequences, alternative splice variants for three genes were
identified: Contigs 20 and 180 showed >90% sequence
similarity, Contigs 23, 241 and 257 were >94% similar,
and Contigs 19 and 24 were >85% identical over shared
exons. Additional cDNA sequence data aligned to a completed genome sequence assembly for Daphnia is needed
to confirm that cuticle proteins are expanded gene families compared to insects. However, our study also uncovered clearer examples of gene expansions.
Unlike insects, which have three ferritin genes that play
important roles in iron homeostasis of cells (Fer1HCH,
Fer2LCH) and of organelles (Fer3HCH), the annotation
of Daphnia sequences revealed seven assembled sequences

with strong matches to Drosophila ferritin proteins (Table
2). Singlet 73 showed a strong match to the Drosophila
Fer1HCH protein via a Blastx alignment (bit score = 137),
but was poorly matched to crustacean sequences, even to
a D. pulex ferritin sequence within Genbank (AJ245734;
bit score = 71). The remaining six Daphnia sequences, plus
the Genbank entry, all aligned best to other crustacean
sequences and to the single Fer3HCH locus of Drosophila.
Therefore, Singlet 73 represents the first sequence of an
orthologous crustacean Fer1HCH gene. This result was
verified by constructing a phylogeny using representative
insect and crustacean protein sequences and by including
additional Daphnia ferritin-like sequences that were
extracted from an ongoing D. pulex cDNA sequencing
project (Colbourne et al. in preparation).

The Neighbor-Joining tree of 35 aligned amino acid
sequences clustered the pancrustacean ferritins into three
main groups (Figure 3). Ferritin 1 contained insect genes
plus two cDNA from Daphnia libraries; the Singlet 73
amino acid sequence was identical to a sequence extracted
from other cDNA libraries (branch G, Figure 3), while
branch F was a unique gene that stemmed at the base of
the group. The ferritin 2 group was solely composed of
insect genes. However, both crustacean and insect
sequences clustered into the third group containing the
insect ferritin 3 genes. Although this group contained single copies of the insect genes, the Daphnia genes were further subdivided among five branches representing distinct
ferritin 3 loci within the D. pulex genome. Branches D and
E were gene sequences derived from the other libraries
and showed 45% sequence divergence from each other,
while branches A, B, C each contained at least one
sequence from this present study. Further investigations
indicated that the multiple sequences clustering within
branches A, B and C are different alleles of the same locus.
Given that insects and more distant outgroups have only
three ferritin genes, Daphnia ferritins clearly expanded to
include possibly one additional ferritin 1 locus and minimally four additional ferritin 3 genes.

Gene conservation between the crustacean Daphnia and the
true insects
To examine the conservation of genes represented by the
EST sequences across Pancrustacea, we used tBlastx to
match the Daphnia assembled sequences to the NCBI UniGene sets for Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae,
Bombyx mori, Apis mellifera and included Caenorhabditis elegans for an outgroup. The assembled sequences were clustered into 27 groups, based on the strength of these
sequence matches across these taxonomic data sets. This
arrangement identified a variety of gene classes that share
patterns of sequence conservation (Figure 4). The first
class of interest was composed of 124 genes (16%) that
are conserved equally among all species included in this
study. This class was mostly enriched by genes that participate in protein metabolism including protein modifications (67 genes to GO:0044267; p = 4.8 × 10-7) plus 32
genes that were likely involved in cellular metabolism
(total of 99 genes to GO:0044237; p = 3.2 × 10-8). Other

genes enriched within this class included transcriptional
regulators (12 genes to GO:0045449; p = 2.4 × 10-3). The
second class of interest was composed of Daphnia
sequences that matched a nematode protein plus at least
one insect locus (183 genes) and others that had no
matches to nematode proteins yet matched to at least one
insect proteome (167 genes). Therefore, 21% of the
sequences were derived within the Pancrustacea – thus
shared by Daphnia plus at least one insect in our set – or
lost within the nematode. Especially noticeable were 43
assembled sequences that had no detectable homologues
in worms and were uniformly conserved across the four
insects (Figure 4). Genes that were absent in nematodes
were enriched with structural constituents of the cuticle
(26 genes to GO:0042302; p = 1.1 × 10-12) and loci having
serine-type endopeptidase activity (10 genes to
GO:0004252; p = 3.6 × 10-4), of which 8 genes were annotated as also having chymotrypsin activity (GO:0004263;
p = 0.003). The third class of interest consisted of 309
genes (39%) that had no matches to insect proteomes. At
face value, this result suggests that these orphaned genes
are unique to Daphnia or Crustacea; either they have been
lost in the insects – as suggested by 17 Daphnia genes (2%)
showing sequence similarity to proteins in the nematode
database – or acquired by Daphnia or Crustacea since
diverging from their last common ancestor.
There are many potential sources of errors that can inflate
our estimate of the fraction of unique Daphnia genes compared to the selected pancrustaceans. For instance,
sequences may fail to align for technical reasons. This may
occur if the Daphnia sequences included untranslated
regions (UTR) of the cDNA and not the coding regions.
Indeed, the mean size of predicted open reading frames
(ORFs) within this class differed significantly from that of
genes having sequence matches to insect proteomes (t =
12; p < 0.0001; df = 785). For example, over half of the
assembled sequences with no matches had ORFs smaller
than 225 bases compared to 16% of matched sequences
(Figure 5). Therefore, the trivial explanation that these
sequences were mostly UTR cannot be dismissed for a
large fraction of these genes. Other technical explanations
for the absence of matches include genes that had not
been annotated or included in the insect UniGene sets.
Further analysis by aligning the non-matching sequences
to all predicted Drosophila gene translations uncovered 9
additional matches with e-values ranging from 4 × 10-3 to
2 × 10-10. Another 4 Daphnia sequences were found to
have matches to Drosophila proteins, based on tBlastx
searches against the full genome sequence (e-values ranging from 4 × 10-3 to 9 × 10-29). Finally, given the tremendous evolutionary divergence between Daphnia and
insects, matches may not have been detected from loci
that are not under similar evolutionary constraints. We are
unable to investigate this last point with the current data.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/217

It was previously shown that gene preservation is correlated with gene function. In particular, correlations have
been found between the level of gene conservation and
sex-biased gene expression among insects [38,39]. There
is reason to believe that such correlations are extended to
other biological functions. In comparing 787 Daphnia
assembled sequences to those of insects, 39% of the genes
were characterized as orphans because no sequence
matches were detected. Interestingly, the orphan genes
were not randomly distributed among the gene expression classes. Three specific observations were made by
incorporating the gene expression datasets (Table 3). First,
47% of male-biased genes did not match insect proteins
compared to only 22% of female-biased genes. The two
fold difference in sequence similarity among the sexbiased genes in Daphnia is consistent with differences seen
among the insects, reflecting the overall accelerated evolution of male reproductive genes [40]. Second, 46% of
metal responsive genes did not match insect proteins
compared to only 34% of non metal responsive genes.
Third, genes that were responsive to metals and not sexbiased included the greatest proportion of orphans
(50%), whereas genes that were female biased and not
responsive to metals included the fewest (12%). These
results suggest that lineage specific genes are correlated
with certain biological functions associated with an
organism's ecological challenges.

Discussion
Diversity in the gene complement of species arises from
the expansion of shared ancestral gene families, the loss of
existing genes, or the acquisition of newly invented genes
[12,41-43] and can account for lineage specific innovations. It is estimated that nearly half of the paralogous
gene families within eukaryotic genomes originated by
lineage specific gene expansions; many are related to an
organism's unique mode of life [12]. For example, the
evolution of disease resistance and of self-incompatibility
in plant mating systems can partly be attributed to the
radiation of novel receptor-like kinases within the plant
genome [44]. In Drosophila, the trypsin-like serine proteases have expanded to 178 genes [45], suggesting important novel defenses by the fly immune system. Odorant
receptors form the largest recorded nematode-specific
gene family expansion – numbering ~800 genes compared to 60 genes in flies [46] – which suggests the importance of chemosensing in the soil environment. A similar
genomic inventory for a branchiopod crustacean genome
will soon be made available by the Daphnia Genomics
Consortium to ultimately contrast the evolutionary diversification of arthropod genes in relation to the aquatic and
terrestrial habits of these animals. Yet, crustaceans and insects
also share many key biological features due to their common
ancestry as members of the Pancrustacea. This study presents
the results of a first investigation into the sequence conserva-

tion and putative function of D. pulex genes, which are identified by sequencing a set of 1,648 cDNA isolates that were
interrogated in three microarray studies. From clustering the
ESTs, we characterize 787 Daphnia loci based on their
sequence similarity to genes within a variety of databases,
including those for the insects Bombyx, Apis, Anopheles, Drosophila, and for the nematode Caenorhabditis.

Shared genes
In this study, we characterize two non-normalized cDNA
libraries from a clonal population reared under standard
laboratory conditions. As a result, the diversity of biological processes and molecular functions represented
among the sequenced Daphnia genes is relatively modest.
Almost one quarter of the genes are likely involved in metabolic processes. More than one quarter of the genes are
predicted to have catalytic or structural activities.
Although a large fraction of arthropod genomes is composed of genes having these basic cellular functions (35–
40% of Drosophila genes for instance), the diversity of
transcribed genes discovered in Daphnia would be augmented by creating libraries from animals under a variety
of environmental conditions. Yet, our libraries do contain
cDNA from daphniids of mixed life stages, including
gravid females, embryos, juveniles and a small number of
males. Therefore, some Daphnia genes have sequence similarity to insect proteins associated with reproduction,
development and growth. These include regulatory genes
like Dsp1, which operates in patterning the developing fly
embryo by acting as a corepressor of the transcriptional
regulator Dorsal protein [47]. Under different circumstances, Dsp1 can also act as an activator or repressor of
thorax-group and polycomb-group homeotic genes in
Drosophila [24]. Because all known homeotic targets of
Dsp1 are conserved in sequence and function in metazoans, Daphnia's putative orthologue is likely to share this
regulatory function. As expected, this gene transcript is
enriched in pregnant females compared to males in Daphnia microarray experiments (Additional file 2). Putative
homologues to three regulatory genes (sgg, Cdc42, O-fut1)
within the Notch signaling pathway are identified, which
is one of a small number of signal transduction pathways
that are highly conserved in insects and throughout animal evolution. The gene sgg is a point of convergence
between the Notch and Wnt/wingless signaling pathways
[48]. We predict that further sequencing of Daphnia cDNA
will uncover more genes operating within these and other
conserved signaling mechanisms: nuclear receptors, Sonic
Hedgehog, receptor tyrosine kinases, JAK/STAT, and BMP/
TGF-beta. An example is a homologue to the ftz-f1 nuclear
hormone receptor that is also found on the microarray.
Like all arthropods, Daphnia growth is synchronized with
molting and the regeneration of the cuticle, which is governed by pulses of ecdysteroid hormones. Although one
isoform of ftz-f1 is a transcriptional regulator of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/217

embryonic segmentation gene fushi tarazu, a second isoform is necessary for larval molting in Drosophila and its
premature expression results in the disruption of the epicuticle, suggesting that targets for this transcription factor
in flies include genes involved in cuticle formation [49].
The function of this gene is conserved in Caenorhabditis,
where it is also required for epidermal development and
regulates molting [50]. No differential expression is
observed on the microarray for the signaling genes discussed above (Additional file 3). Overall, our survey of
Daphnia ESTs uncovers genes expected to be present in
crustacean genomes based on their important regulatory
roles in conserved cellular and developmental processes.
Roughly half of the cDNA isolates that are sequenced for
this study are chosen based on their differential expression patterns between males and females and on their
responses to toxic metals. These experimental conditions
reflect two research interests of our labs involving Daphnia: the genetic basis of environmental sex determination
and cyclical parthogenesis, and understanding how populations adapt to environmental change in aquatic habitats
including industrial pollutants. Therefore, we expect that
the provisional annotations of 787 assembled sequences
include a fraction of genes sharing functional attributes
that would in part be shared with other arthropods and
others that are more reflective of Daphnia's unique biology. Certainly, 17 genes are candidates for gametogenesis.
The majority of these genes play significant roles in oogenesis. In particular, six sequences have strong matches to
conserved genes that specify the oocyte polarity and four
loci are known to genetically interact in flies. By contrast,
only three of these 17 Daphnia sequences match genes
that are known to function during spermatogenesis in
Drosophila. This discrepancy between the numbers of sex
specific transcripts for genes involved in reproduction is
likely caused by the small representation of males within
the Daphnia cultures used to create the cDNA libraries.
Equally impressive are the large number of cuticle proteins identified.

Expanded protein families
In the comparative study of the Anopheles and Drosophila
proteomes [51], cuticular proteins were noted to be particularly active in their lineage specific expansions and deletions. This present study identifies 53 sequences that are
either structural components of the cuticle or involved in
chitin metabolism. Their abundance within our dataset is
a consequence of their transcriptional responses to the
microarray experiments; all but four of the assembled
sequences were differentially regulated on the arrays. Yet
as noted in the comparisons between the two dipteran
insects, many Daphnia sequences share similarities to single loci within insect genomes. Among these cuticle loci
are 15 assembled sequences that are best aligned to a sin-

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:217

gle Drosophila gene when compared to the rest of the fly
proteome. Alternative transcripts account for only 4
sequences. Thus, no less than 11 loci remain as possible
representatives of a large lineage specific gene expansion
of Daphnia cuticle genes. Further investigations are obviously required to verify this finding, including more thorough sampling of the Daphnia transcriptome and
functional data such as in situ hybridizations to support
the notion that these genes may have contributed to biological innovations. Regarding the 15 transcripts on the
current array, all but one is enriched in males compared to
females, and with the addition of differential expression
patterns under metal stress, these transcripts can be
grouped into five separate expression profiles.
A first compelling case for lineage specific gene expansion is
made by investigating the diversity of ferritin genes within
the Daphnia ESTs. Except for Aedes aegypti, their number of
ferritin genes are evolutionarily conserved [52]. Ferritins are
the principle iron storage proteins for nearly all animals, and
their abundance within cells is controlled in part by iron-regulatory proteins that interact with iron-regulatory elements
(IREs) within alternatively spliced 5' UTRs of certain mRNAs
[53,54]. In insects, ferritins consist of a heavy-chain
homolog (HCH) and a light-chain homolog (LCH) forming
heterodimers that function in the secretory pathways of cells,
and which also appear to act as iron transporters [52]. The
genes encoding the subunits (Fer1HCH, Fer2LCH) are positioned in the Drosophila genome in a back-to-back orientation, enabling coordinated regulation of their transcription
[55]. This feature is conserved in all insects studied thus far
[52]. Except in Bombyx, which has IREs within the UTRs of
both subunits, insect IREs are predominantly localized to the
Fer1HCH locus. Recently, a third Drosophila ferritin
(Fer3HCH) has been described that controls iron homeostasis of the mitochondria, yet its transcription is not responsive
to iron treatment [56]. As in humans and mice, the gene is
predominantly expressed in adult testis. Our phylogeny of
Daphnia ferritin gene transcripts uncovers six or seven distinct Daphnia loci (Figure 3). The branch F locus cannot be
unequivocally included as part of the ferritin expansion until
a description of the gene is available based on its alignment
to the genome sequence. However, all of the other loci are
defined based on their sequence alignments to distinct
genome scaffolds assembled at this point in the Daphnia
genome sequencing project (not shown).
Branch G of the ferritin phylogeny represents the first
characterized crustacean orthologue to the insect
Fer1HCH genes. Following naming conventions, we designate this gene as Dpu_Fer1HCH. The gene has four
introns and is the only Daphnia ferritin on the array showing differential expression for all three experimental conditions; its transcripts are enriched in males, depleted
when exposed to cadmium and enriched when challenged
by arsenic (Eads et al. submitted; Shaw et al submitted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/217

and in prep). Therefore like the insect subunit, this locus
responds to metal ion treatments. The other five Daphnia
ferritin genes are homologous to the insect Fer3HCH loci
and are arranged within a monophyletic cluster, suggesting that they originate from a series of gene duplications.
Indeed, each has retained two introns, despite showing
amino acid sequence divergences from 14 to 56%. These
genes are designated Dpu_Fer3HCH-1 to Dpu_Fer3HCH-5.
Regrettably, expression data is not available for genes representing branches D and E. However, the microarray results
show that the remaining three loci differ in their transcriptional responses to the experimental treatments. Like the
Drosophila Fer3HCH gene, elements on the array whose
sequences cluster within branch C do not respond to metals,
yet unlike the fly gene, Contig 26 transcripts are enriched in
females. By contrast, a single element on the array representing branch B is enriched in males, and all 4 cDNA elements
from this gene respond to arsenic treatment. These differences are likely the result of undetected splice variants. Lastly,
all elements representing branch A show elevated expression
patterns when treated with arsenic, yet no sex specific expression is detected. These additional observations strongly support the existence of a Fer3HCH gene expansion that
diversified within a crustacean lineage leading to D. pulex. A
homologue to the insect Fer2LCH genes has yet to be discovered in Crustacea.

Orphan genes
The present study is a preliminary annotation of the
emerging D. pulex genome using comparative and functional data to predict the fraction of genes unique to Daphnia. Aside from gene expansions that are suggestive of
adaptations specific to aquatic environments, accounts of
orphan genes (defined here has having no matches to
insects) can offer equally important insights into crustacean biology from the perspective of a class of genes that
usually has the shortest average lengths and are most rapidly evolving [51,57]. Our searches using Blastx of 787
assembled sequences against the proteome of four insects
suggest that ~68% of the Daphnia genes are shared with at
least one insect. Less than half of these show matches to
the individual protein databases of Bombyx, Apis, Anopheles
and Drosophila. This discrepancy is likely a combined
effect of incomplete datasets and of lineage specific gene
losses among the insects. Taking into account associated
matches to proteins from our chosen outgroup
(Caenorhabditis), we discover that 21% of the Daphnia
genes are either derived within Pancrustacea or lost within
the nematodes. Those genes that are uniformly conserved
across all four insect species are primarily cuticle proteins
and serine proteases having trypsin activity. These gene
families are also listed as two of the top 20 most significant expansions or reductions between the Anopheles and
Drosophila proteomes [51], which diverged some 250 million years ago. It is tempting to speculate that, in both
crustaceans and insects, a fraction of gene families are
Page 13 of 18

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:217

equally active in their evolutionary diversification. Such
gene families would be candidates for detailed investigations leading to a better understanding of how Pancrustacea succeeded in exploiting its range of ecological settings.
A careful evaluation of assembled sequences showing no
matches to the insect proteomes suggests that ~1/3 of the
genes are either derived in crustaceans or lost within insects.
This estimation is admittedly from a very limited sampling
of the total number of Daphnia genes and is derived from
sequencing non-normalized cDNA libraries that were created under standard laboratory conditions and interrogated
by microarrays. Although this fraction cannot be extrapolated to the genome, it is comparable to findings from other
taxa. In D. melanogaster, 10% of the genes have homologous
best hits in non-insect species plus 19% have no homologous hits to other species, while the combined estimate for A.
gambiae is 21% [51]. Within the nematodes, which diverged
ca. 600 mya, 23% of the genes are estimated to be unique to
species [14]. Of course, the fraction of species specific genes
declines dramatically when evaluating close allies; comparing two Caenorhabditis species reveals that 4% of their genes
are unique [58], and the mouse gene set differs from the
human set by only 1% [59]. A future investigation of a larger
D. pulex gene collection against an equivalent dataset for the
congener D. magna [60] will help define the true estimate of
species specific genes in Daphnia. Additional contributions
of EST data for non-branchiopod crustaceans will further
define the crustacean proteome and shed light on the biological factors that led to the group's divergence from insects.
However, the sequences presented by our present study are
accompanied by expression data from three microarray
experiments, which authenticate the orphan sequences as
genes and support the notion that ecological factors are more
likely to contribute to sequence and functional divergences
among genomes.
Combining the gene expression data obtained by Eads et
al. (submitted) and Shaw et al. (submitted, and in prep)
for the 787 assembled sequences reveals that the majority
of genes with sex biased expression, including developmental and regulatory loci, do not respond to the cadmium and arsenic metal toxicity. A clear example is
provided by genes predicted to regulate translation. All 15
genes save two are differentially expressed in males versus
females and only three genes also show transcriptional
responses to metal toxicity (Additional file 2). We find
that this class of sex biased genes proportionally contains
the fewest orphans. The relatively larger number of
sequences with matches to the insect proteome suggests
that genes functioning during development and reproduction are generally well conserved between crustaceans and
insects. Further work is required to elucidate crustacean
and Daphnia specific components of these central processes. By contrast, nearly half of the Daphnia genes that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/217

respond to metals, but show no differences between the
sexes, are likely absent in insects. This is explicable in light
of the fact that metal exposure is an ecological stressor that
varies between aquatic and terrestrial environments [61],
which has catalyzed the evolution of certain protein types
(cuticles, iron metabolism, defense) to increasingly specialized functions. The extent to which ecology has
shaped the genome organization of pancrustaceans is an
important future direction for research. For example, the
mosquito A. gambiae spends part of its larval stage in
water; by comparing genes differentially expressed during
this stage to expression patterns in D. pulex, it may be possible to examine the effects of an aquatic lifestyle on the
expression of particular protein families.

Conclusion
This work investigates the sequence preservation and
expansion of genes from the crustacean D. pulex compared
to insect proteomes, based on the analysis of 1,546 ESTs
that represent 787 unique transcripts. Our sampling of
cDNA from this emerging genomic model species reveals
sequences that have largely been conserved in both
groups representing arthropods evolving in water or on
land. Genes that function for reproduction, regulation of
cellular processes and development are identified; some
are known to genetically interact in the model insect species Drosophila. This provisional annotation of Daphnia
sequences is further verified by companion studies using
cDNA microarrays to examine transcription in males,
females and embryos (Eads et al. submitted) and under
toxic metal stress (Shaw et al. submitted, and in prep).
Here we identify cases of lineage specific gene family
expansions by a series of gene duplications. For instance,
there are as many as seven distinct ferritin loci indicated
by cDNA and genome data, including a crustacean orthologue to the insect Ferritin 1 locus and a monophyletic
grouping of five Ferritin 3 genes. Finally, our results suggest that, as we study the genomes of organisms distantly
related to the classic model laboratory organisms, the
majority of unknown genes will be functionally linked to
the organisms' ecology. Compared to the gene sets showing differential expression among developmental stages,
we observe that sets responding to ecological stress contain a greater proportion of loci with no sequencing similarity to previously characterized arthropod genes. A
comprehensive inventory of putative orthologs, orphan
genes, and lineage specific gene expansions coupled with
functional genomics data will provide important insights
into genomic changes that led to the adaptive radiation of
crustaceans.

Methods
cDNA library construction and quality assurance
For the purpose of creating a collection of cDNA for printing onto microarrays, a clonal isolate of a D. pulex /D. puli-

caria hybrid (called log52) was cultured under standard
laboratory conditions by Jim Haney (University of New
Hampshire) within a large, aerated, 200 liter container of
filtered lake water by feeding a concentrated monoculture
of green algae (Scenedesmus acutus). Animals at all life
stages were harvested and immediately processed. Total
RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Sciences) and was subsequently purified using the RNeasy
protocol (Qiagen). The cDNA libraries were constructed
by Darren Bauer and Kelley Thomas (University of New
Hampshire) using the Creator SMART (Clontech) system
by following the manufacture's instructions. The cDNA was
ligated into the pDNR-LIB vector supplied by Clontech.
To control for bias towards smaller fragments inserting
during the ligation of cDNA into plasmids, reaction were
performed on four cDNA size fractions. Size fractionation
was performed as per the SMART cDNA protocol using the
CHROMA SPIN-400 column. The column was prepared
for drip procedure by inverting several times to completely resuspend the gel matrix and storage buffer was
drained by gravity flow. Seven hundred microliters of column buffer were added to the column and allowed to
drain out, then 100 μl of a mixture of Sfi I-digested cDNA
and xylene cyanol dye were applied to the matrix and
allowed to fully absorb. One hundred microliters of column buffer were added to the matrix and allowed to fully
absorb, then 600 μl of column buffer were added and single-drop fractions were collected in 16 tubes. The profile
of the fractions was verified by running 3 μl of each fraction on a 1.1% agarose/EtBr gel at 150v for 10 minutes.
The samples were then pooled into two size classes; fractions 7 and 8 were pooled into the "large size" and fractions 9 & 10 were pooled into the "small size".
From the libraries, 768 colonies were chosen for quality
assurance tests. The bacterial transformants were amplified in selective 2xYT media, plasmids were purified by an
alkaline lysis protocol according to the manufacturer's
instructions (PerfectPrep, Eppendorf) and quantified by
spectrophotometry. The molecular weights of cDNA
inserts were measured by PCR amplification of cDNA
inserts using the M13 vector primers M13fw (GTG TAA
AAC GAC GGC CAG TAG) and M13rev (AAA CAG CTA
TGA CCA TGT TCA C) followed by agarose gel electrophoresis against standards and visualized using a Kodak
440cf imaging station. Sequencing reactions were performed by priming at the 5' end of cDNA using vector
primer pDNRlib30-50 (TAT ACG AAG TTA TCA GTC GAC
G), ABI BigDye chemistry and the 3730 sequencer. Vector
and poor quality sequences were trimmed from the
sequencing reads and ESTs were assembled into contigs
using the SeqManII software (DNASTAR package).
Homologies with Genbank entries were discovered using
Blastx against the non-redundant (nr) protein database.
Those sequences with expectation-values better than 1 ×

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/217

10-27 were further examined for the presence of an annotated ATG start codon at the 5' end of the open reading
frame (ORF). This last step was accomplished using
NCBI's ORF finder tool [62]. Only those sequences whose
Methionine aligned (including gaps) with the first amino
acid of complete sequences were considered full-length
transcripts.

Characterization of the ESTs
On thousand twenty-eight additional cDNA samples were
chosen for sequencing based on the microarray results
obtained by Eads et al. (submitted) and Shaw et al. (submitted, and in prep). The sequencing reactions were carried out as outlined above. All 1,648 sequence reads from
this study, with their quality scores, were obtained from
ABI sequencer data files using phred [63] with default
parameter values. The reads were then processed by discarding low quality and vector sequences using Lucy
v1.19p [64] with default parameter values, by removing
poly-A tails using EMBOSS trimest [65] and by discarding
sequences with lengths under 100 bases. The remaining
high quality EST set was reduced to a non-redundant set
of unique gene transcripts by clustering with phrap [66]
using the following parameters: mismatch penalty = -5;
minimum match = 50; minimum score = 100. The resulting contigs and singlets that matched to mitochondrial
gene transcripts (Genbank accession NC 000844) using
Blastn were removed from subsequent analyses. To investigate whether the set of assembled sequences contain
alternative transcripts of the same loci, the contigs and
singlets were further clustered using the SeqManII software with the following relaxed parameters: match size =
12; maximum added gap length = 70; minimum percent
match = 80; no gap penalty; gap length penalty = 0.70.
The putative open reading frames (ORFs) for the assembled
sequences were determined in three steps using Prot4EST
v2.2 [67] with DECODER having been disabled, ESTScan –
which is an integral component of Prot4EST – and getorf
from EMBOSS. The ORFs were selected during the first step
when the assembled sequence translations aligned to proteins within the NCBI NR database with a Blastx e-value better than 1 × 10-8. Failing this first step, the ORFs where
selected during the second step using ESTScan or simply by
recording the longest uninterrupted ORFs when they were
located on the positive stands of the sequences. Otherwise,
the longest ORFs were selected during step three, based on
the results obtained by using the EMBOSS program that
restricted sequence translations from the negative strand.
This restriction was justified by observing only 3 ORFs on the
negative strand from among 376 predictions from step one.
Numerous sequence similarity searches were done for
both the high quality EST set and the assembled
sequences. First, queries were performed against the NCBI
NR protein database (Genbank release 148) using a local
Page 15 of 18

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:217

installation of the WU-BLAST program [68]. The taxonomic domains were added to the results by parsing the
taxa ID from the top match for each query and by retrieving the associated information from the NCBI [69]. Second, for a more confident assessment of whether the
assembled sequences were shared with insects, they were
compared to protein sequences archived in the NCBI UniGene sets for Bombyx mori (build #7), Apis mellifera (build
#5), Anopheles gambiae (build #29) and Drosophila melanogaster (build #37) using tBlastx with an expectation
threshold set at E < 0.005. The same search was performed
against the Caenorhabditis elegans (build #23) UniGene
database to judge whether the differences can be attributed to gains or losses within the representative insects or
crustacean. The assembled sequences were clustered based
on the distribution of bit scores across the databases using
self organizing maps followed by k-means clustering
within 28 nodes in Cluster v2.11 [70]. Third, to further
ascertain whether the assembled sequences can be aligned
to known proteins, queries were made against all Drosophila melanogaster gene translations that are predicted by
the annotation v4.2.1 of the genome sequence assembly
and against the genome nucleotide sequences of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans using tBlastx.
The assembled sequences were classified into gene ontology (GO)-defined functional classes using the program
Blast2GO [22] and by extracting the GO annotations from
FlyBase for sequences that strongly matched D. melanogaster gene transcripts. The putative gene annotations
were examined for functional classes that are enriched
within our lists of Daphnia genes compared to the total set
of GO terms for all Drosophila genes using Gostat [71] and
by testing for the enrichment of GO terms within subsets
of the assembled sequences using Fisher's Exact Test executed within Blast2GO.
