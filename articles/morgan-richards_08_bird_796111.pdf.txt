Abstract
Background: Evolutionary biologists are often misled by convergence of morphology and this has
been common in the study of bird evolution. However, the use of molecular data sets have their
own problems and phylogenies based on short DNA sequences have the potential to mislead us
too. The relationships among clades and timing of the evolution of modern birds (Neoaves) has not
yet been well resolved. Evidence of convergence of morphology remain controversial. With six
new bird mitochondrial genomes (hummingbird, swift, kagu, rail, flamingo and grebe) we test the
proposed Metaves/Coronaves division within Neoaves and the parallel radiations in this primary
avian clade.
Results: Our mitochondrial trees did not return the Metaves clade that had been proposed based
on one nuclear intron sequence. We suggest that the high number of indels within the seventh
intron of the β-fibrinogen gene at this phylogenetic level, which left a dataset with not a single site
across the alignment shared by all taxa, resulted in artifacts during analysis. With respect to the
overall avian tree, we find the flamingo and grebe are sister taxa and basal to the shorebirds
(Charadriiformes). Using a novel site-stripping technique for noise-reduction we found this
relationship to be stable. The hummingbird/swift clade is outside the large and very diverse group
of raptors, shore and sea birds. Unexpectedly the kagu is not closely related to the rail in our
analysis, but because neither the kagu nor the rail have close affinity to any taxa within this dataset
of 41 birds, their placement is not yet resolved.
Conclusion: Our phylogenetic hypothesis based on 41 avian mitochondrial genomes (13,229 bp)
rejects monophyly of seven Metaves species and we therefore conclude that the members of
Metaves do not share a common evolutionary history within the Neoaves.

Background
The study of avian phylogeny abounds with examples of
both unstable taxonomy and apparent convergent evolution. Indeed, in many cases the incidence of these conditions is correlated because taxonomists are at times misled
by convergence in their systematic inferences. Progress
with resolving avian phylogeny and thus identification of
morphological/behavioral
convergence
has
been
enhanced by the use of molecular data that provides a
source of characters independent of morphology. In particular, the use of large scale DNA, and in particular mitochondrial, sequence data has proved beneficial in
stabilizing the avian tree [1,2].
In contrast, a very different perspective on the phylogeny
of birds suggesting a very different biogeographic history
and classification was recently inferred from analysis of a
single nuclear locus. Fain and Houde [3] proposed a
major new division of Neoaves (that is, all extant birds
except paleognaths [ratites and tinamous] and Galloanserae [ducks, chicken and relatives], see Figure 1).
Their division of Neoaves into Metaves and Coronaves
was based on data from the seventh intron of the β-fibrinogen gene (FGB-int7), including insertions and deletions.
The proposed new group of Metaves comprises an intriguing and eclectic set of taxa, including the swifts, hummingbirds, flamingos, tropicbirds, grebes and kagu. Fain
and Houde [3] liken the division of Neoaves into two
major clades to the well known convergence of marsupial
and placental mammals and list eleven examples of ecological and/or morphological convergence among
Metaves and Coronaves. Their examples of convergence
are in most cases, widely accepted and include for example the convergence of form and feeding of swallows and
swifts as aerial insectivores. However, in contrast to the
placental/marsupial division that is supported by at least
50 anatomical and physiological synapomorphies [4-6]
the Metaves clade does not have a single published morphological character to support it, and there is no clear
geographic separation from Coronaves.
Although the proposed Metaves/Coronaves division is
supported by analysis of FGB-int7, there has, as yet been
no similar pattern obtained from other genes. For example, Ericson et al. [7] confirm that although they also
found the Metaves/Coronaves split with the FGB-int7
data, it was not evident in analyses of four other nuclear
loci (and Chubb [8] has a fifth nuclear locus). Curiously
though, when the four nuclear loci were concatenated
with FGB-int7 for phylogenetic analysis, this increased the
support for the Metaves/Coronaves split compared with
FGB-int7 by itself [7]. In a cladistic analysis of morphological data Livezey and Zusi [9] did not find support for
Metaves and declared it to be a 'nomen nudum' (name
published without an adequate description). Thus, there

is just a single nuclear locus giving a signal for Metaves,
and it is therefore essential to test the proposed division
using other classes of data. We examine here support for
the Metaves/Coronaves split using data from complete
mitochondrial (mt) genomes.
The avian tree from complete mitochondrial genome
DNA sequence is expanding steadily [1,2,10] and is in
agreement with morphological and nuclear DNA data in
rooting birds between paleognaths and neognaths [2].
Mitochondrial introgression does not misled phylogenetic inferences at the depth of the divergence of the avian
radiation and the range of mutation rates among mitochondrial genes make this an excellent single loci to study.
However, previous mitochondrial datasets could not test
the Metaves/Coronaves hypothesis. For example, Gibb et
al. [1] and Slack et al. [2] did not include any members of
the Metaves, and Watanabe et al. [10] and Yamamoto et
al. (unpublished) report one each; great crested grebe and
tropicbird respectively. Fortunately, we now have the
complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome from
seven bird species classified as Metaves by Fain and
Houde [3]. The five reported here are the ruby-throated
hummingbird (Archilocus colubris), the common swift
(Apus apus), Australian little grebe (Tachybaptus novaehollandiae), kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus) and flamingo (Phoen-

icoptera ruber roseus). To these five we add two Metaves mt
genomes from Genbank; great crested grebe (Podiceps
cristatus) and tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda), reported by
Watanabe et al. [10] and Yamamoto et al. (unpublished,
AP009043) respectively. In addition, we report a New
Zealand rail (takahe, Porphyrio hochstetteri) because it
allows us to distinguish between the traditional view of
kagu and rails as being members of the same order (Gruiformes [11,12]) and the novel view of kagu in Metaves
and rails in Coronaves [3].
In the process of testing the Metaves/Coronaves division,
the mitochondrial genomes of the new taxa reported
allow us to appraise other hypotheses about the phylogeny of modern birds. Irrespective of the validity of the
Metaves/Coronaves division, we expect the hummingbird
and swift to be sister taxa in this dataset (Apodiformes
[11,9]). The position of the Gruiformes (including rails
and kagu) is more equivocal; Livezey and Zusi [9] placed
the rails very deep in the Neoavian tree and sister to the
shorebirds (Charadriiformes) but Cracraft [11,13] infered
the rails (and the kagu) as much more recently derived
than the earliest Neoaves, within a large group comprising
the raptors, shore, sea and aquatic birds.
Of the more controversial examples of avian ecological
convergence proposed we can now test with analysis of
complete mitochondrial genomes whether grebes and
loons have converged on their form as "foot-propelled
divers with high wing loading" [3,14]. Several authors
have suggested that loons, flamingos, and grebes belong
in the same part of the avian tree [15] and this grouping
can also be tested. A consensus on the placement of flamingos has not been achieved [9,12,16] although many
now consider the flamingos to be close relatives of grebes
[8,14,17,18]. The name Mirandornithes was coined by
Sangster [19] for the flamingo/grebe clade and this relationship is supported by a shared derived louse fauna
[20]. However, recent analysis of morphological data
found grebes and loons to be sister taxa, with neither
being closely related to flamingo [9]. The sister group to
the putative flamingo/grebe clade remains unresolved;
morphology indicates flamingos are sister to the shorebirds (Charadriformes [16]) or have a highly aquatic
ancestor [18], whilst DNA-DNA hybridization indicates
tropicbirds are closest [14]. Within the Metaves, Fain and
Houde [3] placed grebes closer to kagu and hummingbird/swift than to flamingo, although resolution within
Metaves is generally poor.
The relative positions of the tropicbird and frigatebird are
also uncertain. Traditionally they have been considered as
part of the Pelecaniformes (pelicans, shags, darters, gannets, boobies, frigatebirds and tropicbirds) but this is now
in question [21,9]. Tropicbirds may be in the Metaves

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/20

clade [3], or basal to the vultures and penguins [22] and
pelicans might be closer to the shoebill and hamerkop
than to booby, darter and cormorant [14]. Putative
Pelecaniformes are represented in our data set by the pelican, tropicbird and frigatebird.
Seventh intron of β-fibrinogen
To return to the data supporting the Metaves/Coronaves
clades, one source of ambiguity or false signal with FGBint7 is the nucleotide sequence alignment. The FGB-int7
dataset on 147 bird species before alignment consists of
DNA sequences that vary in length from 620 bp to 1155
bp but, when aligned, the dataset stretches to 1930 nucleotide sites. Furthermore, no single site is conserved across
all taxa and indels are so frequent in this intron that every
site is coded as a gap in at least one bird. Without conserved sites, alignment of the DNA sequences is problematical at best, and could lead to false phylogenetic signal
[23]. Erroneous alignment can result in apparent phylogenetic signal among non-homologous sites (or gaps) and
thus mislead tree reconstruction [24].

The conservative approach to alignment that we use with
mitochondrial protein sequence is to remove all gaps and
flanking sites on either side of the gap back to a constant
site. If this alignment approach was applied to the FGBint7 dataset of 147 birds there would be no sites left in the
alignment! On the other hand, if an alignment could be
confirmed, then the presence/absence of major features
(such as major gaps) could be informative as 'rare
genomic changes' [25]. A good example is the case of retroposed elements identified in placental evolution by
Kriegs et al. [26]. In general, we know that when there are
a very large number of character states, parsimony is a
maximum likelihood estimator [27]. Thus gaps in DNA
sequences, if they are uniquely definable, are expected to
be excellent characters for phylogeny and have, for example, been useful in resolving parrot evolution [28]. The
major question with the FGB-int7 data therefore remains
whether the sequences can be reliably aligned.
Another potential difficulty with the Metaves/Coronaves
result which is based on a single nuclear locus, is that
many nuclear genes exist as multiple (paralogous) copies
[29]. It is possible that, by chance, one paralogue was
amplified and sequenced in some species (Metaves) and
an alternative copy in other species, thus resulting in two
clades.
We use four approaches to help evaluate the FGB-int7
sequences for phylogenetic reliability. We located the parsimony sites that unite Metaves. We examined the sensitivity of the final alignment to the reference tree that
guides the DNA sequence alignment in programs such as
Clustal X, to detect whether an alternative tree would give

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:20

an equally good alternative alignment. We then reversed
the direction of the sequences for alignment which is a
proven method for detecting cases where alignment is relatively arbitrary [30]. Finally, we tested whether there was
any evidence of paralogous copies by amplifying, cloning
and sequencing FGB-int7 from two bird species.

Results
Complete mitochondrial genomes
The six new mitochondrial genome sequences have been
deposited in GenBank under the following accession
numbers: ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilocus colubris: EF532935, > 16,356 bp [incomplete due to repeats in
the control region]), common swift (Apus apus:
AM237310 EMBL, 17,037 bp), Australian little grebe
(Tachybaptus novaehollandiae: EF532936, 18,002 bp), kagu
(Rhynochetos jubatus: EF532933, 16,937 bp)) and greater
flamingo (Phoenicoptera ruber roseus: EF532932, 17,446
bp); a New Zealand rail (takahe, Porphyrio hochstetteri:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/20

EF532934, 16,988 bp). The standard avian gene order was
found in five of these birds, the exception being the flamingo which has the remnant of a second control region
as seen in the falcon (CR2 [1,31]). Control region
sequence was not used in the analysis.
Phylogenetics
We have previously found with both birds [32] and mammals [33], as well as with simulated data [34,35], that the
addition of an outgroup can disrupt a well-established
ingroup tree, typically due to long-branch attraction. The
ingroup tree without outgroups is more likely to be correct
as shown with simulated data [34,35]. Therefore, as 'best
practice', we ran analyses using data representing the
Neoaves ingroup only (Figure 2) and then included the
Galloanserae outgroup [1,2] for comparison (Figure 3).
The main conclusion is that neither unconstrained tree
has the seven Metaves taxa together. The Metaves question

will be discussed first, then the other aspects of the tree
later.
We then constrained the seven Metaves taxa (kagu, tropicbird, flamingo, two grebes, hummingbird, and swift) to
form a clade (as in Figure 1A). In order to have the same
model, the optimal parameters from ModelTest were estimated on both trees. Both the unconstrained MrBayes and
ML trees are highly significantly better than the constrained Metaves tree. The likelihood values for the ML
trees are -162992.8 and -163611.6 respectively (≈ 620 loglikelihood units difference, and on the ShimodairaHasegawa p ≈ 0.0000). Considering that the SH test is
regarded as a conservative test [36], the mitochondrial
data strongly reject the Metaves/Coronaves subdivision.
This leads us to ask why the seventh intron of the β-fibrinogen gene gives support for the Metaves/Coronaves division.
Seventh intron of the β-fibrinogen gene
Thus far, the seventh intron of the β-fibrinogen gene
(FGB-int7) is the only locus giving direct support for the
Metaves/Coronaves subdivision. Alternative hypotheses
were tested regarding the alignment and the number of
copies of this intron. We reduced the number of taxa to
analyse the FGB-int7 sequences (see methods), and
resolved the Metaves clade using ML and Maximum Parsimony (MP) although monophyly of Coronaves and
Metaves had only 54% and 85% bootstrap support,
respectively (5000 MP replicates). From a total of 1075
sites (although, as aligned in the full dataset there are
1930 sites) there are 22 parsimony sites for Metaves. Seventeen of these parsimony sites occur in the first 400 positions of the alignment, although there is no obvious
clustering (around indels for example). Trees reconstructed following alternative alignments using the addition of simulated data from the mtDNA tree still
recovered Metaves as a group. This was also the case when
the sequences were reversed and realigned [30].

No paralogous of FGB-int7 were found from the 26 clones
that were sequenced from one Metaves (kagu), and one
Coronaves (a New Zealand rail, weka, Gallirallus australis).
Occasionally single nucleotide differences were found
between clones from the same bird, but certainly no
changes that would indicate duplicate copies that may
have diverged 60–80 Mya [2,37]. Thus no evidence of paralogs was found, and so this does not appear to be a likely
explanation for the Metaves grouping.
Avian evolution
An unexpected feature of our analysis of the whole mitochondrial DNA sequences (Figure 3) was that the MrBayes
topology (outgroup included) when enforced in PAUP*
provided a tree with a lower likelihood score than the best

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/20

ML tree found using heuristic search (although not significantly different with SH test (p = 0.486)). These two trees
are similar; differing in their placement of the flamingo/
grebe clade as sister to the shorebirds (Charadriiformes;
gull/turnstone/oystercatcher). The heuristic search ML
tree put the flamingo/grebe clade between the falcon
clade and the rest of the water-carnivores, while the better
MrBayes tree puts the flamingo-grebe as sister to shorebirds. We looked at the stability of this clade by reducing
noise in the data set using site-stripping. This method systematically RY-codes or removes the most variable nucleotide sites (scored as the average of their consistency and
retention indices) and then re-runs MrBayes ([38] and see
methods section below). The flamingo/grebe (Mirandornithes) and flamingo/grebe/shorebirds clades were
returned in all MrBayes analyses, even when 7.12% of
sites were re-coded as RY and a further 10% of sites were
excluded. In contrast, the pelican and frigatebird were no
longer grouped together at this level of site stripping,
though the hummingbird/swift clade was retained. Swift
and hummingbird (Apodiforms) came together in all
trees, falling outside the large and very diverse group of
raptors, shore and sea birds [2].
Kagu and takahe (rail) did not come together in any of our
unconstrained trees (Figures 2, 3). The kagu is basal to the
passerine/woodpecker/aracari clade and our rail representative (takahe) basal to the hummingbird/swift clade.
However, when we constrained kagu and takahe to be
monophyletic the resulting tree was not significantly
worse than our best tree (SH test; P = 0.181). Some of the
uncertainty in our dataset is illustrated on the MrBayes
consensus network (Figure 2) – some partitions place the
takahe basal to the hummingbird/swift, and some place it
outside this clade but still basal to the water-carnivores.
Similar uncertainty is seen on the kagu lineage where we
have signal for kagu to be basal to the woodpecker/aracari
clade. The ability to show the presence of both signals (for
example, takahe basal to the water-carnivore clade; or
basal to swift/hummingbird; Figure 2) is an important
advantage of combining tree and network methods [39].

Discussion
The phylogenetic hypotheses (Figures 2, 3) generated by
our whole mitochondrial genome sequences using different models are generally concordant. The relationships
among the Neoaves (the ingroup) differ little whether or
not the outgroup (Galloanserae) is included (Figures 2,
3). Where the two phylogenies differ is in small changes
in the position of the loon, penguins, albatross/petrel,
stork/heron, and pelican/frigatebird. In all other respects
the inclusion of the Galloanserae does not affect the relationships resolved and thus the basic stability of the tree
is observed.

The seven birds in our mitochondrial sequence dataset
that represent elements of the Metaves group do not form
a monophyletic clade. Ericson and co-workers [7] also
failed to obtain the Metaves clade using four nuclear
genes, although they could with the inclusion of FGBint7. No other dataset, molecular nor morphological, has
found direct evidence for the division of the Neoaves into
Metaves and Coronaves [8,9,17]. Nor could Fain and
Houde [3] identify a single shared derived morphological
character to unit the members of Metaves. We cannot
explain why FGB-int7 provides a division not seen in any
other data set but this division is based on fewer than 25
nucleotide sites (approximately 2% of their data), and the
monophyly of these two clades were supported by only
85% and 60% of maximum parsimony bootstraps. It
should be noted that Fain and Houde [3] characterize the
members of Metaves as taxomonically problematic (p.
2565) and our analyses indicates why this has been the
case for both the kagu and tropicbird. From our mitochondrial sequences we can infer that neither kagu nor
tropicbird are closely related to other members of the
orders into which they are currently placed (Gruiformes
and Pelecaniformes, respectively). However, there is no
suggestion in our mitochondrial data that we should
unite these 'problematic' taxa into a single clade [3].
Given the contradictory evidence from mtDNA, we
appraised the quality of phylogenetic signal from FGBint7 data that returned monophyly of the Metaves clade
with weak support. However, we did not find evidence for
obvious sources of the anomalous phylogeny; we found
no indication that FGB-int7 has a paralog within birds
and the alignment appears reasonable. So why does this
one gene return a pattern not seen from any other characters? The intron is evolving rapidly enough to accumulate
differences between sister species and has been used to
resolve phylogenetic relationships within and among genera (e.g. woodpeckers [40]; amphibians [41]). However,
the alignment of an intron with many indels and no constant sites could lead to the formation of artifact clades
when studying relationships among orders that are more
than 60 million years old. We note, again, that with our
alignment of mitochondrial proteins, we exclude sites
between a gap and a site that is constant across the dataset,
and if we applied this conservative alignment criterion, we
would have to exclude all FGB-int7 sites. Overall, our conclusion is that the whole mitochondrial genome data
strongly disagrees with the Metaves/Coronaves split, but
the 22 parsimony sites in the FGB-int7 uniting the
Metaves remain unexplained. Given the complete absence
of support from other markers we doubt the FGB-int7 pattern is due to the shared evolutionary history of the bird
species within Metaves. Nevertheless, we expect that FGBint7 will be an excellent marker for studying evolution

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/20

within genera and families where there should be no
problems of alignment.
The Metaves/Coronaves split returned from analysis of
FGB-int7 provided an intriguing framework in which to
explore the evolution of avian ecology. The split, apparently characterized by multiple examples of convergent
evolution (independent origins of similar feeding ecology/behavior) indicated a clear phylogenetic and hence
historical dichotomy; a major, old division in the evolution of birds. Given the failure of any additional nuclear
or mtDNA sequence data to support either of the Metaves
or Coronaves clades and the clear contradiction from
morphology and current taxonomy (e.g., five orders of
birds are rendered polyphyletic by FGB-int7), where does
this leave observations of convergent evolution in birds?
Clearly examples of convergence of form and behavior
exist across the phylogeny of birds and were well recognized prior to the proposal of the Metaves/Coronaves
split. Of the three more controversial examples of avian
ecological convergence proposed by Fain and Houde [3]
we can comment on two: tropicbirds and boobies as
pelagic soaring plunge divers, and grebes and loons as
"foot-propelled divers with high wing loading".
Two of the three Pelecaniformes represented are sister
taxa; frigatebird and pelican (Figures 2, 3), in agreement
with Livezey and Zusi [9]. But in contrast to Livezey and
Zusi [9], the tropicbird does not appear to belong to this
clade. Placement of the topicbird is still difficult because
trees of almost equal value place it basal to raptors (buzzard/osprey/eagle MrBayes; or falcons ML), but never with
other members of Metaves. Our findings support those
from DNA-DNA hybridization where tropicbirds were
basal to a large clade of aquatic birds that includes the
New World Vultures [22]. The tropicbird is not part of the
Pelecaniform clade (represented here by the pelican and
frigatebird) which also includes the boobies [42], and
therefore the similar feeding methods of the tropicbird
and boobie look likely to have resulted from convergent
evolution. Similarly, although the grebes and loons are
part of the same large clade they are not sister taxa and so
their similar appearence and diving methods must also
constitute convergence. In conjunction with the nine
other examples of avian morphological convergent evolution [3] one can conclude that the process is not an
uncommon phenomenon within the bird radiation in
general. However, these examples of morphological and
ecological convergence do not support the Metaves/Coronaves division.
We find support in the whole mitochondrial genome data
set for the sister relationship of swifts and hummingbirds
(Apodiformes), and find support for the grouping of flamingo and grebe (the Mirandornithes of Sangster [19]).

Page 7 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:20

This may well form a sister clade to the Charadriiformes
(shorebirds); our site-stripping technique showed this
relationship to be stable, from which we infer a common
evolutionary history. In keeping with this idea, morphological studies of extant and fossil species reveal that early
flamingos resembled more typical wading birds and place
the Phoenicopteridae within the order Charadriiformes
[16].
We find little support for the hypothesis that the kagu is
related to the rails, although when forced together the
resulting tree was not significantly worse. Kagu appears to
have no close allies in our data set and has long been recognized as a difficult species to place [12]. Cracraft [11]
and others place kagu and rails within the Gruiformes
along with the mesites, bustards, seriemas, sunbittern,
sungrebe, trumpeters and cranes. In contrast, Livezey and
Zusi [9] found the rails to be sister to the shorebirds
(Charadriiformes), and the Gruiformes (including kagu)
to be sister to this pair. As the takahe and kagu are (unexpectedly) not allies we now have two long edges
(branches) within our phylogeny that have the potential
to disrupt stable clades. Addition of sunbittern to breakup the kagu long edge, and a crane, or another rail to
break the takahe long-branch should solve this problem.

Conclusion
We conclude that avian mitochondrial genomes reject the
hypothesis of a shared evolutionary history for hummingbirds, kagu, tropicbirds and flamingos. Although some
major Neoaves clades remain to be sequenced (for example cuckoos and pigeons) it is very unlikely that the addition of any avian species could force the seven Metaves
species in this dataset into a monophyletic clade. The phylogenetic tree of 41 bird species represented here has provided new hypotheses such as the sister relationship of the
shorebirds and the flamingo/grebe clade that can now be
tested with other datasets.

Methods
The birds
The ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilocus colubris) tissue was provided by the Louisiana State University
Museum of Natural Science and is sample LSUMNZ B26279. The Australian little grebe (Tachybaptus novaehollandiae) is from the Australian Museum Sydney (sample
EBU 9986). The New Zealand rail (takahe: Porphyrio hochstetteri) was provided by the Department of Conservation
via Massey University Veterinary Pathology, and the New
Caledonian kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus) sample was a gift
from Christophe Lambert, New Caledonia. The common
swift (Apus apus AM237310 EMBL) was provided by Stefan Gabrielsson (Katastrofhjälp fåglar och vilt, Kristianstad/Bromölla) and the greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus
ruber roseus) came from the Auckland Zoological Park.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/20

Genomic DNA was extracted from the hummingbird,
kagu, rail, flamingo and grebe tissue at the AWC using
25–50 mg of liver and the High Pure™ PCR Template
Preparation Kit (Protocol Vb; Boehringer Mannheim)
according to the manufacturers instructions. To minimize
the possibility of obtaining nuclear copies of mitochondrial genes (numts), mitochondrial genomes were first
amplified in 2–3 long overlapping fragments (3.5 – 12 kb
in length) using the Expand ™ Long template PCR System
(Roche). The products were excised from agarose gel using
Eppendorf gel extraction columns. Long-range PCR products were then used as templates for multiple rounds of
short-range PCR of overlapping fragments 0.5 – 3 kb in
length. Primers were found from a database maintained
in our laboratory and described by Slack et al. [43].
Sequencing was performed using BigDye® Terminator
Cycle Sequencing reagents according to the manufacturers
instructions (Applied Biosystems), and the nucleotide
sequences read on an ABI 3730 automated sequencer
(Applied Biosystems). For each genome, overlapping
sequence fragments were assembled and checked for
ambiguity using Sequencher™ 4.2.2 (Gene Codes Corp.).
Where necessary PCR products were cloned using standard techniques to resolve length heteroplasmy in control
regions arising from microsatellite repeats [1]. At least
three clones were sequenced for each region to guard
against PCR errors. In all cases, overlaps between
sequences were sufficient to ensure synonymy (usually ≥
100 bp between sequences from short-range PCR; and a
total of 1 – 4 kb between the different long-range products. Sequence identity was confirmed through BLAST
searches of the NCBI database [44], confirmation of
amino acid translation in coding regions and alignment
with other species.
In addition to the six new bird mitochondrial genomes
reported in this paper, 35 other complete avian mt
genomes were included in the analyses, 29 neoaves and
six Galloanserae. The Galloanserae taxa are: chicken (Gallus gallus; GenBank accession number AP003317), Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica; AP003195), magpie goose
(Anseranas semipalmata; AY309455), redhead duck (Aythya
americana; AF090337), greater white-fronted goose(Anser
albifrons; AF363031), Australian brush-turkey (Alectura
lathami, AY346091). The 29 neoaves taxa are: rifleman
(NZ wren, Acanthisitta chloris; AY325307), gray-headed
broadbill (Smithornis sharpei; AF090340), fuscous flycatcher (Cnemotriccus fuscatus; AY596278), superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae; AY542313), village
indigobird (Vidua chalybeata; AF090341), rook (Corvus
frugilegus; Y18522), ivory billed aracari (Pteroglossus azara,
woodpecker
(Dryocopus

DQ780881), American kestral (Falco sparverius,
DQ780880), Eurasian buzzard (Buteo buteo; AF380305),
osprey (Pandion haliaetus, DQ780884), Blyth's hawk eagle
(Spizaetus alboniger, AP008239), turkey vulture (Cathartes
aura, AY463690), blackish oystercatcher (Haematopus ater;
AY074886), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres;
AY074885), southern black-backed gull (Larus dominicanus, AY293619), Oriental stork (Ciconia boyciana;
AB026193), red-throated loon(Gavia stellata; AY293618),
little blue penguin(Eudyptula minor; AF362763), blackbrowed albatross(Diomedea melanophris; AY158677) and
Kerguelen petrel (Pterodroma brevirostris; AY158678),
white-faced heron (Ardea novaehollandiae; DQ780878),
rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome; NC 008138),
great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus; NC 008140), frigatebird (Fregata sp; AP009192), Australian pelican (Pelecanus
conspicillatus, DQ780883), red-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon
rubricauda; AP009043). Paleognath taxa were not
included because the paleo/neognath division has been
well established for mitochondrial genomes[1,2]. Thus
we rooted our Neoaves trees with the six Galloanserae
sequences.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Nucleotide sequences for each gene were aligned separately in Se-Al v2 [45]. Protein-coding genes were aligned
using translated amino acid sequences and RNA genes
were aligned based on secondary structure. The resulting
dataset has 12 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes and
21 tRNAs (lacking tRNA-Phe because sequence data is
missing in some taxa). Gaps, ambiguous sites adjacent to
gaps, the NADH6 (light-strand encoded), and stop
codons (often incomplete in the DNA sequence), were
excluded from the alignment. The full analysed mtDNA
dataset was 13,229 bp in length.

In previous work [46-48] we found that RY-coding of the
most variable partitions of the nucleotide data (especially
the 3rd codon position) was advantageous. This recoding
increases the proportion of changes on internal branches
of the tree (that is, 'treeness'), reduces effective differences
in nucleotide composition (relative compositional variability; RCV), and was shown to increase concordance
between mitochondrial and nuclear datasets. RY-coding
does improve the ML scores, but because RY-coding is not
strictly nested within nucleotide-coding (M.A. Steel, pers.
comm.) it is not valid to compare their respective ML
scores directly. However, because of the better fit of the
data to the model (higher treeness, and lower RCV) this
has been our preferred method of analysis of vertebrate
mitochondrial data. Thus the trees reported here have the
third codon positions of 12 protein-coding genes recoded
as R (instead of A & G), and Y (instead of C & T). The full
data set is available [49]. Analysis used standard programs
including ModelTest [50] PAUP*4.0b10 [51], MrBayes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/20

3.1.2 [52], and consensus networks [39]. We ran 1000
unconstrained
ML
bootstrap
replicates
with
PAUP*4.0b10 on the Helix computing cluster [53], plus a
Bayesian analysis using chains of 107 generations. For
some runs, we constrained the seven 'Metaves' taxa to be
monophyletic (see Figure 1) and used a ShimodairaHasegawa (SH) test [54] implemented in PAUP* to compare this ML tree with the unconstrained ML tree (RELL,
one-tailed test, 1000 bootstrap replicates).
Site-stripping
The most serious problem for reconstructing deep-level
phylogeny from mitochondrial sequences is substitution
saturation [55,56]. Aside from the direct effect of superimposed substitutions eroding phylogenetic signal, 'non-historical' biases (such as that derived from compositional
non-stationarity) accumulate more rapidly at faster evolving sites. In a number of recent studies [56,57] we have
attempted to reduce these problems by identifying partitions among which the sites have (on average) high signal
erosion and then either RY-code them (using only information from the slower transversions), or excluding that
partition altogether. This earlier approach may not be
optimal as some phylogenetically useful sites are excluded
simply because they group under some prior definition
(e.g. codon position) with many fast evolving sites. So
here we test a noise reduction technique in which the
information retained from the sequence is determined on
a site-by-site basis. 'Noise reduction', in general, is a standard technique in many areas of science [58].

In an earlier noise reduction technique using site-stripping [38], sites were excluded from analysis if changes
occurred at these sites within a few predefined closelyrelated taxa. As a proxy for their utility, in the present
study, sites are scored as the average of their consistency
and retention indices (CI and RI, respectively). The CI and
RI are calculated on the consensus tree that upholds relationships among the primary data matrix that are
uncontroversial with respect to prior studies, and also
receive a Bayesian posterior probability of 1.00 in the
unstripped analyses. Any groupings that do not conform
to these requirements are collapsed so as to avoid the circularity of increased support resulting from the exclusion
of sites that might have been influenced by conflict with
that grouping. The consensus tree we used was: ((((quail,
chicken), brush turkey), ((goose, duck), magpie
goose)),((((rook, indigobird), lyrebird), (broadbill, flycatcher), rifleman),((gull, turnstone), oystercatcher), flamingo,(great crested grebe, grebe), takahe, hummingbird,
kagu, heron, (petrel, albatross), (little blue penguin, rock
hopper penguin), stork, turkey vulture, tropicbird, ((falcon, kestrel), forest falcon), ((hawk eagle, buzzard),
osprey), swift, pelican, frigatebird, (aracari, woodpecker),
loon)).

Variants of the primary dataset were RY-coded and sitestripped at progressively higher threshold levels of site
utility, (CI+RI)/2 = 0.08, 0.12, 0.16, 0.20, 0.24, using the
Perl program site_strip_search.pl [49] For each iteration,
individual site utility scores that fall below specified
threshold levels are RY-coded. When the resulting site utility score remains below the specified level, then the site is
excluded altogether. Bayesian inference analyses were carried out on each of these 'noise reduced' data matrices.
The seventh intron of the β-fibrinogen gene
Fain and Houde's [3] dataset of the seventh intron of the
β-fibrinogen gene (FGB-int7) was reduced to 35
sequences, corresponding to the 35 taxa common with
our mitochondrial dataset [see Additional file 1]. The 35
taxa include pairs that represent equivalent branching patterns (the same position in a cladogram relative to the
other taxa in each dataset) although the species are not
always identical, or in some cases, even sister taxa. The
alignment of the taxon-reduced FGB-int7 dataset was
checked visually in Se-Al v2, with the Metaves group at the
top, and the dataset exported as a Mega file. In this format,
the positions of the sites that potentially contribute to
phylogenetic signal in the dataset, could be examined and
compared. To evaluate the utility of the intron positions,
phylogenetic analyses were conducted by equally
weighted maximum parsimony (MP), with indel characters treated as missing data using PAUP* 4.0b10 [51].

We tested whether tree reconstruction from the 35-taxa
FGB-int7 data is stable with respect to the internal reference tree generated during the Clustal X alignment. A 500
nucleotide dataset was simulated in Seqgen 1.3 [59] on
the mitochondrial tree, under the ML-GTR+I+Γ optimisation for the original mt data. Only the 35 taxa common to
both the FGB-int7 and mitochondrial datasets were
included in the simulated tree. Insertion of the simulated
data ahead of the FGB-int7 sequences should drive the
alignment to conform more closely to the original mt tree.
We then performed phylogenetic analyses using the combined alignment (simulated sequences plus FGB-int7
sequences) and using only the realigned FGB-int7
sequences.
In addition, we reversed the sequences of the FGB-int7
dataset, and re-aligned it using Clustal X as recommended
by Landan and Graur [30]. This reversed dataset was also
used for phylogenetic analyses. Landan and Graur [30]
have shown that reversing the direction of the sequences
before an alignment is made can result in quite different
trees from the unreversed alignment if the true alignment
is ambiguous. The change in result arises because many
programs, when faced with tied values may always take
the first alternative (i.e., not breaking ties randomly).
Conversely, an alignment that is robust to reversing the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/20

sequences supports the original alignment. Finally, using
the primers FIB-BI7U and FIB-BI7L [60] we amplified the
FGB-int7 from two birds; one Metaves (kagu), and one
Coronaves (a New Zealand rail, weka, Gallirallus australis).
The products were cloned and a total of 26 clones were
sequenced to detect possible paralogous copies in the
same genome. Thus we had a range of approaches to test
the robustness of the β-fibrinogen seventh intron data.
