Abstract
Background: One of the approaches for conducting genomics research in organisms without
extant microarray platforms is to profile their expression patterns by using Cross-Species
Hybridization (CSH). Several different studies using spotted microarray and CSH produced
contradicting conclusions in the ability of CSH to reflect biological processes described by speciesspecific hybridization (SSH).
Results: We used a tomato-spotted cDNA microarray to examine the ability of CSH to reflect
SSH data. Potato RNA was hybridized to spotted cDNA tomato and potato microarrays to
generate CSH and SSH data, respectively. Difficulties arose in obtaining transcriptomic data from
CSH that reflected those obtained from SSH. Nevertheless, once the data was filtered for those
corresponding to matching probe sets, by restricting proper cutoffs of probe homology, the CSH
transcriptome data showed improved reflection of those of the SSH.
Conclusions: This study evaluated the relative performance of CSH compared to SSH, and
proposes methods to ensure that CSH closely reflects the biological process analyzed by SSH.

Background
DNA microarrays enable researchers to conduct largescale quantitative experiments on gene expression, which
can elucidate the mechanisms and the prediction of biological processes, the assignment of functions to previously un-annotated genes, the grouping of genes into
functional pathways, and the prediction of the activities of
new compounds [reviewed in [1]].
One approach to microarray-based genomic research is to
use cross-species hybridization (CSH) by hybridizing

RNA of the studied organism to a microarray chip which
contains transcripts of genes of a closely related species.
CSH may be used in such cases when a microarray of the
studied organism is unavailable (e.g. [2-6]). This is true
for many organisms for which extensive cDNA libraries
are not available (e.g. [7]). CSH is also used for comparative genomics, where transcripts from closely related species are hybridized to a cDNA microarray derived from
one of them, for revealing evolutionary conserved mechanisms and pathways of expression control [8-12].

Different microarray platform types have been used for
CSH. Affymetrix oligo-micorarrays were used for CSH in
several studies such as [13-18]. Some encountered difficulties in obtaining relevant biological knowledge from
CSH (e.g. [13,15,18]). However, once sub-probe sets were
created and used for data analysis, a marked increase in
the ability to extract valid expression profiling from CSH
occurred (e.g. [15,17]). Other CSH studies used custom
oligos arrays (e.g. [19]). Once these were compared to
affymetrix-CSH studies, it was suggested that longer oligos
produce better results for CSH [19]. The longest probe
microarrays available are the cDNA microarrays; these are
assumed to be more suitable for CSH since cDNA probes
may be sufficiently large so that small interspecies differences in nucleotide sequences might not affect the analytical results [4,8,20]. Indeed it seems that biologically
meaningful information may be obtained from CSH over
cDNA microarrays [2,3,5,6,10,11,21-25]. However, some
CSH studies have demonstrated spurious results for CSH
performed on cDNA arrays, even for closely related species [8,9].
The use of CSH presupposes the ability to analyze the
gene expression profiles, so that biologically meaningful
knowledge can be obtained. This paradigm was examined
in several studies. Renn et al. [3] quantified gene expression profiles of closely related species using CSH. Their
results suggested similar profiles for closely related taxa
(that diverged >65 million years ago; MYA), but less similar profiles for distantly related species (that diverged
~200 MYA). By performing co-hybridization of RNA
extracted from two species on a microarray platform that
contained probes of both species, Gilad et al. [9] compared the experimental error between these two CSHs;
where a third SSH experiment served as a reference. A
marked effect of sequence mismatches on hybridization
signal, even between organisms that are only ~1%
diverged was demonstrated, indicating that even in this
case CSH results might be biased.
To the best of our knowledge, our present study uses for
the first time RNA samples from the same species, for both
cross-species (heterologous) and species-specific (homologous) hybridizations. Thus, a direct comparison between
results generated by CSH and SSH was feasible, and determination of the quality of CSH compared to SSH was
determined.

Results and discussion
To examine whether CSH can produce data that reflects
SSH data, we used the same RNA samples for both CSH
and SSH microarray experiments. RNA samples were
extracted from nematode-infected and non-infected (control) potato plants, sampled at two time-points (5 and 10
days – both represent early time-points of nematode

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/110

infection). These RNA samples (i.e. test samples) were cohybridized with a reference sample by CSH to a tomato
microarray and by SSH to a potato microarray. The reference sample was pooled from all 8 samples (2 time-points
of infected or non-infected plants; 2 biological replicates
were performed). The CSHs were designated as 'PT' for
potato samples on tomato microarrays; the SSHs were
designated as 'PP' for potato samples on potato microarrays. The data discussed in this publication including
detailed description of the potato and the tomato microarray platforms and all of the PP and PT expression data,
have been deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO; [26]) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE3584.
Microarray representation of species genes
To assess whether the tomato microarray may be used for
representation of a biological process that occurs in
potato, we determined the extent to which the tomato
microarray represents known potato genes. On the one
hand, ESTs, which are the only sequences available for the
tomato and the potato microarray printed clones, may not
support determination of gene representation; their short
size may inhibit accurate identification of transcripts (i.e.
lack of overlapping between them may not necessarily
indicate different genes). On the other hand, the complete
sequences of the microarray printed clones – although
may be the ultimate sequence class for comparisons – are
not available for the tomato and potato arrays. This might
also be the case for other microarrays of spotted clones.

Therefore, we had to evaluate the complete clone
sequences by using their assigned contigs (i.e. unigenes),
and use unigenes for determination of tomato and potato
microarrays representation of potato known genes. For
this purpose, sequences of unigenes that were represented
by the microarray platforms were used to blast against
sequences of a potato unigene database (i.e. TIGR consensus build of potato, version 10.0). Sequences that
matched with an E-value less than e-05 were considered
homologous. Using this level of homology matching, the
tomato microarray represents 29% (6,147 out of 21,063
potato TCs) of the potato known genes. In comparison,
the potato microarray represents 51.5% (10,860 out of
21,063 potato TCs) of the potato known genes. On the
tomato microarray, 83% (6,147 out of 7367) of the
tomato genes were homologous to potato known genes,
compared to 100% (10,860 out of 10,860) of the potato
microarray genes that were found homologous to potato
known genes (Additional file 1).
It should be noted that until a genomic database is complete, these representation levels may change. Species representation level may be affected by the dynamics of a
unigene database built. That is because unigenes may be

split and re-merge until a unigene final form is attained;
they may reflect splice variants [27,28] and some of them
may be incorrect [29]. Thus, once unigenes are chosen for
determination of microarray representation, the completeness of a unigene database in terms of both the percentage of the genes that are already represented by
unigenes in the database and their quality (i.e. how accurately they represent a real gene) should be considered. In
addition, the origin of the libraries in terms of plant organ
or developmental stage, used for microarray construction
or gene database may also affect the representation level,
as may be the case in this tomato-potato comparison.
Notably, cross-species representation levels may not necessarily be a proof of representation quality. Approximately 16% (992 of 6,147) of the potato unigenes
registered more than one hit during blast between the
tomato microarray unigenes and the potato unigene database. This may have been a result of sequence mismatches
due to cross-species sequence divergence. Alternatively,
multiple hits may result from genes being members of
gene families (which may also be the case for SSH). Multiple hits might lead to a reduction in the accuracy of the
reflection of the biological process, since 2 or more different transcripts might hybridize to the same spot on the
array.
In conclusion, taking into consideration that the tomato
microarray is a cross-species platform to potato, and contains less spotted clones than the potato microarray
(9,140 and 15,254 spotted clones, respectively), the 6,147
potato unigenes represented by the tomato microarray
(compared to the 10,860 potato unigenes represented by
the potato microarray) suggest that the tomato microarray
may be used in the present study for potato gene expression profiling.

compared their results. We first, determined the average
correlation coefficient of the reference sample signal
between all pairs of hybridizations within PT or PP experiments. For this purpose we used present and marginal
calls separately for PT or PP (14,868 and 9,140 clones of
the PP and PT experiments, respectively, had present or
marginal calls). Reference sample signal correlation coefficient of 0.88 (SD = 0.036, N = 28) or 0.89 (SD = 0.02, N
= 28) was determined for PP or PT experiments, respectively. The similarity between the correlation coefficients
suggests hybridization quality consistency for the same
RNA sample for CSH, compared to SSH. This similarity
implies repeatability of the CSH between the RNA and the
microarray probes, despite low homology matches of a
transcript to a spot, or where more than one transcript
hybridizes to one spot. Although these 2 cases may also be
present in SSH (e.g. different members of a gene family
may hybridize to one spot in SSH), it is likely that they are
more abundant in CSH.
Second, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) results
were obtained as another parameter for the resemblance
between CSH and SSH data. PCA was determined based
on test-sample:reference-sample ratios for each of the PT
or PP datasets. Two components (with cumulative variance of 73%; biological replicates matched to some
extent, as indicated by their distance in the PC space) were
detected by PCA for the PP transcriptomic data (Fig 1).
Only one component was found for the PT transcriptomic
data (not shown). This may suggest that despite the similarity in the quality of hybridization consistency (suggested by the similar reference-correlation coefficients),
CSH may not accurately reflect SSH PCA results.

In addition, Renn et al. [3] performed a phylogeneticbased evaluation of microarray representation of the
genomes, and similar expression patterns were observed
for organisms that diverged up-to 65 MYA and even to
some extent for organisms that diverged up to 200 MYA.
Based on non-synonymous and synonymous distances, it
has been suggested that potato and tomato diverged
about 17 MYA [30,31]. Taken together, the study of Renn
et al. [3] and the phylogenetic assessment of the potatotomato divergence support the above premise, i.e. that
potato-tomato CSH may be used for obtaining biologically meaningful results.

Third, the gene expression range was determined from the
lower 0.1 to the upper 99.9 percentiles for all 8 test-sample:reference-sample ratios, and PP compared with PT. A
clear reduction by a factor of 0.76 (on average, SD = 0.24,
N = 8) in the ratio was observed for PT compared to PP.
This is in agreement with other CSH studies. Renn et al.
[3] have found a clear reduction in CSH signal, which was
proportional to the phylogenetic distance of the 2 CSHinvolved species. Adjaye et al. [8] pointed to differences in
expression levels between SSH of human/human and
CSH of bovine/human. Reduction in the signal observed
for CSH, may be due to lack of specific RNA hybridization, resulting from reduced homology between potato
and tomato, or from cases where more than one potato
transcript hybridized to a single tomato clone.

Comparison of CSH and SSH transcriptomic (whole chip)
results
To determine the extent to which CSH may reflect SSH
transcriptomic results, we have performed various analyses for each of PT or PP whole chip expression data, and

Consequently, when gene expression profile was plotted
between 5 and 10 d, for the (infected-) test-sample:reference-sample, for both PP and PT (Fig 2), the PP data
exhibited amplification of gene expression from 5 to 10 d
(Fig 2a). Similar amplification of gene expression from 5

to 10 d of nematode infection was also suggested in our
previous study where tomato RNA was hybridized to a
tomato microarray (i.e. tomato SSH experiments; [32]).
For both the previous tomato and current potato SSH
data, this may reflect a biological process common to the
2 closely related species. However, examination of the corresponding CSH data of PT resulted in masking of this
biological process; no amplification of gene expression
was evident from 5 to 10 d of nematode infection (Fig
2b).
Lastly, we wanted to examine whether the observed
inconsistent reduction may be overcome once 2 hybridizations, which are a pair of a paired-observations, were
compared. A pair of a paired-observation in our system is
nematode-infected hybridization and the corresponding
non-infected hybridization (e.g. '5a+' and '5a-'). The fold
change for each pair was determined and averaged over
biological replicates (i.e. over '5a' and '5b' and over '10a'
and '10b'). This value served for identification of differen-

tially regulated (i.e. >2 fold or <0.5 fold) genes for each
time-point. For PP whole chip expression, data resulted in
591 and 790 differentially regulated genes at 5 and 10 d,
respectively; only 80 and 52 differentially regulated genes
were identified at 5 and 10 d in the PT whole chip data.
Notably, the relatively low numbers of PT-differentially
regulated genes compared to those of PP may have
occurred, despite taking a liberal cutoff (2 fold). Therefore, the inconsistent reduction in signal intensity may
not be overcome in our experiments by pair-wise fold
determination.
In conclusion, the reduction in the CSH hybridization
results (the ratio between sample and reference), along
with its inconsistency, compared to the SSH hybridization
result, may bias gene expression profiling of a biological
process. This was manifested in the inability to identify
PCA components, in aberrant gene expression profiling
on a transcriptomic scale and in a decrease in the number
of differentially regulated genes. Thus, our results suggest

that the overall CSH data does not support the use of a
whole chip (transcriptomic scale) analysis to provide a
SSH comparative data profiles.
Construction of tomato microarray – potato microarray
matched probe sets
Inconsistency between hybridization results obtained
from different platforms may be merely due to the fact
that different platforms were used [33], whereas consistency between different platforms could be increased once
a subset of data corresponding to cross-platform matched
probe sets are used [27]. Therefore, to facilitate cross-platform and, hence CSH-SSH comparison, we created
matched probe sets composed of probes from one platform (tomato microarray) that are homologous with
probes from the other platform (potato microarray).

Mecham et al. [27] suggested that for comparison of 2
platforms, the best sequences to compare are overlapping
probe-sequences that are spotted on the microarray (clone
sequences in our system). This may avoid the representation of, among others, splice variants or incorrect assembled unigenes ([27] and references therein). Due to the

unavailability of the complete clone sequences in our system, unigenes served as our choice for platform comparison (discussed in Microarray representation of species genes).
Note that since overlapping of sequences may be essential
once cross-platform comparison is considered [27], a possible drawback of using unigenes for this purpose is the
possibility that 2 clones, being different parts of a corresponding homologous pair, do not overlap. According to
[27], this might lead to inconsistency between the two
platforms data, which correspond to these homologous
pair probe sets. In summary, using unigenes for inter-platform comparison is inevitable despite the above described
drawbacks due to the lack of complete clone sequences.
To create a unigene-based matched tomato-potato microarray probe sets, sequences of 7,637 tomato SGN unigenes (represented by 9,140 tomato microarray printed
clones) served as queries to blast against 10,860 potato
TIGR unigenes (represented by 15,264 potato microarray
printed clones). BLAST resulted in 13,052 tomato SGN
unigene – potato TIGR unigene homologous (E value ≤ e1) pairs. This liberal match cut-off was used to gain a large
range of E-values to be examined at later stages. These uni-

gene homologous pairs were found to be representatives
of 17,325 clone homologous pairs (i.e. tomato clone –
potato clone pairs); each clone generated more than one
pair, therefore, the number of homologous pairs is greater
than that of the microarray spotted clones. The clone pairs
served as probes for a System Expression Matrix (SEM)
that was created by merging PP and PT probe corresponding data. SEM was utilized for further CSH and SSH analyses (see below).
SEM probe pair homology optimization to gain maximal
match of PP and PT data
A measure of reflection of the SSH data by the CSH data
may be having all the biological replicates at 5 and 10 d
(i.e. the infected:non-infected ratios of 5a, 5b, 10a and
10b) clustered for the PT and PP data. Therefore, according to this measure, SEM data was filtered according to
tomato microarray – potato microarray probe homology
(i.e. E-value or bit-score) to create subsets of SEM. Clustering results of these subsets were examined. E-value is a
function of bit score, but weighs parameters such as uni-

gene dataset size [34]; therefore, both E values and bit
scores were used as parameters for sequence homology.
Hierarchical clustering of biological replicates of the unfiltered SEM data (infected:non-infected ratios) for each of
the 17,325 homologous pairs resulted in no matches (Fig
3A). PCA of the same dataset resulted in an approximate
grouping of the PT and PP biological replicates in a 3 principal component space (Fig 4A; Additional file 2). However, filtering of SEM data (infected:non-infected ratio)
for higher bit scores improved the PT and the PP match
(i.e., more biological replicates clustered over PP and PT).
A perfect match between PT and PP (i.e. all biological replicates clustered over PP and PT) was observed for a subset
of SEM which contained 7,116 homologous pairs with
bit-scores higher than 129 (E-value ≤ e-26) (Fig 3B). PCA
of this subset of SEM demonstrated improved grouping of
the PT and PP biological replicates in a 3 principal component space (Fig 4B). Notably, the perfect match
obtained for PT and PP was based only on optimization
of the homology of sequences between the 2 examined
species. This establishes the affect of species rather than

any other affect such as that of dye, scanning, laboratory,
etc. on the derivation of SSH-like results from CSH.
Lastly, filtering out the data of pairs that contained a
tomato chimeric clone (i.e. clones that were found
homologous to 2 unigenes, according to the manufacturer
published data [35]; GEO [26] accession no.: GPL3034)
resulted with 13,285 homologous pairs. For these, lower
bit-score (105 compared to 129) and higher E-value (e-23
compared to e-26) thresholds lead to a perfect match
between PP and PT. This "lowering of threshold" for a perfect match between CSH and SSH, once chimeric clones
were filtered out, further strengthens the previous notion
that the association between a clone (printed on the
microarray chip) and its representative unigene may affect
the interpretation of a CSH experiment results.

Determination of the ability to detect differentially
regulated genes with CSH
Following probe-homology optimization of SEM data, we
determined the extent to which may the SEM subset data
that corresponded to bit-scores >129 (or E-values <e-26),
support identification of differentially (>2 fold or <0.5
fold) regulated genes, identified in both the CSH and the
SSH data. For this purpose, differentially regulated genes
were identified based on the infected:non-infected ratio,
averaged over 2 biological replicates, for each time-point
and for each tendency of regulation (Additional file 3).
Mutual differentially regulated genes (Additional file 4)
comprised 43% or 16% (average values, N = 4, calculated
based on the values in Fig 5) of the PT or the PP total
number of differentially regulated genes. Thus, despite the
generation of the SEM data and its probe homology optimization, a relatively small proportion of differentially
regulated genes in our system was found mutual between
the CSH and SSH results.

Intersection of differentially regulated gene lists identified by cross-species and species-specific hybridizations.
Intersections performed between differentially regulated gene lists, identified by cross-species (PT) or species-specific (PP)
hybridizations. Differentially regulated genes were identified between nematode infected and non-infected potato plants (based
on infected:non-infected ratios). Intersections were performed for each time-point of the experiment (i.e. 5 or 10 d) and for
each tendency of regulation (i.e. up or down). The PP and PT data corresponded to the sub SEM data filtered to include
potato-tomato matched probe pairs with homology of bit-scores ≤ 129 (or E-values ≥ e-26). The intersection area presents
the number of potato-tomato clone pairs that were differentially regulated for both PT and PP data. The first letter indicates

Of the PT data, 57% were false positives (i.e. differentially
regulated genes identified for PT and not for PP data);
whereas 84% were false negatives (i.e. differentially regulated genes identified for PP and not for PT data). A large
number of false negatives may result from a reduction in
the number of differentially regulated genes in CSH, compared to SSH. This was also indicated by other CSH studies (e.g. [3]). However, these differences between CSH and
SSH observed in our system may have also resulted from

other technical effect (such as differences in scanning protocols, dye labeling orientation, laboratories, etc.).

Conclusions
In the present study, we have directly compared results
generated by CSH with those generated by SSH to determine the quality of the CSH results and the steps that
should be taken in order to extract valid results from CSH.
The results show difficulties in inferring transcriptome
data from CSH with that obtained from SSH. However,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/110

once the information has been filtered for those data corresponding to matching probe sets by restricting proper
cut-offs of probe homology, the CSH data reflected more
closely that of the SSH to an extent that was quantified by
identification of differentially regulated genes.

systems. Finally, cross-species matched probe sets may be
generated only for organisms with sufficient genomic
data. As for other organisms, methods for extraction of
biologically relevant knowledge from CSH need to be
developed.

Notably, all of the results that were generated in our PPPT system may be specific to these particular platforms
and to this particular experiment. A deduction from this
system to other systems may not be straightforward. It is
required that additional experiments will compare CSH to
SSH using the same RNA samples (as in our system) in
order to deduce general conclusions regarding derivation
of SSH-like results from CSH data. Nevertheless, we suggest that this study may provide the reader with an
approach to CSH. This may include guidelines for evaluating a CSH system, analyzing CSH data and assessing the
quality of CSH results.

4. The generation of the cross-platform matched probe
sets was based on unigene sequences. Since several factors
such as genomic database information of the studied species may affect the degree of clone representation by unigenes, an ideal candidate for sequence comparison may
be the spotted-clone sequences [27]. These should be fully
sequenced to facilitate extraction of biologically relevant
knowledge out of CSH.

1. Although evaluation of the phylogenetic distance
between the 2 CSH organisms (the one of the microarray
and the one in study) may indicate on the CSH ability to
reflect a biological process [3], once genomic data are
available for the organism in study, we suggest that an
evaluation of the cross-species microarray representation
level of the studied organism may be performed by
sequences comparison. An exact "formula" that would
give a clear assessment for the level of microarray representation still needs to be developed to enable assessment
of a CSH candidate platform.
2. Our data indicated that CSH whole chip results may not
reflect SSH transcriptomic scale gene expression profiles.
Thus, we suggest that the CSH transcriptomic data may
not be trusted to reflect biological processes.
3. To facilitate extraction of SSH-like knowledge out of
CSH, we have generated cross-platform (and hence crossspecies) matched probe sets. We suggest that the creation
of corresponding probe sets be performed for each and
any CSH system, for which genomic data is available.
Once considering the level of homology for cross-species
comparison, the bit-scores (or E-values) should be optimized to the studied system. This may be easily performed
in cases, where a species-specific platform exists, by maintaining a few RNA samples of the CSH experiment and
hybridize them with the species-specific platform. This
SSH supplemental experiment will allow a threshold
determination for the specific CSH experiment. As for the
rest of CSH systems, where a matched species-specific
platform is not available, we suggest that the estimates
presented here as a reference to start with, although these
may be too strict; this particular experiment includes dissimilarities between CSH and SSH that may have been
due to technical differences between the CSH and SSH

Methods
Tomato and potato microarray description
Two cDNA microarrays, a tomato microarry and a potato
microarray were used. The tomato cDNA microarray was
developed and printed by the Center of Gene Expression
Profiling (CGEP; Cornell University, Ithaca, NY); it contains 9,140 sequenced clones, selected at random from a
number of different cDNA libraries derived from a range
of tissues including leaf, root, fruit and flower [35]. The
potato cDNA microarray version 3 was developed and
printed by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR,
Rockville, MD). The potato microarray contains 15,264
cDNA clones, selected from the potato stolon, root,
microtuber, dormant tuber, germinating eye, healthy leaf,
and phytophthora infestans-challenged libraries [36]. A
description of the tomato and the potato microarrays is
also available at GEO [26]; accession no. GPL3034 and
GPL1902, respectively).
Determination of potato gene representation level by the
tomato and the potato microarrays
To determine the representation level of potato genes in
the tomato microarray, its unigene sequences served as
queries for a local BLAST search against a potato unigene
database. IDs of the tomato microarray represented unigene were retrieved from the manufacturer [35].
Sequences of these unigenes were retrieved from the
Solanaceae Genomics Network (SGN; [37]). Sequences of
potato unigenes were retrieved from TIGR potato TC database (release 10.0). For the creation of a potato database
index file, we used the NCBI FORMATDB utility. NCBI
local BLASTN matched homologous (E-value ≤ e-05)
tomato microarray – potato unigenes, according to their
sequences. The total number of the tomato microarray
represented potato TCs was divided by the total number
of potato TCs.

As a reference to species-specific genes representation, we
evaluated the potato genes representation level by the
potato microarray. This was done by dividing the number

Page 9 of 13

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:110

of the potato microarray represented potato TCs by the
total number of potato TCs.
RNA source
RNA was extracted from nematode-infected and noninfected (control) potato plants. Two time-points of nematode infection were examined, 5 and 10 d. For each time
point, two paired observations were applied. All paired
observations were taken at the same greenhouse, but at
different times. Each paired observation consisted of 2
groups of 6 plants, grown on adjacent plates. Six plants
were nematode-inoculated and the other 6 were mockinoculated. A detailed description of plant growth, inoculation and dissection follows. These were applied independently for each paired observation. In order to get
potato seedlings, 12 Solanum tubersum cv. Desiree explants
(stem including an axillary bud) were sectioned under
sterile conditions from in vitro growing seedlings and
transferred to Magenta boxes containing Gamborg's
media. Four weeks post transferring to Gamborg's media,
these seedlings were planted, each in a pot containing
autoclaved quartz sand and grown under 16 h light per
diem at 60% humidity. During seedling growing to
plants, eggs of Meloidogyne javanica root-knot nematode
were extracted from greenhouse cultures, and secondstage juveniles were hatched [38]. Three weeks post transferring the seedlings to pots, 6 plants were inoculated each
with 5000 M. javanica juveniles, where 6 plants were
mock-inoculated with tap, sterile water. Roots from 6
infected and 6 non-infected plants were collected 5 or 10
days post nematode inoculation. Roots were observed
under the microscope, and nematode feeding sites were
selectively dissected from young lateral roots. To control
the effect of tissue sectioning on gene expression, young
lateral roots of the non-infected plants were dissected similarly to the infected roots, and collected. Dissected roots
were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and immediately
stored in a -80°C freezer. Consequently, biological material of 8 sources (of 2 time-points × 2 replicates × 2 treatments) was subject to RNA extraction.
RNA samples
Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) from infected and non-infected roots to
yield 8 test RNA samples. In addition, equal amounts of
20 ug were pooled from all test RNA samples to form a reference sample, in which every test sample was equally represented [39]. The test and reference RNA samples were
subjected to amplification with the MessageAmp aRNA kit
(Ambion, Austin, TX), using 2.5 to 5 μg of total RNA as
starting material. These resulted in 9 samples, a reference
sample and 8 test samples designated: '5a-', '5a+', '10a-',
'10a+', '5b-', '5b+', '10b-', '10b+' for non-infected (-) or
infected (+), 5 or 10 d and first (a) or second (b) biological replicate.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/110

Microarray experiment design
Each test RNA sample was co-hybridized with the reference RNA sample to both a potato microarray and a
tomato microarray, according to a microarray experiment
reference design [39]. This meta-design enabled us to
compare CSH to SSH in 'paired observations' statistical
design; with 8 independent observations (i.e. 8 RNA samples that were "treated" with both CSH and SSH). All heterologous hybridizations to the tomato microarray (i.e.,
the PT microarray experiment) were performed in HK lab.
All homologous hybridizations of the potato RNA to the
potato microarray (i.e. the PP microarray experiment)
were performed in TIGR labs.
RNA labeling, microarray hybridizations and data
acquisition
For the PT experiment, RNA was labeled so that all the test
samples were dyed with Cy5 and the reference sample was
dyed with Cy3. A detailed description of the methods
used for RNA labeling, microarray hybridization and data
acquisition, as in [32].

For the PP experiment, RNA was labeled such that all the
test samples were dyed with Cy3 and the reference sample
was dyed with Cy5. A detailed description of the methods
used for RNA labeling, microarray hybridization and data
acquisition can be found in [40].
Results of both experiments are available at GEO [26];
accession no. GSE3584.
Data normalization
Similar data normalization was performed for both PT
and PP data. The output files of the PT and PP experiments
were normalized according to GeneSpring (GeneSpring
5.1; Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). First, all PP
hybridization results were inverted to gain a test-sample:reference-sample ratios, similar to those of the PT
experiment. Then, for each microarray experiment (PP or
PT), Lowess normalization [41] was applied. Of the data
35% served for smoothing. In addition, control channel
values <40 were set to 40. Lastly, the data was filtered to
include only present and marginal calls. The normalization process resulted in 2 expression matrices, one of the
PP and the other of the PT experiment.
Whole chip (transcriptomic) data analysis
Whole chip data analysis was performed separately for PP
and for PT in a similar manner. For each experiment the
following analysis procedures were performed. To determine the reproducibility of hybridization quality, the reference sample data were exported from GeneSpring to a
text file. Excel (Microsoft) was used to determine correlation coefficients between pairs of reference sample data of
eight hybridizations. This resulted in 28 comparisons,

Page 10 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:110

whose correlation coefficients – their averages and the
standard-deviation values – were calculated. Next, GeneSpring was used to perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA; [42]) on 8 test-sample:reference-sample
hybridization data.
For signal reproducibility between the experiments, the
span from the lower 0.1 to the upper 99.9 percentiles was
determined for each test-samples:reference-sample ratio.
These values were compared between PP and PT hybridization data, for each of the 8 RNA sample hybridizations
(e.g. between PT '5a+' and PP '5a+' data) by dividing the
PT value by that of PP. The average and standard deviation
was calculated for these 8 resulted ratios. Next, the
(infected-) test-sample:reference-sample ratios were averaged over biological replicates and plotted as transcriptional profiles between 5 d and 10 d. Lastly, differentially
regulated genes, with expression ratio of >2 fold or <0.5
fold between infected and non-infected samples (i.e.
between the average of '5+' data and that of '5-' data, and
between the average of '10+' data and that of '10-' data)
were identified by using GeneSpring.
Construction of tomato-potato microarray matched probe
sets
In order to generate tomato-microarray – potato-microarray clone match probe sets, unigene match probe sets were
initially generated. For this purpose, the tomato microarray unigene sequences served as queries for a local BLAST
search against the potato microarray unigene sequences.
Unigene sequences of the tomato and the potato microarrays were retrieved from the manufacturers (CGEP and
TIGR, respectively). A database index file was created for
the potato microarray unigenes by using the NCBI FORMATDB utility. The tomato microarray unigene sequences
served as queries for NCBI local BLASTN against the
potato microarray unigene database. The search was limited to E-values <e-01. The BLASTN search gave a list of
homologous unigene pairs along with their match information, including E-values and bit-scores.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/110

matrices (exported from GeneSpring) into one system
expression matrix (SEM) using a Matlab (The Mathworks,
Natick, MA) script. The merge included for each pair of
matched clones the hybridizations data, pair-wise match
information (including E-values and bit-scores), and a
flag that indicated the number of unigenes associated with
a tomato clone (i.e. 1 or 2 for non-chimeric or chimeric
clones).
Analysis of the System Expression Matrix (SEM)
The system expression matrix was uploaded to GeneSpring such that, for each biological replicate, the
infected:non-infected data was applied. Additional normalization was done by setting all values below 0.01 to
0.01 and by dividing all values by the median of the corresponding biological replicate values at each time-point
examined (e.g. all '5a' infected:non-infected values were
divided by their median). The following are analytical
steps applied for SEM data. First, Centered Pearson correlation was used for hierarchical clustering of biological
replicates for the whole SEM data and for SEM subset data.
The latter corresponded to a range of bit-scores (or E-values), in order to find the bit-score (or E-value) threshold
for a perfect match between PP and PT (i.e. all biological
replicates are clustered over PP and PT). Then, PCA was
performed for both SEM whole data, and for sub SEM data
that corresponded to the bit-score (or E-value) threshold
(disclosed before). Lists of genes, that were differentially
regulated (i.e. had >2 fold or <0.5 fold change in expression) between nematode-infected and non-infected
plants were extracted for each time-point by filtering on
fold change on the averaged biological replicate (i.e. the
average of '5a' and '5b', and the average '10a' and '10b').
Corresponding differentially regulated gene lists were
intersected (e.g. PP 5 d upregulated gene list was intersected with PT 5d upregulated gene list).

For each potato-tomato pair of unigenes the associated
potato and tomato microarray clones were reconstructed
to generate clone matched probe sets. For each potatotomato unigene pair, each of the tomato unigene associated clones was paired with each of the potato unigene
associated clones. This resulted in a list of clone pairs,
which formed potato-microarray – tomato-microarray
clone matched probe sets. These clone match probe sets
were denoted as the unigene-based matched probe sets,
and served for the construction of SEM (see below).
