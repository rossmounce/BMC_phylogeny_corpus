Abstract
Background: A large number of microsatellites have been extensively used to comprehend the
genetic diversity of different global groups. This paper entails polymorphism at 15 STR in four
predominant and endogamous populations representing Karnataka, located on the southwest coast
of India. The populations residing in this region are believed to have received gene flow from south
Indian populations and world migrants, hence, we carried out a detailed study on populations
inhabiting this region to understand their genetic structure, diversity related to geography and
linguistic affiliation and relatedness to other Indian and global migrant populations.
Results: Various statistical analyses were performed on the microsatellite data to accomplish the
objectives of the paper. The heretozygosity was moderately high and similar across the loci, with
low average GST value. Iyengar and Lyngayat were placed above the regression line in the R-matrix
analysis as opposed to the Gowda and Muslim. AMOVA indicated that majority of variation was
confined to individuals within a population, with geographic grouping demonstrating lesser genetic
differentiation as compared to linguistic clustering. DA distances show the genetic affinity among
the southern populations, with Iyengar, Lyngayat and Vanniyar displaying some affinity with
northern Brahmins and global migrant groups from East Asia and Europe.
Conclusion: The microsatellite study divulges a common ancestry for the four diverse populations
of Karnataka, with the overall genetic differentiation among them being largely confined to intrapopulation variation. The practice of consanguineous marriages might have attributed to the
relatively lower gene flow displayed by Gowda and Muslim as compared to Iyengar and Lyngayat.
The various statistical analyses strongly suggest that the studied populations could not be
differentiated on the basis of caste or spatial location, although, linguistic affinity was reflected
among the southern populations, distinguishing them from the northern groups. Our study also
indicates a heterogeneous origin for Lyngayat and Iyengar owing to their genetic proximity with
southern populations and northern Brahmins. The high-ranking communities, in particular, Iyengar,
Lyngayat, Vanniyar and northern Brahmins might have experienced genetic admixture from East
Asian and European ethnic groups.

Background
The Indian subcontinent is regarded as a natural genetic
laboratory, owing to the co-existence and interaction of
socio-culturally, linguistically, ethnically and genetically
diversified endogamous populations in a geographical
terrain. It is believed that the earliest humans leaving
Africa for Eurasia might have taken a coastal route across
Saudi Arabia, through Iraq, Iran, to Pakistan and finally
entered India along the coastlines [1]. A second wave of
migration (~10,000 years ago) brought in Proto-Dravidian Neolithic farmers from Afghanistan, who were later
displaced southwards by a large influx of Indo-European
speakers ~3500 years ago in to the subcontinent [2,3]. The
origin and settlement of the Indian people still remains
intriguing, fascinating scientists to explore the impact of
these past and modern migrations on the genetic diversity
and structure of contemporary populations [4-6].
Anthropologically, southern and northern populations
are distinct and these differences are further substantiated
by (i) the presence of Neolithic sites in this region suggests
that Neolithic people of southern India came from north
by land and the west-coast by sea [7], (ii) the southern
megaliths resemble closely with those of the Mediterranean and western-Europe, while those from northern
India are similar to megaliths found in Iran and Baluchisthan [8], and (iii) the predominance of Dravidian language in this region as opposed to their secluded
occurrence in central Asia and other parts of India, suggests that the Dravidian languages might have originated
within India [9]. It is, thus, of considerable genetic interest
to understand the genetic structuring and relationships of
southern populations.
The present study was carried out on one of the largest
southern states, Karnataka, positioned on the southwest
coast of India, with a dwelling of about 50 million people.
This expanse has been a rich source of prehistoric discoveries dating back to the Paleolithic era that are akin to
those seen in Europe [7]. Karnataka has received continuous gene flow from different caste and linguistic groups
residing in the adjoining areas of Maharashtra, Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu [10], resulting in the congregation of a large number of diverse endogamous groups
within this region. Its large coastline of about 400 Km also
attracted the Portugese, Dutch and French traders, who
were seeking more profitable ventures on the southern
coast at large [2]. Southwest India is, thus, one of the most
disparate terrains, with extensive colonization in the past
and justifies an in-depth genetic study.
A few studies utilizing classical markers have been carried
out on southern populations [5,11,12], including few
communities of Karnataka [13,14]. However, sound inferences relating to their genetic structuring and diversity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/5/23

could not be drawn due to low discriminatory power of
these markers. Recently, microsatellite markers have
gained immense popularity in precisely defining population structure, diversity, affinities, gene flow and other
crucial aspects associated with population genetics [1521] because of the relative expediency, with which a large
number of loci and alleles can be typed, facilitating the
accumulation of vast data sets that can be readily analyzed
with an extensive array of statistical tools [22,23]. These
markers also demonstrate high heterozygosity [24], rendering them highly suitable for carrying out the present
study.
Among the different caste and tribal groups inhabiting the
southwest coast of India, we have selected four predominant Dravidian-speaking communities from Karnataka:
Iyengar Brahmin, Lyngayat, Gowda and Muslim, they not
only belong to dissimilar groups of the Indian caste hierarchy but also have varied migration histories, conferring
them uniqueness and significance from a genetic perspective. The present microsatellite study primarily attempts to
understand the genetic structure of the four selected populations and to determine their genetic relationship with
other linguistically and ethnically similar groups of southern India and Brahmin groups of northern India. It has
been suggested that that despite the linguistic homogeneity in southern India, these populations have remained
genetically diversified [25]. Hence, we sought to determine the role played by geographical location and linguistic affiliation in genetically differentiating Indian
populations. Also, as mentioned earlier, the western coast
has witnessed colonization from different world populations, we aim to divulge the impact of these past migrations on the gene pool of the present southern
populations by discerning their relationship with historically acclaimed and established migrant groups, ethnically represented by European, Hispanic, East Asian and
African populations.

Results
Allele frequency at 15 STR was used to compute the heterozygosity (observed) for the four studied populations,
which varied for each locus, and population but reflected
similar values, ranging between 0.724 and 0.797 (Table
1). An average GST value of 0.009 elucidates the low degree
of genetic differentiation in them. However, the GST value
for the pooled Indian and global populations demonstrated a high value at 2.3% (data not shown). Genetic
relationship of studied populations with other similar
southern groups; Vanniyar, Gounder, Pallar and Tanjore
Kallar [26,27], northern Brahmins belonging to Orissa
[28] and Bihar [29], and four relevant global ethnic
groups: European, Hispanic, African [30] and East Asian
[31] was divulged by computing DA distances (Table 2)
and represented using NJ tree (Fig. 1). Among the four

studied populations, Iyengar, Gowda and Muslim formed
a distinct cluster. Although NJ tree clearly depicts the clustering of southern populations, DA distances indicate that
among these groups, Iyengar, Lyngayat and Vanniyar are
more similar to the northern Brahmins (0.030). Furthermore, genetic distances emphasize the affinity of Lyngayat
with Tanjore Kallar (0.029), Iyengar (0.026) and Vanniyar
(0.028). Estimation of relatedness between the southern
and global populations shows that all the southern communities formed a separate cluster, nevertheless, genetic
distances disclose the affinity of upper caste Indian com-

munities; Iyengar, Lyngayat, Vanniyar, Bihar and Oriya
Brahmin with Europeans and East Asians. The Indian
populations were most distant to Africans.
The regression model (Fig. 2), of mean per locus heterozygosity against distance from centroid assumes that when a
population experiences same amount of gene flow from a
homogenous source, a linear relationship exists between
the expected and observed heterozygosity. A change in
gene flow directly affects this linear relationship. The Rmatrix when applied to the Indian populations assists in

understanding the influence of external gene flow and
admixture among populations. The higher observed than
expected heterozygosity of Iyengar and Lyngayat, placed
above the theoretical regression line helps infer that these
populations have received more than average external
gene flow, which was also observed in Vanniyar, Pallar
and Oriya Brahmin. The Gowda and Muslim groups
exhibit lower than expected heterozygosity values and fall
below the regression line, suggesting lesser admixture in
them.
The microsatellite diversity computed using AMOVA
revealed that the genetic variation observed in Indian
populations was mainly confined to variation amongst
individuals (~98%), irrespective of their geographic or
linguistic grouping (Table 3). The geographical clustering
of populations into three regions: north, southwest (Karnataka) and southeast (Tamil Nadu) demonstrated a low
variance of 0.29%, p = 0.010 (Table 3a). As compared to
geographical grouping, the linguistic clustering (IndoCaucasian and Dravidian) exhibited a noticeable increase
in the molecular variance between the two groups, 0.65%
(p = 0.06, Table 3b). The genetic diversity among populations within each group remained almost similar at both
levels of analysis.

Discussion
In recent years, population genetics has witnessed extensive use of microsatellite markers to understand and evolutionary histories of contemporary human populations
[17,32-34]. Though, the populations inhabiting south

India have played a major role in formation of the Indian
gene pool, however, very few genetic studies have been
carried out on them. The present study utilizes 15 STRs to
provide comprehensive genetic information on four predominant communities inhabiting the southwest coast of
India, which may significantly help in understanding the
genetic composition of southern populations.
Genetic structure of Karnataka populations
The most distinctive feature revealed by the fifteen microsatellites was the considerable genetic homogeneity
amongst the four diverse caste groups residing in southwest India. The presence of an almost similar allele frequency pattern [34], suggests that these populations
might have a common ancestry or probably experienced
very high gene flow during the period of their coexistence.
The above finding is further supported by the low genetic
differentiation of 1.0% among the studied groups irrespective of their caste and migration histories. The high
heterozygosity and rii values in Lyngayat reflect the
admixture and stochastic processes experienced by it. The
genetic affinity of Lyngayat with other related southern
caste populations, like, Iyengar, Vanniyar and Tanjore
Kallar reiterates its heterogeneous past. It is noteworthy
that although the southern populations exhibited higher
affinity amongst each other, the high-ranking populations, like, Iyengar, Lyngayat and Vanniyar also displayed

some genetic similarity to Brahmins from Bihar and
Orissa, indicating that the gene pool of Iyengar and Lyngayat probably consists of genetic inputs from both southern and northern groups. However, strong conclusions
cannot be drawn due to low genetic differentiation among
the studied populations. Though the Gowda is known to
have moved in to Karnataka from the adjoining area of
Tamil Nadu, our study reveals that Gowda cluster with the
studied populations and not with Tamil groups. The low
hetetozygosity and high rii values of Gowda implies that
it might have differentiated as a result of stochastic processes. Furthermore, the relatively lower heterozygosity
and admixture levels of Gowda and Muslim might be
attributed to the socio-cultural practice of consanguineous marriages in them. The Muslim group was found to be
genetically similar to local populations. Regional conversions from diverse castes that occurred during the period
of Islamic dominance might elucidate the more or less
identical genetic relationship between Muslims and other
studied groups. The microsatellite study emphasizes the
genetic similarity among the Karnataka populations, with
the lack of any strong caste or religious bias in them.
Analysis of genetic variance
AMOVA test strongly suggests that genetic diversity
among the southern populations was mainly confined to
intra-population variation, further emphasizing the
genetic homogeneity in them. Analysis using different
genetic markers corroborate with our finding that the
genetic diversity in human populations can be mainly
attributed
to
variation
within
populations
[4,17,19,34,36,37].

An exploration of the genetic differentiation based on
geographical grouping of populations discloses the
genetic similarity among populations residing in a region.
Nevertheless, the geographic affinity was comparably
lesser to that observed within the two linguistic families,

viz., Dravidian and Indo-European. Our finding provides
evidence to the strong linguistic affinity prevailing
amongst the Dravidian speaking populations and imparts
them genetic distinctness from the Indo-European linguistic group. Even though prior studies have indicated
that genetic clusters often correspond closely to
predefined regional and linguistic groups [34], AMOVA
suggests that caste system along with geographical contiguity are not ideal platforms for differentiating the analyzed Indian populations. It must, however, be
acknowledged that use of less number of polymorphisms
in this study might plausibly have led to the greater influence of linguistic affiliation on these populations rather
than geographical proximity.
Genetic affinity with global populations
The genetic differentiation of the studied populations
with relevant global migrant groups was estimated to be
2.3%, relatively lower than the 9% observed in another
similar study [16], which had used a different set of microsatellite markers. Sampling from a confined area, as
well as the use of lesser number of loci might have contributed to this apparent difference in the results. The
southern populations formed a separate cluster from the
world populations. Molecular studies on Indian
populations using diverse markers (nuclear, mtDNA and
Y-chromosome) have demonstrated that the upper caste
populations have higher semblance with Europeans than
Asians [26]. Intriguingly, in the present study, communities belonging to the upper strata of the Hindu caste hierarchy, i.e., Iyengar, Lyngayat, Vanniyar and northern
Brahmins, displayed almost identical genetic affinity with
both Europeans and East Asians. Therefore, all though it
is believed that south India remained isolated and cushioned from the foreign invasions, the southern populations, especially, the high-ranking groups might have
genetically admixed with migrant groups that entered via
the west coast and north. Further exploration of their rela-

across the loci are substantially unlinked, making them
suitable for analyzing inter and intra-population genetic
diversity.

Methods

STR Typing
The blood samples were collected from unrelated individuals belonging to â Iyengar (65), Lyngayat (98), Gowda
(59) and Muslim (45) communities, residing in different
districts of Karnataka. DNA was extracted from blood by
the phenol-chloroform method [40], followed by quantitation using the QuantiBlotâ¢ kit (Perkin-Elmer, Foster
City, CA, USA). Two nanogram of the isolated DNA was
used as template for the PCR amplification of the 15 STRs
using the PowerPlexâ¢16 kit (Promega Corp., Wisconsin
Madison, USA). Raw data were collected with the GeneScanâ¢ software, Ver. 3.2.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) and typed using the PowerTyperâ¢ 16 Macro
(Promega Corp., Wisconsin Madison, USA).

The populations
The populations selected in this study comprise of three
major Hindu castes-Iyengar, Lyngayat, Gowda and a Muslim community, inhabiting the southwest coastal terrain
of Karnataka (11.3 â 18.45Â°N latitudes and 74.12 â
78.40Â°E longitudes). All the populations belong to the
Dravidian linguistic family and are speakers of the local
dialect, Kannada, but differ in caste hierarchy and socioreligious practices. Consanguineous marriages have been
reported in Karnataka, with inbreeding levels of the order
0.020 to 0.033, in general [38].

Iyengar hold a high position in the Indian caste hierarchy
and sporadic accounts on Brahmin, suggests that they primarily migrated from the upper Gangetic plains to southern India. Nonetheless, few bioanthropological studies
have revealed that morphologically Brahmins of a geographical region are similar to the local groups.
Lyngayat community was initially formed, as a religious
cult by the amalgamation of people from different castes
and geographical regions but later developed into a distinct community practicing strict marriage endogamy
with social sub-divisions such as clans, sub-castes and
sects [10].
Gowda is a low ranking agriculturist caste group that typically exhibits the Dravidian socio-cultural characteristic
of consanguineous marriage. It is believed to have moved
in from the adjoining area of Tamil Nadu.
Muslim is a linguistically heterogeneous, complex religioethnic group, [10]. It is believed that the invasion of
Turks, Afghans (A.D 998â1030) and Moghals during the
15th century, introduced new genes only in northern
India, suggesting that Muslims from Southern India are
mainly local converts [3].
Micosatellite loci studied
The 15 STR marker set analyzed in this study consists of
thirteen tetra nucleotide repeat loci: D3S1358, THO1,
D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, D7S820, D16S539,
CSF1PO, vWA, D8S179, TPOX, FGA and two penta nucleotide repeat loci: Penta D, Penta E. Their repeat size makes
them less prone to slippage of polymerase during enzymatic amplification compared to the dinucleotide repeats,
allowing unambiguous typing [20]. The 15 selected loci
are situated on 13 different chromosomes, with D5S818
and CSF1PO being present on chromosome 5 and Penta
D and D21S11, located on chromosome 21. The alleles

Statistical Analysis
Allele frequencies of the 15 STR loci were calculated using
the gene counting method [40]. The genetic diversity
(GST), observed heterozygosity and pairwise genetic distances (DA) were computed using allele frequencies [42].
The DA distance is least affected by sample size and can
precisely obtain correct phylogenetic trees under various
evolutionary conditions [43]. Neighbor-joining trees were
constructed using DA distances [44], and its robustness
was established by bootstrap resampling procedures.

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed
using the Arlequin Ver. 2.00 package [45]. Two levels of
analysis were performed to explore the microsatellite
diversity among the four studied populations along with
six other socio-culturally similar groups inhabiting different regions of India. At the first level, three geographical
groups were constructed: (1) north (2) southwest: Karnataka and, (3) southeast: Tamil Nadu, to estimate the
genetic variance among populations from diverse geographical regions. The second set of analysis was aimed at
investigating the genetic diversity between the Dravidian
and Indo-European linguistic family.
To assess the gene flow experienced by these populations,
the rii value, i.e., the genetic distance of a population from
the centroid was calculated using the regression model
[46]. This model utilizes the heterozygosity of each population and the distance from the centroid as the arithmetic
mean of allele frequencies:

rii = pi â P
