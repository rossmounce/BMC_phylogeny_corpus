Abstract
Background: The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis is an obligate anaerobe that requires heme for
growth. To understand its heme acquisition mechanism, we focused on a hemin-binding protein (HBP35 protein),
possessing one thioredoxin-like motif and a conserved C-terminal domain, which are proposed to be involved in redox
regulation and cell surface attachment, respectively.
Results: We observed that the hbp35 gene was transcribed as a 1.1-kb mRNA with subsequent translation resulting in
three proteins with molecular masses of 40, 29 and 27 kDa in the cytoplasm, and one modified form of the 40-kDa
protein on the cell surface. A recombinant 40-kDa HBP35 exhibited thioredoxin activity in vitro and mutation of the two
putative active site cysteine residues abolished this activity. Both recombinant 40- and 27-kDa proteins had the ability
to bind hemin, and growth of an hbp35 deletion mutant was substantially retarded under hemin-depleted conditions
compared with growth of the wild type under the same conditions.
Conclusion: P. gingivalis HBP35 exhibits thioredoxin and hemin-binding activities and is essential for growth in hemindepleted conditions suggesting that the protein plays a significant role in hemin acquisition.
Background
Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a major
pathogen associated with chronic periodontitis. The
establishment of P. gingivalis at a periodontal site and
progression of disease is dependent on the ability of the
bacterium to utilize essential nutrients, of which iron
(preferably in the form of heme) plays a crucial role. P.
gingivalis lacks the majority of enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for the porphyrin ring, hence it is unable
to synthesize protoporphyrin IX, the precursor of heme
[1-3]; and unlike other Gram-negative bacteria, P. gingivalis does not produce siderophores [3]. Although several
studies have shown that P. gingivalis acquires heme from
the host environment using gingipains, lipoproteins and

specific outer-membrane receptors [3-5], the precise
mechanisms by which P. gingivalis acquires heme are still
unknown.
The gene encoding the P. gingivalis outer membrane
40-kDa protein (OMP40) was first cloned by Abiko et al.
[6]. As the recombinant OMP40 protein was demonstrated to exhibit hemin binding ability, and the molecular mass of the mature polypeptide determined by mass
spectrometric analysis was 35.3 kDa, the protein was designated as HBP35 [7]. However, characterization of the
hbp35 gene at the transcriptional and translational levels
in P. gingivalis and contribution of HBP35 protein to
hemin utilization have not been elucidated.
HBP35 protein has unique characteristics including the
presence of one thioredoxin-like motif and a conserved
C-terminal domain. Recently, it has been reported that
the C-terminal domain of a group of P. gingivalis outer
membrane proteins plays a crucial role in the coordinated

process of exportation and attachment of those proteins
onto the cell surface [8] and that some of the C-terminal
domain containing proteins, including RgpB, are glycosylated [9,10]. The last five residues of the C-terminal
domain are well conserved not only in P. gingivalis but
also in other oral pathogens, and that the last two C-terminal residues (VK) of RgpB have been shown to be
essential for correct transport and posttranslational modification [11]. However, the transportation and posttranslational modification mechanisms of C-terminal domain
containing proteins other than RgpB remain poorly
understood.
In this study, we presented the first evidence that the
hbp35 gene produces three translational products in P.
gingivalis. One was a 40-kDa protein that was transported to the outer membrane and glycosylated on the
cell surface, resulting in diffuse proteins with molecular
masses of 50-90 kDa. The others were smaller truncated
29- and 27-kDa proteins. We constructed HBP35-deficient mutants to elucidate the role of the gene products in
this microorganism and found that the HBP35 protein
(40-kDa) exhibited thioredoxin activity and bound hemin
and that its C-terminal domain was involved in its transport to the outer membrane. The protein was also essential for growth of the bacterium in a hemin-depleted
environment.

Results
Immunoblot analysis of P. gingivalis hbp35 mutants with
anti-HBP35 antibody

To gain insights into the biological significance of HBP35
in P. gingivalis, HBP35-deficient mutants, which had full
length deletion of, or insertion in, the hbp35 gene, were
constructed from the wild-type strain 33277. Immunoblot analysis with an anti-HBP35 antibody revealed that
whole cell extracts of P. gingivalis 33277 showed three
protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 40, 29,
and 27 kDa and diffuse bands of 50-90 kDa (Figure 1). No
protein bands other than those of 70 and 65 kDa indicated by asterisks, which might be non-specific, were
detected in the hbp35 full length deletion mutant
(KDP166), whereas the hbp35 insertion mutant
(KDP164), which had an insertion of the ermF-ermAM
DNA cassette just upstream of the F110 residue within the
HBP35 protein, showed 29-and 27-kDa proteins (Figure
1). We checked independent 18 isolates of KDP164 and 5
isolates of KDP166. All of the isolates showed the same
results as shown in Figure 1. The 40-kDa protein
appeared as the full length gene product of hbp35, which
coincided with results of previous studies [6,7].

plates. No difference was observed in Rgp, Kgp and
hemagglutinating activities between the hbp35 mutants
and the wild type (data not shown). These results suggest
that HBP35 does not influence expression of gingipainencoding genes.
Northern blot analysis of hbp35

To determine whether the hbp35 gene produces multiple
transcripts, total RNAs were prepared from the wild type
and hbp35 mutants. Northern blot analysis was then carried out with an hbp35 DNA probe that hybridized to the
hbp35 region coding for Q22-P344. The wild type showed a
1.1-kb transcript hybridizing to the hbp35 probe (Additional file 1). In the hbp35 insertion and full length deletion mutants, there was no 1.1-kb transcript, indicating
that the 1.1-kb mRNA was produced from the hbp35
gene. The hbp35 insertion mutant produced transcripts
with 1.3-2.2 kb that hybridized to the probe. The ermF
probe hybridized to transcripts with similar length in the
hbp35 insertion mutant (Additional file 1).
Subcellular localization of HBP35 protein

In an approach to understand the potential roles of
HBP35 proteins with different molecular masses, we
fractionated cells of the wild type and the hbp35 insertion mutant into cytoplasm/periplasm, total membrane,
and inner and outer membrane fractions. These fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot

analysis with the anti-HBP35 antibody. The diffuse
bands of 50-90 kDa proteins were mainly detected in the
outer membrane fraction, whereas the 40-kDa protein
was detected in every fraction of the wild type but
mainly in the inner membrane fraction. The 29-and 27kDa proteins were mainly detected in the cytoplasm/
periplasm fraction of the wild type and hbp35 insertion
mutant (Figure 2).

A

Peptide Mass Fingerprint analysis of the 27-kDa protein

To determine whether the 27-kDa protein is a truncated
form of the HBP35 protein, an immunoprecipitation
experiment using the hbp35 insertion mutant (KDP164)
cell lysate was carried out with the anti-HBP35 antibody.
The resulting immunoprecipitate contained a 27-kDa
protein band (Additional file 2), which was digested with
trypsin followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric
analysis. The 27-kDa protein was found to be derived
from a 3'-portion of hbp35, with PMF sequence coverage
of 37% of full length protein (Figure 3A). The maximum
mass error among the identified 10 tryptic peptides was
14 ppm. Since the detected tryptic peptide located at the
most N-terminal region of HBP35 starts from G137 and
since the insertion site of the ermF-ermAM DNA cassette
in the insertion mutant is just upstream of F110, it is feasible that the 27-kDa protein uses M115 or M135 as the alternative translation initiation site.
Identification of the N-terminal amino acid residue of
truncated HBP35 proteins

3B, the 27-kDa protein was not observed in the hbp35

finding that no HBP35 translational product was detected
in the hbp35 [M115A and M135A] insertion mutant
(KDP170). Moreover, recombinant HBP35 proteins with
a C-terminal histidine-tag were produced in an E. coli

Hemin binding site of rHBP35 proteins

1.0

Shibata et al. [7] found that a purified rHBP35 protein
(Q22-P344) could bind hemin and that HBP35 was suggested to possess a putative heme binding sequence
(Y50CPGGK55). To determine the hemin binding region
of HBP35, we constructed and purified rHBP35 (Q22P344), rHBP35 (Q22-P344 with C48S and C51S) and truncated rHBP35 (M135-P344) proteins with N-terminal histidine-tags using a histidine-tag purification system and
carried out hemin binding assays using a hemoprotein
peroxidase assay. As shown in Figure 4B, all of the
rHBP35 (Q22-P344), rHBP35 (Q22-P344 with C48S and C51S)
and truncated rHBP35 (M135-P344) proteins were found to
have hemin binding ability, implying that the hemin binding site is located in M135-P344 of HBP35 protein.
Effect of hemin depletion on growth of the hbp35 mutant

Since HBP35 protein is a hemin-binding protein, we
determined the contribution of HBP35 proteins to acquisition or intracellular storage of heme. The hbp35 insertion mutant, the full length deletion mutant, the
complemented strain which was constructed by replacing
the intact hbp35 gene into the hbp35 full length deletion
mutant, and the wild-type strain were hemin-starved
after being grown in enriched BHI broth containing
hemin (Figure 5). Hemin starvation resulted in retardation of the growth of the hbp35 mutants compared to that
of the wild type, whereas the complemented strain partially recovered the growth retardation of the hbp35 deletion mutant under the hemin-depleted condition. Even
under the hemin replete condition, the hbp35 mutants
grew more slowly than the wild type, suggesting that

HBP35 plays a role in hemin utilization in a sufficient
hemin concentration (5 μg/ml).
Thioredoxin activity of rHBP35 proteins

Shiroza et al. [12] have shown that an hbp35 gene-containing plasmid complemented the defects in motility
and alkaline phosphatase activity of an E. coli dsbA
mutant. This finding indicates that HBP35 is exported to
the periplasm in a dsbA mutant and plays a role in the
disulfide bond formation [13]. The HBP35 protein has a
thioredoxin motif in the N-terminal region. We performed an insulin reduction assay to determine whether
HBP35 has thioredoxin activity. Reduction of disulfide
bonds of insulin by thioredoxin activity generates free A
and B chains of insulin, and the resulting B chain is precipitated, which can be measured by the increase in turbidity [14]. The reducing activity of rHBP35 (Q22-P344)
was higher than that of E. coli thioredoxin, whereas no
activity was detected in rHBP35 (Q22-P344 with C48S and
C51S), indicating that HBP35 protein exhibits thioredoxin
activity and that the two cysteine residues (C48 and C51)
are crucial for this activity (Figure 6).
Diffuse bands of 50-90 kDa proteins are associated with
anionic polysaccharide

Nguyen et al. [11] revealed glycosylation of RgpB by
immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody (MAb
1B5) that recognizes the anionic polysaccharide of A-LPS
[10,15]. To determine whether HBP35 is glycosylated, we
carried out an immunoprecipitation experiment. Immunoprecipitates from the protein extracts of KDP136 (gingipain-null mutant) with an anti-HBP35 rabbit polyclonal
antibody contained the 40-kDa protein and diffuse pro-

analysis with an anti-HBP35 mouse monoclonal antibody
(MAb Pg-ompA2) [16]. The diffuse proteins of 50-90 kDa
immunoreacted with MAb 1B5, indicating that HBP35 is
associated with anionic polysaccharide on the cell surface
(Figure 7). It is likely that the diffuse bands are HBP35
proteins binding to anionic polysaccharides with different
numbers of repeating units.

As HBP35 contains the C-terminal domain motif that
may play a role in export and cell surface attachment, and
that the presence of diffuse bands of 50-90 kDa proteins
is similar to that of RgpB [8-11], it is possible that HBP35
is transported to the outer membrane and anchored to
the cell surface by the same transport system as RgpB.
Nguyen et al. [11] reported that the last five C-terminal
residues (KVIVK) of RgpB play a significant role in the
post-translational modification/proteolytic processing
and exportation of proteins to the outer membrane. To
determine whether the last five C-terminal residues
(K340VLVP344) of HBP35 play a role similar to that of
RgpB, we constructed an hbp35 deletion of K340-P344
mutant and found that the mutant showed no diffuse
bands but only 33-and 31-kDa proteins, which may have
been generated by degradation of HBP35 protein accumulating in the cell (Figure 8). The result suggests that
the last five C-terminal residues have an important role in
the transport of HBP35 protein to the cell surface.

Discussion
As P. gingivalis requires heme as the source of iron and
protoporphyrin IX, a heme binding and transport system
is essential for the microorganism to survive. Recently,
several TonB-linked outer membrane receptors for heme
utilization, including HmuR, Tlr, IhtA and HemR, have
been reported [4]. The ability to store heme in bacterial
cells appears to provide a nutritional advantage for survival of the bacterium in the iron-limited environment of
a healthy gingival crevice [17]. In fact, heme can bind the
P. gingivalis cell surface and may then be transported into
the cell by an energy-dependent process [18]. Shibata et
al. [7] found that purified rHBP35 protein (Q22-P344)
could bind hemin but not hemoglobin or lactoferrin.
HBP35 was suggested to possess a putative heme binding
sequence (Y50CPGGK55), however, we found in this study
that hemin could bind the mutant rHBP35 (Q22-P344 with
C48S and C51S) and the truncated rHBP35 (M135-P344)
(Figure 4B), indicating that the hemin binding site is
located between M135 and P344. The hbp35 mutants grew
more slowly than the wild type in hemin-depleted conditions and even in the condition with a sufficient hemin
concentration (5 μg/ml), indicating that HBP35 protein
plays a role in hemin utilization in various hemin levels.
The truncated HBP35 proteins of 27-and 29-kDa,
which were derived from a 3'-portion of the hbp35 gene,
were mainly located in the cytoplasm/periplasm fraction.
This finding together with the fact that there is no signal
peptide region in the two proteins suggests that these
proteins are located in the cytoplasm and contribute to
the intracellular storage of heme as does bacterioferritin

(Figure 6). Similar protein expression has been found in
Neisseria meningitidis: two forms of PilB protein are produced from the pilB gene. One is secreted to the outer
membrane as a whole polypeptide with methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) A and B activities, and the other is
a truncated form lacking an N-terminal thioredoxin
domain, which is generated from an internal AUG initiation codon and is located in the cytoplasm [19].
Hiratsuka et al. [20] have previously reported that
HBP35 shows no significant similarity with any other
known proteins. As the truncated rHBP35 (M135-P344)
protein has hemin binding activity, H204-H206, H252-H253,
and H261 within the truncated protein may interact with
heme, in a similar fashion to the myoglobin and hemoglobin heme pockets in which two histidines hold heme
through interaction with the central iron atom [21].

Recently, Dashper et al. [22] reported that expression of
the hbp35 gene in strain W50 was not induced under a
hemin-limited condition. We also observed that expression of the hbp35 gene in 33277 was not induced under
hemin-depleted conditions (data not shown). Although
HmuR, which is one of the hemin receptors, has been
found to be regulated by one transcriptional activator
[23], it seems unlikely that expression of the hbp35 gene is
regulated by a specific transcriptional activator under
hemin-depleted conditions.
Physiological roles of thioredoxins (Trxs) in P. gingivalis
have not been established. In general, the intracellular
environment is maintained in a reduced condition
because of the presence of small proteins with redoxactive cysteine residues, including Trxs, glutaredoxins
(Grxs), monocysteine tripeptide glutathione (GSH) and
other low-molecular-weight thiols [24,25]. In this regard,
analysis of the P. gingivalis 33277 and W83 genome
sequences revealed the presence of thioredoxin reductase
(TrxB; PGN1232 in 33277, PG1134 in W83), thioredoxin
homologue (PGN0033 in 33277, PG0034 in W83), and 5
thioredoxin family proteins (PGN0373, PGN0488,
PGN0659 (HBP35), PGN1181, and PGN1988 in 33277,
PG0275, PG0616 (HBP35), PG1084, PG1638, and
PG2042 in W83), and the absence of Grx, γ-glutamyl-Lcysteine-synthase and GSH synthetase. Recently, it has
been shown that Bacteroides fragilis, which is phylogenetically close to P. gingivalis, possesses the TrxB/Trx system as the only reductive system for oxidative stress [26].
We previously showed that the thioredoxin protein
(PGN0033) was increased when cells were exposed to
atmospheric oxygen [27]. Although physiological roles of
the thioredoxin domain of HBP35 protein are unknown
at present, the diffuse bands of 50-90 kDa proteins, which
contain the thioredoxin domain and are located on the
outer membrane, may contribute to the maintenance of
the redox status of the cell surface. However, we have not
obtained a positive result indicating that HBP35 protein
plays a role in protection against oxidative stresses so far.
Amino acid sequences in the RgpB that are necessary
for transport of the protein to the outer membrane have
been reported [8,11]. When recombinant truncated RgpB
lacking its C-terminal 72 residues was produced in P. gingivalis, there was an altered distribution of the protein in
the culture supernatant and periplasm. Seers et al. [8]
reported the importance of the C-terminal domain of
RgpB for attachment to the outer membrane and suggested that the domain is involved in a coordinated process of export and attachment to the cell surface. Nguyen
et al. [11] found that the last five C-terminal residues of
RgpB are conserved in a number of proteins of not only P.
gingivalis but also other periodontal pathogens such as
Prevotella intermedia and Tannerella forsythia and that
they have an important role in mediating correct folding

Shoji et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:152
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/152

of the nascent protein, which is then transported across
the periplasm to be fully glycosylated during its translocation across or on the outer membrane for anchorage to
the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. The last five Cterminal residues of HBP35 (KVLVP) contain a stretch of
polar-hydrophobic residues as well as those of RgpB
(KVIVK). We found in this study that the diffuse bands of
50-90 kDa proteins, which were the main products of the
hbp35 gene in the wild type, disappeared in the mutant
strain lacking the last five C-terminal residues of HBP35,
suggesting that, like RgpB, the C-terminal region of
HBP35 plays an important role in transport of HBP35 to
the outer membrane and anchorage to the membrane.
Very recently, we found a novel protein secretion system
(Por secretion system) in bacteria such as P. gingivalis
belonging to phylum Bacteroidetes and suggested that the
secretion system uses the C-terminal domain as a transportation signal [28]. HBP35 may therefore be transported to the cell surface via this secretion system.
The diffuse HBP35 protein bands of 50-90 kDa were
immunoreactive with APS-recognizing MAb 1B5, indicating that a part of HBP35 protein is glycosylated, which
is coordinated with the process of export. Rangarajan et
al. [15] have recently shown that the anionic polysaccharide is associated with lipid A and they therefore renamed
it LPS with APS repeating unit (A-LPS). HBP35 therefore
as well as RgpB may be glycosylated on the cell surface by
attachment to A-LPS.

Conclusion
We found that the hbp35 gene produced a 1.1-kb transcript and several translational products; (i) a 40-kDa
HBP35, which was derived from the whole hbp35 gene,
was mainly located in the inner membrane, (ii) 29-and
27-kDa HBP35 proteins were N-terminal-truncated
products lacking the signal peptide sequence and the thioredoxin domain and were mainly located in the cytoplasm, and (iii) diffuse HBP35 bands of 50-90 kDa
proteins were glycosylated and located on the outer
membrane. Analysis of these HBP35 proteins revealed
that they played a significant role in heme acquisition.
The last five C-terminal residues of HBP35 were crucial
for the secretion to the outer membrane.

Bertani (LB) broth and LB agar plates were used for
growth of E. coli strains. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin (Ap; 100 μg/ml for E.
coli, 10 μg/ml for P. gingivalis), erythromycin (Em; 10 μg/
ml for P. gingivalis), tetracycline (Tet; 0.7 μg/ml for P. gingivalis), kanamycin (Km; 50 μg/ml for E. coli).
Chemicals

Proteinase inhibitors Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl
ketone (TLCK) and iodoacetamide were purchased from
Wako, and leupeptin was obtained from Peptide Institute.
Construction of P. gingivalis mutant strains

P. gingivalis W83 and 33277 genome sequence data were
obtained from [GenBank: AE015924] and [GenBank:
AP009380], respectively. The DNA primers used in this
study are shown in Additional file 6. P. gingivalis hbp35
insertion mutant was constructed as follows. A DNA
fragment corresponding to a region (0.80 kb) containing
the C-terminal lower portion of PG0615 and the N-terminal upper portion of the PG0616 gene was generated
by PCR using P. gingivalis W83 chromosomal DNA as the
template with a forward primer, MS1, containing a KpnI
site (underlined) and a backward primer, MS2, containing
an EcoRI site (underlined). The resulting fragment was
cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) to yield
pKD732. A DNA fragment corresponding to a region
(0.70 kb) containing the C-terminal portion of the
PG0616 gene was generated by PCR using P. gingivalis
W83 chromosomal DNA as the template with a forward
primer, MS3, containing a BglII site (underlined) and a
backward primer, MS4, containing a NotI site (underlined). The resulting fragment was cloned into the
pGEM-T Easy vector to yield pKD733. The BglII-NotI
region of pKD733 containing the 0.70-kb fragment was
swapped with both equivalent sites of pKD704 [29],
resulting in pKD734. The KpnI-EcoRI region of pKD732
containing the 0.80-kb fragment was swapped with both
equivalent sites of pKD734, resulting in pKD735. Proper
orientation of the pKD735 gene was confirmed by DNA
sequence analysis. The pKD735 plasmid DNA was linearlized by NotI and introduced into P. gingivalis 33277 by
electroporation [29]. The cells were spread on TS agar
containing 10 μg/ml Em and incubated anaerobically for
7 days. Proper sequence replacement of the Em-resistant
transformants (KDP164 [insertion mutant]) was verified
by Southern and Western blot analyses. P. gingivalis
hbp35 whole gene deletion mutant from 33277 was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment corresponding to a
region (0.49 kb) within the PG0615 gene and upstream
region of PG0616 gene was generated by PCR using
pMD125 [30] as the template with a forward primer,
MS5, containing an SphI site (underlined) and a backward primer, MS6, containing a BamHI site (underlined).
The resulting fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T

Shoji et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:152
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/152

Easy Vector to yield pKD737. A DNA fragment corresponding to a region (0.47 kb) located between the
PG0617 gene and PG0618 gene upper region was
obtained by PCR with a forward primer, MS7, containing
a PstI site (underlined) and a backward primer, MS8, containing an SacI site (underlined). The resulting fragment
was cloned into pCR4 (Invitrogen) to yield pKD738. The
SphI-BamHI region of pKD737 containing the 0.49-kb
fragment was inserted into the same sites of pAL30 [22]
which contains the ermF gene in the pGEM-T Easy Vector and was located at the upper region of the ermF DNA
block (1.2 kb), resulting in pKD739. The PstI-SacI site of
pKD738 was inserted into the same sites of pKD739 that
was located at the lower region of the ermF DNA block,
resulting in pKD740. The pKD740 plasmid was linearlized by SacI and introduced into P. gingivalis 33277 by
electroporation. Proper sequence replacement of the
resulting Em-resistant transformant (KDP166 [deletion
mutant]) was verified by PCR analysis.
Plasmid construction for an hbp35 deletion (K340-P344)
mutant

To create an hbp35 mutant lacking the last five amino
acid residues (K340-P344), a DNA fragment corresponding
to a region (1.5 kb) containing the C-terminal lower portion of PG0615 and PG0616 lacking K340-P344 was generated by PCR using pMD125 as the template with a
forward primer, MS9, containing a KpnI site (underlined)
and a backward primer, MS10, containing a BamHI site
(underlined). The resulting fragment was cloned into the
pCR4 vector to yield pKD741. A DNA fragment corresponding to a region (0.47 kb) containing the PG0617
gene and PG0618 gene upper region was generated by
PCR using pMD125 as the template with a forward
primer, MS11, containing a BamHI site (underlined) and
a backward primer, MS12, containing a NotI site (underlined). The resulting fragment was cloned into the
pGEM-T Easy Vector to yield pKD742. The BamHI-NotI
site of pKD742 was inserted into the same sites of
pKD741 to yield pKD743. To create a BglII site located 8
bp upstream of PG0617 in pKD743, the two-stage PCRbased overlap extension method [31] was applied. MS9
and MS12, containing a NotI site (underlined), were used
as external primers, and MS13, containing a BglII site
(underlined), and MS14, containing a BglII site (underlined), were used as internal primers. Briefly, the amplified PCR fragments with MS9 and MS14 or with MS13
and MS12 were purified and further amplified with MS9
and MS12 primers by using both fragments as the template and was cloned into the pBluescript SK-, yielding
pKD744. The ermF-ermAM DNA block (2.1 kb) from
pKD399 [29] was inserted into the BglII site of pKD744
that was located at the junction of the 1.5-kb hbp35 gene-

Page 8 of 12

containing fragment and the 0.47-kb hbp35 downstream
fragment to yield pKD745. The pKD745 plasmid was linearlized by NotI and introduced into P. gingivalis 33277
by electroporation. Proper sequence replacement of the
resulting Em-resistant transformant (KDP167) was verified by PCR analysis.
Plasmid construction for an hbp35 gene complemented
strain

To construct a strain where the hbp35 would be restored,
the KpnI-BglII site of pKD744 was swapped with the PCR
fragment which was amplified by MS9 and a backward
primer, MS14, containing a BglII site (underlined) using
pMD125 as the template to yield pKD754, and then the
BamHI-BamHI fragment containing the cepA DNA
block by using CEPFOR and CEPREV primers from
pCS22 was inserted into the BglII site of pKD754 to yield
pKD755. The pKD755 plasmid was linearlized by NotI
and introduced into KDP166 by electroporation. Proper
sequence replacement of the resulting Ap-resistant transformant (KDP171) was verified by PCR and immunoblot
analyses.
Site-directed mutagenesis

To create hbp35 insertion mutants with M115A and/or
M135A, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a
QuickChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The hbp35 insertion mutant
targeting vector containing M115A substitution (pKD746)
was constructed with the oligonucleotide sense primer
MS15, containing an M115A substitution (underlined),
and antisense primer MS16, containing an M115A substitution (underlined), and the recombinant plasmid
pKD735 as the template. The hbp35 insertion mutant targeting vectors containing M135A (pKD747) or M115A
M135A substitutions (pKD748) were constructed with the
oligonucleotide sense primer MS17, containing an M135A
substitution (underlined), and antisense primer MS18,
containing an M135A substitution (underlined), and the
recombinant plasmid pKD735 and pKD746 as the template. To create hbp35[M115A], hbp35[M135A] or
hbp35[M115A M135A] insertion mutants which had an
insertion with the ermF-ermAM DNA cassette that was
located just upstream of F110, pKD746, pKD747 and
pKD748 were linearlized with NotI and introduced into P.
gingivalis 33277, giving KDP168, KDP169 and KDP170,
respectively.
Construction of expression plasmids

To create a recombinant HBP35 protein (A1-P344) with a
C-terminal histidine-tag overexpression system, a 1.0-kb
PCR fragment was amplified using forward primer MS19,
containing an NcoI site (underlined) and backward

Shoji et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:152
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/152

primer MS20, containing an XhoI site (underlined), and
then cloned into the pCR4 to yield pKD749. The EcoRIXhoI sites of pKD749 were inserted into the same sites of
pET21d(+), resulting in pKD750. To create a recombinant
HBP35 protein (Q22-P344) with an N-terminal histidinetag overexpression system, a 0.97-kb PCR fragments were
amplified using forward primer MS21 and backward
primer MS22 and then cloned into the pET30 Ek/LIC
vector (Novagen), resulting in pKD751. Site-directed
mutagenesis of the thioredoxin active site in HBP35 was
performed using a QuickChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit. A double amino acid substitution mutant
(rHBP35 Q22-P344 with C48S C51S) was created with the
oligonucleotide sense primer MS23, containing C48S and
C51S substitutions (underlined), and antisense primer
MS24, containing C48S and C51S substitutions (underlined), using the recombinant plasmid pKD751 as the
template to yield pKD752. Proper mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To create a recombinant
truncated HBP35 protein (M135-P344) with an N-terminal
histidine-tag overexpression system, a 0.66-kb PCR fragments were amplified using forward primer MS25 and
backward primer MS22, and then cloned into pET30Ek/
LIC vector, resulting in pKD753.
Expression and purification of P. gingivalis recombinant
HBP35 proteins

E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS harboring pKD750, pKD751,
pKD752 or pKD753 was cultured in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of Ap at 37°C to OD600 of 0.4-0.6, and then
IPTG was added to the culture at 1 mM, followed by an
additional 3-h incubation. The cells were harvested, suspended in buffer A (50 mM NaH2PO4 [pH 8.0], 500 mM
NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) and then disrupted with a
French Press. The mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 × g
for 15 min to separate the inclusion body fraction (pellet)
from the soluble fraction (supernatant). The supernatant
was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Ni2+-NTA agarose
column (Invitrogen) of 2 ml in bed volume and incubated
at 4°C for 30 min. The column was washed three times
with buffer B (50 mM NaH2PO4 [pH 8.0], 500 mM NaCl,
20 mM imidazole) and the bound protein was eluted with
10 ml of elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4 [pH 8.0], 500
mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole) as 1-ml fractions. The
fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The pure fractions were pooled and then dialyzed against milliQ water
and stored at -20°C until further use. N-terminal amino
acid sequencing (Edman sequencing) of the purified
rHBP35 protein with the C-terminal histidine-tag was
carried out using the service facility in CSIRO (Melbourne, Australia).

Gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis

SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of
Laemmli [32]. Protease inhibitors (leupeptin and TLCK)
were added to Laemmli solubilizing buffer to avoid proteolysis by endogenous proteases. The gels were stained
with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB). For
immunoblotting, proteins on SDS-PAGE gels were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes (Immobilon P; Millipore) as
described previously [33]. The blotted membranes were
detected with an anti-HBP35 polyclonal antibody [6].
Preparation of P. gingivalis subcellular fractions

P. gingivalis cells were harvested from 400 ml of fullygrown culture by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min
at 4°C, washed twice with 10 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4)
containing 0.15 M NaCl, and resuspended in 20 ml of
HEPES containing 0.1 mM TLCK, 0.1 mM leupeptin and
0.2 mM PMSF. The cells were disrupted with a French
Press by three passes at 100 MPa in the presence of 25 μg/
ml each of RNase and DNase. Unbroken cells were
removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min and the
supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at
100,000 × g for 60 min. The precipitates were treated with
1% Triton-X100 in HEPES containing 20 mM MgCl2 for
30 min at 20°C. The inner and outer membrane fractions
were recovered as a supernatant and a pellet, respectively,
by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C
[34].
In-gel digestion of proteins and Peptide Mass
Fingerprinting

To identify the 27-kDa protein, P. gingivalis KDP161 cells
were harvested, and the cell pellets were dissolved with
RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5%
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)
and then immunoprecipitated by EZview red protein A
affinity gel (Sigma) with anti-HBP35 polyclonal antibody,
followed by SDS-PAGE analysis with CBB staining and
immunoblot analysis. Protein bands from the SDS-PAGE
gel were excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion
as described previously [8,9]. Gel pieces were washed in
50 mM NH4HCO3-ethanol (1:1, vol/vol), reduced, alkylated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide, respectively,
and digested with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (10
ng/μl) (Promega) overnight at 37°C. Each digest (0.5 μl)
was then analyzed by mass spectrometry using an Ultraflex TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany) in positive-ion and reflectron mode. A saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was
prepared in 97:3 (vol/vol) acetone-0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). A thin layer of matrix was prepared

Shoji et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:152
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/152

by pipetting and immediately transferring 2 μl of this
solution onto 600-μm anchors of an AnchorChip target
plate (Bruker Daltonics). The tryptic digest sample (0.5
μl) was then deposited onto the thin layers with 2.5 μl of
0.1% (vol/vol) TFA for 1 min. Mass spectra were calibrated by external calibration using a standard peptide
mix (Bruker Daltonics). Proteins were identified by PMF
against the P. gingivalis database (available at The Institute for Genomic Research [TIGR] website [http://
www.tigr.org]) using an in-house Mascot search engine
(Matrix Science Ltd., London, United Kingdom) and
BioTools 2.2 software (Bruker Daltonics) and by comparison with tryptic peptide mass lists generated by using
General Protein Mass Analysis for Windows software
(Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark).
Northern blot analysis

Total RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis of
mRNA were carried out as described previously [35] with
some modifications. The 0.96-kb DNA fragment coding
for Q22 to P344 of HBP35 and the 0.80-kb DNA fragment
coding for M1 to S266 of ErmF were obtained by PCR that
were used as the radiolabelled hbp35 and ermF probes,
respectively. To label the DNA probes, [α-32P]dCTP and
the ready-to-go DNA labeling beads kit (GE Healthcare)
was used. The radiolabelled products were analyzed with
a fluoro-image analyzer FLA-5100 (Fujifilm).
Hemin binding assay

Hemin binding to rHBP35 proteins was assayed using the
catalytic property of hemoprotein, which has peroxidase
activity in the presence of H2O2, by the method of Shibata
et al. [7] with some modifications. Ten microliters of protein solution (2 μg) was treated with 1.5 μl of 1.25 mM
hemin for 2 h at room temperature. After SDS-PAGE, the
gel was washed twice for 30 min in TBS buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl) and then exposed to a reaction buffer (1 mg of 4-methoxy-1-naphthol, 20 μl H2O2 in
50 ml TBS buffer) for 30 min at room temperature.
Hemin starvation

To determine the ability for growth under hemin starvation conditions, bacterial strains to be tested were first
grown in the presence of hemin for 48 h and then
deprived of hemin. The overnight cultures were prepared
by growing the strains in hemin-containing enriched BHI
broth overnight. In the case of first grown in hemin-containing BHI broth for 48 h, the overnight cultures were
diluted 50-fold with hemin-containing BHI broth. Then
the first grown bacterial cultures to be tested were diluted
50-fold with hemin-free BHI broth. The cell density of
the culture was measured at OD595.

Insulin reduction assay

A fresh solution of 1 mg/ml insulin was prepared in 100
mM potassium phosphate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.0. The
assay mixture contained a total volume of 800 μl of 100
mM potassium phosphate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.0, 0.13
mM insulin, 1 mM DTT, and 1 μM of freshly purified
recombinant histidine-tagged HBP35 protein in the standard insulin disulfide reduction assay [14]. The increase
in turbidity due to formation of the insoluble insulin B
chain was measured at OD650 and 30°C. One micromolar
fresh E. coli thioredoxin 1 (Sigma) was used as a positive
control.
Immunoprecipitation experiment

The harvested P. gingivalis KDP136 (gingipain-null
mutant) cells [36] were dissolved with RIPA buffer (150
mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1%
SDS and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) under absence of protease inhibitors and immunoprecipitated by protein G
agarose beads (GE Healthcare) with 5 μg of anti-HBP35
polyclonal antibody or 5 μg of anti-Dps polyclonal antibody, or without an antibody. Each resulting precipitate
was dissolved with the same volume of the sample buffer
and loaded on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblot analysis was performed with MAb 1B5 [10], MAb
Pg-ompA2 [16] and anti-Dps antibody [37].
