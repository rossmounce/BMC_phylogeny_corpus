Abstract
Background: Recent surveys of eukaryote 18S rDNA diversity in marine habitats have uncovered worldwide
distribution of the heterotrophic eukaryote phylum Telonemia. Here we investigate the diversity and geographic
distribution of Telonemia sequences by in-depth sequencing of several new 18S rDNA clone libraries from both marine
and freshwater sites by using a Telonemia-specific PCR strategy.
Results: In contrast to earlier studies that have employed eukaryote-wide PCR design, we identified a large and
unknown diversity of phylotypes and the first rigorous evidence for several freshwater species, altogether comprising
91 unique sequences. Phylogenies of these and publicly available sequences showed 20 statistically supported subclades as well as several solitary phylotypes with no clear phylogenetic affiliation. Most of these sub-clades were
composed of phylotypes from different geographic regions.
Conclusions: By using specific PCR primers we reveal a much larger diversity of Telonemia from environmental
samples than previously uncovered by eukaryote-wide primers. The new data substantially diminish the geographic
structuring of clades identified in earlier studies. Nevertheless, since these clades comprise several distinct phylotypes
we cannot exclude endemicity at species level. We identified two freshwater clades and a few solitary phylotypes,
implying that Telonemia have colonized freshwater habitats and adapted to the different environmental and
ecological conditions at independent occasions.
Background
Microorganisms usually exist in populations of huge sizes
and are highly prone to long-distance dispersal by vectors
such as wind, water, animals and humans [1-5]. Obvious
barriers to dispersal are lacking, especially in the marine
habitat [4-8]. The ubiquitous dispersal of microorganisms
has been a prevalent view since the turn of the last century, summarized in the statement "everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects" [9,10]. This view has
been challenged however, by investigations of environmental DNA clone libraries as a large number of cryptic
species and restricted biogeographies have been revealed
[11-20]. High levels of genetic diversity have been found,
even within the slowly evolving small ribosomal subunit
gene [21,22]. However, as more localities are being inves* Correspondence: kamran@bio.uio.no

tigated and the variety of sampling strategies increase, the
geographic ranges of many microorganisms have been
expanded, showing that under-sampling of the diversity
can cause a false impression of endemism [see [4,5]].
Some surveys have therefore interpreted the diversity as
consistent with the "Moderate Endemicity Model"
(MEM), which states that some microbial lineages do in
fact have a global distribution, but that there also exists
species with restricted dispersal and local adaptations
[4,23-25].
The vast majority of 18S rDNA environmental surveys
conducted so far have involved universal primers
designed to capture the broadest diversity of eukaryotes
possible. However, much diversity is most likely overlooked by applying only a single pair of universal primers
[26-28]. This could be due to a number of reasons, e.g.
the primers are less suitable for some groups of organisms, there are great variations in rDNA copy number, as
well as bias introduced in the PCR reaction. One of the

most efficient approaches to address these problems has
been to apply a group-specific PCR strategy with primers
targeting the particular taxonomic group of interest [2932]. These studies have shown that the use of such primers is detecting far more diversity than the universal
approach.
Telonemia is one of the groups of unicellular eukaryotes that are frequently detected in marine 18S rDNA
environmental clone libraries, but usually represents only
a relatively small part of the total diversity [11,33-36]. So
far, only two species have been described on the basis of
morphology, Telonema subtilis Griessmann and T. antarcticum Thomsen in Klaveness et al. [20,37], but the size
range of the identified species is large (3.5 - 15 μm long
and 4-20 μm wide). It was recently discovered by Shalchian-Tabrizi et al. [36] that the 18S rDNA sequences
formed two major groups, Group 1 and 2, including T.
subtilis and T. antarcticum respectively, and that these
were further sub-divided into several statistically supported clades of sequences with restricted geographic
distribution.
Species of Telonemia are heterotrophic predators, feeding on a wide range of bacteria and pico- to nano-sized
phytoplankton. They are globally distributed in marine
waters and are frequently encountered in environmental
clone libraries e.g. [34,38]. Telonemia are present
throughout the year and are considered to play an important ecological role, as they have been found to dominate
the heterotrophic protist community on certain occasions [37]. Very little is known about the life cycle and
reproduction of Telonemia. Asexual reproduction occurs
by cell division and the possible presence of cysts has
been indicated by Vørs [39], but this is yet to be verified.
Telonemia has also been reported from fresh water
habitats. Tong et al. [40] identified a freshwater T. subtilis
in an Antarctic lake, Sombre Lake, but it is unclear if this
specimen is truly freshwater as the lake has been classified as maritime [41]. A survey of Finnish lakes recorded
Telonema sp. on a number of occasions (Liisa Lepistö,
personal communication). The ability to survive under
low salinity conditions have also been shown in culture
experiments done on T. subtilis from Norwegian coastal
waters [42]. Although Telonemia has been observed at
several occasions in freshwater, only a few 18S rDNA
sequences appear to be related to the group [43]. Therefore, it is still unclear how large the diversity of Telonemia
might be in these habitats and what phylogenetic relationship they have to marine species. It is also unclear
whether Telonemia have colonized these habitats at one
or several independent occasions, and if both the two
major groups related to T. subtilis and T. antarcticum
have been successfully established in freshwater.
Here, we have designed Telonemia-specific 18S rDNA
primers in order to investigate (i) whether group-specific

Page 2 of 9

environmental PCR will uncover a larger diversity of
Telonemia than so far uncovered by universal primers, (ii)
whether increased taxon sampling will affect the geographic structuring observed for many clades of marine
Telonemia [36], and (iii) to examine whether one or several species exist in freshwater, and whether both Group
1 and 2 comprise species from freshwater. We address
these questions by sequencing clone libraries from 4
marine and 3 freshwater localities, as well as including all
available Telonemia sequences already published. We
identify a large and unknown diversity of phylogenetically
distinct sequences (phylotypes) in marine waters and
provide the first rigorous evidence for the presence of
several freshwater species related to both T. subtilis and
T. antarcticum resulting from independent colonisations
of freshwater.

Results and discussion
Large cryptic diversity of Telonemia in marine habitats

Despite the huge amount of environmental 18S rDNA
sequences from numerous diversity studies available in
public databases, only 33 were found to belong to Telonemia in Shalchian-Tabrizi et al. [36], all amplified by universal eukaryotic primers. These sequences were divided
into two main groups, Group 1 and Group 2, including T.
subtilis and T. antarcticum respectively [36]. Within these
groups, twelve distinct sub-groups or independent phylotypes were identified, each possibly representing several
species or populations. The majority of these clades were
composed of sequences from single localities, suggesting
a considerable geographic structuring of Telonemia [36].
By using group-specific primers we generated 145 18S
rDNA sequences affiliated to Telonemia. No sequences
from other eukaryote groups were generated. The evolutionary origin of these sequences was inferred by phylogenetic analyses of an alignment containing a broad
diversity of eukaryotic lineages (alignment 1) that
included our new data and all putative Telonemia
sequences downloaded from GenBank (result not
shown). Hence, the group specific PCR strategy for
Telonemia clearly improves our knowledge about the
diversity of the group.
To better resolve the phylogeny of the Telonemia
sequences we removed all other eukaryote groups (except
haptophytes, cryptophytes and katablepharids used as
outgroups) that allowed for inclusion of more unambiguously aligned nucleotide characters (i.e. alignment 2).
This phylogeny recovered Group 1 and 2, here renamed
to TEL 1 and TEL 2 respectively, with high support (1.00
posterior probability (pp) and >99% bootstrap support
(%); Figure 1). Furthermore at least 20 sub-groups (1a-1d
and 2a-2p in Figure 1) were supported with substantial
statistical support. Several of these groups could perhaps
be even further subdivided, based on the internal support

values (e.g. groups 1b and 2i) but are here treated as single groups for simplicity. The naming of the groups follows that of Shalchian-Tabrizi et al. [36] and has been
extended here to include the new sub-groups.
As previously recognized, TEL 1 contained fewer clades
than TEL 2 and is here divided into 4 sub-groups. Earlier,
TEL 1 was found to be restricted to the English Channel
and Danish waters [36], but is here extended to include
phylotypes from the Antarctic and Arctic regions as well
as warmer waters such as the Indian Ocean, Hawaiian
waters, the Mediterranean Sea and Chinese waters. In
TEL 2 we could now identify 16 sub-groups sampled
from worldwide locations such as the Arctic and Antarctic oceans, the English Channel, Danish and German
waters, the Indian Ocean, Sargasso Sea, Mediterranean
Sea and Hawaiian waters.
Implications on the geographic structuring of Telonemia

The geographic structuring shown by Shalchian-Tabrizi
et al. [36] is here diminished by the addition of more environmental sequences (Figure 1). Several of the subgroups previously found to have restricted geographic
ranges now includes sequences from new locations. For
instance the sub-groups 2m and 2o (earlier 2c and 2b; Figure 1), previously found to be restricted to the Arctic
Ocean, are now extended to the Indian Ocean, Hawaiian
waters and the Mediterranean Sea. The sub-group 2k
(earlier 2g), which was previously restricted to the English
Channel, Oslo Fjord and Helgoland (i.e. southern parts of
the North Sea/Skagerak), now includes sequences from
the Mediterranean Sea as well. Additionally, most of the
sub-groups new to this study have widespread distributions; e.g. sub-group 1b is composed of sequences from
the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific
Ocean, while sub-group 2l is composed of sequences
from as distant locations as the Arctic Ocean, Western
Pacific, Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean.
Although the majority of the subgroups show little geographic structuring, the high diversity uncovered here
implies that geographical isolation has existed at some
point. The combination of high diversity and low geographic structuring show that subsequent dispersal rates
have been higher than speciation rates over the history of
Telonemia.
The existence of endemicity cannot be completely
excluded however. One important reason is that each
clade may represent higher order taxonomic units, like
genera or families, and each phylotype can in principle
represent separate species (or even several species as 18S
rDNA may be too conserved to demarcate species
boundaries [21,25,44]). Hence, the widespread geography
of the subgroups may be hiding endemicity at strain or
species level; in fact we could not identify the same phylotypes from different localities. Sampling of DNA from

Page 4 of 9

more sites and a larger variety of marine habitats, as well
as the use of faster evolving genetic markers, such as the
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal
operon, would be necessary to resolve this question. On
the other hand, any putative geographic restriction of
species or groups should be interpreted with caution
because endemicity in general is difficult to prove, as
there will always be a possibility of undersampling and
absence of species at times of sampling due to seasonal
variations.
There are a few tendencies of endemicity or restricted
biogeography in the inferred phylogeny (Figure 1) that
deserve to be noted here and should be subject for future
studies of Telonemia. In particular, a striking pattern is
seen for sequences from Antarctic and Arctic regions
clustering into sub-group 1a, which opens up the possibility for a bi-polar or anti-tropical distribution. If further
diversity studies confirm this pattern, it would be congruent with geographic distribution of dinoflagellates and
foraminiferans [45,46]. Three other clades also appear to
be endemic; the clade 2i from the Sargasso Sea and 2h
and 2f, are only composed of Indian Ocean and the Norwegian Framvaren Fjord sequences respectively (Figure
1). In addition there is a large assembly of sequences from
the Svalbard region that could indicate the presence of a
Norwegian-Barents Sea population, but this assembly is
only moderately supported (Figure 1).
Cryptic diversity of Telonemia in freshwater

In order to investigate the putative existence of Telonemia in freshwater we had to use a nested PCR amplification strategy. This could explain why so little sequence
data from Telonemia in freshwater has been generated
previously and confirm visual observations that freshwater Telonemia exists only in minute quantities (L. Lepistö
unpublished). The sequences obtained from the three different Norwegian freshwater lakes, Lake Lutvann, Lake
Sværsvann and Lake Pollen, together with a few publicly
available freshwater environmental sequences, formed
three clades (1d, 2e and 2p) and two single phylotypes
with representatives in both TEL 1 and TEL 2 (Figure 1).
In Lake Lutvann we sampled both the sediment and the
water column. Strikingly, these sequences formed two
distantly related habitat-specific clades, in which all the
benthic sequences clustered into one group (1d) and the
pelagic sequences into another (2e), highlighting a vertical stratification of phylotypes or populations within this
lake at the time of sampling (Figure 1). Sub-group 2e was
in addition composed of sequences from the pelagic zone
of the two other Norwegian lakes as well as three other
freshwater sequences from Svalbard and France.
A few other phylotypes in TEL 1 may represent additional successful transitions from marine to freshwater
lakes. One sequence (DGGE band 20) is sampled from a

Bråte et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:168
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/168

hyperhaline lake in Chile, Lake Tebenquiche that is situated in the Andes at 2500 m.a.s.l. The lake is classified as
hyperhaline but has extreme variations in salinity, ranging from 1% to 30% [47]; hence the potential Telonemia
species from this lake could be adapted to any of these
salinity conditions or could simply be a marine species
that have dispersed into the lake. Another sequence (B-28), is sampled from the Bayelva River in Svalbard, which
is composed of glacial melt water as well as water from
nearby freshwater lakes [48], and discharges into the
Kings Bay delta in Spitsbergen. Interestingly the two
sequences (SS1E0120 and SS1E0155) that have been
obtained from the Kings Bay is branching off close to the
sequence from the Bayela River in Figure 1, and may
therefore actually have freshwater origin.
A third cluster of freshwater sequences (2p), entirely
composed of sequences sampled from a glacier in Svalbard, belonged to TEL 2. This cluster was distantly
related to the other freshwater group (2e) and was
embedded in a large assembly of Arctic and Antarctic
sequences, although this relationship was weakly supported (Figure 1). T. subtilis is commonly observed
inhabiting the sea-ice in the Baltic Sea [49] and it is therefore possible that these sequences originate from a
marine species transported onto the glacier from marine
waters by aerosols or other vectors. On the other hand, if
these represent an actual freshwater species this would be
a second freshwater species within TEL 2, distantly
related to the Bayelva River sequences. It remains to be
verified that these are actually living cells and whether
these have been transported from freshwater sources or
dispersed on to the glacier from marine habitats via aerosols or other vectors. So far, we have not detected
sequences from the marine samples that are identical to
these glacier phylotypes, which could indicate such freshwater dispersal, but as only few samples have been made
in these areas we cannot exclude this possibility.
Few marine-freshwater cross-colonizations

In Figure 1 the freshwater sequences form distinct clusters and phylotypes, suggesting the existence of several
different freshwater species. These are placed within both
TEL 1 and TEL 2, demonstrating that relatively distantly
related species of Telonemia exists in freshwater. This
diversity is detected even with a very limited number of
samples; we therefore expect future surveys of other
types of freshwaters at other continents to uncover an
even larger diversity. The clustering pattern of the
Telonemia sequences is in accordance with recent studies
of other protist groups showing that freshwater species
form distinct clades in phylogenetic trees, i.e. they are
more closely related to each other than to marine species
[reviewed in [50]]. Such clustering pattern of freshwater
phylotypes has in these studies been interpreted as suc-

cessful marine-freshwater transitions. These transitions
have often been ancient and rare events, resulting in most
of the extant species being restricted to either of the two
habitats: e.g. in bodonids [51], goniomonas [52], cryptomonads [53], dinoflagellates [54] and Perkinsea [55]. If
further examinations of freshwater with the use of
Telonemia-specific PCR approaches confirms the clustering pattern shown here (see Figure 1), it would imply that
the biogeophysical differences between marine and fresh
waters constitutes a significant ecological barrier for dispersal of Telonemia that affects diversification of the lineage. In addition to more samples from various
freshwater localities, a better identification of the species
is necessary in order to further reveal the species diversity. For instance, analyzing RNA to confirm that the species are alive and metabolize in the habitat, and
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) would be helpful in relating the sequences to the actual cells in the habitats, and to better understand whether the dispersal of
species between different and similar habitats take place
in the form of spores or as active cells.
Each of the freshwater clades in our tree are habitatspecific in that they only contain phylotypes from either
sediment (clade 1d), pelagic (clade 2e), and potentially
also glacier (clade 2p) and hyperhaline habitats, implying
that each of these habitats have possibly been colonized
independently by marine species and adapted to different
environmental and ecological conditions. Interestingly,
this clustering pattern indicate the existence of ecological
barriers also between freshwaters habitats, but as this
study primarily has focused on revealing the existence of
Telonemia in freshwater, the geographic distribution of
the various strains and species should be addressed by
much more extensive sampling and adequate molecular
methods.

Conclusions
Here we have applied a group-specific PCR approach to
better understand the diversity of Telonemia and to
investigate whether the geographic structuring observed
in earlier studies has been affected by undersampling.
Our results show that the use of group-specific primers
will uncover a much larger diversity from environmental
samples compared to eukaryote-wide primers. The
Telonemia-specific primers and the PCR protocol presented here were highly specific for the Telonemia group
as no sequences from other eukaryote groups were identified in our sequence libraries. Further, the geographic
structuring of marine groups found in earlier analyses is
clearly diminished by the addition of the newly generated
sequences, showing that undersampling of the diversity
may lead to a false impression of endemicity. However, as
only two species of Telonemia are defined on basis of
morphology, it is not clear what taxonomic units the

Bråte et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:168
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/168

identified clades represent. Most likely each of these subgroups are composed of many distinct species, as they
comprise phylotypes with different 18S rDNA sequences.
If each phylotype is representing separate species, it will
be a tremendous task to understand the geographic distribution of each. Nevertheless, congruent with other
recent studies [29-32] we have clearly shown the importance of using a group-specific PCR approach to better
understand the cryptic diversity of protist groups. Studies
of endemicity could be further undertaken by designing
procedures that target each of the subgroups detected
here and complemented with FISH and RNA sequencing
strategies to verify that the species actually inhabit the
location. For species or population demarcation, other
faster evolving markers, such as ITS, may be needed.
There is however a challenge when studying uncultured
species to directly compare the phylogenetic clades based
on different genes.
We provide here the first rigorous evidence for the existence of freshwater Telonemia. Two groups of freshwater
sequences are identified showing that multiple and independent transitions from marine to freshwater have taken
place during the evolutionary history of the group. It is
obvious that the diversity of freshwater Telonemia is
highly underestimated, and the ecological roles of
Telonemia in these habitats are so far very much unclear.
The possible stratification of species in freshwater is a
first glimpse of potential differences in ecological adaptations - more studies combining molecular and microscopy approaches are clearly necessary to assess the
diversity and dispersal patterns of Telonemia.

Methods
Environmental samples

Freshwater samples were collected from three different
Norwegian lakes in May 2007; Lake Lutvann (59°54'N
and 10°52'E) a small and deep (Zmax = 52 m) clearwater
oligotrophic lake with long retention time, Lake Pollen
(59°44'N and 10°45'E) a small and meromictic lake of
intermediate depth (Zmax = 18 m) with only 7 m of
freshwater and seawater in the monimolimnion, and Lake
Sværsvann (59°48'N and 10°53'E) a small and shallow
(Zmax = 11 m) meso- to polyhumic lake of complex morphology. Two litres of surface water (down to 50 cm) was
collected from each lake and filtered through a Whatman
GF/C glass-fiber filter with pore sizes of approximately 1
μm. Filters were dried and stored at -20°C. Sediment samples from Lake Lutvann were collected with a simple
gravity corer at three depths, 50 m, 20 m and 5 m. The
sediment samples from Lake Lutvann, including up to
500 ml of lake water were kept at 17°C with a 14/10 h
light/dark cycle. 100 ml of culture of the cryptomonad
species Plagioselmis nannoplanctica was added on average every three days for the Telonemia species to feed

Page 6 of 9

upon for seven days. P. nannoplanktica was grown in the
freshwater media of Guillard & Lorenzen [56] without
organic buffer.
Marine DNA was sampled from the following locations; Antarctica (59°22'S, 55°46W, December 1998), The
Arctic Ocean (NOR26 and PD6 samples: 76°19'N, 23°45'E
and NOR46 and AD6 samples: 76°20'N, 03°59'E, August
2002), The Mediterranean Sea (41°40'N, 2°48'E, January
2004) and the Indian Ocean (31°45'S, 52°37'E, May/June
1999). For sampling and DNA isolation methods see
[11,57-59].
DNA isolation and sequencing

DNA was isolated from the different freshwater samples
by using the Power Max Soil DNA Isolation kit (MoBio,
USA) following the manufacturers instructions. For DNA
isolation from the sediments, 15 ml of sediment from the
top layer were collected and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for
10 minutes. The isolated DNA was stored at -20°C.
Nested PCR was used to amplify the 18S rDNA gene
from the freshwater samples with universal eukaryotic
primers (based on PrimerA and PrimerB by Medlin et al.
[60]; here called 1F and 1528R) used in the first round of
amplification and Telonemia-specific primers used in the
second round (for primer sequences, see Figure 2). The
amplifications were done on an Eppendorf Mastercycler
ep (Eppendorf, Germany) and a Biometra Thermocycler
(Biometra, Germany) with a sample volume of 25 μl containing 10 - 200 ng of template DNA, 1 × HotMaster Taq
Buffer with 2.5 mM Mg2+ (5 Prime, USA), 200 μM
dNTPs, 0.2 μM of each primer and 1.5 U HotMaster Taq
DNA Polymerase (5 Prime, USA). The reaction mixture
was incubated at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 - 34
cycles of 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 60°C, 135 s at 72°C with a
final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products
were gel-extracted and purified using Wizard SV Gel and
PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, USA), and cloned using
TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, USA) following the
manufacturers instructions. Colonies were checked for
positive inserts by PCR amplification with the primers

TopoF
(5'-GGCTCGTATGTTGTGTGGAATTGT-3')
and TopoR (5'-CCGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTGACT3') and identical reaction mixtures as described above,
except that DynaZymeII (Finnzymes, Finland) DNA polymerase (1.5 U) and 1 × DynaZyme buffer (F-511) were
used. The PCR program was as follows: Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, 34 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 30 s at
60°C, 120 s at 72°C with a final extension at 72°C for 7
min. The positive inserts were sequenced on an ABI 3730
DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA) with the primers M13F and M13R (Invitrogen, USA) using the ABI BigDye terminator v3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). 183
clones were randomly picked from the generated libraries
and sequenced with the M13F primer (Invitrogen, USA).
Identical, or nearly identical, sequences were not
sequenced further. 82 of the inserts were full-length
sequenced (approximately 1500 bp) with the M13R
primer (Invitrogen, USA). Accession numbers for
sequences generated in this study [GenBank: GQ365764GQ365903 and GU117661-GU117693].
Phylogenetic analyses

Available sequences of possible Telonemia origin were
identified by BLAST searches against the Entrez Nucleotide database [61,62] using sequences of known Telonemia origin as query. The sequences identified from the
BLAST searches were downloaded and pooled into a
local database together with the sequences generated in
this study. These sequences were added to an 18S rDNA
alignment of all the major eukaryotic groups (hereafter
called alignment 1) to confirm relationship to Telonemia.
After removal of ambiguously aligned characters using
the program MacClade version 4.07 [63], alignment 1
consisted of 374 taxa and 1465 characters. Alignment 1
was subjected to maximum likelihood (ML) analyses by
using the program RAxML v.6 [64]. The topology with
the highest likelihood score out of 100 heuristic searches,
each from a random starting tree, was selected, and bootstrapping was done with 100 pseudoreplicates and one
heuristic search per replicate. In the ML analyses, the
General Time Reversible (GTR) model, with a gammadistributed rate of variation across sites (G), was
employed.
The ML analyses of alignment 1 showed that 198
sequences grouped together within Telonemia (results
not shown). To be able to include more unambiguously
aligned characters, a second alignment (alignment 2) was
created with MacClade version 4.07 [63], consisting of
the Telonemia sequences identified in the analysis of
alignment 1. Identical sequences were excluded and the
putative closest sister groups of Telonemia, the cryptomonads, haptophytes and katablepharids, were used as
an outgroup [20]. Chimeric sequences were identified as
described in [65]. The sequence NW614.39 is chimeric

Page 7 of 9

with the last 100 bp from a diatom. This part of the
sequence was not included in the analyses. Accession
numbers and clone names of sequences in alignment 2
are given in Additional file 1. Alignment 2 consisted of
159 taxa and 1758 characters. This alignment was analysed by ML (as for alignment 1) and Bayesian inferences.
The Bayesian inferences were done with the program
MrBayes [66] as follows: two independent runs, each with
three cold and one heated MCMC (Markov Chain Monte
Carlo) chains were started from a random starting tree.
The two runs lasted for 4,000,000 generations. The covarion (COV) model was used together with the GTR+G+I
to accommodate for different substitution rates across
sites (G + proportion of invariable sites (I)) and across
sequences (COV). The covarion model included two
parameters, sites being on > off and off > on. All phylogenetic analyses were done on the freely available Bioportal
at University of Oslo http://www.bioportal.uio.no.
