Abstract
Background: The uncoupling protein (UCP) genes belong to the superfamily of electron
transport carriers of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Members of the uncoupling protein family
are involved in thermogenesis and determining the functional evolution of UCP genes is important
to understand the evolution of thermo-regulation in vertebrates.
Results: Sequence similarity searches of genome and scaffold data identified homologues of UCP
in eutherians, teleosts and the first squamates uncoupling proteins. Phylogenetic analysis was used
to characterize the family evolutionary history by identifying two duplications early in vertebrate
evolution and two losses in the avian lineage (excluding duplications within a species, excluding the
losses due to incompletely sequenced taxa and excluding the losses and duplications inferred
through mismatch of species and gene trees). Estimates of synonymous and nonsynonymous
substitution rates (dN/dS) and more complex branch and site models suggest that the duplication
events were not associated with positive Darwinian selection and that the UCP is constrained by
strong purifying selection except for a single site which has undergone positive Darwinian selection,
demonstrating that the UCP gene family must be highly conserved.
Conclusion: We present a phylogeny describing the evolutionary history of the UCP gene family
and show that the genes have evolved through duplications followed by purifying selection except
for a single site in the mitochondrial matrix between the 5th and 6th α-helices which has undergone
positive selection.

Background
The mitochondrion is the main intracellular site of energy
production and is the evolutionary response to the main
challenge that living organisms have to face: gaining
energy from their environments to sustain their biological
functions. The mitochondrial production of ATP is realised by the combination of the phosphorylation of ADP
into ATP with an efficient chain of redox reactions, resulting in the so-called oxidative phosphorylation. However,

these two processes are not always efficiently coupled, and
one reason is the presence in the inner membrane of a
family of mitochondrial transporters: the uncoupling proteins (UCP, [1]). UCP1 was first discovered and cloned in
1986 [2] and is involved in the non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) activity of rodent's brown adipose tissue (BAT,
[3]). Since then, the discovery of UCP genes has grown
rapidly, UCP1 homologues being found across mammalian species (UCP2, UCP3, [4,5]) but also in other eukaryPage 1 of 13

otes from plants to animals [6-8]. Most of the recent
attention has been devoted to the evolutionary history of
UCP1 since the discovery of UCP1 in ectotherm organisms like teleost fish [9] and amphibians [10]. The fact
that organisms that do not show NST possess and express
UCP1 raised the question of the exact evolutionary history
of UCP1 and of its link with the apparition of thermoregulation. This observation has stimulated an increasing
number of phylogenetic studies on UCP [10-15] to determine the origin of the physiological particularity (coldinduced thermogenesis in BAT) in the mammalian lineage [13].
UCP1 and its close homologues (UCP2 and UCP3) are
thought to differ in the nature of their uncoupling activity
[16,17] and their potential physiological roles (see [18]).
Indeed, a rapid overview of the data collected on UCP1, 2
and 3 highlights how these proteins may be different.
First, while UCP1 tissue expression is localized (and
abundant) to BAT, UCP2 is expressed (in smaller quantities) in a wider range of cell types (like immune or pancreatic β-cells) and UCP3 is mainly present in skeletal muscle
([4,5], see [19]). Also, the physiological role of UCP1 is
restricted to thermogenesis, which is unlikely to be the
case for UCP2 and 3 as shown by their respective knockout models [20,21]. UCP2 and 3 have been involved in a
number of postulated functions in energy regulation,
including regulation of insulin secretion [22] or reactive
oxygen species production and control of the immune
response [20,23,24]. However, accurate data on the mitochondrial activity of UCP2 and UCP3 are still lacking to
determine the exact nature of their biological activity
[17,25]. Therefore, despite the high sequence identity
shared by UCP1, 2 and 3 (close to 60% in humans and
mice), punctual amino acid replacement at key structural
domains of the respective proteins may have evolved to
allow functional specificity to take place. Interestingly,
mutagenesis experiments have shown that single aminoacid replacement in UCP1 protein may change its proton
permeability (nature of the mitochondrial transport), its
sensibility to fatty acid activation or nucleotide inhibition
(regulation of the activity, [26]), or its transmembrane
structure [27]. The next step in the understanding of the
biology of UCP is to determine whether the evolution of
UCP genes and protein sequences may have been subjected to different selective pressures after duplication.
Single copy genes are thought to evolve conservatively
because of strong negative selective pressure. Gene duplications produce a redundant gene copy and thus release
one or both copies from negative selection pressure. There
are a number of models for the fate of gene duplicates, the
two most prominent of which are neofunctionilization
and subfunctionalisation. Thus, duplications are thought
to be an important precursor of functional divergence.

The increased availability of UCP sequences in the public
databases allows the study of the molecular evolution of
the UCP gene family and the evaluation of selection following duplication events. In the present study, we will
determine (1) the evolutionary history of the UCP gene
family, (2) evaluate the changes in selection pressures following duplications, and (3) identify sites under positive
Darwinian selection.

Results
Sequence similarity searches and multiple alignment
Two lizard sequences from Anolis carolinensis were identified during similarity searches with high similarity to
UCP2 and UCP3. Homologues of UCP1 were not found
in the lizard scaffold genome. Table 1 outlines the
sequences (protein and DNA) used in the phylogenetic
analyses. It should be noted that additional UCP genes for
eutherians and teleosts were identified. Inclusion of these
did not improve the reliability of the phylogeny, and as
the aim of this study was to determine the evolutionary
history of the UCP gene family, only representatives from
the major vertebrate clades were included.
Phylogeny of the UCP gene family
The alignments were used to construct phylogenetic trees
with maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference
(BI). The different reconstruction methods provided poor
support for basal nodes using the protein alignment (Figure 1). The DNA alignment showed support for the UCP1,
UCP2 and UCP3 clades, in particular when fewer distantly
related outgroups are used perhaps as a consequence of
systematic error (Figure 2 and see additional material 1).
The different reconstruction methods provided slightly
different topologies. Most relationships could be resolved
with confidence dividing the gene family into strongly
supported clusters in most tree reconstructions. UCP2 and
UCP3 genes are sister clusters and the avian UCP gene is
grouped within the UCP3 cluster.

The 2 different protein trees were reconciled against a species tree using GeneTree. The protein ML topology
required 14 duplications and 47 losses and the BI 15
duplications and 51 losses. The high number of duplications and losses is a result of the basal topology of the
gene tree and a number of incongruences between the
gene and species trees. However, in the ML protein phylogenies, the basal relationships have low bootstrap supports. Using the DNA phylogeny, the ML tree required less
duplications and losses (8 d + 2 l) than the BI tree (12 d +
42 l). The higher number of duplications and losses in the
BI reconstruction is mainly a result of duplications
inferred through incongruence between the gene and species trees.

Phylogenetic relationships of proteins within the UCP family
Phylogenetic relationships of proteins within the UCP family. (A) Maximum likelihood method with bootstrap support (500 pseudo-replicates) above 50% shown at the nodes (likelihood of -7746.18) and (B) Bayesian inference with posterior
probability shown at the nodes (likelihood of -8900.97). All trees were rooted with the plant UCP proteins.

If as suggested by the protein phylogenies, the lamprey
sequences are sister to the UCP2 clade and the Takifugu
UCP3 groups within the same clade, then the reconciliation infers 3 duplications (excluding species specific
duplications) and 4 losses (excluding losses as a result of
incomplete data). However, the results from the DNA
phylogenies suggest the lamprey sequences could have
diverged before the duplication of UCP2/3. In this case,
by removing losses and duplications inferred through
mismatch of species and gene trees and losses due to
incomplete genome sequences, the most parsimoniously
reconciled tree shows 1 zebrafish specific duplication and
two major duplications that occurred early in the vertebrate lineage (Fig. 3). One duplication is proposed to have
occurred prior to the emergence of teleost fish resulting in
two lineages which evolved into UCP1 and UCP2/3 and
probably took place early in vertebrate evolution due to

the presence of UCP2 in lampreys, although further data
are required to confirm the presence of UCP1 and UCP3
in lampreys. A second duplication, also early in vertebrate
evolution, resulted in UCP2 and UCP3. Further sequencing of a broader range of ancestral craniata is required to
identify a more precise timing for the duplications. Interestingly, UCP2 and UCP1 have been independently lost
from the avian lineage but further data are required to
confirm the absence of UCP1 in lizards to be able to determine when the loss of UCP1 took place.
Synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rate
estimates
Results using the DNA dataset show that UCP genes are
under varying selection pressures (Table 2). Pairwise comparisons of human and mouse orthologs and human and
platypus show that UCP1 has higher estimates of dN/dS

ratio compared to UCP2 and UCP3 but suggest purifying
selection in all three genes. The lower substitution rates
for UCP2 and UCP3 shows that they are under strong
purifying selection.
Positive selection tests
More sophisticated codon-based substitution models
were used to test for branch-specific selection. The model
was based on the assumption that selective constraints
change following gene duplication. We estimated ω as an
average over all sites and branches and the ratio was substantially smaller than 1 (one ratio model ω = 0.07649,
Table 3). The one-ratio model was compared with model
R2, and the LRT (Table 4) indicated that there is a significant decrease in the rate of non-synonymous substitution
following the duplication of UCP1 and UCP2/3 (ω0 =
0.095 versus ω1 = 0.066). The comparison of model R2

and R3 also showed that there was a significant difference
in the selective pressure following the duplication of
UCP2 and UCP3. The branch specific model with three
distinct rates of substitution (R3), one for each UCP gene,
is a significantly better fit than the one-ratio (R0) and tworatio (R2) models according to the LRT (Table 4). This
suggests significantly different selective pressures on
UCP1, UCP2 and UCP3. However, none of the parameters estimated indicate positive Darwinian selection.
The LRT of the one ratio model with M3 indicates that
selective pressure is not uniform among sites (2δ =
919.98, d.f. = 4, p < 0.00001, Table 4). Only the M8
model indicates a site that is evolving under positive Darwinian selection (Table 3). LRTs (Table 4) indicate that
model M2 does not fit the data better than M1 whilst it
does show that M8 fits the data better than M7, which

illustrated using HMM logos [28] for each UCP gene, the
site under positive selection follows a highly conserved
(Y) amino acid site present across the whole UCP gene
family but the site under positive selection is not conserved within the different UCP groups (Fig 5). The HMM
logos also illustrate the high level of sequence conservation in the gene family.

UCP1 specified as the foreground branch, however the
M8 model was the best fit to the data with a likelihood
value of – 15233 (Table 3). This model suggests that the
variation in selection pressure is due to the evolution by
positive selection of a single site, whilst the remaining
sites are under strong purifying selection. According to the
alignment of the UCP sequences with the 3D structure of
the bovine mitochondrial ADP-ATP carrier (PDB id:

In this study, we have sought to expand upon previous
phylogenetic studies [10,15,26] by focusing on the UCP
gene families and incorporating sequences identified
from completed genomes with a subset of cloned
sequences, particularly those from non-mammalian species. This study is the first to include lizard UCP genes. The
phylogenetic tree reconstruction of DNA sequences gave
well resolved topologies with stronger support values for
basal relationships than using the protein data probably
as a result of the highly conserved protein sequences.
These phylogenies provided a method to infer the evolutionary history of the UCP gene family.
The phylogeny of the UCP genes indicates that UCP1,
which is present in plants and Arthropods, is the ancestral

UCP as demonstrated in previous studies [10,15,26].
UCP1 then duplicated prior to the divergence of vertebrates. A second duplication of UCP2 and UCP3 also took
place early in vertebrate evolution although the exact timing of the event (before or after the divergence of lampreys) requires further genomic data to be gathered. The
multiple sequences of UCPs found in the zebrafish, while
termed UCP4 and UCP3 are both UCP1 orthologs and
should be called UCP1a and UCP1b. UCP4 is syntenic to
Gene A and Gene B like other vertebrate UCP1 genes (Figure 3). This could either be a zebrafish specific duplication, or the incomplete sequencing of Cyprinus carpio
could be hiding an additional paralog and the duplication
may be a fish specific genome wide duplications hypothesised to have occurred during fish evolution [29,30]. The
latter is probably unlikely due to the lack of duplicates in
the complete genome of Takifugu rubripes. Importantly,
the phylogenetic analyses suggest the independent loss of
UCP1 and UCP2 from the avian lineage. The absence of
UCP1 in the lizard genome could be attributed to the
incompleteness of the genome or could be the result of a
loss of UCP1 in the sauropsid lineage.
UCP1 is the only uncoupling protein for which there is a
scientific consensus concerning the nature of its physiological function (thermogenesis, [31]). The UCP1 knockout mice are able to maintain their body temperature, but
suffer in pronounced cold exposure suggesting that UCP1
is principally involved in short-term adaptation to cold
(Enerback et al. 1997). This adaptive evolution probably
occurred after the divergence between eutherians and
marsupials [13] consistent with the fact that BAT is only
found in eutherians. Even though birds are lacking UCP1,
they are still able to respond to thermal challenges. The
loss of UCP1 and disappearance of BAT in birds is likely
due to the concomitant development of physiological
adaptations which have replaced BAT function. As evidence, metabolic rate of birds increases in response to
cold and body temperature can be maintained [32].
Indeed, induced uncoupling activity in the mitochondria

has been found in the skeletal muscle of cold-acclimated
birds [33,34] and more recently the implication of UCP3
(avianUCP) has been suggested [35]. These data lead to
two non exclusive conclusions. Firstly, birds have evolved
other mechanisms of thermoregulation [25] before or
after the loss of UCP1 and BAT (e.g.: futile cycle of Ca2+ in
bird skeletal muscle or greater adenine nucleotide translocase-catalysed proton conductance, [35,36]). Secondly, a
fully demonstrated implication of UCP3 (avianUCP) in
skeletal non-shivering thermogenesis in birds would suggest that UCP3, which is not involved in thermoregulation in mammals [21,37], has acquired a new function in
birds. In this case, the question is whether avianUCP activity could also compensate for the loss of the ucp2 gene,
implicated in mammalian immunity [20] and glucose
metabolism [22]. This is an interesting point given the
non pathologic high chronic glycemia of birds [38].
The molecular evolution of UCP genes showed that they
were under strong purifying selection with a significant
change towards stronger purifying selection. UCP1 has
the highest dN/dS ratio followed by UCP3 and then
UCP2. This strong purifying selection highlights the
importance of the function of this highly conserved gene
family. Although highly variable regions of the sequence
which were difficult to assign as homologous were
removed from the analyses, the site models showed that
adaptation has appeared at a single site located between
the 5th and 6th α-helices. The role of this positively selected
site has yet to be determined but the amino acid site (Y)
immediately prior to it is highly conserved across mitochondrial carriers as are the transmembrane regions that
follow the site. Additionally, Saito et al. [13] found that
the two amino acid sites that follow this site are conserved
in all eutherian mammal ucp1 genes. Based on studies
conducted on UCP1, the region delimited by the 5th and
6th α-helices is close to a site of regulation of UCP1 activity
by nucleotides and thus could be implicated in the inhibitory control of UCP1 uncoupling effect [15,26]. This
region is also hypothesized to be implicated in the mechanism of transport of protons/free fatty acids [39] in
UCP1. However, to date there is a gap in the knowledge of
the relationship between amino acid sequence and structure for UCP2 and UCP3, and we are unable to speculate
on the particular role of this region in these UCP1 homologues. Unfortunately, shared evolutionary history and
molecular selection alone cannot be used as the unique
criterion to infer protein function, and the true nature of
each UCP gene needs to be determined experimentally
and independently. Therefore, this positively selected site
may play an important functional role and could represent an interesting target site for future mutagenesis experiment thus facilitating our understanding of the structurefunction relationships in UCP genes.

Conclusion
Genomic data have provided an opportunity to gain a better understanding about the evolution of UCPs using phylogenetic analyses. The UCP gene family phylogeny shows
that two duplications took place early in the evolution of
vertebrates. Subsequent to these two duplications, UCP1
and UCP2 were lost from the avian lineage independ-

ently. However, further genome projects on a greater
diversity of evolutionary lineages are required to better
understand the gene-duplication history. Evolutionary
rate analysis shows purifying selection across branches
and sites (except for one single site with site specific positive selection) suggesting that the function of the genes in
the UCP gene family has been highly conserved after

duplication events and over evolutionary time. By considering the evolutionary history of the UCP gene family we
provide insight into which amino acid residues might
have undergone positive selection and could be targeted
for site-directed mutagenesis. However, the identification
of a single site under positive selection requires supporting evidence from further studies with better algorithms
for a more credible assessment of site-specific subfamily
divergence.

Methods
Sequences and sequence similarity searches
Amino acid and nucleotide sequences of UCP gene family
members were obtained from GenBank for most species
(see Table 1 for accession numbers). The sequences for the
lizard (Anolis carolinensis) were obtained from the February 2007 draft assembly (Broad Institute AnoCar (1.0))
produced by the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard [40].
A total of 50 sequences for 27 species were used in the
final analyses.

Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Fifty protein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [43]
and gaps, which are problematic in phylogenetic analysis,
were removed using Gblocks 0.91b [44]. The final protein
dataset was 274 amino acids long (Additional material 2).
Uncoupling proteins from plants, insects, the sea squirt
and the sea urchin were included. Nucleotide sequences
were aligned using ClustalX [41] with the default parameters followed by manual alignment in Macclade [42]
according to the amino acid translation. Regions before
the starting codon were excluded from the analysis as well
as regions poorly aligned due to uncertain homology
(positions from the first nucleotide of the start codon: 64–
66, 142–180, 331–375, 469–504, 931 to end). The final
dataset was 810 nucleotides long (Additional material 3).

Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using maximum
likelihood (ML) implemented in PHYML and Bayesian
inference (BI) in MrBayes. Phyml v2.4.4 [45] was used
with the online web server [46] for maximum likelihood
analysis using the GTR+I+G substitution DNA model
selected with ModelTest [47] and JTT substitution model

selected with ModelGenerator for the protein analyses
[48]. The robustness of the trees were assessed by bootstrapping (500 pseudoreplicates) with PHYML. Bayesian
analyses were conducted using the same model with
MrBayes v3.1.2 [49]. Node support was assessed as the
posterior probability from two independent runs each
with four chains of 200,000 generations (sampled at
intervals of 100 generations with a burn-in of 1000 trees).

Reconciliation of gene and species trees
Gene trees of the UCP gene family were reconciled with a
species tree using GeneTree [50]. GeneTree attempts to
resolve the incongruence between the gene and species
trees by predicting duplications and losses [50]. The species tree was based on the Tree of Life phylogeny [51] and
NCBI taxonomy [52]. The reconciled tree was edited to
remove losses and duplications inferred due to mismatches of the species and gene trees.
Estimation of substitution rates and testing positive
selection
Synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitution rates were estimated using the methods of Yang and
Nielson [53] as implemented in yn00 in the PAML software [54]. The two trees (ML and BI) were tested separately for positive selection. Using Codeml from PAML
the branch specific models, One-ratio (R1) and Tworatios (R2) were used to detect lineage-specific changes in
selective pressure after the duplication events. The site
specific models, Neutral (M1), Selection (M2), Discrete
(M3) with 3 site classes, Beta (M7) and Beta&ω (M8) were
also used to test for individual residues under positive
selection. Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were used to assess
their goodness of fit, by comparing a model that does
allow for dN/dS>1 against a model that does not (i.e. null
model). Therefore, the branch specific LRT was R2 vs R1.
The site specific LRTs were M3, M2 and M8 against their
respective null models, M0, M1 and M7. Positively
selected sites were listed. Because some of the models like
M2 and M8 are noted to be prone to the problem of multiple local optima, we ran the program twice, once with a
starting omega value <1 and a second time with a value
>1. We used the results corresponding to the highest likelihood.
