Prevalent de novo somatic mutations in
superantigen genes of mouse mammary tumor
viruses in the genome of C57BL/6J mice and its
potential implication in the immune system

Abstract
Background: Superantigens (SAgs) of mouse mammary tumor viruses (MMTVs) play a crucial role in T cell
selection in the thymus in a T cell receptor (TCR) Vb-specific manner and SAgs presented by B cells activate T cells
in the periphery. The peripheral T cell repertoire is dynamically shaped by the steady induction of T cell tolerance
against self antigens throughout the lifespan. We hypothesize that de novo somatic mutation of endogenous
MMTV SAgs contributes to the modulation of the peripheral T cell repertoire.
Results: SAg coding sequences were cloned from the genomic DNAs and/or cDNAs of various tissues of female
C57BL/6J mice. A total of 68 unique SAg sequences (54 translated sequences) were identified from the genomic
DNAs of liver, lungs, and bone marrow, which are presumed to harbor only three endogenous MMTV loci (Mtv-8,
Mtv-9, and Mtv-17). Similarly, 69 unique SAg sequences (58 translated sequences) were cloned from the cDNAs of
18 different tissues. Examination of putative TCR Vb specificity suggested that some of the SAg isoforms identified
in this study have Vb specificities different from the reference SAgs of Mtv-8, Mtv-9, or Mtv-17.
Conclusion: The pool of diverse SAg isoforms, generated by de novo somatic mutation, may play a role in the
shaping of the peripheral T cell repertoire including the autoimmune T cell population.

Background
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are known to make up
approximately 10 % of the mouse genome [1]. The available data suggest that the majority of the ERV population
in the genome of C57BL/6J harbor sequences similar to
murine leukemia viruses (MLVs). Limited copies of
endogenous mouse mammary tumor viruses (MMTVs)
are identified in the genome of almost all laboratory
mouse strains, including C57BL/6J with three genomic
loci of Mtv-8, Mtv-9, and Mtv-17 [2-4]. Although only
three loci of endogenous MMTVs (Mtv-8, Mtv-9, and
Mtv-17) are confirmed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, identification
of the Mtv-30 superantigen (SAg) sequence from C57BL/
6J mice has been reported [5]. Certain endogenous

MMTVs, such as Mtv-2, are known to be capable of producing infectious virus particles, predominantly in the
mammary gland, which are transmitted to the pups
through the milk [6-9].
Both endogenous and exogenous MMTVs encode SAgs
from an open reading frame residing on the 3’ long terminal repeat (LTR) [10,11]. MMTV SAgs, which are type II
membrane proteins presented in a major histocompatibility complex class II restricted manner, are capable of
activating a large fraction of T cells via interaction with
specific Vb region(s) of T cell receptors (TCRs) [11-13].
Individual MMTV SAg isoforms display differential TCR
Vb specificities. During thymic T cell development, endogenous MMTV SAgs are recognized as self-antigens
resulting in the clonal deletion of specific TCR Vb T cell
subsets [10,14-19]. In addition, presentation of MMTV
SAgs in the peripheral immune system leads to the activation of TCR Vb-specific T cell subsets followed by
anergy and cell death [20-22]. Presumably, SAgs from

exogenous MMTVs participate in the peripheral modulation of the T cell repertoire in a TCR Vb-specific manner. However, it may be reasonable to speculate that
altered forms of SAgs originating from endogenous
MMTVs will acquire different binding affinities for the
same Vb chain and/or new TCR Vb specificity. As a
result, they may contribute to the dynamic shaping of the
peripheral T cell repertoire by tolerance induction
throughout the lifespan of the animal. In addition, various types of stress signals (e.g., hormone) are likely to
increase the rate of MMTV SAg somatic mutation in
mice leading to an altered post-stress peripheral T cell
profile, which may then contribute to phenotypic variations in inbred laboratory animals.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a set of de
novo somatic mutations in the endogenous MMTV SAg
genes contribute to the dynamic shaping of the peripheral T cell repertoire by examining the presence of divergent SAg isoform profiles at the genome and expression
levels.

Results and Discussion
de novo somatic mutations in endogenous MMTV SAg
coding sequences

To examine the spectrum of de novo somatic mutation
events in the endogenous MMTV SAg coding sequences
in C57BL/6J mice, SAg sequences were PCR amplified
and cloned from the genomic DNAs isolated from the
liver, lungs, and bone marrow of normal mice. Liver and
lungs were selected to represent differentiated tissues
while bone marrow consists of both immature and
mature (e.g., antibody-producing plasma cells) immune
cells [23,24].
Alignment analyses of the SAg clones identified a
number of unique SAg coding sequences within each
tissue sample (nucleotide sequences/in silico translated
amino acid sequences; 20/17 from liver, 16/13 from
lungs, and 41/34 from bone marrow) (Figure 1). Some
SAg coding sequences (nucleotide) were shared by more
than one tissue and a total of 68 unique sequences were
identified. A range of point mutations were observed in
random loci throughout the SAg coding region. In some
cases, mutations in SAg isoforms introduced a premature stop codon. Phylogenetic evaluation of the unique
SAg coding sequences from all three tissues with the
reference SAg sequences from Mtv-8, Mtv-9, Mtv-17,
and Mtv-30 revealed a tree with a number of branching
units. As expected, three branching units with the SAg
reference sequences from Mtv-8, Mtv-9, and Mtv-17,
which are the three endogenous MMTVs of C57BL/6J
mice, had more SAg isoforms than the other branching
units. Interestingly, the SAg isoforms in one branching
unit were phylogenetically closer to the Mtv-30 SAg
reference rather than to the SAgs from Mtv-8, Mtv-9,

Page 2 of 10

and Mtv-17. Furthermore, a substantial number of SAg
clones formed unique branching units separate from any
of the reference SAgs. A different, but somewhat similar
branching pattern was observed within the phylogenetic
tree of the in silico translated sequences (amino acid) of
the SAg isoforms (Figure 1B).
The results presented in Figure 1 demonstrate that
there are a high number of MMTV SAg isoforms in the
genome of C57BL/6J mice, which had been previously
reported to harbor only three endogenous MMTV loci
(Mtv-8, Mtv-9, and Mtv-17) [2,4]. The presence of
numerous MMTV SAg isoforms might represent a heterogeneous mixture (related but divergent) of mutated
SAgs, derived from both endogenous and/or exogenous
MMTV genomes in conjunction with a relatively high
number of mutation events during the viral replication
process [25]. Although Mtv-8, Mtv-9, and Mtv-17 are
presumed to be inactive in replication, it is possible that
biologically active viruses can be derived from recombination with replicating exogenous MMTVs in conjunction with the generation of numerous mutations in
the SAg coding sequences [26]. For instance, a replication-competent recombinant MMTV provirus (5’ LTR,
gag and pol genes from a replicating Mtv-2 plus the env
gene and 3’ LTR from Mtv-17) has been reported in
GR mice [27]. It has been described that exogenous
MMTVs are able to infect and develop mammary
tumors in C57BL/6J mice [28]. Mutations from the
reverse transcription process of the retroviral RNA genome is reported to incur at an estimated rate of 0.05-1
mutation/genome/cycle. These de novo mutations from
replicating MMTVs may occur constantly throughout
the lifespan of the host. These findings provide some
evidence suggesting that MMTVs replicate and mutate
in C57BL/6J mice. Although the origins (endogenous
and/or exogenous) of the proviral copies identified in
this study are unknown, we noticed that three main
branching units were formed along with the SAg references from Mtv-8, Mtv-9, and Mtv-17. Furthermore, the
successful isolation and cloning of a number of SAg isoforms from genomic DNA suggests the integration of
proviral copies of these MMTV isoforms into the genome of certain host cells.
Expression of divergent MMTV SAg isoforms in various
tissues

The identification of a number of MMTV SAg isoforms
at the genomic level led us to investigate whether such a
variability of SAg isoforms is present at the expression/
transcription level and whether their mutation rates and
profiles are associated with differences in tissue type. The
SAg sequences were PCR cloned from cDNAs prepared
from 18 different tissues from normal C57BL/6J mice
(bone marrow, liver, lungs, kidney, salivary gland, adrenal

gland, ovary, uterus, spleen, thymus, mesenteric lymph
node, axillary lymph node, inguinal lymph node, small
intestine, colon, brain, skin, and stomach) and subjected
to alignment analyses to identify unique SAg coding
sequences within each tissue. Subsequently, phylogenetic
analyses of the SAg sequences from all 18 tissues
(95 sequences in total) were performed to examine the
distribution and similarities of the SAg cDNA isoforms
(Figure 2A). Six SAg cDNA sequences were shared by
more than one tissue type and a total of 69 unique SAg
isoforms were identified from this study. The total number of unique SAg cDNA coding sequences (69) was
similar to the number of unique genomic SAg coding
sequences (68). However, a direct comparison of the
number of unique SAg isoforms between these two
groups (genomic vs. cDNA) may not be feasible since the
cloning process was not normalized. Phylogenetic evaluation of the SAg cDNA isoforms with the same references
used for the analysis of genomic SAg sequences revealed
a unique tree pattern with a number of branching units
that was substantially different from the genomic SAg
tree (Figure 1A). A smaller number of SAg cDNA isoforms were present in the branching unit with the Mtv-8
SAg reference compared to the genomic SAg tree. In
contrast, the branching unit with the Mtv-9 SAg reference had a larger number of SAg cDNA isoforms than
the Mtv-9 branching unit in the genomic SAg tree. Similar to the genomic SAg tree, a few unique branching
units, which are distant from the reference SAgs (Mtv-8,
Mtv-9, Mtv-17, and Mtv-30), were formed in the SAg
cDNA tree. One interesting finding is that none of the
SAg cDNA isoforms isolated from the bone marrow were
present in the branching units formed with the reference
SAg of Mtv-8 or Mtv-17. The branching pattern of
the SAg tree using in silico translated amino acid
sequences resembled its nucleotide (cDNA) sequence
tree (Figure 2B). Fifty eight unique SAg isoforms (translated amino acids) were identified in different tissues and
a number of SAg cDNA isoforms share amino acid
sequences that are identical to the reference Mtv-8, -9
and -17 SAgs. The unique branching pattern of the SAg
cDNA isoforms (Figure 2) compared to the pattern from
the genomic SAg isoforms (Figure 1) indicate that the
expression of certain SAg isoforms is tissue type specific
in conjunction with a range of internal as well as external
stress signals. No significant differences in mutation
rates were observed between the hypervariable and nonhypervariable regions of the SAgs at both the genomic
DNA and cDNA levels.
Examination of putative TCR Vb specificity of SAg cDNA
isoforms isolated from various tissues

In this study, to determine whether changes in the
hypervariable C-terminus regions of the SAg isoforms,

Page 4 of 10

which are known to determine the TCR Vb specificity,
affect their superantigenic function, we examined the
putative TCR Vb specificity of the SAg cDNA isoforms
isolated from various tissues. Initially, unique C-terminus sequences (~74 amino acids) of individual SAg
cDNA isoforms were selected within each tissue, and a
total of 56 sequences were identified from all 18 tissues
(Figure 3A). A phylogenetic analysis of the 56 C-terminus sequences identified 17 unique hypervariable region
sequences (Figure 3B). Then, the 17 SAg C-terminus
sequences were subjected to alignment analyses to identify the regions responsible for determining their putative TCR Vb specificities (Figure 3C). The matching
C-terminus sequences of the Mtv-8, Mtv-9, Mtv-17, and
Mtv-30 SAgs and their reported TCR Vb specificities
were used as references [5,20,29,30]. Among the 17
unique C-terminus sequences, only four of them were
100 % homologous to the Mtv-8, Mtv-9, Mtv-17, or
Mtv-30 SAg (Figure 3C/D).
The C-terminal ~74 amino acid region has been used
as a reference for the classification of MMTV SAgs into
seven families in regard to their TCR Vb specificities
[20,31]. These C-terminus regions from different
MMTV SAgs are highly polymorphic. A region within
the C-terminus (amino acid positions 42-74; Figure 3C)
was determined to be important for TCR Vb specificity,
including binding affinity [32,33]. Among the 17 unique
SAg isoforms, 13 SAgs had non-synonymous point
mutations in this region in comparison to the reference
SAgs. However, little is known about the precise amino
acid position and/or composition responsible for TCR
Vb specificity in the C-terminal region. The MMTV
SAgs, whose sequences are almost identical, often display slightly different TCR Vb specificities due to differences in binding affinity and/or differences in expression
levels [30]. The results from this study indicate that the
majority of the SAg isoforms identified in this study display unique C-terminus region sequences and are different from the reference endogenous MMTV SAgs. This
finding may suggest that the TCR Vb specificity and
binding affinity of some of these SAg isoforms may be
altered, in part or full, due to changes in the interactions
of the hypervariable C-terminus domain with the TCR
Vb region. On the other hand, changes in certain amino
acids in the SAg C-terminus region may not affect TCR
Vb specificity at all [29]. It may be necessary to determine the TCR Vb specificity of each MMTV SAg isoform by an in vitro T-cell activation study.

NCBI mouse genome database and are schematically presented on a relative scale. The genes/genetic elements residing within regions

previously been mapped to this specific genomic region
[34]. A very limited number of annotated genes/genetic
elements were found in the region surrounding the
Mtv-9 locus on chromosome 12 (Figure 4B). Annotated
genes/genetic elements near the Mtv-8 locus on chromosome 6 of C57BL/6J genome are listed in Table 1.
It is documented that DNA sequences under the control of immunoglobulin gene promoters/enhancers are
subjected to somatic hypermutation, which is frequently
observed in the immunoglobulin variable gene segments
after antigenic stimulation for a positive and/or a negative selection of developed B cells [35,36]. Based on the
Mtv-8’s location in the variable region of Ig gene cluster, we can speculate that the Mtv-8 proviral sequence is
subjected to somatic hypermutations following antigenic
stimulation of B cells, which is reflected in certain Mtv8-derived SAg isoforms identified in this study. It will
be interesting to investigate whether the Mtv-8 loci in
other mouse strains, such as BALB/c and C3H, undergo

similar somatic hypermutation events in comparison to
the other Mtv loci, which are not embedded near the
immunoglobulin clusters. In addition, the finding that
the Mtv-8 provirus is integrated into the Ig variable
region suggests that it may be deleted from the genome
depending on the structure of the variable regions of
the individual chains during Ig gene rearrangement in
developing B cells. Thus, certain mature B cells may not
be able to express the Mtv-8 SAg and/or its isoforms.

Conclusions
It has been reported that a peripheral selection event
involving dynamic and persistent induction of T cell tolerance configures the peripheral T cell repertoire [37].
A range of factors, including an individual’s genetic profile and pathophysiologic status, may contribute to
the process of shaping the peripheral T cell repertoire.

expressed isoforms) may be directly linked to the differential as well as dynamic shaping of the peripheral
T cell repertoire in mice. On the other hand, incomplete
or failed induction of tolerance against the freshly
formed endogenous SAg isoforms may lead to local as
well as systemic accumulation of autoreactive T cell
populations.

SAg clones were isolated from individual experimental
groups and subjected to downstream analyses: 45 clones
from genomic DNA-normal bone marrow, 30 clones
from genomic DNA-normal lung, 23 clones from genomic DNA-normal liver, 23 clones from cDNA-normal
bone marrow, and 4~6 clones from cDNA-all normal
tissues except bone marrow.

Methods

Phylogenetic analysis of SAg sequences

Animal experiments

Phylogenetic analyses of the SAg coding sequences and
translated sequences (both full-length and 74 amino
acids of C-terminus hypervariable region) were performed using the neighbor-joining method within the
MEGA4 program [40,41]. Bootstrapping was performed
with 100 replications to evaluate the statistical confidence of branching patterns.

Female C57BL/6J mice from the Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, ME) were housed according to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. The Animal
Use and Care Administrative Advisory Committee of
the University of California, Davis, approved the experimental protocol. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation followed by tissue collection.

Evaluation of putative TCR Vb specificity of SAg isoforms
Cloning of SAg coding sequences from genomic DNAs
and cDNAs

Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed based on the protocols described previously
[38]. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from the tissues
using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA
(100 ng) samples were subjected to reverse transcription
using Sensiscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen). The
sequence of the oligo-dT primer was as follows: 5’-GGC
CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT ACT TTT TTT TTT TTT
TTT T-3’. The genomic DNAs from bone marrow, liver,
and lung tissues of normal mice were prepared using a
DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen). A set of primers, MTV-1B
(forward: 5’-TGC CGC GCC TGC AGC AGA AAT
G-3’) and MTV-2A (reverse: 5’-TGT TAG GAC TGT
TGC AAG TTT ACT C-3’), was used to amplify the
MMTV SAg region from the cDNA of normal tissues
[39]. PCR using these primers was performed with the
following conditions: hot start of 3 minutes at 94°C and
33 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 1 minute, and
72°C for 1 minute. Another set of primers, 5’-SAg (forward: 5’-CGG AAT TCC GAA AGG GGA AAT GCC
GCG CCT-3’) and 3’-SAg (reverse: 5-GAC GGC GGC
CGC CCG CAA GGT TGG GCT CAT AA-3’), was
used to amplify the SAg region from the genomic DNA
of normal tissues. The following PCR condition was
applied with these primers: hot start of 3 minutes at
94°C and 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 50°C for
1 minute, and 72°C for 1 minute.
PCR products of the MMTV SAg regions were cloned
into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI).
Sequencing was performed at the Molecular Cloning
Laboratory (South San Francisco, CA). Sequences were
trimmed for the SAg coding sequence before alignment
and open reading frame (ORF) analyses using the Lasergene program (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The following

The C-terminus hypervariable regions (~74 amino acids)
of the individual SAg isoforms were compared with the
same regions of the reference SAg sequences of which
TCR Vb specificities were previously defined using the
Lasergene program (DNASTAR) [5,11,20,42,43]. The
percentage similarity of the C-terminus regions of the
SAg isoforms to the references was calculated.
Mapping of MMTV proviruses and their neighboring
genes/genetic elements

Endogenous MMTV proviruses residing on the genome
of C57BL/6J mice were mapped by a BLAST search of
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) database using the SAg sequences of Mtv-8,
Mtv-9, and Mtv-17 as probes [31,44]. In addition, the
genes/genetic elements neighboring the individual proviral loci were mapped by surveying the genomic region
within 1 Mb upstream and downstream regions using
both the Ensembl and NCBI genome databases.
