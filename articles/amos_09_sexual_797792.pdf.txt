Abstract
Background: Moller and Cuervo report a significant trend between minisatellite mutation rate
and the frequency of extra-pair copulations in birds. This is interpreted as evidence that the high
rate of evolution demanded by sexual selection has itself selected for a higher mutation rate in
species where selection is strongest. However, there are good a priori reasons for believing that
their method of calculating minisatellite mutation rates will be highly error prone and a poor
surrogate measure of the evolutionary rate of genes. I therefore attempted to replicate their
results using both their data and an independent data set based on papers they failed to locate.
Results: I find that Moller and Cuervo's data set contains numerous errors that act somewhat to
strengthen their key regression. More importantly, data from uncited papers fail to replicate their
reported trend and one species in particular, Vireo olivaceus, is apparently deliberately omitted,
yet its inclusion removes significance from the original correlation. Over the small number of cases
were comparisons can be made, mutation rate estimates do not differ between species but do vary
significantly depending on the laboratory/operator.
Conclusion: There appears to be no clear relationship between minisatellite mutation rate and
EPC rate in birds. The previously reported trend can be attributed to data transcription errors and
unfortunate data selection. My analysis highlights the importance of total methodological
transparency when conducting meta-analyses.

Introduction
Møller and Cuervo recently published an analysis of literature-based data purporting to show a positive relationship between the rate of extra pair paternity (EPP), a
surrogate measure of sexual selection, and minisatellite
mutation rate, a possible indicator of the genome-wide
mutation rate [1]. Their intriguing idea is that sexually
selected species need to evolve fast and have been selected
for elevated mutation rates to facilitate this. If true, this
would indeed be an important finding. However, the
regression on which their main conclusion is based looks
weak. Moreover, the estimation of minisatellite mutation
rates, as described, embraces a wide range of sources of

error that together make it unlikely to be accurate enough
to detect even medium to strong trends.
Møller and Cuervo estimate minisatellite mutation rate
using classical DNA fingerprint data from confirmed
mother-father-offspring trios [1]. When the fingerprint
profiles of a confirmed family are examined, bands are
occasionally seen in an offspring that occur in neither parent [2]. Such bands are expected because the high mutation rate of minisatellites [3] combined with the number
of bands surveyed in a DNA fingerprint means that
mutated alleles are likely to be found with some regularity
[2]. However, unassigned bands can also represent arte-

facts [4] such as refractory restriction enzyme cutting sites.
Given that N novel fragments are observed in M verified
mother-father-offspring trios, the mutation rate is then
calculated as N/(M.B), where B is the average number of
bands scored per individual. The result is an average
mutation rate per band per generation. Unfortunately,
minisatellite mutation rates vary over three or four orders
of magnitude, from 0.15 per generation [5] or more down
to 10-3, 10-4 or less [6,7]. Truly hypervariable loci appear
to be rare, at least in humans [6,8]. Consequently, most
mutations will derive from one or a few of the most variable loci, and studies that score more bands will tend
report lower mutation rates. With average band counts
varying between 10 and over 50, this could easily create a
5-fold variation in perceived mutation rate that is unrelated to the actual mutability of the minisatellites themselves.
A second source of error is the variation in resolution
between experiments and between studies. Published figures depicting gels, most of which will be the best-looking
available to the author, vary in quality between studies
from beautiful ladders of razor-sharp bands to series of
indistinct blobs. This will impact both on the number of
bands scored, and on the number of mutations identified.
A key issue is that most minisatellite mutations involve
small changes in fragment length, of the order of 50 bp or
less [9-11], with an exponential fall-off in frequency with
increasing numbers of repeat units that are lost or gained.
For this reason, gel resolution will have a disproportionately big impact on measured mutation rate, with poor
resolution gels picking up a small fraction of those
resolved by the best gels. Although this effect tends to mitigate the impact of band number, from the perspective of
measuring mutation rate it is an independent source of
error that will further reduce the accuracy of this
approach.
Given these problems with estimating mutation rate and
the clear importance of this finding should it be correct, I
decided to revisit Møller and Cuervo's original data to
look for alternative explanations for the trend they report.

Methods and results
With the exception of two PhD theses, I downloaded and
re-extracted the data from all 92 references cited as source
material in Møller and Cuervo's 'Supplementary material'.
Hereafter, these papers are referred to by their original
numbers, as they appear in table one of Møller and
Cuervo's Supplementary material, prefixed by 'MC references'. When transcribing data that are largely embedded
in text rather than table, it is easy to make errors. Consequently, I extracted all the required numbers twice, blind
and cross-checked and corrected any discrepancies. In six
papers (MC references 1, 24, 25, 46, 57 and 85), despite
several careful readings of the paper, I failed to find data

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/5

from which a mutation rate could be calculated. However,
MC references 24 and 25 were redundant and I was able
to substitute alternative papers by the same authors for
MC references 1 (my reference [12]), 46 (my reference
[13]) and 57 (my references [14,15]). For MC reference 85
I was unable to find any usable data and was forced to use
their value. In some cases the meaning of the EPC rate
value was unclear because the rate variously was the subject of experimental manipulation [16], varied with male
age [17], varied between populations [18,19] or because
the social organisation involved multi-male territories
[20-22]. I ignored this variation.
Data transcription accuracy
To examine the accuracy of data transcription I downloaded Møller and Cuervo's data from their Supplementary material table one and used it to replot their figure 2.
There is noticeably poor agreement between the two
graphs, illustrated by superimposing the two graphs (Figure 1a). To determine which set of values, if either, is correct, I next compared Møller and Cuervo's data with those
I extracted from the same sources. Where data were not
easily accessible (two PhD theses), not available (MC reference 85) or a complicated experimental design made it
unclear how to calculate a meaningful value (MC reference 87) I used the same values as Møller and Cuervo.
Superimposing my graph on Møller and Cuervo's figure 2
(Figure 1b) an even larger number of discrepancies are
noticeable.

It is possible that Møller and Cuervo's figure 2 is based on
an earlier, error prone version but that their Supplementary material is reasonably accurate. To test this I plotted
my mutation rate values against those given in their Supplementary material (Figure 2). Some slight scatter is
expected because about 10–15% of values had to be read
from graphs and in some cases several alternative values
could be calculated. For example, several papers give separate values of mean band counts for mothers, fathers and
offspring separately. I chose to use the value for 'offspring', but one could argue either for taking the average
of the two parents, or of all three values. However, appreciable numbers of points differ by more than can be
accounted for in this way and there are also several large
discrepancies. The reason for these discrepancies is
unclear. For example, the lead author's own paper on
swallows [23] states that 10 unattributable bands were
found among 5271 scored (page 355, 'DNA fingerprinting'), giving a mutation rate of 10/5271 = 0.0019, yet the
figure that appears in MC Supplementary material table
one is 0.0026.
To explore the impact of the discrepancies I have identified on the key regression of mutation rate against EPC
rate, I attempted to repeat exactly the regression performed in the original paper. For this, I followed their

methods and transformed mutation rate data by taking
the log of X + 0.001, while EPC rates were square root –
arcsine transformed [1]. To control for phylogenetic nonindependence, Møller and Cuervo use the program 'CONTINUOUS' [24,25]. I translated their phylogeny (their figure 1) into a Nexus format tree and used it in the program
BayesTraits (available at http://www.evolution.rdg.ac.uk),
which now incorporates the 'CONTINUOUS' program as
an option. This program is used to calculate the likelihood
of a null model, in which two traits are independent, with
a model in which the two traits are correlated across, but
not because of, the phylogeny. Using data from Møller
and Cuervo's Supplementary material I was able, more or
less, to replicate their reported p-value, calculated as -2 ×
(the difference in likelihoods between the two models)
and interpreted as a Chi-squared value with 1 degree of
freedom (my value, p = 0.01; their value, p = 0.013).
Using the mutation rate data I extracted, the level of significance is reduced somewhat (Chi-squared = 5.69, 1 d.f.,
p = 0.017). Transcribed EPC rates show much greater consistency between my values and theirs, and impact little
on the regression.
Species selection
Møller and Cuervo do not say how they determined
which species to use and which to omit, but one omission

is particularly puzzling. Data from two different species
occasionally appear in the same paper and in most cases
both mutation rates are used (e.g. MC references 6 and
54). However, in one case data from two congeneric species, Vireo solitarius and Vireo olivaceus, occur alongside
each other in the same paper [26], yet only data from V.
solitarius are included in the regression. Both species are
highly relevant because, despite being close relatives, one
has very high rates of EPPs and the other very low. To
examine the impact of this omission I added V. olivaceus
to the main dataset (Figure 1a) and repeated the regression, again using BayesTraits and the same data transformations. Despite being only a single datapoint in almost
80 species, for Mølller and Cuervo's data, significance is
reduced to borderline levels (Chi-squared = 3.955, 1 d.f.,
p = 0.0467). When the mutation rate values I extracted are
used, the regression weakens further and becomes nonsignificant (Chi-squared = 3.335, 1 d.f., p = 0.068). Omission of this species is perhaps justifiable, given that the
mutation rate is based on a single non-EPP chick, but if so,
it needs to be explicitly justified.
In view of the borderline significance that results by adding one extra species and the number of papers I was finding that were not included by Møller and Cuervo, I
decided to see whether the papers not used by Møller and
Cuervo reveal a similar trend. To make my search repeatable and transparent (though not exhaustive) I used the
terms 'fingerprint*' and 'extra-pair'/'extrapair' entered in
the 'Web of Knowledge' ISI search engine http://
wok.mimas.ac.uk/. These terms returned a high proportion of all papers used by Møller and Cuervo, but also data
for 46 further species not used in the original study (two
papers that were not available electronically to Cambridge
University members were ignored). I therefore constructed a phylogenetic tree, based on Møller and
Cuervo's figure 1 plus a published phylogeny of the passerines (Figure 3) [27]. Since it is unclear how best to combine genetic distances across studies with vastly differing
methodologies, I calculated a unit ultrametric tree (adjacent nodes separated by unit distance), with branch order
determined by adding species to the reference phylogenies
according to the position of their own or their most
related genus. Using these data (see Figure 4, for full dataset see Additional File 1) and the same data transformations described above, BayesTraits revealed a nonsignificant correlation between minisatellite mutation
rate and EPP frequency (Chi-squared = 0.32, 1 d.f., p =
0.57).
Repeatability of minisatellite mutation rate estimates
Across the many source papers, mutation rate estimates
are determined by many different operators working in
different laboratories and using a wide range of protocols
(including different restriction enzymes to cut the
genomic DNA, different minisatellite probes to detect the

banding profiles and different size ranges in which to
score bands). For the Møller and Cuervo analysis to work,
variation due to operator and methodology must be small
relative to the actual variation in mutation rate between
species. Møller and Cuervo present a number of tests to
reassure the reader that this is so. They state that minisatellite mutation rate measurements show 'significant
repeatability' among populations of the same species and
for probes applied to the same population, and that mutation rate did not vary between different probes or
enzymes. Their exact approach is not described beyond
referring to Falconer and Mackay (see page 136) [28].
In practice, repeatability appears rather low. Thus, multiple measurements from the same species often vary by up
to an order of magnitude or more (Branta leucopsis, range
0.0008 to 0.014; Delichon urbica, range 0.0015 to 0.0079;
Parus major, range 0.00057 to 0.008; Passer domesticus,
range 0.00059 to 0.0068; Tachycineta bicolour, range
0.0045 to 0.041; Wilsonia citrina, range 0.0014 to 0.0155),
about the same range seen across all species (maximum
value = 0.024, minimum value set for log transformation
= 0.001). Moreover, there are very few data on which a
valid test of repeatability can be conducted: there are only
four cases of direct comparability between laboratories
(i.e. studies by different laboratories using the same species, enzyme and probe: MC references 4 v 5, 79 v 80, 81
v 82 and 91 v 92) and only two direct comparisons
between species (different species studied by the same
operator, enzyme and probe: MC references 21 v 22 and
88 v 91). Three further papers report data for two species
side-by-side, but in each case the species are closely related
(MC references 6, 51 and 54), undermining the validity of
any comparison.

To obtain adequate sample sizes for tests of repeatability
it is necessary to assume that differences between probes
and enzymes are small enough to be ignored (this is probably not valid, see below). Doing this, I find 11 instances
where the same first author has studied at least two distantly related species, revealing significant differences
between authors (ANOVA, F[10,12] = 4.34, p = 0.009), with
author explaining 5.5% of the total variation. I also found
nine species that were genotyped by different laboratories
(Agelaius phoeniceus, Branta leucopsis, Delichon urbica,
Ficedula hypoleuca, Parus caerulescens, Parus major, Progne
subis, Sturnus vulgaris and Tachycineta bicolour) but mutation rates did not vary significantly among these species
(ANOVA, F[8,13] = 2.015, p = 0.126). Thus inter-laboratory
variation appears larger than differences between species.
Møller and Cuervo also claim that mutation rate estimates
do not vary with enzyme or probe [1]. Again, the precise
test used is not revealed, but, for example, it is stated that
use of restriction enzyme Alu I does not differ from the use
of other enzymes, the test being cited as "(F = 0.04, d.f. =
1,60, p = 0.83)". This implies a regression based on 62
paired mutation estimates for Alu I and one or more other
enzymes. However, I can find only 23 studies that use Alu
I and of these only two give separate mutation rates for
Alu I and another enzyme (one of these states that the two
rates are not independent because of extensive band overlap). For enzyme Hae III a similar test is reported with an
identical number of degrees of freedom (1,60), even
though many more studies, 52, use this enzyme. The only
way I can see to reconcile the quoted degrees of freedom
with the data available would be if a two-sample t-test
(presented as an ANOVA) had been conducted to test the
null hypothesis that average mutation rate for the two different enzymes does not differ between studies, but this
would be (obviously) pointless because it fails to control
for variation due to 'species', 'operator' or 'probe', all of
which will conflate to increase the error variance.

Discussion
Møller and Cuervo present an intriguing analysis purporting to show a link between sperm competition, as indicated by EPP rate, and minisatellite mutation rate [1].
Reanalysing the raw data I find numerous errors in the
transcription of mutation rate data from the original
paper. The outcome of the key regression depends critically on the omission of one highly influential data point.
Including this species removes significance from the
regression. Analysis of equivalent data extracted from a
second, independent set of papers fails to reveal any trend.
I also failed to replicate their claimed repeatability among
species, instead finding that the most important source of
variation is attributable to differences among laboratories/operators not to differences between species.

The idea of using putative mutations identified in parentage studies conducted using DNA fingerprinting as a surrogate measure of genome-wide mutation rate that can in
turn be linked to ecological variables is ingenious. However, the data derive from many different laboratories,
using different methods to study different species, and it
is therefore vital to show that a significant proportion of
the variation in estimated mutation rate is due to differences between species rather than between operators or
methods. Møller and Cuervo claim to show this by reporting a series of tests of repeatability, but their quoted
degrees of freedom are difficult to reconcile with the
actual (tiny) number of valid comparisons that can be
made. When I tried to conduct similar tests I was forced to
ignore differences in methodology in order to find
enough comparisons among species genotyped by the
same laboratory and laboratories that had genotyped
multiple species. In contrast to their reported 'significant
repeatability' among populations of the same species, the
only significant differences I find are, as expected, among
operators.
In an attempt to replicate their repeatability analysis, I was
forced to assume that the use of different probes and different enzymes makes little difference to the mutation rate
estimate, but this assumption is probably false. Several
studies report significant differences in band-sharing and/
or band number between probes or enzymes tested on the
same species (e.g. [29]). Band-sharing tends to reflect
mutation rate (higher mutation rates drive higher diversity and hence lower band-sharing) while band number
will influence the mutation rate calculation (see above).
Consequently, significant variation in either of these
within a species implies strongly that choice of probe/
enzyme will influence the resulting mutation rate estimate. In my own work I have observed massive differences in band-sharing between difference probes used on
the same species, implying equivalently large differences
the underlying mutation rate (pers. obs.). Among the bird
studies, some workers have used microsatellite probes
such as (GATA)n rather than true minisatellite probes [30].
Here again a large difference in mutation rate is expected
because maximum tetranucleotide repeat mutation rates
are of the order of 10 fold lower than those of minisatellites. Again, one would expect probe choice to influence
the mutation rate reported.
Putting aside the question of whether sufficient signal
exists to be detected, I also failed to replicate Møller and
Cuervo's regression of minisatellite mutation rate on EPC
rate. There appear to be at least two important reasons for
this. First, the data presented in Møller and Cuervo's Supplementary material, while apparently being those used in
their calculations, fail to match either their own figure 2
or, more importantly, the data I extracted and double-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/5

checked from the same source papers. Although most of
the differences are small, the net effect of these inaccuracies is to strengthen the reported relationship. Second, a
much larger impact can be attributed to the species that
were selected for inclusion. Møller and Cuervo's rationale
for including or excluding data is opaque, and a parallel
set of data culled from papers they omitted but that were
published during the same time period reveals no tend
whatsoever. Worryingly, the reported correlation depends
critically on the omission of data for one particular species, Vireo olivaceus. Inclusion of this species causes Møller
and Cuervo's regression to become borderline, whilst
when added to the data I extracted from the same sources,
the regression becomes no longer significant. Møller and
Cuervo do not explain why this (or other) species were
omitted, even though V. olivaceus could reasonably be
excluded due to small sample size, but this nonetheless
emphasises the need for complete transparency.
Some thought should also be given to possible artefacts
associated with sample sizes and EPP assignment. For
example, sample size of offspring varies among the studies from fewer than ten up to almost 1000. In the smallest
studies, the chance of finding a low EPP rate together with
no mutant bands could be much enhanced. Similarly,
Møller and Cuervo assert that the combined use of band
mismatches and band-sharing coefficients makes the
identification of true offspring (and hence mutant bands)
versus EPPs unambiguous. While this is true in many
studies, there are some cases where no clear discontinuity
is seen (e.g. [31,32]). Such studies will tend to report both
high rates of EPPs and high mutation rates, creating outlier points with high leverage on the regression.
Finally, even ignoring the problems I have uncovered, two
of the original premises appear fundamentally flawed.
First, it is unclear why the mutation rate of the fastest
evolving minisatellites should reflect the mutation rate of
genes involved with sexual selection. Minisatellites evolve
through a complicated process probably involving gene
conversion like events that act either to delete repeat units
or to copy blocks from one chromatid to the other [11].
This process has little if anything to do with the mechanisms responsible for the point mutations that are likely
to be responsible for variation in genes associated with
sexually selected traits. Consequently, even if selection is
acting to increase the mutation rate of sexually selected
genes, it seems unlikely to impact on minisatellite mutation rates; molecularly, the two process have too little in
common. Second, there is the question of timescale. Point
mutations typically occur at a rate of ~10-9 per generation
per site or ~10-6 per generation per gene. If one assumes a
generation length of three to five years for an 'average'
bird, this implies changes occurring over a timescale of the
order of five million years. In contrast, EPP rates can vary

Page 7 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:5

greatly between congeneric species and even among seasons and populations within a species [33], implying a
timescale that might be faster by a factor of ten or more.
Thus, while strong selection for evolutionary change
might conceivably drive selection for increased genomic
mutation rate, any resultant effect would probably affect
larger clades rather than species, and is unlikely to correlate with the mechanistically unrelated minisatellite
mutation rate.

Conclusion
In conclusion, there are strong grounds for believing that
minisatellite mutation rates estimated across diverse laboratories from occasional non-parental bands in DNA fingerprints will be highly variable and probably unrelated
to point mutations, making them largely unsuitable as
surrogate estimators of the genome-wide mutation rate.
Reanalysing one study that attempts to use them in this
way I find that the reported regression appears to be spurious and driven largely by data selection and data transcription errors. This analysis highlights the importance of
transparency in meta-analyses, both in how data are
selected and how the statistical tests were conducted.
Accurate transcription of data is a seldom-checked but
critical requisite!

Introduction
Our current understanding of the factors accounting for
interspecific differences in mutation rates is at best poor
[34]. We made a first attempt to address this lacuna by
assembling a data base on mutation rates of minisatellites
in different species of birds, produced as a result of a
recent surge in studies investigating the evolution of extrapair paternity [1]. The hypothesis tested was that sex differences in cell divisions could cause sex differences in
mutation rates, and such sex differences should be more
common in species with more intense sperm competition

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/5

(see review of literature and justification for assumptions
in [1]).
Amos [this article] suggested that we made numerous
transcription errors from the original sources, omitted key
species, and selectively included species that supported
our hypothesis. We contest these assertions strongly and
later explain in detail how they arose. We also provide a
comprehensive data base with all our data, and we show
that our previous conclusion remains even when increasing sample size from 77 to 132 species due to recently
published data that have become available after we finished our first study, and when controlling for a number
of novel, potentially confounding variables.
How to estimate mutation rates
We were puzzled to learn that Amos [this article] had
apparently not read or understood how we had estimated
mutation rates, when we in fact described our procedures
extensively [[1], p. 3, first column]. Given that Amos did
not adopt the procedure that we used for estimating mutation rates, and given that he did not refute it on logical or
other grounds, it is unsurprising that he finds extensive
discrepancies between mutation rate estimates in the original papers and the rates that we reported. This does not
justify claims about transcription errors or selective inclusion, but instead highlights the importance of reading
papers before criticizing them.

Since Amos [this article] apparently cannot understand
our explicit descriptions [[1], p. 3], we have no other
choice than repeating ourselves. Whenever possible we
estimated mutation rates directly from data in the original
publications by extracting information on the distribution of novel bands that could not be attributed to extrapair paternity directly from the text or figures. We also
extracted information on the total number of bands
scored and the number of individuals used for these analyses. However, as we explicitly stated in Møller & Cuervo
[[1], p. 3], we should not include all individuals in such
estimates because offspring caused by extra-pair parentage
((male attending a nest is not the father) and extra-pair
maternity (female attending a nest is not the mother) and
intraspecific nest parasitism (neither male nor female
attending a nest are parents)) will bias mutation rate estimates. We explicitly provided two examples in Møller &
Cuervo [[1], p. 3], but we restrict this repeated explanation
to the first of our examples. This first example concerns
the indigo bunting Passerina cyanea for which Westneat
[35] analyzed extra-pair paternity of 63 young of which 22
were extra-pair offspring. He found that 28 nestlings had
0 novel bands, 10 had 1 novel band, and 3 had 2 novel
bands, in total 16 novel bands in 41 nestlings. Westneat
[35] scored on average 37.5 bands or 41 young × 37.5
bands/young = 1537.5 bands in total. The mutation rate

Page 8 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:5

is therefore 16/1537.5 = 0.010407. However, many
papers also included extra-pair offspring in their reported
estimates of mutation rates. If we had done so, we would
have had 63 young × 37.5 bands/young = 2362.5 bands
in total. That would have given a mutation rate estimate
of 16/2362.5 = 0.006772, or a reduction in mutation rate
estimate by 35%. We justified clearly why extra-pair offspring should be excluded from such estimates because
extra-pair offspring have many novel bands (in the example with the indigo bunting on average 8.2 novel bands).
We stated explicitly in Møller & Cuervo [[1], p. 3] and we
re-iterate here that "The latter precaution was taken since
a single or a few novel band(s) in an individual due to
mutation cannot readily be distinguished among a large
number of novel bands due to extra-pair paternity". Thus
'hidden' mutational bands in extra-pair offspring will
cause a bias in mutation rate estimates, and, therefore,
they have to be excluded. Here we now report the frequency distribution of novel bands, the mean number of
bands scored per individual and the number of individuals used for estimating mutation rates in Additional file 2,
allowing readers to assess all the data and confirm our
estimates.
Finally, we note that some of the estimates of mutation
rates reported in the original publications were at conflict
with what could be estimated using the number of novel
bands, the mean number of bands scored and the number
of individuals, and also in these cases have we used our
own estimate rather than what was reported in the paper.
Transcription of data
Amos [this article] suggested that we made extensive transcription errors of mutation rates. We have already
explained above why Amos [this article] did not find consistency between our estimates and what was reported in
the original publications. He also explicitly stated that the
mutation rate estimate that we reported from Gibbs et al.
[36] could not be found in the paper. Opening the pdf file
of Gibbs et al. [36] with Acrobat reader allows anybody to
search for 'mutation' and find the estimate of 0.018 on p.
368!

We do not have access to Amos' complete data set,
because he chose not to publish it, although we assume
that this is the data in his Additional file 2 combined with
the data that we reported as corrected by him, but
adjusted for what he terms 'our transcription errors'. However, we cannot know if that is the case because this is
never stated explicitly. We have copied the data listed in
Additional file 2 in Amos [this article] and compared
these values with what is reported in the original publications from which these data are claimed to have been
extracted. We have found numerous errors. These range
from the more mundane spelling errors in 9% of the species names (Actitis hypoleucos, Carduelis tristis, Panurus biar-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/5

micus, Thryothorus ludovicianus) to a difference in sample
size of almost 1,000 for Anthus spinoletta. In addition,
there are numerous errors in the frequency of extra-pair
paternity, mutation rate, sample size and number of
bands scored as reported in his Additional file 2. We
report his data together with the data from the original
publications in our Additional file 3 to allow readers to
visualize these discrepancies. We suggest that someone
who corrects others should be particularly careful not to
make errors himself.
Data selection criteria
Meta-analyses are strongly influenced by the data sets on
which they are based, and it is always good scientific practice to report the data selection criteria adopted, but also
to use multiple sources for accessing all available data [3739]. We used all estimates of minisatellite mutation rates
known to us in our first publication [1], and we would
like to emphasize that one of us (APM) has kept an extensive list of all published studies of extra-pair paternity in
birds since 1988, used for extensive analyses of the function of sperm competition [40,41]. We have never deliberately excluded any data, nor did we exclude Vireo
olivaceus, contrary to what was suggested by Amos [this
article]. Close scrutiny of the original publication [26] for
this species revealed that although the estimate of extrapair paternity was based on 19 nestlings, in fact only 8
nestlings had information on minisatellite bands for both
parents. Among these 8 nestlings, no fewer than 7 were
extra-pair offspring, leaving one single nestling for scoring
mutational bands. Inclusion of an estimate of mutation
based on a sample size of one should be clearly inadequate to anybody including Amos!

As a measure of the completeness of the entire data base
we would like to emphasize that we have identified 15
publications that were not in our original data set nor in
the data set reported by Amos [this article]. These papers
are listed in our Additional file 2. As a second measure of
completeness, we have kept a record of 48 manuscripts on
extra-pair paternity that APM has refereed. Only one of
these remains unpublished to date, suggesting that there
is very little scope for any effects of publication bias in the
analyses, contrary to what is commonly the case in metaanalyses [37-39].
New analyses
Here we re-analyze the relationship between mutation
rate and extra-pair paternity using the previously
described procedures from Møller & Cuervo [1] and an
extensive data set based on 132 species. In addition, we
include five potentially confounding variables in the analyses. First, estimates based on large sample sizes will be
more reliable than estimates based on small sample sizes,
because the variance in estimates for small samples is
greater than for large samples. Such patterns of decrease in
Page 9 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:5

sample variance with increasing sample size are ubiquitous in meta-analyses [37-39], and that is the main reason
for including sample size as a confounding factor in the
analyses. Thus it is not surprising that the variance also
decreases with sample size in the present data for both
mutation rates and extra-pair paternity. However, there is
no reason to expect, as did Amos [this article], that estimates of extra-pair paternity and mutation rates will be
inherently small and hence under-estimated at small sample sizes, because they will simply only be more variable.
Hence, there is good reason to control for sampling effort.
Second, the mean number of bands scored varied among
studies, and a larger number of bands may suggest a
greater level of precision and hence a greater probability
of detecting novel bands. Third, as we have argued previously [1], and also in the present study, correction of
mutation rate estimates for extra-pair paternity may
reduce bias because novel bands due to mutation 'hidden'
among bands due to extra-pair parentage will not contribute to estimates. Therefore, we included this variable as a
factor (with studies where we extracted the information
on mutation rate directly from the publication being
scored as 0, and studies where we estimated mutation rate
after exclusion of extra-pair parentage were scored as 1) in
the analyses because we could not correct all mutation
rate estimates due to missing values. Fourth, while we
originally analyzed minisatellite mutations, Amos [this
article] also included other molecular markers in the analyses. Hence, we included a factor that coded markers as
minisatellites or other markers. Fifth, as we have already
emphasized [1], molecular labs may differ in their procedures causing systematic differences in estimates of mutation rates among studies, and Amos [1] also suggested
that there was a lab effect on estimates. Thus we included
molecular lab as a factor in the analyses. Sixth, mutation
rate estimates may depend on the number of bands scored
if a larger number of bands imply a greater level of precision. Data for all these variables are provided in our Additional file 2 to allow readers to replicate our results and
make further analyses. If more than one mutation rate and
extra-pair paternity estimate was available for a species,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/5

we used mean estimates weighted by sample size for the
analyses.
The best-fit model relating extra-pair paternity to mutation rate including no potentially confounding variable
explained 5.1% of the total variance (Table 1A). A model
weighted by the square-root of sample size minus three
(the standard error, [25]) did not provide a better fit
(Table 1B). The relationship between mutation rate and
extra-pair paternity is shown in Fig 1 (see additional file
4). There was no significant additional effect of whether or
not we extracted the mutation rate from the publication (F
= 0.33, d.f. = 1,129, P = 0.57), whether the molecular
marker was a minisatellite or not (F = 0.93, d.f. = 1,129, P
= 0.34), identity of the molecular lab (F = 1.05, d.f. =
50,80, P = 0.41), or the mean number of bands scored (F
= 3.95, d.f. = 1,120, P = 0.06). We constructed a phylogeny
of all species (Fig 2, see additional file 5[45]) for analyses
of the relationship between mutation rate and extra-pair
paternity, while simultaneously considering similarity in
phenotype among species due to common phylogenetic
descent. This phylogenetic analysis provided similar conclusions to the analysis based on species-specific data,
explaining 5.1% of the variance (F = 7.03, d.f. = 2,129, P
= 0.0090). A phylogenetic analysis [25] weighted by the
square-root of sample size minus three [42] did not provide a better fit to the data.
The relationship is conservative
The literature on mutation rates, and in particular the literature on mutations in minisatellites, is replete with
comments on the difficulty of quantifying these, and
Amos [this article] cites a number of these references. We
are the first to acknowledge these difficulties. However,
we deliberately attempted to quantify the influence of any
of these sources of error by calculating repeatabilities,
using standard procedures from the quantitative genetics
literature based on one-way analysis of variance [28]. In
this way Møller & Cuervo [1] could show that despite
large heterogeneity in estimates, there were still significant
repeatability in mutation rate estimates and estimates of

extra-pair paternity. We could also show that restriction
enzyme as a factor (code 1 for a given study using an
enzyme and 0 for all other studies) did not explain variation in mutation rate estimates [1]. We showed that the
minimum size of fragments scored did not explain mutation rate estimates [1]. Finally, we showed that there was
no significant effect of molecular lab [1], and there was no
temporal improvement in techniques as shown by no significant effect of year of publication [1]. The absence of
significant effects still holds in the currently much larger
data set.

The main finding of our study is that mutation rates and
extra-pair paternity are significantly positively related, and
this relationship accounts for 5.1% of the variance in an
analysis of species-specific data and phylogenetically
adjusted data, which equals a small to intermediate effect
size (sensu Cohen [43], explaining 1% to 9% of the variance). We note that the effect size reported here is of the
same magnitude that we originally reported (7.8%, [1]).
This effect size is also very close to the average effect size
in all meta-analyses in biology (around 5–7% of the variance explained [44]). Amos [this article] emphasized all
the difficulties in estimating mutation rates, and that any
relationship will be conservative. We can only concur that
the many sources of noise in the data will render any biological signal much weaker than the true underlying signal. Hence, we consider the effect size of 5.1% to be an
underestimate.

Conclusion

Additional file 5

In conclusion, we have corroborated our previous conclusion [1] that mutation rates increase with extra-pair paternity in birds, with an effect size of small to intermediate
magnitude. This conclusion is robust to inclusion of a
number of potentially confounding variables and to statistical control for similarity in phenotype among species
due to common phylogenetic descent.
