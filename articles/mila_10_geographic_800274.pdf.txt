Abstract
Background: Oceanic islands provide unique scenarios for studying the roles of geography and ecology in driving
population divergence and speciation. Assessing the relative importance of selective and neutral factors in driving
population divergence is central to understanding how such divergence may lead to speciation in small oceanic
islands, where opportunities for gene flow and population mixing are potentially high. Here we report a case of genetic
and morphological structure in the Mascarene grey white-eye (Zosterops borbonicus) a species that shows a striking,
geographically structured plumage polymorphism on the topographically and ecologically complex island of Réunion,
yet is monotypic on the relatively uniform neighbouring island of Mauritius.
Results: Analysis of 276 AFLP loci in 197 individuals revealed prolonged independent evolution of Réunion and
Mauritius populations, which is congruent with previous mtDNA assessments. Furthermore, populations on Réunion
showed significant differentiation into three main genetic groups separating lowland from highland areas despite the
small geographic distances involved. Genetic differentiation along the altitudinal gradient is consistent with
morphometric analysis of fitness-related traits. Birds in the highlands were larger, yet had relatively smaller beaks than
in the lowlands, suggesting the role of selection in shaping morphology and restricting gene flow along the gradient.
No genetic differentiation between plumage morphs was detected in neutral markers, suggesting that plumage
differences are of recent origin.
Conclusions: Our results suggest a dual role of vicariance and natural selection in differentiating populations of a
passerine bird in an oceanic island at very small spatial scales. We propose a combination of past microallopatry driven
by volcanic activity and selection-constrained dispersal along steep ecological gradients to explain the striking levels of
population structure found within the island, although the possibility that genetic differences evolved in situ along the
gradient cannot be ruled out at present. The lack of congruence between genetic groups and plumage morphs
suggests that the latter are of recent origin and likely due to social or sexual selection acting on few loci. The presence
of sharp and stable contact zones between plumage morphs suggests that they could be on independent
evolutionary trajectories, yet whether or not they represent incipient species will require further research to directly
assess the degree of reproductive isolation among them.
Background
Island archipelagoes have played a crucial role in the
diversification of biotas, and oceanic islands have long
been recognized as natural laboratories for the study of

evolutionary processes [1-4]. Geographically isolated
populations of a colonist lineage on different islands often
diverge, leading to the accumulation of species on individual islands within an archipelago [5-7]. Furthermore,
different selection pressures acting on populations within
a single island can promote intra-island speciation, yet
this depends mostly upon the spatial scale of both

intraspecific gene flow and divergent natural selection
pressures relative to the size of the island [8,9]. Thus, for a
given colonist lineage, intra-island speciation should contribute to an increase in species richness within an archipelago only if some islands are large enough to prevent
the homogenizing effect of gene flow, or divergent selection pressures are sufficiently strong to drive speciation
in spite of gene flow. While geographic isolation has long
been recognized as a key factor in speciation [1,10], it
appears that intra-island speciation can take place only
when island size exceeds a clade-specific threshold [11].
Below that threshold, small islands are thought to simply
lack opportunities for geographic isolation or spatially
heterogeneous selection [12,13]. In birds, several recent
studies have emphasized the lack of examples of intraisland speciation on islands smaller than Madagascar,
with all cases of related endemic species within an island
being best explained by multiple invasions [4,9,14,15]. Yet
evidence of evolutionary divergence in bird populations
within small islands exists [16,17], suggesting that population differentiation is possible under strong selection
despite gene flow and may lead to speciation if historical
events combine with ecological differentiation to generate strong ecogeographic barriers. Because of their
unique characteristics as "closed systems", cases of
within-island population structure provide unique
opportunities to investigate the relative roles of ecological
and allopatric factors in driving differentiation, as well as
the magnitude and spatial scale at which gene flow precludes divergence.
Here we examine patterns of genetic and morphological differentiation in the Mascarene grey white-eye
endemic to Réunion (Zosterops b. borbonicus) and Mauritius (Z. b. mauritianus) in the Mascarene Islands, some
800 km off the coast of Madagascar in the southern
Indian Ocean [18]. A single light-grey plumage morph is
found on the relatively old and flat island of Mauritius
(1,865 km2), yet the species is composed of four distinct
plumage morphs on the topographically and ecologically
complex island of Réunion (2,512 km2). The colour
morphs on Réunion were first described as different species or as individual, age or sex variants [19-21], and then
as four endemic subspecies [22-24]. The morphs are geographically structured and separated by either sharp contact zones at rivers and lava flows, or by less defined
altitudinal clines of colouration (Fig. 1), a unique pattern
within a bird species on a small oceanic island. The grey
morph is restricted to the highland areas (typically > 1000
m), where it is sympatric with the all brown morph. The
latter is also found on the west side of the island down to
sea level (where it is lighter in colour). The all brown
morph comes into contact with the grey-headed brown
morph of the eastern side of the island at the Galets River,
and with the grey-headed brown-nape morph from the

south end of the island at the St. Etienne River. Our field
sampling since 2007 revealed that the geographic structure of colour morphs (Table 1) and the position of contact zones separating them has remained unchanged
since first described by Gill [23] over 40 years ago, suggesting that some mechanisms maintain the distinctiveness of the morphs in spite of the birds' high vagility.
Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed a
deep phylogenetic break between reciprocally monophyletic populations of Réunion and Mauritius [25], and an
estimated coalescence time to a common ancestor within
the last 430,000 years. As shown by Warren et al. [25], Z.
borbonicus forms a monophyletic clade that is sister to
the divergent Z. olivaceus clade (also found on both
Réunion and Mauritius). The divergence of these two
clades (i.e. all four Mascarene forms) along with Z.
mouroniensis and Z. semiflavus (from the Comoros and
Seychelles Islands, respectively) from their closest continental relatives occurs deep within the Zosteropidae phylogeny and substantially pre-dates the divergence of all
other western Indian Ocean Zosterops from their closest
continental relative. Therefore, while multiple hypotheses
for the direction of inter-island Zosterops colonization in
the Mascarenes are plausible, based on mtDNA data and
the sampling of all known living and extinct western
Indian Ocean island forms, the Réunion population of Z.
borbonicus can only result from a single colonization of
the island and long-term divergence from the Mauritian
population. This leaves open the possibility of an intraisland evolutionary radiation on Reunion.
While initial divergence could have resulted from drift
or divergent selection in geographically separate areas
within the island, three lines of evidence suggest the role
of assortative mating in maintaining Réunion morphs
separated: (1) The birds are good flyers and the geographic barriers separating the morphs are very narrow
(0.3-5 km) relative to the birds' dispersal ability; (2)
although intermediates occur, most sympatric grey and
brown individuals in the highlands are easily assigned to
either morph despite forming highly-social, mixed foraging groups; and (3) putative hybrids can be easily identified by a clear mixing of brown and grey colour, and are
rare in nature [23]. Given this evidence for at least incipient reproductive isolation among Z. borbonicus morphs
within Réunion, we carried out a survey of genome-wide
genetic variation using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) to investigate inter-island divergence
as well as the relationship between any genetic structure
of populations within Réunion and the geographic distribution of colour morphs, geographic barriers, and ecological gradients. We also analyzed variation in fitnessrelated morphological traits to assess the role of selection
in driving phenotypic divergence.

Figure 1 Sampling localities and geographic distribution of Z. borbonicus plumage morphs in Réunion and Mauritius, the two largest Mascarene Islands. Light, medium and dark grey layers on maps correspond to elevations 0-600 m, 600-1000 m, and 1000-3000 m, respectively. Thick
lines correspond to sharp contact zones between morphs with narrow hybrid zones at rivers or lava flows. Thin black lines represent approximate
boundaries between morphs away from contact zones (where considerable intergradation occurs). Dashed line indicates inferred boundary in unsurveyed area. Plumage morphs are coded as follows: A = brown, B = grey, C = grey-headed brown, D = grey-headed brown nape, E = Mauritius grey.

Results
Morphological variation

A principal components analysis (PCA) revealed the separation of individuals along PC1 into two main clusters
corresponding mainly to lowland (< 1000 m) and highland (>1000 m) populations (Fig. 2). The PC1 axis represents size, with high positive factor loadings for wing, tail
and tarsus lengths, and negative values for bill length,
width and depth (Table 2). Birds in the highlands are
therefore characterized by longer wings, tails and tarsi,
yet smaller beaks than birds in the lowlands. Birds from
Mauritius had significantly shorter tarsi and narrower
bills than Réunion birds (Fig. 3), yet overall clustered with

lowland Réunion birds from the eastern side of the island
in the multivariate analysis (Fig. 2).
Wing, tail and tarsus length means per site showed a
strong positive correlation with elevation, whereas bill
measurements showed a weak, inverse pattern (Fig. 3).
According to a linear regression analysis, elevation was a
good predictor of tarsus length (R2 = 0.512, F1,230 =
240.931, P < 0.0001), wing length (R2 = 0.292, F1,229 =
94.233, P < 0.0001) and tail length (R2 = 0.288, F1,211 =
85.282, P < 0.0001), yet explained less of the variance in
bill length (R2 = 0.048, F1,231 = 11.736, P = 0.001), bill
depth (R2 = 0.095, F1,231 = 24.131, P < 0.0001), and bill
width (R2 = 0.222, F1,231 = 65.784, P < 0.0001).

Genetic diversity and structure

The four pairs of selective primers used to generate AFLP
markers yielded a total of 276 scorable loci, out of which
63 (23%) were polymorphic (Table 3). The proportion of
variable loci per primer pair ranged from 16 to 39%,
which is within the range of values found in birds and
other vertebrates [26]. However, the difference in genetic
diversity between islands was marked, with Réunion
showing more than twice the percent of polymorphic loci
(92% vs. 40%) and expected heterozygosity (0.237 vs.
0.118) than Mauritius (Table 4).
Differentiation between the two islands accounted for
almost one third of the variance in genetic variation, with
structuring among populations within islands and
within-population variation explaining 10% and 63% of
the variance, respectively (Table 5). A plot of the first two
coordinates (55% cumulative variance explained) from a
principal coordinate analysis (PCO) of AFLP variation
revealed a clear separation between Réunion and Mauritian localities along the first coordinate (40% of the variance) (Fig. 4). No structure was apparent within
Mauritius, although sampling there was limited and
restricted to the southern part of the island. However,
clear separation of populations was apparent within
Réunion, with some highland sites appearing differentiated from lowland sites (e. g., Bélouve and St. Leu) along
the first principal coordinate (Fig. 4).
A Bayesian population assignment analysis using
STRUCTURE 2.2 corroborated the marked separation of
Mauritius with respect to Réunion. An optimal K of 4

revealed a Mauritian cluster and three additional clusters
within Réunion (Fig. 5). Separate analysis for each island
did not change these results, yielding optimal K values of
3 and 1 for Réunion and Mauritius, respectively. The
three clusters identified within Réunion are geographically structured and correspond roughly to lowland areas
(green in Fig. 5), western highlands (blue) and eastern
highlands (yellow), respectively. Several individuals
within each of these main areas clustered with other
groups, suggesting either ongoing movement of individuals or past events of gene flow. For example, 5 individuals
from the Volcano site (VO in Fig. 1) showed high assignment probability to the green lowland cluster. Interestingly, and despite the relatively low sample sizes,
individuals from locality VB had high probabilities of
assignment to the blue cluster, whereas in locality DD,
just 1 km downhill from VB (see Fig. 1), the probability of
belonging to the green cluster was higher. Overall, our
results suggest that population structuring within
Réunion occurs at a very small spatial scale.
FST values between islands were high (Table 6), with an
average ΦPT of 0.38 (SD = 0.06). Within Réunion, differentiation between populations was remarkably high, with
an average pairwise ΦPT of 0.148, and highest values were
obtained in highland-lowland comparisons. A Mantel
test of the correlation between a matrix of geographic
distances (Table 6) and FST values among localities was
not significant (P = 0.629), suggesting that factors other
than mere isolation-by-distance are responsible for the
observed genetic structure.

Figure 2 Principal components analysis of morphological variation. Based on 6 morphological traits (wing length, tail length, tarsus length, bill
length, bill width and bill depth) across 214 individuals of Z. borbonicus from 11 localities in Réunion (colored markers, with highland sites represented
by triangles and lowland sites by filled circles) and Mauritius (black markers). The variance explained by PC1 and PC2 is 44% and 27%, respectively (see
Table 2)

To examine the potential role of selection in driving the
marked genetic differentiation between highland and
lowland populations, we calculated FST values per locus
between Le Maido (2,062 m) and St. Leu (509 m) on the
east side of the island. A distribution of FST values shows
that differentiation is not due to just a few loci but to the
contribution of many different ones, with 13 out of 44
loci (30%) showing FST values > 0.1 (Fig. 6). None of these
loci were significant outliers in a distribution of FST
against heterozygosity, indicating that they are not likely
to be under selection [27].

Discussion
Geographic differentiation of Z. borbonicus in the
Mascarenes

Genetic and morphological data examined here revealed
a high degree of divergence between Zosterops borboni-

cus populations in Mauritius and Réunion, suggesting
prolonged independent evolutionary history with little or
no gene flow for a very long time, as well as high levels of
structure within the island of Réunion. Inter-island differentiation in both mitochondrial DNA [25] and genomewide AFLP loci is extensive, suggesting that diversification on Réunion has likely evolved in situ and is the product of a single colonization. Indeed, given additional
diagnostic characters in plumage and morphology, the
two populations of Zosterops borbonicus might in fact
constitute two separate species [28].
The remarkable degree of differentiation in both AFLP
markers and morphological traits within Réunion, reveals
very low dispersal rates in Z. borbonicus and a strong role
for neutral and selective factors in promoting divergence
despite the island's small size. The pattern of genetic
structure identified with our AFLP data does not corre-

spond to the current distribution of the four plumage
morphs on the island, suggesting that differences in
plumage colour are of relatively recent origin. Given that
the plumage traits are likely controlled by relatively few
genes [23], and that only a small fraction of the genome
was surveyed with our AFLP markers, the lack of congruence is not surprising and more exhaustive genome-wide
surveying and examination of pigmentation-related candidate genes (currently underway) will be needed to identify those loci.
The current pattern of geographic variation of Z. borbonicus on the island as revealed by our different datasets
is likely the product of four main evolutionary processes:
(1) microallopatric isolation of ancestral populations into
at least three disjunct demographic units, which has
resulted in divergence in neutral genomic markers; (2)
morphological differentiation along altitudinal gradients
through local adaptation; (3) the appearance of distinct
plumage morphs which now exist (or co-exist) in different parts of the island; and (4) the maintenance of these
patterns in place over time, through a combination of
restricted dispersal and pre and/or post-zygotic mechanisms of reproductive isolation. The combined effect of
these different processes has likely given rise to the patterns of divergence and structure observed on Réunion,
which are remarkable given the small geographic scale of
the island and thus the opportunity for high levels of
homogenizing gene flow in a highly vagile organism.
Although the establishment of isolated allopatric populations of birds in a small island is generally unlikely, the
inferred pattern of microallopatry responsible for the
genetic structure found in neutral markers could be tied
to the active eruptive history of Réunion's volcanoes, the
"Piton des Neiges" on the northwest, and the "Piton de la
Fournaise" in the southeast. Whereas the island of Mauri-

tius is about 8 million years old [29], the emergence of
lava above sea level in Réunion was around 2.1 Mya [30],
and was followed by two periods of frequent explosive
eruptions, one between 0.35 and 0.13 Mya (after which
the center of the volcano collapsed giving rise to the three
large calderas seen today), and one between 0.05 and
0.012 Mya [30,31]. In turn, the still active "Piton de la
Fournaise", which originated about 0.55 Mya, has had
three main eruptive phases from 0.53 to 0.29 Mya, from
0.22 to 0.05 Mya, and from 0.013 to the present [32].
Given the combined activity of both volcanoes, barren
lava fields have covered most of the island at different
times over the last 350,000 years. For at least part of this
period, areas with suitable vegetation for the maintenance of Z. borbonicus populations were probably
restricted to isolated patches. The presence of small areas
(10 to 100 km2) with original basaltic shields at ground
level in areas scattered around Réunion (see Fig. 1 in
Deniel et al. 1992) suggests that these areas have
remained free of lava for hundreds of thousands of years,
and thus could have harboured forested areas capable of
sustaining bird populations. Since the time of the last
eruption of the "Piton des Neiges", as recent as 12,000
years ago, forested areas would have expanded throughout the island, bringing differentiated Z. borbonicus populations into contact. Given the very limited rates of
dispersal inferred from our genetic and morphological
results, and the apparent reluctance to cross barren areas
such as river beds, large lava flows must have represented
formidable barriers to dispersal among patches across the
island.
The lack of congruence between the pattern of neutral
structure found and the distribution of color morphs suggests that the latter evolved at a later stage and could
indeed be of recent origin, as changes in plumage pigmentation can be fast in birds [33-35].
The relative roles of drift and selection in restricting gene
flow and driving divergence

Phenotypic evolution on island populations can be fast
under strong natural selection [3,9,16,36-38]. In Z. borbonicus, the altitudinal increase of size-related traits like
wing, tail and tarsus length, combined with an opposite
trend for diet-related traits like beak dimensions, suggests
the role of natural selection in driving morphological
divergence along steep altitudinal gradients, as has been
documented in other similar avian systems [39-41]. Rapid
morphological evolution has been documented in other
Zosterops species [42,43], yet adaptive changes in morphology can often evolve too fast for neutral genetic
markers to show congruent patterns of differentiation
[40]. Therefore, the congruent morphological and genetic
differentiation between lowland and highland individuals
in Z. borbonicus (best illustrated by the comparison of St.

Leu [509 m] and Le Maido [2,062 m], separated by only
11 km on the west slope of Réunion), poses the question
of whether genetic divergence represents in situ differentiation through isolation by adaptation (in the absence of
geographic isolation: [44,45], or rather a case of secondary contact between groups previously differentiated in

allopatry. The fact that as many as 30% of polymorphic
loci among these two localities show FST values greater
than 0.1, and that no loci were found to be under selection according to outlier analysis, supports the hypothesis
of secondary contact between cryptic brown morphs
rather than parapatric differentiation within a single

brown morph. Although more intensive sampling along
the island's gradients (currently underway) will be necessary to investigate this question, the morphological
results suggest that selection may be an important factor
in restricting gene flow up and down the slope, and thus
may be important in at least maintaining this marked
genetic break despite the short geographic distances
involved.
Zosterops as "great speciators"

Our results are in line with previous work documenting
the high diversification capacity of white-eyes (Zosteropidae) [25,46]. Members of the group are successful colonizers due to their high dispersal capacity, which enables
them to reach remote islands, yet appear to quickly
evolve shifts in dispersal ability that reduce gene flow and
promote diversification. This so-called "great speciator
paradox" [47] is clearly illustrated by Z. borbonicus in the
Mascarenes, where upon colonization, and despite the

species' good flying capacity, dispersal rate has been dramatically reduced. The evolution of "behavioral flightlessness" has been documented in other members of the
genus [43,48,49], and together with sociality, rapid morphological evolution, generalist ecology and short generation time, contribute to the high diversification rates
observed in this group [42,46]. Indeed, the relatively high
levels of genetic diversity found in AFLP could be attributed to the high levels of sociality observed in Z. borbonicus [50], which increases the probability of group
colonization and reduces the chance of founder events
[51,52].

Conclusions
Our results shed light on some of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying an extreme case of small-scale intraisland diversification in a passerine bird. The presence of
three genetic clusters on Réunion island as revealed by
neutral AFLP markers suggests the role of geography in

differentiating populations at some time in the past
despite the island's small size. In turn, morphometric data
suggest the role of ecology-driven selection in differentiating populations and restricting gene flow across habitat
types and geographic barriers. However, the fact that patterns of neutral genetic divergence are not geographically
congruent with the distribution of plumage morphs, suggests that in addition to genetic drift and natural selection, social or sexual selection may have played a role in
driving recent plumage divergence. Future research will
be necessary to determine the degree of reproductive isolation between morphs, and thus the extent to which
morphs represent incipient species. Thus, whether diver-

sification in Réunion's Z. borbonicus is ongoing and represents a case of incipient speciation, or instead the
process has been truncated by widespread gene flow
upon secondary contact among morphs, remains to be
addressed. Previous work on Zosterops lateralis in Australia has shown that selection can act upon colonization
and then remain static for thousands of years [36]. However, maintenance of narrow hybrid zones between
colour morphs and the sympatry of grey and brown
morphs in the highlands suggest that reproductive isolating mechanisms are at play. Our results provide a first
attempt at unraveling the doubtlessly complex combination of neutral and selective factors that underlie the evo-

Methods
Field procedures and morphological analysis

Birds were captured using standard mist nets at 11 sampling localities, eight on Réunion and three on Mauritius
(Fig. 1, Table 1). Individuals were aged using plumage
characteristics, eye and gape color, and the degree of skull
ossification [53]. Individuals were weighed and marked
permanently with a uniquely numbered aluminum ring.
A wing ruler was used to measure the unflattened wing
chord (the distance from the carpal joint to the tip of the
longest primary) to the nearest 0.5 mm. Dial calipers of
0.1-mm precision were used to measure tail length (from
the uropygial gland to the tip of the longest rectrix), tarsus length (from the intertarsal joint to the most distal

undivided scute on the tarsometatarsus), bill length (from
the anterior end of the nares to the tip of the upper mandible), and bill width and depth (both measured at the
anterior end of the nares). All measurements were taken
by BM. Manipulation of live birds for ringing, measurements and blood sampling were done under a ringing
permit issued by CRBPO Museum National d'Histoire
Naturelle (Paris, France), and in compliance with ethical
guidelines at Université Paul Sabatier. A special authorization to work on protected species was issued by Direction Régionale de l'Environnement (DIREN Réunion).
We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA)
on the correlation matrix of ln-transformed morphological variables. Based on results from the multivariate analysis, we analysed variation in morphological traits along
the altitudinal gradient by means of regression analysis,
with elevation as the predictor variable. Variables were
transformed prior to analyses to meet model assump-

tions. Assumptions such as normality of the residuals and
homogeneity of variances were met.
Since there is no sexual dimorphism in plumage and
morphology [23], both males and females were included
in the analysis. Individuals with clear juvenile characteristics (orange-grey eye instead of reddish brown, yellow
gape, natal plumage, etc.), were excluded from the analysis. However, because the first post-natal moult is complete in this species (juveniles change all feathers,
including flight feathers [pers. obs.]), many first and second-year birds could not be distinguished from adults,
and thus some young birds might be part of the sample.
AFLP analysis

Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) profiles were generated using a protocol modified slightly
from Vos et al. [54], as detailed in Milá et al. [55]. Briefly,
whole genomic DNA was digested with restriction
enzymes EcoRI and MseI (Tru9) and fragments were
ligated to oligonucleotide adapters with T4 DNA ligase. A
random sub-sample of all restriction fragments was
obtained through a pre-selective amplification using
primers E-t and M-c, followed by four selective amplifications using primer pairs E-tct/M-cga, E-tcta/M-ctt, Etag/M-cag, and E-tgc/M-cat (Table 3), with each E primer
fluorescently labeled with either VIC or 6FAM fluorescent dyes. Twelve pairs of selective amplification primers
were tested with a subset of individuals, but only those
producing repeatable and unambiguously scorable profiles were used in the analysis. Selectively amplified fragments were run in an ABI 3700 genetic analyzer with a

LIZ500 size standard. Peaks were visualized using GENEMAPPER 3.7 and scored manually. Only unambiguously
scorable loci and individuals were included in the analysis
and peaks found in less than 2% of individuals were
excluded. Methodological error rate was assessed by running a subset of 5 individuals twice from the pre-selective
amplification step. The average per-locus error rate for
the AFLP data, measured as recommended by Bonin et
al. [56], was 2.1%.
We estimated allelic frequencies using Zhivotovsky's
[57] Bayesian method with uniform prior distributions
and assuming Hardy-Weinberg genotypic proportions.
Genetic diversity (He), and per-locus FST values based on
allele frequencies where calculated using the method by
Lynch and Milligan [58] as implemented in the program
AFLP-SURV v. 1.0 [59]. A matrix of pairwise population FST
values using the FST analogue ΦPT was calculated with
GENALEX 6.0 [60]. ΦPT was calculated as VAP/(VAP + VWP)
where VAP is the variance among populations and VWP is
the variance within populations. Probability values of
pairwise ΦPT were based on 9999 permutations.
To assess genetic structure among samples we conducted a principal coordinate analysis (PCO; Orloci [61])
on a genetic distance matrix generated from the binary
presence-absence matrix as implemented in GENALEX
6.0. We also examined patterns of population structure
using the Bayesian assignment probability test in the program STRUCTURE 2.2 [62]. This program uses a Bayesian
approach to generate posterior probabilities of assignment of individuals to each of a given number of popula-

tions (K) independently of the geographic locality of
origin. As recommended for dominant markers, we
applied a model of no admixture with correlated allele
frequencies [63] and the optimal value of K was calculated following the method by Evanno et al. [64].
To examine the pattern of isolation by distance we
tested the correlation between a matrix of pairwise FST /
(1-FST) values among localities and a matrix of the natural
log of Euclidean geographic distances between localities.
We used a Mantel test with 10,000 permutations of
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient with a one-tailed
exact test, as implemented in the program ISOLDE in the
package GENEPOP[65].
To assess the potential role of selection in driving
genetic differentiation among populations, we examined
plots of FST against heterozygosity under the assumption
of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to identify significant
outlier loci with the program DFDIST[27]. Significance
values at the 95% level for outlier loci were obtained by
generating a null distribution of FST values based on
50,000 simulated loci with a mean FST equivalent to the
"neutral" mean FST of the empirical distribution, which
was obtained by trimming the 30% highest and lowest FST
values [27].
