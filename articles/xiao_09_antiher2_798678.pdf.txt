Abstract
Background: Nanocarrier-based antibody targeting is a promising modality in therapeutic and
diagnostic oncology. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) exhibit two unique optical
properties that can be exploited for these applications, strong Raman signal for cancer cell
detection and near-infrared (NIR) absorbance for selective photothermal ablation of tumors. In the
present study, we constructed a HER2 IgY-SWNT complex and demonstrated its dual functionality
for both detection and selective destruction of cancer cells in an in vitro model consisting of HER2expressing SK-BR-3 cells and HER2-negative MCF-7 cells.
Methods: The complex was constructed by covalently conjugating carboxylated SWNTs with
anti-HER2 chicken IgY antibody, which is more specific and sensitive than mammalian IgGs. Raman
signals were recorded on Raman spectrometers with a laser excitation at 785 nm. NIR irradiation
was performed using a diode laser system, and cells with or without nanotube treatment were
irradiated by 808 nm laser at 5 W/cm2 for 2 min. Cell viability was examined by the calcein AM/
ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) staining.
Results: Using a Raman optical microscope, we found the Raman signal collected at single-cell level
from the complex-treated SK-BR-3 cells was significantly greater than that from various control
cells. NIR irradiation selectively destroyed the complex-targeted breast cancer cells without
harming receptor-free cells. The cell death was effectuated without the need of internalization of
SWNTs by the cancer cells, a finding that has not been reported previously.

Conclusion: We have demonstrated that the HER2 IgY-SWNT complex specifically targeted
HER2-expressing SK-BR-3 cells but not receptor-negative MCF-7 cells. The complex can be
potentially used for both detection and selective photothermal ablation of receptor-positive breast
cancer cells without the need of internalization by the cells. Thus, the unique intrinsic properties
of SWNTs combined with high specificity and sensitivity of IgY antibodies can lead to new strategies
for cancer detection and therapy.

Background
Although significant progress has been made in both the
understanding and treatment of cancer during the last
thirty years, it remains the second leading cause of death
in the United States. Non-invasive detection of cancer in
its early stages is of great interest since early cancer diagnosis, in combination with precise cancer therapies, could
significantly increase the survival rate of patients. Nanomedicine, an emerging research area that integrates nanomaterials and biomedicine, has the potential to provide
novel diagnostic tools for detection of primary cancers at
their earliest stages, and to provide improved therapeutic
protocols. Research in nanomedicine will also lead to the
understanding of the intricate interplay of nanomaterials
with components of biological systems.
Attaching antibodies or other targeting agents (such as
receptor ligands) to the surface of nanocarriers to achieve
specific targeting of cancerous cells is a promising modality for therapeutic and diagnostic oncology [1]. Improved
therapeutic efficacy of targeted nanocarriers has been
established in multiple animal models of cancer, and currently more than 120 clinical trials are underway with various antibody-containing nanocarrier formulations [2].
The most commonly explored nanocarriers include polymer conjugates, polymeric nanoparticles, lipid-based carriers such as liposomes and micelles, and dendrimers [1].
Recent developments in nanotechnology have engendered a range of novel inorganic nanomaterials, such as
metal nanoshells [3] and carbon nanotubes [4], offering
unique opto-electronic properties compared with conventional organic nanocarriers [3,4].
Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) is a novel nanomaterial that exhibits unique structural, mechanical, electrical and optical properties that are promising for various
biological and biomedical applications, such as biosensors [5], novel biomaterials [6], and drug delivery transporters [7-11]. Water-solubilized SWNTs have been
shown to transverse the cell membrane via endocytosis to
shuttle various cargoes into cells, including proteins [12],
nucleic acid such as plasmid DNA [13,14] and short interfering RNA [15], without causing cytotoxicity. Two unique
intrinsic properties of SWNTs can be exploited to facilitate
cancer detection and therapy. SWNTs have very strong resonant Raman scattering [16] that can be harnessed for

cancer cell detection [17-19]. SWNTs absorb NIR light in
the 700-1100 nm spectral window to which biological
systems are transparent; continuous NIR irradiation of
SWNTs attached to cancer cells produces excessive heat in
the local environment that can be utilized to achieve
selective destruction of these cells without harming normal cells [7,20-22].
To achieve specific targeting of tumor cells for photothermal ablation, SWNTs have been either conjugated to
folate to target folate receptors in folate positive cancer
cells [7,22] or attached noncovalently (through adsorption) [20] or indirectly via streptavidin-biotin interaction
[21] to antibodies targeting specific receptors on cancer
cells. Direct covalent attachment of antibodies to SWNTs
for specific tumor targeting has also been reported [23],
however, using such antibody-SWNT conjugates for specific photothermal ablation of cancer cells with NIR light
has not been reported.
All of the antibodies in clinical use today for cancer cell
targeting are mammalian IgG monoclonal antibodies
[24]. Recently, there has been renewed interest in using
avian IgY antibodies as IgG substitutes in immunoassays
and clinical applications [25]. IgYs, distinct from IgGs in
molecular structure and biochemical features, have many
attractive biochemical, immunological and production
advantages over IgGs and are suitable for further development [25]. We have recently demonstrated the advantages
of using anti-HER2 IgY antibody in detecting breast cancer
cells [26]. IgY antibodies provide specific and more sensitive detection of breast cancer cells compared with commercial IgG or IgM antibodies. Coupled with quantum
dots, anti-HER2 IgY antibodies have the potential to give
quantitative biomarker measurements [26].
In an effort to improve breast cancer detection and therapy, we have developed a novel method which combines
the advantages of anti-HER2 IgY antibody with the unique
properties of SWNTs. We constructed a HER2 IgY-SWNT
complex by directly functionalizing SWNTs with the antiHER2 IgY antibody through covalent bonding, explored
the Raman and NIR optical properties of the complex, and
tested its feasibility for detection and selective destruction
of cancer cells.

Methods
Preparation of the HER2 IgY-SWNT complex
Purified HiPco SWNTs were purchased from Carbon Nanotechnologies (Houston, TX) and solubilized by carboxylation using a microwave-assisted functionalization
method described previously [27]. In a typical reaction,
~1 mg of as-received carbon nanotubes were added into 2
ml of a 1:1 mixture of 70% nitric acid and 97% sulfuric
acid aqueous solutions in a plastic beaker. The mixture
was then subjected to microwave radiation for 2 min.
Afterwards, the mixture was diluted with deionized water
and centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min to remove insoluble
materials. The supernatant was filtered through a Microcon YM-50 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA)
and rinsed thoroughly with 100 mM MES buffer in order
to adjust pH to 4.5. For covalent attachment of HER2 IgY
antibody onto SWNTs, 2.0 mg N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), 88.3 mg
N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 100 μL MES buffer
solution (100 mM, pH 4.5) were added to the microwavefunctionalized SWNT solution and incubated for 60 min
at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged in
Microcon YM-50 centrifugal filter unit and rinsed with a
100 mM MES buffer solution (pH 6.3) to remove excess
EDC, NHS and the byproduct urea. The purified, activated
carbon nanotubes on the filter were re-dispersed into a
100 mM MES buffer solution (pH 6.3). Thereafter, 60 μl
(1.0 mg/ml) chicken anti-HER2 IgY antibody, prepared as
described previously [26], was added into the above solution and reacted for 2 h. Finally, the solution was centrifuged at 25,000 g for 20 min to remove the unreacted
materials. The collected precipitate was resuspended in
PBS buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4) and used for further studies.
The concentration of antibody conjugated to SWNTs was
determined using BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL)
following the manufacturer's instructions. The SWNT concentration in the solution was estimated from the absorbance spectrum at 808 nm acquired with a Cary-500 UVvisible-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) in
double-beam mode.
Cell culture and treatment
Breast carcinoma cell lines SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 were
obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured under
conditions as recommended by the supplier. Cells were
grown for 24 h to reach ~30-40% confluence, then treated
with the HER2 IgY-SWNT complex or SWNT or antibody
alone at the final nanotube concentration of 4 mg/L for 24
h under the same culture condition. The cell culture was
washed 3 times with fresh medium before NIR irradiation
to remove unbound nanotubes, antibodies or the antibody nanotube complex.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
The SWNTs before and after conjugation with anti-HER2
IgY antibody were imaged with a tapping mode Nano-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/9/351

scope IIIa atomic force microscope (Veeco, Chadds Ford,
PA). In order to image the SWNTs, 5 μl of the prepared
solutions were deposited on freshly cleaved mica. After a
3-5 min incubation, the mica surface was rinsed with 3
drops of deionized water 4 times and dried under a flow
of nitrogen. During imaging, a 125 μm long rectangular
silicon cantilever/tip assembly was used with a spring constant of 40 N/m, resonance frequency of 315-352 kHz and
a tip radius of 5-10 nm. The images were generated by the
change in amplitude of the free oscillation of the cantilever as it interacts with the sample.
Dispersive Raman spectrometric analysis
Raman spectra for the HER2 IgY-SWNT complex solution
were collected on a S1000 Raman spectrometer from Renishaw (Hoffman Estates, IL) coupled to a DM LM microscope from Leica (Bannockburn, IL) using a 50× objective.
The source was an Ar-ion pumped tunable Ti:sapphire
laser from Coherent (Santa Clara, CA) operating at 785
nm. Laser power was 7 mW measured at the sample.

Senterra dispersive Raman spectrometer from Bruker
Optics (Billerica, MA) was used to collect Raman spectra
from cell cultures. The system consisted of laser excitation
at 785 nm focused on the samples through an optical system, producing spectra of Raman shifts, which were evaluated to identify and determine the presence and location
of the nanomaterial. Measurements were made using a
10× objective lens, with laser powers ranging from 1 to 25
mW, and exposure times of 10 to 60 s. Various settings
were tried in order to determine the optimum signal-tonoise ratio and to avoid damaging the samples from overheating by the laser.
NIR irradiation and temperature measurement
A Spectra-Physics diode laser from Newport (Irvine, CA)
at a wavelength of 808 nm mounted on a heat sink was
employed to heat the samples. The heat sink was controlled by a driver and a temperature controller. Two thermocouples made from 80 μm diameter type K wire from
Omega (Stamford, CT) were positioned outside of the
beam path to record the temperature response. A program
written in LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX)
was used to control the timing and power of the laser and
to record the temperature of the two thermocouple junctions. The laser exposure was conducted at a current of 3.0
A in the laser diode which produced an output of 5 W/
cm2, and the duration was set to 120 s.

Samples were contained in cells with a 1 cm × 1 cm glass
bottom. A removable Teflon cap was fitted over the cells.
A 4.5 mm hole was drilled through the cap for the laser to
pass through (the beam diameter was 4.4 mm). Two
smaller holes were drilled through the cap for the thermocouple wires to pass through. One of the thermocouples
was extended below the cap into the fluid and positioned

just at the edge of the illuminated area. The second was
positioned approximately 1 mm outside the edge of the
beam path. The beam passed through the sample's glass
bottom and entered a 3 cm diameter beam dump located
just below the glass bottom. The beam dump serves to
prevent radiation passing through the sample from making its way back to the sample. A diagram for the laser
exposure arrangement is shown in Fig. 1.
Cell viability assay
Ten (10) min after heating with NIR irradiation, cell viability was examined by the calcein AM/ethidium
homodimer-1 (EthD-1) staining [28]. The LIVE/DEAD
Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit from Molecular Probes (Eugene,
OR) was used and protocols provided by the manufacturer were adopted. Cells showing green fluorescence were
considered alive; while dead cells showed red fluorescence. Results were expressed as percentage of live cells
relative to the number of cells on a control slide that did
not go through treatment or NIR irradiation.
SWNTs localization study by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Cells were grown on tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc,
Rochester, NY) at a density of 30,000 cells/cm2 and then
treated with the HER2 IgY-SWNT complex at the final
nanotube concentration of 4 mg/L for 24 h. Cell monolayers were subsequently fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
zinc formalin (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA), and were preblocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBST (50 mM
Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 150 mM Tween 20), 20°C, for
20 min. For detection, slides were robotically prepared

(reaction with secondary antibody and fluorescent detection reagents) with a Benchmark XT workstation (Ventana, Tucson, AZ) [29]. Anti-IgY biotinylated antibody
(GenWay, San Diego, CA) was used as the secondary antibody and was detected by fluorescence microscopy with
streptavidin-Qdot655 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Imaging systems for analysis of fluorescence signals from quantum dots and integration of the signal with an imaging
system were described elsewhere [30,31].
Confocal laser scanning microscopy images were
obtained on a TCS SP5/DM6000 from Leica using an HCX
Pl Apo oil immersion 63× coverslip corrected objective. A
405 nm Diode laser was used as the excitation source
while the emission bands were set to 440 nm to 480 nm
(DAPI, channel 1), 640 nm to 660 nm (QDs, channel 2),
and diffraction (cells, channel 3). Zoom functions
between 1× and 6× were used as needed.
Data analysis
All experiments were repeated at least 3 times with at least
3 replicates each time. For comparative studies, one-way
ANOVA tests (with Bonferroni post test if p < 0.05) were
used for statistical analysis. Differences were considered
statistically significant if a p value of < 0.05 was achieved.

Results
Preparation and characterization of the HER2 IgY-SWNT
Complex
The HER2 IgY-SWNT complex was prepared by first carboxylating HiPco SWNTs using a microwave-assisted
functionalization method published previously [27]; the
carboxylated SWNTs were then activated by N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride
(EDC) and N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and reacted
with HER2 IgY antibody to form the covalent complex,
through amidation between the carboxyl groups on the
SWNTs with primary amines on amino acid residues such
as lysine and arginine on the antibody (Fig. 2A) [32]. Free
unconjugated antibodies were removed through ultracentrifugation. The SWNTs used consisted of short, straight
fragments (with average diameter and length being 1.17 ±
0.28 nm and 88.00 ± 43.68 nm, respectively) and exist as
individual tubes and small bundles rather than large
aggregates as evidenced by atomic force microscopy
(AFM) image (Figs. 2B and 2C). After antibody attachment, the diameter of the nanotubes increased to 4.02 ±
0.82 nm (Figs. 2D and 2E). Based on the concentrations
of the carbon nanotubes and the IgY antibodies used, it
was estimated that on average about 10 IgY antibody molecules were attached to each nanotube. The nanotube
complex solutions were highly stable in PBS buffer, without forming aggregates for several months when kept at
4°C.

semiconducting SWNTs in the sample. The spectra also
contained the disorder-induced D band around 1300 cm1. The UV-visible-NIR spectra (Fig. 3B) indicated that the

with antibody retained a significant portion of their optic
properties that are potentially useful for biomedical applications.
Raman spectrometric detection of cancer cells using the
HER2 IgY-SWNT complex
We first explored the feasibility of harnessing the characteristic ~1590 cm-1 Raman band for in vitro specific detection of cancer cells. Breast carcinoma SK-BR-3 cells, which
have high HER2 expression [26], were treated with the
HER2 IgY-SWNT complex for 24 h. Raman spectroscopy
collected at single-cell level from randomly selected cells
showed the characteristic G band at ~1590 cm-1 (Fig. 4).
The Raman signal from the complex-treated breast cancer
cells resulted from the specific binding of the IgY antibody
moiety of the complex to the HER2 receptor on the cancer
cells, as the same cells treated with SWNTs alone did not
exhibit Raman scattering. In addition, MCF-7, which are
negative for HER2 expression [26], did not exhibit Raman
signals when treated with the HER2 IgY-SWNT complex.
Thus the characteristic Raman band at ~1590 cm-1 from
the HER2 IgY-SWNT complex differentiated HER2expressing SK-BR-3 cells from the receptor-negative MCF7 cells.
NIR irradiation-induced heating of the HER2 IgY-SWNT
complex suspension
To demonstrate the heating effect of the HER2 IgY-SWNT
complex upon NIR irradiation, we carried out a control

experiment in which an aqueous solution of the HER2
IgY-SWNT complex in PBS at a concentration of 4.0 mg/L
was irradiated for 2 min using a laser diode with a wavelength of 808 nm at 5.0 W/cm2 (Fig. 5). The temperature
rose rapidly after a short lag of a few seconds then
increased constantly with time. The maximum temperature increase was ~14°C. On the other hand, PBS solution
without SWNTs showed very little temperature rise
(<1°C), indicating the solution is transparent to the 808
nm NIR light.
Selective photothermal ablation of cancer cells using the
HER2 IgY-SWNT complex
Next, we explored the feasibility of using the HER2 IgYSWNT complex for in vitro selective destruction of breast
carcinoma SK-BR-3 cells (Fig. 6). We conducted the NIR
irradiation with a 808 nm laser at 5 W/cm2 for 2 min. SKBR-3 cells treated with the HER2 IgY-SWNT complex
showed extensive cell death after heating with NIR irradiation (Figs. 6D and 6G); in stark contrast, negligible cell
death was observed with SK-BR-3 cells treated with
SWNTs alone (Figs. 6B and 6G) or untreated (Figs. 6A and
6G), and in MCF-7 cells treated with the HER2 IgY-SWNT
complex (Fig. 6F). These results clearly demonstrated the
high transparency of biosystems to NIR light in the vicinity of 808 nm, and at the same time indicated that the specific binding of the IgY antibody moiety of the complex
with HER2 receptors on the SK-BR-3 cells is essential for
the selective thermal ablation of tumor cells. On the other
hand, the SWNT moiety is equally indispensable for the
hyperthermia effect, as cell death observed in SK-BR-3
cells treated with the IgY antibody alone (5.9%; Figs. 6C

Error bars represent standard deviation. Cells that did not go
through treatment and irradiation were used as controls
(852 ± 20, 100%). * p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001 versus control.

Localization of the HER2 IgY-SWNT complex on the cell
membrane
To localize the HER2 IgY-SWNT complexes in the cancer
cells, we first performed an immunohistochemical experiment using quantum dots as detection agent. As shown
in Fig. 7A, most of the HER2 IgY-SWNT complexes were
localized on the membrane of the SK-BR-3 cells forming a
shell-like shape, with little detected inside the cells. Fluorescence signal computed from 10 randomly selected cells
shows that the intensity ratio of fluorescence on the cell
surface to that inside the cell is (563 ± 35): 1. No fluorescence signal was detected in receptor-free MCF-7 cells (Fig.
7B), suggesting that binding of the complex onto SK-BR-3
cells resulted from the anti-HER2 activity of its antibody
moiety.

To confirm the above result, we performed additional
experiments using confocal microscopy for imaging. The
high-resolution images shown in Fig. 8 clearly demonstrated that the HER2 IgY-SWNT complexes were localized
on the membrane of the SK-BR-3 cells and were not internalized by the cancer cells.

Discussion
The first problem to tackle for biomedical applications of
SWNTs is to solubilize and disperse carbon nanotubes in
aqueous solutions and functionalize them with biomolecules such as proteins/antibodies, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Past studies using SWNT-antibody conjugates
for specific photothermal ablation of cancer cells attached

antibodies to SWNTs either noncovalently through
adsorption [20] or indirectly via streptavidin-biotin interaction [21]. Direct adsorption of antibodies to SWNTs is
simple to execute but the weak interaction between the
antibody and the nanotubes raises the possibility of loss
of the targeting function of the antibodies. Indirect conjugation via streptavidin-biotin interaction involves an
additional step of preparing the antibody-biotin complex.
A method for direct covalent attachment of antibodies to
SWNTs for specific tumor targeting has been reported [23]
that involves four reactive steps. Here, we used a simpler
method for direct covalent conjugation of antibody to
SWNTs. HiPco SWNTs were first dispersed in water
through microwave-assisted carboxylation, activated by
EDC and NHS, and reacted with HER2 IgY antibody to
form the covalent complex. Microwave-assisted functionalization has several advantages over conventional chemical techniques, such as rapidness and environmental
friendliness [27]. However, the functionalization process
causes some changes in the optoelectronic properties of
the SWNTs, such as increase in the disorder mode (Dband) at ~1300 cm-1 (Fig. 3A) and loss of interband transitions between van Hove singularities in the absorption
spectrum (Fig. 3B). Similar changes have been reported
previously for covalently functionalized carbon nanotubes [27,35,36]. Nevertheless, the resultant IgY-SWNT
complexes retain a significant portion of the optic properties of SWNTs, as evidenced by the fairly strong Raman
and NIR absorbance.
The characteristic G band at ~1590 cm-1 was detected in
HER2-expressing SK-BR-3 cells treated with the IgY-SWNT
complexes (Fig. 4) but not in the similarly treated receptor-negative MCF-7 cells, indicating the ability of Raman
spectroscopy to specifically detect cancer cells in vitro. As a
nondestructive optical spectroscopic technique that does
not require extrinsic contrast-enhancing agents, the use of

Raman spectroscopy has seen a remarkable increase during the last decade in its application to the field of medicine [37]. In particular, Raman spectroscopy has shown
great promise as a new tool for detection of malignant and
premalignant tissues and as a real-time guidance tool during oncosurgical procedures [38]. However, most of these
studies are based on spectral differences between normal
and neoplastic tissues that result from compositional
changes in the affected tissues, and thus, in most cases, the
detection is not highly specific and only possible at later
stages of tumor progression. In the current study, characteristic Raman signals (at ~1590 cm-1) are collected at the
single-cell level from cancer cells targeted by the IgYSWNT complexes, thus opening the possibility of using
Raman spectroscopy for targeted molecular detection of
tumors at the incipient stage. An added advantage of
Raman spectroscopy lies in its potential for in vivo applications for which limited penetration depth is a fundamental barrier. Until recently, Raman spectroscopy has
been generally restricted to probing surface or near-surface areas of biological tissues with penetration depth of
only several hundred microns into tissue. This limitation
mainly stems from the diffuse scattering nature of tissue
which leads to random propagation of photons within its
matrix and prevents the formation of sharp images
required to discriminate signals emerging from deeper
areas. Several methods have been developed recently for
the retrieval of Raman signals from deep areas thus
enhancing tissue penetration of Raman spectroscopy.
These deep Raman techniques discriminate between
Raman signals emerging from different depths within the
sample using temporal or spatial gating [39]. For instance,
combining spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS)
with three-dimensional tomographic imaging, it was possible to image a canine hind limb section of a thickness of
up to 45 mm using transmission Raman spectroscopy
[40,41]. Therefore, combined with advances in Raman

spectroscopic technologies for deep tissue imaging [39],
SWNTs functionalized with antibody specific for tumor
cell receptors may be exploited for in vivo specific detection of cancer cells at early stages.

such as cell membranes ultimately leading to cell death.
The ability to directly measure temperature of an individual nanoparticle will help to validate the hypothesis, and
such an endeavor is currently underway [48].

The present study demonstrates very high specificity of the
HER2 IgY-SWNT complexes for HER2-expressing cancer
cells, indicating the potential usefulness of the IgY antibody for selective targeting of cancer cells. IgY antibodies
offer many advantages over their mammalian IgG counterparts in terms of both production and biochemical and
immunological properties. IgY antibodies can be isolated
in large quantities from egg yolk using simple separation
methods; the non-invasive production method also
brings the great benefit concerning the welfare of the
immunized animals [42]. IgY antibodies can also be used
to avoid interference in immunological assays caused by
the human complement system, rheumatoid factors,
human anti-mouse IgG antibodies (HAMA) or human
and bacterial Fc-receptors [43]. Similarly, for clinical use
as antibody-based therapeutics, they neither activate
mammalian complement nor interact with mammalian
Fc receptors that could mediate inflammatory responses
[44]. Despite these advantages, the application of IgY antibodies in research and medicine has been very limited
[45]. Oral administration of IgY antibodies have shown
great promise as immunotherapy for the prevention and
treatment of enteric, respiratory, and dental infections in
humans and animals [44-47]. As eggs are normal dietary
components, there is practically no risk of toxic side
effects of oral administration of IgY antibodies [44,46].
However, the phylogenetic distance between birds and
mammals implies potential concerns over the immunogenicity of IgY antibodies in human. So far, there has been
no report on intravenous administration of IgY antibodies
in human and the associated immune responses. Nevertheless, concerns over IgY immunogenicity in human
should be completely cleared out before any clinical
application of IgY should be attempted. The results presented here and in a previous study [26] may bring more
attention to this class of antibodies and promote studies
on the immunogenicity of IgY preparations in human.

The method described here for selective cancer cell
destruction differs from the previously published ones
[7,20-22] in that our method does not require internalization of SWNTs into tumor cells. HER2 is a transmembrane
glycoprotein with the receptor motif extended outside the
cell membrane [49]. The reason for the lack of internalization of the SWNT complex by the cancer cells after binding to the cell surface receptor is not known; however, it is
likely due to the surface chemistry of the SWNTs used here
[27,32]. It has been reported the surface chemistry has a
profound impact on the cellular uptake of nanoparticles
such as quantum dots [50]. Although the exact mechanism may differ for various nanoparticles, the surface
dependent cellular uptake may be a common phenomenon for all nanoparticles [51]. It is very important to note
that the functionalization method used in the current
study is different from those published previously where
internalization of SWNTs after binding to the cell surface
receptors have been reported [7,20,22]. In the study by
Chakravarty et al. [21], cellular localization of SWNTs
after incubation with cancer cells was not reported.

Temperature measurement of the IgY-SWNT complex
solution at the nanotube concentration of 4 mg/L showed
an increase of ~14°C in the bulk solution, indicating the
temperature rise of the surrounding environment would
not cause harm to normal cells that do not bind to the
SWNT-containing complex in the short time period (2
min). On the other hand, the same result also hinted that
the thermal destructive effect to cancer cells must be
microscopic rather than macroscopic. We hypothesize
that temperature rise in the nanoscale vicinity of individual nanotubes can be dramatic. The sharp local temperature increase may cause damage to subcellular structures

Conclusion

The method described here for selective photothermal
ablation of cancer cells without the need of internalization by the cells has the advantage of being more easily
extended to other types of cancer cells over agents that
need internalization, as cellular internalization is not
always achievable with all cancer types. Many cancer cells
overexpress specific tumor markers (receptors) on their
surface for which IgY antibody with high specificity and
sensitivity can be developed. Thus, the IgY-SWNT complex, as exemplified in this study by the anti-HER2 IgY
antibody, has the potential to become a novel, generic
modality for detection and therapy of various cancer
types. Our next step is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics,
biodistribution, cytotoxicity and activity of such IgYSWNT complexes in vivo using animal models.

Our current work exploited two unique optical properties
of SWNTs - very strong Raman signals and very strong NIR
absorbance. We constructed a HER2 IgY-SWNT complex
by covalently functionalizing SWNTs with anti-HER2 IgY
antibody to impart to SWNTs the high specificity and sensitivity of the IgY antibody. The resultant complex was
successfully used in vitro for both detection and selective
destruction of HER2-expressing breast cancer cells. Raman
signal from cancer cells was detected at the single-cell
level. A uniqueness of this dual-function agent is that it
does not require internalization by the cancer cells in

order to achieve the selective photothermal ablation, thus
offering the advantage of being more easily extended to
other types of cancer cells. However, further research is
needed before these findings can be translated into clinical trials.
