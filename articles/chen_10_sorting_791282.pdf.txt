Abstract
Background: A ‘head-to-head’ (h2h) gene pair is defined as a genomic locus in which two adjacent genes are
divergently transcribed from opposite strands of DNA. In our previous work, this gene organization was found to
be ancient and conserved, which subjects functionally related genes to transcriptional co-regulation. However,
some of the biological features of h2h pairs still need further clarification.
Results: In this work, we assorted human h2h pairs into four sequentially inclusive sets of gradually incremental
conservation, and examined whether those previously asserted features were conserved or sharpened in the more
conserved h2h pair sets in order to identify the inherent features of the h2h gene organization. The features of TSS
distance, expression correlation within h2h pairs and among h2h genes, transcription factor association and
functional similarities of h2h genes were examined. Our conservation-based analyses found that the bi-directional
promoters of h2h gene pairs are most likely shorter than 100 bp; h2h gene pairs generally have only significant
positive expression correlation but not negative correlation, and remarkably high positive expression correlations
exist among h2h genes, as well as between h2h pairs observed in our previous study; h2h paired genes tend to
share transcription factors. In addition, expression correlation of h2h pairs is positively related with the TF-sharing
and functional coordination, while not related with TSS distance.
Conclusions: Our findings remove the uncertainties of h2h genes about TSS distance, expression correlation and
functional coordination, which provide insights into the study on the molecular mechanisms and functional
consequences of the transcriptional regulation based on this special gene organization.

Background
A ‘head-to-head’ (h2h) gene pair is defined as a genomic
locus in which two adjacent genes are divergently transcribed from opposite strands of DNA, and, the region
between the two transcription start sites (TSSs), commonly shorter than 1000 bp, is termed the ‘bi-directional promoter’ [1,2]. H2h gene pairs have been found
to be a unique gene arrangement in vertebrates, particularly in human genome [2,3]. Recent studies have been
characterizing the sequential features of the bi* Correspondence: yxli@scbit.org; yyli@scbit.org

directional promoters [4,5], exploring the co-regulation
pattern among h2h gene pairs [6], and investigating
their functional relevance such as that with tumorigenesis [6,7]. Taken together, these findings seem to echo a
preliminary conclusion we made in 2006 [3]: “the headto-head gene organization is ancient and conserved,
which subjects functionally related genes to correlated
transcriptional regulation and thus provides an exquisite
mechanism of transcriptional regulation based on gene
organization.” However, there is still some doubt or
uncertainty on specific features of h2h gene pairs to be
resolved by close-up investigations. For instance, we
observed in our previous study that pairs with TSSs
separated 1- to 400- bp apart formed the peak columns
in the TSS distance distribution, and we anticipated a
compression of these columns to a narrower or sharper

region. Although we did witness a significant inflation of
rat h2h pairs in the 1- to 400- bp TSS distance group
during a three-year update, we still could not affirm
how long a bi-directional promoter most optimally is.
For another example, we observed positive, negative,
and alternative expression correlation between h2h
paired genes, but negative correlation was not confirmed
by peer studies [2,4], and a novel opinion came up that
significant expression correlation may exist among h2h
genes (not necessarily within pairs) [4]. Other aspects of
h2h gene pairs, such as their transcriptional regulation
and function coordination, are still ambiguous to some
extent.
In the present study, we sorted previously asserted
features of h2h gene pairs, trying to remove these uncertainties and identify the inherent features of this gene
arrangement. Based on a commonly accepted principle
that evolutionarily conserved facts are by all means associated with biological significances [8], we believed that
the more conserved head to head gene pairs, of greater
biological importance, must more likely represent the
inherent features of h2h gene pairs. Therefore, we
assorted human h2h pairs into four sets of incremental
conservation in vertebrates, and sorted out inherent features of vertebrate h2h gene pairs by comparing the
four h2h pair sets on a series of points. We gave comprehensive analyses on h2h pair features including TSS
distance, expression correlation nature, transcription
factor association, and functional coordination, and provided unambiguous judgment on specific features
according to their evolutionary conservation. This study
provides useful clues for the mechanism study on the
transcriptional regulation of the h2h gene organization.

Methods
Data sources

According to DBH2H [9](http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/h2h/),
we determined human, chicken, and fugu H2h gene
pairs, and the TSS Distances of each pair. Expression
correlation data were downloaded from two sources:
DBH2H [9] (http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/h2h/) and COXPRESdb [10](http://coxpresdb.jp/).
Transcription factor association of h2h gene pairs was
enabled by the integrated transcription factor platform
[11] (ITFP, http://itfp.biosino.org/itfp/), which maintains
both experimentally verified TFs and in-silico predicted
TFs.
Annotation of Gene Ontology (http://www.geneontology.org) terms of h2h genes was aided by Bioconductor
packages org.Hs.eg.db 2.3.6 and GO.db 2.3.5.
Expression correlation of head-to-head gene pairs

From DBH2H, we got Pearson and Spearman expression
correlation data of human h2h gene pairs on 43 public

datasets respectively; from COXPRESdb, we got the
Pearson expression correlation value, as well as a relative correlation index MR (Mutual Rank) [12], for each
of all possible pairs among 19777 human genes. COXPRESdb data were calculated from gene expression profiles across 3749 human samples.
Specifically, MR is defined as the geometric mean
of the reciprocal relative expression correlation
ranks with respect to the two genes of a pair:
MR(A,B)= Rank(A → B) × Rank(B → A)

(A and B

stand for two genes).Additionally, we calculated another
relative expression correlation index RR (Relative Rank),
defined as RR(A,B)=min(Rank(A->B),Rank(B->A)).
Wherever one single expression correlation value was
used for summarizing an h2h pair set, we performed the
average operation over all COXPRESdb values of the
set. A total of 1447000 (1447*1000) of random gene
pairs and 5252 same-strand adjacent pairs involving
2835 h2h genes were determined for control. Their
expression correlation values were also taken from the
COXPRESdb data.
With DBH2H expression correlation data, we determined for each h2h pair the significant correlations with
the corresponding p-values lower than 0.05. As the significant correlations could be positive or negative, we
got three total numbers respectively: SP, SN, and SP
+SN. Dividing the three total numbers with the number
of investigated datasets separately, we obtained the SPR
(Significant Positive Ratio), SNR (Significant Negative
Ratio), and SR (Significant Ratio), representing the proportion of significant positive correlation, significant
negative correlation, and significant correlation of an
h2h pair, respectively. Note that SPR+SNR=SR. When
different sets of h2h pairs were compared in terms of
expression correlation level, we reported the average
SPR, SNR, or SR of each set.
Functional similarities between head-to-head paired
genes

The Gene Ontology (GO) [13] annotation system was
used to annotate h2h genes. In GO system, a gene can
be annotated to more than one functional term, and it
is common to see one gene annotated simultaneously in
three GO subsystems. When both genes are annotated
in a same GO category, we judged that this gene pair
was annotated by the GO category. The Lin semantic
measure [14], derived from Resnik’s GO term similarity
measure [15], is a normalized index ranging between 0
and 1. Resnik’s similarity measures relies on the notion
of the so-called minimum subsumer t of two GO terms
t1 and t2, which is the lowest common ancestor in the
GO hierarchy. Its information content ICms , which is

the Resnik semantic similarity measure between t1 and
t2, is given by Equation 1. Here Pa(t1, t2) denotes the
set of all common (also indirect) ancestors shared by
GO terms t1 and t2, and IC(t) is defined as the negative
logarithm of the probability of observing term t (p(t)). P
(t) can be technically approximated by the number of
genes annotated to term t. Finally, the Lin semantic
similarity measure is determined through normalizing
the Resnik measure to the range between 0 to 1 (Equation 2).

The calculations of functional similarity were performed using the GOSim [16] package, version 1.2.1.1
(http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GOSim/index.
html) in the R environment (http://www.r-project.org/) .
We also calculated the functional similarity of random
pair sets with the same size of annotated h2h gene
pairs, with iteration 100 times.

Results and discussion
We studied head-to-head gene organization in vertebrates by selecting fugu rubripes, gallus gallus, mus musculus, and homo sapiens genomes as the representative
vertebrate phylogeny. Fugu has the shortest known genome (~365 Mb) of any vertebrate species - around one
eighth of the size of the human genome [17], therefore
roughly representing the start-point of the vertebrate
phylogeny. The chicken has a genome of 1.2 Gb,
approximately 40% of the size of the human genome,
and is the premier non-mammalian vertebrate model
organism [18]. Mouse and human are two of the most
well-studied mammalian model animals, and, in contrast
to fugu, they approximately represent the end-point of
the vertebrate phylogeny. Based on data downloaded
from DBH2H [9], 1447 human h2h gene pairs were
assorted into four sequentially inclusive sets: set H,
including all 1447 human pairs; set HM, including 191
pairs conserved between human and mouse; set HMC,
including 77 pairs conserved across human, mouse and
chicken; set HMCF, including the 14 pairs conserved
across human, mouse, chicken and fugu. The four sets
of human h2h pairs with gradually increasing conservation levels were compared in terms of genomic TSS distance, expression correlation, transcriptional factor
association, and functional similarity. In each analysis,
we firstly compared the feature of the largest set H and
that of a randomly sampled gene pair set or a set of
‘adjacent’ gene pairs composed of h2h genes and their

adjacent genes. If a statistically significant difference
between set H and the random set (or the adjacent set)
was observed, we furthermore compared the feature
between the four h2h pair sets, and relied on two-group
t-tests or wilcoxon rank-sum tests to decide whether
there was statistically significant difference between the
different conservation levels. If a feature was validated
in both stages of statistical tests, we declared it was an
inherent feature of the h2h gene organization; if a feature was not validated by either stage, or if it showed
contrary trend in the conservation-based test, we tentatively negated it. If a feature had significant difference
between set H and the random set (or the adjacent set),
but did not display significant difference, in consistent
directions, between the different conservation levels, we
postponed the related declaration to future studies
where hopefully expanded data would lead to an unambiguous conclusion
H2h pair with 1-100 TSS distance probably has a
functional bi-directional promoter

Given the TSS distances of all h2h pairs in hand, we
examined the TSS distance distributions of the four h2h
pair sets in a comparative manner. We found that nonoverlapping h2h pairs separated by less than 400 bp
formed the majority of the four sets (Table 1), resonating the earlier observation of human, mouse, and rat
h2h pairs [3]. Remarkably, the peak TSS distance interval in HMCF was (0, 100], different from the counterpart peaks (100, 200] in H, HM, and HMC (Table 1 and
Figure 1), and a gradually incremental trend of the proportion of the four h2h gene pairs (from set H to set
HMCF) located in (0, 100] was statistically significant
(chi-squared test, p=0.001). This result accorded with
our previous guess that ‘the peak column (101 to 200
bp) in the TSS distance distribution might actually
move somewhat to the left or be much sharper’ [3].
Considering another fact that the core promoter [19],
or the minimal portion of the promoter required to
properly initiate transcription, is confined to 100 bp
region upstream of a TSS, we have increased confidence
in that the h2h pair with their TSSs separated 1-100 bp
most likely has a functional bi-directional promoter,

which has biological relevance to the co-regulation of
the two genes. As we witnessed a compression of TSS
distances of rat h2h pairs between two batches of analyses [3,9], we anticipated an impending replacement of
the then peak column (100, 200] by (0, 100] in future
data updates.
We also related TSS distance with expression correlation of the h2h paired genes, but found no significant
relationship between them, no matter in set H or in the
more conserved set HM, HMC and set HMCF. Even if
we studied the overlapping and non-overlapping h2h
pairs separately, we still did not detect any correlation
between TSS distance and expression correlation. Hence,
we stuck to our postulation that a bi-directional promoter tend to coordinately regulate the transcriptions of h2h
paired genes in a TSS distance-unrelated manner [3].

Significant positive expression correlation within h2h
pairs and among h2h genes

Based on the expression correlation data obtained from
COXPRESdb [10], we compared the expression correlation level among the four h2h pair sets. There measures,
Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Mutual Rank
(MR) and Relative Rank (RR), were used to evaluate
gene coexpression level (see Methods). It was found that
the PCCs within h2h gene pairs were significantly higher
than those of random pairs (two-group t-test p<0.05),
and higher than same-strand adjacent pairs involving
h2h genes too (two-group t-test p<0.05); the similar
results were observed for MR and RR as well (twogroup t-test p<0.05 for h2h vs. random and h2h vs. adjacent comparisons). Furthermore, the PCCs and MRs
were increasing and decreasing, respectively, with the

conservation level. These comparisons were visualized in
Figure 2.
The coexpression strengthening with conservation
level was also revealed in DBH2H data (Table 2). As
DBH2H [9] provides dataset-specific expression correlation values of h2h pairs, we were able to know the Significance Ratio (SR) of each h2h pair, which represented
the fraction of datasets in which an h2h pair was significantly correlated (p<0.05 for a specific correlation coefficient). As revealed in Table 2, one notable fact that on
average an h2h pair of set H had a SR of around 50%
(Pearson correlation coefficient) indicated a remarkable
tendency of transcription co-regulation between h2h
paired genes, and this tendency was further supported
by the other fact that the SR statistic was increasing
with the conservation level (Table 2). The trend was
similar for Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients (Table 2). Taking together the results from COXPRESdb and DBH2H, we approved a significant
tendency of transcription coordination between a pair of
h2h genes. In addition, as the median RRs of h2h gene
pairs were quite small (4.5 for HMCF, 102 for HMC,
137.5 for HM and 190 for H), we infer that the

strongest correlation associated to an h2h gene probably
exists between this gene and its h2h pairing partner.
Furthermore, we examined whether negative correlation is an inherent feature of h2h gene pairs. We first
noticed that, in COXPRESdb, set H had a smaller fraction of gene pairs with negative expression correlation
than random pair set and adjacent pair set (chi-squared
test, p<0.01), and the fractions in sets HM, HMC and
HMCF were even smaller (0.02 in HM, 0 in both HMC
and HMCF). Additionally, the average correlation values
separately for positive and negative correlation of each
h2h pair were examined according to DBH2H [9]. Interestingly, we observed a stable increment in positive correlation between the four h2h sets, but no similar trend
in negative correlation. Moreover, we discerned a
remarkable preponderance of positive correlation over
negative correlation, as the Significance Ratios (SRs)
were mostly contributed by Significant Positive Ratios
(SPRs) (Table 2). The average ‘Significant Negative
Ratio’ (SNR) of h2h pairs, at any conservation level, was
lower than 10%, and it even decreased a little from set
H to set HMCF (Table 2). A more typical decreasing
trend was found with the average proportion of datasets
showing negative correlation (data not shown). This
indicated that negative correlation was quite likely not
an inherent feature of the h2h gene arrangement, in
accordance with a previous claim that there was no evidence for negative expression correlation of a significant
number of gene pairs [20].
It was proposed that expression correlation may happen not only within h2h gene pairs, but also across different h2h pairs [21]. To verify this hypothesis, we
determined all possible gene pairs within the scope of
h2h genes while purposely excluded the actual h2h
pairs, and checked their average COXPRESdb PCC and
the average MR at the four conservation levels. We saw
that PCC was steadily increasing while MR was steadily
decreasing with the conservation level (p<0.001, Wilcoxon tests), and that both statistics in all four h2h sets

were significantly different from the counterpart statistics of random gene pairs (Figure 3, Wilcoxon test,
p<0.01). Moreover, we inspected expression correlation
between h2h genes and the other genes that are not
involved in the h2h arrangement. It was found that the
expression correlation at all conservation levels were
very close to random gene pairs (data not shown).
In summary, our conservation-based analyses validated
the significant positive coexpression tendency within
and between h2h gene pairs, but negated the universal
existence of negative expression correlation of h2h pairs.
The intra-pair expression correlation level seems higher
than the inter-pair one. A further study on the roles of
h2h genes in coexpression networks is still going on.
High expression correlation owes to shared transcription
factors

Despite the consensus that h2h gene pairs are often cotranscribed, the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of
h2h gene pairs remain unclear. Lin et al [4] addressed this
issue by discriminating over-represented and under-represented transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) from bidirectional promoters. We wanted to complement their

work by emphasizing the transcription factors (TFs) which
potentially regulate h2h genes.
We tried associating TFs to human h2h genes (within
set H) based on the experiment and computation-based
ITFP database [11] and the experiment-based TRANSFAC database. Through ITFP, we determined 207 ‘TFassociated h2h gene pairs’ of which the two h2h paired
genes were both associated to TFs; this number was by
far larger than that obtained through TRANSFAC. By
adopting ITFP, therefore, we achieved an optimal tradeoff between data size and credibility.
Of these 207 TF-associated pairs, 168 shared no common TF, 18 shared one common TF, and 21 shared
more than one common TFs (Table 3). Comparing the
expression correlations among the four groups of TFassociated pairs, we found that the groups with more
common TFs consistently displayed higher expression
correlation (Figure 4A). As a matter of fact, we observed
a positive correlation between the expression correlations and TF similarities of the 39 TF-sharing h2h pairs,
provided that TF similarity was defined as the fraction
of shared TFs in the union TFs (Figure 4B). It was
noted that the proportion of TF-sharing pairs within
TF-associated pairs, 18.8%, was statistically higher than
12.4%, the counterpart statistics from same-strand adjacent pairs at p<0.05. Projecting the 207 TF-associated
h2h gene pairs into the three conserved h2h pair sets
HM, HMC and HMCF, we obtained 64 in set HM, 30
in set HMC, and 5 in set HMCF (Table 3). As Table 3
showed, the TF-sharing pairs accounted for an increasing fraction of the TF-associated pairs as the conservation level increased. In sets HM and HMC, we also
noted a possible positive relationship between expression correlation and TF-sharing, although the p-values

or more TFs (3rd boxplot) displayed a significantly higher expression correlation than those with only one common TF (2nd boxplot): mean

were not significant, possibly due to the minimal sample
sizes (data not shown).
In addition, there were seven h2h pairs in which one
gene was a TF regulating the other one (Table 4). These
self-regulating h2h pairs demonstrated rather high
expression correlation, even higher than the group of 39
TF-sharing h2h pairs (two group t-test p=0.0004).
According to our results, h2h paired genes tend to
share TFs, and the TF sharing degree is positively correlated with expression correlation. Sharing regulators
seems to be a universal characteristic of h2h gene pairs
which partially explains the significant positive expression correlation between h2h paired genes.

Functional similarity analysis of h2h gene pairs

Based on gene function classification system Gene
Ontology (GO) [13]), we determined GO-annotated h2h
pairs for the three subsystems of GO respectively (“Biological Process” or BP, “Molecular Function” or MF, and
“Cellular Component” or CC), and these annotated pairs
were projected in all four h2h sets of different levels of
conservation (Table 5). Note that an annotated h2h pair
is one having its both genes annotated in a common
GO subsystem, and the functional similarity (semantic
similarity) of each pair of h2h genes is measured using
the method proposed by Lin [14]. Since each pair of
genes was tagged with three semantic similarities calculated in the three GO subsystems separately, the maximum semantic similarity of the three was taken as the
representative functional similarity of an h2h pair.

Firstly, we found out that, in any GO subsystem, human
h2h gene pairs (Set H) manifested significantly higher
functional similarity than random pairs (Wilcoxon test,
P<0.01); the same conclusion was drawn when compared to same-strand adjacent pairs in subsystems CC
and BP (Wilcoxon test, p<0.05). And the average functional similarities in BP and CC in set HMCF were
higher than those in set H (Table 5). However, functional similarity in MF dropped with the conservation
level (Table 5). Secondly, we noted a significant correlation between functional similarity and expression correlation of human h2h paired genes (R=0.177, p-value=
1.044e-05). As Table 6 showed, h2h gene pairs with
higher expression correlation were associated with
higher functional similarity, and this phenomenon was
conserved in sets HM, HMC and HMCF. We particularly pointed out that the correlation between functional
similarity and negative expression correlation degenerated (R=0.01, see Additional file 1), which was possibly
another evidence negating the negative expression correlation of h2h gene pairs.
Taking the above two points together, there seems to
be a functional similarity between h2h organized genes
and a correlation between the functional coordination
and the expression correlation. In all, through sharing
bi-directional promoters, h2h gene pairs tend to be
coexpressed and their products tend to perform similar
functions. As we previously proposed, similar to operons
in bacteria, h2h gene arrangement is an economic and
ingenious strategy in eukaryotes to achieve coordination
between functionally related genes.

Conclusions
In this work, using recently accumulated genomic and
expression data, we systematically re-examined the
diverse features of head-to-head gene pairs previously
proposed [3] and verified the features inherent in the
h2h gene arrangement based on the evolutionary conservation. On a whole, most discoveries or hypotheses
made in the previous work were confirmed: the functional bi-directional promoters of h2h gene pairs are
most likely shorter than 100 bp; h2h paired genes show

significantly high positive expression correlation; h2h
paired genes are involved in related functions and the
functional similarity is positively correlated with gene
pair expression correlation. However, negative expression correlation is probably not an inherent feature of
h2h gene pairs. As an additional discovery, we found
that the expression correlation among all h2h genes
(not necessarily forming h2h pairs) are higher than the
background level, indicating that h2h genes in aggregate
may subject to shared regulatory program. We further
demonstrated that each h2h gene pair statistically tends
to share common transcription factors, which in part
explains the unusually high expression correlation
among h2h genes.
Our present findings resolved the uncertainties on
TSS distance, expression correlation nature, and functional coordination of h2h gene pairs, which may benefit
future studies on the transcriptional regulation mechanism and the biological significance of h2h gene pairs.
Additional file 1: Functional similarity of negatively correlated gene
pairsThe Supplementary Table 1 contains the functional similarity of
negatively correlated h2h gene pairs. The PCC between “Functional
similarity” and “PCC” were merely 0.01.
