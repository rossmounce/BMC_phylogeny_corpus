information

Results: Using the Distiller package, the ESTs were assembled to roughly 48,000 contigs and 73,000 singletons, of which
approximately 25% have a high confidence match to UniProt. Approximately 6,000 new porcine gene clusters were
identified. Expression analysis based on the non-normalized libraries resulted in the following findings. The distribution
of cluster sizes is scaling invariant. Brain and testes are among the tissues with the greatest number of different expressed
genes, whereas tissues with more specialized function, such as developing liver, have fewer expressed genes. There are
at least 65 high confidence housekeeping gene candidates and 876 cDNA library-specific gene candidates. We identified
differential expression of genes between different tissues, in particular brain/spinal cord, and found patterns of
correlation between genes that share expression in pairs of libraries. Finally, there was remarkable agreement in
expression between specialized tissues according to Gene Ontology categories.

interactions

Background: Knowledge of the structure of gene expression is essential for mammalian transcriptomics research. We
analyzed a collection of more than one million porcine expressed sequence tags (ESTs), of which two-thirds were
generated in the Sino-Danish Pig Genome Project and one-third are from public databases. The Sino-Danish ESTs were
generated from one normalized and 97 non-normalized cDNA libraries representing 35 different tissues and three
developmental stages.

Conclusion: This EST collection, the largest to date in pig, represents an essential resource for annotation, comparative
genomics, assembly of the pig genome sequence, and further porcine transcription studies.

Background

The porcine genome has been characterized intensively
through development of linkage maps, comparative maps,
and physical maps [1,2] and Humphray and co-workers
(unpublished data). These studies highlight the importance of
genome research in pigs. Study of the porcine genome is
important from the perspective of achieving sustainable
breeding; also, the porcine model is an important research
platform because of the anatomic, physiologic, biochemical,
and metabolic similarities to humans. We recently showed
that the evolutionary distance between the porcine and
human genome sequences is smaller than the distance
between mouse and human [3]. This provides a rationale for
use of porcine sequences in gene expression comparisons
with human and in transcriptome analysis of multiple tissues
and organs [4,5] because, in contrast to human, there is easy
access to tissues from the pig, including tissues from various
embryonic developmental stages.
Here, we present an expression study based on 35 tissues represented by 98 cDNA libraries, of which 97 are non-normalized. For the assembly, more than one million expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) were used, of which approximately twothirds were generated in this study and the remaining onethird of ESTs are from public databases. The assembly not
only contributes to identification of potential novel genes
associated with specific tissues but it also allows us to address
the key issue of gene expression structure in tissues. Furthermore, it is possible to search for genes that are expressed in a
wide range of tissues, including genes that are of importance
to embryonic development, because 24 of the 98 libraries
used in the study are from various developmental stages.
Gene discovery and gene expression are key objectives of
most genome projects, and consequently large-scale EST
sequencing projects have been conducted for many organisms, including human, mouse, rat, chicken, frog, zebrafish,
fruit-fly, and plants [6-22]. ESTs and full-length cDNAs provide direct information on the transcriptome and indirect
information on the relation between the genome and different phenotypes. Because only about 25% of all protein-encoding mammalian genes have been characterized [23], a major
current task in genomics is to characterize the functional
importance of individual genes within the context of their
interactions with other genes.
The transcriptome of a particular species can be analyzed by
sampling a large number of ESTs from cDNA libraries, which
are constructed from different tissues, or tissues from different developmental conditions or physiologic stages. Compared with characterization of normalized or subtracted

cDNA libraries depleted of the most abundant transcripts,
which optimizes discovery of novel genes [24-26], studies of
non-normalized cDNA libraries are much more redundant
but they provide raw information on the structure of gene
expression levels [27].
To our knowledge the data presented here represent one of
the largest collections of tissues ever included in a single EST
expression study, and this makes it possible to conduct tissuewise comparisons of the levels of expressed genes. Therefore,
the generated pig EST resource represents an essential tool
for the annotation and assembly of the forthcoming pig
genome sequence, and it is a valuable resource for mammalian functional genomics research. The data presented here
are also expected to have significant impact on efforts such as
the Pig EST Data Explorer (PEDE) [28], which compiles fulllength porcine cDNA sequences based on EST assembly. The
resource makes it possible to compare coexpression patterns
between organisms, for example between human, mouse, and
pig. The PigEST resource, which is available online [29], contains a backend SQL database of clusters and singletons, as
well as supplementary statical data files.
Below, we first describe the structure of gene expression in
individual porcine tissues, and we find that the expression
and the cluster sizes are scaling invariant. Then we show that
brain and testes have greater gene diversity than any of the
other tissues studied. Finally, we demonstrate that the established expression profiles represent the biologic function of
the individual tissues.

Results
EST sequences and cDNA libraries
The analyses presented here are based on 1,021,891 porcine
EST sequences, of which 636,516 were extracted from the
Sino-Danish (SD) resource and 385,375 from GenBank [30].
These sequences were the result of initial rounds of cleaning
(see Materials and methods, below). The SD EST sequences
were generated from 98 cDNA libraries covering 35 tissues
listed in Table 1 (97 non-normalized and 1 normalized [Pla]).
For details concerning RNA extraction and library construction, see Materials and methods (below). No effort has been
made to ensure that precisely matched cell populations are
sampled from individual tissue when these tissues are represented by more than one cDNA library. Thus, two libraries
representing the same tissue might, to some extent, differ in
terms of expression.

The generated cDNA libraries, representing 35 tissues. They are here shown as two (overlapping) sets: a physiologic set and a developmental set. The column 'Lib name' gives
three letter code for the library. 'Tissue' indicates the overall tissue the library was generated from, where '(Animals)' indicates whether the library was generated from a single
(S or B) or multiple (M) animals. Libraries listed with (M) and (S) represent the pig breeds (mostly cross-breeds) used in Danish breeding (Landrace, Yorkshire, Duroc, and
Hampshire), whereas the libraries listed with (B) present Chinese pig breeds. 'Description' provides a short description. The column 'Reads' shows the number of reads that
went into that library after cleaning. The sum of all 'Reads' corresponds to the number of generated reads that contributed to the assembly, that is the number of reads after
cleaning vector, repeats, and so on. Library names beginning with 'C' originates from Chinese pig breeds (except for 'Col' and 'Cbe'), whereas the remaining libraries originated
from Danish pig breeds. aDevelopmental tissue. bIgnored in expression analysis (see Materials and methods). cLikely to be heavily contaminated by liver expressed sequence

Accessing the porcine transcriptome: the assembly
The sequences were assembled using the 'Distiller package'

clusters and 73,171 singletons (single reads). The sequences
from the SD resource are present in 35,344 contigs, of which

6,388 contigs were constructed solely from our resource.
There are 13,285 contigs composed of public sequences that
do not contain any of the ESTs generated in our resource, and
in addition the public EST sequences are also present in
42,241 contigs. Hence, although there are about 380,000

In agreement with the observation for each library, we also
observe a scaling invariant cluster size distribution for clusters representing ESTs from libraries and public sequences,
as shown in Figure 1. The slope is less than is observed for the

We considered the distribution of cluster sizes within each
library (data not shown) and consistently observe, within one
order of magnitude, that the number of cluster sizes is scaling
invariant. Interestingly, this is also the case for the normalized library (Pla). When a library is normalized only the
amount of highly expressed genes is reduced; the scaling
properties are maintained (Figure 1). The normalized library
has a steeper slope (on a log-log plot) than do the other
libraries.

reviews

All expression patterns extracted in this work are based on
comparing cluster sizes relative to library sizes (see Materials
and methods, below), in conjunction with the extent to which
a library is represented in a cluster. Fundamental to this process is the underlying distribution of expression, which we
address as follows. We have sampled a large but non-exhaustive number of ESTs from each library (Table 1). Hence, we
have sampled ESTs from each (non-normalized) cDNA
library in the regime, where the absolute read count for each
gene is proportional to the sampling size. Assuming that the
assembly method can merge all reads from the same genes
into the same cluster, then the cluster size is proportional to
the total sampling size. This means that the cluster size within
a single library is a measure of the expression of the corresponding gene it represents.

comment

public ESTs and 685,000 ESTs from the SD resource, the
public sequences represent more genes than does our collection. This is to be expected because our data were generated
from non-normalized libraries to provide raw expression profiles from different tissues, whereas many of the publicly
available ESTs were generated from normalized libraries (for
instance, see the reports by Hillier [31] and Scheetz [32] and
their coworkers). This is also illustrated by the number of singletons. The SD resource yielded 26,429 singletons, whereas
the public ESTs comprise 46,742 singletons. The Distiller
assembly program also predicted 6,896 clusters to contain at
least one chimeric sequence; such information can be useful
when one is manually inspecting clusters. Furthermore, Distiller marked 430 clusters as groups of sequences linked by
unknown or undetected repetitive elements, and about 2,500
clusters as representing alternative splice variants. These
clusters were retained in the analysis conducted here. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are in part used by Distiller to phylogenetically decompose clusters into smaller
clusters either of recently duplicated genes or, in some cases,
of sequences originating from Chinese breeds and Danish
breeds. In-depth analysis of SNPs combined with manual
curation will be reported in another paper [33].

The table list the number of hits to given databases with various levels of matching for clusters and singletons. The cutoffs for given match level are
indicated in terms of alignment identity (ID) and subject coverage (Sbj) for UniProt and the noncoding RNA databases (ncRNAdb). Only match levels
up to M2 (alignment length larger than 30 nucleotides) for ncRNAs are included (counting each contig/singleton only once) and the matches have
been cleaned for tRNAs because these appears to be the most frequent RNAs from contamination, such as E. coli. A curated list of ncRNAs for levels
M0 and M1 can found in Additional data file 1 (Table S1). Also see text for details. It should be noted that a few conreads match the same UniProt
ID. This can be due to phylogenetic decomposition or single reads not being assembled. The total number of contigs was 48,629; the number of
singletons was 73,171.

individual libraries, which we interpret as resulting from the
impact of the less redundant public sequences. As observed,
even ESTs from normalized libraries exhibit scaling invariance, and when merging EST data from multiple sources one
should still expect a scaling invariant distribution of cluster
sizes, although they are no longer a direct measure of
expression.
In essence, the scaling invariance tells us that large clusters
are rare and small clusters are common, and that the few clusters that are already large tend to become larger when new
reads are added to the pool of sequences being assembled. In
a separate study we constructed a simple model of simulation
of the assembly process that can lead to scaling invariance,
and we also observe scaling invariance for EST assemblies
from other organisms using other assembly methods, for
example tgicl [34] (Schiebye-Knudsen and coworkers,
unpublished data). Hence, only when one considers data
from a non-normalized library does the cluster size (number
of ESTs) for a gene correspond to the level of expression of
that gene, and the slope is an approximate measure of the
gene diversity of the library.

Similarity match to existing sequences
To obtain information about contigs and single reads (hereafter referred to as 'conreads') from sequence similarity, the
conreads were BLASTed against SwissProt and TrEmbl (UniProt 47.3) [35] for the protein search and against RNAdb
(version August 2004), Fantom3, Rfam (version 7.0), and the
MicroRNA registry (version 7.0) [36-39] for the noncoding
RNA (ncRNA) search.
For protein comparison we searched for matches with high
subject sequence (UniProt) coverage, as illustrated in Table 2.
Here, we introduce various match levels from M0 to M5,
where M0 is full-length subject coverage with at least 98%

sequence identity. In Table 2, the number of sequences above
the various match levels is indicated. From among the top 30
reported BLAST hits, we included the first match with the
highest obtainable match level (which in the great majority of
cases was the first reported BLAST match). For comparison
with UniProt, we found 2,155 conreads with full subject coverage. We found 12,886 high confidence matches (M0 to M4)
for contigs and 2,614 high confidence matches for the
singletons.
When identifying ncRNAs, it is important to note that the
RNA was enriched for poly(A) mRNA molecules by oligo(dT)
selection. Interestingly, even though we masked for large and
small ribosomal RNA and removed reads shorter than 100
nucleotides, we still observe small-sized RNAs such as tRNAs,
U RNAs, and small structural elements. For example, some
tRNAs are found in their surrounding sequence context. We
also found 5.8S ribosomal RNAs as well as telomerase RNA.
To obtain an indication of the amount of ncRNAs and elements of RNA structure (eleRNAs), an initial filtering was
conducted up to level M2, counting each contig or singleton
only once and ignoring tRNAs. The distribution for the match
levels can be found in Table 2. The candidates at the match
levels M0 and M1 were further curated, and we found 53
unique (non-tRNA) M0 or M1 matches to ncRNA or eleRNA,
using in this case a minimum alignment length of 30 nucleotides. Hence, even good matches to mature microRNAs were
ignored. The resulting matches are listed in Additional data
file 1 (Table S1). Among the findings are 11 microRNA hairpins, of which four have already been predicted to be porcine
microRNAs [3], and evidence of expression is hereby provided. None of these ncRNAs appears to have a particular tissue specificity.

the scaling invariant cluster size distributions for the
libraries.

Not surprisingly, we observe that top10 to some extent correlates with the diversity, because a high top10 value correlates
with low diversity. Furthermore, we also observe a slight
decrease in hk80 for the libraries where the diversity

information

To further address the variance of the gene expression level in
the different cDNA libraries, we also considered the percentage of reads being among the 10 most expressed contigs in a
library. This is indicated by 'top10' in Figure 2. Although this
measure indicates the variance of gene expression within a
library, it is also relevant to compare the fraction of reads that
are among the most common contigs, that is, those contigs
that are expressed in a large number of libraries (housekeeping genes; see below). In Figure 2 'hk80' for each library indicates the fraction of reads that are part of a contig that is
expressed in more than 80 libraries (in total 65 contigs; for
details, see below). This measure makes it possible to compare expression levels of the genes relative to a common reference.

interactions

The expression profiles of the individual SD cDNA libraries
were examined to identify libraries containing the greatest
number of different genes. That is, for each library we compared the number of conreads with the total number of reads
from the library (after cleaning). We refer to ratio between
these numbers as the 'diversity' of the library. Hence, high
diversity means that only a small number of reads could be
merged into contigs (low redundancy). In Figure 2 we show
the rank of diversity. Brain and testes tissues are among the
libraries with the greatest diversity, together with placenta,
which was expected because it is a normalized library. The
same observation is maintained when we average across
libraries representing a tissue (data not shown) and is in
agreement with reported observations in human and mouse
[40,41] (and references therein). Among the libraries with
low diversity, we find early developmental stages of liver and
lung tissue as well as mammary gland, all three representing
tissues with specialized and restricted functions. However,
adult liver (Liv) has relative high diversity, reflecting a physiologically active tissue. These diversity observations appear
to be in agreement with the observation of different slopes on

Figure 2
Diversity of cDNA libraries
Diversity of cDNA libraries. The libraries (x-axis) are ranked according to their diversity (blue dot on y-axis). The names of the libraries on the x-axis
correspond to those listed in Table 1. The diversity of a library is computed as the number of conreads in which the library has at least one read included,
divided by the total number of reads present in the library. (See Materials and methods, in the text, for further details.) Two additional measures are
included as well. 'top10' (green dots) refers to the fraction of reads comprising the 10 most expressed contigs in that particular library. 'hk80' (red dots)
refers to the fraction of reads representing the 65 housekeeping candidates expressed in more than 80 libraries listed in Additional data file 1 (Table S2).
Brain and testes libraries are among the most diverse. These also appear as the most diverse from the average diversity for each of the 35 tissues (not
shown). Note that the normalized library Pla is among the most diverse tissues, as one would expect a normalized library to be.

increases. This is not surprising because increased diversity
will cause the fraction of reads of any contig to decrease. However, the placenta (Pla) library has very low hk80, in
agreement with the fact that it is a normalized library. There
are other libraries with very low hk80, including Ctl, Cbr, and
Cbl, all libraries that were discarded from the expression
analysis because of bias in the data (see below). For the part
of the libraries with low diversity, top10 is in general higher
than hk80, which is in contrast to libraries with high
diversity.
To ensure that the diversity was not an artefact resulting from
the different library sizes, we compared the diversity against
the library size and found that these do not correlate, as the
Pearson's correlation coefficient has a value of -0.21. The
impact of differences in diversity is further reflected in the
number of BLAST matches for a given cDNA library. We
investigated diversity as a function of the percentage of
conreads that have a BLAST match (M0 to M4) and obtained
a correlation coefficient of -0.64; this indicates that the
greater the number of different genes expressed in a library,
the larger the portion of them that appears to be novel or
alternatively spliced (data not shown).
Differences in diversity are also reflected in the amount of
common contigs between libraries. For example, a relatively
large fraction of contigs from brain tissues can also be found
in almost all other tissues, whereas only a small fraction of
contigs from the other tissues is present in brain tissues (data
not shown). In a number of cases we observed that more
diverse libraries share a relative large portion of their
expressed genes with all of the other libraries, whereas for
less diverse libraries only a small portion of expressed genes
are represented in the libraries with high diversity.
To ensure that the libraries had representative unbiased
expression, we pruned a few libraries for which the fraction of
(UniProt) matched contigs was unusually low. From the distribution of these fractions (Additional data file 1 [Figure S1]),
the libraries Ctl, Cbr, Pan, Cbl, and Mgm are clearly separated
in the low end from the remaining libraries, suggesting some
problems with library construction (for instance, RNA degradation). This was further supported by manual inspection of
the most highly expressed clusters for some of the libraries.
For example, in the Ctl library the contig Ss1.1rpigcf0_016260.5, which did not have any significant match
to UniProt, appears to have a large number of reads clustered
in the 5' end.

Clustering of cDNA libraries and library gene content
The raw expression values (read count) were normalized with
respect to library size and then with respect to the level of
each contig across all libraries with accumulated values (see
Materials and methods, below). For each pair of cDNA libraries we computed the euclidian distance between the expression values for all of the contigs represented with at least four

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/4/R45

reads in both libraries (see Materials and methods, below). A
conservative cutoff of four reads ensured that significant
expression was present in both libraries. This conservative
cutoff yielded 4,776 contigs. Furthermore, for each pair of
compared libraries, genes with expression values more than
one standard deviation away from the center of mass value
were also discarded. For each obtained value the average distance of all pairs was subtracted. These were clustered using
the method of Eisen and coworkers [42] through the available
software made by deHoon and coworkers [43]. We applied
numerous combinations for hierarchical clustering. In general, we find that libraries from the following (adult) tissues
cluster together: brain/spinal cord, testis, muscle/heart, and
intestine. These tissues are represented by relatively many
different genes either through high diversity of few libraries
(brain/spinal cord and testis) or low diversity in many libraries (muscle/heart and intestine).
To further analyze potential differential expression in normal
tissues, we explored expression within the following three
groups: brain/spinal cord, muscle/heart, and intestine. The
main reason for considering only a fraction of the libraries
and a fraction of the genes (expression subtables) is that relatively few gene clusters are represented in all libraries, as
shown in Figure 3. We conducted a hierarchical clustering on
data under the restricted requirement that all clusters must
be represented in at least 10 libraries with at least four read
counts (data not shown). From this it was possible to extract
examples of genes with correlated expression such as the
ribosomal proteins shown in Additional data file 1 (Figure S2
[A]). Furthermore, we found pairs of libraries sharing genes,
in which the relative expression of the genes in the libraries is
constant (see Additional data file 1 [Figure S2(B)] for an
example).
Differential expression for the brain/spinal cord, muscle/
heart, and intestine groups was also investigated using a more
relaxed criterion of requiring a count of at least two reads, but
requiring that gene clusters are present in at least 35% of the
libraries. We also included expression from libraries constructed from tissues sampled at different developmental
stages. This constituted the 658 genes in the brain/spinal
cord group, 605 genes in the muscle/heart group, and 588
genes in intestine group, covering 1,231 different gene clusters (contigs). Within each of these groups expression for
each gene cluster was normalized across all libraries (including absence of expression for a given library, counting it as
zero) and hierarchical clustering was conducted for genes versus libraries. In all cases we find groups of genes that are differentially expressed between the different libraries. The
brain/spinal cord group is shown in Figure 4. Note that the
different libraries within the same or related tissues potentially represent different cell populations of these tissues and
different physiologic stages. We see cases in which gene clusters are present in only a minor proportion of the libraries,
and we observe clear cases of differential expression for each

The pattern of clustering in Figure 4 has a clear biologic
explanation, which applies primarily when one is studying
tissues such as brain, for which the sampling procedure from
the different parts of the brain in the different developmental
stages was well defined. In contrast, the sample collection
from the intestinal tissues and muscles was not specifically
defined; thus, in regard to some of the libraries the cellular
components potentially vary considerably. In brain we see a
clear pattern of clustering by developmental stage; for
instance, Ecc, Ebs and Ece are clustered, and Fcc, Fhi and Fbs
are clustered. These two groups of libraries correspond to dif-

of these genes. Hence, we observe genes that are differentially
expressed in normal tissues and between different developmental stages, for example cerebellum (Cbe and Fce). Similar
types of observations were made for muscle/heart and intestine groups (data not shown).

As mentioned above, not all gene clusters are represented in
all libraries. This complicates expression analysis, but it is of
interest when describing how many libraries are represented
in a given gene cluster (given that the EST sequences were
sampled from non-normalized libraries). As indicated in
Figure 3, we observe scaling invariant-like behavior, which is
in agreement with the scaling invariance observed for cluster
sizes (Figure 1). In essence, clusters with reads from a large
number of libraries are much more rare (by order of magnitude) than are clusters with reads from a small number of
libraries. Therefore, considering a cluster by chance it is more
likely to find it expressed in only a few libraries. The really
large clusters that deviate from this behavior could be due to
extraordinarily high levels of transcription (represented by
housekeeping genes) and alternative splice variants being
merged into the same cluster. For example, we find only 65
contigs to be expressed in more than 80 libraries (of the 92
remaining after cleaning), as shown in Additional data file 1
(Table S2). Approximately 40% of these genes are ribosomal
proteins, which is not surprising because they are essential
components of the cellular machinery. Clearly, these genes
can be considered housekeeping genes, but the scaling
invariant-like behavior shown in Figure 1 makes it clear that
genes expressed in many libraries are less likely to be sampled
from all libraries (with the current EST sampling strategy).

ferent parts of the brain at developmental stage 50 days and
developmental stage 107 days, respectively. The clustering
was further inspected with respect to expressed genes. For
instance CROC-4, a transcriptional activator of c-fos, was
identified in the cluster of genes specific to the 50-day-old
fetal brain libraries. This gene has been described as being
expressed in early development of the brain and is involved in
cell proliferation and differentiation [44]. Large numbers of
ribosomal proteins and hypothetical proteins were also
observed in these brain libraries. The high number of hypothetical proteins (novel genes) is in agreement with the observation of high gene diversity in the brain libraries. Also, in
accordance with these observations, in general we observed a
large amount of ribosomal proteins in the libraries from tissues sampled in early developmental stages (data not shown).

Table of the used primers and their corresponding polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions for the eight selected genes for which quantitative
PCR (qPCR) was carried out. The column 'PigEST name' indicates the name of contig. 'Gene name' is the gene name of the selected genes according
to UniProt match. 'Oligo sequence (5' to 3')' is the oligonucleotide sequences used in the qPCR experiment. 'Amplicon length' is the length of the
amplified product in the qPCR. 'Tm' indicates the annealing temperature used in the qPCR.

We therefore underestimate the number of housekeeping
genes, when these housekeeping genes are defined as genes
present in all libraries at some minimum level of
transcription.

Library-specific genes
We (conservatively) selected cDNA library-specific gene candidates as follows. The libraries with the two highest levels of
expression for a given transcript were compared, and it was
required that the library with the highest level of expression
had a read count of at least 10 reads, regardless of the library
size. Then, we computed the probability of observing the
counts for the highest expression value, given the observed
counts of the second highest using the work of Audic and
Claverie [45], and required this to be less than 0.05 (see
Materials and methods, below). In cases in which only a single library had high expression, the 'second highest' count
was set to zero whereas the library size was set to the smallest
library size in the dataset.
We obtained a list of 876 gene clusters, to which we assigned
corresponding BLAST matches if available; 676 of these gene
clusters had a match of at least M4 to UniProt. The top 50 in
the list is shown in Additional data file 1 (Table S3); the complete list is available online via the download area of the
PigEST resource [29]. Note that this list contains genes that
can be specific in one of multiple libraries from the same tissue. This can be explained by the fact that no effort has been
made to ensure sampling of precisely matching cell populations from the individual tissue. The expression profile of the
genes belonging to the top 50 'tissue-specific gene list' listed
in Table 3 was manually inspected and compared with UniGene at NCBI [46]. The gene names used in UniGene were
those from the description line of the best matching BLAST
hit (regardless of the match level) of the top 50 list (Additional data file 1 [Table S2]). The comparison was done with
human data when available and otherwise with mouse or cattle data. In 25 cases the tissue (in which a given library spe-

cific gene was found) in which the corresponding gene was
highly expressed was in agreement with the public data. In 14
cases there was not enough expression data to draw any conclusions. In 11 cases the published results did not agree with
our findings. However, considering only the most confident
BLAST matching contigs (M0 level only), 16 cases agreed with
UniGene, four cases had insufficient data, and six did not
agree. Hence, for more than 70% (16/22) of UniGene matching M0 cases, we found agreement in expression.
We also observed three cases in which the discrepancies pertain to expression of liver-specific genes in the Lun library,
which points toward a possible contamination of this library
with liver. Further inspection of the library confirms the presence of high levels of liver-specific genes. Furthermore, real
time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis
was performed on eight selected genes from additional inhouse tissue (see Materials and methods, below). These genes
were as follows: pepsinogen c, vitamin D-dependent calciumbinding protein, fetuin B, gastrotropin, pepsinogen A precursor, myelin basic protein, surfactant protein-C, and troponin
C (also see Materials and methods, below). In seven cases the
qPCR results were in agreement with in silico results. In one
case (the gastrotropin gene [Ss1.1-rill310b_f20.5; Table 3]),
the greatest expression was found in thymus, which in our in
silico study was positioned as the second tissue in which this
gene is most highly expressed.

Expression characterization by top level Gene
Ontology terms
To address the issue of functional representation of each
library, we constructed Gene Ontology (GO) profiles [47] at
the top level for each of the three main classes: 'molecular
function', 'cellular component', and 'biological process'. The
roughly 10,000 conreads that had a BLAST match to UniProt
of M0 to M3 were analyzed. Profiles were constructed for
each library and compared in terms of the fraction of expression content for each of the top categories within the three

classes. Profiles for each cDNA library can be found in Additional data files 2 to 4, in which the normalized library Pla
(Placenta) is included for comparison. On initial inspection
the content of most libraries appears uniform. However,
when the libraries are compared in greater detail differences
are found. For each library we computed the log odds ratio (in
bits) between the observed fraction of a subcategory (for
instance, 'binding' within 'molecular function') and the average fraction taken over all libraries. Heat maps were constructed for each of the main categories.

Furthermore, we also looked for correlations between expression patterns, and we found a handful of cases of correlating
categories (|cc| > 0.63); examples are shown in Additional
data file 1 (Figure S3) for 'transcription regulator activity' and
'translation regulator activity'. Other examples include 'physiological process' and 'regulation of biological process' as well

These findings are in agreement with the molecular function
of the individual tissues, confirming that the expression

For the other main GO category, 'biological process' (Figure
5b), we made the following observations. With regard to 'biological process', tissues such as testes and uterus are highly
over-represented in the category 'reproduction', and almost
all other libraries are highly under-represented. Muscle
libraries are over-represented in the 'development' category,
and stomach and uterus are over-represented in the
'behavior' category. For the main GO category, namely 'cellular component' (not shown), we find that fat and skin are
over-represented in 'extracellular matrix'. A direct correlation
between expression and function is clear in regard to 'reproduction' and 'extracellular matrix'. However, because some of
the categories are quite broadly defined, a direct correlation
to tissue physiology is not clear-cut for all categories.

interactions

In Figure 5 heat maps for 'molecular function' and 'biological
process' are shown. The libraries are ordered as in Table 1,
and libraries within the same tissue are listed adjacent to each
other. Figure 5a shows log odds ratios for 'molecular function'; we observe that some tissues have over-representation
of some categories, as indicated by the coloring and ellipsoids.
We find that muscle libraries have an over-representation of
the category 'motor activity', and almost all other libraries are
under-represented in this category. Muscle libraries are also
clearly over-represented in the category 'molecular function
unknown'. The liver and uterus libraries are clearly over-represented in the categories 'enzyme regulator activity'. Kidney
is over-represented in the category 'antioxidant activity'. The
mammary gland libraries are over-represented in the category 'transporter activity'. Finally, skin libraries are (slightly
but consistently) over-represented in the 'structural molecule
activity' category.

profiles of the libraries are in agreement with the physiology
and the function of the individual tissues. Furthermore, the
two categories that constitute approximately 50% of expression (Additional data file 2), namely 'binding' and 'catalytic
activity', do not in general vary much relative to their average
fraction. It is worth noting that all of the tissues exhibiting
over-representation of a specific GO category are tissues that
in general do not have very high diversity and tissues that also
have relatively specific functions.

well, for example the categories 'cellular process' and 'physiological processes' are strongly correlated in the 'biological

Discussion

We present a resource of more than one million porcine EST
sequences, of which two-thirds were generated for the work
presented here and the remaining one-third of EST sequences
were extracted from public databases. The sequences from
our PigEST resource were extracted from 97 non-normalized
cDNA libraries and one normalized cDNA library representing in total 35 tissues. We have conducted an initial expression analysis, providing novel insight into the structure of a
large-scale set of EST sequences from non-normalized libraries of normal tissue and tissue sampled at various developmental stages. The assembly resulted in approximately
48,000 contigs and 73,000 singletons. Out of these a total of
2,155 contigs was identified with full-length coverage and
high confidence match to UniProt; in addition, 12,886 contigs
and 2,614 single reads were found with high confidence
matches. Thus, using stringent criteria, about 25% of our contigs and singletons were matched with high confidence. In
addition, we also identified approximately 50 noncoding
RNAs, including 11 microRNAs (of which four were found
previously in genomic sequence [3]).
We conducted an extensive analysis of gene expression structure in tissues. We found that the assembled clusters led to
the observation that expression and the cluster sizes are scaling invariant, an observation that is in agreement with the
observed scaling invariance of microarray expression data
(for example see the reports by Hoyle [48] and Lu [49] and
their coworkers). The results indicate that large clusters (high
expression) are rare, whereas small clusters (low expression)
are common.
To identify the tissues containing the most different genes, we
compared library sizes with the number of conreads. We
found that the tissues brain and testes have higher gene diversity than the other tissues. This is in accordance with the
observation that the most diverse libraries have steep slopes
in their scaling invariant cluster size distributions. Furthermore, in agreement with this, we observed that high-diversity
tissues in general have a lower percentage match to UniProt,
indicating that libraries representing these tissues are suitable for finding novel genes or alternatively spliced genes (not
assembled into the same contig).
A major challenge was to extract meaningful expression patterns from the EST libraries. To provide the most reliable
starting point for these studies, we removed libraries with
biased expression patterns. It is most likely that there are still
a few artificial expression patterns in the remaining clusters,

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/4/R45

in particular among the genes in the tissue-specific gene list.
However, we found that only a constant fraction of gene clusters (contigs) can be expected to be present in all libraries.
The fact that not all gene clusters are represented in all libraries complicates the differential expression analysis across the
libraries. Nevertheless, we showed that meaningful
expression results could be extracted from the resource. First,
we showed that tissues represented by many libraries or
libraries with high diversity in general cluster together. Second, we found differential expression patterns within the tissues brain/spinal cord, muscle/heart, and intestine. These
tissues are represented by high-diversity or multiple libraries
involving approximately 1,200 gene clusters. In these libraries, manual inspection revealed that the expression patterns
of specific genes were in accordance with the biological function of the individual tissues.
Furthermore, we extracted 876 gene clusters as candidates
for cDNA library specificity, of which approximately 7% were
in libraries from a given developmental stage. The top 50 candidates were inspected manually, and it was found that our
results agreed with most of the corresponding expression
profiles available via UniGene (25 versus 11; 14 cases did not
have similar data). However, these numbers were 16 versus 6
for the best BLAST matching contigs (M0 level). We also conducted qPCR in eight selected genes, and found that their
expression profiles agreed with the corresponding expression
found in the EST study.
We also considered how often the contigs were expressed in a
given number of cDNA libraries. The distribution of these
data reveals a scaling invariant-like behavior, which appears
to be a novel observation. Thus, there is a fixed proportion
between the number of genes (contigs) expressed in many
libraries and those expressed in few. Hence, considering a
small number of libraries and tissues, there is no guarantee
that genes expressed in all libraries will also be expressed in
all libraries of a bigger sample. However, because we used 92
libraries covering 32 tissues in this study (poor quality and
normalized libraries being discarded), we cover a large proportion of all existing tissues. Therefore, we have high confidence in our housekeeping gene candidates list. It should,
however, be noted that because of the scaling properties, we
are probably missing many housekeeping genes, in particular
those expressed only at low levels.
We have found that the expression in related tissues correlates strongly and provided examples of correlation of expression between pairs of libraries sharing the same genes,
indicating functional relationships. When analyzing the portion of the data (about 10,000 contigs and single reads) with
good match to existing proteins in UniProt, we extracted
meaningful GO assignments of the libraries. For example, we
found that muscle libraries are over-represented in the 'motor
activity' category of 'molecular function', and that testes and
uterus libraries are strongly over-represented in the 'repro-

Tissues were collected from 200 pigs used in the Danish pig
production industry; breeds were cross-breeds from Landrace, Yorkshire, Duroc, and Hampshire. A Chinese breed,
Taihu/Erhualian, was also used. Tissues were immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen after sampling and were stored at 80°C until use. Some of brain tissues were kept in RNA buffer
(Ambion, Cambridge, UK) in order to prevent degradation.

qPCR experiments
In order to compare in silico based expression with qPCR
expression in tissues from a new set of pigs, we had to select
genes within the top 100 list to match tissue combinations
from the currently available in-house cDNA panel. Eight
genes were selected: pepsinogen c, vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein, fetuin B, gastrotropin, pepsinogen A
precursor, myelin basic protein, surfactant protein-C, and
troponin C. See corresponding contig names in Table 3. The
gene expression levels of these eight pig genes were measured
using real-time qPCR. A cDNA panel of 18 different pig tissues (bone marrow, liver, thymus, kidney, stomach, jejunum,
muscle, heart, cerebellum, cortex cerebri, hippocampus, lung,
pancreas, skin, bladder, lymph, testis, and ovary) from three
Landrace piglets was used for qPCR studies. The Ct values
were normalized with a normalization factor generated from

Materials and methods

The RNA used in the libraries Cag, Cga, Che, Cje, Cki, Cli, Cly,
Cmu, Cov, Csk, Csp, Cst, Cte, Cov, and Cut was extracted from
Chinese pigs using TRI REAGENT (Molecular Research
Center, Inc.). The RNA corresponding to these libraries were
sent to Denmark and the libraries were made. The RNA was
EtOH precipitated on arrival. RNA quality was checked by
optic density (OD) and agarose gel. The RNA corresponding
to the libraries Cli, Cga, Cov, Cly, Csp, and Cag contained
genomic DNA, and it was re-extracted using TRI REAGENT
before proceeding to the construction of the libraries in order
to eliminate the gDNA. The library construction and quality
criteria are as described before. In total 98, cDNA libraries
covering 35 tissues were constructed (Table 1).

reports

In conclusion, we have not only demonstrated that the established expression profiles not only represent the biologic
function of the individual tissues, but also we have provided
novel information about the gene expression structure of the
tissues. This resource [29] will be of importance for comparative transcriptomics, annotation of novel genes, and systems
biology.

The cDNA was size fractionated using Sepharose CL-2B, as
included in the library kit, or by agarose gel electrophoresis
followed by purification using Qiaex II Gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNA was ligated into EcoRI/XhoI digested
pBluescript II XR (Stratagene) or pTrueBlue (Alert B&C,
Quebec, Canada) using temperature-cycle ligation [50]
followed by PCR validation of the ligation reaction. The ligation product was precipitated and electro-transformated into
E. coli XL1-Blue MRF' (Stratagene) and plated on blue/white
selective LB agar, and positive clones were picked into 2xTY
(100 μg/ml Amp, 10% [vol/vol] glycerol) in 384-well plates
using a QPix2 robot (Genetics Limited, Norwich, UK), incubated for 24 hours at -37°C, and stored at -80°C until use. The
insert length of each library was evaluated in 192 clones by
PCR. Quality criteria was set at a maximum of 8% colonies
without insert and a maximum of 10% to 20% with inserts
less than 400 base pairs (with the exception of the brain
libraries, for which the latter was set at 20%).

reviews

There are many obvious directions in which this work can be
continued. It is relevant, for instance, to conduct a comparison with porcine UniGene [46]. More detailed studies of
expression profiles will provide new information about the
mammalian transcriptome and will provide new functional
information with regard to individual non-annotated transcripts. As expected, sequencing of non-normalized cDNA
libraries has resulted in a high level of redundant transcripts.
It has, however, also resulted in new information about diversity in individual tissues. Because the greatest diversity is
found in brain and testes, it is clear that additional sequencing of ESTs from these tissues is expected to provide novel
transcripts.

three reference gene's expression ratios (ribosomal protein
L4 [RPL4]; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1
[HPRT1], and β-actin [ACTB]) and calculated using geNorm
[51].
The Primer3 software [52] at MACROBUTTON HtmlResAnchor [53] was used for primer design. Two primers were
designed covering around 100 base pairs of each cDNA for the
eight selected genes and the three reference genes (Table 3).
A standard curve was constructed using the purified PCR
product generated for each specific primer pair. Single reactions were prepared for each cDNA, along with the standard
curve and a nontemplate control using the Brilliant r SYBR r
Green Master Mix (Stratagene). Each reaction consisted of 20
μl containing 2 μl of one-eighth diluted cDNA and 5 to 20
pmol of each primer. The real-time reverse transcription PCR
was performed using a Mx3000 detection system (Stratagene). The cycling conditions were one cycle of denaturation
and hot start at 95°C/15 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95°C for 30 s, 60-63°C for 1 min, 72°C for 30 s) and
one three-segment cycle of product melting (95°C for 1 min,
55°C for 30 s, and 95°C for 30 s). The baseline adjustment
method of the Mx3000 (Stratagene) software was used to
determine the crossing thresholds (Ct).

Data extraction and cleaning
In total, 970,404 raw chromatogram files were generated in
the SD resource. Those meeting the criteria were uploaded at
the NCBI trace archive and are avaliable upon searching
using the center name 'SDJVP' (Sino-Danish Joint Venture
Project) and dates from 16 July to 31 July 2006. The contiguous ranges of accession numbers are summarized in Additional data file 1 (Table S4).
The plate archives and files were examined for duplicates,
misplaced and erroneously packed plate archives, and erroneously named trace files. Where possible naming errors
were corrected, and for different reads with identical names
the latest generated were chosen over earlier ones. Here, the
970,404 raw chromatogram files were processed using phred
(-trim alt "" -trim cutoff 0.01) and phd2fasta [54,55], which
yielded 823,871 files containing sequences. Then vector
sequences from Univec (Kitts and coworkers, unpublished
data) were removed along with linker (XhoI) sequence.
Resulting sequences with length less than 100 nucleotides
were also removed. This resulted in 685,851 reads. These
were repeatmasked in the assembly process using the Distiller package (see below).
The databases used for repeatmasking and vector cleaning
were from Univec, namely ribosomal sequences 18S pig (gi
52694694) and 28S human (gi 337381). The latter because
there were no full 28S sequence available for pig in GenBank
[30]. The porcine mitochondrial genome sequence (gi
33320837) was included as well. Finally, in order to remove
repetitive segments the following libraries from RepBase

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/4/R45

were used [56]: simple.lib, alu.lib, at.lib, carnivorecut. lib,
carnivore.lib, cetartiocut.lib, cetartio.lib, cut1.lib, cut2.lib,
humlines.lib, humsines.lib, humspec.lib, l1.lib, mir.lib,
mirs.lib, othermamreps.lib, retrovirus.lib, rod1.lib, rod2.lib,
rodcut2.lib, rodcut.lib, and rodcutsines.lib. Removing
repeatmasked sequences from the dataset reduced the dataset to 636,516 sequences.
The dataset was extended with 398,837 EST sequences downloaded from GenBank (the Entrez nucleotide database) [30],
searching Organism and EST Database Division using the following terms: 'Sus scrofa[ORGN]' AND 'gbdiv est[PROP]'.
After cleaning, this set was reduced to 385,375 sequences.
Hence, in total 1,021,891 EST sequences were analyzed.

Assembly
To assemble the EST sequences we used the Distiller assembly program, which was used in another large-scale EST
project conducted in Xenopus tropicalis [15] (see details in
that report). Briefly, the Distiller program first conducts a
pair-wise comparison of all sequences using BLAST. Then,
sequences are clustered, but with a requirement of double
linkage for sequences added to the clusters. This lowers the
chance, for example, of mis-assembly of ESTs from two genes
into a single cluster through a chimeric sequence. In a later
stage, clusters are joined using a more relaxed linkage criteria. Consensus sequences are constructed from sets of adjacent 12-mers over the aligned sequences in the given region.
After a first round of assembly, the clusters were phylogenetically decomposed to separated close gene family members.
Furthermore, Distiller detects SNPs, alternative splice variants, and chimeric sequences. At an early stage in the project,
from among other assembly programs, we also applied the
tgicl package [34]. This was applied before inclusion of the
public sequences, and the observations on diversity and pairwise correlations of GO categories were essentially the same
as presented in the Results section (above). However, because
of the features of Distiller, including the double linkage clustering and alternative splicing predicting (applied elsewhere),
we found it more suitable to apply this program here.

Expression levels of genes

To obtain GO [57] information for selected contigs of match
levels M0 to M3 to UniProt, the GO annotation [47] was
downloaded and fed into an SQL database, which allowed
easy extraction of the data. We worked with the top level
within each of the three main categories 'biological process',
'cellular component', and 'molecular function'. For each of
these main categories, GO expression profiles were
constructed as follows. The expressions of each of the top categories of 'molecular function' ('biological process' and 'cellular component') were accumulated and normalized into
fractions. A pie chart of frequencies for each library was made
and shown in Additional data files 2 to 4. We also computed
an average pie chart for 'molecular function' ('biological process' and 'cellular component' respectively) and used it as the
expected portion of a randomly chosen category. For each
library we computed log odds ratios of the GO categories
between the actual pie and the average pie. The log odds values for each main category in 'molecular function' ('biological
process' and 'cellular component') were also considered for
libraries grouped into corresponding tissues and over-representation of functional features, in accordance with the tissue
functions identified.
