Abstract
Background: Colobine monkeys constitute a diverse group of primates with major radiations in Africa and Asia.
However, phylogenetic relationships among genera are under debate, and recent molecular studies with
incomplete taxon-sampling revealed discordant gene trees. To solve the evolutionary history of colobine genera
and to determine causes for possible gene tree incongruences, we combined presence/absence analysis of mobile
elements with autosomal, X chromosomal, Y chromosomal and mitochondrial sequence data from all recognized
colobine genera.
Results: Gene tree topologies and divergence age estimates derived from different markers were similar, but
differed in placing Piliocolobus/Procolobus and langur genera among colobines. Although insufficient data,
homoplasy and incomplete lineage sorting might all have contributed to the discordance among gene trees,
hybridization is favored as the main cause of the observed discordance. We propose that African colobines are
paraphyletic, but might later have experienced female introgression from Piliocolobus/Procolobus into Colobus. In
the late Miocene, colobines invaded Eurasia and diversified into several lineages. Among Asian colobines,
Semnopithecus diverged first, indicating langur paraphyly. However, unidirectional gene flow from Semnopithecus
into Trachypithecus via male introgression followed by nuclear swamping might have occurred until the earliest
Pleistocene.
Conclusions: Overall, our study provides the most comprehensive view on colobine evolution to date and
emphasizes that analyses of various molecular markers, such as mobile elements and sequence data from multiple
loci, are crucial to better understand evolutionary relationships and to trace hybridization events. Our results also
suggest that sex-specific dispersal patterns, promoted by a respective social organization of the species involved,
can result in different hybridization scenarios.

Background
With more than 50 species and due to some ecological
adaptations, such as a ruminant-like chambered stomach
to digest food rich in fiber, the Old World monkey subfamily Colobinae represents a diverse and enigmatic
group of primates [1,2]. Colobines are predominantly
arboreal and occur in forest and woodland habitats.
They have experienced two major radiations, one in
Africa with the genera Procolobus, Piliocolobus and

Colobus, and a second in South and Southeast Asia
comprising the langur genera Semnopithecus, Trachypithecus and Presbytis, and the odd-nosed monkey genera Rhinopithecus, Pygathrix, Nasalis and Simias [2].
However, their phylogenetic relationships are disputed
[3-7], and recent molecular studies detected substantial
gene tree discordance [8-10].
Traditionally, African and Asian genera are believed to
form reciprocally monophyletic groups [1,2,11,12],
though paraphyly has also been proposed [3-5]. Molecular investigations clearly confirm a common origin of
Asian colobines and the odd-nosed monkey group
[8-10], but evidence for monophyly of the langur group
as well as for African colobines is still lacking.

Moreover, nuclear and mitochondrial data indicate conflicting relationships among langur genera, and between
langurs and the odd-nosed monkeys [8-10]. While
nuclear data consistently link Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus to the exclusion of all other Asian colobines
[9,10], mitochondrial data either do not resolve these
relationships [9] or suggest a clade consisting of Presbytis and Trachypithecus [8].
Incongruent phylogenetic relationships among genes,
like those detected among colobines are common in
phylogenetic studies and could be explained by homoplasy, insufficient data, nucleotide composition, differential lineage sorting, or hybridization [13-21]. To
ascertain which of these possibilities are responsible for
the incongruence, information from various independent
molecular loci can be helpful [22]. To date, only mitochondrial and X chromosomal data as well as presence/
absence information of mobile elements, all based on an
incomplete taxon sampling, are available for comparative phylogenetic studies in colobines [8-10,23]. Among
all marker systems, mobile element insertions are a promising tool to uncover phylogenetic relationships
among colobine genera. Compared to sole sequence
data, mobile elements such as Short Interspersed Elements (SINEs) and Long Interspersed Elements (LINEs)
exhibit advantages which make them ideal markers for
phylogenetic reconstructions (for review see [24-30]).
Accordingly, mobile elements are successfully applied in
numerous primate phylogenetic studies [9,28,31-39].
In our study, we examined the presence/absence pattern of mobile elements and compared the inferred phylogeny with those derived from mitochondrial and
nuclear sequence data (in total ~30,000 bp per genus).
We extended available X chromosomal and mitochondrial genome data, and sequenced de novo five autosomal loci that map to different human chromosomes,
and six Y chromosomal loci from all ten colobine genera. By combining results from different marker systems,
we provide detailed insights into the evolutionary and
biogeographic history of colobine monkeys, and show
that different hybridization mechanisms might have
been involved during the colobine radiation.

Results
Nuclear phylogeny

Eighty-three mobile elements are phylogenetically informative for colobines (Figure 1A, Additional file 1). Each of
the following clades is strongly supported by at least five
integrations: all colobines (clade I [A-I]), Asian colobines
(A-IV), odd-nosed monkeys (A-VII), Trachypithecus and
Semnopithecus (A-V), and Nasalis and Simias (A-IX).
Three integrations were found in Piliocolobus and Procolobus and all Asian colobines (A-II), but not in Colobus.
Two insertions suggested a sister grouping of Procolobus

Page 2 of 13

and Piliocolobus (A-III), Presbytis and the odd-nosed monkeys (A-VI), and a basal position of Rhinopithecus among
the latter (A-VIII). Based on maximum-parsimony (MP)
bootstrap analysis, most relationships were strongly supported (≥95%). Only the Piliocolobus/Procolobus (A-III),
Presbytis/odd-nosed monkey (A-VI), and Pygathrix/Nasalis/Simias (A-VIII) clades gained relatively weak bootstrap
values (86%). Based on alternative tree topology tests, different positions of the Piliocolobus/Procolobus clade and
Presbytis among colobines were not rejected (P > 0.05),
while relationships other than the most likely one were
significantly rejected for all other taxa (P < 0.001, P < 0.05)
(Additional file 2).
Next, we performed phylogenetic analyses based on
the concatenated nuclear sequence dataset, including
five autosomal loci, six Y chromosomal loci and a fragment of the X chromosomal Xq13.3 region (see Methods for detailed locus description). We combined all
nuclear sequence data, because heuristic search methods
for individual loci produced no conflicting relationships
(Additional file 3), and partition homogeneity tests
revealed no significant difference in their evolutionary
history (Y chromosomal loci combined: P = 0.2939;
autosomal loci combined: P = 0.1543; all nuclear loci
combined: P = 0.3559). Nucleotide composition of studied species was similar (Additional file 4). Phylogenetic
reconstructions yielded identical and significantly supported branching patterns irrespectively of the applied
algorithm (MP, neighbor-joining [NJ], maximum-likelihood [ML], Bayesian) (Figure 1B, for a phylogram see
Additional file 5). Only the Pygathrix/Nasalis/Simias (BVIII) clade had lower support values (MP: 93%, NJ: 80%,
but ML: 98%, Bayesian posterior probabilities [PP]: 1.0).
The resultant tree topology was mainly congruent with
the mobile element-based phylogeny, but two cases of
incongruence were obvious. First, in the nuclear
sequence-based phylogeny, African (B-II) and Asian (BIV) colobine genera formed reciprocally monophyletic
clades and second, Presbytis represented a sister lineage
to the other Asian genera (B-V). According to alternative tree topology tests (Additional file 2), paraphyly of
African colobines with Piliocolobus/Procolobus being
closer related to Asian colobines than to Colobus as well
as various alternative positions of Presbytis among Asian
colobines were not rejected (P > 0.05). However, affiliations of Presbytis to either Semnopithecus or Trachypithecus were rejected (P < 0.001).
Estimated divergence ages from the combined nuclear
dataset (Table 1) and single loci (Additional file 6), both
based on an a-priori fixed tree topology as obtained from
mobile elements, differed slightly, most likely due to the
general low variability in the studied loci (Additional file 7).
However, estimates were in the same range suggesting that
loci evolve at similar evolutionary rates (Additional file 8).

Figure 1 Phylogenetic relationships among colobine and outgroup genera as inferred from different datasets. Panels refer to insertions
of mobile elements (A), combined nuclear sequence data (B), and mitochondrial genome data (C). Roman numbers are used as branch
identifiers and are discussed in the text. In A, numbers in flags represent the number of available mobile elements (black: colobine markers, grey:
non-colobine markers). In B and C, all nodes are significantly supported by ML and Bayesian reconstructions (≥95%, 1.0). Black and grey dots on
nodes indicate high (≥95%) and lower (<95%) branch support as obtained from MP (in A-C) and NJ (in B and C) reconstructions, respectively.
Bootstrap values <95% are presented at respective nodes. In C, first and second values refer to those obtained from reconstructions using
datasets mtDNA1 and mtDNA2, respectively.

According to our nuclear estimates, Colobus and Piliocolobus/Procolobus successively split off from Asian genera
10.93 million years ago (mya) and 10.73 mya, respectively
(for 95% highest posterior densities see Table 1). The latter
two separated 6.92 mya. In Asia, an initial split occurred
8.12 mya and led to a clade consisting of Trachypithecus
and Semnopithecus, and a group containing Presbytis and
the odd-nosed monkeys. Among the latter, Presbytis
diverged 7.96 mya and the odd-nosed monkeys began differentiating 6.43 mya. The most recent splits among Asian
genera occurred between Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus (2.56 mya) and between Nasalis and Simias (1.06 mya).
Mitochondrial phylogeny

Mitochondrial and nuclear datasets were not combined,
because the partition homogeneity test suggested that both
track different evolutionary histories (P = 0.0002). Thus,
mitochondrial sequence data were analyzed separately. For

both alignments (mtDNA1, mtDNA2; for details about
alignments see Methods), we observed a major shift in
nucleotide composition between colobine and non-colobine representatives (Additional file 4). Both alignments
produced identical and significantly supported branching
patterns among genera (Figure 1C, for a phylogram see
Additional file 5). Only the Pygathrix/Nasalis/Simias (CVII) and African colobine (C-II) clades gained low MP
(<50%, <50%, 56%, 62%) and NJ (<50%, <50%, 91%, 93%)
bootstrap values, but ML and Bayesian reconstructions
provided strong support for both nodes (96%, 100%; 1.0,
1.0). In principal, the tree topology was identical to those
obtained from mobile elements and nuclear sequence data.
However, as in the nuclear sequence tree, mitochondrial
data suggested African (C-II) and Asian (C-IV) colobines
as reciprocal monophyletic clades. Moreover, Asian
colobines further diverged into a lineage leading to the
odd-nosed monkeys (C-VI), a lineage comprising

Trachypithecus and Presbytis (C-V), and finally a lineage
with solely Semnopithecus, while the relationships among
these three lineages remained unresolved.
According to alternative tree topology tests, paraphyly
of African colobines with Piliocolobus/Procolobus being
closer related to Asian colobines than to Colobus was
rejected (P < 0.001, Additional file 2). Among Asian
colobines, relationships in which Trachypithecus and
Presbytis do not form a monophyletic clade were also
rejected (P < 0.001, P < 0.05), as well as a close relationship of Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus (P < 0.01). In
contrast, different positions of Semnopithecus among
Asian colobines were similarly likely (P > 0.05).
Divergence age estimates from mitochondrial data
were similar to nuclear estimates in case where identical
branching patterns were obtained (Table 1). According
to mitochondrial data, African and Asian colobine
lineages were separated 10.90 mya. In Africa, Colobus
represents the first split (8.47 mya), followed by the
divergence of Piliocolobus and Procolobus (6.58 mya).
The major Asian split leading to the three lineages Semnopithecus, Trachypithecus/Presbytis and the odd-nosed
monkeys occurred 8.91 mya. Trachypithecus diverged
from Presbytis 7.45 mya. The diversification of oddnosed monkeys into genera started 6.91 mya and ended
with the split between Nasalis and Simias 1.88 mya.
Inferring hybridization in the presence of incomplete
lineage sorting

To assess the possible reasons for the incongruence
between the nuclear and mitochondrial trees, we applied

the method proposed by Kubatko [40]. The method
assumes that incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) explains
observed gene tree incongruence to some extent, and
seeks to determine whether all variation in observed
gene trees can be explained by ILS alone, as modeled by
the coalescent process, or whether hybridization helps
to explain significantly more the observed variation.
Then, the Akaike information criterions (AIC) in each
model (may or may not include hybridization scenarios)
were compared to determine the best-fit model. For our
data, two possible hybridization events were hypothesized. The first involved Trachypithecus, with parental
taxa Semnopithecus and Presbytis, while the second
involved the clade containing Piliocolobus and Procolobus, Colobus and the ancestor of Asian colobines.
By comparing the results from models with or without
the hybridization events, the best-fit model (AIC =
3021.79, Figure 2F) was a tree in which Trachypithecus
is the result of hybridization between Presbytis and Semnopithecus. The second best-fit model (AIC = 3023.57,
Figure 2I) comprised the tree that includes both tested
hybridization events. AIC values for all seven other
models were considerably higher (3072.25 - 4051.14).
Since AIC values for the scenarios presented in Figures
2F and 2I were the lowest and were within 2 of one
another, both were considered plausible explanations for
the observed gene tree discordances [41]. It is worth
pointing out that the model used here to compute the
AIC assumes that ILS is a possible source of gene trees
incongruence. Since the two best-fit models include at
least one hybridization event, it is clear that ILS alone

parameters in the model (k) is given as well as the AIC. The lowest AIC values are observed for trees F and I, which indicate a similar fit for
these scenarios.

does not adequately describe the extent of incongruence
in the observed gene trees.

Discussion
By combining presence/absence analysis of mobile elements with autosomal, X chromosomal, Y chromosomal
and mitochondrial sequence data, the present study provides comprehensive insights into the evolutionary history

of colobines. Most relationships are resolved and strongly
supported by mobile elements and sequence data. Moreover, relationships and estimated divergence ages as
obtained from different datasets are mainly congruent and
in agreement with earlier studies [8-10,23,42-45]. Our
study, however, also reveals significant discrepancies
among gene trees. First, mitochondrial and nuclear
sequence data suggest a monophyletic African colobine

Roos et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:77
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/77

clade, while mobile elements provide evidence for a closer
connection of the Piliocolobus/Procolobus clade to Asian
genera than to Colobus. Second, mobile elements indicate
close relationships between Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus, and between Presbytis and the odd-nosed monkeys. Nuclear sequence data support the former clade, but
suggest Presbytis as basal among Asian colobines. In contrast, in the mitochondrial phylogeny, Presbytis and Trachypithecus are displayed as sister lineages, while the
position of Semnopithecus remains ambiguous.
Possible explanations for gene tree discordance

Inadequate data, homoplasy, nucleotide composition,
ILS or hybridization could be potential explanations for
the observed differences [13-21]. For the mitochondrial
dataset, at least for the African and Presbytis/Trachypithecus clades, incorrect branching patterns due to
inadequate data or homoplasy are unlikely, since sufficient phylogenetic resolution with long internal
branches is obtained. Likewise, a shift in nucleotide
composition and differential sorting of ancestral mitochondrial lineages is implausible. Since the major shift
in nucleotide composition was detected between colobines and non-colobines, it cannot be responsible for
gene tree discordances among colobines. If the African
and Presbytis/Trachypithecus clades are indeed the
result of incomplete sorting of mitochondrial lineages,
the mitochondrial divergence between respective genera
should predate the nuclear splitting times, which is not
the case (African colobines: 10.93 mya nuclear vs. 8.47
mya mitochondrial; Presbytis - Trachypithecus: 8.12 mya
nuclear vs. 7.45 mya mitochondrial). However, the unresolved position of Semnopithecus among Asian colobines
might have been affected by one or several of the above
mentioned factors, or alternatively, might be the result
of a true radiation-like divergence of lineages. For
nuclear data, these factors are unlikely explanations as
well for the branching of Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus, because ten independent insertions and
sequence data from 12 nuclear loci clearly confirm their
close relationship. More challenging are explanations for
the discordant positions of Presbytis and the African
genera among colobines in phylogenies revealed by
mobile elements and nuclear sequence data. Mixed genomes due to differentially selected genes cannot be
excluded, but interestingly, both mobile elements and
nuclear sequence data (as revealed from single locus
analysis) show no conflicting phylogenies themselves.
Most prominent, however, the mobile element-based
phylogeny is not rejected by nuclear sequence data, indicating that insufficient informative sites, as also suggested by the low resolution of phylogenetic
relationships in single-locus analysis, in the latter dataset
might display incorrect relationships. For the integration

Page 6 of 13

of mobile elements, homoplasy is typically regarded as
minimal [25,28,30], but ILS has been reported [36,39].
Only two and three integrations support the branching
of Presbytis with odd-nosed monkeys and the paraphyly
of African colobines, and alternative relationships cannot be rejected statistically. However, no inconsistent
elements were detected and subtractive hybridizations
specifically set up to screen for African colobine and
Trachypithecus/Presbytis monophyly markers revealed
no equivalent insertions. Accordingly, ILS seems to be
an unreasonable explanation for our findings. Since the
mobile element-based phylogeny is not rejected by
nuclear sequence data and due to their reliability as
molecular-cladistic markers, the phylogeny suggested by
mobile elements is assumed to reflect the true nuclear
phylogeny of colobines, although we explicitly note that
mosaic genomes cannot be excluded.
Because all above-mentioned factors provide no sufficient explanation for the herein detected discordances
between mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies, we
favor ancestral hybridization as the main reason for the
discordant pattern. Furthermore, comparisons of models
with and without hybridization in a model selection framework strongly support hybridization in the presence
of ILS over models of ILS alone. In other words, even
after ILS was taken into account as a factor in the
observed incongruence among gene trees, we still found
support for hybridization in the evolutionary history of
these taxa. This refers at least to Asian colobines, but
hybridization among African colobines cannot be
excluded either by the method we applied here.
Hybridization hypothesis

Although bidirectional hybridization, which would be
indicated by mixed genomes, cannot be excluded with
our data, a female introgression event is hypothesized
for African colobines. The direction of gene flow
remains obscure due to the rapid diversification of the
colobine ancestor in Africa, but female introgression
from Piliocolobus/Procolobus into Colobus is indicated
and gains further support by some biological data [1,2].
In contrast to Colobus, females in Piliocolobus and Procolobus tend to leave their natal groups, which was most
likely also the case in their ancestor [1], and Colobus
males are on average larger than Piliocolobus and Procolobus males [1], thus increasing the chance of hybridization between Colobus males and Piliocolobus/Procolobus
females. Moreover, hybridization between both ancestral
lineages is in principal possible, because (at least nowadays) they occur in sympatry over wide ranges of their
distribution [1,2]. Accordingly, after the successive
separation of Colobus and Piliocolobus/Procolobus from
the Asian colobine ancestor, Piliocolobus/Procolobus
females might have entered Colobus populations and

Roos et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:77
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/77

hybridized with their males. Backcrossing of hybrid
females with resident Colobus males might has led to
the fixation of the Piliocolobus/Procolobus mitochondrial
lineage in the hybrid population, while the original
nuclear genome of Colobus increased again in every
generation.
For Asian langurs, we propose male introgression
from Semnopithecus into Trachypithecus followed by
nuclear swamping. Both genera are similar in their morphology and general appearance [2,46,47], but males in
Semnopithecus are larger than in Trachypithecus [1].
Moreover, hybridization events due to (at least nowadays) partially overlapping ranges are generally possible
[1,2]. Accordingly, after an initial separation, Semnopithecus males, which leave their natal group like most
other primate males [1,48], might have invaded Trachypithecus populations and hybridized successfully with
the resident females. By backcrossing with further invading Semnopithecus males over a longer period, the Trachypithecus population might have accumulated nuclear
material of Semnopithecus (nuclear swamping), while
the mitochondrial genome remained Trachypithecuslike.

Biogeographic implications

By combining the available information, we develop the following extended dispersal scenario for colobines (Figure 3).
The origin of the subfamily is most likely in Africa, which
is in agreement with earlier suggestions [1,49]. On the African continent, Colobus split off first from the main stem
~10.93 mya, followed shortly afterwards by the progenitor
of Piliocolobus and Procolobus. After this initial separation,
hybridization between both lineages might have lasted until
finally both mitochondrial lineages diverged (~8.47 mya).
Presumably, respective splitting and hybridization events
took place in western Africa, because all three genera occur
there in sympatry [1,2], and the most ancient splits among
Piliocolobus and Colobus species are also found there [45].
The Asian colobine ancestor most likely invaded Eurasia
via an emerging land bridge connecting Africa and the Arabian Peninsula in the late Miocene [49,50]. Whether a
route into eastern Asia north or south of the Himalayas
was chosen is a matter of speculation, but north of the
Himalayas, on the Tibetan plateau, colobine fossils from
the late Miocene were found, which is not the case south of
the Himalayas [1]. Although not confirmed, the Hengduan
Mountains in the border region of today’s Burma, India

Figure 3 Dispersal scenario for colobine monkeys. Colobines most likely originated in western Africa. After the successive split of Colobus
(~10.9 mya) and a progenitor of Piliocolobus/Procolobus (~10.7 mya) from the ancestor of Asian colobines, gene flow between both African
lineages via female introgression from the Piliocolobus/Procolobus progenitor into Colobus occurred until ~8.5 mya (displayed by red-dashed
arrow). During the late Miocene, colobines invaded eastern Asia most likely via a route north of the Himalayas. After their arrival at the
Hengduan Mountains, Asian colobines diversified into a lineage comprising a progenitor of the odd-nosed monkeys and Trachypithecus/Presbytis,
and of Semnopithecus, which later colonized the Indian subcontinent. Shortly afterwards, Trachypithecus/Presbytis split off from odd-nosed
monkeys, and migrated to southern mainland Asia, before finally both genera diverged from each other. In the region of today’s Burma,
Bangladesh and India, Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus came into secondary contact and hybridized until ~2.6 mya (displayed by red-dashed
arrow). In the latest Miocene, odd-nosed monkeys migrated from China to the south and expanded their range into Indochina and Sundaland.
Nasalis and Simias finally separated from each other 1.1-1.9 mya.

Roos et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:77

and China might have been a possible diversification hotspot [4,51,52]. In the region, all the larger Southeast Asian
rivers (Mekong, Salween, Yangtze) rise, which are all wellknown as barriers for arboreal primates [53] and are all
known to exist since at least the early Miocene [54]. Semnopithecus might have diverged as first lineage and invaded
the Indian subcontinent. Subsequently, the progenitor of
Presbytis and Trachypithecus separated from the odd-nosed
monkey ancestor and migrated into southern mainland
Asia. Afterwards, Presbytis diverged from Trachypithecus
and entered first the Malaysian peninsular and later on
Sundaland during periods of lowered sea levels [55]. Trachypithecus and Semnopithecus came into secondary contact and might have hybridized until the earliest
Pleistocene. A potential contact zone could be the region of
today’s Bangladesh, Burma and the northeast of India,
which is suggested as hybridization area for several primate
species [9,44,56]. On the Asian mainland, odd-nosed monkeys successively migrated from China to the south and
expanded their range into Indochina and Sundaland in the
latest Miocene. The migration into Sundaland was probably
via land bridges connecting the mainland with Sundaland
islands during periods of lowered sea levels [55]. Finally,
Nasalis on Borneo and Simias on the Mentawai islands
west of Sumatra diverged in the Pleistocene. Due to the
dating discrepancy (mitochondrial data: 1.88 mya, nuclear
data: 1.06 mya), further gene flow between both genera
after the initial separation cannot be excluded, especially
considering that migration was repeatedly possible via land
bridge connections during the Pleistocene [55].

Conclusion
Our study gives new and most comprehensive insights
into the evolutionary history of colobine monkeys, and
suggests hybridization among ancestral lineages as the
most likely cause for the observed phylogenetic incongruences. Only the combination of maternally, paternally
and bi-parentally inherited markers as well as the combination of sequence data with presence/absence patterns of mobile elements proved to be an adequate and
reliable phylogenetic approach, particularly in revealing
hybridization events. However, data from additional
nuclear loci and a broader taxonomic sampling is
required to fully understand hybridization mechanisms
in colobines.
Hybridization among taxa is traditionally recognized
as a factor leading to limited diversification, reproductive isolation and lowered fitness [57,58], whereas our
and earlier studies clearly indicate that hybridization
played a prominent role in diversification and speciation
of primates (for review see [59,60]). Hybridization events
are genetically confirmed within all major primate
lineages, mainly among species (e.g., [56,61-65]) but also
between genera (e.g., [9,44,66]). Even for the human

Page 8 of 13

lineage, hybridization has been suggested as an important evolutionary mechanism [67-69].
Since male dispersal and female philopatry predominates in primates [48], male introgression, and if intensive backcrossing of hybrids with more invading males
occurs, followed by nuclear swamping would be the
most likely hybridization scenario. In fact, the hybridization among Asian langur genera is most likely the result
of such an event. However, as proposed for African
colobines, alternative mechanisms (e.g. female introgression) could also occur, promoted by a respective social
organization, where female migration predominates.

Methods
Sample collection and DNA extraction

Blood, tissue or fecal samples from representatives of all
ten colobine genera (Colobus, Piliocolobus, Procolobus,
Presbytis, Trachypithecus, Semnopithecus, Rhinopithecus,
Pygathrix, Nasalis, Simias) and several non-colobine
taxa (Macaca, Papio, Theropithecus, Chlorocebus, Pongo,
Pan) were obtained from specimens kept in zoos or
breeding facilities, or collected in the field (Table 2).
Sample collection was conducted according to relevant
German and international guidelines, including countries where we collected samples. Fecal samples were
collected in a non-invasive way without disturbing,
threatening or harming the animals. Blood samples were
taken by veterinarians for diagnostic reasons to check

the health status of the respective individuals, and tissue
samples were obtained only from deceased specimens.
Total genomic DNA was extracted with the DNeasy
Blood & Tissue or QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kits from
Qiagen following standard procedures.
Analysis of mobile elements

Due to their high copy number (~one million) and relatively small size (~300 bp), the primate specific Alu elements were selected as molecular-cladistic markers. The
presence or absence of mobile elements in different
colobines at specific loci was tested via PCR using primers occupying the flanking region of the insertion site.
Details on analyzed loci, primers and presence/absence
pattern of mobile elements in studied species are listed
in Additional file 1. For most loci, sequencing was
neglected, but in relevant cases the insertion orthology
was confirmed by sequencing, and direct repeats flanking the insertion as well as the original target site prior
to transposition were traced.
In our study, we included published markers [9,23,35],
which were further examined in previously untested
genera, and newly detected integration loci (Additional
file 1). Therefore, we performed subtractive hybridizations following described methods [9]. To avoid biased
hybridization results, various species combinations were
used as tracer and driver (hybridization 1: tracer Nasalis/Pygathrix, driver Presbytis; hybridization 2: tracer
Nasalis/Pygathrix, driver Semnopithecus; hybridization 3:
tracer Trachypithecus/Presbytis, driver Pygathrix; hybridization 4: tracer Presbytis, driver Semnopithecus; hybridization 5: tracer Piliocolobus/Colobus, driver Pygathrix).
Besides Alu insertions, a LINE present in Piliocolobus
and Procolobus in the studied Xq13.3 fragment was
additionally applied as marker (Additional file 1).
Phylogenetic reconstructions using the MP algorithm
were conducted in PAUP v4.0b10 [70]. Presence of an
integration was coded as 1, its absence as 0, and missing
data as ‘?’. Internal node support was obtained via a
heuristic search with 10,000 bootstrap replications. To
evaluate the reliability of the depicted relationships
among colobines, various alternative tree topologies
(Additional file 2) were assessed with the Kishino-Hasegawa test [71] with full optimization and 1,000 bootstrap
replications in PAUP.
Amplification and sequencing of nuclear loci

Inter-exonic intron and exonic sequences were generated for six single-copy genes of the Y chromosome, five
autosomal loci, and a fragment of the X chromosomal
Xq13.3 region. With exception of the SRY gene (sexreversal, Y chromosome), all other Y chromosomal loci
(DBY5: Dead Box, intron 5; SMCY7: SMC mouse homologue, intron 7; SMCY11: SMC mouse homologue,

Page 9 of 13

intron 11; UTY18: ubiquitous TPR motif, intron 18;
ZFYLI: Zinc finger, last intron) have homologues on the
X chromosome (X degenerate). As autosomal loci, we
selected intron 11 of the von Willebrand Factor
(vWF11), located on human chromosome 12, intron 3
of the serum albumin gene (ALB3, human chromosome
4), intron 3 of the interstitial retinol-binding protein
(IRBP3, human chromosome 10), intron 1 of the transition protein 2 (TNP2, human chromosome 16) and
intron 1 of the transthyretin gene (TTR1, human chromosome 18). SRY, DBY5, SMCY7, SMCY11, UTY18,
vWF11 and a ~4,300 bp fragment of the Xq13.3 region
were amplified using primers and PCR conditions as
described [10,72-75] (Additional file 9). For the amplification of ZFYLI, ALB3, IRBP3, TNP2 and TTR1, new
primers (Additional file 9) were designed on the basis of
available primate sequences in GenBank. PCR conditions for the latter comprised a pre-denaturation step at
94°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles each with denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at varying temperatures (Additional file 9) for 1 min, and extension at
72°C for 2 min. At the end, a final extension step at 72°
C for 5 min was added. The results of all PCR amplifications were checked on 1% agarose gels. PCR products
were cleaned with the Qiagen PCR Purification kit and
subsequently sequenced on an ABI 3130 × l sequencer
using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit.
Alignments and sequences are available in TreeBASE
(http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:
S11179) and GenBank, respectively (for GenBank accession numbers see Additional file 10).
Amplification and sequencing of mitochondrial genomes

To reduce the likelihood of amplifying nuclear pseudogenes (numts), complete mitochondrial genomes from
four colobine genera (Rhinopithecus, Pygathrix, Nasalis,
Procolobus) were generated following an approach in
which two overlapping ~10,000 bp long fragments were
amplified via long-range PCR [8,43]. Due to degradation
of DNA extracted from faeces, the mitochondrial genome of Simias was amplified via five overlapping fragments, each with a size of ~5,000 bp. All long-range
PCRs were performed with the SuperTaq Plus polymerase from Ambion following protocols of the supplier
and primers as described [8,43]. Long-range PCR amplicons were separated on 1% agarose gels, excised from
the gel, purified with the Qiagen Gel Extraction kit and
used as template for nested PCRs. PCR conditions for
all nested PCR amplifications were identical and comprised a pre-denaturation step at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles each with denaturation at 94°C for 1
min, annealing at 60°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C
for 1.5 min. At the end, a final extension step at 72°C
for 5 min was added. Nested PCR products (900-1,200

bp in length) were cleaned with the Qiagen PCR Purification kit and sequenced on an ABI 3130 × l sequencer.
Sequences were assembled with Geneious v4.6.1 [76].
No inconsistent positions in overlapping regions were
detected and all protein-coding genes were correctly
translated. Annotation of mitochondrial genomes was
conducted with the online program DOGMA [77] and
manually inspected. Alignment and sequences are available in TreeBASE (http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S11179) and GenBank, respectively (for
GenBank accession numbers see Additional file 10).
Statistical analysis of sequence data

For phylogenetic reconstructions, all datasets comprised
17 sequences including each one representative of the
ten colobine genera (Colobus, Piliocolobus, Procolobus,
Trachypithecus, Semnopithecus, Presbytis, Rhinopithecus,
Pygathrix, Nasalis, Simias), four cercopithecine genera
(Papio, Theropithecus, Macaca, Chlorocebus), and three
hominoid genera (Homo, Pan, Pongo), which were used
as outgroup taxa. To complete datasets, we partly implemented sequences from GenBank (Additional file 10).
Alignments for individual loci were generated with
MAFFT v6 [78] and corrected by eye. In all alignments,
poorly aligned positions and indels were removed with
Gblocks v0.91b [79] using default settings (Additional
file 8). For the mitochondrial dataset, also the D-loop
region was excluded (dataset mtDNA1) and a second
alignment, generated in Mesquite v2.6 [80], included
solely protein-coding genes (dataset mtDNA2). For all
datasets, uncorrected pairwise differences were estimated in PAUP (Additional file 7). Nucleotide composition for all and only parsimony-informative positions for
the combined nuclear and both mitochondrial alignments was also estimated in PAUP (Additional file 4).
To test whether datasets can be combined, we performed partition homogeneity tests in PAUP with
10,000 replications.
Phylogenetic trees were constructed with MP and NJ
algorithms as implemented in PAUP as well as with ML
and Bayesian algorithms, using the programs GARLI
v0.951 [81] and MrBayes v3.1.2 [82,83]. For MP analyses, all characters were treated as unordered and
equally weighted throughout. A heuristic search was
performed with the maximum number of trees set to
100. For NJ, ML and Bayesian reconstructions, the optimal nucleotide substitution models for each locus and
concatenated datasets were chosen using AIC as implemented in MODELTEST v3.7 [84] (Additional file 8).
Relative support of internal nodes was assessed by bootstrap analyses with 10,000 (MP, NJ) or 500 replications
(ML). In GARLI, only the model specification settings
were adjusted according to the respective concatenated
dataset, while all other settings were left at their default

Page 10 of 13

value. ML majority-rule consensus trees were calculated
in PAUP. For Bayesian reconstructions, the datasets
were partitioned treating each locus separately and each
with its own substitution model. The solely protein-coding alignment of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA2)
was partitioned into codon positions. We used four
independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs
with the default temperature of 0.1. Four repetitions
were run for 10,000,000 generations with tree and parameter sampling occurring every 100 generations. The
first 25% of samples were discarded as burnin, leaving
75,001 trees per run. PPs for each split and a phylogram
with mean branch lengths were calculated from the posterior density of trees.
To evaluate the reliability of obtained relationships
among colobines, various alternative tree topologies
(Additional file 2) were tested with the ShimodairaHasegawa test [85] with full optimization and 1,000
bootstrap replications in PAUP.
Divergence age estimation

A Bayesian MCMC method, which employs a relaxed
molecular clock approach [86], as implemented in
BEAST v1.4.8 [87], was used to estimate divergence
times. Therefore, a relaxed lognormal model of lineage
variation and a Yule prior for branching rates was
assumed. Divergence times were calculated for each
locus separately and for the combined nuclear dataset.
The latter was partitioned treating each locus as distinct
unit. The mitochondrial alignment comprising solely
protein-coding genes (mtDNA2) was partitioned into
codon positions and the substitution model, rate heterogeneity and base frequencies were unlinked across
codon positions. Optimal nucleotide substitution models
were chosen using AIC in MODELTEST.
As calibrations we used the fossil-based divergence
between Homo and Pan, which has been dated at 6-7
mya [88-90], the separation of Pongo from the Homo/
Pan lineage ~14 mya [91], the split between Theropithecus and Papio ~4 mya [92,93], and the divergence of
hominoids and cercopithecoids ~24 mya [94-96].
Instead of hardbounded calibration points, we used the
published dates as a normal distribution prior for the
respective node. For the Homo - Pan divergence, this
translates into a normal distribution with a mean of 6.5
mya and a standard deviation (SD) of 0.5 mya, for the
separation of Pongo from the Homo/Pan clade into a
mean of 14.0 mya and a SD of 1.0 mya, for the Theropithecus - Papio split into a mean of 4.0 mya and a SD
of 0.5 mya, and for the hominoid - cercopithecoid divergence into a mean of 24 mya and a SD of 2 mya.
Since the estimation of phylogenetic relationships was
not the main aim of this analysis, we used an a-priori
fixed tree topology as obtained from mobile elements

(Figure 1A) for the calculation from nuclear sequence
data. Four replicates were run for 10,000,000 generations with tree and parameter sampling occurring every
100 generations. The adequacy of a 10% burnin and
convergence of all parameters were assessed by visual
inspection of the trace of the parameters across generations using TRACER v1.4.1 [97]. Subsequently, the sampling distributions were combined (25% burnin) using
the software LogCombiner v1.4.8 and a consensus
chronogram with node height distribution was generated
and visualized with TreeAnnotator v1.4.8 and FigTree
v1.2.2 [98].

Inferring hybridization in the presence of incomplete
lineage sorting

Statistical support for putative hybridization scenarios
was assessed with the method proposed by Kubatko
[40], in which statistical model selection techniques (e.
g., AIC) are used to compare species trees that may or
may not include hybridization scenarios. For our data,
we hypothesized two possible hybridization events (for
details see Results). The estimated gene trees used as
input were those derived from single locus tree reconstructions (Additional file 3) and branch lengths as estimated in BEAST. To estimate evolutionary rates for
individual loci, we followed the suggestion of Yang [99]
(see also [100]) and computed for each gene the average
pairwise sequence divergence of each ingroup (colobine)
sequence to the outgroup (non-colobine) taxa. We then
assigned to each locus a rate that was calculated by
dividing the mean pairwise divergence for that locus by
the median of the entire set of pairwise divergences
(Additional file 8). To convert gene tree branch lengths
to coalescent units, we considered two effective population sizes, 50,000 and 100,000, and used a generation
time of 5 years. Since the results were identical in terms
of the trees preferred, we show here the results only for
effective population size 50,000. For haploid loci (mitochondrial genome, Y chromosomal loci), we additionally
divided the rate by 2 (see [100]). We compared a total
of nine species trees (four corresponding to no hybridization, four corresponding to single hybridization events,
and one that included both hybridization scenarios, Figure 2). The AIC was computed for each tree using the
STEM software [100]. Models with AIC values within 2
of one another were regarded as providing similar fit to
the data [41].
