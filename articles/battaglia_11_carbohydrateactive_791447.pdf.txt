Abstract
Background: Rhizopus oryzae is a zygomycete filamentous fungus, well-known as a saprobe ubiquitous in soil and
as a pathogenic/spoilage fungus, causing Rhizopus rot and mucomycoses.
Results: Carbohydrate Active enzyme (CAZy) annotation of the R. oryzae identified, in contrast to other filamentous
fungi, a low number of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and a high number of glycosyl transferases (GTs) and
carbohydrate esterases (CEs). A detailed analysis of CAZy families, supported by growth data, demonstrates highly
specialized plant and fungal cell wall degrading abilities distinct from ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The
specific genomic and growth features for degradation of easily digestible plant cell wall mono- and
polysaccharides (starch, galactomannan, unbranched pectin, hexose sugars), chitin, chitosan, b-1,3-glucan and
fungal cell wall fractions suggest specific adaptations of R. oryzae to its environment.
Conclusions: CAZy analyses of the genome of the zygomycete fungus R. oryzae and comparison to ascomycetes
and basidiomycete species revealed how evolution has shaped its genetic content with respect to carbohydrate
degradation, after divergence from the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota.

Background
The phylum Zygomycota is a primitive and early diverging group of fungi. Fungal species belonging to this
basal fungal lineage are characterized by sexual reproduction via zygospores, asexual reproduction by uni-to
multispored sporangia and, in most species, nonseptate
(i.e coenocytic) hyphae. The Zygomycota is divided into
two classes, the Zygomycetes and the Trichomycetes.
The Zygomycetes are an ecologically diverse class of
fungi, including both saprobes and pathogens of plants,
animals (including humans) and other fungi. Rhizopus
oryzae is a member of the order Mucorales, genus of

Rhizopus. The order of Mucorales consists of genera
such as Mucor, Phycomyces, Rhizopus, Rhizomucor.
Although Rhizopus and Mucor are more closely related
to each other than either of them to Phycomyces, they
are not closely related genera [1]. R. orzyae has been
reported as the predominant human-pathogen causing
zygomycosis, a highly destructive and lethal infection on
immune-compromised hosts [2]. In industry, it is one of
the main Rhizopus spp. used in several traditional Asian
fermented foods such as tempeh [3]. Furthermore, it is
the well-known producer of metabolites such as organic
acids (e.g. lactic acid, fumaric acid), ethanol and hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. glucoamylases, polygalacturonases)
from pentose sugars and agricultural wastes such as barley, cassava, corn, potato pulp, oats and rice [4-9].
R. oryzae has a world-wide distribution with a high
prevalence in tropical and subtropical regions. It has
been isolated from many substrates, including a wide
variety of soils, decaying vegetation, fruit, vegetables,

seeds and dung [10]. As a fast growing filamentous fungus, it is known as a primary or secondary colonizer
[11], invading quickly on easily accessible and digestible
(e.g. rich in simple sugars) substrates. Recently the genome sequence of R. oryzae strain 99-880 has been published [12]. The genome paper focussed mainly on the
evolution of the genome, which was shown to include a
whole genome duplication event. Expansions of gene
families have been observed for specific cellular processes related to the human pathogenic lifestyle such as
cell growth and virulence. Little attention was given,
however, to the ability of R. oryzae to degrade plant and
fungal polysaccharides.
Several recent studies have demonstrated a strong
relationship between the repertoire of carbohydrate
active enzymes (CAZymes, http://www.cazy.org) [13] in
fungal genomes and their saprophytic lifestyle [14-17].
These studies focussed in particular on those CAZymes
involved in polysaccharide degradation. However, for
R. oryzae only two CAZy enzyme families, GH18 (chitinases) [18] and GH28 (polygalacturonases) [19], have
been studied in detail. Here we report the CAZy analysis
of the R. oryzae and link this annotation to the ability of
this fungus to use plant and fungal polysaccharides as
carbon source. This will not only provide a better
understanding of the ecological role of the R. oryzae,
but also of sugar consumption and degradation by zygomycete fungi in comparison to ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi.

Results and Discussion
CAZy annotation reveals different numbers of CAZy
families for R. oryzae in comparison to ascomycete and
basidiomycete fungi

The putative CAZymes in R. oryzae 99-880 were identified using the CAZy annotation pipeline (Additional
File 1) and compared to a selection of ascomycete and
basidiomycete fungi (Table 1).
A total of 317 CAZymes have been identified in the
R. oryzae genome. This value is similar to the number
of CAZymes found in known plant cell wall (PCW)
degrading basidiomycetes, higher than for yeasts, but
significantly lower than for filamentous ascomycetes
(Table 1). A total of 116 glycoside hydrolases were
found in the R. oryzae genome, which is lower to what
has been found in other filamentous fungi. In contrast,
the total number of 130 glycosyl transferases is a very
high value by comparison to other fungi (Table 1).
Average numbers of polysaccharide lyases (PL), carbohydrate esterases (CE) and carbohydrate binding modules
(CBM) were identified in R. oryzae.
In the next sections a more detailed comparison
between the putative CAZymes in R. oryzae and ascomycete and basidiomycete genomes related to the

Page 2 of 12

degradation of PCW polysaccharides (cellulose, xyloglucan, b-1,3-1,4-glucan, xylan, galactomannan, starch, inulin and pectin) is described (Table 2). This analysis will
be complemented by that of enzyme activities that
may be involved in the metabolism of endogenous or
exogenous fungal cell wall (FCW) polysaccharides.
Although displayed for comparative purposes, the numbers of CAZy modules of the yeast S. cerevisiae are not
included in the discussion, as this organism lacks most
of the enzymes involved in the degradation of PCW
polysaccharides. As a foreword, the tentative assignment
of putative enzymes to specific metabolic pathways
found below is meant to reveal the overall ability to deal
individually with different polysaccharides. A more rigorous accounting, if ever possible, would only be possible following experimental characterization of many
gene products. It should be noted that the CAZy annotations are based upon the protein models derived from
the annotation of the genomes. As the pipelines from
the JGI and the Broad Institute are not identical, this
may cause small differences in the numbers per family
that affected the comparison.
CAZy annotation of the R. oryzae genome indicates
highly specialized plant polysaccharide utilisation
Cellulose degradation

Degradation of cellulose is achieved by the synergistic
action of endoglucanases (endo-b-D-1,4-glucanases) and
cellobiohydrolases, assisted by b-glucosidases. It should
be noted that b-glucosidases also have other functions
than to assist cellulose degradation and therefore not all
b-glucosidases may be involved in cellulose breakdown.
A total of 21 and 19 candidate cellulolytic enzymes are
found in R. oryzae and in U. maydis genomes, respectively, lower than what is observed for the other species
(Table 2). P. anserina had the largest set of candidate
enzymes (72) related to cellulose degradation, as shown
previously [15].
Fungal cellobiohydrolases are classified in families
GH6 and GH7 and b-glucosidases are found in families
GH1 and GH3. The R. oryzae genome contains no protein models belonging to families GH1, GH6, GH7.
Moreover, only six GH3 genes were identified in R. oryzae compared while filamentous ascomycetes typically
contain more than ten (Table 2). None of the GH3
members were predicted to be b-glucosidases (Additional File 1).
R. oryzae contains the largest number of putative
enzymes assigned to family GH45 (5) whose characterised members are typically endoglucanases (Additional Files 1 and 2). Three out of these five GH45
ORFs contain a N-terminal CBM1 module (Additional
File 1) and have previously been shown to encode functional endoglucanases (rce1, rce2 and rce3) [20,21].

The number of enzymes in the different functional categories is only a rough estimate and not an absolute count, as functional assignments are sometimes
based on remote sequence similarities to biochemically characterized enzymes. Total values obtained per substrate correspond to the theoretical maximum
number of active enzymes that could be obtained by adding up all the members of the concerned families (as described in Suplementary Table 2). These values
are to be taken as a maximum rather than as absolute values. For Postia placenta, absolute values from the genomic effort on a dikaryon are provided but a
monokaryon is estimated to correspond to approximately to 70% of the total provided (Coutinho and Henrissat, unpublished).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/38

GH45 endoglucanases with a similar N-terminal CBM1
module have been identified in other members of the
Mucorales [22], including MCE1 and MCE2 from
Mucor circinelloides [23] and PCE1 from Phycomyces
nitens [24]. Interestingly, the R. oryzae genome contains
four putative protein models of GH9 (Supp. Table 2), a
family of endoglucanases mostly found in bacteria,
plants, and occasionally in animals [25]. GH9 members
are absent in all ascomycete filamentous fungi, while
basidiomycetes generally encode a single GH9 protein
harbouring a C-terminal membrane spanning region
(Additional File 2). The role of fungal GH9s remains
unclear, but is probably unrelated to cellulose degradation [26]. Finally, R. oryzae does not appear to encode
any family GH61 protein, which have been shown to
boost cellulose breakdown by cellulases [27,28].
Altogether the analysis suggests that the main cellulose-degrading enzymes produced by R. oryzae are
GH45 endoglucanases and that the fungus uses them
solely to access the plant material. Cellulose is therefore
probably not a nutritional source for R. oryzae, as
enzymes able to fully degrade cellulose into glucose
have not been found.
Xyloglucan

The R. oryzae genome is poor in protein models related
to xyloglucan degradation (3) (Table 2). Only U. maydis
had a similarly low number, while the other basidiomycete and ascomycete fungi contain 8 to 17 protein models
(Additional File 2). The genome appears to contain no
xyloglucan-active b-1,4-D-endoglucanase (GH12, 74) nor
any side-chain cleaving enzymes such as a-L-fucosidases
of families GH29 and GH95 (Additional File 2). The 3
members of family GH31 are candidate a-glucosidases
and not likely a-D-xylosidases (Additional File 1).
b-1,3-1,4-glucan degradation

The R. oryzae genome also encodes only a relatively
small number of enzymes for the breakdown of b-1,31,4-glucans (Table 2). 1,3-1,4-b-Glucans, which are
abundant components of the cell walls of grasses [29],
are typically hydrolysed by lichenases and endo-1,3-1,4b-glucanases of family GH16. Eight GH16 protein models were identified in R. oryzae, a low number compared
to ascomycete and basidiomycete species (Table 2).
Xylan degradation

Endoxylanases, commonly found in families GH10 and
GH11, cleave the xylan backbone into smaller oligosaccharides, which are degraded further by b-xylosidases
to xylose [30]. The R. oryzae genome contains no putative ORFs belonging to either family GH10 or GH11.
However, it has been demonstrated that R. oryzae CBS
112.07 produces a low molecular weight endoxylanase
[31]. Interestingly, family GH3 or GH43 candidate
b-xylosidases were detected in the genome (Additional
File 2). The two GH43 members were functionally

Page 4 of 12

annotated as candidates for arabinan endo-1, 5-a-L-arabinosidases (Additional File 1). R. oryzae appears to be
unable to breakdown xylan significantly as it lacks essential xylanolytic enzymes. With the exception of R. oryzae
and the mycorrhizal basidiomycete L. bicolor (Figure 1,
Additional File 2 and [17]), all other analyzed fungal species contain putative endoxylanases from families GH10
and GH11. The latter two fungi appear to share the
inability to degrade xylan with the oomycete P. ultimum
[17,32].
Galactomannan degradation

The R. oryzae genome contains 13 candidate CAZymes
related to the degradation of the main chain and sidechains of galactomannan. This value is similar to that of
U. maydis, but significantly lower than that found in the
other analyzed species (Table 2). No clear candidate
b-endomannanase (EC 3.2.1.78) or b-mannosidase
(EC 3.2.1.25) from families GH2, GH5 and GH26 were
found in R. oryzae. Among the few GH5s found in
R. oryzae, only one was found to be distantly related to
bacterial b-mannosidases (Additional File 1). This constitutes presently the unique candidate enzyme for a
possible role in the breakdown of the (gluco)mannan
backbone. In A. niger, the presence of a single characterized b-mannosidase (MndA) and b-mannanase (Man5A)
has been shown to be sufficient for an efficient degradation of mannan from different sources [33,34].
The genome R. oryzae contains a total of six protein
models in families GH27 and GH36, mostly described
as a-galactosidases (Additional File 1). The enrichment
of a-galactosidases in the genome suggests galactose
release by R. oryzae, probably for nutritional use, from
structural or storage galactoglucomannan, oligosaccharides such as melibiose, raffinose, stachyose, and/or xylan
or xyloglucan.
Starch and inulin degradation

The R. oryzae genome contains an average number of candidate CAZymes involved in starch degradation compared
to the ascomycetes and basidiomycetes (Table 2). R. oryzae
contains the highest number of GH15 enzymes (6),
whereas few members from families GH13 (4) and GH31
(3) were detected (Table 2). Four of the six GH15 members were annotated as candidate glucoamylases or related
enzymes (Additional File 1). Glucoamylase (AmyA;
RO3G_00082.3) has been characterized previously [35], in
part due its common usage in the starch industry because
of its high activity and stability [36]. One of them has been
previously characterized as a glucoamylase (AmyA;
RO3G_00082.3) [35] and this enzyme has been commonly
used in industry because of high activity and stability [36].
AmyA consists of a C-terminal catalytic domain, connected to an N-terminal starch-binding module of CBM21
by an O-glycosylated linker [37]. Interestingly, a very high
number of CBM21-containing protein models (8)

containing a CBM21 module were observed in R. oryzae
compared to ascomycetes and basidiomycetes (1 - 4)
(Additional File 1). Except for AmyA the actual function
of these putative proteins is unknown. No catalytic modules were detected for the other seven ORFs, but all eight
ORFs contain a putative phosphatase regulatory subunit.
Candidate starch-binding CBM20-containing protein
models are found in all ascomycetes and basidiomycetes,
excepting U. maydis. No CBM20 module is present in
the R. oryzae genome, a feature probably functionally

compensated by the eight CBM21-containing proteins.
Interestingly, most CBM21-containing proteins are
found among Eukaryota, contrasts with CBM20s that
are equally dispersed among Bacteria and Eukaryota. As
expected, none of the other CBM families containing
starch-binding modules (CBM25, CBM26, CBM34 and
CBM41) were found in the species analysed in this
study. They are only found in prokaryotes (mostly
Eubacteria) and the only one in Eukaryotes is in picophytotoplanktonic green algae [38].

Battaglia et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:38
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/38

No clear candidate invertases or inulinases could be
detected in the genome of R. oryzae. In the R. orzyae
NBRC 4785 strain, a glucoamylase (similar to R. oryzae
NRRL 395 amyB [39]) with sucrose-hydrolyzing activity
has been however reported [40]. AmyB has no starchbinding module and no apparent glucoamylase activity,
but it was highly similar to the catalytic module of
AmyA (glucoamylase). Only the equivalent AmyA mentioned earlier is found in the genome of R. oryzae strain
99-88 suggesting strain variations within family GH15.
Interestingly, Aspergillus starch-degrading glucoamylases
have been known for their promiscuity in degrading
substrates containing a-linked D-glucosides [41] but no
other reports of an ability to degrade sucrose are known.
Pectin degradation

In the R. oryzae genome, pectin degradation appears
to be the focus of the highest number of putative
CAZymes (27 predicted enzymes in Table 2). In
comparison to the ascomycete and basidiomycete species, this is an average value. Less pectin-degrading
CAZymes were predicted for U. maydis and L. bicolor,
while the highest potential for pectin degradation is
found in A. nidulans and A. oryzae (with an estimation
of 94 and 109 CAZymes each, respectively). The R. oryzae genome is especially rich in family GH28 protein
models, with twelve and three genes encoding candidate endopolygalacturonases (EC 3.2.1.15) and exopolygalacturonases (EC 3.2.1.67), respectively [19].
Endopolygalacturonases particularly hydrolyse the
a-1,4 linked D-galacturonic acid within the homogalacturonan chain and exo-polygalacturonases hydrolyse
this chain from the nonreducing end [30]. Our analysis
shows that the enrichment of main-chain degrading
enzymes of pectin was accompanied by low numbers of
accessory enzymes (Table 2). A possible explanation
is that R. oryzae is limited in the degradation of
unbranched pectins, unlike most ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi that can degrade a variety of lowly and
highly branched pectins.
This view fits well with the pre- and/or post harvest
pathogenic lifestyle of R. oryzae. As a causal agent of
Rhizopus rot, R. oryzae produces endopolygalacturonases for maceration of plant seedlings, fruits and vegetables and plant structures such as flowers, bulbs and
tubers [42-44]. The pectin structure in berries, black
currants and apples has been shown to contain a
high amount of D-galacturonic acid and a small amount
of rhamnose residues, indicating the presence of
unbranched pectin [45,46]. Rhizopus rot is characterized
by the dissolution of the PCW middle lamella in fruits
and vegetables, that are typically rich in unbranched
pectin (homogalacturonans) with a low degree of methyl
esterification [47]. Such dissolution would facilitate
accessibility into plant tissue. The natural ability of

Page 6 of 12

R. oryzae to degrade unbranched pectin has been
exploited in industry, where GH28 endopolygalacturonases has been shown to be very useful in flax-retting
(i.e. a process that degrades the smooth regions of
pectin for separation of plant fibres) [48-50].
In summary, the genome contains mainly enzymes
involved in degradation of storage polysaccharides
(galactomannan and starch) and the backbone PCW
structural polysaccharides (cellulose and pectin). The
apparent absence of (i) exo-acting enzymes for cellulose,
(ii) accessory enzymes for pectin degradation, and (iii)
any enzymes for degradation of xyloglucan, b-1,3-1,4glucan, xylan and inulin, suggest that these polysaccharides do not serve R. oryzae as a major carbon source.
The degrading capacity of R. oryzae allows rapid invasion on and into the substrate, outcompeting secondary
and late colonizers that will have to cope with a more
extensive degradation of more resistant complex PCW
polysaccharides.
The hydrolytic potential of the R. oryzae genome
correlates with growth on polysaccharides and related
monosaccharides

The CAZy annotation results were compared to the
growth profile of two R. oryzae strains (the sequenced
isolate 99-880 and the type strain of the species CBS
112.07) and a selection of species from the FungGrowth database http://www.fung-growth.org on a number of carbon sources (Figure 1). Overall growth of the
type isolate was better than the sequenced isolate.
A strong preference for citrus pectin and guar gum
(a galactomannan) was observed for R. oryzae 99-880,
followed by inulin and starch. This pattern was largely
the same for the type isolate, but this strain grew better
on starch than the sequenced strain. Good growth on
pectin, galactomannan and starch correlates with the
presence of related CAZymes in the genome and the
occurrence of R. oryzae on fruits, vegetables and seeds
[10]. Fruits and vegetables are rich in pectin, whereas
seeds are enriched in storage polysaccharides such as
galactomannan, starch and inulin. Both R. orzyae strains
were able to grow on inulin, despite the absence of
known genes required for its degradation. Genome
annotation of the oomycete Pythium ultimum initially
also identified no candidate invertase [32]. An invertase
gene was detected after Blast analysis of the raw nucleotide sequence, indicating that this was missed by the
model-building pipeline. In light of this we used the
same approach, but failed to identify any putative invertase in the sequenced strain of R. oryzae. Alternative
explanations for the growth on inulin could be the
presence of traces of other carbon sources in the commercial inulin preparation, or the presence of yet to discover fructofuranosidases.

No to poor growth (similar to growth on agar without
carbon source) was observed on xylan (Figure 1) and
cellulose (data not shown). Xylan was utilized by
all other tested species with the exception of L. bicolor
(Figure 1). This is in agreement with the absence of
genes required to degradation of xylan in the genomes
of R. oryzae and L. bicolor, and presence in all other
tested genomes.
Growth on citrus pectin, guar gum, starch and inulin
correlated well with growth on their associated monosaccharide components. R. oryzae showed average to
good growth on D-galactose and D-mannose, the main
components of galactomannan (Figure 1). The pectin
main chain is mainly composed of D-galacturonic acid
residues with small amounts of L-rhamnose residues,
while the side chains consist of L-arabinose and
D-galactose [30]. This correlates well with the ability of
R. oryzae to grow on D-galacturonic acid (Figure 1) and
L-rhamnose (data not shown). No growth of P. chrysogenum, L. bicolor, P. anserina and M. grisea was
observed on D-galacturonic acid (Figure 1). In general,
fungi do not prefer D-galacturonic acid as a carbon
source (de Vries et al, unpublished results). No to poor
growth occurred on L-arabinose or D-ribose (data not
shown), which strongly suggests that pentose sugars are
not preferred by R. oryzae. Growth on D-xylose was
observed for R. oryzae CBS 112.07, which confirms a
previous study [51]. However, no growth was observed
for 99-880 on this substrate, demonstrating a significant
difference between the isolates for xylose utilisation.
Part of this difference may be due to a poor ability of
some R. oryzae strains to germinate on D-xylose [8].
CAZy annotation reveals specific differences in the
chitinolytic and glucanolytic enzyme system for R. oryzae

The following sections describe the comparison of the
number of CAZy family members between R. oryzae
and the ascomycete and basidiomycete species that are
implicated in the turnover/modification of the fungal
cell wall (FCW) polysaccharides chitin, chitosan,
a-1,3-glucan, b-1,3-glucan and b-1,6-glucan (Table 3).
R. oryzae appears to contain over 40 CAZymes for chitosan degradation/biosynthesis, more than any of the
species analyzed so far. The chitin recycling machinery
found in R. oryzae, is similar in size to that observed in
filamentous ascomycete and basidiomycete species
(Table 3). Significantly, low numbers of CAZymes
for the degradation of a-1,3-glucan, b-1,3-glucan and
b-1,6-glucan were found in R. oryzae when compared to
ascomycetes and basidiomycetes.
Chitosan and chitin degradation

Chitin deacetylases catalyze the deacetylation of chitin
to chitosan. In R. oryzae, a very large set of chitin deacetylases of family CE4 is found (Additional File 2). With a

Page 7 of 12

total of 34 CE4 models, this is more than three times
the previous highest number of CE4s observed in the
basidiomycete L. bicolor or in the ascomycete M. grisea.
Most of the CE4 proteins in R. oryzae appear to be GPIanchored (Additional File 1). The biosynthesis of cell
wall chitosan, the main cell wall component of zygomycete species [52,53], proceeds by coordinated action of
both chitin synthase and chitin deacetylases [54]. The
many chitin deacetylases in the R. oryzae genome complement a large set of chitin synthases, previously
reported as an expansion compared to ascomycete genomes [12]. The physiological role of chitin deacetylases
in R. oryzae is presently unknown but they have been
suggested to play roles in FCW biosynthesis in Mucor
rouxii and Absidia coerulea and in plant-pathogen interactions in Colletotrichum lindemuthianum and Aspergillus nidulans [55]. Alternatively chitin deacetylases may
also be involved in the digestion of chitin, whereby the
resulting chitosan would be cleaved by chitosanases. It
has been proposed that marine fungi use chitin deacetylases for the decomposition of chitin [53] according to
the chitosan pathway [56].
Chitosanases (EC 3.2.1.132) have been described in
families GH5, GH7, GH8, GH46, GH75, and GH80, the
last three containing exclusively chitosanases. All presently characterized GH75 proteins are fungal chitosanases [57]. Members from this family are present in all
filamentous ascomycete species, but absent in R. oryzae,
in the yeast S. cerevisiae and in all described basidiomycete fungi (Additional File 2). In R. oryzae, one and two
proteins from families GH8 and GH46 were identified,
respectively (Additional File 2). Our analysis of the corresponding sequences from R. oryzae indicates that they
are only distantly related to bacterial chitosanases (Additional File 1). Bacterial chitosanases are known to play a
role in the degradation and utilization of exogenous
chitosan, whereas fungal chitosanases are assumed
to recycle chitosan from the FCW. Production of chitosanases has been demonstrated during autolysis in
Mucor rouxi [58].
Fungal chitinases from family GH18 are essential for
FCW remodelling during growth and development [59].
In R. oryzae, a total of 14 GH18 members was found, a
value similar to what is found in known ascomycete and
basidiomycete species (Additional File 2). All candidate
proteins belonging to family GH18 are likely chitinases
in R. orzyae, as previously suggested by phylogenetic
analysis [18]. The R. oryzae genome contains four protein models belonging to family GH20 and comparison
to functionally characterized enzymes revealed that
these members are related to b-N-acetylglucosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.30) or b-N-acetylhexosaminidases
(EC 3.2.1.52). Family CE9 which includes N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylases (EC 3.5.1.25) is

important for the metabolism of chitin. R. oryzae has
only one family CE9 member, a number similar to ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi. Fungal chitinases have
been shown to have diverse roles, such as remodelling
of their own cell wall and release of nutrients [60]. It
remains unknown, whether these chitinolytic genes of
R. oryzae also have a role in nutritional processes. Rhizopus and Mucor species have been shown to use chitinases for hyphal growth and autolysis [61,62]. For other
zygomycete fungi such as Mortierella spp, chitinolytic
activity has been linked to utilisation of nutrients [56].
a-1,3-Glucan degradation

Both a-1,3-glucosidase and glucan endo-a-1,3-glucosidase
are involved in hydrolysis of a-1, 3-glucan. a-1,3-Glucosidases are classified in families GH31 and GH63 and glucan
endo-a-1,3-glucosidase in families GH71 and 87. R. oryzae
encodes five proteins likely to breakdown a-1,3-glucan
degradation, a lower value compared to the filamentous
ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, excepting U. maydis.
Functional analysis suggests that three members of family
GH31 and two of family GH63 are candidate a-glucosidases, but it is unknown if these a-glucosidases could deal
specifically with a-1,3-glycoside linkages. Both families are
known to contain different enzyme activities, such as aglucosidases that hydrolyse a-1, 4-linkages. No proteins
were found in families GH71 and GH87, known for bearing glucan endo-a-1,3-glucosidases, unlike several ascomycete and basidiomycete genomes that contain GH71
members.
b-1,3-Glucan and b-1,6-glucan degradation

b-1,3-Glucanases can be divided into exo-b-1,3-glucanases
and endo-b-1,3-glucanases. Four of the seven GH5
members from R. oryzae were functionally annotated as

a candidate b-glucosidase related to exo-1,3-b-glucanases (Additional File 1), while five of the six protein
models of family GH3 were functionally annotated as a
candidate b-glucosidase or exo-1,3-b-glucosidase. R.
oryzae also encodes two proteins belonging to family
GH72, a family typically containing GPI-anchored b1,3-glucanosyltransferases. These enzymes are known to
play a central role in the cross linking of cell wall b-1,3glucans to other cell wall b-glucans [63]. The two R. oryzae GH72s are indeed related to characterized b-1,3glucanosyltransglycosylases, and have a C-terminal GPIanchor. The cell wall of zygomycetes consists of primarily of chitin and chitosan [52]. However, there is evidence that the cell wall of zygomycetes could contain
small amounts of b-1,3-glucan. b-1,3-Glucans have been
suggested to participate in the regulation of cell wall
morphology in the zygomycete M. rouxii [64]. We have
identified three putative 1,3-b-D-glucan synthases
(family GT48) encoded by the R. oryzae genome. The
likely presence of b-1,3-glucan might explain the
recently detected susceptibility of R. oryzae to caspofungin, an antifungal agent which inhibits the 1,3-b-Dglucan synthase [65]. The presence of reduced amounts
of b-1,3-glucans in the cell wall does not correlate with
the significant numbers of 1,3-b-glucanases in the genome. This could indicate a possible role for the candidate b-1,3-glucanases in the degradation of cell walls of
ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, whose cell walls are
enriched in chitin and b-1,3-glucans [52,66,67].
b-1,6-Glucanases may be found in families GH5 and
GH30. The R. orzyae genome contains seven protein models belonging to these two GH families (Table 3), but comparison to biochemically characterized enzymes allowed

Battaglia et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:38
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/38

no clear identification of candidate b-1,6-glucanases in
R. orzyae (Additional File 1). This agrees well with the lack
of reports on the presence of b-1,6-glucan in the cell wall
of R. oryzae.
The hydrolytic potential of R. oryzae genome correlates
with growth on fungal cell wall fractions and
polysaccharides

The CAZy annotation results are consistent with growth
data of R. oryzae on fungal cell wall polysaccharides and
fractions thereof (Figure 2). Growth of R. oryzae on

Page 9 of 12

b-1,3-glucan, chitin and chitosan was comparable to the
colony size and density on D-glucose. Significantly
improved growth was observed on fungal cell wall fractions of S. cerevisiae, A. niger and A. bisporus (aggregated mycelium) (Figure 2), but no growth was observed
on cell wall fractions of R. oryzae and P. blakesleeanes
(data not shown). The zygomycete M. circinelloides
showed a similar growth phenotype on cell wall polysaccharides and fractions. In contrast, poor growth of
A. niger was observed on b-1,3-glucan, chitin, chitosan
and cell wall fractions. All three species showed good
growth on N-acetylglucosamine (Figure 2).
The chitinolytic and b-1,3-glucanolytic enzyme system
of R. oryzae could have a role in either nutrition or fungal interactions. Fungal interactions may include inhibition of growth of coexisting fungi, a potential defence
system for mycoparasitic competitors such as ascomycete Trichoderma spp. that are known to parasitize a
range of fungi [68]. Degradation of chitin, chitosan and/
or b-1,3 glucan in the environment can serves as a carbon and nitrogen source for fungi. Recycling of cell wall
material of former fungal colonizers has been observed
for primary and secondary basidiomycete species of
wood during succession [69]. Growth of R. oryzae on
chitin and chitosan suggest the ability to digest these
polymers in the environment. Together with previous
reported locations of isolation, e.g. the soil of saltmarshes [10], our observations are compatible with an
adaptation of R. orzyae to inhabit coastal environments.

Conclusions
The R. oryzae genome encodes a repertoire of CAZymes
distinct of that of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi,
suggesting strong evolutionally differences and adaptation to the environment at the genomic level. In contrast to most ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, the set of
CAZymes in the R. oryzae genome - supported by the
growth profile - reveals the ability to use easily digestible
sugars accompanied by an inability to degrade complex
plant cell wall polysaccharides. The chitinolytic and glucanolytic enzyme system and the ability to degrade
chitin, chitosan, b-1,3-glucan and ascomycete and basidiomycete cell walls suggest a role in both morphological processes and non-plant based nutrition. The
differences in hydrolytic potential identified for R. oryzae
suggest the development of unique strategies for polysaccharide degradation in the Zygomycota when compared to Basidiomycota and Ascomycota.

xylan and 25 mM for D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, D-galacturonic acid, D-fructose and D-xylose (Additional File 3). The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.0.
The plates were inoculated with 2 μl of 500 spores/μl or
a mycelium plug (1 mm diameter). For growth comparison on fungal cell wall fractions and polysaccharides, of
Rhizopus oryzae, Mucor circinelloides and Aspergillus
niger were grown on plates containing Aspergillus minimal medium [70] and 1,5% agar with 25 mM glucose, or
0.5% (w/v) N-acetylglucosamine, chitin, chitosan, b1,3-glucan (Additional File 3), or 0.5% (w/v) dried cell
wall fractions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus
niger, Agaricus bisporus. Plates were inoculated with 5 μl
of 500 A. niger spores/μl, or with a plug of R. oryzae or
M. circinelloides mycelium. Cultures were grown for
3 days at 25°C.
CAZy annotation

All 17,459 protein-encoding ORFs from the R. oryzae
RA 99-880 genome were submitted to analysis using
the CAZy annotation pipeline in a two-step procedure
of identification and annotation. The identification
step of CAZymes follows the procedures previously
described [13] where sequences are subject to Blastp
analysis [71] against a library composed of modules
derived from CAZy, the positive hits are then subject
to a modular annotation procedure that maps the individual modules against on the peptide using hits
against libraries of catalytic and carbohydrate models
derived from CAZy using BlastP or profile Hidden
Markov models [71,72]. The results are augmented
with signal peptide, transmembrane, and GPI predictions by human curators [73-75]. The fragmentary
models and all models suspected of splicing prediction
errors are identified. The functional annotation step
involves BlastP comparisons against a library modules
derived from biochemically characterized enzymes [13].
This manual comparison to identified functions yields
three levels of detailed annotation: i) candidate activity, reflects a non-ambiguous assignment thanks to
high levels of similarity and/or a large functional
homogeneity of the hits; ii) related to activity, reflects
a more distant similarity and/or a functional variability
of the results; iii) distantly related to activity, reflects a
weak degree of similarity to known activities. In most
cases a generic activity (ex: a-glycosidase) was equally
assigned.
Fungal cell wall extractions

Cell wall fractions were isolated as described by
