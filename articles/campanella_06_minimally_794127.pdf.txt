Abstract
Background: The acquisition of high-quality DNA for use in phylogenetic and molecular
population genetic studies is a primary concern for evolutionary and genetic researchers. Many
non-destructive DNA sampling methods have been developed and are used with a variety of taxa
in applications ranging from genetic stock assessment to molecular forensics.
Results: The authors have developed a field sampling method for obtaining high-quality DNA from
sunfish (Lepomis) and other freshwater fish that employs a variation on the buccal swab method and
results in the collection of DNA suitable for PCR amplification and polymorphism analysis.
Additionally, since the circumstances of storage are always a concern for field biologists, the
authors have tested the potential storage conditions of swabbed samples and whether those
conditions affect DNA extraction and PCR amplification. It was found that samples stored at room
temperature in the dark for over 200 days could still yield DNA suitable for PCR amplification and
polymorphism detection.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that valuable molecular genetic data may be obtained from
tissues that have not been treated or stored under optimal field conditions. Furthermore, it is clear
that the lack of adequately low temperatures during transport and long term storage should not
be a barrier to anyone wishing to engage in field-based molecular genetic research.

Background
The acquisition of high quality DNA for use in phylogeny
and population genetic studies is a prime concern for
researchers. While such DNA samples are easily obtained,
it often requires the sacrifice of the animals being studied.
Such lethal sampling has the potential to seriously impact
the genetic makeup of populations under investigation,
altering the composition of the future population.
A number of non-destructive nucleic acid sampling methods have been developed with a variety of taxa in applica-

tions ranging from genetic stock assessment to molecular
forensics. DNA samples suitable for PCR amplification
and analysis of polymorphisms in honey bees (Apis mellifera) have been obtained from wing clips [1]. Toe clips
have been used to obtain samples of DNA for genetic
studies of the Great Plains toad, Bufo cognatus [2]. In piscine species, tissue sources of DNA for non-lethal sampling include: fin clips, scales, barbels, muscle, blood, and
sperm [3,4]. The molecular phylogeny of the family Chinchillidae has been investigated using DNA from hair,
blood, feces, and ear tissue [5]. DNA suitable for microsPage 1 of 4

omis macrochirus). This method employs a variation on the
buccal swab method and results in the collection of DNA
suitable for PCR amplification and polymorphic analysis.
Additionally, we address the question of how robust our
method would be for a field scientist who did not have the
proper storage facilities. If a field scientist did not have
proper refrigeration, would tissues sampled by buccal
swabbing be stable and, if so, for how long?

homozygotes for the Lma20 marker are clearly delineated in
the individual fish. 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The image was inverted to a negative by Scion computer software (Scion, Inc., Frederick, Maryland).

atellite analysis and genotyping has even been obtained
from Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) and chimpanzee
(Pan troglodytes) feces [6,7], and from long-dead sperm
whales (Physeter macrocephalus) using teeth and scrimshaw
[8].
A standard method of collecting DNA from humans
involves the minimally invasive process of buccal swabbing to separate away epithelial cells from which the DNA
is then extracted [9,10]. Among the advantages of this
method are its swiftness and ease of application [11].
These characteristics make buccal swabbing adaptable to
a wide variety of situations and particularly amenable to
large sample sizes.
In addition to the problem of collecting tissue samples
non-destructively, the storage of said samples in the field
for subsequent DNA extraction presents a difficulty for the
field biologist involved in molecular analysis. Since elaborate DNA extraction methods that would ensure sample
stability usually can not be employed in the field, alternatives must be found. Low temperature tissue storage is an
obvious, although potentially impractical, solution. Tissues fixed in 50% ethanol have yielded DNA suitable for
restriction endonuclease digestion and hybridization with
oligonucleotide probes after storage for 6 years [12]. Storage of tissues in a Lysis/Storage/Transportation (LST)
buffer at room temperature for up to 8 weeks has allowed
extraction of DNA of sufficient quality for restriction
endonuclease digestion as well as PCR amplification [13].
The authors have developed a field sampling method for
obtaining high quality DNA from bluegill sunfish (Lep-

Results and discussion
The quality of the isolated bluegill DNA is high enough to
allow PCR amplification of simple sequence repeat polymorphisms without further purification. There is some
background visible along with the polymorphic DNA
bands, but the bands themselves are clearly visible for
each individual fish (Figure 1). Microsatellite regions have
been successfully amplified at several bluegill loci
(Lma20, Lma21, Lma87, Lma102, Lma120, and
Lma124), although data from only the Lma20 locus is
presented here (Figure 1). Moreover, we have amplified
larger polymorphic microsatellite sequences of 300 basepairs using the marker Lma120 (data not shown). Highresolution agarose gel electrophoretic analysis using comparison to known concentrations of HiLo Marker (Minnesota Molecular, Madison, Minnesota) was employed to
determine the size ranges of unamplified genomic DNA.
We found molecular weights ranged from 1000 to 7000
basepairs.
After over 200 days of storage, either preserved in ethanol
or in a dried state, the Lepomis tissue yielded DNA that
amplifies microsatellite sequences quite clearly and
strongly (Fig. 2). Additionally, the polymorphisms among
the individual bluegills sampled can be identified, suggesting that population studies may be performed even on
samples that are months old and stored at room temperature. We conclude that tissue samples taken in this manner are quite stable over long periods either when vacuum
dried or left in ethanol.
Note that the PCR products being amplified and examined (Fig. 2) are not from the same individuals, so many
of the differences that we are seeing in amplified products
arise from polymorphisms between the individuals.
There does appear to be an aberrant product at 201 days
between the "wet" and the "dry" preserved samples (Fig.
2, lanes 10 and 11) where an extra band has appeared.
There may have been some minor degradation in the
dried tissue sample that led to an additional PCR product
being generated. It seems more likely that we may be
observing two microsatellite (Lma20) alleles, and a heteroduplex band composed of two different size alleles. "Triplet" bands are often produced in PCR, where two
basepair repeats are found in the microsatellite sequence,

such as in Lma20 (personal communication, Dr. Kirsten
Monsen).
The mean concentration of DNA extracted using each
method of preservation was comparable: the "wet" preserved DNA was 50.6 ± 7.6 ng/uL, while the "dry" preserved was 46.4 ± 5.1 ng/uL. The range in "dry"
concentrations was 29–70 ng/ul. The range of "wet" concentration was 32–69 ng/ul.
It should be noted that although we employed 100% ethanol successfully in our own tissue stability studies, it
seems likely that concentrations as low as 50% will work
as well [12]. Many researchers may want to consider lowering the ethanol concentration for reasons of economy.
Our findings suggest that valuable molecular genetic data
may be obtained not only from piscine tissues that have
been stored under optimal conditions, but also from
those that have not been stored optimally. Furthermore, it
is clear that the lack of adequately low temperatures during transport and long term storage should not be a barrier to anyone wishing to engage in field-based molecular
genetic research. Although we have not endeavoured to
determine whether tissues gathered in this manner from
other aquatic species may have the same longevity of storage, it is likely that tissues obtained from other fish using
the described field extraction method will yield robust
samples.

Methods
Collection and treatment of samples
Bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) were caught in situ
using standard angling equipment and bait of mealworms. The sunfish originated from Lake Wapalanne in
northwestern New Jersey. Once caught, the fish were held
temporarily (20–90 min) in buckets of lake water.

When ~20 fish were captured, buccal smears were taken
from each fish by sterilely swabbing their mouths using
the wooden dowel end of sterile cotton-tipped applicators
(Moore Medical Corp, New Britain, Connecticut). Cheek
cells from the applicator ends were fixed and preserved on
site by re-suspension into 100 uL of 100% denatured ethanol (Fisher Scientific, Hanover Park, Illinois) in 1.5 mL
microfuge tubes. After taking buccal smears, fish were
returned to their lake habitat.
For the study testing the practicality of using buccal swabbing for the tissue collection process, the fixed tissue samples were stored at 4°C for 24–96 hours before extraction.
For the tissue stability study, half the samples were left in
ethanol, sealed with parafilm and stored at a constant
26°C (Model E-30B constant temperature chamber, Percival Scientific) in the dark. The remainder of the samples
were dried for 20 min on a Savant Speedvac vacuum dryer
(GMI, Inc., Albertville, Minnesota) set at the lowest drying
temperature. These dried samples were then sealed with
parafilm and stored with the ethanol preserved samples in
the dark at a constant 26°C. DNA was extracted from the
tissues (both ethanol preserved and vacuum dried) after 2,
5, 25, 55, 105, and 201 days.
DNA extraction and PCR amplification conditions
All ethanol preserved samples were dried for 20 min on a
Savant Speedvac vacuum dryer set at the lowest drying
temperature. Both "wet" preserved and "dry" preserved
tissues were then resuspended in 50 uL of TE and RNase
(10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 unit RNase per 50
uL aliquot). Tissues were lysed by 5 min incubation at
95°C, cooled on ice for an additional 5 min incubation,
and centrifuged briefly to collect condensation.

The polymerase chain reaction was performed employing
Lepomis amplification primers for detecting microsatellite
polymorphisms [14]. The amplification conditions prin-

cipally followed the directions of Vander Zwan et al [15].
Microsatellites were amplified in 20 uL reactions containing: 29–70 ng fish DNA, 10% ThermoPol buffer (New
England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, Massachusetts), 5 pmoles
of each primer, 200 uM dNTPs (New England Biolabs
Inc., Beverly, Massachusetts), and 1.0 unit Taq polymerase. The primers used for the test were for the Lma20 locus
(Lma20F: 5'GGCACTAATCTAATTGTAGCC 3', Lma20R:
5'TTGTGTGTCTGCATTGGAATC 3') [14]. DNA concentrations were determined employing a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer Model ND-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies
Inc., Wilmington, Delaware).

All amplification was performed in a Mastercycler Gradient Thermocycler (Eppendorf Inc., Germany). The PCR
products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel in 1X sodium borate buffer [16]. The products on
agarose gels were stained with ethidium bromide and
imaged using an Ultralum gel documentation system
(Ultralum, Inc., Claremont, California) and Scion computer software (Scion, Inc., Frederick, Maryland).
