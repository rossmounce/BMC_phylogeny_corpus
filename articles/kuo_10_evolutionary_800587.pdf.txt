Evolutionary divergence in the fungal response
to fluconazole revealed by soft clustering

Abstract
Background: Fungal infections are an emerging health risk, especially those involving yeast that are resistant to
antifungal agents. To understand the range of mechanisms by which yeasts can respond to anti-fungals, we
compared gene expression patterns across three evolutionarily distant species - Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida
glabrata and Kluyveromyces lactis - over time following fluconazole exposure.
Results: Conserved and diverged expression patterns were identified using a novel soft clustering algorithm that
concurrently clusters data from all species while incorporating sequence orthology. The analysis suggests
complementary strategies for coping with ergosterol depletion by azoles - Saccharomyces imports exogenous
ergosterol, Candida exports fluconazole, while Kluyveromyces does neither, leading to extreme sensitivity. In support
of this hypothesis we find that only Saccharomyces becomes more azole resistant in ergosterol-supplemented
media; that this depends on sterol importers Aus1 and Pdr11; and that transgenic expression of sterol importers in
Kluyveromyces alleviates its drug sensitivity.
Conclusions: We have compared the dynamic transcriptional responses of three diverse yeast species to
fluconazole treatment using a novel clustering algorithm. This approach revealed significant divergence among
regulatory programs associated with fluconazole sensitivity. In future, such approaches might be used to survey a
wider range of species, drug concentrations and stimuli to reveal conserved and divergent molecular response
pathways.

Background
Mucosal and invasive mycoses are a major world health
problem leading to morbidity [1,2] and a mortality rate
of up to 70% in immunocompromised hosts [3]. The
most common treatment for fungal infections is the
family of chemical compounds known as the azoles,
which interfere with formation of the cell membrane by
inhibiting synthesis of ergosterol [4]. However, the use
of azoles to treat a broad spectrum of fungal infections
has led to widespread azole resistance [4-9], and resistance is also emerging against the limited number of
secondary compounds that are currently available
[10,11].

The fungal response to azoles has been most often
studied in yeast [5,7,12-17], primarily through analysis
of standard laboratory strains of Candida [12,13,18] or
Saccharomyces [14,16,17] or their resistant clinical isolates [2,12,15,19]. Other studies have focused on cultures
for which drug resistance has been artificially evolved
in-vitro [15,18,20,21]. This work has revealed a number
of resistance and response mechanisms that can be
invoked to protect cells from drugs, including mutations
to drug efflux pumps or their regulators [2,12,20,21],
mutations to ergosterol synthesis enzymes [20], duplication of the fluconazole target Erg11 [18], and a possible
role for Hsp90 [15,22].
Although these represent a wide array of mechanisms,
it is likely that the full range of anti-fungal resistance
pathways is even greater, for several reasons. The first
relates to genetic diversity: the number of clinical isolates that have been studied to-date is relatively modest,
and resistant strains produced by artificial evolution are
only a few generations removed from the common

laboratory strains used as starting material. The second
reason relates to the environment: it is very difficult to
mirror in the laboratory the range of conditions that
must be experienced by yeast in the wild during the
evolution of stress response pathways. Thus, an important goal moving forward is to better understand the
entire pool of genotypic variation underlying fungal
stress responses, particularly as they relate to antifungal
agents.
Towards this goal, we performed a comparative study
of the transcriptional program activated by fluconazole
in three evolutionarily distinct yeasts: Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (Sc), Candida glabrata (Cg), and Kluyveromyces lactis (Kl). These species were selected to provide
a survey of transcriptional networks at intermediate evolutionary distance, that is, at sufficient distance to
observe evolutionary change but sufficiently close to
ensure significant conservation. Sc and Cg diverged
approximately 100 million years ago, and both harbor
evidence of an ancient whole-genome duplication event
[23]. Cg is an established human pathogen while Sc has
been occasionally found to cause systemic infection in
immunocompromised individuals [2]. Kl was selected as
an outgroup since its evolutionary history is clearly distinct from Sc (having diverged prior to whole-genome
duplication [24]) but its transcriptional network is substantially closer to Sc than, for instance, is the network
of Candida albicans [25]. In addition, Sc, Cg, and Kl
share functional and phenotypic characteristics (for
example, growth as haploids [26], similar codon usage
[26]) that make them suitable for comparison.
Earlier efforts to profile expression across different
species have been limited to the examination of matched
conditions across two organisms [27-29] or curated
compendia of microarrays across many conditions
[24,30,31]. Such studies have previously identified transcriptional mechanisms leading to large phenotypic
divergence among yeasts, often related to the wholegenome duplication event [24,30,31]. Accordingly, we
reasoned that matched expression time courses of three
yeasts might reveal evolutionary differences in the transcriptional stress response elicited by an anti-fungal
drug.

Results and discussion
Kl is dramatically more sensitive to fluconazole than
other species

For each of the three species Sc, Cg, and Kl, we obtained
standard laboratory strains for which genome sequences
were available (Materials and methods). We examined
the phenotypic response of these species to a range of
concentrations of fluconazole (Additional file 1: Testing
Fluconazole Susceptibility), a triazole antifungal drug
commonly used in the treatment and prevention of

superficial and systemic fungal infections [4]. We found
that Kl was approximately 70 times more sensitive to
fluconazole than Sc and Cg, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.06 μg/ml versus 4.0 μg/ml for both Sc
and Cg (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). Cross-species
differences in sensitivity could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in membrane permeability or
drug transport, divergence in sequence or regulation of
the drug target Erg11, or in any of the pathways previously linked to azole resistance.
Comparative expression profiling of Sc, Cg, and Kl

While it is possible that complementary strategies might
be observed at different fluconazole dosages [20], we
exposed each species to fluconazole at its 50% inhibitory
concentration to facilitate direct comparison of the transcriptional response between species. We then monitored global mRNA expression levels at 1/3, 2/3, 1, 2,
and 4 population doubling times (Figure 1a). We also
found that sampling based on the doubling time of each
species, as opposed to absolute time measurements, led
to greater coherence in the expression profiles across
species (Figure S2 in Additional file 1; Additional file 1:
Analysis of Doubling Time Points vs. Absolute Time
Points). Selected mRNA measurements were validated
using quantitative RT-PCR against six genes (Figure S3
in Additional file 1). We also found significant overlap
of the Sc differentially expressed genes with several previous microarray studies and some overlap with gene
deletions conferring fluconazole sensitivity (Additional
file 1: Microarray Design and Analysis).
To compare expression profiles across species, orthologous genes were defined using MultiParanoid [32]. As
might be expected based on known phylogenetic distances [23], Cg shared more differentially expressed
genes with Sc than with Kl (Figure 1b). We also found
some overlap with previously published C. albicans
microarray data, especially with the functions of the
responsive genes such as those involved in ergosterol
biosynthesis and oxido-reductase activity (Additional file
1: Microarray Design and Analysis).
Soft clustering: a novel cross-species clustering algorithm

Due to factors such as measurement error and ambiguity of cluster boundaries, we found that the available
clustering methods led to situations in which orthologous genes with similar expression patterns could be
misplaced into different clusters (Additional file 1: Constrained Clustering Algorithm). Accordingly, we developed a ‘soft’ clustering approach that integrates
expression profiles with gene sequence orthology in a
modified k-means model. This algorithm includes an
adjustable weight that rewards ortholog co-clustering
(Figures 2a, b; Materials and methods; Additional file 1:

of cell doublings. (b) Venn diagram showing the overlap in the sets of differentially expressed genes selected in each species at a false discovery
rate of q ≤ 0.1. The number of differentially expressed genes in each region of the Venn diagram is not identical across species, since the
number of genes that a species contributes to an orthologous group (that is, number of paralogs) can vary. Ratios in parentheses indicate the
number of differentially expressed orthologs by the total number of differentially expressed genes (not all genes possess orthologs).

Constrained Clustering Algorithm). The term ‘soft clustering’ has also previously been used in other clustering
methods to define cases in which a gene can belong to
more than one cluster rather than any constraint used
to identify clusters [12,13]. Unlike standard clustering
methods, which focus solely on cluster coherence, the
soft clustering method can simultaneously detect both
similar and divergent behavior between orthologs. For
instance, when orthologs are not co-clustered despite
the addition of a reward, one can be assured that their
dynamic profiles truly differ. The weight W and the
number of clusters k were scanned over a range of
values (Figure 2c). We selected W = 0.75 and k = 17 as
choices that approximately optimized the enrichment
for Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Additional file 1: Constrained Clustering Algorithm; Additional file 1: Selecting Parameters for the Constrained Clustering Method).
We compared our soft clustering approach to additional standard clustering methods (Figure S4a in Additional file 1). In comparison to classical k-means
(equivalent to W = 0), the fraction of co-clustered
orthologs increased from approximately 35% to 70%,
with a negligible increase in within-cluster variance (Figure 2d). For W > 0.75, we saw no improvement in the
number of enriched GO terms, a marked increase in

total cluster variance, and little improvement in the fraction of co-clustered orthologs (Additional file 1:
Constrained Clustering Algorithm). Since k-means is
non-deterministic, to ensure robustness the results of 50
runs of the algorithm were used to populate a matrix
recording the fraction of times each gene pair was coclustered. This matrix was used as a similarity matrix
for subsequent hierarchical clustering (Figure 2e; Additional file 1: Co-clustering Matrix). The resulting 17
cross-species gene expression clusters are shown in Figure 3a, b, Figure S7 in Additional file 1, and Table S1 in
Additional file 2.
Conservation of cis-regulatory motifs across clusters

We found that two cross-species clusters (13 and 14)
were highly enriched for ergosterol biosynthetic genes
(P ≤ 10-8) and were coherently up-regulated in all three
species - likely in response to ergosterol depletion.
Both clusters were also enriched for the upstream DNAbinding motif of the sterol biosynthesis regulators
Ecm22 and Upc2 [33]. Interestingly, Upc2 has also been
implicated in increased fluconazole resistance in the
fungal pathogen C. albicans [34]. Rox1 motifs were
enriched in Sc and Cg but not Kl. A likely explanation
for this divergence is that Rox1 is a repressor of

hypoxia-induced genes, and Kl both lacks a Rox1 ortholog and the capacity for anaerobic growth.
Beyond the clusters representing ergosterol biosynthesis, we found two additional clusters (9 and 16) in which
high conservation of expression patterns, sequence
orthology, and cis-motif conservation were observed
across species. Cluster 9 was regulated by the general
stress-response transcription factors Msn2p and Msn4p
(q < 10-5; Additional file 1: Expression Conservation of
the General Stress Response) and showed GO enrichment for oxido-reductase activity (q <10-8) and carbohydrate metabolism (q <10-7). Cluster 16 was enriched for
ribosomal biogenesis and assembly (q <10 -13 ) with

upstream PAC [35] and RRPE motifs previously implicated in regulating genes involved in the general stress
response and ribosomal regulation (Additional file 1:
Expression Conservation of the General Stress Response)
[28,31,35,36].
For other clusters, conserved motifs were absent, suggesting divergence across species. This lack of motif
conservation was particularly surprising for clusters 3, 4,
7, and 11, which contained large numbers of coexpressed orthologous genes. On the other hand, this
finding is consistent with previous studies finding low
motif conservation [24,28,30,31]. We also found no significant enrichment for binding sites of orthologous

clusters, measured using the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets. Only significant edges (P < 0.01) are

transcription factors (Tac1, Mrr1, Crz1) known to mediate fluconazole-resistance in the evolutionarily diverged
pathogen C. albicans [37].
Despite application of the soft-clustering algorithm,
some clusters nevertheless shared significant gene
orthology (but not expression) with other clusters, such
as clusters 10 and 15 in Figure 3a. In these cases, we
also found no conserved motifs between these clusters,
indicating both promoter and expression divergence
among orthologs in addition to species-specific motifs
(Additional file 1: Species-specific Motifs).
Co-clustering implicates both highly conserved and
divergent pathways

Next, we analyzed the soft clusters to identify pathways
for which the fluconazole response is either highly conserved or strikingly divergent. For this purpose, differentially expressed pathways were identified using the GO
Biological Process database [38] (Materials and methods). For each pathway, we computed the number of

orthologous gene groups for which: 1, all three species
were in the same cluster (full co-clustering); 2, two species were in the same cluster (partial co-clustering);
or 3, no two species were in the same cluster (no coclustering). The pathways with the highest percentage of
orthologs with full co-clustering are shown in Figure 4a.
The pathways with the highest percentage of orthologs
that do not co-cluster are shown in Figure 4b. Clustering results for all pathways are given in Table S2 in
Additional file 3.
By this analysis, the most conserved pathway was
ergosterol biosynthesis, which is consistent with our
study of conserved motifs (above). Fluconazole directly
inhibits ergosterol synthesis by targeting of Erg11, and
all species appear to respond strongly to this reduction
in ergosterol by up-regulating the enzymes required for
its novel biosynthesis. ERG11 was up-regulated early in
both Sc and Cg and later in Kl. Since ERG11 overexpression is one mechanism by which yeast can overcome fluconazole-induced growth inhibition [18], delays

in its induction could contribute to Kl’s greater fluconazole sensitivity.
The first stages of ergosterol biosynthesis are carried
out by a subset of enzymes of the isoprenoid pathway.
While most ergosterol genes were coordinately up-regulated in all three species, the expression levels of isoprenoid biosynthesis genes were strikingly divergent
(Figures 4b, d). In all eukaryotes, regulation of isoprenoid biosynthesis is known to be complex with multiple

levels of feedback inhibition [39]. Thus, the extensive
divergence in isoprenoid biosynthesis expression suggests that the regulation of this pathway has also
diverged between species.
Extensive expression divergence was also observed in
methionine biosynthesis and amino acid transport (Figure 4b). Curiously, many Cg methionine biosynthesis
orthologs were strongly down-regulated early in the
time-course (Figure 4e). This strong down-regulation

Kuo et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R77
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/7/R77

was not mirrored in Sc and Kl, which displayed divergent expression responses that were not co-clustered.
Interestingly, it has been previously suggested that differences in methionine biosynthesis may alter azole susceptibility in C. neoformans [40] and C. albicans [41].
Major divergence in mRNA expression of transporters

A final pathway for which we observed striking expression divergence was multi-drug transport (Figure 4b;
Additional file 1: Transport). Most genes in this pathway
were covered by clusters 8, 11, 16 (Figure 5a, b). Multi-

drug transporters are divided into two classes: ATPbinding cassette (ABC) and major facilitator superfamily
(MFS) transporters [5]. We examined the expression
patterns of these transporters and found at least two
types of divergent behaviors. First, the fraction of differentially expressed Sc MFS transporters was low compared to Cg and Kl (Fisher exact test, one-tailed P =
0.025 and 0.020, respectively). Second, the timing of
MFS gene expression differed, with Sc up-regulated late
and Cg up-regulated early (Figure 5b). In SC, several
ABC and MFS transporters have been shown to bind

fluconazole as a substrate [20,42,43]. Of these, we found
that the PDR5/10/15 family of ABC transporters was
up-regulated in Cg and Sc but not Kl. Another fluconazole transporter, SNQ2, was up-regulated in Cg only.
We also found strong differences in the expression of
other multi-drug transporters that have not been previously linked to fluconazole: PDR12 was strongly
down-regulated in Sc and Cg but up-regulated in Kl;
ATR1 and YOR378W were up-regulated in Cg and Kl
but not Sc; HOL1 was up-regulated in Sc and Kl but not
Cg. Some transporters also showed differences in
expression timing (YOR1, PDR12).
Additionally, two ABC transporters, AUS1 and PDR11,
which uptake sterol under anaerobic conditions [44],
were up-regulated in Sc but were not differentially
expressed in Cg (Cg does not possess a PDR11 ortholog). This suggests that Sc but not Cg increases sterol
transport during fluconazole exposure. Intriguingly,
since the direct effect of fluconazole is to inhibit sterol
synthesis, increased sterol transport could be a mechanism for increased fluconazole tolerance. In support of
this hypothesis, we found that the normally repressed
cell wall mannoprotein DAN1, whose expression is
required for sterol uptake [45], was up-regulated in Sc
but not Cg. Since Kl lacks sterol transporters, it cannot
import sterol and only grows aerobically [46,47] (Additional file 1: Analysis of Sterol Import Machinery in
Fungal Genomes). As a possible explanation for this
divergent behavior, we found that the promoter regions
of ScAUS1, ScPDR11, and ScDAN1 contain binding
motifs for ergosterol biosynthesis and/or sterol transport
regulators Ecm22p, Rox1p and Sut1p, all of which were
absent upstream of CgAUS1 and CgDAN1.
Therefore, the striking divergence in expression of
fluconazole export and sterol import pathways suggests
differing strategies in the azole response: following fluconazole exposure, Sc appears to activate sterol influx
through up-regulation of PDR11 and AUS1; in contrast, Cg may activate fluconazole efflux through strong
up-regulation of SNQ2 and a PDR5/10/15 ortholog
(Figure 5a).
Sterol import increases fluconazole tolerance in Sc, but
not Cg or Kl

To investigate these hypotheses, we grew wild-type Sc
and Cg along with deletion mutants Sc.aus1Δ and Sc.
pdr11Δ under fluconazole treatment in the presence or
absence of exogenous ergosterol (4 μg/ml). As shown in
Figure 5c, we found that addition of ergosterol had no
effect on growth of Cg but led to an increase in growth
of Sc (P = 0.018). This increase was attenuated in Sc.
aus1Δ and Sc.pdr11Δ (P = 0.033), which lack sterol
import genes, but not in an unrelated control knockout,
Sc.bpt1Δ. Thus, Sc but not Cg is aided by adding

Page 8 of 12

ergosterol to the environment, and this process is likely
dependent on AUS1 and/or PDR11.
Three additional lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Sc prefers sterol import while Cg prefers fluconazole export in response to fluconazole treatment. A
retrospective analysis of deletion mutant fitness in Sc
[48] revealed that a greater proportion of gene deletions
involved in the sterol pathway lead to fluconazole sensitivity than deletion of fluconazole transporters themselves (Fisher exact test, one-tailed P = 0.043). This
suggests a role for sterol transporters in the Sc fluconazole response. Second, fluconazole tolerance in Cg has
been shown to be unaffected when constitutively expressing CgAUS1 in the presence of exogenous free cholesterol (though not in the presence of serum) [49]. Third,
deletion of the Cg orthologs of fluconazole transporters
PDR5 (CgCDR1) [50] or SNQ2 [51] both resulted in
increased fluconazole sensitivity.
Expression of sterol importers in Kl increases fluconazole
tolerance

Since Kl neither up-regulates drug exporters nor
encodes sterol importers, we considered that this lack of
a transport response might be responsible for the higher
drug sensitivity we observed for Kl in relation to the
other species. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found
that Kl growth was unaffected by addition of exogenous
ergosterol (Figure 5c), similar to Cg but in sharp contrast to Sc. We also predicted that transgenic expression
of sterol importers ScAus1 or ScPdr11 in Kl might
increase fluconazole tolerance in the presence of exogenous ergosterol. To test this prediction, we chromosomally integrated ScAUS1 and ScPDR11 into Kl
non-disruptively at the KlLAC4 locus under control of
the strong constitutive Kl PLAC4-PBI promoter (Materials
and methods). Transformed Kl strains were grown
under fluconazole treatment with and without exogenous ergosterol (4 μg/ml). We observed that transgenic
expression of sterol importer AUS1 in Kl significantly
increased fluconazole tolerance (P = 0.012; Figure 5c) in
an ergosterol-dependent manner. Thus, it appears that
differences in sterol import and drug export are responsible for a component of the anti-fungal response, and
of the observed functional divergence across the three
yeast species.

Conclusions
In this study, we have compared the dynamic transcriptional responses of three diverse yeast species to fluconazole treatment, revealing significant divergence in
their regulatory programs. The data suggest several different mechanisms of azole tolerance, depending on the
species (Figure 5d). The Sc response depends on sterol
influx, through up-regulation of PDR11 and AUS1. In

Kuo et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R77
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/7/R77

contrast, the Cg response relies on fluconazole efflux
through strong up-regulation of SNQ2 and a PDR5/10/
15 ortholog. Neither of these responses have evolved in
Kl, leading to its severe drug sensitivity. These conclusions are supported by follow-up experiments demonstrating that growth in ergosterol increases the
fluconazole tolerance of Sc, but not other species, in a
PDR11- and AUS1-dependent fashion. They are also
supported by the finding that transgenic expression of
AUS1 in Kl increases the fluconazole tolerance of this
species.
To arrive at these conclusions, we employed a novel
‘soft clustering’ approach that is of general use in the
fields of comparative and systems biology. This
approach is distinct from other methods for cross-species expression analysis [27,28,30,52] in several important ways. Chief among these, it integrates sequence
orthology with gene expression patterns to produce
accurate orthologous clusters. This integration is accomplished by a symmetric process that does not require the
designation of one species as a reference. In addition,
soft clustering handles data from more than two species
and can, in principle, analyze any number of species
simultaneously. In future, such approaches might be
used to survey a wider range of species, drug concentrations and stimuli to reveal conserved and divergent
molecular response pathways.

Materials and methods
Strains and growth conditions

Standard laboratory strains with known genomic
sequence [53] were used: Sc BY4741, Cg CBS138
(ATCC 2001), and Kl NRRL Y-1140 (ATCC 8585). Cultures were grown in rich media (YPD) from OD600 of
0.05 to 0.2 at 30°C and 225 rpm. Cells were treated with
fluconazole at species-specific sub-inhibitory concentrations (Figure S1 in Additional file 1), and harvested at 0,
1/3, 2/3, 1, 2 or 4 doubling times as measured for
untreated cells.
Microarray expression profiling

RNA was isolated by hot phenol/chloroform extraction and enriched for mRNA via poly-A selection
(Ambion 1916, Austin, TX, USA). mRNA from
untreated cells was combined in equal amounts from
all time points to form a species-specific reference
sample. Six replicates per time point were dUTP
labeled (three biological replicates by two technical
replicates) with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes (Invitrogen
SKU11904-018, Carlsbad, CA, USA) creating a dyeswapped reference design. Samples were hybridized to
Agilent expression arrays using the protocol recommended by Agilent. Differential expression was called
using the VERA error model [54] and false discovery

rate multiple-test correction [55]. Additional description of both the microarray platform and analysis can
be found in Additional file 1.
Soft clustering algorithm

We developed a constrained clustering method based on
the k-means algorithm, but using a revised objective
function (Additional file 1). Like regular k-means, the
objective function considers the similarity of each gene’s
expression profile to the center of its assigned class.
However, it also rewards class assignments in which
orthologs are co-clustered. The reward (W) is a userdefined parameter that serves as a tradeoff between
cluster expression coherence and percentage of co-clustered orthologs: each gene, x Î X, is assigned to cluster
h* such as to minimize the objective function:
h * = arg min(
h

∑ ( D( x , C

h ) − W ))

where ∑(D(x, Ch) - W) refers to all possible partitions
of genes in the same orthology group, D() refers to a
user defined distance function, and Ch denotes the center of cluster h. As discussed in the main text and in
Additional file 1, the appropriate value of the reward,
W, can be determined using complementary information. Here, it was tuned to maximize the GO enrichment of the clusters.
The new objective function also leads to changes in
the search algorithm for determining the optimal cluster
assignments: for each group of orthologs across the
three species, we search for the partitions that result in
the minimum total distance between all pairs of group
members. Since there are 2m possible subgroups, where
m is the size of the orthology group (here, most orthology groups are of size m = 3), and each subgroup is
checked for all possible k clusters, the search complexity
for each group is O(2m * k). Since m is small, the running time of the algorithm is typically very fast. Detailed
methods, including algorithm pseudo-code, are presented in Additional file 1.
Identifying highly conserved and divergent pathways

We first ranked GO processes categories [38] based on
their significance of overlap with differentially expressed
orthologous groups [32]. An orthologous group was
considered differentially expressed if at least one member was differentially expressed. We used the top 20
ranked GO processes for identifying conserved and
divergent pathways. Conserved pathways were defined
as those with the highest ‘full co-clustering’ fraction of
genes known to be involved in the process and divergent pathways were defined as those with the highest
‘no co-clustering’ fractions.

Insertion of ScAUS1/ScPDR11 into Kl

To facilitate insertion of ScAUS1 and ScPDR11 into Kl,
open reading frames were placed under control of the
strong P LAC4-PBI promoter by cloning into plasmid
pKLAC2 (NEB N3742S), which possesses approximately
2-kb homology to the Kl.LAC4 locus. Open reading
frames were amplified with a SacI restriction site (3’
end), which was used to ligate a kanamycin marker
from pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen K-2800-20). XhoI (5’ end)
and SbfI (3’ end) restriction sites were added by PCR for
ligation into pKLAC2. Modified plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli and screened on Luria-Bertani media containing ampicillin and kanamycin.
Plasmids were mini-prepped (GE Healthcare #US7922050RXNS, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and verified by PCR and
SacII digestion. All restriction enzymes were obtained
from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA).
SacII-linearized plasmids were transformed into Kl
NRRL Y-1140 by electroporation, thereby inserting
ScAUS1 and ScPDR11 non-disruptively at the Kl.LAC4
locus. Colonies were selected on YCB + 5 mM acetamide (New England Biolabs N3742 S and verified by
PCR. mRNA expression of ScAUS1 and ScPDR11 was
validated by quantitative RT-PCR.
