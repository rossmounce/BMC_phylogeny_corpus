Abstract
Molecular epidemiological investigation of measles outbreaks can document the interruption of
endemic measles transmission and is useful for establishing and clarifying epidemiological links
between cases in geographically distinct clusters. To determine the distribution of measles virus
genotypes in the prevaccine and postvaccine eras, a literature search of biomedical databases,
measles surveillance websites and other electronic sources was conducted for English language
reports of measles outbreaks or genetic characterization of measles virus isolates. Genotype
assignments based on classification systems other than the currently accepted WHO nomenclature
were reassigned using the current criteria. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the
distribution of MV genotypes in the prevaccine and postvaccine eras and describes the
geographically diverse distribution of some measles virus genotypes and the localized distributions
of other genotypes.

Introduction
Although measles virus (MV) is serologically monotypic,
the genetic characterization of wild-type viruses has identified eight clades (A – H), which have been divided into
22 genotypes and one proposed genotype. Clades B, C, D,
G and H each contain multiple genotypes (B1 – 3, C1 – 2,
D1 – 10, G1 – 3, H1 – 2) while clades A, E and F each contain a single genotype (A, E, F) [1,2]. The sequences of the
vaccine strains indicate that the wild type viruses from
which they were derived were all members of genotype A.
All measles genotypes can be neutralized by serum from
vaccinated persons in vitro, although with varying efficiency [3,4]. There are no known biological differences
between viruses of different genotypes. Specific measles
genotypes are not associated with differences in severity of

disease, likelihood of developing severe sequela such as
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis or inclusion body
encephalitis, or variability in sensitivity of laboratory
diagnosis.
Analysis of the variability in the nucleotide sequences of
wild-type MVs has enabled the use of molecular epidemiologic techniques for measles surveillance. The molecular
data, when used in conjunction with standard case reporting and investigation, can help to identify epidemiological links between geographically distinct cases and
outbreaks as well as track importations of MV. [5-7]. Also,
approximately 5% of vaccine recipients experience mild
symptoms (rash and fever) after vaccination and these
cases could be misclassified as wild-type measles [8].

[11]. New genotypes are designated if the nucleotide
sequence differs from the closest reference sequence by
more than 2.5% in N and 2.0% in H [2]. Additionally,
phylogenetic analysis should produce similar tree topographies using at least two different analysis methods. Several isolates or clinical specimens should be sequenced
and at least one viral isolate should be available as the reference strain. Finally, new genotype classifications should
be useful for epidemiological studies, by providing a
means to identify the source or transmission pathway of
infection and by contributing to our understanding of the
global distribution of MV genotypes [2].
The purpose of this summary is to collate all available
reports of MV genotypes and to standardize the published
genotype nomenclature, according to the current WHO
criteria, with the aim of giving a comprehensive overview
of the distribution of MV genotypes in the prevaccine and
postvaccine eras.

Methods
An examination of the National Library of Medicine
"PubMed" [13] search engine using the keyword "measles" combined with "genotypes" and "sequence" was performed to identify English language publications or
abstracts describing measles genotyping.

Genetic characterization of viral isolates or RT-PCR products is the only laboratory test that can differentiate
between vaccine-associated cases and wild-type infection
[6,9,10].
In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a standard protocol for the designation of measles genotypes. These recommendations, updated in 2001
and 2003, also included a standard analysis protocol and
designation of standard reference strains (see Additional
file 2) against which all newly characterized isolates
should be compared [2,11,12]. The minimum amount of
sequence data required to assign a virus to a genotype are
the 450 nucleotides encoding the carboxy terminus of the
N protein. The entire sequence of the coding region of the
H gene should be obtained from representative isolates

Additional sources included the reference lists of articles
identified by "PubMed" and electronic sources such as the
CDC and PAHO measles network Internet pages and the
NCBI Genbank website [14-16]. Measles outbreak alerts
were received through the WHO network, which distributes outbreak notifications. In addition, subscription
based electronic newsletters such as ProMED mail [17]
and Immunization newsbrief [18] were scrutinized for
information relating to measles outbreaks. Direct contact
was made with the notifying laboratory or health unit
requesting genotype information if available.
A table produced by participants at the 1998 WHO meeting listed older classification systems and the comparable
genotype classifications under the universally accepted
system. This table was used to reclassify genotypes cited in
publications prior to 1998 [11]. In some cases, later publications from the same or other groups were used to
assign current genotypes to viruses classified before 1998.

Results and Discussion
One hundred and twenty eight studies were identified
through the PubMed search, 67 of which described the
genotype of MV isolates. Four internet websites were identified (including Genbank) and a further 27 articles were
identified from the reference lists of cited publications or
from outbreak notification lists such as ProMED [17] and
Immunization Newsbrief [18].

Figure 1 and Table 1 summarize the temporal and geographical distribution of MV genotypes from the early
1950s to 2004 but do not differentiate between cases of
endemic or imported measles virus. Genotype and location specific references are not cited in the following
results section but can be found in the relevant genotype
specific section in the comprehensive table which accompanies this paper (see Additional file 1, also available
from the website of the WHO Western Pacific Regional
Reference Laboratory for measles, The Victorian Infectious
Diseases Reference Laboratory, Melbourne, Australia
http://www.vidrl.org.au/labsandunits/measles/
meas_genotyping.htm).
Routine molecular characterization of wild-type measles
viruses was initiated in response to a global resurgence of
measles disease in the late 1980s and the concurrent availability of sensitive techniques (e.g. RT-PCR and automated sequencing) for the investigation of viral genomes.
Prior to that date, only a few isolates of measles were available for molecular characterization and reliable epidemiologic information was not available for many of these
isolates. In the era before the widespread use of measles
vaccine, genotypes A, C1, and D1 were detected. Genotype A virus includes the prototype Edmonston strain, the

progenitor for most of the current measles vaccines. Analysis of MV sequences obtained from SSPE cases, resulting
from initial infections that occurred during the 1950s and
1960s, detected genotypes C1, D1, E and F, providing further evidence that genotype A was not the only genotype
detected during the prevaccine era [19-24]. However, data
from these earlier studies must be interpreted cautiously
due to the large number of mutations in SSPE sequences
and the lack of standardization. Of course, detection of
various genotypes in SSPE cases reflects efforts to study
this devastating illness and should not be taken as an indication that one genotype is more likely to cause SSPE than
another [25]. Retrospective sequence analysis of viral isolates collected during the 1970s showed continued detection of genotypes C1 and D1 and the first detections of
genotypes C2, D2, D4, E and F.
As virologic surveillance expanded in the late 1980s and
1990s, the number of genotypes detected in cases and outbreaks increased substantially to include the 23 genotypes
now recognized by the WHO. However, some genotypes
(B1, D1, E, F, G1) have not been detected in the last 15
years and are considered inactive.

Genotype A has been detected in acute cases of measles in
South and North America, China, Japan, Eastern Europe,
Finland and the UK over the last 40 years. Since, it is difficult to distinguish wild-type viruses in genotype A from
vaccine strains, these reports must be interpreted with caution since some of the sequences may have been derived
from vaccine associated cases or been the result of laboratory contamination [22,26,27]. In the future, detection of
genotype A viruses in association with acute cases of measles will need to be thoroughly scrutinized and additional
sequence data will need to be obtained from both clinical
samples and corresponding viral isolates.
Genotype B2, previously considered inactive [12], has
recently been detected in South Africa and Angola [28].
Genotype B3 was first detected in 1993 in Gambia but has
subsequently been detected in cases from Cameroon,
Nigeria, Ghana, Burkina Faso, DR Congo and the Sudan.
This genotype is the endemic genotype of West and Central Africa and has been imported into numerous countries including France, Germany and the USA.
Outbreaks involving genotype C1 have occurred in Canada, Japan, Germany and most recently in the early 1990s
in Argentina, which was the last reported outbreak involving genotype C1 circulation. Genotype C2 has circulated
widely throughout the European continent and has been
exported to the USA and Canada from France, Italy and
Germany, where it was known to be an endemic genotype
until 2001. This genotype was also identified in Australia
from 1990 to 1991 and Morocco in 1998 & 1999. An
importation of genotype C2 to the USA was linked with
travel from Zimbabwe in 1998 although there are no
reports to indicate that this strain was circulating in Southern Africa during this time [6].
Characterization of archived MV isolates in Australia from
1971, suggest that genotype D1 may have been the
endemic strain in Australia during the pre-vaccine era.
Sequences from SSPE cases in Northern Ireland and the
UK indicate that genotype D1 was also detected in Britain
before the widespread use of vaccine. Genotype D1 has
not been detected since 1986 and is considered inactive.
Genotype D2 appears to have been the endemic strain of
Southern Africa from the late 1970s to 2000. This genotype was also responsible for the large outbreak in Ireland
in 1999 – 2000, which resulted in importations to both
the UK and USA. Genotype D3 is currently endemic in
Papua New Guinea and possibly the Philippines, given
that several measles cases in the USA have been linked
with travel from the Philippines. Additionally this genotype has been associated with a case of SSPE in South
Africa, and has been detected in Australia, USA and Canada, the UK and Denmark, in most cases with epidemiological links of importation from Japan or the Philippines.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/87

Genotype D4 is widely distributed and has been associated with multiple outbreaks on the Indian sub-continent, East and South Africa and a large outbreak in
Quebec Province, Canada in 1989. Recently genotype D4
viruses, imported from the Indian sub-continent and East
and South Africa, have been epidemiologically linked
with cases in Canada, the USA, the UK, other European
countries and Australia. Genotypes D4 and D2 appear to
have been co-circulating in Southern Africa from the late
1970s to the late 1990s. Genotype D5 is endemic in Cambodia and has been associated with measles cases detected
in the Americas, the UK, Germany and Australia. Epidemiological investigations have identified Japan and Thailand
as the main sources for these importations. Until recently
both genotype D3, and genotype D5 were endemic in
Japan [26,29-31]. However, recent evidence suggests that
these genotypes may no longer be predominant in Japan
[32]. Genotype D6 has circulated widely throughout the
European continent and may have been the endemic genotype of Europe, in conjunction with genotype C2, since
the 1990s. This genotype is endemic in Turkey [33] and
the Russian Federation [34]. Genotype D7 circulated in
the UK and Australia during the 1980s. Chains of transmission of this genotype have been associated, through
epidemiological investigations, with Sweden and other
European countries, including Italy where it was identified in the large measles outbreak in 2002. Genotype D7
has been imported into the US from multiple European
sources from 2001 to 2003. Recently this genotype
replaced genotypes C2 and D6 as the most commonly isolated genotype in Germany [35]. Genotype D8 appears to
be co-circulating with genotype D4 on the Indian subcontinent and Ethiopia, although the first known description of this genotype was in the UK, from where it has
been regularly detected. However, investigations have
linked UK cases with importations of virus not only from
the Indian sub-continent but also from the Balkans and
Oman [36]. Genotype D8 has been imported into Australia and the USA from India and Bangladesh. Genotype
D9, first described after importation to Australia from
Indonesia (Bali) in 1999, was isolated during the large
outbreak in 2000 – 2001 in Colombia and Venezuela. D9
was associated with an outbreak in Japan in 2004. Analysis of wild-type viruses isolated in Uganda in 2000–2002
indicated the presence of a new genotype, which has been
proposed as genotype d10 [Genbank accession numbers
through
AY923212]
[37].
AY923185
A few genotype E viruses and related SSPE cases were
reported in the early 1970s. Genotype F sequences have
been identified on two occasions, both were SSPE cases
wherein acute measles infection was documented in 1967
and 1968. Thus both genotypes E and F probably circulated in the pre-vaccine era [19,22].

Clade G, previously consisting of one genotype (G), has
recently been expanded to contain three genotypes. The
original genotype G (now G1) had not been detected
since 1983 and was thought to have been extinct. However, recent investigations have identified two new genotypes (G2 & G3), both of which have been predominantly
associated with chains of transmission within and importation from Indonesia and Malaysia [38-40].
Clade H viruses originally consisted of a single genotype
but recently this clade has been expanded to contain two
genotypes (H1 & H2). Both genotypes are predominant in
the Asian and South East Asian regions. Genotype H1 has
mainly been associated with transmission within or
importations from China and was detected during the
large measles epidemic in Korea in 2000 – 2001 [41].
Genotype H1 may now be dominant in Japan [32,42].
The WHO Western Pacific Regional Reference Laboratory
for measles recently confirmed circulation of this genotype in Mongolia. Genotype H2, first described from samples recovered from China, has been more recently
associated with importations from Vietnam [43].
Some genotypes of MV are associated with a particular
geographical region, while other genotypes are more
widely distributed. In particular, clade B is predominant
in measles transmission in Sub Saharan and Central
Africa, clade G in South East Asia and clade H in South
East Asia and China. Clade D viruses, on the other hand,
appear to be more widely distributed and are endemic in
Eastern Africa, parts of Europe and the Indian sub-continent.
Determination of measles genotypes in countries that
have not yet conducted molecular surveillance can be
investigated, by proxy, from cases epidemiologically
linked to imported cases. For example, the Philippines
have not reported an endemic MV genotype but multiple
importations to the USA associated with travel to, or contact with, the Philippines have resulted in the supposition
that genotype D3 is the predominant circulating genotype
in the Philippines [6,44]. However, caution must be taken
when identifying genotypes by proxy as the genotype
detected may not be the type that is endemic in the region.
In some cases, genotypes have been epidemiologically
linked to countries with no history of circulation of that
genotype. For example, genotype G2 has been reportedly
associated with importations to the UK from Mexico,
South Africa and Australia, none of which have reported
endemic circulation of genotype G2 [36]. In these cases
infection may have occurred while the patient was in transit or at venues frequented by other travellers and might
not reflect the circulating genotype.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/87

Simultaneous circulation of multiple genotypes has been
reported in several regions. Genotypes D3 and D5 co-circulated in Japan since the mid 1980s and the relative
number of isolations changed over time. During the late
1980s genotype D3 was detected more frequently, but by
1990 D5 was more common [42,45]. Genotypes D2 and
D4 appear to be co-circulating throughout Eastern and
Southern Africa. Genotypes C2 and D6 continue to be
detected in some parts of Europe and North Africa [35].
Rima et al described a shift from genotype C2 to genotype
D6 in Spain in the early 1990s [24]. Santibanez et al
recently demonstrated the shift from detection of mostly
genotypes C2 and D6 in Germany to detection of mostly
genotype D7 [46]. The shift of genotypes occurs in countries that have sub-optimal measles control programs,
resulting in interruption of endemic transmission for
short periods. However, failure to maintain high levels of
population immunity results in the accumulation of susceptible individuals and creates conditions that favour the
rapid transmission of a newly introduced genotype.
Therefore, the apparent genotype switching is most likely
due to changes in the distribution of susceptible individuals in the region.
Nine new MV genotypes have been identified since 1990
reflecting increased surveillance of measles cases and technological advances, rather than recent evolution. The designation of new genotypes, such as the newly proposed
genotype d10, is likely to continue as the molecular analysis of viral isolates becomes routinely integrated into
more countries within the global WHO measles laboratory network and more sequence data are added to the
database. For example, genotype B3 may eventually be
reclassified as two separate genotypes since this genotype
contains viruses in two distinct clusters [47-49]. Characterization of viruses imported into Australia has detected
three previously unrecognised genotypes (D7, D9 & G3)
due partly to the frequency of travel between South East
Asia and Australia and also to the comprehensive measles
surveillance conducted by Australian laboratories
[7,38,50].
The mutation rate amongst field isolates of MV is low and
appears to be random rather than driven by vaccine pressure or immune responses [3,24,26]. Within a genotype,
nucleotide differences (virus lineage) can assist in distinguishing separate episodes of transmission [24,51,52]. In
countries or regions with endemic (ongoing and constant
MV transmission) measles, many lineages of a single genotype may co-exist; however as countries begin to move
from endemic to epidemic measles (MV transmission
resulting in a higher number of cases than normally
expected, typically against a background of little or no MV
transmission)[53], the diversity of sequences within the

circulating genotypes decreases [43,54-57]. In fact, the
genotype D6 virus associated with a large measles outbreak that occurred in several South American countries
between 1996 and 1997 had identical N gene sequences
suggesting rapid spread of a single lineage [51]. Analysis
of measles viruses circulating in Burkina Faso, before and
after a mass vaccination campaign, showed that the
number of circulating lineages was greatly reduced following the campaign. Sequence analysis of viruses isolated
from outbreaks that occurred after the vaccination campaign suggested that virus was introduced from a single
source [57].

Additional File 1
Many recent measles outbreaks have been reported with
no accompanying molecular genotyping investigations,
for instance in Afghanistan [58], Niger [59] and the Philippines [60]. These outbreaks highlight the need to extend
molecular surveillance capabilities to regions where measles remains endemic. Recent studies have described the
recovery of MV RNA by RT-PCR from oral fluid, dried
blood and dried oral fluid [61-63]. These samples, which
are easy to collect, prepare and transport by post to laboratories capable of MV genotyping, have the potential to
extend molecular surveillance for measles virus to remote
settings and countries with limited infrastructure. However conventional samples such as nasopharyngeal swabs,
urine and peripheral blood lymphocytes should continue
to be collected, if logistically possible, because of the
higher sensitivity of these sample types for detecting MV
RNA.
Molecular surveillance undertaken in the early stages of
measles control can facilitate identification of endemic
genotypes. Over time or after intervention programs continued molecular surveillance, in conjunction with case
based epidemiological investigations, can detect the interruption of endemic transmission [1]. Additionally, molecular analysis of specimens from cases facilitates both
linkage to, and separation from, contemporaneous cases
and clusters, assisting classical epidemiological investigations and the tracking of chains of transmission [7,64].
