diArk 2.0 provides detailed analyses of the ever
increasing eukaryotic genome sequencing data
Björn Hammesfahr†, Florian Odronitz†, Marcel Hellkamp and Martin Kollmar*

Abstract
Background: Nowadays, the sequencing of even the largest mammalian genomes has become a question of days
with current next-generation sequencing methods. It comes as no surprise that dozens of genome assemblies are
released per months now. Since the number of next-generation sequencing machines increases worldwide and
new major sequencing plans are announced, a further increase in the speed of releasing genome assemblies is
expected. Thus it becomes increasingly important to get an overview as well as detailed information about
available sequenced genomes. The different sequencing and assembly methods have specific characteristics that
need to be known to evaluate the various genome assemblies before performing subsequent analyses.
Results: diArk has been developed to provide fast and easy access to all sequenced eukaryotic genomes
worldwide. Currently, diArk 2.0 contains information about more than 880 species and more than 2350 genome
assembly files. Many meta-data like sequencing and read-assembly methods, sequencing coverage, GC-content,
extended lists of alternatively used scientific names and common species names, and various kinds of statistics are
provided. To intuitively approach the data the web interface makes extensive usage of modern web techniques.
A number of search modules and result views facilitate finding and judging the data of interest. Subscribing to the
RSS feed is the easiest way to stay up-to-date with the latest genome data.
Conclusions: diArk 2.0 is the most up-to-date database of sequenced eukaryotic genomes compared to databases
like GOLD, NCBI Genome, NHGRI, and ISC. It is different in that only those projects are stored for which genome
assembly data or considerable amounts of cDNA data are available. Projects in planning stage or in the process of
being sequenced are not included. The user can easily search through the provided data and directly access the
genome assembly files of the sequenced genome of interest. diArk 2.0 is available at http://www.diark.org.

Background
The International Human Genome Project needed
almost 13 years for the sequencing of the first human
genome [1]. While Celera, using the same Sanger technique, already accelerated human genome sequencing to
three years by applying a whole genome shotgun instead
of the primer based approach [2], the sequencing of even
the largest mammalian genomes has become only a matter of days with current next-generation sequencing
methods [3]. The bottleneck for providing the analysis of
a eukaryotic genome is thus not the sequencing process
anymore [4]. The most time consuming part is the
assembly and even more the annotation of genes, RNA,

Biophysikalische Chemie, Am Fassberg 11, D-37077 Göttingen, Germany

and other genetic features [5]. Nevertheless, while only a
few genome assemblies have been made public per year
at the beginning of the century, dozens of genome assemblies are released per month today. A further increase in
the speed of releasing genome assemblies may be
expected because of the increasing number of nextgeneration sequencing machines worldwide [6], together
with the announcement of major sequencing plans (see
for example the 1000 human genomes project [7], the
1001 arabidopsis genomes project [8], the 1,000 Plant &
Animal reference genomes project [9], and the 10,000
vertebrates genomes project [10]).
There are many steps to produce a complete and gapless genome sequence of an organism. First draft versions
often contain sets of so-called contigs that have been built
from the assembly of whole genome shotgun reads. The
genome coverage is the most important factor determining

contig length. In the following steps during the assembly
process the contigs are organised into supercontigs and
finally into chromosomes. In the finishing process, gaps are
filled by direct sequencing of the corresponding regions.
However, the publication of the genome sequence of an
organism does not correlate with the status of the assembly
process. Some genome assemblies have been published
although they are very fragmented and represent rather
early draft assemblies (e.g. [11-14]), while finishing and
gap-closing have already been done for other genomes still
waiting to be published. It is obvious that analyses based
on genes, genomic regions, or proteins need high coverage
genome sequences and assemblies to very long contigs or
even supercontigs. This is especially true for the analysis of
genes of higher eukaryotes that are often spread over hundred thousands of base pairs.
How can a researcher find out which organisms have
already been sequenced, how good the quality of the latest
assembly is, and what the differences between the sometimes many different assemblies of the same genome are?
To provide access to genome data, five major databases
have been developed: GOLD [15], NCBI Genome Project
(will soon be reorganized into NCBI BioProject) [16],
National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)
[17], International Sequencing Consortium [18], and diArk
[19]. The GOLD database monitors finished and ongoing
genome and metagenome sequencing projects of all
branches of the tree of life [15]. The largest part of the
database is related to prokaryotes for which most of the
about 130 metadata fields have been designed. GOLD’s
strength therefore is the listing of the prokaryotes, while it
is outdated for eukaryotes. For example, GOLD announces
156 eukaryotes as published (although several of these are
listed as “unpublished” in the table, status: March 10, 2011)
while genome assemblies of 358 eukaryotes have been published according to diArk (status: March 10, 2011). The
NCBI Genome Project pages list all sequencing centres
participating in a certain sequencing project and provides
many links to other species resources (species databases,
BLAST and genome browser pages, publications, etc.).
However, the list of these projects is far from being up-todate. Here, 431 eukaryotes are available and listed as complete or draft assembly, while diArk provides assemblies for
613 species. The NHGRI hosts a list of approved sequencing targets (almost exclusively eukaryotic) with limited
additional information. However, most eukaryotic projects
are not listed, and the project status (not started, in process, complete) is often not up-to-date. For example, the
sequencing of Geomyces destructans is still listed as “not
started” although a very good draft assembly is already
available. The International Sequencing Consortium hosts
a list of comparable information to the NHGRI.
diArk 2.0 is the most up-to-date database for eukaryotic
sequencing projects, providing in the latest version many

meta-data like sequencing and read-assembly methods,
sequencing coverage, GC-content, extended lists of alternatively used scientific names and common species
names, and various kinds of statistics. diArk only lists
those projects, for which genome assemblies or considerable amounts of cDNA data are available. diArk does not
list projects that are planned, and does not track the
various stages of the genome sequencing process (species
targeted, awaiting DNA, DNA library prepared, etc.) as it
is done by GOLD [15]. Due to the next-generation
sequencing methods sequencing has become so fast and
cheap that the time frame between planning and finishing
sequencing projects is in the order of weeks and not years
anymore. Although independent groups have not
sequenced too many identical species yet, sequencing has
started to become competitive so that project plans are
often not announced anymore and finished sequences
claimed by press releases [20]. The virtue of the sequencing projects is the data, and thus the intention of diArk is
to provide easy and fast access to where and which eukaryotic data may be obtained.

Methods
The technologies

The system is running on Linux. The database management system is PostgreSQL [21] supported by pgpool-II
[22]. The web application framework is Ruby on Rails
[23], which is based on the object orientated programming language Ruby [24]. In order to present the user
with a feature rich interface while minimizing the
amount of transferred data the site makes extensive use
of modern Web 2.0 techniques like Ajax (Asynchronous
JavaScript and XML) using Prototype [25], and Lightwindow [26]. Graphs are drawn using the graphical
toolkit Protovis [27,28], the statistical programming language R [29], and SVG [30]. Ruby together with BioRuby [31] is also used for scripts that automatically
retrieve data via the NCBI-API, reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of diArk’s species, and analyse genome assembly files. All technologies used are freely available and
open source.
The database

diArk has been developed with a custom database
schema due to the unique requirements of the system
[19]. Initially, three interconnected tables had been at
the centre of the database: species, projects, and publications. This basic concept has significantly been extended
by more than doubling the number of database tables
and by increasing the number of fields in existing tables
(Additional file 1). Most importantly, a table for genome
file data has been added to which several further tables
are connected representing sequencing and assembly
methods (Figure 1, Additional file 1).

Figure 1 Schematic organisation of the database. The diagram shows the major tables of the database and their connections. Some of the
content fields of the three main tables Species, Project, and Genome File are listed. Details to publications are obtained from NCBI via their API.
The References table contains the major sequencing centres and species project web pages.

The genome file table contains information about genome assemblies. Genome assembly files are retrieved
from sequencing centres, dedicated species/taxa sequencing pages, or from the NCBI database. While some
information is directly calculated from the assembly files,
other information is manually added to the genome file
table. Every assembly file gets a genome type identifier
based on the fasta-entries. The most important genome
types are Chromosome, Uchromosome (these files contain contigs/supercontigs, which could not be mapped to
any (unknown chromosome) or anchored (random chromosome) to a certain chromosome), Supercontigs, Contigs, Ureads (unplaced reads), Apicoplast, Chloroplast,
Kinetoplast, and Mito (mitochondrial DNA). In addition,
there are some special extensions to the file types, for
example “assembly1”, “assembly2”, etc.. These extensions
indicate that different assemblies for the same genome
are available. For example, if assemblies were produced
from different sequencing data like in the case of Drosophila pseudoobscura (assembly1: [32]; assembly2:

unpublished assembly of The Institute for Genomic
Research) or if the same reads were assembled using different methods/software like in the two Bos taurus genome assemblies (assembly1: [33]; assembly2: [34]).
If possible, the version of the assembly as well as the
release date of the data is provided. In general, the versions and release dates are entered manually as given by
the sequencing centres. Otherwise the dates are used at
which the files were saved in the ftp-directories. For
NCBI-assembly data, we store the dates at which the data
has been submitted to NCBI. Please note that the version
numbers do not correlate among sequencing centres and
NCBI. Also, we rank the completeness of the genome
assemblies as a rough estimate of the quality of the data.
If provided by the sequencing centres, the genome coverage of the assembled sequence data is given. For some
assemblies, comments are written that provide further
background information about differences to earlier
assemblies and problems during the assembly process,
for example.

Hammesfahr et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:338
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/338

In addition to this manually collected information, the
GC content, the size in Giga-base-pairs, the number of
fasta-entries, the occurrence of illegal characters in the
sequences (not being g/G, a/A, t/T, c/C, or n/N), and the
N50 of the assemblies are calculated from the fasta files.
The N50 value is a measure of contig length and is calculated by adding up contig lengths starting with the longest contig. The length of that contig, which leads to at
least half of the assembly, is the N50 value. The longer
the contigs are the longer is the contig that overcomes
the half-genome barrier. All contig lengths are counted
and plotted in decreasing length together with the N50
value (Figure 2). These graphs provide additional information to the user to judge the quality of the assembly.
Accession numbers are only stored from NCBI data.
For every genome file the sequencing methods and the
assembly software were collected, if available. The nextgeneration sequencing methods strongly differ in their
usefulness concerning de-novo assemblies, and therefore
this information together with the sequencing coverage
and the library types used for sequencing is absolutely
essential to judge the quality of the data.
The web interface

The web interface always represents the current state of
the database, and all tables and graphs are calculated onthe-fly depending on users requests. The database is
searched using any of the six search modules, or a combination of them. We have added a new module, called
“Genome Files”, for searching the data content of the genome file table and associated tables (Figure 3A). The
results of the search can be browsed in result views. Previously, three result views had been offered, the “Species”,
the “Publications” and the “Projects” result view. The new
“Genome Stats” result view provides a fast overview of
important genome characteristics in direct comparison of
evolutionarily related species and includes chromosome
numbers (if known), genome sizes (as calculated from the
assembly files, given as number of base pairs included in
the chromosome-, supercontigs-, or contigs-file, in descending priority), the GC-contents, and the number of
contigs (Figure 3D). The “Genome Files” result view provides a direct comparison of the data related to the assembly files (Figure 3B). Here, data as provided from NCBI
and the sequencing centres can be downloaded (in accordance with the Bermuda principles and the Ford Lauderdale agreement [35]) and the graphs presenting the size
distribution of the contigs/supercontigs/etc. can be viewed
(Figure 2). The “References” result view provides information about tools and material as provided by the species
sequencing pages, for example, whether certain species
homepages provide BLAST search possibilities or access
to genome browsers (Figure 3C). The “Sequencing Stats”
result view provides many graphs presenting various

Page 4 of 12

aspects of the data (in total or according to the selection
by the user; see also below).
In addition to the modular search, which allows a
powerful and very detailed definition of the search, diArk
provides a “Fast Search” just offering the main search
options: the search for a single species, the selection of
model organisms or given taxa, the selection for sequencing type, completed genome sequencing, and retrieval of
NBCI genome data. This search should be more suited
for beginners.
Stay informed - inform others

To stay up-to-date with newly sequenced genomes without repeatedly accessing diArk we offer an RSS-feed. To
easily inform others, diArk offers options that allow the
user to send content to facebook-, twitter-, and emailaccounts.

Results and Discussion
diArk is the most comprehensive and complete database
for eukaryotic sequencing projects. The number of
sequenced species and projects has more than doubled
since the first version of diArk went online (Figure 4,
[19]). diArk now (March 2011) contains 806 species (415
in 2007; numbers in parenthesis refer to database content
in 2007), of which 613 (209) were subject to whole genome sequencing. Genome sequence data is referenced by
1911 (824) species project pages that are organized into
101 (73) sequencing centres.. The number of sequenced
species is not as strongly increasing as might have been
expected (Figure 4B). The discrepancy between the
expected sequencing throughput and the only slightly
exponential increase of sequenced species is best
explained by the increased use of next-generation
sequencing machines for other projects then de-novo
sequencing of eukaryotes, like for human sequencing in
the course of the 1000 Genomes Project [7] and for
metagenome projects, which are not covered by diArk.
Also, most likely due to next-generation sequencing the
number of incomplete genomes (genomes sequenced
with very low coverage) does not increase as strongly as
before (Figure 4C). The strong increase between 2007
and 2008 is due to the low coverage sequencing of more
than 60 Saccharomyces strains [36]. Although some
sequenced genomes are awaiting analysis and publication
since years, most genome sequences are published
shortly after their generation (Figure 4C). The genomes
of most sequenced species are still published in the highimpact journals Science, those of the Nature group,
PNAS, and the PLoS journals (Figure 4D).
Taxonomic distribution

As in 2007, whole genome sequencing is still strongly
biased towards sequencing of fungi (especially ascomycotes)

and chordates (Figure 5A). However, in 2007 we pointed
out [19] that sequencing of nematodes and plants is far
underrepresented, and this has changed dramatically. The
number of sequenced nematodes and plants increased five
fold in the last years while the number of the other
sequenced species doubled to tripled (Figure 5C). The taxonomic distribution is still better balanced for transcriptome
sequencing (Figure 5B).

increasingly been substituted by the high-throughput methods Roche/454, Illumina Solexa, and SOLiD (Figure 6).
These methods pose several restrains to de-novo species
sequencing like the need for a far higher sequencing coverage (some species like Oreochromis niloticus are sequenced
with a coverage of more than 200 using Illumina) and specific assembly software. Both characteristics have been
included in diArk.

The plot of the genome sizes of completed genome
assemblies against their GC-content shows taxa specific
distributions (Figure 7A). Chordates have the largest
genomes (and also a wide distribution of genome sizes,
Figure 7B) but a narrow distribution of their GC-contents between 37-47%. Apicomplexa have the broadest
distribution with GC-contents ranging from 20-55%,
while Chlorophyta have the highest GC-contents
(52-67%).
diArk in comparison to other databases

Important parameters describing diArk’s content in comparison to that of GOLD, NHGRI, NCBI Genome, and
ISC are listed in Table 1. Because diArk, NHGRI, and ISC
exclusively contain eukaryotes only those data were compared. Most obviously, the total number of species differs
by up to a factor of ten. At diArk, information about 806

species is available (numbers have been obtained on
March 10, 2011) while GOLD provides data for 2153
eukaryotes with 1876 species unique. NHGRI lists 187
(total 248), NCBI Genome 986 (total 1090), and ISC 287
(total 360) unique species, respectively. In total, GOLD
and NCBI Genome list more species than diArk, but this
is mainly due to the different philosophies. GOLD and
NCBI Genome include species for which genome projects
are planned or which are in very early stages (“DNA
received” or “sequencing in progress”) of the project while
diArk only lists projects for which genome assemblies or
considerable amounts of cDNA/EST data are available. In
addition, GOLD, NHGRI, NCBI Genome, and ISC list the
same species multiple times if for example different
sequencing centres sequence different genome libraries
(e.g. three entries are available for sequencing Bos taurus
at GOLD), while diArk combines these data. Different
strains of a species (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae YS2

up-to-dateness of the databases can only be compared at
the level of draft, finished, and published genomes. In
diArk, 613 of 806 species are completely sequenced and
358 are published. In contrast, GOLD assigned 358 of the

In this analysis, all genomes, for which assemblies were announced, are regarded as “sequenced” independently of the various status that the different
databases give (draft, completed, published) and independently of the genome coverage.
The numbers of published genomes have been retrieved as follows: diArk: 1) Using the Search page, select Projects_Search_Module, select “Sequencing type”
Genome, and “Select all references” All Projects; 2) Add Search_Module, select Publications_Search_Module, and select “Select all publications” All Publications.

the fungus Ascosphaera apis [42], while the list of 156
“published genomes” also contains species marked as
“unpublished” (e.g. Arthroderma benhamiae) and those,
for which no information at all is given (e.g. the four Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Bur-0, C24, Ler-1, and Kro-0).
At NCBI Genome, 431 completed and 285 published
eukaryotes were found. Because species projects and publications are entered manually into diArk and the other
databases, the lower numbers by GOLD and NCBI Genome might mainly result from oversight and lack of manpower by the curators. diArk includes all publications
listed in GOLD and NCBI Genome. Furthermore, diArk is
unique in providing additional information for most of the
sequenced genomes like the method(s) used for sequencing, the method(s) used to create the assembly, and
assembly details like the sequencing coverage or the
assembly version. For each assembly, the GC-content and
the assembly size are computed while NCBI Genome and
GOLD provide these data for only a small subset of their
species. Based on these data, diArk presents the most

comprehensive and complete dataset of sequenced eukaryotic species worldwide.

Conclusions
Due to the next-generation sequencing methods genome
data of eukaryotes is increasing rapidly. Technically, all
methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and it is
therefore important to know how the genome of interest
has been sequenced. Also, different assemblies have been
generated for several species using either the same raw
data but different assembly methods [33,34,43], or incorporating data from different sources (see for example the
latest Rattus norvegicus assembly, version 4.1, generated at
the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College
of Medicine). diArk stores all genome assemblies that are
available worldwide and provides several assembly related
metadata: assembly version, assembly release date, completeness of the assembly, GC-content, assembly size,
number of contigs, N50-value (including graphical representation of the contig distribution), accession numbers of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/338

the contigs, genome assembly files, sequencing method,
and assembly method. diArk also provides many statistical
analyses of its content based on the selection of the data.
Currently, diArk contains data associated to 806 species.
For 611 of them, genome assemblies are available, in most
cases in different versions and types (contigs, supercontigs,
chromosomes, etc.) amounting to 2109 genome assembly
files. Of these 611 genome assemblies, 358 have already
been published. Compared to other databases diArk 2.0
provides the most recent and comprehensive eukaryotic
genome assembly data.
