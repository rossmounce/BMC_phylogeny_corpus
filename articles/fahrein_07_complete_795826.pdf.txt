Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial genomes are widely utilized for phylogenetic and population genetic
analyses among animals. In addition to sequence data the mitochondrial gene order and RNA
secondary structure data are used in phylogenetic analyses. Arachnid phylogeny is still highly
debated and there is a lack of sufficient sequence data for many taxa. Ricinulei (hooded tickspiders)
are a morphologically distinct clade of arachnids with uncertain phylogenetic affinities.
Results: The first complete mitochondrial DNA genome of a member of the Ricinulei, Pseudocellus
pearsei (Arachnida: Ricinulei) was sequenced using a PCR-based approach. The mitochondrial
genome is a typical circular duplex DNA molecule with a size of 15,099 bp, showing the complete
set of genes usually present in bilaterian mitochondrial genomes. Five tRNA genes (trnW, trnY, trnN,
trnL(CUN), trnV) show different relative positions compared to other Chelicerata (e.g. Limulus
polyphemus, Ixodes spp.). We propose that two events led to this derived gene order: (1) a tandem
duplication followed by random deletion and (2) an independent translocation of trnN. Most of the
inferred tRNA secondary structures show the common cloverleaf pattern except tRNA-Glu where
the TψC-arm is missing. In phylogenetic analyses (maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony,
Bayesian inference) using concatenated amino acid and nucleotide sequences of protein-coding
genes the basal relationships of arachnid orders remain unresolved.
Conclusion: Phylogenetic analyses (ML, MP, BI) of arachnid mitochondrial genomes fail to resolve
interordinal relationships of Arachnida and remain in a preliminary stage because there is still a lack
of mitogenomic data from important taxa such as Opiliones and Pseudoscorpiones. Gene order
varies considerably within Arachnida – only eight out of 23 species have retained the putative
arthropod ground pattern. Some gene order changes are valuable characters in phylogenetic
analysis of intraordinal relationships, e.g. in Acari.

Background
Due to their bacterial origin [1,2] mitochondria have
retained a circular DNA double-helix, which in animals is
sized between 12–30 kb. This is only a small part of the
original bacterial chromosome, the majority was eliminated or transferred to the nucleus [3]. The mitochondrial
DNA of Bilateria typically contains 37 genes and one ATrich non-coding part, which putatively bears regulatory
elements for transcription and translation and is therefore
referred to as the mitochondrial control region [4]. In general the genes encode 13 protein subunits necessary for
oxidative phosphorylation (atp6+8, cob, cox1–3, nad1–6
and nad4L), 22 transfer RNAs and two rRNAs (rrnS and
rrnL) [5]. Except for the control region, mtDNA possesses
only few non-coding sections between genes, even gene
overlaps are common. E.g., in many species the last seven
nucleotides of atp8 are also the first seven nucleotides of
atp6. A similar overlap is often seen on the boundary
between nad4 and nad4L. As a consequence, rearrangements in mitochondrial genomes most often disrupt
genes and thus are deleterious – a possible reason for the
stability of mitochondrial gene order [4].
Mitochondrial genomes have been proven useful for phylogenetic analyses [4]. Nucleotide or amino acid
sequences as well as rearrangements in mitochondrial
gene order are used as phylogenetic markers [6,7]. Gene
rearrangements are considered to be valuable characters,
because it is very unlikely that closely related taxa exhibit
homoplastic translocations [8]. In addition the secondary
structure of encoded tRNAs [9] and changes in the mitochondrial genetic code [10] have also been used as characters in phylogenetic analysis.
Ricinulei (hooded tickspiders) are a small order of arachnids, comprising 3 genera with 55 described species [1114]. They are predatory animals that live in humid caves
or leaf litter of tropical regions [15-17]. Species of Ricinoides occur in West Africa whereas species of Cryptocellus
and Pseudocellus live in Central and South America [13].
Ricinuleids have body lengths of 3 to 10 mm [18] and
their cuticle is strongly sclerotized and extraordinarily
thick [19]. Several peculiarities characterize ricinuleids – a
moveable hood (cucullus) in front of the prosoma covering the mouthparts, two jointed chelicerae, chelate pedipalps, elongated second legs, a tarsal copulatory organ on
the third pair of legs of adult males, a locking mechanism
between pro- and opisthosoma, which can be unlocked
during mating and egg-laying, a 6-legged larvae, the lack
of distinct eyes, and tracheal respiration [20-25]. According to morphological studies and some combined morphological and molecular analyses, ricinuleids are often
considered to be the sister group of Acari [26-29], together
forming the Acaromorpha. This clade is characterized by a
unique post-embryonic development: a hexapodal larva

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/386

followed by three octapod nymphal instars [28]. A gnathosoma with medially fused palpal coxae is another unique
character of Acaromporpha. However the definition of a
"gnathosoma" varies and its presence in Ricinulei is questioned by some authors [e.g. [30]]. The analysis of Shultz
[27] obtained seven additional "homoplasious synapomorphies" supporting Acaromorpha (= these characters
are not exclusively found in Acari and Ricinulei). Van der
Hammen [31,32] however has questioned the monophyly of Acari and placed Ricinulei within the Acari as the
sister group to Anactinotrichida (Parasitiformes s. str. +
Opilioacariformes) [33]. Dunlop [34] suggested Ricinulei
as sister group to the extinct Trigonotarbida which are collectively the sister of the extant Tetrapulmonata (Araneae,
Uropygi, Amblypygi).
Because available sequence data from nuclear or mitochondrial genes is very limited for Ricinulei, recent molecular studies of arthropod phylogeny seldom included
ricinuleids [e.g. [35]]. With a combined data set (93 morphological characters and 18S + 28S rRNA sequences)
Wheeler & Hayashi [36] placed Ricinulei as sister group to
Acari. In another combined analysis by Giribet et al. (253
morphological characters, 18S and 28S rRNA, [37])
Ricinulei appear as the sister group of Tetrapulmonata
(Araneae + Amblypygi + Uropygi). When fossil taxa were
included, a close relationship between the fossil Trigonotarbida and Ricinulei was recovered and both together
were the sister group to Tetrapulmonata. This phylogenetic hypothesis corresponds with that of Dunlop [34],
but Giribet et al. mentioned the instability of this relationship: In their analysis of only the molecular data set
Ricinulei is early branching within the arachnid tree as the
sister group to all remaining arachnids [37].
In this study, we present the first complete mitochondrial
genome of a member of Ricinulei, the hooded tickspider
Pseudocellus pearsei (Chamberlin & Ivie, 1938). The
sequence data is used to unveil phylogenetic relationships
between Arachnida. Furthermore, the gene order of mitochondrial genomes from all available arachnid species is
compared in order to reconstruct the events leading to
derived genome arrangements and to evaluate the phylogenetic significance of gene translocations within the
Arachnida.

Results and Discussion
Genome organization, gene order and non-coding parts
The generation of overlapping PCR fragments and subsequent sequencing demonstrated that the mitochondrial
genome of P. pearsei is a typical circular DNA molecule
with a length of 15099 bp [GenBank:EU024483]. All 37
genes usually present in bilaterian mitochondrial
genomes have been identified (Fig. 1, Table 1). With the
exception of five translocated tRNAs, gene order is similar

to that of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, which is
considered to represent the putative ground pattern of the
Arthropoda [38,39]. The tRNAs (trnW, trnY, trnN,
trnL(CUN), trnV) changed their position to a new location
between trnM and nad2. In this part of the genome there
are five non-coding regions, which are ranging in size
from 87 to 250 bp. The three largest non-coding regions
are located between rrnS and trnI (250 bp), trnY and trnN
(183 bp) and trnV and nad2 (169 bp). The shorter ones
are situated between trnI and trnQ (100 bp) and trnM and
trnW (87 bp). The longest non-coding region (250 bp) is
flanked by rrnSI and trn, and based on its similarity to
other arthropods [5,40,41] can be identified as the putative mitochondrial control region. Part of this region is
capable of folding into a hairpin-like formation (Fig. 2)
with a loop consisting of 10 nucleotides and a stem composed of 21 paired nucleotides (five mismatches). Fur-

thermore conserved motifs occur in the flanking
sequences around the stem-loop structure: a TATA motif
appears in the 5'-flanking sequence whereas the motif
GA(A)T is found in the 3'-flanking sequence (Fig. 2). Both
motifs are also present in flanking sequences of other
arthropods, e.g. in metastriate ticks [42], crustaceans [43],
and insects and are presumed to have functional significance in transcription and/or replication [44]. The other
larger non-coding regions do not bear similar hairpin-like
structures.
Besides the above mentioned regions only smaller noncoding regions of 2–23 bp are found in the mitochondrial
genome. Gene overlaps occur between cox1 and cox2 (1
bp), nad4 and nad4L (4 bp), atp6 and atp8 (7 bp), and in
four cases tRNA-genes are overlapping each other (Fig. 1,

Table 1).
Protein-coding genes and nucleotide composition
All of the 13 identified protein-coding genes begin with
one of the common start codons for mtDNA ATG, ATA or
ATT (Table 1). Out of these 13 protein-coding genes, six
show incomplete stop codons (cox2, cob and nad1, 3, 4, 5).
In cox2 the stop codon is truncated and the gene terminates with TA, in the other five protein-coding genes only
a single thymine serves as partial stop codon. Similar
structural events have also been described for the mtDNA
of other species where post-transcriptional polyadenylation completes a T or TA partial stop codon into a functional one [45].

The CG-skew (= (%C-%G)/(%C+%G)) of mitochondrial
genes is a good indicator of the strand specific nucleotide
frequency bias [46,47]. In P. pearsei the CG-skew is positive in all (+)strand encoded genes and negative in all ()strand encoded genes (Table 1). We defined the
(+)strand as the strand bearing the majority of coding
sequence. The strand specific bias found in P. pearsei

occurs in most other arthropods, while a reversal of that
bias has been reported for only a few species [43,46,4850]. Table 2 shows the CG-skews of third codon positions
of cox1 for all chelicerates and outgroup taxa included in
our phylogenetic analyses. We chose cox1 because this
gene is found on (+)strand in all species examined. A
reversal of CG-skew is seen in the two scorpions, in three
Araneae (but not in Heptathela) and in the parasitiform
mite Varroa.
Secondary structure of transfer RNAs
The mitochondrial genome of P. pearsei bears all of the 22
tRNAs commonly found in metazoan mtDNA (Fig. 1,
Table 1). Except for tRNA-Glu, all tRNAs possess the typical cloverleaf secondary structure, though the TψC stem is
shortened in several tRNAs (Fig. 3). The TψC-arm of
tRNA-Glu is entirely absent. It is shortened to a single pair
of nucleotides in tRNA-Met and tRNA-Phe and it is composed of just two paired bases in tRNA-Gly, tRNA-His,
tRNA-Ile, tRNA-Leu (CUN), tRNA-Ser (AGN) and tRNAThr.
Phylogenetic analysis
We performed phylogenetic analyses with two different
data sets: concatenated amino acid and concatenated
nucleotide sequences (without third codon positions)
from all protein-coding genes. Topologies with best likelihood scores from maximum likelihood (ML) analysis are
shown (Fig. 4). Topologies of the 50% majority rule consensus trees from ML bootstrapping and Bayesian Infer-

Bold numbers indicate higher values in comparison of G and C proportions. Only those taxa (24 chelicerate and 3 outgroup taxa) included in our
phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4) are listed.

ence (BI) differ only slightly from the best topologies of
ML analysis: BI with the amino acid dataset resulted in a
basal split between Oltacola and the remainder of chelicerates including Limulus, but that node is not supported by
bootstrapping or BI; in ML bootstrapping with the nucleotide dataset there was no resolution between Ricinulei,
Scorpiones, Araneae and Acari (ML bootstrap <50%). In
all performed analyses, good support was found for
monophyly of Scorpiones, Opisthothelae (= all Araneae
except Mesothelae, here represented by Heptathela), Ixodes, Leptotrombidium, Ornithodorinae (Carios + Ornithodoros), Ixodidae (Ixodes + Amblyomma + Haemaphysalis +
Rhipicephalus), Metastriata (Amblyomma + Haemaphysalis +
Rhipicephalus), and Dermanyssina (Metaseiulus + Varroa).
Monophyly of Acari-Parasitiformes was also well supported by most analyses, except for the maximum parsimony (MP) bootstrapping (56%). Monophyly of Acari
was recovered in the best topology of the nucleotide ML
analysis and moderately supported by ML bootstrapping
(80%), but not by BI or MP bootstrapping. Acari and
Ricinulei form sister groups in the best ML topology in the
analysis of the nucleotide alignment, but this clade found
support only by BI (0.98), not by ML or MP bootstrap-

ping. In contrast analyses of the amino acid dataset
resulted in paraphyletic Acari, as Acariformes (Leptotrombidium) form a clade with Ricinulei, and both together
form the sister group to Araneae. Both clades are well supported only by BI (Acariformes + Ricinulei: 1.0; Acariformes + Ricinulei + Araneae: 0.99).
Arachnid monophyly is only supported by ML analysis
with the amino acid dataset (bootstrap: 74%). In all other
analyses the three basal chelicerate branches – Limulus
(Xiphosura), Oltacola (Solifugae), and the remainder of
arachnids – are not well resolved. Monophyly of Arachnida excl. Solifugae (in this case Scorpiones + Araneae +
Acari + Ricinulei) is well supported in ML and BI analyses
of the amino acid alignment and weakly supported by ML
analysis of the nucleotide alignment.
The classical, morphology based view of the phylogenetic
position of Ricinulei is as the sister group to Acari [26-29].
Because our analysis does not resolve the basal relationships of arachnid orders well, it is not in conflict with
actual morphology based analyses of arachnid interrelationships [27,36]. A sister group relation between Acari

Phylogenetic trees of chelicerate relationships, inferred from nucleotide (upper) and amino acid (lower) datasets. All protein
coding gene sequences were aligned and concatenated; ambiguously aligned regions were omitted by Gblocks. Trees were
rooted with outgroup taxa (Lithobius, Daphnia, Penaeus). Topologies and branch lengths were taken from the best scoring trees
of the maximum likelihood (ML) analyses. Numbers behind the branching points are percentages from ML bootstrapping (left),
Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP, middle) and maximum parsimony bootstrap percentages (MP, right). Stars indicate that
values are 100 (ML), 1.0 (BI) and 100 (MP). See Table 2 for accession numbers.

and Ricinulei is neither well supported, nor refuted by our
results.
The phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial genome data
in chelicerate phylogenetics suffers from several problems. First, the currently incomplete taxon sampling
(complete lack of data for Opiliones, Pseudoscorpiones,
Palpigradi, Uropygi, and Amblypygi) highlights the preliminary nature of this analysis. While the problem of
taxon sampling will be overcome in the near future, other
problems lie in the nature of the sequence data itself. Several taxa show a reversed strand bias of nucleotide composition (Table 2), which complicates phylogenetic analyses
[46,49]. This may strongly affect the phylogenetic position of Scorpiones in analyses with mitochondrial datsets
[51]. Another problem is the heterogeneous substitution
rate among arachnids. Our analysis demonstrates great
variability in branch lengths, with very long branches for
some Acari species (Leptotrombidium, Varroa, Metaseiulus),
and very short branches, e.g. from Limulus and Oltacola.
Mitochondrial gene order variation in Arachnida
Apart from five translocated tRNA-genes, the mitochondrial gene order of P. pearsei does not differ from the putative arthropod ground pattern (Figs. 5, 6). A minimum of
two events is required to lead to the derived gene order of
P. pearsei: a tandem duplication/random deletion event
and a single tRNA gene transposition. Tandem duplication and random loss of genes is widely accepted as a
mode of genome shuffling in mitochondria [52]. In the
present case a segment ranging from trnL to trnY (ground
pattern) can be inferred to be involved in such a duplication event. Subsequently the first copy may have lost trnL,
trnV, nad1, and trnC, the second copy may have lost rrnL,
rrnS, trnI, trnQ, trnM, trnW, and trnY, as well as the control
region. Besides the control region (between rrnS and trnI)
there are four larger non-coding regions (87–183 bp)
present between trnI and nad2 (Fig. 1, Table 1). This is a
further hint towards a tandem duplication random deletion event, although there are no apparent sequence
homologies to any of the lost genes. In addition, trnN is
located in a novel relative position which is best explained
by the transposition of this single gene, the second
inferred event.

The comparison of mitochondrial gene order from Arachnida reveals a great variation (Fig. 5). Only eight out of 23
species have retained the arthropod ground pattern as represented by Limulus [38]. We present a parsimonious scenario of gene order changes and mapped these events on
a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 6). Three different modes leading
to a change in gene order were assumed: (1) tandem
duplication random deletion events [52], (2) inversions,
and (3) transposition of single tRNAs. Although the latter
mode is currently not well explained by a molecular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/386

model, we have assumed that single tRNA transpositions
have occurred in all cases in which tandem duplication
and random deletion seems to be an implausible explanation, e.g. when only one tRNA gene found a new position
distant from its original position, or on the other strand.
The tandem duplication random deletion model was proposed when more than one gene was involved and/or
non-coding sequence was found between the genes
involved. The tree we have used for mapping the events is
the best scoring topology from the ML analysis of the
amino acid alignment (Fig. 4, lower tree), because this
analysis provided bootstrap support for most of the
branches. However, regarding gene order changes there is
also no character conflict (= homoplastic characters/
events) with the other topology obtained from the nucleotide alignment.
None of the gene order characters is capable to resolve
interordinal relationships of the taxa studied (Fig. 6). The
arthropod ground pattern [38] is retained in some parasitiform mites (e.g. Ixodes [42], Carios and Ornithodoros
[53]) (Figs. 5, 6), and in the spider Heptathela (Araneae:
Mesothelae [41]). The mitochondrial genomes of Araneae-Opisthothelae (Ornithoctonus [41], Nephila, [GenBank:NC_008063], Habronattus [54]) share seven
translocated tRNA genes. A subsequent translocation of
trnI is found in Nephila and Habronattus [54]. The camel
spider Oltacola gomezi (Solifugae) has a mitochondrial
genome arrangement almost unaltered from the arthropod ground pattern [GenBank:EU024482], only trnP was
translocated to a new relative position. The scorpions Centruroides [55] and Mesobuthus [56] share a translocated and
inverted trnQ and both lack trnD.
Several independently derived mitochondrial gene orders
are found in Acari. Metastriata (Parasitiformes: Ixodidae)
show a derived gene order probably caused by a tandem
duplication random deletion event and an additional
tRNA translocation (Rhipicephalus [42], Haemaphysalis
[53], Amblyomma, [GenBank:NC_005963]). The honeybee mite Varroa shows translocation of six tRNA genes
[50]. In addition the reversed arrangement of rrnS and the
control region in this species is hypothesized to be the
result of a tandem duplication and random deletion
event.
Metaseiulus (Parasitiformes: Mesostimata) possesses the
most derived mitochondrial gene order among arachnids,
probably due to multiple rearrangements [57]. This
genome is the largest (25 kb) within the Chelicerata due
to the presence of duplicate and triplicate regions. The
duplicate region contains 18 genes plus a copy of the control region and partial trnL(UUR) sequence while the triplicate region comprises only the control region sequence
and partial trnL(UUR) sequence (Fig. 5). The mitochon-

Changes5in gene order in mitochondrial genomes of Arachnida compared to the putative ancestral arthropod gene order
Figure
Changes in gene order in mitochondrial genomes of Arachnida compared to the putative ancestral arthropod gene order.
Transfer RNA genes are labelled according to the one letter amino acid code. Genes marked white show the same relative
position as in the arthropod ground pattern; genes marked orange have relative positions differing from the arthropod ground
pattern; the gene marked black indicates a duplicated rrnL gene in Leptotrombidium pallidum. Horizontal lines above genes illustrate adjacent genes which were probably translocated together; dotted lines indicate regions where tandem duplication and
random deletion events may have occurred; connected arrows show adjacent genes which have switched their position, making it difficult to assess which gene was translocated. Braces accentuate the duplicated regions in the mitochondrial genome of
Metaseiulus occidentalis. lnr: large non-coding region, putative mitochondrial control region; other non-coding regions (> 50 bp)
are illustrated by gaps between genes. Numbers refer to rearrangement events, compare Fig. 6. For GenBank accession numbers see Table 2.

drial genome of Metaseiulus is also remarkable for the
absence of nad3 and nad6, because no other chelicerate is
known to have lost any of the protein coding genes. Due
to the magnitude of these changes, it is difficult to reliably
reconstruct the events leading to the gene order found in
Metaseiulus which is unique amongst arachnids.
The same is true for the genus Leptotrombidium (Acariformes) [58,59]. The three species share a common,
derived arrangement with secondary rearrangements in L.

pallidum. The secondarily derived gene order of L. pallidum
(translocation of trnQ, duplication of rrnL and the presence of four large noncoding regions) is considered to
have evolved by a combination of tandem duplication
with random deletion plus intergenomic recombination
between several genes with subsequent gene conversion
[59].
It is apparent that the two taxa showing the most complicated genome rearrangement history (Leptotrombidium

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:386

and Metaseiulus) exhibit also the longest branches (= highest substitution rates) in phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4, 6).
Reversals of strand bias in nucleotide frequency
A reversal of nucleotide strand bias was detected in six species (Table 2), most probably due to three independent
events: (1) in the Varroa mite [50], (2) in Scorpiones and
(3) in Araneae-Opisthothelae (Ornithoctonus [41],
Nephila, [GenBank:NC_008063], Habronattus [54]). These
changes are also mapped on the tree in Fig. 6 (characters
2, 4, and 20). The comparatively low substitution rate in
the mitochondrial genome of Heptathela (Araneae: Mesothelae; Fig. 6) argues against a re-reversal of nucleotide
bias within Araneae and suggests that the reversal is in fact
a synapomorphy of the Opisthothelae (Fig. 6).

Conclusion
The first complete mitochondrial sequence of a hooded
tickspider (P. pearsei, Ricinulei, Arachnida) reveals a typical circular duplex DNA molecule with a compact gene
organisation as found in other bilaterians. In comparison
to the putative arthropod ground pattern we observed a
derived gene order with five tRNA genes found in different
relative positions compared to the gene order of Limulus.
Probably two events led to the derived gene order of Pseudocellus: (1) a duplication and random deletion event may
be responsible for the translocation of four of these tRNA
genes and (2) an additional translocation of the trnN. The
putative mitochondrial control region is situated in the
same position as in other arthropod mitochondrial
genomes. Part of the putative control region can be folded
into a characteristic stem-loop structure with conserved
flanking sequences as found in other arthropods. All
tRNAs, except tRNA-Glu, can be folded into a typical cloverleaf secondary structure.
Aligments of nucleotide and amino acid sequences from
mitochondrial protein-coding genes were used in a phylogenetic analysis of arachnid relationships. In the best
scoring topologies from ML analyses, Ricinulei appear as
sister taxon to Acari (nucleotide alignment) or Acariformes (amino acid alignment), but in both cases without
sufficient support from bootstrapping or Bayesian inference. Within the Acari, monophyly of Parasitiformes is
well supported, while Acariformes are represented by only
a single genus (Leptotrombidium). Monophyly of Acari was
only recovered in the analysis of the nucleotide alignment
and found strong support by BI and only weak support by
ML/MP bootstrapping.
Because of highly divergent substitution rates amongst
arachnid species, phylogenetic analyses may be generally
biased due to long-branch attraction. Another complicating factor is the reversal of nucleotide bias, which has
occurred independently in the arachnid clades Scorpi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/386

ones, Acari (Varroa) and Araneae (Opisthothelae). Due to
the lack of support for interordinal relations within Arachnida, the phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial genome
data reveals no strong conflict with recent morphological
analyses.
Investigation of mitochondrial gene rearrangements
across the range of taxa for which complete mitochondrial
genomes are available on GenBank, reveals high variability in gene order within arachnids. Among arachnids, 15
of the 23 species investigated have derived features in gene
order. When mapped onto the tree, the hypotheses of
events leading to gene order changes are not in conflict
with our phylogenetic analyses of sequence data. None of
the hypothesized events is useful as a phylogenetic character to resolve interordinal relationships within arachnids,
but some of these characters are promising in analyses of
intraordinal relationships. Especially in Acari the comparison of mitochondrial genomes from a larger taxon sampling would be promising for the detection of gene order
changes, which will be valuable in a phylogenetic analysis. Altogether, further mitogenomic data of a broader
taxon sampling are necessary, especially from Opiliones,
Pseudoscorpiones, Palpigradi, Uropygi and Amblypygi.

Methods
Samples and DNA extraction
P. pearsei specimens were collected by Gerd Alberti in the
Gruta Sabac-Ha, near Merida, province of Yucatán, México (20°10'18"N, 89°16'03"W). DNA extraction was
done with two legs obtained from a freshly killed animal.
We used "DNeasy blood and tissue kit" (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturers protocol,
except for reduction of the elution volume to 50 µl.
PCR and sequencing
Initial PCRs were done with a published primer set
designed for crustacean mitochondrial genomes [60]. All
PCRs were performed on an Eppendorf Mastercycler and
Mastercycler gradient. The Eppendorf 5-prime-Taq kit
(Eppendorf, Germany) was used in 50 µl volumes (5 µl
buffer; 1 µl dNTP mix, 10 µM; 0.25 µl Taq polymerase; 1
µl template DNA, 40,75 µl water, 1 µl primer mix, 10 µM
each). PCR conditions were: initial denaturation (94°C, 1
min), 40 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 30 sec), annealing
(50°C, 30 sec), and elongation (68°C, 1 min), followed
by a final elongation step (68°C, 1 min). Successful PCR
amplification was obtained with six primer pairs: S8(cox1,
about 650 bp), S10(cox1, about 1050 bp), S15(cox2-atp6,
about 830 bp), S20(cox3-trnF, about 950 bp), S37(nd4lcob, about 1600 bp), and S46(rrnL-rrnS, about 1000 bp),
see [60] for primer sequences. PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels. Before sequencing PCR products
were purified using the Bluematrix DNA purification kit
(EURx, Gdansk, Poland). Except for S8 and S10 there was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/386

no overlap between these initial sequences. Species specific primer pairs were designed to bridge the five gaps
between these initial sequences (see Table 3 for primer
information). Long PCRs were performed with Takara LA
Taq kit (Takara) in 50 µl volumes (5 µl Buffer, Mg+; 8 µl
dNTP mix, 2.5 µM; 1 µl DNA; 1 µl primer mix, 10 µM
each; 0.5 µl Takara LA Taq; 32 µl water). PCR conditions
were: initial denaturation (94°C, 1 min), 40 cycles of
denaturation (94°C, 30 sec), annealing (primer specific
temperature see Table 3, 1 min), and elongation (68°C, 3
min), followed by a final elongation step (68°C, 2 min).
Long PCR products were sequenced by primer walking.
All sequencing was performed on a CEQ 8000 capillary
sequencer (Beckmann-Coulter) using CEQ DCTS kits
(Beckmann-Coulter) with 10 µl reaction volumes (4 µl
DCTS master mix, 1 µl primer, 10 µM, 1–5 µl DNA, 0–4
µl water). Sequencing reaction was done with 30 cycles of
denaturation (94°C, 30 sec), annealing (primer specific
temperature, 30 sec) and elongation (60°C, 2 min).
Sequence assemblage and annotation
Primary sequence analysis was performed with the CEQ
software (quality check). Sequence assemblage was done
with Bioedit 7.0.1 [61]. Protein-coding and ribosomal
RNA genes and gene boundaries were identified by BLAST
search and in comparison with alignments from other
chelicerate species. Genomic position and secondary
structure from 20 out of 22 transfer RNAs were identified
by tRNA-scan SE [62], the remaining two by eye inspection of the regions under suspect. Sequence data was
deposited at NCBI database [GenBank:EU024483].
Phylogenetic analysis
Alignments from all protein-coding genes were used in
phylogenetic analysis. Alignments of amino acid
sequences and nucleotide sequences were performed with
ClustalW [63], as implemented in Bioedit 7.0.1 [61].
Nucleotide sequences were translated to amino acid
sequence prior to the multiple alignment and translated
back afterwards (making use of the "toggle" function of

Bioedit). Sequence data was obtained from 24 chelicerate
species and three outgroup taxa (for a list of taxa with
GenBank accession numbers see Table 2). Ambiguously
aligned regions were omitted using Gblocks ver. 0.91b
[64], using default settings, except for changing "allowed
gap positions" to "with half". The final amino acid alignment consisted of 2786 amino acids. For the nucleotide
dataset the "codons" option was used, so that only complete codons (not single nucleotides) were omitted from
the alignment by Gblocks. A saturation analysis [65] was
performed with DAMBE 4.2.13 [66] using subsets of the
nucleotide dataset representing first, second and third
codon positions. Due to significant saturation, third
codon positions were omitted from the final nucleotide
alignment (6490 nucleotides).
Maximum parsimony (MP) analysis was performed with
PAUP* ver. 4.0b10 [67], 1,000 bootstrap replicates were
performed, each with 10 replicates with random addition
of taxa. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was done
with Treefinder [68]. Model selection was done with ProtTest ver. 1.3 [69]. According to the Akaike information criterion, the mtArt+G+I model was optimal for ML analysis.
The tree with the best likelihood value was chosen out of
10 independent analyses with random taxon order. Bootstrapping was performed with 100 pseudoreplicates.
Bayesian inference (BI) with MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 [70] was
done with the model mtRev+G+I, as the mtArt model is
not implemented in the current version of MrBayes. Eight
chains ran for 1,000,000 generations, while tree sampling
was done every 1,000 generations; we examined likelihood values of the sampled trees and decided to omit the
first 100 trees as burn-in, while the remaining 900 were
used to calculate Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP).
