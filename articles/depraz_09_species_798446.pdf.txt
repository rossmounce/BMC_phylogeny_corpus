Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial DNA sequencing increasingly results in the recognition of genetically
divergent, but morphologically cryptic lineages. Species delimitation approaches that rely on
multiple lines of evidence in areas of co-occurrence are particularly powerful to infer their specific
status. We investigated the species boundaries of two cryptic lineages of the land snail genus
Trochulus in a contact zone, using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA marker as well as shell
morphometrics.
Results: Both mitochondrial lineages have a distinct geographical distribution with a small zone of
co-occurrence. In the same area, we detected two nuclear genotype clusters, each being highly
significantly associated to one mitochondrial lineage. This association however had exceptions: a
small number of individuals in the contact zone showed intermediate genotypes (4%) or
cytonuclear disequilibrium (12%). Both mitochondrial lineage and nuclear cluster were statistically
significant predictors for the shell shape indicating morphological divergence. Nevertheless, the
lineage morphospaces largely overlapped (low posterior classification success rate of 69% and 78%,
respectively): the two lineages are truly cryptic.
Conclusion: The integrative approach using multiple lines of evidence supported the hypothesis
that the investigated Trochulus lineages are reproductively isolated species. In the small contact area,
however, the lineages hybridise to a limited extent. This detection of a hybrid zone adds an instance
to the rare reported cases of hybridisation in land snails.

Background
Mitochondrial gene sequences have become a powerful
tool to identify evolutionary lineages or species in animals
[[1,2], e.g. [3-5]]. Their application has often lead to the
detection of divergent lineages within otherwise morphologically uniform recognised species [6]. Without any
additional evidence from an explicit species delimitation
approach, it is however rarely clear whether these lineages
constitute reproductively isolated and/or ecologically dif-

ferent species or whether they are fully compatible,
belonging to a single species [7,8]. The study of populations within a contact zone is thus a useful approach to
assess the species status of otherwise cryptic lineages.
Indeed, these areas bring genetically distinct individuals
in contact and offer them the possibility to interbreed: the
resulting genetic signature observed in the contact zone
provides information on the degree of reproductive isolation between the lineages.

Here, we evaluated the species status of two lineages of the
Trochulus sericeus/hispidus complex (Gastropoda: Pulmonata: Helicoidea: Hygromiidae) in an area of co-occurrence. These divergent mitochondrial lineages had been
previously identified in a phylogenetic study of character
evolution on the origin and the function of the hair-like
shell structures in the genus [9]. While some species (i.e.
T. villosus, T. montanus or T. caelatus) clearly matched a distinct genetic lineages each, other morphologically
described species (i.e. T. plebeius, T. striolatus, T. sericeus
and T. hispidus) appeared to consist of several divergent
mitochondrial lineages (9 to 11% sequence divergence);
the taxonomic status of the latter remained undefined due
to the lack of other (e.g. morphological) criteria of discrimination [9].
This came as no surprise as the genus Trochulus has triggered a remarkably long taxonomic debate on species
numbers and limits [10]. The large morphological variability within Trochulus and the multitude of transition
forms led some authors to describe dozens of species
[Locard in [11]] while others, based on the same shell
morphological and genital anatomical evidence, recognised only a single one [11,12]. Species delimitation
based on morphological features in land snails is often
critical: shells have been shown in several cases to be
strongly influenced by environmental conditions during
growth [13,14], whereas genital anatomic criteria, whose
dependence on the environment has not yet been
assessed, require minute dissections and often rely, such
as for Trochulus spp., on subtle differences in size ratios
[15].
Yet, a large mitochondrial sequence divergence per se does
not necessarily warrant species status in land snails. Unusually high levels of genetic diversity within populations
have been shown for some gastropod taxa [16-18] while
other studies have demonstrated the presence of "good"
cryptic species [[19], e.g. [20,21]]. We used both mitochondrial and nuclear markers along with shell morphometrics to answer the following questions: (1) Is the
mitochondrial divergence between the lineages reflected
in the nuclear gene-pool, i.e. what is the degree of their
reproductive isolation? (2) Are there consistent differences in shell shape among the identified lineages or are
they truly cryptic? (3) Does the combination of these three
datasets provide sufficient evidence to support the
hypothesis of two distinct species?

identified in a previous study [9]. Neighbour-joining and
Maximum parsimony methods revealed the same clusters
(data not shown). Genetic divergence within lineage
ranged between 0.3 and 0.4% and between lineages
between 5.5 – 16.7%. Lineages 1 and 2 included most of
the observed haplotypes (13 and 23 haplotypes respectively) and accounted for 89% of all individuals (39% and
50% of the total sample respectively) (Table 1). Lineages
1 and 2 diverged by 7.3%. Finally, the mitochondrial tree
pointed out a series of lineages (i.e. [3-7]), largely distributed among recognised Trochulus species: these were individuals sampled as juveniles and misidentified (Figure 1);
they were ruled out from the subsequent analyses.
Lineage 1 was predominant in the northern lower parts of
the Sarine valley, while lineage 2 was preferentially found
upstream in the South. There were, however, several sites
in the middle of the valley where both lineages cooccurred (Figure 2).
In addition, as evidenced by the mismatch distributions,
lineage 1 contained a signal of spatial expansion, while
lineage 2 did not (Figure 3).
Spatial nuclear clustering and cyto-nuclear association
The spatial clustering approach with K = 2 of microsatellite multilocus genotype data from 192 individuals
revealed a clear pattern: one hundred and two individuals
were attributed to one cluster (α), 83 to another (β); all
with posterior probabilities larger than 0.9. Seven individuals had genotypes that appeared to be of mixed origin
(i.e. with posterior probabilities for each cluster between
0.1 and 0.9). These results were identical for the best 15%
of runs. Geographically, cluster α was largely distributed
in the north, downstream of the Sarine valley, while cluster β was preferentially found upstream in the south (Figure 2). The contribution of alleles to these clusters were
visualised with a factorial correspondence analysis (see
additional file 1).

Results

There was a highly significant association of nuclear clusters with mitochondrial haplotype lineages (N = 192, p <
0.001 exact rxc contingency test, Table 2); lineage 1 being
associated with nuclear cluster α and lineage 2 with cluster
β. This association remained significant when only mixed
populations were considered (p < 0.001). However, the
association was not categorical: 22 individuals with lineage 2 had cluster α and one individual vice versa. Finally,
all seven individuals classified as nuclear intermediates
had a lineage 2 mitochondrial genome (Table 2).

Distribution of mitochondrial lineages
Two hundred and twenty four individuals were sequenced
for a 16SrRNA gene fragment. The mitochondrial haplotype tree clustered the sampled individuals into 47 haplotypes (GQ253517–GQ253561) grouped into seven
lineages (lineages 1 to 7; Figure 1), all of which were also

The sampling sites with exclusively 1/α and 2/β individuals were situated in the North and South margins of the
sampling area, respectively (Figure 2). The sampling sites
where both mitochondrial lineages and/or nuclear cluster
co-occurred were all in the middle section of the valley

were close to either the rivers or the reservoir lake
(Figure 2).
Shell variation
A principle component analysis showed no tendency to
group the individuals either according to mitochondrial
lineage or nuclear cluster, and this along any of the significant axes (data not shown). Discriminant analyses, however, with grouping according to nuclear cluster or
mitochondrial lineage were both significant (Figure 4).
Grouping according to nuclear cluster differentiated the
snails on variables such as HFW (standardised coefficient
= 0.79), HSP (0.71), DOM (0.69) and AES (0.6) which
tended to be slightly larger on cluster α individuals. This
resulted in 78% correct posterior classifications. Grouping
after mitochondrial lineage was less effective with only
69% of the cases correctly classified; the same variables
were important, except DOM.

gene-pools (Table 2) and, hence, a specific distinctness of
these evolutionary lineages, satisfying the criteria of most
species concepts, in particular the unified species concept
[23]. Such a picture might have been also produced by
very recent contact. But even considering the low dispersal
capacity of land snails, the lineages could have come in
contact at any time in the Holocene after the retreat of the
glacier from the valley, given the small geographic scale of
the study. The chances are thus minimal that the contact
zone formed only within the last few generations (Figure
3). We expect therefore that free interbreeding of the lineages for many generations would have resulted in completely intermixed genotypes in the contact zone and
produced a deeper zone of reciprocal introgression. The
rarity of such mixed genotypes and the spatially restricted
area of introgression argue for some degree of reproductive isolation. This potential reproductive isolation does
not allow equating the sampling sites with freely reproducing populations, which precludes their model dependent population genetic analysis.

Discussion
Mitochondrial lineages constitute good species
The use of a short 267 bp 16SrRNA gene fragment for
identification purposes has shown the power of this
approach [22]. A couple of individuals morphologically
similar to the Trochulus complex or juveniles from other
species were detected due to their genetic divergence.
While it is possible that these lineages interact among
each other, these individuals were excluded from further
analysis to ensure a rigorous statistical analysis.

The highly significant association between mitochondrial
lineage (1 or 2) and nuclear cluster (α or β) in the contact
zone of these parapatric lineages argues for two distinct

If one applies the fastest mitochondrial divergence rate of
5% per million years ever suggested for land snails [16], a
sequence divergence of more than 7% between the lineages suggests that they split at least 1.4 million years ago.
Slower, more realistic rates would entail an even older
divergence. This implies that the lineages were separated
for at least most of the Pleistocene, giving them ample
time to diverge and speciate.
This distinctness is also reflected in the shell morphology.
Both mitochondrial and nuclear data appeared to be suitable statistical predictors of different morphological
groups. The nuclear cluster performs slightly better, which

statistics are given.
we attribute to the few cases of mitochondrial introgression of lineage l2 haplotypes into nuclear background α,
blurring the picture (see below). One could attribute the
overlap between the two morphogroups to extensive
mutual introgression at the relevant genes. This is however unlikely: even the populations furthest apart from
each other (and thus least prone to extensive exchange)
have overlapping morphologies (data not shown). Moreover, the possibility to statistically tell the two species
apart and the approximately normally distributed factor
scores (Figure 4B, 4C) suggest that at least some of the
quantitative shell shape differences are governed by multiple divergently evolved genes [24]. The observed morphological shell differences are thus rather due to drift
than different biological function.
However, a classification success rate of only 78% and
69% respectively, means that it is impossible to reliably
differentiate the two species' shells based on extensive
morphometric measurements (Figure 4), let alone to distinguish them visually. In practice, this means that the two
species will remain cryptic unless molecular markers are
used for identification. While the lineage 1/cluster α is yet
unnamed, 2/β individuals may be attributed to Trochulus
piccardi [25]. Indeed, the lineage 1 individuals, in addition

of grouping with the type individual of that species on the
mitochondrial phylogeny, have been sampled within the
geographical range described for this species [25].
The distribution of T. piccardi that appears to be restricted
to the upper Sarine valley and surrounding regions suggests in situ evolution [25]. Such a hypothesis requires the
continuous presence of suitable habitat throughout the
Pleistocene glaciation cycles, probably scattered over
steep south-facing slopes. However, such refugia need not
to be large for such poor dispersing, small animals: it has
been shown that they can survive on very small areas, provided they are surrounded by other population patches
[26].
The current distribution of the other Trochulus species (i.e.
the lineage 1) lacks preciseness as this study's sampling
scheme did not reach its northern limit. It can nevertheless be argued that it probably evolved in its own, not yet
located Pleistocene refugium and got into secondary contact with T. piccardi in the course of a Holocene range
expansion (Figure 3).
A pattern of speciation in isolation may turn out to be
quite common within Trochulus: several species with very
restricted ranges in mountainous regions have been
described such as T. graminicola (FALKNER 1973), T. montanus (STUDER 1820), T. caelatus (STUDER 1820) or T.
biconicus (EDER 1917). Generally speaking, it has been
repeatedly put forward that alpine areas could provide
pocket refugia for gastropods [27-30]. Even though a
Pleistocene survival of land snails in alpine or other
Northern refugia has not been traditionally considered
[31], accumulating evidence suggests their importance for
gastropod biodiversity [32-35].

Mitochondrial introgression in a hybrid zone
A few individuals with apparently admixed nuclear genotypes as well as some with the "wrong" mitochondrial
genome could be detected (Figure 2). These intermediates
suggest that, despite the relatively large evolutionary distance among the species, occasional hybridisation can
take place (Figure 1, [9]).

Interestingly, the introgression of mitochondrial genomes
seems to be directional: only a single lineage 1/cluster β
individual was found which is little as compared to the 22
lineage l2/cluster α individuals; besides the admixed
nuclear genotypes all carried the lineage 2. Even though
the sample sizes of the admixed populations were too
small to perform formal tests on cytonuclear disequilibrium [36], the apparent directional introgression of line-

age 2 mitochondrial haplotypes into cluster α nuclear
background begets the question whether this is due to
intrinsic reproductive barriers and/or unidirectional geneflow downstream the Sarine river. Differential mating
preference, the usual explanation for the observed pattern,
is unlikely in the present case: since these snails are reciprocally mating hermaphrodites (i.e. they both receive the
sperm of the other individual to fertilise their eggs), the
nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of both individuals
are expected to be transmitted. Given the low dispersal
capacity of land snails and their more or less isolated populations [37-40], it is anyway likely that we are dealing
here with a mixed hybrid zone [36], where isolated hybrid
populations may take different evolutionary trajectories.
A hint in this direction was the somewhat peripheral sampling site Motelon (Figure 2), where nuclear cluster α is

associated to lineage 2, contrary to all other sites: it may
be due to one or a few introgression events, followed by
drift in isolation.

Conclusion
The application of several lines of evidence allowed rejecting the hypothesis of a single species consisting of divergent lineages, despite occasional hybridisation in a
contact zone. The detection of a putative hybrid zone in
Trochulus adds to the surprisingly low number of cases of
hybridisation in land snails [41-44], despite the ubiquitous presence of hybridisation in animal taxa [45]. This
system – two cryptic hermaphrodite species with a small
hybrid zone – seems excellently suited for further investigations on the evolutionary forces shaping species diversity in mountainous habitat rich regions, with a focus on
the evolutionary consequences of hybridisation.

co-occurrence of mitochondrial lineage F and Trochulus
nov. spec. as defined in Pfenninger et al. 2005 (subsequently described as T. piccardi PFENNINGER & PFENNINGER[25] were sampled in the Swiss Western Prealps, along
the Sarine valley (Figure 2). As the attribution of Trochulus
individuals to a certain species based on shell morphology alone is difficult, all apparently adult Trochulus
sericeus/hispidus individuals found were sampled. The collected snails were brought alive to the lab and frozen at 80°C. The individuals were then pulled out of their shell
and stored at -80°C for genetic analyses; the shell was kept
for morphometric measurements.
Sequencing and mitochondrial analyses
Total DNA was extracted from a piece of foot muscle following a modified salt/chloroform procedure by adding
one step of chloroform-isoamylalcohol (24:1) [46]. The
mitochondrial haplotypes were determined by sequencing a 267 bp fragment of the 16SrRNA gene using universal primers [47]. Reactions were carried out in a 50 μl
volume containing 2 μl of template, 1.5 units of Taq DNA
Polymerase (Qiagen), 1× of its buffer, 1000 μM of MgCl2
and 100 μM of dNTP and 0.4 μM of each primer. The PCR
was run on a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT) starting with an initial denaturation at 94°C for
3 minutes, followed by 10 cycles at 44°C annealing temperature (50 sec at 92°C, 30 sec at 44°C and 40 sec at
72°C) and 35 cycles at 48°C annealing temperature (30
sec at 92°C, 30 sec at 48°C and 40 sec at 72°C), and
ended by a 3 minute final extension at 72°C. After amplification, all samples were controlled on a 1% agarose
minigel stained with ethidium bromide and run in a 1×
TBE buffer. The PCR products were then purified with a
QIAQuick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The purified DNA was eluted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/171

in 30 μl of dH2O. Samples were sent to a sequencing company (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland). Sequences
were edited, aligned on SEQUENCHER 3.0 (Gene Codes
Corporation) and the alignment manually corrected using
SEAVIEW[48].
We constructed a haplotype phylogeny to visualise haplotype clusters using MRBAYES v. 3.1 [49]. A GeneBank reference sequence for each of the nine previously identified
lineages was added [Lineages A to I as in [9]], as well as
sequences of Trochulus biconicus, T. caelatus, T. clandestinus,
T. alpicolus, T. piccardi and T. lubomirskii. Perforatella incarnata was included as the outgroup species. We ran MODELTEST V.3.7[50] on this extended dataset and selected a
GTR+R+I model, assuming a gamma-shaped rate variation and invariant sites. We ran two runs of four Metropolis coupled Monte Carlo Markov chains (MC3) for 10
million generations, sampling every 500th generation and
discarding the first 100'000 trees as burn-in. Convergence
was monitored by checking that the average standard
deviation of the split frequencies (i.e. the differences in
likelihood between the 2 runs) were below 0.1%
(MRBAYES).
Episodes of population growth and decline may also leave
characteristic signatures in the distribution of pairwise
nucleotide differences of populations (i.e. mismatch distribution). The mismatch distributions under a sudden
expansion model were computed for the two mitochondrial lineages (L1 and L2) with ARLEQUIN v.3.1 [51]. This
model assumes that an initial population at equilibrium
with θ = θ0 grows rapidly to a new size with θ = θ1, τ units
of mutational time ago, where θ = Neu and τ = 2 ut (Ne =
effective population size, u = mutation rate and t = time
since the expansion in generations). Goodness-of-fit tests
[52] of the observed to the expected distribution were
computed. The confidence intervals for τ were obtained
from 1000 bootstrap replicates.
Genotyping and spatial genotype clustering
The individuals belonging to the two mitochondrial lineages in focus were scored at 6 microsatellite loci – TROA6,
TROA111, TROB5, TROB108, TROB111 and TROB112 – following the published PCR conditions [53]. Amplifications were run on an ABI 3100 capillary sequencer
(Applied Biosystems) and scored with GENEMAPPER v.3
(Applied Biosystems).

We applied a Bayesian spatial population genetics clustering algorithm implemented in TESS 1.2 to obtain individual posterior membership probabilities of nuclear genepools [54,55]. The method is based on a hierarchical mixture model where the prior distribution of cluster labels is
defined as a Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) on a
spatial individual tessellation network. The program seeks
genetic structure from individual multilocus genotypes

sampled at different geographical locations without
assuming predefined clusters. It returns the membership
probabilities and cluster assignments of the individuals.
In the initial field sampling, we did not record individual
sampling points, as it is required by TESS. Therefore, we
assigned a randomised sampling point to each individual,
drawn from a square of 100 × 100 m around the recorded
sampling location as given in Table 1. This proceeding
actually models very well the sampling of land snails.
As the sampling sites are located along a river valley without a priori obstacle to dispersal, we left the neighbourhood diagram unmodified. We used the admixture model
in a Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain approach for the microsatellite data set, the interaction parameter set to 0.6 and
the allele frequency model parameter to 1.0. We were not
interested in intraspecific population structure but in gene
pool membership; the maximum number of clusters was
therefore set to two. We performed 200 runs with 50,000
sweeps per run with a burn-in of 12,000 sweeps, which
was sufficient to reach stationarity. We used the program
CLUMPP[56] to obtain averages of the 15% runs with the
highest likelihoods. We performed a G-test to test for
independence of mitochondrial lineage from nuclear
cluster.
Shell morphometrics and discriminant analysis
A hundred and seventy eight adult individuals were
selected for shell morphometric analyses according to
three criteria: the individual (i) belonged to one of the two
major mtDNA lineages and microsatellite data was available, (ii) had a shell with at least five complete whorls and
(iii) had a shell undamaged as much as to allow all measures. Fourteen measurements were taken on calibrated
digital pictures of the shells (Figure 4). From above, we
measured the decimal number of whorls (NTW computed
as the number of complete whorls plus the partial whorl
(in degrees; divided by 360), the width of the apex (APX),
the width of the first (SP1), second (SP2) and third whorl
(SP3) and the diameter of the spire without the last whorl
(DWL). From underneath, the diameter of the umbilicus
(DOM) and the width of the shell without the opening
(WWO) were taken. Finally, from a side perspective, we
measured the height of the spire (HSP), the height of the
first whorl (HFW), the diameter of the peristoma (DPR),
the height of the peristoma (HPR), the diameter of the
spire (DSP) and the shape, measured as the angle formed
by the apex and the most external sutures (AES) (Figure
4). As first exploratory approach, a principle component
analysis was performed. Two discriminant analyses were
run on the morphometric variables: a first with nuclear
cluster as grouping factor, a second with the mtDNA lineage. All analyses of the morphometric data were performed with STATISTICA 7 [57].
