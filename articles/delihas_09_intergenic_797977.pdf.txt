Abstract
Background: Borrelia species are unusual in that they contain a large number of linear and circular
plasmids. Many of these plasmids have long intergenic regions. These regions have many fragmented
genes, repeated sequences and appear to be in a state of flux, but they may serve as reservoirs for
evolutionary change and/or maintain stable motifs such as small RNA genes.
Results: In an in silico study, intergenic regions of Borrelia plasmids were scanned for
phylogenetically conserved stem loop structures that may represent functional units at the RNA
level. Five repeat sequences were found that could fold into stable RNA-type stem loop structures,
three of which are closely linked to protein genes, one of which is a member of the Borrelia
lipoprotein_1 super family genes and another is the complement regulator-acquiring surface
protein_1 (CRASP-1) family. Modeled secondary structures of repeat sequences display numerous
base-pair compensatory changes in stem regions, including C-G→A-U transversions when
orthologous sequences are compared. Base-pair compensatory changes constitute strong evidence
for phylogenetic conservation of secondary structure.
Conclusion: Intergenic regions of Borrelia species carry evolutionarily stable RNA secondary
structure motifs. Of major interest is that some motifs are associated with protein genes that show
large sequence variability. The cell may conserve these RNA motifs whereas allow a large flux in
amino acid sequence, possibly to create new virulence factors but with associated RNA motifs
intact.

Background
Intergenic regions of bacterial chromosomes carry important functional units such as transposable elements [1].
Small regulatory RNA genes are also abundantly found in
regions between protein coding genes [2-7]. In E. coli,
many intergenic regions and non-coding strands of
known genes are transcribed, resulting in a heterogeneous
collection of RNA transcripts, many of which are <65 nt
[8]. Bacterial intergenic chromosomal regions also carry
numerous small repeat sequences that can fold into RNAtype secondary structures [9-12]. Some represent non-

autonomous miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) [13,1]. Many are found immediately
downstream of, or overlapping terminal codons [14-16]
and may be regulatory units [14,15,17]. Small repeat elements carry a variety of motifs at either the DNA, transcribed RNA or translated protein levels and they may be
engines for evolutionary change [16,17].
Borrelia burgdorferi was first isolated and shown to be the
etiologic agent of Lyme Disease in the early 1980s [18,19].

related species, B. afzelii PKo and Borrelia garinii PB, have
been sequenced, as well as many of the associated plasmids [20-23]. These organisms possess multiple plasmids.
For example, B.bugrdorferi strain B31 has 12 linear plasmids and 9 circular plasmids [20,21]. Borrelia chromosomes are small relative to many bacterial genomes, e.g.,
the genome of Borrelia burgdorferi str. B31 is ~0.9 Mb and
Yersinia pestis str. Co92 genome is 4.6 Mb. Borrelia chromosomes represent a tight packing of protein genes where
there is little intergenic space. On the other hand, plasmids contain a much larger amount of intergenic space.
These regions are known to have sequences that translate
to repeat units of small peptides. In addition, they contain
a high percentage of fragmented genes, including those
from transposase genes, and interesting fusions of protein
motifs as well as [21]. This shows a rapid evolutionary
trend in these regions and perhaps plasmid intergenic
regions are where new protein and RNA genes and other
functional units may evolve.
A small number of Borrelia non-coding RNA genes have
been detected [24,25]. It has been assumed that Borrelia
has few small RNA genes, based on comparative genomic
searches for similarities to known bacterial small RNA
sequences [24]. However many regulatory RNA gene
sequences diverge between species, e.g., micC, micF and
ryhB (see Rfam website [26,27]), and analogous genes in
other species can be missed, especially between distantly
related species. In some cases, such as the regulatory RNA
DsrA, nucleotide sequences from different species show
few similarities [25]. Intergenic regions have not been further analyzed for evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary
structure motifs. These motifs can signal the presence of
functional units.
In a bioinformatics study, we show that several repeat
sequences in plasmid intergenic spaces and/or sequences
immediately downstream of coding regions sustained
multiple mutations, yet these sequences fold into highly
conserved RNA-type stem loop structures. Evolutionary
conservation indicates an essential role for these structures in the cell. In contrast, super family protein genes
associated with some conserved RNA-type structures display marked amino acid and peptide chain length differences and appear to be in a process of change and/or
decay. This raises interesting questions concerning how
these peptide-RNA linked elements will evolve with time.

Results
Repeat sequences of intergenic nucleotide sequences of
Borrelia plasmids were analyzed for secondary structure
motifs using the Zuker m-fold program [28,29]. In addition, the RNAz program was used to confirm thermodynamically stable and evolutionarily conserved RNA
secondary structures [30]. Intergenic sequences from plasmids lp60 and lp28 of B. afzelii Pko were completely

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/101

scanned manually for repeat sequences and RNA motifs.
In addition, selected regions that contain relatively large
intergenic regions from B. burgdorferi B31 and Borrelia
garinii PB plasmids were also scanned. Most regions did
not yield conserved stem loop structures, however five
intergenic nucleotide sequences were found to display
evolutionary conserved stem loop structures (Table 1).
Sequence #1
A 60 nt intergenic sequence (Sequence #1, Table 1) was
found in nine plasmids from B. afzelii Pko and B. burgdorferi B31. Alignment of these sequences reveals a major
conserved region that is approximately at the center of the
polynucleotide nucleotide chain (Figure 1). The EMBLEBI CLUSTALW 2.0.8 multiple sequence alignment program [31,32] was used for alignment. Twenty out of 60
nucleotide positions show base substitutions. A comparison of sequences shows a 77–100% sequence identity
between the nine plasmid sequences. Sequences homologous to Sequence #1 have not been detected in B. garinii
PBi plasmids or Borrelia chromosomal sequences.

RNA secondary structure modeling of the nine sequences
shows a high conservation of secondary structure with
multiple base substitutions that maintain base pairing. In
addition, a bulged U at position 23 is found invariant in
all nine sequences. Figure 2a–c depicts RNA secondary
structure models from three of the nine plasmid
sequences. Base substitutions at individual positions are
depicted in Figure 2c. Mutations at six base-paired positions in the upper portion of the stem loop show compensatory changes that conserve the stem structure (Figure
2c). Prominent are the base pair changes at positions C14G47 that result in A14-U47 pairing in the sequence of plasmid Bb pl17 (Fig. 2a) and U14-A47 pairing in two other
plasmid sequences (Figure 2c). Base pair positions 14 and
47 appear to be "hot spots" for mutations, but nevertheless, Watson-Crick base pairing is maintained. The C14G47→A14-U47 substitution is highly significant in that it
shows the double mutation, pyrimidine→purine,
purine→pyrimidine. This is a transversion and has a lower
probability of occurring than purine→purine and pyrimidine→pyrimidine transitions. The C-G→U-G transition at
positions 19,20 and 41,42 (Figure 2c) are between orthologous genes in Bb lp28-4 and Ba lp60-2. The base pairing
at the terminal end of the stem differs between several
plasmid structures (e.g., compare Figure 2a and 2b with
2c). Although the three A-U base pairs at the base of the
stem (positions A6–8 and U53–55) are conserved in all plasmid sequences, in plasmids Bb lp28-2 and Bb lp36, a
G56→A56 substitution appears to partially destabilize the
base stem structure (data not shown). The cut off at the 60
nt length for Sequence #1 was made because sequences
extended from the 5' and 3' ends do not yield additional
conserved secondary structure motifs. This however does
not preclude that the 60 nt stem loop is part of a larger

functional unit that may not show prominent conserved
secondary structure motifs.
Sequence #1 was also analyzed by the RNAz bioinformatics program [30], which predicts RNA structures that may
be evolutionarily conserved. The results as depicted on the
RNAz website are shown in Additional file 1. The secondary structure displayed at the bottom of Additional file 1
is identical to that depicted in Figure 2c. The descriptive
section at the top of the figure reveals a mean z-score of 6.43 (a score less than 0.0 indicates that a structure is
more stable than one expected by chance). The prediction
is that Sequences #1 represents evolutionarily conserved
RNA structures. Base pairing for five individual sequences
is shown in the middle section of Additional file 1. Thus
the RNAz analysis confirms the predicted evolutionary
conservation of Sequence #1 secondary structures derived
manually.
In terms of nearest neighbor genes, the 60 nt repeat element is not located upstream or downstream of plasmid
annotated genes in a consistent manner, both in terms of
spacing and type of gene, although it is close to two puta-

tive transposase genes. For example, the repeat element is
found 39 bp upstream of locus BAPKO_4522 in Ba lp28.
This locus encodes a putative 378 aa transposase. In Bb
lp28-4, it is situated 37 base pairs downstream of locus
BB_I41, which encodes a putative 80 aa protein. BB_I41 is
a fragmented gene and shares the 5' end of a 155 aa transposase encoded by BB_H40 in Bb lp28-3. In Bb lp28-2,
the 60 base pair repeat sequence overlaps the 3' end of
BB_G01 by 3 bp. Locus BB_G01 encodes a 297 aa hypothetical protein.
Sequence #2
A second set of repeat sequences displays inverted repeats
and these are found in eleven loci in ten plasmids from
the three Borrelia species, B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii and B.
garinii. Alignment of nt sequences reveals there are a significant number of base substitutions as well as insertions/and or deletions [see Additional file 2]. Nucleotide
positions 4–31 (sequence numbering positions from Ba
lp34) comprise inverted repeats.

RNA secondary structure modeling of putative RNA transcripts shows that all eleven sequences display stem loop

structures which contain 11–13 base pairs. Additional file
3 shows representative secondary structures and depicts
several base-pair compensatory changes in the stem, e.g.,
A8-U27 pairing in B. afzelii lp34 changes to C8-G29 in B.
burgdorferi lp25 and A5-U30→U5-A29 in B. burgdorferi lp283. Again, these are examples of pyrimidine→purine and
purine→pyrimidine mutational transversions, and these
are found between orthologs. Additional base substitutions in other plasmid sequences result in G-U noncanonical pairing (data not shown). The presence of noncanonical pairs implies that the conserved structure may
function at the RNA level as opposed to the DNA level.
The loop structure sustained base substitutions and insertions/deletions, which resulted in major differences in
loop sequences [see Additional file 3]. The stem length
varies, but the invariant A4-U31 pair is always at the terminal end of the stem and is straddled by invariant A3 and
A32 (numbering position relative to the Ba lp34 sequence
[see Additional file 3]. This arrangement is found in all
eleven of the stem loop structures (data not shown).
By bioinformatics methods, random mutations were
introduced in Sequence #2 to ascertain the probability of
compensatory base pair changes arising by random base
changes. For example, after adding 3 mutations to the 34
nt Sequence #2 and initiating 30 trials of random mutagenesis, the stem was found disrupted (with mispairs) in
>90% of trials, and all 30 trials showed a resultant
decrease (towards [+] side) in delta G, and in some cases
there was a decrease by a factor of 10 in the delta G value.
The configuration of the stem was drastically altered in 10

of the 30 trials (data not shown). Single base compensatory changes in the stem occurred in about 10% of trials,
but at the same time the accompanying mutations (again,
3 mutations/34 nt were induced) caused a partial disruption of the stem. Double compensatory mutations, such
as U-A → C-G and the less probable transversion, U-A →
G-C, did not appear. These trials show a trend towards disruption of an ordered structure by addition of random
mutations. In sharp contrast, biological mutations within
11 homologous sequences (23 positions showing mutations out of ~34 nt of Sequence #2) display numerous
base-pair compensatory changes, including transversions,
show no mispairing, no stem alterations (such as formation of a bulged or looped positions), and several insertions/deletions that were closely confined to the unpaired
looped region where they do not induce changes in the
stem loop configuration. Strong evolutionary pressures
appear to maintain the secondary structure motif of
Sequence #2.
Borrelia plasmids contain the superfamily of protein genes
that encode Borrelia_lipoprotein_1 [20,33,23]. Significantly, the eleven stem loop sequences are found primarily between 14 and 33 bp downstream of a family of
lipoprotein_1 genes, as well sequences that encode fragments of lipoprotein_1. The stem loop-associated
lipoprotein_1/lipoprotein_1 fragment amino acid
sequences are shown in Figure 3. The stem loop sequence
in Ba lp60 is 24 bp downstream of locus BAPKO_2001, a
putative lipoprotein_1 gene encoding a 237 aa protein.
On the other hand, there is no lipoprotein_1 gene annoPage 4 of 12

3' end of the sequence encoding the 14 aa C-terminal fragment. On the other hand, there is an 18 bp overlap of the
stem loop sequence with the 3' end sequence of locus
BB_H32 encoding a lipoprotein_1 gene in Bb lp28-3, yet
the stem loop structure is conserved with multiple basepair compensatory changes (e.g., compare figures a and d,
Additional file 3). Thus in cases where the stem loop has
been detected, there is phylogenetic conservation of secondary structure and conservation of its location downstream of or partially overlapping lipoprotein_1 genes/
lipoprotein_1 gene fragments. The high conservation of
repeat element secondary structure suggests there is evolutionary pressure to maintain a subset of lipoprotein_1
genes/gene fragments with downstream sequences that
can fold into a stem loop structure. However, not all
lipoprotein_1 genes have the conserved hairpin and the
stem loop may be specific to the subset of lipoprotein-1
genes outlined above. For example, locus BAPKO_4514 in
Ba lp28 encodes a putative 261aa lipoprotein_1, which
does not have the characteristic stem loop.
Sequence #3
Borrelia sp. encode the virulence factor termed complement
regulator-acquiring surface protein 1 (CRASP-1) [34-36].
This protein binds factor H, resulting in inhibition of complement activation in mammals. CRASP-1 proteins from B.
afzelii lp54 and other Borrelia species plasmids have been
isolated and their properties characterized [36].

tated upstream of the stem loop repeat element in Bb
lp56. This upstream region has high nucleotide and
amino acid sequence identities to lipoprotein_1, but the
translated lipoprotein_1 amino acid sequence contains
several stop codons (Figure 3). With plasmid Bg lp54, the
stem loop repeat element is located 93 bp from the left
end (5' end) of the plasmid. Thus, most of the upstream
sequence of the lipoprotein_1 gene would have been lost
upon a putative translocation of lipoprotein_1. Nevertheless, a C-terminal 14 aa fragment is found that is highly
similar to lipoprotein_1 C-terminal sequences (Figure 3).
The Bg lp54 34 nt stem loop is 26 bp downstream of the

Multiple copies of sequences analogous to CRASP-1 genes
have been detected in Borrelia plasmids. These include
sequences in loci BAPKO_2065- BAPKO_2070 from B.
afzelii lp60 [see Additional file 4]. A comparison shows
that the translated aa sequence from Ba lp60 locus
BAPKO_2068 and the aa sequence derived experimentally
from the Ba lp54 CRASP-1 protein (whose gene locus is
termed Ba_lp54 mmsa71) are almost identical and show
only 5 aa changes out of 241 aa. In addition, the factor H
binding motif, 232KDLDSFNP239 is present in locus
BAPKO_2068 and the Ba lp54 CRASP-1 mmsa71 gene [see
Additional file 4]. BAPKO_2068 and Ba lp54 mmsa71
(CRASP-1) probably are paralogous genes and the
BAPKO_2065-2070 superfamily are also paralogs resulting from gene duplication. However an amino acid
sequence alignment of this family of loci shows several
major insertions/deletions and amino acid substitutions
[see Additional file 4]. The bottom figure in Additional
file 4 shows a phylogram of this gene family.

highly conserved (Figure 4). Secondary structure modeling of putative transcripts of downstream sequences

show two stem loop structures [see Additional file 5].
Stem loop #2 is highly conserved with numerous base pair
compensatory changes, but it also has a 3' terminal oligouridine. It probably represents a Rho-independent transcription termination site for CRASP-1 and related
putative gene transcripts. Stem loop 1 is present in all
repeat sequences but shows variations in secondary structure (e.g., compare figures a and b in Additional file 5).
The significance of this stem loop is unknown, but it may
reside within a putative 3'UTR region. The high conservation of the stem loop 2 secondary structure contrasts with
the variability in overall amino acid sequence, differences
in factor H binding site sequence (232KDLDSFNP239) and
peptide chain length of associated protein genes [see
Additional file 4].
Figure 5 shows a diagrammatic representation of virulence protein genes lipoprotein_1 and CRASP-1 with their
associated RNA motifs at the 3' ends. The amino acids
sequences of both genes vary between homologous
sequences and some gene copies are degenerate. However,
the associated RNA secondary structures are evolutionarily highly conserved.
Sequence #4
Sequence #4 (Table 1) is 122 nt and has an inverted repeat
segment (positions 26245–26290 in Ba lp60). This sequence
is not located near any protein genes. It is 233 bp downstream of locus BAPKO_2033, which encodes an oligopeptide ABC transporter, and 171 bp upstream of BAPKO_2034,
a putative lipoprotein gene. Sequence #4 from Ba lp60 is
highly conserved in Bg lp54, but only a part of the sequence
is conserved in Bb lp54 [see Additional file 6]. Comparison
of positions 52–122 show less than 40% similarity between
sequences of Bb lp54 and Ba lp60. A comparison and analysis of Sequence #4 and flanking regions in plasmid Bb lp54
shows that the 122 bp sequence has been recombined in the
opposite orientation (data not shown). This resulted in a
major change in sequence between Bb p54 and Ba lp60 and
Bg lp54 downstream of position 53 [see Additional file 6].
The approximate 5' half of the sequences are very similar due
to the inverted repeat, which provides a similar sequence in
the opposite orientation.

Secondary structure models of the 122 nt sequence reveal
that a structural motif is conserved between the three
sequences [see Additional file 7]. The three models display two stem loops and one small stem (stem 3). Stem
loop 1 consists of the inverted repeat and has 21 contiguous Watson-Crick base pairs (positions 7–52 in Ba lp60).
The sequence in Bb 54 is not a perfect inverted repeat but
there are base compensatory changes that maintain the 21
Watson-Crick base pairs, i.e., there are two G-C pairs in Bb
lp54 in place of two non canonical G-U pairs in Ba lp 60
and Bg lp54. The presence of stem loop 2 is of major significance in that it is in a region with very low nt sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/101

identity, yet a similar stem loop is maintained but with
extensive differences in base pairing (compare stem loop
2, figures 1a and 1b, see Additional file 7). This type of
phylogenetically conserved motif is characteristic of secondary structural properties of some small non-coding
RNAs, where secondary structure and not necessarily
sequence is conserved, e.g., see [37]. This conservation
implies a functional importance for this 122 nt sequence,
which may represent a non-coding RNA.
Sequences #5
Sequence #5 is 150 nt in length and is found in plasmids
of three Borrelia species, Ba lp60 from B. afzelii PKo, Bb
lp54 from B. burgdorferi str. B31 and Bg lp54 in B. garinii
PB. This sequence is highly conserved with nt sequence
identities > 95% between the three sequences. The
sequence at positions 14913–14964 from B. burgdorferi
B31 plasmid lp54 represent a perfect inverted repeat. Secondary structure modeling shows the presence of three
stem loops in all three plasmid sequences. The structure
from Bb lp54 is shown in Additional file 8. It is highly stable thermodynamically with a delta G of -53.3 kcal/mol.
A comparison of different plasmid structures shows three
base substitutions in stem 3 that maintain the base-pairing, but two other substitutions produce A-A and A-G
non-canonical pairs (data not shown). Stem 3 is not
destabilized, but there are small decreases in the delta G
value to -43.3 kcal/mol (Bg lp54) and -43.6 kcal/mol (Ba
lp60). In the context of surrounding base pairs, noncanonical pairs such as A-A and A-G are present in RNA
double helices [38] and have been found to contribute to
RNA stem double helical conformations [39,40].

An analysis of Sequence #5 by the RNAz bioinformatics
program shows a predicted evolutionarily conserved RNA
structure with a mean z-value of -6.04 [see Additional file
9].
Sequence #5 is immediately downstream of loci
BAPKO_2021, BGA_19 and BB_A21. These loci represent
highly conserved proteins that have been annotated as
hypothetical proteins. However they have amino acid
sequence and putative protein domain similarities to a
plasmid partition protein (PF-49 encoded on plasmid
cp32-11 in B. burgdorferi) when analyzed by Pfam [41-44].
The aa sequence identity to PF-49 is 55% as determined
by the ExPASy Proteomics Server [45,46]. Although the
Sequence #5 stem loops reveal an interesting highly stable
structure that is linked to a conserved protein, additional
sequences homologous to Sequence #5 would be needed
to further support a proposed phylogenetic conservation
of secondary structure.

In genomes of many bacterial species, intergenic regions
are found to be rich in repeat elements such as MITEs

Borrelia contains transposase genes that are found in other
bacterial species [20]. Some plasmids show a high percentage of transposase-specific nucleotide sequences which may
not be evident from gene annotations, e.g., the first ~1400 bp
of the left side of B. afzelii PKo plasmid lp28 starting at nucleotide position 1 consists entirely of transposase-related
sequences (unpublished results). There may also be nonautonomous transposable elements present in Borrelia that
are moved and replicated by transposases. As many other
bacteria contain these elements [1], it would not be surprising if Borrelia had its own set of non-autonomous small
transposable elements, possibly with their own specific signatures. Repeat Sequence #2 described above should be further analyzed for a possible relationship to bacterial MITEs.

[9,12,13,1,17], other small nucleotide sequence repeats
[11,47] and small non-coding RNA genes [48,3-7]. Here
we analyzed intergenic plasmid regions from three species
of Borrelia and have detected intergenic sequences that can
fold into conserved RNA secondary structures. Compelling evidence for evolutionary conservation comes from
comparisons of homologous sequences, where numerous
base-pair changes are found to maintain stem loop structures. These stem loops are specific to plasmid sequences,
and none have been detected in Borrelia chromosomes or
in sequences from other bacterial species.
Two RNA-motifs associated with super families of protein
genes (lipoprotein_1 and CRASP-1) show a high conservation of secondary structure between homologs, yet
these gene families show extensive amino acid substitutions and deletions/insertions. Perhaps the cell maintains
these RNA motifs as reservoirs and as potential functional
units in the formation of new variant proteins. A major
focus in future work should be to determine if variant
CRASP-1 and lipoprotein-1 loci are translated.
Sequence #2 contains inverted repeats and is located less
than 35 bp downstream of putative lipoprotein_1 genes,
and in one case overlaps the terminal codon sequences.
This is very similar to the location of several miniature
inverted repeats, the MITEs that are present in other bacterial species. These inverted repeats are also found downstream of genes, and in some cases are found to overlap Cterminal codons [13,14,16,17,49]. In Yersinia, genes situated upstream of MITEs appear to be regulated by these
inverted repeat elements, which are transcribed into RNA
[50]. Although Sequence #2 differs from bacterial MITEs
in not having a large nucleotide segment between inverted
repeats, the proximity of this sequence to C-terminal coding ends of genes is similar to that of several MITEs.

Stem loops that are proximal to protein genes have been
reported before. Dunn et al [51] described two inverted
repeat sequences in tandem with perfect base paired stems
in B. burgdorferi in circular plasmid cp8.3. The hairpins are
adjacent to putative -35 promoter sequences of an open
reading frame. Also, an inverted repeat sequence is found
in the 5' flanking region of the bba64 (P35) gene in B.
burgdorferi [52]. However the above sequences, which are
upstream of genes in promoter regions, are unrelated to
those reported here.
Stem loop 2, from Sequence #3 is downstream of the
CRASP-1-related genes and appears to have classic Rho-independent termination signatures in terms of size and oligo U
tail. The adjacent stem loop 1 may be part of a putative 3'
UTR of CRASP-1 and CRASP-1-related proteins. Functions
can not presently be assigned, but it should be noted that
some small RNAs in E. coli represent 3' UTR transcripts which
show different expression levels from associated mRNAs and
may have independent functions [8]. Sequences #1, #4, and
#5 appear to have typical RNA signatures with long stem
loops and bulged/looped positions. Without further characterization, functional roles cannot be assigned. But of particular interest is the conservation of the bulged U at position
23 of the Sequence #1 stem loop. Many RNA secondary
structures display conserved bulged positions and these have
functional roles in RNA/RNA interactions [53,54]. Sequence
#1 does not appear to be linked to any protein genes and is
present in nine different plasmids. This poses the question of
how it was transferred and why the sequence is duplicated.
Interestingly, Sequence #4 is found in three different species,
B. burgdorferi str. B31, B. afzelii PKo and B. garinii PB but in
only one copy number. Thus this RNA motif may provide an
essential function in Borrelia, as it is found in all three species.
Once complete genome sequences of other Borrelia species
are determined, it would be of interest to see if Sequence #4
and/or its characteristic secondary structural model is also
present in these species.
Only a limited number of plasmids have been analyzed
for repeat sequences that fold into RNA motifs, but a more

comprehensive search is necessary to assess their abundance. Experimental RNA analyses such as Northern blots
needs to be done to determine if these sequences are transcribed, but in view of the strong evidence for evolutionary conservation of secondary structure, they may
function at the RNA level. In E. coli, many intergenic
sequences are transcribed, which results in the presence of
a large number of heterogeneous small RNAs [8]. These
elements also have not been analyzed for function.

Conclusion
Small repeat sequences of Borrelia sp. linear plasmids
show numerous changes in nucleotide sequence, nevertheless, RNA-type motifs generated by these variable
sequences are highly conserved evolutionarily. Two of the
motifs may be candidates for non-coding RNAs. Two others appear linked to C-terminal ends of super families of
protein genes/pseudogenes, but these genes display major
changes in amino acid sequence and peptide chain length.
Jacob Monod described evolutionary change in terms of
"tinkering", a trial and error process in formation of new
or modified genes with random mutations and/or random fusion of motifs [55]. Perhaps the variable super
family virulence protein gene sequences show elements of
"tinkering", however the interesting question is why the
RNA motifs, which have also sustained mutations are well
conserved when at least some of the associated protein
genes are in a process of change or decay. We have mentioned the possibility of these being reservoirs for formation of variant or new proteins.

Methods
To search for conserved intergenic sequences, NCBI/
BLAST
BLAST
Assembled
Genomes
http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi[56] and BLAST with
microbial genomes http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/
genom_table.cgi[57] were used. Blast with microbial
genomes used a value of 10 for expect and the default filter. Nucleotide blast searches were optimized for both
highly similar sequences megablast and discontiguous
megablast. Default parameters were used. For similar
sequence megablast the parameters were: maximum target sequences, 100; automatically adjusted for short
sequences; expect, 10; word size, 28. Discontinuous
match/mismatch scores, 1,-2; gap costs, linear; filter, low
complexity regions. Discontinuous megablast: same
parameters as those of similar sequence megablast with
the exception word size, 11; match/mismatch scores, 2, 3; gap costs, existence: 5 extension: 2.
The Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics SIB ExPASy Blast
server [46] was used to find protein homologies. The blast
program and data base used was: blastp – query against
the UniProt Knowledgebase (Swiss-Prot + TrEMBL) and
default parametes as shown under "Options" were used.
The database was the complete database.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/101

Initial searches for repeat sequences and RNA motifs were
performed by "walking" intergenic sequences from plasmid lp28 of B. afzelii Pko. In addition, several regions that
contain relatively large intergenic sequenes from B. burgdorferi B31 and Borrelia garinii PB plasmids were also scanned.
Intergenic regions were scanned at 200 bp at a time for conserved or partially sequences. These sequences were then
modeled for conserved RNA stem loops. Cut offs in regions
5' and 3' of a determined stem loop(s) were made when the
additional sequences failed to provide conserved stemloops. Reverse transcript sequences as well as overlapping
sequences at the 200 bp junctions were also structure modeled. Repeat sequences were found that displayed stemloop structures, but these structures either were not found
conserved in homologous sequences in other Borrelia species, or the nt sequence identity was too high and thus the
structures did not show base-pair changes. These were discarded. The criteria for potential RNA identification were as
follows: 1) presence of the sequence in three or more different plasmid regions and/or two or more Borrelia species, 2)
presence of a conserved stem loop with at least 9 contiguous base-pairs, 3) two or more compensatory base changes
that maintain a stem, 4) in some cases, the presence of conserved looped out or bulged positions.
RNA secondary structure modeling of repeat nt sequences
was performed with the Zuker and Turner mfold, version
3.2 [28,29]. Parameters used were: default window
parameter, maximum interior/bulge loop size = 30, Maximum asymmetry of an interior/bulge loop = 30, and no
limit on maximum distance between paired bases.
The RNAz Webserver: http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/
RNAz.cgi[58] of Gruber et al [30] was used to detect thermodynamically stable and evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structures from multiple sequence alignments. The
sequence alignment was ClustalW format. Default parameters
were used, except for the Reading Direction set at forward.
The ClustalW2 program http://www.ebi.ac.uk/[59] provided by the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute [31]
was used for amino acid and nucleotide sequence alignments. Parameters were as set on the EMBL-EBI web page:
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html[32].
Random sequence analyses as described for Sequence #2
were performed using the Stothard mutagenesis program on
webpage: http://molbiol.ru/eng/scripts/01_16.html[60].
