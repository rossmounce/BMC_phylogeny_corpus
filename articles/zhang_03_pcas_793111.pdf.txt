Abstract
Background: Many model proteomes or "complete" sets of proteins of given organisms are now
publicly available. Much effort has been invested in computational annotation of those "draft"
proteomes. Motif or domain based algorithms play a pivotal role in functional classification of
proteins. Employing most available computational algorithms, mainly motif or domain recognition
algorithms, we set up to develop an online proteome annotation system with integrated proteome
annotation data to complement existing resources.
Results: We report here the development of PCAS (ProteinCentric Annotation System) as an
online resource of pre-computed proteome annotation data. We applied most available motif or
domain databases and their analysis methods, including hmmpfam search of HMMs in Pfam, SMART
and TIGRFAM, RPS-PSIBLAST search of PSSMs in CDD, pfscan of PROSITE patterns and profiles, as
well as PSI-BLAST search of SUPERFAMILY PSSMs. In addition, signal peptide and TM are predicted
using SignalP and TMHMM respectively. We mapped SUPERFAMILY and COGs to InterPro, so the
motif or domain databases are integrated through InterPro. PCAS displays table summaries of precomputed data and a graphical presentation of motifs or domains relative to the protein. As of now,
PCAS contains human IPI, mouse IPI, and rat IPI, A. thaliana, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, S. cerevisiae,
and S. pombe proteome.
PCAS is available at http://pak.cbi.pku.edu.cn/proteome/gca.php
Conclusion: PCAS gives better annotation coverage for model proteomes by employing a wider
collection of available algorithms. Besides presenting the most confident annotation data, PCAS
also allows customized query so users can inspect statistically less significant boundary information
as well. Therefore, besides providing general annotation information, PCAS could be used as a
discovery platform. We plan to update PCAS twice a year. We will upgrade PCAS when new
proteome annotation algorithms identified.

Background
Proteome is defined as a "complete" set of proteins of a
given model organism. Many proteomes are now availa-

ble. Much effort have been invested in computational
annotation of those "draft" proteomes. Motif or domain
based algorithms play pivotal roles in proteome

annotation. This is mostly because of their sensitivity, coverage and the well-curated functional information associated with known motifs or domains. Over the years, many
motif or domain databases have been developed
(PROSITE [1], Pfam [2], SMART [3], TIGRFAM [4],
PRINTS [5], Blocks [6], ProDom [7] etc.), so have their
underlying computation methods (pfscan [8], HMMER
[9], FingerPRINTScan [10] etc.). InterPro [11] provides an
integrated resource to cross-reference such motif or
domain databases. InterProScan [12] has integrated various analysis methods to provide an InterPro based integrated platform for motif or domain recognition.
Consistent with this effort, CDD [13] provides another
rich resource for functional motifs or domains, which
could complement those in InterPro. RPS-PSIBLAST [14] is
the analysis method to classify protein with CDD PSSMs.
There are also regular expression pattern matching methods for general or special applications in database search
[15-18]. However, they are less used in general proteome
annotation effort.
Since different motif or domain databases and their specific algorithms, diagnostically may have different sensitivities and specificities, they usually have different
coverages when annotating a collection of proteins such
as proteome [19]. Thus, as InterPro [11,12] and PIR [20],
integrated annotation platform best consists of a collection of motif or domain databases and their respective
analysis methods. Complementary to existing resources,
here we developed an online proteome annotation system
with wider collection of available algorithms and coverage of integrated domain or motif databases.

1.3.26 from http://Apache.org; GD graphics library 1.8.0
from http://Boutell.com
All of the algorithms were run with default parameters.
After that, the original results were parsed by Perl scripts.
Data were stored in MySQL database.
Apache and PHP were used to set up the web server and
write the web pages. The graphical display in PCAS was
realized by calling GD graphics library.
Annotation Pipeline
PCAS, ProteinCentric Annotation System, includes most
of the motif or domain databases and analysis methods
mentioned above. Moreover, we included SCOP [21]
based SUPERFAMILY [22] classification and COG [23]
classification. SUPERFAMILY analysis offers structure
based protein annotation; COG, short for Clusters of
Orthologous Groups of proteins, is a system delineated by
comparing protein sequences encoded in over forty complete genomes that represent 30 major phylogenetic lineages. Assigning proteins to COGs could provide not only
valuable evolutional inference but also functional information derived from evolutional analysis. We also
included SignalP [24] and TMHMM [25] to perform a priori prediction of leader peptide and TM regions, which is
indicative of proper function of a protein.

application software in current PCAS:

Cross-reference Motif or Domain Database
We used InterPro system as the basis for data integration,
which consists of most available motif or domain databases. Certain subsets in CDD and InterPro are overlapping. Therefore, through CDD, we can also map COG and
SUPERFAMILY to InterPro.

Mapping COGs to InterPro
According to the embedded relations between different
CDD subsets, we can map COGs to Pfam and Smart then
to InterPro. For example, in CDD database, COG0004 is
related to Pfam00909, which is a signature of IPR001905;
COG0004 is then mapped to IPR001905. Among the
4873 COG PSSMs in current CDD release 1.62, 2285
COGs were related to Pfam or SMART, and were mapped
to InterPro database. Some of the unmapped COGs may
be associated with more than one InterPro entry, and the
rest simply are not included in current InterPro 6.1 yet.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/42

(The length coverage of the aligned CDD representative
sequence over the full length of the CDD representative
sequence)
Total 561 out of 3446 1:1 relations were initially filtered
out. By matching descriptions in SUPERFAMILY and InterPro, we further retained 4 mappings.
For 1:N relations, the coverage filters are a bit more stringent that above:
0.8 <=sf_length/cdd_length < = 1.25

Mapping SUPERFAMILY to InterPro
There are 7550 HMMs representing 1109 superfamilies.
We first map those HMMs to CDDs by performing
hmmpfam search against CDD's representative
sequences, then using the embedded CDD and InterPro
cross references, map those SUPERFAMILY HMMs to
InterPro entries and further map SUPERFAMILY to InterPro. Detailed mapping strategy is described as following:

sf_coverage > = 0.75
cdd_coverage > = 0.75
1957 1:N relations were filtered out. By matching descriptions in SUPERFAMILY and InterPro, we further retained
22 mappings. At this point, all the mappings are 1:1
relations.

Step1, apply E value cutoff at 0.01.
202 SUPERFAMILY HMMs that have no hits and 464
HMMs that only have hits with E value greater than 0.01
were thrown out.
Step2: filter out those with CDD and InterPro link broken
90 HMMs are filtered out since their CDD hits have no
corresponding InterPro entries.
The remaining 6994 (7550-202-464-90) HMMs were
divided into 3548 1:1 relations (one SUPERFAMILY
model corresponds to one InterPro entry) and 3446 1:N
relations (one SUPERFAMILY model corresponds to more
than one InterPro entries).
Step3: apply coverage filters
For 1:1 relations, we applied following coverage filters:

In summary, 4502 (26+1489+2987) out of 7550 SUPERFAMILY HMMs are mapped to InterPro entries, and they
are all 1:1 mappings. In terms of 1109 superfamilies, 551
have only one InterPro entry; the rest are mapped to zero
or multiple InterPro entries, with 66 as the maximum (Ploop containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases in
SUPERFAMILY). For those with multiple InterPro entries,
we treated them as unmapped, since those InterPro entries
most likely represent certain subfamilies and it is scientifically inaccurate to use subfamily's definition to describe
superfamily.
We would like to point out that the purpose of mapping
SUPERFAMILY to InterPro here is to find out the best possible InterPro description for a particular SUPERFAMILY
member. Therefore, we took relatively stringent mapping
conditions described above. This enables PCAS to steer
clear from the possible complication caused by multidomain protein families or by superfamily, subfamily
relationships.

0.5 <= sf_length / cdd_length <= 2;

Utility and Discussion
(The length ratio of SUPERFAMILY HMM and CDD representative sequence)
sf_coverage >= 0.75;
(The length coverage of the aligned query SUPERFAMILY
HMM over the full length of the query SUPERFAMILY
HMM.)
cdd_coverage >= 0.75.

PCAS Query and Display
The query of PCAS for pre-computed proteome annotation data is initiated with a protein identifier, for example,
the SPTR or IPI protein ID or AC. One can also query
PCAS through key word text search or blast with protein
amino acid sequence. When blast is used, lists of blast hits
in the target proteomes will be returned if exist, which are
linked to the pre-computed annotation information. One
needs to infer the annotation of the query protein from
the blast hits. However, this annotation transfer should
not happen if the query protein is not similar enough to

BMC Genomics 2003, 4

the blast hits [26,27]. The query is customized so users can
specify the statistical cut off (not shown); users can even
directly specify the number of hits to be displayed (5 is the
default). Query customization in PCAS allows query for
statistically less confident borderline annotation data
which may be indicative of novel functions.
Figure 1 shows the PCAS query display, which is organized as following. General header is the header information of the protein in the proteome. It comes from the
public annotation effort when the proteome is released.
After the header information, there is the overview of the
computational results, which consists of table summaries
of pre-computed annotation data. The first table summary
is the pre-computed data from motif or domain based
algorithms and sorted based on statistical significance. In
this table format, InterPro based data integration is
expressed by coloring. Hits mapped to the same IPR name
(InterPro ID) will be displayed in the same color. In
another word, the same motif or domain hit by the query
protein using different algorithms is displayed with the
same color. Currently the color-coding is limited to the
top five different protein motifs or domains for simplicity.
This color-coding schema is implemented throughout this
display page including the InterPro description table and
the graphic display section. The second table summary is
InterPro description table, which displays the non-redundant InterPro descriptions for the entire motif or domain
hits by the query protein displayed in the first table. If a
motif or domain is not mapped to InterPro, one can click
on the motif link to get its functional description.
The SignalP [24] and TMHMM [25] results are displayed
in the third summary table. SignalP predicts if there is a
leader peptide, which is the hallmark for secreted proteins
and some TM proteins. TMHMM predicts the TM
proteins.
PCAS also displays graphically the alignment of each
domain or motif relative to the query protein. If exist,
leader peptide or TM domains are also indicated.
A link to the annotation data in text format is also provided in the display page (top of Figure 1) so the user can
save it for further analysis.
Annotation Coverage
As expected, combination of many computational algorithms increased proteome annotation coverage. As
shown in Table 1, for Arabidopsis, the overall motif or
domain-based annotation coverage in PCAS is about
80%. Not surprisingly, HMMER and RPS have most coverage because of their sensitivity and the larger collection
of motif or domains in Pfam/SMART/TIGRFAM and CDD

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/42

databases. SUPERFAMILY and PRINTS have less coverage.
pfscan often produces too many hits. When stringent conditions applied, such as skipping frequently matched patterns and PROSITE entries associated with false
SWISSPROT hits [8], pfscan also has low coverage (see
table 1). For signal peptide and TM prediction, out of
26032 proteins, SignalP, which consists of SignalP-NN
and SignalP-HMM [24], predicts in total 7371 proteins
with leader peptide (6932 by SignalP-NN, 4249 by SignalP-HMM; 3810 is the overlap); TMHMM [25] predicts
5971 proteins with TM. For human IPI, PCAS annotation
coverage is just over 70%.
Besides Human IPI and A. thaliana proteome, Mouse IPI,
Rat IPI, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, S. cerevisiae, and S.
pombe proteomes are also included in PCAS. Zebrafish,
Fugu and C. inestinalis are being annotated.
We plan to update PCAS at least twice a year limited by the
computing resources. We will upgrade PCAS by including
new proteome annotation algorithms identified.

Conclusions
Complementary with the existed proteome annotation
efforts, we employed most of the advanced motif and
domain based algorithms, to annotate model proteomes.
We developed a database and interface system to store and
present (query and display) the pre-computed annotation
data. We termed this system PCAS (ProteinCentric Annotation System). Comparing with InterPro's daughter profile databases and their respective search methods in
InterProScan, in PCAS, we also included PSI-BLAST search
of protein fold based Superfamily, RPS-BLAST search of
NCBI CDD PSSMs, which contains the COGs database
and NCBI curated CD database. We employed the internal
relations between CDD to map COGs with InterPro, and a
semi-automatic pipeline to map Superfamily with InterPro. This enabled us to integrate most of the motif or
domain based annotation data in PCAS through InterPro
system, and to get rid of the presentation of redundant
data from different algorithms. Excluding signal peptide
and TM prediction and with this current collection of
motif or domain based algorithms, we achieved better
annotation coverage by PCAS. Taking human IPI2.18 proteome set as an example, PCAS gave annotation coverage
of 70% (Table 1) comparing with InterPro at 62% (result
came from parsing IPI2.18). PCAS, as most of the computational annotation effort, can thus be used as a discovery
platform. We are applying PCAS for novel protein function or novel protein family member discoveries (data not
shown).
