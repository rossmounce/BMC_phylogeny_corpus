Abstract
Background: Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae causes bacterial blight of rice (Oryza sativa L.), a
major disease that constrains production of this staple crop in many parts of the world. We report
here on the complete genome sequence of strain PXO99A and its comparison to two previously
sequenced strains, KACC10331 and MAFF311018, which are highly similar to one another.
Results: The PXO99A genome is a single circular chromosome of 5,240,075 bp, considerably
longer than the genomes of the other strains (4,941,439 bp and 4,940,217 bp, respectively), and it
contains 5083 protein-coding genes, including 87 not found in KACC10331 or MAFF311018.
PXO99A contains a greater number of virulence-associated transcription activator-like effector
genes and has at least ten major chromosomal rearrangements relative to KACC10331 and
MAFF311018. PXO99A contains numerous copies of diverse insertion sequence elements,
members of which are associated with 7 out of 10 of the major rearrangements. A rapidly-evolving
CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats) region contains evidence of
dozens of phage infections unique to the PXO99A lineage. PXO99A also contains a unique, nearperfect tandem repeat of 212 kilobases close to the replication terminus.
Conclusion: Our results provide striking evidence of genome plasticity and rapid evolution within
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The comparisons point to sources of genomic variation and
candidates for strain-specific adaptations of this pathogen that help to explain the extraordinary
diversity of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae genotypes and races that have been isolated from
around the world.

Background
Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae (Xoo), a member of
the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria, is a major
pathogen of rice (Oryza sativa L.). It enters rice leaves
through water pores or wounds and moves systemically
by invading the xylem, causing a disease known as bacterial blight [1]. Bacterial blight is the most serious bacterial
disease of rice, and in some areas, the most important of
any disease of rice, carrying the potential to reduce yields
by as much as 50% [2]. When Xoo infects at the seedling
stage, it causes a syndrome known as kresek, which can
lead to nearly complete crop loss [1]. Several factors that
contribute to fitness and virulence in Xoo have been identified (reviewed in [3]). However, as rice is a staple crop
for much of the world population, as well as a model for
cereal biology [4], a better understanding of pathogenesis
by Xoo remains a pressing goal both for control of bacterial blight and for fundamental understanding of bacterial-plant interactions.
Bacterial blight occurs in most rice growing areas of the
world, and Xoo isolates from within and across Africa,
India, Asia, and Australia show a great diversity of genotypes, based on polymorphism of transposable elements,
predominantly insertion sequences (IS), avirulence genes,
rep/box elements, and other markers [5]. Based on the
ability of strains to elicit resistance in particular host genotypes, several distinct races have been defined [2]. Rice is
one of our most ancient domesticated crops, and comprises more than 100,000 distinct varieties [6]. Twenty
nine bacterial blight resistance (R) genes (Xa1-Xa29) have

been identified to date [7]. The great diversity of strains
within Xoo undoubtedly reflects adaptation of the pathogen to the diversity of host genotypes as well as the diverse
environmental conditions in which rice is grown. From a
broader perspective, Xoo belongs to a diverse and highly
adapted genus that includes more than 20 plant-associated or plant pathogenic species. Each species may comprise one or more pathogenic varieties (pathovar; pv.),
which demonstrate distinct host plant specificity or
modes of infection. Collectively, different Xanthomonas
species and pathovars cause diseases in over 390 host
plant species [8].
Complete genome sequences have been published for two
strains of Xoo, MAFF311018 (MAFF), a Japanese race 1
strain also referred to as T7174 [9], and KACC10331
(KACC), a Korean race 1 isolate also known as KXO85
[10]. Comparative analysis of multiple Xoo genomes
promises insight into specific adaptations that allow different strains to maintain virulence in different types of
rice in different regions of the world. Of particular potential interest are adaptations involving extracellular components, and type III effectors, which have been
established as critical virulence factors in bacterial blight
or other plant bacterial diseases [3,11].
The genomes of MAFF and KACC overall are highly similar to one another in gene content and organization. We
report here the complete genome sequence of a third
strain of Xoo, PXO99A, which, as described below, is considerably more distant from either of these strains than

they are from each other. PXO99A is a 5-azacytidine-resistant derivative of PXO99, which was isolated in Los Baños
and classified as Philippine race 6 [10]. Genotypically,
however, PXO99 is more similar to isolates from South
Asia (Nepal and India) than to other Philippine isolates
[11]. In contrast to MAFF and KACC, PXO99A is virulent
toward a large number of rice varieties representing
diverse genetic sources of resistance, including the broadspectrum, recessive resistance gene xa5 [12]. The relatively
few resistance genes effective against PXO99A include the
recessive resistance gene xa13, which is ineffective against
MAFF and KACC, the recently characterized broad-spectrum resistance gene Xa27, and the pattern recognition
receptor-like resistance gene Xa21, which is effective
against MAFF but not against KACC [15-17]. Because of its
amenability to genetic analysis, and its relatively broad
cultivar specificity, PXO99A has been the focus of numerous studies of the molecular basis of bacterial blight and
blight resistance.

Results
The PXO99A genome
The PXO99A genome is a single circular chromosome of
5,240,075 bp with an overall GC content of 63.6%. It contains 5083 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA operons, and 55 tRNAs (Table 1). The origin of replication was
identified by similarity to other Xanthomonas genomes, by
proximity to genes (dnaA, dnaN, and gyrB) often found
near the origin on bacterial genomes, and by GC-skew
analysis, which examines the excess of G versus C on the
leading strand [13]. A schematic representation of the
genome is provided in Figure 1.

rooted with Xylella fastidiosa (Temecula strain) (data not
shown).
Genes unique to PXO99A relative to MAFF
Of the 5083 annotated protein coding genes in PXO99A,
4910 have clear homologs in the MAFF strain. These genes
map to just 4234 genes in MAFF (out of 4372 total), indicating a considerable expansion of some gene families.
194 of the shared genes are present in a 212 kb direct
repeat near the replication terminus (see below). Of the
remaining 173 PXO99-specific genes, 29 (including 18
tranposases) are missing from MAFF because they span
breakpoints; i.e., a rearrangement, insertion, or deletion
in MAFF has broken these genes into fragments. Fifty eight
other PXO99A genes only partially align to MAFF, including 29 transposases. Finally, 86 genes in PXO99A are completely absent (based on sequence alignment) from
MAFF.

Among the 138 annotated genes in the MAFF strain that
are not present in PXO99A, 20 are missing in PXO99A
because they span breakpoints, and 38 (including 12
transposases) are missing because they are truncated in
PXO99A. The remaining 80 genes in MAFF are entirely
missing from PXO99A.
Additional file 2 contains the lists of genes unique to
PXO99A and unique to MAFF. It is noteworthy that a
majority of the genes unique to MAFF (64/80) are hypothetical proteins, which may represent annotation artifacts. These hypothetical genes have an average length of
182 bp, compared to 850 bp for an average gene. Of the
87 genes unique to PXO99A, twenty are hypothetical
while the remainder comprises genes similar to predicted
genes in other strains and species.
IS elements
All sequenced Xanthomonas genomes contain numerous
IS elements, but the Xoo genomes contain the most
diverse pool [15]. Of the 19 known families of IS elements
[16], eight families composed of 28 distinct elements
appear in Xoo. MAFF and KACC have nearly identical
numbers of IS elements (Table 1), while PXO99A contains
fewer elements overall, but more copies of ISXo8, IS1114/
ISXoo4, and ISXo2.
A genomic region encoding several non-fimbrial adhesin
genes
Sequences unique to PXO99A relative to MAFF include a
38,766 bp region (coordinates 4788763 – 4827529) that
contains several predicted non-fimbrial adhesin genes
(Figure 2). Of 20 genes at this locus, three (fhaB, fhaX and
fhaB1) encode non-fimbrial adhesin related proteins and
a fourth (fhaC) is predicted to help in transport of nonfimbrial adhesins. The fhaB gene, which encodes the long-

repeats that are likely to serve in adhesion and autoaggregation. Two more genes (ORFs 2986 and 2987) are predicted to be involved in bacteriocin secretion while
another (ORF 2973) encodes an ice-nucleation protein
homolog. The locus also includes several IS elements and

is flanked by direct repeats of ISXo5. These are in turn
flanked by genes for a dual specificity phosphatase (DSP
in Figure 2) and a DNA binding protein (DBP). In contrast, only one copy of the ISXo5 element is present
between DSP and DBP in MAFF and KACC, indicating
that the IsXo5 element was involved in the genomic rearrangement that led either to loss of the locus from MAFF

and KACC or gain of the locus in PXO99A. The former is
likely the case because the arrangement in PXO99A is
present also in X. oryzae pv. oryzicola BLS256 (data not
shown).
Specific primers were developed for the DSP and DBP
genes that flank this locus as well as for the fhaB, fhaC, and
fhaX genes. Using PXO99A genomic DNA as a template,
we amplified the expected PCR products for all five genes
(data not shown). Using either MAFF 311018 or KACC
10331 genomic DNA as template, products of the
expected size were obtained with primers specific to the
DBP and DSP encoding genes, but no products were
obtained with primers specific for fhaC, fhaB or fhaX. Also,
a fragment of the expected size (~2.5 kb) was obtained via
PCR with DBP- and DSP-specific primers using MAFF and
KACC genomic DNA, but not with PXO99A genomic DNA
(data not shown). These results provide additional evidence that the non-fimbrial adhesin genes are indeed
missing from the MAFF and KACC genomes. Based on
PCR analysis using the above primers, the fhaC, fhaB and
fhaX genes are also missing from the Indian Xoo strain
BXO43, and in another Indian strain, BXO8, only fhaB

appears to be present. However, all three genes were
detected in the strain Nepal624 (data not shown), a result
consistent with the close relationship, as established by
DNA fingerprinting studies, between PXO99A and Xoo
strains from Nepal [17].
Recent large duplication
The PXO99A strain contains a near-perfect tandem duplication of 212,087 bp. This unusually large repeat spans
the intervals 2,502,622–2,714,708 and 2,714,709–
2,926,795. The repeat is flanked by an insertion (1073
bp) of ISXo5 (Figure 5) at each end and between the two
copies. Except for a single base difference in one IS copy,
the two regions are 100% identical. Because the flanking
ISXo5 is longer than a read, and because the repeat is
much too long to be spanned by any pair of sequencing
reads, the original assembly had collapsed these two
repeats into a single region. Also, the positioning of the
flanking short repeats meant that every sequence fit accurately into the collapsed assembly, with only the pairedend information indicating a problem. This collapse was
discovered through the use of the Hawkeye assembly diagnostics tool, which identified a large set of mis-oriented

Page 5 of 16

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:204

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/204

paired-end sequences on either end of the collapsed version of the assembly [18]. In order to provide additional
validation of this duplication, we designed primers on
either side of the unique junction where the two copies of
the tandem repeat meet (see Additional file 2). We verified the presence of the junction by PCR amplification
and re-sequencing of this region.
The 212 kb segment occurs once in the MAFF and KACC
sequences. One question is whether the difficulty of
assembling this region might mean that it is present in
these strains, but undetected. Evidence that the duplication is indeed unique to PXO99A is the sequence divergence (~0.3%) of PXO99A from MAFF/KACC. This
divergence implies that if the duplication had happened
in a common ancestor, then the two distinct 212 kb
regions, which would have existed since the divergence
between strains, would be expected to have over 600 single-base differences. The fact that the copies have only one
difference confirms that the large duplication in PXO99A
occurred much more recently than its divergence from
MAFF and KACC.
TAL effector genes
A hallmark of the Xoo genome is the large number of transcription activator-like (TAL) type III effector genes, which
are defined by their relatedness to the type members
avrBs3 and pthA [24-26]. TAL effector genes are characterized in part by a region of 102 bp repeats, or more rarely
105 bp repeats, within the central coding portion [27,28].
Nineteen TAL effector genes were identified in the
PXO99A genome (Table 2 and Figure 3), including four

previously associated with virulence and avirulence phenotypes and effector-specific gene expression in rice
[16,29,30]. One of these, pthXo1, encodes the major virulence determinant for PXO99A whose function is disrupted in rice by the recessive blight resistance gene xa13
[29,30]. The TAL effector genes are located in nine loci distributed in the genome. Two loci consist of single genes,
six consist of two genes oriented in the same direction,
and one is a previously identified cluster of five genes all
oriented in the same direction [19]. Each of the genes
within a cluster is preceded by a region of 990 bp that contains two or more short, predicted ORFs but is more likely
non-coding DNA, suggesting that each gene has its own
promoter, and that the clusters do not represent polycistronic operons. We have designated the genes numerically
according to the locus in which they reside, sequentially
from the origin of replication, and alphabetically, according to their position in that locus starting at the 5' end of
the locus. Thus, the first TAL effector gene in the genome
sequence, proximal to the origin, is tal1, the second
(which is the second gene in a locus oriented toward the
origin) tal2b, etc. The genes with known phenotypes are
distributed in separate loci: tal1 is pthXo7, tal2b is pthXo1,
tal5b is pthXo6, and tal9c is avrXa27. Among the genes, the
number of repeat units varies from 12.5 (tal9d) to 26.5
(tal9c). None of the genes contains the rare 105 bp repeat.
Gene pairs in loci 7 and 8 are identical copies in the 212
kb duplicated regions of the genome.

Figure 5 and rearrangements in PXO99A compared to MAFF
Inversions
Inversions and rearrangements in PXO99A compared to MAFF. The alignment shows regions of PXO99A that align to
the same (red) or opposite (blue) strand of MAFF. Transposase genes and their orientation (+ or -) are shown at the sites of
each rearrangement. Letters A-J indicate specific rearrangement events. A: the IS element ISXoo3 is composed of two distinct
and independently conserved ORFs and is responsible for an inversion spanning coordinates 267869–5114959 (all coordinates
refer to the PXO99A genome). B: ISXo8 occurs in opposite orientation at each end of a 2.6 Mbp inversion spanning positions
1356757–3898472. C: ISXo1 occurs in inverted copies at the endpoints of a 1.8 Mbp inversion spanning 1558996–3391786. D:
a 33270 bp inverted region spanning 4394742–4428012 is flanked by oppositely-oriented copies of ISXo8. E: Each copy of the
212-kb duplication is flanked by ISXo5, which also occurs adjacent to two other translocations in this region. The duplication
appears as two parallel diagonal lines in this box. F: ISXo8 also occurs in inverted copies at the boundaries of a 47540 bp segment that is translocated from approximately 4800000 to 685272. G: ISXoo3 flanks both ends of a 47540 bp translocation
from approximately 1117000 to 4339239. H: A 9,862 bp region occurs in inverted copies at 217,455 and 4,305,307.
MAFF311018 contains only one copy of this region. I,J: Segments spanning 96,753 bp (I) and 17,021 bp (J) are inverted with
respect to MAFF311018 but not associated with transposases.

Comparison of the TAL effector gene content and arrangement in PXO99A with those in MAFF, using the scheme
described above to name the MAFF genes (genes in the
two strains are hereafter distinguished by subscript), indicates that the number of loci and relative positions are
similar with the exception of the duplicated loci (7 and 8)
in PXO99A, as well as PXO99A locus 4 and MAFF locus 3,
which occupy unique relative positions in their respective
genomes (Figure 3). MAFF loci 2 and 3 were considered by

Ochiai et al. [9] as one locus, but we treat them as distinct
based on the unusual distance (roughly 3 kb instead of
the usual 990 bp) between the locus 3 gene and the closest
locus 2 gene, and the presence of IS elements flanking
locus 3. Despite the similarity in number and arrangement of the respective loci, only three PXO99A TAL effector genes, all in PXO99A locus 9, have counterparts in
MAFF that are identical with respect to the number of
repeats and the twelfth and thirteenth codons of the cen-

tral repeat domain. The identical genes are tal9cPXO99A and
tal1cMAFF, tal9dPXO99A and tal1dMAFF, and tal9ePXO99A and
tal3MAFF. Genes tal9aPXO99A and tal9bPXO99A correspond in
repeat number to tal1aMAFF and tal1bMAFF, respectively. The
tal3MAFF gene, which represents a break in the apparent
overall synteny between PXO99A locus 9 and MAFF locus
1, is flanked by IS elements. The tal9cPXO99A gene is the
avirulence determinant avrXa27, and its identity with
tal1cMAFF is consistent with the effectiveness of the corresponding host resistance gene Xa27 against both PXO99A
and MAFF, as well as a broad range of other strains [20].
Two other PXO99A TAL effector genes have counterparts
in MAFF that are nearly identical with respect to the
number of repeats and the predicted twelfth and thirteenth residues in each repeat: tal4PXO99A has the same
structure as tal4aMAFF except for residue 12 in the fifteenth
repeat, and tal6aPXO99A has the same structure as tal5aMAFF
except for residues 12 and 13 in the fourteenth repeat.
MAFF has two TAL effector genes, pthXo2 (tal8MAFF) and
avrXa7 (tal7dMAFF), that are major virulence determinants
[21]. The pthXo2 gene occupies the same locus in MAFF
that pthXo7 does in PXO99A, while avrXa7 occupies the
same locus as pthXo1, the major virulence determinant for
PXO99A. Some corresponding loci differ in their gene
content. For example, locus 2 in PXO99A consists of two
genes but the corresponding locus in MAFF, locus 7, contains four. Absent from MAFF locus 5 is pthXo6, although
previous evidence indicates that OsTFX1, a host gene
expressed in a pthXo6-dependent manner, is induced
upon infection with MAFF [32]. Induction could be due to
one of the other TAL effectors, or pthXo6 might have been
misassembled in the MAFF sequence. Locus 6 in PXO99A
corresponds to locus 4 in MAFF, but locus 4 in MAFF contains the gene nearly identical to tal4PXO99A in the uniquely
positioned locus 4 of PXO99A. The MAFF gene nearly
identical to tal6aPXO99A, is located in a corresponding
neighboring locus, MAFF locus 5. Locus 3 in PXO99A and
6 in MAFF contain two and one defective TAL effector
genes, respectively. All three of these genes have identical
repeat domains. Moreover, tal6MAFF shares with the
PXO99A genes the 3' deletions of 43 and 15 codons discussed above, as well as a six-codon deletion in the repeat
region (repeat 4 of tal6MAFF, repeat 3 of tal3aPXO99A, and
repeat 4 of tal3bPXO99A), indicating that these genes may
represent a generally defunct locus in Xoo. The observed
substitution of genes at conserved loci across the
genomes, expansion or contraction of individual loci in a
given strain, and divergence or degeneration of gene
sequences at shared loci are presumably accomplished by
the exchange of coding sequences through homologous
recombination. Transposition of genes involving IS element-mediated recombination may also occur, as exemplified possibly by tal3MAFF.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/204

Genome rearrangements in Xoo
The PXO99A strain of Xoo has experienced at least ten
major rearrangements with respect to the MAFF strain,
resulting in 29 distinct syntenic blocks, as shown in Figure
5. The majority of these rearrangements are symmetric
about the origin of replication, as has been observed for
many other bacterial rearrangements [22]. Most of these
rearrangements appear to be mediated by a diverse set of
transposable elements. Some elements, such as ISXo5,
ISXo8, and IS1389/ISXoo3, are responsible for multiple
rearrangements. For example, ISXo5 occurs near each endpoint of both copies of the 212,087 bp tandem repeat
(region E, Figure 5). Within each copy of the repeat there
is a 116,872 bp inversion flanked by inverted copies of
ISXo5. Only three major rearrangement events (H, I, and
J in Figure 5) do not seem to be associated with IS elements.
Evolution of the CRISPR region in Xoo lineages
The PXO99A, MAFF, and KACC genomes each contain a
CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats) element. CRISPRs are identified by a set of
Cas genes, followed by a leader sequence and then a variable number of alternating spacers and repeats; the elements here represent the Dvulg subtype [23]. The repeats
are identical, while the spacers represent foreign DNA that
was laterally transferred from a bacteriophage or a plasmid [24]. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that
the spacers, acquired during phage infection, provide
immune protection for the bacterium against the phage
[25]. Thus CRISPRs represent an inheritable immune system for bacteria.

Because the CRISPR region evolves very rapidly, it provides one of the most striking records of differentiation
among PXO99A, MAFF, and KACC. As shown in Figure 6,
PXO99A has the largest CRISPR region of the three strains,
with 75 spacer elements. In contrast, MAFF and KACC
contain just 48 and 59 spacers respectively, implying that
PXO99A has acquired a substantially greater resistance to
phage infections than its cousins. Also worth noting is
that the majority of the spacers are unique to each strain,
attesting to the rapid evolution of these regions.
The alignment of the CRISPR spacers in the three Xoo
strains (Figure 6) appears on first inspection to contradict
the phylogenetic relationship of the strains, in that MAFF
appears more distant from the other two strains. Spacers
are inserted into a genome in chronological order, with
new elements appearing next to the 188-bp leader
sequence, which gives a clear picture of the shared history
of these elements. Our alignment shows that all three
strains share five of the oldest elements (S1–S5 in
PXO99A), but that all of the more recent elements in
MAFF are unique to that strain. PXO99A and KACC share

the very oldest element, which has been lost in MAFF, as
well as 10 additional older spacer elements in conserved
order. These 10 spacers range from S6–S25 in PXO99A and
S8–S30 in MAFF (intervening elements are unique in each
strain), indicating that these two strains diverged after the
acquisition of spacer S25/S30. MAFF, in contrast, shares
no spacers more recent than S5 with either of the other
two strains. This appears to contradict whole-genome
phylogenetic evidence and large-scale genome structure,
both of which indicate that MAFF and KACC are much
closer to one another than either is to PXO99A. A likely
alternative explanation, given the hypervariable nature of
CRISPRs, is that MAFF lost these older spacers.
Validation of the MAFF assembly
To validate the large-scale rearrangements between strains
PXO99A and MAFF, we obtained a library of 9 kb shotgun
clones for MAFF and identified those clones that correspond to breakpoints shown in Figure 5. Two clones for
each breakpoint were selected, except in one case where
only one clone could be identified. These clones were endsequenced and the ends compared to the MAFF genome.
In addition, restriction enzyme analysis was performed
for each of the shotgun clones.

In all cases, the analysis of the MAFF sequences confirmed
that the MAFF genome is correctly assembled. Had there
been any mis-assemblies, the clones would have shown

significant length polymorphisms or would have mapped
to inconsistent positions on the finished sequence. This
evidence further strengthens the conclusion that breakpoints in the genome alignment between MAFF and
PXO99A represent genuine differences between the
genomes. Because the MAFF and KACC strains have
almost the same overall genome architecture, with very
few rearrangements, we did not attempt separate verification of the KACC assembly.
Separately, we identified 18 significant insertions and
deletions between MAFF and PXO99A. We generated PCR
primers to test for the presence or absence of each insertion, and amplified fragments from genomic DNA using
both strains. In all cases the PCR tests verified the presence
of the insertion in one strain and its absence in the other
(data not shown).
Regions of lateral gene transfer
GC-content frequently used for identifying regions of a
genome with unusual composition, as might result from
lateral gene transfer. PXO99A has a GC-content of 63.6%,
ranging from a high of 71.8% to a low of 41.6%. A more
sensitive measure of unusual composition, used in many
previous studies [36] is based on trinucleotide composition. For this measure, we compute the X2 statistic to compare the trinucleotide distribution in fixed-size windows
to the overall trinucleotide distribution for the genome.

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:204

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/204

Regions highlighted by this statistic are either caused by
lateral gene transfer or else under very strong evolutionary
constraints to maintain their atypical DNA composition.
A plot of the X2 statistic as well as GC-content across the
genome is shown in Figure 7.

K96243 [37] and Erythobacter litoralis are annotated as
acquired from bacteriophage, and a direct phage homolog
occurs in Burkholderia phage phiE202. A phylogenetic
tree of all homologs (data not shown) supports the conclusion that this gene was laterally transferred via a phage.

The figure shows multiple regions of highly unusual composition, which we then investigated further. The largest
peak in the X2 distribution, at position 918,000, is centered on a 424-aa protein (ORF04252) containing a lysin
domain (often found in enzymes involved in bacterial cell
wall degradation) but whose function is otherwise
unknown. There is strong evidence that this gene has been
laterally transferred via a bacteriophage: it is not found in
any other Xanthomonads, and the closest matches are in
Burkholderia, Campylobacter, and Shewanella, all very
distantly related genera. Homologs in both B. pseudomallei

The second-highest peak in Figure 7 is in the midst of a
broader region of unusual composition, extending from
3,540,900 to 3,571,800. This region contains a large
prophage element with 41 phage-related genes, extending
from ORF01364 (a phage portal protein, pbsx family) to
ORF01326 (a site-specific recombinase, phage integrase
family). PXO99A contains a second, smaller prophage element spanning six genes from 2366221–2371236.
All 19 of the TAL effector genes show an unusual composition and correspond to peaks in Figure 7. Because the

TAL effectors are adjacent to transposases, they too might
have originated in another species, possibly as a singlecopy gene that later expanded in number in Xoo or a progenitor. Conservation of the unusual composition in all
members of the family might also reflect strong functional
constraints.
Hypothetical proteins
A significant fraction of predicted genes in most bacterial
genomes are annotated as hypothetical proteins. These
open reading frames (ORFs) are predicted computationally, but because they lack sequence homology to other
species, they cannot be assigned a name. An unknown
number of these predicted genes are likely to be false predictions, and for most genomes there has been little basis
for distinguishing true genes at the time of sequencing.
For PXO99A, we took advantage of the related MAFF and
KACC genomes to improve upon the usual set of hypothetical predicted genes. Multiple sequence alignments
among several closely-related species often reveal that the
ORFs of hypothetical proteins are not maintained in sister
species; i.e., they contain in-frame stop codons. Although
it is possible that these interrupted ORFs are functional in
only one of the species, a more parsimonious explanation
is simply that the original gene prediction was wrong. This
strategy has been used, for example, to identify several
hundred incorrectly annotated genes in S. cerevisiae [38],
using three related yeast genomes.

We aligned the DNA sequences for all 1273 hypothetical
proteins in PXO99A to the corresponding sequences in
MAFF, KACC, X. axonopodis pv. citri, X. campestris pv. campestris, and X. campestris pv. vesicatoria. From these alignments, we identified all predicted PXO99A genes with
premature stop codons or crippling frameshift mutations
in any other species. From these data, we identified 78
ORFs with multiple lines of evidence that they did not
represent true genes; these predicted genes were deleted
from the annotation.

Discussion
Nearly 30 distinct bacterial blight resistance genes from
different rice varieties and wild relatives have been identified and many have been used in breeding programs for
disease control [7], but in several instances, resistance has
broken down as new, virulent strains of Xoo have
emerged [12,39,40]. Understanding mechanisms that
account for the rapid emergence of new pathogen genotypes, and identifying Xoo genes involved in pathogenic
adaptation are important goals toward developing durable disease control strategies. The complete genome
sequence of strain PXO99A and its comparison to two previously
sequenced
strains,
KACC10331
and
MAFF311018, that we have presented here, provide new
insights that advance these goals.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/204

Because MAFF and KACC are highly similar in genome
content and organization, our comparative analysis
focused largely on PXO99A and MAFF. This analysis
revealed a remarkable plasticity of the Xoo genome. This
plasticity is most strikingly evident in the large number of
major rearrangements and indels between these strains.
On a smaller scale, differences are prevalent in the inventories of TAL effector genes in PXO99A and MAFF. Also, a
number of indels exist that represent genes shared by both
strains but present in higher copy in PXO99A, including
several IS elements. All of these differences suggest that
the Xoo genome evolves rapidly. This conclusion is perhaps best supported however by the 212 kb sequence
duplication in PXO99A that we discovered using a new
and powerful application, the Hawkeye assembly diagnostics tool, and which we confirmed by PCR amplification of the repeat junction. The duplication represents a
remarkably recent event, with only a single nucleotide difference differentiating between the two copies in PXO99A.
Gene duplication contributes to gene diversification,
allowing for unconstrained evolution of otherwise indispensable sequences. The abundance of duplications in
PXO99A suggests that they are an important source of
genomic variation for Xoo. As made clear by analysis of
the 212 kb repeat, IS elements play an important role in
generating duplications. And they clearly can generate
other types of genome modifications as well, including
rearrangements and inversions, and insertions or deletions that can lead to acquisition, modification, or loss of
gene content [15]. Indeed, 7 out of 10 of the major rearrangements in the PXO99A genome relative to MAFF are
associated with IS elements. The presence of ISXo5 at both
ends of the 38.8 kb locus containing the non-fimbrial
adhesin-like genes in PXO99A, compared with its presence
in single copy in place of this locus in MAFF and KACC
provides a patent example of an IS mediated genome
modification that resulted either in an excision (from the
MAFF and KACC lineage), or an integration of DNA (in
the PXO99A lineage). Our analysis highlights also an
important role for phage as a source of genomic variation
for Xoo. The PXO99A sequence revealed numerous differences from MAFF related to phage integration, including
the presence of genes that clearly originated in distantly
related organisms. Yet another template for genome modification, and a particularly interesting characteristic of the
Xoo genomes, are the TAL effector genes. As virulence factors and triggers of host resistance, differences in TAL
effector gene content have been associated for some time
with phenotypic diversity. Comparison of MAFF and
PXO99A provided clear evidence of the involvement of
homologous recombination among these genes in generating differences in their structure and copy number at
genomic locations that were otherwise conserved, indicat-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:204

ing that the sequences themselves play a major role in
generating that diversity.
Included among the 19 TAL effector genes in PXO99A are
pthXo1, a major virulence determinant not present in
other strains [26] and avrXa27, a cultivar specificity determinant [19]. There is evidence also that the TAL effector
gene pthXo7 is important in the virulence of PXO99A on
plants containing the recessive resistance gene xa5
[14,32]. Significantly, xa5 is prevalent among the AusBoro lines of rice, which originated in Nepal and Bangladesh, the geographical region that likely gave rise to
PXO99 [11]. These and other observations firmly establish a role for TAL effector genes in strain-specific adaptation. The differences in TAL effector gene content and
structure between the geographically distinct strains
PXO99A and MAFF further underscore this role, and the
importance of understanding the diversity of TAL effector
functions.
The non-fimbrial adhesin-like genes fhaB, fhaB1, and fhaX
and the transport gene fhaC we discovered at the 38.8 kb
locus in PXO99A that is missing in MAFF and KACC are
additional intriguing candidates for adaptations to certain
host genotypes or environmental conditions. Homologs
of fhaB and fhaC are present in a number of plant and animal pathogenic bacteria [11]. MAFF and KACC encode
other non-fimbrial adhesins, which are also present and
highly conserved in PXO99A. Thus, it seems likely that the
fha genes are not essential pathogenicity factors in
PXO99A. However, mutational analysis might reveal a
quantitative effect on virulence, or a differential effect in
certain rice varieties or under different temperatures.
Other proteins encoded at the locus that are of interest
from the perspective of host-pathogen interactions
include a putative ice nucleation protein and a putative
colicin with an associated transporter protein.
Complete genome sequences are available for a number
of members of other Xanthomonas species, including X.
campestris pv. campestris, the causal agent of black rot in
crucifers, X. axonopodis pv. citri, which causes citrus canker, and X. campestris pv. vesicatoria, which is responsible
for bacterial spot in tomato and pepper plants. Whole
genome alignments revealed several inversions, indels,
and rearrangements in these genomes relative to one
another. Thus the genus as a whole shows a high degree of
genomic variation. Even in this context however, the differences uncovered here in structure and content of the
PXO99A versus the MAFF and KACC genomes are striking.
Notably, Xoo strains contain the greatest number and
diversity of IS elements of all the sequenced xanthomonads, and the size of the CRISPRs in the strains discussed
here suggests a long history of interaction with phage. X.
oryzae strains are also unusual in their abundance of TAL

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/204

effector genes. None of the other sequenced Xanthomonas
strains have more than four TAL effector genes, and some
have none. Though a comprehensive survey has not been
done, large numbers of TAL effector genes are only known
to exist elsewhere in strains of X. campestris pv. malvacearum, a pathogen of another ancient and genetically
diverse domesticated crop plant, cotton [27], and, curiously, in Xanthomonas strains that infect mango [28]. It is
tempting to speculate for X. oryzae that the diversification
of its host through millennia of cultivation around the
world favored an amplification of elements in the pathogen that confer genome plasticity and adaptability,
including IS elements, phage, and the repeat-dominated
TAL effector genes.
It is interesting that in contrast to the East Asian MAFF and
KACC strains, the ancestry of PXO99A is likely centered in
South Asia [11], one of at least three probable sites of
domestication of rice [6]. As described here, PXO99A has
a larger genome and a greater number of strain-specific
genes than its close relatives MAFF and KACC. This greater
size and complexity may be a consequence of this strain
having derived from a lineage that evolved near a center of
origin for its host, which would be expected to have a
greater diversity of host genotypes than other locations.

Conclusion
The genome sequence of PXO99A and its comparison to
those of strains MAFF and KACC provide direct evidence
that the Xoo genome is highly plastic and rapidly evolving. Our analysis has revealed sources of genomic variation and identified candidates for strain-specific
adaptations of this pathogen. These findings help to
explain the extraordinary diversity of Xoo genotypes and
races that have been isolated from around the world
[9,10,12,13] and even from within a particular country or
region. Our study also has highlighted particular classes of
genes as important targets for functional analysis toward
development of better, broader-spectrum and more durable control measures.

Methods
Sequencing
Bacterial genomic DNA was randomly sheared by nebulization, end-repaired with consecutive BAL31 nuclease
and T4 DNA polymerase treatments, and size-selected
using gel electrophoresis on 1% low-melting-point agarose. After ligation to BstXI adapters, DNA was purified by
three rounds of gel electrophoresis to remove excess
adapters, and the fragments were ligated into the vector
pHOS2 (a modified pBR322 vector) linearized with BstXI.
The pHOS2 plasmid contains two BstXI cloning sites
immediately flanked by sequencing primer binding sites.
These features reduce the frequency of non-recombinant
clones, and reduce the amount of vector sequences at the

end of the reads. Two libraries with average insert size of
4.5 kb and 10 kb were constructed. The ligation reactions
were electroporated into E. coli. Clones were plated onto
large format (16 × 16 cm) diffusion plates prepared by
layering 150 ml of fresh antibiotic-free agar onto a previously set 50-ml layer of agar containing antibiotic. Colonies were picked for template preparation, inoculated into
384-well blocks containing liquid media, and incubated
overnight with shaking. High-purity plasmid DNA was
prepared using the DNA purification robotic workstation
custom-built by Thermo CRS (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Inc.) and based on the alkaline lysis miniprep [29] and
isopropanol precipitation. DNA precipitate was washed
with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 10 mM Tris
HCl buffer containing a trace of blue dextran. The yield of
plasmid DNA was approximately 600–800 ng per clone,
providing sufficient DNA for at least four sequencing reactions per template. Sequencing was done using di-deoxy
sequencing method [30]. Two 384-well cycle-sequencing
reaction plates were prepared from each plate of plasmid
template DNA for opposite-end, paired-sequence reads.
Sequencing reactions were completed using the Big Dye
Terminator chemistry and standard M13 forward and
reverse primers. Reaction mixtures, thermal cycling profiles, and electrophoresis conditions were optimized to
reduce the volume of the Big Dye Terminator mix and to
extend read lengths on the AB3730xl sequencers (Applied
Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were set up by the
Biomek FX pipetting workstations. Robots were used to
aliquot and combine templates with reaction mixes consisting of deoxy- and fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides, DNA polymerase, sequencing primers, and
reaction buffer in a 5 μl volume. After 30–40 consecutive
cycles of amplification, reaction products were precipitated by isopropanol, dried at room temperature, resuspended in water, and transferred to an AB3730xl
sequencer. 8,700 and 52,100 high-quality reads from the
4.5 kb and 10 kb insert libraries, respectively, were generated with an average trimmed sequence read length of 821
bp and a success rate of 93%. After initial assembly, gaps
were closed by primer walking on plasmid templates,
sequencing genomic PCR products that spanned the gaps,
and by transposon insertion and sequencing of selected
10 kb shotgun clones.
Assembly and annotation
Multiple rounds of assembly were performed, beginning
with the shotgun reads and later including additional finishing reads. In the final assembly, 65,620 reads were
trimmed to remove vector and low-quality sequence, and
then assembled using Celera Assembler. The large (212
kb) tandem repeat was initially collapsed into one copy,
which had twice the depth of coverage of the rest of the
genome. This anomaly was detected and corrected to two
copies after analysis aided by the Hawkeye assembly diag-

nosis software [18]. Protein-coding genes were identified
using Glimmer 3.0, which includes an algorithm to identify ribosome binding sites for each gene. Transcription
terminators were predicted using TransTermHP [31] with
parameter settings expected to yield over 90% accuracy.
Transfer RNAs were identified with tRNAScanSE [32].
Regions with neither Glimmer predictions nor RNA genes
were searched in all six frames using blastx [33] to identify
any missed proteins, and all annotations were manually
curated as described previously [34], using the Manatee
online annotation system [35]. The origin and terminus
of replication was determined using GC-skew analysis
[13], which indicates an origin near position 50 kb and
termini near 2,370 kb or 2,510 kb. The chromosome replication initiator gene dnaA, which is commonly found
near the origin, is at position 45. Oligomer skew analysis
[36], which identifies 8-mers preferentially located on the
leading strand, indicates an origin at 4,895 kb (30 kb from
the end of the genome) and a terminus at 2,381 kb, based
on multiple 8-mers including CCCTGCCC and AGGACCAT. These 8-mers occur 328/376 and 218/248 times
(over 87%) on the leading strand; for CCCTGCCC the
likelihood that this occurred by chance is 3.6x10-45. To
determine genome rearrangements, the MUMmer/Nucmer suite of genome alignment programs [37] was used to
align Xoo PXO99A to the MAFF and KACC strains as well
as to all other Xanthomonas genomes.
PCR amplification of genes at the non-fimbrial adhesin
encoding locus
Genomic DNA was isolated from PXO99A, BXO8,
Nepal624, KACC10331 and MAFF311018 strains according to the procedure described by Leach et. al. [38]. PCR
was performed using a set of gene specific primers listed
in Additional file 2.
Genome data
The PXO99A complete, annotated genome has been
deposited in Genbank under accession number
CP000967. The traces have been deposited in the NCBI
Trace Archive [39] and the complete assembly is in the
NCBI Assembly Archive [40].
