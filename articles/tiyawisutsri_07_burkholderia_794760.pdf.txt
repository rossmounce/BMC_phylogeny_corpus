Abstract
Background: The bacterial biothreat agents Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei are
the cause of glanders and melioidosis, respectively. Genomic and epidemiological studies have
shown that B. mallei is a recently emerged, host restricted clone of B. pseudomallei.
Results: Using bacteriophage-mediated immunoscreening we identified genes expressed in vivo
during experimental equine glanders infection. A family of immunodominant antigens were
identified that share protein domain architectures with hemagglutinins and invasins. These have
been designated Burkholderia Hep_Hag autotransporter (BuHA) proteins. A total of 110/207
positive clones (53%) of a B. mallei expression library screened with sera from two infected horses
belonged to this family. This contrasted with 6/189 positive clones (3%) of a B. pseudomallei
expression library screened with serum from 21 patients with culture-proven melioidosis.
Conclusion: Members of the BuHA proteins are found in other Gram-negative bacteria and have
been shown to have important roles related to virulence. Compared with other bacterial species,
the genomes of both B. mallei and B. pseudomallei contain a relative abundance of this family of
proteins. The domain structures of these proteins suggest that they function as multimeric surface
proteins that modulate interactions of the cell with the host and environment. Their effect on the
cellular immune response to B. mallei and their potential as diagnostics for glanders requires further
study.

Background
Burkholderia mallei is the causative agent of glanders, a
serious Gram-negative infection that predominantly
affects horses and other equines [1]. Natural B. mallei
infection has largely been eradicated and human infection
is extremely rare, but renewed interest in this organism
parallels its classification as a category B biothreat agent.
There is a need to develop an effective vaccine for individuals at risk of exposure from deliberate release, and understanding the immune response elicited during infection
with B. mallei is central to this process. The relative importance of cellular versus humoral responses in the development of protective immunity against B. mallei is under
investigation. Experimental evidence indicates that both
play a role, but that stimulation of a Th1-like immune
response may be important for protection [2-5]. One
study of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against
B. mallei administered to mice prior to a lethal aerosol
challenge reported non-sterilizing protection [6]. Passive
protection in the mouse model has also been described
for the highly related B. pseudomallei using murine mAbs
specific for B. pseudomallei polysaccharide [7].
The development of improved diagnostic tests for the
diagnosis of glanders is also a necessity. PCR has been
described for the detection of B. mallei during acute presentation [8-10], but the antibody response to infection is
poorly understood and there are no serological tests currently recommended for the diagnosis of glanders in
patients who have been partially or fully treated and in
whom B. mallei is not detectable. Humoral immune
response profiling to infection is a logical approach to the
evaluation of immunogenic antigens, and has the ability
to define novel targets for both diagnostics and vaccines.
Profiling using proteome microarrays has been described
for a vaccinia virus proteome consisting of 185 individual
viral proteins and used to determine Ab profiles in serum
from vaccinia virus-immunized humans, primates, and
mice [11]. This technology has not been described in the
literature to date for antibody profiling in response to
infection with B. mallei or B. pseudomallei, although
polysaccharide microarray technology has been described
for the detection of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei antibodies to capsular antibodies [12]. An alternative strategy for
immunoscreening is the use of a bacteriophage expression
library. This has recently been used to detect in vivo
expressed antigens of Staphylococcus aureus and to utilize
this information to develop a vaccine to protect against
experimental nasal carriage [13]. Although complex molecules such as LPS will not be represented, this technique
offers an immediately available, rapid and simple means
of identifying and testing putative candidate vaccines and
targets for serological diagnostic tests. We have applied
bacteriophage-mediated immunoscreening to identify
antibody responses to in vivo expressed genes during

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/19

experimental equine glanders infection, and have compared this with those elicited during human melioidosis.

Results
B. mallei expression library screening with glanders serum
The B. mallei expression library was individually probed
with sera from two experimentally infected horses taken
seven days after intra-tracheal bacterial inoculation with
B. mallei ATCC 23344. This equine glanders model has
been described previously [14]. Positive plaques were
picked and purified by additional rounds of screening. A
total of 207 positive clones were identified and partially
sequenced. These corresponded to 71 different loci (comprising a contiguous DNA region from single or overlapping clones) containing 228 known or putative protein
coding sequences (CDSs) of B. mallei. Additional file 1
provides full details of the B. mallei antigens recognized by
one or both of the infected horse sera. The distribution of
loci was not equal between the two chromosomes; 50 loci
were present on chromosome 1, and 21 loci were present
on chromosome 2 in B. mallei ATCC 23344.

The specificity of these results for experimental glanders
infection as opposed to the presence of pre-existing cross
reactive antibodies to other bacterial species was tested by
screening serum taken from one healthy experimental
horse prior to infection with B. mallei. A total of 20 screenings failed to reveal any positive plaques (data not
shown). This strongly suggests that the antibodies
detected in sera from the two infected horses are specific
to the experimental B. mallei infection.
Four loci were highly over-represented amongst the positive clones; these are shown in Table 1. These four loci
together represented 110 (53%) of all positive clones. The
most frequent was locus number 14, which was represented in 40 clones, followed by locus 10 (24 clones),
locus 54 (24 clones) and locus 61 (22 clones). This compares with the fifth most frequent locus, which occurred
only 6 times (Additional file 1). Both horse sera recognized each of the four common loci. The specificity of this
result was confirmed by Western blot of one representative clone of each of the four loci (data not shown).
The CDSs in each of the four common loci were examined
to identify the putative antigen responsible for immune
stimulation. This was achieved by mapping overlapping
clones at each locus. A complete or partial copy of
BMA0840 was present in all clones of locus 10; the same
was true for BMA1027 in locus 14, BMAA0649 for locus
54 and BMAA1324 for locus 61. Furthermore, BMA0840
was the only gene present in 6 independent clones,
BMA1027 was the only gene present in 14 clones,
BMAA0649 was present alone in 12 clones, and
BMAA1324 was present alone in 8 clones. Based on these

observations, we propose that these CDSs encode
immuno-stimulatory proteins during experimental
equine infection. We cannot infer from this that all four
genes were expressed during equine infection; the presence of highly homologous regions between the four proteins could lead to antibody cross-reactivity. Furthermore,
our results do not exclude the possibility that additional
CDSs encoding surface-expressed proteins present in the
four commonly represented loci also contributed towards
the antibody response. For example, BMA0841 (locus 10)
encodes a putative OmpA family protein, and BMAA1323
(locus 61) encodes a putative outer membrane protein
OmpA/SmpA/OmlA family.
B. mallei Burkholderia Hep_Hag autotransporter (BuHA)
proteins
Three of the four putatively immunodominant antigens
were annotated as hemagglutinin family proteins, and the
fourth was annotated as a putative outer membrane protein (Table 1). The domain organization of these proteins
was defined and compared using the Pfam protein family
database [15]. All four proteins contain a C-terminal YadA
domain (Pfam domain PF03895), together with several
HIM (Pfam domain PF05662) and Hep_Hag (Pfam
domain PF05658) domains (Figure 1). The Hep_Hag
domain is a repetitive region comprising a 7 amino acid
repeat that is found in haemagglutinins and invasins. The
HIM domain is another short motif (~20 amino acids)
that is often found in conjunction with the Hep_Hag
motif. The YadA domain is composed of approximately
120 amino acids, and is found in the C-terminal regions
of surface-exposed Gram-negative bacterial proteins associated with autotransporters [16]. Proteins containing the

YadA domain often have a characteristic functional organization, with an extended conserved N-terminal signal
sequence (data not shown) and a central region that often
includes Hep_Hag and HIM domains. In addition to the
conserved domains, these proteins contain variable
domains, which are often composed of low complexity
sequence that are not conserved between family members.
The domain conservation of these proteins has led us to
designate them as Burkholderia Hep_Hag autotransporter
(BuHA) proteins.
To define further the immunodominant region of these
proteins, mapping was carried out to define the minimum
region present in all positive clones at each of the four
loci. For BMA0840, BMA1027 and BMAA1324, all of the
clones contained Hep_Hag domains. For BMAA0649 all
but one of the clones contained Hep_Hag domains, the
errant clone contained the first 48 amino acids at the Nterminus. The Hep_Hag domain may therefore represent
the minimum epitope required to stimulate an antibody
response.
In silico analysis was conducted to define the presence of
B. mallei BuHA proteins using the whole genome
sequence of B. mallei ATCC 23344 [17]. Six genes were
identified, four of which were the CDSs identified above
(BMA0840, BMA1027, BMAA0649, and BMAA1324; Figure 1). Genes encoding the two non-immunogenic B. mallei BuHA proteins were examined. BMAA0810 contained
a C-terminal YadA domain and a single HIM domain, but
no Hep_Hag domains. The CDS encoding this protein
had an IS element (IS407A) located immediately
upstream and lacked an N-terminal signal sequence. IS

element mediated recombination, a feature of the evolution of the B. mallei genome, appears to have resulted in
the truncation of this CDS; it is likely that this CDS is a
pseudogene. The other non-immunogenic member of this
family is BMAA0749. This CDS contains Hep_Hag and
HIM domains (Figure 1), but lacks a strong Pfam YadA
domain match in the C-terminus; a weaker match to the
YadA domain with a score below the Pfam gathering
threshold (score 21.10, e-value 7.4e-06) was detected.
This CDS also lacked an N-terminal signal sequence, and
it is likely that the product is not processed to the external

surface of the cell. These observations could explain the
failure to detect these two loci by immuno-screening.
Six B. mallei isolates are currently undergoing whole
genome sequencing by TIGR [18], and are publicly available via the Pathema database [19]. Alleles of all four
immunodominant proteins were identified in strains
10399, FMN, JHU, and GB8; the number of residues in
the encoded proteins was also comparable. Strain GB8 is
a horse passaged derivative of ATCC 23344, and strains
FMN and JHU are human passaged derivatives of ATCC

23344 isolated during the same infective episode. Two of
the strains, NCTC 10229 and NCTC 10247, did not contain alleles of BMA1027. Additionally, both of these
strains contained identical alleles of BMAA0649, which
encoded proteins with additional internal residues (172
amino acids) in comparison to the ATCC 23344 protein.
NCTC 10229 was originally isolated in Hungary in 1961,
and NCTC 10247 was isolated in Turkey in 1960. Given
their different origins, it is surprising that they both lack
BMA1027 and have identical variants of BMAA049.
The distribution of the four immunogenic B. mallei BuHA
proteins was investigated in collections of B. mallei strains
(n = 21) using PCR. All isolates were positive for
BMA0840 and BMAA1324, whilst BMA1027 and
BMAA0649 showed some variability: 12/21 (57%) of
strains were positive for BMA1027 and 18/21 (86%) of
strains were positive for BMAA0649. The screening was
expanded to include a collection of B. pseudomallei strains
(n = 100). All isolates were positive for the B. pseudomallei
homologs of BMA0840 and BMAA1324, while homologs
of BMA1027 and BMAA0649 were variable but more
widely distributed; 96/100 (96%) and 92/100 (92%) of
the strains were positive for BMA1027 and BMAA0649,
respectively.
Distribution of BuHA proteins
We hypothesized that the BuHA proteins are important
virulence determinants in B. mallei and B. pseudomallei,
and that these would not be present in the highly related
but non-pathogenic B. thailandensis genome [20]. In silico
analysis using the whole genome sequences of B. mallei
ATCC 23344 [17], B. pseudomallei K96243 [21] and B.
thailandensis strain E264 [20] was performed to identify
orthologs of the B. mallei BuHA proteins.

The genome of B. pseudomallei K96243 contained 9 genes
encoding BuHA proteins (Figure 2). This included
orthologs of all four B. mallei immunodominant proteins
and the other two non-immunogenic proteins (Table 2).
With the exception of the B. pseudomallei proteins
BPSL1631 and BPSS0796, all of the orthologs contained a
similar number of amino acid residues and were of a similar size. In the case of BPSL1631 and BPSS0796, there
were increased residues in the repeat regions of these
CDSs; BPSL1631 contained an additional 113 amino acid
residues that corresponded to 4 Hep_Hag domains (Figures 1 and 2); and BPSS0796 contained an additional 118
amino acid residues in a low complexity region (Figures 1
and 2). The B. pseudomallei ortholog of BMAA0810,
BPSS1439, is not truncated and contains an N-terminal
signal sequence, HIM domains, and a C-terminal YadA
domain, but does not contain Hep_Hag domains.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/19

In addition to the orthologs of the B. mallei BuHA proteins, the B. pseudomallei genome contained three other
related CDSs: BPSL1705, BPSS0088 and BPSS1434. All of
these proteins contain HIM, Hep_Hag and YadA domains;
the YadA domain matches for BPSS0088 and BPSS1434
are below the Pfam gathering threshold (score 15.2, evalue 2.1e-05 and score 21.8, e-value 4.8e-06 respectively).
The genome of B. thailandensis strain E264 contained 6
BuHA proteins (Table 2): 4 with Hep-Hag and YadA
domains (BTH_II0112, BTH_II0878, BTH_II0957 and
BTH_II1489); 1 protein with Hep-Hag domains but lacking a C-terminal domain (BTH_II0875); and 1 gene remnant (BTH_II0954) of the B. mallei BMAA0810 and B.
pseudomallei BPSS1439 orthologs. Only one of these proteins was orthologous to the B. mallei immunodominant
proteins (Table 2); two were orthologous to the nonimmunogenic proteins, two have B. pseudomallei
orthologs, but not B. mallei orthologs, and one is unique
to B. thailandensis.
The identification of numerous hemagglutinin family
proteins in the three Burkholderia genomes is in marked
contrast to other bacterial species, including some other
members of the Burkholderiacae which have lower numbers. The phylogenetic relationship of this family of proteins was investigated by aligning the C-terminal YadA
domain regions. The repetitive distribution of Hep_Hag
domains within proteins, and the variability and low
complexity composition of other regions, renders whole
protein comparisons unsuitable for phylogenetic analysis.
The BuHA proteins from B. mallei, B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis and 2 other sequenced Burkholderia species (Burkholderia xenovorans and Burkholderia sp. 383), were
compared with BuHA proteins from other bacteria (Figure
3). The genomes of other Burkholderiaceae contained varying number of BuHA proteins (Burkholderia sp. 383 contains 6; Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 contains 4; and
Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000 contains 1). The BuHA
proteins from B. mallei and B. pseudomallei were represented in two lineages. The B. mallei protein BMAA1324
clustered with orthologs from B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis (Table 2) and a protein from Burkholderia sp.
383, and formed part of a larger cluster that was made up
predominantly of proteins from outside the Burkholderiaceae. The other BuHA proteins from B. mallei, B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis resided within a second
cluster.
The orthogous relationships identified for the B. mallei
and B. pseudomallei proteins using comparative genomic
analysis were also evident in the phylogenetic tree (Figure
3). In addition, the tree topology suggested paralogous
relationships for some of the BuHA proteins. For example,

the orthologous pair B. pseudomallei protein BPSS0796
and B. mallei protein BMAA0649 clustered with B. pseudomallei protein BPSL1705. BPSL1705 resides in a
genomic island (GI 8) [21] on chromosome I and
BPSS0796 resides on chromosome II, but phylogenetic
analysis of the YadA domains suggests that the two loci
arose from a duplication event. The conservation of
Hep_Hag and HIM domains organization in these two
proteins also suggests a common ancestry. On this basis,
it is possible that mobile genetic elements may have had
a role in the expansion of BuHA proteins in B. pseudomallei.

B. pseudomallei expression library screening with
melioidosis patient serum
The finding that B. pseudomallei K96243 contains 9 genes
encoding BuHA proteins raised the possibility that these
may also be immunogenic during human melioidosis. A
B. pseudomallei K96243 expression library was probed
with twenty-one separate serum samples from patients
presenting to Sappasithiprasong Hospital in northeast
Thailand with culture-proven melioidosis. Patient age
ranged from 10–71 years (median 49 years, IQR 31–56
years), and 15 were male. Diabetes mellitus was present in
12 patients, a proportion that reflects the presence of this

condition in the larger melioidosis population. Manifestations of disease were highly variable, as follows: 7
patients had disseminated melioidosis (blood culture
positive plus >1 non-contiguous foci of infection), 4
patients had bacteremia with a single or no identifiable
focus of infection, 2 patients had multifocal infection (>1
non-contiguous foci of infection and blood culture negative), and 8 patients had localized disease (single focus of
infection and blood culture negative).
A total of 189 clones, corresponding to 131 different loci
(comprising a contiguous DNA region from single or
overlapping clones) containing 428 known or putative
open reading frames of B. pseudomallei were isolated. The
BuHA proteins were uncommon; 5 of the putative B. pseudomallei BuHA proteins were present in either one
(BPSL2063, BPSS0908, BPSS0796 and BPSS1439), or two
clones (BPSS1492) (total 6/189 (3%) of clones overall);
the other members of the BuHA protein group were not
observed. Three of the four B. mallei homologs were each
represented once.

Discussions and conclusion
The findings of this study indicate that the BuHA proteins
generate a strong antibody response in the experimental
equine model of glanders. Bacteriophage-mediated
immunoscreening demonstrated that four BuHA proteins
were highly over-represented. Comparative sequence
analysis of the cloned inserts of these four loci identified
the minimum regions present in all clones. For each protein the mapped regions contained Hep_Hag motifs. We
propose that this domain represents the immunostimulatory region of these proteins; the presence of multiple
Hep_Hag protein domains may indicate that there are
multiple sites for immune recognition. In silico analysis of
the B. mallei ATCC 23344 genome identified two further

members of this protein family (BMAA0749 and
BMAA0810); their absence in the library can be explained
by the fact that these were predicted not to be expressed or
processed correctly.
In addition to the Hep_Hag domain, the four B. mallei
immunostimulatory BuHA proteins contain C-terminal
YadA trimeric autotransporter domains. This domain is
found in a large family of surface proteins, and has been
shown to be important in protein processing and transport. The YadA domain inserts into the outer membrane
forming a trimeric structure, which then translocates the
passenger domains to the cell surface side of the membrane [16]. Unlike other autotransporter proteins (for
example, proteins containing the Pfam domain
PF03797), the passenger domains of YadA domain proteins are not cleaved and remain covalently linked to the
translocator domain. Stable trimerization has been shown
to be essential for native folding and stability of the functional passenger domain [22]. Several of the YadA family
proteins have been functionally characterized and shown
to be adhesins that mediate bacterial interactions with
host cells or extracellular matrix proteins [23-28]. The prototypical protein of this family is the YadA adhesin from
Yersinia enterocolitica [29]. In addition to the C-terminal
YadA domain, the protein also contains 4 Hep_Hag
domains and 1 HIM domain. YadA has a trimeric headstalk-anchor architecture [30], with the Hep_Hag and
HIM domains forming part of the head domain [31] (Figure 1). This region of the protein has a left-handed parallel
β-roll (LPBR) structure, which has been shown to bind
collagen [31]. In particular, residues within the Hep_Hag
domain regions of YadA have been shown to be essential
for YadA-mediated collagen binding [32]. Epitope mapping of YadA identified 7 epitopes that were uniquely recognized by an anti-YadA antiserum that was able to

inhibit collagen binding [32]. Four of these epitopes
shared a motif NSVAIG-S that is repeated eight times
within the N-terminal half of YadA and forms part of the
Hep_Hag motif.
The role of B. mallei immunostimulatory BuHA proteins is
unknown, but the similarity in domain organisation to
adhesins such as YadA suggests they may function as cell
surface binding proteins that potentially modulate hostcell interactions. The redundancy of proteins in the
genomes, and the diversity of the proteins, suggests that
they may have functionally distinct roles. Although the
Hep_Hag domain of the YadA protein of Y. enterocolitica
has been shown to bind collagen, it is not known if any of
the B. mallei proteins are able to bind this host molecule.
Further work is needed to characterize the functions and
specificities of these proteins, and the role they play in the
pathogenesis of B. mallei.
Orthologues of all the B. mallei BuHA proteins were identified in the B. pseudomallei K96243 genome, together with
three further CDSs (BPSL1705, BPSS0088 and
BPSS1434). These additional CDSs were in regions of the
B. mallei ATCC23344 genome that appear to have been
deleted in comparison to the B. pseudomalllei K96243
genome [21]. However, this family of proteins was not
strongly immunostimulatory during human melioidosis,
despite evidence for expression in vivo as indicated by a
small number of positive clones in the library. Possible
explanations for the difference in immunostimulatory
capacity of B. mallei in horses and B. pseudomallei in
humans includes variation in the nature of the immune
response or other aspects of disease pathogenesis in the
horse versus human host, and different rates of gene regulation and expression between the two bacterial species. It
is also possible that protein folding and associated immunogenicity differs between the two bacterial species,
although this seems less tenable given their degree of
relatedness [33].
The implications of these findings for vaccine development and diagnostics are currently uncertain. It is unclear
whether the BuHA proteins are immunogenic during
human B. mallei infection. Given the relative lack of
immune response to the BuHA proteins during human
melioidosis, it seems unlikely that detection of antibodies
to BuHA proteins will have diagnostic utility for this infection. Although there are apparent differences in the
immunostimulatory profiles of the hemaglutinin family
proteins of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei in their respective
disease model, both pathogens share an expanded
number of these proteins in comparison to the non-pathogenic B. thailandensis. Both B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis can be isolated from the soil. We speculate on the
basis of a reduced number of hemaglutinin family pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/19

teins othologues in B. thailandensis that they may have a
role in modulating host-cell interactions in B. pseudomallei. Further studies will be required to investigate the in
vivo expression of these proteins in the host, and the role
they play in the pathology of melioidosis.

Methods
Bacterial strains
E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium, using
selection with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), where appropriate.
B. pseudomallei and B. mallei were grown in TSB or TSB
plus 4% glycerol, respectively.
Serum
Sera taken from two separate horses obtained 7 days after
intra-tracheal inoculation of a suspension containing B.
mallei ATCC 23344 together with a control serum from a
horse pre-inoculation were kindly provided by Donald E
Woods, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary. Sera
from 21 patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis were
collected on admission to Sappasithiprasong Hospital,
Ubon Ratchathani, northeast Thailand between 1998 and
2003. Attributable days of symptoms prior to presentation ranged from 3 to 150 days (median 14 days, interquartile range (IQR) 7 to 28 days).
Screening of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei expression
libraries with equine or human sera
Bacteriophage were propagated on E. coli XL1-Blue MRF'
and plaque lifted onto Immobilon-NC nitrocellulose
membranes (Millipore) pre-soaked in 10 mM IPTG,
according to the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight blocking at 4°C in TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4],
0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% [vol/vol] Tween 20) containing 6%
(wt/vol) skimmed milk powder, hybridization was carried out with equine or human sera diluted 1:1,000 (in
TBST-milk) for 90 min at room temperature. Blots were
then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
anti-human or anti-equine IgG gamma chain specific
monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) diluted 1:50,000 (in
TBST) for 30 min at room temperature. Bound antibodies
were detected using nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-BCIP (5Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate) solution (Roche).
After a second purification round of screening, phagemids
containing cloned B. mallei or B. pseudomallei DNA were
excised into E. coli XLOLR according to the manufacturer's
instructions.

Excised phagemid DNA was purified using QIAprep spin
miniprep columns (QIAGEN) and the B. pseudomallei or
B. mallei insert DNA sequenced using a DYEnamic ET Dye
Terminator Kit (Amersham) and MegaBACE 500
sequencer. BLASTN searches using sequences from either
end of the insert were carried out against the B. mallei
ATCC 23344 genome [17,18], or the B. pseudomallei

K96243 genome [21,34]. Mapping of positive clones were
performed using Artemis software [35]. Domain organization of proteins was defined and compared using the
Pfam [15] website [36].
PCR detection of genes encoding BuHA proteins in B.
mallei and B. pseudomallei
Two bacterial strain collections were examined; 21 B. mallei isolates have been described previously [37], and 100
B. pseudomallei isolates were from patients with melioidosis presenting to Sappasithiprasong Hospital during 2001
(n = 50) or recovered from the environment in northeast
Thailand (n = 50). A single colony picked from solid agar
was inoculated into TSB and incubated overnight in air at
37°C, after which genomic DNA was extracted using the
Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega).

The presence or absence of four BuHA proteins in B. mallei
and their homologs in B. pseudomallei was defined by
PCR. The primers used were as follows: BMA0840-f (5'AGCGGCGCGGGGTCCTATTC),
BMA0840-r
(5'CCGCCGCCACGTTGATGAG);
BMA1027-f
(5'AGCGCGGGCAGCATTTACTTCC), BMA1027-r (5'-GATTCGCGTTGACCGTGCTGAGG); BMAA0649-f (5'-CGGTGAACGGCTCGCAGATGAATG),
BMAA0649-r
(5'GGCCCCGCGAACCGAACGACAC); and BMAA1324-f
(5'-GCCGCGGCGCAGGTCAG),
BMAA1324-r
(5'CCGTCGCCCGCCGCTTCC).
The final concentrations of the PCR mixtures were 1X
reaction buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.35 μM of each primer, 5
μl of 1:20 dilution template DNA, 200 μM dNTPs and 2.5
unit Taq polymerase (Promega). Samples were held at
95°C for 2 min and then subjected to 40 cycles of 95°C
for 30 s, 68°C (BMA0840 & BMA1027) or 70°C
(BMAA0649 & BMAA1324) for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s,
followed by a final extension step of 72°C for 5 min. Reactions for BMA 0840 and BMA 1027 were multiplexed.
PCR amplifications were performed using a PTC-0200
DNA engine (MJ Research, Cambridge, MA), and aliquots
of reaction mixtures were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.
In silico identification of orthologs of BuHA proteins
Orthologs of BuHA proteins in the genomes of B. pseudomallei K96243 (accession numbers BX571965 and
BX571966) [21], B. mallei ATCC 23344 (accession numbers CP000010 and CP000011) [17] and B. thailandensis
E264 (accession numbers CP000086 and CP000085) [20]
was carried out by reciprocal FASTA [38] analysis as previously described [39]. Coding sequences containing
Hep_Hag (PF05658) and YadA (PF03895) domains were
identified using HMMER [40] and the respective Pfam
profile HMMs downloaded from the Pfam website [36].
The identification of alleles of BuHA proteins in 6 B. mal-

lei isolates (10399, FMN, JHU, GB8, 10229 and
NCTC10247) currently undergoing whole genome
sequencing by The Institute of Genome Research (TIGR)
[18] was carried out using BLASTN [41]. Additional Burkholderiaceae genomes sequences used in this study were
from: Burkholderia sp. 383 (accession numbers
CP000150, CP000151 and CP000152), Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 (accession numbers CP000270, CP000271
and CP000272) and Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000
(accession numbers AL646052 and AL646053) [42].
Phylogenetic analysis
An unrooted maximum likelihood tree built using Phylip
(Version 3.6) [43] was drawn using NJplot [44].
Sequences were aligned using ClustalX (Version 1.82)
[45].
