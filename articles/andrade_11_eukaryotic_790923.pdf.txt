Abstract
Background: Schistosomiasis remains an important parasitic disease and a major economic problem in many
countries. The Schistosoma mansoni genome and predicted proteome sequences were recently published
providing the opportunity to identify new drug candidates. Eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) play a central role in
mediating signal transduction through complex networks and are considered druggable targets from the medical
and chemical viewpoints. Our work aimed at analyzing the S. mansoni predicted proteome in order to identify and
classify all ePKs of this parasite through combined computational approaches. Functional annotation was
performed mainly to yield insights into the parasite signaling processes relevant to its complex lifestyle and to
select some ePKs as potential drug targets.
Results: We have identified 252 ePKs, which corresponds to 1.9% of the S. mansoni predicted proteome, through
sequence similarity searches using HMMs (Hidden Markov Models). Amino acid sequences corresponding to the
conserved catalytic domain of ePKs were aligned by MAFFT and further used in distance-based phylogenetic analysis
as implemented in PHYLIP. Our analysis also included the ePK homologs from six other eukaryotes. The results show
that S. mansoni has proteins in all ePK groups. Most of them are clearly clustered with known ePKs in other
eukaryotes according to the phylogenetic analysis. None of the ePKs are exclusively found in S. mansoni or belong to
an expanded family in this parasite. Only 16 S. mansoni ePKs were experimentally studied, 12 proteins are predicted
to be catalytically inactive and approximately 2% of the parasite ePKs remain unclassified. Some proteins were
mentioned as good target for drug development since they have a predicted essential function for the parasite.
Conclusions: Our approach has improved the functional annotation of 40% of S. mansoni ePKs through combined
similarity and phylogenetic-based approaches. As we continue this work, we will highlight the biochemical and
physiological adaptations of S. mansoni in response to diverse environments during the parasite development,
vector interaction, and host infection.

Background
Human schistosomiasis caused by blood fluke parasites of
Schistosoma genus, remains an important parasitic disease
and a major health economic problem in many tropical
and subtropical countries. Schistosomes have a complex
life cycle that includes six different stages (cercariae, schistosomula, adult worms - male and female, egg, miracidia
and sporocyst) in different environments: water, definitive

host (mammals) and intermediate host (snail). During
parasite development, signals from the environment are
sensed and stimulate physiological, morphological and,
biochemical adaptations. Oils are shown to stimulate cercarial penetration; hormones and exposure to the snail
haemolymph trigger specific physiological adaptations
[1-3]. The free living parasite forms display light and geotropism and female development is dependent on signals
from the male adult worm through mechanisms not completely understood [4,5]. It has been demonstrated that
worm pairing induces changes in gene expression in the
female vitelline gland [4] and the accumulation of glutathione and lipids in the male [5]. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed distinct differential gene expression

profiles between males and females [6-8]. Therefore, the
success of the parasite infection depends on the assessment at the cellular and molecular levels of the environment and the transmission of signals to physiological
regulatory networks that will collectively stimulate
adaptations.
The maintenance of homeostasis and complex cellular
adaptations in Schistosoma mansoni require specific
extracellular signals that must be integrated to generate
an appropriate response from the sensory receptor via
intracellular proteins [3]. Signal transduction involves
non-linearly integrated networks that interact mostly by
switching activity status via phosphorylation (protein
kinases) and dephosphorylation (protein phosphatases) of
amino acid residues, or the incorporation of GTP. Other
cellular non-protein messengers include cyclic AMP,
Ca2+ and diacylglycerol.
Protein kinases (PKs) play a central role in mediating
intracellular signals by adding a phosphate group from
ATP or GTP to an amino acid residue leading to a conformational change in the target protein that will switch
its activation status [9]. Most PKs have a catalytic
domain, which binds and phosphorylates target proteins,
and a regulatory region. Many PKs are autophosphorylated or may be phosphorylated by other PKs, an interaction regulated by the accessory protein domains [10].
PKs are classified into two superfamilies containing the
eukaryotic or conventional protein kinases (ePK) that
share a conserved catalytic domain, and the atypical protein kinases (aPKs) (Table 1). The catalytic domain of
ePKs is composed of 250-300 amino acids and is divided
into 12 subdomains with highly conserved individual
amino acids and motifs [11]. aPKs are reported to have
biochemical kinase activity, but lack sequence similarity
to the ePK catalytic domain [12]. According to their substrate recognition sites, ePKs are divided broadly into
two major classes, serine/threonine kinases (STKs) and
tyrosine kinases (TKs). Dual specificity kinases (Hybrid),
which phosphorylate serine, threonine, and tyrosine, are

also found. ePKs have been further classified into eight
groups based on sequence similarity of their catalytic
domains, the presence of accessory domains, and their
modes of regulation [9,12-14]. According to KinBase
[15], a database that holds information of PKs encoded in
the human genome and their homologs in other eukaryotes, the eight ePK groups are: AGC (cAMP-dependent
protein kinase/protein kinase G/protein kinase C
extended), CAMK (Calcium/Calmodulin regulated
kinases), CK1 (Cell Kinase I), CMGC (Cyclin-dependent
Kinases and other close relatives), RGC (Receptor Guanylate Cyclases), STE (MAP Kinase cascade kinases), TK
(Protein Tyrosine Kinase) and TKL (Tyrosine Kinase
Like). A ninth group, called ‘’Other’’, consists of a mixed
collection of kinases that cannot be classified easily into
the previous families [14] (Table 1).
PKs are considered druggable targets from the medical
and chemical viewpoints as a growing number of PKs inhibitors have been developed and approved for treatment of
different human disease [16]. An example of a successful
PK inhibitor is Gleevac®, that induces a conformational
change in PTK and mimics substrate binding and therefore prevents activation by upstream kinases [17]. Beyond
this, PKs have gained interest as targets treatment strategies to fight many parasites, including S. mansoni [18-21].
The current schistosomiasis treatment frequently does
not cure 100% of those treated in high-risk communities
and the emergence of Schistosoma resistant strains is a
real possibility [22-25]. Thus, the identification of potential
drug targets should be further emphasized. The recent
sequencing of S. mansoni genome and large-scale transcriptome projects have yielded crucial information to the
identification of new candidate drugs [26-29]. Understanding protein structure and function in many model organisms can help elucidate the function of their parasite
homologs and further enable the application of such information in drug design and development. The study of the
kinase complement (kinome) is therefore of major importance for the understanding of the physiology of the
organism and also provides insights into how to disrupt
the fine adaptative mechanisms. The present work aimed
at analyzing the S. mansoni predicted proteome data in
order to identify all ePKs encoded in the genome of this
parasite. For this purpose, we combined computational
approaches such as sequence similarity searches using
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and distance-based phylogenetic analyses. The functional annotation was performed mainly to yield insights into the signaling process
related to the complex lifestyle of S. mansoni.

Results and discussion
The Schistosoma mansoni ePKinome

The ePK complement of S. mansoni, defined as the
ePKinome, was identified by searching the parasite

predict proteome with a HMM profile of the ePK catalytic domain of five selected organisms. This analysis
revealed 252 ePKs in the S. mansoni predicted proteome, representing 1.9% of the total proteins encoded
in the parasite genome. Although the total number of
protein kinases found across the analyzed species varies
greatly (from 82 to 503), the percentage values in
respect to the genomes of protozoan and helminth parasites as well as other eukaryotes from KinBase range
only between 1.5 to 2% (Figure 1).
Amino acid sequences corresponding to the conserved
catalytic domain of ePKs were aligned by MAFFT [30] and
further used in phylogenetic analysis based on a distance
method as implemented in PHYLIP [31]. The dataset for
each ePK group also included the ePK homologs from six
other eukaryotes: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Brugia malayi. This approach
allowed us to classify the S. mansoni ePKinome at the
group, family, and/or subfamily levels based on the hierarchy proposed elsewhere [12,13,32,32], and sometimes provided insights into kinase function and evolution. Detailed
information is available in the Additional file 1 that
contains, among other things, all S. mansoni ePKs with
the corresponding identifier from the genome project
linked to SchistoDB database [29]. SchistoDB http://www.
schistodb.net allows the community to access to all
sequences, annotations and other data types integrated

into the genomic information. It also provides several
tools to analyze retrieve and display the data. In the SchistoDB it is possible to encounter, for each ePK, the development expression stages by EST evidence, information
about orthologs, Gene Onthology (GO) function, metabolic pathways, structural information, PDB structures,
and links to external databases such as the TDR database
[33]. The TDR database contains additional information
for S. mansoni genes like antigenicity, essentiality, phenotypes and associated compounds (druggability).
As shown in Figure 2, S. mansoni proteins have representatives in the main ePK groups. ePKs that do not fall
into these groups are categorized as “Other” in which
multiple families have been defined. The S. mansoni largest ePK group is CMGC, a feature unique to this parasite, and the smallest group is RGC, a common feature
shared with many of the analyzed organisms (Figure 2).
Of the 252 ePKs identified in S. mansoni proteome,
only 16 were experimentally studied as highlighted in the
supplementary material (Additional file 1) and the others
236 ePKs were previously annotated only by automatic
methods based on sequence similarity searches [26,29].
S. mansoni ePKs were examined for the presence of the
12 smaller subdomains present in the catalytic domain
and also for the presence of a lysine in subdomain II and
aspartic acids residues in subdomain VIb and VII, which
are known to play essential roles in the kinase function
[9,12,34]. According to our analysis, 12 proteins are predicted to be catalytically inactive ePKs, as they lack one
or more of the three essential amino acid residues in the
catalytic domain (Additional file 1), including all members of S. mansoni RGC group (see below).
Approximately 2% of the S. mansoni ePK remain
unclassified once they do not have similarity to any

known PK family. All these proteins have a truncated
catalytic domain probably because of an incorrect protein prediction. The unclassified ePKs from C. elegans,
D. melanogaster, H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae range from
19% to about 38% their kinomes.
Serine/Threonine kinases
AGC group

Around 13 families have been classified as part of the
AGC group in eukaryotic organisms [11]. In S. mansoni,
most AGC proteins belong to PKA (Protein Kinase A)
(5 proteins), DMPK (Myotonic Dystrophy Protein
Kinase) (4 proteins and 1 product of alternative splicing),
PKC (Protein Kinase C) (4 proteins) and PKG (4 proteins) families. Other S. mansoni proteins have only one
representative in the remaining AGC families (Additional
file 1). According to our phylogenetic analysis, S. mansoni has no homolog of the YANK (Yet Another Novel
Kinase) family (Additional file 2).
The most significant difference between PKA and PKG
family members is that in PKA, the regulatory and catalytic activities are performed by separate gene products
known as PKA-R and PKA-C, respectively, whereas in
PKG the cNMP-binding (cyclic nucleotide-binding
domain) and catalytic domains are usually present in the
same polypeptide [35]. The inactive conformation of PKA
is a heterotetramer of two PKA-R and two PKA-C subunits, while PKG exists as a homodimer [35]. S. mansoni
processes five homologs of the PKA-C subunit (Additional
file 1), and six predicted of PKC-R subunit (Smp_131050,
Smp_147320, Smp_079010, Smp_030400, Smp_019280,
Smp_022100) allowing for a variety of different holoenzymes to be formed in this parasite. Some studies demonstrated that PKG proteins of Toxoplasma [36] and Eimeria
[37] and PKG and PKA proteins of Plasmodium [38,39]
are essential as the inhibitors causes an anti-parasite effect
in these organisms. Recently it was shown that inhibition
of the SmPKA-C subunit (Smp_152330), expressed in
adult worms of S. mansoni, resulted in the death of the
parasites [40]. This result and the range of holoenzymes
that can be formed, indicate that genes in this family are
critical for the development of S. mansoni and may represent good targets for drug development.
PKC belongs to a large protein family that is classified
into four important subfamilies: PKC Alpha subfamily,
that contain the conventional PKCs (g, bI, bII, and a)
and are sensitive to diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ca2+; PKC
Eta and Delta subfamilies containing the novel PKCs (ε,
δ, h, and θ) which are regulated by DAG alone; and PKC
Iota subfamily, that contain the atypical PKCs (ζ and ι),
and are insensitive to both compounds [41,42]. PKC is
considered to be a mechanistic regulator of development
in vertebrates, playing a key role in cell growth and differentiation [43-45]. S. mansoni has representatives in the

Page 4 of 19

three main PKC subfamilies mentioned above (Iota, Eta
and Alpha) but lacks homologs in the Delta subfamily,
present in C. elegans, D. melanogaster, M. musculus, and
H. sapiens. The two PKC Alpha proteins found in
S. mansoni (Smp_128480 and Smp_176360), belong to
the PKCbI isoform and were recently characterized
[46-48]. Both are associated with the neural mass, excretory vesicle, ridge cyton, tegument and germinal cells in
schistosomula and miracidium, suggesting a possible role
in larval transformation [46-48].
One protein in AGC group, Smp_157370, remains
unclassified. In the phylogenetic tree, this protein appears
more closely related to the GRK (G-protein coupled
Receptor Kinase) family (Additional file 2), despite the
good conservation of the catalytic domain, this protein
lacks the accessory domain that is characteristic of the
GRK proteins (Additiona file 2). Furthermore, Smp_
157370 does not form a clade with the GRK family
members according to our phylogenetic tree, which corroborates its divergence in relation to GRK homologs in
other eukaryotes (Additional file 2).
Interestingly, according to SchistoDB [29] EST evidences, the two most highly transcribed ePKs
(Smp_151140 and Smp_158560.1) in S. mansoni, belong
to the DMPK family of the AGC group, mainly in cercariae, schistosomula, eggs and adult worms. This finding is
interesting as these are the four life cycle stages of the
parasite which are in contact with the definitive host. In
C. elegans proteins of DMPK family are expressed in hypodermal cells and are involved in embryonic elongation
[49].
CaMK group

The divalent cation calcium (Ca 2+ ) is one of the ions
most widely used as a second messenger in cellular signaling. A significant portion of calcium-mediated signaling is controlled by calmodulin-binding kinases. Some
members of the CaMK group are dependent on the binding of Ca2+/CaM [50]. In the S. mansoni ePKinome, 32
proteins were classified as CaMK with the vast majority
(18 proteins) belonging to the CaMKL (Calcium/Calmodulin Regulated Kinase) - like family. A similar number
was found in other organisms analyzed here (Additional
file 3). S. mansoni also contain members of DAPK (death
associated protein kinase), MAPKAPK (MAPK associated
protein kinase), MLCK (myosin light chain kinase), and
PHK (phosphorylase kinase) families in the CaMK group
(Additional file 4).
MLCK is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
whose only known substrate is myosin II regulatory light
chain [51]. The primary function of MLCK is to stimulate
muscle contraction through the phosphorylation of the
myosin II regulatory light chain (RLC), a eukaryotic
motor protein that interacts with filamentous actin.
Although MLCK has only one known substrate (RLC),

Andrade et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:215
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/215

this protein is linked to a variety of cellular processes due
to the diverse biological function of myosin II [50]. Two
distinct smooth muscle MLCK genes were identified in
S. mansoni (Smp_121780, Smp_126240), although no
homologs were identified for the non-smooth muscle
vertebrate MLCK through our phylogenetic analysis.
This likely reflects the absence of a striated muscle in
this parasite.
DCAMKL (Doublecortin and CaMK-like) is a protein
that regulates the microtubule cytoskeleton and in the
chick is specifically expressed in the developing brain
[52,53]. CASK is a protein that participates in cell adhesion [54]. According to our phylogenetic analysis, a single homolog of the DCAMKL (Smp_053560) and CASK
(Smp_131690) families were found in S. mansoni (Additional file 4).
While the CaMK2 (CaMK family 2) family is encoded
by four genes in humans, only a single CaMK2 gene,
with two predicted alternative spliced transcripts, was
identified in the S. mansoni genome (Additional file 1).
S. mansoni CaMK2 was recently identified as putative
target for drug development after comparative chemogenomics approach using the S. mansoni proteome and
the proteome of two model organisms, C. elegans and
D. melanogaster. [55]. The function of this protein in
S. mansoni is still unknown. In sea urchin, CaMK2 is
required for nuclear envelope breakdown following fertilization [56].
CMGC group

CMGC kinases are relatively abundant in S. mansoni, a
feature that can be explained by the requirement to control cell proliferation and to ensure correct replication and
segregation of organelles, which together are essential
mechanisms for parasites with a complex life cycle. In the
CMGC group, all of the main families are conserved
between S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, M. musculus, H. sapiens,
and S. mansoni, including CDK (Cyclin Dependent
Kinase), MAPK (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase), GSK
(Gycogen Synthase 3 Kinase), CLK (CDC-Like Kinase),
SRPK (SR Protein Kinase), CK2 (Cell Kinase 2), and
DYRK (Dual-specificity Tyrosine Regulated Kinase) (Additional file 5) and RCK.
S. mansoni has 14 CDKs, the same number was found in
C. elegans (compared with only seven in S. cerevisiae),
including homologs of all subfamilies (CDK7, CDK4,
CDK8, CRK7, CDK9, PITSLRE, CDK10, PCTAIRE,
PFTAIRE, VDK5 and CDC2) (Additional file 5). On the
other hand, only one RCK family protein (Smp_132890)
was identified in the parasite. The RCK proteins are similar
to mammalian MAK (male germ cell-associated kinase),
which have been implicated in spermatogenic meiosis and
in signal transduction pathways for sight and smell [51].
GSK family is represented by 3 proteins in S. mansoni.
One of those (Smp_008260.1) was selected as putative

Page 5 of 19

target for drug development after comparative chemogenomics approach [55]. GSK proteins are involved in
development and cell proliferation, are overexpressed in
colon carcinomas and positively regulates the Wnt signaling pathway during embryonic development and
oocyte-to-embryo transition in C. elegans [57].
The MAPK signaling pathways are some of the best
characterized signaling systems. S. mansoni contains
nine MAPKs, compared to seven in D. melanogaster
and 14 in C. elegans. As shown in Figure 3, mammals
have, at least five MAPK cascades described; these
include the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
cascade, which regulates cell growth and differentiation,
the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), and the p38 MAPK cascades, which
function mainly in stress responses such as inflammation and apoptosis [58]. In D. melanogaster and C. elegans, the MAPK pathways are involved in critical
cellular and developmental processes [59,60]. S. cerevisiae has four distinct MAPK signaling pathways that are
likely mediators of responses to pheromone, nutritional
starvation, and cellular or osmotic stress [51]. The
MAPK signaling pathways are well conserved in S. mansoni (Figure 3), including representatives of the subfamilies ERK, p38, JNK, and, NLK but lacks members of
ERK5 that are part of a signaling pathways found mainly
in mammals (Additional file 5). Each subfamily is activated by different stimuli that generate different biological responses [61-63]. In S. mansoni only one protein
was identified in JNK (Smp_172240) subfamily. JNK
proteins play key roles in human cell function [62] and
in the development of C. elegans worms [64]. JNK may
have an important role in schistosome survival and
represent a good target for experimental approaches.
STE group

In S. mansoni, the STE group includes seven STE7
(MEK or MAPKK), two STE11 (MEKK or MAPKKK),
and 13 STE20 (MEKKK) kinases (Additional file 6). The
large number of STE family members in S. mansoni
could translate into an enormous potential for downstream signal specificity and diversity. SmSLK
(Smp_150260) is a Ste20 family protein, recently characterized in S. mansoni, which is able to activate protein
MAPK/JNK in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells as
well as in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, imunofluorescence showed that SmSLK was abundant in the tegument of adult schistosomes [65]. These findings indicate
that signals sensed in the environment by many different proteins may activate the MAPK cascade that will
generate an adaptive physiological response. Futhermore, molecules that activate the MAPK pathways, as
some hormone and cytokine signals, are not found in
the S. mansoni predicted proteome (Figure 3). It has
been demonstrated that the parasite takes advantage of

Figure 3 MAPK signaling pathway. MAPKs are expressed in all eukaryotic cells and are activated by diverse stimuli ranging from cytokines,
growth factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, cellular stress, and cell adherence. The basic assembly of the MAPK pathway is a three-component
module that includes three kinases that establish a sequential activation pathway comprising a MAPK kinase kinase (MKKK, MEKK, STE11, or
STE13), MAPK kinase (MKK, MEK or STE7), and MAPK (green). The activated MAPK may translocate to the nucleus and bind to transcription factors
(light blue). The mammalian MAPK can be subdivided into five families: ERK, p38, JNK, nml, and ERK5. Each MAPK family has distinct biological
functions. Colored blocks correspond to proteins indentified in the S. mansoni predicted proteome and white blocks are mammals’ proteins with
no homologs in S. mansoni predicted proteome. The + signal represents protein activation and - signal protein inhibition by protein
phosphatases (red colored proteins). S. mansoni has all representatives of ERK, p38, and JNK pathways including proteins of STE (MEK1/2, MKK),
AGC (PKC and PKA), CaMK (MAPKAPK), TK (EGFR, FGFR), and TKL (Raf and TGFbeta-RI) groups.

host proteins for its growth and development [66,67].
Other ePKs such as members of the PKA, PKC, Raf and
receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RTKs) families, also
participate in MAPK signaling pathway. RTKs are
anchored to the membrane and have an important role
in transmitting the signal from the extracellular to cytoplasm (Figure 3) [64].
In C. elegans genome studies such as classical forward
genetic and RNA interference screens and systematic
targeted gene knockout revealed genes that are essential
to the organism [68]. Although the off-target and nonspecific effect of RNAi [69,70], in S. mansoni this is one
of the best approaches to explore the functional property of the genes since the knockout experiments are
not yet available for schistosomes [71]. By analyzing the
phylogenetic trees of the present work, it was possible
to identify the proteins of S. mansoni that have homologs in C. elegans and display lethality and sterile phenotypes by RNAi (Table 2). Interestingly, most essential
proteins in table 2 belong to the CMGC and STE
groups, suggesting the involvement of these proteins in
signaling pathways that culminate in essential cellular
processes.

CK1 Group

The two smallest groups found in the S. mansoni ePKinome were CK1 and RGC (Figure 2). In contrast, in C.
elegans CK1 is the largest group and RGC is dramatically expanded. However, these expansions are a unique
feature of C. elegans, as compared to other eukaryotes
selected for this analysis (Figure 4). The CK1 group consists of three main ePK families: CK1, VRK (Vaccinia
Related Kinase), and TTBK (Tau Tubulin Kinase) that
formed three individual clusters in the phylogenic tree
(Figure 4). S. mansoni has representatives in each of
these families also found in C. elegans, D. melanogaster,
M. musculus, H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae and B. malayi
kinomes. The nematodes, C. elegans and B. malayi, still
have two other families that seem to be specific to this
taxonomic group, TTBKL and Worm6. The Worm8
family was identified only in Caenorhabditis so far. The
diversification of the CK1 group in C. elegans may be an
adaptation allowing for enhanced DNA repair in
response to excessive exposure to environmental mutagens [51]. One CK1 encoding gene (spe-6) functions in
spermatogenesis, and at least half of the proteins in this
group are selectively expressed in C. elegans sperm as

identification and analysis of essential genes.

shown by microarray analysis [72,73]. The role of these
proteins in the parasite S. mansoni is unclear.
Tyrosine kinases
TK group

PTKs can be classified, based on the presence or
absence of transmembrane domains, into receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that relay intracellular signals [74],

and cytoplasmatic tyrosine kinase (CTK). S. mansoni
kinome contains 15 RTKs and 19 CTKs. The 15 RTK
include two InsRs (Insulin Receptors), four EGFRs (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), two VKRs (Venus Flytrap Kinase Receptors), a representative for Ephs
(Ephrin receptors), Ror, CCK4 (Colon Carcinoma Kinase
4), and MUSK (Muscle_Specific kinase) families, besides
three unknown receptors.

PHYLIP programs. Bootstrap values (1000 replicates) equal or higher than 80% are indicated (●) as cutoff values to support the family/subfamily
classification. Functional classification is indicated individually in the protein labels. Protein families are highlighted by the vertical bars and
include: VRK (Vaccinia Related Kinase), CK1 (Casein Kinase 1), TTBK (Tau Tubulin Kinase), Worm 8 (a specific family of Caenorhabditis), TTBKL (TTBKLike kinase), and worm 6, two specific families of C. elegans and B. malayi.

Two InsRs in S. mansoni, SmIR-1 (Smp_009990) and
SmIR-2 (Smp_074030) present distinct functions during
parasite development. These two receptors are well clustered within the InsR families but showed to be more
divergent than the mammalian and D. melanogaster
proteins (Additional file 7). SmIR-1 was localized in the
muscles, intestinal epithelium, and basal membrane of
adult male and female worms and at the periphery of
schistosomula, mainly in the tegument [75]. SmIR-1 colocalized in schistosome tegument with glucose transporters suggesting a role in the regulation of glucose
uptake which is an essential nutrient for the intramammalian stages of S. mansoni. SmIR-2, in contrast,
was distributed in the parenchyma of adult males and
females indicating a possible involvement of the receptor in parasite growth. S. mansoni is the first invertebrate with two insulin receptors characterized that seem
to have distinct functions, as in vertebrates [18,75,76].
Mammals have two InsR members; insulin-like growth
factor receptor (IGFR), which has a role in controlling
growth, and (InR) which has specialized in metabolic
regulation [77].
In C. elegans EGFR signaling induces behavioral quiescence [78]. One S. mansoni EGFR homolog (Smp_173590)
was localized in the parasite muscle and perhaps related to
muscle development or function [79]. Vertebrate EGF
activates S. mansoni EGFR and the downstream classical
ERK pathway (Figure 3), indicating the conservation of
EGFR function in S. mansoni [79]. Moreover, human EGF
was shown to increase protein and DNA synthesis as well
as protein phosphorylation in parasites, supporting the
hypothesis that host EGF could regulate schistosome
development [80]. The similarity of schistosome proteins
to sex hormone receptors of mammalian hosts provides a
good example of host parasite relationship, where the
adult worm depends on the host hormone synthesis for
their maturation and reproduction [3].
Five S. mansoni proteins are not clustered with the main
RTK families as shown in our phylogenetic analyses (Additional file 7). Three of them have a truncated catalytic
domain (Smp_175590, Smp_093500 and Smp_157300)
and two are specific RTK with a venus flytrap domain
(VKR family). VKR is a family of receptors found in invertebrates, especially in insects. One S. mansoni VKR protein, Smp_153500 (SmVKR), was recently studied [81].
We identified another protein (Smp_019790) clustering
with SmVKR (Additional file 7) with a high similarity.
Despite the similarity of the catalytic domain of VKR protein with the IRs, these two proteins are not clustered with
InsR family. In this respect, the most interesting finding is
that VKR family members are not found in mammals and
could represent good targets for drug development as a
specific inhibitor for this family will probably not affect
any protein of the host [81].

Page 9 of 19

The CTKs in S. mansoni are represented by 11 different
families (Additional file 7). SmTK3 (Smp_054500) and
SmTK5 (Smp_136300) - src family members, and SmTK4
(Smp_149460) - syk family, are present in reproductive
organs and possibly involved in the development of
gonads and multiplication of germinal and vitelline cells
[82-84]. Abl proteins of S. mansoni (Smp_128790 and
Smp_169230) were recently studied using a Abl specific
inhibitor (Imatinib, Gleevac ®). The results showed an
important morphological alteration in adult worms
of S. mansoni that led to the death of the parasites [21].
C. elegans contains 42 members of the Fer family, while
only a single member, SmFes, was found in S. mansoni.
The Fer gene of S. mansoni (SmFes, Smp_164810) exhibits
the characteristic features of Fes/Fps/Fer (fes, feline sarcoma; fps, Fujinami poultry sarcoma; fer, fes related)
PTKs. By immunolocalization assays it was shown that
SmFes is particularly expressed at the terebratorium of
miracidia and tegument of cercaria and schistosomula
skin-stage. These findings suggest that SmFes may play a
role in signal transduction pathways involved in larval
transformation after penetration into intermediate and
definitive hosts [85,86].
RGC group

Proteins in this group share sequence similarity to the catalytic domain (Pfam: PF07714) found in proteins of the
TK group [87]. The RGC group is underrepresented in
most species, except in C. elegans that has a large expansion of these proteins and S. cerevisiae that has no protein
with similarity to the TK catalytic domain (Figure 2). Only
three RGC members were identified in the S. mansoni
ePKinome. All of them are more closely related to
the mammalian and insect families than the worm family.
C. elegans and B. malayi RGC proteins form at least two
different families noticeably more divergent from S. mansoni, D. melanogaster, M. musculus, and H. sapiens
families as suggested by our phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 8). Most RGC proteins remain functionally
uncharacterized. In C. elegans, several RGC proteins are
highly expressed in restricted sets of neurons and are
implicated in chemosensation. One RGC is involved in
dauer stage formation [88]. Other parasites such as
L. major, T. brucei, T. cruzi and P. falciparum also lack
homologs in the RGC group [20,89]. The three S. mansoni
RGC proteins have an amino acid substitution in the
aspartic acid in subdomain VIb of the catalytic domain,
rendering them catalytically inactive. Although the catalytic center of an enzyme is usually highly conserved, there
have been reports of proteins, like those of the RGC group
of ePKs, with substitutions at essential catalytic positions,
which convert the enzyme into a catalytically inactive
form. A recent study showed that inactive enzymes are
found in a large variety of families conserved among
metazoan species and they have lost their catalytic activity,

Andrade et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:215
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/215

have adopted new functions, and are involved in regulatory processes [34,90].
Hybrid protein kinase
TKL Group

TKL consists of a divergent group that is phylogenetically
close to the tyrosine kinases (Figure 3). However, TKL
proteins have an unusual catalytic domain that is a hybrid
between the serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases [32].
The catalytic domain may display greater similarity to the
tyrosine catalytic domain (Pfam: PF07714) or to the serine/threonine catalytic domains (Pfam: PF00069) [10,11].
In S. mansoni, the TKL group includes MLK (Miked
Lineage Kinases), LISK (Family containing closely related
LIMK and TESK sub-families), Raf, RIPK (Receptor
Interacting Protein Kinase), STKR (Serine/threonine
kinase Receptors for activin and TGFb ligands), and
LRRK (Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase) (type 1 and type 2)
families. Of the 19 TKL proteins found in S. mansoni, 15
display greater similarity to the serine/threonine catalytic
domain and four (of Raf and MKL/ILK families) to the
tyrosine catalytic domain. S. mansoni has no homologous
proteins of the IRAK (interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase) family that is present in C. elegans, B.
malayi, D. melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and M. musculus
(Additional file 9). Although S. cerevisiae does not have
any TKL protein homologue, other fungal species do
contain such proteins [14]. Raf (also known as MAPKKK)
is a TKL family that plays an important role in the activation of STE proteins in the signaling cascade that culminates in the activation of ERK1/2 (Figure 4) [63]. A
recent study showed that blocking the expression of the
homolog of the S. mansoni Raf protein (Smp_176990) in
C. elegans by RNAi, generate a sterile phenotype, which
supports the hypothesis of the involvement of Raf protein
in the germline development, somatic gonad development, oogenesis, spermatogenesis, ovulation or fertilization (Table 2). Raf protein may represents a good target
for drug development in S. mansoni.
A STKR member that binds to TGFb (Transforming
growth factor) is a membrane receptor that can be
divided into two subclasses (Type I and Type II). The
type II receptor binds TGFb and then recruits the type I
receptor. The TGFb type I receptor was cloned in S.
mansoni (SmTbRI - Smp_173400.2) and it was found to
be localized in the parasite surface [91,92]. Other type I
STRK (Smp_049760) was identified in the S. mansoni
predicted proteome and was not experimentally characterized so far (Additional file 9). Three type II STKRs
(TGFb type II receptors) are proteins identified in the
same contig which were predicted to be a product of
alternative splicing. A recent study revealed the presence
of two transcripts that are translated into two different

Page 10 of 19

isoforms of type II receptor [93]. These transcripts are
produced from the same gene by alternative splicing of
the last two exons. The authors indicated that these different type II receptors might signal in different cells or
development stages. Furthermore, that study showed
that in the presence of human TGFb, SmTbRII
(Smp_165310) activated SmTbRI. The results also provide evidence for the role for the TGF-b signaling pathway in male-induced female reproductive development
[94,95].
Other Group

The Other group consists of a mixed collection of
kinases with representatives in higher eukaryotes,
including SCY1, NEK (Mitotic Kinase family, also
known as NRK), PEK, Haspin, WEE, NAK (Numb-Associated Kinase), ULK (Unc-51 Like Kinase), IRE (Inositol
Requiring), PLK (Polo Like Kinases), AUR (Aurora
Kinase), and CDC7 (Cell Division Control 7) families
(Additional file 1). Our analysis showed that 15% of the
S. mansoni ePKinome do not fall into any of the eight
major groups, but include 20 smaller and conserved
families.
Accessory Domains

The structure of the catalytic domain of many ePKs is
highly conserved across distinct organisms because of
the fact that all ePKs recognize and bind ATP at common sites. However, only the catalytic domain (architecture/sequence) is sufficiently divergent to enable the
discrimination of groups, families, and subfamilies
(Figure 5).
Most ePKs also have a second domain that is involved
in protein-protein interaction and allosteric regulation
of the catalytic domain [17]. In this work, only the catalytic domain sequence was used in the phylogenetic analyses. Interestingly, when the information on the ePK
accessory domains was integrated into the phylogenies,
we observed a correlation between diversity of protein
architecture and the phylogenetic patterning. We also
believe that the diversification of the ePKs happened a
long time ago.
The analysis of the sequence domain data from Pfam
[96] showed that approximately 30% of S. mansoni ePKs
are multi-domain proteins containing various regulatory
and signaling domains tethered to catalytic kinase
domains (Figures 6 and 7). It is known that the distinct
protein architectures reflect functional differences among
proteins [32]. Hence, understanding the mechanisms that
generate such diverse repertoire of protein architectures
is essential to the comprehension of the biological function of the ePKs. Furthermore, we observed in ePKs of S.
mansoni some unusual architecture that probably occurs
by domain fusion and recruitment (see some examples

construct a distance-based phylogenetic tree using PHYLIP programs. Some ePK were excluded from the tree after filtered the alighments to
keep proteins with 30% to 98% pairwise sequence identity. The major ePK groups are color coded and include: CaMK (dark blue), CMGC

and regulators in this parasite.
The most common Pfam accessory domains found in
S. mansoni kinases are Pkinase_C (Pfam: PF00433) all
found in the AGC group; C1_1 (Pfam: PF00130) found
in the AGC and TKL groups; SH2 (PF00017) all found

in the TK group; and SH3 (Pfam: PF00018) found in TK
and TKL groups. These domains are commonly found
in protein kinase families as we observed in other species from KinBase [15].
More than 40% of S. mansoni AGC group have the PKinase_C domain associated with the catalytic domain. The

Figure 7 Accessory Domains. Representative domain organizations of some S. mansoni ePKs belonging to the TKL, Other, TK and, RGC groups
are shown. Each protein ID and classification is shown below each image. Abbreviations followed are: PK_domain (Protein kinase domain), RBD
(Raf-like Ras-binding domain), C1_1 (Phorbol esters/diacylglycerol binding domain), SH3_1 (Src homology 3 domain), PBD (P21-Rho-binding

ligand binding region). The protein domain architectures were generated using DOG 1.0 [111] based on the Pfam domain limits [96].

C1_1 domain is conserved in N-terminal regions of all
PKC proteins of S. mansoni (Figure 6) and has been
shown to bind PE (phorbol esters) and DAG (diacylglycerol). DAG is an important second messenger and Phorbol esters are analogues of DAG [32,96]. The C1_1
domain is present in one or two copies depending on the
isozyme of PKC (Figure 6). cNMP_binding is a N-terminal
domain of PKG proteins that bind cyclic nucleotides
(cAMP or cGMP) to relieve the inhibition of the catalytic
domain [15,35]. The AKT protein of S. mansoni

(Smp_162120) has an unusual domain combination
(Figure 6) as the two C-terminal domains (Glutaredoxin
and Na_K-ATPase) are not found in D. melanogaster, C.
elegans, M. musculus and H. sapiens.
CASK is a member of the CaMK group and plays a
key role in establishing inter-cellular contacts and plasticity at cellular junctions [54]. The accessory domains
found in S. mansoni CASK protein (L27 and PDZ
domains, which serve as protein interaction modules,
SH3, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase domains) are

Andrade et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:215

conserved in higher eukaryotes. However, the UPF0061
(Pfam: PF02696) is uncharacterized [96] and possesses
an unusual domain found in the C-terminal region of S.
mansoni CASK protein (Figure 6). The long protein
kinase MLCK (Figure 5a) possesses a large number of Ig
repeats (I-set, V-set and Ig) that, in other species, are
involved in a variety of functions, including cell-cell
recognition, cell-surface receptors, muscle structure and
the immune system [96], and fn3 repeats, that is an
approximately 100 amino acid domain commonly found
in a variety of organisms.
The CMGC and CK1 groups have none or a few accessory domains in S. mansoni. However, it is known that
small regions in these proteins play an important role in
recognizing and binding to the substrate [97,98]. For
example, the CD domain (common docking domain) is a
C-terminal region of MAPK proteins composed of a set of
negatively charged amino acids that is used to anchor protein activators (such as STE proteins), substrates (such as
MAPKAPK) and inactivating proteins (such as MAPK
phosphatases) [99]. Thus, this region governs a series of
signal transduction in the cascade of reactions of MAPKs.
Other regions, including the ED (ERK docking) site, working with the CD domain and ensuring specificity and
interaction strength [99].
PBD (p21-Rho-binding) and C-terminal CNH domain
are usually found in the STE20 families (Figure 6). PBD
binds to cdc42-GTPases activating the signaling cascade
which act upstream in the MAPK cascade. The CNH
domain interacts with the small GTPase and regulating
the actin cytoskeleton [96].
The SH3 and SH2 (Pfam: PF00018 and PF00017, respectively) domains are common found in CTK proteins. SH2
function as regulatory modules of intracellular signaling
cascades and it was found in eight out of 19 S. mansoni
CTKs. Fer PTK is usually composed of three domains,
FHC domain, SH2, and C-terminal kinase domain as it
occurs in Fer proteins of H. sapiens, M. musculus, and
D. melanogaster. However, the S. mansoni Fer protein
(SmFes - Smp_164810) [86] and the 42 Fer proteins of
C. elegans seems to have lost the N-terminal FHC domain
(Figure 7). RTKs are characterized by an extracellular

domains, a membrane spanning segment and an intracellular kinase domain [32]. The extracellular ligand binding
domain of EGFR and InsR proteins are composed of two
receptor_L sandwiching a Furin_like domain (Figure 7).
SmVKR is composed of an unusual extracellular Venus
flytrap module (VFT) linked through a single transmembrane domain to an intracellular tyrosine catalytic domain
similar to that of the insulin receptor and a putative function in reproduction and development was observed [81].
Other extracellular domains found in S. mansoni
are Ephrin_Ibd (Pfam: PF01404) in the Ephrin recptors
(Eph) and Ig domains (Pfam: PF00047) in CCK4 proteins
(Additional file 1).
In conclusion, the protein architecture, including the
accessory domains, may indicate potential protein partners. Signaling roles of schistosome specificities or unusual
architectures are of special biological interest.

Conclusions
This study allowed us to identify and classify 252 ePKs
encoded in the predicted proteome of S. mansoni.
Together, these proteins represent 1.9% of the proteome
and indicate that protein phosphorylation is an important
mechanism for regulating the complex life cycle of the
parasite. We improve the functional annotation of 40% of
S. mansoni ePKs (Table 3) by applying a phylogenetic framework. Moreover, it was possible to gain insights into
kinase function once 94% of the S. mansoni ePKinome
had previously an unknown function. S. mansoni has proteins in each ePKs group. Most of them are clearly clustered with known kinases from other eukaryotes with no
family being exclusively found or expanded in S. mansoni. Some proteins are not clustered with the main ePK
family as the catalytic domain is truncate, indicating that
the current gene/protein predictions require further
refinement. Proteins were mentioned as potential targets
for drug design and development as they may play an
essential function in the parasite. Furthermore new and
effective drugs bind PKs close but not in the ATP site
and occlude ATP access to the kinase to retard enzyme
activity [17]. So, proteins of S. mansoni with a sequence
highly similar to host proteins can be used as protein

found in S. mansoni can be used for constructing more
specific S. mansoni inhibitors. Moreover, as we continue
this work, we will highlight the biochemical and physiological adaptations of S. mansoni in response to diverse
environments during parasite development, vector interaction, and host infection.

[taxid: 6239], Brugia malayi [taxid: 6279], and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [taxid: 4932]. The S. mansoni predicted
proteome data was downloaded from SchistoDB, version
[2.0] [29], which contains the original gene and genomic
information provided by the Wellcome Trust Institute
and described elsewhere [26]. Datasets of protein kinases
from the other organisms were downloaded from the
kinase database at Sugen/Salk - KinBase [15], except for
Brugia malayi, which was retrieved from KEGG [100].
Functional Classification

Functional classification of protein kinases into groups,
families, and subfamilies followed the proposed hierarchy
described elsewhere [12,13,32]. Potential protein kinases of
S. mansoni were identified and characterized by combined
approaches based on sequence similarity and phylogenetic
relationships. These proteins were first identified by similarity to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) as described
below. Also based on sequence similarity, each predicted
protein kinase was manually annotated by integrating data
from InterProScan [101] and reverse PSI-BLAST (rpsblast)
[102] output searches into Artemis [103]. Further analysis
was performed by HMMs searching for non-catalytic
(accessory) domains associated to the conserved catalytic
domain of protein kinases based on data available at the
Protein families database - Pfam [96]. Functional classification was also devised based on the literature and on the
assumption of a broad conservation of the molecular functions. Phylogenetic analyses of the ePK kinases groups performed in the present work corroborated this classification
as well as supported new functional assignments for previously uncharacterized proteins (see below).

Amino acid sequences corresponding to the conserved
catalytic domain (Pfam: PF0069 or PF07714) of each
group of protein kinases were separately aligned using the
default parameters of MAFFT [30]. Multiple sequence
alignments were filtered to keep proteins sharing 50% to
90% pairwise sequence identity using the decreased redundancy tool [104] and manually edited to remove ambiguous regions using BioEdit [105]. Final alignments were
used in phylogenetic reconstructions through multiple
programs available in the Phylogeny Inference Package PHYLIP, version 3.69 [31]. Initially, 1000 random datasets
(replicates) were created for each alignment using seqboot
with default parameters. For each dataset, it was calculated
a distance matrix under the JTT model with gamma-distributed sites by protdist. Next, phylogenies were estimated
from distance matrix data adopting the Fitch-Margoliash
criterion as implemented in fitch. Finally, the results from
the random datasets were summarized by consense, which
computes consensus trees by the majority-rule consensus
tree method. Phylogenetic trees were visualized and edited
using the Tree Figure Drawing Tool - FigTree, version
1.3.1 [106]. Nodes with at least 80% bootstrap values were
considered to support functional prediction.
