Abstract
Background: Based on its distribution in the brain, ecto-nucleoside triphosphate
diphosphohydrolase 3 (NTPDase3) may play a role in the hypothalamic regulation of homeostatic
systems, including feeding, sleep-wake behavior and reproduction. To further characterize the
morphological attributes of NTPDase3-immunoreactive (IR) hypothalamic structures in the rat
brain, here we investigated: 1.) The cellular and subcellular localization of NTPDase3; 2.) The
effects of 17β-estradiol on the expression level of hypothalamic NTPDase3; and 3.) The effects of
NTPDase inhibition in hypothalamic synaptosomal preparations.
Methods: Combined light- and electron microscopic analyses were carried out to characterize the
cellular and subcellular localization of NTPDase3-immunoreactivity. The effects of estrogen on
hypothalamic NTPDase3 expression was studied by western blot technique. Finally, the effects of
NTPDase inhibition on mitochondrial respiration were investigated using a Clark-type oxygen
electrode.
Results: Combined light- and electron microscopic analysis of immunostained hypothalamic slices
revealed that NTPDase3-IR is linked to ribosomes and mitochondria, is predominantly present in
excitatory axon terminals and in distinct segments of the perikaryal plasma membrane.
Immunohistochemical labeling of NTPDase3 and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) indicated that
γ-amino-butyric-acid- (GABA) ergic hypothalamic neurons do not express NTPDase3, further
suggesting that in the hypothalamus, NTPDase3 is predominantly present in excitatory neurons.
We also investigated whether estrogen influences the expression level of NTPDase3 in the
ventrobasal and lateral hypothalamus. A single subcutaneous injection of estrogen differentially
increased NTPDase3 expression in the medial and lateral parts of the hypothalamus, indicating that

this enzyme likely plays region-specific roles in estrogen-dependent hypothalamic regulatory
mechanisms. Determination of mitochondrial respiration rates with and without the inhibition of
NTPDases confirmed the presence of NTPDases, including NTPDase3 in neuronal mitochondria
and showed that blockade of mitochondrial NTPDase functions decreases state 3 mitochondrial
respiration rate and total mitochondrial respiratory capacity.
Conclusion: Altogether, these results suggest the possibility that NTPDases, among them
NTPDase3, may play an estrogen-dependent modulatory role in the regulation of intracellular
availability of ATP needed for excitatory neuronal functions including neurotransmission.

Background
Purinergic intercellular signaling has received much attention during the past decade. It has been known for some
time that nucleotide-triphosphates, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), are not only energy carriers: ATP, for
example, is a substrate for the production of its hydrolytic
derivatives (ADP, AMP and adenosine) that are the specific ligands of different purinergic receptors (e.g., P2X,
P2Y, P1) [1]. In fact, recent data suggest that purinergic signaling might be one of the first biological signaling systems that evolved during the phylogenesis [2]. The
specific ligands of the relatively wide array of purinergic
receptors are provided by the ATP-hydrolyzing activity of
transmembrane ectonucleotidase enzymes (NTPDases)
and 5'-ectonucleotidase. Of the known ectonucleotidases,
NTPDase1-3 have been identified in the rat brain.
NTPDase1 is widely expressed in neurons, glia and
endothelial cells [3], while NTPDase2 was mainly found
in the germinal zones of the rat brain, and is thought to
play a role in neural development and differentiation [4].
NTPDase3 was cloned in 1998 by Smith and Kirley [5]; In
1998, Chadwick and Frischauf [6] demonstrated that
NTPDase3 mRNA is most abundant in the brain and pancreas. The first description of the localization and distribution of NTPDase3 in the rat brain [7] has been recently
published. In the latter study, NTPDase3 immunoreactivity (NTPDase3-IR) was only found in neuronal structures.
The vast majority of IR profiles were axon-like neuronal
processes concentrated in midline brain regions, with
highest frequency in the hypothalamus, thalamus and the
midbrain. Immunoreactive neuronal perikarya were only
found in the lateral hypothalamic nucleus (LHN) and
arcuate nucleus (AN). Based on those results, it has been
suggested that, because of the high degree of region-specific distribution of immunoreactive profiles, NTPDase3
may play a role in one or more of the regulatory mechanisms of food-intake, sleep-wake behavior and reproductive physiology. While that previous light microscopic
mapping of NTPDase3-IR in the rat brain provided useful
information for further studies on purinergic signaling,
understanding the cellular role of this enzyme warranted
further determination of its subcellular localization and
function. Therefore, here we characterized the intracellular localization of NTPDase3 in the hypothalamus of

adult male rats. Electron microscopic results indicated the
presence of NTPDase3-IR in neuronal perikarya and excitatory nerve terminals, but not in other (glial, vascular)
cell types. To determine whether NTPDase3 is differentially or ubiquitously expressed in excitatory and/or
inhibitory neuronal structures, we examined the possible
co-localization of NTPDase3 with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD, the rate-limiting enzyme of the inhibitory
neurotransmitter GABA) by means of immunohistochemistry. Considering that the ventrobasal hypothalamus is
highly estrogen responsive, we also tested whether or not
17β-estradiol (E2) influences the expression level of
NTPDase3 in hypothalamic tissue homogenates obtained
from ovariectomized and ovariectomized plus E2-treated
female rats. Finally, morphological indications of the
presence of NTPDase3 in neuronal mitochondria implied
a functional role for this enzyme in mitochondrial energy
(ATP) production. Therefore, we also examined the effects
of NTPDase inhibition on mitochondrial respiration in
hypothalamic synaptosomal preparations.

Methods
Sprague-Dawley male or female (as indicated below) rats
were used for each study. Following the guidelines laid
down by the NIH, the use of animals was approved by the
respective University Committees on Animal Use at Yale
University and Szent Istvan University Faculty of Veterinary Sciences.
Animals, tissue fixation and immunolabeling
Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight: 230–
250 g; vendor: Charles-River Laboratories, Inc.) were
used. Animals were kept under standard laboratory conditions, with tap water and regular rat chow ad libitum in a
12-h light, 12-h dark cycle. For histological studies, brains
of anesthetized (intramuscular injection of a mixture of
200 mg/kg ketamine and 6.6 mg/kg xylazine) ovariectomized (ovx) animals (n = 12) were fixed by transcardial
perfusion of a mixture of 5% paraformaldehyde and 2%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 molar phosphate buffer and stored
in 4% paraformaldehyde until tissue processing. For the
electron microscopic analysis of subcellular localization
of NTPDase3-IR, hypothalami were sectioned and 50 μm
thick slices were immunostained for NTPDase3 using an

affinity purified rabbit anti-NTPDase3 primary antibody.
Omission of the primary antibody resulted in no detectable staining. (The rabbit anti-NTPDase3 [KLH14] primary
antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Terence Kirley. Testing the specificity of this polyclonal antibody was
described in details by Belcher et al. [7]). Immunostained
sections were then processed (osmicated, dehydrated,
embedded, sectioned for electron microscopy and contrast stained) for electron microscopic analysis as
described in an earlier study [8]. In order to eliminate
potential pitfalls arising from the possible precipitation of
lead citrate, in addition to the general protocols we also
examined ultra-thin sections that were only contraststained with uranyl-acetate during the dehydration process (1% uranyl-acetate in 70% ethanol for 60 minutes),
but omitting subsequent treatment with lead citrate. For
morphological characterization of synapses we considered the guidelines provided by Colonnier [9] and Palay
and Chan-Palay [10].
To study the possible expression of NTPDase3 in GABAergic inhibitory neurons, we assessed whether NTPDase3
and GAD are co-expressed in hypothalamic neurons.
Adjacent hypothalamic slices were used for the comparison of GAD (rabbit anti-GAD primary antibody, dil.:
1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Switzerland) and
NTPDase3 immunolabelings by the previously described
"mirror technique" [11]. In short, adjacent sections were
arranged in pairs and one section of each pair was immunostained for NTPDase3 as described above, whereas their
counterparts were single immunolabeled for GAD. Immunolabeling for GAD followed the standard immunohistochemistry protocol referred to above with the addition of
a negative control experiment when the primary antibody
for GAD was omitted. Omission of the primary antibody
resulted in no detectable staining. After the visualization
of immunoreactive material by nickel-intensified diaminobenzidine reaction, pairs of sections were thoroughly
rinsed in 0.1 molar phosphate buffer and mounted with
their matching surfaces on the upper side. Sections were
then dehydrated through increasing ethanol concentrations and coverslipped.
Focusing the microscope on the upper surface of each section, digital images were captured at various magnifications and corresponding areas were determined based on
the pattern of vasculature and matching cells halves
through the overlay of images using Adobe Photoshop v.
7.0 software. After the computer-assisted reconstruction
of the histological view, GAD-IR neurons were counted
and potential NTPDase3-labeling of the matching cellhalves was searched.

Western blot studies
Female animals were used for these studies. Rats were ovariectomized (ovx) and kept under standard laboratory
conditions (as indicated above) for seven days. One week
after ovariectomy, control animals were sacrificed (and
processed as described below), while the rest of the animals received a single subcutaneous injection of 17betaestradiol (23 μg/100 g body weight; Sigma, water-soluble,
cat. no. E4389). Estrogen-primed rats were then sacrificed
2–26 hours after receiving the estrogen in two-hour intervals to determine the temporal changes in blood estrogen
concentrations and hypothalamic NTPDase3 expression
(n = 5 for each group). After quick decapitation, a tissue
block containing the AN and LHN was excised, following
the coordinates of the rat brain atlas [12] as follows: A
coronal slice of the entire rat brain was cut with a rostral
border at anterioposterior level 2.12 mm behind the
bregma (just behind the caudal border of the optic chiasm) and a caudal border at anterioposterior level 4.52
mm behind the bregma (just before the caudal tip of the
mamillary body). Slices were divided into two halves
along the midsagittal plane. The dorsal border of the tissue block was cut along a horizontal line dorsally tangential to the third ventricle and the remaining cortical tissue
and optic tract were removed. The remaining tissue block
was further divided into two halves along a sagittal plane
passing through the fornix. Thus, we obtained two tissue
blocks from the medial part of the hypothalamus containing the AN, and two from the lateral part containing the
LHN from each animal. Tissue blocks were then homogenized in (in mM) 20 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 NaCl, 1 PMSF,
1 EGTA, 1 EDTA, 2.5 sodium pyrophosphate, 1-betaglicerol phosphate, and 1 Na3VO4 plus 1 mg/ml Pefabloc,
10 μg/ml leupeptin 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate.
Homogenates were sonicated for 5 sec a total of 5 times
and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min at
2°C. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA
protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Western blotting
and densitometric analysis were performed by standard
protocols [13,14]. Membranes were blocked with 5%
nonfat dry milk for 1 hr in TBS-T and incubated with
appropriate antisera (affinity purified rabbit antiNTPDase3, KLH14, as described by Belcher et al. [7]).
Immunoreactive bands were visualized onto preflashed xray film by enhanced chemiluminescence. Multiple exposures of each blot were collected, and those in the linear
range of the film were used for densitometric analysis.
Optical densities were calculated as arbitrary units after
local area background subtraction, normalized to the protein concentrations of samples and to the density of controls. Results are reported as fold changes relative to
control. All data that have been presented are representative of at least three independent experiments.

Serum estradiol concentrations were determined from
each animal used for the western blot studies by 3H-RIA,
as described by Csernus [15].
Brain synaptosomal preparation and measurement of
oxygen consumption
Male animals (n = 8) were used for the determination of
mitochondrial respiration rates. Animals were anesthetized with isofluorane and brains were removed after
quick decapitation. Hipothalami were dissected and cut
into two halves. One side was always used as control
(incubated in vehicle), while the contralateral side was
used to determine the effects of the NTPDase inhibitor
suramin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The ability of
suramin to block the enzymatic function of NTPDases has
been previously reported [16]. Samples were homogenized in isolation buffer (pH 7.2; 215 mM mannitol, 75
mM sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EGTA,
20 mM HEPES). The homogenate was spun at 1300 × g for
3 min, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was
resuspended with isolation buffer and spun again at 1300
× g for 3 min. The two sets of supernatants from each sample were topped off with isolation buffer and spun at
13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded,
and the step was repeated. After this second spin at 13,000
× g, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were
resuspended with isolation buffer without EGTA and
spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The final synaptosomal
pellet was resuspended with 50 μl of isolation buffer without EGTA [17,18]. Protein concentration of mitochondrial suspensions was determined with a BCA protein
assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). As mentioned above, one
half of the samples collected (i.e., the right side of the
hypothalamus) was treated with suramin at a final concentration of 20 μM followed by a 30 minutes incubation
of all samples at 37°C just before the measurements. Control sides were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C in vehicle. Mitochondrial respirations were assessed using a
Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments,
Norfolk, UK) at 37° with pyruvate and malate (5 and 2.5
mM; State 2 respiration) as oxidative substrates in respiration buffer (215 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.1%
fatty acid-free BSA, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl, 2.5 mM
KH2PO4, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). For analysis of
ADP dependent respiration (state 3 respiration), ADP was
added after the addition of oxidative substrates. After the
addition of oligomycin (state 4 respiration), mitochondrial respiration was measured as increased fatty acidinduced respiration (Palmitate 150 μM). Total uncoupled
respiration was also measured after the addition of the
protonophore FCCP (carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone, 1 μM). The results are expressed
as nmols of oxygen consumed per minute per mg protein.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted with a Student's t test
or by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's Multiple Comparison
Test as appropriate. Data were analyzed with Excel (Microsoft) and GraphPad Prism version 4 (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA)

Results
Light- and electron microscopy
The hypothalamic distribution of NTPDase3-IR found in
the present study was consistent with that described in an
earlier report [7]. Light microscopic analysis of IR profiles
showed NTPDase3-IR cell bodies and neural-like processes in the LHN and AN, whereas in the rest of the
hypothalamus only immunostained cell processes were
found, many of which were morphologically closely associated with the vasculature (Figure 1). A more detailed
examination revealed that cellular staining occurred either
in the form of cytoplasmic staining predominantly aggregated in particle-like dots (Figure 2A) or as plasma membrane-associated punctate structures (Figure 2B).
Correlated electron microscopic analysis of neuronal
membranes showed that NTPDase3-IR is present at certain well-demarked segments of the plasma membrane
(Figure 2Bb1).

Electron microscopic analysis clarified that labeled neuronal processes comprise both dendrites (Figure 2C1) and
axons (Figure 2C2). In dendrites, cytosolic, ribosomeassociated, as well as mitochondrial labelings were
detected (Figure 2D1–D2). In contrast, in myelinated
axons and axon terminals only mitochondrial immunoreactivity was observed. NTPDase3-IR was found near asymmetric (therefore considered putative excitatory), but not
symmetric (inhibitory), synaptic membrane specializations (presynaptic axon terminals, dendrites and dendritic
spines). The ultrastructural appearance of the grainy cytoplasmic- and dot-like or line-shaped membrane-associated immunoreactive material was also investigated in
neuronal perikarya of the LHN and AN.
Ultrastructural examination of the cytoplasmic labeling
revealed that part of the cytoplasmic IR particles observed
in light microscope are associated with ribosomes, some
of which are free cytoplasmic, but the majority of which
are linked to the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, we
found NTPDase3-IR in the mitochondrial matrix or
closely associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane (Figure 2D1–D2). Immunolabeled mitochondria
were typically linked to asymmetric (putative excitatory)
synaptic membrane specializations, present either in presynaptic terminals or at the post-synaptic side, in dendritic spines. Labeled mitochondria were also detected in
the perikaryal cytoplasm, frequently concentrated in the
vicinity of the plasma membrane.

that NTPDase3 may be predominantly expressed in excitatory neurons of the hypothalamus.
Western blot; Estrogen effects on hypothalamic
NTPDase3 expression
Since NTPDase3-IR perikarya were only detected in two of
the hypothalamic regions, i.e., the AN and LHN, isolated
medial and lateral hypothalamic tissue samples were collected from ovariectomized and estrogen-primed animals,
and examined by western blot analysis for the expression
level of NTPDase3 (Figure 4). Four immunoreactive
bands (~160–170 kDa, 82–85 kDa, 60 kDa and 37 kDa)
were detected using the rabbit anti-NTPDase3 affinitypurified polyclonal antibody (KLH14, kindly provided by
Dr. Terence Kirley, University of Cincinnati, OH, USA). In

processes (B, arrowheads) were frequently seen in close

Immunolabeling for NTPDase3 and GAD
Of the 320 NTPDase3-IR cell bodies examined, 29 contained nuclei with invaginations of the nuclear membrane. Since GABAergic neurons of the AN possess
infolded cell nuclei [19,20], we assessed whether
NTPDase3 is expressed in GABAergic (and thus inhibitory) cells. We compared the hypothalamic localization of
GAD and NTPDase3 (Figure 3). None of the 2540 GADIR neurons examined contained NTPDase3, indicating

a previous study, where this antibody was tested and used
for western blot studies, multiple immunoreactive bands
were found using COS cell membranes, and one IR band
was detected using rat brain thalamus membranes from
ovariectomized rats [7]. It is, therefore, not surprising that
using homogenates of rat hypothalami (a brain area
highly sensitive to estrogen) more IR bands were found,
likely representing distinct structural and functional
forms of the enzyme. Of the listed bands, the 85 kDa protein is considered as the fully glycosilated form of the protein, while the 160–170 kDa and 60 kDa values
correspond to the dimeric form of the enzyme and the
core protein. Here we focused on the analysis of the
expression level of the 85 kDa protein. A time- and estrogen dependent increase in NTPDase3 levels was found in
both (medial and lateral) selected hypothalamic areas
(Figure 5); however, the temporal changes in NTPDase3
levels displayed distinct patterns. In samples including the
LHN, NTPDase3 levels increased significantly 4–12 hrs
after a single subcutaneous injection of E2, and gradually
returned to nearly control (ovx) levels by 16–26 hrs after
E2 treatment (Figure 5A). In contrast, temporal changes in
medial hypothalamic samples including the AN showed
an initial increase in NTPDase3 expression between 6–10
hrs after E2 treatment, followed by a sharp decrease to control level, and again followed by a second rise between

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/31

22–26 hrs after E2 treatment (Figure 5B). Thus, in the lateral hypothalamus a single-, whereas in the medial
hypothalamus a double-peaked curve was determined,
suggesting that NTPDase3 expression in the hypothalamus is regulated by E2, however, its role in the two
hypothalamic regions might be different.
Mitochondrial respiration measurements
NTPDase3 has been known as plasma membrane-incorporated ATP hydrolyzing enzyme with its active domain
outside of the cell, thus converting ATP to ADP and AMP
in the extracellular space [5]. According to current knowledge, the hydrolysis of P2 nucleotide agonists (nucleoside
tri- and di-phosphates) to respective monophosphates by
NTPDases is coupled to the hydrolysis of the nucleoside
monophosphates by 5'-ectonucleotidase (also described
as CD73) to generate adenosine, which can activate P1
adenosine receptors. Therefore, our finding that
NTPDase3-IR is present in neuronal mitochondria was
intriguing and warranted functional support of the morphological results. To study the functional link between
NTPDase3 and mitochondria, we investigated the effect of
the NTPDase inhibitor, suramin, on mitochondrial functions. It is important to note that to the best of our knowledge, there is no selective NTPDase (including NTPDase3)
inhibitor available on the market. Muller et al. [16] compared and characterized the ability of polyoxomethalates
(the best known NTPDase inhibitors) to block the functions of the different NTPDases (and purinergic receptors). Based on those results, we chose to use suramin,
which was described as the most potent NTPDase3 inhibitor among the compounds examined, however, it also
inhibits other NTPDases. Therefore, in the present study
the effects of suramin treatments are considered as general
inhibitory effects on NTPDases, including NTPDase3,
until a fully selective NTPDase3 blocker becomes available. Inhibition of NTPDases by suramin had a significant
inhibitory effect on State 3 mitochondrial respiration
(Figure 6A) (45.05 ± 4.9 nmol O2/mg protein/min with
suramin versus 65.1 ± 6.6 of control; P < 0.05) indicating
that a decrease in ATP-ADP conversion occurred in mitochondria after NTPDase inhibition. All other respiration
states were unaffected by the blockade of NTPDase function. However, the total mitochondrial respiratory capacity decreased as well (Figure 6B) (87.8 ± 5.5 nmol O2/mg
protein/min in control synaptosomes versus 57.7 ± 6.5
nmol O2/mg protein/min (P < 0.05) in synaptosomes
incubated with suramin), suggesting that mitochondrial
NTPDase activity likely influences oxygen-consuming
biochemical processes in the mitochondrial matrix.

Discussion
Light- and electron microscopy
An earlier mapping study [7], reported that in the rat
brain, NTPDase3 is present exclusively in neurons, mostly

in neuronal processes. In the present study, we confirmed
those previous results, showing IR cell bodies localized in
the LHN and AN, while in the rest of the hypothalamus
only cell processes were observed, frequently in close
apposition to the wall of hypothalamic vessels. The latter
observations raise the possibility that at least part of
NTPDase3-IR hypothalamic cells might be involved in the
mediation of peripheral humoral signals by either the
release of neuronal end-products into the blood circulation, and/or, intracellular events of such neurons could be
affected by peripheral humoral factors through a yet unidentified NTPDase3-mediated intracellular signaling system.
Our light- and correlated electron microscopic studies
showed that NTPDase3-IR is present at certain welldemarked segments of the plasma membrane. This finding is consonant with the generally accepted view of NTPDases being transmembrane proteins and hydrolyzing
phosphorylated nucleotides outside of the cell. With
respect to the cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, part of the
cytoplasmic IR particles was associated with ribosomes,
some of which were free cytoplasmic, but the majority of
which were linked to the endoplasmic reticulum. This
finding is not surprising in light of the fact that the amino
acid sequence used for the generation of the antibody is
part of the core protein; therefore, it is immunohistochemically detectable readily after translation. Another
source of immunoreactive cytoplasmic particles appeared
to be linked to mitochondria.

The detection of NTPDase3-IR in the mitochondrial
matrix or closely associated with the inner mitochondrial
membrane is probably the most intriguing finding of this
study. Since immunolabeled mitochondria were typically
found near asymmetric (putative excitatory) synaptic
membrane specializations, it is reasonable to assume that
mitochondrial NTPDase3 activity is functionally linked to
excitatory, rather than inhibitory neuronal functions.
Immunolabeling for NTPDase3 and GAD
NTPDase3-IR was found in the vicinity of asymmetric
(therefore presumably excitatory), but not symmetric,
synaptic membrane specializations (presynaptic axon terminals, dendrites and dendritic spines). Additionally, by
immunolabeling for GAD and NTPDase3 and applying
the well-known mirror-technique, we found that none of
the GAD-IR neurons examined contained NTPDase3.
Although we have not examined all hypothalamic synapses and GAD-IR neurons for the localization of
NTPDase3, and some other, non-GABAergic neurons
(e.g., dopaminergic) that are inhibitory in function may
also express NTPDase3, our present findings still suggest
that the vast majority of hypothalamic NTPDase3 is
expressed in excitatory neurons.

In dendrites, free cytosolic (a possible soluble form),
ribosome-associated, as well as mitochondrial labelings
were detected. In contrast, in myelinated axons and axon
terminals only mitochondrial immunoreactivity was
observed. While the versatility in the appearance of
immunoreactive material in dendrites may refer to the cel-

more likely that the distinct bands observed represent different maturational forms of the enzyme. In this study, we
detected NTPDase3-IR linked to multiple subcellular
structures (plasma membrane, ribosomes, endoplasmic
reticulum) including neuronal mitochondria. Additionally, we provided evidence for NTPDase-activity in synaptosomal preparations. Therefore, it is also possible that
one or more of the protein-forms detected on western
blots represent functional forms of the protein adapted or
adjusted to the microenvironment or functional attributes
of the cell organelles.

Assessment of NTPDase3-levels in the hypothalamus
of female rats. A: Sample collection. Tissue blocks of the
medial part of the hypothalamus (Med-HT) containing the
arcuate nucleus and the lateral part of the hypothalamus (LatHT) containing the lateral hypothalamic nucleus were
excised as follows: A coronal slice of the entire rat brain was
cut with a rostral border at anterioposterior level 2.12 mm
behind the bregma (just behind the caudal border of the
optic chiasm) and a caudal border at anterioposterior level
4.52 mm behind the bregma (just before the caudal tip of the
mamillary body). Slices were cut into two halves along the
midsagittal plane. The dorsal border of the tissue block was
cut along a horizontal line dorsally tangential to the third
ventricle and the remaining cortical tissue and optic tract
were removed. The remaining tissue block was further cut
into two halves along a sagittal plane passing through the fornix. Thus, we obtained two tissue blocks from both the
medial and lateral parts of the hypothalamus from each animal. B: Representative image showing NTPDase3-immunoreactive material in the Lat-HT and Med-HT four hours after a
single subcutaneous injection of 17β-estradiol. Four immunoreactive bands were detected using homogenates of whole
tissue samples. The 82–85 kDa molecular weight form of the
enzyme, generally considered as the fully functional form,
was further analyzed. Note the difference between the densities of the 82–85 kDa bands of the Lat-HT and Med-HT samples.

lular processes of NTPDase3-metabolism (biosynthesis,
protein maturation, explantation and organelle-linked
function), the mitochondrial presence of this enzyme in
axons and axon terminals suggests that the modulation of
mitochondrial ATP-levels required to fuel neuronal output may be, at least to some extent, regulated by
NTPDase3 activity.
Estrogen effects on hypothalamic NTPDase3 expression
As mentioned earlier, multiple NTPDase3-IR bands were
detected in western blot studies using rat hypothalamus
homogenates. This phenomenon may indicate that there
is "incomplete" processing of the enzyme, however, it is

Since the neuroendocrine hypothalamus is highly E2responsive, it was reasonable to assume that E2 may influence the expression level of NTPDase3 within this brain
area. Therefore, in a pilot study we investigated whether
E2-treatment of ovx animals affects NTPDase3-levels in
tissue blocks containing the entire hypothalamus. That
study showed that a single subcutaneous injection of E2
results in significantly increased levels of NTPDase3
(unpublished observation). Those results prompted us to
examine and analyze the temporal changes in NTPDase3expression in lateral- and medial hypothalamic tissue
samples as described above. The present findings indicate
that in response to a single subcutaneous injection of E2,
NTPDase3 expression increases in just a few hours after
E2-treatment in both hypothalamic areas, however, the
pattern of temporal changes in the medial hypothalamus
differs from that observed in the lateral part of this brain
area. Since the mediobasal hypothalamus, including the
AN, is a major player in the biphasic (positive- and negative feedback) regulation of the gonadotrophin secretion
and release, it is reasonable to speculate that in the medial
part of the hypothalamus, NTPDase3 may be involved in
the estrogenic control of gonadotrophins. The idea of a
causal coincidence between the two peaks in NTPDase3
levels and the positive/negative gonadotrophin feedbacks
raises several questions. For example, a number of data
suggest that NTPDase3 may be involved in the hypothalamic regulation of gonadotrophin release. We have previously described that during the E2-induced
gonadotrophin surge, an E2-dependent synaptic reorganization on hypothalamic neurons occurs. This phenomenon we termed "phased synaptic remodeling", that shows
specific changes in the ratio of inhibitory/excitatory synapses during the two (positive- and negative-) states of the
gonadotrophin feedback control [21]. A sharp rise in the
number of excitatory synapses was observed at the time of
the E2-surge, and the formation of new synapses may very
well include ones equipped with NTPDase3-containing
mitochondria. This hypothesis is consonant with our
observation that inhibition of NTPDase activity decreases
state 3 mitochondrial respiration and the total mitochondrial respiratory capacity, ergo an increased amount of
mitochondrial NTPDase would well serve the energy-

Time-course of changes in hypothalamic NTPDase3-levels after a single subcutaneous injection of 17β-estradiol (E2)
Figure 5 (see previous page)
Time-course of changes in hypothalamic NTPDase3-levels after a single subcutaneous injection of 17β-estradiol (E2). Optical density measurements of the 82–85 kDa immunoreactive bands were analyzed in ovx animals and ovx plus
E2-treated animals 2–26 hours after a single subcutaneous injection of E2. Samples were taken in two-hours intervals after E2priming. A: Estrogen-treatment induced a sharp rise in NTPDase3-expression in lateral hypothalamic samples, reaching significantly elevated peak levels by four hrs. After the peak, a gradual decrease in NTPDase3-expression was observed reaching
nearly control ovx levels by 26 hrs. B: In medial hypothalamic samples, E2-treatment induced a gradual increase in NTPDase3levels with highest values observed at 10 hrs after E2-priming. This was followed by falling of NTPDase3-level that reached a
nadir at 18 hrs, followed by a second rise by 24–26 hrs. The difference in the time-course of changes in NTPDase3-levels
between the medial and lateral part of the hypothalamus suggests that NTPDase3 may serve region-specific functions in the
neuroendocrine hypothalamus. C: Mean E2 blood plasma concentrations measured after a single subcutaneous injection of E2

needs of a transient intensification in excitatory neuronal
activity.
Both medial and lateral hypothalamic functions are
known to involve mechanisms mediated by various purinoceptors, such as A1, P2X, and the activity of NTPDase3containing hypocretin-orexin neurons in the LHN is
directly influenced by such receptor actions [22-29]. Since
here we found neuronal membrane-linked NTPDase3-IR
in the AN/LHN, and E2 induced a transient increase in
NTPDase3-levels in both hypothalamic sites, it is also
possible that E2 increases the amount of membrane-incorporated NTPDase3 to transiently intensify purinergic
interneuronal signaling. Further studies are underway to
clarify this issue.

Determination of mitochondrial respiration rates in hypothaDetermination of mitochondrial respiration rates in
hypothalamic synaptosomes. Inhibition of ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-activity by Suramin
decreased oxygen consumption during state 3 mitochondrial
respiration (A), and also decreased the total mitochondrial
respiratory capacity (B).

In lateral hypothalamic samples, NTPDase3 levels peaked
at 4 hrs after E2-treatment followed by a gradual decrease,
and reached ovx levels by 26 hrs. It has been demonstrated by Belcher et al. [7] that LHN NTPDase3-containing cells are nearly all (96–97%) hypocretin-orexincontaining neurons. These neurons are known to be direct
modulators of the midbrain raphe serotonergic neurons
[30] to influence sleep-wake states. It is also known that E2
influences arousal mechanisms in many ways [31]. Thus,
it is possible that the mechanism through which E2 facilitates wakefulness involves increased NTPDase3-activity.
On the other hand, LHN hypocretin-orexin (plus
NTPDase3-IR) neurons are not only targets of E2, but also
that of the gastric hormone ghrelin; at the same time,
these neurons also represent the major excitatory input of
AN neuropeptide Y/Agouti-related protein-containing
cells whose activity is responsible for the initiation of food
intake. Changes in the functional intensity of this circuit
also involve synaptic remodeling [32]. It is therefore possible that in response to E2-treatment, LHN NTPDase3-IR
hypocretin-orexin-containing neurons intensify their
action on AN neuropeptide Y/Agouti-related protein-containing cells, thereby leading to increased NTPDase3 levels in both (medial and lateral) parts of the

hypothalamus. If this was the case, one could speculate
that the orexigenic effect of E2 may in some way involve
the action of NTPDase3.
Mitochondrial respiration measurements
It has been shown that interneuronal signaling is a highly
ATP-dependent, energy-demanding process [33]. To supply the energy needs of neurotransmission, ATP is produced and maintained in neuronal mitochondria in a
regulated fashion. We have previously proposed [34] that
one potential mechanism down-regulating mitochondrial
ATP production may involve uncoupling proteins
(UCPs), specifically UCP2, which was only found in
inhibitory neurons of the hypothalamus. However, the
specific mechanism involved in the regulation of mitochondrial ATP levels in excitatory hypothalamic neurons
is currently unknown. Therefore, the identification of
NTPDase3 in mitochondria in synaptic or perikaryal sites
of excitatory hypothalamic neurons might be the most
novel and intriguing finding of this study, and warrants
further experiments to elucidate the exact functional role
of mitochondrial NTPDase3 in neurotransmission.

To confirm our morphological findings, we isolated synaptosomes from hypothalamic tissue homogenates and
examined mitochondrial respiration in control versus
suramin (an NTPDase inhibitor) treated samples.
Suramin blockade of NTPDases reduced mitochondrial
oxygen consumption in state 3 mitochondrial respiration
by 30%, and also decreased the total mitochondrial respiratory capacity by 34%. These findings imply that induction of NTPDase activity in the mitochondria by
hydrolyzing ATP to ADP increases mitochondrial state 3
respiration and the total mitochondrial respiration capacity. It should be noted that the polyoxometalate suramin
is not a fully selective NTPDase3-inhibitor, as such inhibitors, to the best of our knowledge, for the 8 known NTPDases have not yet been found. However, suramin has
been shown to be a potent inhibitor of NTPDase3 and
other NTPDases [16], therefore the observed reduction in
oxygen consumption in hypothalamic synaptosomes can
be, at least in part, attributed to the inhibition of
NTPDase3. This idea is supported by previous results on
synaptosome fractions isolated from rat brain cortex and
striatum [35], and from hippocampal synaptosomes [36].
These studies report a transient accumulation of ADP after
addition of ATP followed by the subsequent metabolization of ADP to AMP and adenosine. As a result, the aforementioned studies argue against a considerable
contribution by NTPDase1 and/or NTPDase2 and suggest
that the observations would rather be compatible with a
neuronal expression of NTPDase3.
Based on the present findings, it is tempting to speculate
that an increase in the activity level of NTPDases

http://www.rbej.com/content/7/1/31

(NTPDase3?) may result in the exhaustion of mitochondria (and the parent cell), whereas partial inhibition of
NTPDases may be neuroprotective. Ongoing studies in
our laboratory test this hypothesis. The reported pharmacological effects of polyoxometalates, such as suramin,
seem to support this idea. For example, some data show
that NTPDase inhibition is also antidiabetic [37],
although the exact mechanisms through which the beneficial effects of NTPDase inhibitors act are unknown.
Therefore, the present results rise the possibility that in the
pancreas, inhibition of NTPDases (NTPDase3) may protect the insulin-producing beta cells from overt ATP consumption and consequential exhaustion.

Conclusion
Altogether, the combined morphological and functional
examination of neuronal NTPDase3-IR suggests a double
cellular role for this enzyme in the hypothalamus: 1. as
suggested earlier, the regulation of purinergic signaling via
the production of specific ligands (ADP and AMP), and 2.
the tuning of energy supply for (excitatory) neurotransmission by the hydrolysis of mitochondrial ATP.
