Abstract
Background: Glycolipid transfer protein is the prototypical and founding member of the new
GLTP superfamily distinguished by a novel conformational fold and glycolipid binding motif. The
present investigation provides the first insights into the organization, transcriptional status,
phylogenetic/evolutionary relationships of GLTP genes.
Results: In human cells, single-copy GLTP genes were found in chromosomes 11 and 12. The gene
at locus 11p15.1 exhibited several features of a potentially active retrogene, including a highly
homologous (~94%), full-length coding sequence containing all key amino acid residues involved in
glycolipid liganding. To establish the transcriptional activity of each human GLTP gene, in silico EST
evaluations, RT-PCR amplifications of GLTP transcript(s), and methylation analyses of regulator
CpG islands were performed using various human cells. Active transcription was found for
12q24.11 GLTP but 11p15.1 GLTP was transcriptionally silent. Heterologous expression and
purification of the GLTP paralogs showed glycolipid intermembrane transfer activity only for
12q24.11 GLTP. Phylogenetic/evolutionary analyses indicated that the 5-exon/4-intron
organizational pattern and encoded sequence of 12q24.11 GLTP were highly conserved in therian
mammals and other vertebrates. Orthologs of the intronless GLTP gene were observed in primates
but not in rodentiates, carnivorates, cetartiodactylates, or didelphimorphiates, consistent with
recent evolutionary development.
Conclusion: The results identify and characterize the gene responsible for GLTP expression in
humans and provide the first evidence for the existence of a GLTP pseudogene, while demonstrating
the rigorous approach needed to unequivocally distinguish transcriptionally-active retrogenes from
silent pseudogenes. The results also rectify errors in the Ensembl database regarding the
organizational structure of the actively transcribed GLTP gene in Pan troglodytes and establish the
intronless GLTP as a primate-specific, processed pseudogene marker. A solid foundation has been
established for future identification of hereditary defects in human GLTP genes.

Background
Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and related metabolites are
found ubiquitously in eukaryotes and mediate key functions involving cell membranes, including immune
responses, drug resistance, surface adhesion, neuroregeneration, differentiation, and apoptosis [1-6]. Glycolipid
transfer protein (GLTP) is a soluble protein (209 amino
acids; ~24 kDa) that can selectively transfer GSLs between
membranes [7-13]. GLTP has been implicated in the
Golgi-to-plasma membrane, nonvesicular trafficking of
glucosylceramide, a key intermediate in the synthesis of
higher GSLs and in cellular drug resistance [11,14,15]. In
order to bind glycolipid, GLTP utilizes an all α-helix conformation, arranged in a two-layer 'sandwich motif' containing no intramolecular disulfides, to form a single
glycolipid liganding site [16-18]. Comparative structural
analyses of GLTP in various GSL-free and GSL-complexed
forms, along with crystallographic B-factor distributions,
suggest that a cleft-like gating mechanism, involving conformational changes to two interhelical loops and one αhelix, facilitates entry and exit of the lipid chains in the
membrane-associated state. Acquisition of glycolipid
occurs via an adaptive recognition process involving a
sugar headgroup recognition center that forms multiple
hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts to selectively
anchor the sugar-amide moieties to amino acid side
chains of the protein surface as well as a 'molded-to-fit',
hydrophobic tunnel to accommodate the hydrocarbon
chains of the ceramide moiety [13,16-18].
The novel architecture of GLTP markedly contrasts the
conformational motifs of other lipid binding and transfer
proteins which generally are dominated by β-sheet, i.e. βgrooves/concave cups and β-barrels, or helical bundles
stabilized by multiple disulfide-bridges, i.e. saposin-folds.
Such proteins include sphingolipid activator proteins,
CD1 proteins, ceramide transfer protein, phosphoglyceride transfer proteins, other START-related proteins, nonspecific lipid transfer proteins, fatty acid binding proteins,
lipocalins, and plant lipid transfer proteins [13,16,17].
GLTP also forms a membrane targeting motif that differs
from those used by other important peripheral proteins,
i.e., C1, C2, PH, FYVE, and PX domains. The unique structural aspects of the glycolipid binding pocket and the
membrane interaction region of GLTP establish the GLTPfold as the prototype of the GLTP superfamily [19-22].
GLTP domains recently have been identified in other proteins, such as the ubiquitously-expressed phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) adaptor protein-2
(FAPP2) which is involved in vesicular trafficking from
the Golgi to the cell surface and glucosylceramide transfer
during GSL synthesis [23,24]. Other GLTP orthologs have
been linked to the programmed cell response induced by
stress in plants (e.g. ACD11) [25] and as part of the selfnonself recognition and compatibility response during

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/72

heterokaryon fusion in filamentous fungi (e.g. HET-C2)
[13,26].
The present study provides the first characterization of
genes encoding GLTP. In humans, single-copy GLTP genes
were located to chromosomes 11 and 12, encoding highly
homologous GLTPs (~94%). The GLTP gene at locus
11p15.1 exhibited several characteristic features of a
potentially active retrogene, affording the opportunity to
critically evaluate RT-PCR limitations for accurate determination of single-copy, pseudogene expression. Assessment of transcriptional activity by RT-PCR required
extensive controls to ensure accurate conclusions and was
aided by determination of the methylation status of 5'
UTR CpG islands as well as by comparative phylogenetic/
evolutionary analyses of human GLTP genes with other
vertebrate GLTP genes. The organizational pattern of the
transcribed human GLTP gene (5-exon/4-intron and exon
sizes) and the encoded GLTP amino acid sequence were
highly conserved among various therian mammals and
other vertebrates. In contrast, orthologs of the human
intronless GLTP gene were found only in primates (Pan,
Macaca) and were not present in rodentia (Mus, Rattus)
carnivora (Canis), cetartiodactyla (Sus, Bos), or didelphimorphia (Didelphis), consistent with recent evolutionary
development as a primate-specific, processed pseudogene.

Results
Organization of Human GLTP Genes
To identify the human gene(s) encoding GLTP, the
sequences of cDNAs that we previously cloned from GLTP
mRNA of human skin fibroblasts and glioma cells (GenBank AF209074, AY372530, AY372531, AY372532) were
used in BLAST searches of the NCBI Human Genome.
Highly homologous genomic DNA sequences were found
at loci on two different chromosomes: 12q24.11 of chromosome 12 (>99% identity) and 11p15.1 of chromosome 11 (~94% identity). Five separate sequences,
interspersed at the 12q24.11 locus, were identical with
five segments comprising the full-length GLTP cDNA ORF
(630 bases), suggesting the presence of a GLTP gene with
five exons separated by four introns (Figure 1). When
adjoined in 5'-to-3' fashion, the five exons encoded the
same 209 amino acid sequence that we previously determined for human GLTP by RT-PCR using purified mRNA
[16,27]. The first intron was substantially larger (21,530
bases) than the other three introns (1,023, 1,756, and
2,881 bases). All exon/intron boundaries were characterized by classic consensus nucleotide sequences expected
for splice sites, i.e. introns contained 5' GT and 3' AG
dinucleotides as well as upstream pyrimidine tracts [28].
The 5'-3' arrangement of the five exons, the presence of
classic intron dinucleotide sequences at all exon/intron
junctions, and the 100% homology of the five exons at the
12q24.11 locus with the full-length ORF in GLTP mRNA

were consistent with transcript maturation by cis splicing
processes [28].
Alignment of the human cDNA ORFs (630 bases) encoding GLTP (AF209074, AY372530, AY372531, AY372532)
also revealed ~94% homology with a single genomic DNA
sequence at locus 11p15.1 in chromosome 11 (Figure
2A). The genomic sequence (627 bases) contained both
start (ATG) and stop (TAA) codons and encoded a near
full-length GLTP-like protein (208 a.a.) lacking only
Lys146 (Figure 2A). Absent from the GLTP-like sequence
was AGA from within the CAG435AAGATC TTC444 region,
affecting two potential codons (Figure 2A; cyan highlight). Fortuitously, the deleterious effect of the missing
AGA was minimized and resulted only in the loss of a single lysine residue. The remaining CAG435ATC TTC441
sequence kept the reading frame fidelity in tact without
alteration of subsequent codons. Altogether, nucleotide
deletions and substitutions delineated a total of 13 different amino acids in the GLTP paralog, resulting in 94%
identity with GLTP encoded at locus 12q24.11 (Figure
2B).
Comparison of the encoded sequences for human GLTP
and the GLTP paralog (Figure 2B) revealed the presence of
all residues previously shown to be important components of the glycolipid liganding site, encompassing both
the glycolipid recognition center (Asp48, Asn52, Lys55,
Trp96, His140, Tyr207, Val209) and the hydrophobic
tunnel (Leu4, Leu30, Phe33, Phe34, Leu37, Val41, Phe42,
Pro44, Ile45, Ile49, Phe103, Ile104, Phe107, Leu108,
Ala128, Leu136, His140, Val144, Ile147, Ala151, Leu152,
Ala155, Phe161, Leu165) [16,29]. The 94% overall

homology of the GLTP paralog for human GLTP was similar to that of mouse GLTP and was much greater than that
of HET-C2 fungal GLTP ortholog, which actively transfer
glycolipids [26]. Thus, the evidence suggested that the
intronless GLTP gene (GLTPi) at locus 11p15.1 might be
a retrogene with the potential to express active protein.
Transcriptional Status of Human GLTP Genes
To determine whether the NCBI human expressed
sequence tag (EST) database contained any evidence for
mRNA transcript of the 11p15.1 GLTP paralog, BLAST
searches were performed against both the GLTPi ORF at
11p15.1 and the 5-exon/4-intron GLTP ORF at 12q24.11.
More than 100 sequences matched positively to human 5exon/4-intron GLTP ORF, indicating active transcription
for the GLTP gene at locus 12q24.11 in a variety of cells.
However, one EST clone (CF619013) derived from
pooled chondrosarcoma tumor cells matched identically
with the GLTPi ORF at locus 11p15.1, with its nearly fulllength ORF (627/630 bases) including start (ATG) and
stop (TAA) codons. Thus, the possibility remained that
GLTPi at 11p15.1 could be an active retrogene, expressed
only at certain times during cell development or only in
select cell types [30]. To directly assess the transcriptional
status of both GLTP genes in vivo, RT-PCR analyses were
performed on the total RNA isolates from various human
cells. To circumvent the difficult task of identifying primers and PCR cycling conditions that could reliably and
unequivocally discriminate between the highly homologous ORFs predicted from the two GLTP genes, PCR reactions were performed with 'GLTP universal primers'
designed to amplify equally well either 562 or 559 base
sequences of either GLTP ORF (Figure 2A). This strategy

had the benefit of providing a PCR response expected to
directly correlate with the relative abundance of the two
potential GLTP transcripts, irrespective of chromosomal
origin. Careful optimization of PCR cycling conditions
avoided caveats associated with high cycling PCR, which
can amplify the slightest traces of genomic DNA present in
RNA isolates and lead to erroneous conclusions. Controls
using only Platinum Taq DNA polymerase without reverse
transcriptase (No-RT controls; see Additional file 1, Figure
S1) established the critical number of PCR cycles in our
experiments to be 35–37 to maximize detection of potential GLTP transcripts from the single-copy genes while
avoiding spurious contributions from amplified genomic
DNA of GLTPi remaining in the DNase-treated transcript
isolates.
Figure 3A shows the results obtained using an optimized
number of PCR thermal cycles (37 cycles) with DNasetreated RNA isolates from glioma cells (lane 1), human
skin fibroblasts (lane 3), HBL100 breast cancer (lane 5),
T47D breast cancer (lane 9), breast cancer HTB-126 (lane
13), Gaucher cells (lane 7), Caov3 ovarian cancer (lane
15), IMR-32 neuroblastoma (lane 11). No-RT PCR controls are shown in even numbered lanes (Figure 3A).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/72

Cloning of PCR products using pGEM-T vector and restriction analysis using BspHI enabled efficient and rapid
determination of RT-PCR product source (e.g., 5-exon/4intron GLTP or GLTPi). Figure 3B shows the control BspHI
restriction pattern obtained by digestion of pGEM-T vector with the different GLTP ORF inserts (corresponding
pGEM-T vector map and BspHI sites, see Additional file 1,
Figure S1A). Analyses of more than 120 clones from different cell lines (Figure 3A) using optimized PCR conditions produced restriction patterns consistent only with
the 5-exon/4-intron GLTP gene being the source of transcribed mRNA (see Additional file 1, Figure S1C).
Sequencing of representative clones verified the restriction
digest patterns. Only when the number of RT-PCR cycles
exceeded 40 were clones occasionally found displaying
the GLTPi cDNA restriction pattern (see Additional file 1,
Figure S1B). Even so, No-RT PCR controls were consistent
with the GLTPi cDNA being derived from trace contamination by GLTPi genomic DNA. Thus, active transcription
involved only the single-copy, 5-exon/4-intron GLTP
gene, with transcript levels being relatively high in human
glioma cells and Gaucher cells. Although expression levels
in human skin fibroblasts were relatively low and difficult
to visualize in agarose gels (Figure 3A, lane 3), the pres-

ence of 5-exon/4-intron GLTP PCR product was confirmed by excision and cloning of the corresponding gel
region. Transcription of GLTPi was not evident in any of
the analyzed cells by the preceding criteria.
Methylation Status of CpG Islands in Human GLTP Genes
CpG dinucleotides in the 5' end regions of transcriptionally active chromosomal alleles generally are unmethylated. Conversely, methylation of CpG islands is a known
indicator of transcriptional silencing [31-33]. In human
GLTPi, a 255 base sequence including the 5' UTR (-128
bases) and initial portion (20%) of the potential ORF (see
additional file 1, Figure S2), met the criteria of a CpG
island [31-34]. To assess methylation status, human
blood genomic DNA was treated with bisulfite to convert

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/72

unmethylated cytosines to uracils while leaving any methylated cytosines unaltered. Primers containing no CpG
dinucleotides were used for PCR to avoid bias between
DNA templates based on their original methylation status
[34,35]. The results obtained by sequencing, after clonal
amplification using pGEM-T, are shown in Figure 4. The
23 CpG dinucleotides, localized in the CpG island of
GLTPi, were highly methylated in all clones (Figure 4A,
filled circles), consistent with transcriptional silencing.
In the 5-exon/4-intron GLTP gene, the CpG island (666
bases) included a larger 5' UTR region (-476 bases) along
with all of the Exon 1 ORF (103 bases) and the initial 87
bases of Intron 1 (see Additional file 1, Figure S2). Consistent with designation as a CpG island was the very high

of methylation detected by direct sequencing and served only as a negative control for BstUI action shown Panel C. Std =

G-C content (76% overall), that reached 80% and 84% in
the 5'UTR regions -450 and -300 from the translation initiation site, respectively. The very high concentration of
CpG dinucleotides (88 sites) in the CpG island severely
limited the locations where 'CpG-free' primers, having the
required 20–30 base sequence length, could be used to
obtain the desired PCR products (<300 base long)
[34,35]. The criteria were met by a 201 base sequence containing 11 CpG sites in the 5'UTR (-559 to -359) of the 5exon/4-intron GLTP gene. Bisulfite treatment followed by
sequencing of clones showed all 11 CpG sites to be completely unmethylated (see Additional file 1, Figure S2),
consistent with active transcription of the 5-exon/4-intron
GLTP gene.
To confirm the sequencing data for human blood cell
genomic DNA and further analyze the methylation status
of the CpG island of GLTPi in various other human cells,
combined bisulfite-restriction analysis (COBRA) was performed (35). Figures 4B and 4C show the COBRA data
obtained for the GLTPi CpG island. Figure 4B shows the
PCR products after bisulfite treatment of human blood
cell genomic DNA before (lane 1) and after (lane 2) BstUI
restriction digestion, which cuts only when two adjoining
CpG dinucleotides within the recognition site are methylated (lane 2). Figure 4C shows results obtained with glioma (lane 2), skin fibroblasts (lane 3), breast cancer
[HBL100 (lane 4), T47D (lane 6), and HTB-126 (lane 8)],
Caov3 ovarian cancer (lane 9), IMR-32 neuroblastoma
(lane 7) and Gaucher cells (lane 5). Although traces of
undigested amplified products were detected (Figure 4C,
lanes 2–9), nearly all amplified PCR products from GLTPi
CpG islands were cut by BstUI, consistent with high level
methylation and with transcriptional silencing.
Glycolipid Transfer Activity of Human GLTP Homologs
As pointed out earlier, comparison of human 5-exon/4intron GLTP with GLTPi revealed encoding of all amino
acid residues known to be important components of the
glycolipid liganding site, including the glycolipid recognition center (Asp48, Asn52, Lys55, Trp96, His140, Tyr207,
Val209) and the hydrophobic tunnel (Leu4, Leu30,
Phe33, Phe34, Leu37, Val41, Phe42, Pro44, Ile45, Ile49,

His140, Val144, Ile147, Ala151, Leu152, Ala155, Phe161,
Leu165) [16,29]. To directly test whether GLTPi could be
a source of active protein in human cells, the two GLTP
homologs were heterologously expressed in E. coli, purified from the soluble fractions, and analyzed for their
ability to transfer glycolipid between phospholipid
bilayer vesicles in vitro. Two findings were noteworthy.
First, compared to 5-exon/4-intron GLTP, the solubility of
the GLTPi paralog was very poor, as indicated by its high
accumulation in the inclusion bodies of E. coli (Figure
5A), consistent with a tendency to misfold. Second, GLTPi

(Figure 5B) when assessed for glycolipid intermembrane
transfer using the well-established radiolabeled and fluorescence energy transfer assays [27,29,36,37]. Inclusion of
Triton X-100 at low concentration during protein expression did result in slightly increased distribution of GLTPi
paralog to E. coli soluble fractions. Nonetheless, the resulting GLTPi paralog (purified from the soluble fraction)
remained inactive (data not shown).

To determine whether a mammalian cellular environment is needed for expression of active GLTPi paralog,
human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293T) were transfected with FLAG-CMV vector containing the GLTPi and
GLTP ORFs. Analysis of the resulting cell supernatant fractions revealed a 20-fold increase in glycolipid intermembrane transfer activity above endogenous background
levels for cells transfected with GLTP, but no increase in
glycolipid intermembrane transfer activity for cells transfected with GLTPi (data not shown).
Evolutionary Insights
Table 1 summarizes the structural patterns found in the
multi-exon GLTP genes of various vertebrates. The 5-exon/
4-intron organizational pattern, characteristic of the
human GLTP gene at locus 12q24.11, was absolutely conserved, as were the sizes of analogous exons (e.g. exon 1
always 103 bases; exon 2 always 59 bases, etc.) in representative therian mammals and other vertebrates. In contrast, the size of analogous introns varied considerably
among the 5-exon/4-intron GLTP genes. Nonetheless,
intron 1 was consistently much larger than the other three
introns and was exceptionally large in primates (~21,000
bases).

In certain cases, sequence data for GLTP genes was found
to be either missing or of very low reliability. This situation was evident for the predicted GLTP gene of Pan troglodytes (GenBank XM_522526; Ensembl, ver. 46, August
2007; [38]), based on careful comparisons to the human
and macaque genes. To rectify the issue, the problematic
G-C rich region of the chimp GLTP gene (e.g. exon 1) was
cloned and sequenced using genomic DNA from chimpanzee fibroblasts (GenBank EF520721) by including
PCR enhancers known to facilitate cloning of GLTP
mRNA [27,36]. The resulting sequence of exon 1 in the
chimp GLTP gene was found to be identical to that of the
human 5-exon/4-intron GLTP gene (see Additional file 1,
Figure S3). Molecular cloning of the GLTP ORF using
mRNA from chimp fibroblasts (GenBank EF688398) con-

firmed the identical nature of the encoded chimp and
human GLTPs (209 a.a.).
Alignment of the five GLTP exons comprising the primate
mRNA ORFs revealed very high conservation of nucleotide sequence (see Additional file 1, Figures S3 and S4).
The human and chimp ORFs were 99.5% identical, i.e.
627/630 bases, and the human and macaque ORFs were
97.5% identical, i.e. 614/630 bases. All nucleotide differences were synonymous [39,40], i.e. no altered codon
translation and all three primate GLTPs were identical in
amino acid sequence (see Additional file 1, Figure S5). In
nonprimate mammals, the GLTP ORFs had more nonsynonymous base substitutions (see Additional file 1, Figure
S4), resulting in increased amino acid variability (see
Additional file 1, Figure S5). Even so, high amino acid
sequence homology was encoded in the 5-exon/4-intron
GLTP genes of nonprimate mammals with sequence identity being 99% for Canis, 98.6% for Bos, 94.3% for Mus,
and 90.4% for Monodelphis as well as for other vertebrates (e.g., 74.2% for Xenopus, 80.4% and 72.2% for
Danio) compared to human 5-exon/4-intron GLTP.
Phylogenetic analyses (Figure 6) indicated that all
sequences produced exactly the same tree topology by
three independent methods [neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP) and minimum evolution (ME)]
[39,40]. Most of the major internal branches were well
supported (Figure 6). Overall, the phylogenetic/evolutionary relationships observed for the 5-exon/4-intron
GLTP gene conformed to the widely-accepted phylogeny
of vertebrates. The situation for GLTPi was much different.
Orthologs of the human GLTPi gene were discovered only
in nonhuman primates (chimpanzee, macaque) and were
not present in carnivora (dog), cetartiodactyla (pig, cow),
rodentia (mouse, rat) or didelphimorphia (opossum),
suggesting recent evolutionary development. The 'intronless' nature of the ORF sequences was consistent with origination by retrotransposition of mRNA derived from an
ancestral 5-exon/4-intron GLTP gene. The structural fea-

node from the maximum parsimony, distance, and minimum evolution analyses. (Nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments are provided as Additional file 1, Figures S4 and S5).

tures supporting the common evolutionary ancestry of
GLTPi genes in primates, included the following differences compared to their 5-exon/4-intron GLTP genes: 1)
location on a different chromosome; 2) occurrence of
nearly full-length GLTP ORFs (624 bases) including both
start and stop codons; 3) absence of AGA at the same location in the sequence; 4) presence of the CAG435ATC
TTC441 sequence (after AGA deletion from the
CAG435AAGATC TTC444 region), keeping the potential
reading frame fidelity intact and limiting downstream
changes. The locations of the base changes within the
affected GLTPi sequences are shown in Additional file 1,
Figure S3. These shared and delineating features provided
an unequivocal indication of the close evolutionary relationship among the GLTPi genes of primates.
Estimates of the evolutionary divergence for the 5-exon/4intron and GLTPi genes of primates and other primates
provided insights into the selection pressure exerted on
different phylogenetic branches. As shown in Table 2,
base substitutions resulting in no change in amino acid
residue (Ks) per synonymous site are compared with the
nucleotide changes that do result in an amino acid alteration per nonsynonymous site (Ka) [41,42]. Ka/Ks ratios
indicate the rate of evolution [42-44]. In Table 2, the
higher Ka/Ks ratios for 5-exon/4-intron GLTP genes among
rodents compared to those among primates and cetartiodactylates are consistent with the rate of 5-exon/4-intron

GLTP protein evolution being faster in rodents than in primates and cetartiodactyla, after scaling to neutral divergence. Nonetheless, very low values for the Ka/Ks ratios,
i.e. zero and < 0.01 for the exons of the 5-exon/4-intron
GLTP genes in primates (Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and
Macaca mulatta) and cetartiodactyla (Bos Taurus and Sus
scrofa) and of Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus, are consistent with strong selection pressure to maintain and conserve the encoded amino acid sequence, as expected for
genes playing important functional roles. In contrast, the
GLTPi genes of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Macaca
mulatta show significantly higher Ka/Ks values (Table 2),
consistent with no evolutionary selection pressure being
exerted on the primate GLTPi compared to their 5-exon/4intron GLTP genes, because Ka/Ks values slightly below
1.0 are not de facto evidence of purifying selection pressure
[45].

Discussion
GLTP has recently emerged as the prototypical and founding member of a new protein superfamily, characterized
by a unique conformational fold for lipid binding/transfer as well as for protein targeting/translocation to membranes [13,17,19-22]. While recent advances have
delineated the architecture used by GLTP to selectively
acquire glycosphingolipid ligand [16-18] as well as the
role played by membrane lipid composition in regulating
GLTP activity in vitro [13,37,46-50], the organization,

transcriptional status, phylogenetic/evolutionary relationships of human GLTP genes have not been previously
characterized.
Our findings show the GLTP gene to be present in all vertebrate genomes and characterized by a highly conserved
5-exon/4-intron organizational pattern, consistent with
mRNA production via classical cis processing events. The
resulting GLTP transcript encodes a highly conserved
mammalian protein able to selectively bind glycolipids
and accelerate their intermembrane transfer [13]. The
human 5-exon/4-intron GLTP gene maps to locus
12q24.11 of chromosome 12 and is actively transcribed in
variety of different cells, as shown by RT-PCR and by the
unmethylated status of CpG dinucleotides in its CpG
island. Noteworthy features of the 5-exon/4-intron GLTP
gene are the very large size of its first intron (>21,000
bases) and the exceptionally high density of CpG dinucleotides (88) and of G-C bases (~80%) in its CpG island.
The very high G-C content probably contributed to the
poor sequence resolution evident in the GLTP gene of the
recent Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee) genome release (GenBank NW_001223167; Sept. 2006), the resulting omission of exon 1 from the chimp GLTP gene (GenBank
XM_522526), and inaccurate predictions of mRNA and
protein sequence (Ensembl version 46, August 2007;
[38]). Our cloning and sequencing of the genomic DNA
of GLTP exon 1 as well as full-length GLTP ORF from
mRNA of Pan troglodytes fibroblasts (GenBank EF520721
&EF688398) have rectified the earlier inconsistencies and
demonstrated the existence of the highly conserved 5exon/4-intron GLTP gene in chimpanzee.
The discovery of a second, intronless GLTP-like gene
(GLTPi), encoding a full-length GLTP paralog in humans
provided the opportunity to test for functionality as a ret-

rogene. The issue is of timely relevance because of recent
reports indicating transcription and regulatory functions
of intronless pseudogenes [51-56]. Our analyses of GLTPi,
which maps to locus 11p15.1 of chromosome 11, provide
a clear indication of the challenges associated with definitive validation of pseudogene transcription. The experiments illustrate how PCR amplification involving closelyrelated sequences can detect even the slightest traces of
genomic DNA contaminant in highly purified RNA isolates (see Additional file 1, Figure S1). It is clear that stringent controls are needed when using PCR to analyze the
transcriptional status of intronless genes, including PCR
controls performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase
(No-RT controls), to avoid erroneous conclusions regarding the source of similarly sized templates (e.g. mRNA
ORF versus genomic DNA of intronless gene). Such controls are needed even with DNase-treated mRNA isolates
(see Additional file 1, Figure S1). In fact, it was possible to
detect GLTPi genomic DNA in No-RT controls of mRNA
isolates treated three times in succession with DNase,
when the PCR thermal cycling number reached 42 or
higher (data not shown). The PCR-associated caveats
emphasize the need for independent analyses during evaluations of the transcriptional status of intronless genes
that are highly homologous to the transcript of their parent genes. Reliance on the EST database as a complementary approach is risky because of documented evidence of
substantial contamination from various sources including
genomic DNA [57-59]. In contrast, a dependable complementary approach for monitoring gene transcriptional
status is analysis of the methylation status of CpG islands
commonly found in the 5'UTR of genes. The high methylation levels of the 23 CpG dinucleotides in the CpG island
of the intronless GLTP-like gene, along with the carefully
controlled PCR data, provide strong evidence for this gene
being a transcriptionally silent pseudogene. We find this

Page 10 of 15

to be the case despite the fact that GLTPi encodes an
almost full-length ORF (627 vs 630 bases), complete with
start and stop codons, and with an overall amino acid
sequence homology of 94% compared to the active 5exon/4-intron GLTP. It is noteworthy that the 94%
homology is similar to that of human 5-exon/4-intron
GLTP and mouse GLTP and much greater than that of the
HET-C2 fungal ortholog [26] which actively transfers glycolipid. Also, heterologous expression of 5-exon/4-intron
GLTP cDNA generated from human, bovine, porcine, and
murine transcripts yields fully active protein in E. coli
[27,29,36,47-50], presumably because GLTP lacks
intramolecular disulfides [13,16] and needs no posttranslational modifications, i.e. glycosylation or acylation
[8,27]. Nonetheless, the human GLTPi paralog is inactive
and poorly soluble when expressed in E. coli. Ectopic
expression in human embryonic kidney cells using FLAGCMV vector also resulted in inactive GLTPi. The absence of
in vitro activity in the human GLTPi paralog occurs despite
the fact that contains all residues previously identified as
important components of the glycolipid liganding site,
including the glycolipid recognition center (Asp48,
Asn52, Lys55, Trp96, His140, Tyr207, Val209) and the
hydrophobic tunnel (Leu4, Leu30, Phe33, Phe34, Leu37,
Val41, Phe42, Pro44, Ile45, Ile49, Phe103, Ile104,
Phe107, Leu108, Ala128, Leu136, His140, Val144,
Ile147, Ala151, Leu152, Ala155, Phe161, Leu165)
[16,29]. Our findings suggest that misfolding, triggered by
one or more of the 13 altered residues, is responsible for
the inactive state of human GLTPi. Identification of which
of these GLTP residues or combination of residues are
essential for proper folding will require future in-depth
analyses.
Additional support for human GLTPi gene being a transcriptionally silent pseudogene comes from phylogenetic/
evolutionary divergence analyses that provide insights
into the selection pressure being exerted on genes [41-44].
The frequencies of nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) nucleotide substitutions for the GLTP functional and intronless genes (Table 2) are consistent with
strong divergence of GLTPi relative to the 5-exon/4-intron
GLTP genes. The relatively high Ka/Ks ratios (> 0.5) for
GLTPi of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Macaca mulatta
indicate that they have been subjected to very low evolutionary selection pressure. It is important to recognize that
Ka/Ks values slightly below 1.0 are not de facto evidence of
significant purifying selection pressure. Indeed, a comprehensive genome-wide survey of human pseudogenes, performed against benchmark control sets of true genes and
pseudogenes, revealed that only a small fraction (~12%)
of pseudogenes have Ka/Ks values very close to the theoretical neutral selection pressure value of 1.0 [45]. Rather,
the majority of human pseudogenes have Ka/Ks values
very similar to those of the primate GLTPi pseudogenes. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/72

contrast, the low Ka/Ks ratios for the 5-exon/4-intron
GTLP genes (e.g., 0 to <0.01) indicate strong purifying
selection pressure to conserve the encoded amino acid
sequence in order to maintain protein functionality.

Conclusion
The present study provides the first insights into the
genomic organization, transcriptional status, and phylogenetic/evolutionary relationships of human GLTP genes,
which encode the prototypical member of the recently
established GLTP superfamily. The finding of a highly
conserved 5-exon/4-intron GLTP gene in vertebrates
vouches for the importance of GLTP in cells. Also noteworthy was the discovery of many errors in the on-line
bioinformatics databases pertaining to GLTP genes, perpetuated by predictive modeling analyses that relied on
low stringency survey data (e.g. exon deletion in the
chimp GLTP gene) rather than on carefully executed
experiments. The novel finding of a transcriptionallysilent, intronless GLTP gene in humans supports designation as GLTPP1, in accordance with guidelines for human
gene nomenclature [60,61]. The discovery of GLTPP1
orthologs in other primates provides a new 'selection
pressure free' marker for tracking primate evolutionary
relationships. Clear delineation of the absence of transcription by human GLTPP1 was evident only by application of comprehensive and stringent experimental criteria,
thus highlighting the challenges of unequivocally distinguishing silenced pseudogenes from functional retrogenes. In a larger context, the present study supports
concerns about the validity of recent functional roles
assigned to intronless pseudogenes. Among the most
noteworthy is the recent re-evaluation of Mkrn1-p1 pseudogene 'functionality' [62], providing definitive evidence
that the Mkrn1-p1 pseudogene is neither expressed nor
imprinted, nor does it regulate its source gene in trans,
despite earlier high profile indications to the contrary
[54]. Equally important, the fundamental insights gained
here into human GLTP gene organization, transcriptional
status, and evolution provide a firm foundation for future
elucidation and understanding of hereditary defects
involving GLTP genes.

were: step1, 94°C for 3 min; step 2, 94°C for 30 sec; step
3, 50°C for 30 sec; step 4, 72°C for 30 sec; step 5, repeat

cycling conditions were the same except: step 2, 90°C for

were separated on 1.2% agarose gels, and the 255 bp

The purified products from human blood genomic DNA
were cloned directly into pGEM-T for DNA sequence analysis (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ).

RT-PCR and DNA Sequencing
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using Trizol
reagent (GBICOL/BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and was treated
with DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 25°C for
15 min to minimize contamination by genomic DNA.
SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) with Platinum Taq were used with RNA template (1
μg). Human GLTP-specific primer pairs were
5'TGAAGCCGCTGCCCGCGGACA3' and 5'CGTAGATGA
CATCGATGGTCG3'. RT-PCR reaction thermocycling conditions were: 30 min at 50°C, 2 min at 94°C or pre-cycle
and then different cycles of 15 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 63°C,
1 min at 72°C. β-actin served as internal RT-PCR control,
performed in parallel with GLTP RT-PCR, using β-actin
primer pairs of 5'GGCATCCTCACCCTGAAGTA3' and
5'CCATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTCC3' to produce a 496 base
PCR fragment. With β-actin, PCR was limited to 30 cycles
to avoid nonlinear responses. No-RT analysis also was
performed as a control for detection of genomic DNA.
PCR products were analyzed by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using a gel purification kit (NucleoTrap® Gel Extraction Kit, Clontech, Mountain View, CA),
and cloned using pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA). Plasmids were digested by BspHI restriction
enzyme, and the products were analyzed by agarose gel
electrophoresis. Representative clones were sequenced by
automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing using an ABI
Prism 3730xl DNA analyzer (GENEWIZ, South Plainfield,
NJ, USA).

COBRA analysis was performed as described previously
[35]. The sodium bisulfite modified PCR products from
different cell lines were reamplified for 38 PCR cycles
using high-fidelity polymerase (Taq Plus, Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA). PCR products (15 μl) were restriction digested
for 4 h at 60°C by addition of a master mix (10 μl) equivalent to New England Biolabs Buffer #2 (2.5 μl), water
(5.5 μl) and BstUI (2 μl of 10 Units/μl; New England
Biolabs). Restriction digests was analyzed by 1.2% agarose
gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.

DNA Methylation Analysis
Genomic DNA from human blood (Promega) or isolated
from various cell lines (Sigma-Aldrich, GenElute™ mammalian genomic DNA miniprep kit) was bisulfite converted
using
manufacturer's
recommendations
(CpGenome Fast; Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Primers to
amplify 5' regions of GLTP and intronless GLTP genes
were (5'AATAGGAGAGTAGT-GTTTATTTAGGTTATT3' &
5'ATCTTCCCCAAATATACCTCCC3') and (5'TTATTGTGATTATGA-AAATATATTAA-AAA3'
&
5'TAAACACTAAAAACCCAAAACAATC3'), respectively,

Plasmid Construction and GLTP Expression
GLTP and GLTPi ORFs were inserted into pET-30 Xa/LIC
vector (Novagen) by ligation independent cloning [29].
Positive clones were verified for reading frame fidelity by
nucleotide sequencing prior to transforming BL21(DE3)
cells. For 6xHis-S-GLTP expression, bacterial cultures were
grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium (750 ml) until
reaching OD600 = 0.9–1.1. Cells were then induced by 0.1
mM isopropyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside and bacterial
growth was continued at 15°C for 20 h. The cell pellet was
resuspended in washing buffer (30 ml) containing 10 mM
imidazole, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 10%
glycerol, 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol. After brief sonication and centrifugation, clarified cell
lysate was loaded on 1–1.5 ml Ni-NTA affinity resin (Qiagen). The majority of protein was soluble. Protein was
released from the washed column by stepwise elution
with buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (60, 100 and 200 mM) in 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM
NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, and 5% glycerol. Imidazole was
removed from combined fractions by desalting columns
(Econo-Pac 10 DG; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 150 mM
NaCl and 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0 and protein fractions
were concentrated to 2–6 mg/ml using Centriplus centrifugical filter devices YM-10 (Amicon). Glycerol was added
at 10% final concentration to stabilize and protect from
freeze-thaw damage. Protein purity was analyzed by 15%
SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (BioRad Protein
Assay) using bovine serum albumin as standard. 6xHis-Stag was removed from rGLTP by incubation with Factor Xa

(Novagen) for 16 h at room temperature to obtain a
sequence identical to wild-type GLTP. The protein was
purified by FPLC SEC using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-75
prep grade column (Amersham) equilibrated with 150
mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0). Protein fractions were
concentrated to 2–6 mg/ml and stored in buffer containing 10% glycerol.

mony (MP) and minimum evolution (ME), to construct
distance trees with MEGA (Version 4.0) [39,40]. Bootstrap
values were calculated from 1000 replicates and values of
<50% are not shown. CLUSTLX analysis [65] was used to
comparatively align the open reading frames of the vertebrate GLTP genes.

Abbreviations
HEK 293T cells were plated at 1 × 105 densities, incubated
until reaching 40–70% confluency, and transfected with
pFLAG-CMV™-4 vector (2 μg) using jet PEI (Polypus
Transfection, New York NY), a cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) that forms complexes with DNA for efficient transfection of mammalian cells, after insertion of
the wild-type human GLTP and GLTPi ORFs using the
BamHI (5') and EcoRI (3') restriction sites and ligating
with T4 ligase overnight at 16°C. Control cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV™-4 vector containing no GLTP
cDNA insert. After 36 h, transfected cells were selected
based on resistance to G418 sulfate (400 μg/ml). Cells
were harvested by scraping into buffer containing 20 mM
Tris, 50 mM sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, aprotinin,
leupeptin, and PMSF. Homogenization was performed by
20 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. The supernatant
was recovered by centrifugation at 80 g for 10 min and
assayed for glycolipid transfer activity.

glycolipid transfer activity of the human GLTP paralogs.
XZ, TC, and REB participated in the design and execution
of the study. REB wrote and constructed the manuscript
with contributions from XZ and TC. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.

Assay of Glycolipid Transfer Protein Activity
Glycolipid transfer activity was monitored as described
previously [29,37]. Briefly, donor vesicles comprised of 89
mol%
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl
phosphatidylcholine
(POPC), 1 mol% [3H]GalCer, 10 mol% negatively
charged dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid and traces of
[14C]tripalmitate (nonexchangeable marker) were prepared by sonication in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH
7.4), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3. Sonicated POPC vesicles served as acceptor membranes. After
incubation with GLTP (0.5 – 1 μg) for 30 min at 37°C,
charged donor and neutral acceptor vesicles were separated by rapid elution over DEAE Sephacel minicolumns
and the glycolipid transfer activity of GLTP was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the eluants.
Bioinformatics Analyses
GLTP genes were identified by searches of NCBI databases
[63] and ENSEMBL [38] against GLTP ORFs that we previously cloned from different mammalian cells
[16,27,36,47]. BLAST searches of the nononredundant
and EST databases [64] also were performed. K-Estimator
6.0, a divergence estimator program employing the
Kimura two-parameter correction method for multiple
hits, was used to estimate the frequency of synonymous
and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions [41]. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using three different
methods, i.e. neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum parsi-

Figure S1: RT-PCR/Restriction Analyses of Human GLTP and GLTPi
cDNA in Various Human Cells. The strategy for distinguishing human
GLTP and GLTPi cDNA clones by BspHI restriction analysis after RTPCR is depicted. In 3xDNase-treated RNA isolates, GLTPi cDNA clones
occasionally are detected using 42 PCR cycles (panel B) but not when
using 37 or fewer PCR cycles (panel C). The data suggest that genomic
DNA is virtually impossible to completely eliminate from RNA isolates.
Independent assessment using No-RT PCR (e.g. Figure 3A, even numbered lanes) is required to clearly distinguish the source template (gDNA
versus mRNA). Figure S2: CpG Islands in Human GLTP genes. The figure shows CpG islands in human GLTP genes, identified using MethPrimer [34], and primer locations for COBRA analyses. The 5'
untranslated region of human intronless GLTP gene (locus 11p15.1,
chromosome 11) was found to be highly methylated (Figure 4), consistent
with transcriptional silencing. Table S1: Number of synonymous substitutions per site (Ks), non-synonymous substitutions per site (Ka) and confidence intervals. Divergence analyses based on estimates of the frequency
of nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) nucleotide substitutions
between GLTP functional genes and intronless genes reveal that the
intronless GLTP genes have diverged relative to 5-extron-4 intron GLTP.
The data support information in Table 2 and suggest that the 5-extron-4intron GLTP genes have been subjected to strong selection pressure to conserve their amino acid sequences, characteristic of functional genes. The
intronless GLTP genes are under much less selection pressure compared to
the 5-extron-4-intron GLTP genes. Figure S3: GLTP and GLTPi Nucleotide Sequence Conservation in Primates. The data show the aligned
nucleotide sequences and exon organizations for the GLTP genes and
intronless GLTPi genes of humans, chimpanzees, and macaques. Figure
S4: GLTP ORF Conservation in Vertebrates. The data show the aligned
nucleotide sequences for the GLTP open reading frames found in various
vertebrates from humans to fish. Figure S5: Conservation of GLTP Amino
Acid Sequence in Vertebrates. The data show the aligned amino acid
sequences for GLTPs that occur in various vertebrates from humans to
fish.
