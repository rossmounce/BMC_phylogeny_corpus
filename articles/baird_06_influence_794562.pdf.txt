Abstract
Background: HIV-1 recombination between different subtypes has a major impact on the global epidemic. The
generation of these intersubtype recombinants follows a defined set of events starting with dual infection of a host
cell, heterodiploid virus production, strand transfers during reverse transcription, and then selection. In this study,
recombination frequencies were measured in the C1-C4 regions of the envelope gene in the presence (using a
multiple cycle infection system) and absence (in vitro reverse transcription and single cycle infection systems) of
selection for replication-competent virus. Ugandan subtypes A and D HIV-1 env sequences (115-A, 120-A, 89-D,
122-D, 126-D) were employed in all three assay systems. These subtypes co-circulate in East Africa and frequently
recombine in this human population.
Results: Increased sequence identity between viruses or RNA templates resulted in increased recombination
frequencies, with the exception of the 115-A virus or RNA template. Analyses of the recombination breakpoints
and mechanistic studies revealed that the presence of a recombination hotspot in the C3/V4 env region, unique
to 115-A as donor RNA, could account for the higher recombination frequencies with the 115-A virus/template.
Single-cycle infections supported proportionally less recombination than the in vitro reverse transcription assay
but both systems still had significantly higher recombination frequencies than observed in the multiple-cycle virus
replication system. In the multiple cycle assay, increased replicative fitness of one HIV-1 over the other in a dual
infection dramatically decreased recombination frequencies.
Conclusion: Sequence variation at specific sites between HIV-1 isolates can introduce unique recombination
hotspots, which increase recombination frequencies and skew the general observation that decreased HIV-1
sequence identity reduces recombination rates. These findings also suggest that the majority of intra- or
intersubtype A/D HIV-1 recombinants, generated with each round of infection, are not replication-competent and
do not survive in the multiple-cycle system. Ability of one HIV-1 isolate to outgrow the other leads to reduced
co-infections, heterozygous virus production, and recombination frequencies.

Background
Recombination between two genetically-distinct isolates
of the same retrovirus species was first described in
1970[1-3]. Retroviruses carry two copies of genomic RNA
within each viral particle. Prior to a recombination event,
heterodiploid viruses must be produced from cells coinfected with two different viruses. De novo infection with
a heterodiploid retrovirus can then result in generation of
recombinant or chimeric genomes catalyzed by reverse
transcriptase jumping between genomic RNA templates[4,5]. Several groups have studied various aspects of
these recombination events and have defined various possible models for retrovirus recombination involving synthesis of both the minus and plus strands of retroviral
DNA[6-10]. However, increasing evidence suggest that the
majority of recombination events occur during synthesis
of the minus DNA strand, following a copy choice mechanism[11]. This transfer involves a jumping of the nascent
DNA strand from one RNA template to the other, which is
guided through local sequence similarity between the two
genomic RNAs. Various triggers may be responsible for
this template switching such as breaks on the genomic
RNA, pause sites for reverse transcription, or particular
RNA secondary structures in the viral genome[12].
Identification of viral encoded oncogenes provided circumstantial evidence of retroviral recombination but
actual in vivo corroboration of this recombination process is most obvious in infections by human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 recombination appears
rampant during infection and may be a major evolutionary mechanism responsible for shuffling of genetic markers[13,14]. Unlike this intrapatient recombination,
shuffling of divergent HIV-1 regions and the creation of
chimeric genomes is now apparent throughout this epidemic[15-17]. HIV-1 has evolved and diversified in the
human epidemic into three groups (M, N, and O) and at
least ten subtypes (A through J) within the predominant
group M[18,19]. In East Africa and specifically Uganda,
subtypes A and D of HIV-1 group M co-circulate with a
high prevalence (50% subtype A, 40% subtype D)
[20,21]. Co-circulation of subtypes gives rise to unique
recombinant forms (URF) such as A/D recombinants in
Uganda but continual human-to-human transfer of
recombinants with defined mosaic genomes has lead to
the identification of circulating recombinant forms
(CRF01 to CRF16) [15]. Interestingly, A/D URF as
opposed to stable CRFs are predominant in Uganda
[20,21]. The impact of URFs is obviously increasing with
the merger and expansion of regional epidemics with
divergent subtypes (Figure 1A and 1B). Underestimates
suggest that nearly one million individuals are infected
with URFs (Figure 1B) and that intersubtype A/D recombinants in Central Africa are estimated in 660,000 of this
million (Figure 1C) [20-23].

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/91

The frequency of recombination within the 9.7 kilonucleotides of HIV-1 genome fluctuates between three and
thirty recombination events per round of replication and
depending on use of various viral genomes and possibly,
the cell type for infection[9,24,25]. In general, these
recombination frequencies are typically derived from
experiments employing closely related or even identical
parental sequence. Few studies have employed non-subtype B sequences or actual pairs of HIV-1 isolates that
recombine and circulate in the epidemic. Two studies
have examined intersubtype recombination in the 5'
untranslated region[26,27]. Increased sequence homology and maintenance of dimerization initiation sequence
appeared to stimulate intersubtype recombination
employing an in vitro reconstituted reverse transcription
system[27] and a single cycle replication system[26].
In this study, we generated recombinants between subtypes A and D in the C1-C4 region of the envelope gene
using three different assay systems. Two subtype A and
three subtype D primary HIV-1 isolates from Uganda were
employed as the "base" virus or env sequence for these
recombination frequency analyses[28]. The in vitro reconstituted system (referred to as in vitro system) involves
RNA-dependent DNA synthesis catalyzed by HIV-1
reverse transcriptase employing purified RNA templates of
subtype A and D env C1-C4 regions[29]. The second assay
employs a single cycle tissue culture infection with defective HIV-1 particles (referred to as single cycle system)[30], while the third system requires multiple round
infection of susceptible cells with two HIV-1 isolates of
subtypes A and/or D (referred to as multiple cycle system)[31]. Intra and intersubtype recombination frequencies in the env gene were calculated from all three systems.
For the in vitro and single cycle systems, recombination
frequency was calculated from the conversion of lac(parental) to lac+ (recombined) phenotype[29,30]. In the
multiple cycle system, replication-competent parental versus recombined HIV-1 isolates (i.e. in the env gene) were
selectively PCR amplified with subtype-specific or isolatespecific primers in order to calculate recombination frequency[31]. In general, increases in genetic diversity
between the HIV-1 env gene templates results in decreased
recombination frequencies but there are exceptions to this
observation. It appears that strong hotspots for recombination can appear with select pairs of HIV-1 isolates and
may be dependent of specific nucleotide sequence/structure combinations between donor/acceptor templates. A
previous study mapping these recombination breakpoints[32] assisted in our analyses of their impact on
intersubytpe recombination frequencies. In vitro analyses
were performed to examine the impact of unique recombination hotspot in the C3/V4 region of env.

Prevalence of unique HIV-1 recombinant forms (or intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants)
Prevalence of unique HIV-1 recombinant forms (or intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants). The location of subtypes
(e.g. A, C, G, etc), circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and unique recombinant forms (URFs) are mapped in sub-Saharan
Africa and specifically, Central Africa in panel A. The number of humans infected with the dominant subtypes, CRFs, and URFs
in the world or in Central Africa is graphed in panel B. The proportion of specific intersubtype recombinants (A/D, A/C, and
others) responsible for URF infections in Central Africa has been reported (C) [20–23]. Panel D provides a neighbor-joining
phylogenetic tree to describe the genetic relationship of the C1 to C4 env sequences of 115-A, 120-A, 89-D, 122-D, and 126D to other reference HIV-1 sequences.

Results
Intra- and intersubtype recombination frequency after a
single cycle of infection
As schematically illustrated in Figure 2A, we constructed
HIV-1 genomes which contained the env gene of HIV-1
subtypes A and D isolates (115-A, 120-A, 89-D, 122-D,
and 126-D) downstream of Lac Z- (donor genome) or Lac
Z+ (acceptor genome). Defective retroviral particles were
produced by co-transfections of the genomes into a 293T
cell packaging line. The env/lac Z cassette was than PCR
amplified following single-cycle infection with heterozygous and homozygous VSV-pseudotyped HIV-1 particles. As described in Figure 2, the reverse transcription
products resulting from processive copying of the donor
RNA and those generated by template switching in the
region of homology (the PstI-BamHI products; Figure 2A)
were cloned into plasmids for blue (lac+)/white (lac-)
screening of E. coli colonies (see Materials and Methods).
This experimental system has been previously described
as a method to study HIV-1 copy choice recombination
after a single cycle of infection of human cells [30]. For
each experiment, a control sample was run in which
homozygous lac+/+ and lac-/- defective viruses were produced separately by transfection of 293T packaging cells
with either pLac- or pLac+ genomic plasmids. The frequency of blue colonies, following cloning of the PstIBamHI products, provides an estimate of the background
(non-RT generated) recombinant molecules (see Materials and Methods). These recombinants could have been
generated by the Taq polymerase jumping between the
templates. However, the frequency of these background

recombinants was always lower than 0.5%, or at least 20fold less than the HIV-1 recombination frequency
obtained with heterozygous virions (data not shown)).
The sequence identity in this env fragment ranged from
0.676 to 0.734 between the subtype A and D isolates and
0.794 to 0.815 within isolates of the same subtype (A or
D). A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree describes the
genetic relationship between these subtype A and D HIV1 isolates and other reference strains (Figure 1D). The
pairwise distances between each isolates is shown in Figure 3A. Using the single cycle tissue culture assay, there
was an increased frequency of recombination corresponding with increased sequence homology (Figure 3B and
3C). The intersubtype A/D and D/A pairs recombined
with a frequency between 3.9 to 5.5% (with the exception
of 115/89) while the intrasubtype pairs recombined with
a frequency of 5.9 and 6.5%. This single-cycle system
employs a lacZ reporter gene for the detection of recombination events occurring upstream in the sense of (-) strand
DNA synthesis[32]. Thus, it is possible to measure recombination frequency due to jumping between identical
template sequences from the lacZ- to the lacZ+ template
(see Figure 2A). The intra-isolate frequency of recombination ranged from 13.9 to 17.7% in this assay (Figure 3B).
When the 115/89 pair was excluded from the analyses,
there was significant correlation between the recombination frequency and sequence identity between donor and
acceptor templates (r = 0.87, p < 0.0001; Pearson product
moment correlation) (Figure 3C). As described below, we

Schematic representation of intra- and intersubtype recombination systems
Schematic representation of intra- and intersubtype recombination systems. Single cycle tissue culture system
(panel A) for recombination employed heterozygous VSV-pseudotyped env particles produced by transient co-transfection of
two genomic and two helper plasmids in 293T cells. Following production from 293T cells, virus particles were used to transduce MT4 cells. PCR products cleaved with BamHI and SacII were then cloned into vectors for transfection into E. coli followed by screening of blue and white colonies. Calculations for the frequency of recombination are outlined in the Materials
and Methods. Structure of the genomic plasmids and reverse transcription products are shown in panel A. The in vitro experimental system is outline in panel B and involves reverse transcription across a donor RNA template that shares a region of
homology with an acceptor RNA template upstream of a genetic marker (lacZ') on the acceptor RNA or a truncated, nonfunctional portion of the malT gene from E.coli on the donor template. The donor RNA also contains at its 3' end an extension
which is used to selectively prime reverse transcription after hybridization of a complementary oligonucleotide. Processive
copying of the donor template will yield lac- genotypes, while template switching during reverse transcription of the retroviral
sequence will produce lac+ genotypes. The resulting double-stranded DNAs are restricted with BamHI and PstI and, after ligation to a plasmid vector, used for bacterial transformation. On appropriate media, recombinant DNAs will yield blue colonies
distinguishable from the white colonies given by the parental DNAs. The same LacZ screening system is employed for single
cycle assay (A). Multiple cycle tissue culture system (panel C) was performed by infecting U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells with subtype
A and D HIV-1 isolates in pairs (0.001 MOI). After the first round of replication, co-infected cells can produce both parental
and heterodiploid viruses. Infection of new cells with heterodiploid virions can lead to intersubtype recombination. The
schema for PCR amplification of intersubtype HIV-1 env fragments is outlined in panel C and the calculation for frequency is
described in the Materials and Methods. Finally, panel D describes the reconstituted in vitro reverse transcription assay which
involves initiating HIV-1 DNA synthesis from a radiolabeled DNA primer annealed to a defined donor RNA template (e.g. C3V4) and in the same reaction mixtures with an acceptor RNA template slightly longer and with a region of sequence homology
with the donor to promote strand transfer. RNA-dependent DNA synthesis is catalyzed by reverse transcriptase and a 20 nt 5'
[32P]-labeled DNA primer on the RNA donor templates (225 nt), RNA acceptor templates (225 nt), and with or without NC.
The templates have a 205 nt overlap region to promote intersubtype recombination. Products from these reactions were
resolved on a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.
identified a strong hotspot for recombination in the C3
env regionwhen the 115-A was employed as donor template in this single-cycle system (ref). This hotspot for
recombination was not observed with any other donor/

acceptor template pair and appeared unique to 115-A
template as donor. The impact of this 115-A specific
hotspot on high recombination frequencies is explored
below.

Frequency
Frequency of inter- and intrasubtype HIV-1 recombination in an in vitro, single cycle, and multiple cycle assay
systems. Panel A indicates the nucleotide genetic distances that separate the env genes in each pair of subtype A and D primary HIV-1 isolates employed in this study. The recombination frequencies of each pair in panel B were calculated in three
systems. For in vitro, the synthesis of minus strand DNA on the donor RNA template was catalyzed by RT. Products were
PCR amplified, cloned, and blue/white colonies were screened to calculate recombination frequencies. For the single-cycle system, recombination occurred in a cell infected with a heterozygous virus particle. Recombinants were identified by PCR and by
the same blue/white colony screening described in Figure 1 and in the Materials and Methods. Finally, the recombination frequency in the multiple cycle system was measured by quantitative PCR using isolate- or subtype-specific primers (see Materials
and Methods and Figure 4). The sequence identity between each HIV-1 pair is shown as line graph with the scale on right of
panel B. Panel C shows a plot of recombination frequency in the single cycle (filled circle) or in vitro (open circle) systems versus sequence identity. The r value represents the Pearson product moment correlation for in vitro (open circle) and single
cycle (filled circle) assays.
Recombination frequency in vitro
In order to compare the results of the single cycle cell culture assay to an in vitro assay, the same 1100 nucleotide
region of the HIV-1 subtype A and D env genes were
cloned into pA and pK vectors as previously described. In
the cell-free assay outlined in Figure 2B, reverse transcription is primed on the donor RNA in the presence of the
acceptor RNA. Presence of a functional lacZ gene indicates
a strand transfer from donor to acceptor RNA. As with the
assay in cell cultures, the position of template switching in
the region of homology is detected by sequence analysis
after cloning the products of reverse transcription. Using
this in vitro reverse transcription assay, the frequency of
recombination with the intersubtype pairs generally
ranged from 6–13.8%, with the exception of the A-115/D89 pair, which had a recombination frequency of 27%.
Use of intrasubtype pairs as with the single-cycle system
resulted in higher recombination frequencies: 16.7% with

D-126/D-122. Again the 115-A/120-A pair was the exception to this observation with a recombination frequency
of nearly 30%. Expectedly, the highest recombination frequencies were observed when the same isolate was used in
the donor and acceptor RNA templates. The intra-isolate
pair D-89/D-89 recombined with a frequency of 22%, and
the 120-A/120-A pair recombined with a frequency of
23.5%. As with the single cycle assay there was a significant but proportional increase in recombination frequencies with increasing sequence identity between donor and
acceptor templates (Figure 3C). In all cases, the frequency
of recombination was higher in the in vitro reconstituted
reverse transcription assay than in the single-cycle assay.
Increased frequency of recombination in vitro can be misleading considering the inability to reconstitute the conditions of endogenous HIV-1 reverse transcription.

Measuring fitness and recombination frequency in the multiple cycle system
Measuring fitness and recombination frequency in the multiple cycle system. U87.CD4.CXCR4 cell cultures dually
infected with two isolates of different subtypes (A+D; panel A) or the same subtype infections (A+A or D+D; panel B) and
then harvested for analyses. Subtype or isolate-specific primers were employed to amplify parental or recombinant HIV-1 env
DNA (X axes) from specific dual infections (Z axes). Copy numbers on the Y axes were derived from control PCR amplifications with known copy numbers of subtype A and D DNA templates (102 to 108 copies/reaction) (see Materials and Methods).
Relative fitness values (W) and frequencies of recombination from these dual infections/competitions were calculated as
described in the inset of panel C. Briefly, conserved primers were utilized to PCR amplify the env genes from parental and
recombinant env progeny from each dual infection to measure fitness by HTA[54,62,63]. These PCR products were then denatured and annealed to a radiolabeled env probe, which was amplified from a subtype E HIV-1 env clone (E-pTH22. DNA heteroduplexes specific for the each parental isolate were resolved on a 6% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel. A sample
autoradiograph and calculations of relative fitness is defined in panel D. A plot of the fitness differences (WD = Wmore fit/Wless fit)
or of percent recombinants (right Y axis) for each dual infection pair is shown in panel E.

transcriptase is optimized for DNA transcription and does
not necessarily reflect the actual native components or
concentration levels. Equal ratios of acceptor and donor
templates were however employed in vitro to mimic in
vivo conditions.
Frequency of intersubtype recombination in a multiple
cycle assay
A PCR method relying on subtype-specific oligonucleotides was devised [31] to detect, amplify, and quantify
env recombinants in HIV-1 dual infections. In the case of
intrasubtype dual infections, it was necessary to design
new isolate-specific primers for amplification of recombinant env genes. Amplification of recombinant env genes
with subtype or isolate-specific primers was preceded by
an external PCR amplification using conserved env primers (Figure 2C). In this experiment, plasmids containing
entire env gene of the parental or recombined A/D viruses
(pA-env, pD-env, pA/D-env, and pD/A-env) were employed
as PCR amplification controls. Briefly, the control plasmids were serially diluted, PCR amplified, and used as
standard curves to determine copy number of PCRamplifed recombined viral RNA molecules derived from
the dual infections. This method of quantitative PCR
amplification has been previously reported[33,34]. As
expected, the subtype A-specific (or isolate-specific) primers amplified env DNA from pA-env control plasmid,
mono-infection and dual infections containing A virus
but failed to amplify product from the D mono-infection.
Similar findings were obtained with the subtype D-specific primer pair.

To measure the frequency of intra- and intersubtype
recombination during multiple rounds of replication, a
10-2 or 10-3 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of the A or D
isolates were added in pairs to U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells.
Dual infections were monitored each day and when peak
reverse transcriptase (RT) activity was detected in the
supernatant, virus was harvested and subject to RT-PCR.
HIV-1 recombinants and parentals were then PCR amplified with subtype (isolate)-specific primer sets as
described above. After correcting for difference in primer
annealing and amplification efficiency using the plasmid
controls, the copy number of the parental isolates and env
recombinants amplified from these dual infections were
plotted in Figure 4A (intersubtype competitions/recombinations) and Figure 4B (intrasubtype competitions/
recombinations). Based on division of recombined C1-C4
products by the total C1-C4 products (parental plus
recombined), we estimated that the frequency of interand intra- subtype recombination in the env fragments
ranged from 0.25 to 3.4% (Figure 4E). To control for
recombination generated by Taq, equal amounts of both
pA-env and pD-env plasmids (103 or 106 copies/reaction)
were added to PCR amplifications employing the subtype

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/91

or isolate-specific a-envC1/a-envC4, d-envC1/d-envC4,denvC1/a-envC4, and a-envC1/d-envC4 primer pairs. Only
the a/a and d/d primer pairs could efficiently PCR-amplify
the mixture of the pA and pD plasmids [31]. The frequency of recombination catalyzed by Taq was < 0.005%/
Kbp, or at least 100-fold less than that generated in dual
infections of U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells.
In the multiple cycle assays as with the in vitro and single
cycle assays, the recombination frequencies appeared to
be proportionally higher with the intrasubtype pairs than
with the intersubtype A/D pairs (Figure 4E). However,
there was no significant correlation between recombination frequency in the multiple cycle system and sequence
identity between virus pairs (data not shown). A marked
decrease was observed in the overall recombination rates
in the multiple cycle tissue culture assays (range from 0.25
to 3.4%) as compared with the single cycle (4–17%, p <
0.005) or in vitro assays (6–30%, p < 0.001). This
decrease in recombination frequencies over multiple
rounds of replication appears counterintuitive considering each round of replication of both parental viruses
would increase chances of a co-infected cell and of heterodiploid virus production. These heterodiploid viruses
are the progenitors of intersubtype (or intra-) recombinants upon de novo infection. Furthermore, the recombined viruses can also produce progeny to infect new cells
and expand in culture. This is of course assuming that all
recombinants are not defective and are of equal fitness as
the parental isolates. Unlike the single cycle assay, the
recombined env glycoproteins at the time of virus production will only show functional constraints when infecting
a new cell. Thus, it seems unreasonable to assume that all
recombined env genes, generated by reverse transcription,
will be functional or will mediate host cell entry with
equal efficiencies[31].
Comparing the relative virus production in a dual infection
with recombination frequency
Relative production of both viruses in a dual infection can
be measured and compared to the frequency of recombination. The env gene is PCR amplified with conserved env
primers from the dual infection and then submitted to
heteroduplex tracking assay (HTA). Quantitation of the
segregated heteroduplexes on the non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels estimates production of each virus from
the dual infection. Figure 4C provides an example of the
HTA analyses and relative fitness calculation. The fitness
difference (WD; left y-axis of Figure 4E) between the two
viruses is a ratio of the relative fitness values of the more
fit over the less fit virus produced from the dual infection/
competition. A fitness difference of 1 suggests equal replicative fitness between the pair of viruses. Relative fitness
values in these competitions can also be calculated using
the production of each virus (Figure 4C) as measured by

Page 7 of 17

Retrovirology 2006, 3:91

quantitative PCR (Figure 4A and 4B). As indicated in Figure 4E, the fitness difference between two HIV-1 isolates
in competition as determined by quantitative PCR was
nearly identical to those values calculated by HTA. Relative fitness values for this study were derived from dual
virus competitions in the U87.CD4.CCR5 cultures. Nearly
identical relative fitness values were obtained from competitions in PHA/IL-2 treated PBMCs [28]. For example,
the fitness difference between 120-A over 126-D in
U87.CD4.CXCR4 cultures was 4.25 and 3.04 in PHA/IL-2
treated PBMC cultures (as determined by HTA) [28].
When comparing relative fitness (left y-axis, Figure 4E)
and recombination frequency (right y-axis), it is quite
apparent that the ability of one virus to out compete the
other in a dual infection dramatically reduces the frequency of recombination. In contrast, equal fitness of
both viruses in cultures results in the highest recombination frequency. For examples, a four-fold increase in virus
120-A over virus 126-D production in a dual infection was
associated with recombination frequency of less than 1%/
Knt whereas equal fitness of 126-D and 122-D (WD = 1) in
a dual infection resulted in a higher frequency of intersubtype recombination (6.5%/Knt). This finding was consistent in all dual infections. Equal replication efficiency in a
dual infection (i.e. equal fitness) would result in a higher
likelihood that both virus types can co-infect more cells,
leading to a greater production of heterozygous virions
(containing two different genomes), and thus, a higher
frequencies of recombination.
It is important to note that following infection with heterozygous virions, the rate of recombination events in the
multiple cycle/dual infection is likely similar to that
observed in the single-cycle assay. Over multiple rounds
of replication and in the absence of selection, there should
be an increase in the amount of dually infected cells, production of heterozygous virions, and as a consequence,
the production of recombined viruses. Thus, the apparent
reduction in the frequency of recombination (compare
multiple to single cycle frequencies, Figure 3B) is likely
related to the high proportion of replication defective or
dead HIV-1 recombinants following each round of reverse
transcription/template switching.
Increased recombination rates with 115-A donor template
As described above, the recombination frequencies with
115-A as donor were significantly higher than with other
subtype A and D RNA donor templates in both the in vitro
and single-cycle systems. Furthermore, 115-A as donor
was exception to the direct relationship between increasing recombination frequencies with increasing sequence
identities between acceptor and donor templates. Explanations for this exception were explored by investigating
comparing the sites of recombination in the C1-C4 env

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/91

region. A thorough analysis of recombination breakpoints
in Baird et al[32] revealed that most intrasubtype and
intersubtype env recombinants had preferential cross-over
sites in the C1 region and V2/C2 junction of env (Figure
5A). However, the use of the donor 115-A template with
any other acceptor template resulted in a unique recombination hotspot at the junction of the C3/V4 region (Figure
5A). Considering the C3 breakpoint was responsible for
one third of all 115-A-derived env recombinants, it is possible that this additional hotspot led to a significant
increase in recombination frequency. Aside from this 115A-specific env C3/V4 recombination site, the distribution
of recombination sites with all the HIV-1 template/virus
pairs were quite similar across the C1 to C4 region.
To further investigate this C3 recombination site, we analyzed the pausing pattern and template switching frequency in the C3 to V4 regions employing a reconstituted
in vitro reverse transcription assay described in Figure 2D.
Minus strand DNA synthesis was catalyzed by HIV-1 RT
and primed from a radiolabeled primer annealing to the
115-A or 120-A donor RNA template (Figure 5A and 5B,
respectively). Template switching to the 89-D template
during minus strand DNA synthesis was monitored during a time course assay and in the presence or absence of
HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NC) (schematic, Figure 2D).
The addition of 5' non-homologous nt's to the 5' end of
the donor prevents transfer from the end of the donor and
thus, limits transfer to the boxed region in the schematic
diagram (Figure 2D). Approximately 50% of the minus
strand DNAs were chased to full-length product derived
from the donor template (225 nt D product; Figure 5B
and 5C). There does appear to be more RT pausing on the
115-A template as compared to the 120-A template during
(-) strand DNA synthesis and specifically in the C3 region
of the template (indicated in Figure 5B). This pause product was observed when donor template was present or
absent in the reaction mixture indicating it originated
from the (-) strand DNA synthesis off the 115-A donor
tempate. Most of the paused products were eventually
elongated during the time course reaction.
A small percentage of minus strand DNA jumped to the
acceptor template for continued elongation (245 nt T
product; Figure 5B and 5C). Using primers specific for the
strand transferred minus strand DNA products, we PCR
amplified the recombinants and sequenced 35 clones
from the 115-A/89-D assays. Recombination in this
reconstituted in vitro assay generally matched those C3V4 recombination sites observed in the single-cycle assay
involving the same pair (data not shown). Interestingly,
the presence of NC in the reactions led to an even more
pronounced focus of breakpoints in C3 region. NC is
known to increase the frequency of recombination, possibly through the destabilization of RNA structures to

template
Pausing patterns and hotspots of intersubtype recombination during reverse transcription on the 115-A and
120-A RNA donor template. Hotspots of recombination were mapped in the C1-C4 region as part of a previous study (A).
RNA-dependent DNA synthesis is catalyzed by reverse transcriptase and a 20 nt 5' [32P]-labeled DNA primer on the 115-A
and 120-A RNA donor templates (225 nt). Reactions were in the presence or absence of D-89 acceptor (225 nt) and NC (Figure 1D). Reactions were stopped at 30 s, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 min and run on a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Products
of these reactions are shown in the autoradiographs of panel B (A-115 donor) and panel C (A-120 donor). The positions of
the primer (P), and full extended products derived from the donor template (D, 225 nt) and the strand transfer products (T,
245 nt). A major pause site during DNA synthesis was observed in the C3 region of 115-A donor template and is indicated by
the "dumbbell" symbol. A putative V4 stem-loop is also outlined (see Figure 5 for details). Graphs of transfer efficiency vs. time
for reactions with A-115 as both donor and acceptor (panel D) or A-115 (circles) or A-120 (triangles) as donor and D-89 as
acceptor (panel E) are shown. Filled shapes are without NC and open with. The % transfer efficiency is defined as the amount

100).

increase strand invasion and transfer. The frequencies of
strand transfer events along these templates were plotted
in Figure 5D and 5E. As observed in the in vitro and single
cycle assays (Figure 3B), increased sequence identity
between donor and acceptor RNA templates appears to
augment recombination or strand transfer during reverse
transcription. When 115-A RNA was employed as both
donor and acceptor, the strand transfer efficiency reached
levels of nearly 40% without NC and 60% with NC (Figure 5D). In contrast, transfer efficiency with the donor
115-A/acceptor 89-D intersubtype pair was less than 14%

even with NC (Figure 5E). The sequence identities for the
115-A/89-D pair and the 120-A/89-D pair were nearly
identical at 0.66% and 0.69, respectively (Figure 3A).
However, the transfer efficiency from the 115-A to the 89D templates was at least 2-fold greater than the transfer
efficiency from the 120-A to the 89-D templates. The addition of NC to the reactions proportionally increased transfer efficiency with both template pairs. In other words,
increased transfer from 115-A to 89-D than from 120-A to
89-D was apparent throughout the time course with or
without NC. These results again suggest that the preferen-

tial C3 breakpoint in the 115-A donor template (absent in
120-A donor template) is increasing recombination frequency.
The mechanism(s) for the increased C3/V4 recombination frequency when 115-A RNA was acting as the donor
is under investigation. Preliminary data suggest that specific sequence and RNA folding of the 115-A as compared
to other subtype A and D templates may play an important role in directing strand transfer during reverse transcription in the C3/V4 region (Figure 6). To investigate if
RNA sequence and secondary structure may play a role in
the C3/V4 breakpoint selection, a 350 nt RNA sequence
encompassing the C3-V4-C4 region was folded using
Mfold and the new Zucher algorithm. Computer predictions indicate that the RNA structures were not conserved
between the subtype A or D RNA templates (data not
shown). One stable RNA stem-loop (termed V4 stemloop) was, however, found between nt 7301 and 7339 on
the 115-A template (Figure 6) as well as the other viral
sequences, even though this region is fairly heterogenous.
This structure was maintained even when RNA structures
were predicted with a 50 nt sliding window (Figure 6) and
when folding larger env RNA sequences (data not shown).
The 50 nt sliding window removed 3' RNA sequence on
115-A to simulate the RT moving along the RNA template
during RNA-dependent DNA polymerization. The "movement" in the 5' direction on the template could result in
the re-folding of RNA and the destabilization of some
RNA structures. However the V4 stem-loop remained
intact. Sequence analyses of the 115-A/89-D recombinants from in vitro reverse transcription assays (from
Figure 5) and from the single cycle infection assays [27]
indicate that breakpoints were clustered in this V4 stemloop (Figure 6). Breakpoints could be mapped to specific
regions flanked by mismatched bases between the 115-A
and 89-D RNA templates (Figure 6). A reverse transcription pause site was also mapped to the middle of the
3'end of this stem-loop (Figures 5B and 6). As outlined in
the discussion, a similar stem-loop configuration and its
contribution on preferential recombination were
described for the C2 region of HIV-1 [24].

Discussion
This study has explored the mechanisms of intra- and
intersubtype HIV-1 recombination using primary subtype
A and D isolates that co-circulate and recombine in
Uganda. Retroviral recombination originates from two
different virus isolates co-infecting a single cell and then
producing heterodiploid retrovirus particles. Upon de
novo cell infection, reverse transcriptase jumps between
the two heterologous genomes during (-) strand DNA synthesis and creates a chimeric proviral genome. A significant proportion of this recombined progeny may be dead,
defective, or less fit than the parental retrovirus isolates.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/91

Those recombinants that do survive and compete may
have a selective advantage. In terms of the HIV-1 epidemic, the survival and transmission of intersubtype HIV1 recombinants can represent major antigenic shift and
possibly changes in virulence [16,35]. Within an infected
host, recombination is a rapid form of evolution that
likely contributes to immune evasion and multi-drug
resistance [13,14].
The mechanisms controlling the generation of intersubtype HIV recombinants are poorly understood but the
subject of intense investigation [24-26]. The majority of
earlier studies have focused on retroviral recombination
in regions presenting a high sequence similarity and not
necessarily with HIV or even retroviral sequences
[5,10,36-40]. In this study, we have employed either primary subtype A and D HIV-1 isolates or their env genes
cloned into retroviral/RNA expression vectors. We then
compared the frequency of recombination during reverse
transcription in vitro, a single cycle infection, and following multiple rounds of virus replication. Both the in vitro
and single-cycle system measure RT specificity for strand
transfer/recombination in the env gene but do not measure the production or selection of functional envelope
glycoproteins. The multiple cycle system involves infecting susceptible cells with two HIV-1 isolates of the same
or different subtypes. The frequency of recombination in
this system is a function of cell co-infection frequency,
heterodiploid virus production, recombination rates
within an infected cell, and finally selection of replicationcompetent and fit intra- or intersubtype recombinants.
Findings from all three assay systems suggest that recombination frequency is significantly reduced with decreasing sequence identity between the virus (or RNA
template) pairs, confirming previous observations on
intersubtype recombination [39] and on recombination
between HIV-1 templates with engineered sequence diversity[40,41]. The relationship between recombination frequency and sequence similarity is not an absolute as
indicated by intersubtype recombinations involving the
subtype A 115 RNA as donor. Concurrent studies have
carefully mapped the recombination breakpoints derived
from all of these intra- and intersubtype pairs and in all
three systems[32]. Increased recombination frequencies
when 115A donor RNA was paired with any other acceptor RNA template (subtype A or D) appears related to a
unique V4 env "hotspot" for recombination. A reconstituted in vitro reverse transcription system was employed
to dissect the mechanism(s) of enhanced strand transfer
from the 115-A V4 region. Preliminary data suggests that
specific RNA secondary structures in the V4 RNA may have
driven this preferential strand transfer and increased
recombination frequency. This type of observation may
have escaped the attention of earlier reports [9,24,40,42]

Schematic of reverse transcription and template switching from the 115A to the 89D RNA templates

Schematic of reverse transcription and template switching from the 115A to the 89D RNA templates. A 350 nt
RNA sequence from position 7150 to 7500 (HXB2 numbering) of virus 115A, 120A, 89D, 122D, and 126D was submitted to
Mfold server at MacFarlane-Burnett for RNA structure prediction based on the Zucher algorithms. The RNA structures for
the five different templates varied considerably but one stem-loop or hairpin was consistently present around nt 7301 to 7339
and was termed the V4 stem-loop. Only 115A and 89D RNA structures between nt 7296 and 7421 are presented in this figure.
Shifting the 350 nt RNA template 50 nt upstream or downstream did not affect the structure of this predicted V4 stem-loop.
This RNA structure also contains the strong pause site identified in Figure 4B (blue dumbbell). The structure of virus 115A
RNA was examined by sliding a 50 nt window from nt 7276 to 7126 on the 3' end and from nt 7235 to 7075 on the 5'end. To
mimic the double stranded DNA/RNA duplex generated by (-) strand DNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase, a 20 nt duplex
was added into the submitted sequence at the 3' end (designated as twenty "X's" in the sequence). The progression of RT on
the 115-A RNA template for a 50, 100, and 150 nt extension is illustrated. The promiscuous template switching event to the
89-D template, near V4 stem-loop is also depicted. The "red" nucleotides represent the mismatched sequences between 115A and 89-D templates. Recombination sites were identified and mapped to the sequences between these base mismatches. The
"green stars" represent the recombination breakpoints identified in 16 recombinant clones from the reconstituted in vitro
assay in the absence of NC (Figure 4B) and "pink squares", those in 18 recombinant clones from the reconstituted in vitro
assay in the presence of NC (Figure 4B). The "blue circles" represent the breakpoints from five clones of the single cycle infection assay, i.e. identified in the C3-V4 region).

since the identification of these heterogenous recombination hotspots requires considerable RNA sequence diversity.
The C3/V4 hotspot for recombination may be driven by
pausing of reverse transcriptase on the 115A template,
which may be absent with the other RNA donor templates. The mechanism for preferential recombination at
this V4 stem-loop may be related to that observed at a similar recombination hotspot in the C2 region of env [24].
We are now exploring if a specific signature sequence and
RNA structural element was required for the 115-A-mediated strand transfer, as opposed to more random strand
transfer from the other HIV-1 RNA templates in this
region. A stem-loop structure may be present and promote recombination in the conserved regions of the env
genes of multiple HIV-1 subtypes. However, only the
appropriate sequence combination can generate similar
hairpins in a hypervariable region of the donor and acceptor RNA templates, and as consequence promote preferential recombination. This combination of sequence/
structure could also skew the direct relationship between
relative sequence identity and recombination frequency.

increase in circulating recombinant forms with ongoing
co-infection of cells and recombination. Therefore, it
quite reasonable to assume that recombination between
diverse HIV-1 env genes can result in non-functional envelope glycoprotein and as a consequence, replication defective or non-viable virus. We are currently examining the
proportion of viable, defective, and dead envelopes in the
three systems by cloning the products into expression vectors and assessing their function in cell fusion assays. In
addition, we are developing a mathematical model that
assumes all HIV-1 recombinants are viable in a multiple
cycle/dual infection assay. This model accounts for differences in replicative fitness, probability of mono- and dual
infections (represented by Poisson distributions), the relative production of homozygous versus heterozygous virions, frequency of recombination (derived from the single
cycle assays), and virus progeny production (both parental isolates and recombined viruses). Preliminary data
suggests that over 75% of the HIV-1 recombinants in a
dual infection are not replication competent and do not
contribute to the recombination frequency in the multiple
cycle system.

Conclusion
This study provides the first evidence that HIV-1 subtype
A and D isolates, found to co-circulate in Uganda
[20,21,43], can recombine in tissue culture (ex vivo) but
less efficiently than two isolates of the same subtype. As
described, selection for replication competent HIV-1
recombinants will likely result in an apparent decrease in
recombination frequencies generated in cells infected
with a heterozygous virion. In addition, differences in the
replicative fitness of the two primary HIV-1 isolates used
for co-infection will affect the rate of recombination [35].
Fitness is a complex parameter defined by replication
capacity in a given environment [44]. In terms of dual
infection of susceptible cells, increased replicative fitness
of one HIV-1 isolate over the other reduced the frequency
of co-infected cells, heterodiploid virus production, and
as a consequence, recombination frequency. It was quite
apparent from our results that increased replicative fitness
of one HIV-1 isolate over the other in the dual infection
reduced recombination frequency. The relevance of this
observation can be quite profound on recombination
within a dually infected individual considering even modest differences in replicative fitness can dramatically
decrease recombination frequency. Within this dually
infected individual, fitness differences rather than the
genetic differences between the infecting isolates can have
a greater impact on recombination.
Regardless of the impact of fitness, recombination frequencies in the multiple cycle system were still 5- to 10fold less than that observed in the single cycle system. This
observation is counter-intuitive due to the expected

We have shown that the frequency of intra- and intersubtype HIV-1 recombination during reverse transcription is
directly related to sequence identity of the parental HIV-1
isolates and is dependent on equal replicative fitness of
both isolates in a dual infection. However, the preferential
sites of recombination with specific HIV-1 isolates (e.g. at
C3 region of 115-A virus) can alter this relationship
between sequence identity and recombination frequency.
As described, a specific RNA sequence/structure combination between two diverse HIV-1 isolates may result in a
unique recombination "hotspot". Following multiple
rounds of virus replication, less than 25% of these intraor intersubtype recombinant genomes (in this case, env
genes) are replication competent and survive the competition with parental HIV-1 isolates. These findings suggest
that the initial selection of replication competency may
preceded the selection based on transmission efficiency,
host immune evasion, and many other parameters
responsible for shaping the evolution of unique and circulating recombinant forms (URF and CRFs) of HIV-1 isolates found in the epidemic. The impact of selection based
on replication efficiency versus the host-mediated selection is now being investigated using Ugandan samples.

Methods
Cells
293T cells and U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (from
Invitrogen) and maintained at 37°C with 10% CO2. CD4
and CXCR4 expression in the U87 cell cultures was

Retrovirology 2006, 3:91

selected with 300 mg/mL Geneticin (G418) and 1 mg/mL
puromycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively. MT4
cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37°C
with 5% CO2.
Viruses
Five non-syncytium inducing (NSI) HIV-1 isolates were
isolated from HIV-infected Ugandans, characterized for
co-receptor usage, and subtyped based on phylogenetic
sequence analyses as previously described [28]. Two primary subtype A HIV-1 isolates (115-A and 120-A) and
three subtype D strains (89-D, 122-D, and 126-D) were
selected. Due to previous confusion in strain nomenclature, we have modified the virus names from that previously published (A14 is now 115-A, A15 = 120-A, D13 =
122-D, D14 = 126-D, and D15 = 89-D) [28]. All HIV-1
isolates were syncytium-inducing (SI) and utilized the
CXCR4-coreceptor (X4) for entry [28]. All viral stocks
were previously propagated and expanded in PHA-stimulated, IL-2 treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells as
described [28]. Tissue culture dose for 50% infectivity
(TCID50) was determined for each isolate using the Reed
and Muench method [45], and titers were expressed as
infectious units per milliliter (IU/ml) [46]. All the env
genes of these HIV-1 isolates have been previously
sequenced [28], aligned, and have the following accession
numbers: 115-A, 120-A, 89-D, 122-D, and 126-D.
Single cycle tissue culture assay
Single cycle assays were completed using an assay previously developed by our laboratory [30,32]. HIV-1 envelope gene fragments from subtypes A and D (HXB2 nt
6420–7520) were PCR amplified from viral DNA and
cloned in a pKS-derived Knr/ORI plasmid following
standard cloning techniques [32,47]. As previously
described, we have designed two types of plasmids, pLac+
and pLac- plasmids carry, as genetic markers, either a functional LacZ' gene or a sequence complementary to the
mRNA coding for Escherichia coli malT gene, respectively.
These two genetic markers, lac+ and lac- in their respective
plasmids are schematically represented in Figure 2B. All
constructions were verified by sequencing. [48,49]Defective retrovirus particles were produced as described [30].
The medium was replaced 8 h after transfection, and the
vector supernatants were recovered 36 h later. Non-internalized DNA was removed by treatment of the vector
supernatants with DNaseI (1 μg/ml in the presence of 1
μM MgCl2) for 30 min at 37°C. Amount of p24 present in
supernatants was determined by using the HIV-1 p24
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (PerkinElmer
Life Sciences). When necessary, vector supernatants were
concentrated by using Centricon® YM-50 centrifugal filter
devices (Amicon-Millipore) before transduction.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/91

MT4 cells were transduced with 200 ng of p24 antigen per
106 cells (an approximate multiplicity of infection of 20)
in 35-mm dishes in a 500-μl volume. Two hours posttransduction, the cells were diluted up to a 4-ml volume
with supplemented RPMI medium and maintained at
37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 40 h. The reverse transcription products were purified by Hirt [50] as described
[51]. The purified double stranded DNA was digested
with DpnI for 2 h at 37°C (in order to eliminate possible
contaminating DNA of bacterial origin) prior to PCR
amplification (20 cycles) with primers BH and SH (Figure
2). The amplified product was purified after electrophoresis on agarose gel, digested with PstI and BamHI, ligated
into an appropriate plasmid vector and transformed in
E.coli. Plating on IPTG/X-Gal containing dishes allowed
blue/white screening of recombinant and parental colonies, respectively [30].
In Vitro recombination assays
In vitro recombination assays were performed using the
reconstituted system previously developed in our laboratory [47]. RNA synthesis was performed as previously
described [52]. RT purification and activity tests were carried out as described by Canard and colleagues [53]. Constructs used for RNA synthesis were generated following
standard cloning procedures. Reverse transcription was
carried out on the donor RNA (100 mM) in the presence
of an equimolar amount of acceptor RNA after annealing
an oligonucleotide specifically onto the donor template.
Reverse transcription was started by the addition of HIV-1
RT at a final concentration of 400 nM and carried out for
60 min. Synthesis of the second DNA strand, BamHI and
PstI digestion, ligation, and E. coli transformation were
carried out as previously described [47]. The frequency of
recombination is derived from the rate of blue colonies
(recombinant) divided by the sum of blue plus white
(parental) colonies.
Measuring the frequency of recombination in the in vitro
reverse transcription assay and single-cycle infection assay
To determine the frequency of recombination in the single cycle assay, the total number of blue and white colonies were calculated and applied in the equation as
previously described [30]. The frequency of recombination (F) is calcuated by the equation F = b/(2/3 [N(n/48)
+ b]), where N and b are the total number of white and
blue colonies, respectively. The recombination rates per
nucleotide (f) within a given interval (i) is given by f =
F(xi/X)/z, where F is as above, xi is the number of colonies
analyzed where recombination was identified to have
occurred within the interval considered, X is the total
number of colonies on which mapping was performed,
and z is the size in nucleotides of the interval. This takes
into account the generation of heterozygous particles as
described by the Hardy-Weinberg equation [38] and the

Page 13 of 17

Retrovirology 2006, 3:91

bias introduced into the estimation of the frequency of
recombination by cloning reverse transcription products
from lac -/- (1/3) relative to lac +/- vectors [30]. For the calculation of the frequency of recombination in heterozygous particles, the total number of colonies must be
multiplied by two-thirds. To accurately estimate the frequency of recombination, another factor to take into
account is the background among the white colonies
derived from cloning of cellular DNA which co-purified
with the reverse transcription products. Typically, 48
white colonies are analyzed in each assay and a correction
factor is established, given by n/48, where n is the number
of colonies resulting from cloning of reverse transcription
products (very rare).
HIV-1 dual infection assay
Different pairs of two HIV-1 isolates were used to simultaneously infect PBMC as described previously [54]. We performed four separate dual infections of U87.CXC4.CD4
cells with two HIV-1 isolates at the same multiplicity of
infection (i.e. 10-2:10-2 or 10-3:10-3). Virus mixtures were
added to adherent U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells (500,000/well)
for 2 h at 37°C, 5% CO2 in DMEM complete medium.
Supernatants and two aliquots of cells were harvested at
peak virus production (typically day 10) as measured by
reverse transcriptase activity in the supernatant [46,55].
Cells were resuspended in 10% DMSO/90% fetal bovine
serum, and then stored at -80°C for subsequent analysis.
PCR strategy to amplify HIV-1 recombinants in the
multiple cycle assay
For all dual infection experiments, proviral DNA was
extracted from lysed PBMC using the QIAamp DNA Blood
Kit (Qiagen). A segment of the env genes of HIV-1 genome
were PCR amplified using a set of universal primers: envB
[56] – envN [57] for a ~3 Kbp fragment encoding the
gp120 of env. Subtype-specific primers internal to the previous env products were then used to PCR amplify subtype
A/D recombinants of using subtype- or isolate-specific
primers, a115-envC1 (TAGTGCAGAAAAGCATAATG; a
115-A-specific sense primer), d-envC4 (TGTCAATTTCTCTTTCCCAC; a subtype-D specific antisense primer),
a120-envC1 (AAGCATATGATGCAGAAGTAC; a 120-D
specific sense primer), d-envC1 (TAAAACAGAGGCACATAATA; a subtype D specific sense primer), and a-envC4
(TGCTAATTTCTTTATCCCAT; a subtype A specific antisense primer). For intrasubtype dual infections, the following subtype-specific primers were used: a115-envC4
(CCTCTTGCCAAGAATGTTC; a 115-A antisense primer),
a120-envC4 (TCTAGTGTCTGGACCGAT; a 120-D antisense primer), d122-envC1 (GTCAGGGCGAGCATACTA;
122-D sense primer), d122-envC4 (CCCAGTGGTTCAATCTC; a 122-D antisense primer), d126-envC1
(ACAAGGGCAAGCATGGTA; a 126-D sense primer), and
d126-envC4 (GACCTAGTGGCTCAATTTTTAC; a 126-D

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/91

antisense primer). All of these intrasubtype and intersubtype specific primer sets flanked the C1 to C4 regions of
env (nt positions of approximately 6520 to 7740). Both
external and nested PCR reactions were carried out in a
100-μl reaction mixture with defined cycling conditions
[31]. PCR-amplified products were separated on agarose
gels and then purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Control PCR amplifications were performed with subtype-specific DNA templates to rule out
the possibility of Taq-generated recombinants [58]. These
isolate/subtype specific templates were generated by cloning the PCR amplified env gene of virus 115-A, 120-A, and
89-D, 122-D, and 126-D into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen).
As an amplification/PCR quantitation control for recombination frequency calculations, plasmids containing
entire env gene of the subtype A and D viruses were serially
diluted and PCR amplified. Intensities of these products
on agarose gels were then used as a standard curves and to
calculate copy number of recombined viral RNA molecules in the dual infection based on the intensity of RTPCR amplified products.
Calculating the frequency of recombination in the multiple
cycle dual infection assay
To determine the frequency of recombination after multiple rounds of infection and replication in tissue culture,
external and nested PCR amplification were used with
subtype or isolate specific primers as described above. The
frequency of recombination was determined using both
parental sequence primer sets (eg. d-envC1 – d-envC4),
and recombinant primer sets (eg. d-envC1 – a115-envC1).
The frequency of recombination was determined by quantifying the intensity of the PCR products on an agarose gel
using Quantity One software (BioRad). Copy number of
recombined and parental HIV-1 DNA is then derived by
the intensity of the product compared to that of amplified
product from known copy numbers of plasmid controls.
The recombination frequency is calculated by dividing the
total recombinant virus production by the total virus production in the system.
Heteroduplex tracking assay for detection of two HIV-1
env fragments
Nested PCR products of the env gene were analyzed by
heteroduplex tracking analysis [54]. The same genomic
regions were PCR amplified from a subtype E HIV-1 env
clone (E-pTH22) [59] for use as a DNA probe. For this
amplification, the E80 primer was radiolabeled with T4
polynucleotide kinase and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and paired
with the E125 primer to amplify the C2-C4 region of env
[54]. The same pair of cold primers were employed to PCR
amplify the HIV-1 env DNA from each dual infection.
Radiolabeled PCR-amplified probes were separated on
1% agarose gels and purified with the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Reaction mixtures contained DNA

annealing buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH
7.8], and 2 mM EDTA), 10 μl of unlabeled PCR-amplified
DNA from the competition culture, and approximately
0.1 pmol of radioactive probe DNA [54]. The competition
and probe DNA in this mixture was then denatured at
95°C for 3 min and then rapidly annealed on wet ice.
After 30 min on ice, the DNA heteroduplexes were
resolved on Tris-borate-EDTA buffer on 5 to 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (30:0.8 acrylamide-bisacrylamide) for 2.5 h at 200 V. The percentage of
polyacrylamide in the gel matrix was dependent on the
size of the amplified product employed in the heteroduplex tracking analysis. Gels were dried and exposed to Xray film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y.). Heteroduplexes representing production of each isolate in a dual
infection were quantified with the Bio-Rad Phosphorimager.
Estimation of viral fitness
In our HIV-1 competition experiments, the final ratio of
the two viruses produced from a dual infection was determined by heteroduplex tracking analysis and compared to
production in the monoinfections. Production of individual HIV-1 isolates in a dual infection (f0) was divided by
the initial proportion in the inoculum (io) and is referred
to as relative fitness (w = f0/i0) [54]. The ratio of the relative fitness values of each HIV-1 variant in the competition is a measure of the fitness difference (WD) between
the two HIV-1 strains (WD = wM/wL), where wM and wL correspond to the relative fitness of the more and less fit
virus, respectively [54]. As indicated in the text, viral fitness can also be calculated from the parental specific PCR
products.
Reverse transcription/strand transfer reactions
These reconstituted in vitro reverse transcription reactions
focused on template switching in the C3 region of env
using 115-A or 120-A donor RNA and 89-D acceptor RNA
templates. For these reactions RNA transcripts were made
from PCR products derived from the subtype clones.
Primer pairs (5' GATTTAGGTGACACTATAGATATAATGAGGTAGTCAAACAATTA-3' and 5'-TTTATTCTGCATTTGAGAGT-3'
for
115-A,
5'GATTTAGGTGACACTATAGATATAAGGAGGTAGCCAAACAATTA-3' and 5'-TTTATTCTGCATTGGAGAGT-3'
for
120-A,
and
5'GATTTAGGTGACACTATAGTATATAGAATGGAATAAAACTATAC-3' and 5'-ACCGTTTGTGTTTGTACTCT-3' for 89-D) were used in PCR reactions to
amplify nts 7255-7474 (relative to HXB-2 provirus numbering) for 115-A and 120-A, and 7235-7454 for 89-D.
The bolded regions of the primers are SP6 promoter
sequences while italicized regions are non HIV sequences.
PCR products were recovered on native polyacrylamide
gels and SP6 RNA polymerase was used to produce run-off

transcripts of 225 nts. A DNA primer that binds specifically to the donor RNA transcript (5'-TTTATTCTGCATTTGAGAGT-3' or 5'-TTTATTCTGCATTGGAGAGT-3' for A115 and A-102, respectively) was 32P-labeled at the 5' end
with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). The donor RNA
was hybridized to a complementary labeled primer by
mixing primer:transcript at approximately 3:1 ratio in 50
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, 80 mM KCl. The mixture was heated to 65°C for 5 min and then slowly cooled
to room temperature. Donor RNA-primer DNA hybrids (2
nM final concentration of RNA) were preincubated for 3
min in the presence or absence of 10 nM acceptor RNA
template and NC (as indicated) in 42 μl of buffer (see
below) at 37°C. One molecule of NC per two nucleotides
was used in the reactions. Wild-type and mutant NC proteins from the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain were prepared as
explained previously[60,61]. The reactions were initiated
by the addition of 8 μl of HIV-RT (80 nM final in reactions) to a mixture of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM
dithiothreitol, 80 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 100 μM dNTPs,
5 mM AMP (pH 7.0), 25 μM ZnCl2 and 0.4 units/μl RNase
inhibitor. Reactions were allowed to incubate for 0, 30 s,
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 min at 37°C prior to quenching
a 6 μl aliquot of each reaction with 4 μl 25 mM EDTA (pH
8.0) and 2.5 ng of RNase-DNase free enzyme for 20 min
at 37°C. Two μl of proteinase K at 2 mg/ml in 1.25% SDS,
15 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) was then
added to the above mixture, which was placed at 65°C for
1 hour. Finally, 12 μl of 2X formamide dye (90% formamide, 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1%
bromophenol blue) was added to the mixture and the
samples were resolved on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. Extended DNA products
were quantified by phosphorimager analysis using a BioRad FX phosphoimager.
