A whole dog genome analysis was perfomed using RetroTector© to identify and define the complexity of canine
endogenous retroviruses (CfERV). Results show that all
dog chromosomes contain CfERV integrations. Furthermore, the integration pattern was shown to be uneven
with some regions essentially devoid of integrations and
other regions having large amounts of CfERV integrations.
The dog may well have been effective in protecting its
genome from integrations of most types of endogenous
retroviruses. Compared to mouse, chimpanzee and
human, dog has substantially lower amounts of ERVs. We
identified a total of 416 ERVs, which is only approximately a fifth of the amount of HERVs found in the
human genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the
vast majority of CfERVs cluster with the gammaretrovirus
genus (n = 318). The second most common group was the
beta-retroviruses (n = 27). This pattern is similar in other
vertebrates. In addition, three spuma-like and four gypsylike CfERVs were identified. The latter group is rare in vertebrate genomes. Moreover, we identified a group of 55
CfERVs with mixed phylogenetic relationship to any
known retroviral genera. The integration pattern of
CfERVs was analyzed in relation to genes in their vicinity
and a substantial fraction of CfERV was found within
annotated genes and within 100 kb from annotated dog
genes. Interestingly, a group of recently integrated CfERVs
with similarity to HERV-Fc1 was found. Several of them
had all or nearly all major reading frames open, a sign of

functionality. Therefore, some of these CfERVs may have
potential for active retrotransposition and thus actively
contribute to the plasticity of canine genomes. The differential distribution and amounts of ERVs in the dog
genome compared to genomes in the primate and rodent
clades suggest species-specific mechanisms of purging different classes of ERVs.
