Background
We have recently shown that transmitted/founder
virus(es) can be identified unambiguously using single
genome amplification (SGA) (Keele, PNAS, 2008; Salazar,
JEM, 2009) and that in heterosexual transmissions
approximately 80% of patients are infected by a single
virus or infected cell (Keele, PNAS, 2008; Haaland, PLoS
Pathogens, 2009; Abrahams, JVirol, 2009). Here we
explore the characteristics of virus transmission in men
who have sex with men (MSM) and injection drug users
(IDU).

Methods
Full-length env sequences were derived by SGA from
plasma vRNA from 30 acutely infected MSM and 11 IDU
from North America. Modes of infection were determined
by self-report. Uncloned amplicons were sequenced,
aligned, and analyzed by neighbor-joining phylogenies
and the Highlighter tool.

missions, the median number of t/f variants was 3 for
MSM and 5 for IDU. Differences in single versus multiple
virus transmissions among HSX, MSM and IDU were statistically significant (p < 0.006).

Conclusion
The HIV-1 transmission event is different in HSX, MSM
and IDU. We see single variant transmission in approximately 80% of HSX, 60% of MSM and 40% of IDU. When
multiple transmissions occur, they tend to have a higher
number of variants in IDU than in MSM or HSX. These
findings indicate that risk of HIV-1 acquisition correlates
with numbers of transmitted viruses. This, along with the
phenotypic properties of these viruses (especially Env),
may be important in vaccine design and assessment.

Results
Maximum within-patient diversity ranged from 0.08–
7.12%. In the MSM group, 19 of 30 (63%) acutely
infected subjects had evidence of a single transmitted/
founder (t/f) virus and 11 of the 30 had evidence of transmission by a minimum of 2–10 viruses. In the IDU group,
4 of the 11(36%) had evidence of a single t/f virus, while
the remaining 7 demonstrated transmission by a minimum of 3–19 variants. In the subjects with multiple trans-
