Multiplex genotyping system for efficient
inference of matrilineal genetic ancestry with
continental resolution
Mannis van Oven, Mark Vermeulen and Manfred Kayser*

Abstract
Background: In recent years, phylogeographic studies have produced detailed knowledge on the worldwide
distribution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants, linking specific clades of the mtDNA phylogeny with certain
geographic areas. However, a multiplex genotyping system for the detection of the mtDNA haplogroups of major
continental distribution that would be desirable for efficient DNA-based bio-geographic ancestry testing in various
applications is still missing.
Results: Three multiplex genotyping assays, based on single-base primer extension technology, were developed
targeting a total of 36 coding-region mtDNA variants that together differentiate 43 matrilineal haplo-/paragroups. These
include the major diagnostic haplogroups for Africa, Western Eurasia, Eastern Eurasia and Native America. The assays
show high sensitivity with respect to the amount of template DNA: successful amplification could still be obtained
when using as little as 4 pg of genomic DNA and the technology is suitable for medium-throughput analyses.
Conclusions: We introduce an efficient and sensitive multiplex genotyping system for bio-geographic ancestry
inference from mtDNA that provides resolution on the continental level. The method can be applied in forensics,
to aid tracing unknown suspects, as well as in population studies, genealogy and personal ancestry testing. For
more complete inferences of overall bio-geographic ancestry from DNA, the mtDNA system provided here can be
combined with multiplex systems for suitable autosomal and, in the case of males, Y-chromosomal ancestrysensitive DNA markers.

Background
Establishing the geographic region of a person’s genetic
origin - also called bio-geographic ancestry - is of forensic relevance when the short tandem repeat (STR) profile of trace DNA found at a crime scene does not
match that of a suspect or does not yield any matches
in a criminal DNA database because it may provide
investigative leads to finding unknown persons [1]. Similarly, such information can be useful for locating antemortem samples or putative relatives of unidentified
body remains, including disaster victim identification
[2]. Furthermore, inferring geographic information from
DNA data is important in population history studies
[3,4] and has gained attention in the growing field of
personal ancestry testing [5,6].

Several years of intensive research into the understanding of the geographic distribution of human genetic
diversity present in the non-recombining mitochondrial
genome and respective parts of the Y-chromosome
(NRY), mostly for population history purposes, have produced an immense body of knowledge allowing us to
pick specific mtDNA and NRY markers with restricted
(sub)continental distributions [4,7,8]. MtDNA is especially useful for forensic application due to its high copy
number (hundreds to thousands of copies per cell) and
small size (16.6 kb), which allows the analysis of small
amounts of degraded DNA often encountered in crimescene situations [9]. Although mtDNA only reveals information about matrilineal ancestry, it can be seen as a
first step toward a more comprehensive picture of personal ancestry when combined with suitable NRY and autosomal DNA evidence [10,11]. Furthermore, investigating
the geographic origin of mtDNA in comparison to that

of the Y-chromosome in a population can also reveal
insights into sex-biased aspects of human population history such as those caused by patri- or matrilocal residence patterns [12].
In human population genetics studies, the typical
approach for mtDNA analysis consists of sequencing the
first hypervariable segment (HVS1), sometimes in combination with HVS2, within the non-coding control region
(see, for example [13,14]), whereas in forensics it has
nowadays become standard practice to sequence the entire
control region [15]. Although haplogroup inference from
HVS sequence data is possible for many mtDNA haplogroups, not all haplogroups present suitable diagnostic
variants in HVS1 and/or HVS2 that allow an unequivocal
assignment. In such cases, simple nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; i.e. single-nucleotide polymorphisms as well
as small insertions and deletions) from the coding region
of mtDNA are required in order to establish the haplogroup status. Moreover, because SNP typing assays are
usually more sensitive and consume less DNA than
sequencing, in many cases it might be desirable to perform
SNP genotyping alone (in the absence of HVS data) or
prior to HVS sequencing [16,17].
Several mtDNA SNP multiplex assays have already
been developed focussing on particular geographic subregions (see, for example, [18]) or on the dissection of
particular haplogroups (see, for example, [19]). However,
what is missing so far is an mtDNA SNP multiplex system that includes the mtDNA haplogroups of major
continental distribution. We describe a sensitive genotyping system based on single-base primer extension
technology, consisting of three independent multiplex
assays that together include 36 SNPs determining 43
mtDNA haplo-/paragroups that allow the inference of
matrilineal bio-geographic ancestry at the level of continental resolution.

Results and discussion
Multiplexes and targeted haplogroups

MtDNA coding-region SNPs defining the major haplogroups that occur in Africa, Western Eurasia, Eastern
Eurasia and Native America were carefully selected
(Figure 1) and combined into three multiplex genotyping assays (Figures 2, 3, 4) each consisting of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification step and a
subsequent single-base primer extension step (Tables 1,
2, 3). The haplogroups detectable with Multiplex 1 and
2 are broadly similar to those typed by the Genographic
Project [20] with some noticeable exceptions. Multiplex
1 (Figure 2) was designed to target haplogroups L0/L1,
L2/L4/L6, L3, M, M1, C, D, N, N1, I, W, A, X and
R. Due to the homoplasy of some of the selected
markers in the worldwide mtDNA phylogeny [7], Multiplex 1 can additionally detect some (relatively rare)

Page 2 of 14

haplogroups that were not originally intended, namely
L0k/L0d1a/L0d3, L5, X2a1, R11/B6 and B4a1. The hierarchical organization of the mitochondrial SNPs in Multiplex 1 ensures that all these haplogroups, intended and
unintended, are well differentiable (Figure 2). Some haplogroups are only identified with Multiplex 1 on a broad
level and, in those cases, additional genotyping with Multiplex 2 or 3 is needed to achieve further haplogroup
resolution and final geographic inferences. Multiplex 2
(Figure 3) targets haplogroup R and haplogroups nested
within R, namely R0, HV, HV0a (which includes V), H,
R9 (which includes F), B, J, T, U, U6 and U8b (which
includes K). A notable difference with the Genographic
Project SNP panel [20] is that we included in our
multiplexes haplogroups M1 and U6 which have a predominantly African distribution, probably due to backmigration events to Africa [21]. As such, Multiplex 1
and 2 together offer a convenient method for the classification of unknown mtDNAs into any of the major
worldwide mtDNA haplogroups. However, they do not
allow for the differentiation of the Native American
subsets of otherwise Eastern Eurasian haplogroups A,
B, C and D and Western Eurasian/African haplogroup
X. Therefore, we designed a third assay, Multiplex 3
(Figure 4), which specifically aims at detecting the
Native American haplogroups A2, B2, C1, C4c, D1,
D4h3a and X2a, as well as Eskimo/Siberian haplogroups A2a, A2b, D2a and D3 and Eastern Eurasian
haplogroup C1a [22]. Together, the three multiplexes
include 36 different coding-region mtDNA SNPs (of
which 34 are single-nucleotide transitions/transversions
and two are small insertion/deletion polymorphisms).
It should be noted that, despite the fact that haplogroups M1, C and D within macrohaplogroup M,
haplogroups N1, A, W and X within macrohaplogroup
N, and haplogroups R0, R9, B, JT and U within macrohaplogroup R, can be detected with the method, much
of the Southern Asian, East/Southeast Asian and Oceanic variation within M, N and R remains unresolved
(denoted as M*, N* and R*, respectively, in Figure 1).
However, this is inevitable given the large number of
independent haplogroups descending from M, N and R
but it can be overcome by developing additional multiplex assays that specifically target the relevant subhaplogroups for those regions.
Design and optimization

The successful dessign of a useful multiplex single-base
extension assay requires careful consideration of the
SNPs and their PCR amplification primers as well as
extension primers, followed by extensive laboratory testing [23]. One criterion of SNP selection was the overall
level of homoplasy of the marker in the entire mtDNA
phylogeny [7]. For each haplogroup, one or several

multiplex assays allows any person’s mtDNA to be classified into one of the colour-labelled haplogroups. Colours correspond to the geographic
origin of the haplogroups as indicated. SNP position numbers are relative to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS). Deletion
mutations are denoted by the suffix ‘d’. Recurrent SNPs are underlined. The numbers 1, 2 or 3 in square brackets shown for each SNP refer to
the respective multiplex assay in which the SNP is included. Note: haplogroups F, K and V are encompassed within R9, U8b and HV0a,

defining SNPs are available; in the latter case care was
taken to select the more stable (phylogenetically less
recurrent) SNP sites. Nevertheless, some of the selected
SNPs do occur more than once in the phylogeny
(underlined in Figure 1) as discussed above. Notably,
Multiplex 1 contains two tri-allelic SNPs: nucleotide
position (np) 3552 is either a T (ancestral state), an A
(haplogroup C), or a C (haplogroup X2a1); and np
12950 is either an A (ancestral state), a C (haplogroup
M1) or a G (haplogroups L5, R11 and B6). Primer
design using Primer3Plus [24] considered small amplicon size and avoided numt amplification [25]. The compatibility of primers within the same multiplex was
checked with AutoDimer [26], especially avoiding 3’ end
complementarities. Amplicon sizes were kept small, ranging from 80 to 237 bp with an average of 133 bp
(Tables 1, 2, 3), in order to facilitate the amplification of
(partially) degraded DNA typically encountered in forensic settings as well as in population history studies when

using difficult source materials (for example, ancient
DNA). All primers were first tested in singleplex before
combining them in a multiplex. Primers that showed
substantial artifacts were replaced by alternatively
designed primers. In order to ensure electrophoretic
separation of extension primer products, extension primers within the same multiplex were given different
lengths by adding 5’ non-homologous (poly)GACT tails
(Tables 1, 2, 3). Peak heights in the electropherograms
(Figures 5, 6) were balanced by adjusting primer
concentrations in the PCR and extension reactions
(Tables 1, 2, 3).
Haplogroup distribution and inferring bio-geographic
ancestry

The labels used to describe the geographic affiliations of
the haplogroups (Figure 1) mostly correspond to one of
four regions or continents of the world, namely Africa,
Western Eurasia, Eastern Eurasia and Native America,

consistent with the terminology used in human genetics
and anthropology literature. With some haplogroups,
however, only combined regions can be inferred, namely
Western Eurasia/Africa, Western Eurasia/Southern Asia,
Eastern Eurasia/Oceania, Native America/Eastern Eurasia and Eastern Eurasia/Southern Asia/Oceania (Figure
1). While these geographic designations are convenient
descriptors of the ‘center of gravity’ of haplogroup
occurrence, it is important to keep in mind that, instead
of sharp genetic borders, there exist transition areas
between continents. Populations from the Middle East,
for example, carry a considerable portion of African
mtDNA lineages [27]. Similarly, Northern Africa has a
relatively large portion of Western Eurasian mtDNA
lineages [28,29]. In addition, the Central Asian mtDNA
pool is composed of Western Eurasian, Eastern Eurasian
and, to a lesser extent, also Southern Asian components
[30,31]

Furthermore, one should be aware that traditional distribution patterns of genetic variation, including
mtDNA, may have been affected by (evolutionary
recent) migration/admixture events, including as a result
of colonialism, so that some populations carry portions
of ancestry from multiple geographic regions. The most
prominent case is, perhaps, the American continent
where, due to colonization by Europeans which started
around the beginning of the 16th century and the subsequent European introduction of African slaves, the current population carries a mixture of Native American,
Western Eurasian and African mtDNA lineages, in varying proportions depending on the subpopulation
[10,11,14,32,33]. Other well-known cases include Madagascar (African and Eastern Eurasian lineages) [13], and
coastal/island parts of Near Oceania, as well as all of
Remote Oceania (Oceanic and Eastern Eurasian
lineages) [34]. In addition, groups of more or less recent

immigrants often carry a mixture of ‘native’ lineages and
lineages typical from the area to which they moved. For
example, Polish Roma, having an ultimate origin in
India, harbour both Southern Asian and Western Eurasian mtDNA variants [35]. Finally, rare cases have been
reported where European individuals carried African
mtDNA haplogroups without being aware of any African ancestry [36]. Therefore, for any bio-geographic
ancestry prediction purposes, mtDNA evidence should
be interpreted in the context of the relevant local demographic history. Also, because mtDNA only reflects the
matrilineal portion of a person’s genetic ancestry, ideally
the markers should be combined with evidence obtained
from autosomal and/or (when dealing with male DNA)
Y-chromosome markers, to obtain a more accurate picture of a person’s overall ancestry.
Sensitivity testing

In order to establish the sensitivity of our multiplex
assays we performed tests with different starting
amounts of genomic DNA, ranging from 25 ng to 1 pg
of template DNA, for four individuals originating from
different continents and with respective diagnostic haplogroups: a European with haplogroup J; an African with

L3*(xM,N); a Native American with C1*(xC1a); and an
East Asian with R9 (Figures 5, 6). This enabled us to
monitor the behaviour of the different SNP alleles with
decreasing amounts of template DNA. Overall, we
observed high sensitivity and basically full profiles could
be obtained with all three multiplexes for all four individuals with as little as 4 pg of DNA template (with the
only exception of 13368 in Multiplex 2 that sometimes
caused difficulties in allele calling with 4 pg and lower).
Marker dropouts for some SNPs in all the individuals
and all three multiplexes (except for Multiplex 1 in the
European and the African sample and with Multiplex 3
in the European) started to occur only at the 1 pg level,
as well as allele-calling difficulties for some other SNPs
in all three multiplexes (Figures 5, 6). The achieved sensitivity is similar to that of two previously published
mtDNA multiplex assays [18,37] but, presumably, higher
than that of many other published mtDNA multiplexes
which typically require 1-10 ng DNA (for example
[19,38-40]; although many such studies do not provide
details on sensitivity). Furthermore, the achieved sensitivity of our assays is significantly higher than that of
commercially available STR multiplexes [41-43], which
can be expected due to the higher relative abundance of

mtDNA as compared to nuclear DNA. When working
with ancient DNA or forensic trace DNA, it might be
useful to quantify the amount of human DNA prior to
genotyping because, in such situations, human DNA
often represents only a fraction of total DNA due to the
presence of non-human (for example, bacterial, fungal,
or others) DNA.
Illustration of the method application

In order to illustrate the reliability of our method in
inferring bio-geographic ancestry from mtDNA, we
compared in worldwide individuals, their haplogroup
status as determined from full mtDNA sequence data
and their population affiliation known from the sampling region, with the haplogroup and corresponding
geographic information obtainable from our multiplex
SNP assays (Table 4). The data used for this purpose
consisted of 75 samples from the Centre d’Etude du
Polymorphisme Humain-Human Genome Diversity Project (CEPH-HGDP) panel [44] for which entire mitochondrial genome sequences are available [45]. From
the full mtDNA sequences we extracted the alleles of
those SNP sites that are included in our assays and used
the resulting genotypes to infer haplogroups and respective geographic regions of matrilineal origin. In all cases,

the haplogroups inferable by our assays were consistent
with the full sequence-based haplogroups (although a
more detailed haplogroup assignment could be achieved
from the sequence data as expected); accordingly, the
regions of bio-geographic ancestry derived from the
assay-inferable haplogroups were in agreement with the
individuals’ sampling origins (Table 4). For example,
sample HGDP01076 is an individual from Sardinia
(Italy) whose full mtDNA sequence can be classified as
haplogroup J2b1a; our assays would predict the haplogroup of this person as J with Western Eurasian geographic origin. Notably, the HGDP samples from
Pakistan exhibit both Western Eurasian and Southern
Asian haplogroups (for example, HGDP00163 belongs
to Western Eurasian haplogroup H2a and HGDP00165
belongs to Southern Asian haplogroup M30), consistent
with previous observations (see Discussion above). Similarly, the Bedouin samples belong to both African as
well as Western Eurasian haplogroups.

Conclusions
We developed an efficient and sensitive method for the
multiplex genotyping of informative mtDNA SNPs,
allowing for the inference of a person’s matrilineal biogeographic ancestry at a continental level. We would

Figure 5 Electropherograms of Multiplex 1-3 for a European and an African individual, using varying amounts of initial DNA template.
(A) European individual of haplogroup J; (B) African individual of haplogroup L3*(xM,N). The three multiplex assays were each performed on five
different starting amounts of DNA template, ranging from 0.25 ng to 0.001 ng. Grey circles indicate marker dropouts that occur at the very low
DNA concentration whereas grey arrows indicate cases where allele calling becomes difficult due to artefacts that come up at the low DNA
concentrations.

each performed on five different starting amounts of DNA template, ranging from 0.25 ng to 0.001 ng. Grey circles indicate marker dropouts

like to emphasize that matrilineal ancestry must be seen
as reflecting only one aspect of the overall bio-geographic ancestry of a person [5,6,46]. A more accurate
establishment of the overall bio-geographic ancestry is
achievable when mtDNA is used in conjunction with
informative Y-chromosomal (in the case of males) [8]
and autosomal ancestry-informative DNA markers
[47-50], especially when a person’s biological ancestors
are from different geographic regions resulting in mixed
bio-geographic ancestry.

Methods
Reaction conditions

Multiplex PCR amplification was carried out in a reaction
volume of 6 μL, containing 1x GeneAmp PCR Gold buffer
(Applied Biosystems, CA, USA), 4.5 mM MgCl2 (Applied
Biosystems), 100 μM of each dNTP (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany), 0.35 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase
(Applied Biosystems), 0.001 to 1 ng genomic DNA template, and PCR primers (desalted; Metabion, Martinsried,
Germany) in concentrations as specified in Tables 1, 2, 3.
The reactions were performed in a Dual 384-well GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) using optical 384-well reaction plates (Applied Biosystems), with the

following cyclic conditions: 10 min at 95°C; followed by 30
cycles of 94°C for 15 s; 60°C for 45 s; and a final extension
at 60°C for 5 min. PCR products were purified by adding
1.5 μL ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, OH, USA) to 6 μL
PCR product, followed by incubation at 37°C for 15 min
and 80°C for 15 min. Multiplex single-base primer extension was carried out in a reaction volume of 5 μL, containing 1 μL SNaPshot Ready Reaction Mix (Applied
Biosystems), 1 μL purified PCR product and extension primers (HPLC-purified; Metabion, Martinsried, Germany)
in concentrations as specified in Tables 1, 2, 3. The reactions were performed in a Dual 384-well GeneAmp PCR
System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) using optical 384-well
reaction plates (Applied Biosystems), with the following
cycling conditions: 2 min at 96°C; followed by 25 cycles of
96°C for 10 s; 50°C for 5 s; and 60°C for 30 s. The reaction
products were purified by adding 1 unit of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (USB Corporation) to 5 μL of extension
product, followed by incubation at 37°C for 45 min and
75°C for 15 min. PCR and extension primer details can be
found in Table 1 for Multiplex 1, in Table 2 for Multiplex
2 and in Table 3 for Multiplex 3.
Extended primers were separated by capillary electrophoresis on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied

Biosystems) using POP-7 polymer by loading a mixture
of 1 μL purified extension product, 8.8 μL Hi-Di formamide (Applied Biosystems) and 0.2 μL GeneScan-120
LIZ internal size standard (Applied Biosystems). Results
were analysed using GeneMapper version 3.7 software
(Applied Biosystems).

Dilution series

For the purpose of sensitivity testing, genomic DNA
from four individuals of different matrilineal continental
origin was extracted from buccal swabs. For each individual, the DNA was diluted to obtain a solution of precisely 1 ng/μL as determined by two independent
Quantifiler (Applied Biosystems) measurements. All
Quantifiler assays were carried out according to manufacturer’s recommendations. A dilution series was made
from each of the four 1 ng/μL DNA solutions, producing concentrations of 0.25, 0.063, 0.016, 0.004 and
0.001 ng/μL for each individual. Concentrations of the
dilutions were measured again and confirmed by triplicate Quantifiler measurements. The Quantifiler assays
were carried out according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, except for the addition of two extra dilutions to the recommended standard curve to be able to
measure the very low DNA concentrations.
