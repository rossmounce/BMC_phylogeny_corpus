Abstract
Background: Structural genes of the phenyl-propanoid pathway which encode flavonoid 3'- and 3',5'-hydroxylases (F3'H and
F3'5'H) have long been invoked to explain the biosynthesis of cyanidin- and delphinidin-based anthocyanin pigments in the socalled red cultivars of grapevine. The relative proportion of the two types of anthocyanins is largely under genetic control and
determines the colour variation among red/purple/blue berry grape varieties and their corresponding wines.
Results: Gene fragments of VvF3'H and VvF3'5'H, that were isolated from Vitis vinifera 'Cabernet Sauvignon' using degenerate
primers designed on plant homologous genes, translated into 313 and 239 amino acid protein fragments, respectively, with up
to 76% and 82% identity to plant CYP75 cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Putative function was assigned on the basis of
sequence homology, expression profiling and its correlation with metabolite accumulation at ten different ripening stages. At
the onset of colour transition, transcriptional induction of VvF3'H and VvF3'5'H was temporally coordinated with the beginning
of anthocyanin biosynthesis, the expression being 2-fold and 50-fold higher, respectively, in red berries versus green berries.
The peak of VvF3'5'H expression was observed two weeks later concomitantly with the increase of the ratio of delphinidin-/
cyanidin-derivatives. The analysis of structural genomics revealed that two copies of VvF3'H are physically linked on linkage group
no. 17 and several copies of VvF3'5'H are tightly clustered and embedded into a segmental duplication on linkage group no. 6,
unveiling a high complexity when compared to other plant flavonoid hydroxylase genes known so far, mostly in ornamentals.
Conclusion: We have shown that genes encoding flavonoid 3'- and 3',5'-hydroxylases are expressed in any tissues of the grape
plant that accumulate flavonoids and, particularly, in skin of ripening red berries that synthesise mostly anthocyanins. The
correlation between transcript profiles and the kinetics of accumulation of red/cyanidin- and blue/delphinidin-based anthocyanins
indicated that VvF3'H and VvF3'5'H expression is consistent with the chromatic evolution of ripening bunches. Local physical
maps constructed around the VvF3'H and VvF3'5'H loci should help facilitate the identification of the regulatory elements of each
isoform and the future manipulation of grapevine and wine colour through agronomical, environmental and biotechnological
tools.

Background
Vacuolar accumulation of anthocyanins in berry skin is
responsible for the pigmentation of red/blue grapevine
(Vitis vinifera) cultivars. Anthocyanin biosynthesis is
developmentally triggered at the onset of berry ripening
(8–10 weeks after blooming) and lasts till harvest [1].
Expression profiling of structural genes and transcription
factors has claimed a major role for the gene UFGT encoding a UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase and
its regulatory Myb-type gene VvMybA in conveying the flux
of flavonoid intermediates towards the synthesis of
anthocyanins [2,3]. The enzyme UFGT is synthesised
since véraison under the control of VvMybA and catalyses
the 3'-glycosidation of cyanidin- and delphinidin-based
anthocyanidins [4]. The resulting stably coloured
anthocyanins may undergo methylation upon the activity
of methyl-transferases that convert cyanidin into peonidin and delphinidin into petunidin or malvidin, similarly
to how it occurs in other anthocyanin-producing species
[5,6].
Cyanidin- and delphinidin-derived anthocyanins diverge
from each other regarding the number of the substituted
groups that are found on the B-ring of the flavonoid skeleton (either two or three, respectively) and have their

chromatic properties affected accordingly. Cyanidinbased anthocyanins exhibit a reddish colour whereas delphinidin-based anthocyanins are purple to blue. They
jointly determine the tonality of red berry grape varieties
and their corresponding wines. The relative proportion of
the five anthocyanins is largely under genetic control and
unique to each cultivar [7,8]. Sunlight exposition and
water deficit have been shown to modulate to some extent
the anthocyanin profile [9,10].
In plant species, the biosynthesis of cyanidin- and delphinidin-type precursors is driven, upstream of the enzyme
UFGT, by the activity of two flavonoid 3'- and 3',5'hydroxylases (F3'H and F3',5'H) that add either a single
hydroxyl group at the 3' position or two hydroxyl groups
at the 3' and 5' positions to dihydrokaempferol and/or
dihydroquercetin. Once converted into 3'-dihydroquercetin or 3',5'-dihydromyricetin, these intermediates flow
through common downstream enzymes to form di-substituted and tri-substituted anthocyanins when the gene
UFGT is expressed and to form other polyphenols (flavonols, leucoanthocyanins, catechins, proanthocyanins,
tannins) at different developmental stages. F3'H and
F3',5'H genes code for CYP75 cytochrome P450 hydroxylases that have been well characterised in the ornamental

Dianthus caryophyllus [13], Gentiana triflora [14], Ipomoea
purpurea, [15], Petunia hybrida [16], Phalaenopsis [17] and
Vinca major [18]. In all these species, F3'H and F3',5'H are
found as low/medium copy number genes and have been
genetically manipulated to produce novel flower pigmentation. In grapevine, only tentative consensus (TC)
sequences for F3'H and F3',5'H genes are available in the
TIGR grape gene database http://www.tigr.org. TCs were
built based on partially overlapping ESTs from cDNA
libraries obtained from different genotypes and tissues.
This makes it unfeasible to predict or rule out the presence
of different isogenes.

Isolation of flavonoid 3'- and 3',5'-hydroxylase genes in
grapevine
Gene isolation was accomplished via sequence homology
with the help of newly designed degenerate primers. PCR
bands that were amplified from genomic DNA of Vitis vinifera 'Cabernet Sauvignon' were longer than predicted on
the basis of plant flavonoid hydroxylase transcripts (Table
1 and 2).

VvF3'H-2 [GenBank:DQ298196-DQ298200]. Once the
primer sites had been removed, the sequences VvF3'H-1a
to -1d were 1,034 bp long with a 95 bp intron; VvF3'H-2
was 1,011 bp long with a 95 bp intron. Sizing of genomic
amplicons performed by capillary electrophoresis confirmed that the two classes of amplicons diverge from
each other for a 23-bp indel. Sequence identity was
between 99.8 and 99.9% (99.7–99.8% for the coding
region) among the sequences VvF3'H-1. The presence of
mutations introduced by Taq polymerase during the PCR
process and immortalised through the cloning of single
PCR-amplified molecules could not be ruled out as the
origin of differences among the four VvF3'H-1 sequences.
The sequences VvF3'H-1a to -1d translated into protein
fragments of 313 amino acids with 311 positions conserved among the sequences when pair-wise comparisons
were performed (Figure 1). VvF3'H-2 contained a frame
shift mutation due to a 23-bp deletion in the coding
region. Function was putatively assigned to VvF3'H-1
based on its highest identity match in GenBank at the protein level (76% identity, E = 8e-134) that corresponded to
a flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase of Petunia × hybrida [GenBank:AAD56282]. The nucleotide coding sequence of
VvF3'H-1 matched the grapevine tentative consensus
sequence TC42042 that has been predicted from three
partially overlapping ESTs sequenced in 'Cabernet Sauvignon' and 'Chardonnay' (TIGR grape gene index). The
VvF3'H-1 protein fragments spanned the 1–245 amino
acid region of TC42042 and extended it on the 5' end of
the gene by 67 amino acids. Amino acid sequence identity
between the four VvF3'H-1 protein fragments and
TC42042 was 95–96%.

Five different sequences were isolated with the F3'H
degenerate primers following SSCP analysis and were
given the designation VvF3'H-1a, -1b, -1c, -1d, and

The degenerate primers targeting F3'5'H yielded five
sequences that were given the designation VvF3'5'H-1a, 1b, -1c, VvF3'5'H-2a, -2b [GenBank:DQ298201-

This paper reports (1) the isolation of flavonoid 3'- and
3',5'-hydroxylase gene members in grapevine via sequence
homology, (2) the assessment of their chromosomal location by genetic and physical mapping, (3) their transcript
profiles in different tissues, (4) the time-course of expression in berry skin of the red cultivar 'Merlot' from prevéraison to harvest compared to the curves of accumulation of anthocyanins, catechins and total polyphenols.

Grapevine flavonoid hydroxylase gene fragments isolated from 'Cabernet Sauvignon' genomic DNA. The position of the conserved sites among plant flavonoid hydroxylases, on which the degenerate primers were designed, and the
region of the gene fragments sequenced in grapevine are referenced to the gene Ht1 of Petunia × hybrida [GenBank:AF155332]
for the flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (a) and to the Petunia × hybrida GenBank:Z22544 for the flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (b) [41].
The consensus amino acid sequences of grapevine VvF3'H and VvF3'5'H gene fragments are shown along with the position of

DQ298205]. Once the degenerate primer sites had been
removed, the sequences VvF3'5'H-1a, -1b and -1c were
1,120 bp long with a 403 bp intron; VvF3'5'H-2a and
VvF3'5'H-2b were 1,122 bp long with a 405 bp intron. The
translated coding region matched several plant F3'5'H
genes in GenBank. VvF3'5'H-1a, -1b and -1c shared the
highest identity score at the amino acid level with the
accession AAP31058 of Gossypium hirsutum (81%, E = e111) as well as VvF3'5'H-2a and -2b did with the accession
AAM51564 of Glycine max (82%, E = e-112). Translated
sequences of VvF3'5'H-1a and VvF3'5'H-1b diverged from
each other for two out of 239 amino acids. The same
occurred between the sequences VvF3'5'H-2a and
VvF3'5'H-2b (Figure 1). The sequences VvF3'5'H-1a and
VvF3'5'H-1b had 93–94% identity at the amino acid level
with VvF3'5'H-2a and VvF3'5'H-2b. All sequences

matched the tentative consensus TC45860 obtained from
19 ESTs at the TIGR grape gene index. The 'Cabernet Sauvignon' gene fragments identified in this work spanned
the 187–424 amino acid region of TC45860 over a predicted ORF of 508 amino acids. The sequences VvF3'5'H1a and VvF3'5'H-1b had 97% and 98% amino acid identity, respectively, with TC45860; VvF3'5'H-2a and
VvF3'5'H-2b peptide sequences had 95% identity with
TC45860. The VvF3'5'H gene fragments partially overlapped also with a EST (ID CTG1028815) of a 'Cabernet
Sauvignon' berry cDNA library already analysed by MPSS
http://mpss.udel.edu/grape. In order to predict how many
functional copies of the gene VvF3'5'H are present in the
grape genome we looked at the number of different ESTs
available at the grape gene databases. Twelve EST singletons held at the TIGR and the EST CTG1028815 spanned

the 5' end of the VvF3'5'H gene fragments whilst four ESTs
were alignable to the 3' end. All 17 ESTs, irrespective of
their tissue-specific localisation and the source genotype,
were aligned with the 'Cabernet Sauvignon' genomic
sequences VvF3'5'H-1a, -1b, -2a, -2b (Figure 2). Six ESTs
clustered with the 'Cabernet Sauvignon' VvF3'5'H-1a and
VvF3'5'H-1b gene fragments. Those ESTs were detected in
leaves of the white variety 'Chardonnay' and in petioles
and berries of the red variety 'Cabernet Sauvignon'. Eleven
ESTs grouped together with the 'Cabernet Sauvignon'
VvF3'5'H-2a and VvF3'5'H-2b genomic sequences. The latter ESTs were present in various tissues (leaves and berries) of red ('Cabernet Sauvignon' and 'Syrah') and white
('Chardonnay') cultivars. Two major groups of F3'5'H
transcripts including either VvF3'5'H-1 or VvF3'5'H-2 can
be detected in different tissues of both red and white
grapevines, suggesting that at least two genes encoding
CYP75A cyt P450 hydroxylases are expressed in flavonoidsynthesizing tissues. Due to the putative presence of SNPs
in ESTs from different cultivars, it was not possible to
ascertain the number of functional copies belonging to
each group, but together with the number of highly similar sequences obtained from 'Cabernet Sauvignon'
genomic DNA, this pointed to the presence of multiple
gene members coding for different isoforms of flavonoid
hydroxylases in the grape genome.

In order to test the phylogenetic relationship between
grapevine hydroxylases and the multi-functional family of
plant monooxygenases, a Neighbor-Joining tree was constructed using translated sequences of VvF3'H, VvF3'5'H1, VvF3'5'H-2 and 670 protein entries of plant cyt P450
monooxygenases (Figure 3). VvF3'H and VvF3'5'H
grouped solely with P450 proteins specifically annotated
as flavonoid hydroxylases belonging to the family-specific
branch of CYP75 monooxygenases. VvF3'H and VvF3'5'H
split into two terminal branches, each one hosting either
CYP75B or CYP75A monooxygenases. Although most
plant P450s are of polyphyletic origin and some P450
families are lineage-specific [19], CYP75 P450s are
ancient genes that existed even before the separation
between gymnosperms and flowering plants [20]. The
ancient origin of CYP75 monooxygenases is also supported by the finding that intron position of VvF3'H and
VvF3'5'H was conserved when compared to other plant
genes coding for flavonoid hydroxylases such as the Arabidopsis gene TT7 [21].
Genetic mapping
Genetic loci harbouring genes that code for flavonoid
hydroxylases were mapped using the single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of F3'H and
F3'5'H sequences in an F1 pseudo-testcross mapping population originated from the cross 'Cabernet Sauvignon'

The CYP75 clan of plant cyt P450s. The branch containing the CYP75 family is focused on a Neighbor-Joining tree constructed using 670 plant cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Flavonoid 3'-hydroxylases VvF3'H-1a to -1d and flavonoid 3',5'hydroxylases VvF3'5'H-1a to -2b that were identified in grapevine are in bold. They split into two lower hierarchical branches
that identified the CYP75B (flavonoid 3'-hydroxylases) and CYP75A (flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylases) sub-families, respectively.

Vitis 'breeding line 20/3'. The two genes segregated independently and were mapped to linkage groups LG17 and
LG6, respectively (Figure 4). The linkage groups were
annotated according to [22] and included also reference
microsatellite markers and SSCP markers generated from
BAC end-sequences (BES) of a 'Cabernet Sauvignon' BAC
library. The locus containing the gene that codes for flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase was identified by linkage analysis following the segregation of the SSCP of two co-segregating
bands amplified from the parent 'Cabernet Sauvignon' by
means of the primer pair F3int (Table 2). The VvF3'H
locus mapped to the middle of LG17 and co-segregated
with the BES marker 5A23-FM and the microsatellite
marker VMC9g4. The locus containing the genes that code
for flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase was mapped by means of
a polymorphic SSCP band amplified from the parent
'Cabernet Sauvignon' using the primer pair F35-1int. This
marker mapped to the middle of LG6 and co-segregated
with microsatellite marker VrZag30 and BES markers
9C17-FM and 17K4-FM (Figure 4). Other SSCP bands that
were co-amplified by the same primer pair F35-1int could
not be scored in the progeny due to faintness or homozy-

gosis. SSCP marker F35-2int could not be mapped in the
'Cabernet Sauvignon' parental map, but co-segregated
with VrZag30 and SSCP marker F35-1int in the male parent of the same cross (data not shown).
Physical mapping and anchoring of BAC contigs to the
genetic map
A total of 34 BAC clones containing the genes VvF3'H and
VvF3'5'H were identified by screening a set of 18,432
BACs corresponding to a 6X genome coverage [23]. The
primer pair F3, specific for grapevine flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase, detected 1.75 gene copies per haploid genome
equivalent. Two bands of 196 bp and 173 bp, corresponding to the VvF3'H-1 and the VvF3'H-2 gene fragments,
respectively, were co-amplified from all but two of the
BACs, while the 196 bp band alone was amplified from
the other two BAC clones. The genes coding for flavonoid
3',5'-hydroxylases were searched in the BAC library using
the primer pairs F35-1 and F35-2 (Table 2). The primer
pair F35-1, specific for the genes VvF3'5'H-1, identified
five BAC clones. The primer pair F35-2, specific for
VvF3'5'H-2, identified two different BAC clones. Twelve

tig upon PCR anchorage to other BAC clones using the
BES-derived primers (BES5A23-FM). The same marker
BES5A23-FM was used to anchor contig ctg253 to the

additional BAC clones were identified by both primer
pairs. The number of positive BAC clones per haploid
genome equivalent was on average 2.4 for the gene
VvF3'5'H-1 and 2.75 for the gene VvF3'5'H-2. Local physical maps around the VvF3'H and VvF3'5'H loci were constructed using all positive BAC clones identified. Those
BAC clones were used to query 2,035 BAC contigs resulting from a whole genome physical map. This map was
assembled using FPC software [24] at a 10-50 cut-off from
30,151 fingerprints of BAC clones derived from the same
library and corresponding to an approximate coverage of
10X [S. Paillard, unpublished data].
Two flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase genes, VvF3'H-1 and
VvF3'H-2, were tightly linked in contig ctg253 that consisted of 28 BAC clones and approximately covered 700
kb (Figure 5). Six BAC clones contained both isogenes,
whilst two BAC clones (6A08 and 5A23) contained only
VvF3'H-1. BAC clone 5A23 was initially not included in
the ctg253 following computational contig assembly
because it did not meet the cut-off due to a low number of
fingerprint bands. However, it was later placed in the con-

Flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase genes were present in four
contigs (ctg313, ctg871, ctg1320, and ctg2373) that covered approximately 450, 600, 280 and 140 kb, respectively. Each one of the contigs ctg313, ctg1320 and
ctg2373 contained both VvF3'5'H-1 and VvF3'5'H-2 gene
fragments. Contig ctg871 contained only the VvF3'5'H-2
gene fragment. Contigs ctg313, ctg871, ctg1320 and
ctg2373 included 26, 29, 10 and 3 BAC clones, respectively, of which 14, 10, 10 and 3, respectively, contained
either one or both isoforms of flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylases as shown in Figure 6. VvF3'5'H-1 and VvF3'5'H-2
fragments were amplified from each individual positive
BAC clone of contigs ctg313, ctg871, ctg1320 and ctg2373
using the primers pairs F35-1int and F35-2int, respectively, and analyzed by the SSCP technique.
Based on BAC order and the number of SSCP haplotypes,
at a first approximation we hypothesize the occurrence of
four loci containing VvF3'5'H-1-type sequences and seven
loci containing VvF3'5'H-2-type sequences over the four
contigs (Figure 6). Two paralogous copies of gene
VvF3'5'H-1 were identified in ctg313. The first paralog had
two allelic variants, that could be detected by SSCP analysis, one present in three BAC clones 6H20, 9C17, 31P20
(corresponding to the SSCP band genetically mapped
from 'Cabernet Sauvignon') and the other in the remaining five clones (data not shown). Two BAC clones (28B15
and 99I17) spanned the region that included both paralogs. A third potential paralogous copy of the gene
VvF3'5'H-1 was identified in contig ctg1320 whose BAC
clones contained one of the two SSCP haplotypes present
in the BACs from contig ctg313. An additional different
haplotype of the gene VvF3'5'H-1 was identified in contig
ctg2373 that included just three BAC clones. We could
detect a potential of seven paralogous copies of the gene
VvF3'5'H-2 in contigs ctg313, ctg871, ctg1320 and
ctg2373. The primers pair F35-2int identified three types
of gene fragments distinguishable by size, hereafter
referred to as short, medium and long (Figure 6). All three
gene fragments were found in ctg1320 in the close vicinity
of the gene copy of VvF3'5'H-1. Three BAC clones contained all three forms at the same time, confirming the
paralogous nature of these VvF3'5'H-2 gene copies. The
medium sized gene fragment VvF3'5'H-2 was also amplified in ctg313 and ctg2373 where it showed a SSCP haplotype different from that found in ctg1320 (data not
shown). A different locus carrying the longer fragment of

using SSR markers present in the BAC clones and single
strand conformational polymorphism of the BAC-end

SSR markers VrZag30, VMC3a8 and VMC3f12, respectively. The region spanned 3.0 cM and the median
VMC3a8 marker was settled 0.6 cM and 2.4 cM away from
VrZag30 and VMC3f12, respectively (Figure 7).
The BES of positive BAC clones provided new markers
that were closely linked to the flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase
gene copies and served to characterize that region more
precisely. The marker BES9C17-FM was located on the
physical map downstream of SSR VrZag30 and identified
only BAC clones belonging to the contig ctg313.
BES38C24-RM matched uniquely the BAC clones 38C24
and 21H16 belonging to ctg1320. Conversely, BES40A22FM and BES38C24-FM primers were designed on BES
belonging to ctg313 and ctg1320, respectively, but crossidentify BAC clones assembled in both contigs. SSCP

analysis of BES40A22-FM and BES38C24-FM fragments
revealed that for each marker two haplotypes are present
in ctg313 and two different haplotypes are present in
ctg1320. Yet, marker BES17K04-FM matched BACs 6H20,
9C17 and 31P20 of ctg313 and BACs 29J23, 38C24,
4K10, 30K14 of ctg1320. SSCP analysis identified four different haplotypes at the regions amplified by BES17K04FM primers: two haplotypes were detected in the BAC
clones of ctg1320, one more different haplotype was
present in ctg313, and yet another SSCP haplotype was
found in both BAC17K04 and BAC24N06 belonging to
ctg2373. The occurrence of more than two haplotypes of
the flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase gene fragments and of the
BES markers in a diploid genotype confirmed the presence
of paralogous copies of the flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase
genes and rule out the possibility that the individual contigs represent allelic regions that have not been properly

assembled. A segmental duplication spanning the markers F35-1int, F35-2int, BES40A22-FM, BES17K04-FM and
BES38C24-FM that occurred within 2.2-3.0 cM on LG6
could explain the physical organization of flavonoid 3',5'hydroxylase isogenes as it has been outlined in Figure 7.
The contig ctg2373 that comprised only three BAC clones
could not be unambiguously positioned in relation to the
other contigs. BES markers from the other contigs did not
match any BAC clones of ctg2373 but marker BES17K04FM matched both ctg313 and ctg1320. Marker BES17K04FM is therefore located within the segmental duplication.
It remains uncertain whether ctg2373 partially overlaps
the region of ctg313 and split from it due to high heterozygosity or if it actually covers an adjacent locus. Under
the assumption of BAC alignment between BAC clones
9C17 and 17K04 that is supported by genetic co-segregation of the corresponding BES and by co-amplification by
marker BES17K04-FM, ctg2373 would carry the haplotype
allelic to BACs 6H20, 9C17, 31P20 at the BES17K04-FM
SSCP marker and the VvF3'5'H-1 gene fragment present in
BAC17K04 would miss a counterpart on the homologous
chromosome. Otherwise, ctg2373 would identify a forth
different locus of VvF3'5'H-1, located in the surrounding
region and under-represented among the BAC clones of
the library.
Based on the data available to us, we propose that the
chromosomal region spanning the VvF3'5H gene cluster
includes four copies of VvF3'5'H-1 and five to seven copies of VvF3'5'H-2, all sharing a high sequence similarity.
We were able to present a preliminary physical map of this
cluster of genes by a combination of computational
assembly of fingerprinted BACs and by PCR-based alignment of BAC clones. The region has likely originated from
both tandem duplications that generated nearby gene
copies (i.e. paralogs within BACs 28B15 and 99I17 in the
ctg313) and from segmental intrachromosomal duplications involving a larger block of DNA (i.e. blocks of paralogs duplicated into ctg313 and ctg1320). Segmental
duplications are an important source of gene evolution
[25] and they have been estimated to cover 1.7–2.0% of
the mouse genome [26] and 4% of the human genome
[27]. In the rat genome, duplicated genes are largely confined into <1 Mb intrachromosomal duplications rather
than widely interspersed through the genome [28]. A similar model of genome dynamics could also have shaped
plant genomes as it is emerging for model species [29].
Expression analysis of VvF3'H and VvF3'5'H along with
major structural genes of the flavonoid pathway in
different grape tissues
The genes encoding both flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase and
flavonoid 3'-5'-hydroxylases are widely expressed in
grapevine organs (Figure 8). Transcripts of gene VvF3'H-1
were detected in all tissues tested. VvF3'H-1 was strongly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/12

expressed in green apical leaflets and flowers but it was
only slightly detectable in fully expanded leaves. It was
also present in all berry tissues. The other sequence
VvF3'H-2, which translated into a truncated flavonoid 3'hydroxylase due to a 23-bp frameshift deletion, was
apparently not expressed and is likely to be a pseudogene.
Transcripts of VvF3'5'H-1 were present in all tissues. High
levels of expression were detected in pigmented apical
leaflets, flowers, seeds and berries but not in green fully
expanded leaves and roots. Differential expression could
be detected between green berry skin and red berry skin,
the expression being higher in pigmented berry skin. The
expression pattern of VvF3'5'H-1 mimicked the expression profile of Chs2, Chs3 and the gene coding for flavanone hydroxylase (F3H). The gene VvF3'5'H-2
expressed transcripts of different size that could be distinguished on agarose gel (VvF3'5'H-2-short, VvF3'5'H-2medium and VvF3'5'H-2-long). The two shorter bands
were invariantly present in all tissues, even though at a different level of expression. The longest band was strongly
expressed only in red berry skin, whilst it was slightly
detectable in seeds and not detectable at all in other tissues.
The expression of most flavonoid genes, including those
coding for flavonoid hydroxylases, was more intensively
activated in flowers and seeds than in other organs. Seeds
expressed all isoforms of the flavonoid hydroxylase genes
identified in this work, whilst all but VvF3'5'H-2-long
were expressed in flowers. Among berry tissues, flesh
poorly expressed the genes of the flavonoid pathway,
except for BAN, VvF3'H-1, VvF3'5'H-1, VvF3'5'H-2-short
and VvF3'5'H-2-medium. In the epicarp of berries collected at different developmental stages, Fls1 and BAN
were more expressed at the pre-véraison stage; Chs3, F3H
and VvF3'5'H-1 were induced in red skin compared to
green skin; UFGT, VvF3'H-1 and VvF3'5'H-2-long were
strongly expressed in red skin but were undetectable in
green skin.
The flavonoid pathway does not exclusively lead to the
synthesis of anthocyanins and several flavonoid hydroxylase isogenes were therefore expressed also in non-pigmented tissues. Berry flesh and seeds accumulate nonanthocyanin flavonoids such as proanthocyanidins and
catechins. Their synthesis is catalysed downstream of the
flavonoid hydroxylases by the genes DFR, LDOX and
BAN. Gene BAN was strongly expressed in seeds, berry
flesh and berry skin at pre-véraison, whilst was almost
undetectable in post-véraison berry skin at the stage when
the rate of accumulation of proanthocyanins and catechins is declining (Figure 9). Sunlight exposed tissues
expressed the gene coding for flavonol synthase (Fls1).

expression decreased 8–10 weeks after blooming, at the
ripening stage when most genes committed to the flavonoid pathway have been reported to level off [1]. VvF3'H1 transcripts increased soon after, at the onset of véraison
(August 12th), which were at that point in time 2-fold
higher in red berries than in green berries collected from
the same bunch. VvF3'H-1 expression lasted till harvest,
with a secondary peak of expression one week before harvest, concurrently at the peak of anthocyanin content.
The gene VvF3'5'H-1 was weakly expressed during the earliest ripening stages. At the onset of véraison, transcripts of
VvF3'5'H-1 were poorly detectable in green berries, while
they increased 50-fold in berries that had already turned
red within the same bunch. The peak of VvF3'5'H-1
expression corresponded to August 24th, at the stage when
all berries had turned red. As described for VvF3'H-1, a
weaker peak of expression was found one week before
harvest. Expression of VvF3'5'H-2 was checked by semiquantitative PCR because the different isoforms of this
gene were distinguishable by size (Figure 10). Transcripts
of the isoforms VvF3'5'H-2-long and VvF3'5'H-2-medium
did appear at the onset of véraison and lasted till full ripening, whilst the isogene VvF3'5'H-2-short was constitutively expressed throughout the ripening.

Accumulation, composition of anthocyanins and colour
evolution in berry skin during the progress of ripening
Biometric and analytical parameters have been used to
follow the progress of ripening (Figure 9). The onset of
ripening began on August 3rd when sugars started to accumulate and acidity commenced to decline. The onset of
véraison (August 12th) was considered as the time when
10% of the berries had turned red (H° = 102.98, C* =
18.27). Bunches went through this phase of colour transition until August 24th when all berries had turned red (H°
= 20.46, C* = 7.43). Anthocyanins have been detected by
HPLC analysis since the onset of véraison on August 12th
(0.4 mg g-1). The accumulation of anthocyanins lasted
until September 20th, one week before harvest (19.8 mg g1), slightly decreasing at harvest (17.1 mg g-1).

At the earliest stage of the véraison, cyanidin-based
anthocyanins (cyanidin and peonidin) were roughly as
abundant as delphinidin-based anthocyanins (delphinidin, malvidin and petunidin) (42% versus 58%). Then,
on August 24th the percentage of delphinidin-based
anthocyanin (79%) peaked simultaneously with the highest level of expression of VvF3'5'H-1. The fraction of trisubstituted anthocyanins slightly decreased in the following weeks (77–78%), then remaining substantially
unchanged until harvest (75%). Berry skin colour moderately varied from H° = 331.55, C* = 3.83 to H° = 306, C*
= 2.59 from September 2nd to September 28th. Anthocyanin composition in berry skin changed over the period of

Expression of VvF3'5'H-2 during the progress of ripening. Length polymorphic transcripts of VvF3'5'H-2 were
detected semi-quantitatively after cDNA samples had been
normalised upon actin gene expression, at the sampling dates
reported in Fig 9. The short, medium and long transcripts

genomic DNA. At sampling 5, green berries (5g) were kept

véraison, from the onset of colour transition till wholebunch pigmentation, but remained roughly unmodified
throughout the last four weeks of ripening. Although the
anthocyanin profile of 'Merlot' was largely composed by
malvidin and tri-substituted anthocyanins at harvest,
derivatives of cyanidin were more promptly synthesised at
the very early stage of véraison. The pattern of expression
of VvF3'H-1, VvF3'5'H-1 and VvF3'5'H-2 is thus compatible with the hypothesis that they are strongly involved in
the synthesis of the different types of anthocyanins and
they affect anthocyanin composition in berry skin.

Conclusion
We have shown that genes coding for flavonoid 3'- and
3',5'-hydroxylases are present as low/medium copy members in the grapevine genome and are organised in complex gene clusters that most likely resulted from gene
duplication and intra-chromosomal segmental duplication. These genes are expressed in coordination with other
genes of the flavonoid pathway in any tissues of the grape
plant that are known to accumulate flavonoids, such as
leaves, flowers, roots, seeds and, particularly, in skin of
ripening berries. RT-PCR showed a strong relationship
between the expression of VvF3'H-1 and VvF3'5'H and the
kinetics of accumulation of cyanidin- and delphinidinbased anthocyanins in the red-skinned variety 'Merlot'.
The presence of multiple putative 3',5'-hydroxylase isogenes which emerged from fine structural analysis at physical level, has first been shown for plant hydroxylases. This
complexity was not unexpected for species like grape
which synthesize large amounts of different classes of
polyphenols and display a continuous variation of berry
skin colour from brick red to dark blue among the so
called red-skinned cultivars.

Plant material
Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves [30].
'Cabernet Sauvignon' was used for cloning flavonoid 3'and 3',5'-hydroxylase genes. Forty six full-sibs of the cross
'Cabernet Sauvignon' × Vitis 'breeding line 20/3' were
used for genetic mapping. Gene expression was analysed
in the red variety 'Merlot'. Apical leaflets of 1 cm2 surface
area, fully expanded leaves (>10 cm2) and adventitious
rootlets were collected from canes grown in hydroponic
culture for two months. Flower buttons were collected
one week before blooming, seeds and flesh were extracted
from berries collected two weeks after véraison. Transcript
and metabolite profiling in berry skin was performed on
samples of 40 berries collected at ten ripening stages from
pre-véraison (July 15th, 2004) till harvest (September 28th,
2004) from plots of twelve vines replicated four times.
Cloning of flavonoid 3'- and 3',5'-hydroxylase genes with
the help of degenerate primers
Degenerate primers were designed on two specific and
conserved regions of plant F3'H and F3',5'H genes (Table
1, Figure 1). PCRs were performed in a 40 µl volume containing 200 µM of each dNTP, 2.5 µM of each primer, 1 U
of HotMaster Taq polymerase (Eppendorf) with 2.5 mM
MgCl2 buffer, and 40 ng of template DNA. The denaturation step was 95°C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of
92°C for 45 s, 60°C for F3'H primers and 56°C for
F3',5'H primers for 50 s, 65°C for 90 s. Amplified bands
were extracted from agarose gel with Nucleospin Extract
(Macherey-Nagel) and cloned into pGEM-T vector
(Promega). Unique clones were identified by means of
PCR with M13 universal primers and SSCP-fingerprinting
of the insert. Selected clones were sequenced with BigDye
terminator chemistry and a MegaBace500 sequencer
(Amersham Biosciences).
Sequence analysis
Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared
with GenBank accessions, with EST singletons and tentative consensus sequences (TCs) held at the TIGR grape
gene index. Conceptual translation was obtained with
DNAclub software. Amino acid entries of 670 plant cytochrome P450 monooxygenases were downloaded from
GenBank as of November 30th, 2004. Cluster analysis of
plant cyt P450s and the candidate grape flavonoid
hydroxylases was done with the Neighbor-joining
method.
Genetic mapping
Nested primers were designed to amplify an exon of
grapevine flavonoid 3'- and 3',5'-hydroxylase genes (F3,
F3-1, F35-1, F35-2, see Table 1 and 2). Additional primer
pairs (F3int, F35-1int and F35-2int) were designed in the
exon sequences flanking an intron for detecting SNPs use-

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:12

ful for mapping in untranslated regions (Table 1 and 2).
Flavonoid hydroxylase gene fragments containing the
intron were amplified in a 10 µl volume containing 200
µM of dNTPs, 0.4 µM of each primer, 0.5 U of Taq
polymerase, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 20 ng of template DNA.
The PCR profile was 35 cycles of 92°C for 50s, annealing
temperature as reported in Table 2 for 50s, 65°C for 1
min. Gene fragments were separated on 4% glycerol and
0.5 × MDE polyacrylamide gel (BioWhittaker Molecular
Applications) for SSCP analysis, run at room temperature
for 16 hours at 6 W and stained with silver nitrate. The segregation of F3int, F35-1int, F35-2int and 335 SSR markers
was followed in the 'Cabernet Sauvignon' × Vitis 'breeding
line 20/3' full-sib family [G. Di Gaspero, unpublished
data]. Linkage groups of markers segregating from the
'Cabernet Sauvignon' parent were identified using
Carthagene with a LOD of 5.0 [31]. Marker order was calculated using the command Build 3.
Local physical maps
A 6X BAC library of 'Cabernet Sauvignon' was screened by
PCR with the F3, F35-1 and F35-2 primer pairs (Table 2)
using a 3D pooling strategy [23]. Then, positive individual
clones were pre-cultured in 2X LB medium for 20 hours
and 2 µL of cell suspension were inoculated into the same
medium and grown for 16 hours. Cultured clones were
directly used as PCR template. Positive BACs were confirmed using the corresponding F3int, F35-1int and F352int primer pairs (Table 2). PCR products were then run
into a SSCP gel (as above) for identifying the haplotype of
each BAC clone. A set of 30,151 BAC fingerprints of the
'Cabernet Sauvignon' BAC clones [S. Paillard, unpublished data] were assembled into contigs using FPC v8.0
[24]. The first assembly was made at a cut-off value of 1050 and with a tolerance of 0.4 bp. After several steps of
dQing and merging, 2,035 BAC contigs were obtained [S.
Paillard, unpublished data]. BAC clones that were positive
at the PCR screening were localized over the contigs.
Clone order was determined by running the consensus
band (CB) algorithm on each individual positive contig.
Contig size was estimated by converting CB units into
physical length, under the assumption of a band mean
size of 1,100 bp. Positive contigs were anchored to the
genetic map by means of already mapped SSR markers
that were present in the assembled BACs [[23], AdamBlondon, unpublished data]. Further SSCP markers
(38C24-RM, 17K14-FM, 9C17-FM, 40A22-FM and 5A23FM, Table 1 and 2) were developed on the BAC-end
sequences (BES) [A.F. Adam-Blondon and S. Paillard,
unpublished data] of the positive clones and enabled new
genetic markers to be identified that were closely linked to
VvF3'H and VvF3'5'H loci (Table 1 and 2). BES-derived
markers (Table 1 and 2) were also used to cross-reference
the BAC clones within a contig, validate the clone order

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/12

and identify the BAC haplotypes in regions where allelic
BACs were incorporated into a given contig.
Transcript profiling
Total RNA was extracted from berry skin and flesh, leaves,
flower bunches, rootlets and seeds following the procedure described in [31]. Total RNA was treated with 0.5 U/
µg RQ1 DNase (Promega) in presence of an RNAse inhibitor (RNAguard, Amersham Biosciences). First strand
cDNA was synthesised using 2 µg of RNA, 0.5 µM (dT)18
primer and 50 U of M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase
(Promega). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out on
a DNA Engine Opticon2 (MJ Research) using SYBR Green
Jump Start Taq ReadyMix (Sigma). The primer pairs F3-1,
F35-1 and F35-2 (Table 2) were used for expression analysis of VvF3'H-1, VvF3'5'H-1 and VvF3'5'H-2, respectively.
Each cDNA sample was analysed at two different dilutions
and with two replicates per dilution. Gene transcripts
were quantified comparing the threshold cycle (CT) with
that of the constitutive actin gene [32]. Semi-quantitative
PCR was performed on different tissues upon cDNA normalisation based on the expression of the actin gene and
visualised on agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.
Primers pairs for the genes of the flavonoid pathway were
retrieved from the literature: primers for Chs1, Chs2, Chs3,
DFR, LDOX, UFGT were from [33], primers for Fls1 were
from [34]. Primers for F3H and BAN were newly designed
on the original gene sequences [35,36] to tag 150–200 bp
gene fragments.
Metabolite profiling during berry development
Total soluble solids were quantified with a refractometer
(Analytical control) and expressed as °Brix. Titratable
acidity was measured with an automated titrator (Crison)
and expressed as tartaric acid equivalents. Skin phenols
were extracted for 4 hours in 1/10 (w/v) skin/solvent suspension of 100% methanol and 1% HCl, then centrifuged
at 5,000 rpm for 15 min and filtered with a 0.2 µm PTFE
filter (Chemtek Analytica). Total phenols were determined following the procedure of [37]. The calibration
curve was obtained with (+)-gallic acid (Sigma). Total flavan-3-ols (catechins) were quantified as reported in [38].
The calibration curve was constructed with (+)-catechin
(Extrasynthase). Absorbance was measured by a UV/VIS
LAMBDA 2 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). Anthocyanins
for the HPLC analysis were extracted for 4 hours from 200
mg of berry skin with 2 mL of methanol, then centrifuged
and filtered with a 0.2 µm PTFE filter (Chemtek analitica).
Methanol was evaporated under nitrogen flux and
anthocyanins were re-suspended with 100–400 µL of
27:73 methanol:perchloric acid 0.3% (v/v). Anthocyanins
were separated in a high performance liquid chromatograph (Perkin Elmer Series 4) using a C18 Purospher RP18 (5 µm, 250 mm × 4 mm) column (Merck) protected by
a C18 guard column, according to the procedure reported

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:12

in [39]. Anthocyanins were detected by a LC-95 spectrophotometric detector (Perkin Elmer) operating at 520 nm.
Anthocyanin content was expressed as mg/L of malvidin
3-glucoside upon the construction of a standard curve.
The composition of monoglucoside anthocyanins was
used for calculating the ratio of tri-/di-substituted derivatives. Berry colour was measured with an X-Rite 948 Chromameter (X-Rite) and averaged over 160 berries at each
sampling date. Colorimetric specification was referenced
to the CIELab scale. Hue angle (H°) and chroma (C*)
were calculated according to [40].
