Abstract
Background: Genetic analyses are often limited by the availability of appropriate molecular
markers. Markers from neutrally evolving genomic regions may be particularly useful for inferring
evolutionary histories because they escape the constraints of natural selection. For the majority of
taxa however, obtaining such markers is challenging. Advances in genomics have the potential to
alleviate the shortage of neutral markers. Here we present a method to develop numerous markers
from putatively neutral regions of primate genomes.
Results: We began with the available whole genome sequences of human, chimpanzee and
macaque. Using computational methods, we identified a total of 280 potential amplicons from
putatively neutral, non-coding, non-repetitive regions of these genomes. Subsequently we amplified,
using experimental methods, many of these amplicons from diverse primate taxa, including a ringtailed lemur, which is distantly related to the genomic resources. Using a subset of 10 markers, we
demonstrate the utility of the developed markers in phylogenetic and evolutionary rate analyses.
Particularly, we uncovered substantial evolutionary rate variation among lineages, some of which
are previously not reported.
Conclusion: We successfully developed numerous markers from putatively neutral regions of
primate genomes using a strategy combining computational and experimental methods. Applying
these markers to phylogenetic and evolutionary rate variation analyses exemplifies the utility of
these markers. Diverse ecological and evolutionary analyses will benefit from these markers.
Importantly, methods similar to those presented here can be applied to other taxa in the near
future.

Background
The accumulating body of draft genome assemblies from
diverse animal species offers unprecedented opportunities
for resolving the tree of life. A key component of empirical

studies of molecular evolutionary phenomena is the analysis of molecular markers. To date, most molecular phylogenetic studies have relied on sequences from less than a
few dozen genes. Mitochondrial DNA sequences have

been the workhouse of phylogenetic and phylogeographic
studies for the past two decades (e.g. [1,2]). DNA barcoding, a technique is increasingly used to identify species, is
reliant on mtDNA [3]. While these methods have
strengths, each carries some implicit limitations. First,
because mtDNA markers are maternally inherited, the
ability to infer evolutionary events from the perspective of
both sexes is limited. In addition, the reduced effective
population size of mtDNA compared to that of nuclear
markers could confound population genetic inferences.
Moreover, it is now well established that mtDNA
sequences are often incorporated into nuclear genomes in
diverse taxa, including humans and other primates [4,5].
Markers from single-copy nuclear DNA are free from the
aforementioned problems. Often used single-copy
nuclear DNA markers include conserved exons and genes.
However, the effects of natural selection on these markers
can result in homoplasy that has the potential to mislead
phylogenetic analyses [6]. Similarly, genes that experienced positive selection in specific lineages (e.g., RNases
evolution in leaf monkeys, [7]) may have inaccurate phylogenetic signals (i.e., they suffer long branch attraction
due to increased number of nonsynonymous substitutions in specific lineages). Conversely, genes that have a
history of strong purifying selection may harbor few phylogenetically informative sites, which make them unsuitable for population genetic studies or phylogenetic
resolution in rapidly evolving taxa.

mates. The availability of whole-genome sequences of primates combined with their well-resolved phylogenetic
relationships makes them an excellent model system in
which to devise computational and experimental tools to
search for useful molecular markers. Moreover, such
markers from primate genomes are potentially useful
because they could be applied to the several outstanding
phylogenetic problems in primates (for example, [1215]). Such molecular markers also could serve as a
resource for understanding the genetic history of primate
populations, a topic of study of interest to molecular ecologists, primate biologists, and anthropologists.
We demonstrate the utility of these markers by applying
them to phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses. We first
constructed a sample data set of ten non-coding, nonrepetitive markers from ten diverse primate taxa, including a strepsirrhine species rather distantly related to existing genomic resources. We reconstructed the correct
species phylogeny with high confidence and uncovered
significant evolutionary rate variation between lineages.
Furthermore, we have uncovered new and statistically significant rate variation between some primate lineages.
Thus, our markers may contribute understanding the patterns and causes of neutral evolutionary rate variation
between lineages. We propose that the methods outlined
here can be used in diverse taxa to address phylogenomic
and population genetic questions.

Results
In addition to sequence based markers, events such as the
insertion of transposable elements into ancient genomes
provide excellent phylogenetic information [8]; yet these
markers provides little information on rates of nucleotide
substitution. Because of these limitations, neutrally evolving nuclear DNA sequence markers may provide the best
source of data for phylogenetic inference and estimates of
evolutionary rate variation.
Advances in genomics give molecular evolutionary studies
an extraordinary opportunity to establish numerous nuclear,
putatively neutral molecular markers. Genomes of many
taxa, including those of primates, have a large amount of
non-coding DNA, which can be used to infer genomic divergence and the influence of neutral mutation rate variation [911]. Therefore, we can obtain large numbers of putatively
nuclear molecular markers from non-coding regions. Even
though currently most taxa lack genome scale information,
sequencing technologies are rapidly improving, and it will
become progressively easier to obtain genome sequences.
The challenges then are, to utilize genomic information to
develop markers that can be used in a variety of ecological,
phylogenetic, and evolutionary applications.
Here we present a method for developing and utilizing
numerous non-coding, non-repetitive markers in pri-

Amplification of potential markers
Our preliminary screen for orthologous non-repetitive
and non-coding segments based on a three-way alignment
the genomes of two hominid apes (human, Homo sapiens;
and common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes) and the rhesus
macaque (Macaca mulatta, an Old World monkey)
resulted in nearly 10,000 candidate amplicons. Subsequently, we designed 280 (212 from autosomes and 68
from the X chromosome) primer pairs in regions ranging
from ~300 to ~1200 base pairs long, with an average
length of ~600 bps.

We then used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
amplify these markers from the following primate species:
gorilla (Gorilla gorilla, a nonhuman hominid), anubis
baboon (Papio anubis, an Old World monkey), spider
monkey (Ateles geoffroyi, a New World monkey) and tamarin (Saguinus labiatus, a New World monkey), and ringtailed lemur (Lemur catta, a prosimian). Two hundred
primer pairs (~70%) amplified a single band from G.
gorilla, 170 primer pairs (~60%) amplified a single band
for P. anubis, 116 (~41%) and 106 (~38%) primer pairs
amplified a single band for A. geoffroyi and S. labiatus
respectively. Furthermore, we amplified single bands in
18 markers (~6%), from a phylogenetically distant clade
from the genome resources, L. catta. Sequences, locations

in the human genome, and the applicable range of phylogeny of these markers (total 280 non-coding, non-repetitive markers) are listed the Additional file 1 [see
Additional file 1].
We chose 10 markers (6 autosomal and 4 X-linked) for
subsequent analyses (Table 1). These markers are likely to
be orthologous, for the following reasons. First, these ten
markers are unique genomic regions in the human
genome (i.e. they are not included in segmentally duplicated regions, nor do they have closely related paralogous
sequences in the genome, as determined by homology
searches). Second, primers for all the ten markers produced single bands in PCR reactions in the primate species we tested. Third, when we used the experimentally
amplified sequences as a query to search other genomes
using BLAT or BLAST programs, all of these produced a
single hit in the expected locations. Fourth, genetic divergences of these markers also fall within the expected
ranges of neutrally evolving orthologous markers (see
below). However, we caution that it is possible that these
markers are not orthologous, given that most primate
genomes are far from complete, and that unknown copy
number variation may exist between and within species.
Thus, whether the amplified markers of these regions
from other primate genomes truly represent orthologous
segments can only be determined by comparing finished,
high-fold coverage, whole genome sequences from multiple individuals of the primate species in our study. The
markers amplified and sequenced in this study are deposited in the GenBank (accession numbers GQ175181â
GQ175229).
We also retrieved these 10 regions from the publicly available genome sequences of the following five species:
human (H. sapiens), common chimpanzee (P. troglodytes),
orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus abelii), rhesus macaque (M.
mulatta), and the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).
All sequences, except for the X1 marker from the chimpanzee and the A5 marker from macaque, were of high
quality (meaning, â¤ 2 ambiguous sites). The chimpanzee

X1 and the macaque A5 marker had a substantial number
of ambiguous sites, suggesting that the two particular
markers may potentially include sequencing and/or
assembly errors. Therefore, we experimentally amplified
the two regions from the corresponding species and used
them in further analyses.
Subsequent analyses were all based on these 10 markers.
We used the GBlocks program [8] to remove poorly
aligned sites. The alignment information and nucleotide
content of the markers are shown in Table 2. A1 had the
longest alignment with 778 aligned sites. The GC content
of the 10 markers ranged from 30.5% in A3 to 54.3% in
A2, with an average of 38.7% for the concatenated dataset.
We tested whether base frequencies across taxa are
homogenous using a chi-square test for each of the 10
markers and found no sign of heterogeneity among taxa
(P > 0.1 for all markers, results not shown).
Genetic divergence
To estimate the genomic divergence for these newly determined markers, we calculated the pairwise Kimura twoparameter distances [16] among the 10 primate species. A
subset of pairwise divergences is shown in Table 3. All
pairwise distances for the species compared here are
shown in the Additional file 2 [see Additional file 2].

There is a substantial variation of evolutionary distances
among markers. For example, the distance between
human and chimpanzee ranges from 0.59% in A2 to
2.34% in X2. Such regional heterogeneity has been
observed before and could be caused by several different
factors, such as the difference in the proportion of sites
susceptible to mutations caused by DNA methylation
[17,18]. Nevertheless, this variation is within the range of
0%â2.91% observed in previous studies using non-repetitive and non-coding regions [9,19]. The mean humanchimpanzee divergence from these 10 segments is 1.53%
Â± 0.16%, which is close to previous estimates (1.24% Â±
0.07% [9], and 1.19% Â± 0.02% [19]). Thus, non-coding,
non-repetitive markers developed in this study exhibit

genetic divergences similar to those obtained from larger
scale analyses.
We report that the divergence between baboon and
macaque is 1.29% Â± 0.16% for the concatenated dataset
(range between 0.39% â 1.98%). This value is similar to
an earlier estimate (1.24% in [17]). Within the New
World monkeys, marmoset and tamarin are more closely
related to each other (average distance: 4.02% Â± 0.27%)
than either is to the spider monkey (Table 3). This observation is concordant with the generally accepted understanding of platyrrhine phylogeny [14].
We also estimated genetic distances between different primate groups, defined as the mean of all pairwise distances

between two groups in a inter-group comparison [20].
The average divergences between apes and Old World
monkeys, apes and New World monkeys, and Old World
monkeys and New World monkeys are 6.92% Â± 0.34%,
10.90% Â± 0.39%, and 11.80% Â± 0.47%, respectively.
Notably, genetic divergences between the spider monkey
and the other two New World monkeys (spider monkey
versus marmoset [5.85% Â± 0.35%]; spider monkey versus
tamarin [5.35% Â± 0.32%]) are comparable to the divergence between apes and Old World monkeys (Table 3).
Our data also provide a chance to examine the genetic
divergence between ring-tailed lemur and other primate
groups based upon nuclear, non-coding, non-repetitive
loci. Hominid apes, Old World monkeys and New World

monkeys are on average 22.29% Â± 0.75%, 23.66% Â±
0.89% and 23.45% Â± 0.74% divergent from the ring-tailed
lemur based on our data. Previous studies suggested
approximately 20â21% divergence between human and
the ring-tailed lemur [12,21]. Our estimate of the genetic
distance between hominids and the ring-tailed lemur is
similar to this value, and these findings also show that
Old World monkeys and New World monkeys have
diverged slightly more from lemur than have the apes.
Phylogenetic analysis
We performed phylogenetic analyses using the new markers generated in this study. We used Maximum Parsimony
(MP), Neighbor Joining (NJ), and Bayesian Inference (BI)
methods to construct phylogenetic trees for each of the 10
markers. The best-fitting substitution model for each
marker for Bayesian Inference (BI) was determined by the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) as implemented in
ModelTest3.7 [22] and MrModelTest2.3 [23] (listed in
Table 2). We also performed phylogenetic analyses using
the three methods and a maximum likelihood (ML)
method of the concatenated data set.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/247

Overall, none of these methods strongly supported conflicting topologies for any single marker. However, individual-marker analyses were less well resolved than the
tree based on the concatenated data (compare Figure 1
with Figure 2). Figure 2 represents the total evidence tree
obtained from MP, NJ, ML, and BI of the concatenated
dataset. All the methods recovered identical topology with
100% bootstrap value or 1.0 Bayesian posterior probability support for all clades, except for node 1 (Figure 2). This
tree agrees with the current understanding of the primate
species tree in most aspect.
The behavior of combining characters from different partitions was evaluated by examining the relative contribution, or utility, of data partitions to resolving relationships
of the combined data set. Specifically, partitioned Bremer
support (PBS) was calculated using TreeRot3 [24] using
the method of Baker and DeSalle [25] to measure the relative contribution of each marker to node support. The
larger the partitioned Bremer support is for a given partition at a particular node, the greater the relative contribution of that partition to the support of that node. The sum
of all partition lengths for any given node will always

The tree is derived from the analyses of the concatenated dataset (5592 bp) based on maximum parsimony (MP), neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum likelihood (using Garli [ML1] and PHYML [ML2]), and Bayesian inference (BI). All the nodes (except node 1, which indicated otherwise) received 100% bootstrap proportion and 1.0 Bayesian

The results of the PBS analysis are presented in Table 4.
The PBS values for 7 nodes across all the 10 markers and

shows the lowest degree of support (16.5). For comparison, we also summarized the relative contribution of the

Relative rate variation in primates
To determine whether the rates of nucleotide substitutions for these 10 non-coding fragments varied between
lineages on the phylogenetic tree, we performed relative
rate tests. For example, to examine rate difference between
apes and Old World monkeys, we used marmoset (a New
World monkey) or the ring-tailed lemur (a strepsirrhine)
as the outgroup (Table 5).

Pairs of lineages that exhibit significant rate differences are
presented in Table 5. We observe that the Old World monkey lineage (as a group) is evolving significantly faster

than the ape lineage. The lengths of Old World monkeyspecific branch are 30â50% longer than the ape-specific
branch since their divergence, depending upon the choice
of the outgroup (marmoset and lemur, respectively). This
finding is in accord with the repeatedly observed 'hominoid/hominid-rate slowdown' phenomenon [17,19,2629].

on the fact that the degree of rate difference between specific primate groups can differ depending upon the actual
lineages compared. For example, the hominid rate slowdown is more pronounced when rates are compared
between human and macaque than between human and
baboon (Table 5), which is in accord with the rate difference between macaque and baboon.

Interestingly, we found that the macaque lineage is evolving significantly faster than the baboon lineage since the
divergence of the two Old World monkey lineages. In the
ten markers studied here (Table 5) the macaque lineage
has accumulated almost twice as many nucleotide substitutions as has the baboon lineage. Indeed, analyses of
ENCODE data have shown that the branch length leading
to macaque is significantly longer than that leading to
baboon [30]. Another recent study using over 8 million
base pairs of aligned genomic sequences among several
Old World monkeys also indicated significant rate difference between rhesus macaque and baboon [31]. Overall,
New World monkeys evolve at a faster rate than the hominids (Table 5). We also discovered significant rate variation among New World monkeys. In particular, marmoset
has a significantly faster substitution rate (p = 0.015) than
the spider monkey (Table 5).

Discussion
Genomics is arguably one of the fastest evolving branches
of modern science. Emerging new sequencing technologies enable analyses of large number of individuals from
a species or to interrogate genetic diversity of a complex
biological community. Yet, aside from the fields of microbial genomics and human population genomics, for most
taxa on earth only a sparse amount of genomic resources
are available.
Developing genome-scale markers from the majority of
the diversity of life will have high payoff, facilitating ecological and evolutionary applications. Here we have illustrated that we can develop markers from specific genomic
regions (such as non-coding, non-repetitive regions) utilizing genomic resources that are moderately divergent
from target species. For example, studies estimate that the
human/chimpanzee/macaque and the ring-tailed lemur
has shared the last common ancestor up to 80 million
years ago [32]. Here we have generated markers from
potentially neutral genomic regions in ring-tailed lemurs
using primers based upon human-chimpanzee-macaque
genome alignments.

These findings indicate that significant rate variation
between lineages is a common feature of primate genome
evolution. Based upon the known differences in life history
traits [see Additional file 3], the observed rate differences
are in general in agreement with the idea that species with
larger body size, and likely longer generation time, tend to
have slower molecular clocks. Baboons are larger and have
longer lifespans than macaques, and spider monkey are
larger and have longer lifespans than marmosets.

As far as we are aware, data from non-coding regions of
strepsirrhines are rare, and markers developed in this
study have a great potential to be used in evolutionary
studies of this group. Importantly, we demonstrated that
we could potentially achieve genome scale marker generation by sampling genomes across the tree of life with
moderate divergence times.

Taken together, these findings not only suggest a widespread influence of life history traits on molecular evolution of primates, but also provide a practical explanation

We chose Primates as the test group of organisms for this
study because their phylogenetic relationships are well
characterized [33]. We felt that if we could replicate the
known primate phylogeny using the markers we designed
then we would have proof of principle that this type of
marker was useful for phylogenetic analysis. Toward that
end this study was successful. Using a subset of new markers, we have performed phylogenetic analyses. The resulting phylogenies from single markers were generally in
accord with the accepted phylogenetic relationship
among different primate species. In particular, no marker
supported incorrect phylogeny with statistical significance. The only node that required several markers to be
resolved was the relationship among human, chimpanzee, and gorilla, a notorious phylogenetic example that
had previously been shown to require a large amount of
data to be resolved [34,35]. Given that there are several
outstanding problems remaining in the field of primate
phylogeny (e.g., [13-15,36]), putatively neutral markers
such as developed in this study potentially will be useful
toward resolving these issues.
Previous work focusing on identifying conserved, ultraconserved, or lineage specific elements for their potential
functionality (e.g. [37,38]) have recognized the usefulness
of utilizing regions located distantly from annotate genes
as putatively 'neutral' standards to generate statistical
'background' for their analysis. Our approach, while seeking to identify regions of the genome that are not under
functional constraint instead, have adopted such underlying logic and applied it to species whose genomic
sequences are not yet available. It should be cautioned
however that computational logics identifying putatively
'neutral' markers do not guarantee true neutrality: it
remains as a prime challenge in modern genomics to
experimentally establish neutrality or functionality of
non-coding regions.
It has recently been demonstrated that protein coding
regions are subject to frequent and widespread parallel
evolution [6]; therefore we attempted to choose regions
that are less likely to be subject to homoplastic effects that
could result in misleading phylogenies. That our results
support the well-known topology of Primates (e.g. [33]) is
encouraging, because our understanding of primate phylogeny has taken over a century to get to the point is at
today. There are still phylogenetic controversies (i.e. the
hominoid trichotomy, the relationships among neotropical platyrrhines, and the phylogenetic placement of tarsiers) that still resist resolution besides decades of work.
Using the newly developed markers, we also observed
substantial evolutionary rate variation among different
primate lineages. We not only confirm the phenomenon
of hominid rate slowdown [17,19,26,29], but also uncov-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/247

ered several other intriguing patterns. In particular, we
observe that since the divergence of rhesus macaque and
anubis baboon (estimated to be approximately 6â8 millions of years ago, [28,29]), the macaque lineage has accumulated almost twice as many mutations as the baboon
lineage. Substantial rate variation between Old World
monkey lineages could have contributed to earlier controversy over the degree of hominid rate slowdown. When
the macaque lineage is used to compare evolutionary rates
of hominids and Old World monkeys, the degree of rate
slowdown is much stronger (Table 5). We also observed a
strong rate difference between marmoset and spider monkey, and to a lesser degree between tamarin and spider
monkey. The marmoset lineage has accumulated almost
50% more mutations than the spider monkey lineage
since the two lineages have split (Table 5). Thus, evolutionary rate variation is a common phenomenon in putatively neutral genomic regions [18].
The relative rate test shows that mutations have accumulated in the Old World monkey and New World monkey
lineage at a rate significantly higher than in the hominids.
We found no significant evolutionary rate difference
between Old World monkeys and New World monkeys,
in contrast to an earlier finding [28]. However, we should
be careful in concluding the patterns of rate variation
between groups based upon data from a few lineages. First
there is the issue of regional rate variation within a
genome. Also, as we have witnessed above, rates can vary
dramatically between closely related lineages (such as
macaque and baboon). The earlier analysis on rate variation between marmoset and Old World monkeys [28] was
based upon a single, albeit long (~59.8 kbps), orthologous region. The New World monkey species used in the
previous analysis was marmoset, a fast evolving lineage.
Thus the previous finding of significant rate variation
between Old World monkeys and New World monkeys
[28] may reflect the underlying molecular clock specific to
that genomic regions and the sets of species. In this respect
expanding the usage of non-coding, non-repetitive markers from many different genomic regions as developed
here to other primate lineages will be highly useful to reconcile these conflicting results and to elucidate the patterns and causes of genomic neutral molecular clocks in
primates.
The markers developed in this study [see Additional file 1]
should thus be of great use for ecological and evolutionary
applications in primates. In particular a subset of markers
from closely related species can be used as 'local' markers
to elucidate recent evolutionary events, while a few markers that can be amplified throughout the evolution of primates (such as the 10 markers analyzed here) could be
used as 'global' markers to analyze underlying trends in
primate evolution.

Conclusion
Molecular markers from nuclear, putatively neutrally
evolving genomic regions are extremely useful in ecological and evolutionary applications, yet hard to obtain from
the majority of taxa. Here we describe a method for developing numerous nuclear markers from putatively neutral
regions of primate genomes. First we demonstrate that by
combining computational and experimental methods, we
can generate a large number of putatively neutral markers
from diverse primate genomes. Our PCR analyses show
that we can amplify numerous markers from several wellseparated primate lineages. We chose a subset of ten
markers among the newly developed markers and amplified them from five primate species. Notably, we were
able to amplify and sequence a subset of these markers
from a ring-tailed lemur, representing a lineage that
diverged from the lineage leading species from which the
primers were designed 80 million years ago. We show that
these ten markers can reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the ten primate species with high confidence, and useful in analyses of evolutionary rate
variation between lineages. In particular we uncovered
substantial rate variation among lineages, both within
and between different primate families. Thus, these markers can provide a snapshot of genomic divergences and are
likely to be highly useful in diverse applications.

Methods
Genome-scale mining of potential non-repetitive, noncoding amplicons
Whole genome assemblies of human (H. sapiens), common chimpanzee (P. troglodytes) and rhesus macaque (M.
mulatta) (hg18, panTro2, rheMac2, respectively) were
retrieved from the UCSC genome browser [39]. The
human-chimpanzee-macaque alignments were obtained
using blastz program [40]. Using the 'Ensembl' and
'Known' gene annotations provided by the UCSC genome
browser, we identified non-coding regions, which include
intergenic regions (defined as regions that are at least
1500 base pairs [bps] away from any known or ENSEMBL
gene) and introns. We removed first introns and short
(less than 250 bps) introns from further analyses, since
these may be under selective constraint to preserve regulatory signals. We then extracted intergenic and intronic
amplicons of length between 500 to 1500 bps, flanked by
highly conserved 30â50 bp regions to be used as primer
sites. Amplicons within 150 bps from an intronic start site
or end site were also removed. We further filtered amplicons so that at least 80% of the sites are aligned between
human-chimp-macaque and at least 85% of the aligned
sites are from non-repetitive regions.

We then selected candidate primers, by either directly
using the highly conserved flanking regions or automatically designing primers based upon the potential ampli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/247

cons sequences, using the software fastPCR [41]. After
designing primer pairs, we used either the BLAT [42] or
BLAST [43] programs to map the primer pairs and the
potential amplicons back to the human and macaque
genome, to select only those that have a single hit in both
human and macaque genome. This step removes potential spurious PCR products due to the homology to the
primer sequences. Furthermore, we used BLAST program
to map the single hit primers against the supercontig data
of marmoset genome (downloaded from Washington
University Genome Research Center). We chose primer
pairs that satisfy the following criteria only: for each
amplicon, the forward and the reverse primer should hit
the same contig in marmoset genome, and the length of
marmoset high scoring pair (HSP) should be at least 20
bps in length.
Amplifying candidate amplicons from diverse primate
genomes
To demonstrate the usefulness of the markers developed
by our computational approach, we constructed a ten-species data set for a subset of markers. This data set is comprised of experimentally gathered data from five species
combined with computationally extracted data from additional five species. First, five species across diverse group
of primates were chosen to test newly developed nonrepetitive and non-coding nuclear primer pairs. These are,
gorilla (G. gorilla, a hominid), anubis baboon (P. anubis,
an Old World monkey), black-handed spider monkey (A.
geoffroyi, a New World monkey), white-lipped tamarin (S.
labiatus, a New World monkey), and ring-tailed lemur (L.
catta, a prosimian). DNA samples used in present study
were purchased from Coriell (Camden, NJ) either as a primate phylogenetic panel (PRP00001) or individually
(e.g., PR00036: anubis baboon).

To amplify the markers, approximately 5 ng of genomic
DNA was used as the template for a 10 ul PCR mixture. We
used a "touchdown" PCR program with an initial annealing temperature at 60Â°C and temperature subsequently
decreased by 1Â°C every cycle until the specified annealing
temperature 50Â°C is reached. Each reaction was performed using the cycles of 30 sec at 94Â°C, 30 sec at 6050Â°C, and 60 sec at 72Â°C, with an initial step of 3 min at
94Â°C and a final step of 4 min at 72Â°C. Polymerase chain
reaction products were purified using ExoSAP-IT (USB,
Cleveland, USA) and then sequenced on both strands. The
PCR primers were also used as sequencing primers. We
performed gel purifications for the following three markers: A3 fragment from the baboon, A4 fragment from tamarin, and the A1 fragment from the lemur.
After sequencing, we used the BLAT program [42] to confirm that there is only one significant hit for each individual marker. These were combined with computationally

extracted data from five other primate species. Specifically, homologous regions for the corresponding amplicons were retrieved from the UCSC genome browser from
three hominids, including human (H. sapiens), chimpanzee (P. troglodytes; we amplified the X1 experimentally),
orangutan (P. pygmaeus abelii), and one Old World Monkey, rhesus macaque (M. mulatta; we amplified the A5
marker experimentally), and a New World Monkey, common marmoset (C. jacchus).
Sequence analysis
Initial sequence assembly was carried out using the
Sequencher software [44]. Full alignments were produced
with MAFFT using the L-INS-i MAFFT option [45]. All
alignments were checked by eye, adjusted where necessary. Poorly aligned regions were removed using the
Gblocks 0.91b program [46] with the setting of relaxed
selection of blocks [47]. The final concatenated sequence
alignment that was used for subsequent analyses contained 5592 aligned positions. Compositional stationarity was explored using the Chi-Square test in
PAUP*4.0b10 [48].

Phylogenetic analyses were conducted by equally
weighted maximum parsimony (MP) method, with gaps
treated as missing data using PAUP, and by neighbor-joining (NJ) method, based on Kimura 2-parameter model
using MEGA4.1Beta [20]. Maximum likelihood analyses
were performed using both Garli0.96 [49] and PHYML3
[50] programs. The mixed-model analysis was implemented in MrBayes3.1.2 [51]. The best-fitting substitution
models for the ML and Bayesian analyses were chosen by
the Akaike information criterion (AIC) implemented in
ModelTest3.7 [22] and MrModelTest2.3 [23]. Statistical
support for the resulting phylogenies was assayed by conducting 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates for MP and NJ
analyses as completed in PAUP and MEGA, and 100 bootstrap pseudo-replicates for ML analyses as completed in
Garli and PHYML. Mixed-model Bayesian analysis also
employed locus-specific models comparable to those chosen for ML analyses of individual genes. In MrBayes3.1.2,
two independent sets of MCMC chains were run, each
with three heated and one unheated chain for 2 Ã 106 generations. These were sampled every 100 generations. All
analyses employed the default flat Dirichlet priors. The
stationarity of each run was assessed by monitoring the
convergence of the standard deviation of split frequencies
and by graphing posterior probabilities of both runs
against generations. The trees and parameter values from
the pre-convergence "burn-in" phases of the runs were
excluded.

Partitioned Bremer support (PBS) using TreeRot3 [24].
Significance of evolutionary rate variation among lineages
were tested by relative rate test, using the program
