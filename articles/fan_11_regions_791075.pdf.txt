Regions identity between the genome of
vertebrates and non-retroviral families of insect
viruses
Gaowei Fan1,2 and Jinming Li1,2*

Abstract
Background: The scope of our understanding of the evolutionary history between viruses and animals is limited.
The fact that the recent availability of many complete insect virus genomes and vertebrate genomes as well as the
ability to screen these sequences makes it possible to gain a new perspective insight into the evolutionary
interaction between insect viruses and vertebrates. This study is to determine the possibility of existence of
sequence identity between the genomes of insect viruses and vertebrates, attempt to explain this phenomenon in
term of genetic mobile element, and try to investigate the evolutionary relationship between these short regions
of identity among these species.
Results: Some of studied insect viruses contain variable numbers of short regions of sequence identity to the
genomes of vertebrate with nucleotide sequence length from 28 bp to 124 bp. They are found to locate in
multiple sites of the vertebrate genomes. The ontology of animal genes with identical regions involves in several
processes including chromatin remodeling, regulation of apoptosis, signaling pathway, nerve system development
and some enzyme-like catalysis. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that at least some short regions of sequence identity
in the genomes of vertebrate are derived the ancestral of insect viruses.
Conclusion: Short regions of sequence identity were found in the vertebrates and insect viruses. These sequences
played an important role not only in the long-term evolution of vertebrates, but also in promotion of insect virus.
This typical win-win strategy may come from natural selection.

Background
The interaction between viruses and animals is quite
profound and complex. Precious studies have deeply
increased the depth of our understanding of their longterm evolutionary history in terms of genome sequence.
Viruses have a highly host-associated life circle. As a
result, they infect and occasionally integrate into the
germ line cells chromosome and are inherited vertically
as host alleles [1,2]. A growing number of nucleotide
sequences of viruses have been and continue to be
found in their respective host spices. These remnants of
ancient viral infections play an important role in offering
not only unforeseen sources of genomic novelty in their
hosts [1,3] but also molecular fossils to facilitate our

knowledge of the evolution process between viruses and
animals [4]. Some of these sequences identity in host
species were found to highlight several pathways including cell adhesion, Wnt signalling[5] and immunomodulation [6] as well as mammalian reproduction [7].
However, most of these discoveries were merely
addressed in an aspect of virus-host interaction and may
narrow our prospective to probe the links between
viruses and animals.
Here in a broad sense, we aimed at to identify the
possible regions identity between the genomes of vertebrates and non-retroviral families of insect viruses and
the possible role(s) of the identical sequences in evolution of the corresponding animal(s). Moreover, we
reported phylogenetic analysis of these identical
sequences. In this paper, we showed that at least some
of the sequences identity in vertebrates chromosomes

identified here are likely to come from insect viruses
and exapted during their long-term evolution.

Results
We screened several hundreds of insect viruses including DNA viruses and RNA viruses against 21 vertebrates. Of interest, dozens of short regions of sequence
identity were found between animals and viruses including double stranded DNA viruses and double stranded
RNA viruses (Table 1). Note that in our study more
short regions of sequence identity to a DNA-virus were
found than that to a RNA-virus which was also reported
in precious study [8]. Ranging from 28 bp to 124 bp,
these sequences identity were found in two possible
orientations in the respective animals. Most of these
regions were found in intergenic regions of the genomes, some were within introns. However, with occasional exception, regions of identity were also found
within gene-coding region. For example, in the case of
duck-billed platypus, sequence identity to Phthorimaea
operculella granulovirus occured within exon and coded
protein similar to ubiquitin. Pieces of sequence identity
that copy themselves and reinsert into the genome of
animals could be found in our study. Besides, two distinct short regions of sequence identity to a certain
virus also occurred in the same genome of the animal
suggesting that more than one distinct short region
derived from a virus invaded and fixed into the same
animal genome. For example, in the case of zebra finch
two distinct short regions identity to Choristoneura
occidentalis granulovirus were found within the genome
[GenBank:NW_002197778.1] with respective E-values
4e-23 and 1e-14.
The relationship between pseudo-genes and sequences
identity

The phenomenon that a large number of identified regions
were located near or within pseudo-genes caused our
attention and promoted us to investigate what the relationship between the sequences identity and pseudo-genes
was. To investigate this phenomenon further, we calculated the distance between the pseudo-genes and the end
(s) of the regions identity as described in Methods.
Figure 1 shows the relationship between the distance
from the ends of a short region of identity to the related
pseudo-gene and the percentage of pseudo-gene within
the distance. In our study, 7 out of 76 pseudo-genes harbor short regions of sequence identity. A rough rule of the
distribution is that most of the pseudo-genes are within
1000 kb flanking the ends of the short regions of identity.
Roles of genes containing sequences identity

Table 2 shows the important roles of genes containing
regions of sequence identity play in the evolution of

vertebrates ranging from chromatin remodeling, mitotic
cell cycle, signaling pathway, gene switch to signal transduction, cell-cell adhesion and nervous system
development.
Phyogenetic analysis

A screen of vertebrate genomes has unexpectedly
exhumed short regions of sequence identity to insect
viruses leading us to speculate about the evolutionary
relationship among these sequences. And then phyogenetic comparisons of these sequences identity were performed as described in Methods.
Sequence identity to Adoxophyes orana NPV

Significant blast hits to Adoxophyes orana NPV were
sequences from species including mammalian, virus,
fungi and bacteria (Figure 2). Sequences from Oryctolagus cuniculus, Cafeteria roenhergensis virus BV-PW1,
Penicillium chrysogenum Wisconsin 54-1255, Dictyostelium purpureum and Adoxophyes orana NPV grouped
into a single group with robust bootstrap support
(100%), suggesting that they are likely derived from the
same lineage. Cafeteria roenhergensis virus has the largest genome of any described marine virus and infects a
widespread marine phagocytic protest [9]. The argument
that cafeteria roenhergensis virus belongs to the fourth
domain of life is supported by recent study [10].
Sequence identity to Choristoneura occidentalis
granulovirus

Sequences matching Choristoneura occidentalis granulovirus were all identified in insects (Figure 3). In phylogenies, these short regions identity grouped into two
clades, the largest of which included matches related to
insect genomes suggesting that they are from the same
ancestral lineage. Sequence derived from Choristoneura
occidentalis granulovirus formed a single clade. It’s hard
for us to know whether sequences from insects originated from distinct Choristoneura occidentalis granulovirus linage or not.
Sequence identity to Culex nigripalpus baculovirus

We identified high-level significant matches to Culex
nigripalpus baculovirus in the genomes of plant, mammalian, insect (Figure 4). Phylogenies constructed
grouped Mouse, Drosophila willistoni with Culex nigripalpus baculovirus with a robust support (100%), suggesting they are likely derived from the same exogenous
lineage.
Sequence identity to Cydia pomonella granulovirus

Significant matches to Cydia pomonella granulovirus are
short regions identified in a broad range of lineage genomes including chordate, fungi, insects, vertebrates, protozoa and plant (Figure 5). Curiously, Cyprinus carpio,
Mus musculus and Theragra chalcogramma and some
other species grouped together into a larger well-surpported clade with Cydia pomonella granulovirus while

Mouse, Rattus, Schistoroma mansoni and Drosophila
melanogaster as well as Candida albicans grouped into a
smaller clade. Considering that a closely related species
doesn’t group into the same clade, the initial nucleotide
sequences flow from Cydia pomonella to the ancestor of
the Mus musculus at least post dated the split of Mus
musculus and Rattus norvegicus which occurred about
10 million years ago [11].

and protozoa as well as insects (Figure 6). Interestingly,
with a robust bootstrap support (97%) sequences from
Mouse and Leucania separata grouped into a single
group suggesting that they are likely derived from the
same ancestral lineage. As for sequences identity from
Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, fungi and bacteria
they may derive from distinct Leucania separata
lineages.

Discussion
In order to broaden the scope of people’s understanding
of the interaction between virus and animals, We
searched genomes of 21 currently available vertebrates
for sequences identity to that of insect viruses with
expectation that possible sequences identity may exist,
and unearthed lush short regions of sequence identity in
diverse animals. The chance matches of the search were
ruled out by performing reciprocal BLAST. With
sequence length from 28 to 124 bp, most of them are
non-functional, however, with exceptional occasions,
some are within exon.
The mechanism that nucleotide sequences flowed
from ancestral insect viruses to vertebrates is still
unclear. A possible explanation for the phenomenon is
due to genetic mobile element such as virus and phage

viruses largely exceeds the number of cells [12]. In our
data, short regions of sequence identity to virus is also
found in bacteria, for example, in the case of Leucania
separata, short region of identity is found in Ajellomyces
capsulatus. Besides, short regions of sequence identity in

the genomes of bacteria and bacteriophages as well as
human were identified recently [13]. And further study
is still warranted.
The fate of most acquired nucleotide sequences in the
chromosomes of animals has been to undergo deletion
due to homologous recombination [14], however, the
deletion rate decreased dramatically with age [14], and

finally only few fragments of the sequences fixed into
the genomes of germ line cells and passed from parent
to offspring vertically. These obtained sequences
undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping vertebrates
genome. Among the products of the short regions of
sequence identity, some involve in interaction with animals: chromatin remodeling, regulation of apoptosis, signaling pathway, nerve system development and some
enzyme-like catalysis. On one hand, these products take
in part in the formation of vertebrate, help to promote
the evolution of vertebrates. On the other hand, likewise, these products play an important role in promotion of virus persistence [5,15]. For the survival of virus,
the ideal can be achieved that the impact of its infection
will not harm the host and the risk of host pathology

will be reduced with a long-term host [15]. From this
aspect, the phenomenon that virus invaded animal(s)
and fixed its nucleotide sequences into the genomes of
the germ line cells and passed vertically is a typical winwin strategy both for the survival of virus sequences and
the long-term evolution of animal(s).
No discussion of short regions of sequence identity
would be complete without mention pseudo-genes.
Pseudo-gene which is known for non-functional, genelike sequences due to a high mutation rate is harbored
by mammalian genomes [16]. Lacking functional promoters or other regulatory elements, a pseudo-gene is not
transcribed [17,18]. Coincide with the studies that a
fixed viral insertion possibly decay into a pseudo-gene
[1,17], in our study 7 out of 76 pseudo-genes harbor

short regions of sequence identity. However, it is quite
confused that dozens of pseudo-genes were located near
the short regions identity from several hundred base
pair to more than one million base pair. A rough rule is
that most of them are within 1 Mb. The reason why so
many pseudo-genes are located nearby is not clear. The
explanation that the distribution of nearby pseudo-genes
is by chance seems not likely. The fact that pseudogenes tend to occur in the genome of families with
environmental-response functions shows that instead of
being dead, they may form a reservoir of diverse “extra
part” which can be helpful for an organism to get used

to its surroundings [19]. Alternative explanation is that
the short regions of sequence identity may function by
an unknown regulatory mechanism in the formation of
pseudo-genes. Note that in our study, in the case of
western clawed frog, short regions identity to Choristoneura occidentalis granulovirus were within intron of
the gene whose product is miscRNA. MiscRNA is short
for miscellaneous RNA, a general term for a series of
miscellaneous small RNA. It serves a variety of functions, including some enzyme-like catalysis and processing RNA after it is formed. Besides, some of these
small RNAs may serve as switches. Others, called RNAi,

silence genes by tagging their mRNA for destruction
[20,21]. Maybe some of these small RNAs serve as gene
switches, turning genes on and off, or just silence genes
with the help of RNAi. Besides, it’s known that enhancers as well as other regulatory elements can be 1 Mb
from the target gene [22]. The phenomenon that most
nearby pseudo-genes are within 1 Mb coincides with the
description above. Apparently, further study is needed to
address this possibility.
We have investigated the evolutionary radiation of
some of the identified short regions of insect viruses
and demonstrated a broad history of interaction
between insect viruses and vertebrates. It is interesting
to speculate that short regions of identity occurred
across a brand species. According to our data, at least
some short regions of identity identified in vertebrates
are derived from insect viruses. And the initial gene
flow from Cydia pomonella to the ancestor of the Mus
musculus at least post dated the divergence of Mus
musculus and Rattus norvegicus about 10 million years
ago. However, due to the limited samples, it is hard for
us to know whether some sequences identity of the
insect viruses and that of vertebrates shared the same
ancestral lineage or not. Since the evolution of some
viral sequences is more rapid than that of animals, it
may mask any two nucleotide sequences which actually
derived from the same ancestor [23].

Conclusions
Our study established that the genetic material derived
from insect viruses can flow to vertebrates and play a

significant evolutionary role for the development of vertebrates and the survival of the viruses. This win-win
strategy may be the result of natural selection.

Methods
Genome screening

The genomes of non-retroviral families of insect viruses
were screened against chromosome assemblies and
whole genome shotgun assemblies of 21 vertebrate species in silico approach using BLASTn with the resources
of NCBI. Insect viruses sequences with a high-level
identity (i.e. e-value < 0.001) of matches to vertebrates
nucleotide sequences were acquired. Then the acquired
animal sequences were used as queries to screen the
GenBank non-redundant (nr) database in a reciprocal
BLASTn search. Significant matches to retroviruses and
non-insect viruses were discarded, while the remaining
matches were considered as regions of identity to nonretroviral families of insect viruses.
Regions of identity were located in corresponding genome shotgun assemblies of vertebrates precisely. If
pseudo-genes were found near regions of identity (i.e.
2000 kb within their 5’ and/or 3’ ends) distance was calculated between the nearby pseudo- genes and 5’site
and/or 3’s site of regions of identity.
Phylogenetic analysis

For understanding the distribution and possible origin of
sequences identity, BLASTn was run with virus
sequences as queries to screen the GenBank non-redundant (nr) database. Significant hits with over 95%

identity and blast E-values of 10-7 or lower were identified as regions of sequence identity. And representative
sequences were extracted. These nucleotide sequences
were aligned using ClustalX[24] program and manually
edited. Neighbor-Joining (NJ) phylogenies[25] were then
constructed using the nucleotide sequence alignments
with PHYLIP [26]. A consensus tree was calculated with
the program Consensus of the PHYLIP package. Support for the ML trees was evaluated with a total of
1,000 bootstrap replicates.
