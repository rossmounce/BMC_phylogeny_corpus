Abstract
Background: Members of major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) include water-conducting aquaporins
and glycerol-transporting aquaglyceroporins. MIPs play important role in plant-water relations. The
model plants Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and maize contain more than 30 MIPs and based on
phylogenetic analysis they can be divided into at least four subfamilies. Populus trichocarpa is a model
tree species and provides an opportunity to investigate several tree-specific traits. In this study, we
have investigated Populus MIPs (PtMIPs) and compared them with their counterparts in Arabidopsis,
rice and maize.
Results: Fifty five full-length MIPs have been identified in Populus genome. Phylogenetic analysis
reveals that Populus has a fifth uncharacterized subfamily (XIPs). Three-dimensional models of all 55
PtMIPs were constructed using homology modeling technique. Aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity
filters, characteristics of loops responsible for solute selectivity (loop C) and gating (loop D) and
group conservation of small and weakly polar interfacial residues have been analyzed. Majority of
the non-XIP PtMIPs are similar to those in Arabidopsis, rice and maize. Additional XIPs were
identified from database search and 35 XIP sequences from dicots, fungi, moss and protozoa were
analyzed. Ar/R selectivity filters of dicots XIPs are more hydrophobic compared to fungi and moss
XIPs and hence they are likely to transport hydrophobic solutes. Loop C is longer in one of the
subgroups of dicot XIPs and most probably has a significant role in solute selectivity. Loop D in
dicot XIPs has higher number of basic residues. Intron loss is observed on two occasions: once
between two subfamilies of eudicots and monocot and in the second instance, when dicot and moss
XIPs diverged from fungi. Expression analysis of Populus MIPs indicates that Populus XIPs don't show
any tissue-specific transcript abundance.
Conclusion: Due to whole genome duplication, Populus has the largest number of MIPs identified
in any single species. Non-XIP MIPs are similar in all four plant species considered in this study.
Small and weakly polar residues at the helix-helix interface are group conserved presumably to
maintain the hourglass fold of MIP channels. Substitutions in ar/R selectivity filter, insertion/deletion
in loop C, increasing basic nature of loop D and loss of introns are some of the events occurred
during the evolution of dicot XIPs.

Background
Water transport in different parts of a plant is significantly
contributed by the integral membrane channel protein,
aquaporin, which is a member of the Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP) superfamily [1]. In addition to their role in
plant soil-water relations [2,3], members of this family are
also implicated in plant reproduction [4,5], cell elongation [6], plant cell osmoregulation [7] and seed germination [8]. Aquaporins also influence leaf physiology and
leaf movements [9,10], drought resistance [11], salt tolerance [12,13] and fruit ripening [14] in plants. MIP family
consists of both aquaporins [15] and aquaglyceroporins
[16,17]. A large number of MIP genes have been identified
in plants and they seem to be diverse. Arabidopsis [18],
maize [19] and rice [20,21] each have more than 30 MIP
genes. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the MIP genes
can be largely divided into at least four different subfamilies and they have been classified as plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), tonoplast intrinsic
proteins (TIPs), nodulin-26 intrinsic proteins (NIPs) and
small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) [18,19,21,22]. Three
additional subfamilies have been recently reported. In the
nonvascular moss Physcomitrella patens which is a primitive land plant, a novel plant MIP (GIP) homologous to
bacterial glycerol channels found in gram-positive bacteria has been identified [23]. Two other subfamilies found
recently in the same species are hybrid intrinsic proteins
(HIPs) and unrecognized X intrinsic proteins (XIPs) [24].
Substrate specificity, expression and localization of many
members of PIPs, TIPs and NIPs have been investigated.
Plant MIPs localize in plasma membranes (PIPs and some
NIPs) [25-27], tonoplast (TIPs) [28], endoplasmic reticulum (SIPs) [29] and other subcellular compartments [30].
In addition to water and glycerol [31-33], PIPs, TIPs and
NIPs facilitate the transport of other unconventional neutral solutes and gases [34]. This includes urea [35-37], lactic acid [38] and metalloids like boron [27,39], silicon
[26], arsenic and antimony [40,41]. Carbon dioxide [42],
hydrogen peroxide [43] and NH3 [44,45] are among the
other molecules that are transported by plant MIPs. The
transport activity of these MIP genes is regulated by many
factors including cotranslational and post-translational
modifications [46-48], gating [49] or subcellular trafficking [50,51]. Members of XIPs and HIPs are the least characterized and they need further investigation regarding
solute transport, expression and other properties.
Three-dimensional structures of proteins belonging to
MIP family have been determined from several organisms
[52-58] including a plant aquaporin SoPIP2;1 from spinach [49]. All MIP structures exhibit a conserved hourglass
fold with α-helical bundle comprising six transmembrane
(TM) helices (H1 to H6) and two half-helices. The halfhelices forming the seventh TM helix are from loops B and
E (LB and LE) that also possess the signature sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/134

Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA). These conserved motifs from the two
half-helices meet approximately at the center of the membrane giving rise to one of the two pore constrictions. The
second constriction, also known as aromatic/arginine (ar/
R) selectivity filter, is formed by four residues towards the
extracellular side approximately 8 Å from the NPA region.
The four residues in this selectivity filter are contributed
by transmembrane helices H2, H5 and the loop LE.
Molecular mechanism of water and glycerol transport,
exclusion of charged groups and specificity of solute transport have been investigated by computational [59-63]
and experimental studies [64,65]. Recently, homology
modeling was carried out on Arabidopsis, rice and maize
MIPs [21,66] and the structures were classified based on
the residues in the ar/R selectivity filter. The diversity of
pore configurations indicated that the plant MIPs could
transport much more diverse solutes than their counterparts in mammals.
The genome sequence of the model tree plant Populus trichocarpa (Black cottonwood) has been recently determined [67]. Phylogenetically, Populus is more closely
related to Arabidopsis than the model cereal plant rice. Populus is a eudicot and both Populus and Arabidopsis are clustered in angiosperm Euroside I clade [68]. The availability
of genomes of Arabidopsis, Populus and rice will facilitate
the study of comparative biology of all the three species.
As a second eudicot genome sequence with its modest
genome size, Populus trichocarpa offers unique opportunity to study some aspects that cannot be studied in other
model annual plants [68]. Examples include wood development, seasonality, flowering and natural variation [69].
Apart from its genomic sequence, other Populus genomic
resources such as Populus EST sequences, full-length cDNA
sequences and DNA microarrays also offer tools to study
Populus biology [70-72]. Populus is also a good model system in which long distance transport of water and nutrients can be investigated. However, there are only few
studies on poplar aquaporins and their role in long distance transport of water and other nutrients. Seven
aquaporins have been investigated in mycorrhized poplar
plants and it has been shown that there is a strong increase
in the capacity of water transport in plasma membrane of
root cells [73]. Analysis of EST sequences from the root of
hybrid cottonwood described the expression levels of Populus PIP and TIP members during different stages of
adventitious root development [74]. A recent study by
Danielson and Johanson [24] identified a group of
aquaporins from Populus belonging to the unrecognized
XIP category. As in Arabidopsis and rice, the availability of
Populus genome sequence gives an opportunity to identify
and characterize the whole repertoire of MIPs in this species. In this paper, we have carried out genome-wide analysis of Populus MIPs from its genomic sequence and
characterized them. We have identified 55 full-length MIP

genes in Populus and this is the largest number of MIP
genes identified in any single species to date. We have
compared several features of Populus MIPs with their
counterparts in Arabidopsis, rice and maize. The unique
features identified in Populus MIPs are discussed in this
paper.

Results
MIP genes in Populus genome
The whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequence of Populus
trichocarpa [67] available at NCBI [75] was searched using
TBLASTN [76] for genes coding for MIPs. The initial query
sequence from rice OsPIP2;1 resulted in identification of
41 Populus MIPs (PtMIPs). Five other query sequences representing PIP, TIP, NIP, SIP and XIP family members from
the initial search results yielded additional MIP proteins.
A list of more than 50 full-length MIP proteins from Populus WGS contigs was obtained (Table 1) after discarding
those sequences with missing transmembrane regions or
interrupted by a stop codon in the middle of the sequence
as predicted by the program GeneMark [77,78]. The Populus genome paper [67] has reported 67 genes belonging to
major intrinsic protein family (Table S12 in the reference
Tuskan et al. [67]), although the details are not mentioned. The Joint Genome Institute (JGI) has listed 63
aquaporin genes (KOG ID: 0223) belonging to Populus trichocarpa. We have carefully compared the MIP proteins
from our TBLASTN search result with those 63 from JGI
and found that there are 50 sequences common between
both of them. We find that 9 of the 63 MIP proteins from
JGI have to be discarded for various reasons (Additional
file 1: Table S1). Four JGI sequences were not found in our
search. One sequence from our search (NCBI accession
no. AARH01008299) is not present in the JGI list. Thus,
we have finally obtained 55 full-length MIP protein
sequences from Populus trichocarpa which is the largest set
of MIP sequences from any single species identified so far
and they are listed in Table 1. The available data shows
that forty four Populus MIP genes are nearly uniformly
spread over 13 of the 19 haploid chromosomes. Nine out
of 13 chromosomes have at least 3 MIPs each with the
highest number of eight MIPs observed in chromosome
IX (Table 1). The remaining genes are located on a scaffold
not yet assigned to a chromosome.
Comparison of Populus MIPs with MIPs of Arabidopsis,
rice and maize
PtMIPs were compared individually with MIPs from Arabidopsis (AtMIPs), rice (OsMIPs) and maize (ZmMIPs).
Then all MIPs from the four plant species were compared
together. Multiple sequence alignments of full length proteins using the program T-COFFEE [79] were generated on
different sets of MIP sequences, namely (i) PtMIPs, (ii)
PtMIPs and AtMIPs, (iii) PtMIPs and OsMIPs, (iv) PtMIPs
and ZmMIPs and (v) PtMIPs, AtMIPs, OsMIPs and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/134

ZmMIPs. The trees created using these alignments by
neighbor-joining (NJ) method shows that PtMIPs can be
classified into five subfamilies. PIPs, TIPs, NIPs and SIPs
from Populus clustered with the respective subfamilies
from Arabidopsis, rice and maize (Figure 1, Additional files
2 to 4). The fifth subfamily belongs to the uncharacterized
XIP family and is not observed in the other three plant
species. Sequences belonging to neither HIP nor GIP family [23,24] are found in all the four plant species. When
MIPs from all four plant species were considered together,
the corresponding non-XIP subfamily members clustered
together and XIPs observed only in Populus clustered separately (Additional file 4). The results of NJ method were
found to be very similar to those by heuristic distance,
parsimony and maximum likelihood methods with the
clustering more or less maintained in all three methods
(data not shown). Among the 55 PtMIPs, there are 15
PIPs, 17 TIPs, 11 NIPs, 6SIPs and 6XIPs. Both PIPs (15
PtPIPs vs 13 in other plants) and NIPs (11 PtNIPs vs. 9 to
13 in Arabidopsis and rice) are similar in number found in
other plants. The expression of most of the PtPIP and
PtTIP sequences are supported by the Populus EST
sequences (Table 1). The increase in the number of
PtMIPs can be attributed to the increase in the number of
PtTIPs and PtSIPs and also the presence of a new XIP subfamily with 6 members. The other three plants have 10 to
11 TIPs and 2 to 3 SIPs. The additional 15 PtMIPs belonging to TIP, SIP and XIP subfamilies explain the largest
number of MIPs observed in Populus.
Each subfamily was further subdivided into groups
according to their clustering in the phylogenetic tree and
their similarity with the known MIPs from other plants. As
in other plants, Populus PIPs and TIPs have two (PtPIP1
and PtPIP2) and five (PtTIP1 to PtTIP5) subgroups respectively. However, maximum number of seven subgroups is
observed for Arabidopsis NIPs while Populus, maize and
rice NIPs have only three to four subgroups. Two PtNIP
members (PtNIP3;1 and PtNIP3;2) have substitutions in
both NPA motifs. Although, two subgroups are observed
for PtSIP subfamily similar to other plants under study,
the number of SIP proteins found in Populus is the maximum observed so far. The Ala residue in the first NPA
motif in four out of 6 PtSIPs is substituted by Thr or Leu.
The uncharacterized XIP family found only in Populus
among the four species has two subgroups PtXIP1 and
PtXIP2. While sequences from other subfamilies have
been analyzed and studied experimentally, little is known
about the XIP family members. We have identified additional members of XIP family and further sequence analysis and homology modeling helped us to characterize
this subfamily further and the details are explained below.

Evolutionary relationship of Populus MIPs
Figure 1
Evolutionary relationship of Populus MIPs. Phylogenetic analysis of all Populus MIPs is shown along with MIPs from Arabidopsis. Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method was used to create this unrooted tree. NJ method used the multiple sequence alignment
generated by T-COFFEE to generate the tree. Populus MIP subfamilies PtPIPs, PtTIPs, PtNIPs and PtSIPs clustered with the corresponding Arabidopsis MIP subfamilies. XIPs observed only in Populus clearly form a separate group. Each MIP subfamily is
shown with a specific background color to distinguish them from others. A similar result is obtained when the same analysis
was carried out with rice and maize MIPs (Additional files 2 to 4).

XIP subfamily members in other species
Danielson and Johanson [24] have reported 19 XIP members that included 5 Populus XIPs. Among the XIPs, 10
were from dicot plants other than Populus, three were from
moss and one was from a protozoa. No XIP homolog was
found in monocots. We examined all these sequences and
found that the sequence from Nicotiana benthamina (GenBank ID: CK295158) lacks the first transmembrane segment. Similarly, one of the EST sequences for Liriodendron
tulipifera (GenBank ID: DT60037) is lacking NCBI record.
Hence, these two sequences were discarded for further
analysis of XIP sequences. In addition to the 6 Populus
XIPs identified in the present study (5 of them have been
reported by Danielson and Johanson [24] also), we have
considered the 12 additional XIP sequences from plants,
moss and the protozoa reported earlier [24].

In order to identify additional XIP members, we used each
of the six PtXIP sequence as a query and searched the plant
EST databases using TBLASTN [80]. We have identified an
additional 8 XIP sequences from dicot plants (Table 2).
We also carried out TBLASTN searches on various completed and partial genome sequences of different organism groups available in NCBI. To our surprise, many hits
were obtained from organisms that are classified as fungi
with e-values ranging from 4.0E-17 to 1.0E-04. The program GeneMark [77,78] was used to identify the coding
regions and we found 9 full-length (Table 3) and 5 partial
fungi MIP sequences based on GeneMark predictions. Partial fungi sequences were not considered for further analysis (Additional file 1: Table S2). Thus our search of plant
EST database and fungi genomic sequences yielded
another additional 17 XIP sequences. Taken together, we
have considered 6 Populus XIPs, 16 XIPs from other dicot

plants, 9 fungi XIPs, 3 moss XIPs and 1 protozoan XIP
(Total 35 XIPs) for further analysis.
We have carried out phylogenetic analysis of all PtMIPs
along with all XIPs. The XIPs from fungi, other dicot
plants and moss clustered together with PtXIPs and are
grouped separately from other Populus subfamilies
namely PtPIPs, PtTIPs, PtNIPs and PtSIPs (Additional file
5). When only XIP members are considered, the fungi and
moss XIPs form two independent clusters separate from
the dicot XIPs (Figure 2). All the dicot XIPs fall into one of
the two subgroups, XIP1 or XIP2. The lone XIP from protozoa does not fall into any of the four groups. Analysis of
pairwise sequence alignments indicates that the XIP
sequences within the subgroup are highly similar. The
average sequence identities between pairs of sequences
within XIP1 and XIP2 groups are ~71% and ~70% respectively (Table 4). However, the sequence variation between
the two XIP groups is significant and the average sequence
identity falls to ~40% when sequences are compared
across the two groups. XIPs of dicot plants have diverged
from those sequences from fungi and moss. The range of
average sequence identities between plant XIPs and fungi/
moss XIPs varies from ~27% to 34%. Among the fungi
XIPs, some pairs of sequences are very similar. For example, XIP sequences from Fusarium oxysporum and Gibberella
moniliformis have ~94% sequence identity. When all 36
possible fungi XIP pairs from 9 sequences are considered,
the average pairwise sequence identity is only ~47%.
However, there are four pairs within fungi XIPs whose
sequence identity exceeds 70%. When PtXIPs are compared with other MIP subfamilies in Populus, namely

Figure 2 (see previous XIPs
Phylogenetic analysis ofpage)
Phylogenetic analysis of XIPs. All 35 XIPs from dicot plants, fungi, moss and protozoa have been used to construct the
phylogenetic tree using NJ method. Multiple sequence alignment for creating the phylogenetic tree was generated by T-COFFEE. XIPs from dicot plants, fungi and moss cluster separately. All dicot XIPs cluster into two subgroups XIP1 and XIP2. All
fungi XIPs and some dicot XIPs (Table 2) have been identified in this study. Other dicot XIPs, moss XIPs and the lone XIP from
protozoa were identified by Danielson and Johanson. The names of Populus XIPs, dicot XIPs identified in this study and fungi
XIPs are given in Tables 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The names of other dicot and the protozoan XIPs are given as follows with

level. To date, the structure of only one plant MIP protein
(SoPIP2;1) has been determined experimentally at atomic
level [49]. Homology modeling technique has been used
to build three-dimensional models of plant MIPs and it
helped to identify different structural subclasses based on
the residues in the ar/R selectivity filter [21,66]. Such an
approach also helped to identify the group conservation
of small/weakly polar residues at the helix-helix interface.
We have modeled all the PtMIP proteins and the additional XIPs found in other dicot plants, fungi, moss and
protozoa. We have analyzed the ar/R selectivity filters of
all PtMIPs with a specific focus to XIP proteins. The nonXIP proteins from Populus have been compared with those
from XIPs. Our structure-based sequence alignments of
PtMIPs and XIPs help us to identify features in XIP proteins that distinguish them from MIPs from other subfamily.
Analysis of ar/R selectivity filters in PtPIPs, PtTIPs, PtNIPs
and PtSIPs indicate that residues forming the selectivity
filter region are very similar to their counterparts in other
three plants compared in this study. Only three out of 49
non-XIPs show some distinct features in this region (Table
5). With the lone exception of PtPIP2;10, all PIPs from
Arabidopsis, rice and maize and 14 out of 15 PtPIPs have
Phe from helix H2, His from helix H5, Thr and Arg from
loop E (LE1 and LE2 positions) forming the ar/R selectivity region. PtPIP2;10 has Asn in the place of Phe in H2
position making the pore constriction more hydrophilic
(Figure 3A). Among the PtNIPs, PtNIP1;5 is somewhat
similar to the other members of PtNIP1 subgroup. However, it has two small residues in positions H5 and LE1
making the size of the constriction at this point relatively
larger. Similarly, PtSIP1;1 has a unique substitution in the
ar/R tetrad in which the conserved Arg in loop E is
replaced by bulky hydrophobic Phe. With the other three
positions occupied by hydrophobic residues (Ile in H2,
Val in H5 and Pro in LE1), this could be one of the most
hydrophobic pore constriction in the MIP members (Figure 3B). Overall our results suggest that majority of
PtMIPs that are not XIPs have ar/R signatures similar to
the ones present in Arabidopsis, rice and maize. This might

be an indication that these MIPs from Populus facilitate the
transport of same or similar solute molecules that are
transported in other plants. In other words, only a couple
of PtMIPs belonging to the four well known subfamilies
could be involved in the transport of novel solute molecules that may be considered unique to Populus.
Analysis of three-dimensional models of PtXIPs and other
XIPs indicate that the features observed in ar/R selectivity
filters are distinct in some XIPs. Among all the XIPs, dicot
plant XIPs differ from those XIPs from moss and fungi.
XIPs from dicots can be divided into four structural subclasses based on ar/R signatures (Table 6). In the first
group, thirteen XIP sequences have Val/Ile (H2), Thr
(H5), Ala (LE1) and Arg (LE2) as ar/R signature. This is

Ar/R selectivity filters of PtPIP2;10 and PtSIP1;1
Ar/R selectivity filters of PtPIP2;10 and PtSIP1;1. Ar/R selectivity filters of non-XIP Populus MIPs that are not found in
their counterparts from Arabidopsis, rice and maize. Transmembrane regions of the MIP models from Populus were superposed
on the experimentally determined structures of glycerol transporter GlpF (PDB ID: 1FX8) and the water-transporting spinach
aquaporin SoPIP2;1 (PDB ID: 1Z98). Populus MIP residues are shown in stick representation with nitrogen and oxygen atoms in
blue and red colors respectively. PtMIP residues are displayed in one letter code and their corresponding positions in the
selectivity filter are indicated. For comparison purpose, the ar/R filters of GlpF and SoPIP2;1 are also shown in blue and pink
respectively. (A) Out of 54 PIPs from four plants, PtPIP2;10 is the only PIP in which the Phe at H2 position is substituted by an
Asn, making it more hydrophilic. (B) Residues forming the ar/R filter of PtSIP1;1 are very hydrophobic. Even the normally conserved Arg at LE2 position is substituted by a hydrophobic Phe. This will be one of the most hydrophobic constrictions in
known MIPs.

similar to the ar/R filter of PtNIP3;1 and PtNIP3;2 in
which the positions of hydrophobic and Thr (or Ser) residues are interchanged in the positions H2 and H5. In the
second group, the Ala at LE1 position of the first group is
replaced by Val making it more hydrophobic than the first
group. In the third group, hydrophobic residues Val and
Ile occupy three out of four positions (H2, H5 and LE1)
with the conserved Arg at LE2 retained. This results in a
highly hydrophobic environment at the pore constriction
(Figure 4A) and it is somewhat similar to PtSIP1;1. The
last group with one protein (PtXIP1;4) has ar/R tetrad
similar to some of the NIP members of rice and maize
(OsNIP2;1, OsNIP2;2, OsNIP3;2, OsNIP4;1, ZmNIP2;1
and ZmNIP2;2). Small residues Ala/Thr are observed in
three out of four positions making the constriction larger.
In general, dicot XIP members from groups II and III significantly deviate from other subfamilies of PtMIPs and
display more hydrophobic character at the ar/R selectivity
filter compared to other PtMIPs.
Comparison of ar/R filters in moss XIPs (Table 6) indicates that all three of them have different signatures and

hence each one can be considered as a separate group.
PpXIP1;1 has a signature similar to a TIP protein from rice
and maize (OsTIP4;2 and ZmTIP4;3). Similarly, ar/R tetrad of PpXIP1;2 has resemblance to another TIP protein
from rice and maize (OsTIP5;1 and ZmTIP5;1). Interestingly, these two ar/R motifs are not found in Arabidopsis.
The third XIP from moss has a Tyr at H2 position and Tyr
residue has not been observed as part of the ar/R signature
in any of the 160 plant MIPs analyzed from the four plant
species. The ar/R filters of all three moss XIPs are more
hydrophilic than their counterparts in dicot plants.
The only example from the protozoa has bulky residues in
all four positions that form the ar/R filter. Danielson and
Johanson [24] have observed that this non-plant
sequence from amoeba has some of the sequence characteristics such as NPA boxes and ar/R filter different from
other XIPs.
Majority of fungi XIP sequences (7 out of 9 forming group
I) has ar/R tetrad in which the H2 position is occupied by
Asn (Table 6). Small residues are found in H5 and LE1

positions and the highly conserved Arg is observed in LE2
(F-TaXIP has a Lys residue in this position; Figure 4B).
This signature is very different from that of dicot plant
XIPs which are more hydrophobic. However, the group I
fungi XIPs shows striking similarity with the ar/R filter of
a moss XIP (PpXIP1;1) which in turn is similar to some of
the rice and maize TIPs. Asn in H2 position is replaced by
Gln in PpXIP1;1 and other features of ar/R filter are
retained. Similarly, F-TsXIP from group II of fungi MIPs
has ar/R signature similar to that of PpXIP1;2. The weakly
polar and hydrophobic residues at H5 and LE1 positions
are interchanged in the moss XIP. The XIP forming the
third group in fungi (F-TvXIP2) is the only example that
shows some similarity to group I dicot XIPs. One hydrophobic, two small/weakly polar residues with the conserved Arg at LE2 is the characteristic of ar/R motif in this
group which is also shared by some members of Populus
NIPs (PtNIP3;1 and PtNIP3;2).
In summary, PtMIPs that do not belong to XIP subfamily
have ar/R selectivity filter similar to those found in Arabidopsis, rice and maize. Residues forming ar/R tetrad in
fourteen dicot XIP sequences are found to be similar to the
NIP sequences from the Populus, rice and maize. The ar/R

selectivity filters of the remaining eight dicot XIPs are
more hydrophobic in nature and lack counterparts in
other subfamilies of plants considered in this study. On
the other hand, the moss and fungi XIPs have ar/R constriction that are more hydrophilic and similar to rice and
maize TIPs. The analysis of ar/R selectivity filters based on
homology modeling shows clear distinction between
dicot XIPs and moss/fungi XIPs.
Comparison of loops in XIPs and other MIP subfamily
members
Although transmembrane segments in aquaporin give
structural scaffold and define the channel environment,
loops connecting the TM helices also have significant role
in the function of the channel such as gating [49] and
could possibly be involved in selectivity also [58,81].
Among the five loops (A to E), the high conservation of
residues observed in loops B and E are due to these loops
possessing the NPA signature motif and their residues
defining the channel interior and selectivity filter. The
loop A, connecting H1 and H2, was used to discriminate
the groups within Populus PIP family [73]. Loops C and D
have been implicated in solute selectivity [58] and gating
[49] respectively. Hence features observed in these loops

Ar/R selectivity filters of PtXIP2;1 and F-FoXIP
Ar/R selectivity filters of PtXIP2;1 and F-FoXIP. Ar/R selectivity filters of two XIPs, one from a dicot plant (PtXIP2;1)
and the other from fungi (F-FoXIP). XIP models were first individually superposed on the experimentally determined structures of GlpF and SoPIP2;1 as described in Figure 3. Residues of XIP models are shown in stick representation with nitrogen
and oxygen atoms displayed in blue and red respectively. For other details, see the caption of Figure 3. (A) Ar/R selectivity filter
of PtXIP2;1 has three hydrophobic residues and is likely to transport a more hydrophobic solute. (B) The presence of Asn and
Arg along with two small residues makes the ar/R selectivity filter of F-FoXIP more hydrophilic and result in a wider constriction. Such XIPs are likely to transport bulkier hydrophilic solutes.

could be an important factor in giving rise to (i) different
MIP subgroups, (ii) determining the nature of solute that
is transported and (iii) functioning of the channel itself.
We specifically focused on the loops C and D to find out
whether they could be used to discriminate PtXIPs from
the other Populus subfamily members. We also analyzed
dicot XIPs and fungi/moss XIPs separately. We first used
structure-based sequence alignment to segregate
sequences in the loop regions and then used T-COFFEE
[79] method to align only the part belonging to the
respective loop regions from all MIP sequences and also
independently from the subfamilies.
Loop C
Among the four known plant MIP subfamilies, the lengths
of loop C in PIPs and a subgroup of SIPs (SIP2s) are the
largest (> 20 residues) and the smallest (14 residues)
respectively (Table 7). Exceptions are observed in few
members. For example, ZmTIP5;1 has 29 residues. However, the same analysis for XIP members show some interesting features. In general, the length of loop C can be
used to distinguish the dicot and moss XIPs from other
plant MIP subfamilies. All 18 dicot XIPs belonging to the
first subgroup (XIP1s) are observed to have much longer

C loop with 33 residues (Figure 5). The length of the same
loop in XIP2 members is shorter by 8 residues, but still 5
residues longer than plant PIPs. Surprisingly, the loop C
of all moss XIPs are similar to the dicot XIP1s and all are
having loop C with more than 30 residues. Fungi XIPs, on
the other hand, has much shorter loop C among all XIPs
and its length is comparable to that of plant PIPs with 20
residues (Figure 5).
Analysis of loop C residues indicates that some MIP families are enriched with Gly residues in this loop. All XIPs
have at least three Gly residues and dicot XIPs have more
Gly residues than any other MIPs (Table 7). Twenty out of
22 dicot XIPs have at least five Gly residues in loop C (Figure 5). Similarly, loop C in 52 out of 54 PIPs contains at
least four Gly residues (Additional file 6). However, TIPs
and NIPs possess less number of Gly in loop C than their
counterparts in PIPs and XIPs, although some exceptions
are seen. For example, OsNIP1;2 and OsNIP1;5 have
respectively 9 and 7 Gly residues in loop C. SIPs have the
least number of Gly (2 or 1) in this loop. The longer loop
and larger number of Gly residues indicate that the loop
C in dicot XIPs is much more flexible than other MIP
members.

When we analyzed the loop C of human counterparts,
four out of thirteen human aquaporins (AQP3, AQP7,
AQP9 and AQP10) contain 35 residues in loop C and all
four also possess at least 3 Gly residues (Table 7). These
human MIP homologs are known to be glycerol transporters, a feature also shared by the prototype glycerol transporter, the bacterial GlpF. GlpF with 39 residues in loop C
is one of the longest known in aquaporin family. Most of
the other human aquaporins have loop C with 20 to 23
residues, shorter by more than 10 residues compared to
their glycerol-transporting counterparts. Although, it is
tempting to correlate the length of loop C with the glycerol transporting property, several plant NIPs are known
to transport glycerol [65] and they have much shorter
loop C and their length is only half of what is observed in
dicot XIPs and GlpF. However, the fact that the loop C residues have a role to play in the selectivity of solute transport has support from experimental studies (see
Discussion).
Loop D
The crystal structure of plant plasma membrane
aquaporin clearly demonstrates the involvement of loop
D in gating of the channel [49]. Loop D is, in general,
shorter than loop C. Among the four major non-XIP subfamilies, PIPs have longer D loop with 13 to 14 residues
(Additional file 7). D loops in SIPs are the shortest with 8
to 9 residues (Table 7). There are some exceptions like
AtPIP1;4 and AtNIP1;1 that have more than 20 residues in
loop D. Analysis of loop D sequences in XIPs indicates

that all of them have slightly longer loop D (15 to 16 residues) compared to that of plant MIPs from other subfamily members (Figure 6).
Computational studies on a mammalian AQP1 have indicated that the basic residues in loop D could be significant
in cation transport in the central channel formed by the
tetramer [82]. We have examined the occurrence of
charged residues in loop D of all plant MIP families (Table
7). In general, loop D in dicot XIPs is more basic, having
at least three basic residues compared to their counterparts in moss and fungi (Figure 6). The loop D of all the
fungi XIPs is rich in proline residues and no proline is
observed in the same loop in majority of dicot XIPs.
Among non-XIP members, PIPs have four basic residues
compared to two or less in TIPs, NIPs and SIPs (Additional file 7). Similarly, two out of four glycerol-transporting human AQPs have less number of basic residues than
other human homologs. This analysis indicates that the
possible influence of loop D in gating of the central channel could be different in different species.
Group conservation of residues at the helix-helix interface
Analysis of high-resolution crystal structures of MIP
homologs showed that small and weakly polar residues
(Ala, Gly, Ser, Thr and Cys) occur at the helix-helix interface of transmembrane helix bundle [21,54,83]. Structure-based sequence alignment of 105 MIP sequences
from Arabidopsis, rice and maize indicated that these residues are conserved as a group at the helix-helix interface

at 17 positions in MIP proteins [21]. High abundance of
such residues helps to mediate helix-helix interactions
and close packing of helices [84]. In this study, we have
analyzed the group conservation at those 17 positions by
considering 55 Popular MIPs and all the XIPs using structure-based sequence alignment. Our results show that in
Populus MIPs also small and weakly polar residues are

group conserved at the helix-helix interface (Table 8). As
observed in the other three plant species, PtPIPs have the
highest conservation in which all 17 positions are 100%
group conserved (Additional file 8). This is followed by
PtTIPs (82 - 100%) and PtNIPs (91 - 100%). Group conservation at helix-helix interface is in general high in
PtSIPs and PtXIPs, although some positions are poorly

conserved. The conservation of Ala 78, Gly 82 and Ser 181
(the numbering followed here is that of 1Z98, the structure of SoPIP2;1) is below 50% in PtSIPs. Similarly, the
positions corresponding to Thr 55, Ala 103, Ser 181 and
Ala 256 are either poorly conserved (< 25%) or not conserved at all in PtXIPs. It must be mentioned that the
number of sequences considered for PtXIPs is only six,
and analysis of all 22 dicot XIP sequences also gives rise to
a similar observation (Table 8).
Analysis of 9 fungi XIPs indicates that the group conservation of small and weakly polar residues is 100% for 9 positions and is very high for another 5 positions. There are
differences between dicot and fungi XIPs. For example, at
position 181, although the group conservation is only
23% in dicot XIPs, Gly is 100% conserved in fungi XIPs.
However, we observed the opposite at position 82. In the
dicot XIPs, the group conservation at this position is 77%
while in the fungi XIPs, there is absolutely no conservation. Similarly, the position 55 is reasonably well conserved in fungi XIPs and there is poor conservation in
dicot XIPs.
In the previous analysis, we have observed that subfamilies show strong preference for one or another amino
acid at certain positions [21]. A similar trend is observed
in Populus MIPs also. Notably, the position 226 is occupied by either Ser/Ala in PtPIPs, PtTIPs, PTNIPs and
PtSIPs. In PtXIPs a strong preference for Cys is observed at
that position (Additional file 8). Similarly, at position 253
Ala/Gly is predominantly found in the four non-XIP sub-

families and a preference for Cys is found in PtXIPs at the
same position. This is also confirmed in the analysis of 35
XIPs and all of them have Cys at position 226. In position
253, only dicot XIPs shows a strong preference for Cys
(Table 8).
Gene Structure of MIPs
Non-XIP Populus MIPs
The availability of three plant genomes, two dicotyledons
and one monocotyledon, enabled us to analyze and compare the gene structures of MIP genes belonging to different subfamilies and different species. Recently, gene
structures of MIPs from the avascular plant Physcomitrella
patens have also been analyzed [24]. Although the exonintron organization of AtMIPs has been reported [18],
comparison of MIP gene structures across the three plant
species has not been carried out. We have compared the
gene structures of PtMIPs with that of OsMIPs and
AtMIPs. In general, they show that the number and positions of introns are unique and are conserved within each
subfamily of a given species. However, major differences
are observed when the subfamilies from dicots are compared with those from the monocot.

Comparison of members from PIP subfamily shows that
the gene structures of majority of PtPIPs have three
introns, similar to that of AtPIPs (Figure 7). However,
only 3 out of 11 OsPIPs have the same organization. Eight
OsPIPs have lost at least one intron (two of the OsPIPs
belonging to the indica-cultivar group have been excluded
from this analysis). OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;7 have only one

intron and OsPIP2;8 has no intron. In most of the OsPIPs,
the intron between the helices H2 and H3 has been lost.
A similar result is observed for NIP subfamily (Figure 7).
Most of the PtNIPs have gene structures similar to that of
AtNIPs. Four introns are observed in 9 out 11 PtNIPs.
Gene structures of OsNIPs diverged from their counterparts in Arabidopsis and Populus. At least one intron is lost
in nine out of 13 OsNIPs and they have three introns or
less. In most of them, the intron between the TM helices
H2 and H3 is lost as in OsPIPs. Members of SIP subfamily
have two introns in Arabidopsis, rice and also most of the
Populus SIPs. PtSIP1;3 and PtSIP1;4 have no introns. Most
of the Populus (12 out of 17) and rice (7 out of 11) TIP
members and half of AtTIPs (5 out of 10) have two
introns. Four TIP members, each from rice, Arabidopsis
and Populus have lost one intron. However, it must be
pointed out that the intron lost in rice TIPs is not the same
as that observed in the other two dicot plant TIPs.
The gene structures of the non-XIP MIPs in two dicot
plants, Populus and Arabidopsis, are very similar (Figure 7).
Both PIP and NIP subfamilies have three and four introns
respectively in these two plants. The number and locations of introns in the PIP and NIP subfamilies of moss
plant Physcomitrella patens [24] are the same as that
observed in their counterparts in the two dicot plants. On
the other hand, intron loss is observed in rice PIP and NIP
subfamilies. This could be a general feature observed in
dicot and monocot PIP and NIP subfamilies and such

intron loss could have happened when monocots
diverged from dicots.
Populus XIPs versus moss/fungi XIPs
The pattern of exon -introns in five out of six PtXIPs has
already been reported and compared with that of two
moss XIPs [24]. Two introns in the N-terminal region are
observed in six out of seven XIPs. Due to the high degree
of variation observed in the N-termini, no conclusion was
reached regarding the conservation of intron positions
between the moss plant and Populus. Since the fungi XIPs
have been identified from their respective genome
sequences, it is possible to derive the gene structure of
these MIP sequences and compare them with that of Populus and Physcomitrella. It is interesting to note that in
addition to the N-terminal intron, six out of nine fungi
XIPs have at least one additional intron (Figure 8). In all
six of them, an intron is present between helices H5 and
H6. In three cases, additional introns are present between
helices H2 and H3 and also between H3 and H4.
Transcript abundance of non-PtXIPs and PtXIPs
Expression levels of all Populus MIPs were analyzed using
an Affymetrix microarray-based Poplar genome arrays
[85] as described in the Methods section. We have reanalyzed the Populus transcript abundance data generated by
Wilkins et al [85]. Transcript abundance of 50 out of 55
PtMIPs are available in the microarray dataset. There were
no probe sets for two TIPs (PtTIP5;1 and PtTIP5;2) and
three NIPs (PtNIP1;1, PtNIP1;2 and PtNIP1;5). Heatmap

(Figure 9) is produced for the remaining Populus MIPs
using the expression profiles obtained for nine different
tissues (seedlings grown under three different light conditions, young and mature leaves, female and male catkins,
roots and xylem). Probe sets were clustered using hierarchical clustering and the heatmap is displayed using this
clustering based on the transcript abundance pattern
using the program Heatplus [86]. Major PtMIPs that are
expressed in xylem, a tissue responsible for the woody
stem, are PtPIPs and PtTIPs. A similar result is observed in
root tissues also. Maximum number of PtTIPs is expressed
in seeds grown in different light conditions. PtNIPs and
PtSIPs are the predominant members expressed in male
and female catkins. No appreciable accumulation of transcripts in mature leaf and seedlings grown in continuous
darkness is found for NIPs and SIPs. The same is true for
PIPs in female catkins and seedlings grown in continuous
darkness and then transferred to light for 3 hrs. PtXIPs are
expressed in seven of the nine tissues studied. Only in
xylem and female catkins, no member of XIPs is found to
be expressed. Transcript abundance of two XIPs is found
in male catkins, root and three tissues of seedlings grown
in different light conditions. A single XIP is expressed in
mature leaf (PtXIP1;5) and young leaf (PtXIP2;1).

Discussion
Due to whole-genome duplication events, the number of
protein-coding genes in Populus is more than that
observed in Arabidopsis [67]. In the present study, we have
found 55 Populus MIP genes and this is much higher compared to the total of 35 Arabidopsis MIPs. Our studies show
that Populus has ~1.6 times MIP genes than those found in
Arabidopsis. This agrees with the reported observation,
based on comparative genomics studies, that for each Arabidopsis gene, 1.4 to 1.6 putative Populus homologs are
found [67]. The number of MIPs from rice and maize is
also found to be less than forty [19-21]. MIPs from these
four plants have been compared. Phylogenetic analysis
reveals that Populus MIPs can be divided into five subfamilies. The four known subfamilies PIPs, TIPs, NIPs and
SIPs are present in all the four plant species considered in
this study. Members of the fifth subfamily, XIPs, are
uncharacterized and are absent in Arabidopsis, rice and
maize. Recent studies have identified XIPs in the primitive
plant Physcomitrella patens. TIPs and SIPs are present in
larger number in Populus compared to the other three
plants. While Populus has 17 TIPs and 6 SIPs, Arabidopsis,
rice and maize each have only 10 to 11 TIPs and 2 to 3
SIPs. The higher number of MIPs found in Populus is
mainly attributed to the presence of higher number of
PtTIPs and PtSIPs in addition to the six PtXIPs.

Non-XIP MIPs from eudicot genomes have similar ar/R
filters and gene structures
Homology modeling was used to analyze the aromatic/
arginine selectivity filters of plant MIPs. Ar/R tetrads from
non-XIP PtMIPs were analyzed and compared with that of
their counterparts from Arabidopsis, rice and maize. Ar/R
filters of only three out of 49 non-XIP PtMIPs seem to be
different from the other three plants. Although, the larger
number of TIPs in Populus indicated the possible diversity
in the solutes transported by this subfamily, analysis of ar/
R selectivity filters of all PtTIPs indicated otherwise. They
are identical to AtTIPs and no member of PtTIP was found
to have ar/R filter that can be described as novel. Similarly,
nine out of 11 PtNIP members have counterparts in
AtNIPs. One or two examples are found in NIP and SIP
members where the ar/R filter is identical or similar to
rice/maize members. The analysis of ar/R selectivity filters
did not find any surprises and it shows that majority of
non-XIP PtMIPs are similar to their counterparts in Arabidopsis.

The availability of two eudicot genomes (Populus and Arabidopsis) and one monocot genome (rice) helps us to analyze and compare the gene structures of plant MIPs.
Differences observed in the pattern of exon - intron organization of MIPs from these three plant species can explain
the evolution of eudicot MIP gene family and also the
divergence of monocot MIPs from dicots. Intron loss is
observed in majority of the OsPIPs and OsNIPs compared
to the same subfamilies in Arabidopsis and in Populus. The
loss of introns observed in OsPIPs and OsNIPs might have
occurred independently during the evolution of rice to
achieve genome slimming [87]. It is also tempting to speculate that the intron loss in rice might have happened during the divergence of monocotyledonous and
dicotyledonous plants that occurred about 200 million
years ago (Mya) [88]. However, such generalization is
possible only after analyzing plant MIP gene structures
from a large number of monocot and dicot plants. In this
context, we would like to point out the recent work of Roy
and Penny [89] who have observed a high degree of
intron loss along a wide variety of eukaryotic lineages.
They have also found that intron losses have outnumbered intron gains during the evolution of plants.
XIPs in dicots and fungi differ in Ar/R selectivity filter, loop
C and gene structure
Our TBLASTN search on plant EST databases and fungi
genomic sequences identified additional XIPs from dicot
plants and fungi. In total, we considered 35 XIPs from
dicots, fungi and moss for characterizing this new subfamily. We analyzed several features including the nature
of ar/R selectivity filters, loop lengths, conservation of residues at the helix-helix interface and gene structures and
these features were compared between different species

Figure transcript abundance profiles of Populus MIPs
Relative 9
Relative transcript abundance profiles of Populus MIPs. A heat map showing the transcript abundance of MIPs from all
Populus subfamilies [85] is displayed using the program "Heatplus" [86]. This heat map is produced using the expression data
obtained from Populus eFP browser [103]. The transcript abundance levels for the Populus MIPs were clustered using hierarchical clustering based on Pearson correlation coefficients. Each row corresponds to the normalized expression profile of a particular gene and their names are shown. Data obtained for nine different tissues for each gene are represented in columns.
Symbols in the map represent as follows: ML -- mature leaf; YL -- young leaf; R -- root; DG -- dark-grown seedlings, etiolated;
DL -- dark grown seedling etiolated and then exposed to light for 3 hrs; CL -- continuous light-grown seedling; FC -- female
catkins; MC -- male catkins; X -- xylem. The data is normalized for each gene (row-normalized). The relative transcript accumulation is represented in a color code with green and red showing respectively the lower and higher levels of transcript accumulation.

groups within XIPs to understand the evolution of this
uncharacterized subfamily. Comparison was also made
between XIPs and other four subfamilies of Populus.
Ar/R filters in XIPs are hydrophilic in moss/fungi and more
hydrophobic in dicot plants
Homology models of XIPs were analyzed and divided into
structural subclasses based on the nature of residues that
constitute the ar/R selectivity filters. The 22 dicot XIPs
were divided into four structural subclasses. Fourteen of
them from two groups are similar to the NIP subgroups
from the four plants analyzed in this paper. Eight dicot
XIPs from the remaining two groups have bulky hydrophobic residues occupying two/three of the four positions. Some SIPs from Populus, rice and maize have such
arrangement although they lack the conserved Arg at LE2
position. All the three XIPs from moss and eight out of 9
fungi XIPs have hydrophilic residues occupying two out of
four positions. Small residues are found in the remaining
two positions of most of the fungi and all the moss XIPs.
This arrangement is very similar to some of the rice and
maize TIPs but it is not found in Populus and Arabidopsis.
In general, the ar/R selectivity filters of fungi and moss are
more hydrophilic than their dicot counterparts. This
clearly indicates that the nature of solutes that are transported by dicot XIPs will be very different from their counterparts in fungi/moss.

Ar/R filters of some of the XIPs are presented in the recent
work of Danielson and Johanson [24]. Two possibilities
are given for the residue at H5 position in their work. In
the present study, when the target sequence was aligned
with the template sequences during homology modeling
procedure, it resulted in aligning the conserved Gly in H5
and hence in our models, the residue at H5 position of ar/
R filters is the alternate residue reported in their paper
[24]. This residue is Ser/Thr in most of the cases. Even if
we consider the other possibility for H5 position (Val/Ile
for dicot XIPs) as reported in [24], the ar/R filter of dicot
XIPs will become even more hydrophobic compared to
fungi/moss XIPs. There is also a disagreement in the ar/R
tetrad reported for SmXIP1;1. Our model shows that the
H2 position in this moss XIP is occupied by a Tyr residue,
whereas Danielson and Johanson [24] have reported a
Leu residue at this position. Our structure-based sequence
alignment clearly shows that Tyr is more likely to occupy
this position (data not shown) which also makes the ar/R
filter more hydrophilic as observed in the other two moss
XIPs (PpXIP1;1 and PpXIP1;2)
Can the length of loop C be used as an indicator of XIP subfamilies?
Although the significance of loops B and E is one of the
most well established in aquaporin channel's function,
recent crystal structures from the plant spinach [49] and
the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum [58] have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/134

indicated the role of two other loops D and C in the channel's gating and selectivity. Loop C connects the two
halves of the channel protein linking the transmembrane
segments H3 and H4. The length of this loop from known
crystal structures varies from 20 residues in water-transporting human AQP1 [52] to 39 residues in glyceroltransporting GlpF [53]. This loop tucks into the channel
core towards the ar/R selectivity filter and comes in close
contact with the Arg residue at LE2 position of ar/R tetrad.
The nature of residues in loop C is suggested to influence
the solute molecules approaching the extracellular vestibule [58,81]. The length of loop C seems to be characteristic of different plant MIP subfamilies. Analysis of loop C
in XIP members shows variation among the XIP subfamilies. Dicot XIP1s, moss XIPs, glycerol-specific GlpF
and all four glycerol-transporting human AQP homologs
have loop C that is more than 30 residues long. Dicot
XIP2s and fungi XIPs have a smaller loop C with 20 to 25
residues as observed in other human AQP homlogs. Loop
C in GlpF has been suggested to provide an attractive site
for glycerol in the periplasmic vestibule [81]. Although,
there seems to be a correlation between the nature of solute transport and the length of the loop C, this relationship could not be very clearly established. For example, it
appears that all glycerol-transporting MIPs will have a
long loop C with > 30 residues. However, several plant
NIPs have been shown to transport glycerol [65] and
some of them have much shorter loop C with less than 20
residues. Similarly, if we assume that all water-transporting channels have shorter loop C with < 25 residues, then
the moss XIPs with hydrophilic ar/R selectivity filter are
likely to transport water along with other hydrophilic solutes with their C loop having more than 30 residues. A
clearer picture is likely to emerge if we have functional
data on more MIPs that can be directly linked with the
length of loop C.
We have also recognized another interesting feature that
some of the MIP families are enriched with Gly residues in
loop C. Dicot XIPs and PIPs have at least five and four Gly
residues respectively in loop C. It could be that these Gly
residues are present to impart flexibility to the loop or
they could adopt conformations that are not allowed for
other residues. We have examined the conformations of
the three Gly residues that are part of the 'GGG' motif in
both chains of spinach PIP structure (PDB ID: 1Z98;
[49]). All three Gly residues have a positive φ value (+66
to +102°) and a ψ value close to zero (-12 to + 17°) and
this conformation is not accessible to other residues.
Hence it is possible that Gly residues in the "GGGxN" and
"GGC" motifs of PIPs and XIPs in loop C could play an
important conformational role.

Intron loss is observed in moss and Populus XIPs
Exon-intron pattern helps us to understand the evolution
of XIP genes. Since all the Populus and fungi genes were
identified from their respective genome sequences and the
gene structure of Physcomittrella XIPs have been already
reported [24], it was possible to compare the exon-intron
organization of these 17 XIPs (6 from Populus, 9 from
fungi and 2 from P. Patens). While six out of 9 fungi MIPs
have at least two introns, a single intron at the N-terminus
is found in Populus and the moss XIPs. It appears that
intron loss has occurred during the evolution when the
moss plants diverged from fungi with moss XIPs having
retained only the N-terminal intron. When moss plants
further diverged to dicotyledons, no introns were inserted
in the coding region of XIPs. While the gene structures of
moss and dicot XIPs are similar, the fungi with more
introns have different pattern of exon-intron organization.
Subfunctionalization of XIPs: Expression profiles of non-PtXIPs vs
PtXIPs
Members of Populus XIP family are expressed in seven out
of nine tissues indicating that they don't show any tissuespecific transcript abundance. The fact that XIPs are not
found in monocots and they are not particularly specific
to any tissue indicates that the functions of XIP members
might have been taken over by other MIP members during
evolution. Clustering on the basis of transcript abundance
pattern shows that PtXIP1;1 and PtXIP1;2 are grouped
with PtTIP3;1 and PtTIP3;2. Analysis of ar/R selectivity filters of these members does indicate similar features. The
positions of a bulky hydrophobic residue and a polar residue at H2 and H5 positions in PtXIP1;1 and PtXIP1;2 are
exchanged in PtTIP3;1 and PtTIP3;2. Similarly, the transcript accumulation of PtXIP1;5 is most similar to
PtTIP1;8 and both their ar/R tetrads have two bulky
hydrophobic residues. PtXIP1;3 and PtXIP1;4 have closely
related transcription abundance profiles with PtNIP3;1
and PtNIP3;2. Both the groups share two small residues in
the ar/R selectivity filters. Thus analysis of Populus microarray data has indeed cast a light on likely members that
could replace PtXIPs in monocots. It is possible that the
XIP members became "functionally redundant" during
evolution and the above TIP and NIP members could
have substituted the functions of the redundant XIPs.
Evolution of dicot XIPs
Several reports, including fossil studies and molecular
clock estimates have speculated the animal and plant evolutionary lines. Recent protein sequence analysis has estimated that major lineages of fungi were present more
than 1000 million years ago and land plants appeared
after 300 million years [90]. Analysis of MIPs from primitive organisms to higher animals will help to understand
the evolution of these channel proteins and their trans-

port mechanisms of diverse solutes at molecular level.
Analysis of ar/R selectivity filters, loops and exon-intron
organization of 34 XIPs from fungi, moss and dicot plants
has given an idea about the evolution of this subfamily of
aquaporins from fungi to higher plants (XIP from protozoa is not included in this Discussion). The hydrophilic
ar/R selectivity filter in the fungi and moss XIPs indicates
that these MIPs are likely to be involved in transport of
hydrophilic solutes including water. The emergence of
higher plants could possibly indicate more diversity in the
solutes that are transported. The amino acids in the
hydrophilic ar/R selectivity filters of fungi and moss XIPs
were substituted by hydrophobic residues during the
divergence of higher plants and this selectivity filter has
become more hydrophobic in the dicot XIPs. As a result,
the dicot XIPs are likely to be involved in solutes that are
more hydrophobic than those transported by their counterparts in fungi and moss. With no XIP homolog found
in monocots, at least the XIPs might have been replaced
by some of the TIPs and NIPs with similar ar/R selectivity
filters and transcription abundance profiles. The loop C in
moss XIPs is longer than that of fungi XIPs and hence an
insertion of more than 10 residues has occurred in the
loop C of moss XIPs. While this length is retained in XIP1
group of dicot plants, the dicot XIP2s have loop C that is
shorter by 8 residues. Hence, a deletion event seems to
have occurred when dicot XIP2s evolved from moss or
diverged from dicot XIP1s. As far as the loop D is concerned, dicot XIPs have more basic residues in loop D
than their counterparts in fungi/moss and the only other
subfamily with more number of basic residues in loop D
is PIPs. As suggested for AQP1 [82], loop D in XIPs could
be involved in activating the central tetrameric ion channel upon binding to some signaling molecule. Although
evolution has made its mark in the selectivity filters and
loops, the group conservation of small and weakly polar
residues in the helix-helix interface of the α-helical bundle
observed in other MIP subfamilies is largely maintained
in XIPs also. Analysis of exon-intron pattern suggests that
intron loss has occurred in XIP genes when fungi diverged
from the lineage leading to primitive and higher plants. In
summary, during divergence from fungi and moss, the ar/
R selectivity filters of dicot XIPs has become more hydrophobic, loop C has become longer in a subgroup of dicot
XIPs and loop D has become more basic. Moreover, analysis of gene structure indicates that moss/Populus XIPs lost
introns when they evolved from fungi. The evolutionary
features observed for dicot XIPs are summarized in Figure
10. Some of the observations made in this study will be
strengthened as more genome sequences are available for
different kingdoms and we will have a better understanding of the evolution of MIPs at molecular level.

high conservation of small and weakly polar residues as a
group at the helix-helix interface is observed in all MIP
subfamilies. Presumably, such group conservation helps
to maintain the structural integrity of this channel protein
during evolution. Our results indicate that in comparison
to their counterparts in fungi and moss, dicot XIPs are
likely to transport more hydrophobic solutes. Loop C in
dicot XIPs in general and XIP1 subgroup in particular will
have a potential influence in the selectivity of the solutes.

Figure 10
Evolution of dicot XIPs
Evolution of dicot XIPs. A likely scenario for the evolution of dicot XIPs. The evolutionary events are indicated at
the point where the XIPs diverged. Dicot XIPs evolved from
fungi and moss through substitutions at ar/R selectivity filter,
insertion/deletion of loop C and loss of an intron. However,
small and weakly polar residues occurring at the helix-helix
interface are highly group-conserved.

Conclusion
We have analyzed 55 Populus MIP sequences and compared them with those from Arabidopsis, rice and maize. In
addition to the four known MIP subfamilies, Populus has
an additional uncharacterized XIP subfamily. The nonXIP Populus members are similar to their counterparts in
the other three plants. The ar/R selectivity filters of majority of PtMIPs and the characteristics of loops C and D are
similar to AtMIPs, OsMIPs and ZmMIPs. As far as the gene
structures are concerned, the number and positions of
introns are conserved within each subfamily of a given
species. However, the inter-species comparison indicates
that PIPs and NIPs of monocots lost introns when they
diverged from eudicots.
We have also characterized 35 XIPs belonging to four different taxonomic groups. Our results show that in comparison to a hydrophilic selectivity filters in fungi and
moss XIPs, substitutions in ar/R selectivity filters led to a
more hydrophobic constriction in dicot XIPs. A longer
loop C due to insertion is observed when moss and a subgroup of dicot XIPs evolved from fungi. When fungi XIPs
diverged, intron loss is observed in moss and dicot XIPs.
Analysis of microarray data indicates that Populus XIPs are
expressed in almost all the tissues studied and they don't
show any unique tissue-specific expression. While substitutions in ar/R tetrad and insertion/deletion events in
loops reflect the divergence of these channel proteins, a

Identification of Populus MIP genes
The genome sequence of Populus trichocarpa female individual "Nisqually 1" clone [67] was searched for MIP
genes using TBLASTN [76,80]. The whole genome shotgun sequence (WGS) of Populus available at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [75] was
used for this purpose with a rice MIP protein sequence
(OsPIP2;1) as a query sequence. The hits thus obtained
were subjected to phylogenetic clustering (see below).
One representative sequence from each cluster was chosen
as query sequence to identify additional and more distantly related Populus MIP homologs. Regions in Populus
WGS contigs containing MIP genes were used to find out
the gene structure using the program GeneMark.hmm ES3.0 [77,78]. This version of GeneMark program is based
on self-training algorithm for prediction of genes from
novel eukaryotic genomes. There is significant similarity
between Populus and Arabidopsis at the genome level and
also the relative frequency of protein domains [67].
Between these two organisms, there is similarity in the
codon usage also [70]. Hence, for gene prediction in Populus, Arabidopsis was chosen as a model organism in GeneMark. The predicted MIP genes were further compared
with the Populus EST sequences available at NCBI and also
the Populus EST database "PopulusDB" [70,72]. The KOG
(euKaryotic Orthologous Groups) browser in Joint
Genome Institute (JGI) [91] was also looked for Populus
MIP genes.

The program T-COFFEE [79] was used to perform multiple sequence alignment on MIP protein sequences which
was then used to generate phyologenetic tree. Three different methods were used to construct the evolutionary relationship among the sequences. They include neighborjoining method as implemented in Clustal (Version 1.82)
[92] and heuristic searches using distance and parsimony
methods as available in PAUP* version 4.0.0d55 in GCG
package (Wisconsin Package version 10.3, Accelrys Inc.,
San Diego, California). The stability of branches in the
resulting trees was confirmed by 100 bootstrap trails for
all the three methods. The program TreeView [93] was
used to display the trees.

Homology modeling of plant MIPs
Three-dimensional models of Populus MIPs and other MIP
proteins were built using the same protocol described in
our earlier studies [21] to build models of Arabidopsis, rice
and maize MIPs and it is briefly described below. Modeling procedure consisted of two stages. In the first stage,
the software package MODELLER [94,95] was used to
construct homology models of plant MIPs. In the second
stage, the program SCWRL3 [96] was used to predict the
side-chain conformation. MODELLER derives a set of spatial restraints on the structure of the target sequence using
its alignment with the sequence of template structure(s).
The resulting model is derived by optimizing the violations of all spatial restraints. The quality of the model is
usually improved by considering more than one structure
as template. In this study, we used the structures of mammalian AQP1 [52], bacterial GlpF [53] and archael AQPM
[55] simultaneously as templates in their comparative
modeling procedure. Their unique PDB IDs are 1J4N,
1FX8 and 2F2B respectively. All are high resolution structures (resolution 1.7 to 2.2 Å) and show different water
permeabilities [96]. Using the program 'GAP' available in
GCG package and the scoring matrix BLOSUM62, we
found the pairwise sequence alignment of all Populus
MIPs with the three template sequences. The average pairwise sequence identities between Populus MIPs and the
three templates range from 21 to 45%. Template
sequences were first aligned based on a multiple structural
superposition and then the target sequence was aligned.
The target-template alignment was manually checked to
find out if there is any gap in the middle of a transmembrane helical region or in the conserved loops B or E. If
necessary, this alignment was manually refined. We have
also analyzed more than 800 MIP sequences from diverse
organisms (Gupta and Sankararamakrishnan, Manuscript
in preparation) and found that at least one residue in each
transmembrane segment (E17, G59, Q103, E144, G175
and P218 respectively in TM1 to TM6; 1J4N numbering)
is very highly conserved. We have exploited this information during the alignment of target and template
sequences and hence there is less ambiguity in transmembrane segments. The models were built with the resultant
target-template alignment using a 'very fast' simulated
annealing optimization protocol. Ten models were built
for each target sequence and the one with the lowest
MODELLER objective function was selected. The refinement of loops and the side-chain conformations of nonconserved residues were carried out by MODELLER's loop
optimization procedure and the graph theory-based
SCWRL3 [96] method respectively. Finally, the model was
minimized using GROMACS [97,98] and its stereochemical quality was evaluated using PROCHECK [99]. Pore
diameter profile of the model along its pore axis was calculated using the program HOLE [100] as described in
Bansal and Sankararamakrishnan [21].

Populus microarray analysis
The transcript abundance of all Populus MIPs was analyzed
using PopGenExpress, an Affymetrix microarray-based
resource for poplar transcriptome analysis [85]. Expression data was obtained in biological triplicate RNA samples extracted in nine tissues by Malcolm Campbell and
coworkers [85] and we have reanalyzed this transcript
abundance data to find out whether there is any pattern of
transcript accumulation in Populus MIP members. The
microarray data corresponding to these experiments can
be accessed in the NCBI's GEO database [101] (accession
number: GES13990). Probe sets corresponding to the
putative Populus MIPs were identified using Probe Match,
a tool available as part of the NetAffx Analysis Center
[102]. The identified probe sets were then used in the Populus electronic fluorescent pictograph browser (Poplar eFP
browser) [103] to find out the transcript abundance levels. For genes with more than one probe sets, the median
of expression values were considered. When two genes
have the same probe set, then they are considered to have
same level of transcript accumulation. The probe sets were
then clustered using hierarchical clustering based on Pearson coefficients and the program Heatplus available in
Bioconductor package [86] was used to display the expression pattern.
