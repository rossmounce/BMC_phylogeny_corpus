Abstract
Background: Hookworms are blood-feeding nematodes that parasitize the small intestines of many
mammals, including humans and cattle. These nematodes are of major socioeconomic importance and
cause disease, mainly as a consequence of anaemia (particularly in children or young animals), resulting in
impaired development and sometimes deaths. Studying genetic variability within and among hookworm
populations is central to addressing epidemiological and ecological questions, thus assisting in the control
of hookworm disease. Mitochondrial (mt) genes are known to provide useful population markers for
hookworms, but mt genome sequence data are scant.
Results: The present study characterizes the complete mt genomes of two species of hookworm,
Ancylostoma caninum (from dogs) and Bunostomum phlebotomum (from cattle), each sequenced (by 454
technology or primer-walking), following long-PCR amplification from genomic DNA (~20–40 ng) isolated
from individual adult worms. These mt genomes were 13717 bp and 13790 bp in size, respectively, and
each contained 12 protein coding, 22 transfer RNA and 2 ribosomal RNA genes, typical for other
secernentean nematodes. In addition, phylogenetic analysis (by Bayesian inference and maximum
likelihood) of concatenated mt protein sequence data sets for 12 nematodes (including Ancylostoma
caninum and Bunostomum phlebotomum), representing the Ascaridida, Spirurida and Strongylida, was
conducted. The analysis yielded maximum statistical support for the formation of monophyletic clades for
each recognized nematode order assessed, except for the Rhabditida.
Conclusion: The mt genomes characterized herein represent a rich source of population genetic markers
for epidemiological and ecological studies. The strong statistical support for the construction of
phylogenetic clades and consistency between the two different tree-building methods employed indicate
the value of using whole mt genome data sets for systematic studies of nematodes. The grouping of the
Spirurida and Ascaridida to the exclusion of the Strongylida was not supported in the present analysis, a
finding which conflicts with the current evolutionary hypothesis for the Nematoda based on nuclear
ribosomal gene data.

Background
Hookworms (Nematoda: Strongylida: Ancylostomatoidea) are blood-feeding nematodes that inhabit the small
intestines of their mammalian host. Species of Ancylostoma, Necator, Bunostomum and Globocephalus, for instance,
are of major human or animal health significance in various countries [1-6]. The infective, third-stage larvae (L3)
can be ingested or penetrate the skin of the host and
migrate via the circulatory system and the lungs to finally
reside, as dioecious adults, usually in the duodenum. The
adults attach via their buccal capsule to the intestinal
mucosa, rupture capillaries and feed on blood. The pathogenesis of hookworm disease in humans and other animals is mainly a consequence of the blood loss, which
occurs during parasite attachment and feeding in the
intestine. Cutaneous infection can occur and is often associated with inflammatory/immune responses and painful,
eruptive lesions during the migration of larvae through
the skin [7,8].
Current estimates indicate that more than 740 million
people are infected with the hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus [9], and ~80 million are
severely clinically affected by hookworm disease [10]. In a
large number of developing countries, hookworms are a
leading cause of iron deficiency anaemia, which, in heavy
infections, can cause physical and mental retardation and
deaths in children as well as adverse maternal-foetal outcomes [10,11]. Although there is considerably less information on the prevalence and geographical distribution
of hookworms of animals [7,12-15], these parasites are
also clinically important in dogs (Ancylostoma braziliense,
Ancylostoma caninum, Ancylostoma ceylanicum and Uncinaria stenocephala), cats (Ancylostoma tubaeforme), ruminants
(Bunostomum
phlebotomum,
Bunostomum
trigonocephalum and Gaigeria pachyscelis), pigs (e.g., Globocephalus urosubulatus) and other hosts [16]. Hookworms
were originally thought to be host-specific [17,18]; however, the canine hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum, for
example, can infect humans and cause dermatitis and
eosinophilic enteritis [19], and some hookworm species,
such as the bovine hookworm, Bunostomum phlebotomum,
have been linked to cutaneous lesions in humans [20].
Significant genetic variation has been described among
individuals of Ancylostoma caninum from dogs in Australia
[21]. Such variation might reflect differences in host specificity, infectivity and/or pathogenicity among individual
nematodes within a population or, in some cases, might
be indicative of speciation events, as has been hypothesized previously for human hookworms [21,22]. Presently, there are no published studies of genetic variation
within and among populations of Bunostomum phlebotomum and no molecular data are publicly available for this
species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/79

The ability to accurately identify hookworms to species
and to assess genetic variability in hookworm populations
is central to studying their epidemiology as well as to diagnosis and control. Sequences of the first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1 and ITS-2) of nuclear
ribosomal DNA (rDNA) [23-25] and of cAMP-dependent
protein kinase [26] have been utilized to identify and differentiate hookworm species. However, the ITS-1 and ITS2 regions do not usually display sufficient within-species
sequence variability to enable the study of the genetic
structuring within and among hookworm populations
[24]. In contrast, mitochondrial (mt) genomes have been
shown to contain useful genetic markers for studying the
population structures of hookworm species [27-31],
because of their rapid mutation rates and apparent maternal inheritance [32-34]. Although the protein-coding mt
gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) is applicable
to population studies of a range of invertebrates, including parasitic platyhelminths [35,36] and some nematodes
[37,38], there are still limited sequence data for cox1 and
other mt genes of hookworms, and limited published
information is available on sequence heterogeneity
therein. Building on advances in long polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-based mt genome sequencing [39-41], the
present study determined the sequences and structures of
the two mt genomes from an individual of Ancylostoma
caninum (from a dog) from Australia and a specimen of
Bunostomum phlebotomum (from a calf) from South Africa.
The sequences derived for the mt genomes of these two
hookworms were compared in detail with mt genomic
data available for the predominant hookworms of
humans, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus
[42], as well as those available for other selected species
belonging to the orders Strongylida [41], Ascaridida [4345] and Spirurida [46-48].

Results and Discussion
Mitochondrial genome features, characteristics and gene
organization
The circular mt genomes of Ancylostoma caninum and
Bunostomum phlebotomum, sequenced from single adult
worms, were 13717 and 13790 bp in size, respectively
(Figure 1). Each genome contained 36 genes, including 12
protein coding genes (adenosine triphosphatase subunit
6 [atp6], the cytochrome c oxidase subunits [cox1-3], cytochrome b [cytb], and the nicotinamide dehydrogenase
subunits [nad1-6 and nad4l]), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA)
genes and 2 ribosomal RNA genes (small [rrnS] and large
[rrnL] subunits), and was consistent with gene arrangement 2 (GA2) [49]. This arrangement is characteristic for
the mt genomes of all members of the Strongylida and
Ascaridida, as well as the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Rhabditida), but not for Strongyloides stercoralis (Rhabditida) [41-49]. In accordance with other
species of Strongylida for which complete mt genome

and applied chemistry (IUPAC) code. The two leucine and

sequences are available [41,42], the AT-rich regions for
both Ancylostoma caninum and Bunostomum phlebotomum
were located between the genes nad5 and nad6, flanked at
the 5'-end by the tRNA gene for alanine, and at the 3'-end
by the tRNA genes for proline and alanine.
Each protein-coding gene for each of the two species had
an open reading frame (ORF), and all genes were located
on the same strand and transcribed in the same direction
(5' to 3'), consistent with the known mt genomes of secernentean nematodes [37]. The nucleotide usages (coding
strand) of A, C, G and T in each mt genome were 29.0%,
6.5%, 16.1% and 48.5%, respectively, for Ancylostoma
caninum (Table 1) and 26.9%, 6.2%, 16.7% and 50.1%,
respectively, for Bunostomum phlebotomum (Table 1), with
overall A+T contents of 77.5% and 77.0%, respectively.
The A+T content of protein coding genes ranged from
70.9% (cox1) to 81.3% (nad6) for Ancylostoma caninum,
and from 70.4% (cox1) to 82.6% (nad3) for Bunostomum

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/79

phlebotomum. The A+T content for rrnS, rrnL (= ribosomal
RNA genes) and the AT-rich region were 78.1%, 80.9%
and 90.1%, respectively, for Ancylostoma caninum, and
75.2%, 82.4% and 88.0%, respectively, for Bunostomum
phlebotomum. For the mt genome of Ancylostoma caninum,
codon usage in individual protein coding genes (n = 12)
ranged from 0% for CGC (arginine) and CCC (proline) to
15.7% for TTT (phenylalanine). For the mt genome of
Bunostomum phlebotomum, codon usage ranged from 0%
for CGC (arginine), CAC (histidine), CTC (leucine), CCC
(proline), TCC (serine) and GTC (valine) to 15.0% for
TTT (phenylalanine). For both species, individual tRNA
structures were consistent with those predicted previously
for hookworms and other secernentean nematodes
[37,42,45,50,51]. All tRNA genes, except trnS(AGN) and
trnS(UCN), had a predicted secondary structure containing a TV-replacement loop instead of the TψC arm and
loop (not shown). The predicted secondary structure of
each of the two serine tRNAs contained the TψC arm and
loop but lacked the DHU loop. The genes rrnS and rrnL
were 694 bp and 935 bp in length, respectively; the predicted secondary structures for the ribosomal RNA gene
subunits for Ancylostoma caninum and Bunostomum phlebotomum (not shown) were similar to those of Necator
americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale [42], which is also
supported by the high nucleotide sequence similarity in
the mt genes among these four hookworms (see Tables 2
and 3).
The AT-rich regions for Ancylostoma caninum and Bunostomum phlebotomum were 272 bp and 234 bp, respectively, and both exhibited complex secondary structures
(not shown), as predicted previously for the AT-rich
regions of nematodes [41,42,45,47,49]. Four AT-repeat
regions of variable length were identified in the AT-rich
region of the mt genome of Ancylostoma caninum: two
were 6 nucleotides (nt) (3 AT-repeats), one was 14 nt (7
AT-repeats) and the longest was 16 nt (8 AT-repeats). Similar dinucleotide repeats have been described in the ATrich region of the mt genomes of other nematode species
(e.g., [41,42,44]). Other repetitive elements have been
identified within this region in the free-living nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans, the largest and most conspicuous
of which are the repetitive sequence motifs CR1-CR6 [45].
However, no such elements were identified in the AT-rich
region of the mt genome of either Ancylostoma caninum,
Bunostomum phlebotomum or any other species of animal-parasitic nematode sequenced to date [41,44,47,49].
Comparative analyses with other nematodes
The identities (%) in inferred amino acid sequences of
each protein-coding mt gene were calculated based upon
pairwise comparisons between Ancylostoma caninum and
Bunostomum phlebotomum (Tables 2 and 3). Based on these
comparisons, the sequence identities (in decreasing

those inferred from published mt genomes of Anisakis

(Ascaridida), Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus
[42] and Haemonchus contortus [41] (Strongylida), and
Brugia malayi [46], Dirofilaria immitis [47] and Onchocerca

sequences among all species, assessed relative to Ancylostoma caninum and Bunostomum phlebotomum, were inferred
to be COX1, COX3 and NAD4L, and the least conserved
were NAD2 and NAD6 (see Tables 2 and 3).

With those published for species of Strongylida [Ancylostoma duodenale (Ad), Necator americanus (Na) and Haemonchus contortus (Hc)], species of
Ascaridida [Anisakis simplex (Ans), Ascaris suum (Ass) and Toxocara canis (Tc)] and species of Spirurida [Brugia malayi (Bm), Dirofilaria immitis (Di) and
Onchocerca volvulus (Ov)].

mt genome sequences for each species, previous work has
suggested that phylogenetic analyses for nematodes be
conducted using concatenated amino acid sequence datasets, utilizing sequences inferred from individual mt protein coding genes [47]. In order to further assess
systematic relationships within and among members of
the Ascaridida, Spirurida and Strongylida, a phylogenetic
analysis was carried out using Bayesian inference (BI) and
maximum likelihood (ML) (Figure 2). Almost all clades in
the consensus tree were supported by maximum BI posterior probability (pp) values (pp = 1.00; expressed as a percentage in Figure 2) and/or ML bootstrap support (100).
The phylogenetic analysis conducted herein clearly supports the distinct classification of the orders Ascaridida,
Spirurida and Strongylida, each as monophyletic clades
with maximum statistical support. The order Rhabditida
appears to be paraphyletic, with Caenorhabditis elegans
grouping closely with the Strongylida, and Steinernema
carpocapsae and Strongyloides stercoralis placed externally to
a clade comprising the Ascaridida, Strongylida and C. elegans. This relationship is consistent with the proposed
molecular phylogeny for the Nematoda based on small
subunit (18S) nuclear ribosomal DNA data [53]. In addition, the hookworms were represented as a monophyletic
clade within the Strongylida.
For hookworms, the phylogenetic analysis using BI indicated a closer relationship between Ancylostoma spp. and
Necator americanus than between either of them and
Bunostomum phlebotomum. This finding conflicts with the
current classification of the Strongylida [16], wherein
both Necator and Bunostomum are placed within the subfamily Bunostominae, whereas Ancylostoma is placed
within the subfamily Ancylostominae (poorly supported

by the ML analysis; bootstrap support = 47). A larger analysis, including mt data for more hookworm species, is
needed to test further this hypothesis.
The present phylogenetic analysis did not support the
grouping of the Ascaridida and Spirurida to the exclusion

of the Strongylida, which contrasts markedly the results of
a previous study based on nuclear ribosomal gene data
(e.g., clade III versus clade V; ref. [53]). The "common heritage" hypothesized herein for the Ascaridida and Strongylida to the exclusion of the Spirurida has been supported
by previous studies using mt gene order data [49] and
using concatenated amino acid sequence data inferred
from protein-coding mt genes [38]. These findings stimulate further study of the evolutionary relationships among
taxa within this phylum using mt datasets. The highthroughput sequencing potential of 454 technology [54]
and the recent validation of this technique for the
sequencing of mt genomes [41] should provide a platform for an in-depth analysis of the phylogeny of the
Nematoda.

Conclusion
Utility of mt gene markers for population genetic,
ecological and epidemiological studies of hookworms
Although some nuclear genetic regions (e.g., ITS-1 and
ITS-2 of nuclear rDNA [22-25] or the cAMP-dependent
protein kinase gene [26]) have been shown to be suitable
for the specific identification and differentiation of hookworms, the nuclear loci examined to date do not usually
display sufficient levels of intraspecific sequence variability for the investigation of the genetic structures of hookworm populations (or the identification of population
variants or "strains"). The ability to estimate genetic variability within and among hookworm populations is central to studying their epidemiology and population
genetics, and can have important practical implications in
relation to control.

Sequence-based analyses (including mutation scanning)
of protein-coding mt genes, such as cox1 and nad1, have
been particularly useful or population genetic studies
[21,27,29-31,55-59]. For example, Hu et al. [21]
employed a single-strand conformation polymorphism
(SSCP)-coupled sequencing approach to explore haplotypic variability within a limited number of Ancylostoma
caninum specimens from Australia and each of the human
hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus). Significant population sub-structuring was recorded
within each of these three species, and two genetically distinct subpopulations were detected within Ancylostoma
caninum from dogs from Townsville, Australia. Previous
morphological and clinical studies had shown that Ancylostoma caninum in Townsville (Australia) is not specific to
dogs and can also infect humans (but not complete its
life-cycle), causing eosinophilic enteritis [19]. It has been
speculated [21] that particular, genetically distinct subpopulations within Ancylostoma caninum can selectively
infect the non-canine host. The pattern of haplotypic variability within Ancylostoma caninum might be due to secondary contact between populations or subpopulations,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/79

which could have arisen due to host movement from
other geographical areas where this hookworm has been
recorded and where ecological conditions are distinct; for
example, Ancylostoma caninum is endemic in tropical
north-east Queensland, Australia [60], but also occurs in
the north-west area of Western Australia [61]. It is also
possible that feral dogs or dingoes (in different geographical or climatic regions) might harbour one or more
genetic variants which might "spill-over" into domestic
dogs and/or humans [60]. Future study of the genetic variation among Ancylostoma caninum specimens from
domestic and feral dogs, cats and humans as well as
between populations from other geographical and climatic regions in Australia and South-East Asia would
allow such questions to be addressed. A comparison of
the genetic make-up of Ancylostoma caninum from humans
affected by eosinophilic enteritis with those from domestic dogs in the Townsville area would be particularly interesting.
In contrast to Ancylostoma caninum, no studies have yet
explored the genetics or molecular epidemiology of
Bunostomum phlebotomum. Mitochondrial markers might
be used to examine sub-structuring in Bunostomum phlebotomum populations in endemic regions of South Africa.
In addition, although there has been anecdotal evidence
suggesting that Bunostomum phlebotomum may cause cutaneous larval migrans in humans ([20] and unpublished
observations [JVW]), the zoonotic potential of this species
of hookworm has not yet been tested molecularly. In view
of the lack of distinguishing morphological characters
allowing the identification of individual larvae, the provision of molecular markers for Bunostomum phlebotomum
might allow the extent of the zoonotic potential of this
species to be assessed for the first time.
The two mt genomes characterized herein provide a solid
foundation for studies of the epidemiology, ecology and
population genetics of both Ancylostoma caninum and
Bunostomum phlebotomum, which could have important
implications for the control of infections by these parasites. Given the lack of morphological characters for specific identification and differentiation of hookworm
larvae, there is a clear need for species and population
genetic markers for in-depth exploration of the epidemiology of hookworms [59]. Combined with the use of specific markers in the internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1 and
ITS-2) of nuclear rDNA [23-25], investigating the mt haplotypic variability in populations of Ancylostoma caninum
and Bunostomum phlebotomum (irrespective of developmental stage) could provide important insights into host
affiliations, gene flow and transmission patterns (cf.
[62,63]) and thus assist in the control of these hookworms. Furthermore, the direct sequencing of the mt
genome of Ancylostoma caninum by 454 technology is the

second example of the use of this approach for the
sequencing of mt genomes of nematodes [41] and reenforces the exciting potential of emerging technologies
for the high-throughput sequencing of relatively small
organellar genomes.

Methods
Parasites and DNA extraction
An adult male of Ancylostoma caninum (designated Ac1)
was collected (by IB) at necropsy from the duodenum of
a dog from Townsville, Australia [23]. An adult male of
Bunostomum phlebotomum (Bp1) was collected at autopsy
from the same site from a calf monospecifically infected
with an isolate of Bunostomum phlebotomum, originally
derived from a Jersey cow in Pretoria North suburb, South
Africa (by JvW). Nematodes were washed in physiological
saline, identified morphologically to species [16], fixed in
50% (v/v) ethanol and stored at -20°C until use. Total
genomic DNA was isolated from individual worms using
sodium dodecyl-sulphate/proteinase K treatment [64],
followed by spin-column purification (Wizard Clean-Up,
Promega). The specific identity of each nematode was verified using the sequence of the second internal transcribed
spacer (ITS-2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA, which provides
species-specific genetic markers for hookworms [25]. The
ITS-2 sequence derived from sample Ac1 was identical to
that reported previously for Ancylostoma caninum (accession number AJ001591) [25] and that obtained from Bp1
(accession number FJ616999) was 82.3% identical to the
closely related species Bunostomum trigonocephalum (accession number AJ001595) [25].
Long PCR-coupled mt genome sequencing
The complete mt genome of each Ancylostoma caninum
and Bunostomum phlebotomum was amplified as two overlapping amplicons (~10 kb and ~5 kb, respectively) from
~20–40 ng of the genomic DNA from each specimen by
long-PCR (BD Advantage 2, BD Biosciences) using each of
the primer pairs 39F-42R and 5F-40R [39,40,42], as
described by Hu et al. [39], with minor modifications. The
cycling conditions (2720 thermal cycler, Applied Biosystems) were: 92°C, 2 min (initial denaturation); then
92°C, 10 s (denaturation); 50°C, 30 s (annealing); 68°C
(for the ~10 kb region) or 60°C (for the ~5 kb region), 10
min (extension) for 10 cycles, followed by 92°C, 10 s;
50°C, 30 s; 68°C or 60°C, 10 min for 20 cycles, with an
elongation period of 10 s for each cycle, and a final extension at 68°C or 60°C for 7 min. Following the PCR, individual amplicons were resolved in ethidium bromidestained agarose (1%) gels and shown to represent single
bands. Amplicon size was estimated based on comparison
with a 1 kb DNA size ladder (Promega). Amplicons of ~10
kb or ~5 kb were purified over a mini-column (Wizard
PCR Preps, Promega). Subsequently, the amount of DNA
in each purified amplicon was estimated spectrophoto-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/79

metrically (ND-1000 UV-VIS spectrophotometer, v.3.2.1,
NanoDrop Technologies). The purified amplicons were
then subjected to sequencing.
The mt genome of Ancylostoma caninum (designated
AcMG-454; GenBank accession no. FJ483518) was
sequenced (454 technology by AJ/RBG) using a Genome
Sequencer 20 (Roche), according to an established protocol [54]. The complete mt genome of Bunostomum phlebotomum (designated BpMG-PW; GenBank accession no.
FJ483517) was sequenced (AW/DTL) by primer walking,
as described previously [44]. The AcMG-454 sequence was
assembled automatically, whereas that of BpMG-PW was
assembled manually using Sequencher v.4.8 (Gene Codes
Corporation). Both mt genome sequences were annotated
and subjected to analysis using standard approaches
[41,44], and their structures were compared with each
other and with those of the two human hookworms, Ancylostoma duodenale (GenBank accession number AJ417718;
ref. [42] and Necator americanus (AJ417719; ref. [42],
Haemonchus contortus (EU346694; ref. [41]) (Strongylida);
Anisakis simplex (AY994157; ref. [43], Ascaris suum
(X53453; ref. [45]), and Toxocara canis (EU730761; ref.
[44]) (Ascaridida); Brugia malayi (AF538716; ref. [46]),
Dirofilaria immitis (AJ537512; ref. [47]) and Onchocerca
volvulus (AF015193; ref. [48]) (Spirurida).
Phylogenetic analysis
The analysis of amino acid sequence data was conducted
via Bayesian inference (BI) using the software package
MrBayes v.3.1.2 http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/index.php
and maximum likelihood (ML) using GARLI ([65]; http:/
/www.bio.utexas.edu/faculty/antisense/garli/Garli.html),
each running on a four dual-core Opteron-based Unix
cluster. For individual species, the amino acid sequences
inferred from all protein coding mt genes were concatenated. A selection of published mermithid mt genomes
were used as outgroups (Strelkovimermis spiculatus, accession NC_008047; Agamermis sp., NC_008231; Thaumermis cosgrovei, NC_008046) and included a range of
ingroup taxa (Xiphinema americanum, NC_005928; Brugia
malayi, NC004298; Onchocerca volvulus, NC_001861;
Dirofilaria immitis, NC_005305; Strongyloides stercoralis,
NC_005143; Caenorhabditis elegans, NC_001328; Steinernema carpocapsae, NC_005941; Necator americanus,
NC_003416; Ancylostoma duodenale, NC_003415; Cooperia oncophora, NC_004806; Haemonchus contortus,
NC_010383; Anisakis simplex, NC_007934; Ascaris suum,
NC_003127; Toxocara canis, NC_010690). Amino acid
sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [66]. Ambiguous
sites were excluded using G-Blocks ([67,68]; see Additional File 1 for alignment).

For BI of amino acid data, tree construction and posterior
probabilities (pp) were calculated via 2000000 genera-

tions (ngen = 2000000) using the Metropolis-coupled
Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMCMC) method and
four simultaneous tree-building chains (nchains = 4),
with every 10th tree being saved (samplefreq = 10). A suitable burnin (burnin = 1000) was chosen using 'Trace' in
the program Tracer v1.4 http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/. Evolutionary distance was estimated using the most appropriate
amino acid model and calculated employing the MrBayes
program (aamodelpr = mixed), allowing for a gammashaped variation in mutation rates with a proportion of
invariable sites (rates = invgamma). Upon completion of
the analysis, a 50% majority rule = consensus tree was
constructed in TreeviewX v.0.5.0 http://darwin.zool
ogy.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/treeviewx/. For the ML analysis
using GARLI, tree construction was estimated with the
model GTR+I+g using the mtRev amino acid substitution
matrix, for two replicate runs, and termination criteria
with setting genthresholdfortopoterm = 20000 (no new
significantly better scoring topology found in > 20000
generations). Nodal support in the ML analysis was estimated by bootstrap re-sampling (n = 100) using GARLI
and the same model settings.
