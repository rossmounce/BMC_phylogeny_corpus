Functional bias in molecular evolution rate of
Arabidopsis thaliana

Abstract
Background: Characteristics derived from mutation and other mechanisms that are advantageous for survival are
often preserved during evolution by natural selection. Some genes are conserved in many organisms because they are
responsible for fundamental biological function, others are conserved for their unique functional characteristics.
Therefore one would expect the rate of molecular evolution for individual genes to be dependent on their biological
function. Whether this expectation holds for genes duplicated by whole genome duplication is not known.
Results: We empirically demonstrate here, using duplicated genes generated from the Arabidopsis thaliana αduplication event, that the rate of molecular evolution of genes duplicated in this event depend on biological function.
Using functional clustering based on gene ontology annotation of gene pairs, we show that some duplicated genes,
such as defense response genes, are under weaker purifying selection or under stronger diversifying selection than
other duplicated genes, such as protein translation genes, as measured by the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous
divergence (dN/dS).
Conclusions: These results provide empirical evidence indicating that molecular evolution rate for genes duplicated in
whole genome duplication, as measured by dN/dS, may depend on biological function, which we characterize using
gene ontology annotation. Furthermore, the general approach used here provides a framework for comparative
analysis of molecular evolution rate for genes based on their biological function.
Background
Gene duplication has been considered to be an important
process for creating novel gene function [1,2]. Duplicated
genes give organisms the opportunity to "experiment"
with mutations without losing the biological function of
the original gene because when one copy experiences a
deleterious mutation that destroys its function, the other
copy can still be functional. Beneficial mutations can be
retained due to the advantages they confer. Neutral mutations, such as most synonymous mutations, or some nonsynonymous mutations that do not alter gene function,
can also be retained. With accumulated mutations, the
pair of duplicate genes will diverge in sequence, and possibly function, over time. The amount of sequence divergence depends on (a) the natural mutation rate,
determined by environment condition, error correction
mechanism, GC content etc., and (b) the selective constraint due to a gene's biological function, i.e. biological

functions that are more likely to benefit from mutations
could be under diversifying selection whereas those that
are less likely to benefit from mutations could be under
purifying selection [3-10].
Gene sequence divergence can be measured by the
number of nonsynonymous mutations per site, dN, i.e
nucleotide substitutions that change the amino acid
encoded by the codon. However, in addition to selection
due to evolutionary pressure, other factors such as
expression level [11], guanine-cytosine (GC) content [12],
and location on the chromosome [13], have been found to
affect dN. To isolate the effect of selective constraint, dN
can be compared to the number of synonymous mutations per synonymous site, dS, i.e. nucleotide substitutions that do not change the amino acid encoded by a
given codon. dS is also affected by expression level, GC
content [14,15], and chromosomal location [16]. Because
synonymous changes do not change the amino acid, they
are often considered to be selectively neutral (although
evidence shows that synonymous changes can be weakly
selected [15]). Thus the ratio of nonsynonymous to syn-

onymous mutations, dN/dS, should measure the net
effect of selection on molecular evolution rate, assuming
the other factors equally affect synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations. A study by Williams and Hurst [13]
indicates that in some cases chromosome location may
not equally affect dN and dS.
Drummond et al. [11] indicated that expression level
has a larger effect on dN compared to dS. Duret et al. [17]
found that substitution rates differ significantly by tissue
in mammals.
Previous work in plants reveal that rates of nonsynonymous substitutions were negatively correlated with GC
content at synonymous third codon positions, and synonymous substitution rates were negatively correlated with
codon bias, similar to what has been found in the animal
system [18]. Moreover, a study of 83 genes in Arabidopsis
thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata has shown a significant
negative correlation between the rates of nonsynonymous substitutions and gene expression level [15]. Ganko
et al. [19] found that average expression level and breadth
of expression tend to decline with dN in duplicated genes
of Arabidopsis but do not have a significant correlation
with dS. Furthermore, it has been well documented that
some functional classes of genes have distinct expression
levels [20]. However, there has not been a large-scale
study on how variations in selective constraint are
reflected in gene functions. In this work we use the genes
from the Arabidopsis thaliana gene duplication events of
20-60 MYA [21,22], i.e. the α-duplication event, as a
benchmark to investigate the effect of biological function
on molecular evolution rate of the duplicated genes.
Using a single genome duplication event eliminates variations in divergence rates due to factors such as population
size that may be different for different organisms.
A whole genome duplication event in an ancestral species creates many paralogs. Some of these genes may be
discarded over time. There is evidence for a functional
bias for those paralogs that are retained [6]. Those that
are retained tend to be functionally redundant and take
advantage of the dosage effect or have functional divergence through neo- and subfunctionalization. However,
"the incidence of functional divergence among duplicated
genes is difficult to quantify" [23]. The objective of this
study is to empirically examine the relationship between
biological function and the rate of sequence divergence
after a duplication event. To this end we have employed
Gene Ontology (GO) annotations in our analysis to
describe the common biological role of a paralogous pair.
Because many of the duplicated genes are also experimentally characterized in the TAIR gene ontology (GO)
dataset [24], it may be possible to discern properties of
evolutionary rates based on GO categories.

Methods
We used the Bowers et al. [22] dataset for the A. thaliana
whole genome α-duplication event, which based on estimation, occurred before the divergence of Arabidopsis
thaliana from Brassica but after its divergence from the
Malvaceae.
To ensure the quality of the analysis we screened GO
annotations from the TAIR dataset based on their evidence codes. We removed those pairs from the analysis
set if at least one gene in a pair did not have an annotation
that was curated or experimentally assigned. If either
gene in a gene pair was not annotated experimentally or
by curator, the pair was excluded from the analysis. In
order to make a direct link between function and the
molecular evolution rate we labeled each pair with only
their most specific shared functions from GO terms. We
also required that these shared functions were at a depth
of one or greater (assuming the nodes "Biological Process", "Cellular Component", and "Molecular Function"
have a depth of zero). An example is shown in Figure 1.
Here we define the depth of a term to be the minimum
distance over all paths from the root to that term's node.
GO annotations were obtained from TAIR on June 4,
2009.
To assess the overall effect of gene function on
sequence divergence, we placed genes into functional
groups. The objective in creating these groups can be
defined as follows. For any two gene pairs the more specific their shared role in the cell the tighter their subsequent grouping. To do this we used the GOSim package
[25] to cluster genes based on their functional profile.

Figure 1 Shared Function Combination. The following example
demonstrates how GO annotations for two genes in a pair might be
combined. If gene1 has GO function of organelle envelope, and gene2
intracellular membrane-bound organelle (green terms), their shared
functions would be membrane-bound organelle and intracellular organelle (red terms). Edges marked with 'P' and 'I' stand represent the
"part of" and "is a" arcs of GO respectively.

IC(t ) ,

where

Pa(t, t') denotes the term set of all common ancestors of
GO terms t and t', and IC(t) is the information content of
term t as defined by Lord et al. [27]. These similarities
were combined using the "optimal assignment" method
by Frohlich et al. [28] to give coefficients, for all pairwise
combinations of gene pairs, that indicate the functional
similarity of selected pairs. The optimal assignment
method assigns each term of the gene with fewer annotations to exactly one term of the other gene, such that the
sum of term-term similarities is maximized. Based on
these coefficients, Ward's hierarchical clustering algorithm [29] was used to group genes together with similar
functional profiles. The resulting hierarchical tree was
cut using a bottom up approach such that each group
meets a minimum size constraint of ≥ 20. In order to
maintain good functional specificity for shared functions,
without reducing the population of the resulting groups
to a trivial number, groups were defined by the lowest
internal node that achieved the minimum size threshold.
For Ward's clustering algorithm the height corresponds
to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) sum of squares difference between two clusters added up over all the variables within those clusters.
The protein and DNA sequences were obtained from
The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) database
on February 20, 2008 [30]. We aligned the protein
sequences for duplicate gene pairs using the needle program, with default parameters. The program implements
the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm [31].
We then aligned the DNA sequences for duplicated gene
pairs according to the aligned protein sequences using
the PAL2NAL program [32]. Last, to calculate dN/dS for
duplicate gene pairs, we use the yn00 with default parameters within the Phylogenetic Analysis of Maximum Likelihood (PAML) program [33]. yn00 implements the
method of Yang and Nielsen [34] which calculates dN/dS
taking into account transition/transversion rate biases
and base/codon frequency biases.
To evaluate statistical correlation between dN/dS and
functional groups we used the analysis of variance
(ANOVA) method [35]. ANOVA uses Fisher's F-test to
determine statistical significance of variance in group
means compared to the mean for a group. The resulting
p-value determines if the null hypotheses, that mean dN/
dS values are equivalent for all functional groups, should
be rejected. To identify the specific groups that are signif-

icantly different, we used Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) criteria which is based on Studentized
range distribution for determining critical values [36].
To characterize specific functional groups we examine
the group's relative enrichment of GO annotation for
genes in the group compared to all the genes in the αduplication event. For this purpose we use the Ontologizer software's parent-child union method with Bonferroni correction [37].

Results
There are a total of 3822 duplicated gene pairs from the α
duplication event. After removing the gene pairs that
only have electronic annotation of GO terms, we had
2728 duplicated gene pairs. Then after removing the gene
pairs that have shared gene function that is at depth 1, we
were finally left with 2683 duplicated gene pairs.
The distribution of dN/dS values for the 2728 duplicated gene pairs is shown in Figure 2. The dN/dS values
range from 0 to 0.8, but most of the gene pairs have dN/
dS values less than 0.5, and 86% have dN/dS < 0.3, suggesting that most of the duplicated gene pairs were under
purifying selection. No gene pairs have dN/dS > 1, thus
there is no indication of strong positive selection in these
recently duplicated genes.
The gene pairs were separated into functional groups
using the clustering method as described in the Methods
section above. All gene pairs were grouped based on each
of the three GO categories resulting in three sets of
groups: 40 groups for biological process, 48 groups for
molecular function, and 26 groups for cellular compo-

nent. The analysis of variance method was then used to
determine if there is a dependence between dN/dS and
functional groups of gene pairs. Results of the analysis,
which are summarized in Table 1, show a p-value < 10-16
for all three groupings.
This indicated a strong difference between mean dN/dS
for groups based on biological function as represented by
the three GO categories. Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5
show the groups of duplicated gene pairs, their mean dN/
dS values and the 95% confidence intervals for the means
based on Tukey's HSD test. There are differences
between the distribution of dN/dS values across different
groups. The groups that are most different for each of the
three sets of groupings, biological process, molecular
function and cellular process are highlighted in the figures.
We performed functional enrichment analysis to identify the primary biological function (GO term) representing each of the groups. The top three GO terms from the
enrichment analysis for all the groups and visualizations
of enrichments for the examples mentioned here are provided in Additional file 1. Figure 3 shows that molecular
function group 27 and group 28 genes have a sharp contrast in dN/dS values. Group 27 is enriched with genes
that are structural constituent of ribosome (GO:0003735,
p-value = 2.11E-240). In contrast, group 28 is enriched
with genes that have the molecular function of, enzyme
inhibitor activity (GO:0004857, p-value = 1.44E-079) and
pectinesterase inhibitor activity (GO:0046910, p-value =

3.42E-074). We noticed that group 29 also has a relatively
high mean dN/dS, and is enriched with genes with signal
transducer activity (GO:0060089, p-value = 1.72E-039)
and activation of innate immune response (GO:0002218,
p-value = 1.26E-005), which seems to be consistent with
the fact that immune related genes tend to evolve fast.
Group 25 also has elevated dN/dS values and is enriched
for lipid binding (GO:0008289, p-value = 1.35E-078). An
ontology enrichment figure for these groups can be found
in Additional file 2.
Figure 4 shows that groups 1, 15 and 24 genes have a
sharp contrast in dN/dS values. Group 1's slowly-evolving
genes are enriched with functions involved in the cellular
macromolecule biosynthetic process (GO:0034645, pvalue = 1.70E-078). In contrast, group 15 has elevated
dN/dS values and is enriched with genes involved in lipid
transport (GO:0006869, p-value = 1.62E-093). All but one
pair of genes from this group are members of Group 25
(enriched for lipid binding) from the molecular function
analysis. The other group with high dN/dS values, Group
24, has genes involved in defense response (GO:0006952,
p-value = 6.48E-047), response to stimulus (GO:0050896,
p-value = 3.11E-022), and activation of immune response
(GO:0002253, p-value = 7.31E-004). An ontology enrichment figure for these groups can be found in Additional
file 3.
Figure 5 shows that group 2 and group 20 genes have a
sharp contrast in dN/dS values. Analysis of functional
enrichment in these groups shows that group 2 is

20 is enriched with genes whose protein products are
anchored to membrane (GO:0031225, p-value = 7.67E94). Group 14 has a high dN/dS value and is significantly
enriched for genes whose products are contained in the
nucleus (GO:0005634, p-value = 1.32E-107). Further
analysis of this group with respect to molecular function
shows enrichment for genes involved in transcription
regulator activity (GO:0030528, p-value = 2.53E-265).
Two other groups with genes having high dN/dS, groups
23 and 25, are enriched with genes that are components
of endomembrane system. Out of the 872 genes found to
be annoated with endomembrane system in the α-duplicated genes, 623 were found to be in groups 23 and 25.
An ontology enrichment figure for these groups can be
found in Additional file 4.

Discussion
When making predictions about evolution, a frequent
caveat is that the results are given under the assumption
that the genes/proteins involved evolve at some constant
rate defined as a parameter in the model. Bos and Pasada

[38] have suggested fitting the model to the genes being
used to obtain more accurate results. Why not then also
adjust the rate at which the genes are assumed to evolve
based on selective pressure? We are not aware of any data
that exists which defines, in broad fashion, the tendency
of genes to diverge at a certain rate based on its functional characteristics. Perhaps the most similar study to
that done here, Blanc and Wolfe [23] investigate a similar
but distinct issue by comparing the divergence of paralogous pairs to an outgroup protein. They found a statistically significant divergence rate for 173 out of the 833
paralogous pairs analyzed. However, their analysis was
conditioned on the choice of an appropriate outgroup
protein. They investigated functional enrichment for
duplicated pairs where one gene diverges faster than the
other in comparison to an outgroup protein, i.e., "asymmetric divergence". In their work the aim is to evaluate
the probability that "the two duplicated protein
sequences evolve at the same rate." In this work we are
looking for significant differences in the average dN/dS
ratio for groups that have been clustered according to
their functional profiles and use only the differences
between two α-duplicated genes.

Figure 4 Biological Process Means. Tukey's HSD test for dN/dS as a function of functional grouping based on biological process (BP). A list of all the
groups is included in the supplementary material along with the name of the top three GO terms representing each group. The 95% confidence intervals for group means are indicated by vertical lines. The horizontal lines are used to visually identify groups with extreme mean dN/dS values (red
vertical lines). Results show that genes representing "lipid transport" (group 15), and "defense response" (group 24) have significantly higher dN/dS
values on average, while "cellular macromolecule biosynthesis" (group 1) have significantly lower dN/dS values.

The analysis we employ presents compelling evidence
for functional bias in molecular evolution rate of duplicated genes arising from the Arabidopsis α duplication
event. However, it is possible that there is another cause
for the differences in dN/dS, or that some of the conditions imposed in our analysis has inadvertently biased the
results. To try and account for some of these possibilities
we examine the effect of chromosome location, combining multiple and single duplicates, and the clustering
parameters for defining functional groups.
Effect of chromosomal location

A recent study has shown that genes from the same functional classes tend to cluster together on the chromosomes in Arabidopsis thaliana [39]. Also, gene expression
is highly correlated between neighboring genes on a
chromosome in Arabidopsis thaliana [40]. In addition,
the distribution of tandemly arrayed genes appears to be
positively correlated with recombination rates in both
Arabidopsis thaliana [41] and rice [42]. Here we exam-

ined whether the rate of evolution in duplicated genes
generated from the α duplication event in Arabidopsis is
a function of chromosome location. The chromosome
location can be calculated as the distance, in base pairs
(bp) from the centromere to the midpoint of the gene.
The correlation coefficient between dN/dS and chromosome location is 0.006 (p-value = 0.7) indicating that for
the dataset used here, distance from the centromere is
not the cause of variations in dN/dS values. Chromosomal location of duplicated gene pairs are shown in
Additional file 5.
Effect of combining multiple and single duplicates

The Arabidopsis thaliana α-duplication dataset contains
a number of genes that have more than one duplicate due
to subsequent gene duplications. We refer to these genes
as multiple duplicates and refer to the genes that do not
have additional duplications following α-duplication as
single duplicates. Analysis of variance between dN/dS
and multiple/single duplicates has a p-value of < 10-16

higher dN/dS values on average, while "cytosolic ribosome" (group 2) genes have significantly lower dN/dS values.

indicating that copy number does influence the rate of
divergence for multiple/single duplicates. A two-way
analysis of variance between dN/dS and both functional
groups and multiple/single duplicates also has a p-value
of < 10-16 indicating that there is an interdependence
between functional groups and multiple/single duplicates. Furthermore, an analysis of variance excluding
genes with multiple duplicates does identify protein
translation genes as having a significantly lower dN/dS
value, but does not contain a sufficient number defense
response genes to establish a functional group. Most (22
of the 27) defense response pairs have genes with multiple duplicates while few (7 of the 53) protein translation
pairs have genes with multiple duplicates. This analysis
shows that genes with multiple duplicates tend to diverge
at a faster rate (i.e. high dN/dS) than other genes. A figure
illustrating this difference can be found in Additional file
6. As there is no reason to believe that some genes duplicate more frequently than others, the duplicates for
defense response genes must be retained more frequently

than others. This is what one would expect if there were
weaker negative selection against mutations in the
defense response genes, stronger selective pressure and
constraints on mutations in protein translation genes.
This is further evidence that natural selection favors
more variation in defense response genes, while variation
in translation genes are selected against, probably to
maintain this fundamental biological function. Our
observation that multiple copy genes tend to evolve faster
find both support and contradict previous studies. For
example, Scannell and Wolfe [43] studied duplicated
genes resulting from the whole genome in yeast and
found that duplicated genes tend to evolve much faster
than single copy genes (i.e. singletons). However, counter
examples also exist. Jordan et al. [44] found that duplicated genes in several pairs of species such as humanmouse, fly-mosquito, and yeast-C. albicans, on average,
evolved slower than singletons. It is not clear what causes
the contradictory observations.

Effect of clustering parameters

Changing the clustering method or parameters will
change the composition of functional groups. We tested a
number of alternative clustering parameters to determine
the effect on our results. For the alternative parameters
tested, the ANOVA results showed p-values of < 10-6
indicating a strong correlation between dN/dS and functional groups. For example, using a fixed cluster cutoff
height of 0.1 for biological process results in 36 groups,
whereas using a cutoff height of 0.001 results in 222
groups. The corresponding p-values are < 10-16 and < 10-6
for the analysis of variance for dN/dS by group. Interestingly, the number of pairs in the "defense response" group
does not change and the number of pairs in "protein
translation" group changes a little from 53 to 45. This
indicates that the results are robust with respect to different clustering parameters.

Conclusions
This analysis provided empirical evidence for functional
bias in molecular evolution rate of genes duplicated by
whole genome duplication in Arabidopsis. Furthermore,
it identified specific functional groups that are likely to
have significantly higher or lower molecular evolution
rates. For example we found that defense response genes
are highly variable while protein translation genes are
highly conserved.
Intuitively, these findings are not surprising. Defense
response genes should be highly variable to be able to
respond to changing environmental conditions, and protein translation genes should be highly conserved since
any change would effect all biological functions. Previous
studies have shown that the molecular evolution in individual disease defense genes were subject to diversifying
selection [45]. It has also been shown that the molecular
evolution rate for some ribosomal proteins, which are
responsible for protein translation, is slower than that of
other known cellular proteins [46]. The fact that these
well known patterns emerge from our functional clustering strongly indicate that the method proposed here is a
viable one for investigating the relative divergence rates
for genes based on their role in the cell, as described by
the Gene Ontology. Besides providing independent support to previous findings, our study revealed additional
groups of genes such as the ones involved in the endomembrane system in the α-duplication event that can be
potentially interesting for future empirical studies.
Future work

Although our results are statistically significant, some
additional analysis would define the extent to which function impacts divergence rate in duplicated genes. Further
examination of the effect of GC content, protein

domains, expression level and gene relocation, would
clarify the relation between functional bias and other factors that correlate with divergence rate. Comparison to
an outgroup and extending the analysis to another organism such as yeast, will provide supporting evidence and
generalize the results to other organisms. It is well known
that different functional classes of genes have different
levels of expression and that expression has been shown
to correlate negatively with nonsynonymous substitutions. A study of how expression level and breadth of
expression manifests itself in various functional groups,
relative to divergence rate, holds potential for future
work.
There are also some refinements to the methods used
here that should be considered for future studies. First is
to devise a method to combine the three Ontology similarities computed for pairs in GOSim clustering. This
should increase the resolution of the groups with respect
to their role in the cell and would require only one functional enrichment analysis across all three ontologies,
biological process, molecular function and cellular function. Second is to repeat functional clustering with only
evidence code filtering, not shared function filtering. This
will increase the number of pairs that remain and may
find additional emergent functional properties. Finally,
consider clustering by GO annotation for individual
genes instead of the common annotation for gene pairs.
This would produce a more enriched grouping which
may provide better insight into the reasons for differences
in dN/dS values.

Additional material
Additional file 1 Supplement 1. This spreadsheet provides the top 3
enriched terms for all groups and their Bonferroni corrected p-values from
each clustering. It also provides information on the group members of each
cluster, cluster size, and group height in the hierarchical clustering tree.
Additional file 2 Supplement 2. Enrichment for Molecular Function:
Functional enrichment for molecular function groups 27 (panel A) and 28
(panel B), shows that the groups are highly enriched for structural constituent of ribosome, and enzyme inhibitor activity genes, respectively. For each
enrichment figure the left fraction corresponds to the number of genes in
the α-duplication event with the specific function and the right fraction
corresponds to the number of genes with a function in the current group.
Additional file 3 Supplement 3. Functional enrichment for biological
process groups 1, 15, and 24 (panels A, B, and C) shows that the groups are
highly enriched for translation, lipid transport, and defense response genes,
respectively.
Additional file 4 Supplement 4. Functional enrichment for cellular component groups 2 (panel A) and 20 (panel B), shows that the groups are
highly enriched for cytosolic ribosome, and anchored to membrane genes,
respectively.
Additional file 5 Supplement 5. Chromosomal location of duplicated
gene pairs in the analysis. The five chromosomes are shown as black bars
with the centromeres depicted as blue dots. Duplicated genes are linked by
different colored lines depending on the chromosomes that the duplicates
reside on. Only inter-chromosome duplicates are shown.
