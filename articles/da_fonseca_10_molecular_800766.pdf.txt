stress in the expansion and functional
diversification of cytosolic glutathione
transferases

Abstract
Background: Cytosolic glutathione transferases (cGST) are a large group of ubiquitous enzymes involved in
detoxification and are well known for their undesired side effects during chemotherapy. In this work we have
performed thorough phylogenetic analyses to understand the various aspects of the evolution and functional
diversification of cGSTs. Furthermore, we assessed plausible correlations between gene duplication and substrate
specificity of gene paralogs in humans and selected species, notably in mammalian enzymes and their natural
substrates.
Results: We present a molecular phylogeny of cytosolic GSTs that shows that several classes of cGSTs are more
ubiquitous and thus have an older ancestry than previously thought. Furthermore, we found that positive selection
is implicated in the diversification of cGSTs. The number of duplicate genes per class is generally higher for groups
of enzymes that metabolize products of oxidative damage.
Conclusions: 1) Protection against oxidative stress seems to be the major driver of positive selection in
mammalian cGSTs, explaining the overall expansion pattern of this subfamily;
2) Given the functional redundancy of GSTs that metabolize xenobiotic chemicals, we would expect the loss of
gene duplicates, but by contrast we observed a gene expansion of this family, which likely has been favored by:
i) the diversification of endogenous substrates; ii) differential tissue expression; and iii) increased specificity for a
particular molecule;
3) The increased availability of sequence data from diversified taxa is likely to continue to improve our understanding of the early origin of the different cGST classes.

Background
Glutathione transferases (GSTs; EC 2.5.1.18) comprise a
superfamily of genes encoding ubiquitous enzymes that
are very important in the clinical outcome of cancer
therapy because they metabolize and inactivate cancer
agents (in particular four classes of GST, alpha, mu, pi
and theta) [1,2]. Furthermore, the interaction of GSTs
with pesticides and pollutants makes them an interesting
target for protein engineering in plants [3]. The general
role of GSTs in detoxification and the metabolism of

xenobiotics has been well documented (reviewed in
[3-7]), and makes GSTs a promising subject for evolutionary analyses, especially considering temporal fluctuations in toxic chemicals in the environment.
GSTs are an excellent example of how multiple gene
duplication events involving further sub- or neofunctionalization has resulted in groups of enzymes with a
myriad of functions. Their occurrence either as homodimers or heterodimers further increases the diversity of
the GSTs catalytic activities, which are all centered on
chemical reactions that use the tripeptide glutathione
(GSH). GSTs are involved in metabolic detoxification of
reactive electrophiles, the biosynthesis of leukotrienes,
prostaglandins, testosterone and progesterone, and in

the degradation of tyrosine [3,5]. Furthermore, some
GSTs have also been attributed non-enzymatic regulatory roles [8,9].
The expression of GSTs can be regulated by different
stresses (e.g. variation in temperature, oxidative damage,
and exposure to toxins) and cGSTs promoters contain
antioxidant response elements [3]. This suggests that
GSTs could be part of an adaptive response to cellular
stress [5,10]. GSH is a scavenger of reactive oxygen species and GSTs are part of the cell machinery responsible
for metabolizing by-products of oxidative stress [5].
Indeed, soluble GSTs have been detected in the mitochondria, where they are thought to play an important
role in protection against the effects of reactive oxygen
species produced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain
[11]. However, this protection can also occur when
there are cells that are too damaged and should be
eliminated, leading to cancer and other diseases [12].
Likewise, a number of GST polymorphisms have been
implicated in tumor resistance to chemotherapy [13],
and in a number of diseases (Table 1).
GSTs also have noncatalytic roles that include binding
(covalently and noncovalently) dangerous chemicals and
biomolecules such as bilirubin and hormones [5,14].
Binding to reactive electrophiles is thought to be important for preventing DNA damage whereas for other
molecules GSTs act as intracellular carriers [5,14].
Cytosolic GSTs (cGSTs) are by far the most abundant
GST subfamily and can be found in all aerobic organisms [3]. They are actively involved in the detoxification
of generally nonpolar compounds that contain an electrophilic carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur atom [5]. cGSTs are
divided into several classes, the most ubiquitous being
alpha (GSTA), mu (GSTM), pi (GSTP), sigma (GSTS),
omega (GSTO), zeta (GSTZ) and theta (GSTT) (see
Table 2 for the occurrence of these classes in various
taxa). These are also the only classes present in mammals. Additional classes are specific to plants (phi and
tau), fish (rho), insects (delta and epsilon), and bacteria
(beta) [6,15]. The number of isoforms per class varies
widely, ranging from one to forty [3].
In this work, we used Bayesian and maximum likelihood-based molecular phylogenetics approaches to

ascertain the overall evolutionary pattern in cGSTs. We
then focused on mammalian cGSTS and their natural
substrates in order to determine if the role of GSTs in
detoxification is the major force driving the expansion
of this gene family, as it has been suggested [3,5]. More
than 20 mammalian cGSTs have been identified to date,
many metabolizing the same substrates, especially those
substrates of anthropomorphic origin. This catalytic promiscuity probably enhances the formation of duplicates,
increasing the probability that duplicated genes become
fixed in a population, as adaptation will promote reactions that are already catalyzed by the enzyme [16]. We
therefore tested available sequence data for the existence
of positive selection using both gene and protein based
statistical approaches. Although positive selection has
been mostly detected in genes involved in host-pathogen
interactions, it has also been shown to influence the
active site of enzymes and protein-protein interfaces in
membrane receptors [17-19]. The gene-based approach
is based on the idea that nonsynonymous substitutions
may influence the fitness of an individual or population.
Thus, adaptive molecular evolution may cause the nonsynonymous substitution rate (dN) to be higher than
the synonymous rate (dS), with the ratio ω (dN/dS)
being higher than 1 [20]. Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs)
implemented in PAML were used to identify genes
under positive selection (ω >1) by comparing two probabilistic models of variable ω ratios among sites, the
simpler of which does not allow sites with ω >1 and a
more general which does [21]. ConTest was used to
measure evolutionary rates in protein sequences
accounting for the variation of specific biochemical
properties, like volume, polarity and charge [22]. Finally,
we intertwined the results from the evolutionary analyzes with information regarding the functions of the
different classes of cGSTs, and concluded that the activity of cGSTs on endogenous substrates is sufficient to
explain the overall expansion pattern of this subfamily.

Results & Discussion
Structure conservation

Within specific GST classes, amino acid sequence identity between paralogues is typically >40%, whereas
among classes it can be less than 25% (Table 3 in Additional file 1). cGSTs are characterized by two domains,
each containing an active site. The N-terminal domain
adopts a thioredoxin-like fold (bababba) that is mostly
responsible for binding GSH and the C-terminal domain
contains varying numbers of a-helices and encloses the
substrate-binding domain (Figure 1). Active cGSTs are
either assembled as homodimers or heterodimers
formed between elements of the same class (Figure 1B).
The N-terminal domain contains residues that are critical for activation of the sulfhydryl group of GSH. Its
structure is quite conserved when compared to the

substrate binding C-terminal domain (Figure 1C). Conservation in the C-terminal domain is apparent between
the elements of the more recently evolved and closely
related classes (alpha, mu, pi and sigma), which is in
line with their overlapping substrates specificities.
Phylogeny

Given the high sequence divergence within cytosolic
GSTs (Table 3 in Additional file 1), building an accurate
phylogenetic tree including representatives of all GST
gene classes is challenging, and inferences based on these
trees should be done cautiously. Since cGSTs protein
structure is quite conserved, we have overcome the problems of nucleotide homoplasy by using the structural
information when building sequence alignments for
cGSTs from multiple classes, which increased confidence

in the phylogenetic analyses relative to previous studies
(see [6,23] and references therein). The phylogenetic relationship among the cGST classes in mammals is shown
in Figure 2. Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood
approaches result in the same overall clade topology (Figure 2A in Additional file 1). Orthology and parology are
difficult to assess for genes in classes alpha and mu
where duplication events were very profuse. The phylogenetic relationships within classes that have a single isoform (pi, sigma and zeta) are incongruent with known
phylogenetic relationships, namely for muridae GSTs
(Figure 2) [24]. Muridae are also the mammals with the
highest number of GST isoforms, another indication that

GSTs might have followed an independent evolutionary
path in this group. The phylogenetic relationship among
the cGST classes in a wide variety of taxa is shown in
Figure 3, where we can see a perfect correspondence
with the currently accepted phylogeny of species at the
animal class level (mammals, amphibians, insects, etc).
Theta, zeta and omega cGSTs are generally considered to
be the most ancestral, and are found in a wide variety of
organisms (Table 2) [3]. However this has been difficult
to prove (Figure 3) [3,6]. The omega class are a good
choice because they use a cysteine residue to activate
GSH (Figure 1A) similarly to glutaredoxins, which are
the suggested ancestors of the N-terminal domain of

cGSTs [25]. Class theta has been previously appointed as
the root of the GST tree mainly because a lot of
sequences were initially allocated to this class, and it
seemed to be the class represented by the largest diversity
of organisms (Table 2). However, this pattern could have
been biased in a scenario where some of the classes were
lost during evolution because they became nonessential

in some species. The fact that class theta is involved in
the metabolism of products of oxidative damage could
have made it more essential than the other two ancient
classes, omega and zeta. The emergence of new genes
could also have lead to species-specific redundancy and
the elimination of elements of a GST class. Another possibility is that these genes have not been yet detected in

da Fonseca et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:281

certain taxa because of lack of sampling, since more and
more GST genes are being detected in newly sequenced
genomes. In fact classes alpha and sigma were thought
until recently to be only present in metazoans [3,23], but
our BLAST searches have successfully retrieved bacterial
homologous genes (Figure 3), revealing that the increasing amount of available sequence data is still shaping our
knowledge on the evolution of cGSTs. We actually found
bacterial homologs for nearly all GST classes (Figure 3),
which again shows how GSTs are more ubiquitous than
first thought. Even though hypothetical events of horizontal gene-transfer from metazoan to bacteria species are
possible, we suggest that these bacterial cGSTs sequences
indeed have an ancient origin because: i) there is a deep
divergence among bacterial GST sequences (Figure 3), ii)
the corresponding organisms inhabit distinct habitats
(Table 3), and that iii) these bacteria are phylogenetically
divergent (e.g. cyanobacteria vs protobacteria, divergence
time over 2 billion years ago [26]; see Figure 1 in Additional file 1).
The cGSTs phylogenetic tree is supported by two fundamental changes in the chemistry of GSTs involving a
conserved residue before the third b strand that provides the mainchain hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors for GSH. This residue changes (1) from a cysteine
to a serine, and then (2) from a serine to a tyrosine (Figure 1A). This residue activates GSH during catalysis.
Classes alpha and mu, which use a tyrosine in the active
site, present the higher number of successful duplicates,
with up to seven isoforms per species. It is precisely
within these classes that we can find extensive signatures of positive selection (Table 4). In the next section
we will discuss the functional diversification of mammalian cGSTs considering the relevance of their natural
substrates. Also noteworthy is the strong agreement
between the phylogenetic tree of the mammalian classes
and the tree based on the root mean square deviation
(RMSD) between the corresponding structures of the
ligand binding domain (Figure 1C).
Functional diversification and asymmetrical family
expansion

The GSTs family has expanded through multiple duplications [3,5]. The fact that GST enzymes accumulate
multiple roles, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic, facilitates the process of neofunctionalization by optimization of what was a secondary function [16]. This is
obvious for omega cGSTs, where the inference of
orthology is pretty straightforward. We suggest that the
ancestral enzyme had as a main function the regeneration of ascorbate (the main reaction catalyzed by
GSTO2 [27]), since we find that GSTO1 is under positive selection (Table 5). The duplicate has then diverged
from this initial function, and optimized what was a

secondary reaction in the ancestral enzyme, the metabolism of arsenic. We expect this pattern to be general in
GSTs: duplicates sometimes retain the previous main
function but are optimized for a new one (e.g. both
GSTOs are involved in the metabolism of arsenic and
ascorbate, but GSTO1 is better in metabolizing arsenic
and GSTO2 has an activity 70-100 times greater than
GSTO1 towards ascorbate [27]).
The expansion of the cGSTs was particularly profuse,
but as we can see in mammals, not all the resulting
classes of enzymes have duplicated extensively. For
example, sigma and zeta cGSTs are involved in pathways that require a more precise regulation, and for
which the existence of a duplicate could have been
harmful. GSTZ is a key enzyme in the metabolic degradation of phenylalanine and tyrosine and its product can
cause the fatal hereditary disease tyrosinemia type I [28].
GSTS produces prostaglandin D2 [29] (prostaglandins
are lipid mediators that are involved in the regulation of
the respiratory, cardiovascular, central nervous system
(CNS), genitourinary, endocrine, and immune systems).
In contrast, alpha, mu and theta cGSTs are all involved
in the cellular reaction under stress conditions, and
have multiple duplicates (up to seven, five and four
duplicates for alpha, mu and theta classes, respectively,

compared to only one isoform in e.g. sigma and zeta
classes) that probably contributed to an increase in fitness by the elimination of a broader range of reactive
and harmful chemicals, especially through variation in
the substrate binding pocket. Changes of a hypervariable
site in this region have been shown to have a central
role in defining enzyme specificity [30]. Our hypothesis
is thus supported by evidence of several positively
selected sites in the substrate binding pocket (Table 5).
The catalytic promiscuity of GSTs has certainly facilitated the process of neofunctionalization and duplicate
gene retention for the most populated cGST classes. We
further suggest that subsequent loss of duplicates arising
from functional redundancy was probably avoided by
variation in tissue expression (e.g. human GSTA3 is
expressed solely in steroidogenic tissues and GSTM3 is
selectively expressed in testis and brain [31]) and
increased specificity for a particular molecule (such as
GSTO1 that has an improved efficiency in metabolizing
arsenic, see above).

Conclusions
Glutathione transferases enzymes represent a superfamily with many functional roles throughout evolution.
This work has revealed that cGSTs are a lot more

ubiquitous and old than previously thought, with many
cGSTs classes having a bacterial isoform. The need for
protection against the products of oxidative damage has
no doubt driven the expansion of the family via positive
selection on GST duplicates, but on the way GSTs have
acquired many other roles such as the metabolism of
sex hormones and the regulation of apoptosis, which
likely were vital for the retention of duplicates. The
metabolism of dangerous xenobiotics is also a major
role of GSTs and has been suggested to be driving the
expansion of the family. In fact, times when changes in
the levels and the toxicity of environmentally available
chemicals have occurred, the catalytic promiscuity and
an elevated number of sGST isoforms would have constituted a fitness advantage. However, the functional
redundancy towards many of these chemicals would
eventually lead to a loss in the number of cGST isoforms. We suggest that the expansion of the cGST
family was strongly favored by the fact that the different
isoforms within a class have acquired new functions
towards endogenous substrates. We hypothesize that
these roles dictate the number of duplicates per class,
being more abundant for classes involved in the metabolism of product of oxidative stress (alpha, mu and
theta), but reduced to one when related with tightly

da Fonseca et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:281
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/281

regulated biological processes (such is the case for class
zeta involved in the metabolism of the aromatic amino
acids tyrosine and phenylalanine). The need for duplicates with sometimes overlapping substrate specificities
is further supported by differences in tissue specificity
and the increase of specificity for a particular reaction
that is weakly catalyzed by other isoforms.
Presently it is still difficult to ascertain the most
ancient class of cGSTs, with theta and omega being the
best candidates. Nevertheless, the information arising
from whole-genome sequencing of an increasing number of non-mammalian species will certainly provide
further insight into the origins and evolution of this
ancient gene family.

Materials and methods
The cGST sequences used in this work were obtained
from GenBank and are listed in Table 1 in Additional
file 1.
Because of the high sequence divergence of cGSTs,
amino acid multiple sequence alignments were done
using protein structure information in 3D-Coffee [32]
and PROMALSD [33](see Additional Files 2 and 3 for
the alignments used to build the trees presented on Figures 2 and 3, respectively). The codons in the nucleotide
alignment were aligned accordingly. We have chosen a
limited number of representative sequences for all clades
(the insect epsilon class is omitted as it forms a clade
with the delta class). DAMBE and MEGA4 were used
for sequence editing and formatting [34,35].
We have built the various phylogenetic trees based on
the nucleotide and amino acid alignments using
MrBayes [36] and PhyML [37] after determining the
optimal model of sequence substitution with Modeltest
3.04 (TVM+I+G) [38] and Prottest (JTT+I+G) [39]. One
cold and four incrementally heated chains were run for
2,000,000 generations with chains I = 2, 3, 4, and 5
incrementally heated with heat being 1/(1+[i-1]T) and T
= 0.2. Following a burn-in of 500,000, trees were
sampled every 100 generations (well after the chain
reached stationarity) and 15,000 trees were used for
inferring Bayesian posterior probability. The nucleotide
tree was obtained after removal of the third codon position. The trees obtained with PhyML are presented in
Figure 2 in Additional file 1. All trees were drawn in
FigTree http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/.
Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) implemented in PAML
[21] were used to identify genes under positive selection.
These tests are used to identify adaptive molecular evolution which occurs when the nonsynonymous substitution rate (dN) is higher than the synonymous rate (dS),
with the ratio ω (dN/dS) being higher than 1 [20]. The
LRTs used compare two probabilistic models of variable
ω ratios among sites, the simpler of which does not

Page 9 of 11

allow sites with ω >1 and a more general which does
[21] (model M7 vs M8). Amino acid sites under positive
selection were detected with Bayesian empirical bayes
(BEB) inference under the M8 model in PAML [21],
and with CONTEST, that assesses protein changes in
biochemical constraints to calculate evolutionary rates
[22]. CONTEST accounts for the variation of specific
biochemical properties, like volume, polarity and charge
and presents a new statistical method based on the
comparison of two-rate measures where a site is considered constrained for a given property if it shows high
conservation relatively to its total evolutionary rate
(some positions may be constrained while having a high
substitution rate, provided these substitutions do not
affect the biochemical property under constraint). CONTEST can also be used to infer positively selected positions, as it looks for sites that have experienced more
nonconservative substitutions than expected by chance
under the neutral hypothesis. Sequence alignments were
built to perform the positive selection test. For classes
where orthology/parology was difficult to assign, tests
were done using sets of genes existing in single species
(human, macaque, mouse and rat; Table 4 and Table 5).
Multiprot [40] was used to calculate the root mean
square deviation (RMSD) between C-alpha atoms of
cGST structures (Table 2 in Additional file 1). Neighbor-joining trees were obtained from the corresponding
distance matrices in PAUP [41].
