Abstract
Background: The genus Arachis is native to a region that includes Central Brazil and neighboring
countries. Little is known about the genetic variability of the Brazilian cultivated peanut (Arachis
hypogaea, genome AABB) germplasm collection at the DNA level. The understanding of the genetic
diversity of cultivated and wild species of peanut (Arachis spp.) is essential to develop strategies of
collection, conservation and use of the germplasm in variety development. The identity of the
ancestor progenitor species of cultivated peanut has also been of great interest. Several species
have been suggested as putative AA and BB genome donors to allotetraploid A. hypogaea.
Microsatellite or SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) markers are co-dominant, multiallelic, and highly
polymorphic genetic markers, appropriate for genetic diversity studies. Microsatellite markers may
also, to some extent, support phylogenetic inferences. Here we report the use of a set of
microsatellite markers, including newly developed ones, for phylogenetic inferences and the
analysis of genetic variation of accessions of A. hypogea and its wild relatives.
Results: A total of 67 new microsatellite markers (mainly TTG motif) were developed for Arachis.
Only three of these markers, however, were polymorphic in cultivated peanut. These three new
markers plus five other markers characterized previously were evaluated for number of alleles per
locus and gene diversity using 60 accessions of A. hypogaea. Genetic relationships among these 60
accessions and a sample of 36 wild accessions representative of section Arachis were estimated
using allelic variation observed in a selected set of 12 SSR markers. Results showed that the
Brazilian peanut germplasm collection has considerable levels of genetic diversity detected by SSR
markers. Similarity groups for A. hypogaea accessions were established, which is a useful criteria for
selecting parental plants for crop improvement. Microsatellite marker transferability was up to 76%
for species of the section Arachis, but only 45% for species from the other eight Arachis sections
tested. A new marker (Ah-041) presented a 100% transferability and could be used to classify the
peanut accessions in AA and non-AA genome carriers.

Conclusion: The level of polymorphism observed among accessions of A. hypogaea analyzed with
newly developed microsatellite markers was low, corroborating the accumulated data which show
that cultivated peanut presents a relatively reduced variation at the DNA level. A selected panel of
SSR markers allowed the classification of A. hypogaea accessions into two major groups. The
identification of similarity groups will be useful for the selection of parental plants to be used in
breeding programs. Marker transferability is relatively high between accessions of section Arachis.
The possibility of using microsatellite markers developed for one species in genetic evaluation of
other species greatly reduces the cost of the analysis, since the development of microsatellite
markers is still expensive and time consuming. The SSR markers developed in this study could be
very useful for genetic analysis of wild species of Arachis, including comparative genome mapping,
population genetic structure and phylogenetic inferences among species.

Background
The genus Arachis, family Fabaceae, is native to South
America, probably from a region including Central Brazil
and Paraguay [1]. There are 69 species described in the
genus, assembled into nine sections, according to the
morphology, geographic distribution and crossability [2].
Some of these species have been used for forage in South
America, but the most important species is the cultivated
peanut, Arachis hypogaea L. This crop is widely grown in
more than 80 countries in the Americas, Asia and Africa
[3] and is used for both human consumption and as a
source of oil. World production is increasing and has
reached 37 million tons (in the shell) and 5.8 million
tons of oil, according to FAO estimates [4]. Peanut now
ranks fifth among the world oil production crops.
Nearly all Arachis species are diploid, but cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid (genome AABB). It is a member of
the section Arachis, which also includes about 25 diploid
and one tetraploid wild species (A. monticola) [2]. Arachis
hypogaea is classified based on the presence or absence of
flowers on the main axis into two subspecies, hypogaea
and fastigiata. These two subspecies were further classified
into six botanical varieties based on morphology and
growth habits [2]. Subspecies hypogaea was divided in two
botanical varieties, hypogaea and hirsuta, while ssp. fastigiata in the varieties fastigiata, vulgaris, aequatoriana and
peruviana. The identity of the progenitor species of cultivated peanut has been of great interest. Several species
have been suggested as putative A and B genome donors
[reviewed by [5-7]]. RFLP analysis that included 17 diploid species of the section Arachis and three A. hypogaea
accessions suggested a single origin for domesticated peanut and ancestral species related to A. duranensis (A
genome) and A. ipaënsis (B genome) as the most likely
progenitors of A. hypogaea [5]. In situ hybridization analysis of six diploid species and one A. hypogaea accession,
and RAPD and ISSR (Inter-simple sequence repeat) analyses of 13 A. hypogaea accessions and 15 wild species, however, suggested A. villosa (A genome) and A. ipaënsis (B
genome) as the progenitors of cultivated peanut [6,7].

Cultivated peanut exhibits a considerable amount of variability for various morphological, physiological, and
agronomic traits. However, little variation has been
detected at the DNA level using techniques such as RAPDs
(Random Amplified Polymorphic DNAs), AFLPs (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms) and RFLPs
(Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms) [5,8-15].
The low level of variation in cultivated peanut has been
attributed to three causes or to combinations of them: (1)
barriers to gene flow from related diploid species to
domesticated peanut as a consequence of the polyploidization event [16]; (2) recent polyploidization, from one
or a few individual(s) of each diploid parental species,
combined with self-pollination [8]; or (3) use of few elite
breeding lines and little exotic germplasm in breeding
programs, resulting in a narrow genetic base [17,18].
Recently, some studies revealed DNA polymorphism in A.
hypogaea using SSRs (Simple Sequence Repeats), AFLPs,
RAPDs and ISSRs [7,19-23].
Little is known about the genetic variability of the Brazilian A. hypogaea germplasm collection at the DNA level.
Knowledge of the genetic variation of peanut accessions is
important for their efficient use in breeding programs, for
studies on crop evolution, and for conservation purposes.
Molecular marker analysis, joined to phenotypic evaluation, is a powerful tool for grouping of genotypes based
on genetic distance data and for selection of progenitors
that might constitute new breeding populations. In the
context of ex situ conservation, it has been demonstrated
that molecular markers are very useful for the management of germplasm collections [24]. SSRs are ideal tools
for such studies as they are PCR-based markers, genetically defined, typically co-dominant, multiallelic, and
uniformly dispersed throughout plant genomes. SSRs
have been used in plants for many genetic applications,
including the assessment of genetic variability in germplasm collections or pedigree reconstruction [reviewed by
[25]]. In Arachis, SSR markers have been recently developed and proved to be useful for accession discrimination
and assessment of genetic variation [19,22,23]. Moreover,

since little genetic variability has been detected in cultivated peanut, the use of a polymorphic marker, such as
SSRs, in addition to distinguishing closely related genotypes, should also be useful for phylogenetic studies, as
demonstrated in other crops, such as wheat [26], melon
[27], potato [28], and coffee [29].
The objectives of the present work were: (1) to develop
new SSR markers for genetic analysis of cultivated peanut
(A. hypogaea), (2) to employ a set of SSR markers to analyze the genetic variation among wild and cultivated peanut accessions of the Brazilian germplasm collection, and
(3) to evaluate the cross-species transferability of SSR
markers and their usefulness in phylogenetic studies of
the genus Arachis.

Results and Discussion
SSR development and screening of markers
Microsatellite enriched genomic libraries of A. hypogaea
were constructed in order to develop new SSR markers for
the species. Digestion of the A. hypogaea genomic DNA
with five different enzymes (AluI, MseI, RsaI, Sau3AI, and
Tsp509I) revealed that Tsp509I produced the most adequate profile for library development, with fragments
ranging from 200 to 800 bp in size. Four libraries were initially constructed based on trinucleotide repeat motifs
(TTG, TGG, ATG, and ATC). Hybridization analysis
revealed that the TTG/AAC repeats were more abundant in
the peanut genome than the other tested motifs (TTG >
TGG > ATG > ATC). This is in agreement with a survey of
published DNA sequences in 54 plant species, where the
TTG/AAC repeat was one of the most abundant SSRs [30].
Therefore, the TTG library was used for SSR development
for A. hypogaea. Screening of 750 clones by anchored PCR
showed that 162 had SSRs (21.6%) and these were
sequenced. Out of the 162 positive clones sequenced,
there were 91 unique (non-redundant) sequences (56.2%
of the sequenced clones) but only 67 of them were suitable for primer designing (41.4% of the positive clones).
The design of primers for the other 24 unique SSRs identified was not possible due to the occurrence of very short
tandem repeats (< 5 units) or low GC content of the
regions flanking the SSR. The anchored PCR screening
prior to sequencing significantly improved the yield of
useful clones. Few false-positive clones were obtained
(less than 10% of the sequenced clones). The percentage
of primers designed, in relation to the number of clones
sequenced (41.4%), indicated that the method used was
relatively efficient for the discovery and development of
SSR markers for peanut.

The 67 SSR markers (see Additional File 1) were screened
for polymorphism on seven samples, including five varieties of A. hypogaea, one accession of A. ipaënsis and one
accession of A. duranensis. Of these, 62 markers (92.5%)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/11

generated clearly interpretable PCR products, but only
three markers (Ah-041, Ah-193 and Ah-558) were polymorphic in cultivated peanut (Table 1). Four other markers (Ah-075, Ah-229, Ah-522 and Ah-657) showed to be
invariant for the five A. hypogaea accessions, but were polymorphic in A. ipaënsis and A. duranensis accessions. Since
ancestral species related to these two species are considered potential progenitors of the AABB genome, these
seven markers were included in the analysis of the genetic
relationships between accessions of the Brazilian germplasm collection (see below). The other 55 markers were
not polymorphic in A. hypogea accessions and were not
considered for further analysis. They have been useful,
however, for studies with diploid wild species of peanut
currently under development (data not shown).
SSR marker characterization
Marker loci duplication
Four (Ah-193, Ah-229, Ah-522, and Ah-657) of the seven
newly developed markers produced single fragments both
in the tetraploid accessions and in the diploid species
belonging to the Arachis section (see Additional File 2),
what indicates that each of them amplified alleles at single
loci. Two markers (Ah-075 and Ah-558) produced one or
two fragments in the diploid species and three (Ah-075)
or four (Ah-558) fragments in the tetraploid accessions.
These results are consistent with allele amplification on
duplicated loci. The presence of the three alleles (150/
144/138 bp) amplified by marker Ah-075 in the tetraploid accessions was confirmed by the identification of
diploid species homozygous for each of these three alleles
(for example, accessions K 30006, Sv 3806, V 6389, V
10309) or heterozygous for the three pairs of alleles (for
example, accessions K 30076, K 30097, V 14167). Similar
results were observed for marker Ah-558, but one (244
bp) of the six alleles (244/241/235/232/229/226 bp)
detected in the tetraploid accessions was not found in any
of the tested diploid wild species. The remaining marker
(Ah-041) amplified one (292 bp) or two of three alleles
(300/292/280 bp) in accessions of cultivated peanut and
in the diploid species (Figure 1). This indicates that either
the individuals tested are highly heterozygous for this
locus or this marker locus is duplicated in the cultivated
peanut genome. Since A. hypogaea is an allotetraploid
and preferentially an autogamous species, with only 2.5%
outcrossing [31], the latter hypothesis is more probable.
Five other markers previously developed [19] were also
analyzed for marker locus duplication, and two of them
(Ah4-04 and Ah4-24) seem to represent a single locus in
the genome. Therefore, five out of 12 markers (41,7%)
probably amplified duplicated loci in most of the cultivated peanut accessions. This proportion, although not
representative, indicates that locus duplication in peanut
might be higher than found for other polyploid species,
such as wheat [32], apple [33], cassava [34], and sweet

potato [35]. The inclusion of hybrids and parental diploid
plants in the study contributed to a better understanding
of the genetic basis of these marker loci. Markers that
amplified three or four alleles in tetraploid accessions
amplified consistently only two alleles in the interspecific
hybrids. In depth analyses of peanut segregant populations should elucidate the inheritance of these SSR loci.
Marker allelic diversity
Allelic diversity for a sample of 60 A. hypogaea accessions
(Additional File 2) was estimated for the three newly
developed polymorphic markers (Ah-041, Ah-193, Ah558) and five other SSR markers (Ah4-04, Ah4-20, Ah424, Ah4-26 e Lec-1), previously developed for cultivated

peanut [19] (Table 1). Marker Ah6-125 [19] was not
included in the analysis since it was found to be invariant
for the 60 accessions of cultivated peanut. The number of
alleles detected ranged from 2 to 27 at each of the eight
polymorphic loci, with an average of 8.4 alleles per locus.
Gene diversity values ranged from 0.468 to 0.929, with an
average value of 0.683. For polyploid organisms, gene
diversity is an estimate of the probability that two randomly chosen genes from a population are different and
it is not related to the expected proportion of heterozygous, as for diploid organisms in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [36]. The values obtained in the present study are
probably overestimated, since some of the markers amplified alleles on duplicated loci. Thus, they cannot be compared to those obtained for diploid species, but they are
similar to values found for other polyploid species such as
cassava [34], potato [37] and wheat [38]. Moreover, average h values estimated by RFLP markers were considerably
lower for A. hypogaea [10]. These results demonstrate the
usefulness of microsatellite markers for genetic diversity
analysis of cultivated peanut.
Marker Ah-041 and genome specific alleles
One of the markers developed in the present study (Ah041) presented interesting banding patterns (Figure 1) on
AA and non-AA genomes of diploid wild species. Genome
AA is characterized by the presence of a pair of chromosomes (called AA) that are considerably smaller than the
other chromosomes [39], while genome BB lacks this
small chromosome pair. All AA genome species, previously characterized by cytological analysis, showed a 292
bp allele when genotyped at the Ah-041 locus, while all
BB genome species and A. glandulifera (DD genome)
showed a 280 bp allele. Arachis hypogaea accessions
showed both alleles (292/280) or they had only the 292
bp allele. Arachis monticola, the other tetraploid species of
section Arachis, had also both 292 and 280 bp alleles.
Accessions of five AA genome species (A. stenosperma, A.
villosa, A. microsperma, A. simpsonii and A. kempff-merca-

BMC Plant Biology 2004, 4:11

doi), one BB genome species (A. valida) and A. glandulifera
showed a 300 bp band. Marker Ah-041 allowed allele
detection on all the 114 accessions tested, with a 100%
transferability in the genus. Species from the sections Erectoides, Extranervosae, and Triseminatae had different alleles
(277 and 274 bp). Allele 280 bp was also found in species
from the sections Trierectoides, Heteranthae, Procumbentes,
and Rhizomatosae. Only section Arachis species showed the
allele 292 bp (AA genome). Although allelic segregation
and genome mapping of this marker locus has not yet
been examined in controlled crosses, our results suggest
that the 292 bp allele is specific to AA genome species. If
so, this marker may be valuable for genetic studies of peanut, including phylogenetic inferences in the genus Arachis and studies about genome origin (see below). It
should be noticed that the absolute transferability of
marker Ah-041 to all Arachis species suggests that this SSR
sequence is positioned in or near coding regions. However, search on the National Center for Biotechnology
Information
(NCBI)
database
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ did not find any significantly complete or partially homologous sequence.
Transferability of SSR markers
Twelve SSR markers developed for Arachis hypogaea (Ah041, Ah-193, Ah-558, Ah-075, Ah-229, Ah-522, Ah-657,
Ah4-04, Ah4-20, Ah4-24, Ah4-26 and Lec-1) were tested
on 54 accessions of wild species of Arachis, representing
the nine sections of the genus. The transferability of the
twelve markers was up to 76% for species of the section
Arachis, but ranged from 23% (Triseminatae) to 62%
(Procumbentes), with an average of 45%, for species of the
other eight Arachis sections (see Additional File 3). Transferability of SSR markers between related species is a consequence of the homology of flanking regions of the
microsatellites and the size of the region between the
primer pair amenable to amplification by PCR. Other
studies have demonstrated the conservation of SSR
sequences in plants, as reviewed by Gupta and Varshney
[25]. The possibility of using microsatellite markers developed for one species in genetic evaluation of other species
greatly reduces the cost of the analysis, since the development of microsatellite markers is still expensive and time
consuming. The SSR markers developed in this study
could be very useful for genetic analysis of wild species of
Arachis, including comparative genome mapping, population genetic structure and phylogenetic inferences among
species.
Relationships between Arachis spp. accessions
Genetic similarities among accessions were estimated by
shared allele distance in pairwise comparisons of 60 A.
hypogaea accessions and 36 other accessions of wild species belonging to section Arachis (accessions 1 to 96 –
Additional File 2), using the same set of 12 markers

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/11

described above. Among the 60 A. hypogaea accessions,
the average genetic distance was 0.336. Some accessions,
such as Tatu, Tatu2 e Pd2622, shared all the alleles
detected with the 12 SSR markers.
A dendrogram based on the neighbor joining method was
constructed for the 96 accessions of the section Arachis
(Figure 2). Considering initially the A. hypogaea accessions, two main clusters were evident. Group I contained
all 32 fastigiata/fastigiata, all four fastigiata/vulgaris accessions, the only hypogaea/hirsuta accession (Mf 1538) and
one accession not identified to the subspecies level (Wi
632). The two fastigiata/aequatoriana accessions included
in the study (Mf 1678 and Mf1640) were also clustered in
this group. The two fastigiata/peruviana accessions (Mf
1560 e Sv 429) formed a separate subgroup within Group
I. Another subgroup was formed by a fastigiata/aequatoriana accession (Mf 1640), two variant forms of hypogaea/
hypogaea accessions (Nambiquarae, accession As 436 and
Malhado, accession V 12577) and V 12549, identified as
"ssp hypogaea Xingu type", because of its morphological
differences from the Virginia type. All 45 accessions of
Group I had the alleles 292 bp and 280 bp at the Ah-041
locus. The other group (Group II) contained solely the 15
Virginia type (hypogaea/hypogaea) accessions examined in
the study. The accessions of this group had only the 292
bp allele (Figure 1). Polymorphism at the Ah-041 locus
could be caused by mutation at the primer binding site in
the Group II accessions, preventing the detection of the
280 bp PCR product, or by an insertion/deletion event. If
the Ah-041 locus is duplicated in allotetraploid peanut,
these results could indicate that cultivated peanut did not
have a single origin since Group I accessions could be
derived from hybridization of AA and non-AA ancestral
diploid species followed by genome duplication, while
Group II accessions could be derived from straight
genome duplication of an AA diploid species. Multiple
origin hypotheses, based on cytological, crossing and isozyme studies, have been previously suggested to explain
the cultivated peanut origin [40-42].
The taxonomic status of A. hypogaea ssp. fastigiata var.
peruviana is controversial. Studies based on AFLP [21] as
well as RAPD and ISSR [7] markers have shown that accessions of this variety have greater similarity to ssp. hypogaea
rather than ssp. fastigiata, to which they are currently
thought to belong [2]. In the present study, the two fastigiata/peruviana accessions grouped with the other fastigiata
accessions and not with the 15 hypogaea/hypogaea accessions clustered in Group II. The data, therefore, corroborates the current classification of this botanical variety.
However, the classification of hypogaea/hirsuta and the
three variant forms of hypogaea/hypogaea (Nambiquarae,
Malhado and Xingu types) remains controversial, since
these four accessions did not cluster in Group II.

The SSR markers used in the present study detected
genetic variability in A. hypogaea accessions, despite the
known narrow genetic base of cultivated peanut. In the
two main clusters (Group I and Group II), some similarity
groups, genetically distant from each other, were formed.
These groups were not related to collection sites, seed
color, or any other known trait. However, the establishment of similarity groups, jointly with morphologic and
agronomic data, can be used in the selection and crossing
of superior plants, allowing for a more efficient use of the
existing genetic variability conserved in the collection.
Considering the wild species, the analysis showed that, in
general, the species containing the same genome clustered
together. However, accessions of A. duranensis clustered
with A. hypogaea and A. monticola accessions (Figure 2).
This result corroborates the hypothesis that an ancestral
species related to A. duranensis or A. duranensis itself could
be the donor of the AA genome to A. hypogaea. In the
group composed of BB genome species there is a cluster of
four species (A. ipaënsis, A. magna, A. williamsii and Arachis
sp. 6389). It has recently been noticed that plants of these
four species are morphologically very similar and produce
fertile hybrids. A revision of their taxonomic status is currently under evaluation by JFM Valls and CE Simpson.

considerable levels of genetic variability in the Brazilian
Peanut Germplasm Collection. Based on this data, cultivated peanut was classified into two major groups, one
composed of solely the Virginia type (hypogaea/hypogaea)
accessions and another defined by fastigiata/fastigiata, fastigiata/vulgaris, hypogaea/hirsuta, fastigiata/aequatoriana,
fastigiata/peruviana and two variant forms of hypogaea/
hypogaea accessions. The identification of similarity
groups could be useful for the selection of parental plants
to be used in the breeding programs. Marker transferability was up to 76% for species of the section Arachis, but
ranged from 23% (Triseminatae) to 62% (Procumbentes),
with an average of 45%, for species of the other eight Arachis sections. The possibility of using microsatellite markers developed for one species in genetic evaluation of
other species greatly reduces the cost of the analysis, since
the development of microsatellite markers is still expensive and time consuming. The SSR markers developed in
this study could be very useful for genetic analysis of wild
species of Arachis, including comparative genome mapping, population genetic structure and phylogenetic inferences among species. A marker (Ah-041) was identified
that allows the discrimination of AA from non-AA
genome accessions of peanut.

Methods
The genetic distance analysis based on SSR marker polymorphism supports previous estimates of high genetic
similarity between A. monticola accessions and
A.
hypogaea accessions (Figure 2). Only one (Ah-522) out of
the 12 SSR loci included in the present study showed alleles detected in A. hypogaea not observed in A. monticola.
Other studies with molecular data have also shown the little differentiation between these two taxa [8,9,11,42].
Moreover, hybrids between A. monticola and A. hypogaea
are fertile [2]. These facts have led some researchers to suggest that A. monticola and A. hypogaea should not be considered as separate species [11]. Our results, based on SSR
markers and only one accession of A. monticola, are certainly insufficient to define the taxonomic status of A.
monticola. However, they indicated that this species could
be directly related to the allotetraploid ancestral progenitor of A. hypogaea, as suggested by several studies [6,7,43].

Conclusions
The present study showed the utility of microsatellite
markers for the detection of polymorphisms among cultivated peanut accessions and for the genetic relationship
analysis between A. hypogaea accessions and wild species
of section Arachis. New SSR markers were developed for
genetic analysis of peanut, but the percentage of markers
that detected polymorphism among accessions of A.
hypogaea was low, corroborating the notion that cultivated
peanut presents a relatively reduced variation at the DNA
level. However, a set of informative SSR markers detected

Plant material
A single A. hypogaea plant was used for DNA library construction (accession UF 91108). Five A. hypogaea samples
(accessions 3274, 3294, 3310, 3324, and UF 91108), one
A. ipaënsis (accession 3309) and one A. duranensis (accession 4454) were used to test the effectiveness of SSR markers to detect polymorphism at the DNA level. These plants
were obtained from USDA-ARS Plant Genetic Resources
Conservation Unit (Griffin, GA) peanut collection.

A total of 114 accessions of wild and cultivated peanut
were included in the study (Additional File 2). Ninety-six
accessions belonging to section Arachis were used for
genetic diversity analysis. Of these, 60 are A. hypogaea
accessions, 47 of which collected in Brazil, representing
both A. hypogaea ssp. hypogaea and ssp. fastigiata, and their
six varieties. The other 36 accessions belong to 27 wild
species, including representatives of four new taxa that are
being described by JFM Valls and CE Simpson. The wild
species include tetraploid A. monticola (AABB), 13 diploid
(2n = 20) species showing the small chromosome pair
[44] which are associated to the AA genome of A.
hypogaea, the diploid A. glandulifera, for which a DD
genome has been suggested [45], two diploids with 2n =
18 [46] and ten species with 20 chromosomes lacking the
small chromosome pair typical of the AA genome, which
are classified as BB genome species (Additional File 2).
Other 18 accessions of wild species belonging to eight
Arachis sections were included in the analysis to test the

transferability of SSR markers. Three hybrid plants of the
A. stenosperma (V 10309) × A. duranensis (K 7988) cross
and one hybrid plant of the A. appressipila (G 10002) × A.
repens (Nc 1579) cross were also used to verify the heritability of alleles in interspecific crosses. The 114 accessions
and the four hybrid plants were obtained from the Brazilian Peanut Germplasm Collection, maintained at
Embrapa Genetic Resources and Biotechnology – CENARGEN (Brasília-DF, Brazil). All plants were grown from
seed or cuttings (sections Rhizomatosae and Caulorrhizae)
under greenhouse conditions at CENARGEN prior to
DNA extraction.
DNA extraction
Total genomic DNA used for library construction was
extracted and purified on cesium chloride gradients following standard protocols [47]. For the other samples,
total genomic DNA was extracted according to published
protocol [48], with some modifications: Proteinase K (20
mg/ml) was added to the extraction buffer and an additional step of polysaccharide precipitation with 2 M NaCl
was included.
Library construction
Total genomic DNA libraries enriched for trinucleotide
repeats were constructed following a standard protocol
with minor modifications [49]. Peanut total genomic
DNA was digested with five different enzymes (AluI, MseI,
RsaI, Sau3AI, and Tsp509I) to identify which one produced the most adequate fragment profile for library
development. Fragments ranging in size from 200 to 800
bp were transferred to S&S NA 45 DEAE cellulose membranes, after electrophoresis in 1.5% low-melting agarose
gel. DNA was resuspended in TE buffer and ligated to
Tsp509 I adapters. Four genomic libraries enriched for trinucleotide repeats were constructed. Fragments were
selected by hybridization with biotinylated trinucleotide
repeats ((TTG)6, (TGG)6, (ATG)6, (ATC)6) and recovered
by magnetic beads linked to streptavidine. Enriched fractions were amplified by PCR, using a primer complementary to the adapters. Amplification products were purified
using Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system
(Promega, Madison, WI), cloned into λ ZAP II phagemid
vector (Stratagene) and then transformed into E. coli
strain XL1-Blue. Transformed cells were grown on LBAmp plates (50 µg/ml ampicillin) at 37°C, until plaques
were between 0.5 and 1.0 mm in diameter. Individual
clones were picked up from the plates and phage were
eluted in SM buffer (500 µl) with a drop of chloroform.
Clone DNAs were then amplified by PCR using primers
complementary to the vector DNA flanking the insert (T3
or SK and T7 or KS primers, Stratagene, CA), and electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels in 0.5X TBE buffer to determine insert sizes. To determine the position of the SSRs
relative to the vector cloning site, an anchored PCR strat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/11

egy was performed for each positive clone [49], using T3
(or SK) and T7 (or KS) primers separately plus another
primer complementary to the target SSR.
DNA sequencing and primer design
Clones containing repeats that were not directly adjacent
to the cloning site were amplified, treated with ExoI and
shrimp alkaline phosphatase enzymes, and PCR products
were sequenced on an ABI 377 automated DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, CA, USA), using fluorescent dye-terminator chemistry. Redundant sequences were identified
using the software Sequencher (Gene Codes Corporation). Primers complementary to unique DNA sequences
flanking the SSRs were designed using the computer program Primer 3 (Whitehead Institute of Biomedical
Research – http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/
primer/primer3_www.cgi). Primer design parameters
were as follows: (i) Tm ranged from 60°C to 65°C; (ii)
1°C difference in Tm between primer pairs; (iii) GC content ranging from 45% to 55%, (iv) absence of complementarity between primers, (v) default values for the
other parameters.
Primer screening and PCR amplification of SSR loci
Primer pairs were initially screened for polymorphisms in
a set of five cultivated and two wild peanut accessions
(3274, 3294, 3310, 3324, UF 91108, 3309, 4454). PCRs
were performed in 13 µl volumes, containing 1X PCR
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM
MgCl2), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 unit Taq DNA polymerase, DMSO 50% (1.3 µl), 5 pmol of each primer and 10
ng of genomic DNA. Amplifications were performed
using either a 9600 System (Applied Biosystems, CA,
USA) or a PTC-100 (MJ Research, MA, USA) thermal
cycler, with the following conditions: 96°C for 2 min (1
cycle), 94°C for 1 min, 55–66°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1
min (30 cycles); and 72°C for 7 min (1 cycle). The annealing temperature was optimized for each primer pair to
produce clear DNA band amplification, without spurious
fragments. PCR products were resolved on 3.5% Metaphor agarose (FMC Bioproducts, ME, USA) gels stained
with ethidium bromide. For genotype determination, the
amplified products were separated on 4% denaturing
polyacrilamide gels stained with silver nitrate [50]. Fragment sizes were estimated by comparison with a 10-bp
DNA ladder standard (Gibco/BRL, MD, USA).
Data analysis and transferability of SSR loci
Eight selected SSR markers were characterized for number
of alleles per locus and gene diversity [51] using 60 accessions of Arachis hypogaea (accessions 1 to 60 – Additional
File 2). The markers included three developed in the
present study and five other SSR markers developed for A.
hypogaea [19]. Gene diversity (h) at a marker locus was
estimated according to the formula: h = 1 - Σ(pi)2, where

Page 8 of 10

BMC Plant Biology 2004, 4:11

pi2 is the frequency of the ith allele at this locus [51], using
the GDA software [52]. For estimates of genetic distance,
60 accessions of cultivated peanut and 36 accessions from
27 wild species of section Arachis were analyzed (accessions 61 to 96 – Additional File 2). A total of 12 markers
were used in this analysis (Ah-041, Ah-193, Ah-558, Ah075, Ah-229, Ah-522, Ah-657, Ah4-04, Ah4-20, Ah4-24,
Ah4-26 e Lec-1). Genetic distances among wild and cultivated peanut accessions based on microsatellite marker
polymorphism were estimated by shared allele distance in
pairwise comparisons. The estimates were based on the
sum of the proportion of common alleles between two
peanut accessions examined across loci (PS) divided by
twice the number of tested loci [53,54]. Genetic distances
were obtained by the parameter [-ln (PS)] using the
Genetic Distance Calculator [55]. The diagonal matrix was
then submitted to cluster analysis using the neighbor joining method and a genetic distance dendrogram built
using the software NTSYS 2.1 [56]. Transferability of the
13 SSR markers (the 12 described above plus marker Ah6125) was tested using the 36 accessions of section Arachis
(accessions 61 to 96 – Additional File 2) and another 18
wild species accessions belonging to the remaining Arachis
sections (accessions 97 to 114 – Additional File 2). PCR
amplification followed the same protocol used for A.
hypogaea. PCR products were visualized on silver-stained
4% denaturing polyacrilamide gels.
