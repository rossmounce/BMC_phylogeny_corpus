Abstract
The Bunyaviridae family of enveloped RNA viruses includes five genuses, orthobunyaviruses,
hantaviruses, phleboviruses, nairoviruses and tospoviruses. It has not been determined which
Bunyavirus protein mediates virion:cell membrane fusion. Class II viral fusion proteins (betapenetrenes), encoded by members of the Alphaviridae and Flaviviridae, are comprised of three
antiparallel beta sheet domains with an internal fusion peptide located at the end of domain II.
Proteomics computational analyses indicate that the carboxyl terminal glycoprotein (Gc) encoded
by Sandfly fever virus (SAN), a phlebovirus, has a significant amino acid sequence similarity with
envelope protein 1 (E1), the class II fusion protein of Sindbis virus (SIN), an Alphavirus. Similar
sequences and common structural/functional motifs, including domains with a high propensity to
interface with bilayer membranes, are located collinearly in SAN Gc and SIN E1. Gc encoded by
members of each Bunyavirus genus share several sequence and structural motifs. These results
suggest that Gc of Bunyaviridae, and similar proteins of Tenuiviruses and a group of Caenorhabditis
elegans retroviruses, are class II viral fusion proteins. Comparisons of divergent viral fusion proteins
can reveal features essential for virion:cell fusion, and suggest drug and vaccine strategies.

Introduction
Two classes of viral envelope proteins that mediate virion:cell fusion have been described. Class I and II fusion
proteins (aka α-and β-penetrenes) are distinguished, in
part, by the location of the "fusion peptide," a cluster of
hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids that appears critical for fusing viral and cell membranes. The fusion peptides of class I fusion proteins are located at or near the
amino terminus, whereas fusion peptides of class II fusion
proteins are internal. The overall structures of these two

classes of viral fusions proteins are also distinct. Class I
fusion proteins have a pair of extended α helices that are
separated by sequences variable in length, but usually
containing one or more dicysteine linkages. Several otherwise disparate viruses, including orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, retroviruses, arenaviruses, filoviruses and
coronaviruses encode class I fusion proteins [1-4]. Class II
fusion proteins are comprised mostly of antiparallel β
sheets. The prototypic class II fusion protein is the E glycoprotein of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a

member of the genus flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family
[5]. E possesses three β sheet domains (I-III). In the
slightly curved rod-like configuration of the E protein
present in the virion, the fusion peptide is located at the
tip of domain II, the furthest point distal from the C-terminal transmembrane anchor. The virion configuration
of envelope glycoprotein E1, the fusion protein of the
Alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV), demonstrates a
remarkable fit to the scaffold of TBEV E [6]. E of dengue
virus (DEN) and West Nile virus, medically important flaviviruses, also can be fit to the class II structure [7,8].
Recent studies indicate that TBEV E, DEN E and SFV E1
undergo similar conformational changes upon exposure
to low pH, as encountered during entry via endocytic vesicles, suggesting a common fusion mechanism [9-11].
Based on sequence similarities, it is likely that E1 of other
Alphaviruses and E of other members of the flavivirus
genus within the family Flaviviridae are also class II fusion
proteins. Members of the two other genuses in the Flaviviridae, hepaciviruises and pestiviruses, appear on the basis
of proteomics computational analyses to encode truncated class II fusion proteins [12].
The Bunyaviridae family of enveloped RNA viruses
includes five disparate genuses. Orthobunyaviruses, phleboviruses, nairoviruses and tospoviruses are spread by
insect vectors, whereas hantaviruses are spread by rodent
vectors [13]. Members of each Bunyavirus genus include
important human and animal pathogens, except the
tospoviruses, whose members infect plants [14,15]. The
Bunyavirus genome consists of three single-stranded RNA
segments. The envelope glycoproteins are encoded by the
middle-sized segment (M) [16,17]. Members of each
genus encode two glycoproteins that are present on the
virion surface, and designated Gn and Gc to refer to their
location amino terminal or carboxyl terminal on the M
encoded polyprotein. The M segments of orthobunyaviruses, phleboviruses, and tospoviruses have been shown
to encode for "nonstructural" proteins (NSm). In the case
of the orthobunyaviruses and phleboviruses, NSm is synthesized as part of the polyprotein, but in tospoviruses
NSm is encoded via an ambisense strategy by a separate
mRNA [18]. The identity and structure of Bunyavirus
fusion protein(s) are unknown, though it is likely that Gn
or Gc fulfills this role. Proteomics computational analyses
suggest that Bunyavirus Gc, and similar proteins of Tenuiviruses and a group of Caenorhabditis elegans retroviruses,
are class II viral fusion proteins (β-penetrenes).

Materials and Methods
Sequences
For sequence and structural comparisons of Bunyavirus M
encoded proteins representatives of the five genuses were
used, including pleboviruses Sandfly fever virus, Sicilian
strain (SAN, accession number: AAA75043) and Rift Val-

ley fever virus (RVF, P03518), orthobunyavirus Bunyamwera virus (BUN, NP047212), hantavirus Hantaan
virus, strain 76–118 (HAN, P08668), nairovirus CrimeanCongo hemorrhagic fever virus, strain IbAr (CCHF,
NP950235), and tospovirus tomato spotted wilt virus,
ordinary strain (TSWV, NP049359). Additional phlebovirus M sequences compared included those of Uukuniemi
virus (UUK, NP941979) and Punta Toro virus (PTV,
VGVUPT). Bunyavirus M sequences were compared to
sequences encoded in Alphavirus subgenomic RNA,
including structural proteins of Sindbis virus (SIN,
P03316), Semliki Forest virus (SFV, NP463458), Venezuelian equine encephalitis virus, strain TC-83 (VEE,
P05674), Western equine encephalitis virus, strain McMillan (WEE, AAF60166), O'nyong-nyong virus, strain
GULU (ONN, P22056), Mayaro virus, strain TRVL4675
(MAY, AA033335), Barmah Forest virus strain BH2193
(BFV, AA033347) and Ross River virus, strain NB5092
(RRV, NP740686). Comparisons were also made with
proteins encoded by RNA2 of the HZ isolate of Rice stripe
virus, a Tenuivirus (pvc2, AA031607), and with certain
retroviruses of Caenorhabditis elegans, including Cer13
(hypothetical protein Y75D11A.5, NP508324). We also
compared Bunyavirus M sequences to structural proteins
of Flaviviruses, including members of the flavivirus genus
tick-borne encephalitis virus, strain Neudoerfl (TBEV,
P14336); Japanese encephalitis virus, strain JaOARS982
(JEV, P32886), yellow fever virus, strain 17D-204 (YFV,
P19901), dengue virus type 2, strain PR-159/S1 (DEB,
P12823), and West Nile virus, strain NY 2000-crow3356
(WNV, AF404756). The prototype hepaciviruses, strain H
(subtype 1a) of hepatitis C virus (HCV, P27958), and several pestiviruses, including the Alfort 187 strain of classical swine fever virus, aka hog cholera virus (CSFV,
CAA61161), bovine viral diarrhea virus genotype 1 aka
pestivirus type 1, stain NADL (BVDV, CAB91847) and
border disease virus, strain BD31 (BVD, AAB37578), were
used in other comparisons.
Proteomics computational methods
Methods to derive general models of surface glycoproteins
have been described previously [2]. PRSS3, a program
derived from rdf2 [19], which uses the Smith-Waterman
sequence alignment algorithm [20], was used to determine the significance of protein alignments. PRSS3 is part
of the FASTA package of sequence analysis programs available by anonymous ftp from ftp.virginia.edu. Default settings for PRSS3 were used, including the blosum50
scoring matrix, gap opening penalty of 12, and gap extension penalty of 2. MacMolly (Soft Gene GmbH, Berlin)
was used to locate areas of limited sequence similarity and
to perform Chou-Fasman and Robson-Garnier analyses
[21,22]. PHDsec (Columbia University Bioinformatics
Center, http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/)
was the preferred method of secondary structure

prediction [23]. PHDsec predicts secondary structure from
multiple sequence alignments by a system of neural networks, and is rated at an expected average accuracy of 72%
for three states, helix, strand and loop. Domains with significant propensity to form transmembrane helices were
identified with TMpred (ExPASy, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics,
http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/
TMPRED_form.html). TMpred is based on a statistical
analysis of TMbase, a database of naturally occurring
transmembrane glycoproteins [24]. Sequences with a propensity to partition into the lipid bilayer were identified
with Membrane Protein eXplorer version 2.2a from the
Stephen White laboratory using default settings [25]. The
NetOglyc
server
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
NetOGlyc/ was used to predict mucin type GalNAc O-glycosylation sites. RasMac (University of California
Regents/Modular
CHEM
Consortium,
http://
mc2.cchem.berkeley.edu/Rasmol/v2.6/), developed by
Roger Sayle, was used to render a 3D model of SFV E1,
which was extrapolated to SIN E1 and SAN GC.

Results
Similar sequences or common structural/functional
motifs are located collinearly in the carboxyl terminal
glycoprotein of Sandfly fever virus and Sindbis virus envelope glycoprotein E1.
Previously, Gallaher and coworkers modeled the structure
of the retroviral transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) [2]
onto the scaffold of the known structure of the HA2 portion of the influenza virus hemagglutinin [26]. Later, Gallaher [1] fit the fusion protein of Ebola virus, a filovirus,
to retroviral TM. Both models proved remarkably similar
to the structures of these fusion proteins solved later by Xray crystallography [27-29]. These results indicate that
Gallaher's "Rosetta Stone" strategy, which employs the
fusion peptide and other identifiable features in combination with computer algorithms that predict secondary
structure, is a useful approach to the construction of work-

ing models of class I viral fusion proteins. This approach,
supplemented with newer proteomics computational
tools, was applied to envelope glycoproteins encoded by
members of the Bunyaviridae. Our initial finding,
obtained using the PRSS3 alignment algorithm [20,30],
was that the amino acid (aa) sequence of Gc of Sandfly
fever virus (SAN), a phlebovirus, has a significant similarity (p < 0.002) with the aa sequence of E1, the fusion protein of Sindbis virus (SIN), an Alphavirus (Table 1). SAN
Gc also showed significant overall alignments with E1 of
several other Alphaviruses examined, including Semliki
Forest virus (SFV), Western equine encephalitis virus
(WEE) and O'nyong-nyong virus (ONN). The Gc proteins
of the three other phleboviruses, Rift Valley fever virus
(RVF), Uukuniemi virus (UUK) and Punta Toro virus
(PTV), the only phleboviruses with completely sequenced
Gc coding regions also showed significant sequence similarities to certain Alphavirus E1 proteins. The alignment of
RVF Gc with SIN E1 and WEE E1 was statistically significant, but the alignment with SFV E1 was not. PTV Gc
showed the highest overall aa sequence similarity with
any Alphavirus E1 examined, that of Venezuelan equine
encephalitis virus (VEE) (p < 0.0004). UUK Gc showed a
significant overall alignment only with Ross River virus
(RRV) E1, while RRV E1 failed to align with any of the
other three phlebovirus Gc examined. These results from
multiple comparisons of phleboviruses Gc and Alphavirus E1 indicate that the significant alignment between
SAN Gc and SIN E1 is not a statistical aberration, but may
underlie structural and functional similarities between the
two viral glycoproteins. It is also of interest that the PRSS3
sequence alignment tool permitted detection of similarities not detected than by the use of BLASTp or related
computational methods.
Prior X-ray crystallographic studies have demonstrated
that SFV E1 is a class II viral fusion protein (β-penetrene)
[6]. Because of its extensive sequence similarity with SFV
E1, SIN E1 is assumed to be a class II viral fusion protein

[31]. The sequence similarities between SAN Gc and SIN
E1 do not permit alignment by computational methods
alone. The significance of the overall sequence similarity
can, however, be attributed to three collinear similarity
regions between the two glycoproteins detected by the
PRSS3 algorithm (Fig. 1A). Beginning from the amino terminus, the first sequence similarity starts in β-sheet Do in
domain Ia of SIN E1 and extends past β-sheet b in domain
IIa. The alignment was significant (P < 0.0002) between
aa 889–928 of SAN Gc and aa 833–873 of SIN E1 (Fig.
1A). The next significant sequence similarity, aa 1022–
1101 of SAN Gc and aa 946–1029 of SIN E1 (p < 0.03),
includes the SIN E1 sequence from β sheet Fo in domain
Ib to β sheet i in domain IIb. The third region of similarity,
SAN Gc aa 1181–1287 and SIN E1 aa 1112–1202 (p <
0.003), includes most of SIN E1 domain III. In addition,
two domains that are characteristic of class II viral fusion
proteins are also apparent in SAN Gc. Prior studies have
shown that aa 887–904 of SFV E1 are critically involved in
virion:cell fusion, and indicate that this region includes
the fusion peptide [32,33]. The fusion peptide of SIN E1
is assumed to be located similarly [31]. The fusion peptides of the class II viral fusion proteins are located at the
end of domain II, and consist predominantly of aromatic
aa (usually phenylalanine [F] or tryptophan [W]), hydrophobic aa, and aa with high turn potential (glycine [G]
and proline [P]). Cysteine linkages usually stabilize the
fusion peptides of class II viral fusion proteins in the overall structure (Fig 1A, red). A sequence (aa 960–977) corresponding to a consensus class II fusion peptide is present
in SAN Gc in a similar location to the SIN E1 fusion peptide (Fig. 1A). Another common domain of class II viral
fusion proteins readily identifiable in SAN Gc is the carboxyl terminal transmembrane anchor. Rossmann and
coworkers provided experimental evidence that SIN E1 aa
1215–1241 contains the transmembrane domain of SIN
E1 [31]. A similar hydrophobic sequence is located near
the carboxyl terminus of SAN Gc. TMpred, an algorithm
that identifies possible transmembrane helices, assigns a
significant score of 3048 (>500 is statistically significant)
to aa 1303–1322 of SAN Gc, which suggests that this is the
transmembrane anchor of SAN Gc. Using the regions of
local similarity and the fusion peptide and transmembrane domains, which are collinear, a proposed alignment between SAN Gc and SIN E1 can be constructed (Fig.
1B). The alignment necessitates only one "insertion." Relative to domain IIb of SIN E1, it appears that SAN Gc, has
an added sequence (aa 932–958), a proposed "loop"
flanked by cysteines and containing two N-linked glycosylation sites (NXT/S) reminiscent of glycosylated loops
of other viral envelope proteins [34].

Membrane interfacial domains in Bunyavirus
glycoproteins
To provide support for the proposed alignment of SAN Gc
and SIN E1, another proteomics computational tool was
used to compare potential membrane interactive domains
in the glycoproteins. Besides fusion peptides, a motif that
can be important in virus:cell fusion and is present in
many class I and class II viral fusion proteins is an aromatic aa rich domain proximal to the transmembrane
anchor [35]. The pre-anchor domains are not highly
hydrophobic according to the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy
prediction algorithm, but have a tendency to disrupt and
partition into bilayer membranes as revealed by analyses
using the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale
(WWIHS) [35,36]. SIN E1 contains a sequence prior to
and overlapping the transmembrane anchor with a significant WWIHS score as determined by Membrane Protein
eXplorer (MPeX) [25]. SAN Gc has two sequences with
significant WWIHS scores in this region, the pre-anchor
and the putative transmembrane domain. The fusion peptides of all class I and II viral fusion proteins examined to
date overlap sequences with significant WWIHS scores
(RFG, unpublished observation). The proposed fusion
peptide in SAN Gc consists of a sequence with a significant WWIHS score, which further supports the assignment
of this sequence as the fusion peptide. Additional
sequences with significant WWIHS scores are located collinearly along SAN Gc and SIN E1. In total, six of the seven
sequences in SAN GC with significant WWIHS scores
overlap in the proposed alignment with sequences with
significant WWIHS in SIN E1. Analysis of membrane
interfacial potential in the primary sequences thus provides further support for the proposed alignment of SAN
Gc and SIN E1.
A model of phlebovirus Gc
Recently, Gibbons and coworkers determined the structure of a fragment of the SFV E1 ectodomain (lacking carboxyl terminal aa 392–438) after exposure to low pH and
liposomes [33]. Under these conditions, which mimic an
endosomal environment, the SFV E1 ectodomain fragment changes from a soluble monomer to a trimer as it
inserts into the liposomal membrane after exposure to
low pH. A similar post-fusion structure was found in two
other class II fusion proteins, E of DEN and TBEV [10,11].
These investigators proposed several possible fusion intermediates of SFV E1 and other class II viral fusion proteins
after exposure to low pH. These intermediates are
assumed to be similar to structural intermediates of SIN
E1. To determine the plausibility of the proposed SAN Gc
and SIN E1 alignment, a model of SAN Gc was scaffolded
on a presumed structural intermediate of SIN E1 in which
compared to the orientation in the virion at neutral pH,
domain III is displaced closer to the fusion peptide (Fig.
2). The collinear sequence alignments between SAN Gc

SAN Gc may be comprised mostly of antiparallel β sheets,

prediction algorithms, including PHDsec [23], Chou-Fasman [21] and Robson-Garnier [22] analyses. The proposed SAN Gc structure conforms closely to the structural

Model of Sandfly fever virus Gc based on predicted structure of a Sindbis virus E1 fusion intermediate. Panel A: A structural
intermediate of SFV E1 as determined by Gibbons et al. [33] was projected to SIN E1. Panel B: A model fitting SAN GC to the
predicted structure of SIN E1. Structures predicted to be similar are color-coded the same way in SIN E1 and SAN Gc. Grey
lines: dicysteine linkages. Black stick figures: N-glycosylation sites (sites with central proline are often not used). Regions with
significant Wimley-White interfacial hdrophobicity scale scores were predicted with MpeX (black).

predictions of PHDsec, the most robust algorithm, but is
also generally consistent with both Chou-Fasman and
Robson-Garnier predictions. In some cases because of significant aa sequence similarity with SIN E1, ambiguous
structures in SAN Gc are depicted as in SIN E1. Additional
evidence for the proposed alignment is the location of
cysteine residues of SAN Gc and SIN E1. The cysteine residues are usually the most conserved aa in within a protein family because disulfide linkages are a critical
determinant of secondary structure. The dicysteines of SIN
E1 (Fig. 2B) are arranged such that bonds are formed only
between residues within the same putative domain. A
similar arrangement is feasible for SAN Gc with C residues
present in close proximity after scaffolding on the SIN E1
structure, and with possible linkages occurring within the
three proposed domains. This model also locates the four
SAN Gc glycosylation sites so they are surface accessible.
There are many possible alternatives to the cysteine linkages and secondary structures of SAN Gc drawn in Figure
2. Nevertheless, a plausible three-dimensional model of
SAN Gc that conforms to the scaffold of the known structure of Alphavirus E1 can be constructed. This result coupled with predictions of a predominantly β sheet
secondary structure of SAN Gc provides further support its
proposed alignment with SIN E1.
Sequence/structural features of Bunyavirus Gc suggest that
a class II fusion protein structure is conserved in members
of the Bunyaviridae
To provide additional evidence for the proposed SIN E1/
SAN Gc alignment and the SAN Gc class II fusion protein
model, we determined whether structural/sequential similarities with class II fusion proteins are conserved in envelope proteins encoded by other members of the
Bunyavirus family. With the exception of tospoviruses,
that use an ambisense strategy for synthesis of a nonstructural protein, Bunyavirus M segments are negative in
polarity and the mRNA transcribed contains a long open
reading frame [37]. The M segment mRNA is translated as
a polyprotein, which is post-translationally processed
[38]. There is considerable diversity in the number and
sizes of the M segment encoded polyproteins produced in
infected cells, but all Bunyaviruses encode at least two
glycoproteins, Gn and Gc. Prior analyses have revealed
similarities between Gc encoded by members of
orthobunyaviruses and tospoviruses [18,39], but evidence
that Gn and Gc serve analogous functions in each Bunyavirus genus has not been available previously. Comparisons among Gc of members of the five genuses of the
Bunyaviridae using the PRSS3 algorithm revealed that the
type members of each genuses display significant
sequence similarities with certain Gc of viruses of other
Bunyavirus genuses (Table 2). The most significant alignment detected among members of different genuses of the

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/1/1/10

Bunyaviridae, was between RVF, type member of phleboviruses, and tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), type member of tospoviruses (p < 10-18). As noted previously
[18,39], orthobunyavirus Gc also show a significant similarity to tospovirus Gc, with Bunyamwera virus (BUN) Gc
displaying a significant similarity to TSWV Gc (p < 10-8).
As with phlebovirus Gc, the prototype of the hantavirus
genus, Hantaan virus (HAN), showed a modest sequence
alignment (p < 0.05) with SIN E1, further supporting the
proposed similarities between Bunyavirus Gc and
Alphavirus E1. Significant alignments were not detected
between Bunyavirus Gc or Alphavirus E1 and TBEV E or
other flavivirus class II viral fusion proteins. Limited local
similarities were observed between some Bunyavirus Gc
and pestivirus E2. It is noteworthy that the significance of
the overall sequence similarities between certain phlebovirus Gc and Alphavirus E1 is higher than some similarities among Gc of some prototypic members of the
Bunyaviridae (compare Table 1 and 2). Collectively, these
results suggest that Gc of Bunyaviruses share a limited
number of similar sequences.
Available computational methods alone do not permit
overall alignments of Bunyavirus Gc, however, through
the use of PRSS3 and MacMolly alignment tools and by
inspection certain common sequences can be identified.
The most highly conserved sequences among type members of the five Bunyavirus genuses conform to a consensus class II fusion peptide (Fig. 3, red) and to a carboxyl
terminal transmembrane domain (Fig. 3, violet). Certain
cysteine clusters, which are likely to stabilize the secondary structures of the proteins, also are present in similar
locations along the proteins, including the beginning of
putative domain III (Fig. 3). Further support for the alignment of Bunyavirus Gc is obtained by the use of the
WWIHS. Sequences with significant WWIHS scores are
located in similar locations in Bunyavirus Gc (Fig. 3,
olive). The proposed fusion peptides and transmembrane
domains of each of the Bunyavirus Gc examined displayed significant WWIHS scores. In addition, most of the
Gc examined had sequences with significant WWIHS
scores in the putative IIa domains and either the putative
Ic domain or the beginning of adjacent domain III. This
alignment suggests that orthobunyaviruses and tospoviruses Gc have extended regions of approximately 400 and
50 amino acids at the amino terminus relative to phlebovirus, hantavirus and nairovirus Gc. These results also suggest that motifs involved in virion:cell fusion are
conserved in Gc throughout the Bunyaviridae, and that Gc
is the fusion protein encoded by members of each Bunyavirus genus.

Two-way comparisons were done between the full-length amino acid sequences of the indicated glycoproteins. Probabilities (p values) of a

2C-terminal sequence.

Sequence/structural features of Bunyavirus Gc are present
in a Tenuivirus protein and in an Env encoded by a
Caenorhabditis elegans retrovirus
As previously reported, phlebovirus Gc have a significant
similarity to surface protein pvc2 encoded by plant viruses
of the Tenuiviridae [40]. The PRSS3 sequence alignment
algorithm confirms this similarity (Table 2, p < 0.001). An
envelope protein (Env) encoded by a group of retroviruses
of the nematode C. elegans also demonstrate significant
similarities to phlebovirus Gc [41,42]. There is a significant alignment detected by the PRSS3 algorithm between
SAN Gc and the carboxyl terminal region of Env of Cer13,
a potentially replication-competent member of this group
(Table 2, p < 10-8). These results further validate the use of
the PRSS3 algorithm to identify limited similarities
amongst viral proteins. Alignment of the carboxyl terminal portion of the pvc2 protein of rice stripe virus (RiSV),
a Tenuivirus, and the envelope protein encoded by Cer13
retrovirus with two phlebovirus Gc reveals a collinear
arrangement of fusion peptide consensus sequences (Fig.
4, red) and potential carboxyl terminal transmembrane
domains (Fig. 4, violet). These proteins also have several
overlapping sequences with significant WWIHS scores
(Fig. 4, olive). The retention of these features in proteins
encoded by evolutionarily distant genomes, provides further evidence that these motifs are important for the function of Bunyavirus fusion proteins.

Protein order in polyproteins encoded by Bunyaviridae M
segments
The longest open reading frames of M segments of all
members of the Bunyaviridae are antisense to the virion
RNA. mRNAs transcribed from Bunyavirus M segments
are translated into large polyproteins that are subsequently cleaved by into functional proteins [38,43]. Gc of
members of each of the five Bunyavirus genuses are the
carboxyl terminal proteins of the polyprotein (Fig. 5).
Because viral proteins with similar functions may have
similar genome locations, we sought evidence for
sequence similarities among other Bunyavirus proteins
encoded by the M segment. Gn of type members of the
five Bunyavirus genuses were compared to each other and
each had a limited sequence similarity to at least one
other Gn of a type member of a different genus (Table 3).
The most significant alignment was between the Gn proteins of HAN, a hantavirus, and CCHF, a nairovirus (p <
10-4). HAN Gn also showed a significant alignment with
Gn of RVF, a phlebovirus. Both HAN Gn and Gn of TSWV,
a tospovirus, also showed significant alignments with
envelope protein 2 (E2) of SIN. SIN E2 has been
implicated as the virion protein responsible for binding to
the cell surface receptor [44]. These results suggest that the
Gn of Bunyaviruses have limited similarity, and may have
a common role or roles in the virus replication cycle. The
order (from amino to carboxyl terminus) of proteins in

Figure 3 of Gc amino acid sequences of prototype members of the five genuses of the Bunyaviridae family
Alignment
Alignment of Gc amino acid sequences of prototype members of the five genuses of the Bunyaviridae family. Alignments were
constructed by identifying the fusion peptide (red) and the transmembrane anchor (violet) as described in the text. Additional
local sequence similarities were identified by using the Complign feature of MacMolly, the PRSS3 alignment algorithm or by
inspection. Sequences with significant WWIHS scores (olive) were identified by MPeX.

the polyproteins of SIN and other members of the
Alphaviridae is Capsid-E2-E3-6K-E1. Receptor and fusion
functions may reside in two different Bunyavirus proteins,
Gn and Gc respectively, occurring in the same order as the
envelope glycoproteins, E2 and E1, that carry out these
functions in Alphaviruses (Fig. 5). The similarities in protein order and functions support the hypothesis that Gc is
the fusion protein of Bunyaviruses. These results also support the suggested nomenclature of Gn and Gc for the
Bunyavirus M segment encoded glycoproteins as a
replacement for the current ambiguous nomenclature,
which variously assigns the designation G1 or G2 to unrelated Bunyavirus glycoproteins. The presumptive protein
encoded by the amino terminal region of the pvc2 protein
of RiSV also showed limited similarity to SIN E2 (Table 3).
Thus, the similarities between proteins encoded by a Ten-

uivirus extend to another glycoprotein of a virus with a
class II fusion protein.
The simplest M polyprotein, encoding only Gn and Gc, is
that of hantaviruses (Fig. 5). In addition to Gn and Gc,
phlebovirus and orthobunyavirus encode nonstructural
proteins (NSm) that have two or three potential transmembrane spanning domains as detected by TMpred (Fig.
5). Nairoviruses, such a Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever virus (CCHF), synthesize a similar protein [45,46],
and we have designated this protein "NSm." NSm of the
RVF and BUN, type members of phlebovirus and
orthobunyaviruses, as well as the "NSm" protein of CCHF
have short regions of similarity with each other as
revealed by the PRSS3 sequence alignment algorithm,
although the overall alignments are not significant. There

were also short regions of similarity between the NSm
proteins of these three Bunyavirus genuses and the prM/
M-like proteins of Flaviviruses (not shown). Immature
virions of members of the flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae contain a precursor prM to the small membrane
protein M. prM is cleaved by furin or by a furin-like protease during virus release to produce the mature M protein
localized on the surface of flavivirus virion [47,48]. Flavivirus PrM/M, contains two potential membrane spanning
domains, and their functions may include shielding of
internal cellular membranes from the fusion peptide of E
[7,47]. It is possible that the phlebovirus, orthobunyavirus and nairovirus M segment encoded nonstructural proteins, all with multimembrane-spanning potential, serve
the same function for Gc. NSm of TSWV, a tospovirus,
showed no sequence similarity or structural similarity
with any Bunyavirus protein examined. The functions of
tospovirus NSm, which is encoded by the only positive
polarity gene in any M segment, and the other Bunyavirus
NSm proteins remain to be determined. Nairovirus M
may encode two additional proteins, a mucin-like protein
(MLP), which contains a variable region with a high concentration of potential O-glycosylation sites, and a protein designed here X, neither of which have obvious
homologs encoded by members of the other Bunyavirus
genuses [45,46]. The coding sequences of Bunyavirus M

appear to have evolved in a manner preserving the order
of the glycoproteins Gn and Gc, while allowing for insertion or deletion of sequences encoding additional
proteins.

Discussion
Proteomics computational analyses suggest that Bunyavirus Gc proteins are class II viral fusion proteins (β-penetrenes), with a structure similar to the fusion proteins of
Alphaviruses and Flaviviruses. Similar sequences or common structural/functional motifs are collinearly located
in Bunyavirus Gc and Alphavirus E1. Features common to
other class II fusion proteins, including an internal fusion
peptide, a carboxyl terminal transmembrane domain and
regions with a high propensity to interface with bilayer
membranes, are conserved and in similar locations in Gc
of viruses in each genus of the Bunyaviridae. These features are also present in glycoproteins encoded by
nonenveloped Tenuiviruses of plants, and a group of C.
elegans retroviruses previously shown to have remarkable
sequence similarities to phlebovirus Gc. These results also
indicate that Gallaher's "Rosetta Stone" strategy can be
used to identify potential class II viral fusion proteins, as
demonstrated previously for class I fusion proteins [13,49]. The common placement of proper names or "cartouches" allowed the ancient languages of the Rosetta

Stone to be deciphered. As advanced by Gallaher, fusion
peptides can serve a similar function to facilitate
alignment of viral fusion proteins with limited sequence
similarities.
Many viral fusion proteins fit neither class I or II and it is
likely that other classes of viral fusion protein also exist.
However, among major classes of enveloped RNA viruses,
there are at least six, myxoviruses, retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, arenaviruses and coronaviruses, that
encode class I viral fusion proteins [1-4]. Alphaviruses,
members of the flavivirus genus of the Flaviviruses, and
according to current analyses, Bunyaviruses, encode class
II viral fusion proteins. Computational analyses suggest
that members of the two other Flavivirus genuses, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses, encode variant class II fusion proteins [12]. The viruses encoding class II or II viral fusion
proteins thus represent a substantial portion of enveloped
RNA virus families known to infect vertebrates. It is significant that representative class I and II encoding viruses are
also found in evolutionarily distinct plant viruses and

viruses or virus-like genomic elements of nematodes and
insects [41,42,50,51]. There may be constraints on the
structures of viral proteins capable of effectively mediating
virion:cell fusion, or a limited number of enveloped RNA
virus lineages.
Alphaviruses appear to use separate envelope proteins for
fusion (E1) and attachment (E2) [44]. Because Bunyavirus
Gc display similarities to Alphavirus E1 and certain Bunyavirus Gn display limited sequence similarities to
Alphavirus E2, Bunyaviruses may have adapted a similar
strategy. Verification that Gc is the fusion protein of Bunyaviruses will require a combination of X-ray crystallographic structural studies and site-directed mutagenesis of
key features such as the putative fusion peptide. Verification that Gn serves as the receptor binding protein for any
Bunyavirus requires identification of its cell surface receptor. E, the class II fusion protein of TBEV, dengue virus,
and other members of the flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae, mediates both virion:cell fusion and receptor-binding [52,53]. Therefore, it is possible that Bunyavirus Gc

serves both as the fusion protein and receptor binding
protein.
The remarkable similarities in both the pre- and postfusion forms of the fusion proteins of SFV E1, an Alphavirus, and DEN and TBEV, members of the flavivirus genus
of the Flaviviruses, in the absence of detectable sequence
similarities, suggest that Alphavirus and Flavivirus class II
fusion proteins may have diverged from a common progenitor. Alternatively, there may have been convergent
evolution towards the common structure. Likewise, the
sequence similarities detected between phlebovirus Gc
and SIN E1 are consistent with divergent evolution from a
common progenitor, but are insufficient to directly establish a phylogenic relationship. The results presented here
suggest that Gc of members of the Bunyaviridae may have
a common ancestor. Gn and Gc are in analogous locations
in the polyproteins encoded by the five genuses of the
Bunyaviridae. The simplest Bunyavirus M polyprotein,
that of hantavirus members, encodes only Gn and Gc,
whereas M of members of other Bunyavirus genuses
encode several additional proteins. Therefore, divergence
of Bunyavirus M segments may have occurred either
through acquisition of sequences and/or lose of
sequences in a cassette manner constrained in part by the
locations of the major glycoproteins.

Comparisons of divergent viral fusion proteins with internal fusion peptides can reveal features essential for virion:cell fusion. Regions of high membrane interfacial
propensity including the fusion peptide and the transmembrane anchor, appear in similar locations in Bunyaviruses, Alphaviruses and Flaviviruses. The presence of
several additional sequences with the propensity to interact with bilayer membranes in class II viral fusion proteins
has not been considered in previous virion:cell fusion
models [9,11,54]. Cell entry of Alphaviruses and Flaviviruses is believed to occur via the endocytic route, and it is
likely that this is the entry route of Bunyaviruses [55]. Following binding to the cellular receptor, a putative function of Bunyavirus Gn (Fig. 6A), the Bunyavirus virion
may be taken up in an endocytic vesicle (Fig. 6B). Exposure to acidic pH in the endosome may trigger conformational changes in the envelope proteins and in the virion
itself resulting in dissociation of Gn and Gc (Fig. 6C). Current models of fusion mediated by Alphavirus and
Flavivirus class II viral fusion proteins suggest that the low
pH of the endosome triggers trimerization and a bending
of class II fusion proteins at a flexible "hinge" region
between domains I and II elevating the fusion peptide so
that it can insert into the host membrane [6,9,11,54]. Current models then suggest that a rearrangement of the stem
(pre-anchor region), so that there are more extensive
interactions with domains I-III, results in a deformation
of the viral and target membranes and the formation of

Hypothetical model of Bunyavirus:cell fusion
Hypothetical model of Bunyavirus:cell fusion. Steps in the entry process of Bunyaviruses can be extrapolated from current
models of class II viral fusion protein-mediated virion cell fusion. Panel A. The Bunyavirus glycoproteins Gn and Gc are modeled according to SIN virion structure analyses by Zhang et al. [31]. Based on limited similarities with Alphavirus E2 proteins
(Table 3), Gn is depicted as the receptor-binding protein of Bunyaviruses. Certain Bunyaviruses may encode other membraneassociated proteins that interact with the fusion peptide or other regions of Gc. Panel B: Receptor-binding triggers uptake of
Bunyavirus virion by endocytosis. Panel C: Acidification of the endocytic vesicle occurs via the action of proton transporters
and may initiate Gn and Gc dissociation. Panel D: bending at the flexible "hinge" region beween domains I and II permits Gc
trimer formation and insertion of the fusion peptide into the endosomal vesicle membrane. Panel D' Alternatively, Gc trimer
formation may involve the rotation of domain III and a rearrangement (twist) of domain II as shown for SFV E1, DEN E and
TBEV E [11,33,54]. Panel E: As previously proposed [11,33,54] the formation of more extensive Gc contacts in the trimers and
stem regions may release of energy for distortion of the endosomal and viral membranes resulting in formation of "nipple-like"
projections. Panel E': Alternatively, aa sequences of Gc that form a track with the ability to interface with bilayer membranes
(Fig. 2, black), may facilitate mixing of the endosomal and viral membranes. Panel F: Formation of further trimer contacts and
hemifusion. Hemifusion may not occur in the D' and E' pathway. Panel G: Formation of the "fusion pore" and entry of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) segments. Modified from models and concepts proposed in references 9-12.

apposing membrane "nipples" (Fig. 6E). Subsequently,
the nipples are brought closer together by continued interactions of the stem with domains I-III, which results in
bilayer hemifusion (Fig. 6F). Complete fusion follows
allowing entry of the ribonucleoproteins containing the
viral genomic RNA (Fig. 6G). An analogous mechanism,
involving deformation and nipple formation of the viral
and cellular membranes caused by rearrangements of the
viral fusion proteins (six helix bundle formation) has
been proposed for class I viral fusion proteins [54].

patients, and has been approved for use in the treatment
of HIV infection in the United States and European Union
[58,59]. Peptides targeted to membrane interactive motifs
block virion:cell fusion mediated by DEN and West Nile
virus, flaviviruses with class II fusion proteins (Hrobowski
et al., submitted). Peptide inhibition strategies targeted to
Gc may be broadly applicable to various members of the
Bunyaviridae.

Competing Interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Current fusion models do not consider that the transmembrane domain and fusion peptide, while anchored
into the viral and cellular membranes, would still be free
to move laterally without distorting the membranes. More
importantly, the virion is quite small compared to the cell,
and would be freely mobile. Rearrangement of the fusion
proteins may simply draw the virus closer to the cell without distorting either the viral or cellular membranes. An
alternative to the models involving apposing membrane
nipple formation is suggested by the observation that
sequences of class II viral fusion proteins, including the
fusion peptide, the transmembrane anchor and other
sequences with high WWIHS scores, potentially form a
nearly continuous track of membrane interactive regions
that could channel the movement of lipids during virion:cell fusion (Fig. 2, black). Similar nearly contiguous
sequences with significant WWIHS scores are present in
the post-fusion intermediates of Alphaviruses SIN and
SFV, DEN and other flaviviruses, and the proposed structures of hepaciviruses and pestiviruses [12]. An intermediate, with the track of sequences with high membrane
interfacial propensity, may be the first intermediate
formed after exposure to the low pH in liposomes (Fig.
6D'). Upon formation of higher multimers of trimers, the
regions with high WWIHS scores, in conjunction with the
fusion peptide and transmembrane could then form a
"pore" in which the lipids of the cellular and viral bilayer
membranes could mix directly (Fig. 6E'). With lipid mixing facilitated by these membrane interfacial sequences
bilayer fusion may proceed without a hemifusion step,
but still permitting entry of the genome-containing RNP
(Fig. 6G).
In the absence of structural determinations by X-ray crystallography, models such as proposed here can provide
useful hypotheses to guide experimental strategies for
development of vaccines or drugs to prevent or treat infection by viruses with class II fusion proteins. Prior to the
availability of X-ray structural data, several potent HIV-1
TM inhibitors were developed [56,57] based on the Gallaher HIV-1 TM fusion protein model [2]. Fuzeon™ (DP178;
T20 enfuvirtide), one of these peptides corresponding to a
portion of an α helices and the pre-anchor domain, has
been shown to substantially reduce HIV-1 load in AIDS
