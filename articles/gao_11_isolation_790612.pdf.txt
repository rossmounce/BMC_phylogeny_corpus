Abstract
Background: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infections continue to cause significantly losses in the deer
population. Better isolation and identification of BVDV from sika deer may contribute significantly to the
development of prophylactic therapeutic, and diagnostic reagents as well as help in prevention and control of
BVDV. However, isolation and identification of BVDV from sika deer is seldom reported in literature. In this study,
we collected some samples according to clinical sign of BVDV to isolation and identification of BVDV from sika
deer.
Results: we isolated a suspected BVDV strain from livers of an aborted fetus from sika deer in Changchun (China)
using MDBK cell lines, named as CCSYD strain, and identified it by cytopathic effect (CPE), indirect
immunoperoxidase test (IPX) and electron microscopy(EM). The results indicated that this virus was BVDV by a
series of identification. The structural proteins E0 gene was cloned and sequenced. The obtained E0 gene
sequence has been submitted to GenBank with the accession number: FJ555203. Alignment with other 9 strains of
BVDV, 7 strains of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and 3 strains of border disease virus(BDV) in the world, showed
that the homology were 98.6%-84.8%, 76.0%-74.7%, 76.6%-77.0% for nucleotide sequence, respectively. The
phylogenetic analysis indicated that new isolation and identification CCSYD strain belonged to BVDV1b.
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that BVDV was isolated and identified in sika
deer. This current research contributes development new BVDV vaccine to prevent and control of BVD in sika deer.

Background
Bovine viral diarrhea virus, a single-stranded RNA is
found in cattle and other ruminants worldwide [1-4].
The presence of BVDV in other domestic species such
as sheep or wild species such as whitetail deer might be
relevant to the epidemiology other disease in cattle [5].
The BVDV infections range from clinically in apparent
infections to severe disease involving one or more organ
systems. Historically, BVDV was associated with digestive tract disease including high mortality. Currently,
BVDV is associated more frequently with respiratory
disease and fetal infections [2]. Raise skia deer already
had hundreds years at present artificially in china and
farmed populations had reached hundreds of thousands

in recent year. However, bovine viral diarrhea (BVD)
caused significantly losses in the deer population. It was
reported that infections rates of BVDV for young deer
reached 60%~86.7% in some areas of china in recently
years [6], which caused economic losses to sika deer
industry due to the high morbidity and fetal infections
associated with the disease. Thus, the isolation and identification of BVDV from sika deer, which is fundamental
to prevent and control of BVDV in sika deer, becomes
an urgent task to many researchers.
The Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) belongs to the
genus pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae. BVDV is
closely related to the classical swine fever virus (CSFV)
and the ovine border disease virus (BDV) [7]. The pestiviral genome consists of a single stranded positive sense
RNA with a length of about 12.3 kb. It contains one larger open reading frame (ORF), which is flanked by nontranslated regions (NTR) on both genome termini. The
single ORF is translated into one polyprotein, which is

co-and post- translationally processed into the mature
proteins N pro , C, E0 (gp48, also named E rns ), E1, E2,
NS2/3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5a and NS5b by viral and cellular proteases [8-10]. E0 protein, the main structural protein of BVDV, plays a very important role in inducing
protective immunoreaction against BVDV and diagnosing virus [2].
Although BVDV from the skia deer has been seriously
concerned, there are only a few articles with respect to
the prevalence of BVDV investigations and BVDV clinical sign [6], Particular, lacking in articles with regard to
the molecular virology, gene sequences and genetically
engineering vaccine of local BVDV isolates in China due
to BVDV from skia deer without isolation and identification. The purpose of our study was isolation and identification BVDV from skia deer by a series of methods,
which contributes this disease control.

Results
Isolation and identification

The significant cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed
in MDBK cell infected with virus 24h-48h. The MDBK
cells generate obvious cell lesion and net between cells
in comparison to the control cells, which is consistent
with CPE of BVDV on MDBK cell (Figure 1). The IPX
assay showed that the well of positive serum appeared
red-brown cytoplasmic staining, which suggested that
new isolation virus might be BVDV. The negatively
stained virus particles extracted from liver were approximately 40 nm-60 nm in diameter when examined by
electron microscope (Figure 2), and displayed a typical
BVDV morphology.
Amplification, sequencing and analysis of E0 gene

The MDBK cell infected with CCSYD were positive by
the RT-PCR assays, and the expected sizes of the PCR
products, 706 bp for E0 of CCSYD, were observed as
clear electrophoretic band (Figure 3). The obtained E0
genes segment by sequencing has been deposited in
GeneBank under accession No. FJ55520. Alignment with
other 9 strains of BVDV, 7 strains of CSFV and 3 strains
of BDV in the world, showed that the homology were

98.6%-84.8%, 76.0%-74.7%, 76.6%-77.0% for nucleotide
sequence, respectively (Table 1), which shows that there
is no significant deviation of CCSYD E0 with conventional BVDV.
Phylogenetic analysis

To better understand the relationship of CCSYD to
other 9 strain of BVDV, 7 strains of CSFV and 3 strains
of BDV variants co-circulating in the word, genetic
sequences of Pestivirus from cattle, swine and ovine in
GenBank were used to construct phylogenetic trees. Figure 4 clearly showed that E0 genes of the CCSYD
belonged to BVDV1b.

Discussion
In the present study, CCSYD strain was isolated from
skia deer in Changchun city. By employing a series of
biochemical and biophysical methods, we have firstly
identified that CCSYD might be BVDV. The BVDV
can be classified into biotypes and genotypes [2]. Biotypes are based on the presence or absence of visible
CPE in infected cell cultures, cytopathic (CP) or noncytopathic (NCP) [2]. Genotype classification is based
on divergence in the viral genome sequences revealed
by phylogenetic analysis [11-15]. Based on phylogenetic comparison, the virus can be classified into two
genotypes: BVDV1 and BVDV2. Whereas BVDV1 has
a world-wide distribution, BVDV2 appears to be
highly prevalent only in North America [13,16] and
relatively rare in other continents [15,17]. Moreover,
recently the BVDV1 and BVDV2 genotypes have been
further divided into subgenotypes BVDV1a, BVDV1b,
BVDV2a, and BVDV2b in North American [18,19].
Genetic and phylogenetic analysis showed that the
virus belonged to BVDV1b. Similar strains contain the
VEDEVAC strain isolated Hungary, with 98.7%
homology for amino acid. Moreover, we have also
successfully cloned NS2/3 genes of CCSYD strain,
with 100% homology for amino acid and NS2/3 genes
of VEDEVAC strain, which further showed that
CCSYD strain and VEDEVAC strain belonged to
BVDV1b.

therefore, it is important to select the vaccine candidate
strain from control BVD from skia deer. Inactivated
CCSYD strain by a certain method might be employed
in preventing and counterchecking the skia deer BVD in
Jilin province. Moreover, selected E0 protein of CCSYD
construction a DNA vaccine might induce cellular
immune response and antibody responses specific for
BVD from skia deer. Therefore, isolation and identifcation of a skia deer bovine viral diarrhea virus (CCSYD)
contributes development new BVDV vaccine to prevent
and control of BVDV in sika deer.

Figure 2 Negatively stained BVDV.

The protection conferred by conventional inactivated
BVDV vaccines is strongly correlated with genetically
and antigenically of specific BVDV strain. In addition to,
an increasing frequency of skia deer with elevated antibody titers to BVDV suggests that exposure to field
strains has not been diminished despite the use of both
management and vaccine [6]. This suggests that current
vaccine may be inadequate in conferring skia deer protection against the acute disease in skia deer. Design of
efficacious vaccines must be based on specific BVDV
strain about the immune responses critical to development of protection. Hence, it is appropriate to guide the
selection of the vaccine strain according to the specific
BVDV strain from local area and similar strain, which
depend on further studies of BVDV from skia deer distribution and identification. There is currently no commercial skia deer BVDV vaccine used in China, and

Conclusions
The present study described the isolation and identifcation of a skia deer bovine viral diarrhea virus (CCSYD)
isolated from sick skia deer for the first time in China.
This study provided a detailed analysis of the genetic
and evolution of CCSYD which is likely to be helpful to
guide efficient diagnostic, preventive and control strategies against BVD from skia deer in China.
Materials and methods
Virus isolation

Field samples came from skia deer at field of Changchun (China), which might infected with BVDV according to clinical sign such as diarrhea and miscarriage and
stillbirth. Skia deer liver was collected from an aborted
fetus deer. A total of 1 g of fresh liver tissue was homogenized in 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, PH
7.2) and then repeated freeze thawed 3 times, and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min. A certain liver extract
was then inoculated onto MDBK monolayer cultures,
25 cm flasks with a 1 ml inoculum (1:10 dilution of
original samples) and the total volume was 5 ml. The
MDBK cultures were observed for 6 days with presence
or absences of CPE recorded. The cultures were frozen
at 70°C, thawed and supernatants collected after centrifugation with subsequent storage at 70°C. Uninoculated
cultures were included as negative controls and inoculated C24V as positive control.
Identification of virus

BVDV was detected by indirect immunoperoxidase test
(IPX) and electron microscopy technique (EM). For IPX,
the test was carried out on 96-well plates using lowpassage MDBK cells. Serum (20 μl) was added to each
of four wells before the addition of 100 μl of cell suspension. Positive and negative control sera were run on
each plate. The test plates were incubated for 4 days in
5% CO2, 37°C. Plates were fixed and dried, then stained
with immunoperoxidase as described by Meyling [20],
using a polyclonal bovine anti-BVDV serum (BVD virus
positive control serum, China) to detect the virus. The

PCR amplification and sequencing

Total RNA was isolated from infected MDBK cell using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen China) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and as described in the online
supplement. In short, 200 μl infected MDBK cell was
incubated with 1 ml TRIzol for 5 min at room temperature (RT). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation
(12,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min) and 0.4 ml chloroform
was added. After vortexing the mix was incubated for
5 min at RT. The phases were separated by centrifugation (12,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min) and the aqueous
phase was transferred to a new tube. 0.6 × volume of
isopropyl alcohol and a 0.1 × volume of 3 M sodium
acetate were added to this aqueous phase and incubated
for 10 min at 4°C. The precipitated RNA was pelleted
by centrifugation (12,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min) and
after the removal of the supernatant the RNA pellet was
washed twice with 70% ethanol. After drying, the RNA
was resuspended in 30 μl DEPC-treated water. Using
mRNA as template, single-stranded cDNAs were generated by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s directions. The E0 primer sequences were as follows: sense prime: 5’-CCGGA
