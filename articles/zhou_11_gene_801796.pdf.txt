Abstract
Background: One of the major tasks of the post-genomic era is “reading” genomic sequences in order to extract
all the biological information contained in them. Although a wide variety of techniques is used to solve the gene
finding problem and a number of prokaryotic gene-finding software are available, gene recognition in bacteria is
far from being always straightforward.
Results: This study reported a thorough search for new CDS in the two published Xcc genomes. In the first,
putative CDSs encoded in the two genomes were re-predicted using three gene finders, resulting in the
identification of 2850 putative new CDSs. In the second, similarity searching was conducted and 278 CDSs were
found to have homologs in other bacterial species. In the third, oligonucleotide microarray and RT-PCR analysis
identified 147 CDSs with detectable mRNA transcripts. Finally, in-frame deletion and subsequent phenotype
analysis of confirmed that Xcc_CDS002 encoding a novel SIR2-like domain protein is involved in virulence and
Xcc_CDS1553 encoding a ArsR family transcription factor is involved in arsenate resistance.
Conclusions: Despite sophisticated approaches available for genome annotation, many cellular transcripts have
remained unidentified so far in Xcc genomes. Through a combined strategy involving bioinformatic, postgenomic
and genetic approaches, a reliable list of 306 new CDSs was identified and a more thorough understanding of
some cellular processes was gained.

Background
Over the past two decades, we have witnessed the publication of more than 1,000 complete microbial genome
sequences (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/). The
trend towards genome sequencing is expected to continue or even accelerate in the near future. The wealth of
sequence information has greatly enhanced our understanding of bacterial physiology and biological processes
underlying the very organization of life. One of the major
tasks of the post-genomic era is “reading” genomic

sequences in order to extract all the biological information contained in them. An essential step in this quest is
the identification of protein-coding genes, with subsequent functional annotation of the corresponding gene
products [1]. A number of gene-finding methods have
been developed to address this problem from different
points of view. Generally, these gene-finding methods are
divided into two broad categories [2]. “Extrinsic” methods take into account information derived from similarity
search procedures [3]. “Intrinsic” methods, which deal
with DNA sequence only, use statistic or pattern recognition algorithms to find genes in DNA through detection
of specific motifs or global statistical patterns. For example, GeneMark employs a hidden Markov model (HMM)
to find genes [4-6] while GLIMMER employs an interpolated Markov model [7-9]. Although a wide variety of

techniques is used to solve the gene finding problem and
a number of prokaryotic gene-finding software are available, gene recognition in bacteria is far from being always
straightforward and there are still a lot of wrong or inaccurately annotated genes and missing genes in the published genomes [1,10-14]. A major reason for this
situation may be that genes can be tightly packed in prokaryotes, resulting in frequent overlap. Thus, detection of
translation initiation sites and/or selection of the correct
coding regions remain difficult [1]. In addition, it is now
well known that all microbial genomes contain an abundance of short genes [11,15]. For statistical reasons, the
longer the sequences, the easier it is to detect the codon
bias. The short length of these genes probably affects
both pillars of CDS prediction, namely intrinsic and
extrinsic approaches [11,16].
The Xanthomonas genus is one of the most ubiquitous groups of plant-associated bacterial pathogens.
Members of this genus have been shown to infect at
least 124 monocotyledonous and 268 dicotyledonous
plant species [17]. Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Pammel) Dowson (Xcc hereafter) is the causal
agent of black rot of crucifers, which is possibly the
most important disease of crucifers worldwide [18]. So
far, genomes of the three Xcc strains ATCC 33913,
8004, and B100 have been sequenced [14,19,20]. The
genome of Xcc strain ATCC33913 comprises a circular
chromosome of 5,076,187 bp encoding a total of 4181
predicted CDSs [19]. The genome of Xcc strain 8004
resides on a single circular chromosome of 5,148,708
bp, which encodes 4273 predicted CDSs [20]. Although
the majority of the genes encoded by the two genomes
were identical, a total of 108 and 62 CDSs unique to
Xcc 8004 and Xcc ATCC33913 were respectively identified [20]. In particular, analysis of the genome of Xcc
strain 8004 identified a total of 87 CDSs that have
homologs in Xcc ATCC33913, but were not annotated
by da Silva et al. [19]. Similarly, annotation of the recent
sequenced genome of Xcc B100 identified more than
200 additional CDSs that were not annotated in the
other two Xcc strains [14]. Although these newly identified CDSs need to be further verified, the findings suggest that there is still room for improvement in the state
of gene identification of Xcc genomes.
In this study, putative protein coding sequences in the
two genomes of the Xcc strains 8004 and ATCC33913
were re-predicted using the latest version of three geneprediction programs. A total of additional 2850 putative
new CDSs were identified. Based on the results of similarity searching, transcriptional pattern analysis and
functional analysis, a reliable list of 306 new CDSs was
obtained from this data set. The function of two newly
identified genes was further confirmed by gene deletion
and subsequent phenotype analysis.

Results
CDS re-prediction and identification of putative new CDSs

In this study, by using a combined strategy (Figure 1)
that the three well-established gene finders GLIMMER
(http://cbcb.umd.edu/software/glimmer) [8], GeneMark
[21], and ZCURVE [22] were respectively applied to predict putative protein coding sequences (CDSs) within
the two genomes of Xcc strains 8004 and ATCC33913
[19,20], a total of 7164 CDSs were identified after
further sequence analaysis (Figure 2). Among them,
4,314 CDSs, including 146 Xcc strain 8004-specific
CDSs, 60 ATCC33913-specific CDSs and 4108 shared
CDSs between the two genomes, have been previously
annotated (Figure 2A). The remaining 2850 predicted
CDSs have not been identified in the published two genomes and were defined as putative new CDSs (Figure
2A), including 1181 CDSs by GLIMMER, 957 CDSs by
GeneMark, and 612 CDSs by ZCURVE (Figure 2B).
Intriguingly, there were only 126 overlapping CDSs

Figure 2 Total CDSs identified in the genomes of Xcc strains 8004 and ATCC33913. (A) The location of all putative new CDSs relative to
existing neighbor CDSs on the chromosome of Xcc strain 8004 has been classified into four groups, indicated by I, II, III, and IV respectively on
the left. Group I indicates intergenic regions on the coding strand; II indicates intragenic regions on the coding strand, CDSs are partially or fully
overlapped with annotated CDSs, but they are in different reading frames; III indicates intergenic regions on the complementary strand; and IV
indicates intragenic regions on the complementary strand, CDSs are partially or fully overlapped with annotated CDSs, but they are in different
reading frames. Below the relative localization, the length distribution of the putative new CDSs is given in base pairs (BP). Numbers inside the
brackets indicate the number of CDSs. (B) A VENN diagram showing the overlapping of the CDSs predicted by GLIMMER, GeneMark, ZCURVE,

predicted by all the three gene finders (Figure 2B). The
size of these putative CDSs ranged from 90 to 4545 bps,
and most of them (2202 of 2850 CDSs) were less than 1
kb long (Figure 2A). In particular, 797 CDSs were less
than 180 bp in length. BLASTN analysis revealed that
2410 of the 2850 putative new CDSs were located at

intergenic regions of both strands (Figure 2A, indicated
by “I” and “III”) in the chromosome of Xcc strain 8004
(Figure 2A). The remaining 440 CDSs were partially or
fully overlapped with the annotated genes, but within
different reading frames (Figure 2A, indicated by “II”
and “IV”). All of 648 putative new CDSs >1000 bp in

length were either antisense or overlapping to the annotated genes in two Xcc genomes (Additional file 1).
Validation of new CDS by extrinsic evidence

The set of 2850 putative new CDSs was probably contaminated by pseudogene fragments and false-prediction artifacts because all the 3 gene finders are entirely based on
intrinsic evidence. To find true CDS, the next strategy
used in this study was to get support by extrinsic evidence.
All the putative new CDSs were blasted for similar entries
within the NCBI non-redundent database by means of
BLASTP. Based on the three criteria described in Materials and Methods, a total of 220 putative new CDSs were
found to be significantly similar to other protein sequences
in the database (Additional file 1).
More recently, the genome sequence of Xcc strain B100
has been published and the genome contained 496 additional CDSs [14]. About half of the these CDSs that were
identified by the combined use of the gene finders

GISMO [23] and REGANOR [24] were also present in
the genomes of Xcc strains 8004 and ATCC33913, but
have not been annotated [14]. Comparing the 2850 putative new CDSs identified in this study with the 496 additional CDSs in Xcc strain B100, we found an overlapping
72 CDSs (Additional file 1). Among them, 14 CDSs had
more than one homologs in non-redundant database and
have been included in the 220 putative new CDSs identified by similarity searching; the remaining 58 CDSs had
no homologs in non-redundant database except in Xcc
strain B100 and were also regarded as new CDSs in this
study (Additional file 1). Taken together, a total of 278
CDSs were screened out of 2850 putative new CDSs by
extrinsic evidence.
The majority of these CDSs (240 of 278) encodes conserved hypothetical proteins or hypothetical proteins
(Figure 3). Eleven CDSs (Xcc_CDS105, Xcc_CDS107,

Xcc_CDS2691) encode putative phenol hydroxylases and
another 2 CDSs (Xcc_CDS2201 and Xcc_CDS2211)
encode putative 50S ribosomal proteins. The remaining 20

(Figure 3; Additional file 1).
Transcription analysis for new CDS

An alternative approach to validate a CDS is to detect
the transcribed mRNA. An oligonucleotide microarray
chip, which contains 50-mer oligos specific for 4080
annotated CDSs and 8 negative controls, has been successfully used to analyze the DSF regulon, Clp regulon
and RavR regulon in Xcc [25-27]. In this study, a new
microarray chip with the above-mentioned oligos and
additional oligos specific for the 1724 putative new
CDSs was constructed. This microarray chip was used
to detect transcripts of the putative new CDSs. To
detect transcripts under different conditions, total
RNA was extracted from cell culture grown under the
following conditions: (i) different cell density: OD600 =
1.0, 1.6 and 2.0; (ii) different genetic backgrounds:
ΔrpfF strain, ΔrpfC, Δclp and ΔravR [25-27]; (iii) different media: rich YEB medium and poor NYG medium. By using the screening procedures described in
Materials and Methods, 147 putative new CDSs were
found with detectable transcripts (Figure 4A; Additional file 1). Further analysis revealed that 75 CDSs
were constitutively expressed during the growth and
the remaining 72 CDSs were only expressed at high
cell density (OD600 = 2.0) (Figure 4A). Comparing the

CDS are constitutively expressed at OD600 = 1.0, 1.6 and 2.0 during

levels of these CDS at OD600 = 2.0 are significantly lower in ΔrpfF,
ΔrpfC, or Δclp strains than those in wild type. NYG-induced

global gene expression profiles of Xcc wild type, rpfF,
rpfC, and clp deletion mutants, we found that the transcription of 15 high cell density-dependent CDSs was
also positively regulated by the quorum sensing signal
DSF [25]. The expression levels of these CDSs in
an rpfF deletion mutant were respectively 2.7 to 5.2
times lower than those in the wild type XC1 strain

(Figure 4B). The transcription of Xcc_CDS2497 was
only induced in poor NYG medium at higher density
(OD600 = 2.0) (Figure 4A).
In order to go further in the validation of our microarray-based method for selecting true CDS, and as we
are more interested in DSF signal-regulated CDSs, we
chose the 15 DSF signal-regulated CDSs for further
transcriptional analysis by reverse transcription PCR.
The products of 11 CDSs could be amplified by using
total RNAs extracted from cell culture at OD600 = 2.0
(Figure 4B). The resultant RT-PCR products were
further verified by sequencing analysis (data not shown).
RT-PCR analysis also verified the transcriptional difference of the 11 new CDSs between wild type and rpfF
deletion mutant (Figure 4B).
Total new CDSs identified by similarity searching and
transcriptional analysis

While extrinsic evidence supported the presence of 278
new CDSs, and while transcriptional analysis indicated
147 new CDSs with detectable transcripts, a comparison
of the two sets of new CDSs revealed a total of 119
overlapping CDSs that were identified by both
approaches (Figure 5). Thus, a total of 306 (278+147119) CDSs got support by extrinsic evidence or/and
experimentally transcriptional analysis, suggesting that
they are probably true CDSs. The remaining 2544 putative new CDSs failed to get support by extrinsic evidence or transcriptional analysis (Figure 5). Two of the
overlapping 119 CDSs, Xcc_CDS002 and Xcc_CDS1553,
which both encoded putative transcription factors, were
chosen for further experimental characterization. The
results are presented in the following sections.

Xcc_CDS002 encodes a SIR2-like domain protein and is
associated with virulence on Chinese cabbage

Xcc_CDS002 is a new CDS of 855 bps in length. It
encodes a protein with a conserved silent information
regulator 2 (SIR-2) or SIR2-like domain (Figure 6A),
which has been found to confer NAD-dependent protein
deacetylase activity in eukaryotes [28,29]. For the convenience of discussion, Xcc_CDS002 was renamed as sir2x
for SIR2-like protein gene in Xanthomonas campestris
in this study. The DNA sequence of sir2x was found in
all the 3 published Xcc genomes and in Xcc strain XC1
(Figure 6C). In the genome of Xcc strain 8004, sir2x is

flanked by XC_4281 and XC_4282 (Figure 6A), which
respectively encode a phage-related regulatory protein
cII and a hypothetical protein. Sir2x and XC_4281 share
the same transcriptional orientation and are separated
by only one base pair (Figure 6B). Further RT-PCR analysis confirmed that sir2x and XC_4281 are transcribed
as an operon (Figure 6C). To further study its role in
Xcc, the coding region (33 to 280 aa) of sir2x was in
frame deleted in the chromosome of Xcc strain XC1 and
the resultant mutant was named as Δsir2x. Deletion of
sir2x did not affect the production of virulence factors,
including extracellular protease, extracellular cellulase,
and EPS (data not shown), but significantly reduced
virulence of Xcc strain XC1 on Chinese cabbage (Figure
6D). Complementation of the mutant with the sir2x
coding region resulted in the complete recovery of virulence to wild-type level (Figure 6E).

Xcc_CDS1553 encodes a 122-aa protein with a conserved
HTH_ARSR domain (Figure 7A), which occurs in arsenical resistance operon repressors and similar prokaryotic,
metal-regulated homodimeric repressors that belong to
the ArsR superfamily of bacterial transcription-regulatory
proteins [30,31]. For the convenience of discussion, this
CDS was renamed as arsR. Interestingly, arsR was only
found in the genome of Xcc strain 8004, not in Xcc
strains ATCC33913 and B100. In the Xcc 8004 genome,
arsR is located upstream of XC_2295 and XC_2294,
which respectively encode a putative high-affinity Fe2+/
Pb2+ permease and an arsenite efflux pump AcR3 (Figure
7B). arsR and XC_2295 were separated by 64 bps and the
gap between XC_2294 and XC_2295 was 83 bps (Figure
7B; 20). Further RT-PCR analysis showed that arsR,
XC_2295, and XC_2294 belong to the same operon (Figure 7C), suggesting that ArsR, XC_2294 and XC_2295
might be functionally related. To further confirm this
hypothesis, an arsR in frame deletion mutant termed
ΔarsR was generated in Xcc strain 8004. The results
showed that the ΔarsR strain was much more sensitive to
arsenate than the wild type strain (Figure 7D). On LB
plates with 0.5 mM arsenate, the wild type strain Xcc
8004 grew well, while in contrast, the deletion mutant
did not grow at all on this medium (Figure 7E). The
mutant phenotype could be reverted by complementation
with a plasmid carrying the coding region of arsR,
demonstrating that the observed phenotype was due to
arsR.

interpolated Markov model (IMM), a generalization of
Markov chain methods [8]. The GeneMark program is
an ab initio gene finder, which employs inhomogeneous
(three-periodic) Markov chain models describing protein-coding DNA and homogeneous Markov chain models describing non-coding DNA [6]. ZCURVE is a
system for recognizing protein-coding genes in bacterial
genome, which uses the “Z-transformation” of DNA as
information source for classification [22]. The results

Zhou et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:359
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/359

showed that 99.7% of the CDSs (4168 of 4181) in the
existing annotations of strain ATCC33913 and 99.5% of
the CDSs (4254 of 4273) of strain 8004 could be predicted by the combined strategy (Figure 2A), suggesting
that the combined gene finding strategy works well for
finding currently annotated genes in Xcc genomes. In
addition to the CDSs in the existing annotations of Xcc
genomes, a total of 2850 putative new CDSs were identified in the two Xcc genomes by the combined gene
prediction strategy. Among them, 306 reliable new
CDSs were further confirmed by subsequent analysis
based on extrinsic similarity or/and transcript detection,
suggesting that the combined gene finding strategy
could be used for finding new CDS in bacterial genomes. Considering the number of putative CDSs predicted and those having been confirmed by extrinsic
evidence and/or microarray analysis (Figure 2B), GLIMMER seems more powerful than GeneMark and
ZCURVE in new CDS prediction.
Microarrays traditionally have been used to analyze the
expression behavior of large numbers of annotated genes
in bacteria. In this study, microarray analysis, applied
together with CDS prediction, was used to find new genes,
which was further validated by RT-PCR analysis. Compared to other transcript detection methods, microarray
analysis is more sensitive and suitable for highthroughput
analysis. So far, a similar strategy has only been reported
for Escherichia coli. Selinger et al. [32] introduced a highdensity oligonucleotide probe array for E. coli that not
only carries strand-specific probes for all mRNA, tRNA,
and rRNA regions, but also covers intergenic regions of
>40 bp. Using E. coli RNA from cells grown on different
media, over 1100 transcripts corresponding to intergenic
regions were identified. Further classification revealed 317
novel transcripts with unknown function [33].
SIR2 proteins are found in organisms ranging from
bacteria to humans [28]. In eukaryotes, SIR2 proteins
regulate transcriptional repression, recombination, the
cell division cycle, microtubule organization, cellular
responses to DNA-damaging agents and aging [28,29]. A
phylogenetically conserved NAD + -dependent protein
deacetylase activity has been demonstrated in Sir2 family
proteins in eukaryotes [34-36]. So far very limited evidence is available regarding the function of SIR-2 proteins in bacteria. The only reported case was from
Salmonella typhimurium, where the gene cobB is
involved in the biosynthesis of cobalamin and the catabolism of propionate [37]. Further analysis revealed that the
recombinant SIR2 protein CobB had NAD-dependent
ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in vitro [38]. The demonstration that the ribosyltransferase and NAD+-dependent
protein deacetylase activities are both dependent on an
acetylated substrate confirms the fundamental link
between the two activities [29]. The true enzymatic

activity of Sir2x and how Sir2x is involved in the regulation of virulence in Chinese cabbage remains to be dissolved. The involvement of sir2x in virulence of Xcc
strain XC1 is in good agreement with previous findings
that transposon insertion in the promoter region of
XC4281 encoding a phage-related regulatory protein cII
led to a complete loss of virulence of Xcc strain 8004 on
radish [20]. As shown in Figure 6, XC4281 and the newly
identified sir2x are within the same operon and they
share a common promoter. Transposon insertion in the
promoter region probably disrupts not only the expression of XC4281, but also the expression of sir2x. The
roles of Sir2x in Xcc virulence remains to be dissolved.
Arsenic, a toxic metalloid, is currently and has always
been ranked first on the Superfund List of Hazardous
Substances (available on the World Wide Web), in part
because of its environmental ubiquity. As a consequence,
many bacterial species have genes that confer resistance
to arsenic. Environmental arsenic is sensed by members
of the ArsR/SmtB family of metalloregulatory transcriptional repressors [30,39], which represses the expression
of operons involved in the uptake, efflux, sequestration,
or detoxification of metal ions [40]. This study identified
an ArsR family repressor and found that the XC2294XC2295-arsR operon is involved in arsenate resistance in
Xcc strain 8004. Since no ArsR homologs were found in
Xcc strains ATCC33913, B100 and XC1, we propose that
the arsR may have been acquired by Xcc strain 8004 in a
lateral gene transfer event.

Conclusions
This study reported a thorough search for new CDS in the
two published Xcc genomes. In the first, putative CDSs
encoded in the two genomes were re-predicted using three
gene finders, resulting in the identification of 2850 putative
new CDSs. In the second, similarity searching was conducted and 278 CDSs were found to have homologs in
other bacterial species. In the third, oligonucleotide microarray and RT-PCR analysis identified 147 CDSs with
detectable mRNA transcripts. Finally, in-frame deletion and
subsequent phenotype analysis of the two newly identified
CDSs confirmed their functionality. Our results showed
that, despite sophisticated approaches available for genome
annotation, many cellular transcripts have remained unidentified so far in Xcc genomes. Through a combined strategy involving bioinformatic, postgenomic and genetic
approaches as demonstrated in this study, a reliable list of
306 new CDSs was identified and a more thorough understanding of some cellular processes was gained.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

Xcc strains XC1 and 8004 were grown at 30°C with
shaking (250 rpm/min) in YEB, LB or NYG medium as

Zhou et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:359
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/359

described by He et al. [25]. E. coli strains were grown at
37°C in LB medium. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations when required: kanamycin,
100 μg/ml, rifampicin, 25 μg/ml, and tetracycline,
10 μg/ml.
Nucleotide sequence source, gene prediction and domain
analysis

Complete genome records of the Xcc strains ATCC33913
and 8004 [19,20] were downloaded from the NCBI
Microbial genome database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/genomes/lproks.cgi?view=1). Gene prediction was
conducted by the gene finders GLIMMER 2.03 [8], GeneMark [21] and ZCURVE [22]. For the prediction, the
minimum length of CDS was set as 90 bp. BLASTN
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was used to find
the locations of all the putative new CDSs in the genomes
of Xcc strain 8004 and ATCC33913. Multiple sequence
alignment analysis was performed using CLUSTAL W
(1.83) (http://sbcr.bii.a-star.edu.sg/clustalw/). Domain
architecture analysis was performed using the SMART
database application (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/).
The nucleic acid sequences of two well-studied regulator
sir2x and arsR have been deposited in the NCBI GeneBank database and the accession numbers are JF966390
and JF966391.

microarray chip preparation. Oligonucleotides were
synthesized at a 50 nmol scale by Operon Technologies
(Alameda, CA, USA). The protocol employed for constructing the oligo-chip has been previously described
[25]. Briefly, all oligos were dissolved in saline sodium
citrate buffer (3 × SSC) to a final concentration of
40 μM. Oligo samples were arrayed with Pixsys 5500XL
Arrayer (Cartesian) to poly-L-Lysine-coated microscope
slides. DNA samples were fixed by rehydration, snap-drying and UV cross-linking. The remaining poly-L-Lysine
on the slides was rendered non-reactive by treatment
with blocking solution (150 mM succinic anhydride in
1-methy-2-pyrrolidinone, buffered with 85 mM sodium
borate, pH 8.0) for 30 min. After washing with water, the
array plates were rinsed with 95% ethanol and dried.
Isolation of total RNA and microarray analysis

The amino acid sequences of all 2850 putative new
CDSs were submitted for BLASTP analysis. Homologs
in the nr database were selected on the basis of the following three criteria. Firstly, only the subjects with
E-values lower than 10-4 were considered hits. Secondly,
the subjects should have similar sizes as the queries.
Thirdly, for each query there should be more than one
matched subject unless the E-value is very low (less
than 10-30).

Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 4°C for 5
min at 10,000 rpm. Total RNA samples were prepared by
using RNeasy midi columns following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen). RNA integrity was confirmed by
electrophoresis using a 1.3% formaldehyde agrose gel. The
quality of DNA-free RNA was monitored by PCR and RTPCR analysis of at least two known genes. Cy3- or Cy5labeled cDNA was generated by using random hexamers
as primers for reverse transcription (Invitrogen). cDNA
labeling, purification and hybridization against the microarray were conducted as previously described [25]. Slides
were scanned for the fluorescent intensity using a ScanArray 5000 laser scanner. The signal intensities were quantified by using the software ImaGene 5 (BioDiscovery).
Hybridization signals were normalized using the scale normalization procedure previously described [25]. Each
treatment was repeated three times and the data presented
were the means of two representative replicates. The fold
changes were then calculated from the normalized log
ratios.

Design and synthesis of CDS-specific oligonucleotides,
and preparation of Xcc oligo microarray chip

Screening new CDS by statistical analysis of microarray
hybridization signal intensity

Based on the annotated genome sequences of the Xcc
strains ATCC33913 and 8004 [19,20], we used a CDSspecific oligonucleotide selection algorithm [41] to successfully design unique 50-mer oligonucleotides for 1724
putative new CDSs. The majority of these CDSs were
more than 300 bps in length. As specificity controls, 50mer oligonucleotides were also designed based on the
sinat5 (NCBI No.: AF480944) and nac1 (NCBI No.:
AF198054) genes of Arabidopsis thaliana, and the genes
rag1 (NCBI No.: NM_131389) of zebrafish and the olf1
(NCBI No.:U56420) of Homo sapiens [25]. Thus, a total
of 5770 CDS-specific oligonucleotides representing 4042
annotated CDS [25], plus 1724 putative new CDSs, and 4
specificity controls were used for the oligonucleotide

In this study, oligonucleotide microarray analysis was
used to detect transcription, so as to confirm the functionality of the putative new CDSs. The putative CDSs
with detectable transcript was identified using the normalized signal median of the corresponding probe. To
calculate the normalized signal median, firstly the average
signal median S0 of 8 negative control probes representing 4 Arabidopsis and zebrafish genes [25] was determined by using the following formula: S0 = ∑(SAZ-BAZ)/
8, where SAZ indicates the signal median of the negative
control probe and BAZ indicates the corresponding background signal median. Secondly, the normalized signal
median (S) of the putative new CDSs was calculated following the formula: S = S CDS - B CDS -S 0 , where S CDS

indicates the signal median of the putative new CDS and
BCDS indicates the background median of the putative
new CDSs. Finally, if S >0, it is regarded as CDS with
detectable transcript.
Reverse transcription (RT) PCR analysis

®

RT-PCR analysis was conducted using a QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers used for RT-PCR analysis are listed
in Additional file1. Total RNAs were extracted from
bacterial culture grown in YEB medium at OD600 = 2.0
and a total of 200 ng of total RNA was used for reverse
transcription. The cycle number differed in the amplification of different CDS products.
Generation of in-frame deletion mutants and
complementation analysis

Spontaneous rifampicin-resistant derivatives of strain
XC1 or 8004 were used as parental strains for generation
of deletion mutants. In-frame deletion of Xcc_CDS002
(sir2x) and Xcc_CDS1553 (arsR) was conducted using the
primers listed in Additional file 1 following the methods
described previously [25]. For complementation analysis,
the coding regions of sir2x and arsR respectively were
amplified by PCR using the primers listed in Additional
file 1 and cloned under the control of lac promoter in
expression vector pLAFR3. The resultant constructs were
transferred into Xcc strains through triparental mating.
Quantitative determination of extracellular enzyme
activity, EPS production and virulence test

The extracellular cellulase and protease activity and EPS
production in the culture supernatants of Xcc strains at
OD600 = 2.3 were measured according to the methods
described previously [25]. The virulence of Xcc to Chinese
cabbage was determined following the scissors-clipping
method described previously [26]. Fifteen plants were
inoculated for each bacterial strain and the experiment
was repeated three times.
Arsenate resistance assay

Sodium arsenate (SIGMA) was added in the following
final concentrations (mM): 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and
1.00. Fifty microliters of fresh culture of Xcc strain 8004
were inoculated into 5 ml of NYG liquid media with
rifampicin (25 μg/ml) and sodium arsenate at different
concentrations and grown at 28°C with shaking (250
rpm/min) for overnight. Bacterial growth was indicated
by measuring the optical density at 600 nm.
