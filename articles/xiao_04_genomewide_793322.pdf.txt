Abstract
Background: Defensins comprise a large family of cationic antimicrobial peptides that are
characterized by the presence of a conserved cysteine-rich defensin motif. Based on the spacing
pattern of cysteines, these defensins are broadly divided into five groups, namely plant,
invertebrate, α-, β-, and θ-defensins, with the last three groups being mostly found in mammalian
species. However, the evolutionary relationships among these five groups of defensins remain
controversial.
Results: Following a comprehensive screen, here we report that the chicken genome encodes a
total of 13 different β-defensins but with no other groups of defensins being discovered. These
chicken β-defensin genes, designated as Gallinacin 1–13, are clustered densely within a 86-Kb
distance on the chromosome 3q3.5-q3.7. The deduced peptides vary from 63 to 104 amino acid
residues in length sharing the characteristic defensin motif. Based on the tissue expression pattern,
13 β-defensin genes can be divided into two subgroups with Gallinacin 1–7 being predominantly
expressed in bone marrow and the respiratory tract and the remaining genes being restricted to
liver and the urogenital tract. Comparative analysis of the defensin clusters among chicken, mouse,
and human suggested that vertebrate defensins have evolved from a single β-defensin-like gene,
which has undergone rapid duplication, diversification, and translocation in various vertebrate
lineages during evolution.
Conclusions: We conclude that the chicken genome encodes only β-defensin sequences and that
all mammalian defensins are evolved from a common β-defensin-like ancestor. The α-defensins
arose from β-defensins by gene duplication, which may have occurred after the divergence of
mammals from other vertebrates, and θ-defensins have arisen from α-defensins specific to the
primate lineage. Further analysis of these defensins in different vertebrate lineages will shed light
on the mechanisms of host defense and evolution of innate immunity.

Background
Defensins constitute a large family of small, cysteine-rich,
cationic peptides that are capable of killing a broad spectrum of pathogens, including various bacteria, fungi, and
certain enveloped viruses [1-5]. These peptides play a critical role in host defense and disease resistance by protecting the hosts against infections. Transgenic mice
expressing human enteric defensin HD5 are fully protected against the doses of Salmonella typhimurium that are
otherwise lethal to the wide-type mice [6]. Conversely,
mice deficient in the matrilysin gene, which is responsible
for activating enteric defensins, become more susceptible
to oral infection with S. typhimurium [7].
Defensins have been identified in species ranging from
plants, insects to animals and humans [1-5]. Characterized by the presence of 6–8 cysteine residues in relatively
defined positions, all defensins are structurally related in
that they form 3–4 intramolecular disulfide bonds and 2–
3 antiparallel β-sheets with or without an α-helix. Based
on the spacing pattern of cysteines, these peptides are
broadly divided into five groups; namely plant, invertebrate, α-, β-, and θ-defensins [1-5]. Alignment of all
known defensin sequences revealed the consensus
defensin motif of each group as follows: plant defensin: CX8–11-C-X3–5-C-X3-C-X9–12-C-X4–11-C-X1-C-X3-C; invertebrate defensin: C-X5–16-C-X3-C-X9–10-C-X4–7-C-X1-C; αdefensin: C-X1-C-X3–4-C-X9-C-X6–10-C-C; and β-defensin:
C-X4–8-C-X3–5-C-X9–13-C-X4–7-C-C. The α- and β-defensins
are unique to vertebrate animals with α-defensins only
being found in rodents and primates, while β-defensins
are present in all mammalian species investigated [1-3].
On the other hand, θ-defensins have only been found in
certain primates as a result of posttranslational ligation of
two α-defensin-like sequences [8-10]. A pseudogene for θdefensin is also present in humans [11].
Analysis of human and mouse genomes indicated that βdefensins form 4–5 distinct clusters on different chromosomes with each cluster consisting of multiple defensin
genes [12]. Interestingly, the single mammalian αdefensin locus is located on a β-defensin cluster with θdefensins residing in the center of α-defensins [12]. Studies with mammalian defensins suggested a rapid duplication followed by positive selection and diversification
within each group [13-18]. However, the evolutionary
relationships among three groups of mammalian
defensins and among plant, invertebrate, and mammalian defensins remain controversial. Similarity in spatial
structure and biological functions favors the notion that
all mammalian defensins are evolutionarily related [19],
although a phylogenetic analysis suggested a closer relationship between β- and insect defensins than between αand β-defensins [16].

Existence of a large number of expressed sequence tag
(EST) sequences and recent completion of chicken
genome sequencing at a 6.6× coverage [20] provided a
timely opportunity to discover a complete repertoire of
defensin-related sequences in birds for studying the evolutionary relationship between invertebrate and mammalian defensins. Here we report identification of a single βdefensin cluster that is composed of 13 genes located on
the chicken chromosome 3q3.5-q3.7. Evolutionary and
comparative analyses of these chicken β-defensins with
mammalian homologues strongly suggested that all
mammalian defensins have evolved from a common βdefensin-like ancestor, which has undergone rapid duplication, positive diversifying selection, and chromosomal
translocations, thereby giving rising to multiple gene clusters on different chromosomal regions.

Results and Discussion
Discovery of novel chicken defensins
To identify novel defensin genes in the chicken, all five
groups of known defensin-like peptide sequences from
plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates were first queried
individually against the translated chicken nonredundant
(NR), EST, high throughput genomic sequence (HTGS),
and whole-genome shortgun sequence (WGS) databases
in the GenBank by using the TBLASTN program[21]. All
potential hits were then examined manually for the presence of the characteristic cysteine motifs. For every novel
defensin identified, additional iterative BLAST searches
were performed until no more novel sequences could be
found. In addition to three known chicken β-defensins
(Gal 1–3) [22,23], nine novel putative sequences, namely
Gal 4–12, have been found in the EST database with at
least two hits for each, and such sequences have also been
confirmed in genomic sequences (Table 1). Because of the
fact that mammalian defensins tend to form clusters
[12,14,15,18], all chicken HTGS and WGS sequences containing defensin sequences were also retrieved from GenBank, translated into six open reading frames, and
manually curated. As a result, an additional putative βdefensin, Gal13, was identified in several genomic clones
(Table 1). The open reading frame of Gal13 was predicted
by GENSCAN [24] and confirmed by directly sequencing
of RT-PCR product amplified from chicken kidney.

No other sequence containing β-defensin-like six-cysteine
motif has been found in NR, EST or genomic databases,
suggesting that 13 Gal genes constitute the entire repertoire of the β-defensin family encoded in the chicken
genome. Although it is highly unlikely, we could not rule
out the possibility that additional defensin-related genes
with distant homology might be uncovered in the chicken
by different computational search methods such as the
use of Hidden Markov models [12,15]. It is noted that
none of other groups of defensins have been discovered in

EST sequence entry is given only for the exemplary purpose. In each case, more than two independent EST sequences have been found,
except for Gal3 and Gal13, both of which have no EST sequences. Gal3 was found through homology cloning [23], and Gal13 was predicted by us
from the genomic sequence. 3 All Gal genes are predicted to consist of four exons separated by three introns, except for Gal12, whose last two
exons are fused together. The absence of additional sequence information at the 5'-untranslated regions of the cDNA sequences prevented
prediction of the sizes of first exon and intron for Gal 3–5 and Gal 9–13 genes.

the chicken, indicating that plant, invertebrate, α-, and θdefensins are absent in the chicken lineage.
Similar to Gal 1–3, 10 novel β-defensins, deduced from
either EST or genomic sequences, vary from 63 to 104
amino acid residues in length. Alignment of these peptides revealed a conservation of the signal sequence at the
N-terminus and the characteristic six-cysteine defensin
motif at the C-terminus (Figure 1). Consistent with the
fact that all β-defensins are a group of secreted molecules
in response to infections, the signal sequences of all
chicken defensins are hydrophobic and rich in leucines. In
addition, the mature C-terminal sequences are all positively charged due to the presence of excess arginines and
lysines. Interestingly, Gal11 contains two tandem, but
highly divergent, copies of the six-cysteine motif at the Cterminus, and is the only defensin having such sequences.
Functional significance for existence of such two defensin
motifs remains to be studied.
Evolutionary analysis of vertebrate β-defensins
Phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate β-defensins showed
that chicken defensins clustered with various different
groups of mammalian β-defensins (Figure 2). However,
the bootstrap support for these patterns was very weak
(less than 50% in all cases). The clustering of certain
chicken β-defensins with mammalian homologues suggests that major subfamilies of β-defensins arose before

the last common ancestor of birds and mammals, estimated to have occurred about 310 million years ago [25].
This in turn implies that some duplication of β-defensin
genes must have taken place before the divergence of birds
and mammals. The apparent lack of α-defensins in the
chicken and other non-mammalian species (G. Zhang,
unpublished data) suggests that α-defensins may have
evolved after mammals diverged from other vertebrates.
Comparison of the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions provides a powerful
test of the hypothesis that positive Darwinian selection
has acted to favor changes at the amino acid level [26].
This approach has previously been applied to both α- and
β-defensins of mammals and has revealed positive selection acting on the mature defensin but not on other
regions of the gene [16,17]. In the comparison of the
chicken β-defensin sequences, synonymous sites were saturated with changes or nearly so, making it impossible to
test the hypothesis of positive selection in every case. In
pairwise comparisons among all sequences, mean pS in
the propeptide region was 0.551 ± 0.036 (S.E.), while
mean pN was 0.369 ± 0.040. In the mature defensin
region, mean pS was 0.673 ± 0.027, while mean pN was
0.534 ± 0.051. Mean pN in the mature defensin was significantly greater than that in the propeptide (z-test; P <
0.05), indicating lesser functional constraint on the
amino acid sequence of the former. The high mean pS

shows that chicken β-defensin genes have not duplicated
recently, unlike β-defensin genes of the bovine [16]. In the
comparison between the most closely related pair of
sequences (Gal6 and Gal7), mean pS in the mature
defensin was 0.221 ± 0.082, while mean pN was 0.331 ±
0.076. While these values are not significantly different at
the 5% level, the fact that pN was higher than pS suggested
that positive selection may have acted to diversify the
mature defensin region between these two genes.
Genomic organization and chromosomal localization of
the chicken β-defensin gene cluster
Searching through HTGS database led to identification of
two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
sequences, TAM31-54I5 (accession no. AC110874) and
CH261-162O9 (accession no. AC146292), both of which
were sequenced and deposited earlier by one of us (J.F.
Chen). Alignment of these two sequences allowed to reorder three DNA fragments in AC110874 and to construct
a continuous, gap-free genomic contig that includes 11
Gal genes except for Gal4 and Gal5. Later search of chicken

WGS sequences released on February 29, 2004 confirmed
the order of the genomic contig that we assembled and
also revealed the locations of two remaining genes, Gal4
and Gal5, both of which reside on a WGS (accession no.
AADN01058096) that overlaps with AC110874 (Figure
3). The position and orientation of each Gal gene were
obtained by comparing its cDNA with the assembled
DNA sequence. As shown in Figure 3, all 13 Gal genes
were clustered densely within a distance of 86.0 Kb on the
genome. It was also confirmed by aligning such a contig
with the chicken genome assembly, in which 13 Gal genes
are located on six WGS contigs (Table 1) of chromosome
3 that are only ~3.3 Mb from the distal end. Consistent
with this, the Gal gene cluster was physically mapped to
the tip of chicken chromosome 3 at the region of q3.5q3.7 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using
the TAM31-54I5 BAC DNA as probe (Figure 4).
Comparing the cDNA with genomic sequences also
revealed the structure of each Gal gene. Unlike most mammalian β-defensin genes, which primarily consist of two

exons and one intron, the Gal genes were found to be
composed of four short exons separated by three introns
with variable lengths ranging from 117 bp to 3,322 bp
(Table 1). Gal12 is an exception, in which the last two
exons have been fused together. While the first exon of the
Gal genes encodes 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and the
majority of the last exon encodes 3'-UTR as well as a few
C-terminal amino acids, two internal exons resemble
mammalian β-defensin genes in that one exon encodes
the signal and pro-sequence and the other encodes the
mature sequence with six-cysteine motif [19,27-29].
Apparently, the first two and the last two exons of the Gal
genes have joined together during the evolution as a result
of exon shuffling, which occurred in many other evolutionarily conserved gene families [30], including invertebrate defensins [5]. The fusion of defensin exons in
mammals is presumably adaptive because it allows a
faster mobilization of such host defense molecules to better cope with invading microbes.
Tissue expression patterns of chicken β-defensins
It has been shown that Gal1 and Gal2 are expressed in
bone marrow and lung, while Gal3 is more preferentially
expressed in bone marrow, tongue, trachea, and bursa of
Fabricius [23]. To study the tissue expression patterns of
novel Gal genes that we identified, RT-PCR was performed
with a panel of 32 different chicken tissues. Similar to Gal
1–3, Gal 4–7 are highly restricted to bone marrow cells
with Gal5 also expressed in tongue, trachea, lung, and
brain at lower levels (Figure 5). By contrast, the six
remaining genes, Gal 8–13, were not found in bone
marrow, but instead in liver, kidney, testicle, ovary, and
male and female reproductive tracts (Figure 5). These
results clearly suggested that all chicken β-defensin genes
can be divided into two subgroups. Seven genes (Gal 1–7)
are predominantly expressed in bone marrow and the respiratory tract, whereas the other six genes (Gal 8–13) are
more restricted to liver and the urogenital tract. However,
the functional significance and transcriptional regulatory
mechanisms of these genes during inflammation and
infection remain to be investigated.
Comparative analysis of chicken and mammalian βdefensin gene clusters
To study the origin and evolution of mammalian
defensins, a comparative analysis of β-defensin gene clusters in the chicken, mouse, and human was performed by
employing additional, more phylogenetically conserved
gene markers surrounding the defensin clusters. As shown
in Figure 6, two genes, CTSB (Cathepsin B, accession no.
NP_680093) and a human EST sequence (accession no.
BE072524) immediately located centromeric to chicken
defensins, were also found to be conserved in the defensin
gene clusters on human chromosome 8p22 and mouse
chromosome 14C3. Similarly, another gene, HARL2754

overlapping genomic clones that were used to assemble the continuous, gap-free contig. The position of each gene is represented by a solid vertical bar and the width of each bar is proportional to the size of each gene. The direction of transcription
is indicated by the triangle above each gene. The genes with solid triangles are transcribed in the direction opposite to the ones
with open triangles. Slanted lines refer to the sequences omitted. Note that the three fragments of AC110874 sequence have
been re-ordered and the gaps have been filled following alignment with AC146292.

(accession no. XP_372011) that is 6-Kb telemetric to Gal4
is also conserved in another defensin cluster in human
(8p23) or mouse (8A1.3) (Figure 6).
These results strongly suggested that all vertebrate βdefensins are evolved from a single gene. This conclusion
is further supported by the fact that there are three highly
similar β-defensin-like sequences present in the largely
finished zebrafish genome (G. Zhang, unpublished data).
In addition, a group of homologous β-defensin-like
sequences, namely crotamine and myotoxins, have been
found in several Crotalus snakes [31], which are presumably derived from a single ancestral gene. The appearance
of multiple β-defensin gene clusters on different chromosomal regions in mammalian species [12] is apparently a
result of rapid gene duplication, positive diversifying
selection, and chromosomal translocation following
divergence of mammals from other vertebrate lineages.
In addition to the structural conservation between βdefensin-like sequences in the rattlesnake and mammals
[32], a growing body of evidence suggests that their functions appear to be largely conserved in that both are capable of interacting negatively-charged lipid membranes
followed by formation of ion channels or pores [32-34].
It is noteworthy that the conservation of Cathepsin B
(CTSB) adjacent to β-defensins is perhaps not surprising,
given the recent finding that cathepsins are involved in the
cleavage and inactivation of β-defensins [35].

Conclusions
We have showed that chicken genome encodes a total of
13 different β-defensin genes clustered densely within a
86-Kb distance on the chromosome 3q3.5-q3.7, but with

no α-defensin genes. These peptides exhibit homology to
different subgroups of mammalian β-defensins-, consistent with the hypothesis that α-defensins and β-defensins
arose by gene duplication after the divergence of birds and
mammals. The θ-defensins are specific to primates; and
thus appear to have arisen from α-defensins by gene
duplication specific to the primate lineage. Apparently,
the evolution of defensins is rapid and driven by duplication and positive diversifying selection. Collectively, this
study represents the first large-scale detailed investigation
of defensins in non-mammalian vertebrates. There is no
doubt that further analysis of these defensin genes will
lead to a better understanding of host defense mechanisms and evolution of innate immunity.

Methods
Computational search for novel chicken defensins
To identify novel defensins in the chicken, all known
cysteine-containing defensin-like peptide sequences
discovered in plants, invertebrates, birds, and mammals
were individually queried against the translated chicken
NR, EST, HTGS, and WGS databases in the GenBank by
using the TBLASTN program [21] with default settings on
the NCBI web site [36]. All potential hits were then examined for the presence of the characteristic defensin motif.
For every novel defensin identified, additional iterative
BLAST searches were performed until no more novel
sequences could be revealed. Because mammalian
defensins tend to form clusters [12,14,15,18], all chicken
genomic sequences containing defensin sequences were
also retrieved from the GenBank and translated into six
open reading frames and curated manually for the presence of the defensin motif in order to discover potential
sequences with distant homology.

Figureexpression patterns of 10 novel chicken β-defensins by RT-PCR
Tissue 5
Tissue expression patterns of 10 novel chicken β-defensins by RT-PCR. See Materials and Methods for details. The
number of PCR cycles was optimized for each gene, and the specificity of each PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. The
house-keeping gene, GAPDH, was used for normalization of the template input.

Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of chicken βdefensins
Multiple sequence alignment was constructed by using
the ClustalW program (version 1.82) [37]. A phylogenetic

tree of amino acid sequences of mature β-defensins was
constructed by the neighbor-joining method [38]. So that
a comparable data set would be used for all pairwise comparisons, any site at which the alignment postulated a gap

Comparative analysis of defensin clusters among the chicken, mouse, and human
Comparative analysis of defensin clusters among the chicken, mouse, and human. The gene clusters were drawn
proportionally according to their sizes. Each vertical line/bar represents the position of a gene, and the width of each line/bar is
proportional to the size of each gene. Three highly conserved genes (CTSB, BE072524, and HARL2754) surrounding the
defensin clusters in the chicken, mouse, and human were connected by solid lines. The position of the α-defensin locus (DEFA)
was indicated as an open square. Note that the human θ-defensin pseudogene resides in the DEFA locus. The positions and
orders of defensin genes in human and mouse were drawn based on the genome assemblies released in July 2003 and October
2003, respectively. Abbreviations: GGA, chicken chromosome; MMA, mouse chromosome; HSA, human chromosome; Tel, telomere; Cen, centromere.

in any sequence was excluded from the analysis. To maximize the number of sites available for analysis, certain
sequences with large deletions were excluded from the
analysis. Because the sequences were very short (25
aligned sites), no correction for multiple hits was applied.
The reliability of clustering patterns within the tree was
assessed by bootstrapping; 1000 bootstrap pseudo-samples were used. The proportion of synonymous nucleotide
differences per synonymous site (pS) and the proportion
of nonsynonymous nucleotide differences per nonsynonymous site (pN) were estimated by the method of Nei and
Gojobori [26]. Again, no correction for multiple hits was
applied because a small number of sites were examined.
Assembly of the chicken β-defensin gene cluster
To generate a continuous defensin gene cluster, the HTGS
and WGS sequences containing the putative defensin
genes were retrieved from the GenBank, aligned to generate a longer contig, which was confirmed later by
searching through the assembled chicken genome
released on February 29, 2004, by using the BLAT program [39] under the UCSC Genome Browser web site
[40]. The relative positions, orientations, and structural
organizations of individual genes were determined by

comparing its cDNA sequence to the continuous genomic
contig that we assembled.
Chromosome localization of the chicken β-defensin gene
cluster
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used for
chromosomal assignment of the chicken β-defensin gene
cluster by using the BAC clone TAM31-54I4 as probe,
which harbors 11 Gal genes. Metaphase chromosome
speads were prepared from mitogen-stimulated chicken
splenocyte culture as we described [41,42]. The BAC clone
was labeled by nick translation with biotin 16-dUTP
(Roche Diagnostics), hybridized to metaphase chromosome DNA, followed by detection with FITC-labeled avidin (Roche Diagnostics) and staining with propidium
iodide to simultaneously induce the R-banding.
RT-PCR analysis of the tissue expression patterns of
chicken β-defensins
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) from a
total of 32 different tissues from healthy, 2-month-old
chickens (see Figure 5). A total of 4 µg RNA from each tissue were reverse transcribed with random hexamers and
Superscript II reverse transcriptase by using a first-strand
cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the instruc-

tions. The subsequent PCR was carried out with 1/40 of
the first-strand cDNA and gene-specific primers for each
β-defensin
and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as described [28,43]. Every pair
of primers were designed to locate on different exons to
aid in distinguishing PCR products amplified from cDNA
vs. genomic DNA (Table 2). The PCR program used was:
94°C denaturation for 2 min, followed by different cycles
of 94°C denaturation for 20 sec, 55°C annealing for 20
sec, and 72°C extension for 40 sec, followed by a final
extension at 72°C for 5 min. The number of PCR cycle
was optimized for each gene to ensure linear amplification (Table 2). A half of the PCR products were analyzed
by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing 0.5
µg/ml ethidium bromide. The specificity of each PCR
product was confirmed by cloning of the PCR product
into T/A cloning vector, followed by sequencing of the
recombinant plasmid.

Note added in proof
Following submission of this manuscript, Lynn et al.
reported independently discovery of seven novel chicken
β-defensins in the chicken EST database by using homology search strategies [44]. Consistent with our conclusion,
they also revealed occurrence of positive selection
particularly in the mature region of chicken β-defensins
following evolutionary analysis. Moreover, albeit the use
of a different nomenclature, they confirmed that the
expressions of Gal 4–7 are primarily in bone marrow,
while other genes are more restricted to liver and the genitourinary tract.
