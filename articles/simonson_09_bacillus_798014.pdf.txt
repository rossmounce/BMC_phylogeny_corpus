Abstract
Background: The global pattern of distribution of 1033 B. anthracis isolates has previously been
defined by a set of 12 conserved canonical single nucleotide polymorphisms (canSNP). These
studies reinforced the presence of three major lineages and 12 sub-lineages and sub-groups of this
anthrax-causing pathogen. Isolates that form the A lineage (unlike the B and C lineages) have
become widely dispersed throughout the world and form the basis for the geographical disposition
of "modern" anthrax. An archival collection of 191 different B. anthracis isolates from China
provides a glimpse into the possible role of Chinese trade and commerce in the spread of certain
sub-lineages of this pathogen. Canonical single nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) and multiple
locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) typing has been used to examine this archival collection of isolates.
Results: The canSNP study indicates that there are 5 different sub-lineages/sub-groups in China
out of 12 previously described world-wide canSNP genotypes. Three of these canSNP genotypes
were only found in the western-most province of China, Xinjiang. These genotypes were A.Br.008/
009, a sub-group that is spread across most of Europe and Asia; A.Br.Aust 94, a sub-lineage that is
present in Europe and India, and A.Br.Vollum, a lineage that is also present in Europe. The
remaining two canSNP genotypes are spread across the whole of China and belong to sub-group
A.Br.001/002 and the A.Br.Ames sub-lineage, two closely related genotypes. MLVA typing adds
resolution to the isolates in each canSNP genotype and diversity indices for the A.Br.008/009 and
A.Br.001/002 sub-groups suggest that these represent older and established clades in China.

Conclusion: B. anthracis isolates were recovered from three canSNP sub-groups (A.Br.008/009,
A.Br.Aust94, and A.Br.Vollum) in the western most portion of the large Chinese province of
Xinjiang. The city of Kashi in this province appears to have served as a crossroads for not only trade
but the movement of diseases such as anthrax along the ancient "silk road". Phylogenetic inference
also suggests that the A.Br.Ames sub-lineage, first identified in the original Ames strain isolated
from Jim Hogg County, TX, is descended from the A.Br.001/002 sub-group that has a major
presence in most of China. These results suggest a genetic discontinuity between the younger
Ames sub-lineage in Texas and the large Western North American sub-lineage spread across
central Canada and the Dakotas.

Background
Ancient Chinese medical books suggest that an anthrax-like
disease has been present in China for more than 5,000 years
and that by 500–600 A.D. the epidemiology and symptoms
of anthrax had been described [1]. A 1995 report from China
described the results of an anthrax surveillance and control
project in 10 provinces in China between 1990–1994 [2].
Stations in these 10 provinces (Sichuan, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Guangxi, Guihou, Yunnan
and Hunan) reported 72 outbreaks and 8,988 human cases
of anthrax. These results, which are indicative of a long history and significant levels of contamination in these specific
areas, are the reason for concern by the Chinese Institute of
Epidemiology and Microbiology [2].
The population structure of Bacillus anthracis has only
recently begun to be resolved with specific geographical
patterns spread across areas mostly inhabited by man and
his animals. Higher genetic resolution within B. anthracis
has resulted from two molecular typing approaches: An
ongoing comparative, single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) analysis of diverse isolates that describes a conserved, clonally derived basal tree, [3] and a multiple
locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA)
system that provides improved resolution among individual isolates [4-7]. This process for molecular typing has
now been applied to the study of isolates from China.
An archival collection of 191 B. anthracis isolates from
China [collection dates from 1947–1983, except isolates
A0034 (1993) and A0038 (1997)] was obtained and used
in this study (see Methods and Additional file 1). This collection contained an unusual subset of 122 B. anthracis
isolates recovered from soil, including 107 isolates collected between 1981/1982 in Xinjiang province. This
province is located in the western most tip of China and
was one of the 10 regions surveyed in the study conducted
from 1990–1994. The remaining isolates originated from
many regions across the whole of China. This report
focuses on the molecular genotyping of these 191 isolates.
Our goal was to determine the nature and distribution of
genotypes found in China and to establish phylogenetic
relationships between these isolates and those found elsewhere in the world.

Canonical SNP analysis
The original comparative analysis of 5 B. anthracis whole
genome sequences examined the status of ~1,000 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 26 diverse isolates
[3]. This study revealed an extremely conserved phylogenetic tree with only one homoplastic character in ~26,000
measurements. These results prompted the hypothesis
that a few strategically placed "canonical SNPs" could
replace the 1,000 assays and still describe an accurate SNP
based tree. This idea was confirmed in a study using 13
canonical SNPs (canSNP) to examine 1,000 world-wide
isolates of B. anthracis [5]. Figure 1 illustrates this original
canSNP tree and is used here to define important nomenclature and terminology.

The basic tree is now defined by 7 sequenced genomes
that form 7 sub-branches or sub-lineages ending in "stars"
in Figure 1. Each of these sub-lineages is designated by the
nomenclature from the whole genome sequence site in
Genbank, e.g. A.Br Ames, A.Br.WNA (for western North
America), and A.Br.Vollum. The relative position of each
canSNP is indicated by vertical script and a small arrow
and is arbitrarily defined, e.g., as A.Br.001 where A refers
to the major subgroup and 001 is the first canSNP (see the
A.Br.Ames sub-lineage in Figure 1, also [5]). In this case
the derived A.Br.001 SNP defines all isolates that are on
the same branch as the sequenced Ames strain. In addition to these 7 sub-lineages the analysis of 26 diverse isolates uncovered 5 nodes or sub-groups along the branches
of this tree. Four of these nodes are in the major A Branch
and one is in the B Branch (see "circles" in Figure 1). These
nodes are defined by the two canSNPs on either side of the
node position, e.g. A.Br.001/002 or A.Br.008/009. All of
the initial 1,000 isolates in the Van Ert study [5] were
placed into one and only one of these 12 sub-lineages or
sub-groups.

Results
CanSNP analysis of isolates from China
The 191 B. anthracis isolates from China were distributed
into only five of these 12 canSNP sub-lineages/sub-groups
described by Van Ert et al. [5]. These canSNP groups were
A.Br.Vollum, A.Br.Aust.94, A.Br.001/002, A.Br.Ames, and
A.Br.008/009 (Figures 1 and 2). Four of the sub-lineages/

The twelve canSNP subgroups and sub-lineages of B. anthracis
The twelve canSNP subgroups and sub-lineages of B. anthracis. Determined by the analysis of 14 canSNP sites
described by Van Ert et al[5]. The five canSNP groups represented in China are indicated in larger and bold fonts in this Neighbor Joining Tree. The number of isolates (N), genotypes (G), and Nei's Diversity Index [8] within groups (D) are illustrated in
the table in the lower left. Neighbor-joining trees based upon additional MLVA genotypes within each of these 5 canSNP
groups are illustrated in Figures 3 and 5.
sub-groups (A.Br.Vollum, A.Br.Aust.94, A.Br.008/009 and
A.Br.001/002) were found in the western province of
China, Xinjiang (Figure 2). But only isolates from A.Br.001/
002 sub-group and the close relative A.Br.Ames sub-lineage
were found scattered throughout the other regions of China
from east to west. These findings clearly suggest 4 or 5 separate introductions of B. anthracis into or out of China, with
3 possibly involving the routes defined as the Silk Road.
The A.Br.008/009 sub-group is a cluster that predominates throughout Europe, the Middle East and China. Xinjiang province had 49 of the worldwide total of 156
A.Br.008/009 isolates (Table insert in Figure 1 and [5]).
This province also had 44 of 188 worldwide isolates of the
A.Br.Aust94 isolates. This is a sub-group that is also well
represented in neighboring Turkey and India. A smaller
subset of the A.Br.Vollum sub-lineage (also found in
Europe and Africa) accounts for 16 Xinjiang samples out

of a worldwide set that totals 48 isolates (Table insert in
Figure 1).
The remainder of China is dominated by the A.Br.001/
002 subgroup. Chinese isolates represent 74 of the 106
isolates from our worldwide collection of A.Br.001/002
sub-group isolates (Figure 1 and [5]). Only 9 of these isolates are from Xinjiang province to the west. Similarly
there are 8 isolates out of 19 worldwide isolates in the
A.Br.Ames sub-lineage in the main parts of China.
MLVA Analysis of A.Br.008/009, A.Br.Aust94 and
A.Br.Vollum
CanSNP typing of these isolates has already indicated that
there were 49 total Chinese isolates from the A.Br.008/009
subgroup, 44 from the A.Br.Aust94 sub-lineage and 15
from the A.Br.Vollum (Figure 1). Additional sub-typing
using 15 MLVA markers indicates that there were only 3

Geographical distribution of B. anthracis isolates in China
Figure 2
Geographical distribution of B. anthracis isolates in China. This distribution is based on 12 canSNP genotypes described
in Figure 1 and the analysis of 191 isolates from China; also see [5]. The red routes include the western city of Kashi in Xinjiang
Province, the main crossroads into China and around the Taklimakan Desert leading into the eastern Chinese provinces.

MLVA genotypes within both the A.Br.Vollum (Nei Diversity Index = 0.038 [8]) and A.Br.Aust94 (Nei's Diversity
Index = 0.031) sub-lineages but 14 MLVA genotypes within
A.Br.008/009 (Nei's Diversity Index = 0.143, Figures 1, 3a,
3b, and 3c). These results suggest repeated infections and
outbreaks for each of these sub-groups of B. anthracis. The
identification of 14 genotypes for the A.Br.008/009 subgroups is an indication of a combination of possibly
repeated introductions and infections and a significantly
longer history for this particular clade in this region.
Branch collapse and ongoing SNP analysis
One of the more remarkable findings from the whole
genome SNP analysis of 5 diverse isolates by Pearson et al.
[3] was a nearly total lack of homoplastic SNP markers in
a query of the status of nearly 1,000 SNP positions in 26
diverse isolates. This finding uncovered a phenomenon

called "branch collapse" that resulted in a tree that had no
branching except for those created by 7 sequenced reference genomes. The remaining 26 isolates were then either
part of one of these seven "sub-lineages" or part of 5 nonbranching nodes ("sub-groups") on one of the 7
branches. While the canSNP tree is highly accurate in the
typing of 1033 isolates, it lacks resolution because it
reflects the results of only 13 of nearly 1,000 SNPs.
Improved resolution between two points was demonstrated by an extensive analysis of the Ames specific
branch [9,10] when the status of 29 SNPs that define this
branch were determined for the original 12 Ames-like isolates. These analyses have a direct bearing on the isolates
from China that are either Ames-like or part of the
A.Br.001/002 sub-group (Fig. 1 and 4). The extended
analysis of the SNPs on the Ames branch indicate that

MLVA15 Analysis of Chinese isolates belonging to the A.Br.Vollum, A.BrAust94 and A.Br.008/009 canSNP sub-lineges/subFigure
groups 3
MLVA15 Analysis of Chinese isolates belonging to the A.Br.Vollum, A.BrAust94 and A.Br.008/009 canSNP
sub-lineges/sub-groups. Representatives of these three sub-groups were only found in isolates recovered in Xinjiang Province, or in unknown locations within China (n = 2). All of these isolates were recovered from soil samples in this province.

there are 74 Chinese isolates in the A.Br.001/002 subgroup and 8 additional Chinese isolates (see the table
insert in Figure 1) that form three new nodes or collapsed
branch points between A.Br.001/002 and the Ames isolate
(Figure 4). In addition, there is a fourth node closest to the
Ames strain that contains 10 Ames-like isolates from
Texas, one goat and 4 bovine isolates [9] shown in Figure
4 and an additional 5 Ames-like isolates from the CDC
(Brachman collection, see Methods and Materials). The
precise location for the recovery of these latter isolates is
unknown except that they originated in Texas. These 19
isolates (8 Chinese, 10 Texas) and the Ames strain represent a highly resolved, SNP based A.Br.Ames sub-lineage.
These results indicate that the original Ames strain and a
subset of 10 Texas isolates are decendents of a rare lineage
that is otherwise only found in China.

MLVA: A.Br.001/002
The 15 marker MLVA analysis (MLVA15) of the 74 isolates
belonging to the A.Br.001/002 sub-group yielded 32 different genotypes (Nei Diversity Index = 0.108, Figures 1,
5a). This high diversity index is an indication that this
sub-group, spread throughout the whole of China (Figure
2), is another sub-group of B. anthracis with a long and
extensive evolutionary presence in China.

Discussion
Human anthrax has been an old and continuous problem
in many rural regions in China where as much as six percent of environmental samples have been found to be contaminated with B. anthracis [2,2]. An archival collection of
191 B. anthracis isolates was obtained from China and
canonical SNP typing indicated that only 5 of the 12 world-

Figure 4
The Ames branch of B. anthracis
The Ames branch of B. anthracis. This figure shows the relationship between the Ames strain and its closest relatives in a
worldwide collection [5]. Twenty-nine of 31 original [5] SNPs are defined by their positions in the Ames genome
(NC_003997) and their positions along the Ames branch. Ames has the derived state for all 29 SNPs and the 4 SNPs between
Ames and the Texas Goat are specific for the Ames strain alone [5]. A0728 was isolated in China in 1957 but the specific location/source of this isolate is unknown.
wide sub-lineages/sub-groups of this pathogen were represented in this collection. One striking feature of the
distribution of these B. anthracis isolates within this country
was the discovery that three of the five canSNPs sub-lineages/groups (A.Br008/009, A.BrAust.94, and A.Br.Vollum)
are predominantly found in the western most Chinese
province of Xinjiang. The previous observation [5] that
these three sub-lineages/sub-groups are prominent genotypes in India, Pakistan, Turkey and most of Europe suggest
a likely transmission pattern for anthrax along the ancient
trade route known as the Silk Road [11] that extended from
Europe, the Middle East, portions of Asia and into Xinjiang
province and the whole of China, Figure 2.
More specifically, 107 isolates were recovered from "soil
samples" between 1981–1982 from unspecified sites relatively close to the city of Kashi in this province. Kashi (also
Kashgar, Kaxgar, Kxkr) was a major "oasis" crossroads city
along the ancient Silk Road and dates back more than
2,000 years [11]. Consistent with the idea that the life

cycle of B. anthracis can be maintained by viable spores in
previously contaminated areas, the later 1990–1994 surveillance project in China described three regions in Xinjiang Province where severe anthrax outbreaks had
previously occurred [2]. Two of these towns, Zepu and
Atushi, are located approximately 144 and 33 kilometers
respectively from the city of Kashi. In the 1990–1994
study, Zepu recorded 24 villages with 202 human infections and Atushi recorded 4 villages with 81 human infections.
Despite a clear correlation between canSNP genotypes
from the A radiation and the spectrum of isolates found
across the Trans-Eurasian continents, there is one set of
genotypes in Europe that are clearly missing in China.
These are representatives from the B branch that appear to
be prevalent in several European states including at least
27 B2 isolates from France and isolates identified in both
the B2 and B1 branches from Croatia, Germany, Poland,
Italy, Norway and Slovakia [5,6,12]. It is not obvious why

Figure 5
MLVA 15 Analysis of A.Br.001/002 and A.Br.Ames sub-group and sub-lineage respectively
MLVA 15 Analysis of A.Br.001/002 and A.Br.Ames sub-group and sub-lineage respectively. The A.Br.001/002 subgroup has a relatively large diversity index (See Figure 2) and suggests that this sub-group has a long history in China with
repeated outbreaks and eventual spread throughout much of the country.

examples of the B branch are limited mostly to Africa, this
region of Europe and a small location in California, USA.
Aside from sampling issues the B branch does not appear
to have participated in the world-wide, dynamic radiation
that has characterized the A branch [5].
Additional analyses with the rapidly evolving MLVA
markers suggest that establishment in China of two of

these sub-groups/sub-lineages, A.Br.Aust94 and A.Br.Vollum, resulted from relatively recent events (Figure 3a and
3b). In both of these instances, a sizeable number of isolates (44 and 15, respectively) are clustered into only three
different MLVA15 genotypes (Nei's Diversity Indices =
0.031 and 0.038 respectively, Figure 2). Although these
results may reflect a certain sampling bias, the MLVA comparison to other worldwide isolates from this branch indiPage 7 of 11

cates that the A.Br.Aust94 sub-lineage in China is most
closely related to isolates recovered from the large 1997
outbreak in Victoria, Australia (data not shown). The precise origin and time-scale for this exchange is not certain
but relatively recent exchanges between the Far East and
Australia appear to have originated from India [13],
which could represent a common ancestor or an intermediate step in the transmission route.
By direct contrast the MLVA analysis of 49 isolates belonging to the A.Br.008/009 sub-group revealed a more complex pattern with 14 different MLVA15 genotypes (Nei
Diversity Index = 0.143, Figures 1 and 3c). This is a
remarkable finding because it indicates that a variety of
MLVA genotypes are persisting in the different soils from
which the A.Br.008/009 isolates were recovered. These
results are an indication that A.Br.008/009, a major subgroup in Europe and Asia [5], has had an extensive history
in China. It is difficult to determine the precise origins of
the A.Br.008/009 subgroup (e.g. China versus Europe) at
this point because rapidly evolving MLVA markers are
subject to homoplasy and potentially inaccurate phylogenetic reconstructions. These issues can eventually be
resolved using additional whole genome sequencing and
phylogenetic inference to more accurately predict the origins of the A.Br.008/009 sub-group.
The Ames sub-lineage appears to have descended from the
A.Br.001/002 sub-group, a sub-group that has 106 isolates
in our worldwide collection [5]. Seventy-four of these
accessions were isolated from outbreaks in China and the
remaining 32 isolates were recovered in the UK, other parts
of Europe, North America and other parts of Asia. The large
number of MLVA15 genotypes (n = 32) among the 74 Chinese isolates and a wide distribution throughout the country indicates that the A.Br.001/002 sub-group is a major
part of the B. anthracis population structure in this region
(Figure 5a). This sub-group also appears to be basal to the
Ames sub-lineage, indicating that 8 isolates from China
and 11 isolates from Texas may share common ancestors
that originated in China (Figure 5b and [10]).
How then did the Ames lineage come to Texas and why is
this lineage not found in Europe? This is still not known
and subject to considerable speculation. By several
accounts, it is believed that anthrax was introduced into
the Gulf Coast states (Louisiana and Texas) by early settlers from Europe. Stein [14,15] indicates that the first
recorded episodes of anthrax in livestock in Louisiana
occurred in 1835, 1851 and 1884; and in Texas in 1860
and 1880. By 1916, when a first national survey was conducted to obtain nation-wide information on the incidence of anthrax, Texas already had 41 counties reporting
infections. A composite of outbreaks compiled after the
4th National Survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
between 1916–1944 (Figure 6) indicates three major out-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/71

break pockets: one in California, one in the Dakotas/
Nebraska and the third along the coastal regions of Texas
and Louisiana [15].
An important feature of the outbreaks in Texas is that the
"modern" outbreaks have occurred repeatedly in many of
the same counties depicted in this historical map (Figure
6 and USDA Report: Epizootiology and Ecology of
Anthrax:
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/cei/taf/
emerginganimalhealthissues_files/anthrax.pdf). A culture-confirmed study between 1974–2000 indicated that
179 isolates were spread across 39 Texas counties (counties outlined in yellow) that are in general agreement with
the dispersal patterns observed in the early national surveys depicted in Figure 6. The one significant difference is
a shift from the historical outbreaks in the coastal regions
to counties more central and southwesterly in "modern"
times. Similarly, culture-confirmed isolates from a 2001
outbreak in Val Verde, Edwards, Real, Kinney and Uvalde
counties in southwest Texas are similar to outbreaks in
2006 and 2007 when 4 Ames-like isolates were recovered
from Real, Kinney, and Uvalde county [9].
It appears that B. anthracis was introduced into the Gulf
Coast, probably by early European settlers or traders
through New Orleans and/or Galveston during the early
to mid 1800s. The disease became established along the
coastal regions and then became endemic to the regions
of Texas where cattle and other susceptible animals are
currently farmed. Are these B. anthracis, Ames-like genotypes from the Big Bend region (Real, Kinney, Uvalde
counties) of Texas representative of the ancestral isolates
brought to the Gulf Coast? Van Ert et al. [5] used synonymous SNP surveys to estimate the divergence times
between the major groups of B. anthracis and these estimates suggest that the Western North American and the
Ames lineages shared common ancestors between 2,825
and 5,651 years ago. Extrapolating to the much shorter
SNP distances between the most recent Chinese isolate
(A0728) and the recent Texas isolates on the Ames sublineage would approximate that these two shared a common ancestor between 145 to 290 years ago. These estimates would be consistent with the hypothesis that an
Ames-like isolate was introduced into the Galveston and/
or New Orleans area in the early to middle 1800s.
This relatively recent expansion is in direct contrast to
analyses of the Western North American (WNA) sub-lineage that appears to have an ancient and significantly
longer evolutionary presence in North America; this
group stretches from the central regions of Canada and
into North and South Dakota (Figure 6; [16]). Phylogenetic reconstruction of > 250 Western North American
isolates indicates that the more ancestral isolates of this
sub-lineage are found in the upper reaches of central Canada and portrays a migration pattern where the youngest

dor are suited for maintaining naturally occurring anthrax
outbreaks in livestock and wildlife. Although historical
records provide evidence that validate this model, there is
a molecular and genotyping anomaly: there does not
appear to be a direct epidemiological link between the
"younger" Ames-like cluster and the Western North American lineage. Despite nearly 100 years of monitoring since
the first national outbreak tabulations [15], there is still a
clear physical division between the Ames-like isolates to
the south and the Western North American lineage to the
north (Figure 6). This gap is not obvious until the spatial
patterns are examined in hindsight of the genetic discontinuity. These observations probably reflect the awareness
and controls that were being observed for anthrax outbreaks as the US entered the 20th century.
Limited sample analysis of isolates from the Texas/Louisiana coastline prevents any conclusions about the overall
dominance of the Ames sub-lineage in this area and we
also cannot exclude the possibility that there are other
sub-groups/sub-lineages that might have been imported
and even become transiently established along the Texas/
Louisiana Gulf region during this same time frame.

Conclusion

Historical and The Dakotas/Nebraska/Iowa
Historical Anthrax Incidences between 1915–1944 in
Texas/Louisiana and The Dakotas/Nebraska/Iowa.
Adapted from Stein (1945, [15]). Darker colors represent
severe outbreaks and the lighter colors represent sporadic
outbreaks. The blue and green colors were used to illustrate
that two distinct genotypes (Western North America
(WNA) and the Ames sub-lineage) have been indentified in
"modern" isolates from these two regions. The counties bordered in yellow in Texas indicate counties where documented incidents of anthrax have occurred between 1974
and 2000. The numbers 1–4 indicate the counties in which
the original Ames strain, 2 bovine samples and a goat sample
have been analyzed by current genotyping methods as
belonging to the Ames sub-lineage. The molecular analysis of
more than 200 isolates from North and South Dakota indicates a pre-dominance of the sub-lineage WNA in this
region. The gray colors indicate moderate to sparse outbreaks in the states adjoining the Dakotas and Texas.
isolates are found in cattle outbreaks in North/South
Dakota and Nebraska. Kenefic, Pearson et al. [16] suggest
that the ancestral isolates may have entered the North
American continent via the Beringian straights 13,000
years ago.
A recent ecological niche model suggests that natural
anthrax outbreaks are "concentrated in a narrow corridor
from southwest Texas northward into the Dakotas and
Minnesota" [17]. This model indicates that conditions
like vegetation, precipitation and altitude along this corri-

Despite containing only 5 of the initial 12 canSNP genotypes used to define a collection of world-wide isolates
[5], the analysis of 191 Chinese B. anthracis isolates
reveals an interesting impact on global distribution. The
major diversity in these isolates is concentrated in the
western province of Xinjiang and especially the city of
Kashi, the hub of the Silk Road around the Taklimakan
Desert into and out of China. These results reinforce the
idea that this Silk Road region was central to the spread of
anthrax between the trans-Eurasian continents.
In addition to the three distinct sub-groups found in the
western Xinjiang province, the central and eastern regions
of China are dominated by a different, highly diverse, canSNP sub-group, A.Br.001/002. This sub-group is a major
presence in relationship to our world-wide collection
since 70% of all the isolates and most of the diversity for
this sub-group were in this Chinese collection. These
results suggest that the A.Br.001/002 cluster may have
originated in China. Finally, the Ames and Ames-like
strains in Texas are descended from common ancestors in
Inner Mongolia in China as an extension of this subgroup. It is curious that this lineage would become established in Texas, and perhaps Louisiana, and not in Europe.
This leaves behind a missing historical gap within the
phylogeography of the Ames lineage.

Methods
B. anthracis isolates
The 191 B. anthracis isolates from China used in this study
were previously isolated from a variety of sources and provPage 9 of 11

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:71

inces in China (see Additional file 1). One hundred and fifteen isolates were from Xinjiang Province in western China
including 107 isolates from soil samples. The remainder of
the isolates were recovered from the following provinces
with the number of isolates in parenthesis: Hebei (10),
Gansu (8), Henan (2), Inner Mongolia (10), Jiangxi (1),
Liaoning (26), Sichuan (1) and 18 isolates where the province of origin was not known. In addition to the 107 soil
samples from Xinjiang Province isolates were obtained
from the following sources: soil (15 additional), air (4),
bovine (3), buffalo (1) fur (2), human (25), laboratory (1),
marmot (1), sheep (3), swine (3) and unknown sources
(26). In addition to the Chinese isolates there are 6 isolates
that were used to describe Figure 4[9,10] and an additional
5 isolates that were obtained from the CDC as part of the
"Brachman Collection" (CDC ID # 34064, 34279, 402,
482, 490). All 11 of these isolates belong to the Ames sublineage and all were isolated in Texas between 1959–2007.
This analysis also includes the original Ames strain that was
isolated in 1981 from bovine in Jim Hogg County.
All isolates were initially genotyped for a B. anthracis species-specific plcR nonsense mutation that has been suggested as being necessary for stabilization of the virulence
plasmids [18]. This single nucleotide polymorphism
appears to be diagnostic for B. anthracis [19]. In this study
the ancestral state for this marker was used to root the B.
anthracis SNP tree to the older and more diverse B. cereus/
B. thuringiensis tree. DNA was isolated from each of the
191 isolates as previously described [5].
CanSNP Genotyping
TaqMan™ -Minor Groove Binding (MGB) allelic discrimination assays were designed for each of 13 canSNPs and
have been described in great detail by Van Ert et al. [5].
The genomic positions for each canSNP and the primer
sequences and probes for each site can be found in Supplemental Tables 4 and 5 in the Van Ert et al. [5].
MLVA Genotyping
Multiple Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR)
Analysis (MLVA) was used to determine the overall diversity of the isolates within each sub-group and sub-lineage.
The first 8 marker set used in this analysis were initially
described by Keim et al., [4] and a second set of 7 additional markers were described by Zinser [20]. This 15
marker, high-resolution, MLVA system is described in
detail by Van Ert et al. [5] with the genomic positions and
primer sets for these assays described in Supplemental
Tables 2 and 6 of this reference.
Phylogenetic Inference
The genetic relationships among the Chinese isolates were
established using a hierarchical approach where the
slowly evolving, highly conserved, canSNP markers were
first used to place each isolate into its appropriate clonal
lineage. The 15 more rapidly evolving, VNTR loci, were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/71

then used to measure the genetic diversity and to determine the number of specific genotypes within each of
these clonal lineages. Neighbor joining phylogenetic trees
were constructed for both the canSNP and MLVA datasets
using PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony)
[21]; and the MEGA 3 software package [22] was used to
calculate average within group distances for each of the
five canSNP sub-groups/sub-lineages.
