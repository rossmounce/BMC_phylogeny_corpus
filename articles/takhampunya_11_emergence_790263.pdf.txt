Abstract
Background: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype V reemerged in Asia (China) in 2009 after a 57-year hiatus
from the continent, thereby emphasizing a need to increase regional surveillance efforts. Genotypic
characterization was performed on 19 JEV-positive mosquito pools (18 pools of Culex tritaeniorhynchus and 1 pool
of Cx. bitaeniorhynchus) from a total of 64 positive pools collected from geographically different locations
throughout the Republic of Korea (ROK) during 2008 and 2010.
Findings: Two regions of the JEV genome were sequenced from 19 pools; the envelope gene and the
nonstructural protein 5 (NS5)/3’-untranslated region (UTR). Eighteen pools of Culex tritaeniorhynchus and one pool
of Cx. bitaeniorhynchus were positive for genotype I and genotype V, respectively. Sequence alignment of the
complete E gene from Cx. bitaeniorhynchus showed high amino acid similarity (98.8%) to the Muar strain,
characterized as the first report of genotype V, isolated from an encephalitis patient in Malaysia in 1952.
Conclusion: This study represents the first report of JEV genotype V in the ROK. The reemergence of genotype V
in Asia (China and ROK) after more than a half-century and its discovery in Cx. bitaeniorhynchus, a mosquito species
previously unknown to carry JEV in the ROK, emphasizes the need for enhanced JE surveillance to monitor the
dynamics of JEV strains within the region. Future findings may have implications with regard to JEV vaccination/
prevention strategies.

Background
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne
member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, and
a primary cause of viral encephalitis in humans within its
range [1]. The positive-sense RNA viral genome is
approximately 11 kb in length and is translated into three
structural proteins [Capsid (C), Membrane (M), and
Envelope (E)] and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins
(NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) with
untranslated regions (UTR) at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the
genome [2]. Historically, Culex tritaeniorhynchus was
implicated as the primary vector of JEV in the Republic
of Korea (ROK) and much of Asia [3,4]. However, JEV

has since been detected in additional culicine species
throughout its range, including Cx. bitaeniorhynchus
from the ROK [5]. JEV strains are generally classified into
five genotypes (genotypes I, II, III, IV, and V) based on
similarities in the E gene nucleotide sequence [6]. Previously, only genotype I was detected on the Korean
peninsula [7]. Therefore, we characterized JEV-positive
pools of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. bitaeniorhynchus
to determine whether the unexpected finding of JEV in
Cx. bitaeniorhynchus in the ROK may have coincided
with the appearance of an additional genotype.

Materials and Methods
Nineteen JEV-positive mosquito pools, from a total of 64
JEV-positive pools collected during 2008 and 2010 in the
ROK (18 pools of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and 1 pool of Cx.
bitaeniorhynchus), and one JEV culture received from

USAMRIID (United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, USA) were genotypically
characterized (Table 1, Figure 1). Total RNA was
extracted from mosquito homogenate using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and was resuspended in 50 μl of
RNase-free water containing 10 units of RNasin® Plus
RNase Inhibitor (Promega, USA). RNA was used as the
template for cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript III
first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, USA) with a
random hexamer primer. The synthesized cDNA was
then used for PCR amplification using iProof™ HighFidelity DNA polymerase (Bio-Rad, USA). The NS5
gene/3’ UTR and envelope (E) gene of 19 JEV-positive
pools were amplified using EMF1/VD8 primers [8] and
940S/1720A primers [9], respectively. Products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen,
USA) and sequenced by AITBiotech Company (AITbiotech, Singapore).
The sequences were edited and assembled using the
Sequencer program v4.1.4 (Applied Biosystems, USA).
Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis
were performed using ClustalX version 2.0.11 and MEGA
version 5 programs [10,11]. Percent sequence similarity/
divergence was calculated using the MegAlign program
found in the Lasergene v.8 software (DNASTAR, Inc.,
Madison, WI, USA). Phylogenetic analysis of the partial E
gene (705 bp) was performed using the neighbor-joining
method and Tamura-Nei model of nucleotide substitution.
The maximum likelihood (ML) tree was constructed from
the NS5/3’UTR nucleotide sequences (550 bp) by PhyML
software v 3.0 [12] using the best fit model with aLRT
branch support [13]. The ML tree for the complete E gene
used the Tamura-Nei model with bootstrap analysis (2,
000 replicates) for testing the reliability of the tree using
the MEGA5 (version 5) program (The Biodesign Institute,
Tempe, Arizona) [11].

Results
The phylogenetic relationships among 19 JEV strains and
JEV sequences retrieved from GenBank representing genotypes I-V were analyzed. The ML tree for the NS5/
3’UTR (550 bp) and the neighbor-joining tree for the partial E gene (705 bp) showed similar branching patterns
with high bootstrap support. Therefore, the ML tree is
only presented in this report (Figure 2). Two genotypes
were identified among the 19 JEV strains. JEV strains
from 18 Cx. tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes grouped into
genotype I. These genotype I strains were closely-related
to strains isolated from China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam,
and Thailand from the early 1980s to the present (Figure
2). The remaining strain from Cx. bitaeniorhynchus (101827) grouped into genotype V together with the Muar

strain which was isolated from an encephalitis patient in
Malaysia in 1952.
The complete E gene was sequenced from a subset of
strains in genotype I (A10.825, A10.881, A8.789) and
genotype V (10-1827). The ML tree constructed from
the complete E gene of these strains together with
representative JEV genotype I-V sequences is shown in
Figure 3. This ML tree supports the phylogenetic analysis results performed on the NS5/3’UTR (Figure 2) and
the partial E gene previously mentioned. The ML tree in
Figure 3 shows that the 10-1827 strain grouped with the
Muar strain with 79% bootstrap support, while the
remaining sequences clustered in genotype I together
with K01-JN and K05-GS strains that were isolated from
Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in the ROK in 2001 and 2005,
respectively.
Sequence analysis of 18 strains shows minimal sequence
variation among viruses in genotype I, with nucleotide
sequence similarity of 97.5-100% for the NS5/3’UTR (Figure 2) and 99.6-100% for the E gene (Figure 3). In an earlier study, genetic stability was also observed among JEV
strains isolated from mosquito vectors in the ROK
between 1994 and 2005 [7]. Examination of the complete
E sequence of 10-1827 strain (genotype V) showed less
similarity to the other genotypes, with nucleotide similarity
approximately 77.3% (91.3% for amino acids) to genotype I
(K01-JN, K05-GS), 78.1% (91.0% for amino acids) to genotype II (FU strain), 77.7% (90.4% for amino acids) to genotype III (Nakayama), and 77.8% (91.0% for amino acids) to
genotype IV (JKT6468) (Table 2). However, nucleotide
and amino acid similarities to the Muar strain were 90.0%
and 98.8%, respectively (Table 2). Likewise, the XZ0934
strain, a JEV genotype V recently isolated from China
(2009), showed E gene nucleotide and amino acid
sequence similarities to the Muar strain of 86.0% and
93.2%, respectively [14].
Figure 4 shows the amino acid sequence alignment of
the complete E gene derived from strains A10.825,
A10.881, A8.789, and 10-1827 and reference sequences
(Muar, K01-JN, K05-GS). The E protein of the strains in
genotype I is very conserved with few amino acid changes
detected: A10.825 (from S = serine to N = asparagine at
position 123) and A8.789 (from L = leucine to M =
methionine at position 371). The alignment reveals differences in 6 amino acid residues between the Muar and
10-1827 strains (Figure 4). The eight Muar signature
amino acid residues in domain III comprising a putative
receptor binding region [15] were also identified in the
10-1827 strain along with the critical amino acid residue
thought to be involved in receptor binding activity (Q =
glutamine at position 327) [16]. Table 3 provides a complete listing of the strains that are referenced in this
study.

Figure 2 Maximum likelihood tree of JEV strains from the ROK using NS5/3’UTR base-sequence homologies. Phylogenetic analysis was
performed using the GTR+G4+I model of nucleotide substitution (ln(L) = -3090.1 571) and aLRT branch support (indicated at major nodes). The
phylogenetic tree has been rooted at its midpoint. Scale bar represents substitutions per site.

Conclusion
This study is the first report of JEV genotype V in the
ROK and represents the third report of genotype V
in Asia, with the most recent findings from Cx. tritaeniorhynchus collected in Tibet, China (2009) [14]. The
fact that JEV genotype V, first reported from an

encephalitis patient in Malaysia in 1952 (Muar strain),
came long before the discovery of its reemergence in
China in 2009 and now its subsequent appearance in
the ROK may mark the beginning of a genotypic shift
in JEV within the region. Additionally, the emergence
of this strain in Cx. bitaeniorhynchus, a mosquito

underscores the need to step-up surveillance efforts
within the ROK. The reemergence of this genotype
after 57 years may have future implications with regard

to JEV vaccination effectiveness and policy among civilian and military populations, as well as with preventive strategies designed to reduce the health impact
and incidence of JEV among at risk Asian populations.
