Abstract
Background: The growing popularity of Chinese herbal medicine in the United States has
prompted large-scale import of raw herbs from Asia. Many of the Asian herbs have phylogenetically
related North American species. We compared three phylogenetically related species, namely
Coptis chinensis (Huanglian), Hydrastis canadensis and Coptis trifolia to show whether they can be
substituted by one another in terms of alkaloid content.
Methods: We used microwave assisted extraction to obtain alkaloids berberine, coptisine,
palmatine and hydrastine. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify
each alkaloid.
Results: Hydrastis canadensis has the most berberine, whereas Coptis trifolia has the most coptisine.
Hydrastine and palmatine were unique to Hydrastis canadensis and Coptis chinensis respectively.
Conclusion: Neither Hydrastis canadensis nor Coptis trifolia contains all the alkaloids found in Coptis
chinensis used in Chinese medicine. Substitutes of this Chinese species by its American relatives are
not recommended.

Background
Phylogenetically related plant species exhibit phytochemical similarities [1]. For example, taxol is an anti-cancer
chemical compound initially isolated from the bark of a
rare tree species Taxus brevifolia (Pacific Yew tree); however, a closely related and more available species, Taxus
cuspidata was later proved to be a more commercially viable source for taxol [2]. The growing popularity of Chinese
herbal medicine in the United States has prompted largescale import of raw herbs from Asia [3]. As many Chinese
medicinal plants are evolutionarily related to their North
American congeners, the North American species may be
possible phytochemical substitutes to the Chinese medic-

inal herbs [4]. For example, North American ginseng
(Panax quinquifolium) has become the commercial alternative to the rarer Chinese ginseng (Panax ginseng) [5].
Growing native substitutes can potentially promote local
industry and reduce the ecological risks of cultivating
exotic species; however, there is little information available on possible North American phytochemical substitutes to Chinese medicinal herbs.
The present study investigates the alkaloid content in Coptis trifolia (American goldthread) and Hydrastis canadensis
(goldenseal), two herbs found in the United States, and
Coptis chinensis (Huanglian, Chinese goldthread), a Chi-

nese medicinal herb imported from China. The three species belong to the same Ranunculaceae family and have
alkaloid rich rhizomes. Phylogenetically related to Hydrastis canadensis, the genus Coptis has several North American
and Asian species [6].
During the 18th century, Native Americans used the rhizome of Coptis trifolia to treat mouth sores, poor digestion
and infections. The species had become scarce due to over
harvesting and/or loss of habitat caused by human activities. It was substituted with Hydrastis canadensis, which
remains available commercially to this date despite the
fact that the growth of Coptis trifolia has recovered in the
northeastern United States [7]. Hydrastis canadensis is an
'at risk' species due to the potential for over harvest but
can be cultivated on a small scale [8]. Both species are
phylogenetically related to Coptis chinensis which is used
to treat digestive and respiratory disorders in Chinese
medicine [9].
A review of available literature indicates that there has
been considerably more pharmacological research on
Coptis chinensis than Hydrastis canadensis and Coptis trifolia.
Current findings show some of their similarities. Bioassays on Coptis chinensis and Hydrastis canadensis indicate
that both herbs possess anti-microbial activities [10,11].
In addition, Coptis chinensis is anti-inflammatory [12] and
Hydrastis canadensis may improve immune function [13].
Pharmacological studies on Coptis trifolia are still lacking.
Coptis chinensis contains alkaloids such as berberine, palmatine, epiberberine, coptisine, jaterorhizine and columbamine. Hydrastis canadensis also contains alkaloids such
as berberine, hydrastine, hydrastinine and canadine
[4,14]. Isoquiniline alkaloids in Coptis trifolia were suggested to be similar to those in Coptis chinensis yet they
have not been fully characterized [3]. Berberine, a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, has been found in all three species
and has been demonstrated to be anti-carcinogenic and
anti-microbial [15].
The present study aims to investigate whether berberine,
coptisine, hydrastine and palmatine (major isoquinoline
alkaloids) are quantitatively comparable in content
among rhizomes of Hydrastis canadensis, Coptis trifolia and
Coptis chinensis.

Methods
Hydrastis canadensis (n = 20) was obtained from Horizon
Herbs, Oregon, USA. Coptis trifolia (n = 20) was harvested
from the Wachmeister field station northern New York,
USA. Coptis chinensis rhizomes (n = 20) were obtained
from a supplier in Montreal, Canada. The whole plants of
Hydrastis canadensis and Coptis trifolia were authenticated
by comparing their morphology with type specimens at
the St Lawrence University herbarium [16]. The Coptis

http://www.cmjournal.org/content/4/1/17

chinensis rhizomes were authenticated by comparing the
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) peaks
to those from published data [17,18].
Acetonitrile and methanol (HPLC-grade) were obtained
from Pharmco-AAPER (USA). Hexane and phosphoric
acid (ACS grade) were obtained from JT Baker (USA). Berberine, palmatine and coptisine were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and hydrastine was purchased from
MP Biomedical (USA).
All rhizomes of the three herbs were dried at 75°C in a
forced air oven for 72 hours and subsequently were
ground into fine powder with a mortar and pestle. Alkaloids were extracted with a microwave assisted extraction
(MAE) technique [19] and quantified with HPLC [20].
Samples were soaked in 30 mL of extraction solvent. Solvents described by Anderson et al. [21] and Li et al. [22]
were used. Specifically, an extraction solvent of 50:50:0.1
(v/v) hexane-ethanol-phosphoric acid mixture was used
for Hydrastis canadensis while a 100:0.1 (v/v) methanolphosphoric acid was used for Coptis trifolia and Coptis chinensis. These acidified polar solvents effectively extract the
isoquinoline alkaloids in their highly soluble, protonated
forms. We carried out the method of Li et al. [22], except
that MAE was employed to shorten the overnight extraction time. The samples were placed in a Aurora MW500
microwave (Aurora Instruments, Canada) programmed to
ramp temperature from 25°C to 120°C in four minutes,
followed by 90 minutes of extraction at 120°C. Filtered
extracts were dried in a Heidolph roto-vaporizer (Heidolph Elektro, Germany) under vacuum of 367 mbar at
70°C and 150 rpm. The dried residue was dissolved in a
minimal volume of 100% HPLC-grade acetonitrile, ranging from 400 μl to 2 mL (depending on the residue quantity) for 24 hours.
HPLC analyses were performed according to the validated
method of Weber et al. [20] on a ThermoSeparations SpectraSYSTEM (Thermo Scientific, USA) chromatograph with
an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 (4.6 mm × 250 mm × 5 μm)
column (Agilent Technologies, USA). The flow rate of the
mobile phase, which consisted of 0.2 M ammonium acetate (pH 4.85) and acetonitrile (69:31, v/v), was maintained at 1.0 mL per minute [20] and absorbance was
measured at 235 nm and 266 nm. Alkaloids in each sample were identified according to their standard retention
times and characteristic A235/A266 ratios. To corroborate
alkaloid identity in samples, we used 'spiking tests' with
known standards. Peak area at 266 nm was used to quantify alkaloid content.
Stock solutions were prepared by weighing 5 mg of standard with a Cahn C-35 microbalance (Themo Scientific,
USA) into individual 10 mL volumetric flasks and diluting

it to volume with water and acetonitrile (10:90 v/v). A 5
mL aliquot of each stock solution was transferred into a
25 mL volumetric flask and diluted to volume with water
and acetonitrile (70:30, v/v). Wrapped in aluminum foil
and refrigerated, the stock solutions were stable for over
two months. Various volumes of standards were analyzed
in triplicates to produce standard curves (0.5 to 2 μg).
Individual calibration curves, plotted for each alkaloid,
were linear (R2 > 0.99) over the range of interest.

As the data did not meet the assumption of equal variance, we used non-parametric tests instead of parametric
tests for statistical analyses. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to
compare Berberine content was compared amongbetween
Hydrastis canadensis, Coptis trifolia and Coptis chinensis,
whereas Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare coptisine content between Coptis trifolia and Coptis chinensis.

Figure 1 shows the representative chromatograms of the
three herbs. Berberine was quantified in all three species.
Coptisine was quantified in Coptis chinensis and Coptis trifolia. Hydrastine and palmatine were unique to Hydrastis
canadensis and Coptis chinensis respectively but absent in
Coptis trifolia. The Kruskal-Wallis test indicates a significant difference (H = 49.67, P < 0.0001) in berberine content among the three species. Hydrastis canadensis has the
greatest berberine content, followed by Coptis chinensis
and Coptis trifolia (Table 1). The Mann-Whitney U test
indicates a significant difference (Z = 3.45, P < 0.0001) in
the coptisine content in the rhizomes of Coptis trifolia and
Coptis chinensis. Coptis trifolia has higher mean coptisine
content than that of Coptis chinensis.

If there is any difference in photochemical content, possible interactions [24], toxicity of the active constituents
and the phytochemicals introduced from the American
species should be studied. Otherwise, substitution of the
Chinese species by the American ones is not recommended.

These results show that Hydrastis canadensis is the best
source for berberine, whereas Coptis trifolia is the best
source for coptisine. Neither of the two North American
species has all the alkaloids found in their Chinese congener Coptis chinensis. Hydrastis canadensis and Coptis trifolia
together contain all the alkaloids found in Coptis chinensis
except palmatine. Therefore, a combined formulation of
the two North American herbs may provide most of the
alkaloids in Coptis chinensis and may be acceptable to the
North American dietary supplements industry if only a
few key phytochemicals are required [23]. As growth conditions can influence alkaloid content of a plant, further
investigation is indeed needed on how cultivation of the
American species may make the substitution possible.
