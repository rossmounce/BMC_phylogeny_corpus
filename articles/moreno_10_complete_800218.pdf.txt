Abstract
Background: The complete sequences of the mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) of members of the northern and
southern genotypes of Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) darlingi were used for comparative studies to estimate the time to
the most recent common ancestor for modern anophelines, to evaluate differentiation within this taxon, and to seek
evidence of incipient speciation.
Methods: The mtDNAs were sequenced from mosquitoes from Belize and Brazil and comparative analyses of structure
and base composition, among others, were performed. A maximum likelihood approach linked with phylogenetic
information was employed to detect evidence of selection and a Bayesian approach was used to date the split
between the subgenus Nyssorhynchus and other Anopheles subgenera.
Results: The comparison of mtDNA sequences within the Anopheles darlingi taxon does not provide sufficient
resolution to establish different units of speciation within the species. In addition, no evidence of positive selection in
any protein-coding gene of the mtDNA was detected, and purifying selection likely is the basis for this lack of diversity.
Bayesian analysis supports the conclusion that the most recent ancestor of Nyssorhynchus and Anopheles+Cellia was
extant ~94 million years ago.
Conclusion: Analyses of mtDNA genomes of Anopheles darlingi do not provide support for speciation in the taxon. The
dates estimated for divergence among the anopheline groups tested is in agreement with the geological split of
western Gondwana (95 mya), and provides additional support for explaining the absence of Cellia in the New World,
and Nyssorhynchus in the Afro-Eurasian continents.
Background
Anopheles darlingi is a major malaria vector in the Americas [1]. Its broad geographical distribution, ranging from
southern Mexico to northern Argentina, is coupled with a
high morphological, behavioral and genetic diversity [28]. Support for considerable genetic variation within this
taxon comes from the analysis of polytene chromosomes
[6], isozymes [7], as well as nuclear and mitochondrial
DNA markers [8-14].
Analysis of the An. darlingi population structure based
on the cytochrome-oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene
(COI) provided evidence in support of two significant
subdivisions among An. darlingi populations from Central (including northwestern Colombia) and South Amer* Correspondence: mxm40@health.state.ny.us

ica, with FST values similar to those found among
different species [10]. This finding was substantiated by
the analysis of microsatellite markers, which revealed
limited gene flow between Central America and Brazil
and Peru [12]. Also, patterns of variation within the single-copy nuclear white gene, with five fixed non-synonymous mutations detected between the northern and
southern An. darlingi populations (hereafter termed
northern and southern genotypes) [14], were consistent
with the COI studies. Three localities were identified in
the Amazon basin where the two genotypes co-occur
(Iquitos, Peru; Guayaramerín, Bolivia; Fortuna near
Puerto Ayacucho, Venezuela), but no hybrid specimens
were detected there.
Recent studies revealed that the distribution of the COI
gene variants within South American populations, especially those recovered from Brazil, reflects subdivisions

consistent with geographical elements, such as the Amazon River Delta and mountains in southeastern Brazil, as
barriers to gene flow [13]. Significant population structure of An. darlingi, identified using microsatellites markers, also was reported in a malaria-endemic region of
eastern Amazonian Brazil [11,12].
Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that An.
darlingi is experiencing incipient speciation, with the
northern and southern genotypes as the units of speciation [12], although other results appear to counter this
hypothesis [9]. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the
status of this taxon and elucidate the processes driving
divergence between alternative genotypes.
The mtDNA markers are used often for phylogenetic
and population genetics analyses because of ease of their
amplification and high information content at different
evolutionary levels, including variation within and
between populations [15,16]. To date, mtDNA genomes
are available for only three anopheline species, belonging
to the subgenera Anopheles (Anopheles quadrimaculatus
species A) [17] and Cellia (Anopheles gambiae [18] and
Anopheles funestus [19]). Because the evolutionary lineage encompassing the subgenus Nyssorhynchus presumably branched prior to the divergence of the subgenera
Cellia and Anopheles lineages, mtDNA of Nyssorhynchus
species may possess different characteristics, such as
altered gene order or different selection pressures, which
may affect the utility of mtDNA sequences as markers for
evolutionary studies. The purifying selection mechanism
under which the mtDNA is assumed to evolve has been
questioned recently with some reports describing positive selection acting at the mitochondrial level [20,21].
Therefore, testing the pattern of evolution of the mtDNA
within the postulated incipient species, i.e. to examine
whether the mtDNA is evolving under neutrality versus
purifying or positive selection, can contribute to the
understanding of An. darlingi differentiation.
Different approaches have been used to estimate divergence times within An. darlingi and to determine the
most likely scenario for its diversification. Based on a single mitochondrial COI gene, the date of divergence was
estimated to the Pleistocene, and the Pleistocene refugium was the main hypothesis to explain current distribution [10,22]. Recently, a Bayesian approach was
employed to estimate divergence within other species
complexes, including Anopheles annulipes in Australia
and Papua New Guinea [23], and the Neocellia Series in
the Oriental region [24]. In addition, Krzywinski et al.
[18] calculated divergence dates of mtDNAs using a
molecular clock approach with the subgenera Anopheles
and Cellia, as well as with Aedes and between An. gambiae and An. funestus. No information exists on the time
of divergence of Nyssorhynchus, which is hypothesized to

Page 2 of 13

be one of the earliest branching lineages of Anopheles
[25]. This study tests the differentiation of the An. darlingi genotypes using the whole mtDNA sequence, analyses patterns of selection within this taxon, and infers a
date of Nyssorhynchus divergence from other Anopheles
groups.

Methods
Sample origin and DNA extraction

Two resting female mosquitoes were collected near local
homes from Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil (3° 08'S/60°
01' W) in August 2006 and in Central Cayo District of
Belize (17° 09'N/88° 36'W) in 2008. The Belize specimens
were identified morphologically following the Wilkerson
and Strickman [26] illustrated morphological key and the
Brazilian mosquito was identified based on both Faran
and Linthicum [27] and Forattini [28] entomological
keys. Mosquitoes were stored on silica gel in a sealed container or preserved in isopropanol, both at room temperature. DNA was extracted from whole mosquitoes by two
different kit extractions, a DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Wizard Genomic DNA
Purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI), following the
procedures of the manufacturers.
PCR amplification and sequencing of Anopheles darlingi
mtDNA

The white gene genotype of each specimen was checked
using the PCR-RFLP protocol described in Mirabello
[14]. Gene amplification primers for the complete
mtDNA were designed using Primer3 0.4.0 [29] based on
published An. gambiae, An. quadrimaculatus and An.
funestus mtDNA sequences (GenBank Accession
NC_002084, NC_000875 and DQ146364). Each fragment
overlapped upstream (5') by ~50 base pairs (bp) (see
Additional file 1) and was amplified using a Ready-ToGo-PCR bead (Amersham Pharmacia/Biotech, NJ, USA)
and run on a PTC-200 thermal cycler (BioRad, Inc.).
Amplification conditions included an initial denaturation
at 95° for 2 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1
min, annealing at 58°C for 2 min and extension at 72°C
for 1 min, with a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min.
Amplification products were purified with the Exo-SAPIT kit (Amersham Biosciences) and sequenced directly.
Sequencing of both strands was performed at Applied
Genomic Technologies Core (Wadsworth Center) on an
ABI 3700 DNA automated sequencer. To ensure fidelity
during amplification, each fragment was sequenced at
least three times and a consensus sequence established.
The regions with unclear electropherograms, from the
14,000-nucleotide position covering the whole AT-rich
region, were cloned with the vector TOPO TA (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

Sequencher 3.0 (Gene Codes Corporation) was used for
sequence assembly into contigs and for proofreading
sequence files. Complete consensus sequences were
aligned using the ClustalW application in Bioedit v 7.0
and alignments were annotated in SEQUIN [30]. Identification of transfer RNA genes was conducted using tRNAscan-SE [31]. Protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes
were by comparison with the An. gambiae mtDNA
sequences (GenBank accession number NC_002084).

ently in some species, another approach, the branch-specific model, was also tested [40,41] to detect any evidence
of positive selection in any branch of the designated tree.
For this analysis the whole protein-encoding genes were
used in a combined file, setting the An. darlingi branch as
the background one (ω = 1 fixed), and allowing ω to vary
in the other anopheline branches of the tree topology. In
both approaches, the tree topology for each protein
obtained in PAUP [42] was used as the topology to be
tested under maximum likelihood.

Genomic and evolutionary analyses

Phylogenetic analysis

Nucleotide composition and the Relative Synonymous
Codon Usage (RSU) values were calculated using the
MEGA 4.1 program [32]. The GC- and AT-skews were
used to determine the base compositional difference and
strand asymmetry among the samples analysed [33].
Analyses of sequences also were performed with DnaSP v
4.10.9 [34] and DAMBE v 4.2.13 [35]. AT-rich region
analyses and plot profiles were completed with the
MacVector software (MacVector, Inc) and mreps v 2.5
[36].
To test if positive selection is acting as a force for genotype divergence, the identification of sites with an excess
of amino acid replacements with selective pressure over
long evolutionary time was determined. We calculated
the dN/dS ratio (nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions) using the entire sequence of each gene in pairwise comparisons to investigate the substitution rates in
each protein-encoding gene [37]. In addition, the software PAML 3.15 was used to analyse DNA sequences
with maximum likelihood methods in a phylogenetic
framework [38]. CODEML is one of the programmes that
can detect sites that have been under recurrent positive
selection over long periods of time, e.g., to detect any
departure from the neutrality theory in the protein
sequences of An. darlingi. The selective pressure at the
protein level was measured by ω, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous rates dN/dS, with ω < 1, = 1, or >1
indicating conserved, neutral or adaptive evolution,
respectively [39]. The measure of this ratio provides a
sensitive measure of selective pressure at the amino acid
level. Codon-based likelihood analysis was conducted
under the random-sites model: Model M0 (one ratio)
assumes constant selective pressure across codon sites
and over time. Models M1a (neutral), M2a (selection),
M7 (β) and M8 (β & ω) of variable selective pressure
across codon sites were used to estimate selective pressure and to test for positive selection. Model M0 is the
most simple and can be used to check that parameter
estimates in more complex models are consistent. M0
(model = 0 NSsites = 0) was run to provide initial branch
lengths, and the initial values of this tree were then used
to run the other models. Because selection can act differ-

In addition to An. darlingi mtDNA, the following
sequences were included in the analysis: An. quadrimaculatus species A (GenBank L_04272), An. funestus (Genbank NC_008070), An. gambiae (NC_002084), Aedes
albopictus (GenBank NC_006817) and Aedes aegypti
(GenBank NC_010241). Drosophila yakuba (Genbank
accession number NC_001322.1) was selected as the outgroup [43].
Three different alignments were defined to test the
phylogeny of the samples; one with the whole mtDNA
sequence, the second with all the protein-encoding gene
sequences concatenated and a third new data set with
only 1st and 2nd positions of these protein-encoding genes
to minimize homoplasy in the 3rd codon position [44].
The software Modeltest v. 3.7 [45] was used to determine
the nucleotide substitution model and the alignments followed a GTR+I+γ model (although with different rates)
and were used for the subsequent phylogenetic analysis.
Three different approaches were followed to reconstruct
the phylogeny for posterior analyses, maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
inference (BI). MP and ML were conducted with PAUP v
4.0b10 [42] and bootstrap values calculated with 1,000
replicates. The BI was performed employing MrBayes v
3.1.1. [46], with two simultaneous runs of 5,000,000 generations, discarding the first 25% as burn-in.

Sequence assembly and annotation

Estimation of divergence date

Culicidae fossil records are not common, and while most
of them are compressed, some specimens have been
detected in amber inclusions [47]. Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) dominicanus is the oldest fossil record of the
Anophelinae subfamily in the New World, with controversy in the proposed age ranging from 15-20 million
years ago (mya) based on foraminifera [48] and 30-45
mya based on coccoliths [49]. The deficient Diptera fossil
record offers only an age estimate for the divergence
between Drosophila and Anopheles at ~259.9 mya [50],
and this deep external calibration might not provide reliable estimation dates, especially for the youngest nodes
and for intraspecific divergences within the An. darlingi
taxa [51]. Alternatively, Brower [52] estimated that the

Moreno et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:127
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/127

standard arthropod mtDNA sequence divergence is 2.3%
per million years based on calculations across five arthropod genera. The limitation of applying this information
to our data is that it may underestimate divergences older
than 3.25 million years, because of mutation saturation
[53].
A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach,
(MCMC) available in the software BEAST v.1.4.6 [54] was
performed to infer the topology and the node ages by
estimating the Bayesian posterior distribution of the
divergence. Following the recommendations of the
authors, the uncorrelated relaxed lognormal clock was
applied to estimate how clock-like our data were. The
ucld.stdev parameter was checked, and in all partitions,
the value was close to 0, indicating that the data were
clock-like and that the rate of heterogeneity among species was low. Therefore, an uncorrelated lognormal
relaxed clock was followed [55] and defined the rate prior
to have a normal distribution with a mean of 0.1. The
SRD06 model for the partition in the protein-encoding
genes was selected, as it seems to provide a better fit for
protein-coding nucleotide data [54]. This partition was
run using the GTR with gamma and invariant sites
model, the best fit with our nucleotide substitution
detected by Modeltest. The Yule tree prior is the most
suitable for trees describing the relationships among individuals from different species and it was selected to calculate the divergence time between taxa. Final analyses
consisted of three separate MCMC runs of 20 million
generations sampled every 1000 generations. Tracer v1.4
software was used to confirm the adequate mixing of the
MCMC chains of the three separate runs and to check
that the effective sample sizes of all the parameters were
greater than 500. LogCombiner v1.4.7 was employed for
combining the separate runs into one file. Finally, the
maximum clade credibility tree was calculated with the
mean node branch using TreeAnnotator v1.4.7. FigTree
v1.2.1 was employed for visualization of the node
branches.

Results and Discussion
Genome organization and structure

The complete mtDNAs of An. darlingi are 15,385 bp and
15,386 bp in length for the southern and northern genotypes, respectively. The typical 37 genes in animal
mtDNA, comprising 13 protein-encoding genes, two
rRNA genes (12S rRNA and 16S rRNA), 22 tRNA genes
and a control region are found in both genomes (Figure 1
and Table 1). DNA sequences were deposited in GenBank
under accession number GQ918272 (northern genotype)
and GQ918273 (southern genotype). Genes are encoded
on both strands (Table 1) with some open-reading frames
overlapping adjacent genes (ATP8/ATP6 and NAD4/
NAD4L as reported in other insects [56]), resulting in a

Page 4 of 13

compact genome. The An. darlingi gene arrangement
structure is highly conserved when compared with the
mitochondrion of the other three sequenced anopheline
species.
The nucleotide composition of the An. darlingi southern genotype is as follows: the L-strand has a GC content
of 20.73% and 79.27% AT (A = 35.06%, T = 44.21%, C =
9.23% and G = 11.5%) and the H-strand has A = 44.5%, C
= 16.12%, G = 7.98%, T = 31.4%. The composition of both
strands of the northern genotype was not significantly
different from the southern genotype. The mtDNAs of
both An. darlingi genotypes are biased towards a high
A+T content (Table 2). The overall AT content in the
whole mitochondrion sequence was 78.2% and 78.1% in
northern and southern, reaching 93.68% and 93.67% in
the AT rich region, respectively (Figure 1). This result is
similar to that obtained with other anophelines, although
it is slightly lower than in the other species included in
the study (Table 2). The base composition, measured by
the G-skew and T-skew, i.e. asymmetry in nucleotide
composition, showed both skews (-0.144 and -0.141, for
the G skew) and (-0.028 for the T-skew), indicating the
preference for these two nucleotides, a widespread characteristic of animal mtDNAs [57].
Transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes

The mtDNA of An. darlingi includes 22 tRNA genes with
anticodons representing 20 different amino acids, identical to other anophelines (Table 1).
The lengths of the 12S and 16S rRNA genes are 793 bp
and 1329 bp, respectively, identical in both genotypes,
and are encoded on the L-strand. The ends of those genes
were assumed to be extended to the boundaries of the
flanking genes [16]. As in other anophelines, the lrRNA
gene is flanked by the tRNALeu and tRNAVal, while the
srRNA gene is between tRNAVal and the control region.
Their A+T contents were 82.54-82.39% for lrRNA and
79.95-79.70% for srRNA, which are within the range of
other insects.
Protein-coding genes

Thirteen protein-coding genes could be identified in the
mtDNA of An. darlingi, similar to those of other Anophelinae [17-19]. Start codons in all the protein-coding
genes are conserved and follow the ATN rule described
previously in Anopheles [18], except for the COI gene,
which has a TCG start codon characteristic of Anopheles
[17,18,58]. Eight genes (NAD2, ATP8, ATP6, NAD3,
NAD6, CYTB, NAD4L, NAD1) use the complete stop
codon TAA (Table 1), whereas five genes have incomplete
stop codons, TA_(NAD4, NAD5) and T_(COI, COII,
COIII), which could be completed as a result of postranscriptional polyadenylation [59].

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the organization of the mtDNA of Anopheles darlingi. A) Genes encoded by the L-strand are shaded. tRNA
genes are designated by single-letter amino acid codes; L1, L2, S1 and S2 indicate tRNA- Leu (TAA), tRNA-Leu (TAG), tRNA- Ser (GCT) and tRNA- Ser
(TGA). B) Graphical representation of the A+T and G+C content across the whole mtDNA. X-axis values represent the length of the genome and the
Y-axis represents the percentage.

The codon usage of both genotypes of An. darlingi is
nearly identical (Table 3), and the total number of nonstop codons is 3733 in both. This latter value is similar in
the family Anophelinae, ranging from 3715 in An. quadrimaculatus to 3733 in An. gambiae (Figure 2).
The sequence identity within the An. darlingi taxon
showed a high similarity across the whole genome (Table
4), with the lowest value (98.5) for the COII gene. Moreover, the sequence of the protein-encoding genes is conserved in Anophelinae, while more differences are found
in the Control Region (CR) [60].
Non-coding regions

The mtDNA of An. darlingi contains five intergenic spacers. There are two spacers with only two nucleotides,

while two others are formed by nine and 17 nucleotides.
The A+T region, flanked by 12sRNA and tRNAIle, has 574
and 573 nucleotides (northern and southern, respectively), and is presumed to be the origin of DNA replication of the organelle, as reported in other insects [61].
High levels of sequence divergence were found in the CRs
among anopheline species, even when low diversity was
detected in other genes (Table 4). This is consistent with
the CR variation observed among dipteran mtDNAs [60].
Four motifs have been described in arthropod CRs: long
sequence of thymines, tandem repeat sequences, a subregion of even higher A+T content and stem-loop structures [62]. The CR of the An. darlingi genotypes showed
only 15 variable sites among them, including nine indels

(five insertions in the northern genotype). This is surprisingly small variation, even lower than within the An. gambiae complex, where 52 variable positions in CR were
described [63]. The anopheline CR does not have the distinct domains seen in other insects [64]. In addition, the
T-stretch structure, hypothesized as the regulation of
transcription of the mtDNA, is located in position 142
(17 bp of extension) and this structure is a commonly

observed in the other anophelines analysed as well in
other Diptera, and in different insect orders [60,64,65].
Phylogenetic analyses

The relationships among Anopheles inferred using the
MP, ML and Bayesian approaches are consistent with earlier reports based on mitochondrial and nuclear genes
[25]. Nyssorhynchus was inferred as a sister taxon to
Anopheles + Cellia with high bootstrap support for each

node. Inconsistent topology was obtained only in the case
of rDNA sequences, which grouped Anopheles with Nyssorhynchus, likely due to non-independence of substitutions within loop regions in rDNA genes. Thus, the tree
topology was consistent and employed in posterior estimation of parameters in tests of selection.
No evidence of positive selection in the mtDNA

The Likelihood Ratio Test did not detect any sites under
positive selection in any mtDNA gene. Parameter estimations of the variable ω were derived under different models for the 13 protein-encoding genes (Table 5). Analyses
conducted with all the partitions were consistent with the
conclusion that there is no positive selection acting on
the protein-encoding genes of An. darlingi mtDNA, and
that those are evolving by purifying selection. Even with
models that allow variable selective pressure among sites
(M2), ω values are distant from 1 and no indication of different selection intensities was detected. Under M8, the ω
was >1 in three genes, NAD4, NAD6 and COIII, with less
than one site with this pattern, although the comparison
between models was insignificant. This could be an indication of a lack of power of the analysis, perhaps as a
result of the few sequences that were available, the low
divergence between them, or the lack of power of the

Likelihood Ratio Test [39]. Concerns about small sample
size and sequence divergence have been discussed [66].
Recently, it has been established that reasonable statistical power can be achieved with up to five genomes with
divergence similar to those observed among some bacterial strains [67]. In addition, a recent study based on
molecular evolution in mosquito immunity-related genes
used this approach with similar sample size and with reliable results [68].
Estimates of time of most recent common ancestor

The analyses performed with all mtDNA genes pushed
back the split between Culicinae (subgenus Stegomyia)
and Anophelinae (genus Anopheles) to 190 mya, in the
Early Jurassic. The Anopheles radiation took place during
the Early Cretaceous (130 mya), and the most recent
ancestor of the Anopheles and Cellia subgenera is estimated at 107 mya. Finally, the split within the Cellia subgenus (An. gambiae and An. funestus) was estimated at 82
mya. Alternatively, the analysis of the protein-coding
genes provides earlier divergence dates, and although
they correspond to the same geological periods, the
nodes are dated more recently in agreement with an older
origin of the mosquitoes in the Jurassic [69,70]. A recent
study based on six nuclear genes and morphological

characters provides further support for a Jurassic origin
of mosquitoes although the estimated divergence
between Anopheles and Cellia was more recent (~43
mya) than the dates derived from our study [71]. The different evolutionary histories of the molecular markers
(mtDNA vs nDNA), besides incomplete species sampling, may explain the apparent incongruence between
the dates.
The inclusion of an additional calibration point of the
divergence of Anophelinae and Culicinae estimated to
120 mya in the Early Cretaceous [72] was incorporated in
the analysis, providing a node age divergence of the Nyssorhynchus-Anopheles of 79 mya. The process of separation between South America and Africa began in the
Permian and the last connection by land was estimated to
exist ~95 mya. In addition, the split between AnophelesCellia took place 58 mya (Figure 3). Altogether, these data
provide estimates for the radiation of the subgenus Cellia
concordant with the loss of land bridges between AfricaEurope and Europe-North America (through Greenland),
that may explain the current distribution of the Cellia
subgenus, absent in the Americas. Anopheles distribution
across the American continent, in agreement with the
radiation dates derived from this study, is sustained from

a latitudinal migration and subsequent radiation from the
north to the south. The large confidence intervals of both
analyses include congruent dates that fit with the above
explanation, although these estimates should be read
carefully, since the use of few calibration points could
provide weak estimates of divergence [73].
The study of incipient species has been of paramount
importance in the understanding of speciation in different organisms [74,75]. Even though there is strong evidence for diverging genotypes in An. darlingi, its mtDNA
does not sustain this level of variance. The persistence of
permeable barriers that permit exchange of genetic information within genotypes could preclude the detection of
the differentiation. Questions focused on reproductive
isolation among the An. darlingi genotypes need to be
addressed, as well as assortative mating features between
co-existing populations. Taxa with a recent divergence
time are expected to share ancestral variation in high proportions, which may confound the reconstruction of their
historical relationships. Furthermore, it is likely that
young species, with a recent divergence process, have
fixed differences only at genes directly responsible for
speciation. The major African malaria vector, An. gambiae, has incomplete barriers to gene flow, where diver-

Moreno et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:127
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/127

gent selection is acting on local regions of the genome,
and gradually increasing the divergence of the populations until gene flow disappears between them [76,77].
Further support for this form of divergence was provided
with the "speciation island model", which suggests small
regions with high differentiation in the genome of this
taxon [77,78].
The current studies focused on deciphering the complete genome of An. darlingi will provide new elements
and tools to further evaluate the speciation of this taxon.
Subsequently, the potential identification of genes affecting speciation should improve the surveillance and management of malaria programs in the Americas and help to
elucidate the different patterns of malaria transmission
involving An. darlingi.
In addition, the radiation of anophelinae species underscores the significance of these studies together with the
origin of malaria parasites. The link between the anophelines in the New World and malaria parasites is still controversial [79-81]. If human Plasmodium parasites were
transferred to the Americas by European colonialists in
post-Colombian times, then the contact between neotropical malaria vectors and protozoan is very recent. This
supports the hypothesis that the susceptibility of mosquitoes to malaria infection is a basal characteristic and further investigations should be conducted to elucidate the
refractoriness to this parasite in non-malaria vector species.

Conclusions
The lack of conclusive evidence of speciation at the
mtDNA level demands further investigation of other
markers, such as nuclear genes that can reflect differences in ecological preferences within An. darlingi. The
divergence dates estimated for the subgenus Nyssorhynchus provide valuable information, which, although
there is a need to be cautious, because the constraints of
the method gave an approximation of the radiation of this
group. Finally, it seems that purifying selection is predominant at the mitochondrial level, and the differences
observed within the taxon may not be a consequence of
that force.
