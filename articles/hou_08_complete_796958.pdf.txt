Abstract
Background: The phylum Verrucomicrobia is a widespread but poorly characterized bacterial clade.
Although cultivation-independent approaches detect representatives of this phylum in a wide range
of environments, including soils, seawater, hot springs and human gastrointestinal tract, only few
have been isolated in pure culture. We have recently reported cultivation and initial
characterization of an extremely acidophilic methanotrophic member of the Verrucomicrobia, strain
V4, isolated from the Hell's Gate geothermal area in New Zealand. Similar organisms were
independently isolated from geothermal systems in Italy and Russia.
Results: We report the complete genome sequence of strain V4, the first one from a
representative of the Verrucomicrobia. Isolate V4, initially named "Methylokorus infernorum" (and
recently renamed Methylacidiphilum infernorum) is an autotrophic bacterium with a streamlined
genome of ~2.3 Mbp that encodes simple signal transduction pathways and has a limited potential
for regulation of gene expression. Central metabolism of M. infernorum was reconstructed almost

completely and revealed highly interconnected pathways of autotrophic central metabolism and
modifications of C1-utilization pathways compared to other known methylotrophs. The M.
infernorum genome does not encode tubulin, which was previously discovered in bacteria of the
genus Prosthecobacter, or close homologs of any other signature eukaryotic proteins. Phylogenetic
analysis of ribosomal proteins and RNA polymerase subunits unequivocally supports grouping
Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae into a single clade, the PVC superphylum, despite
dramatically different gene content in members of these three groups. Comparative-genomic
analysis suggests that evolution of the M. infernorum lineage involved extensive horizontal gene
exchange with a variety of bacteria. The genome of M. infernorum shows apparent adaptations for
existence under extremely acidic conditions including a major upward shift in the isoelectric points
of proteins.
Conclusion: The results of genome analysis of M. infernorum support the monophyly of the PVC
superphylum. M. infernorum possesses a streamlined genome but seems to have acquired numerous
genes including those for enzymes of methylotrophic pathways via horizontal gene transfer, in
particular, from Proteobacteria.

Background
The phylum Verrucomicrobia is an intriguing but poorly
characterized group of bacteria. Representatives of this
phylum have been found in a wide range of habitats
including soils, aquatic systems, marine sediments, and
hot springs; some even occur as endosymbionts [1].
Although various members of Verrucomicrobia are estimated to constitute up to 10% of all bacteria in soil, very
few have ever been grown in culture [1] and little is understood about their ecological role(s) in the environment.
Recent phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA sequences suggest that Verrucomicrobia form a clade with Planctomycetes,
Chlamydiae, Lentisphaerae, Poribacteria, and OP3. This
putative bacterial clade, which is referred to as the PVC
superphylum, unites organisms with a remarkably broad
range of lifestyles, from intracellular parasites with some
of the smallest known genomes to complex soil organisms [1,2].
We have recently isolated an extremely acidophilic and
thermophilic methanotroph belonging to the phylum
Verrucomicrobia, which was have tentatively named "Methylokorus infernorum" strain V4 [3]. This bacterium was isolated from a soil sample in Hell's Gate (Tikitere), a
methane-emitting geothermal field in the North Island of
New Zealand. The organism grows optimally at pH
between 2.0 to 2.5 and temperature of 60°C when supplemented with 25% (v/v) methane as the sole source of
energy. Two additional isolates of Verrucomicrobia, also
with thermoacidophilic phenotypes and greater than 98%
16S rRNA sequence similarity, were concurrently isolated
from other geothermal areas: "Acidimethylosilex fumarolicum" strain SolV from Solfatara volcano mudpot in Italy,
and "Methyloacida kamchatkensis" strain Kam1 from an

acidic hot spring in Kamchatka, Russia [4,5]. The three
methanotrophic Verrucomicrobia isolates [3-5] are now
being proposed collectively to represent the genus 'Methylacidiphilum' (manuscript in preparation). Isolate V4 will
be proposed under the name 'Methylacidiphilum infernorum'. Since none of these isolates has been formally
described so far, we use designations 'strain V4' and "M.
infernorum" interchangeably in this paper, although the
appropriate name for the organism at this time should be
"Candidatus Methylacidiphilum infernorum" [6].
Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria thrive in surface sediments of wetlands, lakes and oceans, as well as in sewage
sludge and soils. Until recently, all cultivated species
belonged to the Alpha- and Gamma- classes of the phylum
Proteobacteria (reviewed in [7]). Although some acidophilic proteobacterial methanotrophs have been isolated,
none of these grow optimally below pH 5 [8-10].
Together, the three Verrucomicrobia isolates form the only
known group of aerobic methanotrophs outside of the
Proteobacteria phylum, and are by far the most acidophilic
bacteria capable of methane oxidation [3-5].
Failure of standard primer sets and radioactive probes to
detect key enzymes involved in methanotrophy in two of
the recent studies of methanotrophic Verrucomicrobia [3,5]
emphasizes the importance of complete genome sequencing for elucidating the physiology of these previously
unknown methane oxidizers. Here, we report the complete genome sequence and annotation of the first methanotrophic bacterium of the Verrucomicrobia phylum. In
our previous report, based on the draft genome sequence
of M. infernorum [3], we proposed that certain C1 metabolic pathways were common with proteobacterial meth-

anotrophs, while other pathways were incomplete or
missing. Here, we report the complete genome sequence,
explore evolutionary provenances of M. infernorum,
present a full reconstruction of the central metabolism of
this organism and propose possible pathways involved in
methanotrophy.

Results and Discussion
Genome organization
The genome of M. infernorum strain V4 [GenBank:
CP000975] consists of a single circular chromosome of
2,287,145 bp. General features of the genome and a summary of the annotation of protein-coding genes are shown
in Table 1 and Figure 1. The origin of replication was identified by GC skew analysis [11] and was mapped 250 nt
upstream the dnaA gene. We identified approximately 20
loci that correspond to a single class of insertion
sequences of the IS605 family [12]. No prophages were
detected but there is a region in the genome that comprises a potential integrative plasmid (Minf_1153–
Minf_1199). Among the 2473 predicted proteins, 731
had no detectable homologs in the NCBI protein database. This fraction of "ORFans" is similar to those
reported for the first sequenced genomes from other bacterial phyla and is consistent with the notion that Verrucomicrobia form a distinct clade that is only distantly related
to other bacteria. Most of the proteins that had homologs
in the database could be assigned to the Clusters of
Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs, [13]), see Table
1.
Phylogeny of "Methylacidiphilum infernorum" V4
Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence of M. infernorum identified it as a member of a new subdivision in the phylum
Verrucomicrobia [3], see also [4,5]. Ever since the original
description of the Verrucomicrobia as a separate lineage of
bacteria [14], analysis of 16S rRNA sequences showed

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

clustering of Verrucomicrobia with Planctomycetes and/or
Chlamydiae but the bootstrap support for this grouping
was typically less than 50% [15,16]. Similar results were
obtained from the analysis of 23S rRNA sequences [17].
Recent phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA and ribosomal
protein sequences have led to the proposal that four bacterial phyla; namely Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia,
Chlamydiae and Lentisphaerae, together with two candidate
phyla; Poribacteria and OP3, comprise a single superphylum [1,2]. However, analysis of phylogenetic trees and
shared inserts in several conserved proteins has confirmed
the affinity of Chlamydiae and Verrucomicrobia but failed to
support the affiliation between these phyla and the Planctomycetes [18]. Having determined the complete genome
sequence of M. infernorum and with complete genomes
also available for representatives of Chlamydiae and Planctomycetes, we constructed phylogenetic trees for concatenated sequences of ribosomal proteins and subunits of
the RNA polymerase. In both trees, M. infernorum confidently grouped with Chlamydiae, and the VerrucomicrobiaChlamydiae clade grouped with Planctomycetes (Figure 2
and Supplementary Figure 1 [see Additional file 1]).
However, sequence analysis of the complete set of predicted proteins of M. infernorum revealed a complex picture. The largest fraction (~23% of the proteins) had their
top BLAST hits among proteobacterial proteins, whereas
the fraction of proteins that were most similar to
homologs from the Verrucomicrobia/Chlamydiae and Planctomycetes group comprised only ~7% (Figure 3). These
observations must be interpreted with caution considering the unequal representation of bacterial phyla in current databases (with considerable over-representation of
Proteobacteria) as well as the fact that sequence similarity
is not necessarily an accurate reflection of phylogenetic
affinity. Nevertheless, with these caveats, and considering
the availability of several large (albeit, with the exception

homologs from Proteobacteria is compatible with the
dominance of this bacterial phylum among the known
methylotrophs.
To compare the overall gene composition in M. infernorum with other bacteria, we performed Correspondence
Analysis of the matrix of the phyletic patterns (presence or
absence of the given gene in a given genome) of 59 bacterial species (listed in Supplementary Table 1 [see Additional file 1]) in the eggNOG database [19]. The results
show that M. infernorum groups neither with its closest relatives (Chlamydiae and Verrucomicrobia) nor with any
other bacterial clade (Figure 4). This lack of clustering by
phyletic pattern together with the position of M. infernorum (Figure 4B) near the origin of coordinates (which, by
definition, is the baricenter of the data set) further sup-

ports the notion of a complex history of the gene set of M.
infernorum, with likely contributions from diverse groups
of bacteria. The nearest neighbors of M. infernorum in the
genome content space (Figure 4C) are various members of
Proteobacteria (Rickettsia, Neisseria, Escherichia, Methylococcus), Thermotogae, Aquificae and a single representative of
Actinobacteria (Rubrobacter).
Our attempts to identify a genomic signature for the Planctomycetes/Verrucomicrobia/Chlamydiae superphylum, i.e., a
set of genes that would be present in all members of this
group but in no other organisms, failed to identify any
genes fitting that definition. The closest candidate was a
protein of unknown function, Minf_1886, which is
present in Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes but not in
Chlamydiae (Supplementary Figure 2 [see Additional file

1]). Similarly, of the 12 protein families that recently have
been reported to be specific for the PVC superphylum [2],
only four were identified in M. infernorum (Supplementary Table 2 [see Additional file 1]), and representatives of
all of these families could also be found in other bacterial
clades (data not shown).
Evolution of the "Methylacidiphilum infernorum" V4
branch
Since the gene content of M. infernorum substantially differs from the gene contents of other member of the PVC
superphylum, we used the inferred gene set of the last
common ancestor of all bacteria (LCBA) to reconstruct the
most parsimonious scenario of gene gain and loss in this
branch [20]. This approach assigned 1382 COGs (genes)
to the LCBA [21]. The results of the reconstruction for the
M. infernorum lineage suggest considerable gene flux dominated by gene loss (526 genes inferred to have been lost
and 262 gained). Approximately 75 genes might have

been lost at the level of the last common ancestor of the
PVC superphylum, including cell division proteins FtsX,
FtsE, MinC, MinD, and MinE. Predicted gene gains additionally encompassed M. infernorum proteins that did not
fit into any COGs including most of the genes responsible
for methylotrophy. There are approximately 200 such
proteins that have homologs in the databases and 731
ORFans. In accord with the lifestyle of M. infernorum, it
appears that many genes involved in autotrophy were
gained whereas genes related to heterotrophic processes
were lost (Supplementary Figure 3 [see Additional file 1]).
This dynamic was especially prominent among the genes
coding for proteins implicated in energy metabolism,
where approximately equal numbers of genes have been
lost and gained. In most other metabolism-related categories, gene loss exceeded gene gain.
Notably, many regulatory and even informational genes
were apparently lost, a trend that might reflect ongoing

genome streamlining, especially considering that M. infernorum has the smallest genome among all representatives
of Verrucomicrobia with known or estimated genome sizes.
Some of the apparent gains and losses appear quite unexpected. In particular, M. infernorum seems to have
acquired genes for several proteins that belong to the gene
set that is conserved in archaea and eukaryotes. This group
of proteins includes three subunits of the proteasome
(Minf_1279, Minf_1281 and Minf_1284), and accessory
and regulatory proteins encoded in the same neighborhood, ATP-dependent DNA ligase (Minf_0008,
COG1423), and archease, a protein apparently involved
in diverse nucleic acid modification reactions
(Minf_0305, COG1371). These proteins of M. infernorum
are most closely related to orthologs encoded in other
bacteria; in particular, the proteasome subunits show the
strongest similarity to orthologs from Actinobacteria. These
observations suggest extensive horizontal gene transfer
among bacteria, conceivably, following the initial transfer
from an archaeal source.
The specific gene loss in the M. infernorum branch appears
to be another manifestation of genome streamlining. Several highly conserved informational and housekeeping
genes are encoded in all other sequenced genomes of the
PVC superphylum, but not in M. infernorum. This group of
lost genes includes those encoding the house-cleaning
protein Maf (COG0424), rRNA methylase SpoU
(COG0566); tRNA and rRNA cytosine-C5-methylase Sun
(COG0144), tRNA-dihydrouridine synthase (COG0042),
single-stranded
DNA-specific
exonuclease
RecJ
(COG0608), and the type II secretory system PulDFG.
Several genes, in particular, those for proteins involved in
DNA repair, apparently have been lost independently in
both the M. infernorum branch and the Chlamydiae branch
(these genes are present in other genomes from the Verrucomicrobia/Lentisphaerae branch). These include SbcC
(COG0419) and SbcD (COG0420), respectively, an
ATPase and exonuclease involved in repair of stalled replication forks, and RadC (COG2003), implicated in
recombinational repair. The absence of these proteins in
M. infernorum is unexpected because they are encoded in
the genomes of the great majority of free-living bacteria.
Despite the general trend toward gene loss, we identified
several lineage-specific expansions of paralogous gene
families in the M. infernorum genome. Several of these
expanded families encode membrane proteins. There are
at least 19 paralogs of a TonB-like outer membrane receptor (COG1629) that is involved in import of essential
organometallic
micronutrients,
including
ironsiderophores [22]. There are also 10 clusters coding for the
outer membrane channel protein TolC (COG1538) and/
or the periplasmic (fusion) protein AcrA (COG0845),
which might be involved in multidrug or heavy-metal

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

efflux [23]. Another expansion includes 6 paralogs of the
starvation-inducible outer membrane lipoprotein Slp
(COG3065) [24]. Expansion of these protein families is
typical of proteobacterial methylotrophs and Proteobacteria in general; however, expansion of the Slp family might
be related to acid resistance of M. infernorum (see below).
Reconstruction of M. infernorum V4 metabolism and
adaptations to methylotrophy
Analysis of the M. infernorum genome allowed us to reconstruct its central metabolic pathways and mechanisms of
methane utilization (Figure 5).
Central metabolic pathways and their variations
At less than 2.3 Mbp, the M. infernorum genome is much
smaller than the genomes of proteobacterial methylotrophs Methylobacillus flagellatus, Methylobacterium
extorquens, Methylococcus capsulatus, and Methylibium petroleiphilum [25-28]. Accordingly, M. infernorum appears to
encode only a core set of enzymes required for methylotrophic growth but lacks genes for enzymes of carbohydrate utilization that are present in some of those
organisms. Despite its small (for a non-parasitic bacterium) genome size, M. infernorum is predicted to possess
most of the key metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis
of all amino acids, nucleotides and cofactors, with the sole
exception of the cobalamin cofactor (Supplementary
Table 3 [see Additional file 1]). Several key enzymes of
these pathways were represented by unusual enzyme
forms, for example, in the biosynthesis of folate, the
cofactor that is necessary for C1 transfer reactions.
Although the classical GTP cyclohydrolase FolE, which is
responsible for first step in the folate biosynthesis pathway, appears to be missing, M. infernorum encodes an
alternative GTP cyclohydrolase (Minf_0065), a recently
characterized enzyme that belongs to COG1469 [29].
Likewise, dihydrofolate reductase FolA that catalyzes the
last step of the pathway appears to be missing but its function is likely taken over by dihydropteroate synthase FolP
(Minf_1898), as shown recently for Helicobacter pylori
[30].

In contrast to all other methylotrophs, M. infernorum
employs the 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase of COG0710
(AroD type) but not COG0757 (AroQ type) in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. Similarly, for lipoic acid
biosynthesis, it employs lipoate-protein ligase A but not
lipoate-protein ligase B as seen in other methylotrophs.
Asparagine synthases of both classes (COG0367 and
COG2502) are missing in M. infernorum, so asparagine is
likely to be formed by transamination [31]. Threonine
dehydratase that is responsible for the first step of isoleucine biosynthesis is missing but the product of this reaction, α-ketobutyrate, can be produced from pyruvate and
acetyl-CoA via a three-step pathway involving leuBCD

gene products. Methylacidiphilum infernorum V4 can fix
ammonia both through the glutamine synthesis reaction
and through the carbomoyl-phosphate synthesis reaction.
The latter substrate is used in the urea cycle, for which all
genes are present except for the gene for arginase, which
cleaves arginine into urea and ornithine. However, M.
infernorum encodes 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase
ArgD that can ultimately supply ornithine back to the
cycle through a part of the TCA cycle and glutamate synthesis (Figure 5). Other methylotrophs possess neither
arginase nor ArgD. In addition to assimilating ammonia,
M. infernorum should be able to fix gaseous nitrogen, as it
possesses a complete set of genes for nitrogen fixation.
The genome encompasses a gene cluster for iron-molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase (Minf_1869–76) and two

additional clusters that contain genes for biogenesis of
cofactors, scaffolding and electron transfer proteins
(Minf_0453–463, Minf_0465–477), as well as a Mo/Fenitrogenase-specific transcriptional regulator NifA
(Minf_0464). Most of these genes and their organization
in putative operons are very similar to those of Methylococcus capsulatus [28], a methanotroph that has been shown
to fix nitrogen (see [32] and references therein).
Another notable difference between M. infernorum and
other methylotrophs is the number and diversity of transporters encoded in their genomes. Even when the
genomic data are normalized for its smaller genome size,
M. infernorum encodes fewer transporters than any of the
other four completely sequenced genomes of methylo-

trophs, as well as many other bacteria (Supplementary
Figure 4 [see Additional file 1]). A similar pattern is seen
with transcriptional regulators, which apparently have
been lost during the evolution of M. infernorum branch
(Supplementary Figures 3 and 5 [see Additional file 1]).
Pathways involved in methanotrophy
We identified three pmoCAB operons that encode the
three subunits of particulate membrane-bound methane
monooxygenase (pMMO). Two of these operons are adjacent to one another (Minf_1506–Minf_1511) in the M.
infernorum genome. As in Methylococcus capsulatus, a separate (fourth) copy of pMMO subunit C is encoded in a different locus (Minf_1500), suggesting a somewhat
different role for this particular subunit. We have shown
previously that the three β (PmoA) subunits of M. infernorum pMMO form a distinct branch in the corresponding
phylogenetic tree and probably evolved via lineage-specific duplications [3]. No genes for soluble form of methane monooxygenase (sMMO) were found.

Methanol is a product of methane oxidation and also can
be available from the exogenous sources [7]. A homologue of mxaF (or xoxF), encoding the methanol dehydrogenase large subunit (Minf_0992), was identified in the
M. infernorum genome together with genes for two proteins required for its catalytic function: a methanol-binding periplasmic protein (Minf_0995) and a cytochrome c
family protein (Minf_0996). However, neither the small
subunit of methanol dehydrogenase gene mxaI nor genes
for several accessory proteins found in M. capsulatus and
other methylotrophs were detected [3]. The lack of mxaI is
not surprising because the genomes of several other methylotrophic bacteria including Rhodobacter sphaeroides,
Methylibium petroleiphilum, and the β-proteobacterium
HTCC2181 lack this gene as well [27,33,34]. Methylibium
petroleiphilum and HTCC2181 possess other mxa accessory
genes that were not found in the genome of M. infernorum
but Rhodobacter oxidizes methanol while possessing only
a similar gene complement to M. infernorum. The genes
for enzymes of biosynthesis of PQQ, the methanol dehydrogenase cofactor, are all present (PqqABCDE cluster,
Minf_1233–1237). In line with the trend of genome
streamlining, M. infernorum has only a single gene
(Minf_1885) for PQQ biosynthesis peptidase (PqqL/
PqqF/PqqG family), as opposed to two peptidase genes in
the genomes of other methylotrophs [25-27].
In other methanotrophs, two pathways of fixation of formaldehyde, a product of the reaction catalyzed by methanol dehydrogenase, have been characterized [7].
Hexulose-6-phosphate synthase and hexulose-phosphate
isomerase, key enzymes of the ribulose monophosphate
(RuMP) pathway, were not detected in M. infernorum. In
addition, two distal enzymes of the assimilatory branch of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

the RuMP pathway (6-phosphogluconate dehydratase,
Kdd, and phospho-2-keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase,
Eda) are also missing in M. infernorum. This observation
shows that M. infernorum does not use the RuMP pathway
for formaldehyde assimilation, which has been reported
previously for several other methanotrophs, such as Methylosinus and Methylocystis [7].
Another route of formaldehyde fixation commonly used
by methylotrophic bacteria is the serine pathway. This
pathway involves pyridoxal phosphate- and tetrahydrofolate-dependent serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which
produces serine from formaldehyde and glycine. Subsequently, serine can be metabolized into 3-phosphoglycerate and further used for biomass production. We
identified serine hydroxymethyltransferase GlyA and
most of the other enzymes of serine pathway described for
the methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens [25], except
for malyl coenzyme A lyase (COG2301) and glycerate
kinase (COG1929 or COG2379 or COG4240). Malyl
coenzyme A lyase cleaves malyl-CoA, yielding glyoxylate,
which in turn can be converted to glycine, so serine cycle
can start again. Glycerate kinase (COG1929 or COG2379
or COG4240) converts glycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate,
another essential reaction of the serine cycle. The absence
of these key enzymes suggests that alternative routes for
the completion of the serine cycle exist in M. infernorum.
Our reconstruction predicts at least two possible routes to
form glyoxylate. One is via the Calvin cycle, i.e., the oxygenation reaction of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase
[35], yielding phosphoglycolate, which is converted into
glyoxylate. Another route is via the downstream reactions
of glycolysis followed by the glyoxylate shunt. This pathway is absent in other methanotrophs but might be the
main route leading to glyoxylate regeneration in M. infernorum (Figure 5), as proposed earlier [3]. We did not
detect genes specific for the glyoxylate regeneration cycle
and the associated poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) pathway that has been characterized in some other methylotrophs [25]. However, M. infernorum encodes an unusual
protein (Minf_1669) that contains a serine hydroxymethyltransferase domain and two additional domains that are
homologous, respectively, to low molecular weight phosphatase and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase B. The domain
composition of this protein suggests a tight connection
between the serine pathway and the pentose phosphate
pathway. In addition to methane oxidation, M. infernorum
possesses some of the genes, albeit not all, that are
required to utilize methylamine via the methylamine
dehydrogenase system [36,37]. To date, however, we have
not been successful in growing the culture on methylamine as the sole substrate [3].

Formaldehyde oxidation pathways are present in all
known organisms capable of growth on methane and
methanol and appear to be essential for energy generation
during methylotrophic growth [25,38]. All these organisms have pathways for transferring C1 units between the
oxidation levels of formaldehyde and formate. All the
pathways require folate cofactors and include one or more
formate dehydrogenase complexes. Although M. infernorum encodes the complete formaldehyde oxidation pathway, it does not have the methylene-H4F dehydrogenase
and methenyl-H4F cyclohydrolase enzymes that have
been characterized in other methylotrophs. Instead, like
many other bacteria, it apparently uses the folD gene product to perform the same reactions (Figure 5). The tetrahydromethanopterin cofactor-based "archaeal" pathway for
C1 transfer found in all other methylotrophs [25-27,39] is
not present in the M. infernorum genome.
Degradation of the cell division machinery
Like other members of the PVC superphylum, M. infernorum shows gene loss and alteration of multiple components of the cell-division protein machinery. As indicated
above, genes for FtsX, FtsE, MinC, MinD, and MinE have
been lost in the M. infernorum lineage, whereas the ftsZ
gene apparently has experienced a period of accelerated
evolution (data not shown) as previously demonstrated
for the ftsZ genes of several Prosthecobacter species, which
also belong to the Verrucomicrobia [40]. In contrast, the
rate of evolution of ftsK and ftsA genes did not seem to be
affected (data not shown). Unlike Prosthecobacter dejongeii
[41,42], M. infernorum does not encode tubulin or
homologs of any other distinctive eukaryotic proteins
involved in cell division or cytoskeletal functions. Both
Chlamydia and Planctomycetes show morphological correlates of the altered cell-division apparatus, a unique condensed form of chromatin in the former and a striking,
nucleus-like enclosure containing the chromosome in the
latter [43,44]. The observations on the unusual planctomycete cell morphology, some hints from planctomycete
genome analysis, and the finding of tubulin in Prosthecobacter dejongeii have led to speculation on the potential
relevance of the cell division mechanism in this group of
bacteria to evolution of the eukaryotic nucleus and
cytoskeleton [45]. Neither detailed analyses of the planctomycete genomes.([46,47] nor the present analysis of the
first completed verrucomicrobial genome provide any
support for this idea. However, it does seem that there was
a major alteration of cell division mechanisms at the onset
of evolution of the PVC superphylum, with subsequent
elaborations in individual lineages [48], and experimental
study of division in these bacteria will be of major interest.
Adaptation of M. infernorum to the acidic environment
M. infernorum encodes a glutamate decarboxylase
(Minf_0102) and a potential glutamate/γ-aminobutyrate

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

antiporter (Minf_1788), as well as an arginine decarboxylase (biosynthetic, Minf_2107) and a potential arginine/
agmatine antiporter (Minf_1531). These enzyme/transporter pairs could potentially counteract acidification of
the cytoplasm by binding excess H+ ions and releasing
CO2 [49]. Another potential acid-resistance mechanism
that could be utilized by M. infernorum is agmatine
hydrolysis by agmatine deiminase (Minf_0964), which
releases NH3 that would bind excess H+ ions [50]. M. infernorum encodes neither urease, which accounts for acid
resistance in Helicobacter pylori [51], nor orthologs of E.
coli proteins HdeA, HdeD, YhiD, and YhiF that are also
implicated in acid resistance. However, M. infernorum carries two paralogs of the Na+/H+ antiporter NapA [52] and
six paralogs of the gene coding for the starvation-inducible outer membrane lipoprotein Slp [24], which has an
unknown function but is often co-expressed with acidresistance genes [49].
The M. infernorum genome also carries two operons
encoding H+-translocating F1FO-ATPase subunits, the first
such case among all sequenced microbial genomes. One
of these operons (Minf_2417–Minf_2424) is most similar
to the ATPase operons of other members of Verrucomicrobia (data not shown) and probably represents the form of
the enzyme that is ancestral to the PVC superphylum. By
contrast, the second ATPase operon (Minf_0839–
Minf_0846) is most similar to the ATPase genes from
gamma-proteobacteria, such as Methylococcus capsulatus
(Supplementary Figure 6 [see Additional file 1]), and
might have been acquired by a relatively recent lateral
gene transfer. These enzymes are reversible, so it remains
to be determined whether they synthesize ATP by utilizing
proton gradient (allowing influx of protons into the cell)
or couple ATP hydrolysis with pumping protons out of
the cell.
Adaptations to the extremely acidic environment are also
seen in the amino acid composition of M. infernorum proteins. The distribution of isoelectric points of M. infernorum proteins shows a substantial excess of high-pI (basic)
proteins (Figure 6) and is much more similar to that of
other acidophiles (e.g. Acidiphilium cryptum JF-5) than to
that of mesophiles (Escherichia coli K12) or alkaliphiles
(Alkalilimnicola ehrlichei MLHE-1).
Like some other extreme acidophiles, M. infernorum
encodes a relatively simple signal transduction system
that includes 8 sensor histidine kinases and 10 response
regulators (with 7 pairs clustered in operons), but no Ser/
Thr protein kinases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclases, or
chemotaxis receptors. Although M. infernorum might be
capable of gliding motility (using Minf_0409–Minf_0411
proteins), it has no chemotaxis genes.

Adaptation
Adaptation of "Methylacidiphilum infernorum" V4 to the acidic environment. Distribution (estimated probability density function) of isoelectric points of proteins encoded in genomes of microorganisms with different pH preferences.

Antiviral and stress-response systems
Similarly to most other thermophiles, M. infernorum has
the CRISPR-associated system, which is involved in antiphage defense [53,54]. The system contains a predicted
polymerase cassette (the polymerase itself is encoded by
Minf_0882 gene) that seems to be a thermophilic determinant, i.e. is found primarily in thermophiles [53,55].
Despite the presence of 6 clusters of CRISPRs (altogether
25 repeats), the system might be inactive considering that
that cas1 gene (Minf_0870) that is ubiquitous in CRISPRassociated systems is truncated. Another system often
found in thermophiles is a pair of proteins containing a
minimal nucleotidyltransferase and the HEPN
(COG2250) domain that might be a novel toxin-antitoxin
system (KSM, YIW, EVK, unpublished observations). The
latter proteins also have a role in phage defense and stress
response [56], along with the better studied systems of
restriction-modification [57]. We identified a few toxinantitoxin components in M. infernorum (Minf_0121,
Minf_0349, Minf_1374) and a classic restriction-modification system (Minf_1805 and Minf_1806). There is an

additional locus encoding DNA methylases, helicases and
a nuclease that might have a similar role (Minf_0316–
328).
M. infernorum possesses an elaborate system of heavymetal resistance. Along with the expansion of heavy metal
efflux systems mentioned above, we identified a mercury
reduction system (Minf_0449–Minf_0451), arsenate
reductase (Minf_1582), putative silver efflux pump
(Minf_2037), and a tellurium resistance protein
(Minf_2102).

Conclusion
"Methylacidiphilum infernorum" V4 has a streamlined
genome with a gene complement typical of an
autotrophic bacterium, simple signal transduction pathways and limited potential for regulation of gene expression. With only a few gaps, reconstruction of the central
metabolism was complete and straightforward including
pathways involved in methanotrophy. Phylogenetic analysis of informational molecules unequivocally supports

grouping the Chlamydiae, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia into a superphylum. An important feature of this
clade is the alteration and partial degradation of the cell
division apparatus that is manifest in the loss of several
genes and acceleration of evolution of others. However,
analysis of the entire complement of M. infernorum genes
seems to tell a different story, namely, one of extensive
horizontal gene exchange with a variety of bacteria. The
genome of M. infernorum shows many apparent adaptations for existence under extremely acidic conditions
including a major shift in the isoelectric points of cytoplasmic proteins.

Methods
The genome of M. infernorum was sequenced using the
whole-genome-shotgun approach as previously described
[58]. Genomic DNA of M. infernorum was randomly
sheared to generate 3 kb insert fragments. These fragments
were size-selected on agarose gels, purified, end-repaired
and ligated to pUC118 vectors and then transformed into
DH10B competent cells. Plasmids from positive clones
were isolated using Eppendorf Perfect Prep Plasmid 96 Kit
(Eppendorf) and sequenced using Beckman CEQ 8000
(Beckman Coulter) and ABI 3730xl (Applied Biosystems)
sequencers. A total of 43,008 valid sequences were used
for assembly with ARACHNE [59,60], and SEQMAN II
(DNAStar) assemblers. Further 344 sequences were used
to close gaps between contigs and to improve overall
sequence quality of contigs.
ORFs were predicted using GLIMMER [61] followed by
BLASTX [62] searches of intergenic regions between predicted ORFs. Transfer RNAs were predicted by tRNAscanSE [63] and non-coding RNAs were predicted using Infernal software against Rfam database [64]. Genome annotation was performed by running BLAST and PSI-BLAST
against the NCBI protein database, COG database [13],
and the eggNOG database [19] with manual verification
as described previously [58]. Metabolic pathways were
analyzed by comparing COG assignments of M. infernorum proteins with the standard sets of COGs involved in
each pathway [65], using the data from the KEGG database [66].
To analyze the taxonomic affiliations of M. infernorum
proteins, 10 best BLAST hits (e-value threshold of 0.01) to
the RefSeq database (release 29) were collected for each of
the M. infernorum proteins. Hit score and taxonomic affiliation of the hit at the phylum level were recorded. For
each M. infernorum query, the hits were assigned weights
relative to the weight of the best hit (wi = (si/s1)32 where si
is the score of the i-th hit); the weights were summed
across the taxa. If the weight for the highest-weight taxon
comprised a certain fraction of the total sum of weights
(>75%), the query was considered affiliated with this

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

taxon, otherwise the taxon affiliation of the query was
considered unresolved. In practical terms, if the secondbest hit belonged to a different taxon than the best hit, but
its weight was within 3% of that of the best hit, the affiliation of the query would not be considered sufficiently
resolved.
Maximum Likelihood trees for the concatenated alignments (positions with >33% of gaps removed) of ribosomal proteins (6137 sites) and RNA polymerase subunits
RpoA, RpoB, and RpoC (2625 sites) were constructed
using TreeFinder [67], with the Whelan and Goldman
[68] evolutionary model and gamma-distributed site
rates. Protein isoelectric points were computed using the
amino acid pK values from EMBOSS iep program [69].
Analysis of M. infernorum genome composition was performed as follows: orthologous sequences from the eggNOG database [19] were aligned and converted to PSIBLAST [62] PSSMs. These PSSMs were used in PSI-BLAST
searches against the genomic databases of 59 bacteria representing all major lineages with completely sequenced
genomes (the complete list is given in the Supplementary
Table 1 [see Additional file 1], all genome sequences were
taken from NCBI's Entrez Genomes database); proteins
were assigned to the NOG with the lowest reported evalue [70]. The eggNOG presence/absence table (phyletic
patterns) was derived from this data; patterns with less
than two species present were removed. The first round of
a Correspondence Analysis was performed using the ADE4 package [71] on the data table comprised of all 59 species (Figure 4A; data projected to the plain of the first two
components). The results show that the main trend in the
structure of the phyletic pattern space is dominated by the
two groups of organisms – Cyanobacteria and Chlamydiae
– that are most different from the rest of the representative
genomes. To resolve the structure for the rest of bacteria,
the data for cyanobacteria and chlamydia were removed
from the table and Correspondence Analysis was performed for the remaining species (Figure 4B). Alternatively, the first 40 principal dimensions of the
Correspondence Analysis space were visualized using the
Self-Organizing Maps approach [72] on a 20 × 20 lattice
with toroidal topology. Euclidean distances between a lattice vector and a data vector were linearly normalized to
the range [0..1]. Map nodes were colored according to the
taxonomic affiliation of the closest (after normalization)
genome vector (Figure 4C).

Ragan, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia)

This study reports and analyses the complete genome
sequence of an extremely acidophilic methanotrophic
member of the distinctive Bacterial phylum Verrucomicrobia, "Candidatus Methylacidiphilum infernorum" isolate
V4, from a New Zealand methane-emitting geothermally
heated soil and growing optimally at pH 2.0–2.5 and at
60°C with 25%(v/v) methane as sole source of energy.
Related thermoacidophilic organisms have also been isolated recently from other geothermal areas, and these
organisms seem to represent a clade of methane-oxidizers
in this phylum, a result of significance concerning our
understanding of C1-compound metabolism and evolution of C1 transfer enzymes, since the only known cultivated methane utilizers are members of the phylum
Proteobacteria and the only phylum other than the proteobacteria in which some C1-transfer enzymes (though not
functional C1 metabolism) have been found is the phylum Planctomycetes. Significantly, phylum Planctomycetes
has been proposed on the grounds of 16S rRNA, 23S RNA
and ribosomal protein sequence analysis to be related to
the phylum Verrucomicrobia members in a single 'PVC"
superphylum also proposed to contain phyla Chlamydiae,
Lentisphaerae and the candidate phyla Poribacteria and
OP3, but the support for the group has been relatively
weak, with stronger support for a link between Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae than for either of these phyla with
Planctomycetes.
Possibly the most significant result of this paper is that the
PVC superphylum is supported when concatenated
sequences of ribosomal proteins and RNA polymerase
subunits are analysed, including "Candidatus Methylacidiphilum infernorum". This establishes firmer grounds
for more detailed investigation of the relationships and
links between members of the constituent phyla, at least
for Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae. It also
supports the view that more comprehensive taxon sampling may assist the testing of postulated superphyla, and
suggests that genomes of more genera and species repre-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

sentative of all sub-divisions of phylum Verrucomicrobia
should be sequenced to make this possible and confirm
the present analysis. Of course, the recently explored limitations of some concatenated datasets for phylogenetic
analysis of deep prokaryote nodes [73] need to be kept in
mind. Although this paper reports the first complete
genome sequence for a representative of the Verrucomicrobia, this thermoacidophilic species might not be representative of other soil, aquatic and symbiotic
verrucomicrobia living in less extreme habitats, and this
makes achieving completion of the genome sequencing
and analysis of members of other subdivisions an urgent
priority, including at the least Verrucomicrobium spinosum,
Prosthecobacter dejongeii, Chthoniobacter flavus, Opitutus terrae, Akkermansia muciniphila, the soil isolate "Ellin514",
and the marine verrucomicrobial strain DG1235.
This conclusion concerning a possible superphylum
based on analysis of a limited set of informational – i.e.
translational and transcriptional – genes is complicated
and potentially contradicted by BLAST analysis of the
complete set of predicted proteins, which indicated the
fraction of proteins most similar to homologs from available genes of the PVC group to be only ~7%, while the
largest fraction (~23% of the V4 proteins) had top hits
among the phylum Proteobacteria. Although the authors
admit to certain qualifications concerning over-representation of databases by the Proteobacteria and possible poor
correlation of sequence similarity with phylogenetic affinity, they nevertheless favour a perspective or inference
where horizontal gene transfer (HGT) dominates the
architecture of the genome, going even further to link this
to proteobacterial methylotrophy (despite the previously
published result [3] concerning pmo genes for particulate
methane monooxygenase needed for methane oxidation
indicating that Methylacidiphilum genes are completely
divergent from those of methylotrophic proteobacteria).
The acceptance of such a conclusion may be dependent on
the validity of such BLAST analysis, the problems with
which in relation to gene transfer detection have been
subject to detailed analysis [74-76] and such problems
may also apply to this case. There appear to be no other
criteria than bioinformatic BLAST or COG analysis to
strengthen the conclusion of HGT in this case, and there
is then a temptation to consistency with the 'global HGT'
dogma without sufficient grounds for high probability
that HGT is the only explanation for such results. In other
words, there may be other explanations for this apparently contradictory relationship to proteobacteria which
need to be considered.
Does phylogenetic analysis of individual genes hypothesized to have been transferred indicate a particular group
of proteobacteria from which the transfer may have
occurred recently, or is this proposed to be an ancient

Page 14 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:26

transfer, in which case how is it to be distinguished from
transfers in the progenote? Is the polarity of transfer direction unambiguous? Of course even following such analysis,
alternative
explanations
for
phylogenetic
misplacement of taxa within an alien clade may also then
have to be considered.
To strengthen their conclusions, the authors do include a
Correspondence Analysis, a type of gene content analysis,
which isolates M. infernorum away from either members
of phyla Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae or any other bacterial clade. They interpret this as supporting a complex
history for the gene set of M. infernorum, reflecting contributions of genes from diverse groups, since nearest neighbours in genome content space are members of phylum
Proteobacteria, Thermotogae, Aquificae and one Actinobacteria genus. Is there an explanation for this analysis alternative to gene transfer? The inclusion of the deep-branching
Thermotogae and Aquificae is interesting, and suggests that
one alternative which might be considered is that Verrucomicrobia, or at least this representative of the phylum,
might harbour gene contributions which either occurred
during the early radiation of the Bacteria or even earlier
when phyla of the domain Bacteria were not distinguishable. More detailed phylogenetic analysis of the genes
used in the genome content analysis may be needed to test
such an alternative.
The authors do note the caveats which have to be applied
to at least their BLAST analysis, but various methods for
confirming the hypothesis of lateral gene transfer such as
GC composition, codon usage, or association with possible mechanisms for transfer [76-78] have not yet apparently been applied to the Methylacidiphilum genome
problem, and these might potentially reinforce the gene
transfer explanation derived so far from BLAST and Correspondence Analysis, though it is also possible that ancient
transfer would not be detected by such methods.
The situation of Methylacidiphilum infernorum bears some
similarity to that noted for Cenarchaeum symbiosum by Forterre in his review of the analysis of archaeal COGs by
Makarova et al. [70] where a gene content analysis indicated possible acquisition of euryarchaeal genes via LGT,
in an organism already postulated to have acquired 'lots
of bacterial genes' [70]. As in the C. symbiosum case where
the possibility remains that it represents an early branching archaeal lineage containing bacterial and archaeal
homologs lost in other archaea, the alternative hypothesis
should be considered that Methylacidiphilum and perhaps
also other Verrucomicrobia (and perhaps even also other
members of the PVC superphylum) represent members of
an early branching lineage containing ancient homologs
of genes in other Bacterial phyla which have been subject
to wide (and perhaps even unparsimonious!) loss.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

Further tests to estimate the relative timing of the proposed HGT [79] might lead to insights about this possibility. Evidence regarding potential gene loss is presented
supporting the interpretation that M. infernorum may have
acquired genes for several proteins belonging to the gene
set conserved in archaea and eukaryotes, but again one
asks whether this may alternatively be interpreted not as
suggesting HGT among bacteria following initial transfer
from archaea but rather as an indication of retention of an
ancient signal from an organism close to the LUCA or
LCA. Perhaps such an ancient signal could even stem from
a lineage analogous to the uncharacterized archaeal lineage recently proposed as a root from which eucaryal
archaea-like genes may have originated [80].
The distribution of C1 transfer enzymes is intriguing, since
the tetrahydromethanopterin-dependent enzymes found
in some members of phylum Planctomycetes do not seem
to have been detected, and Methylacidiphilum is clearly
capable of methanotrophy unlike any planctomycete so
far isolated. The existing controversy [81,82] over the origin of the archaea-like C1-transfer enzymes of planctomycetes relating to potential gene transfer versus ancient
divergence suggests however that it may be productive to
examine the phylogenetic relationships of the C1-transfer
enzymes of Methylacidiphilum, especially since they are
clearly functional.
The metabolomic pathway analysis of gene content may
have limitations for evolutionary insights in this case. The
phylogenetic analysis of the pmo genes in this organism in
another publication [3] suggested a divergent evolutionary history from methylotrophic proteobacteria, one
which might even be consistent with a relatively deep
branching core identity for this species, and this line of
investigation might be usefully pursued with other genes
involved in Methylacidiphilum methylotrophy.
M. infernorum appears to display gene loss in the cell division system, and what is interpreted as accelerated evolution is claimed to have occurred in the ftsZ gene.
Considering the non-functional nature of the ftsZ
homolog in the PVC member Lentisphaera, it would be
highly relevant for the data and analysis of the data relating to this claim to be described in the paper – what reasons are there for interpretation of presumably divergent
sequence as accelerated evolution? Why isn't a deep
branching of this and other verrucomicrobial ftsZ relative
to homologs in other phyla an equally plausible explanation for its divergent sequence? Have long branch attraction artefacts been definitively demonstrated as a most
probable alternative explanation for such a deep branch?
What is the explanation of accelerated evolution in the
apparently retained ftsZ but not in ftsK and ftsA, presumed
components of the same ftsZ-dependent divisome?

The view that previous speculation interpreted as relating
cell division in the PVC superphylum to evolution of the
eukaryotic nucleus and cytoskeleton has not so far been
supported may be a warranted view at this point. However, such conclusions rejecting PVC superphylum relevance to eukaryote evolution are not only based on
limited studies but also on studies based on a very limited
sampling of taxa and limited types of bioinformatic analysis. That this may be important is indicated by the occurrence of structures reactive with anti-tubulin antibodies in
the 'epixenosome' verrucomicrobial symbionts of ciliate
protozoa [83,84] as well as the demonstrated tubulin
homologs in Prosthecobacter species [41], indicating a
potentially wider occurrence of this eukaryote cytoskeletal
protein among verrucomicrobia than has been detected
and one not as easily explained by lateral gene transfer as
by an evolutionary retention of a deep signal. Concerning
detection of potentially eukaryote-homologous features
within PVC group members, analysis at the level of secondary structure may be needed to reveal unsuspected
relationships to eukaryote signature proteins such as
nuclear pore complex proteins [85]. Detection of
homologs of PVC proteins among eukaryote proteins may
be expected to be difficult, since even within eukaryotes
detection of important eukaryote signature proteins such
as homologs to nuclear pore complexes may not be trivial,
since exceptional heterogeneity occurs between species,
and BLAST and even PSI-BLAST approaches may fail due
to variation in evolutionary rate alone [86]. This question
does not appear to be as resolved as the authors have suggested, and relevance of any PVC member to eukaryotes is
certainly not refuted by the analysis presented. One might
in a lighter mood suggest that it is not over until the sterolsynthesizing nucleated Gemmata planctomycete sings.
This paper is important for suggesting and perhaps stimulating a number of lines of investigation for future
genomic analysis of the phylum Verrucomicrobia and the
PVC superphylum, but this future analysis should not be
constrained by assumptions concerning easy interpretation of the paradoxes posed by Methylacidiphilum and verrucomicrobia, which still seem unsatisfactorily resolved at
this point.
Authors' response
We appreciate this detailed, constructive review and completely
agree that further phylogenetic analysis, with particular emphasis on detection of HGT, and perhaps, most importantly,
sequencing and comparative analysis of additional, diverse representatives of phylum Verrucomicrobia and the PVC superphylum are required before we understand the natural history of
this remarkable group of bacteria. Where we tend to be more
skeptical than the reviewer, is the possibility of direct relevance
of comparative genomics of the PVC superphylum for the origin
of the eukaryotic nucleus. The results with anti-tubulin antibod-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

ies reported in references 83 and 84 should be treated with
utmost caution. Furthermore, we strongly believe that HGT
from eukaryotes is the only viable explanation for the presence
of tubulins in Prosthecobacteria[41]. The difficulty of detecting
homologs of nuclear pore complex subunits should not be exaggerated; at least, finding orthologs throughout the eukaryotic
diversity was a straightforward (if not, exactly, trivial)
task[47]. Although one cannot rule out surprises from new
genomes, the chances that any representatives of the PVC
superphylum actually possess structures that are homologous to
the eukaryotic nucleus (and, in particular, the nuclear pore)
are exceedingly small. It is another matter that some members
of the PVC superphylum can provide extremely interesting and
valuable instances of independent, convergent evolution of
intracellular compartmentalization.
Reviewer's response in a second review
I welcome the authors' agreement with my comments
concerning the need for more analysis of the hypothesized HGT and for further sequencing and comparative
analysis of additional representatives of the verrucomicrobia and the PVC superphylum. My only comment on the
doubts of even the possibility of direct relevance of comparative genomics of the PVC superphylum for the origin
of the eukaryotic nucleus is that absence of evidence does
not constitute evidence of absence and that beliefs, however strongly held, are not refutations (e.g. the belief that
HGT from eukaryotes is the only viable explanation for
Prosthecobacter tubulins). This is perhaps especially so considering that gene annotation and decision regarding HGT
appears to be a work in progress where no one annotation
effort, especially if automated only, can be assumed complete. Chances that are estimated qualitatively to be
exceedingly small concerning surprising structures within
PVC superphylum members can nevertheless be finite,
and prediction of absence of such structures cannot be
made with certainty. Improved analysis as well as more
genome data may be needed to solve these problems.
Authors' response
We agree.

This paper describes analysis of the genome of strain V4,
an acidophilic methanotroph belonging to Verrucomicrobia. Not only this is the first genome representing this phylum to be formally described, but this is also a rare
precedent of a very fast progress from the isolation and
description of a novel strain to genome sequencing and
analysis, all within one year! This is very exciting.

Major comments
Methylotrophy
As my main expertise is in methylotrophy, I will concentrate my criticism on the parts of the paper that relate to
this area. My main problem with metabolic reconstruction of methylotrophy in strain V4 is realization that the
authors presumed that methylotrophy in Verrucomicrobia
must follow the scheme utilized by Proteobacteria, and
more specifically by Methylococcus capsulatus, a carryover
from the original publication [3]. This presumption is first
stated on page 8. Quote: 'The abundance of proteins with
the greatest similarity to homologs from Proteobacteria is
compatible with the dominance of the bacterial phylum
among methylotrophs'. This does not make any sense,
even if by 'bacterial' it is actually meant 'proteobacterial'.
Of course, methylotrophy in Proteobacteria is most well
studied, but with 99% of microbes remaining uncultivated, we do not really know methylotrophs of which
group are most abundant in the environment (it could be
Verrucomicrobia?), or which metabolic scheme(s) they
employ. Even within known Bacteria, multiple modes of
methylotrophy are recognized, not just the ones operating
in M. capsulatus or other mainstream laboratory models.
As the authors correctly point out, the large proportion of
proteobacterial top hits must be due to over-representation of proteobacterial genomes and under-representation of verrucomicrobial genomes in the datasets they
used.
Authors' response
In the quoted sentence 'methylotrophs' was corrected to 'the
known methylotrophs', and of course, "the bacterial phylum"
was replaced with "this bacterial phylum" (we appreciate the
reviewer pointing out this unfortunate mistake). Otherwise,
however, the meaning appears to be sensible, implying the high
likelihood of HGT in both directions. Furthermore, although we
indeed do not know the actual taxonomic spread of methanotrophy, the majority of isolated methanotrophs, as well as the
most abundant methylotrophs in metagenomic samples analyzed to date [87,88], do belong to Proteobacteria, suggesting
that the dominance of this phylum among methylotrophs in the
current databases reflects the actual distribution in the biosphere.

Indeed, like the previously described methanotrophs, V4
appears to encode methane monooxygenase, possessing
three gene clusters highly similar to the pmoCAB clusters
in proteobacteria (up to 60% amino acid identity). However, this may be the only common step in methylotrophy
that V4 and methanotrophs such as M. capsulatus share
(note that formate dehydrogenases are present in all life).
One obvious problem with metabolic reconstruction
downstream of methanol is the lack of a recognizable
methanol dehydrogenase. There are many lines of evidence indicating that the xoxFJG gene cluster does not

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

encode a functional methanol dehydrogenase, as follows.
(1) These genes are ubiquitously present in both methylotrophic and non-methylotrophic Proteobacteria. (2)
These genes have been mutated in four methylotrophs
that utilize methanol as a sole source of carbon and
energy: Paracoccus denitrificans [89], Methylobacterium
extorquens [90], Methylibium petroleiphilum, and an unclassified Burkholderiales strain [91]. Neither of these mutations resulted in a loss of methanol dehydrogenase
activity. (3) In M. petroleiphilum that does not encode the
traditional methanol dehydrogenase (MxaFI), an alternative methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh2) has been identified, and mutating the corresponding gene lead to a
methanol-negative phenotype and the loss of methanol
dehydrogenase activity [91]. Likely, other methylotrophs
not possessing mxaI and other essential mxa genes encode
alternative methanol dehydrogenases or other types of
enzymes. (4) In mutants of M. extorquens lacking true
(MxaFI) methanol dehydrogenase but over-expressing
xoxFJG, no methanol dehydrogenase activity could be
measured [90]. (5) The recent work is quoted in which the
Xox system has been implicated in 'formaldehyde metabolism' [33]. The evidence presented in ref. [33] is however
so circumstantial that even the authors of this work never
claimed that XoxFJG encoded a methanol dehydrogenase.
Note the lack of methanol dehydrogenase activity and the
fact that XoxFJG appear to be specifically involved in photosynthetic metabolism in Rhodobacter while in V4, C1
metabolism is not connected to photosynthesis. Based on
this knowledge, I would argue that XoxFJG are not responsible for methanol oxidation in V4. What enzyme is
responsible then? Not having access to the complete
genome sequence I cannot tell, but other candidates
should be considered. Note that methanol must not necessarily be processed by a pyrroloquinoline quinone
dehydrogenase. The enzyme in question could be a NADlinked dehydrogenase (used by high GC Gram-positive
methylotrophs), it could be an oxidase (used by methylotrophic yeasts), or, alternatively, it could be a methyltransferase (used by methylotrophic Archaea and also by
methylotrophic Clostridia).
Authors' response
To the best of our knowledge, most of the characterized methanol dehydrogenases belong to a specific family of PQQ-dependent dehydrogenases, methanol/ethanol family (COG4993 in
the COG database, [13]). It is true that this family includes
enzymes with other substrate specificities. In most methylotrophs with large genomes, there are several enzymes of this
family, and if they can substitute each other, this could explain
the retention of the methanol dehydrogenase activity when
some of them are mutated. Furthermore, these enzymes might
have a wide specificity spectrum. The genome of M. infernorum
encodes only one protein from this family (Minf_0992). Other
potential activities of this enzyme, i.e. glucose dehydrogenase or

Page 17 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:26

alcohol dehydrogenase, seem unlikely: glucose dehydrogenase is
rarely found in autotrophic organisms, and there are better candidates (e.g., Minf_0269, Minf_1850) for the classic alcohol
dehydrogenase function. As for potential alternative enzymes to
catalyze this step, that does not seem likely. The M. infernorum
genome does not encode close homologs of either archaeal/
clostridial methanol:corrinoid methyltransferase MtaB [92] or
NAD-linked methanol dehydrogenase (member of the ironcontaining alcohol dehydrogenase family, COG1454), found
in Bacillus methanolicus and related bacteria [93]. Although
M. infernorum does encode a predicted flavoprotein
(Minf_1595) that is distantly related to the FAD-dependent
methanol oxidase of methylotrophic yeasts [94], the low
sequence similarity strongly suggests that Minf_1595 has a different function. All these alternative methanol dehydrogenases
have complex phylogenetic distributions, for example, a close
homolog of MtaB is encoded in the unfinished genome of Opitutaceae bacterium TAV2, another member of Verrucomicrobia. Thus, for M. infernorum, the best candidate for methanol
dehydrogenase is Minf_0992, the only PQQ-dependent
enzyme encoded in its genome.
The second problem with reconstructing methylotrophy,
as proposed, is the lack of any of the major systems for formaldehyde oxidation that have been proven essential (i.e.
the tetrahydromethanopterin-linked pathway, the glutathione-linked pathway, the oxidative branch of the ribulose monophosphate cycle, or the specific NAD-linked
formaldehyde dehydrogenase). Discussion of this problem is avoided in this manuscript. However, in the original paper [3], as well as in Fig. 5 of this manuscript, the
function of formaldehyde oxidation is casually ascribed to
some unidentified alcohol dehydrogenase(s). It is not so.
Few alcohol or aldehyde dehydrogenases actually express
affinity for formaldehyde, so it is very unlikely that nonspecific dehydrogenases could account for efficient formaldehyde oxidation.
Authors' response
We agree, there is no solid candidate for this function. We have
changed Figure 5 to show this reaction by a dashed line. We do
expect the enzyme for this step to be present in the M. infernorum genome but do not have sufficient evidence to suggest a
good candidate.

On another hand, folD and ftfL are present in the genome
of V4, but these genes are ubiquitous, and they are typically assumed to be involved in various essential biosynthetic processes, such as purine and thymidylate
syntheses. However, involvement of FolD in methylotrophy has been demonstrated before, at least in one case
[95,96]. Specifically, FolD, in combination with MetF and
PurU were shown to be involved in metabolism of chloromethane in Methylobacterium chloromethanicum. Interestingly, this pathway is not involved in oxidation of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

methanol by M. chloromethanicum. I think, the presence of
folD and ftfL and the absence of any other systems for handling formaldehyde deserve a more thorough discussion.
Authors' response
We agree. The proposed involvement of FolD (Minf_0806)
and FtfL (Minf_0373) in formaldehyde metabolism (Fig. 5) is
just a conjecture that needs to be verified experimentally. The
quoted references have been included in the main text.

Very puzzling to me was the attempt to imply that elements of methylamine dehydrogenase were present, given
the fact that the organism does not grow on methylamine.
An 'amine dehydrogenase' may potentially be encoded,
with an unknown substrate specificity, but there is no evidence, with a number of essential gene homologs missing,
that the putative enzyme system would be a methylamine
dehydrogenase.
Authors' response
The phrase in question has been modified. M. infernorum
genome contains a 5-gene operon (mauBEDAmoxG.
Minf_1997–2001), which encodes proteins that are strongly
similar to the subunits of methylamine dehydrogenase (MauB
and MauA), methylamine utilization proteins MauE and
MauD and cytochrome c from methylamine-utilizing bacteria
[36]. A MauG homolog (Minf_1905) is encoded elsewhere in
the genome. There is no obvious reason to suggest that these
genes are not functional or have any other specificity. However,
we do note in the paper that attempts to grow M. infernorum
V4 on methylamine have been unsuccessful, which could be
due, e.g., to the absence of amicyanin, or accessory proteins
MauF and MauL. Nevertheless, there remains a possibility that
methylamine dehydrogenase could be assembled in M. infernorum in the absence of those missing genes and that, under certain growth conditions, M. infernorum would be able to utilize
methylamine.

Attempts at reconstructing assimilatory C1 metabolism
were equally puzzling. When it comes to C1 assimilation,
three well-characterized modes are known (described in
detail by Anthony [38]). Two of these involve assimilation
at the level of formaldehyde (the serine and the ribulose
monophosphate cycles) and one involves assimilation at
the level of CO2, via the CBB (Calvin) cycle. The genome
of V4 appears to have all the genes to code for the latter,
but it offers very little evidence for operation of the serine
cycle. Genes claimed to encode serine glyoxylate aminotransferase and hydroxypyruvate reductase actually
encode polypeptides with less than 30% identity to the
respective enzymes with a proven function. At this level of
similarity and without any experimental evidence, these
should be classified as 'an aminotransferase family protein' and 'a putative hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family
protein', respectively. glyA was identified with higher con-

Biology Direct 2008, 3:26

fidence, but this gene is not indicative of methylotrophy,
as this gene is ubiquitous in nature. The two key enzymes
of the serine cycle, encoding malyl-CoA lyase and glycerate kinase are missing. Their absence does not suggest
alternative routes to me, but it rather suggests that the serine cycle is not encoded, and points to the importance of
the CBB cycle. Operation of the energy-demanding CBB
cycle also agrees with the low biomass yields observed for
V4 when grown on methane.
Authors' response
There is little doubt that M. infernorum is capable of assimilating CO2 via the Calvin cycle and lacks the RuMP pathway. The
question therefore is whether all utilized methane has to be oxidized to the CO2 level and then re-reduced in the course of the
Calvin cycle. Obviously, direct utilization of methylene groups,
as proposed in Fig. 5, is a far less wasteful and therefore a more
parsimonious pathway. Reconstruction of the serine cycle as the
potential main route for C1 assimilation was based on the presence of good candidates for all enzymes except for glycerate
kinase. Given the existence of three entirely different classes of
glycerate kinases [97], it is not much of a stretch to propose the
existence of yet another variant of that enzyme. Malyl-CoA
lyase is not needed in our reconstruction because the glyoxylate
shunt is present and provides glyoxylate for the proposed serine
cycle. Nevertheless, we realize that Figure 5 offers only a tentative reconstruction of M. infernorum metabolism. We hope that
this scheme provides a plausible direction for the further experiments which will prove or disprove our hypothesis.

I suggest that the reconstruction of methylotrophy be
streamlined as follows: methane is oxidized by one of, or
by all three of the PmoABC systems. The resulting methanol is converted to either formaldehyde by a (non-PQQ)
dehydrogenase or by an oxidase, or to methyl-H4F by a
methyltransferase (whichever could be identified in the
genome with higher confidence). In the first scenario, formaldehyde would have to condense with H4F non-enzymatically to produce methylene-H4F. The latter is then
oxidized all the way to CO2, and CO2 is assimilated via the
CBB (Calvin) cycle. Fig. 5 should be streamlined accordingly: methylamine removed, non-specific formaldehyde
dehydrogenase removed, the serine cycle and the fantasy
connections to other pathways removed.
Authors' response
We have addressed the concerns about the methanol dehydrogenase above and have every reason to stick to our original
reconstruction here. As for serine cycle, our hypothetical scheme
(Figure 5) relies on the presence of the corresponding genes in
the M. infernorum genome. We are not aware of any organism
that would oxidize methane to CO2 and then use CO2 as the
sole carbon source. Of course, the proposed pathway remains to
be verified (or falsified) in direct biochemical experiments.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

Also in this Figure: the MetF reaction is incorrect. MetF
reversibly oxidizes methyl-H4F into methylene-H4F. The
glyoxylate shunt is shown incorrectly. Isocitrate lyase
(AceA) cleaves isocitrate into succinate and glyoxylate.
Malate synthase (AceB) condenses glyoxylate with acetylCoA to produce malate. All three pmo genes (ABC) should
be indicated, as methane monooxygenase has three subunits.
Authors' response
Figure 5 has been modified as suggested.
Comparisons with other Verrucomicrobia
It is absolutely necessary to re-run BLAST analyses with
the newly available Verrucomicrobia genomes (Opitutus terrae, Bacterium Ellin514 and Verrucomicrobium spinosum). I
predict that comparisons with these genomes may significantly affect some statistics, such as the number of predicted proteins with no homologs (page 6) and the
percent of top hits within and outside of the phylum
(page 7 and Fig. 3). I expect that data on the abundance of
proteins with top hits with homologs in Proteobacteria will
significantly change. If not, it would make for a better
argument in favor of lateral transfers from Proteobacteria.
For the same reasons, Correspondence Analysis should
also be re-done to include these new verrucomicrobial
genomes.
Authors' response
For the revised version of the manuscript, BLAST analyses have
been performed with the latest version of the NCBI RefSeq protein database (as of May 28, 2008) which, in addition to the
unfinished proteome of Opitutaceae bacterium TAV2 (4036
proteins), included protein sets encoded in the complete
genomes of Opitutus terrae (4612 proteins) and Akkermansia
muciniphila (2138 proteins), as well as in unfinished genomes
of bacterium Ellin514 (6402 proteins) and Verrucomicrobium
spinosum (6509 proteins). An increase in the number of verrucomicrobial proteins in RefSeq from 4,036 to 23,697 increased
the fraction of best BLAST hits from M. infernorum into the
Chlamydia/Verrucomicrobia lineage from 12% to 46% but did
not dramatically change the relative contribution of other phylogenetic groups. For example, the fraction of best hits into Proteobacteria decreased from 51% to 30% but they still remained
the largest target group outside of Chlamydia/Verrucomicrobia
(Supplementary Figure 7 [see Additional file 2]). For consistency, other analyses that had been performed on the original
representative set of 59 genomes (Supplementary Table 1 [see
Additional file 1]) were kept unchanged.

Comparisons with other methylotrophs
It has been stated a number of times that the genome
described here is a smaller genome compared to other
methylotrophs (for example, page 12, first paragraph),

Page 19 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:26

and in this light, the genome streamlining strategies are
described. However, the existence of a much smaller
methylotroph genome, of Methylophilales HTCC2181
[34], that is actually the smallest genome so far for a freeliving bacterium (1.3 Mb), has been ignored. It is important, at least in terms of genome streamlining, to compare
these two genomes.
Authors' response
A detailed analysis of the genome of Methylophilales bacterium
HTCC2181 (GenBank accession number AAUX01000000),
while obviously a very interesting project, was outside the scope
of this study, which dealt primarily with finished (completely
sequenced) genomes. In this paper, streamlining of the M.
infernorum genome is mostly envisaged in its taxonomic context within the Verrucomicrobia/Chlamydiae and Planctomycetes group (Supplementary Figure 3 [see Additional file 1])
and in comparison with completely sequenced methylotrophic
genomes (Supplementary Figures 4–5 [see Additional file 1]).
A detailed study of genome streamlining in various methylotrophs would be more appropriate in the near future, after additional complete genomes of methano- and methylotrophs from
different taxa become available to the public. We did not feel
comfortable analyzing in detail an unfinished genome that was
sequenced by others.
Statistics
In Table 1, the number of CDSs is different from the
number of protein coding genes. I think both need definitions. The numbers still do not add up. 1,612 proteins are
included into the analysis and 731 are mentioned not to
have homologs, this makes only 2,343, versus 2,478 CDSs
and versus 2,474 protein coding genes.
Authors' response
The numbers have been corrected according to the GenBank
submission (CP000975), some terms used in Table 1 have
been clarified.

In Figure 3, it is not explained that apparently only proteins with 'hits' were included in the analysis. To improve
Fig. 3, all the proteins should be included. It also needs to
be stated what 'no hit' means, what was the threshold for
calling gene/protein homologs, and what the 'unresolved'
in Fig. 3 stands for.
Authors' response
The legend to Figure 3 has been updated and a detailed description of the analysis procedure has been included into the Methods section.
Organism's name
The authors should state their intent to publish a formal
description of strain V4, and the timeline for that if any.
At this time, three groups cultivating methanotrophic Ver-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

rucomicrobia refer to them as three different organisms
while they appear to represent a single species, based on
their close relatedness at the 16S rRNA gene level. It would
be unfortunate and confusing if all three candidatus names
make it into the literature. In this light, it is OK to mention
the candidatus name preferred by the authors once or
twice, but it is best to refer to the organism as 'strain' or
'isolate' V4 throughout the text.
Authors' response
The three groups that independently isolated methanotrophic
Verrucomicrobia [3-5] have agreed to provide a joint description of the three isolates, including strain V4, proposed collectively to represent the genus 'Methylacidiphilum'. A joint
manuscript is currently in preparation. Prior to submission,
these strains will be deposited in two internationally recognized
culture collections as required by the International Committee
on Systematics of Prokaryotes.

Page 20 and Table 1, the description of CRISPR is not
clear, describe how the 25 repeats are organized in 6 clusters, even better provide a supplementary figure showing
CRISPR along with cas genes and Minf_0882. Is it true that
CRISPR presence is typical of thermophiles? I thought
they were widespread across temperature optima. Explain
what you mean by thermophilic determinant: this gene is
not present in CRISPR-containing genomes of mesophiles? Then you need to explain that CRISPR systems
are also typical of mesophiles.
Authors' response
The CRISPR system is only tangentially relevant to the general
description of the M. infernorum genome and its most interesting features such as methanotrophy and adaptation to acidic
environment. Given our observation that the CRISPR system
might not be fully functional, we do not feel the need to provide
an additional figure. Regarding the thermophilic determinants,
we provide a brief definition and cite an earlier paper [55]
where this has been discussed in detail.

Page 20, last paragraph. The conclusion on 'elaborate system of stress response' does not seem justified as no
description of stress response systems is given, except for
a potentially non-functioning CRISPR-based anti-virus
defense and the putative toxin-antitoxin system (why
should V4 worry about toxins?).
Authors' response
The phrase in question has been reformulated.

Are there any stress-response systems associated with the
extreme ecological niche the organism inhabits?
Authors' response
We discuss possible adaptations to the acidic environment and
cite several relevant papers [49-51].

In this manuscript Hou et al. report the genome sequence
for "Candidatus Methylacidiphilum infernorum", which is
the first representative from the phylum Verrucomicrobia
to be completely sequenced. The organisms from this
clade of bacteria are in general very poorly characterized
and only few of them have been isolated in pure culture.
Hence, the availability of genome sequence for a member
of this group should prove very useful for a variety of studies, particularly in clarifying its phylogenetic placement
relative to other bacterial phyla. The authors have carried
out detailed analyses of M. infernorum genome to reconstruct its central metabolic pathway and have identified
many genes/proteins responsible for its ability to utilize
methane and adaptation to the acidic environment. Several differences were noted from other methylotrophs,
which are mainly alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria. The
work on the annotation of various genes involved in different cellular functions and the differences seen in these
regards for M. infernorum has been competently carried
out and I have no questions or concerns.
Another important aspect of this manuscript relates to the
phylogenetic placement of Verrucomicrobia with respect to
other bacterial phyla. Recent studies by a number of
authors, primarily based on 16S and 23S rRNA [1,2,48],
have indicated that species from three bacterial phyla
viz.Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia-Lentisphaerae
and
Chlamydiae (as well as Poribacteria and OP3), group
together in phylogenetic trees. This has led to the proposal
that these groups or phyla should be recognized as part of
a single superphylum (PVC). In this work the authors
have constructed phylogenetic trees based on concatenated sequences for 51 ribosomal proteins and also the
three subunits for RNAP. The trees based on these
sequences also support the grouping of these species in a
single clade. Other analyses reported here to determine
the closest relatives of M. infernorum (e.g. top BLAST hits,
Correspondence analysis) have provided no clarification
in these regards and these results have been interpreted to
suggest a complex evolutionary history of the Verrucomicrobia.
Main Comments
1. The proposal that the PVC group of species should be
recognized as a superphylum is presently entirely based
on some phylogenies. As noted by the authors, other phylogenetic studies have not always supported this grouping. In our recent work [18], phylogenetic analysis was
carried out based on concatenated sequences for 11 large
and conserved proteins (including alpha, beta and beta'
RNAP). Although these analyses strongly supported the
grouping of Chlamydiae and Verrucomicrobia, a reliable
grouping of the Planctomycetes with these groups was only
observed in the neighbour-joining tree, but not supported
by the maximum-likelihood analysis. Thus, based upon

Page 21 of 25

the phylogenetic analyses alone, it is difficult to infer confidently whether the PVC groups of species should be recognized as a superphylum or not. Because, the term
Superphylum has taxonomic significance, this status
should not be accorded readily unless different lines of
evidences support the inference. In the present work, the
authors have looked for but failed to find any signature
protein that was unique to the PVC groups of species. The
closest they have come to identifying a signature protein
for this group is the Minf_1886 protein that is only found
in Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia, but not in any of the
chlamydiae.
2. The question thus arises whether the placement of PVC
groups of species into a single superphylum is supported
by any other line of evidence besides some of the phylogenetic trees. Interestingly, contrary to the authors' observation that they did not find any protein that was unique
to the PVC groups of species, we have identified a protein
CT421.2 that is uniquely present in all available
sequences from the Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia-Lentisphaerae and Chlamydiae phyla. The sequence alignment
of this protein is presented in Supplementary Figure 8 [see
Additional file 2]. A large number of positions in this
small protein are highly/completely conserved in all of
the species. Besides, the PVC group of species, no other
BLAST hit for this protein was observed. The identification
of this signature protein that is unique for the PVC groups
of species provides additional independent evidence for
their grouping into a Superphylum. Sequence information for M. infernorum was not available to us, but we
expect that this protein should be present there as well. It
is also of interest to note that within this protein, a 2 aa
indel is present in various Chlamydiae species, but not in
any of the Planctomycetes or Verrucomicrobia-Lentisphaerae
species. This indel is indicated to be an insert in the
Chlamydiae species rather than a deletion in the other
groups (see next comment). It is unclear why the authors
in their analyses did not identify this protein. However,
since these results are of importance for the inferences
drawn here (and in earlier studies) concerning the PVC
superphylum and the authors should discuss their significance in the main manuscript.
Authors' response
Indeed, this protein (Minf_0061) is encoded in M. infernorum
genome and, as predicted by the reviewer, lacks the 2-aa indel,
as do other members of Planctomycetes or VerrucomicrobiaLentisphaerae species. This sequence has been missed by our
automated analysis because of an error of the automated gene
calling procedure, which resulted in a truncated 37-aa protein
(YP_001938720.1) that missed 13 N-terminal amino acid
residues and did not produce sufficiently significant BLAST hits
to be recognized in our analysis. We greatly appreciate the
reviewer's comment thanks to which the sequence of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/26

Minf_0061 has been corrected (YP_001938720.2) and
included in the alignment.
Since this manuscript concerns with the phylogeny of M.
infernorum, it will also be of interest for the author to indicate whether the sequences from this species contain the
two conserved inserts in the LysRS and RpoB proteins that
were previously reported to be specific for various Chlamydiae and Ver. spinosum [18]. My updating of the RpoB
sequences indicates that the 3 aa insert in this protein is
uniquely found in all of the Chlamydiae, Verrucomicrobia
(V. spinosum DSM 4136, Opitutus terrae PB90-1, Opitutaceae bacterium TAV2, Akkermansia muciniphila ATCC BAA835 and Bacterium Ellin514) and Lentisphaerae (Victivallis
vadensis ATCC BAA-548 and Lentisphaera araneosa) species,
but not in any other RpoB homologs from different
groups of bacteria including the Planctomycetes (>400
sequences available in the NCBI database), see in the
attached file (Supplementary Figure 9 [see Additional file
2]). The insert in the RpoB protein is thus specific for the
Chlamydiae and Verrucomicrobia-Lentisphaerae phyla and it
provides strong and direct evidence that species from
these groups shared a common ancestor exclusive of the
Planctomycetes. This inference is also strongly supported by
various phylogenetic trees. Since this work reports the first
genome of a Verrucomicrobia species, the close relationship that this group exhibits to the Lentisphaerae and
Chlamydiae species (exclusive of the Planctomycetes)
deserves to be emphasized, apart from the fact that all of
these groups are also part of a higher clade (i.e. the PVC
clade).
Authors' response
Indeed, RpoB of M. infernorum (Minf_0804) has the same 3aa insert, and indeed, this indel supports the existence of a separate Chlamydia/Verrucomicrobia clade, as do our results
shown in Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1 [see Additional
file 1]. However, the Chlamydia/Verrucomicrobia group
appears to be widely accepted in the scientific community
genome, which is why we did not feel it was necessary to stress
this point.

Other comments:
1. The authors should provide some further details regarding the phylogenetic analyses. They should indicate
whether the aligned sequences were edited (if so, how)
and how many aligned characters were present in the final
two datasets that they have employed. The sequence alignments for these dataset could also be included as supplemental data. It will also be useful if it could be mentioned
in the Figure legends that the trees shown are maximumlikelihood trees.

Authors' response
The necessary details on the alignment filtering and the size of
the dataset have been added to the text. In the legend to Figure
2, it is now indicated that Maximum Likelihood trees are
shown. Sequence alignments in the aligned FASTA text format
have been made available on the FTP site [99].

2. Page 7, first line, I am not sure whether Lentisphaerae is
now regarded as a distinct phylum. In the Bergey's manual
(2005) Victivallaceae is indicated to be a family within the
phylum Verrucomicrobia.
Authors' response
The suggestion by Cho and colleagues [100] that Lentisphaerae
forms a distinct phylum has been subsequently validated by
Euzéby [101]. There seems to be a general agreement that Lentisphaerae should be regarded as a separate phylum [1,48].
