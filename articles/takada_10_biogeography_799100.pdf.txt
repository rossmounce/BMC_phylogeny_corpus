Abstract
Background: Carassius auratus is a primary freshwater fish with bisexual diploid and unisexual gynogenetic triploid
lineages. It is distributed widely in Eurasia and is especially common in East Asia. Although several genetic studies
have been conducted on C. auratus, they have not provided clear phylogenetic and evolutionary descriptions of
this fish, probably due to selection bias in sampling sites and the DNA regions analysed. As the first step in
clarifying the evolutionary entity of the world’s Carassius fishes, we attempted to clarify the phylogeny of C. auratus
populations distributed in East Asia.
Results: We conducted a detailed analysis of a large dataset of mitochondrial gene sequences [CR, 323 bp, 672
sequences (528 sequenced + 144 downloaded); CR + ND4 + ND5 + cyt b, 4669 bp in total, 53 sequences] obtained
from C. auratus in East Asia. Our phylogeographic analysis revealed two superlineages, one distributed mainly
among the Japanese main islands and the other in various regions in and around the Eurasian continent, including
the Ryukyus and Taiwan. The two superlineages include seven lineages with high regional specificity that are
composed of endemic populations indigenous to each region. The divergence time of the seven lineages was
estimated to be 0.2 million years ago (Mya) by a fossil-based method and 1.0-1.9 Mya by the molecular clock
method. The antiquity and endemism of these lineages suggest that they are native to their respective regions,
although some seem to have been affected by the artificial introduction of C. auratus belonging to other lineages.
Triploids of C. auratus did not form a monophyletic lineage but were clustered mostly with sympatric diploids.
Conclusions: The results of the present study revealed the existence of two superlineages of C. auratus in East
Asia that include seven lineages endemic to each of the seven regions examined. The lack of substantial genetic
separation between triploids and diploids indicates that triploids are not composed of a single independent
lineage. The ancient origins and evolutionary uniqueness of the seven lineages warrant their conservation. An
overall phylogenetic framework obtained from the present study will be of use for estimating the phylogenetic
relationships of Carassius fishes on the Eurasian continent.

Background
Fish of the genus Carassius (Cypriniformes, Cyprinidae),
including goldfish, crucian carp, and Japanese crucian
carp, primarily inhabit freshwater and are distributed
widely in and around the Eurasian continent, including
Taiwan and the Japanese islands [1]. Although their
classification has not been well established due to their
great variability, they can be classified into at least three
species: C. auratus, C. carassius, and C. cuvieri. Among
them, C. auratus is so variable that its varieties are

sometimes treated as independent species or subspecies
[e.g., C. (a.) burgeri, C. (a.) gibelio, C. (a.) grandoculis,
and C. (a.) langsdorfii]. It should be noted that the
variability is further enhanced by the existence of goldfish (C. a. auratus), which are domesticated ornamental
fish that have been produced under artificial selection
and are widespread throughout the world. Recently,
goldfish were shown to have originated from one group
of Chinese C. auratus [2]. Carassius in and around
Japan are very common and variable. Although Japanese
Carassius have recently been arranged into C. cuvieri
and five subspecies of C. auratus [3], identification of
the five subspecies is controversial because of difficulties

in distinguishing morphological and molecular characters [4-6].
In addition to the variability described above, the C.
auratus-complex includes not only bisexual diploid
lineages but also unisexual gynogenetic triploid lineages
[7-9], and the origin(s) of the triploids is controversial.
Some ichthyologists consider each subspecies of C. auratus to include both bisexual diploid and gynogenetic
triploid lineages [7,10,11], whereas others regard all
gynogenetic triploids as belonging to the (sub)species of
the Japanese C. auratus langsdorfii [3,12]. In the latter
case, C. a. langsdorfii is considered to be a (sub)species
consisting only of triploids with no diploids. To resolve
the complicated situations in the natural history and
systematics of the fish, one must clarify the biological
entities of C. auratus, taking into account the existence
of triploids.
Genetic and phylogenetic analyses based on DNA
information usually are effective in clarifying details
about the biological entity of a “species.” Phylogenetic
analyses of the Japanese C. auratus-complex have been
conducted using the first third of the control region
(CR) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is generally the most variable and is thus useful for phylogenetic
investigations of closely related organisms [13]. Some of
these analyses detected a large degree of genetic divergence between C. cuvieri and C. auratus [4-6]. Heterogeneity was found within C. auratus in Japan, although
the five subspecies of C. auratus mentioned above could
not be discriminated by the analyses based on CR
sequences [4,6]. Moreover, it is interesting to note that
triploid C. auratus is polyphyletic in the Japanese main
islands [4-6], as gynogenetic triploid fishes in other
groups usually are monophyletic [14]. Despite such
efforts in analysing the phylogeny of the complex, wellresolved phylogenetic and evolutionary pictures have
not be obtained because of two biases.
The first type of bias involves the selection of sampling sites in island regions in East Asia. These regions
are biologically important because they harbour old
lineages of various freshwater fishes [e.g., [15-17]. We
anticipate that clarifying the biological entity of the C.
auratus-complex in this region would provide a useful
basis for future comprehensive studies of the complex.
However, in previous studies of Japanese C. auratus, the
specimens examined were only collected from the main
islands and not from the Ryukyu Archipelago. Obtaining
a complete picture of the evolutionary relationships in
East Asian C. auratus is difficult without specimens
from this biogeographically important region, where an
old island area intermittently was connected to the Eurasian continent during its long history [18]. Terrestrial
and freshwater fauna of the Ryukyu Archipelago are
unique in that they include many endemic species and

Page 2 of 18

subspecies that have evolved independently on these isolated islands. In total, 1259 (21.4%) of 5887 known terrestrial and freshwater species are endemic to the
central and southern Ryukyus [19]. For example, the
Ryukyu-ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis ryukyuensis, is considered an endemic subspecies in inland waters of the central Ryukyus [20]. In addition, not only primary
freshwater fish (e.g., the Japanese rice fish, or medaka,
Oryzias latipes) but also brackish-water fish (e.g., the
Japanese mudskipper, Periophthalmus modestus) of the
Ryukyu Archipelago are genetically distinct from adjacent conspecific populations [21-23]. Therefore, C. auratus of the Ryukyu Archipelago is also expected to have
differentiated from other populations. Inspection of C.
auratus from the Ryukyu Archipelago is crucial in clarifying the phylogenetic picture of C. auratus distributed
in the island regions of East Asia.
The second bias involves selection of the DNA region
analysed. Previous phylogenetic analyses of C. auratus
mainly used mtDNA, particularly the first third of the
CR [e.g., [4-6]. Analyses using maternally inherited
mtDNA are highly effective for estimating phylogenetic
relationships of organisms, including gynogenetic populations such as C. auratus, although they are not as
effective in detecting hybridisation conditions [24]. The
abundance of published mtDNA sequences also makes
mtDNA attractive for phylogenetic analyses of C. auratus because these sequences can be used for comparative analyses. However, using the CR is questionable
because a “genetic ceiling” of CR sequences has been
detected not only at the intrafamily level [25] but also at
the intraspecies level [26]. As the possibility of a genetic
ceiling of CR sequences in C. auratus cannot be
excluded, more comprehensive phylogenetic analyses
using other mtDNA regions in addition to the CR are
required. Although mtDNA may not be necessarily
effective in estimating accurate phylogenetic relationship, recent research using AFLP analysis and mtDNA
analysis showed that both mitochondrial and nuclear
DNAs lead basically the same result in estimating phylogenetic relationships in the C. auratus-complex [6].
The present study was conducted to generate phylogenetic and evolutionary pictures of East Asian C. auratus
populations by eliminating selection bias in sampling
sites and mtDNA regions analysed. Specimens of C. auratus were collected from the Ryukyu Archipelago in
addition to areas in and around the Japanese main
islands that have been studied previously. After ploidy
determination of the specimens, we sequenced the
NADH dehydrogenase subunits 4 (ND4) and 5 (ND5),
the cytochrome b apoenzyme (cyt b) genes, and the CR
for phylogenetic analyses using neighbour-joining (NJ),
maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian inference (BI)
methods. The results of these phylogenetic analyses

Takada et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/7

were examined in relation to the geographic distribution
of the species. In addition, divergence times between
main clades were estimated based on the resulting phylogenetic trees.

Methods
Samples

As previously noted, systematics of the genus Carassius
have not been well established. Because no generally
acceptable global classification system for Carassius
exists, we treated all C. auratus specimens (i.e., all Carassius specimens excluding C. carassius and C. cuvieri)
as C. auratus without further classification.
We collected 485 C. auratus from 11 islands of the
Ryukyu Archipelago (Figure 1) using cast-, gill-, and
hand-nets between 2003 and 2006. Most specimens

Page 3 of 18

were released immediately at the same site after collecting blood or fin samples and sexing as described below.
Blood collected from the caudal vein with a small syringe was immediately preserved at -20°C in 99.5% ethanol. Fin clips were also fixed in 99.5% ethanol. In
addition, 43 C. auratus specimens were bought at two
fish markets in Taiwan in 2003, and the collected fin
clips were fixed in 99.5% ethanol.
The sex of all specimens collected from the Ryukyu
Archipelago was determined. Based on previous observations that all males > 60 mm standard length (SL)
from Okinawa Island had pearl organs (small pearly
dots on the operculum, fin rays, and scales) and ejected
sperm after squeezing the abdominal area throughout
the year [27], individuals > 60 mm (SL) with both pearl
organs and sperm ejection were considered to be male;
all others were considered to be female. All specimens <
60 mm SL were regarded as unknown sex.
In addition to the 528 newly collected specimens (485
from the Ryukyus and 43 from Taiwan), we used 23 fin
or muscle tissue samples collected from Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu (Japan), Russia, and China [6] deposited at the Ocean Research Institute, the University of
Tokyo (ORIUT).
Ploidy determination

We determined the ploidy of specimens by measuring
the relative DNA content of the blood samples by flow
cytometry (FCM) using a PAII type flow cytometer (Partec, Münster, Germany). FCM was performed using the
manufacturer’s protocol with minor modifications.
Briefly, 2-5 μl aliquots of blood suspensions were resuspended in 200 μl of extraction buffer (CyStain DNA 2
step: solution A; Partec) and incubated for over 10 min
at room temperature. Subsequently, 800 μl of 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining solution
(CyStain DNA 2 step: solution B; Partec) was added. A
sample of blood collected from a single diploid C. auratus from the Japanese main islands [6] was used as an
internal standard for each FCM profile.

DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing

Nucleotide sequence data for part of the CR (323 bp) of
the mitochondrial genome were obtained from all 528
specimens collected from the Ryukyu Archipelago or
purchased at fish markets in Taiwan. These sequences
were analysed along with 144 published sequences
obtained from a total of 357 C. auratus specimens collected from the Japanese main islands [number of individuals (n) = 236], Russia (n = 3), and China (n = 74),
along with goldfish (n = 44) [2,6,28]. One specimen was
then chosen from each of the different CR haplotypes
from a total of 672 sequences (528 sequenced, 144 published), and additional sequence data were obtained
from 41 of the 528 newly collected specimens and from
23 of the deposited specimens collected by Yamamoto

et al. [6] for the whole ND4 (1381 bp), ND5 (1824 bp),
and cyt b (1141 bp) genes.
Total genomic DNA was extracted from all specimens
using either a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or an Aquapure Genomic DNA Isolation Kit
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in accordance with the
manufacturers’ protocols. All fragments were amplified
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with various combinations of 32 primers (see Table 1 for primer sequences)
using a model 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). PCR conditions were as follows:
2 min at 92°C; 30-35 cycles at 94°C for 10-40 sec; 4855°C for 10-60 sec; 72°C for 60 sec; and a final extension at 75°C for 7 min. For the CR and cyt b regions,
target segments were amplified directly. For the ND4
and ND5 genes, a segment of about 4000 bp from the
ND4L to ND6 genes that spans the ND4 and ND5
genes was amplified. The PCR products were diluted in
sterilized TE buffer (1:20) for subsequent use as short
PCR templates. All short PCR products were purified
using an ExoSAP-IT purification kit (USB Corporation,
Cleveland, OH, USA) and then sequenced with dyelabelled terminators (Applied Biosystems) using the
same primers as for PCR. All reactions for DNA
sequencing were run on ABI 3100 or 3130 sequencers
(Applied Biosystems).

Neighbour-joining analysis of the control region

L13058-ND5-C

The 528 newly determined CR sequences were analysed
together with 100 previously published sequences of the
same CR region from 313 C. auratus specimens (among
which 236 specimens were ploidy-known but the others
were unknown) collected from Honshu, Shikoku,
Kyushu, Russia, and China [2,6,28] and with the 44
sequences from 44 goldfish specimens collected from
Japan and China [2] (see Additional file 1 for accession
numbers). In the first step of the analyses, a NJ tree was
constructed under the best fit model GTR + Γ + I [29]
in MrModeltest ver. 2.2 [30] using the program PAUP*
4.0b8a [31]. Cyprinus carpio {DNA DataBank of Japan
(DDBJ)/EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (EMBL)/
GenBank genetic sequence databank (GenBank) accession number, AP009047; [32]} and Carassius cuvieri
(AB045144; Murakami, unpublished data) were used as
outgroups to root the tree. The reliability of tree nodes
was assessed by the bootstrap (BS) method with 1000
replications.

positions, ML and BI methods that can reflect these differences were used for the analyses. Partitioned ML analysis was conducted with RAxML ver. 7.2.1 [33]. We
prepared five datasets (CR, ND4, ND5, cyt b, and a concatenated sequence of all four sequences) for analyses
and set three partitions (1st, 2nd, and 3rd codon positions
for ND4, ND5, and cyt b) or four partitions (1 st , 2 nd ,
and 3rd codon positions and CR for the concatenated

sequence) assuming that functional constraints on
sequence evolution are more similar within codon positions (or types of molecule) across genes than across
codon positions (or types of molecule) within genes.
The GTR + Γ model [34] (the model recommended by
the author of the program) was used and rapid BS analysis was conducted with 1000 replications (-f a option).
This option performs BS analysis using GTRCAT, which
is the GTR approximation with optimisation of individual per-site substitution rates, and classifies those individual rates into a certain number of rate categories.
After implementing the BS analysis, the program uses
every 5th BS tree as a starting point to search for the
ML tree using the GTR + Γ model of sequence evolution and saves the top 10 best-scoring ML trees (fast
ML searches). Finally, RAxML calculates better likelihood scores (slow ML searches) for these 10 trees and
places BS probabilities on the best-scoring ML tree.
Cyprinus carpio (AP009047; [32]) and Carassius cuvieri
(AB045144; Murakami, unpublished data) were used as
outgroups to root all ML trees.
BI analyses were performed with MrBayes ver. 3.1.2
[35]. We prepared exactly the same five datasets as
those used in ML analyses. Monte Carlo Markov chains
under the selected best fit model GTR + I ([36]; for
ND4 and ND5), GTR + Γ (for cyt b), and GTR + Γ + I
(for CR and concatenated sequences) in MrModeltest
ver. 2.2 were run for 2,000,000 generations. Trees and
parameters were sampled every 100 generations. We
discarded the first 1,000,000 generations (10,000 trees)
on each run as “burn-in” after confirming chain stationarity from plots of likelihood against generation. Outgroups were the same as those used in the ML analyses.

Supermatrix analysis

To conduct a more comprehensive investigation of the
phylogenetic relationships among Carassius species on a
worldwide basis using the best-scoring ML tree topology
obtained from the above analysis as a backbone constraint, we downloaded partial mitochondrial sequences
of the genus from the databases (DDBJ, EMBL, and
GenBank) and concatenated these sequences to the prealigned original dataset in FASTA format for each gene
or region. Of the 306 CR, 77 cyt b, and 8 ND5
sequences, 122, 23, and 5 were judged to be authentic
and reliable with clear locality information with reference to the original paper and preliminary alignment,
respectively (Table 2). These sequences were included in
the supermatrix analysis and the rest were excluded.
Incidentally, these excluded sequences did not change
the tree topologies of the resultant supermatrix tree
when they were included in the analysis, with an exception of one CR sequence from Kazakhstan, whose phylogenetic position was extremely unstable. The
concatenated sequences were subjected to multiple
alignment using MAFFT ver. 6 [37] with the default
parameters. We imported the aligned sequences into
MacClade ver. 4.08 [38] and removed the redundant
regions appearing as gaps with slight modifications by
eye to correctly reproduce the original alignment.
Finally, the aligned sequences from each gene or region
were concatenated using MacClade to generate a mitochondrial supermatrix consisting of 71 sequences,
including 18 sequences from the databases. The supermatrix was subjected to partitioned ML analysis using
RAxML ver. 7.2.1 with the best-scoring ML tree topology from the original dataset used as a backbone

used and the BS analysis performed in this analysis were
the same as those described in the above ML analyses.
Outgroups were also the same as those in the previous
ML and BI analyses.

CR haplotype phylogenies

DNA segments of 323 bp of the CR were newly
sequenced and aligned for the 528 C. auratus specimens
(485 from the Ryukyus, 43 from Taiwan). A total of 66
nucleotide positions (20.6% in 323 bp) varied, and these
variations defined 35 haplotypes. Of these haplotypes,
four were identical to previously reported haplotypes
[2,6], and the other 31 were newly detected (see Additional file 1 for accession numbers). In addition to the
35 haplotypes, 29 sequences previously obtained in our
laboratory [6], six sequences of C. auratus collected
from China [2,28], and one goldfish sequence [2] were
added, providing a total of 71 CR haplotypes for phylogenetic analyses.
The NJ tree based on the GTR + Γ + I model demonstrated that the 71 CR haplotypes were divided into
seven major clades (I -VII) based average GTR + Γ + I
distances of 0.034-0.098 (Figure 2; Additional file 2).
Both diploids and triploids were observed in all major
clades, with the exception of clade V, which was composed only of specimens of unknown ploidy. Furthermore, of the 71 haplotypes, 21 were shared by both
diploids and triploids in five major clades (see Figure 2
for details), although 14 and 11 haplotypes consisted of
only diploids and triploids, respectively.
ML and BI trees based on the CR data showed an essentially similar haplotype grouping as that of the NJ tree
(Figure 3a, only the ML tree is shown). However, the
ML and BI tree topologies differed somewhat from that

major cladogenic events in C. auratus, we used two different procedures. The first method uses the molecular
clock. Divergence times were calculated per clade
according to the evolutionary rate of 1.52% (pairwise
distance) per million year (My) estimated for cyt b
sequences of cyprinid fish by Zardoya and Doardio [39].
The second method uses the fossil record. The concatenated ML tree obtained was transformed into an ultrametric tree using a non-parametric rate smoothing
(NPRS) algorithm [40] in TreeEdit ver. 1.0 [41]. The
branches of the NPRS tree were scaled using a divergence time of approximately 0.5 million years ago (Mya)
for the C. cuvieri lineage based on the oldest fossil
record from the Sakawa clay stratum [42].

Results
Ploidy and sex of specimens from the Ryukyu
Archipelago

The sex of 338 of the 485 specimens collected from the
Ryukyus was determined successfully (267 females, 71
males). Ploidy of 436 specimens was also determined
(273 diploids, 150 triploids, and 13 tetraploids). Both sex
and ploidy of a total of 311 specimens were determined
(124 diploid females, 66 diploid males, and 121 triploid
females; Table 2). No triploid males were found, and all
13 tetraploids were too small to determine their sex.

of the NJ tree; clade III detected in the NJ tree was not
detected in the ML and BI trees.
ND4, ND5 and cyt b haplotype phylogenies

DNA samples were available for further sequencing for
64 out of 71 CR haplotypes. Complete ND4, ND5, and
cyt b genes (1381 bp, 1824 bp, and 1141 bp, respectively) were successfully sequenced for 53 of 64 specimens chosen from each of the 64 CR haplotypes. One
hundred and sixty three (ND4, 11.8%), 224 (ND5,
12.3%), and 146 (cyt b, 12.8%) variable sites without
insertions or deletions were found, which defined 37,
37, and 34 haplotypes, respectively, from each of the 53
sequences.
NJ, ML, and BI trees based on each of the three protein-coding regions showed the same seven major clades
as those detected in the CR-based NJ tree (Figure 3b-d,
only ML trees are shown). These seven clades were
grouped into two superclades: A (clades I- III) and B
(clades IV-VII). As expected from the results of CRbased NJ analysis, sharing of a haplotype by diploids and
triploids was observed in all three protein-coding
regions (three haplotypes for ND4, three for ND5, and
four for cyt b).
Because mtDNA comprises a single circular molecule,
it is preferable to use the 4669 bp concatenated
sequence of all four regions (CR, ND4, ND5, and cyt b)
to estimate the complete mtDNA phylogeny. NJ and
best-scoring ML and BI trees based on the concatenated
sequence corroborated the existence of the seven major
clades and the two superclades revealed in the analyses
described above, with higher BS values (100%) and BI
posterior probabilities (100%; Figure 4, only the ML tree
is shown). These seven major clades were separated by
average GTR + Γ + I distances of 0.019-0.103 (Additional file 3).
Supermatrix analysis

The results of supermatrix analysis performed using the
best-scoring ML tree topology as a backbone constraint
are shown in Figure 5. All newly downloaded sequences
of C. auratus from around the world were nested in
either of the seven major clades detected in our analyses; these sequences did not form a new major clade.
Carassius carassius was placed as a sister group of the
C. auratus-complex.
Distribution pattern analysis of CR haplotypes

To clarify the relationships between the phylogenetic
and geographical structures of C. auratus populations,
we analysed the distribution pattern of haplotypes
within each of the seven major clades. For this analysis,
we focused on CR haplotypes because these contained
the greatest number of specimens (528 + 357 = 885)
and examined their geographical distribution in seven
regional areas: Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, the Ryukyus,
Russia, Taiwan, and China, defined based on relative

Page 8 of 18

isolation. As a result, in many major clades the distribution of the haplotypes was restricted to specific area(s)
(Figure 5). In particular, haplotypes of clades I, IV, and
V were found only in Honshu, the Ryukyus, and the
continental region including Russia and China, respectively. Similarly, haplotypes in clades II, III, and VI were
distributed mainly in Kyushu, Honshu + Shikoku, and
Taiwan, respectively, although some haplotypes of the
three clades were found in the Ryukyus (i.e., outside of
their main distribution areas). Although haplotypes in
clade VII were distributed over a wide geographical
range, more than half (7/12) the haplotypes observed in
China (CR-56, 58, 59, 62, and 69 - 71) belonged to this
clade.
Note that most haplotypes found outside of their main
distribution areas were observed in distinctive water systems (i.e., systems with artificial reservoir(s)). For example, three haplotypes (CR-49, 53, and 54) in clade VI
that are typical of Taiwan (see Discussion) were found
in 5 of the 38 water systems sampled in the Ryukyus,
and 4 of these systems have artificial reservoirs (Figure
6). In addition, seven haplotypes (CR-55, 57, 58, 60, 61,
63, and 64) in clade VII that seemed to be indigenous
to China (see Discussion) were observed in Honshu
(from 1 of 11 water systems), Shikoku (1/2), Kyushu (1/
3), the Ryukyus (14/38), and Taiwan (2/2). Many of
these water systems inhabited by clade VII haplotypes
were also distinctive (1 in Honshu, 12 in the Ryukyus,
and 2 in fish markets in Taiwan); the one in Honshu
was Lake Kasumigaura, which is well known for the surfeit of artificially introduced alien fish. In addition, the
12 water systems of the Ryukyus have artificial reservoirs (Figure 6).
Divergence time estimation

Based on a cyt b calibration using the molecular clock
value of 1.52%/My, divergence time between superclades
A and B was estimated to be about 4.0 Mya and
between the seven major clades about 1.0-1.9 Mya
(Table 4). When we applied the divergence time of
approximately 0.5 Mya for the C. cuvieri lineage to the
NPRS ultrametric tree based on the best ML tree
derived from the concatenated sequence data set, the
divergence time between superclades A and B was estimated to be about 0.4 Mya (Table 4). The divergence
time among the seven major clades within superclades
A and B was around 0.2 Mya, ranging from only 0.17 to
0.21 Mya.

addition to the CR, the latter of which has been used in
previous phylogenetic analyses of these fish [e.g., [4-6].
NJ, ML, and BI analyses based on the concatenated
sequence (4669 bp) all produced essentially the same
tree topology. Most nodes were supported by high NJ
and ML BS values and BI posterior probabilities. Considering the robust tree topology obtained from all analyses, we considered these mtDNA trees to adequately
reflect the phylogeny of East Asian C. auratus.
CR tree topologies differed from that of the concatenated tree in that the two superclades (A and B) were
not well separated; this discrepancy might have been
caused by a genetic ceiling, probably due to saturation,
as in the Chaetodontidae and Plecoglossus altivelis
[25,26]. In addition, whereas the first third of the CR
was more variable than the three protein-coding genes
(20.6% vs. 11.8%, 12.3%, and 12.8%, respectively), the
total number of variable sites was considerably smaller
in the former than in the latter genes (66 vs. 163, 224,
and 146, respectively). It seems that the first third of the
CR was effective in detecting each lineage in our NJ
analysis but was less effective in resolving branching
order. Longer sequences of protein-coding gene(s) must
be used for an accurate analysis of C. auratus phylogeny, although the first third of the CR is effective and
useful for identifying mtDNA haplotypes.
Evolutionary relationships of East Asian C. auratus

The resultant mtDNA tree obtained from the 4669 bp
concatenated sequence has important implications for
the evolutionary relationships of East Asian C. auratus
(Figure 4). One important implication is the existence of
two old superclades with high regional specificity.
Superclade A consists of clades I-III, which are distributed mainly in the Japanese main islands, and superclade
B consists of clades IV-VII, which are distributed in various regions in and around the Eurasian continent.
Divergence time estimation between superclades A and

B using the NPRS tree calibrated with the fossil record
of C. cuvieri (0.4 Mya) and cyt b calibration using the
molecular clock value of 1.52% per My (4.0 Mya) suggests that the two superclades evolved independently for
a considerable period of time in the Japanese main
islands and the Eurasian continent, respectively (Table
4). Difference in divergence times estimated by both
procedures may be partially explained by the fact that
the fossil-based divergence time is the minimum estimation. The Japanese main islands are known to have been
inhabited by old lineages of various freshwater fishes [e.
g.,[15-17]. Superclade A of C. auratus represents one
such example of old lineages that is harbored in this
island region.
Another important implication is the existence of
seven clades: three clades (I -III) within superclade A
and four clades (IV-VII) within superclade B. The seven
clades diverged greatly from one another, and their origins were estimated to be old (0.2 Mya by the fossilbased method and 1.0-1.9 Mya by molecular clock
method; Table 4). These clades showed rather high
regional specificities (Figure 6). Such high regional specificities and ancient origins suggest that each of the
seven clades represents the natural population of each
region. Considering the possibilities of artificial introduction of C. auratus noted below, we concluded that
C. auratus with mtDNA of each of the clade I-VII haplotypes represents the natural population of Honshu (I),
Kyushu (II), Honshu + Shikoku (III), the Ryukyus (IV),
Russia + China (V), Taiwan (VI), and China (VII),
respectively.
Derivation of regional populations

The results of the present study indicate the existence of
seven regional endemic populations distributed in Honshu, Kyushu, Honshu + Shikoku, the Ryukyus, Russia +
China, Taiwan, and China. Some individuals belonging
to clades II, III, VI, and VII, however, were collected

Takada et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/7

from outside the regions specific to these lineages.
These individuals could be regarded as offspring of artificially introduced C. auratus for the following reasons:
(i) the occurrence of such individuals was mostly sporadic; (ii) despite the ancient origin of the lineages and
their geographic isolation, some individuals shared the
same haplotype (CR-11, 49, and 54) with fish from
inside their original region; and (iii) in the Ryukyus, 128
of 134 (95%) individuals with haplotypes specific to Taiwan and China were collected from water systems with
artificial reservoir(s) where freshwater fishes tend to be
released. Assuming that the individuals collected from
outside of the region specific to the lineages were
derived from artificial introduction, five introduction
routes can be identified: from the Eurasian continent to
the Japanese main islands (route 1); from the Eurasian
continent to the Ryukyus (route 2); from the Eurasian
continent to Taiwan (route 3); from the Japanese main
islands to the Ryukyus (route 4); and from Taiwan to
the Ryukyus (route 5). Four of the five routes (routes 1,
3, 4, and 5) are supported by the presence of records for
past introductions of freshwater fish [43-45].
A biogeographic perspective of Eurasian C. auratus

In the present study, the phylogenetic picture of C. auratus distributed in the Eurasian continent was obtained
by supertmatrix analysis using the best-scoring ML tree
topology as a backbone constraint. This analysis is very
useful for estimating phylogenetic relationships among
specimens by adding any portion of the DNA sequences
used in the analysis generating the backbone constraint
with a reliable phylogenetic tree topology. Based on the
results of the analysis, our mtDNA tree was judged to
be a good reflection of the overall framework of the
phylogenetic entity for the Carassius fishes around the
world because all of the newly downloaded sequences
collected from various geographical regions were
included in either of the seven major clades detected in
our phylogenetic analyses and no other new major lineage was detected (Figure 5, see also Methods). Our sampling in East Asian regions may sufficiently cover most
lineages of C. auratus.
The present supermatrix analysis provided important
insights into the origin of European C. auratus. The
major haplotypes observed in Europe were those of
clade V. Although a haplotype observed in France might
be derived from artificial introduction in that this haplotype was shared by specimens collected from Russia,
China, and Kazakhstan (haplotype #10 of the supermatrix tree; Figure 5), those observed in the Czech Republic are considered to be native to Europe because these
cyt b sequences form a monophyletic lineage (Figure 5),
with an estimated divergence time of 0.2 Mya (0.004 in
P distance) based on cyt b calibration. Clade V is major
in Eastern Eurasia as well, indicating that this clade

Page 14 of 18

must have an extensive distribution on the Eurasian
continent.
All haplotypes other than those of clade V in European C. auratus were nested in Japanese native
lineages (clades I and II). These clade I and II haplotypes were found only from the Czech Republic and
Greece on the Eurasian continent, whereas clade I and
II haplotypes were predominant in the Japanese main
islands (Figure 7). This distributional disjunction leads
to the hypothesis that European fish with these haplotypes originated via artificial introduction(s) from Japan.
Artificial introduction of Carassius fishes has been a
problem in the European region [46-50], and release of
ornamental goldfish into natural waters is considered to
be one of the primary causes of dispersion of non-native
C. auratus. However, European C. auratus included in
the present study may not have been derived from the
release of ornamental goldfish because the goldfish is
clearly a member of the Chinese C. auratus (clade VII)
and has diverged greatly from specimens of clade I, II,
and V haplotypes (Figures 2 and 6, and also see
Komiyama et al. [2]). Much more sequence data for C.
auratus collected throughout Eurasia is needed for more
detailed phylogenetic and evolutionary pictures of the C.
auratus-complex.
Phylogeny of triploid C. auratus

Our study also has significant implications for the phylogenetic entity of triploid C. auratus. All triploids
examined in the present study were female, which is
consistent with the idea that triploids reproduce gynogenetically [51-53]. Gynogenetic polyploid lineages in
fish generally are considered to have arisen by hybridisation between two related bisexual species, and these
polyploid lineages usually can be traced to a single or a
few maternal founders [14]. In fact, most known gynogenetic polyploid fish are confirmed to have originated
via hybridisation [54]. For triploid C. auratus, some
authors have considered the possibility of a hybrid origin, although paternal species were unknown [55,56]. In
the present study, however, most triploid C. auratus
were sympatric with diploids; they shared the same haplotype with sympatric diploids more frequently than
with allopatric triploids (Figure 2). In addition, triploids
were not monophyletic, and no substantial genetic
separation between triploids and diploids was observed.
These results strongly imply multiple origins of triploid
C. auratus, as suggested previously [4,56]. Our results
can be explained if triploids sometimes arise or have
arisen recently from sympatric diploids and vice versa.
Such interconversion of diploid and triploid forms
may be very rare in fish, and only one example is
known for cyprinids: the Leuciscus alburnoides complex.
In this complex, ploidy forms differ from each other in
genome constitution, and ploidy interconversion occurs

through hybridogenesis [57,58]. Whether similar
mechanisms also exist in C. auratus is not clear. Our
preliminary analysis of the nuclear genome of C. auratus suggested that no characteristic exists that distinguishes triploids from diploids [6], whereas other studies
have suggested the existence of markers mostly specific
to triploids [56,59,60]. Comprehensive investigation of
nuclear and mitochondrial genomes should be conducted to clarify the origin of triploids and the process
and mechanisms of possible ploidy interconversion in C.
auratus.
Conservation of endemic lineages of Japanese
Archipelago

As discussed above, at least seven lineages of C. auratus
are indigenous to various regions of East Asia. The
populations of the four endemic lineages (Honshu,
Kyushu, Honshu + Shikoku, and the Ryukyus) of the
Japanese Archipelago can be regarded as evolutionarily
significant units (ESU; [61]) due to their high phylogenetic independence and evolutionary distinctiveness.

Therefore, conservation of these lineages is necessary.
Moreover, note that distribution areas and population
sizes of the Ryukyuan C. auratus lineage in particular
are decreasing rapidly, and some island populations are
becoming endangered [62]. These reductions appear to
be caused mainly by habitat degradation due to simplification of stream morphology through development. To
conserve C. auratus populations in the Ryukyus, the
main stream habitats must be preserved.
Artificial introduction of non-native C. auratus may
cause another problem: genetic disturbance of native
populations. Carassius fishes have been artificially introduced both intentionally and unintentionally in several
ways [46-50]. In Japan, many C. auratus have been
imported alive to the Ryukyus from Taiwan for food (O.
Kuniyoshi, pers. comm.). In addition, as suggested by
Ohara [63], the possibility of accidental introduction of
C. auratus exists during seed release of aquacultured
fish, such as the Japanese crucian carp, C. cuvieri. Once
C. auratus is introduced into natural waters, either

Takada et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/7

intentionally or unintentionally, genetic disturbance of
endemic populations may occur immediately by hybridisation between indigenous and introduced individuals.
Careless transplantation of C. auratus should be prevented to conserve the genetic uniqueness of the endemic populations.

Conclusions
Phylogenetic analyses based on large data sets of mitochondrial gene sequences (4669 bp) obtained from the
East Asian Carassius auratus-complex revealed the existence of two superlineages, one distributed mainly in
the Japanese main islands and the other in various
regions in and around the Eurasian continent. The two
superlineages include seven old (0.2 Mya) lineages endemic to different regions, although some have been
affected by artificial introduction of C. auratus from
other regions. The present analyses provided an overall
phylogenetic framework for C. auratus that can be used
in to estimate the phylogenetic relationships of C. auratus on the Eurasian continent. Triploids of C. auratus
did not form a monophyletic lineage but instead clustered mostly with sympatric diploids, indicating that
they are not composed of a single independent lineage.
The ancient origins and evolutionary uniqueness of
these lineages warrant their conservation.
