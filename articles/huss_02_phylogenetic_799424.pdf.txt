Abstract
Background: Little is known about phytoplankton communities inhabiting low pH environments
such as volcanic and geothermal sites or acidic waters. Only specialised organisms are able to
tolerate such extreme conditions. There is, thus, low species diversity. We have characterised the
previously isolated acid tolerant Chlorella-like microalgae Viridiella fridericiana and Chlorella
protothecoides var. acidicola by microscopical and biomolecular methods in order to assess their
phylogenetic relationships.
Results: Both isolates belong to the trebouxiophycean lineage of chlorophytes. 18S and ITS1
sequence data clearly confirm that Viridiella fridericiana constitutes a new genus apart from the
morphologically similar and likewise acid tolerant microalga Chlorella saccharophila. Chlorella
protothecoides var. acidicola on the other hand is not a variety of Chlorella protothecoides but falls
within a heterogeneous cluster consisting of Nannochloris, "Chlorella" spec. Yanaqocha, and Koliella,
and is most closely related to algae which were also isolated from extreme environments.
Conclusions: The distribution of acid tolerant strains in the 18S rRNA tree shows that acquisition
of acid tolerance was unlikely a monophyletic event in green microalgae. We propose that different
strains have independently adapted to extreme environments. Some of them have spread
worldwide and were able to colonise other extreme habitats. Considering the problems of
successfully isolating acid tolerant strains, acidic soils could represent an unsuspected source of
biological diversity with high potential for biotechnological utilisations.

Background
Very low pH environments can be found in volcanic and
geothermal sites of Italy. They are generated by either sulphur springs emitting a continuous outflow of water at
temperatures higher than 80°C, or fumaroles, which are

mostly areas of small bubblers and steam vents. The in situ
oxidation of H2S arising from the outlets of these geothermal systems causes the production of large amounts of
H2SO4 and, in turn, low pH on rocks and soil surrounding the offspring. Generally, the pH values remain below

2.5 for 10–25 square meters around the outflow of H2S.
Temperature, on the other hand, declines from 60°C to
25–30°C within a few meters apart from the source of volcanic activity [1].
The distribution of algal flora on these soils is strictly dependent on the above two parameters. In the close vicinity
of hot springs and fumaroles, soil temperature and pH are
almost constant at 40°C and 1.5, respectively, thus enabling the exclusive presence of three thermoacidophilic
red microalgae, Cyanidium caldarium, Galdieria sulphuraria
and Cyanidioschyzon merolae[2,3]. At increasing distances,
pH and temperature may dramatically change, also as a
consequence of the season and rainfalls. At temperatures
below 30°C and pH values between 1.8 and 2.5, coccoid
green algae such as Chlorella and related genera represent
a major component of algal populations [4].
The occurrence of Chlorella in low pH environments
seems to be restriced to acidic soils, whereas in acidic waters it has been rarely recorded [5]. Here, the most widespread species belong to different diatom genera and to
several Chlamydomonas, Ochromonas and Euglena species
[6,7]. On the basis of a combination of morphological, biochemical and eco-physiological features [8], the Chlorella-like strains so far isolated from the acidic microsites
have been attributed to three taxa; two of these, Viridiella
fridericiana and C. protothecoides var. acidicola seem to be
endemic to acidic soils.
V. fridericiana is a monospecific genus erected on the basis
of the absence of a pyrenoid in the chloroplast and of sporopollenin in the cell wall [9]. It does not produce secondary carotenoids, and shows a pH limit for growth below
pH 1.0 [10]. On the other hand, our knowledge on C. protothecoides var. acidicola is scanty; it has been only preliminarily investigated by light microscopy (LM), whereas
neither Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) nor
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) studies have been
carried out. C. protothecoides var. acidicola seems to be morphologically identical to Auxenochlorella (=Chlorella) protothecoides; the only diacritical character for separating this
variety is a pH limit for growth at 2.0 compared to 3.5–4.0
for A. protothecoides[11]. The third taxon is represented by
"C." saccharophila, a species which has been recently excluded together with "C." protothecoides from the genus
Chlorella[12], and which is well known as the lowest pHresistant "Chlorella" species [13]. Although the type strain,
SAG 211-9a, and other strains of "C." saccharophila available from Culture Collections were isolated from non-acidic environments such as tree sap, they show the same
morphological features and the same growth limits of pH,
salinity and temperature as found in our isolates from
acidic soils (unpublished results).

The main goal of this paper is to assess the phylogenetic
relationships of our acid tolerant isolates with members
of the genus Chlorella sensu lato, and to ascertain if the colonisation of acidic soils of geothermal environments is a
monophyletic event. Moreover, molecular data could provide evidence to validate the establishment of V. fridericiana and C. protothecoides var. acidicola. To investigate these
aspects, 18S rRNA sequences of authentic strains of V.
fridericiana and C. protothecoides var. acidicola were determined. 18S sequences are routinely used to assess the phylogenetic position of coccoid green algae and an
increasing body of sequences is becoming available [14–
16]. The first attempt to use 18S sequences to infer phylogenetic relationships within Chlorella dates back to the beginning of the last decade [17], whereas a comprehensive
data set of 18S rRNA sequences of Chlorella sensu lato has
recently been presented, leading to a systematisation of
the taxonomy of this genus [12].
When more than one isolate from low pH soils was available, as in the case of "C." saccharophila and V. fridericiana,
the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) was also sequenced to reveal molecular differences within a population that have not been observed with usual
morphological and biochemical methods. Data from ITS1
sequences have been a valuable guide to identify different
isolates of Volvocacean species [18], and also within Chlorella, ITS1 comparisons became a useful tool to assign
strains at the species level, although not sufficient to resolve phylogenetic relationships among species [19].
Finally, in the case of C. protothecoides var. acidicola, the
need for a combined analysis of molecular and cytological
parameters prompted us to investigate the morphology
and ultrastructure of this strain by LM, TEM and SEM.

Results
Viridiella fridericiana and "Chlorella" saccharophila
Molecular and phylogenetic studies
ITS1 lengths were 289 and 261 bp for "C." saccharophila
SAG 211-9a and V. fridericiana 237, respectively, and the
GC content ranged from 61 mol% for the former species
to 59 mol% for the latter. We found no sequence divergence of ITS1 among the strains of "C." saccharophila isolated from acidic soils and the authentic strain of the
species, as well as among those belonging to V. fridericiana. On the other hand, the identity of ITS1 sequences
(Clustal W alignment) between "C." saccharophila and V.
fridericiana was only 35,7%. This indicates that the two
taxa are clearly separated; a similar distance is found between the ITS sequences of "C." saccharophila and "C." protothecoides var. acidicola.

The 18S rRNA tree in Fig. 1 confirms that V. fridericiana
and "C." saccharophila are not closely related. Although

both algae belong to the same subgroup within the trebouxiophytes, a close relationship on the genus level is excluded. The long branch of Viridiella, and also of "C."
luteoviridis, hints to a higher mutation rate of their ribosomal RNA compared to most other algae included in Fig.
1. Limited taxon sampling as an alternative explanation
can be largely ruled out as we have included all available
trebouxiophycean and several chlorophycean 18S rRNA
gene sequences in a first search for related algae resulting
in the same long branch leading to V. fridericiana. For sake
of clarity, only those sequences which appeared significant for demonstrating the phylogenetic position of our
isolates within the trebouxiophytes, were included in Fig.
1. Moreover, the 18S rRNA gene of Viridiella, in addition
to base substitutions in variable regions, contains several
mutations at sites that are otherwise highly conserved in
most green algae, which is a typical character of fast evolving genes. It is well known that long branches may generate artificial tree topologies [20]. However, considering
the available data, it is obvious that V. fridericiana represents a distinct lineage justifying the establishment of a
new genus Viridiella by [9] also on a molecular basis. Watanabea reniformis (formerly designated as Chlorella saccharophila strain SAG 211-9b, but excluded from the genus
Chlorella[21]) was found to be most closely related in the
maximum likelihood analysis, but this relationship is not
significantly supported by either bootstrap analysis.
"Chlorella" protothecoides var. acidicola
Ecophysiological and biochemical characters
Table 1 summarises biochemical and ecophysiological
characters of "C." protothecoides var. acidicola compared
with those of "C." minutissima and Auxenochlorella protothecoides, two of the most closely related algae for which
these data are available. "C." protothecoides var. acidicola
shares numerous features with A. protothecoides, such as
the unability to grow on nitrate, the upper limit of temperature for growth, and the tolerance to high concentrations of NaCl. As far as the need for thiamine is
concerned, "C." protothecoides var. acidicola does not strictly require thiamine for growth, even though growth is
promoted by the presence of this vitamin.

Light microscopy
In exponentially grown cultures, "C." protothecoides var.
acidicola consists of single cells, spherical to oval, 4.5–6.7
µm in diameter, with a thin cell wall. No mucilage surrounds the cells which are filled with a single parietal
chloroplast, bright green, cup shaped, and without
pyrenoid. Colourless oily droplets may occur in the cytoplasm. The propagation mode is by autosporulation. Sporangia are 8–10 µm in diameter and contain 4 (rarely 8)
autospores, spherical to oval, 3–4 µm in diameter, with a
single cup shaped chloroplast, which are released through
rupture of the mother cell wall (Fig. 2a). Residues of sporangial cell walls are visible and keep the autospores together for a certain time (not shown).
Electron microscopy
SEM micrographs reveal a cell wall which is smooth or
covered by an irregular network of subtle ribs (Figs.
2b,2c). Smooth and "rough" cell walls were present in
samples of the same culture, and apparently, they can be
observed in cells of similar size. TEM micrographs show
that sporangia of "C." protothecoides var. acidicola may contain autospores of different size (Fig. 3a). The autospores
have a central nucleus and a single parietal chloroplast
lacking a pyrenoid, with some interthylacoidal starch
grains. A mitochondrion is also visible near the concave
side of the chloroplast. Moreover, TEM indicates that the
cell wall is composed of an inner granulo-fibrillar polysaccharide layer and an outer trilaminar (TL) layer (Fig. 3b).
As reported for Auxenochlorella protothecoides[22], the external surface of the TL-layer after fixation with glutaraldehyde-OsO4 is slightly undulated and the polysaccharide
layer is not clearly visible. After fixation with glutaraldehyde-OsO4-tannic acid, a film of electron dense material
external to the TL-layer is recognisable, probably due to a
precipitation of tannic acid; moreover, the inner polysaccharide layer becomes more evident.
Phylogenetic position
In spite of the various features shared between "C." protothecoides var. acidicola and A. protothecoides (see above),
molecular evidence suggests that both are not closely related. The phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1 places "C." protothecoides var. acidicola inside a cluster that contains two

Nannochloris strains as well as "Chlorella" spec. Yanaqocha
and Koliella spiculiformis. Our analyses show a weak tendency, although not significantly supported by bootstrap
values, to affiliate "C." protothecoides var. acidicola with the
latter two algae which are also known to colonize extreme
environments. "C." spec. Yanaqocha is a UV-B tolerant
alga isolated from the Andean lake Yanaqocha (3980 m
above sea level; [23]), and Koliella species, although
polyphyletic [24], have been isolated e.g. from the Himalayan Yala Glacier (5100–5700 m above sea level; [25])
and also from acidic waters [http://www.npsumava.cz/
gabreta/hejzlar.html]. Interestingly, a microalga isolated
from the German Lake Lugteich (Lusatia, Saxony) and
designated as "Chlorella" spec. Pi98/29 turned out to be
very closely related to "C." protothecoides var. acidicola with
just one difference in their 18S rRNA genes (Hepperle,
pers. commun.). Lake Lugteich is a highly eutrophic and
extremely acidic mining lake (pH 2.6) which was characterised with respect to its phytoplankton communities [7].

Discussion
The complete identity of ITS1 sequences of "Chlorella" saccharophila isolates from acidic soils with that of the authentic strain confirms the widespread distribution of this
species and its ability to occupy extreme environments.
Although it has been suggested that "C." saccharophila
could be a component of littoral microflora [26], this species is mainly a "luftalga", occurring on bark of trees and
bare rocks, and, less frequently, on soils of temperate regions [27]. However, this alga might be distributed worldwide: in 1982, a "C." saccharophila strain (labelled CCAP
211/57), isolated from Mt. Erebus soils, Antarctica, was
deposited by P. Broady in the Culture Collection of Algae
and Protozoa. There are no available molecular and cytological results confirming this attribution. Molecular studies have confirmed that "C." saccharophila does not belong
to the group of "true" Chlorella, and that it is distant from
"C." ellipsoidea[12] once considered a variety of "C." saccharophila[28,29]. Moreover, the erection of Watanabea
reniformis has recently been proposed [21], which in-

cludes strains of "C." saccharophila with a low sequence
identity with the authentic strain CCAP 211/9a, and a reduced tolerance to low pH values and high NaCl concentrations.
The taxonomy of Chlorellaceae sensu Komarek & Fott [27]
is largely based on chloroplast morphology, and at the generic level on the presence or absence of a pyrenoid. Recently, studies on 18S rRNA sequences of coccal green
algae belonging to Selenastraceae have demonstrated the
inconsistency of several "small" genera separated on the
basis of a single-character difference such as presence or
absence of a pyrenoid [16]. In the case of Viridiella, which
is morphologically separated from "C." saccharophila only
by the absence of a pyrenoid, the establishment of the genus seems to be well supported by molecular analyses
(Fig. 1).
On the other hand, the comparative approach attempted
to clarify the taxonomic position and the phylogenetic relationships of "C." protothecoides var. acidicola did not lead
to unequivocal conclusions. From a morphological point

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/2/13

of view, this organism showed a number of features similar to Auxenochlorella protothecoides ranging from shape
and dimension of cells, lack of pyrenoid and absence of
growth on nitrate. TEM observations, along with the confirmation of the absence of a pyrenoid, indicated the occurrence in the cell wall of a trilaminar layer, another
characteristic shared with A. protothecoides. In contrast, the
occurrence of autospores of different dimensions in the
same sporangium is a feature observed in other "Chlorella"
species such as "C." luteoviridis[30] and, most important,
the genus Auxenochlorella is defined primarily on the strict
need of thiamine for growth [22], which was not observed
in our strain. Analyses of 18S rRNA gene sequences rule
out a close relationship of "C." protothecoides var. acidicola
with A. protothecoides and indicate that our isolate is related, although weakly, to other algae apparently not related
from a morphological point of view (Fig. 1). "C". minutissima and Nannochloris are characterized by their small size
of about 2 µm [12], whereas Koliella is represented either
by two-celled filaments or by spindle shaped unicells, very
similar to Raphidonema[24]. The availability of increasing
information on phylogenetic relationships among coccoid green algae is evidencing the difficulties arising when
a traditional system of classification is compared with molecular data. In unicellular organisms lacking a sexual life
cycle, species and genera boundaries often remain uncertain, even after comprehensive data sets of morphological,
biochemical, ecophysiological and molecular features
have been collected, probably because limitations and the
way how to use this multimethod approach are not clear.
At the present time, with no consensual species concept in
organisms in which sexual phenomena are not existent,
more and more conflicting results are expected to be
found.
It is evident from the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1 that acid
tolerant strains such as V. fridericiana, "C." saccharophila,
and "C." protothecoides var. acidicola are distributed among
strains that are less tolerant or even sensitive to conditions
of high acidity or salinity such as "C." minutissima (Table
1). This indicates that acquisition of acid tolerance per se
in this group of algae is unlikely to be a monophyletic
event. Rather, different strains have apparently adapted to
the specific environmental conditions they were exposed
to. Once the resistance to such conditions was genetically
fixed, they might have been able to spread and colonise
other extreme environments eventually giving rise to
monophyletic "miniclusters" of extremotolerant taxa as
represented by "C." protothecoides var. acidicola, "C." spec.
Yanaqocha, and K. spiculiformis. An example for such a
spreading is demonstrated by the occurrence of "C." protothecoides var. acidicola in volcanic sites in Italy and of the
genetically closely related "Chlorella" spec. Pi98/29 isolated from an acidic mining lake in Germany (see Results). It
has to be kept in mind, however, that the loss of a charac-

teristic such as acid tolerance is at least as likely to occur as
its acquisition thus obscuring monophyletic events in
gene trees.
The number of algal species inhabiting low pH environments is generally considered to be very low [31]. Our results suggest that a comprehensive list of coccoid green
algae occurring in low pH habitats is far from complete.
Collecting algae from acidic soils is not simple, due to the
variations of pH, light intensity, and ion concentrations
which can remarkably change within few centimetres, allowing the establishment of different algal populations.
Moreover, the identification of coccoid green microalgae
through sampling and fixation can be misleading, because
morphological characters are often not sufficient for a correct taxonomic determination. On the other hand, isolation and establishment of pure cultures is frequently
unsuccessful. However, acidic soils could represent an unsuspected source of biological diversity, and the isolation
and characterisation of acid and salt tolerant strains could
open a promising avenue of research on their potential biotechnological utilisations.

Conclusions
The present study demonstrates that the taxonomic treatment proposed for Viridiella fridericiana seems to be well
supported by molecular data. On the other hand, our results indicate that "C." protothecoides var. acidicola can not
be incorporated into the genus Chlorella sensu stricto and
can not be regarded as a variety of Auxenochlorella protothecoides as previously assumed from morphological comparisons. We suggest that this taxon should be treated as a
distinct species to be included in a new genus. However,
this treatment also needs reconsideration of the taxonomic status of other closely related microalgae, namely "C."
spec. Yanaqocha and Koliella spiculiformis. Moreover, our
data show that acquisition of acid tolerance was unlikely
a monophyletic event in green microalgae. Several strains
of different genetical equipment have apparently independently adapted to acidic environments making them
interesting candidates for various biotechnological applications. Acidic soils of volcanic and geothermal sites from
which our strains have been isolated may provide an unsuspected source of biological diversity for such extremely
acid tolerant organisms.

Methods
Strains and culture conditions
The algal strains used in this study were: "Chlorella" saccharophila SAG 211-9a, 042 (Bagni di Repole, Calabria at pH
2.0), 045 (Mondragone, Campania, pH 2.5), 156 (Montefiore Conca, Emilia Romagna, pH 2.0); Viridiella fridericiana 035 (Bagni San Filippo, Tuscany, pH 2.5), 039 (Suio
Terme, Lazio, pH 2.5), 236 (Frattocchie, Lazio, pH 2.5),
237 (Mefite di Ansanto, Campania, pH 2.0); and Chlorella

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/2/13

protothecoides var. acidicola 124 (Pisciarelli, Campania, pH
2.0). The strains are from the algal collection of the University of Naples [32] except strain 211-9a which is from
the Sammlung für Algenkulturen in Göttingen, Germany.
All algae were grown in Erlenmayer flasks (1000 ml) containing 500 ml of modified Bold Basal Medium with 0.25
g/l (NH4 )2SO4 as a nitrogen source and a pH adjusted to
3.0 by adding H2SO4. The cultures were bubbled with air
and maintained in a temperature-controlled room at
25°C on a plexiglass shaking apparatus [28] under a photon irradiance of 150 µmol photons m -2 s-1 with continuous light provided by cool-light fluorescent lamps
(Philips TLD30w/55). Cell density of the algal cultures
was assessed at 550 nm with a colorimeter Bausch &
Lomb Spectronic 20.
Ecophysiological and biochemical tests on C. protothecoides var. acidicola
The synthesis of secondary carotenoids under nitrogen deficiency was carried out according to Kessler et al. [32]. All
tests were carried out in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of modified Allen medium [33] at pH 3.0, except in the different pH tests, at the same culture
conditions as specified above. For the salt tolerance tests,
the algae were grown at different concentrations of NaCl
(2,4,6, and 8%). For the tests dealing with pH limits for
growth, H2SO 4 was added at different concentrations in
modified Allen medium to obtain final pH values of 1.5,
2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0. During the experiments, the
pH value was daily monitored in each flask. For growth
tests on nitrate as sole nitrogen source, algal cultures, previously centrifuged (5000 rpm × 10 min) and washed
twice with nitrogen-free medium, were inoculated in Allen medium containing 3 mM NaNO3. In all experiments
a control with C. protothecoides var. acidicola containing
only modified BBM medium at pH 3.0 was also tested. After sterilisation by autoclaving, the flasks were inoculated
with several drops of enrichment cultures in exponential
growth phase to have a cell density of 0.003 units (corresponding to 100.000 cells/ml). Growth of each flask was
followed daily by measuring the cell density as described
above. Ecophysiological tests were carried out in triplicate
for each strain and were repeated three times. Specific
growth rates were calculated for each individual flask by
linear regression of logarithmic cell density data obtained
during the experiments. The results were evaluated on the
basis of the average of three tests and the relative standard
error was never higher than 5%.
Morphological observations
Algal samples of each Chlorella or Viridiella species were
observed with a Leitz Aristoplan microscope equipped
with Nomarski interference optics, and the number of endospores and the size of 100 cells of each strain were
measured with a micrometer eyepiece. The observations

were made at different stages of the life cycle, either on
cells in full exponential phase, or on cells in late stationary
phase of growth.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
C. protothecoides var. acidicola cultures in late exponential
growth phase were harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm
× 10 min) and fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 1%
formaldehyde, dehydrated in ethanol series, washed with
water and spread over supporting glass squares, dried to
the critical point and shadow-cast with gold. The preparation was scanned in a Cambridge 250 Mark 3.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The cells were fixed either with 3% glutaraldehyde + 2%
formaldehyde or in a mixture of 3% glutaraldehyde + 2%
formaldehyde + 0.75% tannic acid. Fixatives were dissolved in 0.05 M PIPES buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4°C. Algae were then harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm × 5
min), rinsed with distilled water for 30 min and suspended in 2% agar. Agar blocks were washed in 0.05 M Na-cacodilate buffer (pH 7.0) and resuspended in 1% osmium
tetroxide (aqueous solution) overnight at 4°C. Small
blocks of agar-suspended algae were dehydrated with an
ethanol series and embedded in Spurr's resin. Ultrathin
sections were cut with a diamond knife, sequentially
stained each 10 min with 2% uranyl acetate and 1.33% Pb
citrate, and observed with a Philips CM12 electron microscope at 50 kV.
Biomolecular studies
Cells of each Chlorella or Viridiella strain were harvested by
centrifugation (6000 rpm × 5 min) and total DNA was extracted from liquid cultures following the procedure described in Doyle & Doyle [34]. 18S rRNA genes and ITS1
regions were amplified by PCR. For 18S, PCR conditions
and sequencing primers were the same as previously described [12]; the ITS1 region was amplified using primers
annealing with the 3' region of the 18S rRNA (5'-GGAGAAGTCGTAACAAGGTTTCCG-3') and with the 5' region
of the 5.8S rRNA (5'-ATCCTGCAATTCACACCAAGTATCG-3'), respectively. PCR products were directly sequenced in an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Cetus, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.). The 18S rRNA gene
sequences of Chlorella protothecoides var. acidicola strain
124 and Viridiella fridericiana strain 237 were deposited in
the EMBL database under the accession numbers
AJ439399 and AJ439401, and the ITS1 sequences of
"Chlorella" saccharophila SAG 211-9a and Viridiella fridericiana 237 under the accession numbers AJ439400 and
AJ439402, respectively.
Phylogenetic analyses
For the analysis of ITS1 regions, sequences were reduced
to only ITS1 by comparing them with the 3' terminus of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/2/13

18S rRNA and of 5.8S rRNA of Chlorella species available
from the literature [19]. ITS1 sequences were aligned using Clustal W ver. 1.6 [35]. 18S rRNA sequences were
manually aligned on a MicroVAX computer with the sequence editor program distributed by G. Olsen [36]. External primer sequences and highly variable regions that
could not be aligned unambiguously were excluded from
the analyses resulting in a total of 1726 positions. Phylogenetic trees were inferred from the aligned sequence data
by the neighbor-joining (NJ), the maximum parsimony
(MP), and the maximum likelihood (ML) method. For all
methods, heuristic bootstrap analyses [37] with 1000 (NJ,
MP) or 100 replicates (ML) were conducted with the
PAUP program package 4.0b8a [38] on a Power Macintosh G3 computer. For the NJ analysis, the HKY85 correction was used to convert pairwise sequence similarities
into evolutionary distances, starting trees were obtained
via neighbor-joining, and the TBR branch-swapping algorithm was selected. In the MP analysis, starting trees were
obtained via random stepwise addition of taxa repeated
10 times, gaps were treated as "fifth base", and TBR was selected. In the ML bootstrap analysis, empirical base frequencies were used, the transition/transversion (ti/tv)
ratio was set to 2, a gamma distribution of 0.5 was assumed for variable sites, and addition of taxa was by
neighbor joining. In contrast, the tree topology shown in
Fig. 1 was obtained by a ML analysis with ti/tv, base frequencies, proportion of invariable sites and gamma shape
parameter estimated via ML, and with addition of taxa by
the "as-is" mode.
