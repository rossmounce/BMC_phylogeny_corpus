Abstract
Background: The obligate parasitic plant witchweed (Striga hermonthica) infects major cereal crops such as sorghum,
maize, and millet, and is the most devastating weed pest in Africa. An understanding of the nature of its parasitism
would contribute to the development of more sophisticated management methods. However, the molecular and
genomic resources currently available for the study of S. hermonthica are limited.
Results: We constructed a full-length enriched cDNA library of S. hermonthica, sequenced 37,710 clones from the
library, and obtained 67,814 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences. The ESTs were assembled into 17,317 unigenes
that included 10,319 contigs and 6,818 singletons. The S. hermonthica unigene dataset was subjected to a comparative
analysis with other plant genomes or ESTs. Approximately 80% of the unigenes have homologs in other
dicotyledonous plants including Arabidopsis, poplar, and grape. We found that 589 unigenes are conserved in the
hemiparasitic Triphysaria species but not in other plant species. These are good candidates for genes specifically
involved in plant parasitism. Furthermore, we found 1,445 putative simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in the S.
hermonthica unigene dataset. We tested 64 pairs of PCR primers flanking the SSRs to develop genetic markers for the
detection of polymorphisms. Most primer sets amplified polymorphicbands from individual plants collected at a single
location, indicating high genetic diversity in S. hermonthica. We selected 10 primer pairs to analyze S. hermonthica
harvested in the field from different host species and geographic locations. A clustering analysis suggests that genetic
distances are not correlated with host specificity.
Conclusions: Our data provide the first extensive set of molecular resources for studying S. hermonthica, and include
EST sequences, a comparative analysis with other plant genomes, and useful genetic markers. All the data are stored in
a web-based database and freely available. These resources will be useful for genome annotation, gene discovery,
functional analysis, molecular breeding, epidemiological studies, and studies of plant evolution.
Background
Striga hermonthica is an obligate root parasite belonging
to the family Orobanchaceae, and is a major constraint of
crop production in sub-Saharan Africa. S. hermonthica
infests economically important crops such as sorghum,
maize, millet, and upland rice, and the yield losses caused
by this species have been estimated to cost as much as
US$ 7 billion annually [1]. However, methods for controlling S. hermonthica are not well established. Despite its
agricultural importance, the molecular mechanisms con* Correspondence: ken.shirasu@psc.riken.jp

trolling the establishment of parasitism are poorly understood.
The S. hermonthica life cycle is unique and well adapted
to its parasitic lifestyle. The seeds need to be exposed to
germination stimulants exudated from the host roots,
such as strigolactones and ethylene; otherwise they can
remain dormant in the soil for several decades [2]. The
seeds are tiny and possess limited amounts of nutrients,
and this restricts their growth without a host connection.
When a potential host is recognized through the sensing
of strigolactones or other germination stimulants, the
seeds that are close to the host roots (within 5 mm) can
germinate. The germinated seedlings form haustoria,
which are round shaped organs specialized in host

Results and Discussion
Genome size of S. hermonthica

S. hermonthica is likely to be a diploid species with a
chromosome number of n = 19 [10]. First, we estimated
the genome size of S. hermonthica to gain information
about its genome contents. Leaves of S. hermonthica
plants parasitizing to rice were harvested and the DNA
contents were measured with a flow cytometer. Arabidopsis thaliana, whose genome size is 128 Mbp, was used
as a control. Five individual plants were used for the measurements with two or more replicates for each plant.
The genome size of S. hermonthica was estimated to be
1,801 Mbp (± 321 Mbp) (Fig. 1), which is approximately
14 times that of Arabidopsis, 4 times those of rice and
poplar, and 2 times that of sorghum.
Full-length enriched cDNA library construction

To construct a full-length enriched cDNA library containing highly variable sequences, total RNA was
extracted from various S. hermonthica tissues at various
developmental stages (Table 1). A full-length enriched
normalized cDNA library was constructed using a mixture of these RNAs as starting materials. To assess the
quality of the resulting library, the inserts from 90 randomly picked clones were amplified by PCR with primers
specific to the library vector, and the insert sizes were
estimated by agarose-gel electrophoresis (Table 2). The
average insert size was approximately 1.42 kb, which is
similar to the average insert size of the RIKEN Arabidopsis Full-Length (RAFL) cDNA clones (estimated at 1,445
bp) [11,12]. This average insert size was similar to that of
a poplar full-length cDNA library (Populus nigra, about
1.4 kb) [13], and slightly shorter than those from soybean
and wheat (approximately 1.5 kb) [12,14]. The longest

attachment and penetration [3]. The formation of haustoria also requires host-derived signal compounds. The
haustoria penetrate the host roots and finally connect
with the vasculature to rob the host plant of water and
nutrients. This dramatic developmental transition from
an autotrophic to a heterotrophic lifestyle occurs within
several days.
Intensive efforts in the scientific community, mainly in
the United States during the 1960s, lead to the identification of some germination stimulants. This was followed
by the development of a "suicidal germination" strategy to
eradicate Striga weeds [4]. By this strategy, a germination
stimulant (in this case ethylene) is mixed in the soil to
trigger germination in the absence of the hosts. This
approach was used successfully to eradicate Striga asiatica infestations in North Carolina. Although suicidal germination was effective for controlling S. asiatica, this
approach was not applicable for African farmers due to
the high cost of the strategy and the much larger scale of
infestation.
Whole genome sequencing is a valuable approach to
understanding an organism. The genome sequences of
growing numbers of model and crop plant species have
been published in recent years, providing new insights in
plant biology. The development of new generation
sequencing technologies has dramatically accelerated the
speed of large-scale sequencing. However, the de novo
sequencing of the whole genome of a non-model plant is
still a challenging and laborious task [5]. Expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) are a less expensive alternative for
gaining information about the expressed genes of an
organism [6]. In particular, the ESTs from a full-length
enriched cDNA library provide the complete sequences
of functional proteins [7].
This study aims to provide genome scale molecular
resources for understanding the parasitic processes of the
obligate parasite, S. hermonthica. We constructed a fulllength enriched cDNA library from S. hermonthica and
generated a large-scale EST dataset by reading the
sequences of individual clones from both ends. The only
other genus from the family Orobanchaceae with publically available EST data is Triphysaria [8]. Triphysaria
spp. are facultative hemiparasites, which are able to complete their life cycles without hosts. The comparison of
our S. hermonthica EST dataset with those of Triphysaria
and other non-parasitic plantspecies enabled us to identify the potentially parasite specific genes. Furthermore,
our results provide the tools to analyze genetic diversity
within S. hermonthica. We found 1,445 putative simple
sequence repeats (SSRs) that could be useful as markers.
We amplified the genomic regions flanking some of these
SSRs from S. hermonthica individuals that were collected
in different fields in Africa. The results revealed high
sequence divergence in the S. hermonthica genomes. All

Axenically grown plants

Next, we sequenced both the 5'- and 3'-ends of 37,710
clones from the S. hermonthica full-length enriched
cDNA library. The sequence chromatograms were analyzed using the EST2uni package [15], which is an automated analysis tool for the clean-up, clustering, and
annotation of EST sequences. Among the 75,330 raw
sequence reads, we found that 67,814 were of good quality and were deposited in the DNA Databank of Japan
[DDBJ: FS438984-FS506797]. The sequences are clustered into 17,137 non-redundant unigenes (10,319 contigs and 6,818 singletons) (Table 3). The average GC
content among the unigene sequences is 44.5%. The
lengths of the unigenes are distributed between 82 and
3,949 bp, and most of them (11,546 unigenes) have
sequence lengths between 601 and 900 bp (Additional file
1), with an average of 810.3 bp. Most (84%) of the unigenes are comprised of fewer than 6 ESTs (Additional file
1), suggesting that the redundancy rate is relatively low in
this normalized library.

Grown axenically for 1 month

insert was estimated at more than 3 kb, suggesting that
the library contains relatively long cDNAs.
To assess the proportion of the library containing fulllength cDNA clones, we randomly picked 90 clones and
sequenced them from both the 5' and 3' ends. These DNA
sequences were analyzed against the Arabidopsis genome
database using the blastx program. Of the 90 clones, 79
contained sequences similar to those of Arabidopsis
genes (e_value < e-10), while the insert sequences of the
other 11 clones did not show any similarity. The 5'- and
3'- sequences of the 79 clones were aligned with the
homologous Arabidopsis cDNAs. The 5'-sequences of 62
clones contained ATG start codons at similar positions to
those in the corresponding Arabidopsis homologs, and 59
possessed stop codons at the equivalent positions. Therefore, we estimated that approximately 75% of the clones
in the S. hermonthica library encode full-length cDNAs.
Among the 59 sequenced full-length clones, the average
lengths of the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs)
were 127 bp and 203 bp, respectively, and the longest 5'and 3' -UTRs were 486 bp and 480 bp, respectively.

Functional annotation of the unigene sequences

For the functional annotation of the 17,137 unigene
sequences, we carried out a blastx analysis against the
UniRef90 database [16,17]. About 79% of the S. hermonthica unigenes were annotated as homologs of
known proteins. For further functional annotations of the
structural domains, the Pfam database [18] was searched
using the HMMER program (ver. 2.3.2, [19,20]), and 31%
(5367) of the unigenes contained Pfam hits. Then the S.
hermonthica unigenes were classified into Gene ontology
(GO) groups based on their similarities with the corresponding Arabidopsis genes (Fig. 2). In the classification
of genes according to their cellular components, we
found that 16% of the unigenes encode putative membrane proteins and 10% encode putative plastid proteins.
In the classification of molecular functions, 12% were
assigned to catalytic activity. These percentages are similar to those in Arabidopsis [21], indicating that there was

The S. hermonthica unigenes were compared with genes
in other plant genomes, including A. thaliana, poplar
(Populus trichocarpa), grape (Vitis vinifera), soybean
(Glycine max), rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum
bicolor), a moss (Physcomitrella patens), and an algae
(Chlamydomonas reindardtii) [22-26]. Seventy-seven to
seventy-nine percent of the S. hermonthica unigenes
showed similarities with genes from other dicotyledonous plants (Arabidopsis, grape, soybean, and poplar), as
detected by blastx (e_value < e-10). Approximately 75% of
the unigenes have homologs in monocotyledonous plants
(rice and sorghum), and approximately 65% and 38%
showed blastx hits in the P. patens and C. reindardtii
databases, respectively. These lower percentages of blast
hits are consistent with the greater evolutionary distances
from those organisms.
We plotted the percentages of S. hermonthica unigenes
against levels of amino acid sequence identity with
homologs in the other plant genomes (Fig. 3). Larger percentages of S. hermonthica unigenes showed higher levels

Figure 3 Cumulative count curves of identity between S. hermonthica unigenes and those from other plant species. All the sequenced S. hermonthica unigenes were used in blastx or tblastx
searches against the peptide databases of the indicated plant species.
The curves represent the percentages of S. hermonthica unigenes that
showed higher levels of identity than the values on the x-axis.

numbers roughly reflect the evolutionary distances
between S. hermonthica and these species.
Large scale EST sequence datasets have previously
been reported for Triphysaria versicolor [8] and Triphysaria pusilla [27], which are hemiparasitic plants belonging to the Orobanchaceae. The assembled EST sequences
are available at the plantGDB web site [28]. Althoughthe
genus Triphysaria is closely related taxonomically to S.
hermonthica, only 74% of the S. hermonthica unigenes
showed similarity to Triphysaria sequences (including
both T. pusilla and T. versicolor), when analyzed with the
tblastx program (Table 4). This is significantly lower than
percentages of similarity found with the other dicotyledonous plants, but this is likely due to the lack of saturation of the Triphysaria EST datasets.
The conservation of the genes between S. hermonthica
and Arabidopsis, grape, poplar, or Triphysaria spp. is
shown in a Venn diagram (Fig. 4). Among the 17,137 unigenes, 11,711 (68%) are conserved among all five groups.
Only 19, 36, and 58 of the S. hermonthica unigenes are
conserved specifically in Arabidopsis, grape, and poplar,
respectively. Interestingly, we found that 662 (3.9%) of the
S. hermonthica unigenes are conserved in Triphysaria
spp. but not in Arabidopsis, grape, or poplar.
Of these 662 sequences, 73 show similarities to
sequences in other databases such as rice, sorghum, soybean, Physcomitrella, UniRef90 or nr (the non-redundant
peptide database from NCBI). We found no other
homologs for the remaining 589 unigenes (Additional file
2). Since T. pusilla and T. versicolor are hemiparasitic
plants, these 589 might include genes specific to parasitic

S. hermonthica is an obligate outcrossing plant with high
levels of morphological and genetic variation [29]. The
EST2uni program detected 9,299 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the S. hermonthica
unigenes. To exclude the misidentification of sequencing
errors as SNPs, only polymorphisms confirmed by at
least 2 independent sequences were counted, although
there is still the possibility that those polymorphisms
occurred during cDNA synthesis. The average frequency
of SNPs in the unigene sequences is 0.67%, or approximately 1 SNP per 1.5 kbp. Although these SNPs will need
to be confirmed, these data will be useful for developing
EST-SNP markers for S. hermonthica [30].
We found 1,445 di-, tri- or tetra-nucleotide microsatellites (or SSRs) among the S. hermonthica unigenes. The
most frequent of these are the tri-nucleotide repeats
(Additional file 3), which is in agreement with previous
studies of other plant species [31-33]. The most frequent
individual microsatellite repeat is AG (including TC, GA,
and TC) (283, 19.6%) and the second most frequent is AC
(including TG, CA, and GT) (218, 15.1%). The most frequent tri-nucleotide repeat is ATC (including TCA and
CAT) (157, 11.0%) (Additional file 4).
The EST-SSR sequences are good candidates for
genetic markers, which can be used for molecular diagnosis, for biotyping weeds, and for investigating the
genetic diversity and population structures of S. hermonthica. To investigate whether the SSRs that we identified can be used as such markers, we designed primers
using sequences flanking the putative SSRs and looked
for polymorphisms by PCR. First, we pooled DNA samples extracted from the leaves of several plants in the
same field and used the DNA pools as PCR templates. Of
the 64 primer sets tested, 44 successfully amplified DNA
bands. However, 26 primer sets (59%) produced smears
or multiple bands that were not countable and only 18
primer pairs (41%) amplified clear separate bands (Additional file 5). The smeared bands may indicate heterozygosity and genetic diversity among the individual plants
harvested from the same field. Therefore, we tested the
individual plants for polymorphisms. Several markers
that showed smear patterns from the pooled DNA tem-

plates actually amplified clear polymorphic bands from
individual plants in the same population (Additional file
6). These data verify that S. hermonthica is a highly adaptable weed that has maintained a high degree of genetic
variation and plasticity, to survive in various ecosystems
[34].
Genetic distances among S. hermonthica populations with
different hosts

Although individual S. hermonthica plants possess highly
diversified genomes, 18 of the primer sets we tested
showed countable band patterns when using pooled DNA
templates. Using those primer sets, we investigated the

Figure 4 Homologous gene groups between S. hermonthica and
four other plant species. The numbers of S. hermonthica unigenes

relationships between different S. hermonthica populations from 6 fields growing sorghum, maize, or pearl millet in various locations in Sudan or Kenya [35]. Of the 18
primer sets, 10 showed clear polymorphisms for different
S. hermonthica populations (Table 5, Additional file 5).
The analysis of PCR products was carried out using MultiNa® (Shimadzu, Japan), a microchip electrophoresis system that permits the separation of small fragments and
that can detect 5 bp differences. The average polymorphism information content (PIC) was 0.463, which confirms that the SSR markers used in this study were highly
informative The lowest PIC value was 0.305 for SSR57,
and the highest was 0.545 for SSR26 (Table 5). The analyzed loci included 3 di-, 3 tri-, and 4 tetra-nucleotide
repeats. A total of 27 alleles were detected, with an average number of alleles per locus of 2.7. The genetic diversity among the six populations was revealed by the gene
diversity values, which ranged from 0.375 to 0.625, with
an average of 0.549. These results suggest a high level of
diversity among the surveyed populations, as was
expected for this obligate outcrossing plant [36-38].
We also looked for correlations between host species
and S. hermonthica biotypes, using the Unweighted Pair
Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) clustering analysis. The populations from El Obeid (host: sorghum), Dirweesh (host: sorghum), and Kenya (host:
maize) clustered in one group, while the population from
Elkaraiba (host: sorghum) was in a distant branch of the
same group. Those from Tandalti (host: pearl millet) and
Agadi (host: maize) formed another cluster (Fig. 5). Thus,
we did not detect any correlations between genetic distance and host specificity in this study. This result is consistent with previous epidemiological reports [35,38-40].
In summary, our results suggest that the SSRs found in
our study could be useful tools for further investigations
of genetic diversity in S. hermonthica.

Web-based database

The results of the sequencing and analysis of the S. hermonthica ESTs are freely available online from our webbased database [9]. The web interface was based on the
original EST2uni web site [15]. The database contains
features for complex query searches and a blast search. A
page for each unigene consists of its sequence, contig
images, results of blast similarity searches, lists of
detected SSRs and SNPs, and GO categorizations. In
addition, the homologs of each unigene are linked to outside databases such as The Arabidopsis Information
Resource (TAIR) [41]. This web-based database will be a
powerful tool for the detailed analysis of S. hermonthica
genes.

Conclusions
This paper provides large scale EST information about S.
hermonthica, which can be used in studies of parasitic
plants, plant-plant interactions, weed management, and
plant evolution. Comparative analyses between S. hermonthica and other plant genomes should allow us to
identify genes responsible for plant parasitism. These
genes are of particular interest as potential targets for
future pest management strategies against noxious parasitic weeds. Our analysis also highlights the intra-species
genetic diversity of S. hermonthica. A more detailed analysis might contribute to future breeding programs to
develop resistant crops, since genetic variation in the
weed population could be the main factor allowing the
quick breakdown of resistance. In summary, our study
provides powerful analytical tools for the molecular analysis of the parasitic weed S. hermonthica. Our data will

alsocontribute to the annotation of genes identified by
the on-going genome-scale sequencing of the parasitic
genera from Orobanchaceae.

Methods
Plant materials and growth conditions

S. hermonthica seeds collected from a sorghum field in
1994 in Kenya were provided by Dr. A. G. Babiker (Univ.
of Sudan, Khartoum, Sudan). Rice seeds (Oryza sativa L.
subspecies japonica, cultivar Koshihikari) were originally
obtained from the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences (NIAS, Tsukuba, Japan). S. hermonthica plants parasitizing rice were grown in rhizotrons as described
previously [42] or in soil (1:1 mixture of vermiculite: clay).
For the axenic culture of S. hermonthica, seeds were sterilized with 20% bleach solution (approx. 6% NaOCl) for 5
min and washed thoroughly with sterile water. The sterile
seeds were preconditioned on MS medium with 1%
sucrose and 0.5% phytagel (Sigma) at 26°C for 7 to 10 days
in the dark and germination was stimulated by the exogenous application of 5 μl 1 μM Strigol per plate. Sterile S.
hermonthica plants were grown on the same medium at
26°C with a 16-h photoperiod, and the medium was
renewed every 3 weeks.
Determination of nuclear DNA content

The nuclear DNA content was analyzed with a flow
cytometer (Partec PA, Tokyo, Japan). Soil-grown S. hermonthica (host: rice) leaves were chopped with a razor
blade into small pieces and analyzed according to the previously published method [43]. Leaves of Arabidopsis
(ecotype Col -0) were used as the control.

The construction of the normalized, full-length enriched
library was carried out in Evrogen (Russia). The cDNA
normalization was conducted using a Duplex-specific
nuclease (DSN)-based method, and full-length cDNAs
were enriched using the SMART™ technology (Clontech).
Each cDNA was inserted into the pAL17.3 vector.
Sequencing of randomly picked clones was performed in
the Genome Center at Washington University using the
ABI3730 capillary sequencer.

SSR polymorphisms. A. S. hermonthica populations used in this study.

loci with a total of 27 alleles. Bootstrap values are indicated at supporting nodes when the values are greater than 50.

RNA extraction

The S. hermonthica tissues and developmental stages
used for RNA extraction are listed in Table 1. S. hermonthica RNAs were extracted using a modified cetyl
trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method. Briefly,
plant tissues were ground under liquid nitrogen and suspended in 5 × volumes of CTAB solution (2% CTAB, 2%
polybinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 25 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(EDTA), 2 M NaCl, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) and phenol:chloroform
(5:1, pH 4.7, Sigma). The mixtures were shaken at 55°C
for 5 min. After 10 min centrifugation, the aqueous phase
was extracted with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform, and subsequently with chloroform. The RNAs were
precipitated by adding 0.25 volumes of 10 M LiCl. The
RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and then dissolved in nuclease-free water. Samples were subsequently
purified using the PureLink RNA mini kit (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacture's instructions. To obtain
mRNA for library construction, total RNAs from each
tissue and developmental stage were mixed and purified
using an mRNA purification kit (GE) according to the
manufacture's instructions. The quality and quantity of
the total RNA and the mRNA were assessed by measure-

Computational analysis

The EST sequences were automatically trimmed, clustered and annotated using the EST2uni analysis pipeline
[15]. Sequence assembly was performed using the CAP3
program with the default parameter settings [44]. Blast
searches were performed with NCBI blast program
against the databases shown in Table 4. The S. hermonthica online database was constructed based on the
EST2uni web program with slight modifications.
SSR markers and genetic diversity analysis

Genomic DNA was extracted from about 10 g of S. hermonthica seeds using the modified CTAB method
described previously [35]. Primers flanking the microsatellites were designed using the PRIMER 3 program [45].
The PCRs were performed in 10 μl volumes with one initial denaturation step of 1 min at 95°C, followed by 40
cycles of 15 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 60°C and 30 sec at 72°C,
anda final extension step of 5 min at 72°C. The PCR products were analyzed either by 4% agarose gel electrophoresis (Additional file 6) or using the MCE-202 MultiNa
Microchip Electrophoresis System for DNA/RNA analysis (Shimadzu, Japan) using the DNA-500 kit (Table 5 and
Fig. 5). The data were analyzedusing the PowerMarker
program version 3.25 [46], and the genetic diversity was
estimated based on allelic numbersand the gene diversity
