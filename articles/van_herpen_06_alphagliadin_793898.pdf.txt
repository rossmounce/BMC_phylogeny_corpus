Abstract
Background: Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an important staple food. However, wheat gluten
proteins cause celiac disease (CD) in 0.5 to 1% of the general population. Among these proteins,
the α-gliadins contain several peptides that are associated to the disease.
Results: We obtained 230 distinct α-gliadin gene sequences from severaldiploid wheat species
representing the ancestral A, B, and D genomes of the hexaploid bread wheat. The large majority
of these sequences (87%) contained an internal stop codon. All α-gliadin sequences could be
distinguished according to the genome of origin on the basis of sequence similarity, of the average
length of the polyglutamine repeats, and of the differences in the presence of four peptides that
have been identified as T cell stimulatory epitopes in CD patients through binding to HLA-DQ2/8.
By sequence similarity, α-gliadins from the public database of hexaploid T. aestivum could be
assigned directly to chromosome 6A, 6B, or 6D. T. monococcum (A genome) sequences, as well as
those from chromosome 6A of bread wheat, almost invariably contained epitope glia-α9 and gliaα20, but never the intact epitopes glia-α and glia-α2. A number of sequences from T. speltoides, as
well as a number of sequences fromchromosome 6B of bread wheat, did not contain any of the
four T cell epitopes screened for. The sequences from T. tauschii (D genome), as well as those from
chromosome 6D of bread wheat, were found to contain all of these T cell epitopes in variable

combinations per gene. The differences in epitope composition resulted mainly from point
mutations. These substitutions appeared to be genome specific.
Conclusion: Our analysis shows that α-gliadin sequences from the three genomes of bread wheat
form distinct groups. The four known T cell stimulatory epitopes are distributed non-randomly
across the sequences, indicating that the three genomes contribute differently to epitope content.
A systematic analysis of all known epitopes in gliadins and glutenins will lead to better understanding
of the differences in toxicity among wheat varieties. On the basis of such insight, breeding strategies
can be designed to generate less toxic varieties of wheat which may be tolerated by at least part of
the CD patient population.

Background
Wheat is an important staple food because of its characteristics of high nutritional value, technical properties and
the long shelf life of the kernels. The wheat endosperm
contains 8–15% protein, of which 80% is gliadins and
glutenins. Hexaploid Triticum aestivum or bread wheat
originated around 8,000 years ago from a hybridization of
a tetraploid Triticum species with the diploid donor of the
D genome T. tauschii [1]. The A and B genomes were most
likely provided by T. turgidum, itself presumably formed
from the wild diploid T. monococcum (A genome) and the
donor of the B genome, a species which has so far defied
conclusive identification [1]. Morphological, geographical and cytological evidence suggests T. speltoides (S
genome) or a closely related species as the B genome
ancestor. Cytogenetic research showed that the B genome
is actually an altered S genome arisen by an exchange of
chromosomal segments with other diploids and amphiploids, such as Aegilops bicornis (Sb genome) or T. longissima
(Sl genome) [2]. According to Isidore et al. [3] polyploidization had a strong effect on intergenic sequences but the
gene space was conserved.
The α-type gliadins of hexaploid Triticum aestivum are
encoded by the Gli-2 locus on the short arm of the three
different group 6 chromosomes [4]. Estimates for α-gliadin copy number range from 25–35 copies [5] to 100 [6]
or even 150 copies [7] per haploid genome. Anderson and
Greene [8] compared the sequence of 27 known cDNA
and genomic clones of α-type gliadins and concluded that
about half of the latter contained "in frame" stop codons
and were presumably pseudogenes. The detailed constitution of the multi-gene locus is not known.
Gluten specific T cell responses in the small intestine play
an important role in producing the inflammatory
response in celiac disease (CD). Specific native gluten
peptides can bind to HLA-DQ2/8 and induce lamina propria CD4 T cell responses causing damage of the small
intestine mucosa [9,10]. Tissue damage initiates secretion
of the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG) for wound
healing. However, this enzyme also deamidates gluten
peptides, resulting in high affinity HLA-DQ2/8 binding

peptides that can further increase T cell responses. Multiple T cell epitope motifs have been identified in α- and γgliadins as well as in glutenins [11-14], the majority of
which show enhanced T cell recognition after deamidation. It also became clear that patients are generally sensitive to more than one gluten peptide. Although the DQ2/
8 interaction represents the most significant association
with CD so far defined, it is becoming clear that nonimmunogenic gluten peptides also have an impact on the
innate immunity system [15-17]. Clearly, the gluten peptide repertoire involved in CD is not yet complete.
Molberg et al. [18] and Spaenij-Dekking et al. [19] used T
cell and antibody-based assays to demonstrate that a large
variation exists in the amount of CD4 T cell stimulatory
peptides present in α- and γ-gliadins and glutenins among
diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid wheat accessions. If
this is the result of genetic differences in gluten proteins
with toxic epitopes, then this would allow to design strategies for selection and breeding of wheat varieties suitable
for consumption by CD patients.
In this study we first determine whether the α-gliadin
genes present in the A-, B- and D-genome ancestral species
are sufficiently different to attribute the ancestral genomic
origin of the α-gliadin genes in hexaploid bread wheat.
Secondly, we aim at understanding the diversity of CD
epitopes in the α-gliadin gene family in diploid and hexaploid wheat.

Results

Analysis of the genomic α-gliadin genes from diploid
species that represent the ancestral genomes of bread
wheat
The typical structure of the α-gliadin is depicted in Figure
1. The fact that the sequences at the 5' end (signal peptide)
and 3' end of the genes are highly conserved within the αgliadin gene family enables to obtain different members
of the gene family by a PCR-based method on genomic
DNA of various wheat species (Table 1). Accessions used
were Triticum monococcum, which represents the A
genome; T. speltoides (two accessions) and T. longissima
that represent relatives to the B genome, and T. tauschii as

netic tree. The sequences originated from the two T.
speltoides accessions (B genome) formed a relatively
diverse cluster. All five sequences derived from the two
different accessions of T. speltoides differed from each
other. Accordingly, the fact that the B genome sequences
were more diverse is not an artifact from the use of more
than one representative accession.

Figure 1
Schematic structure of an α-type gliadin protein
Schematic structure of an α-type gliadin protein. The protein
consists of a short N-terminal signal peptide (S) followed by a
repetitive domain (R) and a longer non-repetitive domain
(NR1 and NR2), separated by two polyglutamine repeats

cystein residues are present which are indicated with vertical
lines. The T cell epitopes are shown and their approximate
position is indicated.

representative of the D genome of wheat. We included
these two species to represent the B genome, since these
are thought to be related to the as yet unknown ancestor.
This yielded 230 unique DNA clones with high similarity
to known α-gliadin genes (Table 1) that were not present
in the public databases. Only 31 of these sequences contained a non-interrupted full open reading frame (full
ORF) α-gliadin gene. The great majority of the obtained
sequences contained one or more internal stop codons or
(rarely) a frameshift mutation (Table 1). We refer to the
latter sequences as pseudogenes. Remarkably, no full-ORF
genes but only pseudogenes from T. longissima were
found.
A phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid
sequence of the full-ORF α-gliadin genes demonstrated a
clear clustering of the sequences according to their
genome of origin (Figure 2). The sequences derived from
the A genome (T. monococcum) as well as the sequences
from the D genome (T. tauschii) each formed a separate
cluster of relatively closely related genes in the phyloge-

To investigate whether the observed clustering of the
sequences can be related to specific domains of the α-gliadin gene (Figure 1), the first repetitive domain (R), the
first (NR1) and the second non-repetitive domain (NR2)
were used separately in a phylogenetic analysis (not
shown). In all cases the sequences clustered according to
their genome of origin and again the A (T. monococcum)
and D genome (T. tauschii) sequences clustered separately
in two groups with closely related sequences whereas the
sequences originating from the B genome (T. speltoides)
formed a more diverse group with nodes of high bootstrap values. Only when using domain NR2 no significant
bootstrap values were attached to the nodes within this
group.
The two polyglutamine repeat domains were analyzed for
differences in the average number of glutamine residues.
Figure 3 shows large and also significant differences
between the average lengths of the polyglutamine repeats
depending on the genome of origin. The A genome (T.
monococcum) coded for a significantly larger average
number of glutamine residues in the first polyglutamine
repeat than the B and D genomes. In the second polyglutamine repeat, the B genome showed a significantly
larger number of glutamine residues than those of the
other two genomes (Figure 3). The analysis of the repeat
domains indicates that nearly all α-gliadin sequences can
be assigned to one of the three genomes using only the
combination of both repeat lengths.
Analysis of the pseudogenes
The great majority of the α-gliadin genes contained one or
more internal stop codons. We refer to them as pseudogenes, although we cannot predict from the genomic data

whether a subset is being expressed. A question is how
and when these pseudogenes did evolve. Therefore, we
determined their position in the clustering of the three
genomes, and the relationship with intact ORFs in the
same loci. These pseudogenes are structurally similar to
the full-ORF genes. The stop codons were nearly always
located at positions where the full-ORF genes contained a
glutamine residue codon. A stop codon was the result of a
C to T change in 77.2% of the cases when compared with
the full-ORF genes, altering a CAG or CAA codon for
glutamine into a TAG or TAA stop codon. In addition, we
observed that 15.5% of the stop codons were caused by T
to A change, altering the codon for leucine (TTG) into a
stop codon (TAG). Beside these major occurring substitutions we observed some C to A, C to G, G to T, and G to A
changes. Twenty of the 199 pseudogenes contained a

frameshift mutation (two were obtained from T. monococcum (A genome), two from T. tauschii (D genome) and 16
from T. longissima and the two T. speltoides accessions (B
genome)). The changes into stop codons were not distributed randomly across the amino acid residue positions in
the sequences, and they were not distributed evenly across
the various diploid species. A high percentage of stop
codons occurred jointly in one pseudogene, and many
pseudogenes from one species contained the same set of
stop codons, suggesting that they have been duplicated
after the mutations created the stop codons (Figure 4). A
dendrogram of the deduced amino acid sequence of the
great majority of non-frameshift pseudogenes, including
the deduced amino acids downstream of the internal stop
codon, closely resembled that of the full-ORF sequences.
Only eleven percent of all pseudogene sequences clus-

the genome of origin. The average number of the glutamine residues in the first (Q1) and second repeat (Q2) are shown
according to the genome of origin. The A genome (T. monococcum) sequences possessed a significantly higher average number
of glutamine residues in the first glutamine repeat (27.7 +/- 1.7) than the B (20.0 +/- 3.4) and D (20.7 +/- 1.1) genomes did. For
the second glutamine repeat, the B genome sequences demonstrated a significantly higher number of glutamine residues (18.8
+/- 1.9) than those of the other two genomes (A, 10.2 +/- 0.6; D, 9.7 +/- 1.4).

compare the selection pressure of the sequences up to the
first stop codon with that of the sequences beyond it.

To study the selection pressure on the obtained sequences
the number of synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous
(Ka) substitutions per site were calculated from pair wise
comparisons among the obtained full-ORF gene
sequences and the pseudogene sequences (Figure 5). The
trendlines indicated a relative excess of synonymous substitutions compared to non-synonymous substitutions
and showed a stronger excess for the full-ORF genes. Consequently, the mean Ka/Ks ratio for the genes was significantly lower than that of the pseudogenes (t test; P <
0.0005), indicating the occurrence of selection.

Analysis of sequences from hexaploid bread wheat
If the features described above that distinguish the α-gliadin genes from different diploid genomes, are present in
hexaploid wheat in the same way, this would make it possible to assign the sequences as well as the known T cell
stimulatory epitopes of α-gliadins from hexaploid wheat
to one of the three loci, on chromosome 6A, 6B, or 6D.
Since many hexapoid sequences are present in the public
database of EMBL/Genbank/DDBJ, we tested this using
the deduced amino acid sequence of these 56 full-ORF
genes to build a phylogenetic tree (accession numbers are
given in Table 2). The sequences of hexaploid wheat clustered into three different groups (data not shown), as did
the obtained sequences from this study, separated by a
very high bootstrap value (998/1000). Joint analysis

Since the first stop codons occur in various positions in
the pseudogenes, it was not feasible to select a large
number of sequences of sufficient and similar length to

Distribution of stop codons in the pseudogenes according to the amino acid position in the sequences
Distribution of stop codons in the pseudogenes according to the amino acid position in the sequences. The positions of the
stop codons are not distributed evenly across the various diploid species. The A genome sequences have a high percentage of
stop codons at positions 24, 42, 145, 199 and these four stop codons may occur jointly in one pseudogene sequence. The B
genome sequences also contain a high percentage of the jointly occurring stop codons at position 24, 145 and 199 but do not
contain the stop codon at position 42. The jointly occurring stop codons 24, 145 and 199 are present in a few pseudogenes
originating from the D genome. Pseudogenes from the A genome may contain another pair of jointly occurring stop codons at
position 113 and 184 whereas the pair at positions 64 and 121 occurs in B genome pseudogenes, and pairs of stop codons at
positions 65 and 83 and at the positions 99 and 252 occur in D genome pseudogenes.

showed that the three groups coincide, and this allowed
us to assign each of the genes of database sequences to one
of the three Gli-2 loci (Table 2).
Analysis of CD-toxic epitopes
Our phylogenetic analyses show that the α-gliadin genes
are distinct in their sequence conservation depending on
the genomic origin. Are these patterns also being reflected
in the occurrence of T cell stimulatory epitopes in the
genes depending on their genomic origin? Table 3 shows
the number of perfect matches in the obtained full-ORF
genes and in the pseudogenes to the four epitopes studied.
The results demonstrate that the set of epitopes is indeed
distinct for each genome. Firstly, in the A genome (T.
monococcum) sequences, the epitopes glia-α9 and glia-α20
were present in all 17 different full-ORF genes and in 39
(glia-α9) and in 38 (glia-α20) of the 44 pseudogenes.
However, the epitopes glia-α and glia-α2 were absent.

Also among the database sequences from hexaploid T.
aestivum the sequences assigned to chromosome 6A
showed the same trend in epitope occurrence (Table 2).
Secondly, in the five obtained full-ORF sequences from
the B genome species epitopes were completely absent
except for two genes which contained the epitope glia-α
only. Correspondingly, only four out of the 20 hexaploid
wheat database sequences that were assigned to chromosome 6B contained epitope glia-α, whereas all others were
without epitopes. Of the pseudogenes we obtained from
the B genome species, 17% contained the glia-α epitope
and only 3% the glia-α2 epitope, but these pseudogenes
did contain the epitopes glia-α9 and glia-α20 at frequencies of 53% and 55%, respectively. Finally, in the 11 fullORF sequences and the 64 pseudogenes obtained from
the D genome, a frequent occurrence of all four different
epitopes was found. This also applied to the five hexa-

ploid wheat database sequences assigned to chromosome
6D.
Each epitope had its own position in the α-gliadin protein. Glia-α was in all cases present in the second nonrepetitive domain (NR2), whereas glia-α2, glia-α9 and
glia-α20 were all found in the first repetitive domain (R).
A closer look at these sequences revealed that a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which resulted in an
amino acid change in a particular epitope, was present in
most or all genes originating from one of the three
genome. For example, Figure 6 shows that the glia-α
epitope in all of the full-ORF genes derived from the A
genome were disrupted at the fifth amino acid of the
epitope by the presence of an arginine (R) instead of a
glutamine (Q). In three B genome sequences the glia-α
epitope was disrupted at the second amino acid of the
epitope by the presence of valine (V) instead of a glycine
(G). A detailed overview of presence of the epitopes gliaα2, glia-α9 and glia-α20 in the obtained full-ORF
sequences are shown in Figure 7.

Here we show for the first time that large differences exist
in the content of predicted T cell epitopes (glia-α, glia-α2,
glia-α9, glia-α20) in full-ORF genes and pseudogenes
from the diploid species. This phenomenon was also in
hexaploid wheat. None of the diploid A genome
sequences and none of the sequences from chromosome
6A in the hexaploid bread wheat contained glia-α and
glia-α2 epitopes (Table 2 and 3). In contrast, the
sequences from the D genome contained all four epitopes
at high frequencies, both in the diploid species and in the
hexaploid bread wheat. For the B genome, the five diploid
and 20 hexaploid full-ORF sequences rarely contained the
epitope glia-α and did not contain one of the other three
epitopes. Based on this analysis, we predict that among
the α-gliadin proteinss, those coded by the B genome are
the least likely to stimulate CD4 T cells. Remarkably, the
pseudogenes revealed the presence of all the epitopes. In
these analyses we have assumed that a single amino acid
substitution is sufficient to prevent such peptides from
stimulating the T cells, especially since the substitutions
often concern a glutamine residue. Glutamine residues

Discussion
Gene copy number and complexity
The diploid wheat species used in this study contain a
large number of α-gliadin copies in their genome. The
sequences we obtained show that the fraction of genes
with in-frame stop codons is very high, ranging from 72%
in the A genome species to 95% in the B genome species
(Table 1). Our in silico comparison shows a similar situation in hexaploid wheat. The fraction of these pseudogenes appears to be higher than previously found by
Anderson and Greene [8]. Analysis of the synonymous
(Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitutions in the
obtained full-ORF genes and pseudogenes revealed that
the pseudogenes contain more non-synonymous substitutions than the full-ORF genes. This is consistent with a
reduced selection pressure on the pseudogenes. These
results suggest that the majority of these sequences are not
expressed (or only expressed up to the first stop codon).
Evolution
The obtained full-ORF genes cluster together according to
their genome of origin in a phylogenetic analysis. The
sequence differences in the various domains of the α-gliadin genes all contribute to this clustering. The differences
consisted of point mutations leading to amino acid
changes at specific positions. These amino acid changes
are often genome specific, suggesting that most of the
duplications of this gene family have taken place after the
different diploid species separated from a common ancestor. From our data, the length differences in the two
glutamine repeats of the gliadin genes, which were as
observed by Anderson and Greene [8], turned out to be
related to the genomic origin of the genes as well. This
may have occurred through the same mechanism as was

found in the evolution of microsatellite repeats, where
large-range mutations (duplication or deletion of a larger
number of repeats through unequal crossing-over) occur
infrequently, while small-step mutations (one repeat
longer or shorter due to slippage) are frequent [20]. This
would produce groups of similarly-sized repeats in the
sequences from each genome, but the average length of
each glutamine repeat could be quite different between
different genomes. In addition, the large differences in the
average lengths of the two repeats in the same gene indicate that unequal crossing-over between the two repeats
does not take place.
Interestingly, our results clearly indicate that at least 70%
of the stop codons in the pseudogenes are position and
genome specific. The occurrence of stop codons at identical positions in different sequences demonstrates that
pseudogene duplication has occurred. The observation
that three of the stop codon positions are shared between
the A and the B genome implies that some pseudogene
duplications must have taken place in the common ancestor.
Based on the structural similarities to other gliadin storage
proteins like the γ- and ω-gliadins [21], the α-gliadin
genes on chromosome 6 are suggested to have originated
from a gliadin gene on chromosome 1 through a duplication and/or translocation event [22] after the separation
of wheat from rye and barley [21]. We observed that the
α-gliadin genes of T. speltoides, and of the corresponding B
genome in hexaploid bread wheat as well, are more
diverse than the α-gliadin genes on the A and D genome.
One explanation for this phenomenon is chromosome
exchange with other species during the formation of the
ancestral B genome, which is also suggested by other
authors [1]. The diversity of the pseudogenes obtained
from T. speltoides and T. longissima also supports this
assumption. In addition, the outbreeding character of

there is no evidence for a specific contribution of the Gli2 locus on chromosome 6D to baking quality.
Our study focused on α-gliadin genes present in the
genome, and did not consider possible differences in
expression among the multiple copies of α-gliadin genes.
Spaenij-Dekking and colleagues [19] found large differences in T cell stimulatory epitopes in protein from different hexaploid and tetraploid accessions. Combined with
our results, this may imply large differences in expression
of toxic D-genome α-gliadin genes, possibly through
interaction with the homologous loci on other chromosomes, as was found for ω-gliadins [23]. In that case, the
mRNA pool of α-gliadins would not perfectly match the
genomic composition. Alternatively, genetic differences
do exist in α-gliadin sequences among hexaploid wheat
cultivars.

these species may have further facilitated this recombination and maintenance of diversity.
T cell stimulatory epitopes in α-gliadin sequences
Our results indicate that, with respect to T cell toxicity as
far as caused by α-gliadins, and based on currently known
α-gliadin epitopes, the Gli-2 locus on the D genome
should be considered as the most relevant.. This is in
agreement with the results of Spaenij-Dekking and colleagues [19] who found the highest presence of T cellstimulatory epitopes (glia-α-2/9) in D genome species
compared to A and B genome species. In addition Molberg et al. [18] found that fragments identical or equivalent to a αG-33 mer protein fragment appear to be
encoded by α-gliadin genes on the wheat chromosome
6D and are absent from gluten of diploid Einkorn wheat
(A genome) and even certain cultivars of the tetraploid
pasta wheat (AB genome). If these predictions are confirmed in in vivo studies it may follow that breeding of
bread wheat for low toxicity should focus, as one of the
targets, on lowering the α-gliadin proteins from the D
genome. The D genome has contributed significantly to
many characteristics of hexaploid wheat, including baking
quality, through HMW glutenins on chromosome 1D, but

We have shown for the first time that α-gliadins from diploid Triticum species form distinct groups. This is reflected
in large differences in the content of four T cell stimulatory epitopes (glia-α, glia-α2, glia-α9, glia-α20) in fullORF α-gliadin genes and pseudogenes from these diploid
species. Similar differences were shown to exist between
the three genomes of hexaploid bread wheat. The
sequence information we obtained forms a useful prerequisite for study of expressed α-gliadin mRNA and determination of both their genome of origin and their epitope
content. Besides, the genetic composition of the α-gliadin
loci needs to be compared across a large series of hexaploid bread wheat cultivars. As there may be more, still
unknown, T cell stimulatory epitopes in all types of gluten
proteins, and given that the role of the innate immune
system is only beginning to be understood, it may be premature to start breeding of non-toxic wheat varieties.
However, our results indicate that (re)construction of hexaploid wheat using a non-toxic D genome donor would
reduce the overall T cell stimulation in CD patients.

Methods

DNA extraction from wheat kernels
Accessions (Table 1) were obtained from VIR, St. Petersburg, Russia (T. longissima) and CGN, Wageningen, the
Netherlands (T. tauschii, T. monococcum and T. speltoides).
We followed the taxonomy of Triticum of Morris & Sears
[24]. Wheat kernels (250 mg) were grinded in liquid
nitrogen and subsequently 5 ml of 65°C preheated extraction buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.5 M NaCl; 50 mM
Na2EDTA; 1.25 % (w/v) SDS; 3.8 g/l NaHSO4) was added
to the powder and was incubated at 65°C for 45 minutes.
Then, 8 ml of chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1 v/v) was
added. The mixture was shaken and centrifuged for 15

ice-cold ethanol 96 % (v/v) was added. The tubes were
shaken and consequently centrifuged for 10 min at 3000
rpm. The pellet was washed 2 times with 4 ml of 70 % ethanol and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 3000
rpm. The pellet was air-dried and dissolved in 500 µl of TE
(10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 1 mM EDTA) + 10 µg/ml
RNaseA. The solution was finally heated for 10 min at

Amplification of α-gliadin genomic sequences
Primers to amplify α-gliadin genes from genomic DNA
using PCR were designed on the conserved sequences at
the 5' and 3' end of the coding region of the α-gliadin gene
sequences obtained from the public database (forward
primer, 1F: 5'-ATG AAG ACC TTT CTC ATC C-3', and
reverse primer, 5R: 5'-GTT AGT ACC GAA GAT GCC-3').
Amplification was performed in a 25 µl reaction volume,
containing 0.2 µM reverse and 0.2 µM forward primer,
dNTP mix (0.25 mM each), 1 – Pfu buffer (Stratagene), 20
ng chromosomal DNA and a mixture of (1/4 v/v) Pfu

Cloning and sequencing
The PCR products (lengths ranging from 900 to 1100 bp)
were ligated into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and
subsequently used for the transformation of E. coli-XL1blue cells (Stratagene). Recombinants were identified
using blue-white color selection. Positive colonies were
picked and grown overnight at 37°C in freeze media (36
mM K2HPO4, 13.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.7 mM trisodium citrate, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 6.8 mM (NH4)2SO4, 4.4 % v/v glycerol, 100 µg/ml ampiciline, 10 g/l tryptone, 5 g/l yeast
extract and 5 g/l NaCl). The cloned insert was amplified
directly from the culture in a PCR reaction using the M13
forward primer (5'-CGC CAG GGT TTT CCC AGT CAC
GAC-3') and the M13 reverse primer (5'-AGC GGA TAA
CAA TTT CAC ACA GGA-3') in 20 µl reaction volume containing 2 µl of culture. The reaction mixture consisted of
the same components as well as concentrations, and utilized the same PCR program as described before. The
amplified product was used in a sequencing reaction
using 1F and 5R primers. Additional primers were
designed on two other conserved regions of the α-gliadin
gene to sequence the insert: one internal forward primer
(designed on pos. 292–309), Fi1: 5'-CAA CCA TAT CCA
CAA CCG-3', and one internal reverse primer (designed
on position 599–615), Ri1: 5'-CA(C/T) TGT GG(A/C)
TGG CTT GGC-3'. The sequence data were manually
checked using the computer program Seqman from the
DNAstar package. The obtained sequences were deposited
in GenBank (accession numbers in Table 1).
Phylogenetic analyses of the obtained α-gliadin clones
The deduced amino acid sequences were aligned using
Clustal X (version 1.81). Phylogenetic trees were inferred
by neighbour-joining (Clustal X) and parsimony (PHYLIP
version 3.57c; DNAPARS) [25] and subsequently viewed
using TreeView (version 1.6.6). The phylogenetic trees
from the neighbour-joining (Figure 2) and parsimony
analysis (not shown) were nearly identical and differed
only in the organization of branches that were supported
by low bootstrap values.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the full-ORF clones
were analyzed without the targeting sequence (first 17
amino acids were removed) up to the former last conserved cystein residue (lengths range from 244 to 271
amino acids). In this way both primer regions were omitted. The first repetitive domain (R) (Figure 1) was analyzed from the amino acid residue on position 18
(targeting sequence was removed) until the start of the

first polyglutamine repeat (length of first domain 93–105
amino acids). The first non-repetitive domain (NR1)
starts with the first amino acid after the first polyglutamine repeat and ends one amino acid before the second glutamine repeat (length 68–73 amino acids). The
third domain starts with the first amino acid after the second polyglutamine repeat until the former last conserved
cystein residue (length 57 or 58 amino acid residues). The
glutamine repeats were analyzed using the number of
amino acid residues located between the beginning and
the end of the polyglutamine repeat.
Analysis on synonymous and non-synonymous substitution
The obtained nucleotide sequences were aligned codonby-codon using Clustal W. We analysed general selection
patterns at the molecular level using DnaSp 4.00 [26].
Insertions or deletions that cause a frame-shift were
treated as non-synonymous substitutions. The number of
synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous substitutions
(Ka) per site were calculated from pair wise comparisons
with incorporation of the Jukes-Cantor correction, as
described by Nei and Gojobori [27]. Pair wise comparisons with fewer than seven non-synonymous mutations
refer to closely related sequences and contain no useful
information on substitution rates. This concerned 2528
out of 9243 pair wise comparisons, which were excluded
from the analyses.
Epitope screening
All α-gliadin DNA sequences obtained in this study were
translated to protein sequences and converted into FASTA
format. In addition, public domain gliadin and glutenin
sequences from bread wheat were extracted in FASTA-format from the Uniprot database http://www.uniprot.org
with the following conditions: Triticum aestivum and (gliadin or glutenin). The program PeptideSearch [28] was
used for matching the predicted epitopes from α-gliadin
with the databases described above. Only perfect matches
were considered in the scoring.
