Abstract
Background: One objective of metagenomics is to reconstruct information about specific
uncultured organisms from fragmentary environmental DNA sequences. We used the genome of
an isolate of the marine alphaproteobacterium SAR11 ('Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique'; strain
HTCC1062), obtained from the cold, productive Oregon coast, as a query sequence to study
variation in SAR11 metagenome sequence data from the Sargasso Sea, a warm, oligotrophic ocean
gyre.
Results: The average amino acid identity of SAR11 genes encoded by the metagenomic data to the
query genome was only 71%, indicating significant evolutionary divergence between the coastal
isolates and Sargasso Sea populations. However, an analysis of gene neighbors indicated that SAR11
genes in the Sargasso Sea metagenomic data match the gene order of the HTCC1062 genome in
96% of cases (> 85,000 observations), and that rearrangements are most frequent at predicted
operon boundaries. There were no conserved examples of genes with known functions being
found in the coastal isolates, but not the Sargasso Sea metagenomic data, or vice versa, suggesting
that core regions of these diverse SAR11 genomes are relatively conserved in gene content.
However, four hypervariable regions were observed, which may encode properties associated with
variation in SAR11 ecotypes. The largest of these, HVR2, is a 48 kb region flanked by the sole 5S
and 23S genes in the HTCC1062 genome, and mainly encodes genes that determine cell surface
properties. A comparison of two closely related 'Candidatus Pelagibacter' genomes (HTCC1062
and HTCC1002) revealed a number of "gene indels" in core regions. Most of these were found to
be polymorphic in the metagenomic data and showed evidence of purifying selection, suggesting
that the same "polymorphic gene indels" are maintained in physically isolated SAR11 populations.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that natural selection has conserved many core features of
SAR11 genomes across broad oceanic scales, but significant variation was found associated with
four hypervariable genome regions. The data also led to the hypothesis that some gene insertions
and deletions might be polymorphisms, similar to allelic polymorphisms.

Background
A particularly vexing aspect of microbial genomics is the
common observation of high genome variability among
strains of a species [1-3]. Such observations have raised
significant questions about the validity of the microbial
species concept, and the value of single genome sequences
for comparisons between taxa [4]. To reconcile this
dilemma, it has been suggested that bacterial species have
a "core-genome" consisting of genes that are always
present, and a "pan-genome" of genes that are variably
present [3]. Metagenomics, the study of genome sequence
retrieved from mixed assemblages of organisms collected
from nature, is providing high coverage of genome
sequence variation from natural microbial communities
[5], which can be employed to study the conservation of
genome features and illustrate patterns of natural variation.
The Sargasso Sea metagenomic data
The Sargasso Sea is an oligotrophic subtropical gyre where
average surface temperatures are about 23°C, and rarely
drop below 20°C [6]. The Sargasso Sea metagenomic data
consists of 1.6 G base pairs of unique environmental
genomic DNA shotgun sequence. The SAR11 clade
accounts for 380 of the 1,412 SSU rRNA genes in the Sargasso Sea data (27%), suggesting that it includes enough
SAR11 genome sequence data to encode the equivalent of
about 775 SAR11 strain HTCC1062 genomes [7]. Despite
the abundance of SAR11 genome sequences in the Sargasso Sea data, the assembly of SAR11 genomes failed
when traditional DNA assembly methods were applied
[7]. The largest SAR11 rRNA-anchored scaffold reconstructed with the Celera Assembler was relatively small
(ca. 21,000 bp), and assembly depth-of-coverage was low
(0.94 – 2.2 fold) [7].
Genome streamlining
The genome streamlining theory was invoked to explain
the small genomes of 'Candidatus Pelagibacter' and
Prochlorococcus [8,9]. The essence of the genome streamlining theory is that selection is most efficient in microbial
populations that have large effective population sizes, and
therefore the elimination of unnecessary DNA from
genomes will be most pronounced in organisms, like bacterioplankton, that meet this criterion. In particular,
"genome streamlining" usually refers to the elimination
of functionless DNA from genomes, because of the cost of
replication. However, in principle the same concept
should apply to other features of genome evolution. If the
genome streamlining theory is correct, then, in large bac-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/27

terioplankton populations, selection should be unusually
efficient at preserving all genome features that have a positive fitness associated with them, and eliminating features that confer a negative fitness.
Ecologically significant variation in SAR11 populations
This observation of high sequence diversity led to speculation that the SAR11 clade might be a diverse assemblage
of perhaps hundreds or thousands of species, each with
low coverage in the shotgun sequence library [7]. However, ecological data suggests that the SAR11 clade consists of a few ecotypes, which can be differentiated either
phylogenetically [10], or by their appearance in the environment at different depths and seasons [11]. A phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNAs revealed the presence of two
SAR11 ecotypes in the Sargasso Sea metagenomic data
[12]. Rusch et al. [13] reported evidence of nine genetically divergent SAR11 populations in metagenomic data
from different ocean surface sites. The interpretation most
consistent with this data is that the large population sizes
of SAR11, and the age of these clades, allow them to accumulate very extensive neutral sequence variation that
renders assembly difficult, but that there are relatively few,
perhaps less than a dozen, ecotypes that are important to
the ecology of the oceans [2].

Throughout this paper we refer to genes found in the
metagenomic data as "SAR11 genes" if they were found on
fragments of DNA sequence that harbored at least one
gene identified as a 'Candidatus Pelagibacter' gene, according to the tests described below. We use the term 'Pelagibacter', to refer to genes from the two sequenced genomes
of 'Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique', because these isolates
are genetically distinct from Sargasso Sea SAR11 populations. Pelagibacter strains HTCC1062 and HTCC1002
were isolated from the cold, nutrient rich Oregon coast
[14,15], have an average 16S rRNA sequence similarity to
SAR11 16S rRNA genes from the Sargasso Sea metagenomic data of 96%, and belong to a 23S-ITS-16S phylogenetic cluster that is distinct from Sargasso Sea populations
[16]. In addition to ocean currents and geography, the
large temperature difference between the Sargasso Sea and
the Oregon coast is most likely a significant barrier that
isolates their respective SAR11 populations. A SAR11
strain obtained very recently from the Sargasso Sea,
HTCC7211, shows a higher temperature optimum than
the Oregon coast isolates, as predicted from the significant
difference in temperature between these environments
(Stingl, unpublished data).
Autecology approaches to the study of metagenomic data
Autecology is the study of the ecology of species. A variety
of approaches have been employed to infer information
about microbial genome variation for specific taxa from
metagenomic data, with the intent of understanding the

roles of organisms in ocean surface ecology. Hallam et al.
[17], used a composite genome sequence of Cenarchaeum
symbiosum to study the diversity of Marine Group I
archaeal genomes in metagenomic databases using BLAST
score ratios [18] to identify conserved genes, and a similar
approach was employed by Coleman to study genome
variation in Prochlorococcus [19]. Recently, a study was
published by Rusch et al. [13] that used marine microbial
genomes as templates to identify environmental fragments from ocean metagenomic data. Rusch et al. [13]
used BLASTN to identify homologs to SAR11 genes, but
did not employ further tests to exclude homologs originating from non-SAR11 organisms.

in SAR11 populations. A full description of a species or
ecotype might include: 1) a list of core genes that confer a
relatively conserved phenotype, 2) a list of ancillary genes
that may be found, along with the probabilities that each
gene is present, and 3) information about patterns in gene
composition and gene order that reflect evolutionary
processes, such as the divergence of species or ecotypes.

Objectives
The objective of this study was to identify genomic features of SAR11 that are conserved between two Pelagibacter isolates and their counterparts in the Sargasso Sea.
The predicted proteins of the HTCC1062 genome were
used as TBLASTN queries to identify homologs to SAR11
proteins in the Sargasso Sea metagenomic DNA, and only
genes that retrieved Pelagibacter homologs as their top
scores when the NCBInr database was searched with
BLASTP were classified as SAR11 genes. We quantified
gene-to-gene boundaries to assess gene insertions, deletions and rearrangements, and the occurrence of nonorthologous genes adjacent to Pelagibacter orthologs. We
measured synteny and displayed the relationship between
synteny and amino acid identity in a novel way that
allows observation of small-scale gene insertions (<5
genes). Collectively, these tools enabled us to ask questions about the presence of genes in conserved gene order,
gene rearrangements, and the juxtaposition of Pelagibacter homologs with genes that are not found in Pelagibacter, which might reveal genes unique to the Sargasso
Sea population. To our surprise, with the exception of the
hypervariable regions of the genome, we found that the
genomes of the divergent population we studied were
remarkably similar to the query genome in gene content
and gene order. The results suggest that extraordinarily
high allelic variation and genome rearrangements mask
the conservation of many genome properties in native
SAR11 populations.

Strategy
The bioinformatic strategy we employed is outlined in Fig.
2. Table 1 lists the number of fragments in the metagenomic dataset, and the number of those that had TBLASTN

HTCC7211, which was recently isolated from the Sargasso
Sea. All other HTCC strains are from the coastal Pacific
Ocean. The non-HTCC numbers correspond to the fragment identifier in the Sargasso Sea data set. The scale bar

The genome sequence of any individual microbial cell is a
sub-sample of natural variation. Metagenomics is now
providing extraordinary datasets that deeply sample natural variation, raising the question, how should this variation be represented? We have taken a comparative
approach to learn more about SAR11 genomes, but we
have also searched for evolutionary models that will help
us understand and graphically represent natural genome
variation. Our comparative approach stems from a larger
goal of understanding the nature of species and ecotypes

Phylogenetic relationships between the query genome
and SAR11 genomes represented in the metagenomic data
are shown in Fig. 1. The tree supports the presence of two
sub-clades in the Sargasso Sea metagenomic data, as previously reported [12].

An expect score of 1 × 10-10 was employed in the initial
homolog detection step (Fig. 3A). This is a relatively permissive cutoff that ensures the inclusion of homologs,
including those from distant taxa, such as other alphaproteobacteria. For convenience, we hereafter refer to this set
of fragments as 'homologous fragments'. The log of the
number of homologous fragments for each HTCC1062
Coding Sequence (CDS) is shown as a function of gene
position in Fig. 3A. We found that homologous fragments
from the Sargasso Sea cover 97% of the HTCC1062
genome and account for 43% of the fragments in the complete dataset (349,742 of 811,372, Table 1). This number
is somewhat high when compared to predictions from
SSU rRNA data – SAR11 genes account for 27% of the
total SSU rRNA genes found among the fragments. This
observation is not unexpected, considering that the set of
homologous fragments contains homologs from nonSAR11 species as well as genes originating from SAR11. Of
the 1,354 CDSs in the HTCC1062 genome, 32 are found
on at least 3,000 environmental fragments (the maximum
number returned from our homolog search), and 31 are
not found at all. Fig. 3A reveals three regions of the
HTCC1062 genome where coverage is low. These hypervariable regions are labeled HVR1 through HVR4. The
longest of these, HVR2, spans almost 50 CDSs.

The position of the fragment on the vertical axis corresponds
to the average amino acid identity score of all the genes on
the fragment.

Synteny
We define "syntenic fragments" as homologous fragments
that passed the best-hit and synteny tests (Fig. 2B,C). Of
the 349,742 fragments shown in Fig. 3A, 111,332 share
synteny with HTCC1062. A large proportion of the
"homologous fragments with synteny" (71,696) passed
the best-hit test and were therefore placed in the "syntenic
fragments" bin (Table 1, Fig. 3D). Several lines of evidence indicate that the process used to "bin" sequences
originating from SAR11 was neither too stringent nor too
relaxed. The maximum in the distribution of expect scores
for genes on syntenic fragments is 1 × 10-33 and declines
sharply as it approaches 1 × 10-10, suggesting that the most
abundant clade of genes in the dataset, which is predicted
to be SAR11, are included, but the tail of the distribution,
is excluded (Additional file 1). Also, the average GC content of the syntenic fragments, 29.1%, is nearly identical
to that of the HTCC1062 genome (29.7%) and the plot-

expect scores lower than 1 × 10-10 to HTCC1062 genes,
which we called "homologous fragments". We use the
term "fragment" to refer to DNA sequences from the Sargasso Sea environmental data set, whether they are single
reads or contigs assembled from multiple reads. Table 1
also lists the number of homologous fragments that
retrieved HTCC1062 or HTCC1002 genes as their best
BLAST hits against the NCBInr database. These we called
"homologous fragments that passed the best-hit test". We
then identified fragments that were syntenic with the
query genome, and those that were not. The former we
called "syntenic fragments". We used these classes of fragments to study the conservation of amino acid identity,
gene content and gene order in the Sargasso Sea SAR11
metagenome.

To visualize variation among the syntenic fragments, the
data were plotted as a function of gene position in the
HTCC1062 genome and amino acid identity (Fig. 3D).
The vertical axis is inverted (low amino acid identity
scores at the top) to emphasize the high-scoring syntenic
fragment's relationship to the template genome. The syntenic fragments shown in Fig. 3D vary in average aminoacid identity score from 30% to 98%, with an average of
71.0%. The ranges spanned on the vertical axis vary
between genes because the amino acid sequences of some
genes are more conserved than others. For example, genes
for ribosomal proteins appear relatively low in the plots
(Fig. 3D, regions colored black). Though 86% of the syntenic fragments carry just two genes, the distribution of
syntenic fragments across the HTCC1062 genome is very
similar when syntenic fragments carrying three or more
genes are plotted (Additional file 5).
The Sargasso Sea metagenome data includes assemblies
that are known to contain some errors resulting from
unrelated fragments being joined incorrectly [20]. However, an analysis of syntenic fragments that did not
include assemblies (Additional file 6) yielded similar
plots that supported the same conclusions.

gaps. Syntenic fragments were allowed to be missing as many

ted values approximate a normal distribution (Additional
file 2). Tests that used other query genomes (E. coli,
Prochlorococcus marinus and Croceibacter atlanticus) supported the conclusion that the procedure used to identify
syntenic fragments is selective (Table 2, Additional files 3
and 4).

Syntenic fragments cover most of the HTCC1062 genome
(Fig. 3D), indicating that gene order is relatively conserved between the Pacific coastal strains and the Sargasso
Sea SAR11 population. An analysis of gene-to-gene
boundaries revealed that gene order in 96% of the Sargasso Sea SAR11 homologous fragments matches the gene
order of the HTCC1062 genome (see synteny index, in
Methods). While the aforementioned facts are striking,
they nonetheless allow considerable latitude for genome
rearrangements. To map genome rearrangements we plotted the gene positions found on non-syntenic fragments
(Fig. 4). These are fragments containing two or more adjacent SAR11 genes that differ from HTCC1062 in gene
order. Fragment inclusion in this set follows the same
rules as those in Fig. 2, except no synteny requirement was
imposed. The high incidence of synteny (Fig. 3D) can be
reconciled with the many gene rearrangements shown in
Fig. 4 by considering that a few very frequent rearrangements account for most of the cases of rearranged genes.
3,350 fragments had at least two genes that passed the
best-hit test but displayed an alternate gene order. Of the
627 different genes found in non-syntenic positions in
Fig. 4, seventeen can be tracked to genes that are not
found on any syntenic fragments (Table 3). These are
likely to represent examples of gene re-arrangements that
are conserved in the Sargasso Sea SAR11 population relative to the Oregon coast population.
Genome rearrangements were not random, but were concentrated at boundaries between operons. We compared

icant (see methods). Perhaps not surprisingly, this finding
suggests that selection allows rearrangements between
operons more frequently than re-arrangements within
operons.
The number of Sargasso Sea fragments in SAR11 syntenic
fragment plots declines sharply at sequence similarities
above 90%, indicating that the coastal isolates are genetically distinct from their counterparts in the Sargasso Sea.
Sequence identity between the syntenic genes and the
HTCC1062 genome ranged from high (98%) to low
(30%) and averaged 71%. SSU rRNA variation supported
a similar conclusion: the average sequence identity of
SAR11 16S rRNA fragments from the Sargasso Sea metagenomic data to HTCC1062 is 96.0% ± 2.8% (sd), with a
median of 96.9% (n = 379). For comparison, the amino
acid identity between E. coli and Salmonella for GroEL is
98% and among Burkholderia species is 75%, whereas the
lowest SAR11 GroEL syntenic fragments have an amino
acid identity of 77% (avg = 0.87). For RecA the numbers
are 96% similarity for E. coli and Salmonella, 92% within
the genus Burkholderia, and 63% (avg = 0.81) for the lowest syntenic fragments. Hallam et al. observed a similar
average amino acid identity (65%) among 4,000 Sargasso
Sea fragments related to C. symbosium, and conservation of
gene-order as well [17]. Coleman et al. [19] observed a
protein sequence identity of 80% among 1,574 genes
between two strains of the abundant marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus that are 99.2% similar at the 16S
rRNA locus. Syntenic fragment analysis predicts a very
similar average sequence identity in the Prochlorococcus
metagenome (79%, Additional file 4).
The high sequence divergence observed in the metagenomic data cannot be explained by assuming weak selection. The ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous
substitution rates for a selection of 19 genes from the syn-

tenic fragment data ranges from 0.04 to 0.23, indicating
purifying selection (Table 4). The implication of this
observation is that the divergence of amino acid
sequences in the Sargasso Sea SAR11 populations is occurring in proteins that serve important functions.
Scrutinized in detail, the syntenic fragment plots reveal
many conserved differences between the HTCC strain
genomes and the SAR11 metagenome. For example, the
syntenic fragment plots illustrate that the Sargasso Sea

SAR11 genomes include proteorhodopsin genes (Fig.

pumps that are hypothesized to provide an alternative
energy source for bacterioplankton cells [22,23]. Many of
the genes surrounding the Sargasso Sea SAR11 proteorhodopsins are syntenic with the same regions of the
HTCC1062 genome, but the syntenic fragment plots indicate that there are two conserved gene deletions downstream of the PR gene in the metagenomic data (Fig. 5B).

passed the best-hit test", above (Fig. 5A), shows that the
MOSC binding protein (CDS 629) is found consistently
elsewhere in the SAR11 metagenome, but no close
homologs to the other "gene indel", CDS 631, were
detected.
Nowhere in this analysis did we see clear evidence of the
Sargasso Sea SAR11 ecotypes reported previously from
this dataset [12], and suggested by Fig. 1. This is not to say
that there are no patterns in the plots, particularly the syntenic fragment plots, related to ecotypic variation. Our
interpretation is that the dominant two SAR11 ecotypes
represented by the metagenomic data are too similar in
core genome regions to be discriminated by the
approaches we employed, and are best detected by phylogenetic analyses such as that shown in Fig. 1.
Hypervariable regions
Although the distributions of homologous fragments and
syntenic fragments suggest a relatively conserved SAR11
"core" genome, they also revealed four distinct hypervariable regions, HVR1 – 4 (Fig. 3A,C, Fig. 6, Additional files
7 and 8). Both gene order (synteny) and sequence similarity drop dramatically in the SAR11 hypervariable regions,
causing them to stand out prominently as gaps in the
plots of homologs and syntenic fragments (Fig. 3A,C, Fig.
6, Additional files 7 and 8). Rusch saw evidence of the

same HVRs in "recruitment plots" [13]. "Islands" of
genome variability similar to the HVRs we report have
been found in many microbial genomes [19,24]. They
have been shown to include genes potentially involved in
pathogenicity [25] and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis [26]. Most evidence for large microbial pangenomes comes from variable genomic islands.
The largest of the SAR11 hypervariable regions, HVR2, is a
48 kb region flanked by the sole 5S and 23S rRNA genes
in the HTCC1062 genome. HVR2 mainly contains proposed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis genes (Table
5), and appears to be analogous to previously observed
regions encoding cell surface properties. Based on current
annotations, all but one of the enzymes involved in the
biosynthetic pathways for the inner and outer core of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are present in HVR2, while the
enzymes involved in synthesis of the unexposed regions
of the LPS are found elsewhere in the genome (Table 5).
The existence of a hypervariable region similar to HVR2 in
the Sargasso Sea SAR11 population was inferred from the
metagenomic data. Only two fragments containing SAR11
16S rRNA genes are found among the 349,742 homologous fragments, but SAR11 5S rRNA genes were found on
36 fragments. Nineteen of these fragments carried
homologs to HTCC1062 CDS 570 upstream of the 5S
rRNA gene, as found in the HTCC1062 genome, suggesting that the Sargasso Sea SAR11 cells, like the Pelagibacter
isolates, have split ribosomal RNA operons.

The remaining SAR11 HVR's appear to be related to transport and secretion (HVR1&4) or unknowns (HVR3)
(Tables 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). The transport and secretion
functionality associated with HVRs 1 and 4 is consistent
with the assertion of Coleman [19] that these islands may
play a role in niche adaptation by supporting differential
nutrient acquisition capabilities.

Comparison of the genomes of HTCC1062 and
HTCC1002, which were isolated from the same seawater
sample [14], provided further support for the conclusion
that some HVRs are hotspots for the acquisition of foreign
DNA by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The genome of
HTCC1002 is 12,298 nucleotides larger than the genome
of HTCC1062. Most of the length difference is due to 31
genes inserted in HVR3 of HTCC1002. The 16S rRNAs of

these strains differ by one nucleotide, and in protein coding regions they are 97.4% similar in nucleotide sequence.
Although HGT is clearly a source of variation in the HVRs,
gene duplications were also observed in the comparison
of HTCC1002 and HTCC1062, suggesting that other
mechanisms of genome evolution might be contributing
the high variability observed in these genome regions
(Fig. 7).
Gene indels in core regions of the HTCC1002 and
HTCC1062 genomes: could they be polymorphic sites?
Given the high conservation of core regions of the
genome suggested by the plots of syntenic fragments, we
were at first surprised to find, in comparisons of the
HTCC1062 and HTCC1002 genomes, 62 gene indels
(gene insertions in one genome relative to the other) in
core regions.

Various data support the model that cells normally harbor
a transient pool of neutral genes that are continually
culled by a deletion bias in DNA replication [27-29]. The

prediction is that random gene insertions will be "neutral" in the sense that they are under no (or low) evolutionary pressure. Syntenic fragment plots provide a test of
this model, since the prediction is that there will be no
coverage in the column above genes that are randomly
inserted into the query genome. Of 62 indels between the
two genomes, 44 are deletions in HTCC1002 relative to
HTCC1062, and are thus testable with the HTCC1062
sytenic fragment plot (Fig. 8). In 28 of 44 cases, syntig coverage of these genes was either entirely or partially absent
(6 and 22 cases respectively), and in cases where sytenous
fragments were present, the coverage is either light, highly
divergent, or both (Fig. 9). These observations indicate
that most of the gene indels found in core regions of the
HTCC1062 and HTCC1002 genomes have a very atypical
appearance in the syntenic fragment plots, in comparison
to most genes found in the core regions of the Pelagibacter
genomes. Some appear to be entirely absent, suggesting
that they might be random gene insertions, while others
are variably present in the metagenomic data. Ka/Ks values for the set of HTCC1002/1062 gene indels that were

variably present indicate that these genes are subject to
purifying selection (Table 4).
Previous studies of E. coli in culture reported a balanced
polymorphism that arose spontaneously and was maintained by selection [30]. The resulting haplotypes
diverged phylogenetically and met Cohan's definition for
ecotypes [31]. Thus, there is precedent that anticipates
balanced polymorphisms in natural microbial populations. We speculate that the gene indels we observed could
be balanced polymorphisms, and that this phenomenon
might explain part of the natural variation in gene content
found in microbial populations.

Gene complement
We were surprised to find no indication of conserved differences in gene complement that would suggest significant physiological differences between the coastal strains
and Sargasso Sea SAR11 populations. This is not to say
that there is not physiological variation within and
between the Sargasso Sea and coastal Oregon SAR11 populations. Rather, we observed no genes thought to control
significant phenotypic attributes in HTCC1002 and
HTCC1062 that were not also well-represented among the
syntenic fragments, and no conserved occurrences of functionally important genes in the SAR11 metagenomic data
that did not have orthologs in the HTCC1062 genome.
We should have seen such genes if they were highly conserved, because our analysis included an average of 118
fragments that covered each end of each gene and provided evidence for the identity of the adjacent gene. Only
19 genes from the HTCC1062 genome are not represented
in the SAR11 metagenome (syntenic fragments or homologous fragments that passed the best BLAST hit test). Of
these, nine are from the hypervariable regions (Table 11),
and six returned no hits to NCBI databases with expect
scores less than 1 × 10-10. Two members of this group
(CDSs 542 and 555) are suspected to be involved in outer

closer homologs to these genes in the Sargasso Sea dataset

Conclusion
The reconstruction of microbial genomes from metagenomic data is a challenge for microbial ecologists, particularly when the genomes originate from large plankton
populations that exhibit inherently high natural variability. Venter attributed the failure to assemble SAR11
genomes for the Sargasso Sea metagenomic data, despite
apparently high coverage, to high species diversity. But, an
alternative explanation is that some genomes are inherently diverse in neutral characteristics because of large
effective population sizes. In such cases, it seems likely
that a linear genome, the objective of assembly, is an
overly simplistic model for representing natural genome
variation. Therefore, we sought a strategy that would
reveal conserved and variable elements of genome struc-

suggesting that genomic properties have had ample time
to diverge in response to selection. We were surprised to
find that there was heavy coverage of most of the genome
by syntenic fragments, suggesting a relatively conserved
gene order in core regions of the genome. Previous reports
have shown that the conservation of gene order between
prokaryotic genomes dissipates faster than protein
sequence identity or gene complement [32,33]. Synteny is
regarded as a rapidly evolving property of genomes, second only to DNA with regulatory functions [34]. Huynen
and coworkers compared orthologs from an evolutionarily diverse set of 9 genomes to show that gene order
becomes nearly random before protein identity decays
below 50% [34].
The seemingly incongruous observation of the preservation of synteny in the presence of 30% divergence in average amino acid sequence can be explained by noting that

Huynen and coworkers studied species that are highly
divergent in functional properties, whereas the SAR11
population appears relatively uniform, despite the accumulation of considerable neutral sequence variation. This
explanation implies that selection is acting to preserve
gene order in SAR11 populations. We speculate that this
may be another example of streamlining selection, in this
case acting to preserve gene order [9].
Rusch et al. [13] reported that synteny was conserved in all
abundant marine prokaryotes, but their method of
observing synteny was qualitative and therefore they did
not offer a quantitative estimate that could be used for
comparative purposes. We provide a quantitative estimate
of synteny and also show that genome rearrangements are
not random, but are concentrated at particular sites,
which are often operon boundaries. This observation has
implications for the "extreme assembly" employed by
Rusch, which has an unproven ability to detect and report
the frequency of genome rearrangements.
The high coverage provided by this dataset enabled us to
examine core regions of the genome for conserved gene
rearrangements, including insertions. Although many
conserved gene rearrangements were observed, none
involved genes acquired by HGT. The approaches we
describe are robust for some conclusions; for example, the
identification of genomic regions that are missing or
highly diverged from the query sequence, and regions,
such as the proteorhodopsin gene locus, where genes and
gene order vary in conserved patterns. There are also caveats. For example, it is likely that only the termini of large
cassettes of inserted genes in the target genomes can be
observed, and then, only where they abut regions of conserved gene order. Thus, the absence of any observations
suggesting conserved insertions of novel genes in the
SAR11 metagenomic data suggests that the Sargasso Sea
SAR11 variants are very similar to their coastal counterparts, in core regions of the genome, but does not rule out
the involvement of HVRs in evolution by gene acquisition.
The concept of the "core" and "pan" genomes is gathering
support as genome sequencing reveals more examples of
conserved core genome regions and hypervariable
regions, or islands of genome variability, as they are sometimes known [3,19]. While the mechanisms that generate
variability in these regions remain poorly understood, it is
increasingly apparent that they often encode niche-specific proteins that are important to competitive success.
Our observations are consistent with the interpretation
that natural selection has concentrated genes that encode
cell surface properties into HVR2, and that this region is
subject to unusually rapid rates of sequence divergence
and re-arrangements of gene order. It has been postulated

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/27

that similar variability in the C. jejuni LPS cassette is an
adaptive response to selection pressure to evade host
acquired immune responses [35]. Viral predation on
microbial cells is intense in the ocean water column and
is likely to provide a keen source of selective pressure that
favors microbial populations with diverse, rapidly evolving surface properties. An analogous variable genome
region containing genes for cell surface components (LPS
cassettes) has been observed in Prochlorococcus sp. [26,36],
and is evident in our syntenic fragment plot for this organism (arrow in Additional file 4B). We propose that the
structural RNA genes flanking the LPS cassettes provide
zones of conserved DNA sequence that promote horizontal exchange of the cassettes by homologous recombination. Multi-locus sequence typing has shown that rates of
intraspecific recombination are high within the coastal
SAR11 population [37]. Alternatively, this variable
genome region could be explained by horizontal gene
transfer from another species, a hypothesis that is consistent with the observation that the AT content of HVR2 is
anomalously high (79%).
To explain the apparent conservation of core genome
regions, and reconcile it with the apparent variability of
SAR11 genomes in nature, we hypothesize that the large
population sizes of SAR11, and the age of these clades that
is inferred from phylogenies, have allowed them to accumulate very extensive variation in genome properties that
are selectively neutral [2]. However, it is clear that our
study offers only a glimpse of the evolution of the SAR11
clade. In particular, the study of genome organization, as
inferred from plots of syntenic fragments and other methods, revealed less about the evolution of SAR11 ecotypes
than did phylogenetic analyses. In part, we attribute this
to a relatively high level of conserved organization in
SAR11 genomes, and the role of hypervariable regions,
which by definition are not amenable to studies based on
the identification of conserved genome features.
An intriguing finding is the correspondence between
"gene indels" in core regions of the two Pelagibacter
genomes, and patterns in the synteny plots from another
ocean. This finding needs further investigation. In part, it
is consistent with the established idea that genes are randomly inserted into genomes at a low frequency, and lost
if not preserved by positive selection [27-29]. But, our
findings suggest that some gene indels might have
another explanation. They could be polymorphisms that
are maintained in populations by processes similar to
those that maintain allelic polymorphisms [30]. The most
appealing approach to resolving this interesting question
would be the sequencing of many genomes from closely
related isolates.

Our findings indicate that SAR11 genomes from different
oceanic provinces share many conserved features despite
dynamic processes of genome change that are at work in
nature. The Sargasso Sea SAR11 populations are conserved in local gene order, and gene complement, with
respect to populations that live in richer, colder coastal
water, but diverge dramatically in amino acid sequence
similarity. A broad implication is that large microbial
populations such as bacterioplankton accumulate high
diversity in some genome properties, while remaining
constrained in others [2]. Protein evolution provides an
analogy. Protein families can encompass wide variation in
amino acid sequences while retaining the key elements of
three-dimensional structure that confer function [38].
Similarly, in old clades that comprise large populations,
microbial genomes may wander over sequence space, giving an illusion of variability, while remaining highly constrained in features that govern cellular structure and
function. An important challenge going forward will be in
establishing quantitative measures that reveal these properties of genome conservation from metagenomic data.

Materials and methods
Phylogenetic analysis
Amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW [39]
(gap open penalty: 100; gap extension penalty: 0.2). Maximum likelihood trees were constructed with RAxML
using the PROTMIXBLOSUM62 amino acid model. Bootstrap values are based on 100 iterations [40].
Homolog search
Fragments carrying genes with high similarity to
HTCC1062 genes are identified at the protein level with
TBLASTN [41], using the amino acid sequence as input, a
1 × 10-10 expect score cutoff, and complexity filtering off.
The results are limited to the first 3,000 hits. Command
line: blastall -i sar11_proteins.fa -d venter_nt -p tblastn -e
'1e-10' -F F -v 3000 -b 3000, where sar11_proteins.fa is a
fasta file of HTCC1062 proteins, venter_nt is the Sargasso
Sea fragment data in BLAST format. Default values were
used for all unnamed parameters, blastall version was
2.2.12. For convenience, the set of fragments identified in
this fashion are hereafter referred to as "homologous fragments".
Syntenic fragment detection
A subset of the homologous fragments that shared synteny with the HTCC1062 genome was identified by finding fragments that were common to the lists from
adjacent HTCC1062 genes, and verifying that the genes
are arranged in tandem on the fragment. Each gene on
these syntenic fragments was subjected to the reciprocal
best-hit test (Fig. 2). The fragment nucleotide sequence of
the high-scoring sequence pair (HSP) from the TBLASTN
search for homologs was searched against the NCBI non-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/27

redundant proteins database using BLASTX. The accession
number of the best hit was compared to the accession
number of the predicted HTCC1062 gene to confirm the
identity of the reciprocal best hit. The term "syntenic fragment" thus designates fragments containing at least two
best-hitting HTCC1062 genes in the proper order, but
does not itself indicate anything about the rest of the fragment, for instance the presence of genes without
homologs in HTCC1062.
Syntenic fragment plots with different query genomes
To assess the selectivity of syntenic fragments we studied
a set of organisms of varying relevance to ocean surface
ecology. Of these, Procholorococcus marinus MED4 provides an example from a clade that is relatively abundant
in the Sargasso Sea but forms a shallow cluster by 16S
rRNA gene sequence analysis [42]. Escherichia coli was
chosen as an organism that is unlikely to appear often in
the Sargasso Sea. Five additional cultured marine strains
were also used as query genomes. They are listed in Table
2. We found that the syntenic fragment plots are characteristic for each group, and the numbers of syntenic fragments in the plots correlates with the abundance of each
organism's 16S rRNA genes in the metagenomic data
(Additional file 4). For each selected organism, the relative abundance of genomic DNA within the Sargasso Sea
metagenome is estimated by the number of 16S rRNA
fragments satisfying identity thresholds of 97%, 93%, and
90%. These values are shown as insets in Additional file 4.
The number of syntenic fragments recovered for each
organism correlates with the number of similar 16S rRNA
genes. The most abundant organism, SAR11, produced by
far the most syntenic fragments (71,696) while P. marinus
returned an intermediate number (8,398). Other organisms (e.g. C. atlanticus in Table 2 and Additional file 4)
that are virtually undetectable by 16S rRNA analysis
returned a number of syntenic fragments (1258) similar
to our negative control E. coli (406). Additional file 3
shows the distribution of syntenic fragments recovered for
E. coli.

If the syntenic fragment detection process described here
accurately recovers environmental fragments arising from
a given template organism, then the list of syntenic fragments should be unique for each organism. Thus, to estimate the selectivity of our method we compared the
syntenic fragment lists of all organisms tested. The percentage of syntenic fragments unique to each organism
(Table 2) is 98.8 % for HTCC1062 and 99.0 % for P. marinus. Less-abundant organisms have as few as 30% unique
syntenic fragments, but not in all cases. In numbers, the
low abundance organisms are not distinguishable from
each other or E. coli, though other marine microbes show
a narrower, more distinct syntenic fragment pattern than
E. coli, similar to Additional file 4C (data not shown).

Genome rearrangements and operon prediction
To find fragments containing HTCC1062 genes in altered
gene orders, the genes on the homologous fragments that
did not show synteny to HTCC1062 were subjected to the
best BLAST analysis described above for the syntenic fragments. The number of occurrences of a given best-hitting
HTCC1062 gene adjacent to a non-syntenic best-hitting
HTCC1062 gene was determined, scoring the number of
times any unique pair of genes occurred together.

To determine if genome rearrangements are concentrated
at operon boundaries, a statistical analysis was performed
comparing the number of gene pairs found that violate
operon boundaries (disallowed pairs; n = 1301), to the
number found that preserve operon boundaries (allowed
pairs; n = 2131). A maximum likelihood estimator was
used to calculate the probability that this observation
could be due to chance, assuming the rearrangements at
gene boundaries follow a normal distribution. The list of
predicted operons for P. ubique HTCC1062 was obtained
via the ENTREZ Genome Project [21].
Hypervariable regions
Site-specific recombination mediated by integrases has
been shown to cause rapid change in some islands of
genomic variability [24]. However, SAR11, as with most
examples thus analyzed [43], failed to display clear signatures of the integron model – attC sites were not found
associated with any of the HVRs. HVR2 includes an integrase gene, and HVR4 is flanked by tRNA genes, which
have been shown to serve as site-specific recombination
sites for temperate phages and transmissible plasmids
[44].

Comparison of the genomes of strains HTCC1062 and
HTCC1002 provides evidence that the 23S and 5S rRNA
genes flanking HVR2 are sites of homologous recombination that allow novel variations of the LPS region to
spread rapidly within populations. The HVR2 regions in
these two genomes are 99.96% similar in nucleotide
sequence, compared to 97.4% similarity for the genomes
overall. In addition to few point mutations, the two HVR2
sequences differ by a deletion of 13 nucleotides that
removes one from a set of four tandem repeats within a
hypothetical gene.
In contrast, the HVR1 regions of HTCC1062 and
HTCC1002 reveal the loss and gain of divergent, tandem
duplicated genes. One gene is deleted from a set of four
tandem, divergent gene duplications of Type V secretion
proteins in strain HTCC1062 (Fig. 7). In strain
HTCC1002, a single ammonium transporter gene is
deleted from two, tandem duplicated genes. A high proportion of hypothetical genes, such as we found in the
SAR11 hypervariable regions, is a general feature of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/27

genome islands. While phages are suspected to be the reservoir for this novel gene pool [43] direct evidence for this
hypothesis remains elusive. Daubin and Ochman
reported that E. coli hypothetical genes are short, AT rich,
and most likely originate from phage [45]. The evidence
for rapid gene evolution by duplication, divergence,
domain rearrangements and deletion observed in HVR1
could also be explained by the alternative hypothesis that
genetic processes intrinsic to the cell cause at least some of
the rapid change in the SAR11 HVRs.
Tests for selection
Sequences were analyzed for synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates using the software program
SWAAP 1.0.2 [46], set to the Li method (1993) with a window size of 90 and step size of 18. The values reported in
Table 2 were created from alignments that include those
portions of the HTCC1062 gene and syntenic fragment
sequence defined by the HSP start and end positions
taken from the TBLASTN results (see homolog detection
step). Translated sequence was used to guide the alignments when necessary. Nucleotide divergence values were
calculated with the software program DnaSP 4.0 using the
'synonymous non-synonymous substitution' option
under the analysis menu with default parameters [47].
Searching for genes conserved in Sargasso Sea SAR11
populations and not found in the genomes of the coastal
isolates
Non-homologous genes found alongside genes that had
best hits to HTCC1062 genes were regarded as candidates
for genes specific to the Sargasso Sea SAR11 populations.
The amino acid sequence of each CDS (the determination
of open reading frames on the environmental fragments
was taken from the conserved domain feature tags of the
NCBI GenBank record) on every homologous fragment
with sufficient length to include non-HTCC1062
homologs was used as a BLAST query sequence against the
NCBI non-redundant proteins database (BLASTP, expect
score cutoff 1 × 10-6) and the NCBI Conserved Domain
Database (CDD) [48]. We examined the data for the frequency of any specific non-HTCC1062 gene occurring
next to a given HTCC1062 gene, using the gene descriptions from the NCBI database as well as the protein family
identifier from the CDD as search strings for the identification of common genes.
Calculating a synteny index
We define a synteny index to be the fraction of best-hitting
HTCC1062 homologs found adjacent to a best-hitting
and syntenic HTCC1062 homolog. The amino acid
sequence of each CDS on all homologous fragments carrying at least two genes (238,663 of 349,742 total, Table
1) was queried against the NCBI non-redundant proteins
database. For every best-hitting gene on the fragment, if at

Page 15 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:27

least one best-hitting neighbor was present, it was
counted as a syntenic observance. To calculate the synteny
index the total of all syntenic observances is divided by
the total observances of best hitting genes, syntenic and
non-syntenic.
Genes conserved in the coastal isolates but not found in
the Sargasso Sea SAR11 populations
HTCC1062 genes that were not represented among the set
of homologous fragments identified in the Sargasso Sea
dataset by TBLASTN were considered as candidates for
genes specific to the coastal ecotypes (Pelagibacter). The
translation products of these CDS were used as queries in
a TBLASTN search of the Sargasso Sea dataset and the
NCBInr database, using an expect score cutoff of 10. The
highest scores found for these 19 genes are listed in Table
11. Three CDS (414, 788 and 875) failed to hit the
NCBInr database with an expect score of less than 1 × e-4
and are classified as hypothetical proteins in the
HTCC1062 genome.

Reviewer's comments
Reviewer's report 1
Eugene Koonin, National Center for Biotechnology Information,
Bethesda, MD
This is quite an exciting study that makes an extensive use
of metagenomic data to assess the natural variability of
Pelagibacter (SAR11), apparently, the most abundant
marine bacterium. Pelagibacter seems to break the trend
that, previously, seemed consistent in all compared
prokaryotic genomes, namely, that gene order evolves
faster than sequence (at least, coding sequence). It is reasonably proposed that the high effective population size
of Pelagibacter leads to rapid accumulation of neutral
substitutions. It is further proposed that purifying selection acts to maintain the gene order in Pelagibacter and
that this is somehow related to genome streamlining. The
connection seems pretty mysterious but, at face value, it is
hard to deny that, at the time scale when many substitutions accumulate, genome rearrangements do not. An
explicit population-genetic analysis of this discrepancy

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/27

would be interesting but one needs a good model for
genome rearrangements, of course.
There seems to be striking analogy between the hypervariable regions in Pelagibacter discovered here and pathegenicity islands in bacterial pathogens, e.g., E. coli. I think
it is worth more emphasis.
It will be very revealing to see whether these findings
smoothly extend to other marine bacteria such as Prochlorocccus, and whether the population-genetic explanation
holds compared to the available abundance data. I actually suspect that the data is there for such a comparison to
be done right now but, certainly, that can be done in a
new paper, the present one stands on its own.

Tennessee – Oak Ridge National Laboratory
This study aims at evaluating metagenomics data on the
most abundant marine proteobacteria, SAR11, by comparing it with available whole genome data of the SAR11
strains. The overarching goal is to understand the nature
of species and ecotypes in SAR11 populations. A more
specific aim was to assess trends in the SAR11 genome
evolution by determining the core genome and variable
regions.

One of the main results of this study is a quantitative estimate of synteny and a demonstration that genome rearrangements in SAR11 are not random, but are
concentrated at particular sites, which are often operon
boundaries.
On a broader scale, this work presents an approach, which
is general enough to be applied to other metagenomic
data sets in order to study evolutionary trends in natural
microbial populations.
I don't have any major concerns regarding this paper. It
reads well and I found it quite interesting for a non-specialist in microbial ecology and metagenomics. I would
definitely recommend it to anyone who is seriously thinking about deriving information from the metagenomics
data sets.

tion and evolution of Pelagibacter/SAR11, probably the
most abundant marine bacterium.

A number of trends could be observed, some are similar
to studies in other phyla, some are different; so the paper
also adds in general terms to our understanding of bacterial populations and the impact of habitats on their evolution.

Interestingly, it is proposed that gene order seems to surprisingly evolve slower than sequence and which is
explained partially by the large population size. I assume
that for the more detailed Quantification of this observation more data will be needed, but the approach demonstrates the power of integrating metagenomics data in
genome analysis.

Syntenic fragments carrying at least three genes. A large portion of the
syntenic fragments are not of sufficient length to carry more than three
genes. These data show that the general trends of genome coverage and
range of amino-acid level identity shown in Fig. 3D hold when the shorter
fragments are excluded.

The quantification of the non-random accumulation of
mutations along the genome is another interesting aspect
worth noting as is a surprizngingly high number of core
genes (or relative little indels) given the many individuals
from which sequence fragments were available.
