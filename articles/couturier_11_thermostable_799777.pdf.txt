impact of its atypical multimodularity on activity

Abstract
Background: The gene encoding an atypical multi-modular glycoside hydrolase family 45 endoglucanase bearing
five different family 1 carbohydrate binding modules (CBM1), designated PpCel45A, was identified in the Pichia
pastoris GS115 genome.
Results: PpCel45A (full-length open reading frame), and three derived constructs comprising (i) the catalytic
module with its proximal CBM1, (ii) the catalytic module only, and (iii) the five CBM1 modules without catalytic
module, were successfully expressed to high yields (up to 2 grams per litre of culture) in P. pastoris X33. Although
the constructs containing the catalytic module displayed similar activities towards a range of glucans, comparison
of their biochemical characteristics revealed striking differences. We observed a high thermostability of PpCel45A
(Half life time of 6 h at 80°C), which decreased with the removal of CBMs and glycosylated linkers. However, both
binding to crystalline cellulose and hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose and cellohexaose were substantially boosted
by the presence of one CBM rather than five.
Conclusions: The present study has revealed the specific features of the first characterized endo b-1,4 glucanase
from yeast, whose thermostability is promising for biotechnological applications related to the saccharification of
lignocellulosic biomass such as consolidated bioprocessing.
Keywords: biomass, crystalline cellulose, cellulase, Pichia pastoris, thermostable GH45 endoglucanase

Background
Lignocellulosic biomass is the largest renewable source of
carbohydrates for the production of biofuels, biomaterials,
and high-value products but its recalcitrance to enzymatic
degradation makes industrial processes complex and costly
[1,2]. The main component of plant cell wall is cellulose, a
linear polymer of b-1,4 linked glucose units. Cellulose
chains are arranged in linear microfibrils that form very
recalcitrant crystalline-like structures, and form a tight
complex with varying proportions of hemicellulose and lignin [3]. The hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose monomers
requires the coordinated action of several types of complementary enzymes: endoglucanases (endo-b-1,4-glucanases,
EC 3.2.1.4) randomly cleaving glycosidic bonds on cellulose
polymers, cellobiohydrolases (cellulose b-1,4-cellobiosidases, EC 3.2.1.94) sequentially releasing cellobiose from

cellulose chain ends, and b-glucosidases (b-1,4-glucosidases, EC 3.2.1.21) converting cellobiose into glucose
monomers [4]. More recently, other types of enzymes, e.g.
GH61, have been reported as able to enhance the conversion of cellulose when used in conjunction with a cellulase
or a mixture of cellulases [5]. They may contribute to cellulose degradation using a different mode of action [6].
Among the 128 glycoside hydrolases (GHs) families
(CAZy - [7,8]), fungal endoglucanases are grouped, along
with other enzymes, into 8 GH families, including GH5,
GH6, GH7, GH9, GH12, GH45, GH48, and GH74. Family
GH45 endoglucanases are distantly related to plant expansins and found in a broad range of organisms including
bacteria, plants, animals, and fungi. They are characterized
by a low molecular weight and an inverting stereochemical
mechanism [9], and usually produce cello-oligosaccharides
as end-products from cellulose substrates without any glucose release as reported for endoglucanases belonging to
other families [10].

Many glycoside hydrolases modular enzymes, where
catalytic and non catalytic modules may be separated by
linkers, are often highly glycosylated in fungi [11]. Carbohydrate binding modules (CBM), able to bind one or several type of polysaccharides, are found among the noncatalytic modules. The sugar-binding activity of CBMs
increases the enzyme concentration in the vicinity of the
substrates, leading to a more effective hydrolysis [12]. It
has also been suggested that CBMs could play a role in
the degradation of polysaccharides via a destructurative
action on the substrate fibrils [13,14]. Amongst the 64
CBMs families classified in CAZy, CBM1s are almost
exclusively found in fungi and specifically bind crystalline
cellulose. They are characterized by the prevalence of
aromatic amino acid residues in the binding surface that
forms a platform-like architecture [15]. This planar organization of the binding site is thought to be complementary to the flat surfaces presented by cellulose crystals.
CBMs can be localized at the N- or C-terminal end of
the catalytic module alone or in multiple organizations
[16]. The presence of multiple CBMs in a glycoside
hydrolase is usually found in bacteria, such as in the aamylase from Lactobacillus amylovorus that contains five
CBM26 arranged in tandem [17]. To our knowledge, the
only example of a characterized eukaryotic GH carrying
multiple CBM1s modules is a GH45 endoglucanase from
Mucor circinelloides which bears two CBM1 [18].
Upon analysis of the recently sequenced Pichia pastoris
GS115 genome [19], we have identified an intriguing modular family 45 endoglucanase containing five different
CBM1 modules arranged in tandem at the N-terminus.
To investigate the role played by these multiple CBMs in
the hydrolysis of cellulose, we homologously expressed the
full length endoglucanase and three truncated derivatives,
and further characterized them biochemically to evaluate
their potential as tools for cellulose conversion.

Results
Bioinformatic analysis of PpCel45A

PpCel45A is a 1,845 bp gene (defined as [Genbank:
PAS_chr4_0643]) containing no identified introns that
encodes five N-terminal CBM1 modules and one Cterminal family 45 endoglucanase module (Figure 1). The
six modules are separated by linkers carrying numerous
potential O-glycosylation sites (Ser and Thr). Comparison of the five amino-acid CBM1 sequences revealed that
they were all different with a maximum identity of 91%
between CBM1-1 and CBM1-2 and a minimum identity
of 41% between CBM1-2 and CBM1-3 (Figure 2). Interestingly, the result of BLAST searches showed that
PpCel45A is the first endo b-1,4 glucanase identified in
ascomycete yeast. The X33 strain is derived from the
GS115 strain and we suggest that it probably also contains PpCel45A, as does the P. pastoris CBS 7435 strain

that was also sequenced recently. However, to our knowledge other Pichia strains (e.g. P. stipitis CBS 6054) do not
have any family 45 endoglucanase. The P. pastoris GS115
GH45 module sequence was distantly related to T. reesei
family 45 endoglucanase V/Cel45a (17% amino-acid identity) but had high identity with endo-ß-1,4-glucanases
from the Mucorales order. Indeed, a phylogenetic analysis of 55 fungal GH45 was performed and revealed that
PpCel45A and Mucorales GH45 are grouped together
with P. equi Cel45A in GH45 subfamily A (Figure 3),
whereas T. reesei Cel45a belongs to subfamily B. The
high similarity between PpCel45A, P. equi Cel45A and
Mucorales GH45 suggests that PpCel45A as well as
P. equi Cel45A may have been acquired by horizontal
gene transfer events. Horizontal gene transfer events
have been described as common among the anaerobic
fungi of the rumen [20], but to our knowledge such
events have not been described between fungi and yeasts
(Saccharomycetales).
Cloning, expression, and purification of PpCel45A and
derived constructs in P. pastoris

The DNA sequences encoding either the entire P. pastoris
PpCel45A (full-length open reading frame) and three truncated derivatives, PpCBM15:GH (catalytic module with its
proximal CBM1), PpGH (catalytic module), and
PpCBM11-5 (five CBM1 modules without catalytic module) (Figure 1) were amplified by PCR using genomic
DNA from P. pastoris GS115. Each sequence was inserted
into the P. pastoris expression vector pPICZaA, in frame
with the yeast a-factor secretion peptide and a (His)6 tag
located at the C-terminus, and under the control of the
AOX1 promoter as described in Materials and Methods.
Full-length protein and truncated proteins were all
successfully expressed in P. pastoris X33, i.e. they were
visualized in the supernatant after 3-days induction using
SDS-PAGE, indicating correct processing of the a-factor
signal sequence. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that expression yield reached up to 2 g per litre of culture (data not
shown). Only traces of endogenous proteins were detected
in the culture supernatants of transformants (data not
shown). Each selected transformant was scaled-up to
increase the production of each recombinant protein.
Purification was performed by affinity chromatography,
taking advantage of C-term (His)6 tags. High production
and purification yields were obtained with up to 250 mg of
purified protein per litre of induced culture after three
days induction (Table 1).
Biochemical characterization

The four purified recombinant proteins were analyzed
on SDS-PAGE for assessment of apparent molecular
weight (Figure 4, Table 1). They displayed apparent
molecular weights higher than the theoretical ones,

probably resulting from post-translational modifications
[21]. PpCBM11-5 displayed no enzymatic activity under
all the conditions tested. Apparent optimum pH and
temperature were determined on PpCel45A, PpGH, and
PpCBM1 5 :GH. All three exhibited the same pH and
temperature profile with an optimum pH at 4.8 and
more than 50% activity between pH 3 and 8. Their optimum temperature was 65°C, with more than 50% activity between 30°C and 70°C (Table 1). Thermal stability
was also evaluated on the three constructions at 65°C
and 80°C. (Table 1 Figure 5). It revealed that PpCel45A
was stable up to 80°C with a residual activity of 70%
and 60% after 48 hours at 65°C and 4 hours at 80°C,
respectively. PpGH was less stable with 9% activity
retained after 48 hours at 65°C and 6% after 4 hours at
80°C. PpCBM15:GH was more stable than PpGH with
respectively 51% and 45% residual activity after 48 hours
at 65°C and 4 hours at 80°C, respectively.
Catalytic properties of PpCel45A

The four constructions were evaluated for their ability to
degrade a wide range of cellulosic and hemicellulosic

substrates (Table 2). Although PpCBM11-5 had no detectable activity towards the substrates tested, the three other
constructions (PpGH, PpCBM15:GH, PpCel45A) displayed
similar activities towards soluble cellulose derivatives
(CMC and HEC), b-1,3/b-1,4 glucans (b-glucan and lichenan), and one hemicellulolytic substrate (konjac glucomannan), the highest activity being obtained using
lichenan. However, no activity was detected using pNPCel, pNP-Lac, pNP-Glu, filter paper, mannan, and chitin,
even after extensive hydrolysis. Avicel hydrolysis was performed for 16 hours at 45°C or 65°C (Figure 6). PpCBM115
displayed no activity towards Avicel. PpGH, PpCBM15:
GH, and PpCel45A hydrolyzed Avicel significantly and
more efficiently at 65°C, yielding specific activities of 3.8,
8.4 and 5.5 U/μmol. There was no improvement of Avicel
hydrolysis using equimolar amount of PpGH and
PpCBM11-5 compared to PpGH alone. Although no difference was observed between PpCel45A and PpGH at 45°C,
PpCel45A was 1.5-fold more active than PpGH at 65°C.
Surprisingly, PpCBM15:GH was significantly more active
than PpGH and PpCel45A on Avicel both at 45°C and
65°C.

Analysis of end products

To evaluate the mode of action of P. pastoris endoglucanase, the soluble sugars generated upon hydrolysis of
either crystalline cellulose, soluble cellulose or cello-oligosaccharides by the three active recombinant constructions
were determined by anion exchange chromatography. The
products formed upon hydrolysis of polymeric substrates
(Avicel and CMC) were analyzed, showing similar product
patterns for the three enzymes, i.e. the oligo-saccharides
G4, G3, and G2 were produced in the first minutes of the
reaction. Toward the end of the reaction, cellobiose (G2)

and cellotriose (G3) were the main products detected
(data not shown). Upon hydrolysis of soluble cellulose
(CMC), the three enzymes yielded similar amounts of
oligo-saccharides at the end of the reaction. However,
when crystalline cellulose (as in Avicel) was used as a substrate, PpCel45A released two times more end-products
than PpGH, and CBM1 5 :GH almost three times more
than PpGH. The products formed upon hydrolysis of cellohexaose (G6), cellopentaose (G5), and cellotetraose (G4)
were also analyzed. The three enzymes showed similar
hydrolytic patterns towards cello-oligosaccharides. G6 was

G3, and G5 was degraded to form exclusively G3 and G2.
G4 was hydrolyzed to produce exclusively G2 but with a
lower rate that circumvented the determination of the catalytic efficiency. Neither PpCel45A nor their truncated

derivatives showed detectable hydrolysis on cellotriose.
Initial rate data from hydrolyses of G6 and G5 at 40°C and
pH 4.8 indicated that the catalytic efficiency (kcat /Km )
increased with increasing chain length (Table 3). It is
interesting to note that PpCBM15:GH catalytic efficiency
towards G6 was significantly higher compared to PpGH
and PpCel45A.
Substrate binding capacities of PpCel45A and derived
constructs

The ability of PpCel45A and its respective constructs
to bind crystalline cellulose was investigated. Binding
to Avicel was observed for PpCel45A, PpCBM1 1-5 ,
PpCBM1 5 :GH, but not for PpGH. Based on typical
double-reciprocal plots, binding parameters were
determined for the three constructions, yielding K d
values of 0.45, 0.78, and 0.95 for PpCBM1 1-5 ,
PpCel45A, PpCBM1 5 :GH, respectively (Table 4). The
Bmax value of PpCBM15 :GH (0.80 μmol per g of substrate) was 4 times higher compared to PpCBM1 1-5
and PpCel45A (0.19 and 0.20 μmol per g of substrate,
respectively).

Discussion
Several family 45 endoglucanases have been characterized in the last years from fungi [9,22], bacteria [23], or
animals [24]. However, to our knowledge the present
study is the first report on the characterization of a
GH45 from yeast. Since P. pastoris GS115 growth on
cellulose as a sole carbon source was very limited, the

function and origin of such an endoglucanase in yeast
remains enigmatic and could be the result of a horizontal transfer from Mucorales. Since P. pastoris X33 has
been proven to be an ideal host for the production of
eukaryotic glycosidases [25-27], we successfully used it
for homologous expression of PpCel45A and three truncated derivatives. The four proteins were successfully
produced with high yields and purified in one step thus
allowing their in depth characterization.
The highest specific activity displayed by the three active
derivatives of PpCel45A was obtained toward lichenan,
which has also been described as the best substrate for
other GH45, as PcCel45A from Phanerochaete chrysosporium [28] or Bx-ENG-1, -2 and -3 from the pine wood
nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus [29]. Although
chitin and cellulose structures are similar, no activity of
PpCel45A was detected toward chitin. Hydrolysis experiments using mannan and glucomannan revealed that
PpCel45A was not capable to hydrolyze the b-1,4 linkages

between mannosyl residues. However it hydrolyzed efficiently glucomannan suggesting that part of b-1,4 linkages
found between mannose and glucose residues were efficiently hydrolysed. PpCel45A revealed typical classical
endoglucanase features, i.e. efficient hydrolysis of soluble
celluloses derivatives (CMC and HEC), slow hydrolysis of
crystalline cellulose forms (Avicel) and no hydrolysis of
pNP-Cel, rather than processive features. Although it has
been suggested that carbohydrate binding modules could
play a role in the destructuration of cellulose [14],
PpCBM11-5 displayed no identified activity toward any of
the polysaccharides tested. Furthermore, the number of
CBMs of P. pastoris endoglucanase did not influence the
activity of PpCel45A on soluble substrates, in good agreement with Baba et al. [18].
The patterns of CMC, Avicel, and cello-oligosaccharides
hydrolysis end products were similar for the three constructions. The major CMC end products were cellobiose
and cellotriose, with trace amounts of glucose produced at
the end of the reaction, as reported for the endoglucanase
from Penicillium decumbens [22] but different from T. reesei Cel45A (EG V) that produced only trace of cellobiose
from CMC [10]. The major Avicel end products were also
cellobiose, cellotriose, and trace amounts of glucose, but
the amounts of end products released varied depending
on the enzyme component. PpCBM15:GH was therefore
more efficient than PpCel45A, which was more efficient
than PpGH. No glucose was released from any of the oligosaccharides tested, confirming the endo mode of action
of PpCel45A. End products profiles from hydrolyzed cellooligosaccharides were in good agreement with previous
studies [30,31] and suggest an organization of the catalytic
site in six subsites. This hypothesis is strengthened by the

crystal structure of Humicola insolens GH45 [9] that
revealed six subsites in the active site, with an organization
from -4 to +2 [32].
Thermostable hemicellulases and cellulases are gaining
interest because they are well suited for harsh industrial
process conditions [33]. Several thermostable endoglucanases have already been isolated from thermotolerant or
thermophilic organisms like the GH45 endoglucanase
from Syncephalastrum racemosum [34] and the Cel5A
endoglucanase from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis
[35]. Compared to other thermostable endoglucanases,
PpCel45A thermal properties were remarkable since
P. pastoris is a mesophilic organism. We observed that the
high thermostability of PpCel45A (t 1/2 of 6 h at 80°C)
decreased with the removal of CBMs and glycosylated linkers (t1/2 of 3.8 h for PpCBM15:GH and t1/2 of 3.2 h for
PpGH). Controversial data are reported in the literature
about factors affecting GH thermostability. The comparison of catalytic module alone with catalytic module fused
to CBM showed either improvement of thermostability
[36], or on the contrary appeared to have a negative
impact [37]. In our study, results strongly suggest that the
presence of linkers and CBMs is responsible for the protection of PpCel45A catalytic module against thermal
denaturation.
Removal of CBM moieties from cellulases or hemicellulases generally reduces their hydrolytic activity on insoluble substrates, whereas their activity remains unchanged
on soluble substrates [38,39]. In this study, we have shown
that the presence of five CBMs in PpCel45A was not an
advantage for crystalline cellulose binding and hydrolysis.
Instead of diminishing catalytic module capacities, the
deletion of four CBMs favoured endoglucanase activity, as
shown by the measurement of (i) specific activities, (ii)
end-products formation, and (iii) binding parameters. The
deletion of the five CBMs diminished the catalytic properties of P. pastoris endoglucanase only at 65°C, which is
probably the consequence of a lower thermostability of
PpCel45A. Molecular modeling of individual CBMs
showed that all of them share similar conformation with a
flat surface containing the three key aromatic residues
involved in crystalline cellulose binding (not shown).
Thus, the presence of these five CBMs appended to the
catalytic module of P. pastoris endoglucanase remains

enigmatic. Our hypothesis is that the steric hindrance of
five CBMs could prevent the exhibition of the flat surface
required for interaction with cellulose chains, limiting
enzyme action. Upon deletion of four CBMs, the enzyme
probably recovers an extended conformation due to the
remaining glycosylated linker, thus more adapted to efficient degradation of crystalline cellulose.
The present study has revealed the specific features of
the first characterized endo b-1,4 glucanase natively issued
from yeast (Saccharomycetales order). The thermostability
properties of this endoglucanase could be of great interest
for lignocellulosic biomass applications related to the saccharification and fermentation processes. In these industrial processes aiming at decreasing conversion cost, a
high dry matter content is necessary. Integration of a high
temperature pre-hydrolysis step in the process sequence
leading to rapid liquefaction is an attractive way to overcome the problems associated with high initial solids, i.e.
poor mixing and mass transfer, high viscosity [33]. In
these processes, high temperature enzymatic liquefaction
is necessary as a pre-hydrolysis step to decrease viscosity
and requires thermostable (hemi)cellulases. Endoglucanases were shown to have a superior ability to rapidly
reduce the viscosity of pretreated wheat straw [40]. The
high thermostability of PpCel45A would be an appropriate
tool for an application in such process. Consolidated bioprocessing is also an approach developed for competitive
production of soluble sugars from lignocellulosic biomass
in which the hydrolytic enzymes are simultaneously produced in situ by the fermentative microorganism [41]. The
dominant strategy for engineering an efficient biocatalyst
is to express cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes in
Saccharomyces cerevisae, but expression of fungal and bacterial genes in S. cerevisiae has some limitations [42]. The
utilization of enzymes from yeast such as P. pastoris endoglucanase, could also be a promising way to optimize the
ethanol production process without the addition of exogenous enzymes.

carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na, medium viscosity),
hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), Avicel PH101, chitin, 4nitrophenyl b-D-glucopyranose (pNP-glu), 4-nitrophenyl
b-D-cellobioside (pNP-cel), and 4-nitrophenyl b-D-lactopyranose (pNP-lac) were purchased from Sigma
(Lyon, France). Barley b-glucan, lichenan, Konjac glucomannan (KGM), mannan, and cello-oligosaccharides
ranging from 3 to 6 residues (G3-G6) were purchased
from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland). Walseth cellulose
was provided by N. Lopes-Ferreira (IFPEN, Paris,
France).
Bioinformatics analysis

The catalytic domain of 55 modularly annotated fungal
members of family GH45 was extracted from the CAZy
database (September 2011, [8]). All sequence alignments
were performed with the multiple sequence alignment
program MUSCLE v3.7 [43] under default conditions.
Using an in-house modified version of Jalview [44], we
calculated a maximum-likelihood distance matrix using
the JTT matrix [45] and submitted it to hierarchical clustering using the Ward method [46]. The figure was edited
using Dendroscope 2.6.1. [47].
Culture of P. pastoris GS115 on Walseth cellulose plates

P. pastoris GS115 was grown overnight at 30°C on agar
plates containing minimal agar medium supplemented
with either 2% dextrose or 6% walseth cellulose.
Construction of expression plasmids

Genomic DNA was purified from P. pastoris GS115 using
NucleoSpin® Plant II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The DNA sequence [Genbank:PAS_chr4_0643]
corresponding to [Genbank:CAY71902] was amplified by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers
(Table 5). EcoRI and XbaI restrictions sites were introduced respectively at the 5’ and 3’ end of the amplified
fragments. DNA amplification was carried out with
Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Applied Science,
Meylan, France) through 35 cycles of denaturation (20
seconds at 94°C), annealing (40 seconds at 55°C), and

elongation (2 minutes at 72°C). DNA fragments were
sub-cloned into pCRII-TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen,
Cergy-Pontoise, France) and transformed into E. coli
DH5a competent cells (One shot chemically competent
DH5a, Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Recombinant plasmids were purified (Wizard plus
SV miniprep kit, Promega Charbonnières, France) and
sequenced. Amplified fragments were digested by EcoRI
and XbaI and ligated to the EcoRI-XbaI digested pPICZaA vector (Invitrogen), in frame with both the a-factor
and C-term-(His)6-tag encoding sequences. The resulting
recombinant expression plasmids were linearized with
PmeI and transformed into P. pastoris X-33 by electroporation as described in Couturier et al, 2011. The transformants were selected on YPDS plates (1% yeast extract,
2% peptone, 2% glucose, 1 M sorbitol, 2% agar) containing zeocin concentrations varying from 100 to 1000 μg/
ml. After three days at 30°C, zeocin-resistant P. pastoris
transformants were screened for methanol utilization
(MutS phenotype) on MD (3.4% YNB, 1% ammonium sulphate, 2% glucose, 0.4 μg/ml D-biotin, 2% agar) and MM
(3.4% YNB, 1% ammonium sulphate, 0.4 μg/ml D-biotin,
0.5% agar) plates. 10 MutS colonies were used for protein
expression as follows: cultures were carried out in 10 ml
BMGY (phosphate buffer 100 mM pH6, 1% yeast extract,
2% peptone, 3.4% YNB, 1% ammonium sulphate, 1% glycerol, 0.4 μg/ml D-biotin) in 50 ml loosely capped tubes
at 30°C and shaked at 200 rpm, and expression was
induced by transferring the cells into 2 ml BMMY (phosphate buffer 100 mM pH6, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone,
3.4% YNB, 1% ammonium sulphate, 0.4 μg/ml D-biotin,
3% v/v methanol). The medium was supplemented daily
with 3% methanol, and after 4 days the cultures were centrifuged and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to
select the best transformant for each enzyme.
Recombinant enzyme production and purification

For each enzyme, large-scale production (2 litres) was performed in 500 ml baffled flasks, each containing 100 ml of
BMGY medium. Cells were grown overnight at 30°C and
200 rpm, and recovered by centrifugation the following
day. Pellets were pooled and resuspended in 400 ml
(100 ml of BMMY in 500 ml flasks), and induction was
carried out for 4 days. Supernatant was then collected and
processed as described in [27]. It was filtered through
0.2 μm membranes (Durapore GV membrane filters,
0.22 μm, Millipore, Molsheim, France), and concentrated
(Vivaspin 10 kDa, PES, Sartorius, Palaiseau, France). A
nickel chelate (GE Healthcare, Buc, France) column (His
trap HP column, GE Healthcare, 0.7 cm × 5 cm) was connected to a FPLC Äkta (GE Healthcare) and equilibrated
with the equilibration buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.8,
NaCl 150 mM, imidazole 10 mM) before purification. The
concentrated supernatant was diluted in the equilibration

Couturier et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:103
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/103

buffer and loaded onto the column at 4°C. The enzyme
was eluted with Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.8, NaCl 150 mM,
imidazole 150 mM, and the eluate was concentrated and
dialysed with 50 mM sodium acetate buffer pH5 as
described in [27].
Biochemical characterization

SDS-PAGE was performed in 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide
gels (Bio-Rad, Marne-la-coquette, France) using a Pharmacia LMW electrophoresis calibration kit (GE Healthcare).
Proteins were detected by staining the gel with Coomassie
blue. Protein concentrations were determined by the
Folin-Lowry method [48] using Folin Ciocalteu’s phenol
reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and bovine serum albumin as a
standard.
Enzymatic activity assays

Unless otherwise indicated, assay mixtures were prepared
in citrate phosphate buffer pH 4.8. The activities of
enzymes towards different cellulose derivatives (CMC,
HEC, Avicel, Walseth cellulose) and complex polysaccharides (barley b-glucan, lichenan, chitin, Konjac glucomannan and mannan) were determined. All substrates
excepting chitin were purchased as powders. To determine
the activity towards chitin, dry chips of substrate were
ground using a cutting mill (A11 cutting mill, IKA-Werke,
Staufe, Germany) and further comminuted using a ballmill grinder (MM 400, Retsch, Haan, Germany). A 0.2
mm selection screen was used to collect the finest fraction.
To determine specific activity towards the various substrates, the DNS method was used as described in [49].
Briefly, 100 μl of suitably diluted enzyme (2 μg of
PpCBM11-5 or equimolar amounts of PpGH, PpCBM15:
GH, and PpCel45A) were mixed with 100 μl of 2% substrate in 50 mM citrate phosphate buffer pH 4.8, or 100 μl
buffer containing one disk of filter paper Whatman n°1.
The reactions mixtures were incubated at 45°C for various
time lengths. The reaction was terminated by the addition
of 300 μl 1% w/v dinitrosalicylic reagent, and samples
were heated at 95°C for 10 minutes. The reaction mixtures
were cooled at room temperature, and 80 μl were transferred to a microtiter plate. Reducing sugar release was
determined by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm, and a
glucose standard curve (0 to 10 mM) was used to calculate
the release of sugars. One unit of enzyme was defined as
the amount of protein releasing 1 μmol of sugar per minute. To take the different size of the four constructions
into account, we chose to express our specific activities as
U per μmol enzyme or U per nmol enzyme. Activity
towards pNPCel, pNPLac, and pNPGlu was determined by
measuring the release of p-nitrophenol in 50 mM citrate
phosphate buffer, pH 4.8 after 2 hours incubation at 45°C.
Either 2 μg of PpCBM1 1-5 or equimolar amounts of
PpGH, PpCBM15:GH, and PpCel45A were used in a final

Page 9 of 11

reaction volume of 110 μl. Following the incubation, the
same volume of 1 M sodium carbonate, pH 9 was added
to terminate the reaction, and the release of p-nitrophenol
was quantified at 410 nm using the molar extinction coefficient for pNP of 18300 M-1.cm-1. One unit of enzyme
activity was defined as the amount of protein that released
1 μmol p-nitrophenol per minute.
Effect of pH and temperature

The apparent optimal temperature was estimated in the
range 4-85°C (10 temperature tested) using CMC at 1% in
50 mM citrate phosphate buffer, pH 4.8 hydrolyzed for 30
minutes at 45°C. The apparent optimal pH was estimated
in the range 3-10 (9 pH tested: pH 3-6 citrate phosphate
buffer, pH 7-8 phosphate buffer, pH 9-10 carbonate-bicarbonate buffer) under the conditions used. For determination of thermal stability, the purified proteins were
incubated at 65 or 80°C for various time lengths (30 minutes to 48 hours), and the residual activity towards CMC
was subsequently determined as described above.
Determination of dissociation constant and carbohydrate
binding capacity

For the binding assay, the reaction mixture contained 5
mg of Avicel PH101 and 40 to 200 μg of protein in a final
volume of 200 μl of citrate phosphate buffer (pH 4.8). All
assays were carried out in triplicates. For each assay, the
mixture was incubated at 4°C for 1 h with vertical rotation
(24 rpm). Substrate was removed by filtration and the concentration of unbound protein ([UB], μM) in the supernatant was measured by the Folin-Lowry method. The
bound protein concentration ([B], μmol per g of substrate)
was determined by substracting [UB] from the total protein concentration. Adsorption parameters were determined based on typical double-reciprocal plots using the
equation [B] = [UB] × [B]max/(Kd + [UB]), where Kd (μM)
and [B]max (μmol per g of substrate) are the equilibrium
dissociation constant and the maximum amount of protein bound, respectively [50].
Analysis of sugar release by HPAEC-PAD

Monosaccharides and oligosaccharides generated after
hydrolysis of cello-oligosaccharides (glucotetraose G4, glucopentaose G5, and glucohexaose G6) and cellulose derivatives (CMC and Avicel) were analyzed by high
performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC)
coupled with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) (ICS
3000; Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) equipped with a carbo-Pac
PA-1 analytical column (250 × 4 mm). 20 μl of suitablydiluted enzyme were incubated at 40°C for various time
lengths with 180 μl of 1 mM substrate in 50 mM acetate
buffer pH 4.8. 10 μl of enzymatic reactions were stopped
by the addition of 90 μl of 100 mM NaOH before injection
(5 μl) into the HPAEC system. Elution was carried out in

Couturier et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:103
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/103

130 mM NaOH using a 25-min linear gradient program
from 100% A (130 mM NaOH) to 60% A and 40% B
(NaOAc, 500 mM; NaOH, 130 mM). Calibration curves
were plotted using b-1,4-cello-oligosaccharides as standards from which response factors were calculated (Chromeleon program, Dionex) and used to estimate the
amount of products released. The specificity constants
were calculated using the Matsui equation [51,52].
