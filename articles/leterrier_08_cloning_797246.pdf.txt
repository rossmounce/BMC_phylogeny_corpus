Abstract
Background: Starch is of great importance to humans as a food and biomaterial, and the amount
and structure of starch made in plants is determined in part by starch synthase (SS) activity. Five SS
isoforms, SSI, II, III, IV and Granule Bound SSI, have been identified, each with a unique catalytic role
in starch synthesis. The basic mode of action of SSs is known; however our knowledge of several
aspects of SS enzymology at the structural and mechanistic level is incomplete. To gain a better
understanding of the differences in SS sequences that underscore their specificity, the previously
uncharacterised SSIVb from wheat was cloned and extensive bioinformatics analyses of this and
other SSs sequences were done.
Results: The wheat SSIV cDNA is most similar to rice SSIVb with which it shows synteny and
shares a similar exon-intron arrangement. The wheat SSIVb gene was preferentially expressed in
leaf and was not regulated by a circadian clock. Phylogenetic analysis showed that in plants, SSIV is
closely related to SSIII, while SSI, SSII and Granule Bound SSI clustered together and distinctions
between the two groups can be made at the genetic level and included chromosomal location and
intron conservation. Further, identified differences at the amino acid level in their
glycosyltransferase domains, predicted secondary structures, global conformations and conserved
residues might be indicative of intragroup functional associations.
Conclusion: Based on bioinformatics analysis of the catalytic region of 36 SSs and 3 glycogen
synthases (GSs), it is suggested that the valine residue in the highly conserved K-X-G-G-L motif in
SSIII and SSIV may be a determining feature of primer specificity of these SSs as compared to GBSSI,
SSI and SSII. In GBSSI, the Ile485 residue may partially explain that enzyme's unique catalytic
features. The flexible 380s Loop in the starch catalytic domain may be important in defining the
specificity of action for each different SS and the G-X-G in motif VI could define SSIV and SSIII action
particularly.

Background
Starch is an important reserve of carbon and energy. It is
the most widely used storage compound in plants and it
makes up 50% of the calories humans eat [1]. Further,
starch has great utility in several industries as a cheap, versatile and biodegradable polymer and its demand in these
niche markets is increasing [2,3]. In spite of its importance
as a primary source of food for humans and its growing
economic value as a raw material, our understanding of
the mechanistic basis of starch biosynthesis is incomplete
[1,4,5].
Starch is deposited in the plastid as complex crystalline
granules. It is made up of two α1–4-glucan polymers;
amylose is the smaller almost linear polymer, while amylopectin is larger and has a high frequency of α-1–6-glycosidic linkages between glucan chains [2]. The branch
pattern of α-1–6-linked amylopectin glucan chains is polymodal and highly organised such that crystallisation of
glucose molecules occurs, with the subsequent formation
of a granular supra-macromolecule. Prokaryotes, fungi
and animals do not store starch but accumulate glycogen.
Although glycogen also has branched α-1,4-glucan
chains, they lack the sophisticated polymodal organisation found in starch. The result is that glycogen is amorphous and water-soluble [6], while starch is a
metabolically stable hydrocolloid [7,8].
Starch synthases (SSs; EC 2.4.1.21 and EC 2.4.1.242)
elongate the glucan chains of amylose and amylopectin.
They catalyze the transfer of the glucose moiety of
ADPglucose to the non-reducing end of an existing glucan
chain via an α-1,4-glucosidic link. Five SS classes, SSI, SSII,
SSIII, SSIV and Granule Bound SSI (GBSSI), have been
identified among the DNA sequences available in public
repositories and, in cereals, duplication of several SSencoding genes gave rise to 10 isoforms [9]. Genome
sequencing projects of unicellular green algae show that
most of the SS classes found in higher plants are also
present in algae [6], suggesting that the gene duplication
events that gave rise to the five main SS isoforms predated
the evolution of higher plants. Prokaryotic glycogen synthases (EC 2.4.1.11; GS), like higher plant SSs, use the
ADPglucose pathway for the synthesis of glycogen; however, surveying the genomic sequences of prokaryotes in
DNA databanks leads to the conclusion that there may be
no more than two GS isoforms in prokaryotes.
The coordinated activity of the different SS isoforms helps
to build the starch granule and influence its architecture
[8,10]. Genetic, and some biochemical and in vitro kinetic
studies, suggests that SSI elongates the short chains, SSII
the intermediate, and SSIII and perhaps GBSSI elongate
the long chains of amylopectin, respectively [8]. Only
GBSSI activity is required to make amylose [10]. A role for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/98

the SSIV isoform primarily in starch granule initiation in
Arabidopsis has recently been shown although it may also
be involved in making short glucan chains [11]. While it
is largely held that each SS isoform has a unique role in
starch biosynthesis, studies of some SS transgenic and
mutant lines suggest that there may be functional overlap
between isoforms [11-13]. In addition to chain-length
preferences, SS isoforms also have distinct intra-plastidic
locations. GBSSI is starch granule-localised, SSIII and SSIV
[11] are exclusively in the stroma, while SSII and SSI are
found distributed between stroma and granule. The partitioning of SS activity in these different regions may influence their individual kinetic behaviours through their
interaction with substrate and other starch biosynthetic
enzymes, with eventual repercussions for granule structure.
The basic metabolic activity of SSs and GSs is defined by a
highly conserved region shared between these enzymes.
This "core" region is in the C-terminus of plant SSs and is
60 kDa in length, but encompasses essentially the entire
protein sequence of the prokaryotic GSs. The major variation among SSs in this region is an extension or "tail" of
20 amino acids found only in GBSSI proteins [14]. Within
the catalytic core is the conserved starch catalytic domain
(Pfam PF08323) and the glycosyltransferase 1 domain
(Pfam PF00534) characteristic of the GT5 glycosyltransferase superfamily according to CAZY [15-18]. The starch
catalytic domain is found in glycosyltransferases that use
only ADPglucose as substrate. The glycosyl transferase 1
domain is found in proteins that transfer UDP, ADP, GDP
or CMP-linked sugars to a variety of substrates, including
glycogen, fructose-6-phosphate and lipopolysaccharides
and is therefore not unique to GSs and SSs.
Our knowledge of how GT5 enzymes interact with the
ADPglucose substrate was enhanced by the determination
of the crystal structure of Agrobacterium tumefaciens GS and
modeling of its interaction with substrate [16,19]. Agrobacterium tumefaciens GS and perhaps all SSs and GSs are
"retaining-type" glycosyltransferases with a GT-B-fold
[18,19]. The GT-B-fold is characterised by two different
Rossmann-like α-β-α domains, separated by a deep cleft
that is predicted to be highly flexible [16,19]. Within this
fold is one of the two highly conserved K-X-G-G-L motifs
that may play a role in catalysis and/or substrate binding
[20-25]. Although there are no SS crystals available to enable definitive conclusions about SS three-dimensional
(3D) structure, the sequence homology of bacterial GS
and the catalytic core region of the plants makes it likely
that the structural features described for Agrobacterium
tumefaciens GS may also hold true for plant SSs [26].
In contrast to the similarities at the C-termini, the N-terminal region upstream of the catalytic core, shows no

sequence uniformity amongst SS isoforms. Further, SS Ntermini vary greatly in length from 2.2 kDa in GBSSI to
~135 kDa in maize SSIII [27], and noticeably, is absent in
prokaryotic GSs. The SS N-terminal extension does not
appear to be directly involved in catalysis although it may
alter SS kinetics and/or interaction with substrate
[12,24,28]. It could also play a crucial role in the ability of
different SSs to form functional enzymatic complexes
with other starch biosynthetic enzymes, which is proving
to be key factor in determining amylopectin formation
[29,30].

In this manuscript the different SS genes and their predicted proteins are described as follows: the prefix refers to
the species name, e.g. Triticum aestivum L. is referred to as
Ta, and is followed by indication of the SS isoform, e.g.
SSIV. For duplicated SS genes in cereals, we use the suffix
a, b or c to indicate that sub-isoform, depending on the
organ where the gene is primarily expressed; a refers to
storage tissue and b and c to vegetative tissue. For consistency GBSSI and GBSSII are described as GBSSIa and
GBSSIb, respectively, as originally named by Denyer et al.
[31].

This paper describes the cloning of a cDNA from wheat
with high homology to the SSIV class of SSs, and the bioinformatics analysis of this and other SSs sequences in the
database to investigate potential functional, structural and
evolutionary relationships between SSIV, other SSs and
GSs. The first aim was to gain a basic understanding of the
SSIV gene in wheat – its expression, genomic organisation
and chromosomal location. The second aim was to identify similarities in the predicted protein sequences of GSs
and SSs that may indicate important conserved characteristics critical to SS function. The third aim was to identify
sequence differences that may denote evolutionary
changes that serve as the basis for the specificity of action
of these SS isoforms.

Results
A. Cloning and characterisation of SSIVb
Identification and characterization of a wheat SSIV cDNA
An expressed sequence tag (EST) [Genbank:BT009276]
homologous to plant SSs and glycogen GSs at the amino
acid level was identified from a developing wheat seedling
cDNA. Using a 5'RACE-like procedure, contiguous cDNA
fragments were amplified from wheat libraries that collectively gave a 3386 bps-long sequence containing a fulllength ORF of 2806 bp [Genbank:AY044844] (Figure 1).
The amino acid sequence deduced from this ORF contains
914 residues and a predicted molecular mass of 103.1
kDa. A putative cleavage site between amino acids 45 and
46 was identified using the ChloroP neural network [32]
cleavage at which would result in a mature protein of

found within the predicted amino acid sequence. PCR fragments A, B and C were amplified by a 5'RACE-like procedure
carried out with wheat cDNA libraries (see Methods) and represent the minimum tiling path of several sequences identified.
The SSIV EST (EST-968 bp) and the cDNAs called 1600 bp RACE and 2100 bp RACE were isolated similarly to A, B and C and
were assembled into different cloning vectors to test coding potential and/or glycosyltransferase activity. The starch catalytic
domain (GT-5) and glycosyltranferase domain (GT-1) characteristics of the SS family are shown. Predicted 14-3-3 recognition
sites and the coiled-coil domains (blue boxes and 'CC'), as well as the two highly conserved KVGGL and KTGGL domains are
also shown.

molecular mass 98.3 kDa. Analysis of the sequence
showed that it was most homologous (87%) to OsSSIVb
[Genbank:AAQ82623].
The SSIV cDNA sequence allows it to be unambiguously
identified as a SS. The starch catalytic and glycosyltransferase domains characteristic of SSs are present in the Cterminus (Figure 1), and conservation of sequence identities at the two putative ADPglucose binding motifs, i.e.
KVGGL and KTGGL, was found between this wheat cDNA
and the rice SSIV and SSIII Classes. Expression of the 968bp EST and 2100-bp RACE products in E. coli produced
polypeptides of the expected size. In the latter case, glycosyltransferase activity could be detected, albeit at a low
level [see Additional file 1]. Like all other SSs the N-terminus of TaSSIVb is unique; an SSIV-specific region, from
amino acids 1–405, was detected and within this region
two coiled-coil domains and a 14-3-3-protein recognition
site were identified (Figure 1).
Phylogenetic analysis of starch and glycogen synthases
The deduced amino acid sequence of the wheat SSIV
cDNA was compared to those of 36 other SSs and 3 GSs,
two from Synechocystis and the other from Agrobacterium
tumefaciens, using Clustal W [33,34]. The five SS classes
clustered into two groups (Figure 2), an arrangement also
reported by others [6,35]. For ease of description, GBSSI,
SSI and SSII will be called the Group A SSs, and SSIII and
SSIV will be called the Group B SSs, respectively. Within
the Group A SSs, GBSSI appears to diverge from SSI and
SSII. Ostreococcus does not have a SSIV gene but has three
isoforms of SSIII, with the OtSSIIIa most closely resembling other SSIV proteins. Synechocystis PCC 6803 is one of
the few cyanobacteria identified from BLAST analysis to
have two GS isoforms, one of which repeatedly clustered
with the Group B SSs, and the other repeatedly with the
Group A SSs. This was found in all phylogenetic trees created whether using neighbour-joining, minimum evolution or maximum parsimony on both nucleotide and
protein sequences.
Genomic organisation of TaSSIVb
A partial genomic clone of SSIV [Genbank:DQ400416)]
was sequenced from Triticum aestivum using PCR. Three
overlapping contiguous genomic clones (See Figure 3)
together gave a sequence of 7,141 bp. The promoter
region could not be amplified in our hands presumably
because of the high GC content of the 5' end of the gene.
The TaSSIVb gene contains 16 exons separated by 15
introns, a structure which is similar to that reported in all
SS isoforms cloned to date [36]. Although intronic
sequences are generally only weakly similar among plant
SSs, there is high identity (ranging from 51.1 to 78.3%)
between introns four to nine of TaSSIVb and OsSSIVb
while the identity between the introns of the two OsSSIV

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/98

isoforms averaged only 20% (data not shown). Of note is
the similarity of sequence found in intron-4 among all the
SSIV isoforms from wheat, rice and Arabidopsis (40 to
47%).
Chromosomal location of TaSSIVb
The chromosomal location of the TaSSIVb gene was determined by Southern blot analysis of wheat nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines [37]. Three bands of
approximately 12 kb, 10 kb and 6 kb hybridized to the
SSIV probe (data not shown) in nullisomic-tetrasomic
lines, indicating that TaSSIVb is a single-copy gene, one
gene present on the homeologous group I chromosome of
each of the A, B, and D genomes. Additional mapping
experiments with ditelosomic lines showed that the 10 kb
band was missing in the 1AS lines, the 6 kb was missing
in the 1BS line and the 12 kb band was missing in the 1DS
lines (Figure 4) which is consistent with a gene on the
long arms of the group I chromosomes.
SSIV mRNA expression
The size of the TaSSIVb transcript was determined by
northern blotting. A band of approximately 3.4 kb was
detected, which is close to the size of the predicted fulllength SSIV transcript based on the PCR-amplified fragments. A faint band of higher molecular mass (~3.7 kb)
that hybridized to the probe could also be seen (Figure
5A).

The expression pattern of transcripts encoded by TaSSIVb
was then determined by semi-quantitative comparative
reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (Figure 5B). Expression
was highest in leaf and embryo and lower in endosperm
where it decreased steadily as the organ matured. This
result was reproducible over four different experiments.
Expression of the TaSSIIIa transcript was also compared to
that of TaSSIVb because of the close phylogenetic relationship between these isoforms (Figure 5B). The TaSSIIIa
transcript is strongly expressed in the endosperm, but
could be detected in leaf (upon long exposure, data not
shown) and embryo albeit at significantly lower levels.
Similar expression profiles were obtained in rice with OsSSIVb and OsSSIIIa [38-40].
Expression of SSIV leaf transcript by semi-quantitative comparative
RT-PCR under different light conditions
Because TaSSIVb is preferentially expressed in leaf it is
possible that transcript levels could be responsive to
changes in the light-dark regimen and that it could be regulated by the circadian clock. TaGBSSIb was included in
this study for comparison because it was reported to be
unresponsive to light when analyzed by northern blotting
[41]. The TaSSIVb, TaSSIIIa and TaGBSSIb transcripts (Figures 6A &6B) were all expressed at high levels in response
to light, but after 24 h of continuous darkness (at time

point 4 in Figure 6B), transcripts were barely detectable.
This indicates that in wheat the circadian clock does not
regulate expression of these genes since during the
extended dark period, mRNA levels do not follow the pattern expected during the 16 h light period.
B. Global sequence analysis of SS Isoforms
Comparative protein modeling
To further our understanding of the wheat SSIVb gene
product and SSs in general, the sequences of this, and 31
SSs and 3 GSs from a broad range of species were analysed
to identify common as well as unique features that may
underscore the basis for conserved functions as well as differences in SS metabolic action in planta. To gain insight
on the structural features of SSs, we also compared SS
sequences specifically to that of AgtGS for which a crystal
structure is available.
3D Structure of SSIV
A homology model for the C-terminus (amino acids 406–
914) of TaSSIVb was built by threading its sequence onto
the 3D structure of AgtGS (Figure 7). The resulting model
is in good agreement with those developed for AgtGS and

AtSSIII [26,42]. The two different α-β-α Rossmanndomains of the GT-B family are apparent as is the large
cleft which contains the ADP-binding pocket towards the
C-terminal side [43]. Residues that take part in catalysis
and/or substrate-binding depicted on the model are elaborated in Table 1, which shows amino acids that are conserved across GS and SSs, and Table 2, which highlights
those amino acids that are not highly conserved. These
residues were identified based on published studies on
AgtGS and, to a lesser extent, based on site mutagenesis
studies of EcGS [18,19,44]. These amino acids are all
brought into close proximity of the ADP molecule in
response to the predicted change in conformation of the
enzyme in going from an opened, relaxed form to a closed
state [43].
Analysis of the conserved domains
The length and homology of the conserved starch catalytic
(GT-5) and the glycosyltransferase-1 (GT-1) domains of
some SSs and GSs were compared to those found in
prokaryotic GSs for which a crystal structure exists. The
GT-5 domain (Pfam PF08323) was similar among the different SS and GS isoforms with the range of Expect values

μg of wheat genomic DNA was digested with EcoRV and blotted onto HyBond N+, and was hybridised against a 550 bp
fragment from a PstI/EcoRI digest of clone 1600 bp RACE
(Figure 1). The estimated size of each band is indicated on
the right. The nomenclature for each sample is as follows:
CS, Chinese Spring parental; Ditelosomic lines, 1AL, 1BL and
1DL, lack the short arms of chromosomes 1A, 1B and 1D,
respectively, but each has four copies of the corresponding
long arms. Ditelosomic lines, 1AS, 1BS and 1DS, lack the long
arms of chromosome 1A, 1B and 1D, respectively, but each
has four copies of the corresponding short arm. Bands missing in 1AS, 1BS and 1DS show that SSIV is likely located on
the long arm of Chromosome I.

(E) from 6.5e-10 to 2.5e-140 compared to that of AgtGS
(data not shown). However there was less similarity in the
GT-1 region (Pfam PF00534), with the Group B SSs differing most. E-values were 0.5 to 4.2e-3 in the Group B SSs
and from 2e-7 to 4.8e-16 in the Group A SSs when compared to that in EcGS.
SS secondary structure
The secondary structures of the different wheat SSs were
compared to AgtGS using the Jnet prediction program
[45,46]. Some structural features specific to each SS subfamily among the different species could be identified. For
example, an additional β-strand is found between β1 and
α1 in the Group A SSs that is absent in the SpGSs, AgtGS
and the Group B SSs, (Figures 8, 9, 10, 11). The
hydrophilic "tail" region at the end of the C-terminus that
is unique to GBSSI proteins [15] was found to adopt a helical structure. This helical region is also found in SpGS1
but not in SpGS2 (Figure 11).

There are two Loops containing important residues (H163
and Gly329, Table 1; discussed below) that have different
lengths in the SSs sub-families. The first Loop, referred to
as the 380s Loop [42,43] (and see Figures 7 and 9), is a
stretch of 35 amino acids containing a small antiparallel

one predicted helix in the SSs: GBSSI, SSI, SSII and SSIV.
In the wheat SSIII, this polypeptide stretch is reduced to 7
amino acids and does not include a helix. This region is
highly variable at all levels (nucleotides, amino acids, secondary structure) among the SSs sub-families. The second
Loop is located in motif VI, which contains Gly329 in
AgtGS, and is shown in green on Figures 7 and 10. It is
longer in SSIII and SSIV than in the Group A SSs and
presents few homologies when compared to AgtGS.
Active site residues
Amino acid residues that make up the highly conserved
regions of SSs and GSs initially found by Gao et al., (1998)
[27] may now be extended as more SS and GS sequences
are available. Residues involved in ADPglucose and/or
glycogen/starch binding have also been identified in
AgtGS which could also be instructive in identifying those

Transcript analysis of the wheat SSs in leaf by comparative RT-PCR under varying conditions of light. A. Transcript levels of TaSSIVb, TaSSIIIa, TaGBSSIb and TaGAPDH during the course of the photoperiod in wheat leaves as determined
using comparative RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from leaves sampled from 14-day old wheat plants grown under a regime of
16 h light and 8 h dark in a greenhouse. Open bars correspond to the 16 h-light period; the solid bars correspond to the 8 hdark period. Leaves were harvested at the end of the dark/beginning of the light period (1), the middle of the light period (2)
and in the middle of the dark period (3). Results are typical of three experiments. B. Transcript levels of the TaSSIVb, TaSSIIIa,
TaGBSSIb and TaGAPDH during an alternating 24 h-dark and light period. Plants were grown as described in A but were transferred to a growth chamber and acclimated to 16:8 light:dark regime for 2 days. RNA was extracted from leaves of eight 14day old plants after 16 h light (and 0 h dark) (1), 4 h (2), 16 h (3) and 24 h (4) in the dark, followed by 4 h (5), 16 h (6) and 24 h
(7) in the light. Solid bars correspond to the dark period; the white stippled areas correspond to what in a 16:8 cycle would
have been the light period. Open bars correspond to the light period; the stippled area corresponds to what in a 16:8 cycle
would have been the dark period.

defining amino acids needed for catalysis [43] (Figures 8,
9, 10, 11).
The variable amino acid in the Lys-X-Gly-Gly-Leu motif in
the SS and GS sequences was first examined. This motif,
which occurs at the highly conserved Lys15 in AgtGS, has
long been considered as part of the ADPglucose active site
in SSs and GSs [20,21]. Although this hypothesis has since
been brought into question [23], our observations show a
high level of intra-group conservation at this residue. It is
a valine (non-polar) in Group B SSs, and a threonine or a
serine (both polar) in the Group A SSs (Table 2; Figure 8).
This appeared true in all 5 SS classes and for all 33 species
compared (data not shown). Interestingly, like the Group
B SSs, SpGS1 and SpGS2 both have non-polar residues
(valine and alanine, respectively) at this site.

Variation in other amino acids believed to play a role in
ADPglucose binding in AgtGS, may indicate specificities
that help define the individual SS classes (Table 2). For
example, in AgtGS, van der Waals forces among Ser298,
Ser359 and Tyr354 are thought to stabilize the adenine
heterocycle when ADPglucose binds the enzyme [43]. In
the Group A SSs, glycine (aliphatic) is substituted for the
polar Ser298 in Motif V (Figure 10). It has also been predicted that the hydroxyl (-OH) side chain of threonine at
residue 381 (Thr381) would form a hydrogen bond with
the O2 atom of the ribose moiety of ADPglucose [43].
However, in all of the GBSSIs analyzed, Thr381 is replaced
by isoleucine, which has an aliphatic hydrophobic side
chain and cannot form hydrogen or ionic bonds with
other groups. Members of the GT5 family have two highly
conserved glycines (Gly327 and Gly329 in AgtGS) in

Amino acids that are part of the catalytic site in AgtGS were identified in previous studies [18,19,43,44] and the equivalent residues in plant SSs were
identified after alignment of AgtGS using ClustalW [34]. Only AgtGS amino acids that were conserved across all of the SS isoforms are shown. Data
was extracted from the alignment shown in Figure 8.

Motif VI (Figure 10). Interestingly, the G-X-G motif is not
conserved in the GT3 family that uses UDPglucose [43].
The Gly329 residue is replaced by serine (polar) in the
SSIV sequences and such a substitution would likely affect
the functional properties of the protein. In AgtGS, His163
and Phe167 are involved in glycogen binding [43] and
would be predicted to be found in the GT-5 domain of
SSs. However, a previous study stated that His163 is not
present in SSs [42]. Our analysis shows that His163 is
indeed present and highly conserved among SSs (Figure 9
and Table 2). In contrast, the equivalent Phe167 residue
in the SSI and SSII sequences examined are basic (His318
and His380, respectively) and not the aromatic amino
acids found in AgtGS, the Group B SSs and GBSSIs (Figure
9, Table 2). The only exception we found within the SSII

family was OsSSIIa, where the conserved tyrosine (aromatic) is evident.
Relationship between genomic organisation and location of key
amino acids
It has been suggested that if the splicing site of a particular
intron coincides at the same amino acid position among
members of a group of orthologous proteins, then there is
ancient relatedness and conservation of functionality for
that amino acid residue [47-50]. The basis for this idea is
that proteins are built up through modular exonic segments spliced together using introns and if an amino acid
serves an important or critical functional role, these residues will remain relatively unaffected by evolutionary
changes in splicing and/or exon re-arrangements.

A proposed structural model for TaSSIVb based on the AgtGS structure (Protein Databank code: 1rzu). A putative homology model of the overall protein-fold and secondary structure of TaSSIVb was constructed using T.I.TO: Tool for
Incremental Threading Optimization [73,74]. The N- and C-termini are indicated, the two different Rossmann-like α-β-α
domains are apparent, as is the large cleft that separates them and makes up the active site. Residues identified as crucial to SS
activity are highlighted (green balls) and are outlined in Table 2 and 5. Also highlighted are the residues of the 380s Loop (in
red) and the G-X-G motif (in yellow).

The positions of introns relative to the positions of specific amino acids were compared within the SS subfamilies to look for evidence of evolutionary
conservation. In most cases, these positions are conserved
among orthologous SS isoforms (Figure 12). However,
two consecutive intron positions are conserved among all
Group B SSs, and one position is identical for the SSI and
SSII sequences examined (Figure 9). Both of these occurrences are within regions of interest within the predicted
amino acid sequence. The conserved glutamine identical
in SSI and SSII is within the 380s Loop between Motifs I
and II (Figure 12), and the consecutive positions for SSIII
and SSIV (Group B SSs) occurs within Motif I at the variable residue in the K-X-G-G-L motif between the lysine and
valine residues (Figure 8). The amino acid sequences surrounding the conserved splicing positions are shown in
blue boxes in Figures 8 and 9.

Discussion
The first aim of this work was to characterise a cDNA clone
with high homology to SSs. The TaSSIVb cDNA is related
to the SS group of enzymes by the presence of conserved
amino acid motifs of the α-glycosyltransferase family that
are found within its predicted amino acid sequence. A
protein with this activity could be detected, using western
blotting and an enzyme assay, when the cDNA was
expressed in E. coli (data not shown). The wheat SSIV in
vitro expression was weak (1.5 to 2.3-fold over background; See additional file: "SSIV construct synthesis and
E. coli expression.doc") possibly because the protein
required some component for activity that is not present
in the assay as is the case for GBSSI, for example, which is
not detected when expressed in E. coli because it must be
bound to the starch granule to be active [51]. A transcript
of similar size to that predicted by the cDNA sequence was
detected by Northern blotting. In addition, a weakly

hybridizing band of about 3.7 kb could also be seen (Figure 5A), which may be the duplicated TaSSIVa gene.
Gene organisation and chromosomal location
The intron-exon arrangement of the TaSSIVb genomic
clone isolated (Figure 3) was similar to orthologous genes
from rice and Arabidopsis. Of interest was the sequence of
intron-4 which was highly similar between orthologues.
This intron is in a region that when spliced and translated,
produces the SSIV-specific N-terminal region. Introns are
generally neutral to selection and undergo rapid change
during evolution [49], therefore high sequence similarity
between orthologous introns indicate a functional constraint during evolution [52].

The chromosomal location of TaSSIVb was also determined. It is positioned on the long arms of homeologous
group I chromosomes and is syntenic with the OsSSIVb
gene which maps to Chromosome 5. This differs from the
location of many of the genes involved in starch biosynthesis in wheat which co-localise with homeologous
group VII chromosomes [36] and to a lesser extent the

group II chromosomes [41]. In contrast, TaSSIVb and TaSSIIIa are on chromosome I, perhaps highlighting the distinct evolutionary origin of these genes as compared to the
other SSs [53]. However, TaSSIVb and TaSSIIIa map to
opposite arms of chromosome I therefore chromosomal
location offers few clues as to the evolutionary history of
these two genes relative to each other.
Expression analysis
The expression of TaSSIVb mRNA was highest in nonendosperm tissue (Figure 5B) and showed fewer marked
changes in response to varying light-dark conditions as
compared to TaSSIIIa (Figure 6B). The TaSSIVb gene may
be classified as a "steady expresser" [39]. If protein
amount and activity reflects message levels then the TaSSIVb has a housekeeping role in starch biosynthesis in
wheat endosperm as its transcript accumulation levels did
not coincide with the period of high carbon flux to starch
in the endosperm.

A circadian clock does not regulate TaSSIVb or TaSSIIIa
transcript levels (Figure 6B). The lack of appropriate ele-

ments in the promoter regions of the rice homologues
OsSSIVb and OsSSIIIa support this result. Induction of
expression of TaSSIIIa and TaSSIVb during the light
period may be a response to sugar accumulation as
observed in IbGBSSI and OsGBSSIb [54,55]. In our hands,
TaGBSSIb was not circadian clock-regulated which is at
odds with the expected expression pattern based on the
presence of the relevant cis-element in the OsGBSSIa
homologue. However, Vrintren et al. [39] reported that
TaGBSSIb expression was not only independent of a circadian clock, but also non-responsive to light.
Sequence analysis
The second aim in this work was to advance existing
knowledge of structure-function relation of starch synthases including the SSIV gene cloned. Known motifs in
AgtGS predicted to play a role in catalysis and/or binding
were compared with SSs analysed. If these sequences are
invariant among SSs from diverse species, this may indicate that the corresponding amino acids may function
similarly, as conserved sequence motifs suggests an evolu-

tionary relationship between proteins. Structural analysis
and alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of
SS and GSs revealed several amino acids potentially crucial in determining specific SS activity. These residues are
presented in Table 1. By extension, amino acids within
conserved motifs that are distinct between SS isoforms
may at least be partially explained, by the important differences in functionality. These will be discussed in turn.
GBSSI
GBSSI is the only SS that makes amylose, but it can elongate amylopectin processively if it is bound to this polymer [14,56]. Although the C-terminal "tail" present in
GBSSI is unique to this isoform among SSs, it may only
define GBSSI's ability to bind to amylopectin [15]. The
only other difference that singled out GBSSI compared to
other SSs was a Thr381 → Ile amino acid substitution in
the active site that was present universally among GBSSI
proteins examined. Since this residue interacts with the
hydroxyl group of ADPglucose it is easy to imagine that
the aliphatic residue will not bind the glucose moiety of

The alignment was manually adjusted using secondary structure predictions. The key is as follows: regions predicted to form α-helices – grey rectangles; black arrows – β-sheets. Conserved amino acid residues are highlighted. The two

green), are indicated.

ADPglucose in the same way as in AgtGS and the other
SSs, which have polar residues at this site. This non-conservative substitution would affect the interaction of protein with substrate and explain the low Km of GBSSI for
ADPglucose and/or the ability of the enzyme to processively elongate maltooligosaccharides [51]. This hypothesis is worth testing using more direct methods such as sitedirected mutagenesis.
SSI and SSII
The Phe167 residue in the 380s Loop is conserved in all
SSs except the SSIs and SSIIs where it is a basic residue and
not an aromatic amino acid found in the other SSs. The
only exception among SSIIs was the tyrosine found in
OsSSIIa. The conserved aromatic residue at this position
in the GT5 superfamily stacks against the pyranose ring of
the glucose molecule of ADPglucose in AgtGS [43]. The
substitution of a polar residue at this site in SSIs and most
SSIIs may affect their ADPglucose-binding ability as compared to AgtGS and the other SS classes. The significance
of the 380s Loop in SS proteins is unknown, however our

findings make a case for a further examination of the role
of this region in determining SS activity. This is because
the other difference of note between SSI and SSII proteins
and all other SSs is the identical intron-amino acid positioning at Glu168 conserved within these isoforms and
not shared by the others. This glutamine residue may thus
have faced strong selective pressure to be conserved in
both SSIs and SSIIs. Furthermore, Glu168 lies immediately adjacent to the histidine which substitutes, again,
only in SSIs and SSIIs, for the otherwise highly conserved
Phe167 in AtgGS. Collectively these data implicate this
region of the 380s Loop as potentially holding some functional significance in delineating SS activity, especially for
SSIs and SSIIs.
Group A vs. Group B SSs
The apparent divergence of these α-glycosyltransferases
can in part be explained by differences in the length and
sequence homology of their GT-1 domains, substitutions
in key amino acid residues and differences in secondary
structure near or at the active/binding site that would lead

Figure 11 of the structural relationship between the wheat SSs and query proteins with the 3D structure of Agrobacterium
tumefacien glycogen synthase
Prediction
Prediction of the structural relationship between the wheat SSs and query proteins with the 3D structure of
Agrobacterium tumefacien glycogen synthase. The predicted amino acid sequence of 32 SSs from wheat, rice, Arabidopsis,
Chlamydomonas and Ostreococcus and two GSs from Synechocystis were compared to AgtGS. Sequences were aligned using Clustal W [34]. The alignment was manually adjusted using secondary structure predictions. The key is as follows: regions predicted to form α-helices – grey rectangles; black arrows – β-sheets. Conserved amino acid residues are highlighted. The two
major Loops, the 380s Loop or stretch of polypeptides (labeled), as well as the second Loop in Motif VI (which is highlighted in
green), are indicated.
to different spatio-conformational outcomes and possibly
change interaction of protein with substrate. The GT-1
domains of the Group A SSs are identical in length while
there is little conservation of GT-1 length among Group B
SSs. The GT-1 domain interacts with the nucleotide sugars
and differences in sequence homology in this region
could produce different 3D-folds and variation in reaction
mechanisms. Group B SSs also differ structurally from
Group A SSs in the G-X-G Loop near β-15 that faces the
nucleotide-binding cleft. This motif and Loop was previously believed to be absolutely conserved in all GT5
enzymes, [43] including the Group A SSs, however, it has
diverged in the Group B SSs. In SSIVs there is a non-conservative Gly → Ser substitution and, since this is the only
difference that distinguishes SSIVs from Group A SSs and
SSIIIs, we suggest that this region may help define the
unique activity of SSIVs and perhaps, by extension, their
role in granule priming. Our conclusions differ from
those drawn by Busi et al. [42] who inferred that the G-XG motif is absent in plants SSs; however, their analysis
included only AtSSIII and no other plant SSs.

Within the region that is predicted to directly bind the
substrate there are further distinctions between the two
main SS groups. In the Group A SSs there is a non-conservative substitution within Motif V of glycine for serine that
could alter the symmetry and spatial conformation of the
binding site. Furthermore, there is an additional β-strand
in the Group A SSs within Motif I which contains the conserved lysine of the K-X-G-G-L. β-strands have an
extended conformation which promotes a more linear
topography within the secondary structure of the proteins.
This additional strand may, again, allow the Group A synthases to interact in a different way with the starch granule
and/or substrate and could affect primer preference of
these enzymes.
The identity of the variable residue in the K-X-G-G-L motif
appeared to be dependent on whether the SS examined
was classified as a Group A or B SS. The K-X-G-G-L motif
is strictly conserved in all SSs and GSs and has been considered the ADPglucose active site in GSs and SSs [20,21].

An alignment showing the position of introns relative to amino acid sequence within SS classes
Figure 12
An alignment showing the position of introns relative to amino acid sequence within SS classes. An alignment
was made with the SS protein sequences by BLASTP [64] and this was compared to the genomic sequence of each protein in
turn. The presence of an intron at the position of an amino acid in the alignment is illustrated by a "1" when the splicing occurs
inside the amino acid or by "1+" when the splicing occurs just after the amino acid. When an intron was positioned at the same
amino acid in all of the sequences of a particular SS subfamily in the alignment, this was illustrated in the figure by color-filled
squares. Introns were identified by comparing the cDNA against the genomic sequence of each SS using Spidey at NCBI [75]
and were manually checked for non-canonical sites. Genbank Accession numbers ascribed to the nucleotide sequences are as
follows: AtGBSSI [AT1G32900.1A], TaGBSSIa [AB019624], AtSSI [AF121673]; TaSSI [AF091802]; AtSSII [AC008261]; TaSSIIa
[AY133248]. Genbank Accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences of other SSs and amino acid sequences are given elsewhere.

ADPglucose confirms that Lys15 in this motif is involved
in substrate binding [43]. Gao et al. (2004) put forward
the idea that this amino acid may be a determinant of SS
chain elongation specificity in plant SSs. Indeed, a major
difference between the SSs sub-families is the preference
for a primer of a specific chain length; thus, further scrutiny of differences in the sequence of this motif is warranted. Within the highly conserved K-X-G-G-L motif, the
variable residue is non-polar in the Group B SSs and polar
in the Group A SSs (Figure 8). Another essential consideration is the conservation of intron position with respect to
the valine amino acid residue within motif I in the Group
B SSs, highlighting, perhaps, that this valine residue is fun-

damental to the Group B SSs' metabolic action as there is
evidence of strong evolutionary selective pressure for its
conservation (Figure 9).
A distinguishing feature that separates SSI and SSII of the
Group A SSs from the Group B SSs and GBSSI is a conserved glutamine within the 380s Loop. As previously
noted [42,43], the 380s Loop is highly variable in length
among the different GSs and SSs. It is therefore probable
that this Loop is not crucial for SS global activity but it
could still confer specificity to individual SSs. The 380s
Loop supports communication between the glycogenbinding and catalytic sites of E. coli maltodextrin and gly-

cogen phosphorylase with an ensuing spatio-conformational change after substrate-binding ([42] and references
therein). A role for this region in SSs or GSs has not yet
been determined. Elements found in the equivalent
region in glycogen phosphorylases necessary for binding
to a carbohydrate are lacking in SSs and GSs [43]. This
raises questions about the role of the 380s Loop in SSs.
Still, intron-amino acid positioning suggests that the
Glu168 residue in this region is highly conserved in SSIs
and SSIIs, which points some functional significance of
this amino acid and region to SS enzymatic action.
Proposed role for 380s Loop
There is evidence to suggest that some SSs can catalyse the
initiation and elongation of glucan chains. AgtGS is able
to prime glycogen synthesis independent of a glycogenin
protein and Roldan et al. [11] drew a comparison between
the priming functions of AgtGS protein and that of SSIV in
Arabidopsis based on the phenotype of the AtSSIV mutant.
Indeed, some SSs are able to prime starch synthesis in vitro
[28]. To explain this possible self-priming function a 2point insertion mechanism was elaborated by Guan &
Keeling [57] whereby an SS would bind two ADPglucose
molecules at different sites and α-1,4-glucan chain synthesis would occur de novo by the transfer of the glucose moiety of one ADPglucose to the other. Considering the
position of Lys15 and the conserved Gly18 in Motif, I far
from the catalytic core of the enzyme, it is initially difficult
to see how they could determine primer specificity. However, these residues are invariant in the SS/GS family, suggestive of a functional role. One possibility is that after
ADPglucose binding at the active site within the cleft or
ADPglucose-binding pocket, the closed structure which
results brings the α-1 and β-1 sheets containing the K-XG-G-L motif and any primer it binds, e.g. another ADPglucose molecule or glucan chain, into proximity of the active
site. If the 380s Loop functions in SSs in the way proposed
for phosphorylases [42,58-60], then the movement of this
Loop during the open-close transition after ADPglucose
binding may be an important part of the mechanism that
drives the specificity of action of the SSs within the catalytic region. This mechanism would not require that the
380s Loop directly bind a carbohydrate. The only region
that is consistently different among all SSs is the 380s
Loop and these differences may possibly be translated,
although indirectly, into different interactions with substrate and/or glucan primer.

Although it is suggested here that the 380s Loop could
have a role in determining SS specificity, it does not rule
out the possibility that other regions of SSs may also contribute or may be more important for SS functionality. In
this study we focused our comparisons exclusively on the
two-lobes of the C-terminus containing the GT1 and GT5
domains. It has been established that this region is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/98

responsible for catalytic activity and also, differences in
substrate preference, affinity and reaction velocity
between SSs [15,23,24]. However the function of the Nterminus in potentially defining SS activity is not yet
known. This region may help to confer SS unique action
by influencing or facilitating their interaction with other
starch biosynthetic enzymes and/or substrate [29,30]. The
formation of starch biosynthetic enzyme complexes especially could modify the activity of each SS isoform and
their relative contribution to starch glucan assembly.
Evolutionary relationship between cyanobacterial GSs and
SSs
Analysis of algal SSs and cyanobacterial GS proved
informative in helping to understand the function and
relationship between the classes of these enzymes. Of particular interest, Ostreococcus tauri does not have SSIV but
three isoforms of SSIII [6]. Granule initiation does not
seem to be essential in Ostreococcus as this alga partitions
its starch granules from mother to daughter cells by binary
fission [6]. If SSIV is part of the biological mechanism
involved in granule initiation [11], it is also possible that
OtSSIIIa performs a similar function. Sequence analysis of
Synechocystis PCC 6803 GSs also clarified our view of SS
relationships. Synechocystis has two forms of GS, one of
which, SpGS2, is closely related to the Group B SSs while
the other, SpGS1, is more similar to the Group A SSs (Figure 2). Interestingly, the C-terminal extension found only
in GBSSI polypeptides is also present in SpGS1. This raises
intriguing possibilities about the evolutionary relationship between SpGS1 and the GBSSIs, and, when it is considered that all members of the Group A SSs have the
ability to bind to the starch granule, the functional association of SpGS1 with the Group A SSs as a whole.

Phylogenetic analysis of the origins of starch biosynthetic
genes in higher plants and green and red algae suggests
there to be a complex set of evolutionary events with vertical and lateral gene transfers between host and endosymbiont cells [35]. In spite of this it is widely accepted
that genes from a cyanobacterial endosymbiont are now
present in plant host nuclei [61,62] and some of these
genes have retained much of their sequence identity. The
clear separation of GSs into two distinct clades, and
sequence similarities between them and SSs from one
group or the other, suggests that the Group A and Group
B SSs evolved directly from the two independent GS types.
The SSIV group could have evolved from SpGS2, and subsequent gene duplication events might have led to the
evolution of SSIIIs. One exon each in the wheat and Arabidopsis Class III SSs (exons III and I, respectively), contains a significant proportion of the coding region that is
present in SSIII but not SSIV or other SSs [53]. It is possible that the Class III SSs arose as a result of duplication of
the SSIV followed by a single insertion event of a gene

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:98

sequence represented by these exons. The resulting difference in gene structure, as well as subsequent changes
selected for during evolution, might have led to two distinct gene products that are sufficiently diverged to constitute two different gene classes. High sequence similarity of
intronic sequences and intron-amino acid positions is
supportive of the notion that SSIII and SSIV followed a
common evolutionary path.

Conclusion
The basic cloning and characterisation of TaSSIVb showed
that the SS it encodes is similar to other SSIVs and has
almost 50% similarity to prokaryotic GSs and higher plant
SSIIIs. Phylogenetic and sequence analysis suggests that
SSIs, SSIIs and GBSSIs have a distinct evolutionary origins
as compared to SSIIIs and SSIVs. This bifurcation is supported by differences in secondary structure and amino
acid residue substitutions in what are accepted to be critical and/or conserved regions for ADPglucose binding
and/or catalysis. The 380s Loop is proposed to be potentially a determinant of SS-specificity and through its
involvement in the open-closed transition of the active
site during ADPglucose binding as has been suggested for
glycogen phosphorylases. The valine residue within the
highly conserved K-X-G-G-L motif appears to have faced
strong evolutionary selection in SSIII and SSIVs and it may
affect primer/substrate binding of these SSs compared to
SSIs, SSIIs and GBSSIs. SSIII and SSIV also differ from
other SSs at the highly conserved G-X-G motif near the
nucleotide-binding cleft. We stress that although these
predictions of structure-function characteristics of SSs
must be confirmed by experimental data, they provide a
useful framework for designing an in-depth investigation
of the role of each SS in the construction of the 3D architecture of starch. Such studies can help with efforts to
engineer starch with modified crystalline structure and
physico-chemical properties.

RNA extraction
RNA was extracted from various tissues of wheat using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Tissues
included embryos from caryopses harvested at 25 DPA,
endosperm (including the aleurone layer) from caryopses
harvested at approximately 4–7 DPA, 5–10 DPA, 10–16
DPA, 16–20 DPA, 20–25 DPA, 26–32 DPA, whole caryopses harvested at 3, 7 and 14 DPA, and leaves, roots and
the aerial parts of 14-day seedlings. Poly (A)+ RNA was
purified from total RNA using Pharmacia QuickPrep RNA
purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, NJ).
cDNA library construction and EST analysis
First-strand cDNA synthesis was catalysed by Superscript
II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with a
nucleotide mixture containing 5-methyl dCTP. The cDNA
library was ligated 5'→3' into an EcoRI/Xho I-digested
pBluescript SK+ vector according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) and maintained in
Escherichia coli DH10B cells (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA). The SSIV EST [Genbank:BT009276] was identified by
sequencing randomly picked bacterial colonies from a
developing wheat seedling cDNA library made using a
previously described method [63].
Generation of the full-length SSIV sequence by 5'RACE of
wheat cDNA libraries
DNA was prepared from each wheat library using a DNA
miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). An aliquot of DNA
(1 ng.ul-1) was used as a template in separate PCR reactions with 10 μM each of T3 vector primer (5'-GCC AAG
CTC GGA ATT AAC CCT CA-3') and a gene-specific primer
complementary to the 5' end of EST [Genbank:BT009276]. PCR amplification was done with GCAdvantage polymerase mix (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA).
Cycling parameters were 94°C for 1 min; 10 cycles of
94°C for 30 s, 68°C for 30 s, 72°C for 4 min, then 25
cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 63°C for 30 s, 72°C for 4 min, and
an extension time of 72°C for 7 min in a PE 9700 Thermocycler (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT). The products of
the PCR reaction were diluted 1:100 and the DNA reamplified using a nested primer and the vector primer SKlong (5'-GCC GCT CTA GAA CTA GTG GAT CCC CCG
GGC TGC AGG A-3'). PCR products were gel-purified
(Qiaquick, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and subcloned into
pCR 2.1 (TOPO-TA, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or pGEMT (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) vectors. At least four transformants containing an insert were selected and
sequenced in both directions using an ABI 3700 capillary
Sequencer with the ABI BigDye terminator chemistry (The
PE Corporation, Foster City, CA). The longest PCR product was used to design primers for additional 5'-RACE.
The antisense oligonucleotide primers used in conjunction with a vector primer to amplify contiguous sequences

Sequence A (nucleotides 1 to 1023), 5'-GCA GAT CAT
GAT TGT GGT CCA ATA-3' and 5'-AGC ATG CTC TAC
TTG GTT TGC TG-3'; for Sequence B (nucleotides 991 to
1778), 5'-AAC AAA TGC AGT TTG CCA GTC A-3' and 5'CTG GAT GCT GTG GCT CAA TAA A-3'; and for Sequence
C (nucleotides 1658 to 2194), 5'-TGC AAG GGT TCC ATG
TAT CTG TG-3' and 5'-CCC TCT GAG CGA ACC TCT AGT
GC-3'. To amplify fragment 1600 bp-RACE, primers 5'CGC CCA AGC AGA TAC GAT GAA A-3' and 5'-TCA TAC
TTC AAA ATC AGC CGG A-3' were used. To amplify fragment 2100 bp-RACE, the primers were identical to those
used to amplify Sequence C and the PCR conditions similar except that Advantage polymerase mix was used and
the nested PCR was done using a 1:200 dilution of the primary PCR reaction as template.
Northern and Southern hybridisations
Northern analysis was performed with 0.5 μg poly (A+)
RNA extracted from developing wheat caryopses, separated on a 1.4% formamide-formaldehyde agarose gel
and blotted onto HyBond N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA probe was a 550 bp fragment from a PstI
and EcoRI digest of clone 1600 bp-RACE in TOPO-TA
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The probe was labelled using
RadPrime DNA Labelling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Hybridisation was done using PerfectHyb Plus solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 65°C according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membrane was washed twice for
20 min in 2 × SSC and 1% (w/v) SDS at 65°C, and five
times for 20 min in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at
65°C, until the background radioactivity was almost zero.
Southern analysis was performed with genomic DNA
extracted from leaves of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese
Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines using
standard techniques. A 20 μg aliquot of each sample was
digested with EcoRV and resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel.
Blotting, hybridisation and washing of the filter was as
described for RNA analysis.
mRNA detection using comparative Reverse TranscriptionPCR
Reverse transcription of wheat RNA, (treated with DNase I –
RNase-free, Ambion, Austin, TX) was performed with 0.1–1.0
μM of antisense gene-specific oligonucleotide primer (MWGBiotech, High Point, NC) at 42°C for 30 min with an RNA-PCR kit
(Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ). PCR was done
using the reverse transcription reaction as a template and Advantage-2 GC Polymerase mix (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with the
addition of the sense primer, using the following PCR conditions: TaSSIIIa and TaSSIVb, 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 60 s, 72°C
for 90 s for 25 cycles and for TaGAPDH and TaGBSSIb, 94°C for
15 s, 59°C for 30 s, 72°C for 60 s for 22 cycles. Each cycle had a
final extension of 72°C for 7 min. All reactions were done in a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/98

PE 9700 Thermocycler. The primers used to amplify the SSIV
transcript were 5'-GATACAAACGGCACTGGACGAA-3' and 5'CTCCATTTTTAGCTCGCGTTCT-3'. To amplify TaSSIIIa [Genbank:AF258608] the primers used were 5'-AATGGGATGTTTGGCGTTGG-3' and 5'-GTATAAGGGACCGGGATAAAA T-3'. To
amplify TaGBSSIb [Genbank:AF109395] the primers used were
5'-GTTCTGCCTTTTGTGCCTTGCT-3' and 5'-GCAGCATCAGTTCCTCCTCCAT-3. To amplify TaGAPDH [Genbank:AF251217]
the primers used were 5'-TCTCCAACGCTAGCTGCACCAC-3'
and 5'-GGAAGTCAGTGGAAACAAGGTC-3'. Primer pairs were
used at a final concentration of 0.2 μM with the exception of the
TaGAPDH pair, which was 0.1 μM in the PCR reaction. The
amounts of all products responded linearly to RNA input and
were as follows: TaSSIIIa, 50 ng and for TaSSIVb, TaGAPDH and
TaGBSSIb, 400 ng. Each reaction was repeated at least four times.
Ethidium bromide-stained PCR products were visualized with
an Eagle-Eye II Imager (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each PCR product was sequenced completely to confirm its identity. A product
was not observed in RNase-treated controls, or when RNA was
used as a template in a PCR reaction.
Isolation of genomic DNA
The SSIV genomic clone was isolated by using PCR on
genomic DNA from Triticum aestivum leaves (line
N1BT1D) using specific primers designed from the cDNA
sequence [Genbank:AY044844]. Two Taq polymerase
enzymes (and their corresponding buffers) were used:
Expand Long template PCR system (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchbury, NJ) and Advantage-2 GC Polymerase
mix GC-2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Each PCR reaction
contained 250 ng genomic DNA, 0.3 mM of each primer
and 0.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase. Amplification was
done with 1 denaturation cycle at 94°C for 2 min, 30
cycles of 20 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 62°C and 4 min at
68°C, followed by a final cycle of extension at 68°C for 10
min in a Techne Gradient PCR Cycler (Techne Inc., Burlington, NJ). The PCR reaction was loaded and separated
on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel. The visualized bands were
extracted from the gel and the purified fragments cloned
into the TOPO-XL vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
sequenced as described earlier.
DNA and protein sequence analysis
Computer analyses of all cDNA sequences were done
using the program VectorNTI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Similarity searches of nucleotide and protein sequences
were performed with BLASTP using the non-redundant
database at NCBI [64] Sequence alignments were accomplished using ClustalW [34] on the European Bioinformatics Institute's server and subsequent phylogenetic
analyses were computed with MEGA3 [65]. The conserved
domains within the predicted amino acid sequences were
identified using the Pfam database [66] ProDom [67] and
Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) [6870]. Prediction of the structural relationship between pro-

tein sequences of unknown 3D structure against proteins
with a known 3D structure were made using SAM-T02
[71,72]). The Jnet server was used to predict secondary
structure [45,46]. Protein models were constructed using
T.I.TO: Tool for Incremental Threading Optimization at
[73,74].
