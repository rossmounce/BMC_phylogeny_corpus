Hepatitis E in central China

Abstract
Background: Epidemiological investigations, detections and vaccines of hepatitis E (HE) have been paid a focus of
attention in prior studies, while studies on clinical features and risk factors with a large number of sporadic HE
patients are scarce.
Results: Sporadic HE can occur throughout the year, with the highest incidence rate in the first quarter of a year,
in central of China. Of the 210 patients, 85.2% were male, and the most common clinical symptoms were jaundice
(85.7%), fatigue (70.5%) and anorexia (64.8%). Total bilirubin (TBil), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and international
normalized ratio (INR) were found as major risk factors for death of HE patients. There was an overall mortality of
10%, and the mortality in the cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic group was 25% and 6.47%, respectively. Moreover,
hepatitis E virus (HEV) infected patients with liver cirrhosis had a higher mortality and incidence of complications.
Conclusions: TBil, BUN, and INR are major risk factors of mortality for HE. Liver cirrhosis can aggravate HE, and lead
to a higher mortality. HEV infection can cause decompensation in patients with cirrhosis, as evidenced by a
worsening Child-Pugh score.

1. Background
HE caused by HEV infection is transmitted by the fecaloral route and generally causes an acute self-limiting illness followed by complete recovery, which is the same
as hepatitis A (HA). However, the mortality of HE is
higher than HA and hepatitis B (HB), especially in pregnant women (with a mortality of 20%~30%)[1]. HE is
endemic in many developing countries with poor sanitation and insufficient public-health infrastructures.
Nevertheless, HEV infections are reported even in developed countries in recent years, making the disease a
great threat to human health. For example, a recent
study reported that a seroprevalence of HEV was found
among 20% of blood donors in USA and an evidence of
HEV epidemic was found in Japan[2]. HEV infections
have also been documented in Australia and European
Union[3-6]. Besides, cases of sporadic HE in people
without histories of recent travels have been reported in
developed regions.

The incidence of HE is higher and higher, while mortalities in different areas are distinct. A study in India
revealed that the mortality of out-break of HE was
0.07%-0.6%[7]. The mortality of in-hospital patients with
acute HE had a mortality of 1%~3%[1]. Till now, most
studies were focused on the epidemiological investigation, detections and vaccines, while studies on clinical
features and risk factors of death for HE with a large
number of patients are lacking. There are studies on the
outcome of HEV infection in patients with chronic liver
disease from India, Nepal, France and the UK[8-11]. It
was showed that the mortality of HEV in patients with
cirrhosis was 70% at 1 year[8]. However, similar reports
from China are scarce.

2. Methods
2.1 Patients

This study included 210 in-hospital HE patients from
Department of Infectious Disease of Wuhan Tongji
Hospital from January 2007 to December 2008. HE case
definition: alanine aminotransferase, ALT ≧ 2.5 × upper
limits of normal (ULN) and HEV IgM positive, or a rising HEV IgG or HEV PCR positive[11]. Cirrhotic
patients with sepsis, primary liver cancer, surgical

obstructive jaundice, hepatorenal syndrome and those
consuming alcoholic during previous 6 months were
excluded from the study. The cirrhosis groups were
matched for Child-Pugh score twice: the first time was 1
month before admission and the second was after
admission. Each patient after discharge from the hospital
was followed up 4 weekly at least for 6 months.
2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Pathogenic Detection

Sera from each patient was tested for HEV-IgM, HEVIgG, HAV-IgM, anti-HCV, HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg,
HBeAb, HBAb using commercial ELISA kit ( Beijing
Wantai Company).

regression. All statistical calculations were performed
using SPSS software 13.0.

3. Results
3.1 Etiology Detected Results

Among 210 patients, 125 were diagnosed being infected
with HEV alone, 1 co-infected with hepatitis A virus
(HAV), and 75 co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV),
2 with hepatitis C virus (HCV), 3 with cytomegalovirus
(CMV), 3 with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 1 with CMV +
EBV. Forty of the 210 patients had liver cirrhosis as
well. Seventy-eight patients had detectable HEV RNA in
their sera. All of them were genotype 4 which were confirmed by bidirectional sequencing and phylogenetic.

2.2.2 Reverse transcription and nested PCR for HEV[12]

HEV RNA was extracted and precipitated from 200 μl
of serum samples by acid-guanidinium-phenol method
(Trizol LS Reagent Invitrogen, USA). Reverse primer E5:
5’CTACACGAAACCGARAGW (R = A or G, W = A or
C) was used to reverse transcription. With primer E1
(5’CTGTTTAAYCTTGCTGACAC 3’(Y = C or T)) and
primer E5, the first round of amplification was completed (94℃ pre-degeneration for 5 min, 94℃ for 40s,
53℃ for 40s, 72℃ for 40s, followed by 35 cycles, 72℃
for 10 min). The amplified material was used for the
second-round nested amplification with primers E2
(5’GACAGAATTGATTTCGTCG 3’) and E4 (5’GTCC
TAATACTRTTGGTTGT3’ (R = A or G)). The length
of PCR product corresponding to ORF2 sequence was
189 bp (6298nt-6486nt).

3.2 The Incidence Rate of HE in Different Seasons

2.2.3 Biochemical Tests

3.4 Clinical Symptoms and Serum Biochemistry

An automatic biochemical analyzer (Beckman L220) was
used to analyze biochemical parameters, such as ALT,
BUN, TBil, INR, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), total cholesterol (Tchol), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine (Cr), prothrombin activity
(PTA).

Jaundice, fatigue and anorexia were the most common
clinical symptoms, with incidence rates of 85.7% (180/
210), 70.5% (148/210), and 64.7% (136/210), respectively.
Other less common symptoms were also observed,

It was found that 122 and 88 patients were infected with
HE in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Although patients
could be infected throughout a year, the incidence rate
of HE was highest in the first quarter (from January to
March) (Figure 1).
3.3 The Distribution of HE patients’ Gender and Age

Of the 210 patients, 179 cases were male (85.2%) and 31
cases were female (14.8%). The ratio of male to female
was approximately 5.8:1. Ages of the patients ranged
from 17 to 92 years old (48.7 ± 14.9). There was only 1
case under 20 years old (0.5%), 90% of the patients were
over 30 years of age (Figure 2).

2.2.4 Diagnosis of cirrhosis

Forty of 210 patients were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis
before HEV infection, which was established by conventional clinical, biochemical, imaging, and endoscopic criteria[8]. The etiology of cirrhosis in patients was HB 20,
Schistosomiasis 7, alcohol 3, hepatitis C 1, autoimmune
hepatitis 1, alcohol plus HB 5, HB plus Schistosomiasis
1, Schistosomiasis plus alcohol 1, and HB plus Schistosomiasis and alcohol 1 case.
2.2.5 Statistics

Quantitative variables were expressed as means (± SD)
and compared by the Student t-test, or represented as
median (25th percentile-75th percentile). Mann-Whitney
U test was used to compare serum biochemical indicators and c2 or Fisher’s exact test was used to enumeration data. Odds ratio (OR) for all variables was
calculated by univariate and multivariate logistic

including abdominal distention (55/210, 26.2%), nausea
(23/210, 11.0%), vomiting (14/210, 6.7%) and fever (16/
210. 7.6%).
All patients were followed up for six months.
Twenty-one patients died during this period, for a
mortality of 10% (95% CI: 6.63%-14.80%). The main
causes of death were upper gastrointestinal bleeding
(6/21), hepatorenal syndrome (12/21), and hepatic
encephalopathy(3/21). The results of clinical features
and serum biochemistry were summarized in Table 1.
Patients with old ages and liver cirrhosis were more
likely to die than others. The level of TBil, Tchol,
LDH, PTA and INR were significantly different
between died patients and survivors. BUN and Cr,
which reflect the renal function, were higher in the
deceased group than in the survivor group.
From table 2 we can see that age (OR = 1.067), TBil
(OR = 1.010), ALB (OR = 0.781), Tchol (OR = 0.164),
LDH (OR = 1.007), BUN (OR = 1.299), Cr (OR =
1.010), PTA (OR = 0.956), and INR (OR = 6.113) were
the death risk factors of HE. Multivariate analysis of
death risk factors in patients with HE were shown in
Table 3. TBil, BUN, and INR were major risk factors
3.5 The Influence of Liver Cirrhosis on the Prognosis of
Hepatitis E

Compared with hepatitis E infection patients without
liver cirrhosis, the mortality of those with liver cirrhosis
was increased (25% vs.6.47%, P = 0.002). The incidence
of hepatic encephalopathy (6/40 vs. 8/170, p = 0.03),
hepatorenal syndrome (8/40 vs. 5/170, P < 0.001) and
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (24/40 vs. 14/170, P <
0.001) were higher than HEV infected patients without
cirrhosis. The difference of ALT, GGT, ALB, Tchol,
PTA, INR, BUN between two groups was significant as
well (table 4).

The 40 HE patients with cirrhosis were assessed by
Child-Pugh’s score on the basis of reviewing their history, clinical symptoms and laboratory data one month
ago. And this was before presenting HEV infection.
Thirty-two cases (80%) were at the Child-Pugh stage A,
7 cases (17.5%) at the Child-Pugh stage B, and 1 case
(2.5%) at the Child-Pugh stage C, with a mean score of
5.85 ± 1.29. After being in hospital, 4 cases (10%) were
at stage A, 21 cases (52.5%) at stage B, and 15 cases
(37.5%) at stage C, with a mean score of 8.83 ± 1.97.
Child-Pugh’s score of the patients after being in hospital
was significantly worse than the patients before HEV
infection (5.85 ± 1.29 vs. 8.83 ± 1.97, P < 0.001).

4. Discussion
There are four genotypes of HEV, but only one serotype. Genotypes 1 and 2 exclusively infect humans,

whereas genotypes 3 and 4 can also infect other animals,
particularly pigs. Genotype 4 has been proven the dominant genotype in China since the year of 2000[13-16].
In this study, seventy eight (37.14%) of 210 patients had
detectable HEV RNA in their sera. All patients in whom
HEV RNA was isolated were infected with genotype 4,
which was congruent with those from China.
Contaminated drinking water has been served as
sources of several outbreaks of HE in India[17-19]. It
demonstrates that the contaminated water is one important reason for outbreak of HE, therefore outbreaks of
HE were found in rainy or floodwater seasons. However,
in contrast with the outbreak of HE, our data illustrated
that the sporadic HE infection could occur throughout a
year, and exhibited obvious seasonal occurrence. The
incidence of HE in the first quarter of 2007 and 2008
were much higher than that in other quarters. HE is a
zoonotic disease. The strongest evidence of zoonotic
transmission of HE is from Japan[20,21]. Similarly, more
meat in central of China is consumed in the first quarter

of a year, since people in China celebrate their most
important traditional festivals (the Spring Festival and
the Lantern Festival) in the first quarter. So, this may be
a possible reason for the seasonal occurrence. Another
reason is that the weather in central of China in the
first quarter is conducive to virus multiplication and
propagation.
Although HEV and HAV are similar viruses in terms
of the transmission mode and clinical manifestation,
90% of the HE patients were over 30 years of age, and
we saw only one case under age 20 in this study, which
are rather different from the HA patients. The reason
for the difference of the age distribution is could be that
HEV has a much lower secondary attack rate among
exposed household members compared with the stable
HAV (with a secondary attack rate of 20%-50%) [22,23].
Another noticeable feature of HE is that the male
patients were much more than the female patients
(5.8:1). The result is in accordance with other reports.
For example, a nationwide survey of the prevalence of
IgG anti-HEV in qualified blood donors throughout
Japan showed that prevalence of IgG anti-HEV was
higher in men (3.9%) than in women (2.9%) [24]. Similar
results were also reported in Bangladeshi and Taiwan
[25,26]. In this study, jaundice, fatigue and anorexia
were most common clinical manifestations. The mortality was 10.0% in our study, higher than the previously
reported rate of 1% to 3%. This difference may be
mainly due to the sample selection in this study: a considerable proportion of patients whom were hospital
referraled from municipal hospitals were critically ill,
leading to a high mortality in the overall sample (Tongji
hospital is the largest hospital in the middle part of
China).
The multivariate analysis showed that TBil, BUN, and
INR were major risk factors of mortality for HE, which
was useful to assess the prognosis of HE. Infection of
HEV in patients on the base of chronic liver diseases
could make the chronic liver disease more severe, and
cause decomposition and death[27]. Patients with cirrhosis were prone to infect HEV, and the mortality of
HEV infected cirrhotics at 4 weeks and 12 month was
increased compared with that of non-infected cirrhotics
[8]. Our study also showed that the mortality of HEV
infected patients with cirrhosis was higher. And the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome
and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were higher than
HEV infected patients. It reveals that patients with cirrhosis would have a worse condition as well as a poor
prognosis. The hepatic reserve function of cirrhotics
deteriorated after HEV infection.
In conclusion, we found that TBil, BUN, and INR
were major risk factors of mortality of HE based on 210
patients in central of China. Liver cirrhosis could make

And HEV infection could cause decompensation in
patients with cirrhosis. Although the pathogenesis of HE
has not been clarified due to the lack of effective cell or
animal models of HEV infection, the results are helpful
to provide us some ideas for clinical diagnosis, treatment and basic research of HE.
