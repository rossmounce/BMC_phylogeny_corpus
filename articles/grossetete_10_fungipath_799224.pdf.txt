FUNGIpath: a tool to assess fungal metabolic
pathways predicted by orthology
Sandrine Grossetête, Bernard Labedan, Olivier Lespinet*

Abstract
Background: More and more completely sequenced fungal genomes are becoming available and many more
sequencing projects are in progress. This deluge of data should improve our knowledge of the various primary and
secondary metabolisms of Fungi, including their synthesis of useful compounds such as antibiotics or toxic
molecules such as mycotoxins. Functional annotation of many fungal genomes is imperfect, especially of genes
encoding enzymes, so we need dedicated tools to analyze their metabolic pathways in depth.
Description: FUNGIpath is a new tool built using a two-stage approach. Groups of orthologous proteins predicted
using complementary methods of detection were collected in a relational database. Each group was further
mapped on to steps in the metabolic pathways published in the public databases KEGG and MetaCyc. As a result,
FUNGIpath allows the primary and secondary metabolisms of the different fungal species represented in the
database to be compared easily, making it possible to assess the level of specificity of various pathways at different
taxonomic distances. It is freely accessible at http://www.fungipath.u-psud.fr.
Conclusions: As more and more fungal genomes are expected to be sequenced during the coming years,
FUNGIpath should help progressively to reconstruct the ancestral primary and secondary metabolisms of the main
branches of the fungal tree of life and to elucidate the evolution of these ancestral fungal metabolisms to various
specific derived metabolisms.

Background
Currently, the Fungi have more published nuclear genome sequences than any other eukaryotic taxonomic
group [1]. This relative abundance (28 genomes in May
2009) can be explained by their economic significance
and their moderate genome size [Additional File 1].
Since several species are model organisms for fundamental, medical, or agronomical and industrial studies
(e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Yarrowia lipolytica), fungal genomes seem suitable for largescale comparative studies, which will allow their evolution to be elucidated [2-4]. Several teams [5-7] have
already performed extensive comparisons of a few fungal
genomes to predict groups of orthologous proteins,
using published methods such as Inparanoid [8],
OrthoMCL [9] or TribeMcl [10].
However, current information about the number of
fungal enzymes involved in metabolic pathways is rather

scanty and is heterogeneously distributed in major public curated databases, both universal (Swiss-Prot [11])
and specialized (KEGG [12] and MetaCyc [13]). To perform an extensive comparison of these various databases
containing enzymatic information we propose to identify
each enzyme by its ID-EC, which associates its protein
identifier (ID) with the EC number allocated by the
IUBMB [14]. Table 1 illustrates this paucity of knowledge; it shows the respective distributions per species in
both protein databases [11] and pathway databases
[12,13] of ID-ECs and their respective medians in the
animal, plant and fungal kingdoms. Swiss-Prot displays
as many as 335 fungal species containing at least one
ID-EC, but their median values are as low as two IDECs per species (Table 1). In contrast, only 27 fungal
species are included in KEGG (which is restricted to
complete published genomes), but their median values
are as high as 855 ID-ECs per species (Table 1). This
contrast is mainly because the public databases surveyed
in Table 1 include data on S. cerevisiae, which is among
the three best fungal genomes correctly annotated at the

enzymatic level (data not shown). Most other fungi have
limited or null functional annotation, explaining why
the median values are so low in MetaCyc and SwissProt.
This remarkable situation arises largely because there
is currently no tool for large-scale analyses of fungal
metabolism, except for a preliminary attempt to identify
enzymes in pathogenic fungi for a limited number of
metabolic pathways [15]. To cope with this major shortcoming, we designed a tool that allows us to mine genomic data by combining two complementary approaches:
(i) defining reliable groups of orthologous proteins and
(ii) mapping these groups on to the metabolic pathways
that are described in KEGG [12] and MetaCyc [13].

Organizing relevant data for analyzing fungal
metabolic pathways
Identifying enzyme activities requires relevant prediction
of orthologs

As more and more genomic data become available,
homology can be used to reconstruct the metabolic
pathways of newly-sequenced organisms, taking the
pathways of well-studied model organisms such as yeast
as reference. Accordingly, one must identify the amino
acid sequences encoding each step of each pathway in
organisms that have not been studied experimentally
[16-18]. However, there are two major drawbacks in this
transfer of information. First, the accuracy of functional
annotation of many fungal genomes is low because
experimental data are lacking except in the case of yeast
[19-21]. Secondly, it is difficult to predict reliable orthologs among all the putative homologs detected during
exhaustive comparison of pairs of genomes. Numerous
methods have been published but none appears completely infallible (for a recent review, see [22]). Thus, we
decided to apply independent methods to the same
dataset, collect as many potential orthologs as possible,
and then compute their overlap. Exploring several methods raised the probability of finding consistent groups
corresponding to this overlap. Accordingly, we used
three different and complementary approaches based on
similarity searches, and another based on the analysis of
phylogenetic trees of families of homologs.
Searching pertinent orthologs

First, two published methods were used with their
respective default parameters. Inparanoid [8] allows us

to identify the orthologs and the inparalogs (genes
duplicated since the last speciation event) during pairwise genome comparison. OrthoMCL [9] permits consistent strongly-related groups of orthologs (including
inparalogs) to be identified.
Secondly, we improved the classical all-versus-all
BLASTP [23] approach to identifying pairs of best reciprocal hits (BRH) [24] with a dedicated Perl script,
enhancing the definition of orthologs by specifying two
parameters, the alignment percentage and the score
ratio, to filter the BLAST results. Local conservation
was avoided by dividing the alignment length of each
aligned sequence by its total length. The score ratio is
defined as the ratio of the raw BLAST score computed
by aligning a pair of sequences to the raw score of each
sequence against itself (i.e. maximum score). Only
results with score ratios over 0.2 and alignment percentages above 60% were kept for further studies.
These different methods based on sequence similarity
yield various clusters of orthologous proteins that are
more or less stringent depending whether single (e.g.
Inparanoid) or multiple (e.g. BRH [Additional File 2])
links are used to build the orthologous protein groups.
Besides these methods based on similarity approaches,
methods based on phylogenetic analysis have recently
been developed to build orthologous groups [25,26].
Here we chose a phylogenetic approach we had previously developed [25] to obtain groups of orthologous
proteins, using automated analysis of trees of families of
homologous proteins without a reference tree. The
homologous proteins were first detected using BLASTP
[23] with the following constraints: an E-value less than
0.001 and an alignment extending for at least 70% of
the length of the shorter matching protein. For each
family, a multiple alignment was built with Muscle [27],
and the phylogenetic tree deduced was reconstructed
using PhyML [28]. The program Retree from the Phylip
package [29] was further used to root the tree in order
to distinguish orthologs from paralogs using automatic
tree analysis [25].
Table 2 shows a strikingly low overlap between the
results obtained by applying these four methods to the
20 fungal genomes under study. The first column shows
that the highest number of groups of orthologs is
obtained with the BRH method. However, this may be
partly artifactual since BRH is the only method in which

an amino acid sequence can belong to different groups
owing to the formation of multiple links [Additional File
2]. Columns three to six show the relative percentages
shared among the different methods as a double matrix.
The upper matrix shows that the relative percentages of
identical groups are generally low; the highest figure is
22.4% (common to the OrthoMCL and Inparanoid outputs). The lower matrix shows the percentage of groups
that are unique to one of the two methods compared.
The low figures obtained (ranging from 8 to 32.6%) suggest that each method brings specific information. The
highest specificities are found with the phylogenetic
approach, which is indeed the most distinctive of the
four approaches we used.
Identifying biologically relevant groups of orthologs

Although the overlap between these different methods
for detecting orthologs appears narrow, we tried to
build a consensus of the groups of orthologs using both
union and intersection methods. Consideration of all the
orthologs found merged large numbers of proteins
(2,694 proteins in the largest group), with a trend
towards amalgamating sometimes quite distant groups
of orthologs. On the other hand, computing the crude
intersection of the different methods also seemed inadequate (32 proteins in the largest group), since the BRH
approach does not detect the inparalogs found by the
other methods.
To cope with these difficulties, we modified the intersection approach, using a two-step strategy based on
enrichment of the reference groups, i.e. the groups of
orthologs obtained by the crude intersection approach.
Fig. 1 shows a flowchart of our approach. (i) For each
reference group, the sequences were aligned [27] and
their corresponding HMM profile was computed using
the HMMER hmmbuild and hmmcalibrate programs
[30]. To avoid any bias due to the numerous inparalogs
present in some species, only one homologous gene per
genome was conserved as the reference ortholog building the individual HMM profiles. (ii) All the computed
HMM profiles were organized as a database, and each
sequence not included in any reference group was

further compared to the database using the HMMER
hmmpfam program [30] in order to add it to a reference
group using stringent threshold. Indeed, to build sound
final groups, we limited the assignment of a sequence to
a reference group if the E-value was less than a threshold of 10-10 [Additional File 3]. This stringent criterion
allowed a good balance to be kept between sensitivity
(29.2% of the sequences initially not associated with a
reference group were now associated with one) and specificity (64.2% of the sequences initially found by at least
one method but associated with several groups of orthologs were now associated with only one).
In total, we obtained 12,850 final groups of orthologs
(size ≥ 2) that appear biologically relevant, the largest
group containing 297 sequences (see the size distribution in [Additional File 4]). These figures suggest a good
compromise when compared with the values obtained
using the crude union and intersection methods (Table
3). With such a prediction, 57% of the total sequences
were associated with a group of orthologs [Additional
Files 5, 6, and 7]. The mean number of homologous
proteins per genome is close to 1.3 in all final groups,
suggesting that the orthology/paralogy relationships are
quite well resolved by our enrichment approach. Comparison of our ortholog predictions with the four initial
methods (Table 4) shows that our approach gives results
different from each separate method. The highest number of identical groups with FUNGIpath is obtained
with OrthoMCL, whereas the lowest percentage of specific groups is obtained with Inparanoid and BRH.
Assessing the reliability of the predicted final groups of
orthologs

To ascertain the reliability of our predictions further, we
computed a confidence score S for each final group of
orthologous proteins, as follows:
S

10
m

m

i
 O FF,Gi
I

i 1

where m is the number of methods used for orthology
prediction, IF, i is the number of orthologs shared (intersection) between the result of method i and the final
group of orthologs, O F is the number of orthologs in
the final group and Gi is the number of groups obtained
by method i for the set of proteins composing the final
group. This confidence score is based on the assumption
that the reliability of a final group increases with the
number of independent methods that find it. Thus, if
method i predicts the attested group, the score is 1. If
not, the score is greater than 0 and less than or equal to
1. The average score (computed as the sum of scores
for each method divided by the total number of methods m) was scaled from 0-10 by multiplying by 10; the

Figure 1 Flow chart of the construction of orthologous groups. The diagram represents an overview of our annotation process. We applied
four methods of orthologous predictions (BRH, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL and Phylogeny) to 20 fungal genomes. We compared the different groups
(represented in the diagram by the sequences S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5) and we constructed their intersections (represented in the diagram by S1,
S2 and S3). For each intersection, we aligned the sequences using Muscle [27] and built a HMM profile using HMMER [30]. All these HMM
profiles were merged in one file to create a HMM database. Thus, we searched all sequences without a group (S4 and S5 for instance) for
shared similarity with one HMM profile (HMMER hmmpfam program) [30]. According to the E-value, we attributed the sequence (E-value ≤ 10-10)
to the corresponding group or excluded it from that group (E-value > 10-10).

higher the score, the better the agreement among the
four methods. With this scoring approach, the user of
FUNGIpath can evaluate the reliability of each predicted
group of orthologs at any time.

well-studied proteins referenced in reliable public databases can be transferred to homologous unannotated
amino acid sequences. For that purpose, an HMM profile was built for each final group of orthologs after multiple alignment of their sequences [27] and use of the
HMMER programs (hmmbuild and then hmmcalibrate
[30]). We then searched all the HMM profiles against
the sequences annotated with a valid four-digit EC number available in Swiss-Prot release 56.7 using the
HMMER hmmsearch program [30]). The Swiss-Prot
functional annotation was transferred to all members of
a group of orthologs displaying a best hit E-value ≤ 1080
. The E-value threshold was lowered to 10-20 if at least
one sequence of the group of orthologs was already
endowed with the same Swiss-Prot annotation.
This approach allows fungal annotation to be
improved by using the enzymatic annotation of any protein, irrespective of the phylum in which it was first
described. Accordingly, we could transfer 864 EC

numbers to 1399 of the 12850 groups of orthologs; if
the fungal Swiss-Prot annotations were directly transferred, the number of groups would be only 935. This
allowed 160 EC numbers to be added that were not present in fungal genomes in Swiss-Prot [11].
Note that as many as 349 EC numbers (40% of the
total of 864) are present in the 20 genomes.
Numbering pathways defined by KEGG and/or MetaCyc

Once the different putative orthologs had been annotated as described above, we used them to predicting
the different metabolic pathways exhaustively in the
completely sequenced fungi under study. To do that, we
used two reliable public databases, KEGG [12] and
MetaCyc [13], which differ in the way they define
pathways.
KEGG [12] defines so-called reference pathways,
agglomerating related elementary pathways, while MetaCyc [13] is a universal metabolic database that presents
the elementary pathways encoded by various organisms
(1,500) separately, including variants (similar biochemical functions using different biochemical routes or similar sets of reactions). KEGG [12] was used to extract
useful information from the reaction file and to download all corresponding GIF maps. BIOPAX (BIOlogical
PAthway eXchange) files defined in MetaCyc [13] were
downloaded and we automatically generated map pictures by directed graph building. We thus collected 154
reference pathways in KEGG and 1386 elementary pathways in MetaCyc, which define the main anabolic and
catabolic routes.

Challenging the FUNGIpath predictions

To test the soundness of the data computed in FUNGIpath, we compared the predictions made for the model
organism S. cerevisiae with the information published
for the same ID-EC in four curated public databases:
Swiss-Prot (release 56.7) [11], KEGG (version 2009-0202) [12], MetaCyc (release 12.5) [13], and SGD (version
2009-02-10) [31]. Table 5 compares each database
against the four others. Each public database appears to
have its own specificity and the overlaps between pairs
of the databases compared are significantly low, especially in respect of the large differences between the
total numbers of ID-ECs (e.g. 1,101 in KEGG versus 527
in SGD). Table 5 also shows that the percentage of IDECs that are identical between public databases is at
best 60% (KEGG versus Swiss-Prot). Although we
mainly used Swiss-Prot data to predict enzymatic annotation in FUNGIpath, the relative percentage of identical
ID-ECs was only 68%: 16% of Swiss-Prot annotations
were not confirmed by the experimental strategy we
used to build FUNGIpath, while 16% of FUNGIpath
predictions were absent from Swiss-Prot.
To understand these differences better, we looked
more closely at the similarities of EC numbers between
FUNGIpath and the four public databases. Table 6
shows the distribution of identities at each digit of the
shared EC numbers. It appears that the FUNGIpath predictions correspond to more than 80% of the EC numbers found in the other databases. In addition, it can be
seen that almost all the differences are limited to the
fourth digit, corresponding mainly to the nature of the
substrate of the enzyme compared. If we compare our

predictions with a predictor such as PRIAM [32], we
note that 50.9% of the enzymatic annotations are identical and only 6.8% are different (the difference being
mainly in the last EC number digit). The remaining
42.3% are specific to PRIAM (18.6%) or FUNGIpath
(23.7%). Thus, the reliability of the automatic approach
used by FUNGIpath, predicting groups of orthologous
proteins and annotating their enzymatic function, seems
comparable with that of other tools or the independently curated public databases. This is true whether the
functional annotation is based mainly on experimental
data (e.g. SGD) or on sequence similarity (e.g. KEGG).
Moreover, Table 7 shows the level of agreement when
functional annotations for 12 species established by
KEGG [12] and FUNGIpath are compared. Strikingly,
the average number of specific ID-EC predictions is larger in FUNGIpath (1,551) than in KEGG (879) and their
distribution is unexpected. Only 647 (38%) are strictly
identical and 30 more are nearly identical, mostly differing only at the level of the last EC number digit, suggesting that we predicted the right reaction but the
substrate is uncertain [Additional File 8]. Four times
more predictions are specific to FUNGIpath (48%) than
to KEGG (12%). This result is probably not due to any
overprediction effect. Indeed, many enzyme predictions
have been curated manually in S. cerevisiae and in this
case the results are fairly close (15% for KEGG against
26% for FUNGIpath). Moreover, the corresponding figures for Swiss-Prot and FUNGIpath are 17.6% and
13.7%, respectively [Additional Files 9, 10]. To check
whether there is any correlation, we plotted the genome
size and the number of sequences with enzymatic annotations predicted respectively by FUNGIpath and KEGG
(Fig. 2). We obtained a better correlation for the FUNGIpath data (R2 = 0.28), and the slope of the tendency
curve was positive with the FUNGIpath predictions but
negative with the KEGG predictions. Thus, there seems
to be no strong methodological bias that could explain
why the predictions of FUNGIpath are generally far better than those of KEGG and close to those of the wellcurated Swiss-Prot database. In fact, we observed that a
significant number of the Swiss-Prot-specific IDs have
no orthologs in other genomes, explaining why they are
not detected in FUNGIpath. Thus, the high number of
specific FUNGIpath predictions obtained is probably

due to neither under-prediction by KEGG nor overrepresentation by FUNGIpath. Indeed, the average numbers of proteins that are annotated for an enzymatic
reaction in KEGG and FUNGIpath are quite close
(respectively 9.5 and 13.5% [Additional File 11]). The
main reason for the better performance of FUNGIpath
is probably our choice to work only with complete EC
numbers [33], allowing a significant portion of the
incomplete KEGG EC numbers to be recovered. For
instance, 92 (25%) of the 388 incomplete EC numbers in
KEGG have been completed in FUNGIpath. This
enrichment by FUNGIpath is illustrated by comparing
the information given by the different databases for the
KEGG reference pathway ‘terpenoid biosynthesis’ (Fig.
3). When the level of pathway conservation is compared
among the FUNGIpath, KEGG and Swiss-Prot predictions, we observe that this level is globally lowest with
the Swiss-Prot data and higher in KEGG, but the highest
conservation is obtained with FUNGIpath. These differences can be explained by the better annotation of fungal genomes in FUNGIpath.

Using FUNGIpath
FUNGIpath http://www.fungipath.u-psud.fr has been
designed as a user-friendly website. Implemented in
PHP, HTML and Javascript, it allows various aspects of
fungal cell biology to be studied by performing specific
predetermined queries on a PostgreSQL [34] database
containing primary (genome sequences, metabolism
information) and secondary (orthology) data. The
sources of the fungal genomes are indicated in [Additional File 12]. An overview of the database is available
in [Additional File 13].
A few examples of the proposed queries are given
below.
Querying orthologs

It is possible to seek out orthologs present in the full set
of genomes or to restrict queries on specific subsets
defined by taxonomic or other criteria. One can use
either a sequence or its sequence identifier (if available).
Fig. 4a shows a typical output of such queries. Each
resulting group of orthologs is associated with its confidence score (computed as described supra), a putative
function (if any), an EC number (if available), the group

inparalog) IDs belonging to the selected species can also
be displayed. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4b, its multiple
sequence alignment can be computed in the process,
and the topology of its deduced phylogenetic tree can
then be examined, in order to evaluate the predicted
group and to assess its relevance in terms of range of
sequence identity and functional annotation.
For instance, querying the sequence UM03237.1
belonging to the Ustilago maydis genome defines a final
group that is found whichever method is used (confidence score is maximal) and displays an alignment of
quite good quality. Thus, the likelihood of this group of
orthologous proteins seems quite reasonable if we combine the high-level quality of the score and the suitability of its alignment.
Exploring pathways

FUNGIpath further allows the conservation of pathways
between different fungi to be checked and visualized.

This can be done either at the level of a particular step
(corresponding to a defined EC number) in a pathway
or by considering all the steps of a complete pathway.
Figs. 5 and 6 detail the different strategies used by FUNGIpath (see below). Moreover, one can handle a userdefined pathway delineated in a simplified BIOPAX format (data not shown).
Searching a specific step in a pathway

Searching a specific EC number (Fig. 5a) allows the level
of conservation of this enzyme activity in each taxonomic group to be assessed; also the full list of pathways
to which this EC number is predicted to belong can be
obtained directly (Fig. 5b). For instance, Fig. 5 shows
that acylamide amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.1.4) is very well
conserved in fungi and is involved in at least six different pathways in both the KEGG and MetaCyc databases
(Fig. 5b). Since this activity is used in so many pathways
of both primary and secondary metabolisms, it is not
surprising to find this EC number in ten distinct groups
of orthologous proteins ranging in size from 4 to 25
members (data not shown). The distribution of the

different orthologs and inparalogs present in these
groups can be further used to study the evolution of
these different pathways using the approaches described
in Fig. 4.
Searching a complete pathway

It is further possible to assess the level of conservation
of each EC number in a complete pathway. Figs. 6 and
7 illustrate the available queries we propose in order to
analyze primary (e.g. biotin metabolism) and secondary
(e.g. terpenoid biosynthesis) pathways, respectively. The
results are presented as both a KEGG gif map (Figs. 6a
and 7a) and a table listing the presence/absence of each
step in the pathway in the various fungal species (Figs.
6b and 7b), examining the EC numbers associated with
each step. The conservation level of the different steps
in the pathway is indicated by a colour code from dark
red (100%) to white (0%). Groups of orthologous proteins associated with the conserved EC numbers are

listed in the genome features table (Fig. 6c). Note that
rich information is available and can be viewed using
mouse-over facilities on many - ‘explicit’ and ‘implicit’ links; for example, protein sequences can be downloaded for further study.
Fig. 6 shows that only two of the five steps in biotin
biosynthesis are highly conserved. EC 2.8.1.6 is detected
in all the species compared except Aspergillus oryzae
and Magnaporthe grisea. EC 2.6.1.62 is absent from several species (Coprinus cinereus, Puccinia graminis, U.
maydis, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Phycomyces blakesleeanus). Thus, the KEGG reference pathway ‘biotin metabolism’ (Fig. 6a) appears to be
incomplete in many fungi, since several of its specific
enzyme activities (EC 2.3.1.47, 3.5.1.12, 6.2.1.14, 6.2.1.11
and 6.3.3.3) are not found. We may suppose that either
these EC numbers exist in the fungi but are not currently detectable, or the fungi use other enzyme

database. b: The level of conservation among the different groups belonging to different taxonomic groups of fungi is indicated with a colour

activities to catalyse these reactions (see below). Moreover, the further steps in biotinylation catalyzed by the
ligases EC 6.3.4.9, 6.3.4.10, 6.3.4.11, and 6.3.4.15 are
fully conserved in all the main taxonomic groups of
fungi.
Fig. 6c further shows that most of the EC numbers
(blue text) correspond to proteins that have no EC
number assignment in Swiss-Prot but have been annotated in FUNGIpath by orthology prediction. Only two
of the twenty genomes (S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) have an annotation in these two databases
(bold text).
Fig. 7 shows that only six of the 13 EC numbers
involved in the KEGG reference pathway ‘terpenoid biosynthesis’ appear to be conserved among the fungi analyzed. Of these six EC numbers, four (EC 1.14.99.7,
2.5.1.1, 2.5.1.10 and 2.5.1.21) are found in all the species
present in FUNGIpath. Some EC numbers are missing
from only one fungal group: this seems to be the case
for EC 5.3.3.2, which is absent in the Taphrinomycotina

group. Note, however, that this group is represented by
only one species, namely S. pombe. Two EC numbers
(4.2.3.9 in green and 2.5.1.31 in orange) seem to be specific to certain fungi.

Discussion
Fungal metabolism is exceptionally rich and complex [35],
generating a wide variety of secondary metabolic pathways
as these organisms progressively evolved to invade new
ecosystems. Except in a few model organisms, very few
reactions have been studied experimentally. The presentday facility in obtaining complete genome sequences for
organisms that have never been experimentally studied
has revealed a wide gap between the knowledge gained by
disclosing full repertoires of putative amino acid sequences
and ignorance of their actual function.
To close this gap, one needs to transfer functional
annotation to putative sequences by homology using
inductive instead of hypothetico-deductive approaches
(holism versus reductionism) [36]. For metabolism, this

allows entire pathways to be reconstructed [37]. In order
to facilitate the study of fungal metabolism and its evolution, we have created the tool FUNGIpath, which
makes the predictions made on this homology basis
publicly available. Thus, it was necessary to design new
experimental approaches in order to obtain reliable and
sound predictions.
Collecting reliable orthologs

The first requirement was to detect sound orthologs,
knowing that there is no uniquely reliable way to do so
[22]. The most commonly-used approach is bidirectional
best hits (BRH) of BLAST alignment, with imposition of
strict criteria on discriminating E-value over a given
alignment length, but various more sophisticated
approaches have also been developed [22]. Selecting the
best method(s) is not easy. For instance, benchmarking
tests suggested that Inparanoid performs best while
BRH is good for closely-related species [38]. More
recently, BRH was found to give results comparable to
the more sophisticated methods [39], but it is limited to

finding only a single hit among the multiple possible
links between paralogs.
We therefore preferred to use several different
approaches simultaneously, three based on sequence
similarity and one on phylogeny, to obtain robust
results. Since the overlap between the outputs of these
four methods is very narrow (a result underlining how
conflicting these orthology methods are), we enriched
the data found in the intersection of the different methods with a HMM approach. This allowed us to obtain
fairly coherent sets of reliable orthologs forming welldefined groups that are of adequate size (the largest
containing only 297 sequences) and biologically relevant.
Using reliable orthologs to improve functional annotation

The second requirement for exploiting these orthology
data to predict metabolic pathways in fungal species
that have never been studied experimentally was to
assign a functional annotation to each group of orthologous proteins. To do that, a correspondence was established between a group and an EC number, defining an

Figure 7 Exploring pathways using a specific pathway name. The ‘terpenoid biosynthesis’ reference pathway defined by KEGG was searched
against all 20 genomes available in the database. a: Each EC number has been coloured according to its global level of conservation as in Figs. 5
and 6. Two EC numbers (2.5.1.31 and 4.2.3.9) specific to this pathway (indicated by a yellow star) are not detected in all species studied. b: This
table lists the percentage conservation of each EC number in this pathway among all taxonomic groups of fungi. Its global presence in all

enzyme catalyzing a specific step in a known pathway
included in the KEGG and MetaCyc databases. Figs. 5
and 6 show how group(s) of orthologs responsible(s) for
a specific enzyme can be found and how this EC number is distributed in the different genomes. Inter alia,
the multiple sequence alignment and the deduced phylogenetic tree can be obtained for each family of orthologs and inparalogs encoding this EC number in the
fungi compared. We have provided evidence that FUNGIpath is a reliable tool for annotating enzyme function
in an automatically predicted group of orthologous proteins. It gives data that are either comparable to those
of the independently curated public databases or, in
many cases, better (see Table 6). At any rate, most of
the differences appear to be limited to the fourth digit,
corresponding mainly to the nature of the substrates of
the enzymes compared.
FUNGIpath is also useful for finding the set of orthologs that constitutes an entire pathway. This allows us

to determine whether all the steps of the pathway have
been predicted and, if so, in how many of the genomes
compared that pathway is complete. Indeed, one of the
main problems encountered in trying to reconstruct
entire pathways from orthology data is the occurrence
of missing data [40] such as pathway holes [41]. The
absence of an EC number (orphan metabolic activities
[42]) may be due to a low percentage identity of the
corresponding amino acid sequence or to its replacement with another protein. Alternatively, the simultaneous absence of several EC numbers that belong to a
specific pathway would suggest that the entire pathway
is absent from the species concerned. This is the case,
for instance, in the later steps in the KEGG reference
pathway ‘terpenoid biosynthesis’, where the last three
EC numbers are missing (Fig. 7a). However, it is possible that this absence may simply be due to a major
annotation problem or to the replacement of this pathway with an alternate, undetected, one.

Grossetête et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:81
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/81

Overall, FUNGIpath appears to be a useful and innovative tool for helping to resolve some artifactual pathway holes. For instance, it is unique in annotating a
group of orthologs found in six species as EC 4.2.3.9
(Fig. 3), aristolochene synthase. No such amino acid
sequences are predicted in Swiss-Prot, KEGG or MetaCyc, but the presence of aristolochene synthase has
been demonstrated experimentally in two fungi not
included in FUNGIpath [43,44], supporting our
prediction.

Conclusions
FUNGIpath appears to be a reliable tool for the analysis
of fungal metabolism. It will be especially useful for
annotating newly-sequenced genomes of poorly-studied
organisms.
Moreover, it allows the respective metabolisms of various taxa to be compared easily. For instance, 101 EC
numbers are found uniquely in ascomycetes (data not
shown) and may help to delineate the metabolic specificities of the last common ancestor of this group.
As more and more genomes are expected to be
decrypted in the near future, tools such as FUNGIpath
will be very useful for the progressive reconstruction of
primary and secondary metabolisms in the ancestors of
the main branches of the present-day fungal tree and
for elucidating the evolution of various specific derived
metabolisms. FUNGIpath will be updated regularly (at
least twice a year) with newly published fungal genomes.
