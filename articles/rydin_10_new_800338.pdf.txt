A new Early Cretaceous relative of Gnetales:
Siphonospermum simplex gen. et sp. nov. from the
Yixian Formation of Northeast China
Research article

Catarina Rydin*1 and Else Marie Friis2

Abstract
Background: Knowledge on fossil and evolutionary history of the Gnetales has expanded rapidly; Ephedra and
ephedroids as well as the Gnetum-Welwitschia clade are now well documented in the Early Cretaceous. However,
hypotheses on evolutionary relationships among living and fossil species are hampered by restricted knowledge of
morphological variation in living groups and recent studies indicate that gnetalean diversity and character evolution
may be more complex than previously assumed and involve additional extinct groups (Bennettitales, Erdtmanithecales
and unassigned fossil taxa).
Results: Here we describe a new fossil related to Gnetales, Siphonospermum simplex from the Early Cretaceous Yixian
Formation, an impression/compression of a reproductive shoot. The slender main axis bears one pair of opposite and
linear leaves with primary parallel venation. The reproductive units are ovoid, without supporting bracts and borne on
one median and two lateral branches. The most conspicuous feature of the fossil is the long, thread-like micropylar
tube formed by the integument. Each ovule is surrounded by two different layers representing one or two seed
envelopes; an inner sclerenchymatous layer and an outer probably parenchymatous layer.
Conclusions: The vegetative and reproductive features of Siphonospermum simplex exclude a relationship to any other
group than the Gnetales. A combination of opposite phyllotaxis, linear leaves and ovules surrounded by seed
envelope(s) and with a long exposed micropylar tube are known only for extant and extinct Gnetales. Siphonospermum
simplex constitutes a new lineage within the Gnetales. Its morphology cannot be directly linked to any previously
known plant, but the organization of the reproductive units indicates that it belongs to the Gnetum-Welwitschia clade.
Based on the absence of cone bracts and the inferred histology of the seed envelope(s) it could be related to Gnetum,
however, there are also affinities with the ephedran lineage, some of which are likely plesiomorphic features, others
perhaps not. Phylogeny and character evolution in the Bennettitales, Erdtmanithecales and Gnetales are currently only
partly understood and under debate; the exact systematic position of Siphonospermum simplex, i.e., its position within
the Gnetales, cannot be resolved with certainty.
Background
The Gnetales comprise about 65-75 species in three genera (Ephedra L., Gnetum L., Welwitschia Hook. f.) [1]. It
has long been assumed that the extant species are relictual remnants of a former greater diversity [[2], and others], and the rapidly expanding documentation of
gnetalean fossils from the Early Cretaceous supports this
idea. The Gnetales are reported from the Early Creta* Correspondence: Catarina.Rydin@systbot.uzh.ch

ceous of many parts of the world [3-16]. There are, in
addition, fossils with a gnetalean affinity that are difficult
to assign to any of the extant lineages [e.g., [17-20]] and a
large diversity of pre-Cretaceous fossils, which have been
discussed as potentially related to the Gnetales, but for
which a precise systematic affinity remains to be established [e.g., [21,22]].
The members of the extant clade are characterized by
several unique features [23-26], for example, decussate
phyllotaxis, compound reproductive structures, polyplicate pollen and a single terminal unitegmic ovule with a
resistant micropylar tube formed by the integument. The

ovule is surrounded by structure(s) of bract origin (i.e.,
seed envelope[s]) and the micopylar tube reaches beyond
the seed envelope and serves as the pollen receiving area
[e.g., [26]]. Ephedra has retained many ancestral features,
but can be defined by specialized pollen characters [27]
and apical papillae on the seed envelope [28,29]. The sister group of Ephedra, the Gnetum-Welwitschia clade, is
defined e.g., by the presence of an embryo feeder, higher
order venation and many anatomical, histological and
developmental details [23,30]. Assigning a fossil to either
of the two major groups of the Gnetales is thus often
straight forward due to the presence of these clear synapomorphies, but resolving higher level relationships
among living and fossil taxa has proven difficult, partly
due to restricted knowledge of phylogeny and morphological variation among living species. Further, it has
lately been suggested that the Gnetales belong to a larger
clade [the BEG-clade sensu Friis et al., see [31]], which
also comprises the Bennettitales, the Erdtmanithecales
and several unassigned fossil taxa [14,18,31]. The BEG
hypothesis has been questioned [32]; interpretations of
the integument in Bennettitales differ between authors,
but nevertheless, evolutionary patterns in the Gnetales
and potential stem lineages are obviously more complex
than previously recognized.
In this study we add to the knowledge of gnetalean
diversity in the Early Cretaceous. We describe and discuss an impression/compression fossil from the Liaoning
province of north-eastern China collected in Early Cretaceous sediments of the Yixian Formation.

Results
The type material of Siphonospermum simplex comprises
two impression/compression fossils of a female plant,
part and counterpart, with remnants of oxidized organic
material (Figure 1). Few anatomical details are preserved,
but lignified tissues can be observed. The total preserved
length is about 25 mm. The branch bearing the cluster of
ovules is about 0.5 mm thick and has one pair of opposite
leaves. Leaves are linear, at least 10-13 mm long and 0.30.4 mm wide, and with remains of three primary veins.
Three reproductive units are positioned terminally on
one median and two lateral branches and are naked, without supporting bracts (Figure 1).
Reproductive units are about 8-9 mm long and 1.5-2
mm wide, narrowly ovoid with a rounded base and an
extended acuminate apex (Figure 2a). Each ovule is surrounded by two distinct layers, which represent one or
two seed envelopes (Figures 2b, Figure 3). The outermost
layer is seen as an imprint in apical parts of the ovules. It
is about 0.3-0.5 mm thick. The innermost layer appears
massive with remnants of coaly matter. Numerous supportive strands form a pattern with dichotomies and

total length of the micropyle is about 4.5-5.5 mm and the
exposed part about 2.5-3.5 mm. The nucellus is not
observed.

pylar tube is straight, appears sturdy, and extends out of
the seed envelope(s) at a slight angle. It is nearly equal in
width throughout its length (Figure 2b); its diameter is
about 0.2 mm proximally and about 0.1 mm distally. The

The vegetative and reproductive features of the new fossil
exclude a relationship to any other group than the Gnetales. Ovules surrounded by one or two seed envelopes
and with the integument extended into a long exposed
micropylar tube are known only for extant and extinct
Gnetales, for at least some members of the Bennettitales
[14,18,31] and for a number of extinct plants thought to
be closely related to Gnetales: i.e., the Erdtmanithecales
[33] and a number of unassigned taxa based on dispersed
seeds, such as Buarcospermum, Lignierispermum, Lobospermum, Rugonella [14]Raunsgaardispermum [18].
A close relationship with the Bennettitales can be ruled
out based on vegetative as well as reproductive characters. The Bennettitales have ovules borne on long stalks,
like Siphonospermum simplex, but the Bennettitales are
otherwise distinct from Siphonospermum in having
ovules borne in densely crowded heads and interspersed
with fleshy interseminal scales. The Bennettitales are further distinguished by their typically larger and compound
leaves. The Erdtmanithecales are known only from dispersed reproductive structures (seeds, male organs, pollen) [see summary e.g., in [13]]. The seeds of
Erdtmanithecales are distinguished by their three-valved
seed envelope, but further comparison with Erdtmanithecales is not possible.
Higher level relationship of Siphonospermum simplex
(its systematic position within the Gnetales) is more difficult to establish due to the restricted amount of preserved information. Its morphology differs substantially
from that of other gnetalean fossils from the Yixian Formation, which have compound cones comprising cone
bracts and seeds [7,11,12]. They are generally interpreted
as close relatives of Ephedra. In contrast, the reproductive
units of Siphonospermum consist only of single ovules
(with surrounding envelope[s]); there are no supporting
bracts.
The long and conspicuous micropylar tubes of Siphonospermum are well preserved and have not been bent or
curled during fossilization. Their walls are prominent
(Figure 2b) and one tube (Figure 2a, left ovule) is broken
at the apical level of the seed envelope. In Ephedra, Gnetum and Welwitschia, the inner epidermis of the micropylar tube is strongly thickened, probably lignified [[34],
and pers. obs.], and the same appears to hold for Siphonospermum. Conceivably, the thickening and support for
the micropylar tube have been important in the Gnetales
in order to withstand visits from pollinators. Nothing is
known about the pollination biology of Siphonospermum,

Rydin and Friis BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:183
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/183

but in extant Gnetales, pollination drops secreted via the
micropylar tube serve as reward for pollinators (mainly
Dipterans and Hymenopterans) [35-38]. Abiotic pollination is probably also important, at least in Ephedra
[38,39].
Vegetative characters of Siphonospermum simplex are
similar to extant Ephedra, with striate, erect stems and
linear leaves opposite at nodes and with joined bases.
However, these characters are not unique to Ephedra, but
are general (ancestral) characters of the Gnetales, at least
partly present also in Gnetum, Welwitschia and other
gnetalean fossils [e.g., [4,12]]. The venation of the leaves
of Siphonospermum is difficult to assess with certainty
due to poor preservation and slightly folded leaves. There
are three primary veins and perhaps also second order
venation. The latter feature is interesting because it is a
derived feature within the Gnetales, which characterizes
the Gnetum-Welwitschia clade. Extant Ephedra species
have two primary veins in leaves and cone bracts and so
have most Early Cretaceous ephedroids such as Liaoxia
[12,40]. One ephedroid fossil, Liaoxia robusta [12], has
three or four primary veins but second order venation is
unknown in fossil ephedroids as well as in extant Ephedra.
Siphonospermum has several features in common with
Gnetum. The "reticulate" venation of Gnetum leaves
develops from successive dichotomies in 5-10 parallel
veins located in the centre of the leaf [41] and basically,
the venation pattern of Siphonospermum is not different
from that seen in Gnetum. The reproductive units of
Siphonospermum have a similar shape as those of Gnetum
and are (like in Gnetum) completely exposed with no
remnants of cone bracts. Weak impressions of a structure
at the lower left of the reproductive unit with the broken
micropylar tube (Figure 2a, arrow 4) are not remains of a
bract but reflect the original position of the ovule. This
reproductive unit appears to have been detached and
slightly displaced.
In Gnetum the nucellus is surrounded by three structures, an integument that forms the extending micropylar
tube, a sclerenchymatous inner seed envelope and a second seed envelope, composed of parenchymatous cells
and sclereids [42,43]. In Siphonospermum, the integument is surrounded by a persistent coalified tissue and its
preservation mode indicates that it is sclerenchymatous.
In the acuminate apex region, there are weak impressions
of an additional tissue. There are no remains of sclerenchymatous tissue in this zone; it has obviously only left an
imprint without cellular remains, which suggests soft tissue.
Further, the numerous supportive strands in the sclerenchymatous zone form a pattern with dichotomies and
anastomoses, which is very similar to that formed by vascular bundles in the "endotesta" of Gnetum [44]. In the

Page 4 of 6

Gnetales, vascular bundles are absent in the integument
but present in the seed envelopes [24], which supports
our interpretation that the supportive strands of Siphonospermum are originally derived from the seed envelope.
Conflicting information and uncertain evolutionary
relationships

An evolutionary origin of the spikes of Gnetum, with sessile reproductive units arranged in whorls, from the
pedunculate and solitary units of Siphonospermum, could
be hypothesized by introducing hypothetical steps. However, there are several noteworthy differences between
Siphonospermum and Gnetum, which make evolutionary
relationships uncertain. First, the linear leaves and
arrangements of the reproductive units are different from
those of Gnetum (but likely plesiomorphic features in the
Gnetales). Second, in Gnetum the micropylar tube is
closed by radially expanding cells of the integument [45],
whereas the micropylar tubes of Ephedra and Welwitschia are hollow [28,42] (and pers. obs.). In Siphonospermum, the micropylar tube is isodiametric and there are
no indications of a closure tissue. Third, it is not possible
to say if the outermost tissue of the reproductive units of
Siphonospermum represents an additional seed envelope
like in Gnetum [24], or an outer parenchymatous zone of
a single seed envelope like in most species of Ephedra
[34].
Thus, several seemingly "ephedroid" features of Siphonospermum may instead be plesiomorphic in the Gnetales, and retained in Siphonospermum. The general
structure of the reproductive units indicates a sister relationship with Gnetum. If so, the closure tissue in the
micropylar tube is a unique feature for Gnetum [and at
least some species of Bennettitales [45]], not shared by
Siphonospermum (or is missing in Siphonospermum
because of an early stage of development). Alternatively,
Siphonospermum could be sister to the Gnetum-Welwitschia clade; further studies of the diversity in the Gnetales
and related taxa, and a better understanding of character
evolution, are needed to elucidate higher level relationships among living and fossil species and the exact phylogenetic position of Siphonospermum simplex.

Conclusions
The new Early Cretaceous impression/compression fossil
described here, Siphonospermum simplex, possesses several key characters that suggest a close relationship with
Gnetales and more specifically with the Gnetum-Welwitschia clade. Ovules borne without subtending cone bracts
but with a possible second seed envelope indicate a relationship with Gnetum. However, there are also differences between Gnetum and Siphonospermum, most
importantly the apparent absence of closure tissue in the
micropylar tube.

Character evolution in the Gnetales and related extinct
taxa is not fully understood. Often, a mixture of characters previously thought to be diagnostic for either the
Ephedra lineage, the Gnetum-Welwitschia clade, or the
Bennettitales, are seen in recently described charcoalified
seeds [14,18] and the same is true for the new fossil presented here. Siphonospermum simplex clearly constitutes
a new evolutionary lineage within the Gnetales, perhaps
sister to Gnetum or to the Gnetum-Welwitschia clade, but
its precise systematic position can currently not be
resolved with certainty.

Methods
The fossil material described here was collected from the
Yixian Formation by a local collector and occurs as part
and counterpart on a slab of finely laminated light grey to
yellowish siltstone. The fossil is preserved as compressions/impressions with only little organic material
remaining. No detailed locality information was attached
to the specimen, but examination of the lithology suggests that the fossil was collected from the Jianshangou
locality (Beipiao, Chaoyang City, west Liaoning) from the
lower part of the Yixian Formation (Wang Xiaolin, personal communication 2006). In the present work we leave
the exact provenance open and refer broadly to the Yixian
Formation of Northeast China.
The Yixian Formation is widely distributed in the western part of the Liaoning Province, but outcrops also in

Page 5 of 6

northern Hebei and Inner Mongolia. The age is established by radiometric dating to about 125 - 120 Ma [see
summary in [46]], corresponding to the Early Aptian-earliest Late Aptian [47]. The exceptionally rich fauna and
flora are important constituents of the Jehol Biota. The
fauna is particularly well preserved and includes a diversity of invertebrates, osteichthyan fish, amphibians, mammals and reptiles including feathered dinosaurs and early
birds [48]. The flora is also diverse [7,49], but generally
the preservation of the plant fossils is not as good as for
the fossil animals. Fossil plants related to Gnetales are
particularly diverse [7,11,12,40] (and the new fossil
described here). Most gnetalean fossils are ephedroid, but
none of them possesses defining characters of extant
Ephedra and most of them have been assigned to various
species of the extinct genus Liaoxia.
