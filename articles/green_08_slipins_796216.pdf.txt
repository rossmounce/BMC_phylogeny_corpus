Abstract
Background: Stomatin is a membrane protein that was first isolated from human red blood cells.
Since then, a number of stomatin-like proteins have been identified in all three domains of life. The
conservation among these proteins is remarkable, with bacterial and human homologs sharing 50
% identity. Despite being associated with a variety of diseases such as cancer, kidney failure and
anaemia, precise functions of these proteins remain unclear.
Results: We have constructed a comprehensive phylogeny of all 'stomatin-like' sequences that
share a 150 amino acid domain. We show these proteins comprise an ancient family that arose
early in prokaryotic evolution, and we propose a new nomenclature that reflects their phylogeny,
based on the name "slipin" (stomatin-like protein). Within prokaryotes there are two distinct
subfamilies that account for the two different origins of the eight eukaryotic stomatin subfamilies,
one of which gave rise to eukaryotic SLP-2, renamed here "paraslipin". This was apparently acquired
through the mitochondrial endosymbiosis and is widely distributed amongst the major kingdoms.
The other prokaryotic subfamily gave rise to the ancestor of the remaining seven eukaryotic
subfamilies. The highly diverged "alloslipin" subfamily is represented only by fungal, viral and ciliate
sequences. The remaining six subfamilies, collectively termed "slipins", are confined to metazoa.
Protostome stomatin, as well as a newly reported arthropod subfamily slipin-4, are restricted to
invertebrate groups, whilst slipin-1 (previously SLP-1) is present in nematodes and higher metazoa.
In vertebrates, the stomatin family expanded considerably, with at least two duplication events
giving rise to podocin and slipin-3 subfamilies (previously SLP-3), with the retained ancestral
sequence giving rise to vertebrate stomatin.
Conclusion: Stomatin-like proteins have their origin in an ancient duplication event that occurred
early on in the evolution of prokaryotes. By constructing a phylogeny of this family, we have
identified and named a number of orthologous groups: these can now be used to infer function of
stomatin subfamilies in a meaningful way.

Background
Human stomatin (hstomatin) was first identified as an
integral membrane protein in human red blood cells [13]. It has since been shown to be expressed in many cell

types and organisms, although hstomatin function
remains unclear [4]. Loss of stomatin in humans is associated with a condition called overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, in which the red blood cells leak Na+ and K+

ions [5], although the hstomatin gene is not mutated in
these patients [6]. Other human proteins showing high
similarity to human stomatin (> 50 %) have also been
described. Human stomatin-like protein-2 (hSLP-2) is a
39 kDa, widely expressed, oligomeric, peripheral membrane protein that associates with the spectrin-actin
cytoskeleton in the red cell [7]. It has recently been shown
to be overexpressed in a variety of human tumours [8],
being one of the 16 most upregulated proteins in superinvasive cancer cells, although its function is again
unknown [9]. Human stomatin-like protein-3 (hSLP-3),
an olfactory neuronal protein [10], shares 84 % similarity
with hstomatin and is important for the function of skin
mechanoreceptors in the mouse [11]. Podocin is 73 %
similar to hstomatin and, like stomatin, is raft associated
[12]. Podocin is expressed exclusively in the kidneys,
where it is localised to the membrane of podocytes; these
are specialised cells involved in the ultrafiltration of blood
[13]. Mutations in the podocin gene (NPHS2) result in
nephritic syndrome, in which protein appears in the
urine; the end stage of this condition is renal failure [14].
The final member of this putative family is human stomatin-like protein-1 (hSLP-1), which differs from the other
stomatin proteins in that it is a bipartite protein that contains a stomatin-like region fused to a non-specific lipid
transfer protein [15].
Stomatin-like proteins are not confined to humans. Work
on Caenorhabditis elegans has identified at least nine proteins showing similarity to human stomatin. One of these,
UNC-24, is necessary for the movement of another protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane [16] and has recently been shown to share a
common ancestor with hSLP-1 [17]. The apicomplexan
parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains a stomatin-like
protein that co-localises with invasion-associated rhoptry
organelles and is involved in the formation of the invasion vacuole during infection of red blood cells [18]. Of
particular interest to us is the prokaryotic group of stomatin-like proteins. These were first identified by You and
Borthakur [19] who showed, through a mutagenesis
screen, that a stomatin-like protein was involved in the
competitiveness of Rhizobium etli for nodulation of the
roots of Phaseolus vulgaris. The widespread distribution of
stomatins and their associated diseases strongly suggests
that their biological functions are of great importance, yet
to date these remain unclear. If we are to understand the
function of human stomatins by studying these proteins
in other organisms then it is important that we can distinguish sequences that have evolved by speciation (orthologues) from those that have evolved by duplication
(paralogues): to achieve this end we need a stomatin family phylogeny. So far, stomatin family evolution has
always been considered in the context of a superfamily
involving stomatins, prohibitins, flotillins and HflK/C

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/44

proteins [20] and plant disease response genes [21]. However, more recently this superfamily concept has been
revisited, and is now regarded to have little phylogenetic
support [22]. It is therefore likely that similarity among
members is a result of convergent evolution and not
shared ancestry.
In this paper we have chosen to undertake a phylogenetic
analysis of stomatin-like proteins only. Our results reveal
an intriguing story of ancient origin, duplication and
diversification of stomatin family members and identifies
candidate organisms that should be used when attempting to understand stomatin function outside of primate
systems.

Results
Two Different Origins of Eukaryotic Stomatins
Blast searches for hstomatin and hSLP-2 revealed highly
similar proteins in prokaryotes, both in archaea and bacteria (Table 1). Proteins showing high similarity to hSLP2 were also identified in eukaryotes, although SLP-2 distribution is confined to specific organisms among the
fungi and protista and only becomes well represented in
plant and metazoan lineages. In contrast, proteins showing high similarity to hstomatin were only found in
prokaryotes, fungi, ciliates and animals. SLP-3 and
podocin proteins were again found to be restricted to specific metazoan species (Table 1).

Using the amino acid sequences retrieved by the blast
searches, a phylogeny was created using both neighbour
joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods to
get an overview of the relationships among the various
family members (Figure 1). In both cases an essentially
congruent topology was generated, with the phylogeny
identifying at least four distinct groups: SLP-2 proteins, pstomatin proteins, a group uniting fungi, ciliates and an
Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus sequence, and a group
containing only animal subfamilies. Bootstrap support
for the internal branches is mostly good. The branching
order of eukaryotic subfamilies in Figure 1 is addressed
later by constructing smaller trees with longer alignments.
P-stomatin proteins form a paraphyletic group in Figure 1,
but this is poorly supported (< 75 %) and is in conflict
with the NJ phylogeny, where p-stomatin proteins were
recovered as a well supported group (74 %). Archaeal SLP2 proteins form a paraphyletic group with the inclusion of
bacteria, whilst bacterial SLP-2 proteins form another paraphyletic group with the inclusion of eukaryotes. Both ML
and NJ methods support the rickettsia-eukaryotic SLP-2
group, although their position within this clade is much
less resolved.
From Figure 1 it is clear that not all stomatin family proteins are equally related. Indeed, SLP-3 is much more sto-

matin-like than SLP-2, yet current nomenclature does not
reflect this. To make this distinction clear we propose to
split the stomatin family into four major groups: slipins
(stomatin-like proteins), eoslipins ('eo' from Greek eos
meaning dawn), alloslipins ('allo' from Greek allos meaning other) and paraslipins (paralogous stomatin-like proteins). The phylogenies we present here reveal slipin
subfamilies to include stomatin, podocin, slipin-1 (not
shown, previously SLP-1), slipin-3 (previously SLP-3), slipin-4 and protostome stomatin. The former SLP-2 proteins become paraslipins whilst p-stomatin proteins
become eoslipins. From this point forwards, the stomatin
subfamilies will be named according to this new nomenclature, which is clarified in Figure 2.
Paraslipin Subfamily Phylogeny
In order to obtain a better-resolved phylogeny of paraslipin proteins, an alignment excluding all other subfamilies

was constructed and this was used to build a maximumlikelihood phylogeny (Figure 3). The evolution of
prokaryotic paraslipins deserves detailed consideration,
but we confine ourselves here to the briefest outline as
context for the eukaryotic paraslipins. The phylogenetic
tree shows two major clades, both of which contain bacterial species. The upper clade contains both archaeal and
bacterial species, with archaea forming a clade that
appears to branch within bacteria. Although related species are generally grouped together, such as the Cyanobacteria and the Firmicutes, the tree is inconsistent in several
respects with the consensus phylogeny based on ribosomal and other core genes [23] suggesting prokaryotic
paraslipin has encountered various gene duplication and
lateral transfer events.
The lower paraslipin clade contains both bacterial and
eukaryotic species. Representatives of the gamma Proteo-

bacteria, Chlorobi and Spirochetes each have two, divergent copies of prokaryotic paraslipin suggesting an early
duplication event. A very significant feature of the lower
group is the strong support (100 %) for a monophyletic
group containing Rickettsiales and eukaryotic paraslipins,
with Rickettsiales forming the sister group to the eukaryotic clade. This suggests a possible mitochondrial origin of
eukaryotic paraslipins. Within eukaryotes we see a mostly
well-resolved phylogeny with many of the major taxonomic groups being recovered as monophyletic. As
expected, fungi form the sister group to metazoa with

plants and protists falling outside of this Opisthokont
clade [24]; the ecdysozoan group of insects and nematodes is not supported, but neither is it significantly contradicted.
Protostome stomatins
Much of the work on the stomatin family has concentrated on a group of C. elegans proteins that were identified in a screen to identify touch-insensitive mutants [25].
With this in mind, we wanted to construct a comprehensive phylogeny of invertebrate stomatins. Within invertebrates it is evident that a large number of gene duplication
events have occurred. Constructing a single phylogeny of
all invertebrate slipin sequences proved problematic due
to a large number of long-branched, species-specific paralogues. To overcome this problem, smaller phylogenies of
closely related taxa were first constructed to identify
orthologous groups; these were subsequently combined
to give the phylogeny in Figure 4. Ciona intestinalis
sequences were included to allow comparison with Figure
5, whilst cnidarian sequences were used to root this phylogeny. Within Figure 4 we see two main clusters. One
such group contains arthropods, annelids, the mollusc
Lottia gigantea and the nematode C. elegans, and we tentatively name this group protostome stomatin as a consequence of it members and short branch lengths, despite
the low bootstrap for this clade. The other group concerns
only arthropods and appears much more divergent than
protostome stomatin, but nevertheless recovers the same
insect phylogeny; this group we have named slipin-4.
Vertebrate Stomatins
From Figure 1 it was apparent that many stomatin subfamilies arose within the vertebrate lineage. To try to

sequences, two separate phylogenies were constructed
and are shown in Figure 5. The first phylogeny was based
on an alignment of chordate and echinoderm sequences,
and this was rooted with slipin-4 and protostome stomatin sequences. Although poorly supported, chordate and
protostome sequences form separate groups.
To gain more information about the duplication events
that occurred within the vertebrate portion of our tree, a

vertebrate-specific phylogeny were constructed that
allowed for a longer alignment (Figure 5, shaded box).
Stomatin sequences from the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the urochordate Ciona intestinalis were
included so that an approximate time frame for the origin
of these subfamilies could be established. The vertebratespecific phylogeny recovers the same topology as seen if
slipin-4 and protostome sequences are included but, in
addition, provides strong support (87 %) for the monophyly of vertebrate subfamilies with the Ciona intestinalis

sequences forming the sister group. Within vertebrates
there are three well-supported monophyletic groups.
Podocin proteins form the most basal vertebrate group
and are clearly quite divergent from the other subfamilies,
as judged by their long branch. The other two clades
group stomatin and slipin-3 proteins into two wellresolved clusters. In each case the three clades support
congruent phylogenies, although not all vertebrates were
found to have all proteins (Table 1). However, recently
derived paralogues may be substituting for the function of
missing genes.

In order to make a meaningful functional assignment to a
protein family it is important to characterise the ancestral
and derived motifs. To achieve this end, consensus
sequences were generated and aligned for each of the proteins identified in monophyletic groups in Figures 1, 2, 3,
4 (Figure 6). The alignment supports the premise that
these proteins are members of the same family, as judged
by the length of the alignment (150 aa) and the degree of
shared conservation. Paraslipin proteins are quite different from the other family members and lack many of the
conserved motifs that are shared by the other subfamilies.
In terms of sequence conservation, eoslipin sequences
most resemble slipin subfamilies and share at least three
conserved motifs (red line in Figure 6) to the exclusion of
alloslipins. Interestingly, many of the major difference
between the stomatin subfamilies occur within the C-terminus region; for example, all podocin proteins can be
characterised by a unique five amino acid motif (KDSPM)
present in their C-terminus, whilst paraslipins share an
AxAxA motif.

Discussion
Our analyses suggest that the stomatin family is a sound
concept, with all its members showing high levels of
sequence conservation over a region of 150 amino acids.
Eukaryotic stomatin proteins have two independent
prokaryotic origins: one gave rise to all eukaryotic paraslipin proteins, whilst the other gave rise to the remaining
subfamilies (alloslipin, slipin-1, slipin-3, slipin-4, protostome stomatin, stomatin and podocin).
The stomatin family first arose in prokaryotes (Figure 1).
It is supposed that paraslipin and eoslipin are ancient paralogues that evolved from an ancestral sequence, possibly
present in LUCA (last universal common ancestor) (Figure 7). Evidence for their homology lies in their sequence
similarity (Figure 6) and their genomic organisation.
Green et al. (2004) showed a conserved genomic association between eoslipin and a serine protease. Within
prokaryotic genomes the gene encoding paraslipin has a
conserved genomic association with a gene encoding only
the C-terminus of the serine protease [26]. It is therefore

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/44

probable that these two gene clusters share a common
ancestor and arose by duplication. The ancientness of this
duplication is supported by the observation that eoslipin
and paraslipin proteins, as well as their gene partners, are
present in both archaea and bacteria, with the bipartition
that separates eoslipins and paraslipins being one of the
most internal branches in our phylogeny (Figure 1).
Although eoslipins are more similar in sequence to stomatins than to paraslipins, we avoid the term 'prokaryotic
stomatins' because they are not exclusively related to the
stomatins. Indeed, since the root of the tree is uncertain,
we are unable to show formally that eoslipins are the sister
group of the slipins rather than of the paraslipins.
Figure 3 presents strong support for the transfer of paraslipin (lower clade, Figure 3) into eukaryotes from a rickettsia-like proteobacterium. The source could plausibly have
been the progenitor of the mitochondrion [27]. This
hypothesis is further supported by the observation that
paraslipin is present within the rat mitochondrial proteome [28] and shows a significant decrease in expression
in mitochondria devoid of DNA [29]. It is also interesting
to note that the only protist species we found not to
encode paraslipin were the amitochondriates Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis and the distantly related
Entamoeba histolytica [30,31]. Once acquired by eukaryotes, paraslipin evolved with very little gene duplication
and became taxonomically widespread (Table 1, Figure
3).
The eukaryotic slipin and alloslipin subfamilies probably
evolved from a common ancestor shared by archaea and
eukaryotes, to the exclusion of bacteria, although our phylogeny is too poorly resolved at present to support such a
hypothesis. The discovery of alloslipins is an important
finding in our quest to understand stomatin family phylogeny, as these are the first eukaryotic slipin-like
sequences identified outside metazoa. However, despite
detailed searches of protist and basal metazoan genomes,
we have been unable to resolve the currently bizarre taxonomic distribution of alloslipin proteins. Within metazoa, slipins have been subjected to numerous gene
duplication events, and at least one gene fusion event with
a sterol carrier protein that occurred prior to the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes [17] and gave
rise to SLP-1, now named slipin-1. Within protostomes,
there are at least two other subfamilies (Figure 4). One of
these groups includes arthropods, molluscs, annelids and
a nematode, uniting the protostomes into a monophyletic
group, which we have named protostome stomatin to
reflect the short branches and phylogenetic range. The
topology of Figure 5 suggests that slipin-4 and protostome
stomatin may in fact be paralogues that arose before
ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans diverged; following
this duplication event slipin-4 was lost from most taxa.

Alignment of stomatin subfamily consensus sequences
Alignment of stomatin subfamily consensus sequences. Consensus sequences (100-70 %) were generated by selecting
and aligning (ClustalX) subfamily members identified in monophyletic groups in Figures 1-4. The shading threshold was set to
0.6. Identical residues have a black background and similar residues have a grey background. A 60 % slipin (pink) and paraslipin
(green) consensus sequence is also displayed. p2_para refers to prokaryotic paraslipins present in the upper clade in Figure 3,
whilst p1_para refers to prokaryotic paraslipins present in the lower clade with eukaryotic paraslipins (euPara). The dotted line
above the sequences shows the region shared by all stomatin family members, whilst the solid red line indicates regions shared
by slipins and eoslipins to the exclusion of alloslipins. n = the number of sequences used to generate each consensus. – indicates the position of a gap, indicates an unconserved amino acid.

Simplified hypothesis for the origin, duplication and divergence of vertebrate stomatin subfamilies
Simplified hypothesis for the origin, duplication and divergence of vertebrate stomatin subfamilies. An ancestral
stomatin gene, possibly present in the last universal common ancestor, duplicated to give rise to eoslipin and prokaryotic paraslipin. Prokaryotic paraslipin was transferred into eukaryotes during the acquisition of the mitochondrion. Eukaryotic slipins
probably evolved from eoslipin, which we assume was present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes. Within metazoa,
slipin-1 arose from a gene duplication (GD) event involving a stomatin-like gene which subsequently fused (GF) with a sterol
carrier domain (Edqvist and Blomqvist 2006). Podocin and slipin-3 arose from two further duplications of an ancestral stomatin-like gene that might have occurred during the two whole genome duplications in early vertebrate evolution.

Within vertebrates, we see the origin of podocin, slipin-3
and stomatin proteins, and we propose that these arose as
a result of two gene duplication events (Figure 7). The
inclusion of Danio rerio sequences within all three vertebrate groups suggests both duplication events occurred
before the teleost/tetrapod split. The placement of the sea
squirt sequences as the sister group to this clade dates the
time of divergence to after the chordate/urochordate
divergence. If we accept the loss of a paralogue, this phylogeny supports the two whole genome duplication events
that are proposed to have occurred prior to the origin of
vertebrates [32,33], accounting for the origin of slipin-3,
podocin and stomatin. Whilst there appears to have been
little sequence divergence in vertebrate stomatin
sequences, podocin and, to a lesser extent, slipin-3 have
undergone significant sequence evolution (Figures 5 and
6) making it likely that they are functioning in a distinctly
different manner to other family members.

Conclusion
The goal of this study was to provide a conceptual framework within which to study this family. This can be used
to improve understanding of stomatin function in
humans and to identify relevant homologs to investigate
subfamily function. Whilst it is likely that slipin-3,
podocin and alloslipin proteins are functioning in new
ways (as judged by the long branches leading to these

groups), it is not clear whether hstomatin has retained its
ancestral function. The lack of any significant divergence
within this clade, the conservation of protein length and
the sequence conservation, all suggest that vertebrate stomatin may indeed be functioning in a similar way to protostome stomatin and possibly eoslipin. The conservation
of motifs (Figure 6) suggests a shared mechanism among
these subfamilies, although the downstream effects might
be very different. The placement of Rickettsiales as the sister group to eukaryotic paraslipins (Figure 3) suggests that
alphaproteobacteria may serve as a relevant system to
investigate human paraslipin function.
It seems clear that the stomatin-like proteins have their
origin in an ancient duplication event that occurred early
on in the evolution of prokaryotes. A high degree of conservation implies that they have important functions,
though these remain almost completely unknown. By
constructing a phylogeny of this family, we have identified and named a number of orthologous groups. Investigation of many different organisms could potentially
contribute to an understanding of stomatin-like proteins,
and we hope that our analysis will make it easier to
describe and interpret such studies.

Methods
Database Searches
The
human
stomatin
amino
acid
sequence
[NCBI:NP_004090.4] was used to search the National
Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant (nr) database using BLASTP with default settings [34]. The query was restricted to eukaryotes as organisms. To identify prokaryotic stomatin-like proteins, the
human stomatin and SLP-2 amino acid sequences were
used to search the NCBI nr bacterial and archaeal databases. Sequences with an E-value of < 10-14 were retrieved
in FASTA format and saved. Blasting with human stomatin was sufficient to retrieve all stomatin, podocin and
SLP-3 proteins. SLP-1 proteins were not retrieved as the
presence of the sterol carrier domain limits the alignment
length (for a review of SLP-1 phylogeny see Edqvist and
Blomqvist 2006). To further explore the distribution of
slipins and paraslipins in key eukaryotic genomes,
BLASTP and tBLASTn searches were performed against the
eukaryotic genomes of the Joint Genome Institute (JGI)
using both human stomatin and Tetrahymena thermophila
[NCBI:XP_001033024.1] alloslipin sequences with
default settings.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/44

was determined by bootstrapping using 100 repetitions.
Various subgroups were then selected and used to build
further maximum likelihood trees as described above. All
trees were displayed using NJ plot [40] except Figure 1
which was viewed using TreeView [41].
Generation of Consensus Sequences
Sequences from monophyletic groups identified by ML
analysis were aligned using ClustalX. BioEdit was then
used to create a 70–100 % consensus sequence for each
group depending on the number of taxa. X was used to
represent a non-consensus position. Consensus sequences
were then aligned using ClustalX with default settings and
viewed using BOXSHADE [42] with the identity shading
threshold set at 0.6.

Protein Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis
Retrieved sequences were checked by aligning them with
their query sequence using ClustalX 1.83 [35] with the following parameters: gap penalty = 10, gap extension penalty = 0.10. The Gonnet series protein weight matrix was
used in the ClustalX alignment. Sequences that failed to
align or contained significant gaps (> 50 aa) were deleted.
Checked sequences were re-aligned using ClustalX and a
preliminary distance Neighbour Joining (NJ) tree [36] was
produced for prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins to determine the number and composition of subgroups, with
1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates performed. From this
initial tree, sequences from well supported monophyletic
groups were selected for the various phylogenetic analyses, realigned and edited using BioEdit [37] to remove any
ambiguously aligned positions. Where organisms contained multiple copies of the same protein, the protein
with the best BLAST score to the search query was chosen.
To limit the problems associated with long branch attraction, we removed divergent species-specific paralogues
that failed to form orthologous groups. The resulting
alignment was then used to construct a NJ tree (ClustalX
1.83, n = 1000) and a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree using PHYML [38]. For ML analysis the JTT
substitution matrix was used for calculation of the amino
acid substitutions [39]. A discrete-gamma distribution
with four categories was used to account for variable substitution rates among sites. The gamma distribution
parameter was estimated by PHYML. A BIONJ distance
tree was used as the starting tree to be refined by the maximum likelihood algorithm. The robustness of the tree
