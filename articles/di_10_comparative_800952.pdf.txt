Abstract
Background: PHB (Prohibitin) gene family is involved in a variety of functions important for different biological
processes. PHB genes are ubiquitously present in divergent species from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Human PHB
genes have been found to be associated with various diseases. Recent studies by our group and others have
shown diverse function of PHB genes in plants for development, senescence, defence, and others. Despite the
importance of the PHB gene family, no comprehensive gene family analysis has been carried to evaluate the
relatedness of PHB genes across different species. In order to better guide the gene function analysis and
understand the evolution of the PHB gene family, we therefore carried out the comparative genome analysis of
the PHB genes across different kingdoms.
Results: The relatedness, motif distribution, and intron/exon distribution all indicated that PHB genes is a relatively
conserved gene family. The PHB genes can be classified into 5 classes and each class have a very deep
evolutionary origin. The PHB genes within the class maintained the same motif patterns during the evolution. With
Arabidopsis as the model species, we found that PHB gene intron/exon structure and domains are also conserved
during the evolution. Despite being a conserved gene family, various gene duplication events led to the expansion
of the PHB genes. Both segmental and tandem gene duplication were involved in Arabidopsis PHB gene family
expansion. However, segmental duplication is predominant in Arabidopsis. Moreover, most of the duplicated genes
experienced neofunctionalization. The results highlighted that PHB genes might be involved in important functions
so that the duplicated genes are under the evolutionary pressure to derive new function.
Conclusion: PHB gene family is a conserved gene family and accounts for diverse but important biological
functions based on the similar molecular mechanisms. The highly diverse biological function indicated that more
research needs to be carried out to dissect the PHB gene function. The conserved gene evolution indicated that
the study in the model species can be translated to human and mammalian studies.

Background
Prohibitin (PHB) is also known as band_7 domain proteins or SPFH (stomatins, prohibitins, flotillins and
HflK/C) domain-containing proteins. PHB genes widely
exist in a broad spectrum of species ranging from

prokaryotes to eukaryotes [1-4]. Depending on the subcellular localization and other factors, PHB genes could
be involved in important but diverse biological functions
[5]. In human, PHB genes were found to be associated
with the breast cancer phenotype, where PHB localizes
in the nucleus of some breast cancer cell lines as a transcriptional regulator interacting with E2F, P53, and retinoblastoma (Rb) to regulate the expression of
downstream genes. PHB gene can therefore serve as a
tumour suppressor regulating cell-cycle progression and

apoptosis [6-9]. Besides cell nucleus, PHBs were also
found in lipid raft, an important component of cell
membrane [1,2,4,6-11]. The plasma membrane PHBs
were believed to serve as a target for small molecules in
the inflammatory responses and to regulate the iron
channels and membrane receptor [12-14]. Overall, PHB
genes play important roles for various biological processes and are associated with different disease
phenotypes.
Despite the diverse biological functions, most of molecular level studies for PHB genes were focused on their
roles in mitochondria. In yeast and mammalian cells,
PHB1 and PHB2 are highly homologous subunits that
can interact with each other as a complex [15-17]. The
assembled complex with 12 to 16 heterodimers is
anchored to the mitochondrial inner membrane to play
potentially diverse functions as indicated in various publications. PHB complex could interact with m-AAA protease to regulate the degradation of membrane proteins
in mitochondria [18]. The PHB complex could also
interact with stomatin-like protein (SLP-2/Stoml2) to
regulate the stability of the components of respiratory
chain complexes [17,19,20]. PHB proteins have also
been proposed to directly or indirectly interact with
mtDNA to regulate the oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) system and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
formation, which could lead to senescence phenotype in
plants and C.elegans [21-24]. In additions, PHBs might
be involved in maintaining crista morphology to recruit
proteins into the inner membrane [25,26]. Overall, all of
the aforementioned molecular studies suggested the regulatory function of PHB genes for cell proliferation
[5,27].
Despite the progresses in the function studies, our
understanding of the gene family is still rather limited.
First, the function at both molecular and pathway level
needs to be better defined. Different mechanisms for
gene function have been proposed, but few were thoroughly defined for linking the molecular function with
biological function. Second, many members of PHB
gene family were not well studied in any given species.
The diverse gene expression pattern as shown in the
article indicated that the member of PHB gene family
could account for very diverse functions. Third, despite
the previous analyses of PHB gene function in yeast,
mammalian cell, and C. elegans, very few studies have
been carried out in plants and prokaryotes. Recent studies indicated that PHB genes may be involved in sensence phenotype and we have also discovered the
potential function of some PHB genes in growth and
defense processes. In order to lay the grounds for studying PHB gene function in different species, we therefore
carried out the comparative gene family analysis of this

important gene family to study the evolution-functional
relevance of the family.
We therefore carried out a comparative gene family
analysis of PHB genes from representative species in different biological kingdoms. Phylogenetic analysis of PHB
genes from different kingdoms indicated the deep evolutionary roots of the PHB genes. Horizontal gene transfer
between higher and lower species has also been found.
The phylogenetic analysis is further confirmed by motif
pattern, intron-exon structure, and domain distribution
of the gene family that PHB genes within each class
generally had conserved gene structure. We then
focused on the gene duplication and expression analysis
in model plant species Arabidopsis. Segmental duplication is the predominant for PHB genes, which confirms
that the gene family is relatively conserved. Expression
pattern analysis indicated that PHB genes could involved
in a variety of functions ranging from development to
abiotic and biotic stress responses. Using expression pattern as an indicator for gene function, we found that
paralogs often evolve different functions during the evolution. Overall, PHB gene family is a relatively conserved
gene family with rather diverse gene function. The evolution-function relationship indicated that the functional
study in one species could provide meaningful information for another species. The study of PHB gene functions in model species could also help to elucidate the
PHB gene function in cancer, aging, immunity, and
others.

Results
Evolutionary relatedness of PHB genes in species from
different biological kingdoms

In order to carry out a comprehensive analysis of PHB
gene families across different species, we first identified
the PHB genes from three major biological databases.
The EMBL-EBI InterPro database contains 6476 proteins with a ‘IPR001107 Band7’ domain. The Pfam database contains 6416 proteins with the domain name of
‘Band_7 (PF01145)’. The SMART (Simple Modular
Architecture Research Tool) database contains 5913
proteins with the domain named as “SM00244 PHB”. As
aforementioned, Band_7domain, SPFH domain and prohibitin domain all refers to the similar protein domain
with different names. To be consistent, we therefore use
the name prohibitin (PHB) proteins in this article [3].
PHB genes were widely distributed among most species,
including many kinds of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In
order to study the evolution-function relationship of
PHB genes, representative species from the kingdoms of
monera, fungi, plantae, and animalia were chosen for
phylogenetic analysis. Species names and their classification are as shown in Table 1.

We first carried out phylogenetic analysis to produce
unrooted tree using the neighbor-joining method. The
statistical reliability was conducted by bootstrapping
1000 replicates. The phylogenetic analysis revealed both
deep evolutionary root and the existence of more recent
duplications for the PHB genes. As shown in Figure 1,
PHB genes from different kingdoms produced a complicated tree, where PHB genes can be classified into five
groups or classes. In Class I, C. elegans and human PHB
genes shared a clade. Both species belong to the animalia kingdom and the class can be considered as animalia-specific PHB genes. In contrary to Class I, Class
II PHB genes contain the members from three different
kingdoms. Arabidopsis, rice, chlamydomonas, and Physcomitrella (moss) are from plantae kingdom ranging
from the higher spermatophytes to lower chlorophyte
and bryophyte. C. elegans and human are from the animalia kingdom and E.coli is from the monera kingdom.
The relatedness revealed the deep evolutionary origin of
the Class II PHB gene, which is also confirmed by their
distribution in plantae kingdom. The PHB genes from
higher plants like Arabidopsis and rice shared the same
clade as those from lower plant like Physcomitrella and
Chlamydomonas. Class III is more of plant species-specific. However, there are also E. coli PHB genes. Class
III thus can be divided into two subclasses; III_A for E.
coli genes and III_B for plant genes. Class IV can also
be divided into two subclasses including IV_A and IV_
B. Both subclasses have the plant genes, animal genes,
and fungi (yeast) genes sharing the same clade, which
indicated that Class IV PHB genes have a deep evolutionary origin too. In addition, for both subclasses,
higher plant PHBs share their own clades and lower
plant PHBs share distinct clades too. The results indicated that the expansion of the Class IV PHB genes in
higher and lower plants is after the divergence between

the higher and lower plants. Class V PHB genes also
have two subclasses, where higher plant genes, lower
plant genes, animal genes, and bacteria genes are separately grouped in accordance to the species evolution.
However, it is notable that E.coli PHB genes and
human genes shared a clade together, implicating the
possible horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and
amniotic ancestor. The horizontally transferred PHB
orthologs might have conserved molecular functions
shared between eukaryotes and prokaryotes to allow the
gene retention in both bacteria and human [28,29]. Generally speaking, based on the phylogenetic analysis of
PHB genes across different species, the PHB gene are
evolutionarily conserved and have deep evolutionary
roots. In addition, it is also important to reveal the evolutionary mechanisms for more recent duplications.
In order to further study the recent expansion of PHB
genes, we focused on the relatedness of PHB genes in
higher plants and chose five higher plant species including Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, medicago and sorghum for
the further phylogenetic analysis. The un-rooted neighbor-jointing tree was built and the result is shown in
Figure 2. The PHB genes in higher plants can be classified into four classes, corresponding the Class II, III, IV,
and V in the phylogenetic tree in Figure 1. The phylogenetic analysis revealed the progressive evolution of the
PHB genes. Generally speaking, the monocot PHB genes
share clade with nearest monocot orthologs, whilst the
dicot PHB genes share clade with the nearest dicot PHB
genes. The results indicated the expansion of part of the
gene family was after the monocot and dicot divergence
at about 120 million years ago. However, if we examine
the clade beyond the nearest orthologs, we can find
many clades with both monocot and dicot PHB genes,
which indicated that some ancestor PHB genes exist
before the divergence of monocot and dicot. For

example, in Class II, several poplar PHB genes shared
clades with rice PHB genes, indicating the existence of
an ancestor gene before the divergence of monocot and
dicot species. The results correlate with the fact that
Class II PHB genes have a deep evolutionary origin as
indicated by Figure 1 [30].
Overall, the phylogenetic analyses revealed the seemingly contradictory phenomena, the deep evolutionary
origins of the gene family and the recent expansion of
the gene family. The results indicated the progressive
evolution of PHB gene family because the PHB genes
appears early in the evolution, but expanded at different
stages during the evolution. In particular, the gene family
expansion seems to continue in plant species even after
the divergence between monocot and dicot, and the
mechanisms for such expansion is examined in the later
part of the article. The relatedness has significant functional relevance as we will discuss in the Discussion part.
Motif analysis of PHB genes across three species

The evolution of gene structure generally correlated
with the phylogenetic analysis of PHB genes. We carried
out three types of gene structure analyses, the motif
finding, multiple sequence alignment for domain identification, and the intron/exon analysis. For the motif analysis, we chose three representative species for the study
to correlate the gene structure with evolution, and these
three species include human, Arabidopsis and C. elegans. The overlay of phylogenetic analysis and motif
analysis is as shown in Figure 3. About twenty different
subdomains or motifs between 6 to 50 residues were
detected by MEME 4.3.0 software [31,32]. A clear correlation between the motif pattern and the phylogenetic
analysis can be found, where each class or subclass
essentially shared the same motif pattern. Some motifs
like motif 7 and motif 3 are more conserved and
appeared in many classes of PHB genes. These motifs
could be essential elements determining the PHB
domain’s common molecular function among different
family members to a certain extent. Some other motifs
like 6, 14, and 20 are more specific to one class or subclass of PHB genes and they might determine some specific functions of these genes[32,33]. The motif
distribution indicated that the genes containing the
same motifs usually produced from gene expansion
within the same class or subclass no matter in higher or
lower species. In other words, the ancestor genes with
various motif structure seem to appear early in the evolution, and such structure has been maintained through
the evolution. The motif distribution thus confirms that
the PHB genes are conserved during evolution. The differences of motif distribution in different classes and
subclasses of PHB genes are the structure basis for the
diversity in gene functions.

Multiple sequence alignment of PHB genes

Besides the motif finding, multiple sequence alignment
is another approach to identify the conserved domain
for gene function. We focused on the model species
Arabidopsis in the multiple sequence alignment. As a
model plant with the whole genome sequence available,
Arabidopsis gene functions were widely studied. Limited
research has been carried out to characterize the PHB
gene in plants, and Arabidopsis will serve as a good
model species for plant PHB gene function studies. We
therefore will focus the rest of the study in Arabidopsis.
After sequence retrieval from TAIR database, 17 Arabidopsis PHB proteins were collected and analyzed.
ClustalX (1.83) software was used for complete multiple
alignment and GeneDoc software was used for presentation as shown in Figure 4[34,35]. Across the whole
sequence of PHB proteins, several conserved domains
were found across all PHB genes. Basically, there were
four primarily conserved regions with high similarity as
colored black. In addition, several secondary and tertiary
levels of conservations were detected and colored with
gray and silver. It is noticeable that PHB domain spreads
across a wide range of protein structure and covers
many amino acid residues throughout the whole protein.
Although the PHB domain was conserved in the evolutionary process from the phylogenetic analysis, it did
not contain a defined region of amino acid residues that
decides main functions of the protein. The phenomena
is in contrary to many other gene families such as the
TIFY domain of JAZ family, CCCH zinc finger domain
of CCCH zinc finger family, or the ERF/AP2 domain in
ERF family [36-40]. The multiple sequence alignment
correlated with the motif finding, where quite diverse
motif structures have been found for genes from different classes or subclasses. Combining the results from
sequence alignment and motif finding, PHB genes were
conserved in the existence of certain specific motifs but
had rather diverse motif distributions across different
classes. The structural diversity could account for the
different biological functions of these genes.
Intron/exon structure of PHB genes

The intron/exon structure of PHB genes were different
for each class and can be divided into several groups as
shown in Figure 5. We actually carried out the intron/
exon structure analysis for Arabidopsis, human and C.
elegans. However, the size of the intron across the species makes it misleading to present the three species
together. We therefore focused on Arabidopsis. It is
notable that the intron/exon structure correlated with
the classification of PHB genes based on the phylogenetic analysis. The numbers of introns were quite different across the whole family ranging from one intron to
nine introns in one gene. For example, the Class IV_A

Figure 3 Schematic diagram of motif distribution in Arabidopsis, human and C.elegans. MEME 4.3.0 software was applied follow the
parameters described in Method. Twenty conserved motifs were shaded in different colors. Several subgroups were distinguished by the motif
distribution, which is consistant with the phylogenetic subgroups in all the three species.

genes At3g27280, At5g40700, At5g14300 generally have
one intron; while in Class, At2g20530, At4g28510,
At1g03860, At5g44140 all have four introns. The clear
correlation between intron/exon structures and the
classes of PHB genes is probably due to the recent
expansion of PHB genes in each subclass of PHB genes.
On the other side, the PHB gene intron/exon structure
thus has certain level of stability during the evolution.
Intron gain/loss has played a role in the early stage evolution of PHB genes according to Figure 5. The intron/
exon structure also correlates with the motif structure,

where distinct patterns can be found in each subclass of
PHB gene family. It is therefore expected that the gene
birth due to the intron insertion or intron loss happened
earlier during the evolution. The similar intron/exon
structure within the subclass generally reflects the more
recent gene duplications.
Both the gene length and intron phase correlate with
the gene family classification and intron numbers to a
certain degree. Intron phase 0, 1, and 2 referred to the
splicing occurred after the first, second, and third
nucleotide of the codon, respectively. As shown in

Di et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11(Suppl 6):S22

Figure 4 Multiple sequence alignment of PHB proteins in Arabidopsis. ClustalX 1.83 was applied to do complete alignment of full-length
PHB proteins. Conserved residues were shaded in the conservation mode of GeneDoc software, Degree of the colors stand for different levels of
conservation of each column in the alignment. Four basically conserved residue areas were cycled by red rectangles.

Figure 5, genes with similar intron/exon structures and
gene length also had conserved splicing phase patterns
[41,42]. A comparative analysis of human and C. elegans
intron/exon structure revealed much more introns in
these two species as shown in Additional File 1 and 2.
The results indicated that the PHB genes in Arabidopsis
may have experienced fewer intron birth events as compared to the species in animae kingdom. Overall, the
motif distribution, intron/exon structure, and the conserved domain all correlate well with the phylogenetic
analysis and relatedness of the genes [38,40,43].
Duplications of PHB genes in Arabidopsis

As aforementioned, recent duplication events defined
the gene structure and relatedness to a certain degree,
and it is important to study the duplication mechanisms

to interpret the relatedness and gene structure information. There were at least two large-scale segmental
duplication events in the evolutionary process of Arabidopsis. One was the recent polyploidy duplication,
which occurred before Arabidopsis/Brassica rapa split
around 24-40 Mya. The other was an older duplication
between chromosomal blocks after the divergence of
monocot-dicot around 120 Mya [44-46]. Considering
these factors, we investigated PHB family gene duplication and distribution on all five Arabidopsis chromosomes. The recent segmental polyploidy duplicated
blocks were explored by the “Paralogons in Arabidopsis
thaliana” search engine [40]. As shown in Figure 6,
there were three pairs of recent duplicated blocks containing PHB genes. The region on chromosome 1 containing At1g03860 and the region on chromosome 5

containing At5g44140 are duplicated segmental block
pairs. The region containing At2g20530 on chromosome
2 and the region containing At4g28510 on chromosome
4 are duplicated segmental block pairs. The region containing At3g27280 on chromosome 3 and the region
containing At5g40770 on chromosome 5 are duplicated
segmental block pairs. All of these segmentally duplicated genes were found to be paralogs in the phylogenetic analysis as shown in Figure 1 and 2. The results
indicated segmental duplication as a major way for gene
birth within each class for Arabidopsis. However, it
should also point out that not all segmental regions
containing duplicated PHB genes. For example, there
was a big recently duplicated block containing
At5g54100 (excluding At5g51570) at the bottom of chromosome 5, and its duplicated region on chromosome 4
contained no PHB genes. The results indicated that
most of the segmentally duplicated PHB genes can be
retained during the evolution, but some duplicated
genes may have disappeared during the evolution.
Besides the recent segmental duplications, there were
two ancient duplication blocks also overlap with the
recent segmental duplication blocks [44]. In particular,
one of the ancient duplication segments on chromosome 5 was known as the so-called intra-segmental
duplications and the duplicated regions contain
At5g14300 and At5g40770, which are paralogs in the
phylogenetic analysis in Figure 2. There was not much
bias of periods from inter-segmental duplications [47].
Overall, the segmental duplications play significant roles
in the evolution of gene expansion, which confirms that
PHB gene family is relatively conserved.

Besides the segmental duplications, one tandem duplication event was also found on chromosome 5.
At5g25250 and At5g25260 were two genes with high
similarity of DNA sequence and only 1Kb distance on
the chromosome. It is very likely that the gene duplication is due to gene jumping mediated by a transposon
[48]. Overall, the gene duplication pattern indicated that
segmental duplication is predominant for the PHB genes
and tandem duplication is also involved. The gene
duplication pattern correlates very well with the relatedness of the gene.
Expression patterns of PHB genes in Arabidopsis

As aforementioned, PHB genes may be involved in
diverse gene functions. In order to better understand
the PHB gene functions and their relevance to gene evolution, we investigated the gene expression level of PHB
genes with Arabidopsis as the model species. The gene
expression analysis included both the digital gene
expression pattern using Genevestigator and the actual
real-time PCR experiments.
Arabidopsis PHB family genes expression pattern at
different development stages, in different tissues, and
under different stimulus were analysed using Genevestigator version 3 [49]. The data from Arabidopsis thaliana high quality ATH1:22k microarray in the
AtGenExpress was chosen to do the analysis. Developmental stage and tissue-specific expression data were
analysed by hierarchical clustering as shown in Figure
7A and 7B , whilst gene expression patterns under stimulus conditions were shown using meta-profile analysis in Figure 7C [50,51].

Figure 6 Chromosome distribution and duplications of PHB genes in Arabidopsis. Diagram of five chromosomes of Arabidopsis was
depicted, 17 PHB family genes were distributed on the chromosomes. Only segmental duplicated regions containing PHB genes are shown.
Blue lines connected genes from recent polyploidy duplication blocks (Black boxes), black lines connected genes from old segmental duplication
blocks (Gray boxes). At5g25259 and At5g25269 are clustered as tandem repeat.

Nine development stages were surveyed for the digital
gene expression analysis. Generally speaking, PHB genes
show significant variations for gene expression in terms
of both the expression levels and presence at different
conditions (Figure 7A). In addition, no significant gene
expression pattern and phylogenetic analysis correlations
were found. For example, At1g03860 and At4g28510/
At2g20530 could be paralogs, but they had very different
expression patterns. According to the traditional gene
fate evolution models, paralogs in a gene family usually

have divergent expression patterns, indicating the different biological functions. Because a high gene dosage is
often detrimental to the organisms, one of the paralogs
often evolves a new function in a process called neofunctionalization or disappears in the evolution [52,53].
In terms of tissue-specific expression, we found that the
paralog genes often have differential gene expression
patterns, too (Figure 7B). The PHB genes are also
responding to the biotic and abiotic stimulus treatment
quite differently (Figure 7C). For example, At5g64870 is

highly up-regulated when treated with abiotic stresses
such as salt, cold, drought, whilst it is down-regulated
under some hormones like ABA (abscisic acid), MeJA
(Methyl Jasmonate), GA (gibberellins) and so on. However, other PHB genes did not have similar expression
pattern under these treatments.
In order to further confirm the digital gene expression
pattern analysis, we carried out quantitative real time
PCR experiments to analyze the tissue-specific PHB
genes expression patterns as shown in Figure 8. Five
Arabidopsis tissues of root, stem, cauline leaf, rosette
leaf and flower were used. Real time PCR results also
showed differential expression patterns of PHB genes.
The majority of the PHB genes expression patterns were
consistent with the microarray-based expression
analysis.
Overall, the gene expression pattern indicated that
PHB genes are involved in diverse biological functions
and most of the PHB genes evolve new functions after
the gene duplication, which is in contrary to some of
the fast expanding gene families like terpene synthase
gene family.

Discussion
Despite the ubiquitous presence of PHB genes in prokaryotes to eukaryotes, the function and evolution of
PHB genes have not been thoroughly studied. Most studies of PHB genes focused on individual gene functional
analysis in yeast, mammalian, C. elegans and some
plants[1-4,23]. Gene family analysis has become a major
approach to study the gene function, evolution, and
structure. The comparative analysis of gene family
across multiple species allowed us to investigate how
the various functions of the gene family members were
evolved and how the gene structure was relevant to
function [54,55]. The basic hypothesis is that conserved
genes in form of orthologs often have similar functions
and structures. The gene family expansion is also

Page 11 of 15

relevant to the interaction with herbivore or pathogens.
For example, most of the plant gene families involved in
insect defense like terpene synthase, cytochrome p450
(CYP), WRKY gene families experienced recent and
rapid evolution, partially due to the evolutionary competition with insect for chemical defense [55-57]. The analysis of the relevance of gene structure and evolution
will allow us to understand how new function of a gene
family member evolved and developed. Our results highlighted that PHB genes consist of a conserved family
with deep evolutionary root yet diverse biological and
molecular functions. The comparative analysis elucidated the evolutionary features of the PHB gene family
and helped to guide our further gene function analysis
and the study of PHB gene’s relevance to human
diseases.
Evolution of PHB gene family

Comprehensive and concrete evolutionary analysis of
PHB gene family is lacking. In order to investigate the
evolution of PHB genes and the evolution-function relationship, we carried out a comprehensive phylogenetic
and motif analysis of PHB genes from representative
species in different kingdoms. In addition, we focused
on the model plant Arabidopsis for further gene structure, duplication, and expression pattern analysis. Our
results highlighted several features of PHB gene
evolution.
First, the phylogenetic and gene structure analysis of
PHB genes indicated that PHB genes are relatively conserved across different species. Most of the PHB genes
within a class or subclass shared similar motif structure
across plant and animal species. The intron/exon structure and domains for the genes within the same class or
subclass are also conserved. Generally speaking, the
PHB genes within a class or subclass share clades following the evolutionary lineage. Second, the PHB genes
have deep evolutionary origins, where some homologs

can even trace back to prokaryote species. The divergence of different class or subclass of PHB genes happened very early in the evolution, and some at
prokaryote stage. The deep evolutionary root and conserved evolution both indicated that the PHB genes
could account for some conserved molecular functions.
Third, the conserved and important function can also
be reflected in the gene duplication and functional
divergence. Several mechanisms are involved in PHB
gene family expansion. Horizontal gene transfer was also
indicated between human and prokaryote. In model
plant Arabidopsis, some PHB genes had early expansion
across species in plants, and they usually have common
ancestor before the species diverge [30]. However, most
of the gene family expansion was due to the segmental
duplication in Arabidopsis. Tandem duplication thus
exists but is rear. The pattern is different from some
dynamic gene families like Terpene Synthase, P450 and
WRKY [54,58]. The results indicated that PHB genes
are not much involved in the competitive evolution for
chemical defense and its regulation. In fact, most of the
duplicated PHB genes evolved rather different expression pattern, indicating potentially new biological function [52,53]. The result is also different from some other
gene families that different gene fates exist together
[54,58]. It is generally believed that plants can be tolerant to a much higher gene dosage effect as compared to
animals. The fact that most of PHB gene duplications
end up with paralogs with potentially different functions
indicated that PHB genes would be involved in some
important biological processes.
Function of PHB gene family

The PHB gene evolution generally reflected the family’s
conserved but diverse functions. From a molecular perspective, PHB genes were reported to be involved in
cell-cycle progression, iron channel regulation, receptor
medicated signaling, and the control of respiratory chain
in mitochondria [1,5,17,26]. From a biological perspective, PHB genes were related to aging and senescence in
mammalian, yeast, and C.elegans [24,59,60]. More
importantly, they can be associated with a variety of disease states including inflammation, obesity, and cancer
[5]. However, more research still need to be carried out
to provide confirmative evidence to link molecular functions to biological functions.
We explored the gene expression pattern of PHB
genes in model plant Arabidopsis to derive the functional relevance and evolution-function relationship of
PHB genes. Despite the tremendous amount of research
in Arabidopsis, very few reports were published for the
function of PHB family genes. The limited previous studies indicated that PHB genes could be involved in
development, senescence, hormone signaling and stress

Page 12 of 15

responses [22,23,61-63]. From our expression analysis
results, we found that PHB genes have very diverse
expression patterns in different development stages and
tissues, as well as under different stimulus. The results
highlighted the potential diverse biological function of
PHB genes. In particular, the evolutionary pressure kept
the PHB gene motif structure and intron/exon structure
conserved during the evolution within each class or subclass. However, the same evolutionary pressure also
seems to force the paralogs to evolve differential regulations with potentially roles for different biological processes. Much more comprehensive work needs to be
carried out to study the function of PHB genes at different levels, which will also be important for the diseaserelated studies.
Comparative analysis for disease study

The functional study will help to elucidate the role of
PHB genes in cancer, aging, immunity, neuron degeneration and such. It was widely recognized that PHB
genes played crucial roles in various human diseases
[5,12,17]. Mishra et al. has reviewed the diverse localization, function and disease association of PHB genes [5].
PHB1 is also known as B-cell-receptor-associated protein 37 (BAP 37) and the 3’-UTR region of the mRNA
was shown be relevant to the breast cancer phenotype
[17,27]. Despite the diverse function, studies has only
been focused on how PHB1 and PHB2, the first two
genes found, are relevant to diseases [5,13,14,64,65].
Our comparative analysis indicated the diverse function
of the gene family and the relatively conserved gene
structure. The study indicated that the molecular function of PHB genes can be much more thoroughly studied in the model species that genetic tools are more
readily available than human. Because of the conserved
motif pattern and potential molecular function, the studies in the model species can be readily translational to
the human and mammalian studies.

Conclusions
PHB family genes are evolutionarily conserved across
multiple species in the biological kingdom from our
phylogenetic analysis. Gene structure and motif distributions were consistent with the evolutionary relatedness
of PHB genes in Arabidopsis. Different duplication
events are involved for gene family expansion, especially
the segmental duplications in Arabidopsis. Horizontal
gene transfer could also be involved in the birth of new
genes in higher organisms. Even though PHB genes are
important for a core group of molecular functions and
are conserved during evolution, the members of the
gene family have evolved to have very diverse biological
functions in development and biotic or abiotic stress
responses.

Materials and methods
Sequence retrieval and gene family member identification

Protein sequences were first acquired from http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/interpro/ under the accession PR001107
Band_7. All sequences downloaded were searched
against species specific databases with BLASTP algorism
using default parameters. Redundant sequences with different accession numbers in EMBL-EBI yet the same
locus id in their specific database were discarded. For
example, Arabidopsis protein sequences were retrieved
from TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org/; Rice protein
sequences were retrieved from TIGR http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/; others data source were as shown in
Table 1.
Eleven species including five spermatophytes, chlorophyte, bryophyte, nematoda, bacteria, fungi and mammalian were analyzed in this study.

contained PHB genes were retained, and genes detected
were then mapped on the chromosomes and linked to
each other by lines manually.
Digital expression pattern analysis

To investigate PHB genes expression profiling in Arabidopsis, Genevestigator V3 (https://www.genevestigator.
com/gv/index.jsp) was used [49]. Public high quality
AtGenExpress ATH1-22k microarray data was chosen.
Meta-profile analysis and hierarchical clustering were
used to study gene expression at different development
stages, in anatomical tissues and under different stimulus[51].
Plant growth, RNA extraction and real-time PCR
experiments

Protein sequences from different species were selected,
multiple sequence alignment was performed by ClustalX
(1.83) software, and the alignment result was then
imported into GeneDoc (http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc/index.html) for further visualization.
The phylogenetic tree was built by MEGA4.0 software
[34,66]. The Neighbor-Joining method was used with
the following parameters: pairwise deletion of gaps/missing data; poisson correlation of model; bootstrap 1000
replicates, random seed of phylogeny test. Only clades
with the bootstrap value higher than 50 were selected
for the bootstrap consensus tree [42,67].

Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) plants were grown under
12h light/ 12h dark photoperiod in a controlled environment chamber, 23 C at day time, 20 C at night. Specific
tissues including root, stem, cauline leaf, rosette leaf and
flower of six week old seedlings were collected, total
RNA was extracted with RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).First strand cDNA was synthesized from 2ug RNA
with SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen),
then diluted to 2ng/ul. Primer sequences were designed
by Primer Express3.0 (Additional File 3). Real-time PCR
reaction was carried out with SYBR Green Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacture’s
instruction. ABI 7900 sequence detection system was
used. Data analysis was used MeV v4.5.1 followed the
method of Xu et al., 2009 [54].

Intron/exon structure and motif analysis

Additional material

Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

Arabidopsis PHB gene CDS (Complementary DNA
Sequence) and genomic sequences were used to derive
intron/exon structure with the online tool Gene Structure Display Server (http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/chinese.
php) [68]. Conserved motif structures within PHB
domain for Arabidopsis genes were analyzed by
MEME4.3.0 (Multiple Expectation Maximization for
Motif Elicitation) with the following parameters; distribution of motif occurrences: any number of repetitions;
number of different motifs: 20; minimum motif width:
6; and maximum motif width: 50 [31,32].
Chromosomal distribution and duplication analysis

Arabidopsis PHB genes’s location on chromosome was
mapped by the Chromosome Map Tool at TAIR (http://
arabidopsis.org/jsp/ChromosomeMap/tool.jsp). “Paralogons in Arabidopsis thaliana” was used for detecting
segmental duplication protein pairs in the recent and
old duplication blocks on chromosomes separately,
default parameters were set [40,44,45]. Only the blocks
