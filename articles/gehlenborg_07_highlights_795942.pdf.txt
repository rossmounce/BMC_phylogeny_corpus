Abstract
In this meeting report we give an overview of the 3rd International Society for Computational
Biology Student Council Symposium. Furthermore, we explain the role of the Student Council and
the symposium series in the context of large, international conferences.

Introduction
The Student Council of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) is a student-led, worldwide network of young researchers in computational biology and
bioinformatics. The ISCB Board of Directors officially
approved the Student Council in July 2004 at the joint
European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB)
and Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB)
conference in Glasgow, Scotland. The major aims of the
Student Council are to organize events and facilitate networking opportunities for Student Council members
while nurturing soft skills to complement the normal academic program, such as organizational, teamwork and
networking skills. Since its inception, the Student Council
has organized an annual student symposium for the benefit of the student community in the field of computational biology and bioinformatics. This year the 3rd ISCB

Student Council Symposium was held in Vienna on 21st
July, again as a satellite meeting of the joint conference
ISMB/ECCB 2007 [1], with the participation of over 110
delegates.
Several distinguished scientists were invited to the symposium, including Janet Thornton (European Bioinformatics
Institute) who presented the opening keynote on "Comparative Functional Genomics of Ageing" and Anna Tramontano (University of Rome, La Sapienza) who gave a keynote
lecture on the "Advances and Pitfalls of Structural Bioinformatics". ISCB Vice President Reinhard Schneider (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) delivered the closing
remarks.
For students and young scientists it is crucial to be aware
of the directions in which the field is moving to make the

right career decisions. The symposium addressed this
challenge by providing two different perspectives on bioinformatics: During two presentation sessions and a
poster session student delegates were given the opportunity to learn about the latest research of their peers.
Another, more comprehensive, view on the development
of the field was provided through aforementioned keynote lectures and a panel discussion on "The Future of
Bioinformatics" moderated by Thomas Lengauer (Max
Planck Institute for Informatics). Several accomplished
senior scientists were on the panel, namely Rita Casadio
(University of Bologna), Tan Tin Wee (National University of Singapore), Janet Thornton (European Bioinformatics Institute) and Anna Tramontano (University of
Rome, La Sapienza). The discussion was highly interactive, providing delegates with the opportunity to actively
contribute and to ask questions. In addition, attendees
were able to learn first-hand about personal experiences
of some of the scientists that have shaped the field of computational biology.

Proceedings summary
The goal of the proceedings of the symposium is to
present a selection of the best abstracts selected from a
total of 69 submissions. The abstracts that have been
selected for this supplement comprise 6 abstracts chosen
for oral presentation plus the abstracts of the 8 best-rated
posters. Two rounds of rigorous peer-review were carried
out by members of the program committee, which was
comprised of an international group of students and
young researchers. The first round included review and
rating of every abstract by at least 2 program committee
members, from which the top 25 abstracts were chosen
for the second round. The second round consisted in rescoring of the top 25 abstracts by 4 experienced members
of the program committee to identify abstracts for oral
presentation, ensuring a sufficiently broad and balanced
representation of topics.
The research work selected for the proceedings can be
broadly grouped into the following five major themes:
1. Microarrays
Since microarray technology became available roughly a
decade ago it has been applied in almost every sub-discipline of biology from organism-level studies to tissue-specific gene expression variations to disease analysis. In line
with the community efforts to improve this high-throughput technology, Nielsen and co-workers [2] presented a
new oligonucleotide array design algorithm with
increased genome coverage and reduced noise. Margolin
et al. [3] presented a statistical method for inferring true
transcription factor – target gene interactions from ChIPon-chip data. Finally, Blanco et al. [4] presented a classification scheme integrating diverse dissimilarity patterns to

identify disease associated genes from cancer gene expression data.
2. Bioinformatics of health and disease
Most of the work presented in this section dealt with genotype-phenotype association studies for inferring diseaseassociated scenarios from a variety of resources. In particular, Rasche and Herwig [5] presented a web-resource for
meta analysis and marker identification to predict approximately 200 genes relevant to type 2 diabetes, while Fisher
and co-workers [6] combined quantitative trait loci and
microarray data to aid the search for candidate genes
responsible for phenotypic variation. In another related
work, Steinfeld, Navon and colleagues [7] presented a
semi-supervised class discovery method to quantify disease parameters, showing their method's performance on
cardiovascular disease putative risk factors.
3. Sequence analysis, structure and function prediction
In the sequence analysis section Lindgreen et al. [8] presented a novel approach for the prediction of RNA structure by integrating several parameters like covariation,
basepair probabilities and log-likelihood of the alignment
into their scoring system. In another systematic study Kahraman et al. [9] addressed the effect of various parameters
like hydrophobicity, van-der-Waals forces and electrostatic potential on the variation of the ligand and binding
pocket shape. They showed a correlation between ligand
and binding site for the shape and hydrophobicity parameters. In another homology modelling study conducted by
Goncearenco and co-workers [10] the authors built a
model for the voltage-gated potassium channel and
assessed it using experimental data.
4. Systems biology and networks
This section comprised a wide variety of works including
modelling and simulation, alignment of networks and
integration of diverse data sources to study system-level
properties. Among the highlighted works are the identification of the repertoire of genes in plants that act in
response to drought conditions by Ashkenazi et al. [11]
(presentation of this work was supported by a by a travel
fellowship to the first author provided by the ISCB Student Council through funding from the European Bioinformatics Institute) and the modelling and analysis of the
budding yeast cell cycle by Fauré and colleagues [12]. A
study on mining functional modules in the human
genome by integration of datasets of static protein-protein
interactions and expression data was presented by Georgii
et al. [13].
5. Miscellaneous
Barbarini et al. [14] presented a procedure to decompose
high-resolution SELDI- and MALDI-TOF mass spectra
obtained from complex mixtures of peptides based on

computation of correlation coefficients. In another study,
Peixoto and Roos [15] showed that about 15% of the metabolic enzymes in Toxoplasma gondii are likely to have
been acquired by lateral gene transfer (LGT) events in apicomplexan parasites. Using a rigorous method the
authors were able to identify a highly probable list of LGT
events and showed that most of the high-confidence predictions point to the phylogenetic affinity of apicomplexa
to plants. This is consistent with the algal origin of the apicoplast organelle present in these parasites.

Conclusion
A total of 69 abstracts were received for this symposium.
All abstracts were rigorously reviewed by at least two referees to select the best abstracts for oral presentation. Eventually 8 authors were invited to give oral presentations of
their abstracts, one was rejected and the remaining were
asked to present their work as posters. The research presented covered a wide variety of scientific themes including (1) Microarrays, (2) Bioinformatics of Health and
Disease, (3) Sequence Analysis, Structure and Function
Prediction as well as (4) Systems Biology and Networks. A
selection of 14 outstanding abstracts has been compiled
for this supplement.
A survey [1] conducted among the delegates at the symposium showed that nearly all of them believe that it is definitely important to have activities focussed on their needs
at large conferences such as ISMB and ECCB. For almost
50% of the delegates the student talks or the poster session were the most important aspect of the symposium.
More than a third would like to have more student talks
and roughly half of all delegates asked for an extended
poster session. The latter was perceived to be of good to
very good scientific quality. The survey also showed that
there is a great demand for career-related events organized
by students for students. The evaluation of the survey is
available at http://www.iscbsc.org/scs3/evaluation.pdf.

The outcome of the survey, the feedback we received from
the delegates after the symposium as well as the increasing
number of participants makes us confident that the Student Council Symposium series and related events are a
necessary and well-received addition to the program of
major conferences in our field. The Student Council leadership is determined to continue and expand its efforts to
promote the career-development of the next generation of
computational biologists.

Outlook
The 4th ISCB Student Council Symposium will be held in
Toronto, Canada in conjunction with the annual conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB)
in July 2008. Further information about the Student
