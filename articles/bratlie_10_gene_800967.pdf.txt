Gene duplications in prokaryotes can be
associated with environmental adaptation

Abstract
Background: Gene duplication is a normal evolutionary process. If there is no selective advantage in keeping the
duplicated gene, it is usually reduced to a pseudogene and disappears from the genome. However, some paralogs
are retained. These gene products are likely to be beneficial to the organism, e.g. in adaptation to new
environmental conditions. The aim of our analysis is to investigate the properties of paralog-forming genes in
prokaryotes, and to analyse the role of these retained paralogs by relating gene properties to life style of the
corresponding prokaryotes.
Results: Paralogs were identified in a number of prokaryotes, and these paralogs were compared to singletons of
persistent orthologs based on functional classification. This showed that the paralogs were associated with for
example energy production, cell motility, ion transport, and defence mechanisms. A statistical overrepresentation
analysis of gene and protein annotations was based on paralogs of the 200 prokaryotes with the highest fraction
of paralog-forming genes. Biclustering of overrepresented gene ontology terms versus species was used to identify
clusters of properties associated with clusters of species. The clusters were classified using similarity scores on
properties and species to identify interesting clusters, and a subset of clusters were analysed by comparison to
literature data. This analysis showed that paralogs often are associated with properties that are important for
survival and proliferation of the specific organisms. This includes processes like ion transport, locomotion,
chemotaxis and photosynthesis. However, the analysis also showed that the gene ontology terms sometimes were
too general, imprecise or even misleading for automatic analysis.
Conclusions: Properties described by gene ontology terms identified in the overrepresentation analysis are often
consistent with individual prokaryote lifestyles and are likely to give a competitive advantage to the organism.
Paralogs and singletons dominate different categories of functional classification, where paralogs in particular seem
to be associated with processes involving interaction with the environment.

Background
Orthologs and paralogs are two key concepts of evolutionary genomics. While orthologs are related via vertical descendent from a common ancestor, paralogs are
related via duplication events subsequent to speciation
[1]. For practical purposes paralogs are often defined as
protein-coding sequences that have at least 30%
sequence identity over more than 60% of their lengths
[2,3]. In Escherichia coli K-12 as many as 30% of the
proteins have at least one paralogous sequence in the

genome [3]. The number of paralogs correlates well
with genome size; a larger genome will in general have
more paralogous genes [4].
According to Ohno [5], the first to both gather evidence for gene duplication and to describe the various
fates of the duplicated genes, there are three possible
outcomes of a duplication event where the gene duplicate is kept: neofunctionalization (the evolution of a
new function in one of the duplicates), subfunctionalization (the division of ancestral functions among duplicates), and conservation of function (the conservation of
all functions in both duplicates) [6]. If there is no selective advantage in keeping the duplicated gene, then the
gene may become inactivated by mutations (nonfunctionalization), reduced to a pseudogene and finally

removed from the genome by deletion. Actually only a
small fraction of duplicated genes evolve new functions
and are retained by the organism [7].
Expansion of genetic material represents an increased
cost for most organisms. What is the evolutionary driving force behind retention of duplicated genes? New
gene functions created by gene duplication may be a
way of adapting to altered environments. The ability to
adapt is crucial to the survival of the organism, and the
duplicated genes may facilitate the handling of changed
environmental conditions (e.g. nutritional scarcity or
thermal stress) [8]. For the duplicated gene to avoid
deletion, the gene must represent a positive response to
environmental stress, e.g. by quickly picking up a mutation that makes the gene advantageous and selected for
as a response to the new conditions, or by just increasing gene dosage as a response to higher demand [4].
When the selective pressure is removed, the paralogs
may be lost again [8].
An alternative hypothesis of environmental adaptation
has been proposed by Sanchez-Perez et al [9]. Instead of
creating new gene functions by duplications this hypothesis implies that the gene copy performs the same function as the original gene, but that the paralogs function
under different conditions. This kind of paralogs has
been named ecoparalogs. An example of this process is
seen in the hyperhalophilic bacterium Salinibacter
ruber. This bacterium has halophilic proteins that have
their optimal activity and stability at high salinity.
Sanchez-Perez and his colleagues also found paralogous
genes that performed the same function but differed in
halophilicity; these genes could therefore function as
backup genes to maintain essential functions over a
wider range of salinity. Examples of ecoparalogs in other
prokaryotes were also found, indicating that the presence of ecoparalogs in prokaryotic genomes could be
frequent.
Prokaryotes can also acquire new genes and gene
functions by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT
involves transfer of genes between different species, in
contrast to the usual vertical inheritance. The gene
transfer may happen between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but it is more likely to happen between closely
related organisms [10]. The transfer events can be classified into three different categories: acquisition of new
genes, acquisition of genes similar to already existing
genes (apparent paralogs) and xenologous gene displacement [11]. The latter involves displacement of a gene by
a horizontally transferred ortholog from another lineage.
Gene duplication, gene loss and horizontal gene transfer are all considered to be important processes that
shape prokaryotic genomes [8]. Although prokaryotic
genomes are constantly changing because of these processes, the relative size of the genome is rather constant.

Thus the two opposing factors of gene gain and gene
loss are constantly balanced in prokaryotes. The ratio of
genes per amount of DNA is found to be on average
1 kb per gene [12], indicating a relatively stable gene
size and genome complexity.
In this analysis we have identified annotation terms
that are statistically overrepresented in paranomes (set
of paralogs) of all fully sequenced prokaryotes at the
time of this study, and then performed a biclustering of
properties and species based on overrepresented Gene
Ontology (GO) terms.
Statistical overrepresentation analysis is a well established method for finding significantly overrepresented
features in a data set, commonly used e.g. for analysing
gene sets [13] or transcription factor binding sites [14].
The data set is compared against a background (reference) set representing the average or typical gene set.
For each term the number of objects with and without
that term in the data set and in the background set is
counted, creating a 2 × 2 matrix, and the statistical significance of the distribution is tested using e.g. Fisher’s
exact test.
GO was created as a tool to get a more unified and
standard description of genes and their functions in
eukaryotes and prokaryotes, in particular since it was
found that a large fraction of genes specifying the core
biological functions are shared among species. Gene
products are described in terms of biological process,
cellular components and molecular functions, independent of species [15]. The GO network has a tree structure, where each node (GO term) is the child of a
parent, and each child may have more than one parent.
Each GO term has a unique GO identifier.
Biclustering as it is implemented e.g. in the Biclustering Analysis Toolbox (BicAT) [16] clusters a data set in
two dimensions simultaneously. This makes it possible
to automatically identify clusters of organisms based on
similarity within different subsets (clusters) of features,
giving both an overview of features (GO terms) that
define individual clusters as well as organisms that are
associated with these clusters. Biclustering, or co-clustering, has become a popular way of analysing e.g. gene
expression data. The technique may define several alternative solutions of partly overlapping clusters because it
is possible for an organism - GO pair to participate in
more than one cluster, which could not be achieved by
more traditional clustering.
Identification of overrepresented features of the
paranomes in a large number of prokaryotes has made
it possible to analyse selected features to assess the
hypothesis that they may reflect how the prokaryotes
interact with the environment, e.g. through gene
transfer, locomotion, chemotaxis, ion transport or
photosynthesis.

Figure 1 General data flow in the analysis. For each organism
the proteome was extracted and paralogs were identified with Blast
searching. The resulting paranomes were analysed by plotting the
number of genes with paralogs vs. genome length (Figure 2) and
the distribution of COG categories (Figure 3). The paranomes were
analysed for statistical overrepresentation of annotation terms using
DAVID. The output from DAVID was initially analysed as a graph
(Figure 4), using overlap between complete annotation lists from
DAVID to define pairwise similarities between species. Clusters in
the graph were identified with visual inspection (Table 1). For a
more stringent analysis only GO terms were used, and these were
analysed with biclustering using a matrix consisting of individual GO
term occurrences for each species. First data based on three
different background models for DAVID were compared (Figure 5).
Clusters for the optimal background model were then analysed for
GO terms frequently associated with specific species (Table 2).
Interesting clusters in the biclustering were identified by analysing
GO similarity versus genomic distance (Figure 6), and selected
clusters representing simultaneously both high GO similarity and
large evolutionary distance (Table 3) were discussed in relationship
to literature data.

Results and discussion
The general data flow of the analysis is illustrated in
Figure 1, starting with the full proteome of each prokaryote. The main analysis consists of mapping of paralogs,
identification of statistically overrepresented annotation
terms and biclustering of annotation terms versus species in order to identify potentially interesting clusters.
See the figure legend for a more detailed description.
Paralogs were identified with focus on recent
duplications

We identified paralogs in 897 prokaryotes by sequence
analysis, using all fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes
(archaea and bacteria) from NCBI [17] at the time of
analysis. The 200 prokaryotes with the highest paralog
fraction were included in the full analysis (Table S1 in
Additional File 1), see Methods. Among these organisms
were 10 archaea. The paralog fraction was defined as
the ratio between the number of proteins with one or
more paralogs (not considering the number of copies)
and the total number of proteins in that particular proteome, and is also known as the degree of duplication.
The organism with highest paralog fraction in our analyses was Aster yellows witches-broom phytoplasma
(strain AYWB) (12.12%), the organism with lowest paralog fraction (among the top 200 organisms) was Streptococcus pyogenes (strain MGAS8232) (2.28%).
Our paralog criterion was set to 75% identity between
sequences. This is a fairly strict cut-off, as a more commonly used criterion is 30% sequence identity over more
than 60% of the sequence length. By setting a relatively
strict sequence identity cut-off, our analyses will focus on
recently arisen or well conserved paralogs. The paralogs
are therefore likely to have retained the same or at least a
very similar function, so that they represent a real and
often recent amplification of this particular function. In
this way we are focusing on functions where the prokaryote may have had a recent need to increase the gene
dosage, e.g. to adapt to a changing environment or new
niche in which it probably is living right now. However,
the strict cut-off makes it difficult to compare the paralog
fraction in our analysis with other analyses where a less
strict criterion has been used.
It is possible that some of the genes in our analyses
are not “real” paralogs, as they may have been acquired
by horizontal gene transfer. Horizontally transferred
genes from species that are not closely related to the
host will in most cases be less similar to the copy in the
recipient genome. Our strict paralog cut-off therefore
makes it likely that genes from horizontal gene transfer
constitute a very small part of the data set, unless they
in fact are true paralogs that have been copied into the
genome more than once.

Number of paralogs is correlated with genome size

Earlier analyses [18,19] have shown that there is a linear
correlation between the number of paralogs and the
genome size of an organism. To confirm this relationship, we plotted the number of genes with paralogs (not
considering the number of copies) versus genome size,
as shown in Figure 2. The figure shows that there is a
relatively good correlation (r = 0.73 when outliers are
included, r = 0.80 when outliers are excluded) between
genome size and the number of genes with paralogs.
However, three genomes (indicated in the figure) have
clearly more paralogs compared to the general trend;
these are Microcystis aeruginosa, Methylobacterium
nodulans, and Acaryochloris marina. The genome of the
cyanobacterium M. aeruginosa is known to have high
plasticity, and as much as 11.8% of the genome consists
of insertion sequences and transposable elements [20].
This may explain the high number of genes with paralogs. The alphaproteobacterium M. nodulans and cyanobacterium A. marina have a total of 7 and 9 plasmids
each [21]. Only the size of the main chromosome was
used for the figure, thus these two genomes appear
smaller than they actually are.

files from NCBI [22], further details are given in Methods. The singletons data were extracted from a published data set [23]. The paralog and singleton sets were
compared to the full set of entries in the COG database
[24], see Figure 3.
It is difficult to compare the distribution of paralogs
and singletons directly, as the ratios are sensitive e.g. to
whether ribosomal proteins are included or not. We
therefore focussed mainly on COG classes where either
paralogs or singletons are close to zero, thereby reducing the importance of the relative scaling. This showed
that paralogs are preferentially associated with energy
production and conversion (COG category C), cell motility (N), inorganic ion transport and metabolism (P), signal transduction (T), and defence mechanisms (V). The
singletons are preferentially associated with cell-cycle
control and mitosis (D), nucleotide metabolism and
transport (F), and post-translational modification (O),
indicating that these processes are under more strict
control, not allowing for duplications. For both groups
replication and repair (L) is important, and to some
extent transcription (K).

The features that describe the set of paralogs are features that may contribute to a competitive advantage for
the organism. By having more copies of genes in the
category inorganic ion transport and metabolism the
organisms may enhance the uptake of trace metals that
are important for survival. The accessibility of such
essential trace metals (e.g. copper and iron) in some
environments may be scarce and difficult to utilize [25],
and enhancing the functional capabilities may be of
great advantage. The COG category for defence
mechanisms is also associated with paralogs. Several
bacteria live in environments that are stressful for the
organism, e.g. environments with harmful contaminations, lack of nutrition or environments with a high or
low temperature. All of these factors may be stressful
and cause damage to DNA. Therefore, by having more
copies of replication/repair genes, the organism adds
extra robustness to its repair system. Extra copies of
genes involved in cell motility may also be advantageous, making it possible to move around in more variable environments.
A similar analysis has been performed by Pushker et al
[19] where they analysed the differences of functional
classification between large gene families with more
than five members (paralogs) and singletons in E. coli
K-12 and Bacillus subtilis. For E. coli they found that
genes involved in transport of metabolites were overrepresented, followed by genes for transcription and replication/repair. A high association of paralogs with amino
acid metabolism was also confirmed by an analysis performed by Gevers et al [8]; they assigned functional
classes to genes of 48 genomes. In addition, they found
retained duplicates in COG categories transcription (K)
and inorganic ion metabolism (P) and to a lesser extent
in carbohydrate metabolism (G), defence mechanisms
(V), and energy production and conversion (C). Our
analyses confirm most of these results, in particular
regarding inorganic ions, defence mechanisms and
energy production, but we found a quite low distribution of paralogs involved in transport of metabolites.
The differences in functional classification may to some
extent be caused by our strict paralog criterion, which
may rule out paralogs that have adapted to new functions, e.g. transport of alternative metabolites.
Pushker et al also found that singletons were almost
equally distributed among the functional categories
(excluding genes with an unknown function). This is different from our analysis, where singletons in particular are
overrepresented in the translation category (J). This category consists mainly of ribosomal proteins, and those
genes are usually found with only one copy in the genome
[23]. The singletons discussed here are so-called persistent
singletons; i.e. they are found in the majority of the genomes included in the analysis. The singletons in the

Page 5 of 17

analysis of Pushker et al are not persistent, and the handling of ribosomal proteins is not described in their analysis.
The two analyses are therefore not directly comparable.
Prokaryotes can be clustered based on shared features

We used the Database for Annotation and Visualization
and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [26] and associated
tools to identify statistically overrepresented annotation
terms for the set of paralogs from each prokaryote. To
get an initial overview of the full data set we did a pairwise comparison of all species by matching the lists of
overrepresented terms and counting the number of
terms that were found in both lists. The final list of
pairwise similarities between species was then used as
input to Cytoscape [27], using species (i.e. paranomes)
as nodes and the number of shared annotation terms as
edge weights. An automatic layout approach was used
for the resulting graph (Figure 4), and a selection of
potentially interesting clusters was identified by visual
inspection of this graph (Table 1).
The resulting clusters gave an interesting overview of
the data set. The graph itself shows some clear clusters,
but also a high level of connectivity (edges) between clusters, even though a quite strict criterion has been
used. The overlap was required to consist of at least
10 annotation terms, and it should cover at least 30% of

Figure 4 Graph-representation of similarity between species.
The graph shows individual organisms as nodes, and the edges
represent strong overlap between annotation lists from DAVID (See
Methods for details). Layout was computed by Cytoscape. Clusters
were selected by visual inspection, and are numbered according to
Table 1.

the maximum possible overlap (see Figure S1 in Additional File 2 and Methods). This gave a network of 567
nodes and 3796 edges, whereas an overlap of at least 3
annotation terms without any requirement on relative size
of the overlap gave a network consisting of 826 nodes and
29755 edges. The latter network illustrates the extensive
connectivity in the data set, although it is too complex for
identification of clusters. This shows that the data set can
(and probably should) be clustered in several different
ways.
Some clusters in Table 1 are dominated by multiple
strains of a single species, e.g. cluster 7 (Escherichia
coli), or by closely related species, e.g. clusters 9 (Bacillus sp.), 10 (Staphylococcus sp.), and 13 (Mycobacterium
sp.). More interesting are clusters with high diversity
with respect to species, but low diversity with respect to
function, e.g. clusters 1 (transposition), 5 (photosynthesis), 6 (regulation of transcription), 11 (flagellum), and
12 (locomotion, chemotaxis). Most of these seem to be
associated with how the prokaryotes interact with and
respond to changes in the environment.
This analysis gave a useful overview of the data set.
However, the analysis is obviously sensitive to several
factors like annotation level, similarity cut-off, and graph
layout. It was therefore relevant to use a more welldefined approach for this data set, focusing on the 200
species with largest paralog fraction, using a high-quality
subset of annotation terms and flexible clustering.

Using all paralogs as background gives the most
homogenous clusters

We started by analysing how the choice of background
set for overrepresentation analysis would influence the
clustering result, using three different background sets.
The test set consisting of the paranome for each organism was the same in all cases, whereas the background
sets either were all paralogs (i.e. the full paranome), all
proteomes, or the individual proteome for each organism. The overrepresentation analysis performed by
DAVID resulted in annotation terms within a range of
different categories, e.g. InterPro, SMART, PIR SuperFamily, KEGG, COG, and GO. The latter was the best
represented category; therefore GO [15] was best suited
to describe features of the paranomes. The overrepresented GO terms for the paralogs in our test set were
therefore used for analysis.
The subsequent data analysis was going to be based
on biclustering on GO terms and species. It is a reasonable hypothesis that the best data set for clustering is
the one forming the most homogenous clusters with
respect to GO, so that the clusters tend to contain closely related GO terms. This favours clusters representing a single dominating feature. We used BicAT [16]
with the BiMax algorithm on the test set versus each of
the three background sets (full results from BicAT are
not shown, but are available upon request). The clustering from BicAT using all paralogs as background

background models. The distribution of within-cluster similarity
scores for GO terms computed over all clusters from DAVID using
three different background models: individual proteomes, all
paralogs, and all proteomes. A higher score implies a more similar
or unambiguous cluster with respect to GO terms, which is what
we try to achieve to facilitate the subsequent analysis of clusters.
The average for all paralogs is significantly different from the
average for individual proteomes and all proteomes (p = 2.01 × 1047
and p = 1.95 × 10-65 respectively using a two-sided t-test).

resulted in 1534 clusters and included 167 organisms;
meaning that 33 of the 200 initial organisms were not
included. The majority of these (29) contained none or
only one GO term and could therefore not be clustered
by BicAT using GO terms only. There were also 9
organisms with only two GO terms. The combination of
the two GO terms had to be found in at least one other
organism for these organisms to be included in any
clusters. This was not the case for four organisms;
therefore only 167 genomes could be clustered. We also
chose to remove clusters containing only different
strains of E. coli (~110 clusters, or 7%), as the high
number of closely related strains would cause large and
artificially uniform clusters.
We then used Gene Semantic Similarity Analysis and
Measurement Tools (G-SESAME) [28] to measure the
similarity of GO terms within each cluster. This program encodes the biological meaning of GO terms into
a numeric value by aggregating the semantic contributions of their ancestor terms [28]. The clusters get a
score value between 0 and 1; a higher score implies a
more similar or unambiguous cluster. The similarity
score for each of the three analyses is shown in Figure
5. From this figure we see that clusters from the overrepresentation analysis using the background set consisting of all paralogs got the highest average similarity
score, thus implying the most unambiguous clusters.
This result seems reasonable based on the properties of
these background sets. Using the full set of proteomes as

Page 7 of 17

background will highlight how the paralogs are different
from the complete set of proteins. However, this will
include a large number of proteins that never are
involved in any comparable processes, and because of
that almost any combination of paralogs may seem to be
somehow unique, compared to the more inflated background set. The same will obviously be true when we use
each individual proteome as background. This will still
contain a large number of genes involved in other processes. However, if we use the full paranome as background we highlight how the evolutionary process of a
given organism is unique compared to evolutionary processes in general. This is a far more relevant question,
which highlights unique features of individual organisms.
This is also consistent with the more general guideline
for overrepresentation analysis, “to set up the population
background as the pool of genes that have a chance to be
selected for the studied annotation category in the scope
of the users’ particular study” [29].
The set of overrepresented GO terms identified using
the full paranome as background was therefore chosen
for further analyses. The phrase “overrepresented GO
terms” will be used to denote the GO terms retrieved
from the DAVID analysis of this data set. The BicAT
clustering output gave several partly overlapping clusters, representing alternative solutions to the biclustering problem. First we identified frequent co-occurrences
of species and features (GO terms) in these clusters, as
this probably represents features that are strongly associated with individual species. Next we identified clusters showing indications of convergent evolution of
species with respect to common features (see below).
The frequency of GO associations can be related to
properties of the organism

To get an overview of frequent associations between GO
terms and species we counted all GO term - species cooccurrences over all BicAT clusters. The frequency of
each association indicates the importance of the GO
term in defining a relevant property for that species.
The results are presented in Additional file 3 as Table
S2. The GO terms are listed according to which organism they are associated with, making it easy to identify
important features for a given species. However, many
highly similar strains of the same species will give an
artificially strong species - GO term association; therefore the 11 strains of E. coli originally included in the
data set were removed from this analysis.
From the complete table (Table S2 in Additional file
3) we see that the GO terms most frequently associated
with a given species in biclustering are rather general.
Some combinations appear quite often, in the range of
40-60 times, and typical GO terms are regulation of
macromolecule metabolic process (GO:0060255),

Bratlie et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:588

biological regulation (GO:0065007), macromolecule
metabolic process (GO:0043170), DNA metabolic process (GO:0006259), biological regulation (GO:0065007),
ribonucleotide binding (GO:0032553), purine nucleoside
binding (GO:0001883), intracellular organelle part
(GO:0044446), glycosaminoglycan catabolic process
(GO:0006027), and polysaccharide metabolic process
(GO:0005976). These terms are in most cases too general, making it difficult to identify any specific association between lifestyle and paralogs. To be able to draw
any reliable conclusions regarding important features
associated with individual species we have chosen to
base the discussion on a subset. Table 2 presents a
representative subset of Table S2, focusing on GO terms
representing specific processes or functions, rather than
more general processes.
For Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron the GO terms concerning polysaccharides and membrane are overrepresented. This is in accordance with the genome
annotation done by Xu et al [30], as they found genes
involved in polysaccharide uptake and degradation to be
one of the most markedly expanded paralogous groups.
B. thetaiotaomicron belongs to the group of Bacteroides
and is found in the human colon [31]. The ability to utilize otherwise indigestible polysaccharides, often referred
to as “dietary fibre”, is probably one of the reasons that
Bacteroides are one of the predominant genera in the
colon [32]. The genome of B. thetaiotaomicron also
encodes many outer membrane proteins that are likely
to be involved in acquisition of polysaccharides [30].
Methylibium petroleiphilum belongs to the betaproteobacteria and has the capability to metabolize the fuel
oxygenate methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) [33], a persistent groundwater contaminant [34]. It also degrades aromatic and straight-chain hydrocarbons found in
petroleum products [33]. Overrepresented GO terms are
cobalamin metabolic process, tetrapyrrole metabolic
process, and cofactor metabolic process. A study by
Rohwerder et al [35] investigated the degradation pathway of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (2-HIBA), an intermediate in the degradation pathway of MTBE. The study was
performed with the MTBE-degrading betaproteobacteria-strain L108. The results showed a cobalt and cobalamin dependence for degradation of MTBE. When
growing in a cobalt-deficient medium, degradation rate
and growth rate were significantly reduced [35]. Oxidoreductase activity is one of the overrepresented GO
terms for Nitrobacter hamburgensis. The bacterium
gains energy by oxidation of nitrite to nitrate [36], thus
the retained duplicates are likely to enhance the energy
conservation for this organism. Nostoc punctiforme is a
member of the genus Cyanobacteria, and GO terms for
photosynthesis and vesicles are overrepresented. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that carry out

Page 8 of 17

photosynthesis [37], this result is also supported by hits
in the KEGG pathway for photosynthesis (npu00195) in
the overrepresentation analysis retrieved from DAVID.
Polaromonas naphthalenivorans (strain CJ2) is known to
metabolize naphthalene in situ [38]. We find GO terms
regarding DNA repair, DNA damage and stress response
as overrepresented. Earlier analyses have shown evidence
that naphthalene damages DNA, membrane, and tissue
[39], which is likely to explain the numerous paralogs
associated with these GO terms.
The subset of data presented in Table 2 illustrates that
key paralogs in a species are indeed related to important
features of the organism, giving it a likely advantage in
the competition for survival. However, in the complete
table (Table S2 in Additional file 3) there are also features or functions where the link to survival is less
obvious. Bartonella tribocorum (strain CIP 105476),
Magnetococcus sp. (strain MC-1), Onion yellows (OY)
phytoplasma, Orientia tsutsugamushi (strain Boryong
and Ikeda), and Paracoccus denitrificans (strain PD1222)
are often associated with GO terms for DNA methylation and alkylation. Earlier analyses have shown that
DNA methylation may be a versatile regulator of virulence expression and that DNA adenine methyltransferase may have an effect on invasion into and adhesion to
host cells of some but not all pathogens [40]. Methylation and the level of DNA adenine methyltransferase
may also influence gene transcription, DNA mismatch
repair, chromosome replication initiation, and nucleoid
structure [41]. B. tribocorum, OY phytoplasma, and O.
tsutsugamushi are known pathogens, while Magnetococcus sp. and P. denitrificans are not. For the pathogenic
bacteria, these paralogs may therefore play a role in
pathogenicity, while the reason for multiple copies of
methyltransferase in the other bacteria remains
unknown. A similar result was the frequent combination
of GO terms for nucleus (GO:0005634) and nuclear part
(GO:0044428) with Halobacterium salinarum (strain
R1), Halobacterium sp., Halorubrum lacusprofundi
(strain ATCC 49239), Natronomonas pharaonis, M. aeruginosa (strain NIES 843), and Photorhabdus luminescens. Since prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, this is an
unexpected result. Most likely, this is a consequence of
some of the paralogs in our data set having orthologs
that are involved in reactions regarding nucleus in
eukaryotes. This highlights an important limitation
when using GO terms in automatic data analysis.
Clusters with high GO similarity and large phylogenetic
distances can highlight common environmental factors

A second approach to analysing the biclustering data
focused on identification of possible convergent evolution. The trivial explanation for high similarity of GO
terms within a cluster is of course that the genomes are

closely related. It is not possible to link such similarity
to adaptive processes. However, by taking the phylogenetic distances within a cluster into account we can
identify clusters with high similarity of GO terms
despite non-similar genomes. In other words, if a cluster
from biclustering has a high internal similarity score on
GO terms and a large phylogenetic distance, it is possible that there are processes stimulating some level of
convergent evolution for organisms in that particular
cluster.
A distance matrix for all the organisms in our analyses
were computed using the Kr-algorithm [42] with 16S
ribosomal protein sequences as input, and by combining
this information with the G-SESAME distance matrix
on GO terms we were able to identify clusters with a
high internal similarity score and a large phylogenetic
distance. The Kr-algorithm computes distances between
unaligned DNA sequences, and this is advantageous for
distantly related species. The evolutionary distances estimated by the Kr-algorithm were verified by comparison
to a pre-computed distance matrix from the Ribosomal
Database Project (RDP) [43]. Further details on this verification are given in Methods. Figure 6 shows the distribution of GO similarity scores and phylogenetic
distances for all clusters. To sort out the interesting
clusters, we defined a cut-off at > 0.1 for genomic distance and > 0.7 for GO similarity (see Figure 6). These
values were estimated to be a reasonable compromise

between genomic diversity, GO similarity and number
of clusters returned for further analysis. This resulted in
a list of 104 clusters, most of these clusters contained
relatively few or rather general GO terms like catabolic
process, intracellular components, membrane, biosynthetic process, and nuclease activity. A list of these clusters is given as Additional file 4, Table S3. However,
there were some clusters with more specialized GO
terms, and a representative subset of these is given in
Table 3, focusing on species where relevant literature
data could be found. In case of overlapping clusters, the
cluster with fewest organisms was included in the table.
The six clusters may be briefly summarized by the
descriptions metal ion binding, cell motility, glycoside
hydrolase, methyltransferase, ion transport, and GTPase
domain, indicating that at least some of these clusters
represent interaction with the environment.
Cluster 1 - metal ion binding

Cluster 1 includes GO terms involved in copper binding.
Copper is a cofactor in a number of proteins. For copper-dependent organisms it is a challenge to keep the
amount of copper at a sufficient level and at the same
time to avoid a too high intracellular level which may
be toxic to the organism [44]. In Dinoroseobacter shibae
(strain DFL 12) the different proteins in the cluster are
identified as a multicopper oxidase type 3 and a merR
family transcriptional regulator. For Mycobacterium gilvum some of the proteins are cytochrome-c oxidase and

Bratlie et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:588

to gain access to scarce copper storages or as a way to
resist copper poisoning.
Cluster 2 - cell motility

Figure 6 Functional similarity (GO) and phylogenetic distance
for all clusters. Each point represents a cluster from biclustering
with similarity score over GO terms (G-SESAME) and phylogenetic
distance between genomes (Kr-algorithm). Cut-off values used for
identification of interesting clusters with high GO similarity and
large genomic distance are indicated.

Consistent with proteome info in HAMAP [21], all of
the organisms in cluster 2 have flagella. In addition to
motility, the flagellum plays a key role in gene expression in many bacteria [48]. It could also play a role in
other processes like adherence to host cells, host cell
invasion, biofilm formation, and protein secretion [48].
For instance, a flagella-minus mutant strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens shows attenuated virulence. It has
also been shown that the flagella of Yersinia species
functions as a secretion system to secrete a virulence
factor [49]. Xanthomonas oryzae causes the vascular disease rice bacterial blight disease where the bacteria
enter the plant through wounded leaf edges. Studies
have shown that the bacteria move towards exudates of
susceptible rice plants whereas no chemotaxis occurs
towards exudates in resistant rice plants. This implies
that chemotaxis play a role in pathogenicity before
penetration of bacteria into the rice leaf. It has also
been shown that mutation in one of the ORFs in the flagellar operon region in X. oryzae leads to weak chemotaxis [49,50]. After the bacteria enter the plant tissue,
flagella may no longer be instrumental to virulence.
Cluster 3 - glycoside hydrolase

copper resistance protein CopC while in N. hamburgensis we find proteins identified as cytochrome-c oxidase.
The Roseobacter lineage is one of the most abundant
groups of bacteria in the oceans, and D. shibae was isolated from marine dinoflagellates. M. gilvum was isolated from river sediment and N. hamburgensis has been
isolated from several environments [21]. Copper is a
trace metal in the ocean, and the planktonic uptake of
this metal may lead to depletion of essential metals in
the surface seawater [25]. D. shibae are aerobic bacteria
able to perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, and are
most likely to be found in the ocean surface were access
to copper is scarce. The organism encodes proteins in
the merR family, a group of metal ion sensing regulators
that bind metals and activate the transcription of proteins involved in metal ion detoxification [45]. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the bacterium has retained
multiple paralogs involved in copper binding for more
efficient uptake and regulation, while the copper resistance protein CopC in M. gilvum may enhance the survival of the bacterium under extreme copper stress, as is
the case e.g. with the copper resistance protein PcoC in
E. coli [46]. Cytochrome-c oxidase is a large transmembrane protein involved in the respiratory electron transport chain, and the protein has two copper centres: CuA
and CuB [47]. Thus the features of this cluster involve
copper handling in one way or another; either as a way

The majority of proteins underlying the GO terms in
cluster 3 belong to the glycoside hydrolase family. This
family includes among others lysozymes, hyaluronidases,
chinitases, esterases, and xylosidases [51]. The enzyme is
involved in degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose,
in anti-bacterial defence strategies (e.g. lysozyme), and
pathogenic mechanisms (e.g. neuraminidase). Anaerocellum thermophilum (strain DSM 6725) is known to utilize a variety of polysaccharides like crystalline cellulose
and hemicellulose [52], while Streptomycetes are one of
the most ubiquitous soil-dwelling bacteria and degrade
insoluble remains of other organisms like chitin and lignocellulose [53]. Both Sodalis glossinidus (strain morsitans) and the two strains of E. coli O157:H7 are
members of the family of enterobacteriaceae and are in
this cluster represented with proteins involved in degradation of cell wall, e.g. lysozyme. E. coli O157:H7 is an
enterohaemorrhagic bacterium that causes haemorrhagic
colitis, a major threat to human health [54] while S.
glossinidus, a maternally transmitted endosymbiont, are
found to infect a wide range of tissue in tsetse flies - the
vector causing sleeping sickness in humans [55]. S. pyogenes belong to group A streptococcus (GAS) causing a
variety of diseases with a wide range of severity in
humans. The bacteria are covered with an outer capsule
made of hyaluronic acid to avoid phagocytosis and to
facilitate adherence to the epithelial cells [56]. Interestingly, the proteins represented in this cluster are

The cluster numbering is for local reference only. The COG classification, based on the most represented COG category in each cluster (see Methods), is shown in
the heading of each cluster. The table shows GO number, description and ontology for each GO term, and name, kingdom, and group for each species.

described as hyaluronidases (some of them as phageassociated), an enzyme that degrades hyaluronic acid.
The enzyme is lowering the viscosity of hyaluronic acid
and thereby increasing the tissue permeability. The hyaluronic acid in the GAS capsule is shown to be structural identical to the mammalian hyaluronic acid, which
is a known substrate for GAS hyaluronidase [56].
According to Starr and Engleberg [56], it has not been
demonstrated experimentally that the bacterial spread in
tissue is facilitated by the hyaluronidase. However, they
showed that hyaluronidase may play a nutritional role
for the organism under nutrient-starved conditions,
making it possible to utilize host hyaluronic acid or its
own capsule as a carbon energy source.
Cluster 4 - methyltransferase

Cluster 4 is represented with GO terms that involve
methyltransferase activity. For O. tsutsugamushi (strain
Ikeda), the proteins are classified as a N6 adenine-specific
DNA-methyltransferase, and for the O. tsutsugamushi
(strain Boryong and Ikeda) the proteins are described
as a site-specific DNA adenine methylase. The genes
from B. tribocorum are classified as helicase/methyltransferase, phage-related modification methylase and
as type III restriction system methylase. In Cyanothece
(strain PCC 7424) we mainly find various families of
transposases while we in Frankia sp. (strain EAN1pec)
mainly find DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase and
transposases. Methylation of adenine or cytosine is a
part of the restriction modification system in bacteria;
by methylating its own DNA by the use of methyltransferases it is possible to separate this DNA from
foreign DNA. The foreign DNA will not be methylated
in this manner and would then be degraded by specific
restriction enzymes. In this way the bacteria is

protected from invasions of e.g. bacteriophages. There
are certain methyltransferases that are not a part of
the restriction modification system, e.g. Dam (DNA
adenine methylase) in gammaproteobacteria and CcrM
(Cell-cycle regulated Methyltransferase) in alphaproteobacteria. Dam catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group
from S-adenosylmethionine to the N6 position of adenine in GATC sequences [40] while CcrM (with a preference for hemi-methylated DNA) methylates the
sequence GANTC and has a role in cell-cycle regulation [57]. DNA cytosine methyltransferase which
methylates the C-5 position of cytosine in CC(A/T)GG
sequences is also not associated with any restriction
enzymes [58]. These methyltransferases are part of the
regulatory system in a cell, including the control of
bacterial virulence; dam mutants of Salmonella enterica, Caenorhabditis elegans, Haemophilus influenzae,
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Y. pestis are reported
to have attenuated virulence [40,58]. Mutation in dam
has also shown a reduction on invasion/adhesion to
host cells in some, but not all, pathogens [40,57].
Three of the organisms in this cluster belong to the
division of alphaproteobacteria where we find the
CcrM protein. Adenine methylation is one of the best
characterized epigenetic mechanisms for regulation of
cell-cycle [59], and a mutation in ccrM is found to be
lethal in A. tumefaciens, Brucella abortus, Caulobacter
crescentus, and Rhizobium meliloti. Cell-cycle regulation is usually a very tightly controlled process, so in

is not clear why the organisms would benefit from
more copies of this gene. It is possible that the different copies of methyltransferase may be so-called

ecoparalogs; they perform the same function under different conditions, e.g. temperature or pH.
Cluster 5 - ion transport

The proteins behind the GO terms in cluster 5 include
many iron-enterobactin ABC transporters and nitrate/
nitrite transporters in E. coli K-12. This strain is found
in the lower gut of animals and survives if released to
the natural environment [3]. Iron is essential for almost
all organisms, but the availability of iron is limited
because of low solubility of Fe 3+. A study by Flo et al
[60] has shown that iron is sequestered by Lipocalin 2
as an immune response during infection, which subsequently limits bacterial growth. To acquire iron, the
microorganisms release siderophores. Enterobactin is
one of the strongest Fe3+-binding siderophores that is
known today [61]. Duplication of enterobactin genes
may make it possible for the organism to colonize in
poor iron niches like the lower gut. In Ralstonia metallidurans (strain CH34) we find proteins described as
heavy metal efflux pump, heavy metal resistance proteins, mercuric transport proteins, Hg(II) resistance protein MerP, and bacterioferritin. Heavy metal resistance
is one of the main properties to the latter organism and
it is therefore often found in sediments and soils with a
high content of heavy metals [62]. It has been suggested
that the metal resistance is an attribute of multiple
layers of efflux pumps with overlapping substrate specificities [63]. In the archaea Methanosarcina barkeri
(strain fusaro), a nitrogen-fixing organism originally isolated from mud samples but also reported to live in the
rumen of cattle [64,65], we find e.g. molybdenum ABC
transporters, iron(III) transporters and mercury ion
binding proteins. Both molybdenum and iron are essential for most living organisms. Molybdenum is readily
available to biological systems and is in fact the most
abundant transition metal found in seawater [66]. On
the other hand, the availability of Fe3+ is scarce because
of limited solubility, as already mentioned. Molybdenum
is shown to stimulate the diazotrophic growth in M.
barkeri, indicating a molybdenum nitrogenase [67]. The
duplication of molybdenum ABC transporters may
enhance the ability to fixate nitrogen, while the iron(III)
ABC transporters make it possible to live where iron
availability is low.

we in M. barkeri and Xanthobacter autotrophicus find
proteins described as cobyrinic acid a, c-diamide
synthase. This latter enzyme catalyzes the conversion of
cobyrinic acid to cobyrinic acid a, c-diamide and is
involved in the B12-pathway. Cluster 6 is an example of
how this type of analysis is sensitive to the quality of
sequence annotation. The proteins in this cluster belong
to two different groups with respect to the type of process they are involved in; chromosome partitioning and
vitamin B12 synthesis. Most of the proteins in the cluster contain a Ras-like GTPase domain, and they are
therefore annotated by automatic procedures as functionally related. However, the Ras-like GTPase domain
is conserved and widespread in many different proteins
[68], and these proteins are not necessarily found in the
same pathways. This cluster of paralogs is therefore artificially enlarged by merging together proteins that are
not functionally related at a level that is relevant for this
analysis.
Even though the mechanisms and the functions of the
proteins are not reviewed in full detail in this paper, it is
clear that most of the overrepresented GO terms in
these clusters can be associated with adaptation to the
environment in which the organisms are living.

Conclusions
We have used statistically overrepresented GO terms
associated with duplicated genes to show that these
genes often represent features that may give a competitive advantage to the particular organisms when adapting to environmental conditions. We have identified
examples of unrelated prokaryotes possibly showing
convergent evolution towards a shared environmental
niche. We have also investigated functional differences
between genes that may and may not handle gene duplication, based on functional COG classification and comparison of paralogs versus singletons. The analysis
seems to confirm the hypothesis that paralogs can be
associated with adaptive interactions with the environment of the prokaryote. However, the analysis also
shows that incomplete or inconsistent annotation as
well as ambiguous annotation terms is an important
limiting factor regarding automated data analysis.

Cluster 6 - GTPase domain

Methods

The protein from Borrelia burgdorferi represented in
cluster 6 is described as a CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA
nucleotide binding protein, and by comparing this
sequence to the COG database by the use of COGnitor,
the protein is classified in COG category D and
described as “ATPases involved in chromosome partitioning”. The proteins from Halobacterium sp. (strain
NRC-1) are also described as different kinds of chromosome partitioning proteins (sojB, sojC, and sojD), while

Data sets

897 complete prokaryotic proteomes were downloaded
from NCBI ftp-server [22] in June 2009. For each proteome, a BlastP [69] search against itself was performed
and the paralogs were identified using a 75% sequence
identity threshold. Maximum number of Blast hits was
set to 1000, unless the E-score from Blast exceeded a
threshold of 10-5. The 200 organisms with the highest
paralog fraction, not considering the number of copies

Bratlie et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:588
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/588

of each paralog, were included in the main analysis. To
avoid bias because of different genome sizes, the paralog
fraction was defined as the ratio between the number of
proteins with paralogs and the total number of proteins
in each respective organism.
Graph-representation of similarities between species

Pairwise similarity between species was estimated as the
number of common terms in the lists of overrepresented annotation terms from DAVID [26], using all
terms (not only GO). In order to reduce the number of
random pairwise links at least 10 common terms were
required, and the overlap should cover at least 30% of
the maximum possible overlap between the two species.
The nodes (species) and edges (number of common
terms) were loaded into Cytoscape [27], and the map
layout was estimated by Cytoscape using the EdgeWeighted Spring Embedded algorithm with the number
of common terms as edge weights. Alternative schemes
for edge weights were tested, but this had only minor
influence on the final result.
Functional classification of paralogs and clusters of
paralogs and species

The paralogs were classified into COGs according to the
ptt-files at NCBI. Some paralogs could not be classified,
these are registered as “-”. Proteins that were classified
in two COG categories (e.g. because of multiple
domains) were registered in both categories. This paralog classification was used when comparing COG distribution of paralogs and singletons.
The overall COG classification of clusters was based
on the same classification as mentioned above, however
this classification represents a consensus where the
COG category matching the highest number of paralogs
in the cluster determines the cluster classification. Additionally, for each of the GO terms included in a cluster
we counted the different COG categories for all paralogs
included in that GO. The GO term was then assigned a
COG category according to the most frequently occurring COG group. The overall functional classification of
the cluster was based on all the paralogs in the cluster,
not the individual GO term classification. Therefore the
overall cluster classification may differ from the COG
classification associated with individual GO terms.
Overrepresentation analysis

The overrepresentation analysis was performed using
three different data sets. The paranome from each
organism was used as test set in all cases, whereas the
three different background sets consisted of all paralogs,
all proteomes, and individual proteomes.
The different data sets were analysed by an overrepresentation analysis using DAVID. Only GO terms with a

Page 15 of 17

Bonferroni-corrected significance < 0.01 were taken into
account, and the identical GO term had to be found in
minimum three organisms to be included in the results.
The overrepresented GO terms and organisms were
clustered with the BiMax algorithm in BicAT version
2.22 [16], using default settings. Clusters for the three
data sets were exported from BicAT for further analyses.
Only 167 of the initial 200 organisms were included in
the exported clusters; 29 of the 33 lacking organisms
contained zero or only one GO term, and the remaining
four organisms had a unique combination of two GO
terms that were not found in other organisms, thus
these organisms could not be clustered. All clusters containing only different strains of E. coli were removed
from further analyses.
Computing GO similarity scores for clusters using GSESAME

The GO terms from the clusters were compared against
itself with G-SESAME [28] (web server) which computed a similarity score based on the semantic similarity
within each cluster. The average GO similarity score for
each cluster was computed, and a total average similarity score was computed for each of the three background models. A box and whiskers plot based on the
similarity scores was used to compare the different
models (Figure 5). The data set with all paralogs as
background had the highest average similarity score,
implying the most unambiguous clusters, thus this data
set was chosen for further analyses.
Computing phylogenetic distance and verification of Kralgorithm

The Kr-algorithm version 2.0.2 [42] for alignment-free
computation of evolutionary distances was used locally
with default settings. FASTA sequences for 16S Ribosomal protein (frn-files) for all organisms were downloaded
from the ftp-server at NCBI [22]. The first 16S ribosomal
protein in each genome was used. The protein could not
be found in 15 of the organisms, for these cases the ribosomal protein sequences were fetched from RDP [43]. A
distance matrix for 167 organisms was computed by running the Kr-algorithm. The pre-calculated distance
matrices from RDP were our initial choice, but could not
be used because some of the organisms in our analyses
were not included in this database. To verify that the Kralgorithm gave evolutionary distances similar to alignment-based estimates we compared it against the RDP
distance matrix. Genbank IDs for 137 of the 200 organisms could be mapped and uploaded into RDP. A precomputed distance matrix based on the 137 organisms
was downloaded. The FASTA sequences of 16S ribosomal proteins for the 137 organisms were downloaded
and then used as input in Kr and a distance matrix based

Bratlie et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:588
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/588

on this algorithm was computed. The two distance
matrices, based on RDP and Kr respectively, are compared in Figure S2 in Additional file 5 and show a good
correlation (r =0.94).
