Abstract
Background: Pyrenophora teres f. teres is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen and the cause of one of barley’s most
important diseases, net form of net blotch. Here we report the first genome assembly for this species based solely
on short Solexa sequencing reads of isolate 0-1. The assembly was validated by comparison to BAC sequences,
ESTs, orthologous genes and by PCR, and complemented by cytogenetic karyotyping and the first genome-wide
genetic map for P. teres f. teres.
Results: The total assembly was 41.95 Mbp and contains 11,799 gene models of 50 amino acids or more.
Comparison against two sequenced BACs showed that complex regions with a high GC content assembled
effectively. Electrophoretic karyotyping showed distinct chromosomal polymorphisms between isolates 0-1 and
15A, and cytological karyotyping confirmed the presence of at least nine chromosomes. The genetic map spans
2477.7 cM and is composed of 243 markers in 25 linkage groups, and incorporates simple sequence repeat
markers developed from the assembly. Among predicted genes, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and efflux
pumps in particular appear to have undergone a P. teres f. teres-specific expansion of non-orthologous gene
families.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that paired-end Solexa sequencing can successfully capture coding regions
of a filamentous fungal genome. The assembly contains a plethora of predicted genes that have been implicated
in a necrotrophic lifestyle and pathogenicity and presents a significant resource for examining the bases for P. teres
f. teres pathogenicity.

Background
Net blotch of barley (Hordeum vulgare) is caused by
Pyrenophora teres Drechsler (anamorph Drechslera teres
[Sacc.] Shoem.). P. teres is an ascomycete within the
class Dothideomycetes and order Pleosporales. This
order contains plant pathogens responsible for many
necrotrophic diseases in crops, including members of
the genera Ascochyta, Cochliobolus, Pyrenophora, Leptosphaeria and Stagonospora. Net blotch is a major disease
worldwide that causes barley yield losses of 10 to 40%,
although complete loss can occur with susceptible cultivars in the absence of fungicide treatment [1]. In Australia the value of disease control is estimated at $246
million annually with average direct costs of $62 million

annually, making it the country’s most significant barley
disease [2].
Net blotch exists in two morphologically indistinguishable but genetically differentiated forms: P. teres f. teres
(net form of net blotch, NFNB) and P. teres f. maculata
(spot form of net blotch, SFNB) [3,4]. These forms have
been proposed as distinct species based on the divergence of MAT sequences in comparison to Pyrenophora
graminea [4]. Additionally, it has been suggested that
limited gene flow may occur between the two forms
[5,6]. As their names indicate, the two forms show different disease symptoms. NFNB produces lattice-like
symptoms, in which necrosis develops along leaf veins
with occasional transverse striations. SFNB displays
more discrete, rounded lesions, often surrounded by a
chlorotic zone. NFNB and SFNB may both be present in
the same region but with one form prevailing in individual locales. NFNB has historically been regarded as the

more significant of the two diseases, but in recent years
there have been reports of SFNB epidemics, notably in
regions of Australia and Canada [7,8].
Only recently have researchers begun to focus on the
molecular and genetic aspects of P. teres pathogenesis
and host-pathogen interactions. NFNB is known to produce non-host selective low molecular weight compounds that cause chlorosis on barley leaves [9]. Both
forms also produce phytotoxic proteinaceous effectors
in culture [10,11]. It has been suggested that these effectors are responsible for the brown necrotic component
of the disease symptoms on susceptible cultivars. Host
resistance to P. teres appears to conform to the genefor-gene model [12]. Both dominant and recessive resistance loci have been reported that are genetically distinct. These are host genotype, form, and isolate
specific, and occur along with multigenic/quantitative
resistance on each of the barley chromosomes [13,14].
Little is known at the molecular level about the
mechanisms of P. teres pathogenicity, with neither the
mechanism of virulence nor host resistance known. A
genome assembly offers a powerful resource to assist
the dissection of virulence mechanisms by providing
suites of genetic markers to characterize and isolate
genes associated with virulence and avirulence via mapbased cloning. It also enables potential effector candidate genes to be identified from partially purified active
fractions in conjunction with mass spectrometry peptide
analysis. The sequencing and assembly of fungal genomes to date have relied primarily on Sanger sequencing
with read lengths of 700 to 950 bp. Several newer
sequencing technologies are now available that are
orders of magnitude less expensive, although currently
they exhibit shorter read lengths. These include Roche/
454 pyrosequencing (400 to 500 bp) and Illumina/Solexa
sequencing (currently up to 100 bp). Recent improvements, including paired-end sequencing (reads from
each end of longer DNA fragments) and continuing
increases in read lengths should make the de novo
assembly of high quality eukaryotic genomes possible.
Filamentous fungal genomes are relatively small and
contain a remarkably consistent number of genes. Their
genomes range in size from 30 to 100 Mbp and contain
10,000 to 13,000 predicted genes [15]. Their reduced
complexity and small size relative to most eukaryotes
makes them amenable to assessing the suitability of new
sequencing technologies. These technologies have
recently been described in the assembly of the filamentous fungus Sordaria macrospora [16], which involved a
hybrid assembly of Solexa 36-bp reads and 454 sequencing. The objectives of this study were to assemble the
genome of P. teres f. teres based on Solexa sequencing
chemistry only, to validate the assembly given the short
read lengths (in this study, 75-bp paired ends), and to

Page 2 of 14

provide initial characterization of the draft genome. We
have complemented the assembly with the first cytogenetic visualization and genome-wide genetic map for
this species.

Results
The genome of P. teres f. teres isolate 0-1 was sequenced
using Illumina’s Solexa sequencing platform with pairedend 75-bp reads. The Solexa run in a single flow cell
yielded over 833 Mbp of sequence data, or approximately 20 times coverage of the final assembly length.
Optimal kmer length in the parallel assembler Assembly
By Short Sequences (ABySS) v. 1.0.14 [17] occurred at k
= 45 and n = 5. This yielded a N 50 where 50% of the
assembly is contained in the largest 408 scaffolds and an
L50 whereby 50% of the genome is contained in scaffolds
of 26,790 bp or more. The total assembly size was 41.95
Mbp. Summary statistics of the assembly are presented
in Table 1.
The Solexa sequencing reads that were used for the P.
teres f. teres 0-1 genome assembly have been deposited
in the NCBI sequence read archive [GenBank:
SRA020836]. This whole genome shotgun project
assembly has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank
under the accession [GenBank: AEEY00000000]. The
version described in this paper [GenBank:
AEEY01000000] is the first version. Note NCBI does
not accept contigs less than 200 bp in whole genome
submissions, unless such sequences are important to the
assembly, for example, they contribute to scaffolds or
are gene coding regions. In addition, all scaffold nucleotide sequences, predicted coding region nucleotide
sequences, and translated amino acid sequences are provided in Additional files 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
Both the initial contigs (composed of unpaired reads)
and the scaffolds contained a large number of short
sequences. In total there were 147,010 initial contigs
with an N 50 of 493 and an L 50 of 22,178 bp. This

compared with a total of 146,737 scaffolds. The majority
of initial contigs (140,326 of 147,010) were 200 bp or
less, and were shared with the scaffold file. Such short
contigs are a result of reads from repetitive regions. In
AbySS, where highly similar repetitive regions occur, a
‘bubble’ removal algorithm simplifies the repeats to a
single sequence. Thus, short isolated ‘singletons’ occur
that were not assembled into scaffolds. Gene rich, more
complex regions of the genome were represented by
6,684 scaffolds containing over 80% of the assembled
sequences.
The assembly contains 11,799 predicted gene models
of 50 amino acids or more. Most of the predicted genes
(93.5%) were conserved within other species and of
these conserved genes, 45.2% showed very high homology with a BLASTP e-value of 0. As a further confirmation of the success in capturing gene-rich regions, the
percentage of complete genes (genes with defined start
and stop codons) was 97.57%.
To validate the assembly over relatively large distances, the assembly was compared to two Sanger
sequenced BACs, designated 8F17 and 1H13. Direct
BLASTN [18] against assembly scaffolds showed that
complex or regions with a high GC content assembled
effectively (Figure 1). BAC 1H13 contains several lowcomplexity regions containing repetitive sequences, in
which Solexa reads were over-represented and where

Page 3 of 14

only short scaffold assemblies are evident (Additional
file 4).
To validate the assembly over short distances of moderately low complexity, and to provide a resource for
genetic mapping and genetic diversity studies, we created a set of simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Motif
repeats ranged in size from 34 bp with 100% identity
and 0% indels to 255 bp with 64% identity and 1%
indels. We examined the amplification of a subset (75)
of the primer pairs and all gave unambiguous single
bands and robust amplification. Primer characteristics
and amplicon sizes for the 75 SSRs are provided in
Additional file 5. The markers also readily amplified single bands in an isolate of P. teres f. maculata, albeit
with slightly lower efficiency in 20% of the reactions. As
a demonstration of their utility, three markers that were
polymorphic between P. teres f. teres and f. maculata
were used to fingerprint eight randomly selected isolates
of each form (Table 2). Markers (ACA) 18 -34213 and
(CTG)19 -61882 were highly polymorphic in P. teres f.
teres and f. maculata, respectively, with eight and five
alleles. Form-specific diagnostic band sizes are evident

from the data, but with overlap in the ranges of allele
sizes of each form for (CAT)13-49416, and for (ACA)1834213 at 197 bp.
In addition to the above assembly validations, we
compared 50 randomly selected non-homologous ESTs
against the assembly to determine their presence; 49
gave unambiguous matches, with the highest e-value
cutoff <10 -80 , and one gave no hit. This orphan EST
showed no BLASTX similarity to any sequence in GenBank and might be regarded as a library contaminant.
Forty-seven (96%) of the remaining ESTs were predicted
by GeneMark.
Electrophoretic and cytological karyotyping of P. teres f.
teres

To estimate the genome size of P. teres f. teres by
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFG), isolate 0-1 was
examined and compared to isolate 15A. Isolate 0-1
showed at least seven chromosome bands as indicated
in Figure 2, with estimated sizes of 6.0, 4.9, 4.7, 3.9, 3.6,
3.4, and 3 Mbp. The brightness of the band at 6.0 Mbp
indicated the presence of at least two chromosomes,
and was further resolved into bands of 5.8 and 6.2 Mbp
on a second longer electrophoresis run (image not
shown). The relative brightness of the 3.4 Mbp band
indicates two and possibly three chromosomes are comigrating. The smallest band visible in Figure 2 is less
than 1 Mbp and is most likely mitochondrial DNA.

separations of P. teres f. teres chromosomes. (a) Electrokaryotypes of isolate 0-1 with nine chromosomal bands indicated.
(b) Chromosome level polymorphisms between isolates 0-1 and
15A.

Thus, there is a minimum of nine and as many as eleven chromosomes present in isolate 0-1. This gave an
estimated genome size of between 35.5 and 42.3 Mbp.
Isolate 15A shows conspicuous differences in the lengths
of the chromosomes for intermediate sized bands
(greater than 3 Mbp and less than 6 Mbp), and appears
to have two bands around 3 Mbp.
Cytological karyotyping of isolate 0-1 using the germ
tube burst method (GTBM) is depicted in Figure 3.
Most of the discharged nuclei (above 90%) were
observed at interphase (Figure 3a) where the chromosomes exist in the form of chromatin and are enclosed
by the nuclear membrane. Of the remaining 10%, most
of the chromosomes were either in early metaphase or
clumped and entangled together, making it difficult to
distinguish chromosomes (Figure 3b). In a few nuclei,
condensed metaphase chromosomes were spread out
sufficiently and we were able to count at least nine
chromosomes (highlighted in Figure 3c). The four largest chromosomes are longer than or equal to 2 μm.
The remainder depicted are smaller, but likely to be
longer than 1 μm. The four largest chromosomes likely
correspond to the four bands shown in PFG electrophoresis that have sizes greater than 3.9 Mbp.
Gene content

The genome assembly as a whole contains many predicted genes that have been implicated in pathogenicity.
Genes encoding efflux pumps have roles in multidrug
and fungicide resistance and toxic compound exclusion.
For example, the ABC1 transporter in Magnaporthe grisea protects the fungus against azole fungicides and the

rice phytoalexin sakuranetin [19]. These genes are especially prevalent, with 79 homologues including representatives of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC), major
facilitator, and multi antimicrobial extrusion protein
superfamilies. Proteins encoded by other notable gene
family members are the highly divergent cytochrome
P450 s [20], which are involved in mono-oxidation reactions, one member of which has been shown to detoxify
the antimicrobial pea compound pisatin [21]; the siderophores, which contribute to iron sequestration and resistance to oxidative and abiotic stresses but which also
have essential roles in protection against antimicrobials
and formation of infection structures [22,23]; and the
tetraspanins, which are required for pathogenicity in
several plant pathogenic fungi, one of which is homologous to the newly uncovered Tsp3 family [24].
Genome-specific expansion of non-orthologous gene
families

Cluster analysis of P. teres f. teres genes in OrthoMCL
[25] against the closely related Dothideomycetes species
for which genomes and/or ESTs have been made publicly available (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, Cochliobolus
heterostrophus, Stagonospora nodorum, Leptosphaeria
maculans, Mycosphaerella graminicola, together with
two Ascochyta spp. sequenced in-house, Ascochyta
rabiei and Phoma medicaginis (Ramisah Mod Shah and
Angela Williams, personal communication) was used to
reveal P. teres f. teres-specific expansion of gene families.
The largest group of these were new members of class I
and II transposable elements (Figure 4). Class I transposable elements are retrotransposons that use a RNA
intermediate and reverse transcriptase to replicate, while
class II transposons use a transposase to excise and
reinsert a copy. In total, 36 clusters of new class I and II
transposable elements are present in the assembly.
A prominent feature of expanded gene families in P.
teres f. teres is a substantial expansion in specialized
multi-functional enzymes known as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases
(PKSs) that produce secondary metabolites. The nonorthologous NRPSs are present in 10 clusters of 22
genes. NRPSs catalyze the production of cyclic peptides
to form a diverse range of products, including antibiotics and siderophores, and are known to be phytotoxic
[26]. Among plant pathogenic Pleosporales fungi, HC
toxin from Cochliobolus carbonum [27] and AM toxin
from Alternaria alternata [28] are notable examples.
Also evident are hybrid NRPS-PKSs [29] in two clusters
of four genes. PKSs produce polyketides in a manner
similar to fatty acid biosynthesis. In fungi, better known
polyketides are the mycotoxins fumonisin and autofusarin, and the phytotoxin cercosporin [30]. Hybrid
NRPS-PKSs occur where PKS and NRPS modules

coexist and add to the complexity of secondary metabolites. Most of the remaining non-orthologous gene clusters include homologues to genes involved with
secondary metabolism and signaling. Investigations into
the functional significance of these genes may provide
new insights into the requirements of this pathogen.
Also present are six non-orthologous genes encoding
antibiotic and multi-drug resistance proteins that may

Ellwood et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R109

have a role against toxic plant compounds. Indeed, the
P. teres f. teres assembly as a whole contains ten genes
with homology to ABC drug transporters.

Comparisons between plant pathogenic ascomycetes S.
nodorum and M. grisea with the saprophyte Neurospora
crassa [31,32] have both shown the expansion of
secreted gene families consistent with their roles as
plant pathogens. P. teres f. teres contains a large number
of genes (1,031) predicted to be secreted by both WolfPSORT [33] and SignalP [34]. A significant proportion of
these genes in P. teres f. teres (85%) are homologous
with P. tritici repentis, as might be expected given their
close phylogenetic relationship. This contrasts with 54%
of the predicted genes in S. nodorum for which no phylogenetically close relative was sequenced [32]. Of the
remaining genes, a small number (1.6%) show strongest
homology to species outside the Pleosporales, while 6%
are unique to P. teres f. teres isolate 0-1 with no functional annotation. These genes may include genes that
have been laterally transferred.
In Blast2GO [35,36], 61.6% of the predicted genes
were annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms. GO
annotations are limited to well characterized genes but
they do provide a useful overview. A large proportion of
predicted genes encode proteins associated with plant
cell wall and cutin degradation, presumably to degrade
plant tissue during necrotrophic growth. Most are protein and carbohydrate hydrolases, together with carbohydrate binding proteins that target various
polysaccharides (Table 3). For example, there are nine
and seven predicted gene products with homology to
cellulose binding proteins and cellulases, respectively,
and five and four predicted gene products with homology to cutin binding proteins and cutinases, respectively.
Predicted proteins annotated with the GO term ‘pathogenesis’ include homologues of glycosyl hydrolases, cutinase precursors, surface antigens, and a monoxygenase
related to maackiain detoxification protein from Nectria
haematococca [37].

Marker development and linkage map construction

A total of 279 amplified fragment length polymorphisms
(AFLPs) were generated that were polymorphic between
the mapping population parents 15A and 0-1 using 96
primer combinations of 8 MseI primers and 12 EcoRI
primers (Additional file 6). On average, each pair produced approximately three polymorphic AFLPs. We
identified a total of 68 polymorphic SSRs for genetic
mapping; 44 from the genome assembly sequence, 20
from sequence tagged microsatellite site (STMS) markers [38], and 4 from ESTs (Additional file 5). In addition to AFLPs and SSRs, five random amplified

polymorphic DNA markers associated with AvrHar [39]
and the mating type locus were genotyped across 78
progeny from the 15A × 0-1 cross. All markers were
tested for segregation ratio distortion; 69 (19%) were significantly different from the expected 1:1 ratio at P =
0.05, of which 32 were distorted at P = 0.01.
The genetic map was initially constructed with a total
of 354 markers composed of 279 AFLPs, 68 SSRs, 5 random amplified polymorphic DNA markers, and a single
mating type locus marker. The markers were first
assigned into groups using a minimum LOD (logarithm

Ellwood et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R109
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/11/R109

of the odds) threshold of 5.0 and a maximum θ = 0.3.
We excluded 111 markers from the map because they
had a LOD <3 by RIPPLE in MAPMAKER [40]. The
final genetic map was composed of 243 markers in 25
linkage groups, with each linkage group having at least
3 markers. The map spans 2,477.7 cM in length, with
an average marker density of approximately one marker
per ten centiMorgans (Figures 5 and 6). Individual linkage groups ranged from 24.9 cM (LG25) to 392.0 cM
(LG1), with 3 and 35 markers, respectively. Three of the
linkage groups had a genetic distance greater than 200
cM and 10 linkage groups had genetic distances of less
than 50 cM, leaving 12 medium-sized linkage groups
ranging between 50 and 200 cM. Other than a 30-cM
gap on LG2.1, the markers are fairly evenly distributed
on the linkage groups without obvious clustering. Linkage groups 2.1 and 2.2 are provisionally aligned together
in Figure 5 as they may represent a single linkage group.
This association is based on forming a single linkage
group at LOD = 2, and by comparative mapping of SSR
scaffold sequences with the P. tritici-repentis assembly
(data not shown). The mating type locus mapped to
linkage group LG4, and except for six of the small linkage groups, each linkage group has at least one SSR
marker, which may allow comparisons to closely related
genome sequences.

Discussion
This is the first wholly Illumina-based assembly of an
ascomycete genome and the third assembly to be
reported for a necrotrophic plant pathogenic ascomycete
[31,32]. As might be expected, the P. teres f. teres genome assembly demonstrates that the short paired-end
reads can be used to effectively capture higher complexity gene-containing regions. The assembly was validated
by comparison to BAC sequences, ESTs and by direct
amplification of predicted sequences across SSRs. Based
on the published assemblies for the phytopathogens M.
grisea and S. nodorum [31,32], the number of predicted
genes in P. teres f. teres is similar (11,089 versus 11,109
and 10,762, for genes larger than 100 amino acids or S.
nodorum version 2 gene models, respectively). Gene prediction algorithms, even when trained on ESTs from the
species in question, are unlikely to correctly predict all
coding regions in more complex genomes, and in some
instances require further corroborating data from
approaches such as proteomics and mass-spectrometry
[41]. Thus, the true number of genes may be less dependent on the assembly per se and gene models may be
further adjusted, concatenated or introduced.
The inevitable corollary of an assembly based on short
paired-end reads is that low-complexity regions (containing low GC content, simple microsatellites and repetitive DNA) are under-represented. As a consequence,

the assembly is composed of a large number of singleton
contigs that are inappropriate for estimating the genomic proportions of such regions. To support the minimum estimate of the genome size based on the
assembly, and to provide basic information on chromosome composition, we conducted PFG and GTBM karyotyping. From the PFG results, we concluded that P.
teres f. teres most likely contains a minimum of 9 chromosomes but with band intensities suggesting 11 chromosomes is possible. This provided an estimated
genome size of at least 35.5 Mbp and an upper value of
42.3 Mbp. Clumping and co-migration of bands is a
common phenomenon in PFG, as shown, for example,
by Eusebio-Cope et al. [42]. Resolution of co-migrating
bands requires techniques such as Southern blotting
[43] and fluorescence in situ hybridization [44] for accurate discrimination. However, the cytological karyotyping correlated with the PFG results in depicting at least
nine chromosomes. An upper estimate of nine chromosomes was postulated for P. teres by Aragona et al. [45],
although that study did not identify which P. teres form
was examined, and the technique used gave poor resolution of bands between 4.5 and >6 Mbp. Overall, the
total assembly size in this study correlates with the
higher estimate by elecrophoretic karyotyping and indicates a genome of at least 42 Mbp. This is somewhat
larger than the Pleosporales assemblies reported to date
for Cochliobolus heterostrophus (34.9 Mbp; Joint Genome Institute), P. tritici-repentis (37.8 Mbp; NCBI) and
S. nodorum (37.1 Mbp [32]).
An expansion in genome size compared to other
Pleosporales might be explained by the presence in the
assembly of new classes of transposable elements and
large numbers of novel repeats (over 60, although these
data are incomplete due to poor assembly of degraded
regions and therefore have not been shown). These in
turn may also explain the large PFG chromosomal level
polymorphisms between the two isolates examined here
and the relatively large genetic map. Chromosomal level
polymorphisms are a feature of some ascomycetes [46].
Among plant pathogenic fungi, there is growing evidence that host-specificity genes and effectors are
located in or next to transposon-rich regions [31,47].
This provides opportunities for horizontal acquisition,
duplication and further diversification to generate new,
species-specific genetic diversity or, where they are
recognized as an avirulence gene, to be lost, a process
that may also aid host range expansion. The contribution of transposons in P. teres f. teres pathogenicity has
yet to be determined, although we have preliminary data
showing that the avirulence gene AvrHar is associated
with transposon repeats on the second largest chromosome. There is no evidence in P. teres f. teres for small
chromosomes <2 Mbp, as in N. haematococca and A.

alternate, where they confer host-specific virulence
[48,49], and in Fusarium oxysporum, where they have
been demonstrated to be mobile genetic elements conferring virulence to non-pathogenic strains [50].
The analysis of the gene content of the genome
assembly shows that it shares many of the characteristics of similar plant pathogenic fungi, and strong homology to most genes from P. tritici-repentis. These include
highly diverse proteins involved in host contact, signal
transduction, secondary metabolite production and
pathogenesis. Secreted proteins are of particular interest
to plant pathologists since they represent the key interface of host-pathogen interactions, notably avirulence
proteins and effectors. These are key components of
inducing disease resistance and promoting disease, while
expressed effector proteins offer tangible discriminating
resistance assay tools in a variety of breeding programs.
This is because fungal necrotrophic disease is the sum
of the contribution of individual effectors [51,52] and
single, purified effectors give a qualitative response
when infiltrated into leaves. However, effector genes

often encode small, cysteine-rich proteins with little or
no orthology to known genes. Examples include Avr2
and Avr4 in Cladosporium fulvum, Avr3 in F. oxysporum
(reviewed in [53]), ToxA and ToxB in P. tritici repentis
[54,55] and SnToxA and SnTox3 in S. nodorum [56,57].
Identifying candidate effectors in the genome assembly
in conjunction with genetic mapping, functional studies
and proteomic approaches will in future aid their
isolation.
We provide the first genetic linkage map of P. teres f.
teres. The total length is nearly 2,500 cM, longer than
that reported for other ascomycete fungal pathogens;
1,216 cM for M. graminicola [58], 1,329 cM for Cochliobus sativus [59], and 900 cM for M. grisea [60]. However, a genetic map of 359 loci for the powdery mildew
fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, an obligate biotrophic pathogen of barley, covered 2,114 cM [61]. The
length of the genetic map of P. teres f. teres may be a
function of the relatively large genome size and the presence of large numbers of recombinogenic repetitive elements. This is paralleled by a greater number of linkage

Ellwood et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R109
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/11/R109

groups (25) compared to the estimated number of chromosomes that may also be suggestive of interspersed
tracts of repetitive DNA.
The genetic map and karyotyping data will be instrumental in a final assembly of the P. teres f. teres genome,
as they will allow scaffolds to be orientated and tiled
onto linkage groups. A combination of the genome
assembly and the genetic map provides an invaluable
resource to identify potential effector candidate genes
from phytotoxic protein fractions in conjunction with
mass spectrometry peptide analysis. Genetically characterized SSRs provided in this study will also provide an
important resource for the community in comparative
mapping, gene-flow and genetic diversity studies.
Further validation, assembly of low-complexity sequence
regions, and genome annotation are now underway
using proteomic approaches and 454 pyrosequencing.
The priority now is to fully understand the mechanism
of pathogenicity in P. teres f. teres in order to achieve a
solution to control this pathogen.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates that the successful assembly of
more complex and gene-rich regions of a filamentous
fungus is possible using paired-end Solexa sequencing.
The approach provides a cost-effective means of directly
generating marker resources that would previously have
been prohibitively expensive with modest research funding. At 42 Mbp or more, the genome of P. teres f. teres
0-1 is larger by comparison to closely related Pleosporales members, and has a correspondingly large genetic
map. The genome is dynamic, in that different isolates
show obvious chromosomal level differences, while fractionated linkage groups and the length of the genetic
map also suggest an abundance of repetitive DNA. In
common with other plant pathogens, P. teres f. teres
contains a rich diversity of predicted genes, notably protein and carbohydrate hydrolases, efflux pumps, cytochrome P450 genes, siderophores, tetraspanins, nonribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases,
and a complex secretome that can be attributed to its
lifestyle. Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and efflux
pumps in particular appear to have undergone a P. teres
f. teres-specific expansion of non-othologous gene
families. The assembly presented provides researchers
with an excellent resource to further examine net blotch
pathogenicity and plant-microbe interactions in general.
Materials and methods
Origin of P. teres isolates

The NFNB isolate sequenced in this study, 0-1, was originally collected in Ontario, Canada [39]. Isolate 15A
(10-15-19), the opposite parental isolate used to develop
a mapping population, was collected from Solano

Page 10 of 14

County, California [62]. The remaining NFNB isolates
(Cad 1-3, Cor 2, Cun 1-1, Cun 3-2, NB100, OBR, Stir 92, and Won 1-1) were collected in Western Australia by
S Ellwood in the 2009 barley growing season. SFNB isolates WAC10721, WAC10981, WAC11177, and
WAC11185 were obtained from the Department of
Agriculture and Food, Western Australia (3, Baron Hay
Court, South Perth, Western Australia 6151); isolates
Cad 6-4, Mur 2, NFR, and SG1-1 were collected in
Western Australia by S Ellwood during 2009.
Electrophoretic and cytological karyotyping
Protoplasting and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis

Chromosome size and number were analyzed for North
American NFNB isolates; 0-1 and 15A, previously used
to develop a genetic cross for identifying avirulence
genes [39,63]. Fungal protoplasts were prepared using a
protocol established for S. nodorum as described by Liu
et al. [56] with some modifications. Briefly, conidia were
harvested from 7-day fungal cultures and inoculated
into 60 ml liquid Fries medium in 250 ml Erlenmeyer
flasks. After growth at 27°C in a shaker (100 rpm) for
48 h, the fungal tissue was then homogenized in a Waring blender and re-inoculated into 200 ml liquid Fries
medium in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The fungus was
grown under the same growth conditions for 24 h.
Mycelium was harvested by filtering through two layers
of Miracloth, washed thoroughly with water and finally
with mycelial wash solution (MWS: 0.7 M KCl and 10
mM CaCl2). Around 2 g (wet weight) of mycelial tissue
was then transferred into a Petri dish (100 × 20 mm)
containing 40 ml filter-sterilized protoplasting solution
containing 40 mg/ml b-d-glucanase, 0.8 mg/ml chitinase, and 5 mg/ml driselase (Interspex Product Inc., San
Mateo, CA, USA) in MWS. The Petri dish was shaken
at 70 rpm at 28°C for at least 5 h. Protoplasts were filtered through four layers of Miracloth and pelleted by
centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 minutes at room temperature, followed by another wash with MWS and pelleting. Protoplasts were resuspended in MWS to a final
concentration of 2 × 108 protoplasts/ml and mixed with
an equal volume of 2% low melting temperature agarose
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) dissolved in
MWS. Agarose plugs were made by pipetting 80 μl of
the mixture into plug molds (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Once solidified, plugs were placed in 20 ml Proteinase K
reaction buffer containing 100 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1%
N-lauroyl sarcosine, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate and 1
mg/ml Proteinase K (USBiological, Swampscott, MA,
USA) at 50°C for 24 h. Plugs were washed four times in
10 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 50 mM EDTA for 1 h with
gentle agitation, then stored in 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) at
4°C. PFG was performed on a Bio-Rad CHEF Mapper
system. Separation of chromosomes in the 1 to 6 Mb

range was carried out in 1.0× TAE at 14°C using 0.8%
Low EEO agarose gel (USBiological). Run time was 72 h
at 2 V/cm (70 V) with a 20- to 40-minute switch time
ramp at an angle of 106°.
Spore germination and germ tube burst cytological
karyotyping

Conidia were washed with water from 7-day cultures
grown on V8 potato dextrose agar (V8PDA) plates, filtered through two layers of miracloth and centrifuged at
3,000 × g for 5 minutes. Conidia were washed twice
with potato dextrose broth and re-suspended in this
with a final concentration of 4 × 10 5 spores/ml.
Approximately 400 μl of spore suspension was placed
onto slides coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich
Corp., St Louis, MO, USA) and covered by a 22 × 40
mm piece of parafilm to keep moist. All slides were
kept in a sealed plastic box at room temperature for 3
h, and then moved to the fridge for cold treatment overnight. Slides were dipped in H 2 O to carefully remove
the covers and then placed in a methanol/acetic acid
(22:3) solution overnight to fix fungal tissue. The slides
were flame dried to burst cells and release chromosomes. Slides were stained for 5 minutes in the dark
with 1 μg/ml 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 μg/ml Flourescent Brightener 28
(Sigma-Aldrich) in anti-fade mounting solution. Slides
were examined and photographed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 epiflourescent microscope.
Genome sequence acquisition
Whole shotgun genome sequencing

DNA of P. teres f. teres isolate 0-1 was extracted using a
Biosprint DNA Plant Kit and a BioSprint 15 automated
workstation (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Genomic
sequencing was performed on a Solexa sequencing platform at the Allan Wilson Centre (Massey University,
Palmerston North, New Zealand). DNA preparation,
cluster formation, primer hybridization and DNA amplification reactions were according to the manufacturer’s
recommended protocol [64]. DNA sequencing was performed using 75-bp paired-end reads of randomly
sheared 200-bp fragments in a single flow cell. Data
were pre-filtered in Illumina’s Pipeline v.1.4 and IPAR
v.1.3. Reads failing a ‘chastity’ filter of 0.6 were discarded. The steps described below for genome scaffold
assembly, annotation and analysis were performed on
the iVEC advanced computing facilities [65].
Paired-end scaffold assemblies

Single (split pairs) and paired-end reads were assembled
using ABySS v.1.0.14 [17]. In addition to the read filtering described above, ABySS removes reads containing
ambiguous characters (Ns). The optimal sequence kmer
(overlap) length was determined by incrementally
adjusting the kmer length by 4 bp and graphing the

Page 11 of 14

number of contigs against L50 for a given kmer length.
The optimal kmer length occurred where N50 was minimal and L50 was largest as visualized by R [66]. N50 is a
weighted median statistic such that 50% of the entire
assembly is contained in the number of contigs or scaffolds equal to or greater than this value, while L50 is the
length of the scaffold that separates the half of the
assembled genome from the remainder of smaller scaffolds, if the sequences are ordered by size.
Annotation and analysis

Protein coding sequences were identified with GeneMarkES v.2 [67]. GeneMark uses a self-training algorithm optimized for features of fungal gene organization by incorporating an enhanced intron submodel to accommodate
sequences with and without branch point sites. GeneMark
compares favorably with the accuracy of gene finders that
employ supervised training based on cDNA sequences.
Annotation of predicted proteins was conducted with
the following tools. A mirror of the NCBI database at
iVEC, together with publicly available fungal protein
sequence files not present at NCBI, was interrogated by
BLASTP [18]. Blast2GO v.2.4.2 [35,36], which incorporates GO, KEGG maps, InterPro and Enzyme Codes was
used with default parameters for functional annotation.
De novo annotation of PFAM domains was performed
using HMMER v.2.3.2 [68]. HMMER searches for
homologues of protein sequences and implements methods using probabilistic models called ‘profile hidden
Markov models’. To detect orthologous genes, we used
OrthoMCL [25] by BLAST to the NCBI non-redundant
database with an e-value cutoff of ≤10-5. OrthoMCL is a
genome-scale algorithm for grouping protein sequences
between species based on BLAST similarity that was
used to identify species-specific expanded gene families.
Subcellular localization of proteins and secretion signals
were identified with Wolf PSort [33] and SignalP v.3.0
[34] using default parameters and selection of the
appropriate organism type.
Genome assembly validation
Assembly comparison with Sanger-sequenced BACs

To validate the assembly over a larger scale, BLASTN
[18] was used to compare the assembly against two
NFNB 0-1 BACs, designated 8F17 and 1H13, sequenced
and assembled by The Genome Center (Washington
University, St Louis, MO, USA). The data were visualized with CIRCOS [69]. To establish if all regions of
the BACs were covered by Solexa sequencing, raw reads
were mapped to the BACs with the Burrows-Wheeler
Aligner [70] and visualized using R and the ggplot2
package [66,71].
SSR primer design and PCR amplification

Short tandem repeats or SSRs (also known as microsatellites) were identified by scanning the genome

Ellwood et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R109
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/11/R109

assembly with Tandem Repeat Finder v.4 [72] for a minimum of ten tandem repeats from 2 to 7 bp. Primers were
designed using Primer3 [73] using parameters designed to
minimize secondary structures, with a GC content >40%,
and an optimum melting temperature of 58 to 60°C, for
amplicons in a size range of 150 to 400 bp. The primers
were assayed using single-spored P. teres isolates collected
from different sites in Western Australia. DNA extraction
and PCR amplification using the Multiplex Ready Technique were performed as described previously [74,75]. Allele
sizing was performed using GeneMapper v.3.7 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

[81]. The genetic map was drawn with the software program MapChart v.2.1 [82].

EST library preparation, sequencing, and assembly
comparison

Total RNA was extracted from isolate 0-1 using fungal
mycelium tissue grown in liquid Fries medium for 4
days. The RNA was extracted with TRIZOL (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. EST library construction and sequencing
was conducted by The Genome Center. To investigate
the presence of ESTs in the assembly and the efficiency
of GeneMark predictions, unique EST sequences were
BLASTN searched against the assembly. BLASTN hits
were then compared against the location of GeneMark
predicted coding regions with BEDtools [76].
Marker development and genetic linkage map
construction

Lai et al. [63] used a subset of AFLPs to identify markers
associated with fungal avirulence on the barley lines ‘Harbin’ and ‘Prato’ on two linkage groups. That study used a
segregating population of 78 progeny from a cross
between NFNB isolates 15A and 0-1. The AFLP markers
were generated based on the technique of Vos et al. [77]
and employed 96 primer combinations containing EcoRI
and MseI restriction sites. In this study, all available AFLPs
from the 96 primer combinations were used to develop a
comprehensive genetic map (Additional file 6). In addition,
we incorporated polymorphic STMSs developed from
microsatellite libraries by Keiper et al. [38], together with
SSRs from EST sequences and the genome assembly
herein. SSR PCR amplification and population genotyping
were performed as described previously [38,78,79]. In
addition, the mating type locus was assayed using primers
Pt5 and Pt7 that amplify the P. teres HMG box [80].
Linkage map construction was performed with MAPMAKER v.2.0 for Macintosh as described by Liu et al.
[78]. A minimum LOD value of 5.0 and a maximum θ =
0.3 were used to establish the linkage groups. For each
linkage group, the most plausible order of markers was
determined using commands ‘FIRST ORDER’ and ‘RIPPLE’, and markers with low confidence (LOD <3.0 for
RIPPLE) were excluded from the map. All markers were
tested for fitness of a 1:1 segregation ratio using Qgene
