Abstract
Background: Members of the Runx family of transcriptional regulators, which bind DNA as
heterodimers with CBFβ, are known to play critical roles in embryonic development in many
triploblastic animals such as mammals and insects. They are known to regulate basic developmental
processes such as cell fate determination and cellular potency in multiple stem-cell types, including
the sensory nerve cell progenitors of ganglia in mammals.
Results: In this study, we detect and characterize the hitherto unexplored Runx/CBFβ genes of
cnidarians and sponges, two basal animal lineages that are well known for their extensive
regenerative capacity. Comparative structural modeling indicates that the Runx-CBFβ-DNA
complex from most cnidarians and sponges is highly similar to that found in humans, with changes
in the residues involved in Runx-CBFβ dimerization in either of the proteins mirrored by
compensatory changes in the binding partner. In situ hybridization studies reveal that Nematostella
Runx and CBFβ are expressed predominantly in small isolated foci at the base of the ectoderm of
the tentacles in adult animals, possibly representing neurons or their progenitors.
Conclusion: These results reveal that Runx and CBFβ likely functioned together to regulate
transcription in the common ancestor of all metazoans, and the structure of the Runx-CBFβ-DNA
complex has remained extremely conserved since the human-sponge divergence. The expression
data suggest a hypothesis that these genes may have played a role in nerve cell differentiation or
maintenance in the common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians.

Background
Developmental processes occur throughout an animal's
entire life history, during both pre-adult and adult stages.
Just as patterning and morphogenesis are required to
sculpt the body during embryogenesis and larval development, similar cellular differentiation pathways must be
continuously re-deployed in the adult to compensate for
the turnover of differentiated cells, to generate contextspecific specialized cell types, and to repair damaged tissues. For example, in adult mammals, cellular differentiation pathways are activated to replace various cells of the
hematopoietic lineage [1], to differentiate ova [2], to
develop mature hair follicles [3], and to heal wounds [4].
Many such "adult developmental" processes are thought
to depend upon stem cells exhibiting varying degrees of
developmental potency [5]. Additionally, the same developmental processes may occur in those adult animals that
are capable of extensively regenerating missing body parts
[6].
One family of genes known to be involved in both preadult and adult development is the Runx family of transcription factors. Runx proteins are important for myriad
developmental processes in both protostomes (e.g., Drosophila and Caenorhabditis) and deuterostomes (e.g., vertebrates and echinoderms) (reviewed in [7,8]). The Runx
protein in a basal deuterostome, the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus was found to be involved in basic
developmental processes in the embryo and larva such as
control of cell differentiation and survival [9-11], while an
isoform of one of the zebrafish Runx genes products,
Runx2b was recently found be a maternal factor acting as
a ventral determining regulator in the earliest stages of
axis formation in the embryo, further illustrating the
importance of these factors in multiple aspects and phases
of animal development [12]. Importantly, Runx factors
have been also widely shown to play particularly key roles
in cell fate determination and the maintenance of stem
cell populations [13-15].
Some metazoans, including C. elegans and the sea urchin,
have a single Runt-like gene, while others, including Drosophila and Fugu, may harbor up to four genes [7,8]. Mammalian genomes contain three Runx genes, each of which
is critical for several different developmental processes
occurring during embryogenesis: Runx1 is important for
hematopoiesis and neurogenesis of distinct CNS neurons
and nociceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglion
(DRG) [16-18], Runx2 is critical for skeletal morphogenesis [19-23], and Runx3 is important for neurogenesis of
proprioceptive neurons in the DRG and for hematopoiesis [24,25]. Mammalian Runx proteins are also important
for recurring developmental processes in the adult. For
instance, loss of Runx1 in the adult causes hematopoietic
abnormalities [26]. Overexpression of Runx2 in adults

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/228

increases bone turnover leading to multiple fractures [27].
Runx3 controls CD8 cells, dendritic cells and CD4 Th1
cells development in adult stages [28].
Runx genes regulate transcription of target genes by binding to a variant of the consensus binding site RCCRCA (R
= purine). Cis-regulatory Runx binding sites have been
found in proximal promoter regions, as distant as a few
thousand base pairs from the start methionine, in introns,
and even within the coding region of genes whose transcription they regulate [29-31]. Runx binding is mediated
by a highly conserved DNA-binding domain termed the
Runt domain (RD) (reviewed in [8]). While the RD can
bind DNA independently, in vivo binding usually occurs
with its heterodimeric binding partner CBFβ. The protein
CBFβ lacks a DNA-binding domain, but when bound to
Runx, it increases the DNA-binding affinity of the RD several fold, substantially enhancing its transcriptional activity (reviewed in [32]). All presently known Runx proteins
terminate in a short conserved pentapeptide motif,
VWRPY, which binds the co-repressor Groucho and
allows them to act as transcriptional repressors under certain conditions [33]. A post-translational control mechanism for mammalian Runx DNA-binding activity occurs
via two cysteine 'redox switch' residues [34,35]. Interestingly, due to their ability to either activate or suppress target genes [36], when Runx genes are mutated or their
regulation is perturbed, they can act as either tumor suppressors or tumor inducers.
While Runx has been intensively studied in some triploblastic animals, little is known about its presence and function in the more ancient "basal" animal lineages such as
cnidarians and sponges. These lineages are critical to
understanding the early functional evolution of Runx
because they diverged from the main metazoan stem lineage prior to the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes (Figure 1). Over 99% of all extant animal species
belong to the Triploblastica (or the Bilateria), including
deuterostomes (e.g., vertebrates and sea urchins) and protostomes (e.g., insects and nematodes). Additionally,
basal animals may be particularly informative about the
evolution of developmental genes required during preadult and adult stages because they exhibit much greater
regenerative capacity than many triploblastic model systems. For example, both sponges and cnidarians are able
to completely regenerate from very small body fragments,
and even from aggregates of single cells [37,38]. In cnidarians, this extensive regenerative capacity extends to the
nervous system, which is able to regenerate in its entirety
after injury. It is experimentally possible to eliminate the
entire cnidarian nervous system, obtaining viable epithelial animals which regenerate a complete and functional
nerve network when repopulated with interstitial stem
cells [39,40]. During the regeneration process in hydra,

pluripotent interstitial stem cells differentiate to form new
nerve cells, gland cells and stinging neurons (nematocytes). In addition, the differentiated cells at the regenerating region undergo de-differentiation to form epithelial
stem cells, which then re-differentiate to complete the
regeneration process [41]. Sponges have only four cell
types, and one of these cell types, the archaeocyte, is a
stem-cell lineage that gives rise to the three other differentiated cell types [42,43]. Thus, cnidarians and sponges are
excellent model organisms to study how developmental
potency can be maintained in both stem cells and differentiated cells, and how de-differentiation and differentiation processes are initiated and controlled during de-novo
creation of form upon regeneration.
In an effort to illuminate the early evolution of Runx and
CBFβ genes and explore a possible ancestral connection
with stem-cell potency and regeneration, we used computational methods to identify Runx and CBFβ orthologs
from basal animals and then subjected them to phyloge-

netic analyses, comparative structural modeling, and
expression studies. In the course of this work we identified
Runx and CBFβ genes in cnidarians and sponges, revealing
that these genes existed in the ancestral metazoan, an
organism which lived perhaps as much as ~300 million
years before the previously known earliest Runx and CBFβ
genes from the bilaterian ancestor (Figure 1). The
sequence of the Runt domain is highly conserved between
sponges (Amphimedon queenslandica and Oscarella carmela), cnidarians (the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis,
the freshwater hydra, Hydra magnipapillata, and the staghorn coral, Acropora millepora), and triploblastic animals.
Likewise, the heterodimeric Runx/CBFβ transcription factor complex and its mode of DNA-binding appear to be
highly conserved between sponges, cnidarians, and
humans. In situ hybridization studies in adult Nematostella
reveal expression in isolated cells of the tentacles, which
may represent sensory neurons or their pluripotent progenitors. This possibility is intriguing because Runx fac-

tors are required for the development of sensory neurons
in mammals [44-47]

Results

Novel Runx and CBFβ genes in basal metazoans
To detect Runx and CBFβ genes in phylogenetically basal
organisms, we used bioinformatic approaches to search
EST and genomic databases for Runx and CBFβ in basal
metazoans and unicellular protozoans. This search
revealed well-conserved Runx and CBFβ gene pairs in the
sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, the freshwater hydra
Hydra magnipapillata, and the marine demosponge
Amphimedon queenslandica. We also identified a Runx gene
in the freshwater demosponge Oscarella carmela and a
CBFβ gene in the coral Acropora millepora. Neither Runx
nor CBFβ were detected in the genomes of any unicellular
protozoans (Table 1).
Runx
The Nematostella Runx gene (Nv-Runx) encodes a predicted protein 496 amino acids long. It contains four
exons, the first two of which encode the highly conserved
Runt domain (RD). Within this domain, the Nematostella
sequence is 81% identical and 93% similar to human
RUNX1 (Figure 2A, B). The third and fourth exons encoding the C-terminus of the protein do not exhibit sequence
similarity to other Runx proteins, nor to any other protein
housed in the NCBI GenBank non-redundant database
[48]. Nevertheless, as in other Runx proteins, the Nv-Runx
C-terminal region, residues 148–495, is enriched in proline (13%), serine (9%) and threonine (8%) residues. The
anemone protein ends with the canonical C-terminal
VWRPY Groucho binding motif [33]. A characteristic
intron at nucleotide position 328 within the RD, conserved amongst protostomes and deuterostomes [7], is
also conserved in Nv-Runx. The second RD exon of Nematostella is identical in size to the corresponding exon in all

deuterostome Runx genes (105 bp) that have been
described. The closest similarity in gene structure is for the
echinoderm Runx where the N-terminal part of the RD is
encoded by a single exon while in other deuterostomes it
spans two exons [7].
The Hydra magnipapillata Runx gene (Hm-Runx) encodes a
shorter protein, 418 amino acids in length. The RD of
Hm-Runx is also highly conserved with human Runx1
(82% identical and 92% similar). Hm-Runx also terminates in the Groucho binding motif VWRPY, but the
remainder of this C-terminal region bears no obvious
homology to any protein housed in GenBank. It is
enriched in serine residues (14.8%), but interestingly,
unlike the sea anemone protein, it is not enriched in proline (5.4%) or threonine (2.7%). The gene structure of
Hm-Runx is similar to that of Nv-Runx and may thus reflect
the ancestral condition for cnidarian Runx genes.
We found partial Runx transcripts from the freshwater
demosponge Oscarella carmela (Oc-Runx) and the marine
demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica (Aq-Runx) that
encode well-conserved RDs. Oc-Runx and Aq-Runx share
~61% and 69% of residues with human RUNX1 in the
128 amino acid RD, respectively (Figure 2 and Additional
file 1). The incomplete ESTs we identified do not encode
the complete carboxy-terminus of the proteins, thus we
cannot tell whether these sponge proteins also contain the
Groucho-binding motif at their C-termini. However, all of
the Runx proteins we have identified contain the two
cysteine residues that act as redox switches in mammals
(Figure 2, [34]). Notably, the second of these two cysteine
residues (aligned residue 32 in Additional file 1) functions as a redox switch in deuterostomes but not in protostomes (being replaced by a serine residue in the latter).
This position is a cysteine in both cnidarians and in one
of the two sponge sequences (A. queenslandica), while

being a valine in the freshwater sponge (Oscarella carmela).
CBFβ
A search of the NCBI EST database revealed three cnidarian CBFβ ESTs – one from Nematostella (Nv-CBFβ), one
from Hydra magnipapillata (Hm-CBFβ) and one from a
pre-settlement stage of the coral Acropora millepora (AmCBFβ). The cnidarian ESTs encode proteins that are highly
conserved relative to their bilaterian counterparts, e.g., the
Nematostella protein is 59% identical and 79% similar to
the human CBFβ isoform 2 (Figure 2D, Additional file 2).
The anemone and coral sequences are very similar to each
other (74% identity and 93% similarity), whereas the
Hydra protein is markedly more distant (58% identical
and 80% similar to both the Nematostella and A. millepora
variants). This reflects the ancient divergence of the medusozoan lineage, which includes Hydra, from the anthozoan lineage, which includes corals and sea anemones
(Figure 1, [49,50]). A putative CBFβ protein identified in
the genomic traces of the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica (Aq-CBFβ) bears almost as much similarity to human
CBFβ as do cnidarian CBFβ proteins (54% identity, 73%
similarity). Interestingly, Aq-CBFβ shares less identity
with the 3 cnidarian CBFβ proteins (~47%) than it does
with the human variant (54%). The sequence predicted
based upon Blast homology includes exons from 2
genomic traces which cannot be directly assembled (Table
1).

The gene structure of CBFβ also appears to be highly conserved between cnidarians and deuterostome bilaterians.
The Nematostella CBFβ (Nv-CBFβ) locus comprises six
exons, and the positions of the first four exon boundaries
are conserved relative to the CBFβ of the purple sea
urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [11] (Figure 2C). The
sixth exon is unique to Nematostella and encodes only the
three final amino acid residues at the C-terminus of the
protein, the stop codon, and the 3' UTR. The entire CBFβ
transcript is encoded by a single exon gene in protostomes, suggesting that a retrotransposition event may
have occurred deep within the protostome lineage.
Cnidarian and Sponge Runx and CBFβ possess the
structural elements needed for heterodimerization and
DNA binding
In triploblastic animals, Runx and CBFβ proteins are
known to cooperate in the regulation of gene expression
by binding DNA as heterodimers (see [51] and references
therein). To test whether the cnidarian and sponge variants of these proteins possess the structural determinants
necessary for them to interact and bind DNA together in a
manner homologous to the human complex, we modeled
their three dimensional structure using the human
AML1(RUNX1)RD-CBFβ-DNA complex as a modeling

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/228

template (see Methods). Unless noted otherwise, all residue numbers described in the text below correspond to
the human RUNX1 and CBFβ proteins (see Additional
files 3, 4, 5 for a detailed comparison of the amino acids
and their positions in the cnidarian and sponge proteins).
Figure 3A shows a general view of the model of the Nematostella RD-CBFβ dimer in complex with DNA, with the
functional residues involved in RD-CBFβ dimerization
and DNA binding highlighted as ball-and-stick models.
The RD contains two distinct functional surfaces – one
involved in DNA binding (composed of 10 functional residues) and one mediating dimerization with CBFβ. CBFβ
itself does not directly interact with the DNA double helix.
Strikingly, all 10 residues of the DNA binding face of all of
the cnidarian and sponge RD's are completely conserved
with their human counterpart, strongly indicating that
these proteins bind DNA in a similar manner (Figure 3A,
Additional file 3 and 6) and prefer the same DNA
sequence motif.
In three of the four organisms – Nematostella, Hydra and
Amphimedon – the dimerization faces of Runx and CBFβ
are conserved, and when amino acid residues differ from
those of the human proteins these differences do not alter
the general structure of the protein complex (Figure 3C–E,
G–I, Additional files 4, 5). This can best be demonstrated
with a more detailed analysis of the Nematostella RunxCBFβ-DNA complex: in Nv-Runx, 13 of the 19 residues on
the CBFβ binding face are conserved, including all P and
G residues that may be important for the folding of the
polypeptide chain (Figure 3C, Additional file 4). Four
additional residues (M106, Y113, S114 and T147) are
replaced by amino acids with similar physical-chemical
characteristics, and only two residues (F153 and H163)
are significantly different. The latter two residues are
found in the outer rim of the interface where protein-protein contacts are generally less conserved. Similarly, 12 of
the 18 residues involved in Runx binding by the human
CBFβ are identical in Nv-CBFβ. Four additional residues
have conserved physical-chemical characteristics (F17,
T60, S65 and M101), and 2 residues (Q67 and P100) are
significantly different (Figure 3G, Additional file 5).
It is noteworthy that the latter residues, while different,
are well accommodated within the structure of the proteins: F153 of human Runx, which is in a hydrophobic
environment (L102, T104, T121, T151), is replaced by K
in Nv-Runx, whose side chain is capable of making most
of the interactions with the hydrophobic environment.
The positively charged end of this K makes an H-bond
with the S that replaces T104. H163 in human Runx1
makes an exposed interaction (and therefore of small
energetic contribution) with D66; it is replaced by C in
Nv-Runx, which cannot form such an interaction but can

Evolutionary conservation of the functional residues of Runx(RD) and CBFβ involved in DNA binding and dimerization
Figure 3
Evolutionary conservation of the functional residues of Runx(RD) and CBFβ involved in DNA binding and
dimerization. The three dimensional structures of the cnidarian and sponge proteins were modeled according to the published structure of their human counterparts (PDB #1H9D). The RD is depicted in blue, CBFβ in green and DNA in purple.
The interacting residues are depicted as ball and stick models, and colored according to their conservation with their human
counterparts (Yellow = identical, Orange = conservative substitution, Red = non-conservative substitution). For clarity, a similar model with the relevant residues numbered according to the Nematostella Runx RD and CBFβ proteins is provided as Additional file 8, and detailed tables comparing the residues of all the proteins discussed can be found as Additional files 3, 4, 5. A)
A General view of the Nematostella RD-CBFβ-DNA complex. All of the residues in the RD involved in DNA binding
are completely conserved in Nematostella. The arrow points to compensatory changes in H163 of the RD, which is replaced
with C131 in Nematostella. B) A rotation of Panel A by 180°, showing a second compensatory change which involves the
substitution of F153 and M106 in human with K121 and A73 in Nematostella in the RD and the replacement of Q67 and S65
with H67 and T65 in CBFβ (indicated with arrow). C-F) The CBFβ-binding faces of the RD from Nematostella (C),
Hydra (D), Amphimedon queenslandica (E) and Oscarella carmella (F). In the cnidarian proteins, the majority of nonconserved residues which interact with CBFβ are located at the periphery of the interacting surfaces (C, D). A. queenslandica
and particularly O. carmella indicate greater sequence divergence within this domain, with non-conservative substituions not
being restricted to the periphery. G-I) the Runx-binding surfaces of CBFβ proteins from Nematostella (G), Hydra

interact with the nearby backbone carbonyl. P100 of
human CBFβ, which makes hydrophobic contacts with
Y85 and I109, is replaced by H in Nv-CBFβ. This residue
can form a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of
F69. Q67 of human CBFβ is solvent exposed in the separated molecule: it is replaced by H in Nematostella without
losing or gaining particular contacts.
Interestingly, while not all of the residues in the RD-CBFβ
interface are conserved between Nematostella and
humans, a change in the residue of one protein is accompanied by a reciprocal change in its binding partner (Figure 3B). One such change involves residues F153 and
M106 in human Runx1 RD, which interface with S65 and
Q67 of CBFβ. Nematostella differs at both positions in its
RD, where F153 and M106 are replaced by K121 and A73
in the Nematostella protein; these changes in the Runx protein are mirrored by changes in CBFβ, where S65 and Q67
are replaced by T65 and H67 (Figure 3E). Another reciprocal change involves H163 of human Runx1 RD, which
interfaces with T62 and F17 in CBFβ; the corresponding
residues in Nematostella are C131 (in RD) and S62 and
M17 (in CBFβ), respectively. This suggests that while the
specific residues may differ between taxa, these proteins
have co-evolved to maintain their functional interaction.
In contrast to the Runx proteins from the cnidarians and
the demosponge Amphimedon, the CBFβ binding face of
the sponge Oscarella carmela Runx protein is quite distinct,
with many non-conservative amino acid substitutions
found both in the periphery and in the center of the CBFβ
binding region (Figure 3F). This suggests either that the
corresponding CBFβ protein in this sponge is considerably different, or that the Oc-Runx does not bind a CBFβ
protein at all.
Phylogenetic history of Runx and CBFβ
Runx and CBFβ genes have previously been reported in
many different phyla of triploblastic animals where a single species may contain multiple Runx or CBFβ genes. The
detection of Runx and CBFβ genes in cnidarians and
sponges allows, for the first time, reconstruction of their
early evolutionary history, in the period preceding the
evolutionary origin of Triploblasts.

Figure 4A depicts a phylogeny of Runx proteins from
sponges, cnidarians, chordates, echinoderms, and arthropods. Sequences from the nematodes C. elegans, C. brigsae,
and D. coronatus were excluded from this analysis as they
are highly divergent from the other metazoan Runx proteins, and their inclusion would tend to cause longbranch attraction artifacts. An analysis including the nematode species is presented in Additional file 6 (see Additional file 9 for taxon IDs). The tree is rooted using the two
sponge sequences. Consistent with the prevailing view of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/228

organismal phylogeny, this gene tree groups the two
sponge sequences, the eighteen triploblast sequences, the
six chordate sequences, the two urchin sequences, and the
ten arthropod sequences into mutually exclusive clades,
with each clade receiving bootstrap support > 75%. The
Runx sequences do not recover a monophyletic Deuterostomia as the two sea urchin sequences (Strongylocentrotus
and Heliocidaris) group more closely with insects than
with chordates (although the bootstrap support for this
grouping is relatively low). Neither does the Runx tree
support cnidarian monophyly, as the sea anemone and
hydra sequences appear as successive outgroups at the
base of the triploblast clade. Interestingly, this tree implies
that the cnidarian proteins have evolved relatively slowly.
In particular, the sea anemone Runx appears to have
undergone the least amount of evolutionary change of
any taxon since the time of the sponge-triploblast ancestor. The anemone may therefore represent our best source
of information regarding the ancestral Runx protein. As
the human Runx paralogs (Runx1–3) and the insect Runx
paralogs (e.g., Drosophila Lozenge, Runt, RuntA, and
RuntB) fall into distinct and well supported clades, this
tree implies that the ancestral Runx gene underwent independent gene duplication in the deuterostome and protostome lineages.
Figure 4B depicts a phylogeny of CBFβ proteins that is
rooted using the single sequence from the sponge
Amphimedon. Once again, the nematode sequences were
found to be highly divergent from other metazoan CBFβ
proteins, and they were excluded from this analysis. A tree
containing these sequences is presented as Additional file
7 (see Additional file 10 for taxon IDs). Like the Runx tree,
this gene tree recovers the monophyly of a number of
accepted taxonomic groups. It groups the three cnidarian
sequences, the two sea urchin sequences, the five insect
sequences, the two ascidian sequences and the eight vertebrate sequences. Furthermore, the vertebrate clade is subdivided among three well established monophyletic taxa:
the two jawless fishes (Eptatretus and Petromyzon), the two
ray-finned fishes (Danio and Oryzias), and the four tetrapods (Xenopus, Gallus, Mus, and Homo). Once again, as in
the Runx tree, the sea urchin sequences (Strongylocentrotus
and Paracentrotus) do not group with other deuterostome
sequences or even with the other echinoderm sequence in
the analysis, the sea star Asterina. The tree is not consistent
with triploblast monophyly because the cnidarian
sequences fall within a cluster of deuterostome sequences.
In addition to the apparent reciprocity of amino acid
changes that we have observed in the interacting portions
of Runx and CBFβ, the anomalous position of the sea
urchin sequences on both the Runx and CBFβ trees could
be another reflection of co-evolution between these proteins. To explore this hypothesis further, we employed a

Phylogeny of Runx (A) and CBFβ (B) proteins
Phylogeny of Runx (A) and CBFβ (B) proteins. In both cases, maximum likelihood trees were constructed using the program PhyML. In the case of Runx, likelihoods were calculated using the Rt-REV amino acid substitution matrix [83]. In the case
of CBFβ, likelihoods were calculated using the JTT amino acid substitution matrix. Separate neighbor-joining analyses using the
JTT distance matrix were also performed for each data set (not shown). The bars and icons indicate the locations of the taxonomic groupings on each tree with the deuterostome and protostome groups marked with filled and empty circles respectively. Both trees are rooted between the sponge sequences and the eumetazoan sequences. The length of each horizontal
branch is proportional to the number of amino acid substitutions that have occurred along that branch (scale at lower part of
each panel). The first and second numbers at each node indicate the percentage of 1,000 bootstrap replicates in which the
given clade is recovered with maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining analyses, respectively. Nodes which failed to receive at
least 40% bootstrap support in one of the analyses are not labeled. The sources of the sequences and the abbreviations for

variation on the protein co-evolution test proposed by
Sato and coworkers [52] (Figure 5). When each of the phylogenies described above is limited to only those 11 taxa
contained in both phylogenies, and the tree topologies are
constrained to the accepted organismal phylogeny (Figure. 5A), the resultant branch lengths on the two trees are
significantly and strongly correlated (Figure 5B, R2 = 0.83;
Linear Least Regression test for significance: F1,17 = 85.11,
p < 0.0001). In contrast, the branch lengths from a glyceraldehyde-phosphate-dehydrogenase phylogeny, which is
a "house-keeping" gene serving as a control, are not correlated with the Runx branch lengths (F1,17 = 2.73, p =
0.1167) and only weakly correlated with the branch

lengths from the CBFβ phylogeny (F1,17 = 9.31, p = 0.0072,
R2= 0.35).
Runx and CBFβ are expressed in overlapping, but not
identical, regions of the Nematostella head and tentacle
ectoderm
To determine if expression of Nv-Runx and Nv-CBFβ is
spatially restricted along the primary body axis of the
adult polyp we performed reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on equal amounts of total
RNA isolated from four different body regions: (1) tentacles, (2) head region, (3) body column, and (4) physal
region. Using two different primer pairs, Runx expression
was detected in the tentacles and head/pharyngeal region

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:228

but not the body column or physa (Figure 6). High levels
of CBFβ expression were observed in the tentacles and
head/pharyngeal regions; although a lower level of CBFβ
expression could also be detected in the body column. No
CBFβ expression was observed in the physal region.
We next used whole mount in-situ hybridization, followed
by cryosectioning, to characterize the spatial expression of
Runx and CBFβ. In agreement with the RT-PCR results, NvRunx was expressed mainly in the tentacles, with the
strongest expression seen in the tentacle tips (Figure 7A).
We found that the expression is limited to small foci
found exclusively in the ectoderm, often in tight association with nematocytes (Figure 7G). Sporadic Runxexpressing cells were also seen in the outer body wall in
the pharyngeal region (Figure 7I). The same general pattern of Runx expression was observed in ten different
anemones using two different anti-sense RNA probes – a
450 nucleotide probe corresponding to exons 1–3 of the
gene (containing the Runt domain; Figure 2A) as well as a
1.5 kb probe corresponding to the entire ORF (data not
shown). No staining was observed with the complementary negative control sense-strand RNA probes (Figure
7A). While the general pattern of expression was similar in
all of the individual anemones, possible differences in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/228

relative level of expression were observed between different animals within the same experiment (compare Figure
7, panels B and C).
Similar to Runx, CBFβ is expressed in the tentacle ectoderm, with the strongest staining in the tentacle tips (Figure 8, panels A-C). Also like Runx, the CBFβ-expressing
cells are located primarily in the basal layer of the ectoderm and in close association with large microbasic mastigophore nematocytes, which are a major component of
this cell-rich region of the animal (Figure 8. panels F-H).
However, in contrast to Runx, some of the individual animals assayed also expressed CBFβ in the mouth region
(Figure 8, panels D, G, and H).

Discussion

Runx and CBFβ Evolution
A primary motivation for performing the phylogenetic
analysis was to decipher the relationships among the multiple paralogs that are found in some taxa, and to pinpoint
the ancestral lineages in which gene duplications must
have occurred in the Runx and/or CBFβ genes. The presence of only a single Runx locus in Porifera and Cnidaria,
two of the most ancient animal phyla, along with the fact
that both the maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-

Co-evolution of Runx and CBFβ proteins
Co-evolution of Runx and CBFβ proteins. A) We generated the accepted organismal phylogeny relating 11 taxa for
which both Runx and CBFβ sequences are available. We then inferred the evolutionary change in Runx (blue) and CBFβ
(green) along each branch of this phylogeny by using the JTT matrix to calculate patristic distances. B) For each node on the
tree, the evolutionary change in CBFβ and GAPDH were plotted against the evolutionary change in Runx. The regression
reveals a significant and strong correlation between the evolutionary change in Runx and CBFβ (represented by squares and
solid line; R2 = 0.83, F1,17 = 85.11, p < 0.0001) but not between Runx and GAPDH (circles and dashed line). The outliers (the
circle and square with a Runx branch length of ~0.3) represent the divergence between the protostome ancestor and the common Caenorhabditis ancestor (see panel A). Both Runx (branch length = ~0.3) and CBFβ (branch length = ~0.44) diverged rapidly within this lineage, while GAPDH continued to evolve more slowly (equivalent branch length in GAPDH tree = ~0.05).

Reverse-transcription (RT) PCR was performed on an equal amount of total RNA extracted from each of the

physa. As a positive control, actin was found to be expressed at high levels in all four body regions.

joining (NJ) trees can be rooted such that the sponge and
cnidarian sequences emerge from the base of the tree, supports the hypothesis that the eumetazoan ancestor possessed only a single Runx locus. Subsequently, it appears
that this ancestral Runx gene underwent independent
duplications within arthropods and within vertebrates.
While the non-insect arthropods are only known to possess single Runx genes, and the Runt1 sequences from spider (Cupennius), mite (Tetranychus), and crayfish
(Pacifastacus) cluster together, distinct Runt, RunxA, and
Lozenge genes are found in both Anopholes and Drosophila.
Drosophila also possesses a fourth Runx paralog, RuntB.
This requires at least three gene duplications among dip-

teran insects, with at least two of these gene duplications
clearly predating the divergence between fruit fly and
mosquito. While only single Runx proteins are known
from the non-vertebrate chordates (Branchiostoma floridae,
B. lanceolatum, and Ciona), there are three human paralogs
(Runx 1–3), which cluster together on the tree. This is not
surprising given that two rounds of whole genome duplication are known to have occurred early in vertebrate evolution, prior to the divergence of the ray-finned fishes
from the lobe-finned fishes. The genomes of pufferfishes
(Fugu and Tetraodon), which are ray-finned fishes, contain
four Runx genes [53,54], three of which appear as
orthologs of the mammalian Runx1–3. The additional

corresponding to nucleotides 100–539 of the ORF (exons 1–3, which contain the Runt domain) were used to characterize the
spatial expression of Runx in adult Nematostella. Similar results were obtained using a longer probe corresponding to the entire

Runx gene has a relatively short coding region; it has been
suggested that it represents an ancestral vertebrate Runx
that was subsequently lost in the tetrapod lineage [53].
Zebrafish also contain four Runx genes, however two of
those are clearly Runx2 orthologs (Runx2a and Runx2b)
that likely arose from partial or whole genome duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage [55,56]. The two
zebrafish Runx2 paralogs have different functions, including the aforementioned role of Runx2b in dorso-ventral
axis formation [12]. Thus, the evolution of this gene family displays dynamic changes in gene number as a result of
gene duplications but also of possible gene loss.
With respect to CBFβ, the presence of only a single known
CBFβ homolog in all taxa except the fruit fly, including
other insects (e.g., Apis and Bombyx) points to a single, rel-

atively recent gene duplication, in the lineage leading to
Drosophila.
On both the Runx and CBFβ trees, two sea urchin
sequences group together with robust bootstrap support
(100%), but fail to group with other deuterostome taxa as
expected. In the case of Runx, the two echinoid sequences
(Strongylocentrotus and Heliocidaris) appear most closely
related to an arthropod clade, although with relatively low
bootstrap support (65%). In the case of CBFβ, the two
echinoid sequences (Strongylocentrotus and Paracentrotus)
fail to group with a fellow echinoderm, the starfish Asterina, instead appearing most closely related to a sequence
from a snail (Biomphalaria). The bootstrap support for this
particular grouping is <40%. The low bootstrap support
indicates that the echinoids are not exhibiting a strong

Page 13 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:228

affinity for protostome sequences so much as they are
exhibiting a lack of affinity for the more closely related
deuterostome sequences. The simplest explanation for
this pattern, which is also supported by echinoid-specific
residues in the sequence alignments (Additional files 1, 2)
is that these proteins have undergone echinoid-specific
sequence changes that obscure their underlying affinity to
other deuterostome sequences.
For both proteins, the amino acid substitution rates differ
between lineages. In particular, both Runx and CBFβ have
diverged rapidly in Drosphila and Caenorhabditis, resulting
in the fruit fly and nematode proteins being less similar to
their human homologs than are the cnidarian proteins,
despite being more closely related to humans by some 50
million years. Drosophila Runx RD's share, on average,
~72% of residues with human Runx proteins (as compared to 81% for Nematostella) while C. elegans and C.
briggsae share, on average, only ~48% residues with
human RD. Likewise, the CBFβ proteins from cnidarians
share 57–59% of the residues with human CBFβ, respectively, whereas Drosphila and C. elegans share only ~55%
and 22%, respectively. These data are consistent with a
number of recent studies that have noted greater genomic
similarity between humans and anthozoan cnidarians
than between humans and the major protostome model
systems [57-59]. It remains to be seen whether the gene
duplication events of both Runx and CBFβ in various lineages are correlated with a diversification of the roles and
regulatory networks in these organisms. Such questions
may be addressed through functional studies of proteins
and computational predictions of regulatory networks.
Runx and CBFβ binding, co-evolution, and co-expression
The majority of the amino acids involved in the binding
of CBFβ to Runx, and the binding of the Runx-CBFβ protein complex to DNA, are highly conserved between
human and Nematostella. Our comparative protein modeling results show a high degree of stabilizing selection
within the Runt domain (RD) and the RD-interacting face
of CBFβ. Further, the complete conservation within the
metazoa of residues necessary for interaction between the
RD and DNA suggests that the RD-CBFβ-DNA complex
has been essentially conserved throughout the ~700 million year history of the eumetazoa, in animals whose morphology, ecology, and physiology are as diverse as
terrestrial vertebrates, aerial arthropods and marine invertebrates. Interestingly, the CBFβ-binding faces of the
sponge proteins are more divergent. Indeed, the Oscarella
Runx represents the longest branch on the Runx phylogeny. This is interesting given that we failed to recover a
CBFβ homolog from this sponge. This higher degree of
sequence divergence within the CBFβ-binding face of O.
carmela Runx combined with the lack of CBFβ expression
in developmentally mixed EST pools could indicate CBFβ

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/228

loss within this demosponge or indicate that this demosponge may deserve a basal position within the metazoan
lineage, pre-dating the origin of CBFβ. Targeted sequencing for CBFβ within genomic sequence of O. carmela may
help resolve this.
Notably, where the Nematostella CBFβ protein differs from
human, there appear to be compensatory changes in the
Nematostella RD. The possibility of compensatory substitutions in the RD and CBFβ proteins of sea anemone and
human suggests that functional constraints require that
directional selection on either protein may promote commensurate divergence in its partner. To test this hypothesis over broad phylogenetic distances, we employed a
variation on the protein co-evolution test proposed by
[52]. Our results indicate a significant and highly predictive relationship between the branch lengths of Runx and
CBFβ phylogenetic trees, providing further support that
the evolutionary rates of these two domains are correlated.
However, shared evolutionary histories could result in significant correlations between any pair of proteins [60].
For example, any two proteins will exhibit a correlation if
they have evolved in clock-like fashion on the same
underlying phylogeny, or if the species from which they
are derived differ substantially in their overall rates of
molecular evolution. To evaluate the contribution of
shared history to the observed correlation, we can compare proteins that do not interact functionally. We
observed no correlation between the molecular evolution
of Runx and GAPDH, a well-conserved 'house-keeping'
gene, and we observed only a weak correlation between
CBFβ and GAPDH (Figure 5B). Taken together with the
reciprocal amino acid changes that have occurred over
deep evolutionary divergences, this strongly suggests that
these two proteins have co-evolved from sponges and cnidarians to humans to maintain their ability to co-regulate
the transcription of target genes.
A role for Runx and CBFβ in nerve cells of adult
Nematostella?
In the adult anemone, Nv-Runx is expressed in scattered
ectodermal cells, mainly in the tentacles, and predominantly in the tentacle tips. Scattered cells in the body wall
ectoderm also express Runx. Similarly, Nv-CBFβ is
expressed most strongly in the ectoderm of the tentacle
tips. However, in contrast to Runx, CBFβ is also expressed
in the mouth and upper portion of the pharynx. Thus, NvRunx and Nv-CBFβ are expressed in similar, but possibly
not completely overlapping regions of the anemone head
and tentacles. Here, as in other systems, including mammals [32] and sea-urchins [11], CBFβ likely functions
together with Runx in the sites where they overlap. At
other sites, where CBFβ is expressed in the absence of

Runx, CBFβ may have other roles, which may involve
other partners [11].
The tentacles of sea anemones, where the expression of
both Runx and CBFβ is most predominant, are the part of
the animal involved in prey capture and manipulation.
This region is relatively poor in cell types, with the majority of differentiated cell types present involved either in
prey capture (nematocytes, spirocytes) or in its detection
(sensory neurons and ganglion cells) (Figure 7H[61]).
The nematocytes themselves do not seem to express either
Runx or CBFβ, nor do the gland/mucous cells, which are
found exclusively in the apical part of the ectoderm (Runx
and CBFβ expression is seen mainly in the mid and basal
parts of the ectoderm). Thus, we speculate that the cells
expressing Runx and CBFβ are probably neuronal cells.
Alternatively, they could be precursors of one of the above
differentiated cell types – most likely of nematocytes and
spirocytes, which are highly enriched in the tentacles,
especially towards the distal tips.
In vertebrates, Runx proteins are known to play critical
roles in neural differentiation. For example, in mice,
Runx1 and Runx3 influence the development and survival
of sensory neurons in several ganglia types such as dorsal
root ganglia [24,25,44,45,47]. In mice, Runx3 is essential
for development of the monosynaptic stretch reflex arc
[24,25,62] the simplest and most ancient neuronal circuit. Based on these findings, it was speculated that a
Runx3 ortholog may play an analogous role in the highly
similar anemone nematocysts response circuit [63]. The
spatial expression of Runx and CBFβ in adult Nematostella
suggests that these proteins might also be involved in neural differentiation.
Taken together, our results suggest a putative role for Runx
in the maintenance of specific neurons in the tentacles of
adult anemones, in addition to the diversity of other networks and functions in which Runx is also likely involved.
In vertebrates, Runx proteins regulate disparate functions
at different developmental stages, in each case by interacting with a different regulatory network [8]. It is noteworthy that an EST encoding the Acropora ortholog of CBFβ
was detected in a library from a pre-settlement planula
larva stage [58]. This suggests that in corals Runx and CBFβ
are expressed during embryonic and larval development.
Future studies involving microarray analysis of gene
expression, CHIP-ChIP analysis of Nv-Runx target genes,
and gene knockdown experiments may help identify the
various roles played by Nv-Runx, Nv-CBFβ, and their regulatory networks at different stages in the life history of
Nematostella.

Conclusion

In this study, we showed that Runx and CBFβ are found in
the most basal metazoans, cnidarians and sponges, and
that in these animals they probably interact and bind
DNA in a manner similar to that found in humans. Structural motifs involved in the regulation of the Runx-CBFβ
pair, such as the Runx C-terminal Groucho binding motif
and the cysteine redox switches, are also conserved, suggesting that other parts of the regulatory network in which
Runx and CBFβ are embedded are also evolutionarily conserved. Both Runx and CBFβ are expressed mainly in small
cells within the ectoderm of the tentacles, the identity of
which still await proof, but may be sensory neurons or
their precursors.

Methods
Maintenance of Anemones
Nematostella vectensis was obtained from the Aquatic
Resources Division of the Marine Biological Laboratory at
Woods Hole, as well as from the stock maintained at the
Finnerty laboratory at Boston University. The anemones
were housed in glass dishes of 50% natural seawater/50%
distilled water and maintained at 20°C as described previously [64]. The anemones were fed three times a week
with freshly hatched nauplii of Artemia salina, and the
water was changed weekly.
Identification of novel Runx/CBFβ proteins
Assembled genomes, genomic trace sequences, and/or
expressed sequence tags from the following animals were
interrogated utilizing a combination of keyword and
sequence homology searches: Phylum Protista, Monosiga
brevicollis and Proterospongia-like sp. ATCC50818; Phylum
Porifera, Oscarella carmela and Amphimedon queenslandica;
and Phylum Cnidaria, (class Anthozoa) Nematostella vectensis and (class Hydrozoa) Hydra magnipapillata. The
genomes of several additional protozoan species were
also searched (Table 1). Monosiga and Proterospongia ESTs
were searched at Choanobase [65,66] using tblastx [67]. A
total of 11178 ESTs for Oscarella carmela were downloaded from NCBI's Genbank database and searched
locally using tblastx, as was a draft assembly of the Hydra
magnipapillata genome (downloaded from the J. Craig
Venter Institute [68]. The Nematostella genome was
searched using keyword and blastp/tblastx searches of the
assembled genome and expressed sequences at the Nematostella vectensis Genomics Database (StellaBase) site
[69,70]. Genomic and coding sequences from other taxa
were searched at NCBI (Table 1).
Phylogenetic reconstruction
We utilized the default alignment parameters (protein distance matrix = GONNET 250; gap open penalty = 10.0;
end gap penalty = -1.0; gap extension penalty = 0.2; gap
distance penalty = 4) in ClustalX [71] to generate multiple

sequence alignments for Runx and CBFβ proteins [7,72],
Additional files 1, 2). Numerous previously unidentified
Runx and CBFβ sequences from diverse taxa were parsed
and assembled from the NCBI dbEST database and from
whole genome shotgun sequences after tblastn searches
(Table 1, [73]. The conserved 128 amino acid Runt
domain [7,72] and 135 CBFβ amino acid residues were
used for phylogenetic inference (Additional files 1 and 2,
respectively).
ProtTest was used to determine which of 80 possible
amino acid substitution models is most appropriate for
each dataset [74]. Both the tree topology and the model of
protein evolution were optimized simultaneously. The
Akaike Information Criteria with a modification to control for small sample size (AICc, with alignment length
representing sample size; [75]) was used to discriminate
among models. Phylogenetic analyses of both Runx and
CBFβ revealed rapid lineage divergence in the nematodes
(C. elegans, C. brigsae, and Diploscapter coronatus), which
suggests that the placement of these taxa could be confounded by long-branch attraction (Additional files 6 and
7, respectively). Because of this, phylogenetic analyses
were performed with and without nematode worms for
both proteins. The best model identified for Runx was
RtREV [76] + γ (ΔAICc = 0). This model was employed in
a maximum-likelihood analysis of Runx sequences using
the program Phyml [77]. Since RtREV is not available in
the Phylip software package (version 3.65), the neighborjoining analysis was performed using the 2nd best model:
JTT [78] + γ (excluding nematodes: ΔAICc = 4.74, including nematodes: ΔAICc = 15.40). For the CBFβ sequences,
JTT + γ was used for both maximum likelihood (Phyml)
and neighbor-joining (Phylip) analyses for both datasets
(e.g., with and without nematodes). The support for individual nodes was assessed using the bootstrap re-sampling method with 1000 replicates [79].
Distance test for Co-evolution
To determine if the Runt domain and the CBFβ protein
are co-evolving, we culled the phylogenetic dataset to
include only those taxa for which both Runt and CBFβ
sequences are available. While constraining the tree topology such that it reflects the accepted evolutionary relationships among the 11 species for which we identified both
proteins [80], we used parsimony (PAUP; Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Massachusetts) to infer the number of
amino acid substitutions that occurred along each branch
for both the Runt domain and CBFβ protein. The branch
lengths for each tree were plotted against each other. The
strength of the correlation between corresponding branch
lengths was evaluated using Pearson product moment
correlations. Each protein was also independently compared to glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) using the same approach. GAPDH is a "house-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/228

keeping gene" that serves as a control, because its
sequence evolution is not expected to be functionally constrained by the evolution of either Runx or CBFβ. Correlations were considered significant if α < 0.05, as assessed
by a linear least squares regression significance test.
Comparative Modeling of Runx1(RD)-DNA and RunxCBFβ interfaces in Sponges and Cnidaria
Model structures of the Runt and CBFβ domains of Nematostella, Hydra, Amphimedon and Oscarella were constructed based on the X-ray structure of the human
AML1(RUNX1)-CBFβ-DNA complex (PDB # 1H9D,
[81]). The Runt domains from the cnidarians and sponges
have a high sequence similarity with the human protein
(see Results, below). The Nematostella sequence has the
same length as the human Runx1 RD sequence whereas
the hydra and sponge sequences are 1- or 2-residues
longer. The inserts map to a loop that is not involved in
either DNA or CBFβ binding. The Nematostella, Hydra,
Amphimedon and human variants of CBFβ are also highly
similar. The major difference between Nematostella and
human CBFβ is the loss of a five amino acid stretch in the
Nematostella sequence (Figure 2D). This deletion maps to
a loop between Pro70 and Thr80 in the human CBFβ
sequence whose structure is not resolved in the experimental structure of RD-CBFβ complex and is not involved
in AML1(RUNX1)-CBFβ-DNA complex formation. This
loop was not modeled. The Hydra protein has one amino
acid deleted in this region, whereas the Amphimedon CBFβ
domain shows a 2-residue insert the same region. The
overall high degree of conservation strongly suggests that
the overall folds of the Runx(RD) and CBFβ domains
studied here are similar to the folds of the corresponding
human domains. Therefore, the Cα atoms were constrained to their initial positions during the energy minimization, except for the modified loop in Runx(RD).
Models were constructed using the 'Homology' module of
InsightII (Accelrys Inc., San Diego CA), soaked in a layer
of water and energy minimized using the 'Discover-3'
module, while employing the CVFF force field.

The likelihood of the RD-CBFβ interaction in Nematostella, Hydra and A. queenslandica was estimated by analyzing the conservation of the interface residues. Additional
files 3, 4, 5 indicate interface residues which are buried
more than 15% at the interface in the human RD-CBFβDNA complex (the 15% limit excludes residues at the
edge of the interface whose contribution to the stability of
the complex may be marginal). The surface area of each
residue which is buried at the interface was estimated as
the difference between its exposed surface area in the separated domain and in complex. Exposed surface areas
were calculated using the Homology module.

RT-PCR and Cloning of Nv-Runx and Nv-CBFβ
transcripts
RNA was isolated from adult Nematostella anemones
using Tri-Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was used to
analyze the expression of Runx and CBFβ transcripts in
different body regions of the anemone. Adult anemones
were first anesthetized by gradually supplementing the
culture medium with 14% w/v MgCl2·6H2O. Transverse
sections were made using a razor blade to divide each animal into four distinct axial regions: (1) tentacles, (2)
head/pharyngeal region (containing tentacle bases), (3)
body column, and (4) physal region. First-strand cDNAs
were synthesized using RevertAid™ H Minus First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Life Sciences, EU). Runx
and CBFβ were amplified from these cDNA pools in a
Mastercycler gradient PCR machine (Eppendorf) using
Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas) under the conditions
specified by the manufacturer. The oligonucleotides used
were: Nv-Runx TCTCCGAATTTTGTGTGCAG and TTCTACTGCGGAATCCATCC of exon 1 and exon 3 respectively; Nv-CBFβ GAAAACTCGCTCGTGAATCC and
AGTCTTTGCTTCGCCTGTTC of exon 1 and exon 5 respectively and actin primers CATGGAATTGTCACAAACTGG
and CACACTTCATGATGGAGTTG that are general for cnidarians. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T-Easy
(Promega), and sequenced at the Hebrew University
Genome Center.
In-situ hybridization
In situ hybridization was performed using the protocol
reported by Martinez and co-workers [82] with several
modifications. Briefly, medium sized adult Nematostella
(3 days after last feeding) were transferred into a small
dish, allowed to relax for about one hour and anesthetized as described above. After about 10 minutes, the
anemones did not respond to tactile stimulation, at which
point they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in
NM for at least four hours at room temperature. The animals were dehydrated through a methanol series, rehydrated into PBST (Phosphate Buffered Saline containing
0.1% Tween-20), and digested for 20 minutes with 0.3 U/
ml Proteinase K (Roche). The digestion was terminated by
incubation in 4% Glycine in PBST for ten minutes. The
animals were then washed twice in PBST, twice in 0.1 M
triethanolamine (pH 7.8) twice in 0. 25% (v/v) acetic
anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine, twice more in PBST,
and then refixed for one hour in 4% PFA in PBST. After
several more washes in PBST, the anemones were washed
once in 50% PBST/50% HS (Hybridization Solution: 50%
formamide, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 × SSC, 0.1% CHAPS, 1×
Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml heparin and 200 μg/ml
tRNA), once in 100% HS, and prehybridized in 100% HS
for at least two hours at 55°C. Hybridization was per-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/228

formed in HS containing 0.05 ng/μl of the appropriate
DIG-labeled probe (produced using the DIG RNA labeling kit, Roche) for 48–72 hours at 55°C. Following
hybridization, the animals were taken through a series of
seven washes, each lasting 1 hour at 55°C (100% HS/
tRNA; 100%, HS/2 × SSC; 75% HS/2 × SSC, 50% HS/2 ×
SSC; 25% HS/2 × SSC; 2 × SSC/1% CHAPS, 2 × SSC/1%
CHAPS). The animals were then transferred to MAB
(Maleic Acid Buffer: 0.1 M Maleic Acid, 0.15 M NaCl, pH
7.5), blocked for at least two hours in blocking solution
(20% Goat Serum, 1% Bovine Serum Albumin, 0.1%
Sodium Azide in MAB) and incubated overnight at 4°C
with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin
antibodies (Roche) that had been preadsorbed to adult
Nematostella. Following incubation with the antibody, the
animals were washed extensively in MAB over a 24-hour
period at room temperature and transferred into NTMT
(0.1 M NaCl, 0.05 M MgCl2 and 0.1% Tween-20 in 0.1 M
Tris-HCl, pH 9.5). Presence of the antibody was detected
using the color substrate NBT-BCIP (Roche). The staining
reaction was terminated by extensive washing with PBST.
Pictures were taken with either an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with an Optronics camera or an Olympus
dissecting microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany)
equipped with an Olympus DP10 CCD camera (Tokyo,
Japan).
Sectioning of animals after whole mount in-situ
hybridization
Following whole-mount in situ hybridization, animals
were washed extensively in PBST, infiltrated with 30%
sucrose in PBST as a cryoprotectant, immersed in TissueTek medium and frozen on dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Tenmicron sections were taken using a Leica CM1850 cryostat
(Wetzlar, Germany). The sections were counterstained in
Eosin and mounted in glycerol without dehydration and
tissue clearing, as this can cause loss of the color precipitate. Micrographs were takes with an Olympus BX51
microscope equipped with an Optronics camera. For the
histological sections of the mouth region, an anemone
was taken after whole mount in-situ hybridization with a
control probe, refixed in 4% PFA in PBST, dehydrated into
isopropanol and embedded in Agar-100 resin. Twomicron sections were taken with an Ultratome-3 (LKBProdikter) and stained with Methylene Blue.
