Abstract
Background: Oceans are high gene flow environments that are traditionally believed to hamper
the build-up of genetic divergence. Despite this, divergence appears to occur occasionally at
surprisingly small scales. The Galápagos archipelago provides an ideal opportunity to examine the
evolutionary processes of local divergence in an isolated marine environment. Galápagos sea lions
(Zalophus wollebaeki) are top predators in this unique setting and have an essentially unlimited
dispersal capacity across the entire species range. In theory, this should oppose any genetic
differentiation.
Results: We find significant ecological, morphological and genetic divergence between the western
colonies and colonies from the central region of the archipelago that are exposed to different
ecological conditions. Stable isotope analyses indicate that western animals use different food
sources than those from the central area. This is likely due to niche partitioning with the second
Galápagos eared seal species, the Galápagos fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) that exclusively
dwells in the west. Stable isotope patterns correlate with significant differences in foraging-related
skull morphology. Analyses of mitochondrial sequences as well as microsatellites reveal signs of
initial genetic differentiation.
Conclusion: Our results suggest a key role of intra- as well as inter-specific niche segregation in
the evolution of genetic structure among populations of a highly mobile species under conditions
of free movement. Given the monophyletic arrival of the sea lions on the archipelago, our study
challenges the view that geographical barriers are strictly needed for the build-up of genetic
divergence. The study further raises the interesting prospect that in social, colonially breeding
mammals additional forces, such as social structure or feeding traditions, might bear on the genetic
partitioning of populations.

Background
The relative role of ecologically mediated divergence in
speciation processes is still under debate [1]. Theory predicts that barriers to gene flow can evolve as a result of
ecologically-based divergent selection and need not necessarily be associated with separation imposed by geographic barriers [2-5]. Recent empirical evidence makes it
increasingly clear that ecological factors can indeed drive
speciation processes [6-9]. Traditionally, top-down phylogenetic analyses, where the relevant divergence processes
are inferred retrospectively long after the putative split has
occurred have often been invoked to address this question. While this is clearly a powerful approach to reveal
evolutionary trajectories, it is by its very nature restricted
to retrospective inferences and can thereby only speculate
about the ecological conditions under which the speciation process was initiated. It is hence necessary to identify
cases where the first steps of divergence appear, even if
one can not definitely know whether it will eventually end
with a true species separation [10-13]. Studying ongoing
differentiation processes in small-scale situations with
unlimited dispersal opportunities is therefore crucial to
investigate the mechanisms driving adaptive divergence.
Marine environments provide excellent study cases, as
they typically allow broad dispersal in mobile taxa and,
compared to terrestrial habitats, offer low travel costs [14].
Still, within geographic ranges of several thousand kilometres genetic isolation by distance is expected and has
been observed even for highly mobile marine predators
[15]. However, it is a challenge to track evolutionary
divergence processes at a smaller spatial scale. The few
that have ventured on this undertaking have produced
interesting results ranging from a role of gamete recognition molecules [16] to a role of socially mediated information [17]. We here present a system that allows
examination of micro-evolutionary processes in an isolated, small-scale marine environment for a highly mobile
top predator.
The Galápagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) is endemic to
the archipelago and genetically distinct from its nearest
relatives [18]. Thus, any differentiation that can be traced
within the archipelago must be genuine and will not due
to an allopatric past with following reinvasion. Its marine
ecosystem is divided into two distinct habitats (Fig. 1,
Table 1): Fernandina and the west-coast of Isabela differ
from its east-coast and all remaining islands in bathymetry, water temperature and nutrient content [19]. While
waters on the central plateau are shallow ('Centre' hereafter), the sea west of Fernandina drops rapidly to depths of
several kilometres. Central waters are relatively warm and
low in nutrients; the 'West', in contrast, is influenced
strongly by the cold upwelling waters of the Cromwell
current. Such variation in physical properties between the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/150

areas results in considerable ecological differences. Primary production is markedly higher in the west, and is
particularly pronounced in the area east of Fernandina,
where iron concentrations are highest [20]. The distribution of animals dependent on aquatic resources mirrors
the ecological differences between these contrasting habitats. Viable populations of endemic sea birds as well as
colonies of the second Galápagos seal species, the Galápagos fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis), are essentially
confined to the more productive western habitat [21,22].
In contrast, the distribution of the Galápagos sea lion
includes both habitats. This results in a rather special situation, where both intra- as well as inter-specific niche differentiation between the two seal species could act as
ecological sources of selective divergence. It poses the
question, whether such environmental contrasts can
translate into genetic divergence in a species with a basically unlimited dispersal capacity across its entire range.

Results
Ecological divergence
The Galápagos sea lion and the Galápagos fur seal were
sampled extensively across their distribution ranges. Stable isotope analysis was used to provide insight into foraging ecology. δ15N values reflect differences in trophic
levels of prey items, whereas δ13C values indicate foraging
mode [pelagic or benthic: see e.g. [23,24]]. Although both
sea lions and fur seals are characterized generally as
pelagic foragers, we see differences in stable isotope signature values between syntopic populations of these species.
While mean δ13C values overlap between fur seals and
central sea lion colonies, values from western sea lion colonies are displaced significantly (Fig. 2). Quadratic discriminant function analysis underpins the difference
between sea lion colonies of different habitats (Wilk's λ =
0.336, F3,136 = 89.6, p < 0.001). The overall jacknifed classification success between the different sea lion populations was as high as 95% (Table 2A), indicating a clear
isotopic differentiation between the two habitats.

We further tested for homogeneity of variance in the isotopic signal that can be indicative of niche width differences [25]. For two pairs of directly adjacent populations
of sea lions and fur seals (IBES/Ag_IB and FH/Ag_FH, see
Fig. 1) variances in δ13C values are larger in sea lions
(IBES/Ag_IB: F23,29 = 34.90, p < 0.001, FH/AgFH: F21,29 =
9.92, p < 0.001), while differences in δ15N values are statistically non-significant after correcting for multiple testing (IBES/Ag_IB: F23,29 = 2.30, p = 0.04; FH/AgFH: F21,29 =
2.57, p = 0.02).
Morphological divergence
Analyses of skull features also show a differentiation
between the western and central colonies which may be
related to different foraging strategies (Fig. 3). Skulls from

western habitats are generally smaller, yet more robust,
than those from the central group. Mean condylobasal
length of adults are larger in central specimens than in
those from the western habitat (see Additional file 1). Variables that contribute most to inter-habitat variation are:
breadth of skull at preorbital processes, palatal notch –
incisors, length of upper postcanine row, rostral width,
gnathion – posterior border of preorbital process and pal-

atal breadth. Breadth of skull at preorbital processes, auditory breadth, and palatal breadth are greater in western
specimens than in central ones, both in mm and as a percentage of condylobasal length. Although absolute rostral
width values are similar in specimens from both habitats,
it appears greater in western specimens than in central
individuals when considered as a percentage of condylobasal length. Rostral length appears shorter in western

shorter, yet more robust, skull in western individuals. Discriminant function analysis shows that specimens of the
two habitats (west n = 27; central n = 9) are clearly separated from one another (Wilk's λ = 0.360, F13,22 = 3.013, p
< 0.01). The jack-knifed classification matrix successfully
classifies 72% of specimens to the right colony (Table 2B).
Genetic divergence
Analysis of mitochondrial sequences supports the pattern
of ecological and morphological divergence. Among the
three models tested (see Methods and Table 1) genetic
variation can be attributed almost exclusively to habitat
structure (AMOVA: Φst = 0.224, p < 0.001), whereas the
other models of hierarchical population structure explain
far less variation (colony pair-wise: Φst = 0.086, geology:

Φst = 0.097, pboth < 0.001). After correcting for habitat the
variance component of the colony-pair wise comparison
gets non-significant and explains only 1.2% of the overall
variance. A neighbour-joining tree based on mean corrected pair-wise distance between colonies further confirms the split (Fig. 4A).
Analysis of genetic differentiation at the level of microsatellites and the individual colonies using Goodman's
standardized Rst as the pair-wise distance suggests the
same habitat-related pattern (Fig. 4B). This split is corroborated by global estimates of traditional fixation indices
(Rst = 0.020; Gst' = 0.012, θ = 0.012: bootstrapped CI99%
= 0.005–0.021; G-statistic: p < 0.001).

Classification success and jacknifed classification success (in brackets) of the discriminant function analysis using A) stable isotope signatures and B)
multiple morphometric measurements as the predictor variable. Classification success describes the predictive accuracy with which an individual is
correctly associated with any of the classes of interest that were defined a priori. Correctly classified individuals are shown in bold.

As a further test for nuclear genome differentiation, we
used a Bayesian assignment approach. This has the advantage that inferences are made in the absence of any a priori
assumptions inherent in hierarchical frequentist
approaches. Overall, four clusters best explain the genetic
structure in the dataset (Fig. 5A). As expected, the Californian sea lion which was used as an outgroup (see Methods) forms a distinct cluster of its own (Fig. 5B, see
Additional file 2). Within the Galápagos archipelago the

existence of three genetic clusters is suggested. Assigning
the individuals to clusters in which membership coefficients are greatest shows that one cluster (cluster 4) corresponds to the western colonies with 85% of the
individuals assigned correctly (Fig. 5B, see Additional file
2). Membership of the remaining two central clusters is
evenly distributed across the central populations and no
geographical correlate thereof can be deduced (Additional
file 2). When these clusters are combined, 78% of the

Isolation by distance
We further explored the possibility that geographic distance contributes to genetic differentiation. Indeed, microsatellites as well as mitochondrial DNA data suggest
isolation by distance (Mantel test mtDNA: R2 = 0.37;
nDNA: R2 = 0.46; pboth < 0.001). However, in the case of
mitochondrial data, the correlation only reflects the habitat split (West versus Centre; Fig. 6). After partialling out
the effect of habitat the evidence for isolation by distance
disappears (partial Mantel test: R2 = 0.04, p = 0.25). For
microsatellite data, pair-wise comparisons of colonies
from the same habitat still follow a statistically significant,
but weaker, isolation by distance pattern (partial Mantel
test: R2 = 0.25, p < 0.001). The overall degree of scatter in
the genetic distance measure significantly increases with
geographic distance indicating equilibrium between gene
flow and drift in a stepping stone model of migration
(partial Mantel: R2 = 0.56, p < 0.001) [compare e.g. [26]].

Another noteworthy difference between the isolation by
distance pattern of mtDNA and nDNA relates to the variance of the genetic distance measure. For comparable geographic distances the variance in Fst between populations

(F19,45 = 1.14). For mtDNA the variance of Φst for interhabitat comparisons is four times as large as the variance
of intra-habitat comparisons (F19,45 = 4.12).

Discussion
Using ecological, morphological and molecular indicators, we find a clear structure between western and central
Galápagos sea lion colonies, even though these are
extremely mobile predators and breeding dispersal is
potentially unrestricted across the entire species range.
The mobility potential is well exemplified by the Californian sister species of the Galápagos sea lion [18] that can
easily travel several hundred kilometres during foraging
routines [27]. Similarly, for the Galápagos sea lion satellite telemetry data show that the scale of ecological and
genetic divergence lies well within the geographic range of
daily foraging trips [28]. In other marine mammals of
similar mobility [15] including species of seals [29] a
comparable degree of genetic differentiation is usually
found only at geographic scales that are about 10-fold
larger. This is not surprising, as high mobility usually
translates into strong gene flow. In elephant seals for
example, a single male can successfully father 19 offspring
8000 km from its natal rookery [30]. This calls for an
explanation beyond mere distance effects in the Galápagos sea lion, where homogenizing effects of even rare dispersal events would equally be expected as in other

polygynous animals. In the following, we discuss the possible factors that might play a role in this differentiation.
A role of ecology
Using the results of stable isotope analysis as a proxy for
maternal trophic ecology we find that individuals of the
Galápagos sea lion cluster according to their natal habitat.
Colonies in the central habitat are characterized by pelagic
shelf feeding, a foraging strategy that is also typical for the
closely-related Californian sister species. Conversely, colonies found adjacent to the deep, nutrient rich habitat in
the west show an atypical benthic signature. This difference in isotopic signatures between western and central
populations could simply reflect differences in food-webwide basal isotopes. It is however intriguing that the fur
seal, which overlaps with the sea lion in this habitat,
shows the typical pelagic δ13C values of eastern sea lions.
This counters the idea that differences in basal isotopes of
the foraging location alone account for the observed difference in the sea lions. It is rather indicative of resource
partitioning, potentially via character displacement in this
area where competition for a joint resource leads to specialization of at least one of the competing species. Grant
and Grant [31] have shown in two species of Galápagos
finch that such character displacement can occur rapidly.
As stable isotope values integrate maternal foraging strategies over several months (see Methods), the measured
effect could develop within even a single generation. On
the other hand, the changes in skull features are likely to

require longer periods of directional selection, suggesting
that the differences in foraging strategies are established
and stable in the respective populations.
It is clear that the data presented here can only be a first
hint towards such character displacement and need to be

substantiated by several independent lines of evidence
that go beyond the scope of this study [32]. Nonetheless,
other sources of information on Galápagos fur seals and
sea lions indirectly corroborate the interpretation of our
data as being indicative of niche segregation. Fur seals forage at night, western sea lions exclusively during the day

[33], whereas central sea lions show no apparent temporal pattern [unpublished data from long-term study on a
central rookery [34]]. Scat analyses revealed that, in contrast with central sea lions that are using a broad prey spectrum [35], trophic niches of fur seals and western sea lions
are highly specialised and show little overlap [36]. Furthermore, sea lions from the different habitats seem to
diverge in diving behaviour [28,37]; hence, dissimilar ecological conditions within the archipelago and the competition with fur seals in one habitat appear to evoke habitat
specialisation in the sea lion.
A role of natal habitat preference induction and social
behaviour
To develop levels of genetic differentiation that reflect the
ecological differentiation between different populations
of Galápagos sea lions, some form of pre-zygotic isolation
is required. Habitat choice would be one such mechanism
and could constitute a non-genetic means of assortment.
There is convincing theoretical and empirical evidence
that habitat preferences can be based solely on learning
[4,38]. For instance, early learning can lead to a lifetime
shift in feeding niche, even across species [39]. Natal habitat preference induction is particularly likely to evolve in
species with long lasting social bonds between adults and
young. The discussion regarding the role of socially mediated feeding styles of killer whales as the primary source
of genetic differentiation is a prominent example [17].
Likewise, genetic divergence between transient and resident wolf populations links to different foraging strategies
and suggests a similar explanation [40].

Galápagos sea lions are highly social animals, whose offspring are dependent on their mother for one to three
years [41]. They are likely to have the same long-term
memory [42] and high cognitive abilities as their Californian sister species [43]. The idea of socially mediated habitat learning thus seems not far fetched and is partly
supported by telemetry data on female Galápagos sea
lions. None of the surveyed females ever crossed the habitat border in any of the recorded foraging trips, although
it lay well within their mobility capacity [28]. In addition
to the "ecological" habitat the social environment may
contribute to reducing gene flow. In contrast to other species that only join for reproduction, Galápagos sea lions
maintain haul-out sites year round. In such a situation,
reproductive success is likely to be affected by long-term
interactions with others [34] and predictability of the
social environment is of prime importance [44-46]. Thus,
learned habitat preference induction – be it ecological or
social – may well contribute to pre-zygotic isolation.
The observed isolation by distance pattern strengthens
this idea. The mitochondrial marker reflecting matrilineal
inheritance shows no relationship between genetic and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/150

geographic distance after habitat identity is removed as a
factor. Thus, within one habitat, gene flow seems relatively unrestricted and genetic variants can spread across
the entire central region. This homogenizing effect of gene
flow that is witnessed by the absence of isolation by distance and the low variance of intra-habitat comparisons
suggests that site fidelity alone [44] is not strong enough
in this species to create significant population structure as
reported in other otariid seals [47]. Hence, environmental
differences seem to be key to the understanding of genetic
divergence. This is corroborated by the fact that the variance of genetic distance between rookeries of different
habitats is much larger than among rookeries of the same
habitat indicating that drift across habitats is strong relative to gene flow.
For microsatellites the isolation by distance pattern is in
line with a stepping stone model of a regional equilibrium
with gene flow and drift [compare [26]]. This clear difference from the mitochondrial pattern is not easy to explain
and may partly be due to the fact that differentiation of
the two markers differs by an order of magnitude. It may
further be due to the four times smaller effective population size of the mitochondrial marker or differences in
mutational dynamics between the two marker systems.
The most compelling explanation might lie in the large
difference in information content of the two markers.
While mitochondrial results are based on a short stretch of
sequence data in one locus, the results of nuclear DNA
stem from 22 independent highly variable microsatellite
loci. The information for the mtDNA may thus simply not
suffice to pick up the isolation by distance pattern
between populations sharing the same habitat.
Another factor bearing on the isolation by distance patterns could also be sex specific migration behaviour. The
nuclear pattern suggests that males are more likely to cross
occasionally the habitat boundaries, but would on the
other hand show high site fidelity even within the respective habitats, together with the females. While female site
fidelity is characteristic for most mammalian species [48],
short range dispersal in males is less common. Why then
would males restrict their dispersal to an area that is even
smaller than their daily putative foraging range? In contrast to other species that only join for reproduction, the
sea lion adult males are known to reside for years [Pörschmann et al. in prep, [49]]. In such a situation reproductive success is likely to be affected by long-term
interactions with others [34] and predictability of the
social environment is of prime importance [44,45]. For
males, in particular, long-term social dominance hierarchies, social queuing and 'dear enemy relationships' are
essential for territorial success [50-52]. The fact that males
of the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) return to
locations at a scale less their own body length year after

year [53] and males that are able to establish territories
several years in a row increase reproductive success [54]
can be interpreted along these lines.
A role of selection against immigrants
Apart from natal-induced habitat preference, an alternative mechanism that may contribute to pre-zygotic isolation was described by Hendry [55]. In a modelling
approach he proposed that selection against migrants
themselves can contribute substantially to ecologically
dependent reproductive isolation. Nosil et al. [56] even
suggested that this mechanism plays a critical role in ecological modes of speciation. Given the difference in ecology and the apparent behavioural and morphological
adaptations in the West, we might expect that immigrant
sea lions from the central area would have problems to
compete successfully with resident animals. Thus, once
ecological differentiation has been initiated, this factor
would stabilize any genetic divergence.
A role of geography and geology
The geology of the Galápagos can be described as a combination of concentrated volcanic activity at the archipelago's western rim (hotspot) and lithospheric motion that
carries the emerging volcanoes off in a north-eastern
direction. This results in a shallow submarine platform
with steep abysses at its western and southern side that
gently slopes to the north-east where it joins the intersection of two major tectonic plates [57]. These geological
processes lead to an almost linear island age structure
across the archipelago: easternmost islands are oldest (San
Cristobal, Española ~3 mya), westernmost islands are
youngest (Fernandina: ca. 0.08 mya [58]). Assuming comparable oceanographic conditions to those of today, we
would expect similar habitat differences across the archipelago over geological times. Without any geographic barriers, the cold upwelling western waters would mix with
warmer waters in the east, and ecological differences
would most likely resemble an environmental gradient. It
has been shown that such environmental gradients can
trigger genetic divergence into two discrete states in models of sympatric divergence [5]. The emergence of Isabela
in the west would have further accentuated this. The large
northern and southern volcanoes of Isabela emerged
about 0.2–0.4 mya ago [59] and probably joined only
within the past few thousand years (D. Geist personal
communication).

Conclusion
Our data show evidence for intra-specific divergence of
the Galápagos sea lion at ecological, morphological and
genetic levels, which may potentially lead to the emergence of a new species over time. Our analysis shows that
a multitude of factors may play a role in ecological divergence, including some behavioural conditions that are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/150

specific to the system. In particular, the data constitute an
example where substantial effects of a competitor species
on intra-specific evolutionary processes appears likely
[31,32]. Geographic isolation, on the other hand, seems
to play only a small role. Thus, our results are in line with
an increasing number of studies that suggest that the current dominance of allopatric and parapatric speciation
concepts in evolutionary theory may be in part an artefact
of studying speciation patterns at levels where the processes have long been completed. The study highlights that
divergence processes are likely to be based on a variety of
factors, and that little will be gained by exclusively adhering to a controversial debate about geographic speciation
scenarios [7].

Methods
Tissue sample collection and DNA extraction
A total of 376 tissue samples were collected from the interdigital membrane of the hind flippers from newborn individuals of the Galápagos sea lion and the Galápagos fur
seal at their natal colonies. Sampling locations were
spread uniformly across the Galápagos archipelago
excepting the northernmost islands of Darwin and Wolf
(Fig. 1, Table 1). Adjacent colonies with low individual
sample sizes were pooled, their geographic position averaged and subsequently treated as one entity (indicated by
four letter codes in Fig. 1). Samples of the Californian sea
lion were supplied from locations central to the taxon's
range containing adults (n = 5) as well as sub-adults (n =
11) (Table 1).
Stable isotope analysis
Skin samples for stable isotope analysis were taken from a
total of 140 the Galápagos sea lion pups and from 90
Galápagos fur seal pups (Table 1) that were about three
months old. This is an age where pups are nutritionally
fully dependent of their mothers [41]. The stable isotope
signature therefore exclusively represents maternal foraging strategies. Skin samples were oven dried at 65°C for
24 h. Samples were pulverised, weighed (ca. 0.55 mg) and
loaded into tin cups prior to analysis of carbon (δ13C) and
nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope ratios [for analytical details
see [60]]. Analytical precision was < 0.1‰ (δ13C) and <
0.3‰ (δ15N).

In order to examine whether isotopic and elemental variation in skin samples represented a viable means to differentiate the different genetic stocks and species, we ran a
discriminant function analysis using δ13C, δ15N and C:N
values as predictors of stock/species following Harrod et
al. [61]. We used a quadratic discriminant function as our
sample size differed between groups and because of heterogeneity of variance in some variables.

Morphometric analysis
A total of 43 skulls of the Galápagos sea lion held at several natural history museums and institutions (see Additional file 3) were measured for the following 13 variables
using Mitotoyo digital calipers (accuracy ± 0.01 mm):
condylobasal length, breadth of preorbital processes,
interorbital constriction, palatal notch – incisors, length
of upper postcanine row, rostral width, gnathion – posterior of maxilla (palatal), breadth of zygomatic root of
maxilla, zygomatic breadth, basion – zygomatic root
(anterior), auditory breadth, gnathion – posterior border
of preorbital process, palatal breadth at postcanine five.
All skulls were used for univariate statistics; thirty-six of
these (those with no missing variables) were used for discriminant analyses. Only fully grown adult specimens
with suture indices of > 23 for males and > 18 for females
were included in the analyses [62]. Raw data were initially
standardized to z-scores so that each variable had equal
weighting. Specimens were grouped according to the habitat where they were collected. Note that this leads to a
conservative classification estimate, since skull samples
may include occasional visitors that originate from other
habitats. Discriminant function analysis using SYSTAT 11
was applied to examine relationships between individuals
from the different habitats. Multivariate ANOVA
(MANOVA) was followed by either two-group or multigroup discriminant function analysis. The MANOVA was
applied initially to test whether group centroids for specimens were significantly different. Mahalanobis distances
of individuals from the mean centroid were plotted for
each habitat, against discriminant axes I and II. When
sexes were analyzed separately, both males and females
showed similar Mahalanobis distances. Due to low numbers of individuals from the western habitat (males = 5,
females = 4) sexes were pooled to provide greater resolution of results.
Mitochondrial DNA: laboratory procedures and data
analysis
After extraction of genomic DNA, the mitochondrial control region was amplified by use of PCR with taxon-specific modifications of highly conserved primers located in
the tRNAthr/pro and the tRNAphe region, purified by ultrafiltration and sequenced on an ABI 3730 sequencer [18].
Quality ascertainment and sequence alignment were conducted in SEQMAN™ version 6.1. (DNAStar Inc.). Individuals with less than 625 bp of reliably identified sequence
were excluded from the analysis leaving a total of 336
individuals. From these, 29 haplotypes can be distinguished. If alignment gaps are included as a fifth character
the number of haplotypes rises to 36. Sequences for all
individuals and the haplotype alignment are deposited as
alignment ALIGN_001234 in the EMBL-Align database
that can be accessed by the EBI sequence retrieval system
[63].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/150

Φst was inferred by AMOVA as implemented in ARLEQUIN 3.10. [64] and used as an estimator of hierarchical
population differentiation of the mitochondrial genome.
We compared three scenarios (see Table 1): comparisons
among colonies a) without any further hierarchical level,
b) grouping colonies by island geology following Rassmann et al. [65] c) grouping colonies by habitat type.
Genetic distances were based on the K80 nucleotide substitution model, which is closest to the substitution model
suggested by Wolf et al. [18]. Qualitatively, results were
unaffected by whether alignment gaps were or were not
included in the analysis.
Nuclear DNA: microsatellite genotyping and data analyses
Genomic DNA was genotyped for a total of 367 Galápagos sea lion and 16 Californian sea lions at 22 microsatellite loci [for further details see [18,66,67]]. Population
structure was inferred using the program STRUCTURE
[68] including the Californian sea lion in the analysis, as
otherwise the MCMC would not converge. Evanno et al.
[69] proposed an ad hoc statistic, ∆k, to detect the number
of clusters that best fit the dataset. We did not adhere to
this procedure for two reasons: firstly, it is not suited to
resolve less than three clusters and secondly, it may lead
to unreliable results, as the calculation of ∆k includes several chains that may have not converged. We therefore followed the original method by Pritchard [70], namely to
run several chains (10) and for each value of k select the
MCMC run with the smallest value of -log(Pr(x|k)). Conventional Fst [71] and Rst estimates [72] were used to estimate the degree of genetic differentiation between the
inferred populations using FSTAT 2.9.3.2. [73]. The G statistic proposed by Goudet et al. [74] was taken for statistical inference on global population differentiation.
Bootstrapped pair-wise Rst(Goodman) distances were
obtained from the software MICROSAT 1.5d [75] and
used for cluster-based tree reconstruction in the PHYLIP
module Neighbor [76].
Isolation by distance analysis
Stepping stone models on a two-dimensional space predict a linear relationship between Fst/(1-Fst) and the logarithm of geographic distance [77]. Because pairwise
elements of distance matrices are not independent, a
Mantel test with 104 permutations was used to test for the
statistical significance of this relationship ['ecodist package' in R [78]]. In migration – drift equilibrium the variance of the genetic distance measure is further expected to
increase with geographic distance [26]. We therefore
assessed if the degree of scatter in the genetic distance
measure increased with geographic distance. This was
done by first obtaining the residuals from a standard linear regression of genetic distance (Fst/(1-Fst)) on the logarithm of geographic distance. These residuals and the log
geographic distance matrix were then subjected to a par-

tial Mantel test to test for statistical significance. As population structure can artificially produce statistically
