Abstract
Background: Trichomonas vaginalis is a human urogenital pathogen responsible for trichomonosis,
the number-one, non-viral sexually transmitted disease (STD) worldwide, while T. tenax is a
commensal of the human oral cavity, found particularly in patients with poor oral hygiene and
advanced periodontal disease. The extent of genetic identity between T. vaginalis and its oral
commensal counterpart is unknown.
Results: Genes that were differentially expressed in T. vaginalis were identified by screening three
independent subtraction cDNA libraries enriched for T. vaginalis genes. The same thirty randomly
selected cDNA clones encoding for proteins with specific functions associated with colonization
were identified from each of the subtraction cDNA libraries. In addition, a T. vaginalis cDNA
expression library was screened with patient sera that was first pre-adsorbed with an extract of T.
tenax antigens, and seven specific cDNA clones were identified from this cDNA library.
Interestingly, some of the clones identified by the subtraction cDNA screening were also obtained
from the cDNA expression library with the pre-adsorbed sera. Moreover and noteworthy, clones
identified by both the procedures were found to be up-regulated in expression in T. vaginalis upon
contact with vaginal epithelial cells, suggesting a role for these gene products in host colonization.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of select clones showed that the genes were not unique to T.
vaginalis and that these genes were also present in T. tenax, albeit at very low levels of expression.
Conclusion: These results suggest that T. vaginalis and T. tenax have remarkable genetic identity
and that T. vaginalis has higher levels of gene expression when compared to that of T. tenax. The
data may suggest that T. tenax could be a variant of T. vaginalis.

Background
Trichomonads constitute a group of protists belonging to
the phylum Parabasala that are mostly parasitic or commensal flagellates inhabiting oxygen-poor environments
[1]. Trichomonas vaginalis is responsible for the number
one, non-viral sexually transmitted disease (STD) with ~9
million new cases of women with trichomonosis in the
US alone, and 250–350 million worldwide [2-5]. This

STD causes serious adverse health outcomes in women,
including adverse pregnancy outcomes, cervical neoplasia, atypical pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility
[6-8]. Men with trichomonosis may have non-gonococcal
urethritis, prostatitis, epydidymitis, and infertility [8,9]. A
relationship has been established between trichomonosis
and cervical cancer in women and prostate cancer in men,
respectively [6,10,11]. Significantly, there is an increased

risk for HIV seroconversion in both women and men following infection with T. vaginalis [12-17].
On the other hand, T. tenax is a commensal of the human
oral cavity found under conditions of poor oral hygiene
and advanced periodontal disease. Its prevalence in the
mouth ranges from 4% to 53% [18]. Interestingly, both T.
vaginalis and T. tenax have recently been reported to be
associated with broncho-pulmonary infections in patients
with Pneumocystis carinii or with underlying cancers or
other lung diseases [18-24]. Although speculative to date,
the organisms of both species are believed to enter the respiratory tract by aspiration from the oropharynx. While
lung infection by the oral trichomonads can be envisioned, the mechanisms by which the urogenital parasites
establish residence in the oral cavity for subsequent
oropharyngeal and respiratory infections is unclear. Furthermore and importantly, these reports question the
extent of the genetic interrelatedness and host site tropisms between these two species.
The phylogenetic analyses based on the rRNA and class II
fumerase gene sequences have shown that Trichomonas
species formed a closely related clade, including isolates
of Trichomonas gallinae, T. tenax, and T. vaginalis [25,26].
Given the common host specificity of T. vaginalis and T.
tenax, and the relatedness with respect to rRNA sequences,
we felt it important to attempt to determine the extent of
genetic identity between the two species. One strategy by
us was to identify uniquely-expressed genes of T. vaginalis
that may represent determinants that contribute to urogenital virulence and pathogenesis. We, therefore, used
two approaches. The first involved the subtraction cDNA
library approach and the second involved screening a
cDNA expression library with pooled patient sera
adsorbed with T. tenax antigens. We hypothesized that T.
vaginalis and T. tenax would be significantly genetically
unrelated to permit isolation of many uniquely-expressed
genes of T. vaginalis. However, to our surprise, while a few
T. vaginalis genes were identified, the genes were found to
be identical with those of T. tenax. We determined that the
isolated T. vaginalis genes had increased amounts of
mRNAs, indicating elevated expression at the transcriptional level. While functional analyses of these up-regulated genes may provide insight about the role of these
proteins in trichomonal virulence, our data suggest that
both T. vaginalis and T. tenax have remarkable genetic
identity but different rates of gene expression.

Results
PCR-based cDNA subtractive hybridization
We have successfully used the PCR-based cDNA subtraction method to isolate differentially expressed cDNAs
among two different cDNA populations called tester (T.
vaginalis) and driver (T. tenax) [27]. The driver cDNA pop-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/58

ulation is subtracted from the tester cDNA population by
hybridization, and the cDNAs present only in the tester
population are enriched and amplified by PCR. This oneway subtraction approach was used to enrich for T. vaginalis genes that were absent in T. tenax. One drawback with
this method is the bias in subtraction based on the transcript levels present in the two cDNA populations being
compared. In these experiments we found a high efficiency of subtraction as evidenced by the β-tubulin gene
amplification from subtracted and unsubtracted cDNA
populations (data not shown). After subtractive hybridization, several cDNAs that were up-regulated in T. vaginalis were identified by dot-blot analysis. Cloning and
subsequent sequencing of the numerous rescued cDNAs
revealed that thirty of the clones were independent, perhaps indicative of efficient subtractive hybridization. A
BLAST search revealed that the nucleotide sequences of 14
specific clones were completely identical to the known T.
vaginalis genes (Table 1), and some of the clones were
duplicates. In one case a clone was found in triplicate. The
up-regulated genes exhibited homologies with the
genomic sequences or expressed sequence tags encoding
various functional classes of proteins. The adhesin AP65
(decarboxylating malic enzyme) [28], numerous other
metabolic enzymes, and genes involved in cytoskeletal
rearrangements were among the apparent uniquelyexpressed genes. Interestingly, three genes of the GAPDH
multigene family were recovered.
In the second approach, triplicate screens with adsorbed
pooled patient sera of a cDNA expression library revealed
thirteen cDNAs, which gave only 7 total genes, again
including GAPDH (Table 2). Of particular interest was
that GAPDH and hypothetical protein 2 were both found
to be identical to those from the subtraction library above
(Table 1).
RT-PCR confirms increased gene expression
Figure 1A shows relative levels of transcription of representative genes that were analyzed by semi-quantitative
RT-PCR. The PCR products were separated and visualized
on ethidium bromide (EtBr)-stained gels. Intensities and
amounts of bands of the PCR products were absent for
fructose-bis-phosphate aldolase, fibronectin-like protein,
and alcohol dehydrogenase (numbered 3 through 5) or
considerably decreased as for AP65 (decarboxylating
malic enzyme) and GAPDH (numbered 1 and 2) in T.
tenax parasites when compared with RT-PCR products
derived from T. vaginalis handled identically. Given the
presence of decreased amounts of transcript for AP65 and
GAPDH, we wanted to examine whether the other genes
without visible EtBr-stained bands would be detected
through a second round of PCR amplification. Figure 1B
presents PCR results for fructose-bis-phosphate aldolase
with increased amounts of transcript. Similar results were

obtained for the fibronectin-like protein and alcohol
dehydrogenase 1. Scion image scans of each of the genes
through a second round of PCR for each of the genes is
presented in Figure 2 and shows the elevated expression
for these genes relative to a-tubulin. Compared to T. tenax
RT-PCR products, the range of increased expression varied
from approximately two-fold for AP65 to nine-fold for the
fibronectin-like protein-1. These data reaffirm the up-regulation of genes identified by the subtraction library.
Next, a partial sequence was amplified for each of the
genes analyzed by RT-PCR in T. tenax, and the sequence
data revealed that the T. tenax genes were identical in
sequence with that the T. vaginalis genes. Collectively,
these data indicate that there is high sequence identity
between T. vaginalis and T. tenax and that a distinguishing
feature between these two species is the elevated levels of
gene transcription by T. vaginalis.

Discussion
In this study we used the approach of suppression subtractive hybridization technique to attempt to identify
uniquely-expressed genes of T. vaginalis that may represent determinants that contribute to urogenital virulence

and pathogenesis. In addition, we also used a second
approach and screened a cDNA expression library with
pooled patient sera adsorbed with T. tenax antigens to
identify the uniquely-expressed genes of T. vaginalis.
Given the fact that T. tenax is usually regarded as a harmless commensal of the human mouth, and T. vaginalis and
T. tenax have the same host specificity but different colonization sites [30], we expected to identify many T. vaginalis uniquely-expressed genes through our approaches.
To our surprise and contrary to our hypothesis, we identified no genes that were unique to T. vaginalis. Indeed, the
very few genes that were obtained by both approaches
were then found to be present in T. tenax, but the genes
were increased in expression in T. vaginalis (Tables 1 and
2).
Confirmation of the expression of select genes using semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that all the genes that were
identified by the T. vaginalis subtraction library and cDNA
library with adsorbed patient sera were also present in T.
tenax, albeit at lower rates of expression. An earlier study

vaginalis of proteins by various environmental cues, such
as adherence, may suggest an important role as virulence
factors in urogenital infection. Indeed, AP65 is a prominent adhesin of T. vaginalis important for attachment to
vaginal epithelial cells [33-35].

cycles, separated on 1% agarose ethidium bromide gel. Part B

chomonad species also showed high similarities between
T. vaginalis and T. tenax [31]. Of the 5 transcripts whose
relative abundance was found to vary significantly, the
AP65, GAPDH, and hypothetical protein 2 were recently
found to be secreted or released during growth of T. vaginalis [29]. Equally noteworthy is that these proteins are
upregulated in expression upon parasite contact with vaginal epithelial cells [32]. The up-regulated expression in T.

While we expected a high genetic divergence between the
oral and urogenital trichomonads, the high genetic identity between T. vaginalis and T. tenax was surprising. While
whole genome comparisons are needed, these are not currently available. It is reasonable to hypothesize, therefore,
that if in fact these species are highly related or even identical, the minor variance between the two may have
resulted due to their introduction and residence in distinct
environmental niches. Contributing to their survival in
different mucosal sites may be the important distinguishing feature of higher rates of transcription by T. vaginalis
compared to T. tenax, which may have resulted from the
environments imposing unique survival pressures. Alternatively, the increased expression levels may result from
the gene duplication in the pathogenic species. In fact, the
genome sequencing project has revealed that T. vaginalis
genome has undergone expansion on a scale unprecedented in unicellular eukaryotes [36], and such gene family expansions are likely to improve the specific
adaptation of the organism to its environment [37]. Furthermore, there are variations between the 5S rRNA genes
of T. vaginalis and T. tenax (personal communication).
This fact may explain the expression levels of identical
genes within the two highly related species. Without a
doubt, such a modification in the gene inventory in the
genomes of pathogens would be an important evolutionary signal. In fact, several studies have shown a relationship between virulence, differential gene acquisition and
copy number, and gene expression in both bacteria and
viruses [38], and this may be what resulted to distinguish
T. vaginalis from the oral trichomonad. Therefore, it is
altogether reasonable that the levels of transcription and
synthesis of proteins in these two trichomonad species
may account for adaptability for survival in their respective oral cavity and urogenital regions.
Finally, our results may begin to delineate recent findings
regarding how both T. vaginalis and T. tenax are associated
with broncho-pulmonary infections in patients with
Pneumocystis carinii or with underlying cancers or other
lung diseases [18-24]. As mentioned above, the respiratory-lung environment is itself distinct from the oral cavity and urogenital region, but this niche obviously permits
survival of both regardless of the extent of gene expression
for T. vaginalis and T. tenax. While lung infection by the
oral trichomonads can be envisioned, the mechanisms by
which the urogenital parasites establish residence in the
oral cavity for subsequent oropharyngeal and respiratory
infections is unclear. Future considerations must now be

given regarding methods of transmission of T. vaginalis
into lung tissues. It is possible that this parasite colonizes
the oral cavity through oral sex and survives for extended
periods prior to aspiration and infection. It is equally theoretically possible that T. tenax is a genetic variant of T.
vaginalis distinguished by rates of gene transcription. It
may be unlikely that T. tenax infects the urogenital region
of women. One reason for this may be that this trichomonad is nonadherent to HeLa epithelial 9 cells [39]
and vaginal epithelial cells (not shown). As T. tenax has
the genes encoding adhesins, such as AP65 [32-35], this
inability to bind epithelial cells, a property preparatory to
infection and colonization, may help explain the tropism
of T. tenax to the oral cavity. It is conceivable that the
decreased level of expression of these adhesin genes in T.
tenax accounts for this inability to adhere to vaginal epithelial cells. These possibilities will require future experimental examination. We feel that this report now
questions the extent of the divergence between these two
species and shows high genetic identity between T. vaginalis and T. tenax.

Conclusion
Using two approaches did not yield any T. vaginalis
unique genes, suggesting strongly there is a high genetic
identity between T. vaginalis and T. tenax. For all of the
genes originally identified and examined as unique to T.
vaginalis, the genes were found to be identical in T. tenax.
We found higher rates of transcription in T. vaginalis compared with T. tenax. Our data may help explain recent
reports on the respiratory infections by both of these trichomonal species. Finally, attention needs to be given to
the possibility that T. tenax is a genetic variant of T. vaginalis.

Parasites
The fresh clinical isolates of T. vaginalis UT00-40 and T016
were grown in batch culture at 37°C no more than three
weeks in trypticase-yeast extract-maltose (TYM) medium
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum
[40]. The isolate T016 was used for construction of the
expression cDNA library that was used for screening with
T. tenax-adsorbed pooled patient sera, as described below.
The T. tenax Hs-4:NIH was grown in LYI Entamoeba
medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum as recommended by ATCC. The T. tenax isolate was confirmed using the PT3 sense primer (5'-AGTTCCATCGATGCCATTC-3') and the PT7 antisense primer (5'GCATCTAAGGACTTAGACG-3') [41].
PCR-based cDNA subtractive hybridization
Total RNA was extracted from T. vaginalis UT00-40 and T.
tenax organisms using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
The double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg
total RNA of each group using a Smart PCR cDNA synthesis kit (BD Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and were used
for suppression PCR-based cDNA subtractive hybridization using a PCR-select cDNA subtraction kit (BD Clontech). The cDNAs prepared from T. tenax and T. vaginalis
were regarded as driver and tester, respectively, and the
driver cDNA population was subtracted from the tester
cDNA population. Suppression PCR was performed to
prepare the cDNA pool, enriched for genes accumulated
in T. vaginalis (forward-subtracted). The resultant testerspecific cDNAs were amplified by PCR, and cloned into
pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The
detailed procedures were described in the protocol of the
PCR-select cDNA subtraction kit (BD Clontech). The subtracted cDNA fraction was cloned into a TA vector and
transformed into Escherichia coli to create an enriched T.
vaginalis cDNA library.
Sequencing and analysis
Colonies were randomly selected, and plasmids were prepared using a Miniprep kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). The
cDNA inserts were verified by restriction digestion, and
the clones were sequenced in the Washington State University institutional DNA-sequencing facility. Sequence
data was compared with the GenBank database using a
BLAST program.
RT-PCR analysis of selected genes
Differential expression of a subset of cloned genes was
confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA from
T. vaginalis and T. tenax parasites was reverse transcribed
with the oligo(dT)15 primer using Superscript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR amplification of cDNA was carried
out using gene-specific primers. The trichomonad a-tubulin gene was used as an internal control. Twenty-two

cycles were used for amplification of specific genes. As
there was no clear band detected for fructose-bis-phosphate aldolase gene, the initial PCR product was used as a
template to re-amplify the product if any, for 30 cycles. All
RNA samples without reverse transcription were also used
for PCR to detect genomic DNA contamination, and at no
time was DNA detected. PCR products were visualized on
EtBr-stained agarose gels. The band intensity was quantitated using the Scion image beta program. The PCRs were
carried out at four different times to verify the reproducibility of results. The result from a representative experiment is used here.

Screening of the cDNA library using pre-adsorbed T.
vaginalis patient serum
Specific, adsorbed anti-T. vaginalis patient antibodies were
obtained by incubation of the pooled patient sera with
immobilized nitrocellulose membranes first treated with
a preparation of total T. tenax proteins. Briefly, 1 × 109
washed T. tenax parasites in PBS were lysed by sonication
and boiled in 2 ml of electrophoresis sample buffer. The
nitrocellulose was then saturated with lysate for 3 h followed by washing with PBS. Lysate was used with other
membranes until depletion of the proteins was visibly
detected after SDS-PAGE and staining of gels. The membranes were then saturated with blocking solution (PBS
containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 10% skim milk) for 1 h.
Membranes were then incubated 2 h with 100 ml of
pooled patient sera diluted 1:50 in PBS containing 0.05%
NaN3 and 5% skim milk. The adsorbed sera was removed,
and bound antibodies were eluted by 3 washes of membranes in 100 ml of PBS-0.1 M glycine, pH, 3.0. The
adsorbed diluted patient sera were treated 3 separate
times. The T. vaginalis patient antibodies solution was
used to screen a previously-obtained λZAP II T. vaginalis
cDNA library. Fusion proteins were induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and recombinant
plaques detected with adsorbed antibodies. After cloning
and purification of reactive plaques, the corresponding
pBluescript plasmids were excised. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli XL-1-Blue. Plasmids
containing the cDNA coding for the T. vaginalis reactive
recombinant proteins were sequenced.
