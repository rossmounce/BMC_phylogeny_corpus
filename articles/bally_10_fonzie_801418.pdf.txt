FONZIE: An optimized pipeline for minisatellite
marker discovery and primer design from large
sequence data sets
Pascal Bally, Jonathan Grandaubert, Thierry Rouxel, Marie-Hélène Balesdent*

Abstract
Background: Micro-and minisatellites are among the most powerful genetic markers known to date. They have
been used as tools for a large number of applications ranging from gene mapping to phylogenetic studies and
isolate typing. However, identifying micro-and minisatellite markers on large sequence data sets is often a laborious
process.
Results: FONZIE was designed to successively 1) perform a search for markers via the external software Tandem
Repeat Finder, 2) exclude user-defined specific genomic regions, 3) screen for the size and the percent matches of
each relevant marker found by Tandem Repeat Finder, 4) evaluate marker specificity (i.e., occurrence of the marker
as a single copy in the genome) using BLAST2.0, 5) design minisatellite primer pairs via the external software
Primer3, and 6) check the specificity of each final PCR product by BLAST. A final file returns to users all the results
required to amplify markers. A biological validation of the approach was performed using the whole genome
sequence of the phytopathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans, showing that more than 90% of the minisatellite
primer pairs generated by the pipeline amplified a PCR product, 44.8% of which showed agarose-gel resolvable
polymorphism between isolates. Segregation analyses confirmed that the polymorphic minisatellites corresponded
to single-locus markers.
Conclusion: FONZIE is a stand-alone and user-friendly application developed to minimize tedious manual
operations, reduce errors, and speed up the search for efficient minisatellite and microsatellite markers departing
from whole-genome sequence data. This pipeline facilitates the integration of data and provides a set of specific
primer sequences for PCR amplification of single-locus markers. FONZIE is freely downloadable at: http://www.

Background
Satellite sequences are abundantly interspersed in the
genome of almost all eukaryotic species studied [1] and
have been analyzed extensively in animals [2-4], plants
[5], and more recently in fungi [6].
Two major classes of satellites are usually defined:
minisatellites (MS) and microsatellites (μS). μS are repetitive sequences of mostly 2 to 4 nucleotides with a
widespread occurrence in multicellular organisms,
whereas minisatellites are usually defined as the repetition in tandem of a short, 6 to 100 bp motif, spanning
100 bp to several kilobases [7].

μS analysis requires sophisticated separation and
visualization apparatus, due to the small size of the
individual repeat units. In contrast, and because of the
larger size of their individual core motif, MS can be
separated and visualized by conventional agarose gel
electrophoresis [6]. Using a panel of single-locus minisatellite markers, isolate-specific DNA fingerprint can be
produced in a PCR-based assay [8,9]. MS also provided
highly polymorphic markers for linkage studies [10]
making them informative genetic markers.
Genome mapping is still the primary tool for genome
knowledge in a series of model organisms. Due to their
small genome size and laboratory tractability, fungal
models such as the ascomycete yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the filamentous ascomycete Neurospora

crassa, have been pioneers in the process of building
genetic maps [11]. In this respect, the Dothideomycete
Leptosphaeria maculans causing stem canker of oilseed
rape (Brassica napus), is amenable to genetics in the lab
and is thus an adequate and complete model for genome-wide-based functional studies of pathogenicity, and
for identifying signalling and regulation processes
responsible for shifts in lifestyle [12]. Although preliminary genetic maps have been developed for L. maculans
[13-15], it is difficult to integrate these maps as the markers (RAPD and AFLP) used to generate them are not
readily transferable [16]. Based on the analysis of a set
of around 800 BAC-end sequence data, MS were found
to be powerful for genetic mapping or population
genetic studies in L. maculans [6]. The availability of
the L. maculans genome now enables the generation of
a large quantity of such markers, which could allow the
saturation of the genetic map and improve population
genetic studies and pathogenicity gene discovery [12].
Despite the availability of whole genome sequences, in
silico MS identification and primer design is still a
laborious process, requiring the use of different softwares and numerous steps of marker validation, which
take time and often generate errors. Most of the currently available software or pipeline solutions are
focused on the identification of μS [17-19]. Moreover,
they are usually platform dependent [20], or may need
several tedious pre-processing steps [19,21]. In order to
avoid these constrains and to reduce time, FONZIE has
been developed to automate and facilitate the design of
PCR primers from large sets of sequences, that will
amplify single locus MS and their flanking sequences,
with the possibility of excluding some specific regions of
the genome from the MS design process. This pipeline
integrates various external tools such as BLAST [22],
Tandem Repeat Finder (TRF) [23], and Primer3 [24].
FONZIE is able to successively perform TRF on a Fasta
or Multifasta formatted sequence file, search for markers
specifically located in user-defined sequence subset, as
exemplified here with GC-equilibrated isochores of L.
maculans, eliminate markers which do not satisfy userdefined criteria, eliminate markers which are not singlecopy, and finally design minisatellite primer pairs and
check the specificity of the PCR product. The primary
targeted public of FONZIE is biologists unfamiliar with
complex bioinformatics solutions. Therefore it does not
require a computer science background and can run on
personal computers, yielding results within an hour or
less for most queries.

Implementation
A comprehensive “readme” page includes details on how
to configure and run the pipeline, and how to search
and display FONZIE results.

Before launching FONZIE, users must have installed
the Python programming language on the computer. In
a second step, users must create a database of sequences
(ideally, the whole-genome sequence of the investigated
organism) in order to perform BLAST during the execution of the pipeline. In our project, the database used
was the pilot genome of L. maculans (45.12 Mb, 76
Super-Contigs, Table 1) as a Multifasta file.
Pipeline Components

FONZIE consists of three major components: a set of
pipelined programs, a BLAST database and a graphical
user interface (Figure 1). The FONZIE pipeline consists
of Python modules allowing the execution of different
external software programs.
The BLAST database was created with FORMATDB, a
BLAST [22] database-related tool. The graphical user
interface was implemented with a Python graphic standard
library named Tkinter. FONZIE was developed under both
Linux Ubuntu 7.10 and Windows XP operating systems.
The automated process consists of six steps (Figure 2):
Tandem Repeat Finder

FONZIE accepts nucleotidic sequence files in Fasta or
Multifasta format and uses the Tandem Repeat Finder
software [23] in order to find tandemly repeated elements (minisatellites and microsatellites) (Figure 2 step
a). TRF parameters can be modified via the graphical
user interface (Figure 1).
Exclusion of markers in specific regions

Isochores have been described for many eukaryotic
organisms such as plants and mammals [25,26]. Isochores are very long stretches of DNA that are homogeneous in base composition and are compositionally
correlated with the coding sequences that they embed.
In the L. maculans genome this structure is particularly
clear, with alternation of GC-equilibrated coding regions
with no or few transposable elements (TE) and AT-rich
regions mainly composed of degenerated and truncated
TE and encompassing very few ORFs [13,27]. Due to
these particularities, most micro-or minisatellites identified in L. maculans AT isochores are not single locus
markers and have to be excluded from the search for
single locus markers. This can be easily extended to all
repeat-rich genomes such as that of the Oomycete Phytophthora infestans containing 74% of repeats [28].
In order to exclude such specific genomic regions
from the search for markers, FONZIE compares the
location of the tandem repeats with that of the AT-rich
isochores (or whichever other user-defined sequences).
Tandem repeats fully or partially overlapping the ATrich isochores (or other user-defined sequences) are
thus automatically excluded from the analysis (Figure 2
step b). The AT-rich isochores or other user-defined
sequences to be excluded must be specified in a GFF

format file. If no isochore regions, or any other regions
to be excluded from the search for MS, are specified,
FONZIE analyses all the tandem repeats found by TRF.
Length and percent match screening

Markers are then screened for the size of the core motif
(more than 6 bp by default), and the percent matches
between core motifs (i.e., the percentage of matched
bases between tandem repeats of the core motif within
the MS, more than 90% by default). A minimum of 90%
identity between core motifs was selected here because
previous experiments showed that it was a characteristic
of minisatellites showing actual sequence length polymorphism in L. maculans [[6]; unpublished data]. The
output of this step is a Fasta formatted sequence file for
each selected marker (Figure 2 step c).
Screening for specificity of the markers

This step verifies the specificity of the selected MS (Figure 2 step d). Each MS is analysed for sequence similarity using BLAST [22] against a BLAST database, created
by users, with a default E-value cut-off set at 1e-10. This
value can be modified via the graphical user interface.
Typically, the specificity is evaluated against the whole
genome sequence if available.
Using the output of the BLAST, FONZIE classifies MS
into 4 categories, defined by both the number of
sequences in the BLAST database matching the query
sequence (i.e. with BLAST E-value < 1e-10) and the Evalue obtained for the query sequence compared to that
obtained for other matching sequences, as follows:
1) MS for which the BLAST results exhibit a
unique match in the database, corresponding to the

query sequence, hereafter referred to as “UNIQUE
COPY”.
2) MS for which the BLAST results exhibit several
matches on several sequences, with a best hit on the
query sequence, hereafter referred to as “MULTIPLE
COPIES”.
3) MS for which the BLAST results exhibit several
matches on several sequences, with a best hit on
other sequence than the query sequence, hereafter
referred to as “MULTIPLE COPIES (BEST HIT ON
SEQUENCE X)”. X represents the sequence id. with
the best alignment score. The repetition of the
motifs among the whole genome can explain such
results.
4) (Rare) MS for which the BLAST results exhibit no
match on any sequences with the default cut-off of
E-value at 1e-10, hereafter referred to as “NO
BLAST RESULTS” (0.2% in the case of L. maculans,
Table 1). The high default threshold parameter of
the E-value (1e-10), the low complexity of the
motifs, or the small size of the MS sequence can
explain such results.
“MULTIPLE COPIES (BEST HIT ON SEQUENCE X)”
and “NO BLAST RESULTS” are automatically excluded
for the next steps of the analysis.
Primer design

In order to design primer pairs flanking the MS
sequences, FONZIE extracts 100 bps by default on each
side of the query sequence whenever possible (or whichever other user-defined length, modified via the graphical user interface, Figure 1). Otherwise, FONZIE

extracts the maximum number of nucleotides available
upstream and downstream of the MS sequence.
FONZIE then uses Primer3 [24] which analyses the
flanking DNA sequences in order to define suitable forward and reverse PCR primers, designed with the standard set of constraints of Primer3 (Figure 2 step e):
optimal primer size at 20 bases pairs, optimal Tm at 60°
C, and optimal primer GC content at 50%. These parameters can also be modified by users via the graphical
user interface (Figure 1). FONZIE then calculates the
final product size range as the size of the MS (= the size
of the core motif × the number of repeats as defined by
TRF) + 2×, or 10×, the minimal primer size (chosen by
users), for the minimal and the maximal size, respectively. The first primer pair returned by Primer3 is displayed by FONZIE. If no primer pairs are found with

Primer3, the result is displayed as “NO DESIGNED PRIMER” in the final text file.
Virtual PCR

The virtual PCR step validates the specificity of amplification products identified in step e (Figure 2 step f).
Each amplification product is analysed for sequence
similarity using BLAST against all the sequences of the
BLAST database. The E-value cut-off is fixed at 1e-40
by default and may be modified by the users. The same
type of analysis is implemented in the SAT software
[19], but SAT only verifies the specificity of the PCR
primers, whereas FONZIE analyses the specificity of the
whole amplification product.
Using the outputs of the virtual PCR step, FONZIE
classifies sequences in 4 categories according to the specificity of amplification products. These categories are
exactly the same as for the markers’ specificity screen.
Running the pipeline

Users have to provide an input sequence (Fasta or Multifasta format), and a GFF format file if they want to
exclude specific regions from the analysis.
Setting parameters and pipeline execution

TRF default options are as follows: alignment parameters of 2,7,7, which correspond to the weight attributed to each match, mismatch and indel, respectively,
between core motifs of the MS; minimum alignment
score of 50; maximum period size of 500, pM (i.e., the
average percent identity between the copies of a pattern)
of 80; pI (i.e., the average percent of insertions and

Bally et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:322
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/322

deletions between the copies of a pattern) of 10
(Figure 1) [23]. Users can modify through the graphical
interface all TRF parameters, but also the screening
parameters (i.e., the minimum identity between core
motif fixed by default at 90%, and the size of the
motif, >6 bps by default) as well as the two BLAST
cut-off parameters (E-values cut-off of 1e-10 and 1e-40
by default) (Figure 1).
Visualization of results

At the end of the process, users have access to all the
files and directories created at each step of the pipeline.
A final tab-delimited text file summarizes, for all numbered satellites found by FONZIE, the name of each
satellite automatically attributed by the pipeline, the
core motif of each satellite, the number of repetitions of
the core motif, the BLAST results of specificity of the
satellite and of the amplification product (i.e. if the marker and the amplification product are found as a unique
copy or not), the sequences of the forward and reverse
primers and the start and the end location of the amplification product on the input sequence (Table 2).
Sequence files and directory

FONZIE allows traceability of each step of the pipeline
by generating a directory and associated files. FONZIE
displays a DAT file created by TRF which contains the
information of all tandem repeats detected on the input
sequence. A text file shows the different consensus
sequences of each marker, its position on the input
sequence as well as period size, copy number, consensus
size, percent matches, percent indels, the score and the
status of each marker.
A directory named “MARKERS_SEQUENCES” is created at the end of the first screening step which contains all the markers found by FONZIE, in Fasta format.
Another directory named “AMPLIF_PRODUCTS_SEQUENCES”, contains the Fasta files for the sequence of
each amplification product. A last directory named
“MARKERS_RECAP” contains, for each MS, a text file
summarizing the marker sequence, the marker sequence
with flanking regions, the amplification product
sequence, the amplification product status, the positions
of the amplification product on the query sequence, and
the output of Primer3 indicating the characteristics of
the primers and their location in relation to the MS
(Figure 3).

Results and discussion
Performance

FONZIE was firstly assessed on the whole L. maculans
genome. The 45 Mbs were analysed in 23 minutes
(Table 1). FONZIE found 2606 minisatellites, with 2405
amplification products occurring as unique copies, 146
in multiple copies. Six amplification products had no
BLAST results, and 49 markers were identified for

Page 5 of 9

which no primers could be designed. 92% of the
markers identified by FONZIE, following exclusion of
repeat-rich AT-rich isochores thus corresponded to
putatively unique sequences in the genome and could
be further used for analysis of polymorphism in isolates
and genetic mapping and/or population genetics studies.
In a second step, FONZIE was used to mine 6 other
fungal and Oomycete genomes. These genomes, sized
from 34 Mb to 228 Mb (Table 1), range from compact,
repeat poor genomes (Aspergillus niger, Stagonospora
nodorum, Pyrenophora tritici repentis and Botrytis
cinerea) to repeat rich genomes of the basidiomycete
Laccaria bicolor [29] and the Oomycete P. infestans
[28]. MS were found using the same parameters as for
L. maculans, but without defining user-specified genomic regions to be excluded from the analysis. In all
cases, numerous MS could be identified and extracted
in a very limited time interval, i.e. between 2 minutes to
cover the A. niger whole genome to 3 h21 min to scan
the P. infestans genome sized 228 Mb over 4921 contigs
(Table 1). This analysis suggests some genomes are
extremely rich in MS (e.g., the B. cinerea genome; Table
1). It mainly indicates that an average of 70-83% singlecopy markers are identified whenever the genomes
investigated are poor in repeats or when repeat-rich
regions are excluded from the analysis, as done here for
L. maculans (Table 1). In contrast, only 23-30% of markers were found to be single-copy markers in the genomes of the repeat-rich fungi and Oomycete L. bicolor
and P. infestans if analysing the whole genomes with
FONZIE, without user-defined exclusion of repeat-rich
sequences.
Biological validation

For validation of the proposed approach, primer pairs
for 517 putative single-copy MS markers (i.e. with core
motif ≥6), scattered along 17 L. maculans supercontigs
(with AT-rich isochores as excluded regions), were
PCR-assayed on a set of 9 L. maculans natural isolates.
More than 90% of the primer pairs (475) amplified a
PCR product, with size compliant with the expected MS
size. This yield is very similar to that of the currently
available tools such as STAMP, yielding 83.33 to 91.67%
of successful amplifications, depending on the species
[30]. Among these PCR-amplified sequences, 44.8% (213
primer pairs) showed resolvable size polymorphism
between at least 2 of the 9 tested L. maculans isolates.
Finally, 24.8% of the 517 MS (i.e. more than 55% of the
polymorphic MS markers) were found to be polymorphic between isolates ‘a.2’ and ‘H5’, the two parental
isolates of the L. maculans genetic map [13]. Progeny
analysis confirmed that all these markers segregated as
single loci, i.e. with a 50:50 ratio, as expected for this
haploid organism.

Figure 3 Example of one file from “MARKERS_RECAP” directory generated by FONZIE. From top to bottom: the marker sequence, the
marker sequence with flanking regions, the amplification product sequence, and the primer3 output

In previous experiments, MS markers were searched
for in L. maculans by using the TRF application alone
[6], with a yield of only 13% of polymorphic minisatellites out of 30 primer pairs tested, even though a wider
range of isolates (21 isolates instead of 9 in the present
study) was used for the polymorphism screen. Only
10% of the primer pairs from this preliminary study
were found to be polymorphic between isolates ‘a.2’
and ‘H5’, compared to 24.8% in the present work.
These results not only validate the efficiency of the
pipeline but also confirm the potential of MS as
genetic markers in L. maculans, since it can be extrapolated both from Table 1 and these results that more

than 530 MS could be mapped to the reference L.
maculans map.

Conclusion
FONZIE is a user-friendly application, optimised for MS
marker identification and specific PCR primer design. It
brings together external software like Tandem Repeat Finder, Primer3 and BLAST, to perform them in one run for
PCR primer pair design. FONZIE is time-saving, reduces
errors that might be introduced by analysing sequence by
hand and is easy to use. Users only need to upload their
sequences, a reference database, an optional file containing
excluded genomic regions, and select appropriate

parameters. Moreover, FONZIE can cover whole genomes
in one run. This tool is generic enough to be used on the
DNA of any organism and is particularly well adapted to
whole genome sequence from which specific regions (ATisochores for examples) need to be excluded.
The main innovation of the pipeline is to integrate
two successive steps of BLAST to check the specificity
and uniqueness of the MS loci identified by TRF. The
usefulness of the pipeline has been demonstrated here
for the fungus L. maculans, since 100% of the polymorphic markers identified were single locus, and the
yield of identification of polymorphic markers has been
more than doubled compared to manual search for MS
without BLAST steps.
