Abstract
The new animal phylogeny disrupts the traditional taxon Articulata (uniting arthropods and
annelids) and thus calls into question the homology of the body segments and appendages in the
two groups. Recent work in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii has shown that although the set of genes
involved in body segmentation is similar in the two groups, the body units of annelids correspond
to arthropod parasegments not segments. This challenges traditional ideas about the homology of
"segmental" organs in annelids and arthropods, including their appendages. Here I use the
expression of engrailed, wingless and Distal-less in the arthropod Artemia franciscana to identify the
parasegment boundary and the appendage primordia. I show that the early body organization
including the appendage primordia is parasegmental and thus identical to the annelid organization
and by deriving the different adult appendages from a common ground plan I suggest that annelid
and arthropod appendages are homologous structures despite their different positions in the adult
animals. This also has implications for the new animal phylogeny, because it suggests that
Urprotostomia was not only parasegmented but also had parasegmental appendages similar to
extant annelids, and that limb-less forms in the Protostomia are derived from limb-bearing forms.

Findings
Arthropods and annelids have their body divided into a
series of repeated units that bear pairs of appendages in
most cases. These body units and their appendages have
long been regarded as homologous structures and have
been the basis for uniting annelids and arthropods as sister taxa in the taxon Articulata [1]. The so-called "new animal phylogeny", however, does not support this close
relationship between annelids and arthropods and rather
places them in two different branches of protostome phylogeny termed Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa, respectively [2]. This suggests that body segments and
appendages in annelids and arthropods might have originated separately and are therefore not homologous. On
the other hand recent results suggest that at least segmen-

tation might have an ancient origin that predates or coincides with the origin of the Bilateria [3].
In arthropods the body units are first specified in a parasegmental register [4] and later these parasegments are
transformed into segments by re-segmentation during
embryonic development [5]. Intriguingly, recent work
using the expression of the segmentation genes engrailed
(en) and wingless (wg) has demonstrated that re-segmentation does not occur in annelids and the body units in
annelids thus remain parasegments [6,7]. This also makes
annelid appendages (parapodia) parasegmental rather
than segmental structures and this is further evidenced by
the expression of the appendage marker Distal-less (Dll/
Dlx) [7]. This calls into question the homology between

annelid parapodia and the appendages of arthropods
(arthropodia). Here I show that in an arthropod species,
the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana, the early body
organisation including the limb primordia is identical to
the annelid condition. This demonstrates that arthropodia like parapodia are initially parasegmental organs and
suggests that both share a common evolutionary origin.
Artemia franciscana development includes a larval stage
(nauplius) (Figure 1A). The nauplius consists of an anterior part, comprising the ocular region, labrum, first and
second antenna and mandibles, and a posterior part,
which is a more or less undifferentiated trunk. In nauplii
at stage III (staging after [8]) this trunk region develops
two bulges (boxed in red in Figure 1A) followed by a
smooth region, the "growth cone". The reason for the two
bulges is that there are already the mesodermal blocks
forming beneath the ectoderm [8]. The large bulge contains, still in a single block, the mesoderm for several
future segments (first and second maxillary, and first thoracic segment), the second smaller bulge contains the
mesoderm for the second thoracic segment. These two
bulges are thus the first morphological sign of subdivision
in the trunk region. I used the expression of en [GenBank:X70939] and wg [EMBL:AM774593] to identify the
location of parasegment boundaries in the trunk. en is
expressed in the anterior portion of the smaller bulge and
in the anterior part of the growth cone following the
smaller bulge (Figure 1B). wg is expressed at the posterior
border of the large bulge and in the posterior portion of
the smaller bulge (Figure 1C). In some specimens, that are
further into stage III, the wg stripe in the posterior part of
the large bulge is separated from the morphological
groove by about two cell diameters (Figure 1D). The significance of this is presently unclear. It could be a sign of
the beginning resegmentation at this location or might be
correlated with patterning mechanisms specific to the
large bulge which is a complex structure comprising several future segments. Double-label in situ hybridizations
of wg with en could clarify this, but have been technically
impossible in Artemia so far. Based on the opposition of
wg and en expression across the morphological grooves
between large bulge and small bulge (at least in early stage
III) and between small bulge and growth cone (throughout stage III) the morphological units at stage III are still
parasegments and the morphologically visible indentations (grooves) between them coincide with the parasegment boundaries. I then used the expression of the
appendage marker Dll [EMBL:AM774594] to identify the
appendage primordia. Dll expression shows that the first
appendage primordia are already specified at stage III
(Figure 1E). Surprisingly, Dll is expressed in groups of cells
anteriorly adjacent to the grooves and thus in front of the
parasegment boundary. Thus, the limbs in Artemia ini-

tially are parasegmental structures, identical to the parapodia of the annelids (see [7]).
Hejnol and Scholtz [9] have studied limb primordium
formation (as marked by Dll protein expression) in the
crustaceans Orchestia cavimana and Porcellio scaber.
Because in these species the cell lineage is known, these
authors were able to demonstrate that the limb primordium starts as a single cell and expands by activation of
Dll in adjacent cells. I propose that arthropods use this
expansion mechanism to transform their initially parasegmental appendage primordia into segmental appendages
after re-segmentation (Figure 1F, upper row). By contrast,
annelids do not re-segment and the clonal boundaries of
the parasegments are retained as the definite morphological borders between the body units. I suggest that because
of this, the restrictive influence of the morphological borders between the parasegments cannot be overcome by
the primordia of the parapodia, resulting in a lack of
expansion of the primordia (Figure 1F, lower row). This
model thus derives the adult arthropod condition from a
common body organisation in immature arthropods and
annelids by the arthropod-specific processes of re-segmentation and subsequent expansion of the appendage
primordium across the parasegment boundary.
In the adult animals arthropodia and parapodia have different positions on the body (segmental versus parasegmental). This argues against their homology. The present
data, however, show that the primordia of these appendages have identical positions in the immature animals and
thus arguably derive from a common ancestral structure
(i.e. they are homologous). This strongly suggests that
Urprotostomia, the last common ancestor of annelids and
arthropods, was not only already parasegmented [6,7],
but also had parasegmental appendages. This also has
consequences for the discussion of animal evolution
[10,11] because it suggests, that the last common ancestor
of the Lophotrochozoa (Urlophotrochozoon) and of the
Ecdysozoa (Urecdysozoon) had appendages and the
appendage-less forms in both Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa have lost their appendages secondarily (Fig. 2). Data
from the Onychophora show that in older embryonic
stages en is expressed in the posterior portion of the
appendages and thus in a segmental fashion like in
arthropods [12]. This suggests that re-segmentation was
already present in the Urecdysozoon (see arrow in Fig 2).

Methods
Artemia culture and fixation
Artemia franciscana cysts were purchased from Dohse
Aquaristik (Grafschaft-Gelsdorf, Germany) and were activated in seawater (34 g seasalt per litre) with constant oxygen supply at 25°C. Larvae were harvested after 24, 48 or
72 hours. Fixation of nauplii proved to be difficult. Best

Figure 1 (see previous primordia in the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana
Parasegments and limb page)
Parasegments and limb primordia in the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana. (A) Explanatory drawing of a stage III
nauplius larva. The anterior part consists of the ocular region (oc), labrum (lr), first antenna (an1), second antenna (an2) and
mandible (md). The part of the trunk that is shown in B, C, and D is boxed in red and magnified. The trunk consist of a large
bulge (containing the mesoderm for the presumptive segments of the first and second maxillae (Mx1, Mx2) and first thoracic
appendages (Th1)) and a smaller bulge (containing the mesoderm for the second thoracic segment (Th2)). All following body
units form from the growth cone. (B) Expression of engrailed in the anterior trunk. The asterisks denote the engrailed stripes of
the future first and second maxillary segment. The engrailed stripes just posterior to the arrows are the stripes of the future
first and second thoracic segment. The arrows in B-E point to the grooves between the parasegments. (C-D) Expression of
wingless in the anterior trunk. The asterisk denotes the wg stripe of the first maxilla. The second maxilla does not (yet?) express
wg. The nauplius in D is slightly older than the one in C. Note that the expression of wg is not directly anteriorly adjacent to
the groove between large and small bulge in the older nauplius. (E) Expression of Distal-less in the anterior trunk reveals that
the circle shaped appendage primordia are located anterior to the grooves. (F) Schematic summary of the model of appendage
allocation in annelids and arthropods proposed here. Shown are two hemi-parasegments for each animal group, anterior is to
the top. See text for details. Dark grey: en expression; light grey: wg expression; red: Dll/Dlx expression in the appendage primordia.

Figure 2
Evolutionary hypothesis for the origin and loss of appendages in the Protostomia
Evolutionary hypothesis for the origin and loss of appendages in the Protostomia. Based on the model shown in Fig.
1F, the common ancestor of Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa, termed Urprotostomia [6], was parasegmented and had parasegmental appendages. No change of this ancestral condition is required in the lophotrochan lineage; the ancestral lophotrochozoan ("Urlophotrochozoon") is virtually identical in body organization to Urprotostomia. In the ecdysozoan lineage the
processes of re-segmentation and appendage primordium expansion were evolved. This likely happened before the split of all
extant ecdysozoans (arrow), based on the arthropod-like expression of en in the appendages of onychophorans [12]; the
ancestral ecdysozoan ("Urecdysozoon") thus had already an adult body organization consisting of segments and segmental
appendages. The limb-less forms in both Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa must then be derived from limb-bearing forms by secondary loss of appendages (denoted by the black bars).

results were achieved after washing the nauplii in DanKlorix cleaner (Colgate-Palmolive, Hamburg, Germany)
for 5 minutes and subsequent fixation in PEMFAH (3 ml
PEMS, 450 μl formaldehyde (37%), 5 ml heptane) at 4°C
over night. After fixation the nauplii were transferred to
methanol and stored at -20°C. Best possible tissue fixation was determined to be the case when after the methanol treatment the orange pigment of the nauplius eyes
was preserved and the tissue within the appendages was
white rather than clear.
In situ hybridisation
Artemia nauplii were rehydrated stepwise in PBST and
then sonicated for 5 seconds with a tip sonifier (Branson
Cell Disruptor B15). Sonication was optimal when more
than 50% of all nauplii were destroyed. They were then
treated according to the published protocol for Glomeris
marginata [13] with the following modifications: acetylation lasted for 1 hour; anti-Dig antibodies were preabsorbed against fixed and sonicated nauplii for 24 hours at
4°C in PBST supplemented with 2% sheep serum.

Gene cloning
For RNA extraction, cysts were activated in sterilized and
filtered sea water and the nauplii were harvested 48 hours
later. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from this total RNA
using the SuperScript II system (Invitrogen). The Artemia
engrailed gene has been reported previously [14] and a
fragment was cloned with gene specific primers designed
on the basis of the published sequence [GenBank:X70939]. A fragment of the homeobox of the
Artemia Distal-less gene has been cloned using the previously published primers eDP fw, eDP bw, iDP fw and iDP
bw [13]. Within this sequence two nested gene specific
primers were designed and were used in two subsequent
PCR reactions together with the primer DP dlxm1 [13] to
amplify a larger portion of the gene that spans from the
homeobox to the DLX-1 motif [15]. A fragment of the
Artemia wingless gene was cloned using the primers
reported previously [4].
