Abstract
Background: Shotgun sequences of DNA extracts from whole organisms allow a comprehensive
assessment of possible symbionts. The current project makes use of four shotgun datasets from
three species of the planktonic freshwater crustaceans Daphnia: one dataset from clones of D. pulex
and D. pulicaria and two datasets from one clone of D. magna. We analyzed these datasets with
three aims: First, we search for bacterial symbionts, which are present in all three species. Second,
we search for evidence for Cyanobacteria and plastids, which had been suggested to occur as
symbionts in a related Daphnia species. Third, we compare the metacommunities revealed by two
different 454 pyrosequencing methods (GS 20 and GS FLX).
Results: In all datasets we found evidence for a large number of bacteria belonging to diverse taxa.
The vast majority of these were Proteobacteria. Of those, most sequences were assigned to
different genera of the Betaproteobacteria family Comamonadaceae. Other taxa represented in all
datasets included the genera Flavobacterium, Rhodobacter, Chromobacterium, Methylibium, Bordetella,
Burkholderia and Cupriavidus. A few taxa matched sequences only from the D. pulex and the D.
pulicaria datasets: Aeromonas, Pseudomonas and Delftia. Taxa with many hits specific to a single
dataset were rare. For most of the identified taxa earlier studies reported the finding of related
taxa in aquatic environmental samples. We found no clear evidence for the presence of symbiotic
Cyanobacteria or plastids. The apparent similarity of the symbiont communities of the three
Daphnia species breaks down on a species and strain level. Communities have a similar composition
at a higher taxonomic level, but the actual sequences found are divergent. The two Daphnia magna
datasets obtained from two different pyrosequencing platforms revealed rather similar results.
Conclusion: Three clones from three species of the genus Daphnia were found to harbor a rich
community of symbionts. These communities are similar at the genus and higher taxonomic level,
but are composed of different species. The similarity of these three symbiont communities hints
that some of these associations may be stable in the long-term.

Background
Metagenomics is the field that infers the properties of a
habitat through the analysis of genomic sequence information obtained from a sample usually collected from a
single habitat. The sequences are usually compared to
databases, with the aim to characterize the biological
community of this habitat. Among the advantages of this
explorative method are the free and uncomplicated sampling of the material, the possibility of obtaining
sequences from unknown and unculturable organisms,
the absence of any taxonomic restrictions and the relative
ease of conducting such studies [1-4]. Metagenomics studies have been done in various habitats, including sea
water [5], ice cores [6] and deep mine communities [7].
Of particular recent interest has been the application of
metagenomic approaches to study samples obtained from
organisms, which harbor various symbionts, such as
unknown and uncultuable bacteria, protozoa or viruses.
For example, the symbiont communities of honey bees
[8], the guts of mice [9] and humans [10], marine sponges
[11], oligochaetes [12] and plant-rhizobacteria [13]
revealed many new symbiont taxa. However, not only
samples collected with the aim to find symbionts revealed
previously unknown organisms, but also datasets from
genome projects where one single genome was targeted
may contain sequences of other species, presumably symbionts [14]. Here we report on the bacterial communities
associated with three clones each from one species of crustaceans of the genus Daphnia, which had been used in
genome projects and revealed besides sequences to the
targeted species, a rich body of sequences to other species.
We use the term symbiont to include organisms that were
found to be associated with the samples of these Daphnia,
disregarding whether they are parasites, commensals or
mutualists. We cannot rule out, that some of these organisms are independent of the Daphnia, e.g. free living bacteria in the water, parts of the ingested food or
contaminants from handling the samples. For simplicity
we use the term symbiont throughout this article.
Daphnia is a genus of small freshwater plankton living in
standing freshwater bodies. Their body sizes ranges from
0.3 to 5 mm. They are primary consumers in the aquatic
food chain and their ecology and evolution has been
intensively studied [15]. Numerous ecto- and endo-parasites have been described [16,17], but the non-parasitic
bacterial symbionts of Daphnia are very poorly known.
Electron micrographs typically reveal large numbers of
bacteria associated with Daphnia, as is illustrated with the
examples in Figure 1. The entire body of Daphnia can be
coated in thick bacterial mats [16,17]. Thus, Daphnia are
likely to carry a community of prokaryotes with them.
Only one case of a possible mutualist has been reported
so far. Chang and Jenkins [18] reported the presence of
photosynthetically active gut endosymbionts in Daphnia

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/172

obtusa. They speculate that the Daphnia take up plastids via
phagocytosis, after the lysis of the mother cell in the gut.
Variations in ultrastructure lead them to assume that plastids from different sources are taken up, including Cyanobacteria. These findings have not been confirmed for any
other Daphnia species, although the ecological niches of
Daphnia species are often strongly overlapping.
Here we take advantage of shotgun sequences obtained
from three laboratory clones (= iso-female lines) each
from one Daphnia species to search for indications of bacterial and plastid symbionts. For this we compared the
sequences against the NCBI-nt database on nucleotide
sequences using BLASTN [19] and analyzed and ordered
the results using the metagenomics software MEGAN
[20]. This software allows the exploration of the taxonomic content of a community sample based on the NCBI
taxonomy. Community shotgun datasets represent
sequences independently sampled from random regions
of genomes randomly selected from a given community.
These sequences can have very different levels of conservation. Without any assumptions about the functions of the
sequences used, MEGAN associates each sequence to the
lowest common ancestor of the set of taxa it hits. Thus,
species specific sequences are assigned to low order taxa
such as species or strains, while widely conserved
sequences are assigned to high-order taxa. In other words,
the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the
level of conservation of the sequence. The strength of this
statistical approach is that it makes use of all kind of
sequences for taxon identification. Therefore, when using
random sequences MEGAN, will usually show better taxonomic resolution than an analysis using only a small set
of phylogenetic markers [20]. This type of analysis is in
particular useful when, as is the case here, datasets are analyzed, which were obtained by random shotgun sequencing, rather than targeted sequencing (see also [21]) and
where the length of the sequence reads are short [20,22].
Our choice to use the software MEGAN for the analysis of
the datasets from the Daphnia projects is based on several
aspects, which help to reduce known problems in comparative metagenomics. A known shortcoming of the
assignment of sequences to taxonomic groups is its inability to deal with horizontally transferred genes and the inability of mapping sequences to internal nodes of the tree
[23]. However, these problems are mainly of concern
when using "best-BLAST-hit" mapping. The software
MEGAN was developed to avoid this problem (see previous paragraph). A further problem of assigning sequences
to taxonomic groups is the well know bias in the taxon
representation in our databases [24,25]. This problem
cannot be fully solved, but the ability of MEGAN to assign
sequence to the lowest common ancestor, ameliorates the
consequences of a database bias. Sequences will be

assigned to the common ancestor of the true species in
question and those being represented in the database.
Novel sequences will not be assigned at all [20].
The aims of our analysis were first to compare the shotgun
sequences of the prokaryote communities coming from
three Daphnia species. Second to test if the shotgun
sequences give evidence for a plastid symbiont in Daphnia
as had been suggested [18]. Third, to estimate the repeatability of a metagenomics approach using two different
sequencing platforms, the pyrosequencers GS 20 and GS
FLX [26] for one of the three Daphnia species.

Results and discussion
In the four datasets, sequences that were assigned to
known cellular organisms varied from 9% to 18% (Table
1). The vast majority of the assigned sequences were to
Eukaryota and to Bacteria. Few sequences were assigned to
the NCBI Taxonomy categories: Archaea, Viroids, Other
and Unclassified. Only among the D. pulicaria sequences

were hits (a total of 4) found to viruses. However, the low
bit scores suggest that these may have other origins. As the
scaffolds of D. pulex included in this study had been presorted to include only bacteria, there might have been
more hits to taxa other than Bacteria and Eukaryota.
The numbers of bacterial genera (excluding the Firmicutes) with at least two reads assigned were 90, 123, 37
and 51 for the D. pulex, D. pulicaria, D. magna GS 20 and
D. magna GS FLX datasets, respectively. The lower number
of genera revealed by the D. magna datasets corresponds
with the smaller size of these datasets (Table 1, Table 2).
This large number of genera indicates a rich community of
bacteria in and on Daphnia. In all datasets the majority of
the sequences were assigned to the Gamma- and Betaproteobacteria (Fig. 2), which together accounted for more
than 87% of the sequences assigned to bacteria. Outside
the Proteobacteria, the Bacteroidetes and to a lesser degree
to the Actinobacteria were found, the later however,
mainly in the D. pulicaria dataset. Except the Actinobacte-

1 The Firmicutes were excluded, because the D. magna datasets contained a bacterial parasite belonging into this taxon. For each dataset, the sum
of columns 2, 4, and 5 is less than the total number of sequences analyzed (Table 2) due to the few sequences assigned to other NCBI taxonomy
categories such as "Other" and "Unclassified".
2 The unassigned sequences are sequences without hits above the defined thresholds (See Materials and Methods). They may be A) sequences that
do not have homologs in the current NCBI-nt database, B) sequences that evolved so strongly that their homologs are disguised by bit scores
below our threshold or C) sequences that are assigned to species to which no other sequences is assigned (min-support threshold = 2).

Assignment of sequences to the bacteria, without
Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria
The majority of the assigned sequences fall on two phyla,
the Bacteroidetes and the Proteobacteria. Among the
Bacteroidetes, most sequences were assigned to the Flavo-

bateriales (between 187 to 463 sequences per sets, or 1.3
– 7.7% of the sequences) and a very large proportion of
those to the genus Flavobacterium (Fig. 3). Within this
genus, no single species stuck out as giving a better match
than other species. Flavobacteria are a group of opportunistic pathogens (e.g. salmon), commensals (e.g. in infusoria, cnidaria) [27] and intracellular symbionts of insects
[28-30]. They are widely distributed in freshwater habi-

tats, but also occur in association with terrestrial hosts.
Some members of Flavobacteria are known to play a significant role in the degradation of proteins, polysaccharides,
and diatom debris in natural environments [31,32]. Cultured representatives of Flavobacteria with ability to
degrade various biopolymers such as cellulose, chitin and
pectin were described [33]. The commonness in all datasets here indicates that they may indeed be symbionts of
Daphnia. One may speculate that Flavobacterium may play
a role in food digestion in Daphnia, which mainly feed on
unicellular planktonic algae [34]. This hypothesis has to
be tested with a targeted approach.
Another genus of the Bacteroidetes, which was consistently found in all datasets is Cytophaga (Fig. 3) These are
gliding bacteria found in freshwater and marine habitats,
in soil and in decomposing organic matter. However, hits
to this genus were never frequent (between 10 and 25
hits).
The phylum Proteobacteria attracted 98, 94, 84 and 88%
of the sequences assigned to bacteria in the D. pulex, D.
pulicaria, D. magna GS 20 and D. magna GS FLX datasets,
respectively. Table 3 shows the distribution of all Proteobacteria genera for which at least one dataset attracted
more than 1% of the sequences assigned to Bacteria.

The Alphaproteobacteria attracted a lager number of hits
(3.9 to 8% of sequences), with the genus Rhodobacter
being the most common in all three Daphnia species (0.4
to 2.8% of reads) (Fig. 4). Other genera of the Alphaproteobacteria were only found in the D. pulex or the D. pulicaria datasets (Fig. 4). Alphaproteobacteria are commonly
found in freshwater environments, including sewage.
They are known for a wide range of metabolic capabilities.
Rhodobacter were isolated from sea and freshwater.
The majority of the sequences assigned to the Proteobacteria (overall about 50% of sequences) where assigned to
the Burkholderiales within the Betaproteobacteria (Fig. 2,
Table 3). Within the Burkholderiales, one family, the
Comamonadaceae accounted for most of these hits (Fig.
5). The Comamonadaceae is a family of gram-negative
aerobic bacteria, encompassing the acidovorans rRNA
complex. Some species are pathogenic for plants. Within
this family four genera (Acidovorax, Rhodoverax, Polaromonas and Verminephrobacter) showed up repeatedly and in
high numbers in all datasets (Table 3, Fig. 5). The genera
Acidovorax and Polaromonas were particularly common. A
further genus, Delftia was only common in the D. pulex
and D. pulicaria sequences (Fig. 5).

in the other classes of the Proteobacteria, here the distribution was not even across the datasets (Table 3, Fig. 6).

from the datasets. However, there was no consistent picture across the three Daphnia species (Fig. 7).

Hits to species of the genus Aeromonas were found in large
number in the D. pulicaria dataset, but hardly in the other
sets (Table 3, Fig. 6). Hits were mainly to A. hydrophila and
A. salmonicida, but similarities were below 100%. Both
can live under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and are
found in water. A. hydrophila is an opportunistic pathogen
of humans, A. salmonicida causes the fish disease, furunculosis.

Searching for Cyanobacteria and plastid sequences
Following the suggestion of Chang and Jenkins [18] that
Daphnia may carry symbiontic plastids or cyanobacteria
with them, we looked more closely into these two groups.
The D. magna sequences revealed no hit to any Cyanobacteria taxon. Of the D. pulex sequences 44 (= 0.17% of the
assigned sequences) were assigned to the Nostocales, a
taxon of the Cyanobacteria. 19 (= 0.074%) of these hits
were to the genus Nostoc. In the D. pulicaria we found 22
sequences assigned to the Cyanobacteria, half of which
were to the Nostocales (Fig. 8).

The single most often assigned genus in the entire analysis
was Pseudomonas in the D. pulex dataset (10,994 assigned
reads, 43.3%). These hits were mainly to the species P. fluorescens (7,067 reads), and in particularly to the strain
PfO-1. Similar, but not as extreme was the presence of the
same bacterium in the D. pulicaria sequences (Table 3, Fig.
6). The P. fluorescens PfO-1 genome project was run in the
same genome center (The DOE Joint Genome Institute
(JGI, http://www.jgi.doe.gov/) where the D. pulex and the
D. pulicaria sequences were obtained and it seemed possible, that these hits reflect a contamination in the D. pulex
scaffolds, rather than a symbiont of D. pulex. However,
inspection of bit scores and sequence identity values in
the BLASTN outputs indicated that the Daphnia symbiont
is clearly not P. fluorescens PfO-1. The P. fluorescens group
includes diverse bacteria that are found in soil, but also in
aquatic environments.
A further contamination candidate is the Gammmaproteobacterium Serratia, to which we found 2,184 matched
sequences in the D. pulex genome. However, it is hardly
seen among the D. pulicaria sequences, and not seen at all
among the D. magna sequences (Table 3, Fig. 6). The species to which most sequences were assigned is Serratia proteamaculans 568, whose genome was sequenced as well by
the DOE Joint Genome Institute. Also here, the inspection
of the BLASTN results indicated high similarity, but few
perfect matches, excluding contamination at the JGI. Serratia are often associated with the human gut, but are not
pathogenic.
Another genus with many hits to the D. pulex and the D.
pulicaria sequences, but not to the D. magna sequences
(Table 3), is the already mentioned Betaproteobacterium
Delftia (Fig. 5). The DOE Joint Genome Institute
sequenced Delftia acidovorans strain SPH-1, which is the
strain most of the sequences were assigned to. However,
inspection of the BLASTN results again showed that the
Daphnia symbiont is clearly not D. acidovorans strain SPH1.

The D. pulicaria dataset revealed 23 sequences assigned to
plastids. One of them was a short sequence (100 bps) to
the chloroplasts of the green algae Chlamydomonas, the
other to the chloroplasts of flowering plants. Hits to the
later came mostly from one scaffold and had high bit
scores (> 500) and similarities of more than 90%. The D.
pulex sequences revealed no hits to plastids, but this is not
surprising, as the dataset had been sorted out to contain
predominately prokaryote sequences. The D. magna GS 20
dataset did not reveal any hits to plastids. The D. magna
GS FLX sequences contained a short sequence (104 bps)
matched to a plastid, the chloroplast of the green algae Stigeoclonium helveticum.
The presence of plastid sequences in Daphnia shotgun
datasets has however, to be looked at with care, as unicellular green algae are the main food of Daphnia, both in the
field and in the laboratory [34,35]. However, the few
sequences assigned to plastids here seem not to correspond closely with the algae, which were used to feed the
Daphnia in the cultures, before they were used for DNA
extraction. The D. magna and the D. pulex clone had been
kept on an exclusive diet of the green algae Scenedesmus sp.
and the D. pulicaria clone on a diet of the green algae Ankistrodesmus falcatus.
All in all we consider this as rather weak evidence for plastid symbionts in these Daphnia samples. The original finding was done in D. obtusa [18], which was not included in
our study. The authors had observed variation in the type
and frequency of plastid occurrence in this species, so it
may not be surprising that things are different in other
species. Furthermore, the long maintenance of the Daphnia clones in laboratory cultures may have contributed to
a loss of plastids. Therefore, the absence of evidence from
our metagenomics analysis is certainly not evidence for
the absence of possible plastid symbionts in Daphnia.

About 200 sequences matched Deltaproteobacteria (Fig.

Searching for 16S rDNA sequences
All four datasets were also analyzed with a more conventional approach, which was to identify contigs/scaffolds
similar to known 16S rDNA sequences. We compared our
data with a collection of 471,792 16S rDNA sequences
collected by the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP release
9 update 57) [36]. In total, 27 16S rDNA fragments were
identified in the D. pulicaria dataset, 13 in the D. pulex, 14
in the D. magna GS 20, and 11 in the D. magna GS FLX. Of
those, 17, 11, 9, and 10 bacterial species could be inferred
in the D. pulicaria, D. pulex, D. magna GS 20, and D. magna
GS FLX dataset, respectively. Other partial 16S rDNA
sequences were identical or almost identical to regions
conserved across species, thus could not be used to infer
the species. In Table 4 we listed close to full length 16S
rDNA sequences found in the four datasets. The nucleotide sequence identity between these sequences and their
corresponding best matches ranged from 91% to 100%.
Most best matched 16S rDNAs to our sequences were
from uncultured bacteria. Bacterial species that could be
inferred using 97% sequence identity as the cutoff value
included Pseudomonas sp., E. coli/Shigella and the already
discussed (see above) Flavobacterium sp. (Table 4). In both
D. pulex and D. pulicaria datasets, sequences highly similar
to 16S rDNA of unclassified aquatic bacterium R1-B19
were found, an undescribed beta proteobacterium (Table
4).

The 16S rDNA sequences identified only a small subset of
the species/genus found in our main analysis based on
comparison to NCBI-nt database. One likely explanation
of this discrepancy is the low sequencing coverage within
the 16S rDNA regions in the shotgun datasets. Another
explanation could be that some of the earlier predictions
were false positives. However, MEGAN associates a
sequence to the lowest common ancestor of the set of taxa
defined by all matches above defined thresholds. The
amount of false predictions is predicted to be low since
the algorithm makes higher amount of unspecific assignments to higher taxonomy levels [20]. Certainly when
taxa were inferred regardless if the matched sequence was
a suitable phylogenetic marker or not, it could not be
excluded that some of the predictions were results of horizontal gene transfer events. However, if this were the case,
MEGAN would assign the hit to the least common ancestor of the species, which were involved in horizontal gene
transfer, unless neither these species nor related species
are in the NCBI database. It was predicted that computing
taxonomic content based on sequence comparison to
NCBI-nt database will show better resolution at all levels
of the taxonomy than an analysis based on a small set of
phylogenetic markers or on 16S rDNA sequences alone
[20,21]. Our results are consistent with this prediction.

Despite the under-prediction and the differences between
the NCBI-nt and the 16S rDNA databases, quantitatively,
the two approaches correlated fairly well at higher taxonomic level (Fig. 9).
Searching for identical and similar sequences common in
four datasets
Although sequences in all datasets were assigned to similar bacterial taxa, it is not clear how similar the sequences
are across datasets. To identify common sequences, we
compared the D. magna GS 20 sequences with sequences
from D. magna GS FLX, D. pulex, and D. pulicaria using
BLASTN. Identical or nearly identical sequences were
identified when a stretch longer than 80% of a query
sequence can be aligned with over 98% nucleotide

sequence identity to a hit sequence. With this criterion five
D. magna GS 20 contigs (corresponding to six D. pulex
scaffolds and 12 D. pulicaria reads) were identified. Hits
identical to these sequences were all found in complete
genome sequences of Escherichia coli W3110
(AP009048.1) and E. coli K12 MG1655 (U00096.2),
which suggests that commensal E. coli strains carried by
the three Daphnia species are highly similar.
With a less stringent criterion (a stretch longer than 50%
of a query sequence can be aligned with over 90% nucleotide sequence identity to a hit sequence), similar
sequences to about 80 GS 20 contig sequences were also
identified across the datasets. These sequences mainly fall

clones, which had been kept in three different laboratories
for several generations before the DNA was isolated. This
may possibly influence our results in two ways. First, we
cannot truly make statements about three Daphnia species, but only about three clones, each coming from a different Daphnia species. Including more clones, might
reveal more bacterial symbionts. Second, while culturing
these clones in the laboratory, the symbiont community
may have changed both qualitatively and quantitatively.
New bacterial species may have arrived with food or culture conditions, while other bacteria may have been lost
due to the inappropriateness of the laboratory conditions
for their culture. For the current analysis, no attempts have
been undertaken to vary the culture conditions for any of
the three clones and the bacteria associated with the food
alga have not been analyzed.

Repeatability of the metagenomics approach
For D. magna we obtained two shotgun datasets, with
sequences produced with two different sequencing platforms, the pyrosequencers GS 20 and GS FLX. Figure 10
shows the number of sequences assigned to all prokaryote
genera (excluding the Firmicutes) in the two datasets. The
two datasets gave very congruent results, with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.98 (P < 0.001, n = 55). The plot
shows clearly that stochastic differences occur for genera
with very few hits. Expectedly, below 10 sequences
assigned to a genus, the datasets lead to quite divergent
result.
Using contigs instead of reads
For the D. pulicaria dataset, both contigs and singleton raw
reads were included in our analysis. For the other three
datasets, we used only sequences, which had previously

been assembled to contigs or scaffolds. This reduced the
number of sequences and thus the number of BLASTN
searches considerably. Using large numbers of raw reads
would have been beyond our computing power and the
abilities of the MEGAN software within a reasonable time
period. Using contigs and scaffolds influences the results
in various ways. First, it strongly reduces redundancy in
the dataset and therefore makes the analysis much
quicker. Second, it compromises somewhat the usefulness
of the number of assigned sequences as a measure for the
abundance for the different taxa. The number of assigned
sequences is still a relative measure for the frequency of a
given taxa, but the larger the real number of hits would
have been, the more strongly the value is reduced. Third,
rare members of the symbiont community are likely to
remain undetected, because the few reads sequenced for
rare species, were unlikely to be assembled in contigs.
Thus, our estimates of the number of taxa detected are
likely to underestimate the true number of taxa in the
community. This conclusion is also supported by the

observation that the D. pulicaria dataset contained the
highest number of taxa identified.

Conclusion
Our analysis of shotgun sequences of three clones, each
from one Daphnia species revealed a rich bacterial community to be associated with these clones. The particular
data structure of our analysis allows for certain conclusions to be drawn. First, the majority of the common bacterial taxa identified are found in all Daphnia datasets.
While the D. pulex and D. pulicaria clone cultures from
which DNA was isolated originated from laboratories in
North America, the D. magna cultures originate from a
laboratory in Switzerland. To the best of our knowledge,
there was never a cross Atlantic exchange of cultures
between laboratories by the time these samples had been
taken. Thus, we speculate that the similarity of the symbiont communities in European and North American Daphnia samples, indicates a long lasting stability of these
associations.

Page 17 of 21

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:172

Second, the symbiont communities across the three Daphnia species are remarkable similar, yet, they are not identical. At sequence level, the similarity breaks down,
indicating that each Daphnia species harbors different species or strains of bacterial symbionts.
Third, some bacterial taxa were found to be specific to the
two datasets produced in the DOE Joint Genome Institute
(JGI). Coincidentally, some of the published genomes in
these taxa had been originally sequenced by JGI, leading
to speculations of whether the JGI may have contaminated the Daphnia samples. Our analysis allows us clearly
to reject this hypothesis. Whether the bacterial taxa found
to be associated with specific Daphnia samples are contaminations of the laboratory where they were cultured
previous to sequencing, or if they are natural symbionts of
the Daphnia, cannot not be worked out here.
Fourth, there is no clear evidence for a stable cyanobacterial or plastid symbiont in the Daphnia species. The few
scattered hits to some plastid and Cyanobacteria may
have been a contamination with the algae food of the
Daphnia. Plastid symbionts had been observed in D.
obtusa [37]. However, the long laboratory culture of the
clones used in the genome study may have influenced the
presence of such a photoactive symbiont.

Methods
The D. pulex dataset
The sequences of D. pulex are from the DGC whole
genome sequencing project. The chosen D. pulex clone
called The Chosen One was cultured at Indiana University, Bloomington, USA on a diet of the green algae
Scenedesmus sp. The animals used to isolate the DNA for
the genome project were treated with tetracycline (250
mg/L overnight) before DNA isolation to reduce their bacterial load. Sequencing was done at the DOE Joint
Genome Institute (JGI) using the Sanger method. These
sequences were obtained from the wFleaBase website
http://wfleabase.org:7182/genome/Daphnia_pulex/cur
rent/genome-assembly-full-jazz_20060901/scaffold
seences/. Scaffolds included in this study were excluded
scaffolds, prokaryotic scaffolds, and possible bacterial
scaffolds in the current D. pulex genome assembly http://
wfleabase.org:7182/genome/Daphnia_pulex/current/
bacteria/dpulex_jgi060905_possible_bacterial.txt.
The D. pulicaria dataset
Daphnia pulicaria is closely related to D. pulex and forms
with intermediate characters are frequently encountered,
suggesting hybridization of these two species. Indeed,
allozyme test for allelic variation at the lactate dehydrogenase loci show both fast and slow electromorphic alleles,
indicating that the chosen D. pulicaria strain is a pulicaria/
pulex hybrid. This chosen D. pulicaria clone was cultured

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/172

at the Hubbard Center for Genome Studies at the University of New Hampshire, USA, on a diet of the green algae
Ankistrodesmus falcatus. Previous to it's culturing at the
University of New Hampshire it was maintained in a laboratory at Utah State University. The animals used to isolate the DNA for the genome project were treated with
tetracycline (250 mg/L overnight) before DNA isolation
to reduce their bacterial load. Sequencing of D. pulicaria
was also done at the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI)
using the Sanger method. A low coverage genome assembly of a D. pulicaria clone is available to DGC members,
and others may request access to this data. As the DGC
and JGI data agreements allow, this will be released for
public access on the wfleabase database: http://wflea
base.org/genome/Daphnia_pulicaria/. For more information on the D. pulex and D. pulicaria genome data see
http://wfleabase.org/.
The D. magna datasets
The sequences of D. magna originated from a shotgun
sequencing project which aimed at sequencing the
endoparasitic bacterium P. ramosa. During the analysis of
the data large number of sequences clearly unrelated to
the Firmicutes (the group to which P. ramosa belongs)
showed up. Only these sequences are included in this
paper. As these data are not yet published elsewhere, we
describe here the DNA isolation, library construction and
sequencing in detail.

Daphnia magna cultures were raised at the University of
Fribourg, Switzerland on a diet of the green algae Scenedesmus sp. The Daphnia had been exposed to the gram-positive bacterium Pasteuria ramosa, an endo-parasite of
Daphnia [17] when they were 3–5 days old. Most animals
became infected and were shipped for further processing
to the University of Florida, USA. One thousand P. ramosa
infected D. magna were suspended in 5 ml of Buffer A (1.0
M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) and homogenized gently in a glass pestle and mortar. The homogenate was
passed through a 50–100 micron metal mesh and 21
micron nylon mesh to remove Daphnia debris. About
5,000,000 P. ramosa cells were obtained and resuspended
in 450 l of Buffer A. These were added to an equal volume (450 l) of 2% agarose for preparing a gel plug to
embed the vegetative cells, and 10 gel plugs were produced. To disrupt cells gently, the gel plugs were transferred into Buffer B (0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5%
Brij 58, 0.5% sarcosine, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM
EDTA pH 8.0, 0.40 M NaCl) and incubated at 37°C overnight. These were then transferred into 10 ml of Buffer C
(100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM EDTA
pH 8.0, 0.5% sarcosine, 0.2 mg/ml protease K) at room
temperature. The gel plugs were transferred to 40 ml of
Wash Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA pH
8.0) and washed three times in a shaker at low speed for 1

hourrespectively to remove detergents. Gel plugs were
transferred to 40 ml of PMSF Buffer (1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl floride PMSF, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM
EDTA pH 8.0) and incubated at room temperature for 1
hourwith gentle shaking; this process was repeated with
fresh PMSF buffer. The plugs were then washed twice in 40
ml of Wash Buffer following incubation at 50°C for 20
minutes. The gel plugs were then transferred to 40 ml of
50 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and stored at 4°C overnight. The
DNA in the gel plugs was digested with 10 U of HindIII
per plug at 37°C for 30 minutes.
The gel plugs with the partially digested DNA were cut
into slurry. They were loaded onto a 1% agraose gel
(Sigma, Type VII, low gelling temperature), and sealed on
the top with agarose. Electrophoretic development
occurred in 0.7 × TAE Buffer using a FIGE apparatus under
Program 4 (BioRad, Hercules, CA 94547). Products ranging in size from 18 to 33 Kb were extracted from the gel
(estimated 60 ng DNA total) following the protocol of
GELase Agarose Gel-Digesting Preparation kit (Epicentre,
Madison, WI 53713), and used to prepare the cosmid
library.
The preparation of the cosmid library followed the procedures described by Bell et al. [38], with additional information described by Chow et al. [39]. In brief to construct
the cosmid library an estimated 60 ng of 18–33 Kb fragments recovered from gel were cloned into vector pCC1
which was digested with HindIII and then dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase followed the
protocol (Roche, Indianapolis, IN 46250). The ligation
products were packaged into bacteriophage particles using
MaxPlax Lamda DNA packaging extracts (Epicentre, Madison, WI 53713) according to the protocol of the kit. Bacteriophage containing an estimated 5 × 103 particles in 50
L were applied to infect 200 l of EPI300 cells grown to
exponential phase in LB liquid medium (Luria-Bertani
medium) containing 10 mM MgSO4 and 0.2% maltose,
which had been inoculated from the overnight culture
grown in LB containing 10 mM MgSO4. After absorption
following incubating at 37°C for 20 minutes, 1 ml of
fresh LB medium was added and incubated for an additional 45 minutes. The infected cells were spread on LB
1% agar plates containing 12.5 g/ml of chloramphenicol, 1 mM of IPTG and 40 g/ml of X-gal for selection.
The cosmid library was used in two runs of 454 pyrosequencing [26]. The first run was carried out on a GS 20
454 pyrosequencer, which gave read length around 90
basepairs (bps). The second run was done on a GS FLX
454 pyrosequencer, which gave reads length around 250
bps. Both pyrosequencing projects were done in the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida, Gainesville, USA. The reads obtained

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/172

from the GS 20 and the GS FLX shotgun sequencing were
separately assembled into contigs. These contigs were
used in the analyses presented here.
Scanning electron microscopy
For scanning electron microscopic (SEM) D. magna was
fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PB for 2 hours at
20°C. Sample was washed two times in distilled water for
5 to 10 seconds, dehydrated in graded ethanol series, and
critical point dried (CPD) overnight (16 hours). The specimens were coated with gold (20 nm) and viewed using a
Philips XL 30 ESEM under high volume conditions from
5 to 15 kv.
Data analysis
Sequences from the D. pulex, D. pulicaria and the two D.
magna datasets included in this study are described in
Table 2. Sequences were compared against the NCBI-nt
database on nucleotide sequences using BLASTN [19]
with the default settings in December 2007. Sequences
longer than 1000 bps were divided into overlapping fragments around 500 bps. Sequences were homogenized to
fragments of similar length so BLAST scores were comparable across different searches. Sequence comparison is
computational challenging and was performed with an
Opteron Linux high performance computer cluster established and maintained by the [BC]2 Basel Computational
Biology Center at the Biozentrum University of Basel
http://www.bc2.ch/center/index.htm. For the graphical
presentation of the results we combined the two D. magna
data sets.

For the analysis of the BLASTN results we used the metagenomics software MEGAN [20]. This software allows
exploring the taxonomic content of a sample based on the
NCBI taxonomy. The blast files were imported into
MEGAN using the import option BLASTN. The program
then uses several thresholds to generate sequence-taxon
matches. The "min-score" filter sets a bit-score cutoff
value. The "top-percent" filter is used to retain hits whose
scores lie within a given percentage of the highest bit
score. The "min-support" filter is used to set a threshold
for the minimum number of sequences that must be
assigned to a taxon. We used all default parameter settings
of the software (top-percent = 10, min-support = 2),
except the minimal threshold for the bit score of hits,
which were set at 100, following the recommendation of
the authors [20]. This reduces the number of reads
assigned to a taxon, but avoids assignment based on weak
homology. This analysis was done for all datasets between
the 8. and the 11. January 2008.
While inspecting the data we ignored reads assigned to
taxa other than plants and bacteria. Within the bacteria,
we ignored the taxon Firmicutes (mostly gram-positive

bacteria, many of which are endospore formers), because
the two datasets of D. magna came from animals infected
with the endospore forming pathogen, P. ramosa. The two
other datasets (D. pulex and D. pulicaria), had only few
sequences assigned to the Firmicutes (less than 0.2%).
Thus, excluding the Firmicutes from the analysis did not
influence the overall analysis.
In a separate analysis we manually inspected all four datasets for hits assigned to plant taxa (every taxon within and
including the Viridiplantae), searching for hits to plastids
(chloroplasts). For this analysis we set the MEGAN parameter minimum supported taxa to one.

Authors' contributions
WQ and DE carried out the Bioinformatics analysis. NG
and JP produced the D. magna sequences. DE designed the
study. FBA produced the SEM images. DE and WQ wrote
most of the manuscript. All authors took part in reviewing
and approval of the final manuscript.
