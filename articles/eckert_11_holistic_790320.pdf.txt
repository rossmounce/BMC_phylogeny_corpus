A holistic phylogeny of the coronin gene family
reveals an ancient origin of the tandem-coronin,
defines a new subfamily, and predicts protein
function
Christian Eckert, Björn Hammesfahr and Martin Kollmar*

Abstract
Background: Coronins belong to the superfamily of the eukaryotic-specific WD40-repeat proteins and play a role
in several actin-dependent processes like cytokinesis, cell motility, phagocytosis, and vesicular trafficking. Two major
types of coronins are known: First, the short coronins consisting of an N-terminal coronin domain, a unique region
and a short coiled-coil region, and secondly the tandem coronins comprising two coronin domains.
Results: 723 coronin proteins from 358 species have been identified by analyzing the whole-genome assemblies
of all available sequenced eukaryotes (March 2011). The organisms analyzed represent most eukaryotic kingdoms
but also cover every taxon several times to provide a better statistical sampling. The phylogenetic tree of the
coronin domains based on the Bayesian method is in accordance with the most recent grouping of the major
kingdoms of the eukaryotes and also with the grouping of more recently separated branches. Based on this
“holistic” approach the coronins group into four classes: class-1 (Type I) and class-2 (Type II) are metazoan/
choanoflagellate specific classes, class-3 contains the tandem-coronins (Type III), and the new class-4 represents the
coronins fused to villin (Type IV). Short coronins from non-metazoans are equally related to class-1 and class-2
coronins and thus remain unclassified.
Conclusions: The coronin class distribution suggests that the last common eukaryotic ancestor possessed a single
and a tandem-coronin, and most probably a class-4 coronin of which homologs have been identified in Excavata
and Opisthokonts although most of these species subsequently lost the class-4 homolog. The most ancient short
coronin already contained the trimerization motif in the coiled-coil domain.

Background
The coronin proteins, which were originally isolated as a
major co-purifying protein from an actin-myosin-complex of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum [1],
have since been identified in other protists [2,3], fungi
[4], and animals [5], but are absent in plants. Coronins
are a conserved family of actin binding proteins [6-8] and
the first family member had been named coronin based
on its strong immunolocalization to the actin rich crown
like structures of the cell cortex in Dictyostelium discoideum [1]. Coronins belong to the superfamily of the

eukaryotic-specific WD40-repeat proteins [9,10] and play
a role in several actin-dependent processes like cytokinesis [11], cell motility [11,12], phagocytosis [13,14], and
vesicular trafficking [15].
WD-repeat motifs are minimally conserved regions of
approximately 40-60 amino acids typically starting with
Gly-His (GH) dipeptides 11-24 residues away from the Nterminus and ending with a Trp-Asp (WD) dipeptide at
the C-terminus. WD40-repeat proteins, which are characterized by the presence of at least four consecutive WD
repeats in the middle of the molecule, fold into beta propeller structures and serve as stable platforms for proteinprotein interactions [9].
The coronin proteins have five canonical WD-repeat
motifs located centrally. Since the region encoding the

WD repeats is similar to the sequence of the beta-subunit of trimeric G-proteins the formation of a five-bladed
beta-propeller was assumed for coronins [16]. However,
the determination of the structure of murine coronin-1
(MmCoro1A [17]) demonstrated that the protein, analogous to the trimeric G-proteins, forms a seven-bladed
beta-propeller carrying two potential F-actin binding
sites. Apart from the central WD-repeats, almost all coronin proteins have a C-terminal coiled-coil sequence
that mediates homo-oligomerization [18-20], and a short
N-terminal motif that contains an important regulatory
phosphorylation site in coronin-1B [12]. In addition,
each coronin protein has a unique region of variable
length and composition following the conserved extension to the C-terminus of the beta-propeller.
Based on their domain composition coronins have originally been divided into two subfamilies, namely short and
long coronins [21]. Short coronins consist of 450 - 650
amino acids containing one seven-bladed beta-propeller
and a C-terminal coiled-coil region. Furthermore, the Nterminal region of most known short coronins contains 12
basic amino acids. Since this motif is only present in coronin molecules, it has been suggested as a novel coronin signature [21]. The longer types of coronin, also called POD
or Coronin 7, possess two complete core domains in tandem but lack a coiled-coil motif. In the longer coronins,
the sequence of the basic N-terminal motif is reduced to 5
amino acids. Based on phylogenetic relationships among
the coronins, the Human Genome Organization nomenclature committee (HGNC) proposed a system in 2001 that
grouped the short coronins into two classes resulting in a
total of three subtypes [8]. Very recently, a new nomenclature has been suggested dividing the coronins into twelve
subclasses based on the analysis of about 250 coronins
from most taxa [22]. In contrast to previous systems, every
mammalian coronin (and corresponding vertebrate homologs) was designated an own class resulting in seven vertebrate classes. Invertebrates were grouped into two classes,
the fungi got an own class, coronins from alveolates were
grouped with those from Parabasalids (class 10), and the
remaining coronins from Amoeba, Heterolobosea, and
Euglenozoa were combined into the twelfth class. This
study constituted the first major phylogenetic analysis of
the coronin family. However, this classification was not
consistent with the latest phylogeny of the eukaryotes and
homologs of some major branches like the stramenopiles
were missing.
Here, we present the analysis of the complete coronin
repertoires of all eukaryotic organisms sequenced and
assembled so far. The distribution of all coronin homologs is in accordance with the latest taxonomy of the
eukaryotes and reveals the origin of the tandem-coronin
and another newly defined class in the last common
ancestor of the eukaryotes.

Results
Identification and annotation of the coronin proteins

The coronin protein genes were identified by TBLASTN
searches against the corresponding genome data of the different species. The list of sequenced eukaryotic species as
well as access information to the corresponding genome
data has been obtained from diArk [23]. Species that
missed certain orthologs in the first instance were later
searched again with supposed-to-be orthologs of other
closely related species. In this iterative process all coronin
family proteins have been identified or their loss in certain
species or taxa was confirmed. Because verified cDNA
sequences and protein predictions, which often contain
mispredicted exons and introns even in the “annotated”
genomes, are not available for most of the sequenced species, the protein sequences were assembled and assigned
by manual inspection of the genomic DNA sequences.
Exons have been confirmed by the identification of flanking consensus intron-exon splice junction donor and
acceptor sequences [24]. In addition, the gene structures
of all coronin genes were reconstructed using WebScipio
[25,26]. Through comparison of the intron positions and
splice-site phases in relation to the protein multiplesequence alignment, several suspicious exon border predictions could be resolved and the protein sequences subsequently be corrected. The genomic sequences of many
species contain several gaps due to the low coverage of the
sequencing or problems in the assembly process. Only
some of the gaps could be closed at the amino-acid level
by analyzing EST data.
The coronin dataset contains 723 sequences from 358
organisms (Table 1). 614 sequences are complete, and an
additional 44 sequences are partially complete. Sequences
for which a small part is missing (up to 5%) were termed
“Partials”, while sequences for which a considerable part is
missing were termed “Fragments”. This difference has
been introduced because Partials are not expected to considerably influence the phylogenetic analysis. Several of
the genes were termed pseudogenes because they contain
too many frame shifts, in-frame stop codons, and missing
sequences to be attributed to sequencing or assembly
errors.
Multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis, and
classification

A multiple sequence alignment of all coronin family members has been created and extensively manually improved
(Additional file 1). The basis of the alignment was the conserved coronin domain that consists of the b-propeller
region and a subsequent conserved extension, which packs
against the “bottom” surface of the propeller [17]. This
entire domain is conserved in all coronin homologs and
we would therefore suggest naming it coronin-domain.
The unique regions following the coronin-domain could

only be aligned for homologs of closely related species.
The C-terminal predicted coiled-coil regions were aligned
again for all corresponding sequences to analyze potential
oligomerization patterns (see below). The second coronindomains of the tandem-coronins were also aligned to the
coronin-domains for the phylogenetic analysis. One part
of the coronin-domain in coronin-1D is encoded by a
cluster of mutually exclusive exons (see below) and therefore the exon with the higher sequence identity to related
homologs has been included in the alignment. The phylogenetic tree of the coronin family was calculated for 764
coronin-domains, including both coronin-domains of the
tandem-coronins separately, using the Bayesian (Additional file 2) and the maximum-likelihood method (Additional file 3). The resulting trees were almost identical.
However, the relations of the innermost nodes representing the most ancient relationships were best resolved
using the Bayesian approach (Figure 1). The resulting phylogenetic tree is in accordance with the latest phylogenetic
grouping of the six kingdoms of the eukaryotes [27-29] of
which five are covered by the data analyzed here. Thus,
coronins of phylogenetic related species group together in
the coronin family tree. In the coronin tree, not only the
grouping is retained but also the evolutionary history of
the branches. For example, the fungi separate as monophyletic group before the metazoans, and after the
Amoeba.
The classification into subfamilies should at best include
both the phylogenetic grouping of the protein family
members and the domain organisation of the respective
homologs. However, because most coronins contain a
unique region between the coronin-domain and the
C-terminal coiled-coil regions, several sub-branch specific domain organisation patterns evolved. To keep the

coronin classification as simple as possible and to provide the highest consistency with previous classification
schemes, the following classification is proposed: The
classification should solely be based on the phylogenetic
tree of the coronin-domains because it is in accordance
with the phylogeny of the eukaryotes and contains the
conserved part of the proteins that is the basis of the
protein family. Metazoan species encode two phylogenetically distinct groups of coronins that have historically
been named class-1 and class-2 coronins. Further variants of these classes should be named alphabetically,
e.g. class-1A, class-1B, etc.. However, due to the independent whole-genome, genomic region, and single
gene duplication events of certain phylogenetic branches
these variant designations do not always refer to orthologs. For the mammalian coronins, which are the best
analyzed coronins, the suggested classification is almost
entirely consistent with previous classifications [8] and
the HGNC nomenclature except for “CORO6” and
“CORO7”, which are here classified as coronin-1D and
coronin-3, respectively. Class-3 comprises the tandem
coronins. All members of this class group together in the
phylogenetic tree, and only single homologs have been
found in all species analyzed. Class-4 is a newly defined
class that contains coronins with variable numbers of
C-terminal PH, gelsolin, and VHP domains, but also coronins with only very short sequences outside the coronin-domain. The other coronins group in accordance
with the latest taxonomy of the species (Figure 1). In our
opinion it does not add information or help the scientific
community if those coronins were classified separately.
In contrast to the metazoans, gene duplications in the
branches of Amoeba, Excavata, and SAR are species-specific and do not warrant further subclassification at the
moment. For example, instead of talking about a “class11 coronin” and long explanations what type of coronins
would belong to such a class, it would be easier, shorter,
and less confusing to just say a “Naegleria coronin”, an
“apicomplexan coronin” or a “yeast coronin”. The distribution of the coronins analyzed here is summarized for
some example species in Figure 2 including previously
used names and classification schemes. The distribution
of all coronins is found in Additional file 4. Coronin
homologs are absent in Rhodophyta (Cyanidioschyzon,
Galdieria), Viridiplantae, Microsporidia, Formicata
(Giardia), and Haptophyceae (Emiliania).
Short coronins (class-1, class-2, and unclassified coronins)

The domain organisations of most short coronins (class-1,
class-2, and unclassified coronins) are similar. They consist
of the 390 amino-acid long coronin-domain followed by a
short unique domain and a C-terminal short coiled-coil
region (about 30-40 amino acids, Figure 3). The unique
regions are conserved in branches (e.g. the vertebrates

have similar regions, as do the arthropods, the nematodes,
etc.), but are not conserved for major taxa (e.g. fungi,
Metazoa, stramenopiles).
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae coronin, ScCoro
(CRN1), is known to bind to microtubules via its unique
region between the b-barrel domain and the coiled-coil
oligomerisation region (Figure 3, [30]). Two short
regions showing homology to the microtubule-binding
regions of MAP1B mediate this interaction. However,
the MAP1B sequence motif is very short (about ten residues) and not very specific comprising mainly glutamate
and lysine residues [30]. If the corresponding motifs in

ScCoro are responsible for microtubule-binding then all
yeast and Schizosaccharomyces coronins should be able
to bind to microtubules because they contain motifs
with similar amino acid compositions. A similar motif
or region could not be identified in the Pezizomycotina
coronins. While these supposed microtubule-binding
regions mainly consist of glutamate, lysine, proline, serine, and threonine and are not even conserved in very
closely related yeast species, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae coronin, ScCoro, has very recently been described
to contain a CA domain (C: central; A: acidic; [31]).
This domain, with which ScCoro activates and inhibits

is similar to CA domains in WASP family proteins [32].
The CA domain is well conserved but distinct within
the Saccharomyceta clade (Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina, Figure 4).

Surprisingly, the coronins of the Tremellomycetes (e.g.
Filobasidiella/Cryptococcus species) that belong to the
Basidiomycota encode a C-terminal dUTPase domain
(deoxyuridine triphosphatase domain) instead of the
coiled-coil region (Figure 3). These coronin sequences

are supported by many EST/cDNA clones for several of
the Filobasidiella species extending from the coronin
domain to the stop-codon. In addition to this dUTPase
domain, the Filobasidiella species contain a further
dUTPase in the genome that is conserved in the other
Basidiomycotes, and also the other fungi. The dUTPase
domains of the Tremellomycetes coronins contain all
characteristic dUTPase domain motifs [33] and are
therefore supposed to constitute enzymatically active
domains. dUTPases typically form homotrimer active
site architectures with all monomers contributing conserved residues to each of the three active sites [33].
Except for the prediction of trimerization of these coronins, which could be mediated by the dUTPase domains
instead of the coiled-coil domains in the other coronins,
it needs experimental data to link the function of actin
filament structure remodelling by coronins to dUTP
nucleotide hydrolysis in DNA repair by dUTPases.
Class-3 coronins

Class-3 coronins (Type III coronins) comprise homologs
that encode two coronin domains arranged in tandem
[8]. These two coronin domains are separated by unique
regions, and class-3 coronins do not encode coiled-coil
domains. As recently reported [31] the class-3 coronins

also encode a CA domain similar to the CA domain of
the WASP family proteins at their C-termini (Figure 3).
Based on the multiple sequence alignment of 112 class3 coronins from all major branches of the eukaryotes
the position of the C-region has slightly been adjusted
in comparison with a previous analysis (Figure 4; [31]).
Although the C-region of the class-3 coronins is not as
conserved as similar regions in the yeast short coronins
or in WASP family proteins, the characteristic pattern
of hydrophobic residues concluded by a basic residue is
visible in the homologs of all species (Figure 4). In contrast to the short coronins, the unique region between
the C-terminal coronin-domain and the conserved CAdomain is short (20-30 amino acids).
Like for the short coronins the Filobasidiella species have
surprising and species-specific tandem-coronins. The Filobasidiella class-3 coronins have a D-glycerate 3-kinase
domain between the two coronin-domains (Figure 3). Only
the termini of the Filobasidiella class-3 coronins are supported by EST/cDNA data, but long exons bridge the Nterminal coronin-domain and the glycerate 3-kinase
domain, as well as the glycerate 3-kinase domain and the
C-terminal coronin-domain. As found for the dUTPase
domain of the short coronins, the Filobasidiella species
contain an additional D-glycerate 3-kinase that has

Figure 4 Sequence conservation in the CA domains. The sequence logos illustrate the sequence conservation within the multiple sequence
alignments of the CA domains of the Saccharomycotina, the Pezizomycotina, and the class-3 coronins. The CA domains of the
Saccharomycotina and the Pezizomycotina are located within the unique regions of the short coronins while the CA domain of the class-3
coronins is at the C-termini of the proteins like in WASP family proteins. The regions between the C and the A domains are of variable length.

homologs in the other fungi and also in plants. Why it is
advantageous to connect an actin-filament binding function
to a glycerate 3-kinase needs experimental evaluation. The
glycerate 3-kinase domain is not found in the class-3 coronins of the other Basidiomycotes. Except for the Filobasidiella species only the insects have long insertions between
the two coronin-domains of their class-3 coronins. These
insertions are highly conserved, about 300 residues long,

and do not show any homology to known domains,
sequence motifs, and other proteins.
In contrast to the related species Rhizopus arrhizus
and Phycomyces blakesleeanus the coronin-3 of Mucor
circinelloides consists of only the second coronindomain of the tandem. We can exclude the possibility
of this being an artefact of the genome assembly for
three reasons. First, the genome sequence is continuous

Eckert et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:268
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/268

around MucCoro3. Secondly, there is no homology to
any part of the N-terminal coronin-domain of RhaCoro3
or PhbCoro3 in the genome although the sequence
identity of the C-terminal coronin-domains is about
65%. And finally, there is a TATA-box shortly upstream
of the MucCoro3 gene. Because a coronin-3 has already
been present in the most ancient eukaryote the loss of
the N-terminal coronin-domain must be specific to
Mucor circinelloides.
Class-4 coronins

Based on the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) and the
domain composition of the protein homologs, another
coronin class can be defined for which the Dictyostelium
discoideum homolog, also called villidin [34], would be a
representative (Figure 3). We suggest naming members
of this class class-4 coronins. Most class-4 coronins consist of an N-terminal coronin-domain followed by three
to four PH domains, four to five gelsolin domains, and a
C-terminal villin headpeace domain (VHP). Class-4 coronins were identified in two of the major kingdoms of
the eukaryotes, in excavates and opisthokonts. Furthermore, they are found in several of the sub-branches of
the opisthokonts, in amoebae, fungi, and the fungi/metazoa incertae sedis branch. Because class-4 coronins from
different species often contain different numbers of PH
and gelsolin domains, domain gain and loss events must
have happened in the respective branches or single species. However, there are not enough coronin-4 homologs identified yet to reconstruct the evolution of these
regions. In addition to these multi-domain class-4 coronins there is a group of class-4 coronins that just consists of the conserved coronin domain and is restricted
to some Amoebae species yet.
Alternatively spliced coronins

Alternative splice forms have been reported for two coronin homologs: five variants of coronin from Caenorhabditis elegans [35], CeCoro1 (Figure 5), and three variants
for coronin-1C from human [36], HsCoro1C. The
described splice variants do not concern the beta-barrel
domain but the structurally low-complexity region prior
to the coiled-coil region in CeCoro1 and elongations of
the N-terminus of HsCoro1C, respectively. In the
reported analysis of CeCoro1 [35] two splice sites (the
alternative 3’-splice site of exon7 and the alternative 5’splice site of exon8) do not obey the conventional splicing rules. Alternative 5’-splicing of exon8 would lead to
a premature stop-codon. In the four additional Caenorhabditis strains analyzed here, C. briggsae, C. japonica,
C. remanei, and C.brenneri, alternative 5’-splicing of
exon8 would not lead to a premature stop-codon at the
same position as in C. elegans but to transcripts of various lengths. The same accounts for several of the other

Page 8 of 17

available nematode coronin-1 genes. Given the high conservation of the nematode coronin-1 genes, especially the
Caenorhabditis genes, and the completely uncommon
nature of the potential splice sites, the reported alternative 3’-splice site of exon7 and 5’-splice site of exon8 are
most probably artificial results. An alternative 3’-splice
site has been reported for exon8 of CeCoro1 comprising
two amino acids [35]. Similar splice sites were identified
in the genes of the other analyzed Caenorhabditis species
but not in other nematodes. This splice site is thus also
either an artificial result or specific for the Caenorhabditis branch. In addition, skipping of exon8 has also been
reported to lead to an alternative transcript [35]. The
intron position and reading frame of exon8 of CeCoro1 is
conserved in all analyzed nematode coronin-1’s except
for the Strongyloides rattii coronin-1, which consists of
only one exon, and the Pristionchus pacificus coronin-1,
which has introns at different positions. Compared to the
full-length transcript, the other alternative splice forms of
CeCoro1 are of low abundance (see Figure two in [35]).
Because the integrity of exon8 of CeCoro1 (intron positions around the conserved coding sequence of exon8) is
not conserved in nematodes but the corresponding
amino-acid sequence, alternative splicing of nematode
coronin-1 is either restricted to some sub-branches or an
artificial result of the CeCoro1 analysis.
Alternative splicing of human coronin-1C results in
two additional transcripts derived from alternative transcription start sites encoded by an additional upstream
exon, compared to the normal start site as found and
conserved in all other coronin proteins [36]. These alternative splice forms seem to be restricted to modern primates (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and
gibbon) and have been discussed in detail elsewhere [36].
We have identified alternative splice variants for coronin1D (Figure 5), a coronin subfamily restricted to vertebrates.
A cluster of two mutually exclusively spliced exons, exon5a
and exon5b, was identified in all tetrapods. The amino-acid
sequences corresponding to exon5 of the fish genes are
more similar to exon5b than to exon5a. Thus, exon5a is
the result of an exon duplication event that either occurred
after the separation of tetrapods from fishes or at the onset
of the vertebrates, where exon5a has been lost in the ancestor of the fishes. Exon5 represents the sequence of almost
the entire fourth WD repeat (fifth blade in the b-propeller)

By exchanging the fourth WD repeat the vertebrates could
fine-tune the function of the coronin-1D beta-barrel
domain. Vertebrate coronin-1D (CORO6) has not been
analyzed experimentally yet and its specific function is
unknown.
Further alternative transcripts are derived from mammalian coronin-1D genes by alternative 5’-splicing of the
last exon, exon10. This alternative splicing results in one

Figure 5 Gene structures of alternatively spliced coronins. The cartoons outline the gene structures of the alternatively spliced coronin-1
gene from Caenorhabditis elegans, CeCoro1, and the coronin-1D gene from Homo sapiens, HsCoro1D. The alternatively spliced CeCoro1 gene
contains a differentially included exon8, which has an additional alternative 3’-splice site, leading to three transcripts. The other two described
splice sites, an alternative 3’-splice site of exon7 and an alternative 5’-splice site of exon8 [35], are most probably artificial. The HsCoro1D gene
contains a cluster of two mutually exclusive spliced exons, exon5a and exon5b, and an alternative 5’-splice site of exon10. Dark grey bars and
light grey bars mark exons and introns, respectively, and alternative exons and splice sites are coloured.

additional glutamine residue and is conserved in all 22
analyzed mammalian coronin-1D’s except for Ailuropoda melanoleuca (giant panda), Loxodonta africana
(elephant), Myotis lucifugus (little brown bat), and Bos
taurus (cow).

Oligomerization

Most of the short coronins have predicted coiled-coil
domains at the C-terminus that are the bases for their
supposed oligomerization. Initially, coronins have been
proposed to form dimers [16], the most common form

Eckert et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:268
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/268

of coiled-coil multimerization. In the last decade, a few
coronin homologs were biochemically purified and analyzed. Accordingly, the Xenopus laevis coronin-1C
(XcoroninA) has been shown to form a dimer [37] while
an oligomeric state has been found for human coronin1C (coronin 3; [18], and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
coronin (CRN1) trimerizes [31]. Parallel trimer formation has also been shown in a crystal structure of the
coiled-coil domain of mouse coronin-1A [20] revealing
a conserved motif determining the trimeric structure:
R 1 -[ILVM] 2 -X 3 -X 4 -[ILV] 5 -E 6 . In this motif arginine
forms a salt-bridge with glutamate at the surface of the
coiled-coil structure and the aliphatic side chain moieties of arginine and glutamate pack against the hydrophobic residues at positions 2 and 5 of the motif
shielding them from solvent. Mutation of the arginine
to lysine leads to a concentration-dependent equilibrium
between trimers and tetramers with tetramers forming
at high concentration, while mutation to alanine or norleucine leads to tetramers [20]. Mutation of the invariant arginine to glutamine in the trimerization motif of
human matrilin-1 leads to tetramers [38]. Unfortunately,
the switching of arginine and glutamate in the respective
positions has not been analyzed yet. We would expect
that such a switch should be as stable as the original
motif. Thus, to predict the oligomerization state we
have analyzed all coronin coiled-coil regions for the presence of the trimerization motif. Accordingly, all 233
class-1 coronins have the classical motif, except for
DpCoro1B and DrpCoro1B (Drosophila pseudoobscura
and persimilis; Lys at position 1), and NvCoro1 (Nematostella; Cys at position 2), and are thus predicted to
form trimers. This would include the Xenopus Coro1C
that has, however, been shown to exist as a dimer [37].
The situation is more diverse for the class-2 coronins.
The invertebrate coronins contain the trimerization
motif, except for AmqCoro2 (Amphimedon; Ser at P1),
HerCoro2A (Helobdella; Lys at P1), HerCoro2B (Phe at
P1), MydCoro2 (Mayetiola; Gln at P6), and the nematode class-2 coronins (Cys at P2). Almost all fish class-2
coronins contain the trimerization motif, but the other
vertebrate class-2 coronins have conserved mutations.
The tetrapod class-2A coronins encode a glutamine
instead of the invariant arginine, which would turn
them to tetramers in analogy to matrilin-1 [38]. The tetrapod class-2B coronins contain glutamine instead of
the glutamate at position 6 of the motif, a substitution
whose effect has not been analyzed yet.
About half of the analyzed fungal coronins have the classical trimerization motif. The most common substitutions
that are found in all Schizosaccharomyces and most
Basidiomyota coronins are lysines or glutamines instead of
the arginine at position 1. While the coiled-coil region is
conserved in general, substitutions happened in specific

Page 10 of 17

species but not in whole branches (except for the Schizosaccharomyces). Therefore, we would expect all fungal
coronins to form trimers. All Amoeba coronins, the Stramenopiles coronins (exceptions: FrcCoro a His at P1,
BhCoro_B a Asn at P6, AuaCoro_B a Lys at P1), the
Trichomonas and Naegleria coronins contain the classical
trimerization sequence motif in the coiled-coil region.
Interestingly, the kinetoplastid coronins have the saltbridge switched in the motif and should thus also be able
to form trimers. From the Alveolata, only the Ciliophora
(e.g. Tetrahymena) and Coccidia (e.g. Toxoplasma gondii)
coronins contain coiled-coil domains, and only the Coccidia contain the trimerization motif.
These are, however, predictions based on the existence
of the proposed trimerization motif. The motif has been
identified in 86% of all short, autonomous, and parallel
three-stranded coiled-coils while it is also observed in 9%
of the antiparallel trimers and in 5% of the parallel and
antiparallel dimers [20]. Thus, although most short coronins are predicted to form trimers some might nevertheless function in other oligomeric states in the cell. The
oligomerization state can ultimately only be shown in
experiments, which have, however, been done for just a
few of the coronins yet.
F-actin binding

F-actin binding is one of the common properties of coronin proteins. The extended multiple sequence alignment
presented here together with the recently determined
crystal structure of murine coronin-1A [17] now allows a
reevaluation of previous mutagenesis studies. Truncation
studies have shown that the coronin domain, including
the b-propeller and its C-terminal extension, is necessary
for F-actin binding [30,39]. Mapping the sequence conservation within 13 short coronin members onto the surface of the crystal structure revealed two regions, one
formed by blades 1, 6, and 7 and one formed by blades 6
and 7 and a portion of the C-terminal extension, to
represent possible actin binding sites [17]. Subsequently,
several surface-exposed charged amino acids have been
mutated to alanine or substituted by reversed charges in
human coronin-1B and their F-actin binding affinity has
been analyzed ([40], Figure 6 red dots, see also Additional
file 5). Only the R30D mutation abolished actin binding
in vitro. Although an arginine is the most prevalent
amino acid at this position it is often substituted by a
lysine or a proline (Figure 6). The multiple sequence
alignment of the coronins also does not show a trend
towards a class-specific substitution. For example, while
a proline is found at this position in all vertebrate class-2
coronins, arginines, lysines, asparagines, prolines, threonins, and tyrosins are found in invertebrate class-2 coronins. At least negatively charged amino acids are not
found in any of the coronin domains at this position.

Figure 6 Sequence conservation within the actin binding region. The sequence logos illustrate the sequence conservation within the
multiple sequence alignments of the coronin domains. Here, only the N- and C-termini of the coronin domains are shown because most of the
residues implicated in actin binding map to these regions. For the representation of the entire coronin domain see Additional file 5. For better
orientation, the sequences of three representative coronins are shown: the yeast coronin as the main target of mutagenesis experiments, the
Dictyostelium coronin as the founding member of the protein family, and the murine coronin-1A of which the crystal structure is known.
Secondary structural elements as determined from the crystal structure are drawn as yellow arrows (b-strands) and red boxes (a-helices). Green
dots point to amino acids of ScCoro that have been mutated to alanine [41] and red dots highlight mutagenesis studies in HsCoro1B [40]. Lightblue boxes highlight mutations that abolished actin binding, dark-grey boxes represent mutations that did not influence actin binding, and
light-grey boxes point to mutations in yeast coronins that could not be expressed and tested.

Eckert et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:268
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/268

Recently, systematic mutagenesis of charged surfaceexposed residues of yeast coronin revealed a patch of
residues extending over the top and one side of the
b-propeller that abolished actin binding when mutated to
alanine (Figure 6, green dots [41]). The analysis of the
conservation within the coronin proteins shows that
many of the substitutions in both studies have been performed on marginally conserved residues (e.g. E215A/K,
K216A/E, 1-11, 1-15, 1-16). Thus, it is not surprising that
coronins with mutations of these residues are able to
bind F-actin. As actin binding is one of the common
functions of coronins and actins belong to the highest
conserved protein families the actin binding surface of
the coronins is also expected to be highly conserved.
Most of the residues that were found to abolish actin
binding when mutated to alanine are strongly conserved
(Figure 6). The few residues that are highly conserved
but do not influence actin binding might be interaction
sites for other proteins like cofilin.

Discussion
Here, we have analyzed 723 coronins from 358 species. For
323 species whole genome sequence data was available
allowing a “holistic” analysis of the coronin protein family.
In addition, the whole genome assemblies of 69 species
have been analyzed that in the end did not contain any
coronin homolog. These species include Rhodophyta (Cyanidioschyzon, Galdieria), Viridiplantae, Microsporidia, Formicata (Giardia), and Haptophyceae (Emiliania). A
sequence alignment of the coronin proteins was created
and extensively improved manually. The phylogenetic analysis of the conserved coronin domain, which is also
included in the crystal structure [17], using the Bayesian
method showed that the grouping of the coronins is completely in accordance with the latest phylogeny of the
eukaryotic species (Figure 1, [27-29]). Subsequently, we
analyzed the coronin tree with respect to established and
proposed classifications defining subfamilies. Two major
schemes are currently in use, the old one established by
the HGNC [8] and a more recent one expanding the number of classes from three to twelve [22]. Essentially, the
later classification re-defines subclasses of the HGNC
scheme as separate classes, e.g. 1A and 1B become class-4
and class-1, respectively, and groups some branches to new
classes. However, some coronins still remained unclassified
and several classes have been proposed, like the invertebrate metazoan classes 8 and 9, although the contributing
members did not form monophyletic branches in the
underlying protein family tree. The proposed classes 10
and 12 contain members of unrelated taxonomic branches,
probably because these coronins were adjacent in the tree
figure. In addition, the Entamoeba tandem-coronin did not
group to the other tandem-coronins. Thus, this classification is not consistent with the taxonomy of the eukaryotes.

Page 12 of 17

In addition, homologs of major branches were missing in
the analysis like those from stramenopiles. We do not
intend to add confusion to the classification of the coronin
family but want to suggest a reliable and, considering
future genome sequencing projects, expandable scheme.
Two major reasons support the future use of the HGNC
scheme although it needs some minor adjustments. The
classification by Morgan and Fernandez [22] of coronins
outside the metazoans is not consistent with the latest taxonomy of the eukaryotes and therefore not adaptable to
our more comprehensive coronin tree. In addition, it is
well known that two whole-genome-duplications are the
reason for the expansion of gene homologs at the origin of
the vertebrates [42], while another whole-genome-duplication happened at the origin of the Actinopterygii [43,44].
Thus retaining the orthology between non-vertebrate and
vertebrate coronins in class-numbers would be desirable
but has also been abandoned by Morgan and Fernandez
[22]. Here, we adapted the HGNC classification except for
renaming CORO6 and CORO7 (HGNC) to coronin-1D
and coronin-3, respectively, numbering additional fish coronins as coronin-1E, coronin-2C, and coronin-2D, and
defining the new coronin class-4. The term “class” is
equivalent to the term “Type” used by the Bear group in
recent reviews [8,45]. However, we prefer the term “class”
to be consistent with the terminology used for other protein families (e.g. the myosin family [46,47]) and therefore
to facilitate the work with databases and search engines in
the future.
Class-4 coronins represent a new type of coronins that
are present in Excavata (Naegleria gruberi), Amoebae,
fungi (Spizellomyces punctatus), and the Fungi/Metazoa
incertae sedis branch. Most class-4 coronins consist of the
N-terminal coronin domain followed by two to three PH,
four to five gelsolin, and a C-terminal VHP domain. The
first representative of this subfamily has been identified in
Dictyostelium discoideum and called villidin because of the
homology of its gelsolin and VHP domains to villin [34].
The homology of villidins WD-repeat region to coronin
has been recognized later on [48,49] suggesting villidins
origin through a fusion of the coronin domain with villin.
Villin is the founding member of a superfamily of proteins
containing three to six gelsolin domains (reviewed in
[48,50]). Like villidin (class-4 coronins), villin, supervillin,
and protovillin also contain a C-terminal VHP domain.
Alignment of villin to the class-4 coronins gelsolin domains
shows that the class-4 coronins have lost the first gelsolin
domain of villin. The first gelsolin domain of villin is associated with dimerization, actin filament capping, nucleation, and bundling, and G-actin binding [50]. Thus, class-4
coronins do not play a role in these activities via their
gelsolin domains [34]. However, villin contains three phospholipid-binding domains, two preceding the second gelsolin domain and one overlapping with the VHP domain.

recent phylogenetic analyses, the Alveolata, Rhizaria, and
Stramenopiles form the superfamily SAR [27,54]. The
placement of the Haptophyceae and Cryptophyta to the
SAR is still highly debated. Although several analyses
are in favour to this grouping (arrow 3; [55-57]) most
analyses are in contrast [27-29,53,54]. Short coronins
containing the N-terminal coronin domain and the Cterminal oligomerization domain have been found in all
branches except Diplomonadida, Haptophyceae, and Viridiplantae/Rhodophyta. The phylogenetic grouping of the
species based on the phylogenetic tree of the coronin
domains showed that the coronins with different domain
compositions (containing dUTPase domains, ARP2/3
binding domains, no coiled-coil regions) are speciesspecific developments based on domain loss and gain
events while the corresponding species correctly group
together inside the respective branches. Class-3 coronins
are also found in all major eukaryotic superkingdoms
that contain coronins. We did not identify any species
that contains exclusively a class-3 coronin suggesting
that encoding a class-3 coronin is a plus for the species
but not a necessity. Class-4 coronins were found in two
of the four coronin-containing superkingdoms, the Excavata and the Opisthokonts. Several major sub-branches

These phospholipid-binding domains are conserved in
class-4 coronins and are most probably responsible for
their association with internal membranes like Golgi-structures and ER-membranes [34].
To reveal the evolution of the coronin family and to
determine the coronin repertoire of the last common
ancestor of the eukaryotes, we plotted the coronin inventory of several representative species, whose genome
sequences are available and whose coronin inventories
are therefore complete, on the most widely agreed tree of
the eukaryotes (Figure 7). However, especially the grouping of taxa that emerged close to the origin of the eukaryotes remains highly debated. Therefore, alternative
branchings are also indicated in the tree. The phylogeny
of the supposed supergroup Excavata is the least understood because only a few species of this branch have
been completely sequenced so far. While the grouping of
the Heterolobosea, Trichomonada, and Euglenozoa into
the Excavata is found in most analyses, the grouping of
the Diplomonadida as separate phylum or as part of the
Excavata is still debated (arrow 1 [51]). Also, some analyses group the red algae of the Rhodophyta branch to
the Viridiplantae [52-54] and others support their independence (arrow 2; [28,55]). According to most of the

of the Opisthokonts contain class-4 coronins, the Amoebozoa, the Fungi, and the Fungi/Metazoa incertae sedis
branch. However, the evolution of the class-4 coronins
rather seems to be determined by gene-loss events. This
distribution of the coronin classes demonstrates that the
last common ancestor of the eukaryotes must have contained a short coronin as well as a tandem coronin (class3), and most probably even a class-4 coronin. In the coronin-family tree (Figure 1) the C-terminal coronindomains of the class-3 coronins group closer to the short
coronins than the N-terminal coronin-domains. This
suggests a three-step invention of the class-3 coronin
(Figure 8): First a gene duplication of the short coronin
happened (1). The new copy was subsequently copied
twice but the order of these events could not be determined (2). One copy has been distributed in a different
genomic region resulting in the class-4 coronin after
fusion to a copy of the villin gene (2B). The other copy
resulted in a tandem gene duplicate in which the new
copy was placed at the 5’ site of the original gene (2A).
The tandem gene duplicate subsequently fused to build
the class-3 coronin prototype (3). It could also be possible that the coronin domain copy, which led to the class4 coronin, would have been produced as a copy of the 3’
coronin of the then already existing tandem gene duplicate (4).
At the origin of the Metazoa and Choanoflagellida
branches another gene duplication event led to two distinct
classes, class-1 coronins and class-2 coronins (Figure 7).
The further evolution of the short coronins in the invertebrate branches is determined by species-specific gene-loss

1

and gene-duplication events (Figure 2). This view is, however, based on the species whose genomes are available
today and might change as soon as sequencing of more
related species reveals subtypes of the class-1 and class-2
coronins in major invertebrate branches. At the origin of
the vertebrates the two well-known whole-genome duplications (2R, [42]) resulted in several subtypes of both the
class-1 and class-2 coronins. The subsequent third whole
genome duplication in the fish-lineage [43,44] led to even
more gene duplicates. Subsequent to this boost of coronin
homologs at the onset of the vertebrates branch-specific
gene deletions happened, like the loss of the class-1B variants in fishes and the class-1A loss in birds (Figure 2).
The short coiled-coil region including the trimerization
motif R-[VILM]-X-X-[VIL]-E is an accomplishment of
the most ancient short coronin because it is found in coronins of all branches of the eukaryotic tree. It has been
retained without major mutations for a long evolutionary
time. This is exemplified by the fact that changes, which
might lead to other oligomerization states, are speciesspecific or have been introduced in very recently separated branches.

Conclusions
The phylogenetic tree based on the coronin domains of
723 homologs from 358 species allowed grouping the
coronin proteins into four classes: Class-1 (Type I) and
class-2 (Type II) comprise short coronins and resulted
from a gene duplication of a short coronin at the onset
of the halozoans. Short coronins are characterized by
an N-terminal coronin domain followed by a unique

domain and a C-terminal short coiled-coil region. The
coiled-coil domain of almost all short coronins contains
a trimerization motif that must therefore have already
existed in the last common ancestor of the eukaryotes.
Class-3 (Type III) coronins comprise coronins with two
coronin-domains arranged in tandem and have been
found in species of all eukaryotic kingdoms that contain
coronins. Class-4 (Type IV) coronins encode fusions of
the coronin domain to villin and have been identified in
Excavata and Opisthokonts although most of these species subsequently lost the class-4 homolog. Hence, the
last common ancestor of the eukaryotes must have contained a short coronin and a class-3 coronin, and most
probably a class-4 coronin.

Methods
Identification and annotation of the coronin family
proteins

The coronin genes have been identified by TBLASTN
searches against the sequenced eukaryotic genomes, which
have been obtained via lists available from the diArk database [23,58]. All hits were manually analyzed at the genomic DNA level. Datasets of predicted proteins produced by
the sequencing consortia often miss homologs, and predicted proteins contain mispredicted exons and introns in
many cases, necessitating manual assembly and annotation.
The correct coding sequences were identified with the help
of the multiple sequence alignments of all coronin proteins.
As the amount of protein sequences increased (especially
the number of sequences in taxa with few representatives),
many of the initially predicted sequences were reanalyzed
to correctly identify all exon borders. Where possible, EST
data available from the NCBI EST database has been analyzed to help in the annotation process. In addition, coronin
homologs from cDNA projects or single-gene analyses have
been obtained by TBLASTN searches against the NCBI nr
database [59]. Gene structures have been reconstructed
using WebScipio [25] as far as genomic sequence data was
available. All sequence related data (names, corresponding
species, GenBank ID’s, alternative names, corresponding
publications, domain predictions, gene structure reconstructions, and sequences) and references to genome
sequencing centres are available through CyMoBase
[60,61].

sequences and filling gaps) the alignment has been adjusted
manually. Subsequently, every newly predicted sequence
has been preliminary aligned to its supposed closest relative using ClustalW, the aligned sequence added to the
multiple sequence alignment of the coronins, and the coronin alignment adjusted manually during the subsequent
sequence validation process. We have also retained the
integrity of the primary sequence within the secondary
structural elements that have been determined from
the crystal structure (e.g. sequence gaps have only been
introduced in known loop regions). Still, many gaps in
sequences derived from low-coverage genomes remained.
In those cases, the integrity of the exons surrounding the
gaps has been maintained (gaps in the genomic sequence
are reflected as gaps in the multiple sequence alignment).
The unique and coiled-coil regions are completely divergent in sequence and length and were therefore aligned
manually. The domain compositions of the short coronin,
the class-3, and the class-4 coronins are different and
regions outside the N-terminal coronin domain were only
aligned within these groups. The C-terminal coronin
domains of the class-3 coronins were separately included
in the multiple sequence alignment of the coronins, in
addition to being aligned as part of their class.
Building trees

For calculating phylogenetic trees only full-length and partial sequences were included in the alignment. The phylogenetic trees were generated based on the conserved
coronin domains (corresponding to amino acids 1-386 of
HsCoro1A) using two different methods: 1. Maximum
likelihood (ML) using the LG model with estimated proportion of invariable sites and bootstrapping (1,000 replicates) using RAxML [63]. 2. Posterior probabilities were
generated using MrBayes v3.1.2 [64] with the MPI option
[65]. Two independent runs with 15,000,000 generations,
four chains, and a random starting tree were computed
using the mixed amino-acid option. From the 32,000th
generation MrBayes used the Wag model [66]. Using ProtTest [67], the LG model [68], which is, however, not
implemented in MrBayes, was determined to provide a
slightly better fit to the data than the Wag model. Trees
were sampled every 1,000th generation and the first 25%
of the trees were discarded as “burn-in” before generating
a consensus tree.

Generating the multiple sequence alignment

The multiple sequence alignment of the coronin family has
been built and extended during the process of annotating
and assembling new sequences. The initial alignment has
been generated from the first about 50 non-validated
sequences obtained from NCBI using the ClustalW software with standard settings [62]. During the following correction of the sequences (removing wrongly annotated

Domain and motif prediction

Protein domains were predicted using the SMART [69]
and Pfam [70] web server. The leucine zipper motifs have
been identified using the Prosite database [71]. The CA
domains have been identified by visual inspection of the
manual sequence alignment of the coronins and motif
comparisons with CA domains of WASP family proteins
