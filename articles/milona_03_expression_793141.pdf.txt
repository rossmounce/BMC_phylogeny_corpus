Abstract
Background: Osteogenic and chondrocytic differentiation involves a cascade of coordinated
transcription factor gene expression that regulates proliferation and matrix protein formation in a
defined temporo-spatial manner. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 induces expression of the murine
Osterix/Specificity protein-7 (Sp7) transcription factor that is required for osteoblast
differentiation and bone formation. Regulation of its expression may prove useful for mediating
skeletal repair.
Results: Sp7, the human homologue of the mouse Osterix gene, maps to 12q13.13, close to Sp1
and homeobox gene cluster-C. The first two exons of the 3-exon gene are alternatively spliced,
encoding a 431-residue long protein isoform and an amino-terminus truncated 413-residue short
protein isoform. The human Sp7 protein is a member of the Sp family having 78% identity with Sp1
in the three, Cys2-His2 type, DNA-binding zinc-fingers, but there is little homology elsewhere. The
Sp7 mRNA was expressed in human foetal osteoblasts and craniofacial osteoblasts, chondrocytes
and the osteosarcoma cell lines HOS and MG63, but was not detected in adult femoral osteoblasts.
Generally, the expression of the short (or beta) protein isoform of Sp7 was much higher than the
long (or alpha) protein isoform. No expression of either isoform was found in a panel of other cell
types. However, in tissues, low levels of Sp7 were detected in testis, heart, brain, placenta, lung,
pancreas, ovary and spleen.
Conclusions: Sp7 expression in humans is largely confined to osteoblasts and chondrocytes, both
of which differentiate from the mesenchymal lineage. Of the two protein isoforms, the short
isoform is most abundant.

Background
The osteoblast is the precursor of the osteocyte, the boneforming cell, [1]. The ability to regulate osteoblast proliferation and subsequent differentiation might provide a
useful cell source for tissue engineering and repair [2–4].
The murine transcription factor Osterix is required for

osteoblast differentiation and bone formation since in
Osterix null mice no bone formation occurs [5]. To further elucidate the molecular basis of osteoblast-specific
gene expression and differentiation we examined the
sequence and expression of the human homologue of
Osterix transcription factor, Specificity protein-7 (Sp7).

Osteoblasts express high levels of a number of extracellular matrix proteins such as type α1collagen, type α2(II)
collagen, bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, fibronectin, and
osteocalcin required for mineralization [6,7]. Control of
their expression is regulated by a number of transcription
factors such as runt-related transcription factor-2/core
binding factor alpha1 subunit-1 (Runx2/Cbfa1) [7],
Nmp4 [8], AJ18 [9,10].
The Runx2/Cbfa1 is regarded as the master transcription
factor for osteoblast differentiation since osteoblast differentiation is arrested in both endochondral and intramembranous skeletons in Runx2/Cbfa1 null mice [11–13]. In
these Runx2/Cbfa1 null mice Sp7/Osterix is not
expressed, whereas in Sp7/Osterix null mice Runx2/Cbfa1
is expressed, suggesting that Runx2/Cbfa1 acts upstream
of Sp7/Osterix [5]. During bone development the mineralised cartilage matrix of the endochondral skeletal is
invaded by preosteoblasts derived from mesenchymal
cells. In Sp7/Osterix null mice these Runx2/Cbfa1 positive
preosteoblast cells do not deposit bone matrix and still
express chondrocyte marker genes suggesting that they
have the potential to develop into chondrocyte or osteoblasts. Sp7/Osterix regulates the expression of a number of
important osteoblast genes such as osteocalcin, osteonectin, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein and type I collagen.
Sp7/Osterix was first identified by its induction in the
murine pluripotent myoblast C2C12 cell line stimulated
with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and is similarly upregulated in bone marrow stromal cells and
chondrocytes [4,5,14]. In bone marrow stromal cells from
COX-2 knockout mice Osterix expression is reduced compared to wild-type mice and can be recovered by the addition of prostaglandin E2, indicating that COX-2 mediated
skeletal repair involves Sp7/Osterix [4].

tion. Sp2 shows the lowest level of similarity with the
other Sp proteins, being restricted only to the DNA-binding domain, and binds to the GT-box rather than the GCbox [18]. Sp3 is ubiquitously expressed. However, it is
involved in the control of transcription of a number of tissue-specific genes [20]. Sp3 null mice suffer from a lack of
ossification, impaired bone formation, decrease in the
expression of osteocalcin, an osteoblast specific gene,
being associated with a delay in osteoblast differentiation
[17]. In these mice expression of Runx2/Cbfa1 was not
affected, suggesting that Sp3 is involved in a Runx2/
Cbfa1-independent regulation of osteoblast differentiation. Sp1 and Sp3 may compete for the same GC-boxes as
Sp3 was found to suppress the transcriptional activator
function of Sp1 by binding to Sp1 specific sites [21]. Sp1
and Sp3 are also associated with chondrocyte de-differentiation by regulating the α1(II) procollagen gene
(COL2A1) [22,23]. Type II collagen is a specific marker of
chondrocyte differentiation and chondrocytes can de-differentiate and turn in to osteoarthritic chondrocytes by
reducing the production of type II collagen and increasing
the production of types I and III collagen. Here, Sp1 was
an activator of COL2A1 transcription, whilst Sp3 acted as
a repressor. Sp4, a transcriptional activator, is highly
expressed in tissues of the central nervous system [20].
Sp5 only shares homology with Sp1 in the DNA-binding
domain, binding the GC-box with high affinity and is
expressed during early development, mediating the process of gastrulation and axial elongation [24]. Currently,
only the sequences of human and mouse Sp6 are known
(GenBank accession numbers AK127850 and AK029830
respectively). Here we describe the Sp7 transcription factor, the human homologue of Osterix and identify two
alternatively spliced isoforms.

Results
Sp7 belongs to the Sp subgroup of the Krüppel-like family
of transcription factors (XKLF), that are characterised by a
three zinc-finger DNA-binding domain that is located
towards the carboxy-terminus of the protein [15–17]. In
mammals, 6 other specificity proteins, Sp1-Sp6, have
been identified and characterised to date. Outside the
zinc-finger DNA-binding domain, the homology between
the proteins is much less and often has no significant
homology at all. The Sp proteins contain central activation domains that are often glutamine-rich or serine/threonine-rich [17]. Some genes contain a TATA box in their
promoters that is involved in binding the transcription
factor TFIID and the subsequent initiation of transcription. However, other genes lack a TATA box, and instead
contain another major eukaryotic promoter element, the
GC-box with the consensus sequences GGGCGG [18].
The Specificity protein-1 (Sp1) is a ubiquitously expressed
transcription factor that binds the GC-box [19] and assists
the further binding of TFIID for the initiation of transcrip-

Human Sp7 cDNAs
We cloned two human Sp7 cDNA clones by RT-PCR from
foetal osteoblast RNA and determined their sequence (Fig.
1). The clones differed at their 5' termini utilising two different first exons that are alternatively spliced. Clone 1 utilises exon 1B and encodes the long or alpha protein
isoform of Sp7 (Fig. 1B)(GenBank accession No.
AY150673). Clone 2 utilises exon 1A which is untranslated, and encodes the short or beta protein isoform (Figs.
1A and 2B) (GenBank accession No. AY150674). The first
ATG codon of clone 1 is in excellent sequence consensus
for an initiation methionine having an adenosine at -3
and a guanosine at +4, and that of clone 2 is in good
sequence consensus having a guanosine at -3 [25]. The
sequence of clone 1, encoding the long protein isoform, is
similar to another GenBank clone (accession No.
AF477981, B.W. Ganss, unpublished) which is longer and
contains a potential 3' polyadenylation signal sequence.

Translation of the human Sp7 cDNA sequences
Translation of the human Sp7 cDNA sequences. (A) Sequence of 5' untranslated alternatively spliced exon 1A encoding the
short protein isoform. (B) Sequence encoding long protein isoform. The exon/exon boundaries (shown in blue bold type and
underlined) were determined by comparison with the sequence of genomic DNA clone RP11-147A18. The atg/methionine
start codon for the long protein isoform is shown in bold and coloured red and that of the short protein isoform coloured
pink. The ORF stop codon, tga, is shown in bold and coloured red and is indicated by a red asterisk (*).

Two silent polymorphisms, nucleotides 1098 (agt>agc,
Ser-366) and 1128 (cac>cat, His-376) are present.
Human Sp7 gene
The location and structure of the human Sp7 gene was
identified by blast searches of the human genome using
the two human cDNA sequences Sp7/Osx cDNA. It is
located on genomic DNA clone RP11-147A18 (GenBank
accession No. AC021103, Genome Sequencing Center, St.
Louis, USA). The human Sp7 gene maps to 12q13.13 and
neighbours the Sp1 gene, being 57 kb apart (Fig. 2A).
These two genes are also linked to the homeobox gene
cluster HOX C, being approximately 0.4 Mbp away (Fig.

2A). The human Sp7 gene spans 9.7 kb and lacks a CpG
island, a characteristic of genes that do not have a housekeeping role. It has three exons (Fig. 2B). However, the
first two exons are alternatively spliced, being separated
by the 392 bp intron 1a, followed by the much longer,
6205 bp intron 1b. All splice donor/acceptor sites contained consensus GT/AT dinucleotides. An analysis of the
human Sp7 promoter region identified certain potential
cis-regulatory sites (Fig. 2C) that are conserved in both the
mouse and rat Sp7/Ost promoters (located on mouse
supercontig Mm15_WIFeb01_286, Sanger Centre, U.K.
and rat chromosome 7q35, accession number AC097309,
Human Genome Sequencing Center, Houston, USA).

Chromosomal localisation and gene structure of the human Sp7 gene
Chromosomal localisation and gene structure of the human Sp7 gene. (A) Sp7 localises to 12q13 and the genes neighbouring
Sp7 are the TAR (HIV) RNA binding protein 2, TARBP2; Specificity protein 1, Sp1; Specificity protein 7, Sp7; Aladin, Achalasia,
adrenocortical insufficiency gene, AAAS; ATP5G1; SMUG1 and the HOX C 8–13 genes. (B) The human genomic sequence corresponding to the Sp7 cDNA is located on clone RP11-147A18 (accession AC021103) and has three exons. The ORF is indicated by closed boxes. The sequences around the initiation methionine codons (coloured blue) are shown, with those
nucleotides corresponding to the Kozak consensus sequence coloured red. The stop codon and the double polyadenylation
signal sequence are also shown. The size of the exons and introns are indicated. (C) The promoter region preceding exon 1a
contains an S8 homeobox gene and Runx2/Cbfa1 potential cis-regulatory sites that are conserved in the mouse and rat Sp7
promoters. The promoter region preceding exon 1b contains a potential NF-Y CCAAT box binding site. The potential start of
transcription is labelled TC and that of translation, TL. Positions are labelled relative to the start of translation. The Runx2/
Cbfa1 and NF-Y sites are on the negative strand, (-).

Binding sites for the S8 homeobox gene and core-binding
factor alpha-1 (Cbfa1/Osf2/Runx2) (also called an
osteocalcin-specific element 2, OSE2) are located approximately 90–100 bp upstream of exon 1a. The S8 site is on
the plus strand and partially overlaps with the Runx2/
Cbfa1 site on the negative strand. There is a conserved
inverted CCAAT box, a potential nuclear factor Y (NF-Y)
binding site [26] approximately 115–125 bp upstream of
exon 1b.

Comparison of the human and rodent Sp7 protein
sequences
The ORF of clone 1 encodes the 431 residue alpha protein
with a 44,994 Da molecular mass and an isoelectric point
8.67. The human Sp7 protein is very similar to that of
mouse [5] and rat (accession number BK001412) having
95% identity and 99% similarity, with an insertion of 3
residues in the human amino-terminal (Fig. 3). The ORF
of clone 2 starts at the second ATG of the clone 1, thereby

important for the stability of the fold, and those underlined are likely to bind DNA [28]. These zinc finger motifs
are highly homologous to those present in the Specificity
proteins 1 and 3 and similar to other Krüppel family transcription factors [15,18]. The most similar human protein
to Sp7 is Sp6 (Fig. 4). A basic region, RKK (residues 289–

omitting the first 18 residues and encodes the beta
protein. The beta transcripts are evolutionarily conserved
being found in mouse [27] and rat (accession numbers
BAC36774 and BK001413, respectively). Consistent with
the importance of Sp7 in osteoblast function the Sp7 gene
is also expressed in other vertebrates. Homologous ESTs
from the frog, Xenopus neurula, (accession No. BJ039202)
and Zebrafish, Danio rerio (accession No. BE557403) were
identified by database searches, but invertebrate homologues were not found.
The protein contains three classical zinc finger structures
(residues 294–376) of the Cys2-His2 type where the conserved cysteine residues in two short β-sheets and the histidine residues in an α-helix tetrahedrally co-ordinate a
zinc ion. The amino terminal part of the helix binds the
major groove in DNA binding zinc fingers. These fingers
in Sp7 can be described by the motifs HxCxxxxCxxxYxKxxHLxAHxxxH, FxCxxxxCxxxFxRxxELxRHxxxH and
FxCx--xCxxxFxRxxHLxKHxxxH for fingers 1 to 3 respec-

The protein is glycine and proline rich. The proline rich
region (20% proline, residues 65–249) is involved in
strong transcriptional activation [5]. Apart from the zincfinger domain, the protein lacks any similarity to known
domains. There are two copies of a GSSPL motif of
unknown function at the amino-terminus of the long protein isoform and the short protein isoform possess one
alpha-helix/GSSPL motif.
Tissue and cellular distribution of human Sp7 mRNA
The expression of both long and short isoforms of Sp7 in
osteoblast cell types was examined by RT-PCR using primers specific for each isoform (Fig. 5A). The Sp7 short protein isoform was expressed in foetal and craniofacial
osteoblasts, chondrocytes and the osteosarcoma cell lines
HOS and MG63, but was below the limit of detection in
adult osteoblasts. In general, the expression of the Sp7
long protein isoform was much lower than the short protein isoform, being found in foetal and craniofacial osteoblasts, and the osteosarcoma cell lines HOS and MG63,
but was not found in adult osteoblasts and chondrocytes.
Runx2/Cbfa1 and the housekeeping gene β-actin were
expressed in all osteoblast-like cell types (Fig. 5A).

No expression of either Sp7 isoform was found in a range
of primary and cell lines (data not shown). The cell types
examined were: pulmonary artery smooth muscle, bronchial smooth muscle, pulmonary foetal fibroblasts, pulmonary adult fibroblasts, placental microvascular

The expression of Sp7 in a range of adult tissues was examined by RT-PCR using oligo-dT primed cDNAs. Isoform
specific expression was not detected. However, using
primers located in the 3'UTR that detect both isoforms
expression was found in testis, heart, brain, placenta,
lung, pancreas, ovary and spleen (Fig. 5B). No expression
was detected in liver, muscle, kidney, thymus, prostate,
small intestine, colon and leukocytes. Overall, Sp7 mRNA
expression was very low, since it required a minimum of
40 cycles of amplification to be detected. Using primers

that the cDNAs were free of genomic DNA.

Discussion
We have cloned two human Sp7 cDNAs that are homologues of the murine Osterix transcription factor [5] that
is specifically expressed in all developing bones. As would
be expected for a gene involved in bone development, the
Sp7 gene has a limited phylogenetic distribution being
identified only in mammals, amphibians and teleosts

(bony fish) to date. The long Sp7 protein isoform has
94.7% identity with the murine protein. The Sp7 proteins
share a high degree of homology with other members of
the Sp family in the three zinc-finger DNA-binding
domain. The human Sp7 protein has 78% identity and
89% similarity with human Sp1 protein in the DNA-binding domain, but the two proteins have little homology
elsewhere in their sequences. All those residues in the
three zinc fingers that are important for maintaining the
structure and that contact DNA are conserved between
Sp7 and Sp1, indicating that Sp7 will bind Sp1 DNA consensus sites. Indeed, Osterix/Sp7 bound a consensus Sp1

binding site and Sp1-like sequences in the collagen typeIα1 and collagen type-2α1 promoters [5]. No genetic
bone disease has yet been associated to the Sp7 gene [31].
However, we speculate that abnormal Sp7 binding to the
polymorphic Sp1 binding site in the collagen type I α1
gene promoter [32] may lead to reduced bone density and
osteoporosis.
The human Sp7 gene is separated by 57 kb from the Sp1
gene at chromosomal localisation 12q13.13. This
arrangement is similar in the mouse with the genes being
separated
by
53
kb
on
a
supercontig
(Mm15_WIFeb01_286), on chromosome 15 between the
Wnt10b and Itga5 genes [5] and leads to the suggestion
that the two genes evolved through a duplication event
from a common ancestor. However, they are encoded on
opposite strands and have very different gene structures,
with Sp1 having 6 exons. These two Sp genes are in close
proximity to the HOX-C gene cluster. Colocalization
between Sp genes and HOX gene clusters is a reoccurring
feature of the genome [33]. In humans, Sp2 and Sp6 are
linked to the HOX-B gene cluster located on chromosome
17q21.3-q22 and Sp3 and Sp5 are linked to the HOX-D
gene cluster located on chromosome 2q31.1 and Sp4 is
linked to the HOX A gene cluster located on chromosome
7q21.3-q22. Together, the combination of Sp and homeobox genes may form a genome unit in which transcription of these genes is co-ordinated since they are all
involved in determining the pattern of development.
Both the human and rodent Sp7 genes have a similar
structure, spanning 9.7 kb and having three exons with
the first two exons being alternatively spliced. The two
alternatively spliced human Sp7 cDNAs encode a fulllength protein (alpha or long isoform) and an amino-terminal truncated protein (beta or short isoform) of 431
and 413 residues respectively. This arrangement is also
found in the homologous rodent genes. Alternative
spliced variants are a feature of other members of the Sp/
XKLF family [34]. TIEG, an oestrogen regulated protein in
osteoblasts, has 2 isoforms that are expressed from alternative promoters in a similar manner to Sp7 [35–37]. The
isoforms are called the TGFβ-inducible early gene (TIEG1)
and the early growth response gene-α (TIEG2). TIEG1
possesses an extra 10 residues at its amino-terminus.
Alternative isoforms of other family members may possess different transcriptional properties since different Sp3
isoforms can stimulate or repress transcription [38,39].
We have shown that the relative abundance of the two Sp7
isoforms varies in different cell types. There are some
potential transcription factor binding sites that are conserved in the promoter regions of the human and rodent
Sp7 genes. These may be important in regulating the
expression of the different Sp7 isoforms. Close to the start

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/43

of transcription of the short protein isoform are overlapping S8 homeobox transcription factor and Runx2/Cbfa1,
OSE2 elements [40–42]. The S8 homeobox transcription
factor is involved in mesenchyme-specific pattern
formation in the embryo, and Runx2/Cbfa1 is essential
for osteoblast differentiation [41,43]. In mice, Runx2/
Cbfa1 acts upstream of Sp7 in bone development [5] so
the presence of a conserved OSE2 element suggests that
Runx2/Cbfa1 may directly regulate the expression of the
short protein isoform of Sp7. Runx2/Cbfa1 has two
amino-terminal isoforms which exert different functions
in the process of osteoblast differentiation [13,44,45].
However, the role of these isoforms in regulating Sp7
expression remains to be determined. The presence of a
CCAAT box, a potential NF-Y binding site close to the start
of transcription of the long protein isoform, suggests that
expression of this isoform may be regulated by NF-Y In a
similar manner to the way that bone sialoprotein expression is stimulated by the NF-Y transcription factor [46].
Human Sp7 mRNA expression was limited to cells of the
mesenchymal lineage such as foetal and craniofacial osteoblasts, chondrocytes and the osteosarcoma cell lines
HOS and MG63. Similarly, in mice and rat cell lines Sp7/
osterix expression was found in the preosteoblastic cell
line, MC3T3-E1, but not in fibroblasts, nor plasmacytoma
or pheochromocytoma cells [5]. The expression pattern of
Sp7 supports the idea that this transcription factor plays a
role in both osteoblast differentiation in both endochondral and intramembranous ossification since it was
expressed in foetal osteoblasts and neonatal craniofacial
osteoblasts.
Adult osteoblasts expressed Runx2/Cbfa1, which acts
upstream of Sp7 [5]. However, Sp7 expression was below
the level of detection in these cells. It remains to be
determined whether loss of Sp7 expression is the result of
partial de-differentiation in the in vitro culture conditions
or reflects the situation in aged bone. Adults constantly
remodel bone and a possible consequence of a loss of Sp7
expression in human adult osteoblasts may be a reduction
in bone mineralization. Potential treatments that increase
Sp7 expression may help treat bone-wasting diseases such
as osteoporosis.
Human articular chondrocytes also expressed Runx2/
Cbfa1 and Sp7. In mice embryos, Sp7/osterix is expressed
in young differentiating chondrocytes and germ tooth
mesenchymal cells, but not in condensed chondrogenic
mesenchyme nor in later chondrocytic cells [5]. Rat chondrosarcoma cells were also found to express Sp7/osterix.
This suggests that Sp7 plays a role in chondrocyte differentiation, but not in cartilage matrix deposition.

Osteosarcomas are primary malignant tumours of bone or
soft parts arising from bone-forming mesenchymal cells.
Sp7 was expressed in both the 2 human osteosarcoma cell
lines examined and has previously been found in the rat
osteosarcoma cell line, ROS17/2.8, [5]. Additionally,
amplification of chromosomal region 12q13-15 that contains Sp7 has been noted in various human osteosarcoma
[47,48] suggesting that Sp7 may be involved in neoplastic
disease.

Conclusions
The expression of Sp7 in human primary foetal osteoblast
cells involved in endochondral and intramembranous
ossification is consistent with a role for Sp7 in the coordination of changes in transcription required to generate
bone formation. However, expression of Sp7 in chondrocytes suggests that it also plays a role in cartilage formation. Two different promoters generate two alternatively
spliced isoforms, the proximal promoter generating the
full-length protein and the distal promoter an amino-terminal truncated short protein isoform. Generally, the
short protein isoform was more abundant.

Methods
Cell culture and RNA extraction
Two cell lines derived from osteosarcomas, Hos and MG63, [49,50] were a kind gift from Colin Scotchford (University of Nottingham). They were cultured at 37°C in 5%
CO2 using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, containing 4 mM L-glutamine, 4500 mg glucose/L, 1500 mg
bicarbonate/L (Invitrogen, UK) with the addition of 10%
foetal bovine serum, 10 µM ascorbic acid, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 50 µg/mL streptomycin. Primary human osteoblasts were isolated from trabecular bone of femoral
heads taken during total hip arthroplasty and cultured as
previously described [51]. Primary human craniofacial
osteoblasts were obtained from paediatric skull and cultured as previously described [52]. Human primary foetal
osteoblasts were obtained and cultured as previously
described [53]. Human primary articular chondrocytes
were obtained from isolated femoral heads and cultured
as previously described [54]. Total RNA was extracted
from cells using the SV Total RNA Isolation System,
(Promega, UK). The concentration and purity of eluted
RNA was determined spectrophotometrically and the
quality of the RNA was verified by non-denaturating agarose gel electrophoresis. For Sp7 cloning, total RNA was
reverse transcribed with an oligo-dT primer using ThermoScript, an AMV RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, UK).
Molecular cloning of human Sp7
The mouse Osterix/Sp7 cDNA sequence [5] was used to
search the human genome sequence and the EST database
to identify the human homologue of Sp7. PCR primers

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/43

designed from the sequence of genomic DNA clone RP11147A18 and an EST (accession No. BM687008) was used
to clone two alternative spliced isoforms of the human
Sp7 cDNA by PCR from foetal osteoblast cDNA. The PCR
primers were: forward, long protein isoform A,
TCTCTCCATCTGCCTGG; forward, short protein isoform
B, ACCCGTTGCCTGCACTCTC and common reverse,
CACAATGTTCTCTCCCCAAGCT (Helena Biosciences,
France). RT and PCR were carried out in a thermocycler
(PE Applied Biosystems 2400) using Advantage cDNA
polymerase (Clontech, UK). PCR products were excised
from agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and
eluted from the agarose using a DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, UK). The PCR products were cloned into the T-A vector pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen, The Netherlands).
Transformed colonies were picked and vectors containing
inserts were extracted using the Wizard Plus SV minipreps
DNA purification system (Promega, UK) and sequenced
in both directions as previously described [55].
Tissue and cellular distribution of human Sp7 mRNA by
reverese transcriptase PCR
Human cDNA was analysed for the relative expression of
the Sp7, Runx2/Cbfa1 and β-actin mRNA by real time
PCR. Sixteen adult tissue cDNAs (BD Clontech, UK) were
generated from polyA+ selected RNA and reverese transcribed using an oligo-dT primer. Cell type cDNAs were
generated from total RNA and reverese transcribed using
random hexamers. Approximately 4.0 ng of cDNA from
each tissue, and cDNA derived from 50 ng of total RNA
from each cell type was amplified by PCR using Taq Gold
polymerase. Tissue master mixes were divided into gene
specific mixes with the addition of PCR primers to a final
concentration of 200 µM. The primers were: Sp7 3'UTR,
TTGACTGCAGAGCAGGTTCCT and GCTGCAAGCTCTCCATAACCA producing a 97 bp amplicon; Sp7 forward
primer
for
the
long
protein
isoform,
TCCTCCCTGCTTGAGGAGGA(exon 1b/2); Sp7 forward
primer for the short protein isoform, CAGGTTCCCCCAGGAGGA(exon 1a/2) and common reverse primer, AGTCCCGCAGAGGGCTAGAG (exon 2) producing a 100 and
98 bp amplicons respectively; Runx2/Cbfa1, AGAA6/7)
and
GAGCCAGGCAGGTGCT(exon
TTCGTGGGTTGGAGAAGCG (exon 7) producing a 102
bp amplicon, a measure of the sum of all Runx2/Cbfa1
isoforms, and β-actin, GGCCACGGCTGCTTC and GTTGGCGTACAGGTCTTTGC producing a 208 bp amplicon.
The amplification conditions were; a 10 min hot start to
activate the polymerase followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for
15 sec and 60°C for 1 min. Amplification specificity was
confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and direct
sequencing of the amplicons.
