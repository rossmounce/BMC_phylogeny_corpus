Abstract
Background: Understanding the regulation of the flavonoid pathway is important for maximising the nutritional
value of crop plants and possibly enhancing their resistance towards pathogens. The flavonoid 3’5’-hydroxylase
(F3’5’H) enzyme functions at an important branch point between flavonol and anthocyanin synthesis, as is evident
from studies in petunia (Petunia hybrida), and potato (Solanum tuberosum). The present work involves the
identification and characterisation of a F3’5’H gene from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and the examination of its
putative role in flavonoid metabolism.
Results: The cloned and sequenced tomato F3’5’H gene was named CYP75A31. The gene was inserted into the
pYeDP60 expression vector and the corresponding protein produced in yeast for functional characterisation. Several
putative substrates for F3’5’H were tested in vitro using enzyme assays on microsome preparations. The results
showed that two hydroxylation steps occurred. Expression of the CYP75A31 gene was also tested in vivo, in various
parts of the vegetative tomato plant, along with other key genes of the flavonoid pathway using real-time PCR. A
clear response to nitrogen depletion was shown for CYP75A31 and all other genes tested. The content of rutin and
kaempferol-3-rutinoside was found to increase as a response to nitrogen depletion in most parts of the plant,
however the growth conditions used in this study did not lead to accumulation of anthocyanins.
Conclusions: CYP75A31 (NCBI accession number GQ904194), encodes a flavonoid 3’5’-hydroxylase, which accepts
flavones, flavanones, dihydroflavonols and flavonols as substrates. The expression of the CYP75A31 gene was found
to increase in response to nitrogen deprivation, in accordance with other genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway,
as expected for a gene involved in flavonoid metabolism.

Background
Flavonoids are plant secondary metabolites. They have
a wide range of functions such as (a) providing pigmentation to flowers, fruits, and seeds in order to
attract pollinators and seed dispersers, (b) protecting
against ultraviolet light, (c) providing defence against
phytopathogens (pathogenic microorganisms, insects,
animals), (d) playing a role in plant fertility and germination of pollen and (e) acting as signal molecules in
plant-microbe interactions [1,2]. Flavonoids receive a
lot of attention due to their possible effects on human

health. Many flavonoids display antioxidant activity
that confers beneficial effects on coronary heart disease, cancer, and allergies [3,4]. Reports also suggest
that some of the biological effects of anthocyanins and
flavonols may be related to their ability to modulate
mammalian cell signalling pathways [5,6]. Enhancing
the production of flavonoids in crop plants can therefore give an important boost to their nutritional value,
which makes knowledge of expression and regulation
of the flavonoid pathway important. Flavonoids constitute a relatively diverse family of aromatic molecules
that are derived from phenylalanine and malonyl-coenzyme A. Most of the bright red and blue colours found
in higher plants are due to anthocyanins. Anthocyanin
biosynthesis has been studied extensively in several

plant species and detailed information on the pathway
is available [7-9]. Information on substrate flow and
regulation through the branch point between flavonol
and anthocyanin synthesis is however not fully elucidated, and for tomato the enzymes acting in the
branch point have not been extensively characterised.
Experiments with expression of the snapdragon transcription factor genes Delila, a basic-helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) transcription factor, and Rosea1, a R2R3 MYBtype transcription factor, showed that F3’5’H expression is necessary for activation of anthocyanin synthesis in tomatoes [10]. Introduction of these
transcription factors under control of the fruit-specific
E8 promoter increased the expression of most of the
structural genes in the biosynthetic pathway in the
tomato fruit, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase
(PAL), chalcone isomerase (CHI) and F3’5’H. PAL
insures high flux into the phenylpropanoid pathway,
whereas CHI and F3’5’H are essential for addressing
the flux towards flavonoids in general and anthocyanin
production specifically. The activity of CHI is normally
low in the tomato skin, leading to accumulation of
naringenin-chalcone in the skin of wild type tomatoes
[11]. The cytochrome P450 dependent flavonoid
hydroxylases introduce either one (flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase, F3’H) or two (F3’5’H) of the hydroxyl groups
on the B ring of the flavonoid skeleton [7,12]. The
F3’5’H belongs to the CYP75 superfamily of P450
enzymes [13,14]. These enzymes are anchored to the
surface of the endoplasmic reticulum via their hydrophobic N- terminal end. Only plants that express the
F3’5’H gene are capable of producing blue flowers, as
these are dependent on 5’-hydroxylated anthocyanins.
F3’5’-hydroxylases are previously known from other
plants, such as Petunia hybrida (petunia), Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle), Vitis vinifera
(grape), Campanula medium (Canterbury bells), Solanum tuberosum (potato) and Solanum melongena (eggplant), among others. To be active P450 enzymes need
to be coupled to an electron donor. This can either be
a cytochrome P450 reductase or cytochrome b5 . The
reductase will also be anchored to the surface of the
endoplasmic reticulum via its N- or C-terminus [13].
Kaltenbach et al. [15] isolated the F3’5’H gene from C.
roseus using heterologous screening with the CYP75
Hf1 cDNA from P. hybrida [16]. Both the C. roseus
gene, named CYP75A8, and the petunia Hf1 were
expressed in E. coli and found to accept flavones, flavanones, dihydroflavonols and flavonols as substrates,
and both performed 3’- and 3’5’-hydroxylation. The
genes encoding F3’5’H in grape have been shown to be
expressed in different parts of the grape plant that
accumulate flavonoids, especially in the skin of

ripening berries where the highest levels of anthocyanins are synthesized [17].
Several genes in the flavonoid pathway display differences in substrate specificity or preference in various
plant species. Petunia dihydroflavonol 4-reductase
(DFR), for instance, does not utilize dihydrokaempferol
[18]. Arabidopsis DFR converts dihydroquercetin into
leuco-cyanidin, but will use dihydrokaempferol when
dihydroquercetin is not available, e.g. in plants lacing
functional F3’H enzyme [19]. This is because the plants
lacking F3’H activity cannot produce dihydroquercetin
(fig 1). So far there is not much information on F3’5’H
substrate specificity. Available data [15,20] generally
confirm the same substrates, without reporting negative
results for other substrates tested. However, Tanaka et
al. [20] reported that the petunia Hf2 cDNA expressed
in a yeast system did not accept apigenin as substrate.
Kaltenbach et al. did, however, show that the petunia
Hf1 can accept apigenin as substrate, when expressed in
an E. coli system [15].
F3’5’H competes with flavonol synthase (FLS) for the
substrates dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin (Figure 1). The preferred substrate for DFR in the tomato
plant is dihydromyricetin [21], which can be produced
from dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin by
F3’5’H. This is the first step in the branch leading to
anthocyanins (delphinidin type), which are normally
only found in the vegetative tissues of tomato. According to Bovy et al. [21] tomato FLS prefers dihydroquercetin and dihydrokaempferol as substrates, and does not
use dihydromyricetin, hence DFR and FLS do not compete for the same substrate. Nevertheless FLS can still
deplete the flow of substrate towards DFR by using
dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin as they precede dihydromyricetin in the synthesis pathway. F3’H
might also compete with FLS and F3’5’H for dihydrokaempferol, although it is unclear, as the enzyme has
not been characterised from tomato so far. The activities
of FLS, F3’5’H, DFR, and possibly F3’H, hence regulate
the distribution between flavonols and anthocyanins in
tomato plants. As a consequence, F3’5’H can be a bottleneck in this system as DFR relies on its activity to
proceed the synthesis towards anthocyanins. Bovy et al.
[11] has shown that silencing of the FLS gene leads to
more anthocyanins in vegetative tomato tissue. Introduction of an FLS RNAi construct into tomato plants
led to decreased levels of quercetin-3-rutinoside (rutin)
in tomato peel, and to accumulation of anthocyanins in
leaves, stems and flower buds. This indicates that less
competition from flavonol synthesis will enhance the
flux towards anthocyanins by allowing more substrate
for DFR. In this study we cloned, sequenced and characterised the F3’5’H enzyme, which produces substrate for

DFR in tomato. Accumulation of flavonoids, and distribution of products through the different branches of the
flavonoid pathway, has previously been shown to be
influenced by nitrogen supply [22,23]. An agricultural
plant like tomato is typically given nitrogen through fertilization; hence the level of nitrogen available to the
plant can be monitored. It is, therefore, important to
elucidate the effects nitrogen has on expression of genes
and accumulation of compounds, such as flavonoids.
Extensive knowledge on the branch-point enzyme

F3’5’H is crucial for understanding the distribution of
flow through the flavonoid pathway, potentially enabling
manipulation of desired end-product accumulation in
fruits and vegetables in response to growth conditions.

Results
Sequence analysis

The CYP75A31 gene was isolated using sequence
homology with a potato F3’5’H and 3’ RACE to identify
the 3’ end of the gene. A tomato EST sequence found in

the TIGR database was assumed to be the 5’ end of the
gene (accession number DB723744), and primers based
on these sequences led to isolation of the cDNA and
DNA sequences for CYP75A31. The 3133 bp gene
sequence (Figure 2) consists of three exons (gray), which
is consistent with what is previously reported for potato,
petunia and soybean [24,25]. A Blast search (NCBI) performed with the coding sequence revealed 94% identity
to a S. tuberosum, 88% identity to a S. melongena and
84% identity to a P. hybrida F3’5’H sequence.
Phylogenetic analysis

The phylogenetic tree (Figure 3) was made using protein
sequences from several plant F3’5’H enzymes retrieved
from the NCBI web page. The tree clearly visualises that
CYP75A31 is most closely related to the F3’5’H enzymes
of the Solanum species potato and eggplant.
CYP75A31 Substrate Specificity

The coding sequence of the CYP75A31 gene was transformed into yeast for heterologous expression. Enzyme
assays were run on isolated microsome fractions, substrates and products were analysed by HPLC and MS.
The substrates found to be metabolized by CYP75A31
are listed in table 1. Luteolin (5,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxyflavone) gave tricetin (5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentahydroxyflavone) as
the only product. Naringenin (5,7,4’-trihydroxyflavanone) gave rice to two peaks in the HPLC-spectrum
identified as eriodictyol (5,7,3’,4’-tetrahydroxyflavanone),
and 5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentahydroxyflavanone. As expected,
eriodictyol as substrate gave only one product,
5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentahydroxyflavanone. Dihydrokaempferol
(3,5,7,4’-tetrahydroxyflavanone) gave two peaks, dihydroquercetin (3,5,7,3’,4’-pentahydroxyflavanone), and dihydromyricetin (3,5,7,3’,4’,5’-hexahydroxyflavanone).
Dihydroquercetin as substrate gave one product, as
expected, identified as dihydromyricetin. Kaempferol
(3,5,7,4’-tetrahydroxyflavone) resulted in two peaks,
identified as quercetin (3,5,7,3’,4’-pentahydroxyflavone)
and myricetin (3,5,7,3’,4’,5’-hexahydroxyflavone). Quercetin as substrate gave myricetin as the only product,
and liquiritigenin (7,4’-dihydroxyflavanone) gave two
products: butin (7,3’,4’-trihydroxyflavanone) and
7,3’,4’,5’-tetrahydroxyflavanone. Neither the control reactions without NADPH, nor assays with microsomes isolated from yeast transformed with pYeDP60 vector
lacking an insertion, showed any product formation.
Gene expression

Tomato plants were grown on rock-wool with complete
nutrient supply under continuous light. The rock-wool

was rinsed with water to remove previous nutrient solution, and plants were randomly divided in two batches.
One batch continued with complete nutrient solution,
whereas the second batch received nutrient solution
with no nitrogen. Samples were harvested before change
of nutrients (day 0) and again after three days. Gene
expression was measured by real-time PCR, using the
shoot top (young tissue, e.g. shoot apex with primordia
and developing leaves, including first unfolded still small
leaf) on day 0 as calibrator. Relative expression of all
genes is hence given as a fold change related to the
shoot top sample taken on day 0. Expression of the
F3’5’H gene, six other structural genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway and transcription factors anthocyanin 1
(ANT1) and SlJAF13 (which is a putative homolog to
the petunia JAF13 gene [26]) was tested by real-time
PCR. All nine genes showed a general increase in
response to nitrogen deprivation (Figure 4a-i). Averaged
over all parts of the plant the expression of chalcone
synthase 2 (CHS2), F3’H, PAL5, FLS, F3’5’H, DFR,
SlJAF13 and ANT1 on day 3 was 22.0, 19.6, 16.2, 15.7,
13.3, 8.9, 8.9 and 8.0 fold higher, respectively, in nitrogen deprived plants as compared to plants given full
nutrient solution. At day 3, flavanone 3-hydroxylase
(F3H) (Figure 4c) showed detectable expression only for
nitrogen deprived plants, which overall was 20 fold
higher than on day 0. F3H is the only gene with no
detectable transcripts in plants receiving nitrogen on
day 3; the reason for this is unknown. All of the genes,
with the exception of F3’H (Figure 4d), showed highest
expression in nitrogen depleted leaflets (from 5 th leaf
from the hypocotyl) on day 3. For F3’H the highest
expression was found in nitrogen depleted petioles
(from 5th leaf from the hypocotyl). The nitrogen effect
in leaflets was especially high for F3’5’H (Figure 4e).
PAL5 (Figure 4a) showed a clear increase in response to
nitrogen deprivation, also in roots. SlJAFF13 (Figure 4i)
showed a clear nitrogen effect in all plant parts tested,
as did ANT1 (Figure 4h). Expression of CHS2 (Figure
4b) displayed a convincing nitrogen effect in shoot top,
petiole, leaflets and stalk (of the whole plant). DFR (Figure 4g) was expressed in much the same way as CHS2
but showed a slightly higher increase in relative expression in the leaflets, and lower in the shoot top of nitrogen deprived plants. Expression of FLS (Figure 4f) was
clearly elevated in all parts of nitrogen deprived plants
while the level remained relatively stable in plants
receiving nitrogen.

Phenolic content

Measurements of phenolic content were conducted on
the same samples as the expression analysis. Rutin was
detected in all samples, except roots at day 0. In all
parts of the plant the content had increased from day 0
to day 3 and was clearly higher in nitrogen deprived
plants (Figure 5a). The overall content of rutin in nitrogen deprived plants on day 3 was 1.9 times higher than
in nitrogen replete plants. Kaempferol-3-rutinoside was
not detected in samples from stalk or root, and only in
nitrogen deprived leaflets. In the shoot top and petiole
there was a clear increase from day 0 to day 3, especially
in nitrogen depleted plants (fig 5b). The overall content
of kaempferol-3-rutinoside in nitrogen deprived plants

on day 3 was 2.3 times higher than in nitrogen replete
plants. Anthocyanins were not detectable in any samples
under the growth conditions used.

Discussion
When starting the in vitro enzyme assays, substrates
were chosen based on previous findings on accepted
substrates for F3’5’H enzymes from other plants. Substrates were also chosen based on structural similarity
to these compounds. With the exception of liquiritigenin, substrates found to be metabolized by CYP75A31
were also found to be metabolized by CYP75A8, which
was previously isolated from C. roseus [15]. The Kaltenbach group also tested a petunia F3’5’H in the E. coli

expression system used for CYP75A8, and found that
the petunia F3’5’H accepted the same substrates.
Whereas the C. roseus F3’5’H had highest activity with
apigenin, the petunia F3’5’H had highest activity with
naringenin [15]. For the CYP75A31 enzyme there was a
clear preference for naringenin and liquiritigenin, as
these substrates were metabolised also in dilute microsome preparations. In the present study, CYP75A8 was
also expressed in the same yeast (expression) system as
CYP75A31. K m for naringenin was measured to 1.20
μM for CYP75A31, and 0.83 μM for CYP75A8. Kaltenbach et al. [15] reported an apparent K m of 7 μM for
naringenin when expressing CYP75A8 in the E. coli
expression system. The rate of hydroxylation performed
by a F3’5’H enzyme is dependent on the reductase used
in the expression system. De Vetten et al. [27] has
shown that a cytochrome b5 is required for full activity
of F3’5’H in petunia. The gene encoding a cytochrome
b5 was inactivated by targeted transposon mutagenesis,
which resulted in reduced F3’5’H activity and reduced
accumulation of 5’-substituted anthocyanins, leading to
an alteration in flower colour. Our expression studies
utilized the Arabidopsis ATR1 reductase, whereas in the
expression studies performed by Kaltenbach et al. [15], a
C. roseus P450 reductase was used in the E. coli expression system. The use of different expression systems,
and reductases, may explain the difference in Km values
obtained for the C. roseus CYP75A8 enzyme in the two
studies [28].
Liquiritigenin has to our knowledge not been shown
to be metabolized by a F3’5’H enzyme previously.
Liquiritigenin in plants is mostly associated with the
legumes, which have a CHI capable of isomerising 6’hydroxy- and 6’-deoxychalcones to 5-hydroxy- and 5-

deoxyflavanones respectively. Joung et al. [29] reported
that the tobacco CHI is able to isomerise the 6’-deoxychalcone isoliquiritigenin to the 5-deoxyflavanone,
liquiritigenin, in transgenic tobacco over-expressing a
Pueraria montana chalcone reductase gene. Tanaka et
al. [20] showed that the F3’5’H from Gentiana triflora
catalysed the hydroxylation of naringenin to eriodictyol,
eriodictyol to 5, 7, 3’, 4’, 5’-pentahydroxyflavanone, dihydrokaempferol to dihydroquercetin, dihydroquercetin to
dihydromyricetin and apigenin to luteolin when
expressed in S. cerevisiae under the control of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. The reaction rates and substrate preferences recorded in bacteria
or yeast expression systems do not necessarily represent
the actual rate or preference in planta. As demonstrated
in this study, the tomato F3’5’H is capable of metabolizing liquiritigenin, although to our knowledge liquiritigenin has never been found in tomato plants.
Expression analysis showed that all the major genes of
the flavonoid pathway tested, including F3’5’H, had a
clear increase in expression as a result of three days of
nitrogen deprivation (Figure 4). Despite what seemed to
be a general up-regulation of the flavonoid pathway in
this study, the growth conditions applied had not
resulted in accumulation of anthocyanins at the time of
sampling. At the time of sampling, the increase in gene
expression was more prominent than the increase in
level of rutin and kaempferol-3-rutinoside. As gene
expression increases prior to accumulation of product
this implies that accumulation of rutin and kaempferol3-rutinoside had not yet reached the maximum. Similar
studies (unpublished results) conducted on nitrogen
deprived tomato plants have shown that also anthocyanins will appear over time. Possibly the concentrations

Figure 4 Expression analysis by real-time PCR. Relative expression of genes in the flavonoid pathway in various parts of the tomato plant.
Tomato plants were grown for 25 days on rock-wool with complete nutrient supply under continuous light. The rock-wool was rinsed with
water to remove previous nutrient solution, and plants were randomly divided in two batches. Half the plants continued with complete nutrient
solution, whereas the other half received nutrient solution with no nitrogen. Samples were taken before change of nutrients (day 0) and again
after three days. One biological sample was pooled from 3 different plants. Relative expression is given as a fold change related to the sample

of dihydrokaempferol and/or dihydroquercetin have to
exceed a threshold level for F3’5’H to metabolise what
FLS does not have capacity for. Similar studies [30]
showed far higher levels of flavonol-derivatives than in
the present study at the time of anthocyanin accumulation, which might indicate that FLS does not have the
capacity to metabolise all the dihydrokaempferol/dihydroquercetin as the flow through the pathway escalates.
The increase in transcripts of F3’H in all parts of the

nitrogen deprived plants, indicates increased production
of the F3’H enzyme, which hydroxylates dihydrokaempferol to dihydroquercetin. The action of this enzyme,
(together with F3’5’H), might explain why the content of
rutin is much higher than kaempferol-3-rutinoside,
since they have dihydroquercetin and dihydrokaempferol
as precursors respectively. It should be mentioned that

Figure 5 Accumulation of flavonoids. Accumulation of flavonoids in vegetative parts of tomato plants was determined by HPLC using
standards. Tomato plants were grown for 25 days on rock-wool with complete nutrient supply under continuous light. The rock-wool was
rinsed with water to remove previous nutrient solution, and plants were randomly divided in two batches. Half the plants continued with
complete nutrient solution, whereas the other half received nutrient solution with no nitrogen. Samples were taken before change of nutrients
(day 0) and again after three days. One biological sample was pooled from 3 different plants. Three analytical replicates were run for each
sample; standard error was less than 1%. Accumulation of a) rutin and b) kaempferol-3-rutinoside is given as μg/g fresh weight (FW).

cloned and characterised, hence its function still needs
to be established. This is especially relevant considering
that the F3’5’H present in tomato is also capable of catalysing the 3’-hydroxylation.
A similar study [30] showed accumulation of anthocyanins in leaves of nitrogen deprived tomato plants. In
this study the nitrogen deprivation lasted a minimum of
four days, and flavonoid content continued to increase
from the fourth to the eighth day of nitrogen
deprivation.
Consistent with the increase in rutin and kaempferol3-rutinoside, the enzyme responsible for increasing flux
into the phenylpropanoid pathway, PAL5 increased in
expression as a response to nitrogen deprivation. The
MYB-type transcription factor ANT1, and the putative
bHLH transcription factor SlJAF13, also increased in all
parts of nitrogen deprived plants. This is consistent with
the general increase in all the flavonoid structural genes
tested, and the increase in flavonoid content.

an important branch point in the regulation between
flavonol and anthocyanin synthesis. Expression of the
CYP75A31 gene increased in response to nitrogen deprivation, in accordance with other genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is an expected response to
abiotic stress in plants.

Methods
Plant Material

Suzanne F1 seeds were sown on rock wool and given
Hoagland nutrient solution containing 15 mM NO 3 [31]. RNA and DNA used to identify coding sequence
and introns of the F3’5’H gene was isolated from plants
grown in a 12 h light/dark regimen. Expression and
metabolite analysis were performed on plants grown in
continuous light, and given complete Hoagland solution
before shifted to a nitrogen deprived regimen where
KNO 3 was replaced by KCl and Ca(NO 3 ) 2 :4H 2 O was
replaced by CaCl2.
Identifying the F3’5’H gene

Conclusions
The sequenced gene, CYP75A31, encodes a flavonoid
3’5’-hydroxylase which accepts luteolin, naringenin, eriodictyol, dihydrokaempferol, dihydroquercetin, kaempferol, quercetin and liquiritigenin as substrates. The
ability to do 3’- and especially 5’-hydroxylation of intermediates in the flavonoid pathway places CYP75A31 at

RNA was isolated from leaves of the cherry tomato
Suzanne F1 using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen,
USA). To identify the 3’end of the F3’5’H gene the GeneRacer™ Kit (Invitrogen, USA) was used. The gene specific left primer used for the 3’ end had the sequence
ACAAGGATGGGAATAGTGATGGT and was based
on a F3’5’H sequence for Solanum tuberosum (accession

number: AY675558). The cDNA amplified was
sequenced, and a nucleotide BLAST against the GeneBank (NCBI) showed close similarity to other F3’5’H
sequences. An EST sequence was found in the TIGR
database (accession number DB723744) which was
assumed to be the 5’ end of the gene. Based on the
obtained sequences for 3’ and 5’ ends, new primers covering the entire gene were made. The 3’ sequence was
used to make the primer 75ALerevECO (GGAATTCTCAGCAACGATAAACGTCCAAAGATAG) with an
additional EcoRI site for the 3’ end of the gene. The 5’
end primer, 75ALedirBAM (GGGATCCATGGCGTTACGTATTAATGAGTTATTT), includes an additional
BamHI site.
cDNA for cloning was made using the SuperScript™ III
First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen). The ORF of CYP75A31 was amplified by PCR
introducing BamHI/EcoRI rectriction sites upstream of
the start ATG and downstream to the stop codon TGA
using Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity
(Invitrogen). PCR program was as follows: 95°C for 5
min, followed by 5 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 40°C for 1
min and 72°C for 1.5 min. Then 35 cycles of 95°C for
30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 1.5 min. At the end
there was an extra 5 min elongation at 72°C before cooling to 4°C. The product was ligated into a TOPO vector
using the pCR® 8/GW/TOPO® TA Cloning® Kit (Invitrogen) as recommended. The ligated vector was transformed into OneShot® Chemically Competent E. coli
(Invitrogen) and grown on LB-media containing spectinomycin. Several individual colonies were picked and
grown to amplify and isolate the plasmids for sequencing. The obtained sequences were subjected to a
BLAST search, and were shown to display significant
similarities to F3’5’H genes isolated from other species.
Expression Constructs

CYP75A31 was cut from the TOPO vector using BamHIand EcoRI, then ligated into the pYeDP60 vector [32]
for expression in yeast.
Yeast Expression and microsome preparation

The yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae WAT11, engineered to over-express the P450 reductase isoform
ATR1 from Arabidopsis thaliana when induced with
galactose [32], was used for the expression. Transformation with the pYeDP60 expression construct was performed as previously described by Gietz et al. [33].
Propagation of yeast cells and preparation of microsomes was done as described by Pompon et al. [32] with
some modifications. Liquid SGlu, 50 ml, was inoculated
by a single colony from a SGlu plate and grown at 30°C
for 48 h. The culture was then transferred to 200 ml
YPGlu medium, containing 20 g/l glucose, and grown at
30°C for 24 h. The yeast cells were spun down (2000 ×
g, 3 min) and re-suspended in YPGal medium

containing 20 g/l galactose for induction of microsomes
at 16°C for 24 h. Microsomes were isolated in the following way: The yeast culture was centrifuged (2 000 ×
g, 10 min) and the pellet re-suspended in 50 ml TEK
(100 mM KCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl with 1 mM EDTA),
centrifuged at 6 100 × g for 3 min and the pellet re-suspended in 2 ml extraction buffer (20 mM b-mercaptethanol, 1% BSA and 0.6 M sorbitol in 50 mM TrisHCl with 1 mM EDTA). Glass beads were added, and
the suspension was shaken in an automatic shaker
(Retsch MM200 Mixer Mill, Krackeler Scientific, USA)
4 × 2 min at a vibration frequency of 30. Between two
shaking cycles the suspension was placed on ice for 3
min. Portions of 10 ml extraction buffer was added to
the beads 4 times, shaken and decanted to retrieve the
microsomes. Extraction buffer was centrifuged for 15
min at 6 100 × g, the supernatant was filtered, and
MgCl 2 added to a final concentration of 50 mM in
order to precipitate the microsomes [34]. The suspension was placed on ice for approximately 1 h before centrifugation at 12 500 × g for 20 min. The pellet was
dissolved in 1.0 to 1.5 ml TEG (30% glycerol in 50 mM
Tris-HCl with 1 mM EDTA) and homogenized using a
Teflon pestle. Work was carried out on ice, all buffers/
solutions and centrifuge were pre-cooled to 4°C.
CYP75A31 Enzyme assays

Several compounds were tested as potential substrates
for CYP75A31. Microsomes isolated from yeast
CYP75A31 transformants were incubated in 0.1 M
sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 containing 1.0 mM
NADPH, or without NADPH (as a negative control).
The assay mixture was equilibrated for 2 min at 27°C
prior to starting the reaction by addition of microsomes.
Concentration of substrate in the assays ranged between
20 to 100 μM. Total volume of assay was 200 μl. After
10 to 30 min the reaction was stopped by adding 75 μl
of acetonitrile/concentrated HCl (99:1). Precipitated proteins were removed by a 10 min centrifugation (9300 ×
g); the supernatant was used directly for HPLC and MS
analysis to assess product formation and substrate consumption. To validate that hydroxylations occurred due
to CYP75A31 activity, assays were run with a microsome preparation made from WAT11 transformed with
the pYeDP60 vector without any insertions.
Real-Time PCR

Plants were sown on rock-wool and grown at 22°C for
25 days with full Hoagland nutrient solution, in continuous light (approximately 200 μmolm -2 s -1 PAR).
The rock-wool was rinsed thoroughly with tap water
to remove nutrients, before adding nutrient solution
deprived of nitrogen (referred to as day 0). The following samples were taken from three plants and pooled
to one sample (for each part of the plant): shoot top
(young tissue, e.g. shoot apex with primordia and

developing leaves, including first unfolded still small
leaf), petiole (from the 5 th leaf from the hypocotyl),
leaflets (from the 5 th leaf from the hypocotyl), stem
(the whole stem of the plant) and roots (efforts were
made to retrieve as much of the root as possible, but
some finer parts were lost in the rock wool). The tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
-80°C before ground into powder in liquid nitrogen
(samples for RNA and phenolic analysis were taken
from the same powder). Samples were pooled from
three plants receiving nitrogen and three plants
deprived of nitrogen at day three. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA was
quantified by spectrophotometer and cDNA synthesised using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit
(Applied Biosystems, USA) (concentration of RNA in
the reaction tube was 10 μg mL -1 ). Real-time PCR
reactions were assayed using an ABI 7300 Fast RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with SybrGreen for detection. The reaction volume was 20 μL
containing 10 μl qPCR Master Mix (PrimerDesign,
UK), 0.3 μM primer (forward and reverse) and 1 μl
cDNA. Standard cycling conditions (2 min at 50°C, 10
min at 95°C and 40 cycles altering between 15 s at 95°
C and 1 min at 60°C) were used for product formation.

average of the reference genes ubiqutin and elongation
factor 1a [35] in the qBaseplus software [36], using the
shoot top harvested at day 0 as calibrator. Thus, relative quantity of any gene is given as fold change relative to day 0.
Flavonoid standards

Naringenin, dihydroquercetin, kaempferol and quercetin
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Liquiritigenin
was obtained from Extrasynthèse (France). Luteolin,
eriodictyol and dihydrokaempferol were obtained from
TransMIT (Germany).

HPLC and MS analysis
Analysis of enzyme substrates and products

The flavonoids were analysed on a HPLC system (LC
20AD, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) equipped with a
C18 LichroCART 125-4 column (Merck, Germany) connected to a diode array detector (SPD M20A, Shimadzu
Corporation). Substrates and products separations were
done using a solvent system of (A) 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid
in water and (B) methanol:acetonitril (1:1). The column
was equilibrated in solvent A at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/
min for 5 min, and the elution was performed using a
linear gradient of solvent B from 0 to 67% for 25 min,
followed by 100% B for an additional 5 min. Detection
was made on a wavelength range of 220-400 nm. Injection volume was 50 μl.
Mass spectrometric analyses

The HPLC-MS system comprised the binary solvent
delivery pump (Surveyor MS, ThermoFinnigan, USA)
connected to a diode array detector (Surveyor PDA
plus, ThermoFinningan) and a linear ion trap mass
spectrometer (LTQ-MS, ThermoFinnigan). Products
separation was done as described in the above paragraph. LTQ equipped with an atmospheric pressure
ionization interface operating in ESI mode. Data were
processed using LCQuan software (version 2.0). Computer was controlled by Xcalibur 1.4 software. The operational parameters of the mass spectrometer were as
shown below. The spray voltage was 5 kV and the temperature of the heated capillary was set at 200°C. The
flow rates of sheath gas, auxiliary gas, and sweep gas
were set (in arbitrary units min-1) to 50, 10, and 10,
respectively. Capillary voltage was +20/-20V (positive/
negative polarity), tube lens was +65/-65V (positive/
negative polarity) and the front lens was +5/-5V (positive/negative polarity).
Characterisation of product formation

The products eriodictyol, dihydroquercetin and quercetin were identified using HPLC-standards, and MS
(table 1). Triecetin, 5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentahydroxyflavanone,
dihydromyricetin and myricetin were identified by MS
(table 1). Absorbance maximum for substrates and products are given in Additional file 1. Structure for substrates and products are given in Additional file 2.
Analysis of flavonoids in vegetative parts of the tomato
plant

Samples of approximately 100 mg were extracted in 1
ml of 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in methanol,
and analyzed by use of a liquid chromatograph (Agilent
1100-system, Agilent Technologies, Norway) supplied
with a photodiode array detector. Separation was
achieved on an Eclipse XDB-C8 (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm)
column (Agilent Technologies) by use of a binary solvent system consisting of (A) 0.05% TFA in water and
(B) 0.05% TFA in acetonitrile. The gradient (%B in A)

Olsen et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/21

was linear from 5 to 10 in 5 min, from 10 to 25 for the
next 5 min, from 25 to 85 in 6 min, from 85 to 5 in 2
min, and finally recondition of the column by 5% in 2
min. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min, 10 μl samples were
injected on the column, and separation took place at 30°
C. Detection was made over the interval 230-600 nm in
steps of 2 nm in order to obtain full absorbance spectrum of the compounds of interest. Peak characterization was done in accordance to previous results [37,38].
Quantitative levels of the rutinosides of kaempferol and
quercetin, the major flavonoids in tomato seedlings,
were calculated as peak areas obtained at 370 nm compared to the responses of authentic samples (rutin and
kaempferol-3-rutinoside, provided by PlantChem, Norway). All results were corrected against the exact weight
of the sample. One biological sample, pooled from three
individual plants, was analyzed. Three analytical replicates were done for each sample; standard error was
less than 1%.
Phylogenetic analysis

Protein sequences of previously published F3’5’H
enzymes were obtained from the NCBI home page
(accession numbers are given in the phylogenetic tree,
figure 3). The phylogenetic analysis was done using the
default settings of ClustalX (1.83).
