Gene duplication in the genome of parasitic
Giardia lamblia
Jun Sun1,2†, Huifeng Jiang1,3†, Roberto Flores3, Jianfan Wen1*

Abstract
Background: Giardia are a group of widespread intestinal protozoan parasites in a number of vertebrates. Much
evidence from G. lamblia indicated they might be the most primitive extant eukaryotes. When and how such a
group of the earliest branching unicellular eukaryotes developed the ability to successfully parasitize the latest
branching higher eukaryotes (vertebrates) is an intriguing question. Gene duplication has long been thought to be
the most common mechanism in the production of primary resources for the origin of evolutionary novelties. In
order to parse the evolutionary trajectory of Giardia parasitic lifestyle, here we carried out a genome-wide analysis
about gene duplication patterns in G. lamblia.
Results: Although genomic comparison showed that in G. lamblia the contents of many fundamental biologic
pathways are simplified and the whole genome is very compact, in our study 40% of its genes were identified as
duplicated genes. Evolutionary distance analyses of these duplicated genes indicated two rounds of large scale
duplication events had occurred in G. lamblia genome. Functional annotation of them further showed that the
majority of recent duplicated genes are VSPs (Variant-specific Surface Proteins), which are essential for the
successful parasitic life of Giardia in hosts. Based on evolutionary comparison with their hosts, it was found that the
rapid expansion of VSPs in G. lamblia is consistent with the evolutionary radiation of placental mammals.
Conclusions: Based on the genome-wide analysis of duplicated genes in G. lamblia, we found that gene
duplication was essential for the origin and evolution of Giardia parasitic lifestyle. The recent expansion of VSPs
uniquely occurring in G. lamblia is consistent with the increment of its hosts. Therefore we proposed a hypothesis
that the increment of Giradia hosts might be the driving force for the rapid expansion of VSPs.

Background
Giardia are a group of flagellated unicellular protists
which are the most common infective parasites of a
number of vertebrates. For example, G. lamblia is a
common human parasite. In the United States, about
20,000 cases of giardisis are reported each year [1].
Aside from being a prevalent pathogen, in the last two
decades G. lamblia has caught a lot of attentions, as
being the most primitive eukaryotes [2]. Phylogenetic
and cellular evidence indicate that this organism might
branch away from the ancestor of extant eukaryotes
around the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria in
eukaryotes [2-5]. Therefore before the emergence of

multicellular animals, G. lamblia may have survived
freely in the world for several hundred million years [6].
It suggested that later on it developed the ability to successfully parasitize vertebrates, as it is now recognized
as one of the most prevalent intestinal parasites in a
variety of vertebrates from amphibians to mammals [7].
An intriguing question is how this ancient eukaryote
became an obligate parasite in the later multicellular
animals. The draft genome sequence of G. lamblia provides us an opportunity to uncover what genomic features resulted in its parasitic lifestyle [8].
Comprehension of how the parasitic ability developed
would not only be of evolutionary biological significance, but also shed light on the mechanism of giardisis.
Genetic novelties emerge in organisms by creation of
new genes through three major mechanisms: de novo
creation, lateral gene transfer and gene duplication

is impossible to detect because of the deficiency of close
relatives in the lineage. Lateral gene transfer (LGT),
which is a predominant force of acquisition of new
genes in many microorganisms [11], may play an important role for the adaptive evolution of G. lamblia in animal intestines because half of the 15 LGT genes
identified are associated with its surveillance in an anaerobic environment [12]. However, gene duplication,
which has long been thought to be the primary mechanism in producing resources for the origin of evolutionary novelties, has not yet been thoroughly studied in G.
lamblia. The most obvious contribution of gene duplication to organisms is that it provides genetic material
to generate neo-function or sub-function while maintaining the original function of duplicated genes [9,13].
Moreover, the generation of duplicated genes can
increase genetic robustness within cellular networks
[14]. The dynamic evolution of duplicated genes inflects
adaptive evolution of organisms under varying environments [15,16]. Therefore there is no doubt that gene
duplication is extremely pervasive, conducting function
in almost all organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes
[9,13].
Previously, many studies on fungi, plants and animals
have shown that gene duplication contributes novelties
for their adaptive evolution [17-21]. In order to investigate the impact of gene duplication on the parasitic lifestyle of G. lamblia, we surveyed and depicted the
evolutionary relationships of all the duplicated genes in
its genome. Our results showed that two rounds of large
scale duplication events took place in the evolutionary
process of G. lamblia. Furthermore, most of the recent
duplicated genes in the second round duplication events
are VSP genes, which are essential for the parasitic
properties of G. lamblia that utilizes them to evade the
host’s immune response [22]. Largely expanded VSP
genes are helpful to parasitize a variety of hosts, because
they allow G. lamblia to enact a more complex regulation of VSPs in different hosts and at different times
[23-25].

of proteins in G. lamblia, we detected 2,403 duplication
genes which cover about 40% of the total proteins in G.
lamblia. Duplicated genes usually can be classified into
tandem, segmental and dispersed duplicates. According
to the location of duplicated genes in the assembled
contigs, we found only 23 tandem duplicated genes
whose original gene and duplicated copy are tandemly
located on the same contig. Additionally eight genes
were involved in segmental duplication events, which
resulted in two or more duplicated genes located in the
same contig (Additional file 1: The list of 2,403 duplicated genes). These results imply that the majority of
duplication events happened dispersedly.
In order to further analyze the evolutionary scenario
of these duplication events, subsequently, a cluster analysis was done based on sequence divergence of the
duplicated genes. Briefly, we constructed a matrix with
2,403 rows and columns where each represented a
duplicated gene. The amino acid similarities for each
gene pair in the row and column were then extracted
from the BLASTP results. Based on this matrix, a hierarchical clustering was conducted by the program
AGNES (agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms) where proteins are clustered closer if their protein sequences have higher similarity (Materials and
Methods) [27]. Interestingly, as shown in figure 1,
roughly 30% of the duplicated genes were classified into
two large duplicated groups: 235 genes in Group I and
500 genes in Group II. The rest of the 1,668 genes
formed many small gene groups. A control dataset
which contains these 1,668 genes (Group III) was also
constructed, in order to see if the evolutionary pattern
of the two large groups is different from these small
groups. Comparison of average similarities among genes
in the three groups showed that the average similarity
for genes from Group I (35.26 ± 0.09) is significantly
higher than those from Group II (31.32 ± 0.02) and III
(29.03 ± 0.18). This implies perhaps the majority of
duplication events in Group I took place more recently
than those in Groups II and III did.

Results
Identification of Gene duplication events in G. lamblia

Two rounds of large scale duplication events happened
in G. lamblia

Gene duplication and subsequent divergence of the
duplicated copies provide opportunities to generate neofunction for adaptive evolution of organisms in varying
environments. Identification of duplicated genes is valuable to understand the adaptive evolution of organisms.
In order to identify all putative gene duplication events
in G. lamblia, a very ancient organism which have survived in the world for several billion years [6], a global
survey of protein similarities was conducted using the
BLASTP program with loose parameters (E-value < 104
) [26]. After all-against-all alignments for the entirety

In order to further clarify the evolutionary order of the
duplication events in each group, we defined the best
hit for each duplicated gene as its direct parental gene
(Materials and Methods). Due to a large divergence in
sequence, it is impossible to detect the parental genes
for some ancient duplicated genes. Fortunately, we identified 1,907 pairs of parent-daughter relationships
among all duplicated genes in G. lamblia, but the rest
of the 496 duplicated genes lacked detectable parental
genes. To gauge the evolutionary distances for each parent-daughter pair, we used non-synonymous distance

(dN) and synonymous distance (dS) [28,29] (See Additional file 1 for the list of dN and dS value for all duplicated pairs). As shown in figure 2A, most genes in
Group I were created very recently compared with the
genes in Group II and III. For example 56% of the genes
in Group I have dS smaller than 1, whereas the genes
with such a low dS in Group II and III are only 11%
and 17%, respectively. Thus, more than half of the
duplicated genes in Group I were originated recently.
Since the larger dS values for most duplicated genes in
Group II and Group III might result from reverse mutations at synonymous sites, the evolutionary distances for
a large number of duplicated genes in Group II and III
cann’t only be based on dS. As a result, we turned to
dN.
Although positive selection would accelerate nonsynonymous mutation rate in a short period, in the long
term, especially for duplicated genes in Group II and III
with such a large divergence, dN is possible to use as an
index of evolutionary time. Therefore we used dN to
characterize the duplication events within the three
groups. Unexpectedly, the distribution of dN values for
the totality of duplicated genes clearly shows that there
were two rounds of gene duplication events in the genome of G. lamblia (Figure 2B): the first round of duplication events that were mainly enriched in Groups II
and III happened earlier, while the second round of
events focusing on Group I occurred very recently. Larger dN values in Groups II and III maybe the result of
functional relaxation of the genes within both groups.
However functional relaxation of genes in Groups II and
III is not enough to explain why the dN values in both

groups are higher than those in Group I, due to no significant difference between their dN/dS ratio (P-value of
t-test is 0.5 between dN/dS from Group I and II and
0.15 between Group I and III). Based on the distribution
of dN values, we arbitrarily defined two types of duplicated genes in each group: recent duplicated gene
(RDG) with dN < 0.5 and ancient duplicated gene
(ADG) with dN > 0.5. Thus 68.5% of the genes in
Group I belongs to RDG. This proportion is much
higher than those in Group II (13.4%) and III (16.5%).
Therefore no matter what methods we utilize, duplicated genes in Group I seem much younger than those
in Groups II and III.
Recently duplicated genes in G. lamblia are significantly
biased towards VSP genes

The current adaptation of an organism relies on recent
genomic contents. We are interested in testing if the
recently duplicated genes in Group I are related to the
parasitic life in G. lamblia. In order to do this, we first
annotated functional domains for duplicated genes in
each group using the Pfam database (Materials and
methods). For the two large duplicated gene groups,
86% of the duplicated genes in Group I were annotated
as VSP function, while in Group II 72% of the genes
were annotated as Ank function and 27% as Pkinase
(See Additional file 1 for functional domain annotation).
As we mentioned above, more recent duplication genes
are rich in Group I than those in Group II and III. By
counting RDG and ADG in each group, we found that
in Group II more than 80% of Ank genes and Pkinase
belong to ADG, while 74% VSP genes belong to RDG in
Group I.
Secondly, in order to study the functional distribution
of duplicated genes in detail we clustered all proteins
from G. lamblia into different gene families by TribeMCL [30]. We checked the proportion of RDG and
ADG in each gene family to see if functional bias
occurred between RDG and ADG. As shown in figure 3,
functional bias between RDG and ADG is obvious in
most of the gene families (here only families with more
than 4 members were listed, Additional file 2 listed the
ratio of RDG and ADG in each gene family). Many gene
families with important functions had been duplicated
long before such as: the Ank domain which possibly
plays roles for localization in cells, the Pkinase which
may be functional in signal transduction and protein
degradation. Interestingly, two types of motor proteins
(Kinesin and Dynein) were also significantly enriched in
the ADG. It may be possible that such an enrichment of
motor proteins were related to the earlier adaptation of
G. lamblia, which moved in water by its flagella [31,32].
In addition, six out of the nine gene families enriched in
RDG were annotated as hypothesis proteins and the

additional three families were Ank, Copine and VSP.
Although Ank function is also enriched in RDG, there
are only four members in the family, as well as in
Copine. It was noticed that six gene families were annotated as hypothesis proteins. Further functional studies
of these families would provide more valuable insights
into the recently adaptive evolution of G. liamblia. Most
of the VSPs were created very recently, which is consentient with our results above. Many studies have shown
that VSPs play a profound role in antigenic variation of
G. lamblia, which expresses only one of the VSP genes
at a particular time and spontaneously switches to varying VSP genes every 6-13 generations [23]. Therefore
numerous duplications of VSPs are indispensable for G.
lamblia to be able to infect a variety of hosts.
The rapid expansion of VSPs in G. lamblia may be
consistent with the evolutionary radiation of placental
mammals

Evolutionary arms-race is an important driving force for
the adaptive evolution [33-35]. The most important
thing for a successful parasite in this race is to develop
a mechanism to allow antigenic variation to escape
arrest from the host immune system. VSPs are an essential gene family in G. lamblia to carry out antigenic variation. Therefore, we asked if the rapid expansion of
VSPs in G. lamblia is associated with the evolution of
its hosts. Comparison of the evolution rate of VSPs in
G. lamblia with the divergence of its hosts may provide
us some valuable insights. As the host range of Giardia
extends from amphibians to mammals, we identified

orthologous relationships for all proteins from human to
mouse, platypus and fish by InParanoid [36]. We constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the VSP homologs
(Materia and Methods. Additional file 3: the phylogenetic tree). Based on amino acid similarities, we found
that about 60% of VSPs have higher amino acid similarities than the VSP homologs in human and platypus,
while 78% of VSPs have higher amino acid similarities
between VSP homologs in human and fish.
Many recent duplicated genes underwent positive
selection, which would accelerate the evolutionary rate
of proteins [37]. dS is presumably considered to be neutral during evolutionary process [37,38]. Thus, we compared the dS values of VSPs with the synonymous
substitution rates of orthologous genes from fish to
human. As shown in figure 4, about half of the VSPs
have smaller dS values than the average dS values of
orthologs between human and mouse, and approximately 80% of such duplicated genes have a dS value
smaller than the average dS between human and platypus. Although the evolutionary rates in unicellular
organisms is more rapid than multi-cellular organisms,
for the reason that unicellular organisms usually have
shorter generation time, it would be conservative to
conclude that VSPs were rapidly expanded in G. lamblia
after the period in which platypus separated from the
ancestor of human and mouse. This time scale is almost
consistent with the evolutionary radiation of placental
mammals [39-41]. Therefore, it is available to propose a
hypothesis that the increment of Giardia hosts is the
driving force for the rapid expansion of VSPs.

Discussion
Gene duplication is one of important mechanisms to
provide neo-function for adaptive evolution. Systematic
surveys of gene duplication in the intestinal parasite G.
lamblia provided much more information than what we
had previously expected. Although many biological
machines in G. lamblia are considerably compact [8],
more than 40% of the genes in G. lamblia were identified as duplicated genes in our analysis. This proportion
of duplicated genes is similar with those in fly and yeast
using the same parameters for BLASTP [42]. Interestingly, we found that a large number of duplicated genes
were focused within two large duplicated groups.
Further analysis of the two large duplicated groups indicated that there were two rounds of large scale gene
duplication events in the evolutionary process of G.
lamblia. Based on dN values of identified duplication
genes, the first round of duplication events happened a
long time ago. Due to the extended time of divergence
among these duplicated genes, dS and even dN values
would be saturated by mutations. Therefore, perhaps
the accumulation of ancient duplication genes might
result from a saturation of mutations at non-synonymous sites. However, the dS for most of the genes
from the second round duplication events have a relatively small dS value (< 1), which could fall short of the
saturation of mutations [29] (Additional file 4: the distribution of dS for the ancient and recent duplicated
genes). Gene conversion would also result in very high
similarities among duplicated genes [37]. Nevertheless,
based on current knowledge, the mechanism for gene
conversion is still unresolved in G. lamblia [43]. Thus,

these recent duplication events might be authentic and
correspond to the adaptive evolution in G. lamblia.
Antigenic variation is an essential mechanism allowing
parasitic pathogens to escape from arrest of the host
immune system. G. lamblia performs this variation by
changing the expression of its VSP genes in a variety of
hosts at different time points [23,24,44-46]. Our results
showed that 74% of the genes in the second round of
duplication are VSP genes. Furthermore, in comparison
with other parasitic protists, we found that VSP genes
expanded independently in G. lamblia genome (Additional file 5: gene number in each family in the five studies parasitic protists), even when considering its very
close relative Spironucleus salmonicida [40]. A probable
explanation for the recently rapid expansion of VSP
genes in the genome of G. lamblia is that the dramatic
expansion was driven by the selection of evasion from
the host immune systems. Since most of the hosts for
G. lamblia are animals, we analyzed the possible relationships between the evolution of VSPs and the evolutionary rates for orthologous genes from fish to human.
Given the shorter generation time in unicellular organisms compared to the multi-cellular organisms, we
inferred that at least VSP genes became expanded in G.
lamblia after the separation of platypus from the ancestor of placental mammals. At the same time species in
mammals also expanded after the divergence from platypus [39-41]. Our results indicate an interesting co-evolution pattern for the parasitic G. lamblia in mammals’
evolutionary processes. Further, analysis at the genomic
level would shed more lights on the understanding of
the co-evolution between the parasite and hosts.

Duplicated genes in G. lamblia

with orthologs among animals. The red curve represents
distribution of dS of orthologs between Human and Mouse; the
green curve denotes distribution of dS of orthologs between
Human and Platypus; the blue one displays distribution of dS of
orthologs between Human and Zebrafish. The black curve is the
cumulative distribution of VSP genes in G. lamblia.

Conclusion
Gene duplication always plays a pivotal role for the adaptive evolution of organisms under changing environments.
Although G. lamblia is one of the most primitive eukaryotes, the origin of its parasitic lifestyle is not as long as
it’s surveillance. Global identification of duplicated genes
in the genome of G. lamblia indicated that gene duplication was essential for the origin and evolution of its parasitic lifestyle. Our results advocated that the recent
expansion of VSPs uniquely took place in G. lamblia.
Comparison of the evolution of VSPs with the divergence
of its hosts indicated that the rapid expansion of VSPs is
consistent with the increment of its hosts. Therefore we
proposed a hypothesis that the increment of Giardia hosts
is the driving force for the rapid expansion of VSPs.
Methods
Sequence data

Protein sequences for all ORF in Giardia lamblia [Gla]
were downloaded from GiardiaDB database [47]. Perl
script was used to filter overlapped ORF which has 80%
overlap on the same strand in a contig with another
longer ORF. Finally, 5,986 ORFs were used to do analysis. Protein sequences for protists Cryptosporidium parvum [Cpa], Entamoeba histolytica [Ehi], Leishmania
major [Lma] and Plasmodium falciparum [Pfa] were
downloaded from NCBI database [48]. Protein
sequences for Human, Mouse, Platypus and Zebrafish
were downloaded from Ensembl [49].

In order to detect all possible duplicated genes in G.
lamblia, all-against-all blast search for 5,986 studied
proteins in G. lamblia were done by BLASTP program
with a loose parameter E-value < 10-4 . 2,403 proteins
which have significant hits with another protein were
defined as duplicated genes. The rest (3,583 genes) are
single genes. Protein identities between each duplicated
pair were used to do cluster analysis by agglomerative
hierarchical clustering algorithms (AGNES) in R cluster
package. Briefly, a symmetric matrix with 2,403 rows
(each one represents a duplicated gene) and 2,403 columns was constructed. And then the amino acid similarities for each gene pair in the row and column were
extracted from the BLASTP results. Based on this
matrix, we used average method in AGNES to do cluster. Proteins will be clustered closer if they have higher
protein similarities. Group I and Group II were defined
based on the cluster results. Apart from Group I and II,
the rest of the proteins were put together as Group III.
Evolutionary distance of duplicated genes

In order to estimate evolutionary distance of duplicated
genes, we used a reverse-searching method to identify a
putative parental gene for each duplicated gene. Briefly,
based on BLASTP results, the duplicated pairs with the
highest similarity were selected from all of duplicated
pairs. For the two copies in each duplicated pair, if the
first copy has higher similarities with other genes than
the second copy, the first copy would be defined as parental gene for the second copy. After this, the defined
daughter gene was removed from all duplicated pairs.
Then we iterated this process until we can not find
daughter gene at all. Finally, we identified 1,906 duplicated pairs with parental-daughter relationships. The
software YN00 in the package PAML was used to estimate the synonymous distance (dS) and non-synonymous distance (dN) for each of the duplicated pairs
with parental-daughter relationships[29].
Functional domain annotation and Gene family
identification

Functional domains for all of the duplicated genes have
been detected based on the Pfam database. The
sequences for duplicated genes were used as queries to
search the Pfam_fs database by the hmmpfam program
in the HMMER package 2.3.2 [50]. The cut-off for the
search was chosen at E-value < 0.1 according to the
advice of the author for HMMER. Finally 1,767 genes
were annotated as containing the known functional
domain, 636 genes do not contain the known functional
domain and were annotated as Hypothesis proteins. In
order to study gene family expansion in G. lamblia,
Tribe-MCL was used to do family classification among

Sun et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:49

G. lamblia and other four parasitic protists (Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, Leishmania major
and Plasmodium falciparum).
Comparative evolution analysis of VSPs

Initially using human genes as queries, we identified all
orthologous relationships of genes in human with genes
in mouse, platypus and zebrafish. Synonymous substitution rates of one-to-one orthologs were used to estimate
divergence among these species. The software YN00 in
the package PAML was used to estimate the synonymous distance (dS) for all orthologous pairs [29]. The
best hit of VSPs in human, mouse, platypus and zebrafish were identified as VSPs homologs. Then the VSPs
gene and its homologs were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. All protein sequences were aligned by
MUSCLE [51]. The tree was constructed by Clustalw2
after alignment [52].
