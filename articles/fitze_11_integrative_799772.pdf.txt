Abstract
Background: Genetic, phenotypic and ecological divergence within a lineage is the result of past and ongoing
evolutionary processes, which lead ultimately to diversification and speciation. Integrative analyses allow linking
diversification to geological, climatic, and ecological events, and thus disentangling the relative importance of
different evolutionary drivers in generating and maintaining current species richness.
Results: Here, we use phylogenetic, phenotypic, geographic, and environmental data to investigate diversification
in the Spanish sand racer (Psammodromus hispanicus). Phylogenetic, molecular clock dating, and phenotypic
analyses show that P. hispanicus consists of three lineages. One lineage from Western Spain diverged 8.3 (2.9-14.7)
Mya from the ancestor of Psammodromus hispanicus edwardsianus and P. hispanicus hispanicus Central lineage. The
latter diverged 4.8 (1.5-8.7) Mya. Molecular clock dating, together with population genetic analyses, indicate that
the three lineages experienced northward range expansions from southern Iberian refugia during Pleistocene
glacial periods. Ecological niche modelling shows that suitable habitat of the Western lineage and P. h.
edwardsianus overlap over vast areas, but that a barrier may hinder dispersal and genetic mixing of populations of
both lineages. P. h. hispanicus Central lineage inhabits an ecological niche that overlaps marginally with the other
two lineages.
Conclusions: Our results provide evidence for divergence in allopatry and niche conservatism between the
Western lineage and the ancestor of P. h. edwardsianus and P. h. hispanicus Central lineage, whereas they suggest
that niche divergence is involved in the origin of the latter two lineages. Both processes were temporally
separated and may be responsible for the here documented genetic and phenotypic diversity of P. hispanicus. The
temporal pattern is in line with those proposed for other animal lineages. It suggests that geographic isolation and
vicariance played an important role in the early diversification of the group, and that lineage diversification was
further amplified through ecological divergence.

Background
Species diversity emerges from the combination of both
past and ongoing evolutionary and ecological processes
driving speciation [1-3]. However, it is challenging to
determine the relative contributions of historical and
ecological factors in causing genetic differentiation [4].
The traditional classification of modes of speciation

a spatial context [5,6] is currently revisited in the light
of recent studies that integrate phylogenetic, ecological,
and geographical data [3,7,8]. In the last decade, evolutionary biologists have focused on discerning the
mechanisms leading to reproductive isolation, and the
field has witnessed major advances in determining the
relative contribution of historical geographic barriers to
diversification thanks to the possibility of linking geological and phylogenetic data [9]. In contrast, the elucidation of the contribution to diversification of
ecologically-based divergent selection due to environmental differences has been hindered until recently by

the difficulty of simultaneously gathering genetic, phenotypic, and environmental data within the framework
of a single study [3]. However, the recent accumulation
of environmental data and the development of ecological niche modelling allow overcoming these limitations
and provide the basis for an integrative approach that
combines phylogenetic and biogeographic data in order
to explain the origin and large-scale distribution patterns of biodiversity [9]. Integrative analyses provide
new insights on the factors driving diversification and
speciation, and allow disentangling the effects of environment from those of historical barriers [8-12]. In particular, it is possible to test explicitly whether diversity
can evolve in allopatry and under similar ecological conditions (i.e. niche conservatism; [2]) or whether different
ecological environments (i.e. niche divergence) that promote divergent natural selection are at the root of diversification [13,14].
Here, we integrate phylogenetic, phenotypic, geographic, and environmental data to investigate the contributions of historical geographic barriers and
environmental differences to speciation and divergence
in the Spanish sand racer (Psammodromus hispanicus).
The current distribution of P. hispanicus includes the
Iberian Peninsula, and the French Mediterranean coast
with an upper altitudinal limit at 1700 m a.s.l. [15]. The
broad distribution of this group, which inhabits regions
with very distinct habitats as well as areas with complex
geological histories, makes it a suitable model to investigate how vicariant events due to geographical barriers
and niche divergence due to selection have influenced
diversification. P. hispanicus Fitzinger, 1826 consists of
two subspecies, namely P. hispanicus hispanicus Fitzinger, 1826 and P. hispanicus edwardsianus (Dugès, 1829).
The Iberian Peninsula hosts a second species of the
same genus, P. algirus (Linnaeus, 1758), consisting of
two divergent Eastern (E) and Western lineages, the latter including African, as well as Northwestern (NW)
and Southwestern (SW) Iberian clades [16]. Other species of the genus Psammodromus are P. blanci (Lataste,
1880) from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, and P.
microdactylus (Boettger, 1881) endemic to Morocco.
Based on a representative sampling of P. hispanicus in
Spain, we first reconstructed phylogenetic relationships
among sampled populations using both mitochondrial
(mt) and nuclear markers, and dated major cladogenetic
events, comparing patterns observed in P. hispanicus
with those of P. algirus. Second, we investigated differences between molecular lineages in phenotypic traits
using multivariate analyses. Third, we performed ecological niche modelling and applied different procedures
to assess niche divergence and the spatial structure of
shared environmental conditions among lineages, in
order to investigated the evolutionary and ecological

processes that promoted genetic and phenotypic differentiation in the Spanish sand racer. More specifically,
we tested whether niche divergence and/or allopatric
speciation may explain the observed diversity. Under the
niche divergence hypothesis we predicted that two closely related taxonomic groups would live in habitats
characterized by different environmental conditions.
Under the allopatric speciation hypothesis we predicted
genetic, but not necessarily ecological divergence, and
thus that environmental niches of sister species should
be more similar than under ecological speciation.
Finally, we speculate which geological events may have
led to the observed diversity.

Results
Phylogenetic Relationships within Psammodromus

Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial (mt) cytochrome b (cytb) data set were based on a 249 bp alignment with 89 variable positions and 82 parsimonyinformative sites. The maximum likelihood (ML) reconstructed tree is shown in Figure 1. The Bayesian inference (BI) tree recovered identical internal nodes to the
ML tree and differed only in the arrangement of terminal nodes, which did not receive strong statistical support in either analysis. Two nuclear loci (suppressor of
SWI4 1 and clone 17) were included in the nuclear data
set. Phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear data set were
based on a 1,168 bp alignment with 135 variable positions, and 88 parsimony-informative sites. The ML and
BI reconstructed trees were identical in topology to each
other (and with respect to the mt trees) regarding internal nodes, and differed in the arrangement of terminal
nodes (results not shown). Phylogenetic analyses of the
combined data set, which included mt cytb, mt nad4
and the two nuclear loci, were based on a 2,014 bp
alignment with 417 variable positions, and 354 parsimony-informative sites. The ML reconstructed tree is
shown in Figure 2. The BI tree was identical in topology
to the ML tree regarding internal nodes and differed
only in the arrangement of terminal nodes, which did
not receive strong statistical support in either analysis.
All recovered trees (based on the mt, nuclear, and
combined data sets) indicated that P. hispanicus and P.
algirus form two sister clades. Bayesian relaxed clock
dating using the combined dataset estimated the split at
approximately 17.25 ± 0.36 Mya ± SE (Figure 3). The
recovered trees support the split of P. algirus into at
least two main clades, which separated around 3.01 ±
0.07 Mya (Figures 1, 2, and 3). One of the clades represented the Eastern lineage (Figures 1, 2, and 3). The
other clades included P. algirus from Morocco, and the
Southwestern (SW) and Northwestern (NW) clades.
These latter two clades were identified based on a
NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (nad4)-phylogenetic

and the P. hispanicus hispanicus Central lineage (hereafter referred to as Central lineage) + P. hispanicus
edwardsianus lineage (hereafter referred to as edwardsianus lineage). The split between the Central lineage
and the edwardsianus lineage was dated 4.78 (1.5-8.7)
Mya (Figures 1, 2, and 3). The monophyly of both the
Central lineage and the edwardsianus lineage received
strong statistical support in all phylogenetic analyses
(Figures 1 and 2). The two mt and the two nuclear
minimum-spanning networks support the existence of
three independent lineages (Figure 5).
Within the Western lineage southern populations
(Huelva) formed a paraphyletic assemblage with respect
to northern populations. Within the edwardsianus lineage, southern populations (Granada and Almería) were
recovered as the sister group of the northern populations (Figures 1 and 2). The southern-northern splits
received strong statistical support in the combined analyses, and were further supported by statistically significant differences in the AMOVA (Table 1). While in the
Western lineage and edwardsianus lineage most of the
genetic variation was found among northern and southern groups, there was significant variation among populations and within groups in the edwardsianus lineage
(Table 1). The main split within the Central lineage had
no clear geographical correlation (all specimens recovered in the smaller clade belonged to populations where
specimens belonging to the bigger clade were captured;
Figures 1 and 2).
The spatial distribution of mt cytochrome b (cytb)
(Figure 5a), mt nad4 (Figure 5b), nuclear suppressor of
SWI4 1 (Figure 5c) and nuclear clone 17 diversity (Figure 5d) showed current allopatry for the three main

lineages recognized within P. hispanicus. There were
statistically significant differences in the longitudinal distribution between the three lineages (F2,18 = 18.216, P <
0.001, all post-hoc contrasts were significant P < 0.05),
but no differences in the latitudinal distribution (F2,18 =
0.519, P = 0.603). The edwardsianus lineage inhabits the
eastern part of Spain (longitude: -1.153 ± 0.816 °, range:
-3.7° - 3.2°), the Central lineage inhabits the central part
(longitude: -3.057 ± 0.418 °, range: -4.3° - -2.0°), and the
Western lineage the western part (longitude: -6.346 ±
0.394 °, range: -7.5° - -4.1°). In general, more different
haplotypes and more haplotypes per geographic area
were found in the southern populations compared to
northern populations (Figure 5). The cytb haplotype (h)
and nucleotide diversity (π) were higher in southern
than in northern Spain (Table 2). h was significantly different in one and π in two lineages. The cytb minimumspanning network indicated northward range expansion
in all three main lineages (Figure 5b), while this pattern
was less obvious in the nuclear network of the suppressor of SWI4 1 (Figure 5c). Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs
showed negative and statistically significant values for
northern populations of all lineages, indicating population expansion, and non-significant values for southern
populations in the Central lineage and the edwardsianus
lineage (Table 2). Additionally, in the Western lineage
Tajima’s D was negative and statistically significant in
southern populations suggesting population expansion.
Overall all lineages, none of the two neutrality tests was
significant (Table 2).
Phenotypic Differences within P. hispanicus

Results from the permutational MANOVA (NP-MANOVA) showed that there were statistically significant differences in phenotypic traits between all three major
lineages of P. hispanicus (F2,208 = 34.79, P < 0.001, Figure 6). Pairwise comparisons showed that each lineage
differed from the other two lineages (edwardsianus vs.
Central lineage: t170 = 7.75, Padj <0.001, edwardsianus
vs. Western lineage: t145 = 5.29, Padj <0.001, Central vs.
Western lineage: t101 = 3.38, Padj = <0.001).
Discriminant function analyses yielded two functions,
the first explaining 88.14% of the variance and the second 11.86%. The first discriminant function separated
edwardsianus from the other two lineages, whereas the
second function discriminated between the Central and
the Western lineage. Factor loadings (Table 3a) showed
that the number of femoral pores, the nuptial coloration,
and the number of throat scales were important determinants of the first discriminant function. The second
discriminant function was mainly determined by the
number of ocelli, the snout shape, and again by the nuptial coloration. The presence/absence of a supralabial
scale below the subocular scale could not be included in

existed within lineages. In fact, all specimens belonging
to the edwardsianus lineage showed a supralabial scale
below the subocular scale whereas those from the other

between the Central lineage and the other two lineages,
but no differences were present between edwardsianus
and the Western lineage. The snout-to-vent length

(SVL), SVL ratio, body mass, the number of ventral
scales, and the number of collar scales differed between
edwardsianus and the Central lineage, and there were
no differences between the Western lineage and the two
other lineages. There were statistically significant differences between the edwardsianus lineage and the other
two lineages in head ratio and nuptial coloration, and
no differences between Central and Western lineage.
Ecological Niche Modelling within P. hispanicus

Five out of eight sampled populations (62.5%) that were
previously unknown to the authors were located in 10 ×
10 km squares where P. hispanicus has not been
recorded previously [15]. This indicates that the

We evaluated the model error of the niche models using
an independent data-set obtained from the Official
Spanish Atlas of Amphibians and Reptiles [15]. The
model omission error was 13.7% with respect to the currently known presences of P. hispanicus, which is reasonably small. We further determined the importance of
the sampling points for the lineage predictions using
jackknife methodology, in order to investigate whether
sampling points of a given lineage may be more important than in other lineages and thus whether differing
sample sizes among lineages may have biased our predictions and conclusions. The average proportional
habitat suitability (HS) difference was similar among
lineages (one-way ANOVA: F2,19 = 0.91, P = 0.42), indicating similar population representativeness among
lineages and no bias due to unequal sample sizes. These
are important conditions for comparing niche divergences/similarities and overlaps among pair combinations of lineages.

distribution of P. hispanicus is underestimated, and thus
biogeographic modelling may be importantly hindered
when using presence/absence data. In this regard, the
Spanish Atlas of Amphibians and Reptiles [15] does not
discriminate between presences belonging to the different lineages. Consequently, we used modelling techniques that do not require absence data to link our
presence records with environmental predictors and run

lineages of P. hispanicus. The discriminant function scores derived
from linear combinations of the phenotypic variables [88,89] are

using the ‘k-means’ clustering method [102]. Each cluster encloses
the observations closest to lineage centroid. The three lineages are

Assessment of predictor relevance

Most of the variation explained by ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) was included in the two first factors
(edwardsianus lineage: 97%; Central lineage: 89%; Western lineage: 96%). ENFA showed that the distribution
of the edwardsianus lineage was best predicted by the
mean temperature of wettest quarter, minimum temperature of the coldest month, and precipitation of the
coldest quarter (Figure 7a). Mean temperature of the
driest quarter and annual temperature range best predicted the distribution of the Central lineage, whereas
the mean temperature of the driest quarter best predicted that of the Western lineage (Figures 7b and 7c).
Univariate ANOVAs of environmental predictors
showed significant differences between lineages in environmental parameters (Table 4). The edwardsianus lineage inhabited habitats with higher mean temperature of
the wettest quarter and higher minimum temperatures
during the coldest month than the Central lineage.
Both, the precipitation of the coldest quarter and Minimum Enhanced Vegetation Indexes (EVI) were significantly smaller than for the Western lineage, but did not
differ from the populations of the Central lineage. The
ecological niche of the Central lineage was characterized
by lower minimum temperature of coldest month than
the edwardsianus lineage (and a tendency compared to
the Western lineage), lower precipitation of coldest
quarter than the Western lineage (no differences compared to the edwardsianus lineage), lower precipitation
seasonality than the other two lineages and lower

lineage occurs in habitats with lower mean temperature
of wettest quarter than the edwardsianus lineage, higher
precipitation of coldest quarter and higher minimum
EVI than the other two lineages, and higher precipitation seasonality than the Central lineage (Table 4).
Predictive maps of habitat suitability and suitability
overlaps

For the edwardsianus lineage the highest habitat suitability (HS) scores were located in Eastern Spain (Figure
8a and Additional File 2: Figure S1a) ranging from the
French border to the southernmost tip of Spain. Suitable
habitat was located in the proximity of the East coast
and also along the rivers flowing out into the Mediterranean Sea (e.g. Ebro River) and Atlantic Ocean (e.g. Guadalquivir River). Suitable habitat was also predicted in
central Spain mainly close to the Tajo River and the
Guadiana River. Suitable habitat for the Central lineage

was predicted in central Spain (Figure 8b and Additional
File 1: Figure S1b), and for the Western lineage in Western Spain and along the Mediterranean and Cantabrian
coastline (Figure 8c and Additional File 1: Figure S1c).
The zoomed potential contact zones (localized using
minimum-convex polygons, Additional File 3: Figure S3)
showed no connectivity between the edwardsianus and
the Central lineage through HS values obtained from
the edwardsianus model (Figure 8a, HS scores equal
100 and 0 respectively) and for the Central lineage suitability prediction (Figure 8b, HS scores equal 20 and
100 respectively). Similarly, there was also a clear gap
between the Central lineage and the Western lineage in
both suitability predictions (Figures 8b and 8c; HS
scores equal 0 and 50 for the Central lineage prediction
and 100 and 0 for the Western lineage prediction). The
maps of the overlapping habitat suitability showed overlap between the edwardsianus and Central lineage in

central Spain and close to the Ebro River (ZaragozaLleida) (extent of overall overlap = 9.4%; Figure 8d,
Additional File 2: Figure S2d, Additional File 2: Table
S2), that the habitat suitability distributions of the
edwardsianus and Western lineage overlapped over an
important part of their distributions (extent of overlap =
23.4%; Figure 8e, Additional File 2: Table S2), and that
almost no overlap existed between the Central and the
Western lineage (2.8%; Figure 8f, Additional File 2:
Table S2).
Ecological Niche Divergence within P. hispanicus

We first assessed niche divergence among lineages based
on the principle of interpredictivity among lineages (see
methods). There existed statistically significant differences between lineages in HS scores obtained for the
sampled edwardsianus populations (F2,19 = 12.10, P <
0.001, Figure 9a and Additional File 2: Figure S2a). Posthoc comparisons showed that the HS scores of sampled
edwardsianus populations were higher than those of the

Page 8 of 21

other two lineages (Tukey range tests: P adj < 0.01 in
both cases), and no significant differences were present
between Central and the Western lineage populations
(Padj = 0.45). Similarly, the HS for the Central lineage
were significantly different between lineages (F 2,19 =
54.84, P < 0.001, Figure 9b and Additional File 2: Figure
S2b). Post-hoc comparison showed that HS scores for
the Central lineage populations were higher than for
populations of the other two lineages (P adj < 0.001 in
both cases) and again no statistically significant differences were present between the other two lineages (Padj
= 0.90). HS scores derived for the Western lineage were
also significantly different among lineages (F2,19 = 12.62,
P < 0.001, Figure 9c and Additional File 2: Figure S2c),
and post- hoc test showed that populations of the Western lineage had higher values than populations of the
other two lineages (Padj < 0.05 in both cases) whereas
no statistically significant differences existed between
populations of the other two lineages (Padj = 0.18). The
prediction of the HS for the Central lineage (Figure 9b)
showed high values for the Central lineage (>80%) and
almost no predictability for the other two lineages
(<2%). The predictions for the other two lineages
showed highest HS for the modelled lineage, lowest HS
for the Central lineage, and intermediate HS for the
remaining lineage.
Second, we estimated the overprediction of lumped
models compared to the corresponding overlaid split
models ([19], see methods) and found that the central
clade’s niche was the most divergent niche, which is in
line with the above findings. Models of the Central lineage lumped with one of the other lineages predicted on
average 39.2% more suitable habitat than the overlaid
split models (Table 5), which is 8.03% more than overprediction when modelling the edwardsianus and Western lineage. Similarly, the difference in false-positive
rates between lumped and overlaid split models was on
average higher when the Central lineage was included
(32.03%) than when comparing the Western and the
edwardsianus lineage (Table 5). Lumped models including the Central lineage had on average a false positive
rate that was 11.31% higher than the one when comparing the edwardsianus and Western lineage.
Finally, our results of ensemble predictions showed
that ENFA results of predictive maps, niche divergences
and geographic overlaps are robust to inter-model variability arising from different algorithms used for model
building (Additional File 2).

Here, we address how geology, climate, and ecology
shaped current diversity in Psammodromus hispanicus

phenotypic, phylogeographic, and ecological niche
analyses.
Species Status and Phylogenetic Relationships within
Iberian Psammodromus

We reconstructed congruent mt- and nuclear-based phylogenies (and the corresponding networks) that confidently recovered three major lineages in P. hispanicus,
corresponding to P. hispanicus edwardsianus, P. hispanicus hispanicus Central lineage, and P. hispanicus hispanicus Western lineage. The molecular clock indicates that
the age of divergence of the Central and the edwardsianus lineages was about 4.8 (1.5-8.7) Mya, which, together
with phylogeographic and phenotypic evidence, strongly
suggest that these two lineages reflect independent evolutionary units. The divergence between these two lineages
and the Western lineage was estimated to have occurred
about 8.3 (2.9-14.7) Mya. Altogether, the rather old age
of divergence, the lack of haplotype and geographic overlap, as well as the existence of phenotypic differentiation,
and ecological niche divergence (in the Central lineage),
allow postulating that both the Central and the Western
lineage may be valid species.

There is significant phenotypic differentiation among
the three lineages. The Western lineage was phenotypically intermediate between the edwardsianus and Central
lineages, which showed higher phenotypic differentiation.
The latter two lineages differed in 11 of the 12 studied
traits (Table 3: femoral pores, number of ocelli, SVL, SVL
ratio, snout shape, body mass, number of ventral scales,
head ratio, number of collar and throat scales, and nuptial coloration) whereas the Western lineage differed
from the edwardsianus lineage in five traits (femoral
pores, number of throat scales, snout shape, head ratio,
and nuptial coloration) and from the Central lineage in
four traits (femoral pores, number of ocelli and throat
scales, and snout shape). The Western lineage showed
trait values that were intermediate between those measured in the Central and the edwardsianus lineages in 8
of the 12 measured traits (Table 3a). Moreover, all specimens of the edwardsianus lineage could be distinguished
from the other two lineages by the presence of a supralabial scale below the subocular scale. This finding is in
line with previous taxonomy, where its presence has been
used to distinguish between the two subspecies, P. hispanicus hispanicus and P. hispanicus edwardsianus [20].

scores are listed in a graded colour series on the left border of the map. Potential contact zones (see Additional File 3 - Figure S3) are enlarged

hispanicus hispanicus Western lineage and P. hispanicus edwardsianus (e), and P. hispanicus hispanicus Central lineage and P. hispanicus hispanicus
Western lineage (f) are given in separate panels. In these maps areas are coloured in brown if the habitat suitability scores of a lineage pair were
larger than zero for both lineages.

For P. algirus, phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data provide evidence for the existence of four statistically supported lineages, two corresponding to the SW
and NW clades of P. algirus [16], another corresponding
to the nominate lineage of P. algirus (from Africa), and
the oldest one corresponding to the Eastern lineage of
P. algirus [16]. The molecular clock showed that the
NW and SW clades split only around 1.00 (0.3 - 1.9)
Mya, and that the Eastern lineage split around 3.01 (1.0
- 5.5) Mya. The former divergence estimate is similar to
the oldest divergence times inferred for the clades
within the edwardsianus and Central lineage (0.86 (0.3
-1.6) and 0.76 (0.2 - 1.5) Mya, respectively; Figure 3),

whereas the latter estimate coincided with the split of
the clades within the Western lineage (2.80 (0.9 - 5.1)
Mya; Figure 3). The younger datings correspond to the
Pleistocene, suggesting a role of glaciations at the origin
of the different lineages. Interestingly, there is geographic overlap between northern and southern populations of the Central and the edwardsianus lineage, as
well as between the SW and NW clades of P. algirus,
suggesting that in both cases reproductive isolation
among lineages/clades may exist. Within lineages, the
recovered trees and network, as well as population
genetic analyses suggest northward expansion of P. hispanicus from southern refugia [21,22], and incipient and

ongoing genetic isolation, while the pattern is less clear
within P. algirus.
Biogeographic Implications

According to our results, the P. algirus group likely had
an Iberian origin, and first split into eastern and western
lineages (Figure 1). Within the western lineage, a second

split separated the Iberian ancestor of the Northwestern
+ Southwestern clades from Moroccan P. algirus, suggesting that P. algirus colonized Africa from the Iberian
Peninsula. These inferred biogeographic patterns confirm previously reported results based on partial 12S
rRNA, 16S rRNA and cytochrome b sequences [23].
However, our molecular dating suggests that the Eastern
lineage split from the other lineages slightly later than
previously estimated (3.6 ± 0.05 mya [23]). Unfortunately, we cannot determine whether the origin of the
genus Psammodromus was Iberian or North African
since our phylogeny did not include two key African
species, P. blanci (likely the sister group of P. hispanicus; [23]) and P. microdactylus.
Differentiation of the Western lineage from the ancestor of the other two P. hispanicus lineages occurred in
the Miocene when a progressive uplift started to close
the East of the Betic Straits, and formed the Guadalquivir basin (Early Messinian; 7.2-5.5 Mya) [24]. During the
same geological period, there were hypothesized splits in
several other Iberian reptile and amphibian genera such
as Lissotriton [25], Alytes, [26], and Blanus [27], producing in some of them [25 and 27] a similar east-west
differentiation pattern. The split between the Central
and the edwardsianus lineages dates back to the Miocene/Pliocene boundary and thus close to the Messinian
salinity crisis and the opening of the Gibraltar Strait.
During this period an uplift of the Spanish Central System occurred that led to the current configuration of
the Iberian Peninsula’s main river drainages [28], indicating that major geologic and climatic changes
occurred. Accordingly, Pliocene diversification has been
reported for many Iberian groups including freshwater
fishes [29-31] and amphibians [32-34].
The spatial distribution of mt cytb, nad4, nuclear suppressor of SWI4 1, and nuclear clone 17 diversity
showed current allopatry for all three P. hispanicus
lineages suggesting a vicariant event at their origin (see
above). A decrease in cytb diversity with increasing latitude was observed, which likely indicates northward
range expansion of all three lineages. The large, negative, and significant test statistics of the neutrality tests
in the edwardsianus and Central lineage further

Fitze et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:347
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/347

supported this result. However, statistical support for a
northward range expansion in the Western lineage was
low, most likely due to the small sample sizes obtained
from the southern Peninsula (N = 7 individuals belonging to three different haplotypes) and the rather homogenous haplotype distribution on the northern Peninsula
(mainly haplotype CE7). Similar patterns were observed
in the suppressor of SWI4 1 diversity. The observed
range expansions may be the result of post-glacial range
expansions [35] from glacial refugia located south of the
Guadiana and the Júcar River. According to the molecular clock, range expansions may have occurred around
0.8 (0.2 - 1.5) Mya, which coincides with the Pleistocene
glacial and interglacial periods [36]. Similar Pleistocene
patterns of range expansion during interglacial periods
have been reported for reptile species [37,38] and also
for insects, molluscs, amphibians, mammals, and plants
[39,40].
Niche Modelling within P. hispanicus

We performed ecological niche modelling for each of
the three identified lineages to obtain predictive maps of
habitat suitability, and assess predictor relevance and
niche divergence. The habitat suitability maps fitted the
realized niche reasonably well, and the model omission
error was only 13.7% with respect to the P. hispanicus
presences cited in the official Spanish Atlas of Amphibians and Reptiles [15] (analysis based on 10 × 10 km
resolution) and no sampling bias could be detected.
For all comparisons among the three P. hispanicus
lineages, habitat suitability scores in the sampled populations were significantly different among lineages and
highest in the lineage populations for which the distribution was modelled. These results indicate that
lineages tend to differ in the optimal portions of their
niches. According to the spatial prediction models, the
mean temperature of driest quarter was one of the most
important predictors of the observed distributions of the
Central and the Western lineage. In contrast, mean temperature of wettest quarter, minimum temperature, and
precipitation of coldest quarter were the most important
predictors of the edwardsianus lineage’s distribution.
This pattern was in line with the finding that the
edwardsianus lineage inhabited areas with lower vegetation cover on the generally warmer and drier eastern
coast of the Iberian Peninsula. The Central lineage
inhabited central peninsular habitats characterized by
intermediate vegetation cover, precipitation and temperature in wettest quarter, and with the lowest minimum temperatures of coldest quarter and precipitation
seasonality. The Western lineage lived in habitats with
the highest vegetation cover, winter precipitation, precipitation seasonality, and winter minimum temperatures,

Page 12 of 21

and with the lowest temperatures during the wettest
quarter, corresponding to the more humid and climatically more stable Western parts of the Iberian Peninsula.
We used different approaches to assess niche divergence between the three lineages, and analyses revealed
the same overall pattern. Interpredictivity, differential
model overprediction among hierarchical taxonomic
groups, and the extent of geographic overlap of the
model predictions, showed that the ecological niche of
the Central lineage was most divergent, whereas ecological niches of the Western and edwardsianus lineages
were more similar. Based on the reconstructed tree
topologies and following the principle of parsimony, we
can infer that the ancestor of the Central and edwardsianus lineages likely occupied a niche similar to that of
its sister group, i.e. the Western lineage. Hence, niche
divergence occurred during the evolution of the Central
lineage.
There is suitable climatically suitable habitat for the
edwardsianus lineage in the west of the Guadalquivir
River, and suitable habitat was predicted for the Western lineage on the Eastern Iberian Peninsula (Figures
8a and 8c). The spatial predictions showed important
overlap between the edwardsianus and the Western
lineage on the southern and southwestern Iberian
Peninsula (Figure 8e), where both lineages share potentially suitable ecological conditions on both sides of the
Guadalquivir River. This suggests that a barrier between
Málaga and the Guadalquivir River may prevent population mixing and led to vicariant diversification by
impeding dispersal, from the betic uplift in the late Miocene/early Pliocene until the present. Earlier findings in
amphibians (e.g. Discoglossus galganoi and D. jeanneae
[41]) are in agreement with this hypothesis.
When comparing the Central lineage with the edwardsianus lineage, suitable habitat for both lineages was
located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula (Figure
8d), and there was no connection through HS values in
the estimated contact zone (Figure 8a and 8b). In contrast, the Central lineage showed almost no habitat overlap with the Western lineage (and thus, the Centraledwardsianus ancestor) (Figure 8f), which indicates that
niche divergence may be an important force preventing
the mixing of these lineages.
In summary, these results show that the Western lineage
and the ancestor of the Central and edwardsianus lineages
may have been geographically isolated due to a barrier
[41] that still may prevent mixing of the Western and
edwardsianus lineages, and that niche divergence may
have played a limited role in the separation of these two
lineages. In contrast, our analyses provide evidence that
niche divergence was more prominent in the Central lineage, potentially preventing gene flow with its sister lineage.

Integrating Phylogenetic, Phenotypic, Geological, and
Environmental Data

Determining the relative role of historical and ecological
factors as evolutionary drivers of diversification is a central question in evolutionary biology. In this work, we
performed a multidisciplinary approach to delimit current diversity of P. hispanicus, and to understand its origin and maintenance. Phylogenetic (mt, nuclear, and
combined) and phenotypic data allowed us to differentiate three lineages, which showed important differences
in phenotypic traits. The early splitting of the Western
lineage may coincide with a vicariant event, which is the
initiation of the betic uplift and the formation of the
Guadalquivir basin at the end of the Tortonian about 7
Mya, but the large confidence intervals hinder more precise dating. Interestingly, ecological niche modelling
shows large overlap in suitable habitat between the
Western and the edwardsianus lineage, which contrasts
with the phylogeographic cytb, nad4, suppressor of
SWI4 1, and clone 17 haplotype distribution that show
no spatial overlap of the two lineages. The molecular
clock together with genetic, geological, and niche-modelling data suggest that an event related to the betic
uplift at the Miocene-Pliocene boundary hindered until
present gene flow of Psammodromus. The important
niche overlap together with the limited gene flow supports a diversification model of niche conservatism in
allopatry for the early divergence of the Western lineage
and the common ancestor of the Central and the
edwardsianus lineage.
The split between the Central and the edwardsianus
lineage in the Early Pliocene coincides with the uplift of
the Spanish Central System, which resulted in a change
of the drainage patterns from internal to external, and
the forming of the present river systems in the Iberian
Peninsula [42]. These geological changes produced
major climate changes ranging from dry climate during
the Messinian salinity crisis to more humid habitats in
the early Pliocene. These climate changes may be
responsible for diversification within P. hispanicus. The
finding that the ecological niche of the Central lineage
was most divergent with respect to those of the edwardsianus and Western lineages (despite the older age of
the Western lineage split), implies that niche divergence
and ecologically-based divergent selection were involved
in the diversification process. However, since the Central
lineage diverged from the edwardsianus lineage when
major climatic changes happened, the possibility that a
climatic barrier and initial niche conservatism could
have been responsible for the initial splitting cannot be
fully discarded [43].
The large overlap of suitable habitat between the
edwardsianus and the Western lineage compared to the
small overlap with the Central lineage should be

Page 13 of 21

reflected in those phenotypic traits that are adaptive.
We explored two phenotypic traits that may be under
natural selection in lizards (coloration and number of
throat scales). Vegetation cover may determine which
colours are cryptic and which ones are conspicuous, and
thus, background matching to avoid predation may be
the cause for the evolution of colour differences [44,45].
The Western and the Central lineages do not differ in
their nuptial coloration, which is greener than that of
the edwardsianus lineage. A second example is the
number of throat scales. Since smaller scales and more
numerous scales reduce skin water exchange [46], differences in the number of throat scales may have evolved
due to precipitation differences. Here we found that the
edwardsianus lineage shows an increased number of
throat scales with respect to the Western lineage,
whereas the Central lineage shows the lowest number of
throat scales. When comparing the ecological scenarios
derived from phenotypic traits (Table 3) with real differences in environmental parameters (Table 4), there was
a general lack of correlation between environmental
parameters and known phenotypic traits under selective
pressure, which is in line with previous findings that
phenotype does not necessarily predict ecology. Thus,
our results suggest that the use of phenotypic traits as a
surrogate for ecology in studies dealing with phylogenetic niche conservatism may be problematic [11], but
see [47]. The complexity in phenotypic variation found
here, encourages future studies that aim at partitioning
phenotypic variation into independent contributions of
ecology, phylogenetic inertia, and phylogenetically structured ecological variation, as proposed for higher taxon
levels [48].

Conclusions
Our results indicate that divergence due to both historical geographic barriers and environmental differences
may have led through time to the evolution of three P.
hispanicus lineages, and that these processes are still
acting now to prevent population mixing over the largest part of their allopatric distributions. Our preliminary results on the phylogeographic patterns observed in
P. algirus suggest that similar patterns may also exist in
other related lizard species, as previously suggested.
Here, we highlight the importance of taking a multidisciplinary approach for disentangling the relative roles of
vicariant and adaptive divergence in generating currently
observed biological diversity. We found that a vicariant
event was at the origin of the first splitting event, which
was followed by a second splitting event (split between
P. hispanicus hispanicus Central and P. hispanicus
edwardsianus lineage) in which the role of ecologically
based divergent selection (i.e. niche divergence) may
have been more prominent. This indicates that diversity

Fitze et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:347
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/347

in a lineage is the result of different temporally separated evolutionary processes, which is concordant with
patterns observed in other groups (e.g. cichlids, [49];
Gobiidae, [50]; Passerine birds, [51]; anoles, [52,53]).

Methods
Samples and DNA Extraction

We conducted a systematic population sampling all over
Spain (one population per intersection of a ± 250 km
grid) and captured a total of 285 specimens between
April and May 2006. The capture and handling of
lizards was conducted under the licenses provided by
Junta de Andalucía, Gobierno de Aragón, Junta de Castilla y León, Junta de Comunidades de Castilla - La
Mancha, Generalitat de Catalunya, Junta de Extremadura, Xunta de Galicia, Comunidad de Madrid,
Gobierno de Navarra, Generalitat Valenciana, Parque
Natural de l’Albufera (Valencia), Parque Natural del
Delta del Ebro (Cataluña), Parque Nacional de Doñana
(Huelva), and Gobierno de España. Of the 285 captured
specimens, 265 were identified as members of P. hispanicus, whereas 20 specimens were identified as members
of P. algirus. We were able to collect individuals in 11
previously known populations (50%; see Additional File
1), failed to find any sample in three known populations,
but found samples in adjacent unknown populations
(13.6%; [15]). We also screened potential habitats in
locations where no records existed previously, and were
able to successfully collect specimens in eight yet
unknown populations (36.4%). Sample locations are
shown in Figure 4, and the location, sample size and
collection numbers are given in Additional File 4.
For each captured individual, we collected a small
piece of the tail tip, which was preserved in 70% ethanol
at -20ºC. Genomic DNA was extracted from ethanolpreserved tissues using the ChargeSwitch gDNA Micro
Tissue Kit (Invitrogen). All individuals were sequenced
for mt cytochrome b (cytb) gene, and a subsample
including 56 representative specimens of P. hispanicus
and 16 specimens of P. algirus was also sequenced for
mt NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (nad4) gene, and
two nuclear loci (see Additional File 4 for specimen
number and GenBank accession numbers).
Two primer combinations (L14841 [54] + H15149
[54], and MNCN-Glu F [55] + H15149 [54]) were used
to amplify part of the cytb gene in different individuals,
yielding sequence lengths between 275 and 418 bp
(depending on the specimen). A fragment of 865 bp of
the nad4 gene was amplified using primers nad4 and
LEU [56] for most specimens of the subsample. For specimens of the subsample where we could not amplify
the nad4 fragment, we designed two additional primers
(forward: L11162, reverse: tRNA-His H11749, see Table
6) in conserved regions of the nad4 gene to amplify a

Page 14 of 21

shorter and fully overlapping region (504 bp). Two
nuclear regions were obtained by cloning. Genomic
DNA of P. hispanicus was digested with BamHI and
BglII restriction enzymes, cloned into pBlueScript SK+
vector, and transformed into E. coli XL10 strain (Stratagene) following standard protocols [57]. Plasmids were
purified from positive white clones, and sequenced with
universal M13 primers in an automated DNA sequencer
(ABI PRISM 3700, Applied Biosystems) using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit, and following manufacturer’s instructions. Sequence similarity
searches [58] were performed against GenBank databases using both the nucleotide blast and the blastx
algorithms. The best hit for one of the loci was Anolis
carolinensis suppressor of SWI4 1 homolog (percent
coverage = 99%, e-value ≤ 3.0E−110, maximum identity
≥ 71%), whereas no relevant matches were obtained for
clone 17. For partial suppressor of SWI4 1 gene, the forward 8F17-F35 and the reverse 8F17-R815 primers were
designed to amplify a fragment of 886 bp (see Table 6).
For clone 17, a total of three forward primers (17-F20,
17-F32 and 17-F53), and two reverse primers (17-R613
and 17-R749) were designed to amplify fragments of
372 - 977 bp in length (see Table 6).
PCR amplifications were conducted in 25 µl reactions
containing 67 mM Tris- HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.4 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 µM of each primer, template
mtDNA (10-100 ng), and Taq DNA polymerase (1.5 U,
Roche). For the PCR amplification of the cytb gene fragment, an initial 60 s denaturing step at 93º C was followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 93º C for 60 s,
annealing at 45-50º C for 60 s, and an extension phase
at 72º C for 60 s. The final extension phase at 72º C
lasted for 6 min. PCR cycling conditions for amplifying

cycle 2 - 41 (94º C for 60 s, 53-66º C for 60 s, 72º C for

an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 3700,
Applied Biosystems) with the corresponding PCR primers using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit, and following manufacturer’s instructions.
Phylogenetic Analyses

Three sequence data sets were analyzed: the first data
set (mt data set) included cytb gene partial sequences of
P. hispanicus (285 specimens), and of seven individuals
of P. algirus (accession numbers: DQ150367, DQ150366,
DQ150365, DQ150364, DQ150363, DQ150362,
AF206535) obtained from GenBank. In addition, cytb
sequences of three individuals of Gallotia caesaris caesaris (AY151843, AY154903, AF439948) and three individuals of Gallotia caesaris gomerae (AY151842,
AY154902, AY154901) were used as outgroup taxa, and
for molecular clock calibration. The second data set
(nuclear data set) included partial sequences of two
nuclear loci (suppressor of SWI4 1 and clone 17) of a
subset of 56 individuals representing the major lineages
of P. hispanicus (as per previous mt analyses), 16 individuals of P. algirus, and six specimens of G. caesaris. A
total of 16 individuals were heterozygotes in 3.8% of
their nucleotide positions, which were coded as N in all
subsequent analyses. The third data set (combined data
set) included cytb, nad4, and the two nuclear loci (suppressor of SWI4 1 and clone 17) for the subset of 54
individuals representing the major lineages of P.
hispanicus.
Sequences were aligned using Clustal × version 1.83
[59] with default penalties for gap opening and gap
extension, and alignments were visually verified. For
each molecular marker, independent alignments were
prepared, and the best-fit models of nucleotide substitution were inferred using the Akaike information criterion (AIC; [60] as implemented in Modeltest version 3.7
[61]). The mt, nuclear, and combined data sets were
analyzed using maximum likelihood (ML; [62], and
Bayesian inference (BI; [63]. ML analyses were performed with RAxML version 7.2.6 [64] using the rapid
hill-climbing algorithm [65] and starting from 100 distinct randomized maximum-parsimony starting trees.

Page 15 of 21

For BI analyses, we used MrBayes version 3.1.2 [63,66].
We ran four simultaneous Markov chains for 20 million
generations, sampling every 2000 generations (10,000
trees), and discarding the first 10% of generations (1,000
trees) as burn-in to prevent sampling before reaching
stationarity. Adequate convergence of the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo runs was assessed using Tracer
version 1.5 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/).
Two independent BI runs were performed to increase
the chance of adequate mixing of the Markov chains,
and to give some chance of spotting failure to converge.
For both ML and BI analyses, three partitions were used
for the mt data set (accounting for each codon position),
two partitions were used for the nuclear data set (one
per locus), and eight were used for the combined data
set (accounting for each nuclear marker, plus each
codon position of each mt marker). For BI analyses,
independent best-fit models of nucleotide substitution
(as selected by Modeltest) were used for each partition
with model parameters unlinked and estimated separately among partitions. For ML analyses, the GTR + Γ
model was used for all partitions due to software
(RAxML) constraints, and model parameters were
unlinked and estimated separately among partitions. Statistical support for internal branches in the ML analyses
was evaluated by non-parametric bootstrapping [67]
with 2,000 replicates and using posterior probabilities in
the BI analyses.
Dating of Divergence Times

The combined dataset was used to date major cladogenetic events within the Psammodromus phylogeny using
the Bayesian relaxed clock method [68] as implemented
in BEAST version 1.6.1 [69]. This widely used method
for dating phylogenies [70] assumes a relaxed uncorrelated clock with rates drawn from a lognormal distribution across branches. The ML optimal topology was
used as a starting tree, and the birth-death process [71]
was used to describe diversification. The partitions used
for BI of the combined data set and corresponding models (see above) were employed for the dating analysis. A
first run of 10 million generations was first performed
to optimize the scale factors of the prior function. The
final Markov chain was run twice for 100 million generations, sampling every 10,000 generations, and burn-in
and convergence of the chains were determined with
Tracer. Effective Sample Size (ESS) values were over 350
for all parameters sampled.
Time estimates were calibrated using the formation of
El Hierro 1.12 ± 0.02 Mya [72] as internal time constraint (maximum age) for the split between Gallotia
lizards from El Hierro and La Gomera (Canary Islands).
The time constraint was used as ‘soft’ bound [73]: the
mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution

Fitze et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:347
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/347

were chosen so that the mean is the arithmetical mean
of the interval, and 95% of the probability lies within the
lower and upper bound. Analyses using a uniform
instead of a normal distribution yielded almost the same
average time estimates and confidence interval width
(not shown).
Genetic Structure

Population genetic analyses of P. hispanicus were performed using Arlequin 3.11. [74]. Minimum-spanning
networks based on cytb, nad4, suppressor of SWI4 1
and clone 17 haplotypes were inferred independently.
To infer population dynamics from cytb haplotype data,
each of the three major lineages of P. hispanicus (as
recovered in the phylogenetic trees and the minimumspanning networks) was split into northern and southern populations (approximately above and below 40ºN
separating the three lineages into approximately 50%
northern and 50% southern populations; see Additional
File 1). Descriptive statistics including haplotype diversity (Hd; [75]) and nucleotide diversity (π; [75]) were
determined for northern and southern populations,
respectively. Inter-haplotype levels of divergence
between northern and southern populations were estimated using the fixation index FST [76], which includes
information on mitochondrial haplotype frequency [77],
and genetic distances (TrN93; [78]) with gamma correction. Significance of pairwise population comparisons
was tested by 20,000 permutations. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was used to examine the
amount of genetic variability partitioned within and
among populations [76]. AMOVA tests were organized
in a hierarchical manner so that population structure
was studied at increments of increasing spatial scale,
which range from structure within and among different
populations to northern versus southern groups. Permutation procedures (N = 20,000) were used to construct
null distributions, and test the significance of variance
components for each hierarchical comparison [79]. In
all instances with multiple tests, p-values were adjusted
using the sequential Bonferroni correction [80].
Phenotypic Data

Immediately after capture, standardized digital photographs of each lizard belonging to P. hispanicus were
taken according to the methods used by Fitze & Richner
[81]. In brief, living lizards were placed in a box covered
with a photographic filter lens to immobilize the individual. This box was placed in an opaque camera box
where two flashes were mounted. The settings of the
camera and flashes were always identical and the distance between the objective and the object was fixed.
Thus all photographs received a standard light exposure.
Standard white chips (Kodak Colour Control Patches

Page 16 of 21

with R = 255, G = 255, B = 255) were fixed to each side
of the filter for detecting potential errors in light exposure and allowing for calibrating the sizes. Photos were
taken of the lizards’ belly, back and flanks. Lizards were
weighed to the nearest 0.001 g, snout-to-vent length
(SVL) and total length were measured to the nearest 1
mm, and the number of femoral pores was counted.
Photos were imported into IMAGEJ program
(National Institute of Science, USA) and a set of 11
different phenotypic and biometric traits were measured: head length, head width, snout width, snout
length, anal scale width, number of ventral scales, presence of a supralabial below subocular, number of
throat and collar scales, number of ocelli, and the nuptial coloration (for detailed description, see Table 7).
Head shape was calculated by dividing head width by
head length [82], and snout shape was estimated by
dividing snout length by snout width. Smaller head
shape values thus indicate that the head was more
pointed, and smaller snout shape values indicate that
the snout was less pointed. SVL ratio was calculated
by dividing total length by SVL [83], and the relative
anal scale width by dividing anal scale width by SVL
[84]. The measures of the different phenotypic traits
were highly repeatable ([85] statistics based on two
blindly taken repeated measurements: the number of
throat scales had the lowest repeatability: F10,11 = 4.13,
P = 0.014, r = 0.61; rest of the traits: F10,11 > 6.52, P <
0.002, r >0.73, mean r = 0.86 ± 0.03).
Statistics used for the Analyses of Phenotypic Data

All statistical analyses were conducted using R 2.7.0
software (Free Software Foundation, GNU Project, Boston, MA, USA). A total of 211 adults were used for the
multivariate analyses. We applied a permutational
MANOVA (NP - MANOVA) based on distance measures [86] to investigate differences between lineages
revealed by phylogenetic analyses. A total of 9,999 permutations were conducted, following Manly [87]. We
first standardized the data in order to avoid differential
impact of unequally scaled variables on the posterior
analysis [88]. Thereafter, we calculated the dissimilarities
between observations based on Euclidean distances, and
applied a NP - MANOVA (Adonis function in Vegan
package). Results from paired contrasts between lineages
were corrected using Bonferroni procedures, indicated
as Padj [80]. The assumption of homogeneity of multivariate dispersion between lineages was fulfilled for all
presented analyses [86].
Discriminant functions were derived from the linear
combinations of the variables [88,89], to assess the relative contribution of each variable to the differences
between lineages and to visualize multivariate differences between lineages.

We used biologically relevant environmental variables at
a 1-km resolution. We initially considered 18 climatic,
one topographic and two vegetation index variables, all
of them typically being used in biogeographic models as
direct and/or indirect predictors of species distributions
(e.g. [91-93]). Climatic and topographic variables were
obtained from the Worldclim source [94], whose raster
maps were downloaded at the EDIT Geoplatform http://
edit.csic.es/. As a measurement of primary productivity
we used monthly maps of Enhanced Vegetation Indexes
(EVI) generated from satellite MODIS images available
at the NASA-LP DAAC web page (https://lpdaac.usgs.
gov/lpdaac). EVI is an improvement of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense
vegetation conditions. Besides predicting primary productivity, EVI is also a measurement of shade availability, which in turn, may modulate direct climate effects
in ectotherms (e.g. [95]). We generated year-averaged
monthly values of EVI for each cell from the oldest period available to the year of taxon sampling (2000-2006).
Thereafter, we calculated for each cell the minimum
and maximum values over all months.
To meet model assumptions, environmental variables
were Box-Cox transformed. Redundancy and colinearity
between variables was analysed using Pearson correlations. Eight variables were excluded from the analyses
because they were highly correlated with other variables
(r > 0.90). A total of 13 variables were used for the subsequent analyses: seven temperature predictors (annual
mean temperature, mean temperature of wettest quarter,
mean temperature of driest quarter, minimum temperature of coldest month, maximum temperature of warmest month, annual temperature range and isothermality),
four precipitation predictors (annual precipitation, precipitation of the warmest quarter, precipitation of the
coldest quarter and precipitation seasonality), one topographic predictor (elevation) and one EVI index (minimum EVI index).

We also run univariate ANOVAs on each response
variable separately in order to understand which traits
differed among lineages. All assumptions were verified
and, if necessary, transformations or non-parametric
analyses were applied. Model assumptions were fulfilled
in all cases.
Ecological Niche Modelling

To obtain predictive maps for the potential distributions
of each P. hispanicus lineage and assess the degree of
ecological divergence among lineages, we performed
species distribution modelling based on the ecological
niche concept [90]. We built models based on environmental predictors and the lineage presences resulting
from the phylogenetic analyses (9, 5, and 8 sampled

Model building

We built GIS-based models to estimate each lineage’s
multidimensional niche. We geo-referenced the sampled
populations and used digital maps of environmental
variables. To obtain habitat suitability (HS) maps for
each lineage we used the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) implemented in the GIS-statistical tool Biomapper [96]. ENFA allows the calculation of HS scores
for each cell in a gridded map and it is especially suited
if absence data are not available, unreliable, or meaningless. ENFA is analogous to principal component analysis
with the difference that it is based on the niche concept

Fitze et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:347
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/347

of marginality (defined as the ecological distance
between the lineages optimum and the average habitat
within the study area) and specialization (the ratio of
the ecological variance in average habitat to that associated to the focal lineage [96]). Environmental variables
are compacted into a few factors where the first factor
maximizes the marginality and the other factors maximize the specialization of the focal lineage. Finally, those
factors that explained the biggest part of variance (i.e.
those that best explained a lineage’s ecological range)
were used to obtain HS scores for each cell in the map
ranging from 0 to 100. The distribution of the eigenvalues was compared with the MacArthur’s broken stick
distribution to decide which subset of factors was used
for HS map computation [96]. In addition to the predictive maps based on continuous HS scores, we obtained
binary maps reclassified as predictions of suitability and
non-suitability. The threshold applied to transform continuous into binary maps was the minimum training
presence (the lowest HS scores associated to the populations of each lineage), which classified as suitable areas
those corresponding to scores bigger than zero. This
method is conservative since it may include cells where
the HS scores of lineages are small.
Evaluation of models

We evaluated the predictive capacity of our niche models using an independent data set, i.e the P. hispanicus
species distribution published in the official Spanish
Atlas of Amphibians and Reptiles [15]. The binary predictions derived for the three lineages were superimposed to obtain an overall prediction for P. hispanicus.
We thereafter calculated the omission error with respect
to the known P. hispanicus presences (% cells with predicted absences, with respect to the number of cells
with Atlas presences).
A crucial assumption for assessing niche divergences
and overlaps among lineages is that the predictive capacity should be similar for the compared lineages. We
therefore investigated the robustness of the lineage specific model predictions, using a jack-knife methodology
(e.g. [97]). In brief, we run an individual lineage model
with one sampled population excluded (Nlineages - 1) and
calculated the proportional prediction difference ((HSN
lineages - HSN lineages-1 )/HSN lineage). This procedure was
repeated for each population. To evaluate potential
biases between lineages we used a one-way ANOVA
with the proportional prediction difference as the
dependent variable and lineage as a factor.
Assessment of environmental predictor relevance

First, we analyzed differences in environmental predictors between lineages of P. hispanicus using one-way
ANOVAs. These analyses allow linking phenotypic differences between lineages with differences in potential
selective pressures. Second, we estimated for each

Page 18 of 21

lineage the relevance of each environmental predictor
using ENFA. For each environmental predictor, we
determined the highest predictor value among ENFA
factors that explained an important part of the variation.
Factor importance was determined using the broken
stick distribution. Environmental predictor relevance
increases with increasing predictor values (Figure 7; for
further details see [98]).
Assessment of ecological niche divergence within P.
hispanicus

We applied different principles to assess divergence of
niches between lineage pairs, and examined whether
there is concordance among procedures. First, we estimated interpredictivity among lineages [99,100]. We
used ecological niche models derived for a given lineage
and predict all sampled populations (Figure 9). High
predictability for the populations belonging to the lineage for which the niche model was constructed and low
predictability for populations of the other lineages (i.e.
low interpredictivity) indicates divergent ecological
niches. We calculated interpredictivity among lineages
using continuous HS scores and binary predictions (see
Model building) and used one-way ANOVAs based on
angularly transformed scores [88] for HS scores to compare predictability between lineages. Post-hoc comparisons were performed using Tukey´s range test.
Second, we compared niche models based on split and
lumped taxonomic groupings following Raxworthy et
al.’s rational [19]. We calculated the excess of prediction
(area predicted by lumped model - area predicted by
superposed split models) for each lineage pair and investigated whether the combined ecological niche model
predicts more suitable area than the superposed split
models. We also calculated the false-positive rates of
lumped and superposed split models by determining the
percentage of predicted niche space, where now presences have been cited [15] (wrongly predicted presences/total of absences). Since the Atlas does not
discriminate among lineages, we estimated the falsepositive rates excluding Atlas presence data within the
minimum-convex polygon of the not considered lineage.
To estimate niche divergence we calculated differences
in false-positive rates for each lineage pair (false positive
rate of lumped - split models). Bigger false-positive rate
differences indicate higher niche divergence.
Finally, the extent of geographic overlap of habitat
suitability maps between lineage pairs can reveal information about niche divergence and about the availability
and spatial structure of the shared environmental conditions. To estimate overlap, we used binary maps (see
model building) and determined areas suitable for two
lineages (Figures 8c, d, and 8e). To visualize the spatial
structure and the connectivity of shared environmental
conditions, we first localized potential lineage contact

potential contact zones where two polygons overlapped.

were provided (Figures 8a, b, and 8c), that show the

Assessing inter-model variability with respect to ENFA

To understand whether the main conclusions derived
using ENFA were robust, we assessed inter-model variability using MaxEnt, Multidimensional Envelope (MDE).
We examined to which extent niche divergence and
geographic overlaps may depend on the used algorithms,
and obtained ensemble predictions [101], which join the
results of the three modelling techniques (ENFA, Multidimensional Envelopes and MaxEnt). For more detailed
information about the applied techniques and analyses,
