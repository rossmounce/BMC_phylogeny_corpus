Abstract
Background Vertebrates share the same general body plan and organs, possess related sets of
genes, and rely on similar physiological mechanisms, yet show great diversity in morphology,
habitat and behavior. Alteration of gene regulation is thought to be a major mechanism in
phenotypic variation and evolution, but relatively little is known about the broad patterns of
conservation in gene expression in non-mammalian vertebrates.
Results We measured expression of all known and predicted genes across twenty tissues in
chicken, frog and pufferfish. By combining the results with human and mouse data and
considering only ten common tissues, we have found evidence of conserved expression for
more than a third of unique orthologous genes. We find that, on average, transcription factor
gene expression is neither more nor less conserved than that of other genes. Strikingly,
conservation of expression correlates poorly with the amount of conserved nonexonic
sequence, even using a sequence alignment technique that accounts for non-collinearity in
conserved elements. Many genes show conserved human/fish expression despite having
almost no nonexonic conserved primary sequence.
Conclusions There are clearly strong evolutionary constraints on tissue-specific gene
expression. A major challenge will be to understand the precise mechanisms by which many
gene expression patterns remain similar despite extensive cis-regulatory restructuring.

Background
Vertebrates all share a body plan, gene number and gene
catalog [1-4] inherited from a common progenitor, but so
far it has been unclear to what degree gene expression is
conserved. King and Wilson [5] initially posited that
phenotypic differences among primates are mainly due to
adaptive changes in gene regulation, rather than to changes
in protein-coding sequence or function, and this idea has
accumulated supporting evidence in recent years [6-12].
Recent work has indicated that gene expression evolves in a
fashion similar to other traits, where in the absence of
selection, random mutations introduce variants within a
population [11,13-19]. Changes negatively affecting fitness
are probably eliminated by purifying selection: core cellular
processes seem to be coexpressed from yeast to human [20],
and conservation of the expression of individual genes in
specific tissues has been observed across distantly related
vertebrates [21-24], perhaps reflecting requirements for
patterning and development as well as conserved functions
of organs, tissues and cell types. Conversely, changes that
benefit fitness (for example, under new ecological
pressures) may become fixed: changes in gene expression
are believed to underlie many differences in morphology,
physiology and behavior and, indeed, subtle differences in
gene regulation can result in spatial and temporal
alterations in transcript levels, with phenotypic
consequences at the cell, tissue and organismal levels [5,25].
The degree to which stabilizing selection constrains
directional selection and neutral drift across the full
vertebrate subphylum is, to our knowledge, unknown.
Comparative genomic analyses provide a perspective on the
evolution of both cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms, and
they are often used as a starting point for the identification
of regulatory mechanisms. One estimate, using collinear
multiple-genome alignments, suggested that roughly a
million sequence elements are conserved in vertebrates
(particularly among mammals, which represent the
majority of sequenced vertebrates) [26-29], with most being
nonexonic [28], and a series of studies have demonstrated
the cis-regulatory potential of the most highly conserved
nonexonic elements (for example, [27,29,30]). Another
study [31] found that only 29% of nonexonic mammalian
conserved bases are evident in chicken, and that nearly all
aligning sequence in fish overlaps exons, raising the
possibility that gene regulatory mechanisms may be very
different among vertebrate clades. Absence of conserved
sequence does not imply lack of regulatory conservation,
however, as many known cis-regulatory elements seem to
undergo rapid turnover [32,33], and there are examples in
which orthologous genes have similar expression patterns
despite apparent lack of sequence conservation in regulatory
regions [34]. As further evidence of pervasive regulatory

http://jbiol.com/content/8/3/33

restructuring in vertebrate evolution, an analysis [35] that
accounted for shuffling (non-collinearity) of locally conserved sequences suggested that the number of conserved
elements may be several fold higher than collinear alignments detect, particularly between distant vertebrate
relatives, such as mammals and fish.
Trans-acting factors (transcription factors or TFs) also
show examples of striking conservation, such as among
the homeotic factors, and diversifying selection [36].
Studies comparing expression patterns between human
and chimpanzee liver found that TF genes were enriched
among the genes with greatest human-specific increase in
expression levels [37,38], supporting arguments for
alteration of trans-regulatory architecture as a driving
evolutionary mechanism [39]. On the other hand, in the
Drosophila developmental transition, expression of transcription factor genes is more evolutionarily stable than
expression of their targets, on average [40]. The fact that
enhancers will often function similarly in fish and
mammals, even when the enhancer itself is not conserved,
indicates that mechanisms underlying cell-specific and
developmental expression are likely to be widely
conserved across vertebrates [41,42].
Global trends in conservation of gene expression, conservation of cis-regulatory sequence and relationships between
the two are not completely understood [13,39,41], partly
because the cis-regulatory ‘lexicon’ (that is, how TF binding
sites combine to form enhancers) remains mostly unknown, testing individual enhancers is tedious and
expensive, and many vertebrates are not amenable to
genetic experimentation. These issues are of both academic
and practical consequence: in addition to our curiosity
about the origin and distinctive characteristics of the human
species, primary sequence conservation is widely used to
identify regulatory mechanisms. We reasoned that
expression profiling data from species spanning much
greater phylogenetic distance than humans and mice, and
thus having greater opportunity for both neutral drift and
positive selection, would allow assessment of the degree of
conservation of tissue gene expression among all
vertebrates, and a comparison of the conservation of expression to the conservation of nonexonic primary sequence.
Here, we describe a survey of gene expression in adult
tissues and organs in the main vertebrate clades: mammals,
avians/reptiles, amphibians and fish. Our analyses demonstrate that core tissue-specific gene expression patterns are
conserved across all major vertebrate lineages, but that the
correspondence between conservation of expression and
amount of conserved nonexonic sequence is weak overall,
at least at a level that is detectable by current alignment
approaches.

Results
Tissue-specific gene expression is broadly correlated across
vertebrates
To examine gene expression in a broad range of vertebrates,
we collected a compendium of gene expression datasets,
consisting of previously published datasets for human [43]
and mouse [44], and newly generated datasets containing
20 tissues each from chicken (Gallus gallus), frog (Xenopus
tropicalis) and pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis). Details of
the experiments are found in the Materials and methods;
lists of tissues are found in Additional data file 1. Clustering
analyses of each dataset separately (Additional data file 2)
shows that prominent tissue-specific expression patterns are
found in all vertebrates.
To ask whether tissue-specific gene expression patterns are
conserved among vertebrates, we focused on 1-1-1-1-1
orthologs (genes that are present in a single unambiguous
copy in each of the five genomes), because genes that have
undergone duplication events are subject to different
constraints from singletons [45,46]. Among 4,898 1-1-1-1-1
orthologs found by Inparanoid [47], 3,074 were measured
by microarrays in all ten common tissues of chicken, frog,
pufferfish, and mammals (human and mouse combined
expression - see Materials and methods). The expression
profiles of these 3,074 genes in analogous and functionally
related tissues in different species were more similar than
they were to those of unrelated tissues from the same
species (Figure 1), even for pufferfish, which diverged from
the other vertebrates in our study roughly 450 million years
ago (Mya), well before the divergence of frog (about
360 Mya) or chicken (about 310 Mya) [48]. Despite
differences in cognition and behavior between humans and
other species, overall gene expression in the brain is most
similar across the species studied compared with expression
in other tissues (median expression ratio Pearson
correlation (r) = 0.63), consistent with a previous study
comparing human and chimpanzee [49]. The relatively low
divergence of gene expression in brain is hypothesized to be
due to constraints imposed by the participation of neurons
in more functional interactions than cells in other tissues
[50]. In contrast, gene expression in the kidney was most
dissimilar between species (median expression ratio
Pearson r = 0.21), possibly reflecting evolution of kidney
function (see Discussion). A dendrogram for the ten
common tissues (with the same tissue measured in all five
datasets; Additional data file 3) shows clear segregation of
the data for heart/muscle, eye, central nervous system
(CNS), spleen, liver and stomach/intestine. Only the testis
and kidney datasets are split, each into two groups, with
pufferfish and/or frog forming the outlying group.
Additional data file 4 shows that, among these 3,074 genes,
the Gene Ontology (GO) processes enriched in tissues are

also generally conserved across the five species. We
conclude that programs of tissue-specific expression are
broadly conserved among vertebrates.

Thousands of individual tissue-specific gene expression events
are conserved across all vertebrate clades
We next sought to quantify the conservation of expression
of individual genes. We used two conceptually simple
measures intended to capture different aspects of conservation of expression. The first asks how often specific gene
expression events (instances in which gene X is expressed in
tissue Y) are conserved across all vertebrates. We refer to this
as the ‘binary measure’ because, to simplify statistical
analysis, we considered a fixed proportion of the normalized, ranked microarray intensities of genes in each tissue to
be expressed (‘1’), and analyzed the data using several such
proportions (1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2; Additional data file 5
contains the binary matrices). We then asked how often a
gene is expressed in all species in a given tissue (that is, a
fully conserved expression ‘event’). The proportion of
conserved expression events at different thresholds ranges
from 3% to 19.3% of all possible expression events, among
the 3,074 1-1-1-1-1 orthologs (Figure 2a), and the proportion of genes with at least one conservation event ranges
from 11% to 49.5% (Figure 2b), in all cases clearly exceeding permuted (negative control) datasets. On the basis of
the spread between blue and orange bars in Figure 2, about
10% of the 30,740 possible gene expression events are
conserved among all vertebrates, and at least 20% of all
1-1-1-1-1 orthologs participate in at least one such event.
This measure probably underestimates the conservation of
gene expression, because we surveyed only ten tissues and
because we have not considered lack of expression across all
species to represent an example of conserved expression.
The second measure we used was Pearson correlation across
the ten common tissues. As with the binary measure, we
found that gene expression across tissues between real
1-1-1-1-1 orthologs is more similar than randomly matched
genes in pairwise comparisons between species (Figure 3
shows results for other species versus human; Additional
data file 6 shows all pairwise comparisons, and also the
median of pufferfish versus all other species, to provide a
summary of overall conservation). The difference between
the real and random (permuted) lines in Figure 3 and
Additional data file 6 indicates that roughly 20% of all
1-1-1-1-1 orthologs display conserved expression - a proportion comparable to that obtained using the binary
measure. In fact, at r = 0.4, the apparent false discovery rate
is similar to that obtained with the 1/3 cutoff using the
binary measure (27.4% versus 34.5%), as is the number of
genes classified as having conserved expression (843 versus
1,062). The overlap between these two sets of genes is

Regardless of the method of comparison the same essential
conclusion is reached: a major component of tissue gene
expression has apparently remained intact since the
common ancestor of all vertebrates. A large fraction of genes
is encompassed; between the two measures (the binary
measure and the Pearson measure), 48.4% of all 1-1-1-1-1
orthologs (1,488/3,074) scored as having conserved expresion at about 30% apparent false discovery rate. Thus, in just
the ten common tissues we analyzed, gene expression is at
least partially conserved for at least a third of all unique
orthologs (48.4% x 0.7 = 33.9%) by at least one of our two
definitions of conservation. The expression of these 1,488
genes in modern-day lineages is shown in Figure 4. Most of
these genes have tissue-specific patterns of expression,
indicating that the genes we are identifying are not simply
ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes.

Although the focus of our study was to identify conserved
gene expression patterns, our data are consistent with
previous findings that divergence of gene expression scales
with evolutionary time [17,18] when averaged over all
genes (Figure 5a) or all tissues (Figure 5b; the same trend is
apparent in Figure 4 and Additional data file 3). Individual
tissue expression profiles show different evolutionary trajectories, however (Figure 5c), presumably reflecting diversity
in constraints on tissue function.

Conservation of expression does not correlate with
proportion or amount of conserved nonexonic sequence
We next asked what gene properties correlate with conservation of expression among the 3,074 measured unique
orthologs. We considered the following gene properties:
those that are contained in our data, that is, median

expression level and Shannon entropy as a measure of tissue
specificity and preferential expression in individual tissues;
GO annotations; and sequence properties, that is, length of
gene, size of encoded protein, presence of a DNA-binding
domain (for known and predicted TFs), sequence conservation of encoded protein (pairwise BLASTP bit score) and

amount of conserved nonexonic sequence (measured in
several ways) (Additional data files 7 and 8; see Materials
and methods for details).
Several observations emerged from this analysis. First, the
genes with the highest expression similarity between species
are most often genes expressed in a highly tissue-specific
manner in tissues with specialized functions. Although the
Pearson correlation is heavily influenced by extreme values,
thus giving higher weight to tissue-specific pairs, most of
these high scoring genes were also classified as conserved by
our binary measure. Among the 50 genes with highest
median pairwise Pearson correlation of expression are
structural components of the eye lens, liver-synthesized
proteins involved in the complement system and blood
coagulation, and neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. This observation is supported by the GO categories
enriched among genes with high expression similarity, such
as synaptic transmission (GO:0007268), visual perception
(GO:0007601), wound healing (GO:0042060) and muscle
development (GO:0007517) (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test
(WMW) p-values 1.55 x 10-4, 2.36 x 10-3, 2.24 x 10-3 and
4.98 x 10-5, respectively; Additional data file 8). In contrast,
we did not find any evidence that the expression of TFs (228
of the 3,074 measured orthologs) is more or less conserved
than that of non-TFs, in contrast to previous reports of both
higher [38] and lower [40] rates of evolution of TF
expression. A slightly lower proportion of TFs did seem to
show conservation events relative to non-TFs using the
binary measure, but this difference is due to the fact that TFs
are expressed in fewer tissues: the difference is not seen
when comparing TFs and non-TFs with similar overall
expression levels (data not shown).
It is widely believed that conserved nonexonic sequence
often serves a cis-regulatory function, and it follows that a
larger amount of conserved nonexonic sequence might
correlate with a higher probability of conserved expression.
However, we found that the correspondence was very weak:
for example, for the binary model, we obtained Spearman
correlations of -0.086 and 0.0029 with the number of
nonexonic bases in Phastcons conserved regions [28] and in
ultraconserved elements (UCEs) [26], respectively; for the
Pearson model, these correlations were 0.054 and 0.0075,
respectively. Similar results were obtained when proportion
of bases replaced number of bases (Figure 6a,b). The handful of outlying points in the upper right of Figure 6b includes
several TFs, a subset of which are known to have an
exceptional degree of nonexonic sequence conservation [26].
We reasoned that pervasive shuffling might obscure most of
the cis-regulatory elements, particularly in pufferfish. In

http://jbiol.com/content/8/3/33

order to address this possibility, we developed a technique
similar to that of Sanges et al. [35] to detect shuffled
conserved sequence elements (SCEs), which may be noncollinear, across the five species (see Materials and methods
for details). Among the total 4,898 1-1-1-1-1 orthologs, we
identified 491,028, 457,074, 79,001, 54,134 and 11,731
SCEs in human, mouse, chicken, frog and pufferfish with
median lengths of 164, 80, 68, 68 and 65 nucleotides,
respectively. These SCEs showed good overlap with those in
[35] (75.5% of the sequences in [35] within regions we
aligned were identified as SCEs in our analysis) and they
were calibrated to minimize false positives (see Materials
and methods). However, we still did not observe a strong
relationship between the degree of conservation and the
proportion or number of aligned bases in each species
(median Spearman correlation: -0.062 and 0.042 for binary
and Pearson models, respectively, versus proportion of
aligned nonexonic bases in each species; Figure 6c,d; similar
correlations are obtained with number of aligned nonexonic bases).
We also examined the correlations between nonexonic
sequence conservation and expression correlation at
varying evolutionary distances from human. Although
correlations remain weak (Figure 7a), we did find that
genes in the highest quartile of sequence conservation had
a significantly higher distribution of expression correlation
than those in the lowest quartile, for all pairwise
comparisons except human versus pufferfish (Figure 7b).
However, in all comparisons, there are many genes with
little sequence conservation and high expression correlation, and vice versa. In fact, among the 173 genes with
the most highly conserved expression in our study by both
measures we applied (those in the top 1/6 by the binary
measure and with median Pearson r ≥ 0.5), most (102)
have no nonexonic conserved sequence in fish, on the basis
of our SCEs. The expression of these 102 genes in the ten
common tissues in the representatives of all modern
lineages is shown in Figure 8.
Because TF binding sites are degenerate, it is conceivable
that these genes have a high number of conserved TF
binding sites, despite their lack of primary sequence conservation. To examine this possibility we used Enhancer
Element Locator (EEL) [51] to align TF binding sites defined
by 138 motif models downloaded from the JASPAR database [52]. Over all 4,804 aligned human/pufferfish
ortholog pairs, the number of genes that scored highly using
EEL was only slightly higher with real ortholog pairs than
with randomly assigned orthologs with similar amounts of
nonexonic associated sequence in both genomes (p = 0.24,

Chan et al.

demonstrate that there is conservation of core vertebrate
tissue gene expression. Our analysis almost certainly underestimates the proportion of genes with conserved expression
patterns, because our analysis focused on only ten large
adult tissues in mature animals in captivity. Nonetheless,
our results already provide an index of several thousand
highly conserved tissue gene expression events and a picture
of core gene expression in major tissues and organs of the
common progenitor of all vertebrates, which most likely
resembled the expression patterns shown in Figure 4.
In our analysis, some biological processes emerged as more
highly conserved than others. Genes involved in the more
conserved processes on the whole tend to be preferentially
expressed in tissues with a limited number of cell types
(brain, eye, liver, heart and muscle) that carry out specialized functions particular to those tissues. This finding is
consistent with the notion that mechanisms underlying
important biological processes should be conserved across
taxa [53]. It is likely that the conservation of gene
expression in these tissues extends beyond the base of vertebrates; coexpression of neuronal genes, for example, is
observed as far as nematodes [54]. Genes expressed in
tissues subject to greater environmental influence (such as
intestine, stomach and spleen) may be more likely to take
on new roles and diverge in expression as means of
adaptation. We find gene expression similarity in the testis
across vertebrates to be relatively low compared with other
tissues, in support of earlier observations of accelerated
evolution of testis gene expression in Drosophila [55] and
primates [49], and consistent with mating competition and
speciation. We also note that relatively low conservation of
gene expression in the kidney is consistent with its divergent
function; in teleosts, the kidney is a major lymphoid organ
[56].
Our finding that the correlation between the amount of
conserved nonexonic sequence and conservation of gene
expression is low underscores the apparent malleability of
the cis-regulatory ‘lexicon’ [32,35,57]. It is easy to rationalize cases in which there is conserved sequence but little or
no conservation of expression in our study, because it is
possible that the majority of conserved sequence identified
is either not cis-regulatory, is functioning as cis-regulatory in
a context that we have not measured and/or regulates neighboring genes. What is most striking is that many genes with
the highest conserved tissue-specific expression have almost
no nonexonic conserved sequence outside mammals.
Divergence in trans-regulatory architecture does not provide
a satisfying explanation for this observation: although there
are examples in which the binding specificity of TFs evolves
[58,59], as a general rule the individual monomeric TF

http://jbiol.com/content/8/3/33

sequence specificities seem to be unchanged over large
evolutionary distances [60], and DNA-contacting residues
are often the most conserved [61]. The fact that conservation of TF expression is comparable to that of other genes
with similar levels of tissue specificity also supports the
notion that many ancestral vertebrate regulatory mechanisms are still in use. Moreover, enhancers can be functional across large evolutionary distances (for example,
human reporters in zebrafish), even when the enhancers are
not conserved, or are below the threshold of detection by
current alignment techniques [42].
Understanding the mechanisms underlying conservation of
expression patterns is a major challenge in our understanding of evolution, and of genome function and gene
regulation: even within a single genome, it is difficult to
find cis-regulatory modules shared by coexpressed genes,
indicating that there are many ways to achieve the same
expression output. We propose that our catalog of conserved (and non-conserved) expression will be useful to test
ideas regarding enhancer definition. In particular, we predict
that the small size of pufferfish genes and knowledge of the
expression of TFs in each tissue may facilitate searches for
enhancers on the basis of density and arrangement of TF
binding sites, rather than primary sequence alignment
[34,62]. These and other techniques require experimental
data for training and testing, and we now provide such data
for tens of thousands of genes across the vertebrate lineage,
including several thousand unique orthologs.

Materials and methods
Data availability
Data tables including microarray data, probe sequences, the
1-1-1-1-1 ortholog list, Phastcons information, UCE information, GO annotations and novel non-collinear alignments are found in the Additional data files and also on our
project website [63].

Tissue sources
Five chickens (three young females, one in-lay adult female
and one rooster) were obtained from Sunnybrook Health
Sciences Centre, Toronto, Canada. The bursa of Fabricius
and thymus were dissected from the young females. The
oviduct and ovaries were dissected from the in-lay adult
female and the testis dissected from the rooster. Approximately 75 adult female and five adult male frogs were
obtained from Nasco (Atkinson, USA), housed in 20 L
aquariums at 20°C and fed a diet of Aquamax Grower 600
trout food (Purina Mills, Gray Summit, USA). Exactly 100
green spotted pufferfish, of unknown age and sex, described
as caught wild in Malaysia, were purchased from Aquarium

Services Warehouse Outlets (Thornhill, Canada) and
housed in a single 120 gallon (453 L) aquarium tank at
room temperature. Their markings, size (about 6-7 cm) and
behavior matched descriptions of Tetraodon nigroviridis. The
fish were fed frozen brine shrimp twice a day.

Tissue collection and mRNA isolation
Animal handling and euthanization procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the University of
Toronto. Tissue processing and mRNA extraction were as
described previously [44]. Tissues collected are listed in
Additional file 1. All fish and frogs were anaesthetized by
adding 35 ml of a 1:10 clove oil (Rougier Pharma, Mirabel,
Canada):ethanol mixture to 1.5 L tank water containing a
single animal. Following cessation of movement (15-20 s),
they were euthanized by decapitation. Chickens were
euthanized by barbiturate injection followed by decapitation.

Microarray design, processing and data collection
Oligonucleotide microarrays (60-mer) were customdesigned by us and manufactured by Agilent Technologies
to survey the expression of a set of known and predicted
mRNAs compiled from Ensembl [64] version 37 and JGI
(for X. tropicalis, v3.0) corresponding to 24,877, 25,594 and
25,937 known and predicted loci in Tetraodon, chicken and
X. tropicalis, respectively, using 41,533, 41,534 and 41,523
probes. cDNA synthesis, labeling reactions and microarray
processing procedures were performed as described
previously [44]. Each tissue was assayed in duplicate, in
fluor-reversed pairs with biological replicates and averaged
(average Pearson correlation between replicate arrays =
0.89). Using a previously described procedure to define
expression [44], 72%, 77% and 89% of genes on the arrays
were detected in at least one of the tissues profiled in
chicken, frog and pufferfish, respectively, with 40%, 33%
and 52% of genes detected in each tissue, on average
(Additional data file 10), comparable to previously reported
figures of 52% and 59% in human and mouse [44,65]. Our
percentages may be lower because many predicted genes
were included on the arrays. Microarray-based expression
data for 55 mouse tissues [44] and 60 human tissues [43]
were downloaded and mapped to Ensembl v37 identifiers
by aligning probe sequences to Ensembl transcript
sequences using BLAT [66]. Expression similarity was
calculated using the relative expression levels or ‘ratios’
(median-subtracted, variance stabilization-normalized asinh
intensities) as well as using the absolute values (normalized intensities) in each tissue, as indicated in the Results
and figures. All new microarray data have been uploaded to
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database,
accession numbers [GEO:GSE12974, GEO:GSE12975,

Chan et al. 33.13

GEO:GSE12976], and are also found on our project website
[63].

Determination of gene orthology
relationships
Inparanoid [67] was used to analyze each possible pairwise
all-versus-all protein BLAST [68] comparison between all
known proteins for each of the five vertebrate species in
version 37 of the Ensembl database to delineate pairwise
gene orthology relationships. These relationships were then
assembled into unique 1-1-1-1-1 ortholog groups across the
five species using custom Perl scripts in an approach
analogous to that of Alexeyenko et al. [69].

Gene Ontology analysis
GO annotations were downloaded from Ensembl BioMart
[70] for each species. Annotations for chicken, frog and
pufferfish (Tetraodon) were further supplemented by
mapping the corresponding mouse annotations by any type
of orthology as defined by Ensembl. Annotations were uppropagated and terms with few or too many annotated
genes were removed as described previously [44]. All GO
WMW analyses performed across the set of unique orthologs were done with human annotations.

Definition of expression conservation events in each gene
and tissue using the binary measure
We split each set of orthologs in each tissue in each species
on the basis of their measured normalized expression
intensities according to the following thresholds: top 1/2,
top 1/3, top 1/4, top 1/5 and top 1/6. Because the human
and mouse datasets were designed independently from
those of the other three species, there were orthologous
genes with missing measurements. In order to facilitate
comparison between as many unique orthologs between
the five species as possible, we applied variance stabilizing
normalization [71] to the human and mouse orthologs in
order to make them comparable, under the assumption that
gene expression is mostly conserved between the mammals
relative to the rest of the vertebrate phylogeny. We combined the human and mouse ortholog data by averaging to
obtain a set of 3,074 unique orthologs with measured
microarray data across ten common tissues.

Calculating Shannon entropy as a measure of tissue
specificity
Shannon entropy, which measures the degree of overall
tissue specificity of a gene, was calculated as described by
Schug et al. [72]. Briefly, the relative expression of a gene
g in a tissue t relative to its expression given in N tissues
is defined as pt|g = wg,t/Σ1 ≤ t ≤ N wg,t , where wg,t is the expres-

Chan et al.

sion level of the gene g in tissue t. The Shannon entropy of a
gene’s expression distribution is then calculated as
Hg = Σ1 ≤ t ≤ N -pt|glog2pt|g . This value is expressed in bits and
ranges from zero to log2(10) genes expressed in a single
tissue and uniformly expressed in all the common tissues
examined, respectively.

Definition of overlap between nonexonic regions associated
with human 1-1-1-1-1 orthologs and Phastcons elements
and UCEs
Locations of Phastcons elements [28] and UCEs [26] were
downloaded from the hg17 version of the UCSC genome
browser [73] and from the supplementary website [74] of
Bejerano et al. [26]. The number of Phastcons elements and
UCEs (and the number of bases) that overlapped all
nonexonic sequences, including intergenic sequences, up to
50 kb upstream and downstream of each human 1-1-1-1-1
ortholog was tabulated using custom Perl scripts. The
proportion of Phastcons and UCE bases covered in noncoding regions was calculated as the number of bases out of
50 kb of flanking bases upstream and downstream of each
gene with coding regions masked out.

Definition and calculation of other gene features and
statistical comparisons to expression conservation
A measure of protein sequence conservation between two
species was derived by performing pairwise BLASTP [68]
between the protein-coding sequences (downloaded from
Ensembl EnsMart [70]) of an orthologous gene pair and
retaining the bit score. The median bit score was taken as a
measure of protein sequence conservation over all species.
Average and maximum expression level and the expression
rank within tissues were calculated in the expected manner
for each gene across the ten common tissues. The number of
bases in an aligned conserved element (aligned as described
below) was obtained by summing the number of bases in
each species within a five-way gapped alignment between
all species. The total number of aligned bases in an aligned
conserved element is the sum of counts in each species. TF
genes within the set of unique orthologs were defined by
the presence of a DNA-binding domain in the mouse
protein sequence in the Pfam database [75]. Our list of TF
genes is given in Additional data file 11. Conservation of
expression was measured by either our binary or Pearson
measures, both of which yield a real value (an integer
between zero and six in the case of the binary method).
With the exception of GO annotations and TF identities, all
measures for each gene are compiled in Additional data
file 7; TFs are listed separately in Additional data file 11.
Comparisons of properties with real values were made by

Spearman p-value, and these are also given in Additional
data file 7 and shown graphically in Additional data file 12.
Comparisons of categorical properties were made by WMW
p-value and are given in Additional data file 8.

Multiple sequence alignment algorithm
All repeat-masked intronic, 3’ untranslated region and intergenic non-coding sequence upstream and downstream of
protein-coding sequences in orthologous groups that we
have identified using the Inparanoid algorithm [47] were
downloaded from Ensembl v37 [64]. Using LAGAN [76],
we built a multiple global alignment across all of the
genomic sequences within each set of unique orthologs to
identify conserved non-coding elements in all species. We
used up to 50 kb of upstream and downstream sequence,
up to the point that the transcript of another annotated
gene was encountered.
We initially applied a conservation cutoff of 55% in a 50
nucleotide window to search for conserved regions between
the human and the orthologous genomes. After removing
conserved elements that were annotated as exonic, we
extracted each sequence element in the alignment that was
conserved only in a subset of the genomes and built the
most parsimonious ancestral reconstruction of each of the
sequences using Fitch’s algorithm, treating the gap character
as a fifth symbol. This was then used to search against the
other orthologous genome(s) using the CHAOS aligner [77]
with very sensitive parameters. The Smith-Waterman
threshold was varied between 40 and 60 (60 is the default
conservation setting for the BLASTZ [78] alignment
program; this setting is both relatively sensitive and very
specific, and thus almost all hits above this threshold will
be real). This homology filtering step was used to identify
non-collinear conserved sequences that may have changed
position and orientation relative to exons over evolutionary
time. In contrast to the method used by Sanges et al. [35],
we tried using both the mouse and the chicken sequence as
the homology filter. By using the chicken as the base
organism we were able to significantly lower the false
positive rate (only one decoy (i.e. permuted gene identity)
sequence with a score above 45), while our true positive rate
was unchanged (all of the human/frog and
human/pufferfish conserved regions recovered with mouse
as the base were also recovered with pufferfish (Tetraodon)
as the base).
Through the procedure described above, our approach takes
advantage of the conservation of order of the conserved
elements when no rearrangements have taken place, and the

Journal of Biology 2009, 8:33

Journal of Biology 2009,

http://jbiol.com/content/8/3/33

flexibility of aligning less conserved regions that have been
shuffled around in the genome. By running Fitch’s algorithm on the aligned sequences (unlike the Sanges et al. [35]
approach of simply using the mouse sequence as input to
CHAOS) we increased the sensitivity of our alignment
technique. In particular, it was easier to align Tetraodon
sequence to the common ancestor of human and chicken
genomes than to either genome individually.

Enhancer Element Locator
We scanned the nonexonic sequence associated (as defined
for the multiple sequence alignment algorithm) with 4,804
human/fish ortholog pairs for conserved TF binding sites by
applying EEL [51] using the default parameters to perform a
local pairwise TF binding site alignment. We did not
attempt to align the 94 (of 4,898) ortholog pairs for which
one of the orthologs appears in the intron of another gene.
The motif models input into EEL were the 138 models
returned by JASPAR webserver [52] on 27 February 2009.
The score of only the best alignment from each orthologous
gene group was captured and was used to construct a
distribution of 4,804 gene group alignment scores. We also
constructed a shuffled (negative control) distribution of EEL
scores by attempting to align the TF binding sites between
the human non-coding sequences in each of the ortholog
pairs and those of six non-orthologous Tetraodon genes.
These genes were selected among the other 4,803 nonorthologous paired Tetraodon genes to be the six with the
most similar amount of non-coding sequence as the proper
ortholog, under the constraint that three of the genes had to
have less non-coding sequence and three had to have more
non-coding sequence. As evidence that the EEL analysis is
detecting some very limited degree of conservation, we note
that the distribution of EEL scores is slightly higher in real
than in randomly assigned orthologs starting around an EEL
score of 175; in particular, we estimate that 1.3% (63 of
4,084) of all EEL scores are non-random by subtracting the
proportion of random scores above 175 (39.8%) from the
proportion of real scores above 175 (41.1%).
