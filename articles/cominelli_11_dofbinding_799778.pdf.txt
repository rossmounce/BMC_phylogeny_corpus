Abstract
Background: We previously demonstrated that the Arabidopsis thaliana AtMYB60 protein is an R2R3MYB
transcription factor required for stomatal opening. AtMYB60 is specifically expressed in guard cells and downregulated at the transcriptional levels by the phytohormone ABA.
Results: To investigate the molecular mechanisms governing AtMYB60 expression, its promoter was dissected
through deletion and mutagenesis analyses. By studying different versions of AtMYB60 promoter::GUS reporter
fusions in transgenic plants we were able to demonstrate a modular organization for the AtMYB60 promoter.
Particularly we defined: a minimal promoter sufficient to confer guard cell-specific activity to the reporter gene; the
distinct roles of different DOF-binding sites organised in a cluster in the minimal promoter in determining guard
cell-specific expression; the promoter regions responsible for the enhancement of activity in guard cells; a
promoter region responsible for the negative transcriptional regulation by ABA. Moreover from the analysis of
single and multiple mutants we could rule out the involvement of a group of DOF proteins, known as CDFs,
already characterised for their involvement in flowering time, in the regulation of AtMYB60 expression.
Conclusions: These findings shed light on the regulation of gene expression in guard cells and provide new
promoter modules as useful tools for manipulating gene expression in guard cells, both for physiological studies
and future biotechnological applications.

Background
Land plants uptake carbon dioxide for photosynthesis
and lose water vapour by transpiration through stomatal
pores, present on the surface of leaves and stems. The
opening and closure of the pore is mediated by turgordriven volume changes of two surrounding guard cells,
whose pressure is dynamically adjusted according to
environmental and hormonal cues. In response to abiotic
stresses, such as drought or high salinity, one of the most
rapid responses of plants is the closure of stomata,
mediated by the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), to prevent
excessive water loss by transpiration (reviewed in [1]).
The genetic manipulation of stomatal activity is emerging as a promising approach to reduce the water
requirement of crops, and to enhance productivity
under stress conditions [2]. Proper engineering of

stomatal responses requires the use of guard cell-specific
promoters, or the identification of guard cell-specific
mutants, to avoid undesirable side effects on plant
growth and productivity.
Several promoters that confer guard cell-specific gene
expression or enhanced gene expression in guard cells
have been isolated through different methods: functional
characterization of single genes [3-9]; large scale geneor enhancer-trap screens [10-12]. Moreover transcriptomic and proteomic studies have identified additional
candidates [13-16]. Nevertheless the majority of these
promoters are not guard cell-specific, as they drive the
expression of reporter genes in other cell types, including the vascular tissues [6,10,17,18], flower organs [8,9]
or starch containing cells [5], significantly reducing the
number of true guard cell-specific full size promoters
[3,10,14,19,20]. Most importantly, a detailed experimental analysis of guard cell-specific promoters has been
performed only in very few cases [11,12,14].

A true guard cell-specific promoter is driving expression of the Arabidopsis AtMYB60 (At1g08810) gene
[10,19,21,22]. We have previously shown that AtMYB60
is expressed in guard cells [10], and the complete 5’ and
3’ intergenic genomic regions of this gene, cloned
respectively upstream and downstream to reporter
genes, were able to drive specific expression in guard
cells [10,19]. Guard cell specificity of the AtMYB60 promoter has been also demonstrated by Nagy et al. (2009)
and by Meyer et al (2010), who used this promoter to
complement the mrp5-1 mutant phenotype exclusively
in guard cells, and to specifically express the AtLMT12
protein at high levels in guard cells, respectively.
Very little information is available concerning promoter cis-elements regulating guard cell-specific
expression [8,10-12,14,16]. DOF-binding sites have
been suggested to have a role in such a regulation
[8,10-12]. DOF (DNA binding with One Finger) proteins are plant specific transcription factors involved in
light, phytohormones and pathogen signalling and
responses as well as seed development (reviewed by
[23]). A role for [T/A]AAAG DOF-binding sites in
mediating gene expression in guard cells has been
experimentally defined only for the potato KST1 gene
[8]. However, in Arabidopsis the role of DOF-motifs in
controlling guard cell expression is still controversial
[10-12]. The study performed on the potato KST1 promoter [8] and the bioinformatic analysis performed on
several guard-cell specific Arabidopsis promoters [10]
suggest that the presence of clusters of DOF cis-elements, rather than their absolute number, is important
to confer guard cell-specificity to a promoter region
[10]. Yet, the role of DOF-binding sites in driving
guard cell expression in Arabidopsis and the hypothesis of cluster organization remains to be experimentally investigated.
The guard-cell specific AtMYB60 promoter presents
several DOF clusters, making it an ideal model to test
the hypothesis that DOF clusters are important for
guard cell-specific expression. Moreover the AtMYB60
expression is modulated by different environmental cues
such as light, dark and drought stress [19], suggesting
the presence of different cis-elements controlling these
transcriptional responses. In this report we aimed to isolate the cis-elements responsible for the AtMYB60 guard
cell specific expression. We generated Arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying truncated or mutagenised AtMYB60
promoter versions fused to the GUS reporter gene.
Using a combination of histochemical and expression
analysis we were able to identify a minimal promoter
necessary and sufficient to drive guard cell specific
expression. Using the same tools, we were also able to
map a region required for ABA-mediated repression.

Results
In-silico analysis of the AtMYB60 promoter

In a previous study, we demonstrated that the complete
5’ and 3’ AtMYB60 intergenic genomic regions - cloned
upstream and downstream of the b-glucoronidase (GUS)
reporter gene, respectively - could specifically drive
strong GUS activity in stomata of Arabidopsis seedlings
and adult plants [19]. No GUS signals were detected in
any other cell type or in tissues devoid of stomata [19].
To investigate the possible cis-acting elements that
regulate AtMYB60 expression, we surveyed the genomic
region upstream of the AtMYB60 translational start
codon for the presence of known transcription factor
binding sites using the PLACE software [24]. Our analysis produced a significant enrichment in the [A/T]
AAAG motifs in the AtMYB60 promoter compared to
the average distribution of [A/T]AAAG oligos in intergenic regions throughout the Arabidopsis genome (P <
0.01) (Figure 1). Interestingly, these [A/T]AAAG motifs,
have been shown to be involved in the regulation of
guard cell expression of the potato potassium channel
KST1 gene [8]. Also, clusters of [A/T]AAAG motifs,
required for the binding of DOF-type transcription factors [25], were over represented in different guard cellsspecific promoters [6,10,12]. In particular, Galbiati and
colleagues suggested, as guard cell-specific cis-element,
a cluster of at least three [A/T]AAAG motifs located on
the same strand within a region of 100 bp [10]. Using
the criteria previously described by Galbiati and collaborators (2008), we found three of these guard cell-specific clusters in the 5’ intergenic region of the AtMYB60
gene (Figure 1), suggesting a conserved mechanism for
guard cell specific expression.
Identification of the AtMYB60 minimal promoter

To gain more insights into the cis-elements that regulate
the AtMYB60 expression in guard cells, we produced a
set of Arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying the complete
1,307 bp 5’ intergenic region upstream of the translational start codon fused to the reporter GUS (construct
-1,307::GUS, Figure 2A). GUS staining analysis of 15
independent T2 lines revealed that this region contains
all the cis-acting elements required for expression of the
reporter in stomata (Figure 2B), while no GUS signals
were detected in any other cell type or in tissues devoid
of stomata (Additional file 1).
Next, we made a series of 5’ deletions of the -1,307 bp
genomic region to define the minimum sequence length
required for the expression in guard cells (Figure 2A).
These truncated promoters (fused to the GUS gene)
were stably transferred to Arabidopsis and 10 to 15
independent T2 transgenic lines were analysed in detail.

designated as +1. The ATG is in bold. The 5’ UTR is in lower case letters. The DOF-binding sites are grey boxed, the W-box, considered in the
text, is white boxed. Clusters of DOF-binding sites, as defined by Galbiati and colleagues (2008), are underlined. The CAAGTTG motif described as

position -619 (construct -619::GUS), -472 (-472::GUS),
or -366 (-366::GUS) from the ATG codon, did not alter
expression of the reporter in guard cells located on both
vegetative and floral organs (Figure 2B). Further deletions (to position -262) indicated that the 262 bp proximal region was sufficient to drive expression of the
reporter in stomata (Figure 2B). However, the removal
of the region between -262 bp and -205 bp (construct
-205::GUS) completely abolished GUS activity in guard
cell (Figure 2B). Transgenic lines carrying the -205::GUS
fusion did not show GUS staining in any other cell type,
even after prolonged staining (up to 48 h, Figure 2B).
This finding suggests that the 57 bp region located
between positions -262 and -205 contains cis-elements
essential for expression in stomatal guard cells. Based
on these results, we defined the -262 bp region
upstream of the ATG codon as the minimal promoter
of the AtMYB60 gene.
To thoroughly investigate quantitative differences in
GUS expression among lines carrying different deletion:
reporter constructs, we determined the relative amount
of GUS transcript by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR).
mRNA samples derived from two representative independent lines (A and B) were analysed for each construct (Figure 2C). Lines harbouring the 1,307 bp 5’
intergenic region or the -619 deletion fused to the

reporter, did not show any significant differences in
their GUS transcript accumulation. Conversely, deletions
to position -472 and -366 resulted in a two-fold
decrease in GUS expression compared to the -1,307::
GUS line, while deletion to position -262 resulted in a
five-fold decrease (Figure 2C, p < 0.01). These results
indicate that one or more sequences with function of
enhancer are present in the genomic region between
-619 bp and -472 bp and between -472 and -262 from
the ATG of AtMYB60. In accordance with the results
obtained from the histochemical analysis, qRT-PCR
experiments did not detect significant GUS transcripts
accumulation in lines carrying the -205::GUS fusion.
Site-directed mutagenesis of the AtMYB60 minimal
promoter

Promoter deletion experiments indicate that the
AtMYB60 minimal promoter region (construct -262::
GUS) contains all the cis-acting elements required to
sustain expression of a reporter gene in guard cells. This
region encompasses the [A/T]AAAG cluster proximal to
the ATG codon, which consists of four AAAAG DOFbinding sites (Figures 1 and 3A). In addition, the
PLACE software identified in this region a single Wbox, corresponding to the binding site of WRKY transcription factors [26], located upstream of the [A/T]

AAAG cluster (Figure 3A). To address the functional
significance of the individual cis-elements present in the
AtMYB60 minimal promoter, we evaluated the effects of
targeted nucleotide substitutions on GUS expression
(Figure 3A). Mutated versions of the minimal promoter
were generated by PCR and fused to GUS and at least
30 T2 independent transgenic lines for each mutated
promoter::GUS combination were visually scored and
classified to reflect their relative guard-cell specific GUS
staining. A representative example of each category is
provided in Figure 3C.
We initially tested the role of the single W-box ciselement, by replacing the consensus sequence TTGAC,
with the non-functional TTGAA motif [27]. Lines carrying the mutated W-box (mW::GUS) showed similar
levels of GUS expression to the wild-type promoter,
indicating that W-box does not contribute to mediate
gene expression in guard cells (Figure 3B). Next, we
produced mutant promoters in which single DOF motifs
within the [A/T]AAAG cluster were converted to the
unrelated CGCGA sequence. Inactivation of the most
distal AAAAG site relative to the ATG (hereinafter
referred to as DOF1) resulted in a dramatic decrease of
GUS expression (mDOF1::GUS construct, Figure 4B).
30% of the lines carrying the mDOF1::GUS construct
did not show GUS expression, whereas the remaining
70% only showed weak staining, thus indicating a crucial
role for DOF1 in regulating AtMYB60 expression in
guard cells (Figure 3B). Mutations of the second, third
or fourth most proximal AAAAG site (hereinafter
referred to as DOF2, DOF3 and DOF4, respectively),
resulted in a reduced GUS expression, although to a lesser extent than the one in the DOF1 (Figure 4B,
mDOF2::GUS, mDOF3::GUS and mDOF4::GUS plants).
In particular, none of the 30 mDOF2::GUS transgenic
lines displayed strong expression of the reporter, nearly
70% showed intermediate expression, 25% showed weak
expression and the remaining 5% did not show any GUS
staining (Figure 3B). A comparable distribution among
strong, intermediate and weak lines was obtained from
the analysis of the mDOF3::GUS and mDOF4::GUS
plants (Figure 3B).
To establish whether DOF-binding sites could exert
additive roles in mediating gene expression in stomata
we produced a second series of promoters, in which two
AAAAG motifs were mutated simultaneously. Mutations
of DOF1 and DOF2 (mDOF(1+2)::GUS), DOF1 and
DOF3 (mDOF(1+3)::GUS) or DOF1 and DOF4 (mDOF(1
+4)::GUS) completely inactivated the minimal promoter,
as GUS expression was abolished in all the mDOF(1+2)::
GUS, mDOF(1+3)::GUS and mDOF(1+4)::GUS lines analysed (Figure 3B). Interestingly, the concurrent mutation
of DOF2 and DOF3 (mDOF(2+3)::GUS) resulted in a
strong, but yet not complete, inactivation of the

Page 6 of 13

promoter activity in guard cells, as 15% of the mDOF(2
+3)::GUS lines displayed weak expression of the reporter
in stomata. Likewise, concomitant inactivation of either
DOF2 and DOF4, or DOF3 and DOF4 did not completely eliminate GUS expression in guard cell (Figure 3B).
Taken together, these results indicate that the putative
[A/T]AAAG DOF-binding sites located in the AtMYB60
promoter are necessary to mediate its expression in
guard cells.
A single DOF cluster is sufficient to drive low expression
in guard cell

Our deletion analysis of the AtMYB60 promoter indicates that the 57 bp region between positions -262 and
-205 is essential for gene expression in stomatal guard
cells (Figure 2). This region contains the DOF1 cis-element required for guard cell expression as shown by
mutagenesis analysis results (Figure 3). To establish
whether this 57 bp region was sufficient to activate
expression in guard cells, we fused one (1x::GUS construct), two (2x::GUS) and four tandem copies (4x::GUS)
of the 57 bp fragment to the minimal CaMV35S promoter [28] upstream of the GUS reporter gene (Figure 4A),
effectively reconstructing an artificial DOF cluster containing one, two or four copies of the DOF1 element.
However, we did not observe GUS activity in any of the
30 independent stable transformants produced for each
construct, even after prolonged staining (data not
shown). These data were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis of independent lines carrying the 4x::GUS fusion
(Figure 4B), indicating that the multimerisation of the
DOF1 site per se is not sufficient to drive gene expression in guard cell. This might derive from an inappropriate organization and/or spatial distribution of the
different DOF elements in the context of the minimal
promoter. To test this hypothesis we made two 3’ deletions of the AtMYB60 minimal promoter: the -148-3’::
GUS and -137-3’::GUS constructs containing the first
three and four DOF-binding sites respectively of the
most proximal cluster fused upstream of the minimal
CaMV35S promoter (Figure 4B). Our initial histochemical analysis did not reveal any GUS positive lines (data
not shown). To substantiate this result we also performed a qRT-PCR analysis on fifteen independent lines
for each construct. Interestingly, eight lines out of fifteen showed a low but significant GUS transcript accumulation compared to the full length minimal promoter
(Figure 4B). These results suggest that the presence of
the cluster containing three or four DOF-binding sites is
sufficient to drive GUS activity in guard cells, even
though at a very low level. This finding implies that
other cis-elements present downstream of position -137
are required for the full functionality of the minimal
promoter.

regions deleted in AtMYB60 minimal promoter sequences.

The guard cell-related CDF1, CDF2, CDF3 and CDF5 DOFtype transcription factors do not regulate AtMYB60
expression in stomata

Target mutagenesis experiments of the AtMYB60 promoter demonstrated that [A/T]AAAG DNA consensus
motifs are essential cis-acting elements in the regulation
of AtMYB60 expression in guard cells. Consequently,
their cognate DOF proteins represent the most likely
candidates as trans-acting factors. As the Arabidopsis
genome contains 36 DOF-coding genes [23], candidate
DOF transcription factors involved in the regulation of
AtMYB60 expression should fulfil two criteria: they
should be expressed in guard cells and the loss of their
gene function should abolish or significantly down-regulate the expression of AtMYB60 in this cell type.

gene, involved in the regulation of photoperiodic flowering, has been shown to be highly expressed in the vascular tissue and guard cells [29]. We thus investigated the
expression of the AtMYB60 gene in the loss-of-function

cdf1-R allele. As shown in Additional file 2 we did not
detect significant differences in the accumulation of
AtMYB60 transcripts in homozygous cdf1-R plants compared with the wild type.
It is important to note that in photoperiodic flowering,
CDF1 acts redundantly with three other DOF proteins,
namely CDF2 (At5g39660), CDF3 (At3g47500) and
CDF5 (At1g69570) [30], belonging to the same phylogenetic group II [31]. Similarly to CDF1, promoter::GUS
analyses revealed that CDF2, CDF3 and CDF5 are
strongly expressed in guard cells.
We thus analysed the expression of AtMYB60 in single, double, triple and quadruple cdf mutants to determine the possible role of these additional candidate
CDF proteins. As for cdf1-R mutant, the level of expression of AtMYB60 was not significantly reduced in the
cdf2-1, cdf3-1 and cdf5-1 single mutants (Additional file
2). Likewise, AtMYB60 expression was not altered in
any of the double, triple or quadruple mutant combinations, indicating that, despite their expression in guard

sequence lacks the region responsible for negative regulation by ABA, as these lines did not show changes in
GUS expression in response to the hormone as shown
in Figure 5.
Taken together these data indicate that, although the
minimal promoter maintains the cis-elements necessary
for guard cell expression, it lacks the motifs that mediate the negative regulation by ABA, becoming ABAinsensitive. We can thus conclude that the region
between -366 and -262 contains elements necessary for
ABA down-regulation.

cells, these four CDF proteins are not trans-regulators of
AtMYB60 expression in stomata (Additional file 2).
Identification of a promoter region that negatively
responds to ABA

We previously reported that transcript accumulation of
the AtMYB60 gene is rapidly down-regulated by exogenous applications of the hormone ABA, which plays a
fundamental role in regulating gene expression in
response to drought stress [19]. To identify the promoter region responsible for the ABA-mediated AtMYB60
down-regulation, we applied ABA to the previously
described transgenic lines harbouring serial deletions of
the AtMYB60 promoter (Figure 2). Quantitative RTPCR analysis revealed a similar decrease in GUS transcript levels in transgenic lines carrying the full length
as well as the -619, -472 and -366::GUS fusions (Figure
5). The kinetic of down-regulation of the GUS transcript
was comparable to the one observed for the endogenous
gene AtMYB60 [19], indicating that -619, -472 and -366
promoters maintain the sequences responsible for transcriptional down-regulation by ABA. Also, these results
suggest that the CAAGTTG motif, present in the
AtMYB60 promoter between -619 and -613 (dotted
underlined in Figure 1), and recently described as overrepresented in ABA-repressed genes [16], does not play
a significant role in the ABA-dependent repression of
AtMYB60 expression. Rather, qRT-PCR experiments
performed on different independent lines carrying the
-246::GUS construct showed that the minimal promoter

Discussion
Very few guard cell-specific promoters have been
described to date [3,10,14,19,20]. Independent studies
demonstrated that the AtMYB60 promoter can be considered guard cell-specific, being sufficient to drive
expression of reporter genes specifically in guard cells
[19,21]. Moreover this promoter has also been used to
complement a mutant phenotype specifically in guard
cells [21], and to investigate subcellular localization
exclusively in guard cells [22]. In this study we identified
the AtMYB60 minimal promoter that is necessary and
sufficient to drive guard cell-specific expression.
DOF-binding sites are required for AtMYB60 guard-cells
expression

Our in silico analysis identified three DOF site clusters
(Figure 1). Initial deletion studies revealed a prominent
role for the most proximal DOF cluster (relative to the

ATG start codon). Site-directed mutagenesis showed
that the distal most DOF-binding site (DOF1 at position -210, Figure 3) plays a major role in driving guard
cell expression compared to other DOF motifs of the
same cluster (DOF2 at position -176, DOF3 at -159
and DOF4 at -147, Figure 3). These other DOF elements play partially additive roles, as clearly demonstrated by the combined mutagenesis of these sites and
DOF1 site which resulted in a drastically reduced GUS
activity (Figure 3). DOF-binding sites are thus key
determinants in mediating guard cell expression, in
accordance with the DOF cluster hypothesis we previously formulated [10]. A suggestion for a similar
involvement of DOF cis-elements in Arabidopsis
derives from the work of Gardner and colleagues
(2009) that identified DOF motifs in a region controlling guard cell expression. Other authors identified a
region enriched in DOF-binding sites in the guard cellspecific pGC1 promoter, although the mutation of a
single DOF site did not impair promoter activity [14].
Interestingly, a DOF cluster organization is present in
the promoter of the grape VvMYB60 gene, a putative
ortholog of AtMYB60, indicating a conservation of the
cluster structure during the evolution among
AtMYB60 orthologs [32]. The results reported by
Plesch and colleagues (2001) on the DOF motif organisation in the potato KST1 promoter highlight a more
general evolutionary conservation of this module in
the control of guard cell-specific activity of promoters.
Although we cannot rule out the possibility that
other unknown transcription factors might interact
with those same cis-elements, DOF factors represent
likely candidates as AtMYB60 regulators. The most
parsimonious hypothesis resulting from combining our
results indicates that DOF proteins act as positive regulators of AtMYB60. The potato StDOF1 protein has
been shown to bind in vitro to the guard cell specific
promoter of KST1 [8], while no data are available for
any Arabidopsis DOF proteins. Among the Arabidopsis
DOF genes, CDF1, CDF2, CDF3, and CDF5 (CDFs) are
expressed in guard cells [29]. However, singles and
multiple cdf mutants show a wild-type pattern of
AtMYB60 expression, ruling out their involvement in
AtMYB60 regulation (Additional file 2). The majority
of Arabidopsis DOF genes are expressed in guard cells
[33,34] and may thus act redundantly, as already
demonstrated among members of this family [30]. All
these aspects do not facilitate the identification of
obvious candidates as AtMYB60 regulators. We are
trying to identify the DOF genes involved in the regulation of AtMYB60 by analysis of its expression in
mutants of genes preferentially expressed in the guard
cells (http://bbc.botany.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.
cgi[33]).

Multiple cis-elements participate to enhance AtMYB60
guard-cells expression

Transcriptional GUS fusions, harbouring different deletions of the 5’ intergenic region to position -262 from
the ATG, conferred GUS activity exclusively in guard
cells (Figures 2 and Additional file 1). The activity of
these promoter regions is in apparent discrepancy with
the detection of AtMYB60 gene expression in seeds, as
revealed by available microarray analysis data [33,34]
and in roots, as recently reported [35]. One hypothesis
to explain this incongruity could be the presence of
other regulatory regions present outside the complete 5’
and 3’ intergenic regions flanking the AtMYB60 coding
sequence. Intron sequences, for example, may be
involved in such a regulation, as previously demonstrated for different plant genes ([36] and references
herein).
While guard-cell specific expression was invariably
maintained by functional AtMYB60 promoter variants,
the levels of expression varied considerably. In addition
to DOF-binding sites, other cis-elements are required to
boost the AtMYB60 expression. Indeed, an artificial
DOF1 binding site repeated in single or multiple copies
could not drive guard cell expression (Figure 4A). The
incorporation of the entire proximal DOF cluster (e.g.
-137-3’::GUS) resulted in a small but significant guard
cell transcriptional activity. Thus, other cis-elements
downstream of position -137 are required for full activity of the minimal promoter. It is known that cis-elements other than DOF-binding sites are involved in the
regulation of guard cell expression. In the case of the
guard cell-specific AtPDR3 gene no [A/T]AAAG clusters
were identified in a 1000-bp region upstream of the
ATG codon, suggesting the presence of other regulatory
units [10].
Modular organization of the AtMYB60 promoter

In this study we also investigated the regulation of the
AtMYB60 promoter activity in response to ABA. ABA
treatments induce global changes in gene expression in
Arabidopsis [16,37-40]. Transcriptomic analyses revealed
extensive regulation of gene expression by ABA also in
guard cells [13,14,16]. While cis-elements that positively
regulate the response to ABA have been functionally
characterised (for a review, see [41]), those that negatively regulate the response to ABA are largely
unknown. A CAA[G/C]TTG motif has been shown to
be over-represented in ABA-repressed gene promoters
and thus proposed for such a role [16,39]. The
AtMYB60 promoter contains one CAAGTTG motif
between -619 and -613 from the ATG, yet our results
do not support its proposed role as negative regulator of
ABA response. Conversely, a region between positions
-366 to -262 contained the entire requirement for the

ABA-mediated repression Figures 5 and 6. It has been
proposed that evolution may have favoured the differentiation of mechanisms for ABA down-regulation rather
than up-regulation, rendering more difficult for any
ABA-repression motif to achieve statistical significance
[16]. Our data may provide a valuable model system to
clarify the mechanism mediating ABA repression.
Our data suggests a modular organization for the
AtMYB60 promoter as summarised in Figure 6.
Through a serial deletion analysis, we defined the
AtMYB60 minimal promoter, sufficient to induce guard
cell-specific activity (construct -262::GUS, Figure 2). A
57 bp region, located between position -262 and position -205, is necessary to confer GUS activity in guard
cells (Figure 2A). We also identified two regions that
enhance the expression of the GUS gene between -619
bp and -472 bp and between -472 and -262 (Figure 2B
and 2C). Besides providing pieces of evidence for such
modular organization, our work indicates that the different portions of the AtMYB60 promoter may prove useful for manipulating gene expression in guard cells, with
the possibility to obtain different level of expression.
Moreover, the minimal promoter (whose activity is not
influenced by ABA) can be used for ABA-independent
expression of target genes in guard cells
Interestingly, both the full length and the minimal
promoters maintain their guard cell-specific activity in
heterologous systems, such as the crop species tomato
and tobacco (Francia, personal communication), thus
indicating the conservation of this cell-specific regulatory mechanism among different plant species. Moreover, preliminary results suggest that the AtMYB60
minimal promoter can be combined with other cis-regulatory modules to produce functional guard cell-specific chimeric promoters (Francia, personal
communication). As a whole our data demonstrate
that both the full length and the minimal AtMYB60
promoters provide a valuable tool to manipulate gene
expression specifically in guard cells, both for

physiological studies and downstream biotechnological
applications.

Conclusions
Our work provides strong evidence for the involvement
of [A/T]AAAG elements in the regulation of the
AtMYB60 expression, illustrating their functional cluster
organization. Future work will concentrate on the analysis of candidate DOF transcription factors that control
this mechanism. Finally we identify a region of the
AtMYB60 promoter required for the negative regulation
by ABA, offering the possibility to discover novel cis-elements for this kind of regulation.
Methods
Plant Material

All plant material described was in the Col-0 accession.
The cdf1-R line (35S::CDF1-RNAi #23) was kindly provided by Takato Imaizumi [29]. The cdf2-1, cdf3-1 and
cdf5-1 null alleles are T-DNA insertion line. Single, double, triple and quadruple cdf mutants have been previously described [30].
Construction of AtMYB60 promoter::GUS fusions

5’-deletions of the 5’ intergenic genomic region
upstream of the AtMYB60 gene were generated by PCR
amplification from plasmid p1.3-2.2::GUS, previously
described [19], using different forward primers and a
single reverse primer. Forward and reverse primers
incorporated a HindIII and a BamHI, respectively. The
PCR fragments were cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA), cut with
HindIII and BamHI and ligated upstream of the uidA
coding sequence in the pBI101.3 binary vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The resulting plasmids were
renamed -1307::GUS, -619::GUS, -472::GUS, -366::GUS,
-262::GUS and -205::GUS (Figure 2).

bp CaMV 35S promoter were produced by amplifying
the sequence of the CaMV 35S promoter from -46 to
+1 [28] from plasmid pBI121 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA,
USA), using the forward primer 35SXba containing a
XbaI site and the reverse primer 35SBam with a BamHI
site. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR4-TOPO
vector and the XbaI-BamHI fragment was cloned into
the pBI101.3 vector (renamed 35Smin-pBI101.3). The
regions from -262 to -137 and from -262 to -148 of the
AtMYB60 minimal promoter were amplified by PCR
from plasmid p1.3-2.2::GUS, using the reverse primers
p60R6 and p60R7 incorporating a XbaI site and a single
forward primer p60F3 with the HindIII site. The corresponding PCR products were cloned into the pCR4TOPO vector and the HindIII-XbaI fragments were
cloned into the 35Smin-pBI101.3 vector to give the
-137-3’::GUS and -148-3’::GUS vectors, respectively (Figure 3).
Chimeric promoters containing different copies of the
region between -262 and -205 of the AtMYB60 promoter were obtained by synthesising one copy of this
sequence, using the forward primer p60F3 with a HindIII site and the reverse primer p60R3 with an XbaI
site. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the
pCR4-TOPO vector and the HindIII-XbaI fragment was
ligated into the 35Smin-pBI101.3 vector (construct 1x::
GUS). A second copy of this region was generated using
the primers p60F3 and p60R5b, both incorporating a
HindIII site; the fragment HindIII-HindIII was cloned
into the construct 1x::GUS, generating the construct 2x::
GUS. This plasmid was used as a template to generate
two other copies of the sequence from -262 to -205
using the primers p60F11 and p60R3 incorporating an
XbaI site. The fragment XbaI-XbaI was cloned into the
plasmid 2x::GUS, to generate the construct 4x::GUS. All
the oligonucleotide sequences are reported in Table 1.
PCR products were sequenced and the correct orientation of the fragment into the final vector was verified by
restriction.
Site-directed mutagenesis analysis

Base mutations of the different DOF sites were generated using the megaprimer method [42]. For the mutagenised versions of the AtMYB60 minimal promoter
different megaprimers were PCR amplified from plasmid
p1.3-2.2::GUS, using as forward primers mp60DOF1F1,
mp60DOF2F1, mp60DOF3F2 and mp60DOF4F2 and
the single reverse primer p60R5. The megaprimers were
gel purified and used in a second PCR reaction on plasmid p1.3-2.2::GUS with the primer p60F3. The PCR
products were cloned into pCR4-TOPO and sequenced
before cloning into pBI101.3 vector using the restriction
sites HindIII and BamHI to generate the following constructs: mDOF1::GUS, mDOF2::GUS, mDOF3::GUS,

the templates for the second PCR amplification were
plasmids already carrying a first mutagenised DOF site.
In the case of the preparation of the construct mW::
GUS the megaprimer method was not necessary, as the
site to mutagenise is in a position 5’ terminal into the
minimal promoter and a single PCR reaction was performed with primers mp60WRKYF1 and p60R5, the
PCR product was then cloned with the procedure
already described.
All the oligonucleotide sequences are reported in
Table 1.
Arabidopsis transformation and growth conditions

Wild-type Columbia (Col-0) plants were transformed
using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 carrying the constructs described above with the floral dip
method [43]. Transformed lines were selected on kanamycin and single-insertion lines were selected for
further analyses. Analyses of transgenic lines were

Cominelli et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:162

performed on T2 or on homozygous T3 plants grown
under long-day conditions (16 hr light; 8 hr darkat 100
μmol m -2 sec -1 ) at 22°C in a growth chamber. Seeds
were germinated in Petri dishes containing Murashige
and Skoog medium, 1% w/v sucrose and 0.8% w/v agar
for seedling analysis or directly on soil for adult plant
organ analysis. The ABA treatment was performed as
previously described [19].
GUS activity assays and histochemical staining

For detection of GUS activity, tissues were fixed for 2 h
in 90% (v/v) acetone at -20°C, incubated for 16-48
hours, at 37°C, in 0.05% (w/v) X-glucoronic acid, 0.1%
(v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.5mM ferrocyanidine in 50
mM phosphate buffer (pH 7) and subsequently cleared
in 70% (v/v) ethanol. Seedlings and flowers were cleared
with a chloral hydrate:glycerol:water solution (8:1:2, v/v).
Samples were examined using a Leica M205 FA stereomicroscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH Wetzlar, Germany) and a Zeiss Axiophot D1 microscope (Carl Zeiss
MicroImaging, LLC Thornwood, New York, USA).
Stereomicroscope images were recorded using the Leica
LAS software version 2.8.1. Microscope images were
recorded with an AxioCam MRc5 camera (Zeiss) using
the AxioVision program (version 5.0).
Quantification of mRNA expression

RNA isolation, reverse transcription, qRT-PCR reactions
and data analysis were performed as previously
described [30]. GUS expression was analysed using primers GUSRT-F1 and GUSRT-R1, ACTIN2 gene (primers ATACT2F, ATACT2R) was used as a reference
for normalization. AtMYB60 expression in different cdf
mutants was analysed using primers qRT-MYB60-F and
qRT-MYB60-R. PP2A gene, corresponding to At1g13320
(primers PP2a-F and PP2a-R) was used as a reference
for normalization [44]. All primer sequences are
reported in Table 1.
