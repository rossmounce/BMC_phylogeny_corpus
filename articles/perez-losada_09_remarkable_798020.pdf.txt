Abstract
Background: The Thecostraca are arguably the most morphologically and biologically variable
group within the Crustacea, including both suspension feeders (Cirripedia: Thoracica and
Acrothoracica) and parasitic forms (Cirripedia: Rhizocephala, Ascothoracida and Facetotecta).
Similarities between the metamorphosis found in the Facetotecta and Rhizocephala suggests a
common evolutionary origin, but until now no comprehensive study has looked at the basic
evolution of these thecostracan groups.
Results: To this end, we collected DNA sequences from three nuclear genes [18S rRNA (2,305),
28S rRNA (2,402), Histone H3 (328)] and 41 larval characters in seven facetotectans, five
ascothoracidans, three acrothoracicans, 25 rhizocephalans and 39 thoracicans (ingroup) and 12
Malacostraca and 10 Copepoda (outgroup). Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and
Bayesian analyses showed the Facetotecta, Ascothoracida and Cirripedia each as monophyletic.
The better resolved and highly supported DNA maximum likelihood and morphological-DNA
Bayesian analysis trees depicted the main phylogenetic relationships within the Thecostraca as
(Facetotecta, (Ascothoracida, (Acrothoracica, (Rhizocephala, Thoracica)))).
Conclusion: Our analyses indicate a convergent evolution of the very similar and highly reduced
slug-shaped stages found during metamorphosis of both the Rhizocephala and the Facetotecta. This
provides a remarkable case of convergent evolution and implies that the advanced endoparasitic
mode of life known from the Rhizocephala and strongly indicated for the Facetotecta had no
common origin. Future analyses are needed to determine whether the most recent common
ancestor of the Thecostraca was free-living or some primitive form of ectoparasite.

Background
The Thecostraca, which include the Facetotecta, Ascothoracida and Cirripedia, is a highly variable crustacean
group in terms of both morphology and biology [1,2].
This makes them prime models for studying evolutionary
adaptations in both morphology and reproductive sys-

tems [3]. In fact, the specializations in adult morphology,
growth, feeding biology and sexual systems prompted
Darwin to study cirripedes, resulting in one of the first
'model organisms' of evolutionary adaptation [4-7]. All
thecostracans are sessile as adults and to initiate this phase
they have evolved the cypridoid larva, called cyprid in the

Cirripedia, a-cyprid in the Ascothoracida and y-cyprid in
the Facetotecta (Figure 1). The cypridoid follows after the
naupliar phase and has prehensile antennules and natatory thoracopods [8,9]. The Thecostraca include both suspension feeders (Cirripedia: Thoracica and Acrothoracica)
and advanced parasitic forms [Rhizocephala (Cirripedia),
Ascothoracida and Facetotecta].

root-like extensions of the body wall, but they always
retain body segmentation and appendages [31]. The
details of host infection, including how the endoparasitic
ascothoracids gain access to their host, have never been
observed, but in the ectoparasitic species the adult differs
little if at all from the a-cypris larva, indicating that no real
metamorphosis takes place [31,32].

The Thoracica (Cirripedia) is highly specialized in having
their six pairs of thoracopods modified into a basket of
cirri used in suspension feeding [10]. In addition, their
body armour consists of a system of mineralized plates.
These are not shed at moults but increase gradually in size,
which differs from the conventional crustacean mode of
growth by a series of cuticular moults [10,11]. Thoracican
cirripedes are prime models for studies on intertidal ecology [12-15], larval settlement [16,17], antifouling technology [18] and for testing theories on the evolution of
life cycles and reproductive systems [3,19-22]. The Acrothoracica (Cirripedia), though similarly suspension feeders by means of thoracic cirri, lack mineralized plates [23].
Instead, they are symbiotic and inhabit self-excavated burrows in either corals or gastropod shells occupied by hermit crabs.

The Facetotecta is the most elusive group within the Thecostraca sensu Grygier [8]. First recorded more than 100
years ago [33], they occur as y-larvae in marine plankton
throughout the world, but the adult stage has never been
found in the wild [34]. However, recently, Glenner et al.
[35] induced facetotectan y-cyprids to metamorphose in
vitro (Figure 2A). They moulted into a slug-shaped stage
called the ypsigon, which exhibits many similarities with
the rhizocephalan vermigon. From this comparison Glenner et al. [35] concluded that adult facetotectans are parasites and that the ypsigon initiates an internal
(endoparasitic) phase of their life cycle. The similarity
between the ypsigon and vermigon stages raises the question of the phylogenetic relationship between the Facetotecta and the Rhizocephala and whether their advanced
modes of parasitism have a common evolutionary origin.
However, a sister relationship between the Facetotecta
and the Rhizocephala goes against the classic idea of a
monophyletic Cirripedia, which is supported by the presence of the so-called fronto-lateral horns in the nauplii
[1,26]. The facetotectans become even more interesting by
the observation that their larvae can be both abundant
and diverse, such as in Okinawan waters where more than
40 putative species occur at a single study site, indicating
that a similar number of undescribed parasites occur in
the nearby coral reef habitat [35,36].

All species of the Rhizocephala (Cirripedia) are parasites
on crustaceans, mostly on Decapoda, although they can
also infest a range of peracarids, stomatopods and even
thoracican barnacles. They are so specialized that they can
only be recognized as Crustacea by means of their larvae
[24-26]. The adult parasite, consisting of an external
reproductive sac and a system of rootlets ramifying inside
the host, is simplified to such an extent that it lacks all
organs and structures normally used to identify Crustacea
and other arthropods [19,27,28]. Rhizocephalans show a
highly complex life cycle including their mode of infestation (Figure 2B). When settled, the rhizocephalan cypris
larva injects itself through the cuticle of the host crab and
into the haemocoel as a so-called vermigon stage that has
an exceedingly simplified structure. It is worm shaped and
self motile, but consists merely of a very thin epicuticle
and four types of cells. There is no trace of segmentation,
appendages or any kind of differentiated organs except an
epidermis and a lump of cells representing the primordial
ovary. The vermigon migrates inside the host until it
reaches the site where the adult parasite will grow out its
body parts and eventually emerge on the host's exterior
[29,30].
The Ascothoracida (Thecostraca) are also parasites and
infest either echinoderms or cnidarians. The most plesiomorphic ascothoracids are very little modified and only
the piercing mouthparts indicate their ectoparasitic mode
of life. More advanced taxa, such as the Dendrogastridae,
can have strongly modified endoparasitic adults with long

Historically, the term Cirripedia was used rather loosely,
often incorporating the Ascothoracida, while the facetotectan y-larvae had no systematic affiliation. Since Grygier
[8], the subclass Thecostraca, in systematic terms, has
comprised the Facetotecta (y-larvae), the Ascothoracida
and the Cirripedia, while the Cirripedia consists of the
Acrothoracica, the Rhizocephala and the Thoracica [37].
Grygier [8] based his system on a formal numerical cladistic analysis, but having at his disposal only a limited set of
morphological characters he failed to resolve relations
among the three thecostracan or among the three cirripede clades. In the last 10 years, cirripede phylogeny has
been studied rather intensively based on molecular datasets. It now appears that the Rhizocephala are monophyletic [38], as suggested by the 18S rRNA locus, and
some insight has also been gained in the intrinsic relationships of the Thoracica using nuclear (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA
and H3) and mitochondrial (12S rRNA and 16S rRNA)
loci [39,40]. For the Thecostraca in general, Pérez-Losada
et al. [41] used 18S rRNA sequences to argue that the Fac-

whether homology exists between the advanced metamorphosis found in both the Facetotecta and Rhizocephala. We generated a robust phylogenetic tree where
the main Thecostraca relationships were depicted as (Facetotecta, Ascothoracida, Acrothoracica, Rhizocephala,
Thoracica). This topology suggests that the very similar
and highly advanced mode of metamorphosis found in
the Facetotecta and the Rhizocephala evolved independently, providing a remarkable case of convergent evolution into extremely specialized endoparasitism.

etotecta is the sister group to an Ascothoracida + Cirripedia clade, but this was based on only a single facetotectan
species. There is accordingly an urgent need to re-examine
the phylogeny of all Thecostraca using a wider taxon sampling across the five major taxa. Moreover, since Grygier
[8], no study has presented a character matrix that covers
morphological features across all Thecostraca. Such a
matrix must necessarily be based on larval characters,
because post-larval Facetotecta and Rhizocephala are so
reduced that no features can be compared with other
groups [25]. Even a comparison between the dissimilar
adults of the Ascothoracida, Acrothoracica and Thoracica
meets with severe difficulties [42].
Here we present a large-scale analysis combining a morphological dataset of 41 larval characters with sequence
data from three nuclear genes and with broad taxon sampling within all the major thecostracan groups. Our purpose was to obtain a well-supported phylogeny for testing
how often parasitism evolved within the subclass and

Both the DNA maximum likelihood (ML) and morphological-DNA Bayesian (BMCMC) analyses resulted in trees
where the Facetotecta, Ascothoracida and Cirripedia were
each monophyletic (Figure 3). Those trees were also well
resolved and supported, and they only differed from each
other in minor details. The Facetotecta branched off
basally as the sister group to all remaining Thecostraca.
Within the latter clade, the Ascothoracida was sister to a
monophyletic Cirripedia comprising the Acrothoracica,
Rhizocephala and Thoracica. Within the Ascothoracida,
neither the order Dendrogastrida nor the family Dendrogastridae were monophyletic in our trees, because Ulophysema had a basal position separated from Dendrogaster by
Zibrowia and Baccalaureus, both of which are currently
classified in the order Laurida; nonetheless, this clade had
no significant support [bootstrap proportions (bp) <70%
and posterior probabilities (pP) < 0.95]. Moreover, a
monophyletic Dendrogastrida hypothesis had a pP <
0.019, but was not rejected by the S-H test. Within the Cirripedia, the three main groups were each monophyletic
with the Acrothoracica depicted as sister to a Rhizocephala + Thoracica clade. Within the Rhizocephala, neither the ML nor the Bayesian trees showed the
Kentrogonida or Akentrogonida as monophyletic. The
reason is that Sylon hippolytes, which belongs to the Kentrogonida, is sister to Polysaccus japonicus, which belongs
to the Akentrogonida and this latter clade has a pP = 1.0.
A Kentrogonida + Akentrogonida clade was rejected by
both the Bayesian (pP < 0.001) and S-H (P < 0.05) tests.
Within the Thoracica, the ML and Bayesian trees had the
same general topology as in Pérez-Losada et al. [39,40],
although some taxa fell in a different position in our new
trees (for example, Smilium and Calantica). Nonetheless,
the current analyses and morphological data were never
meant to address the intrinsic relationships within the
Thoracica; hence, we refer the reader to our latest study
[39] for a more robust analysis of the group.
Our maximum parsimony (MP) analysis of the morphological characters alone yielded a strict consensus tree (L =
55) recovering the Facetotecta, Ascothoracida and Cirripedia as monophyletic, although no resolution or support
was observed within clades (Figure 4). This tree also

showed a Facetotecta-Cirripedia sister relationship which
is supported by seven characters: nauplius with furcal
setae (character 5; Additional file 1, Appendix S1), [4345], antennular segment number expressed in entire life
cycle (8), naupliar antennular segments (9), a hand, hoof
or bell-shaped semi-distal antennular segment in the
cypridoid larva (20), mouthparts and gut (29), reduction
of thoracopodal musculature (31) and profound metamorphosis after cypridoid stage (39). This highlights the
similarity between Facetotecta and Cirripedia due to convergence, as compared with our better-resolved ML and
BMCMC trees where these clades do not form sister
groups. Obviously, in the combined BMCMC analysis, the
signal from the morphological data is overwhelmed by
the DNA data, which has many more informative characters with stronger phylogenetic signal. When the same larval data were mapped on the ML tree or included in the
BMCMC analysis, only three characters supported an
Ascothoracida-Cirripedia clade: frontal filaments in nauplius (7), reduction of distal antennular musculature in
cypridoid larva (26) and postoral adductor muscle (30).
Moreover, 11, 3 and 5 apomorphies supported the monophyly of Cirripedia, Ascothoracida and Facetotecta,
respectively.

Discussion
Phylogenetic relationships
All our molecular and combined analyses (Figure 3) supported the Facetotecta, Ascothoracida, Acrothoracica,
Rhizocephala and Thoracica as monophyletic taxa with
high confidence. For the Rhizocephala, the molecular
analysis by Glenner and Hebsgaard [38] has already provided strong support for the monophyly of this taxon, but
their study did not include the Facetotecta. For the Thoracica, previous analyses had either very limited taxon sampling [46-49] or assumed the taxon to be monophyletic
[39,40]. Our analysis is therefore the first to test the
monophyly of the above mentioned taxa using a comprehensive taxon sampling covering all thecostracan orders.

Morphological evidence alone could not resolve the phylogenetic position of the Facetotecta [8]. In our ML and
BMCMC analyses (Figure 3), the Facetotecta was depicted
at the base of the thecostracan tree, which confirms previous results by Pérez-Losada et al. [41] based on a single
18S rRNA sequence from the facetotectan Hansenocaris
itoi. The Facetotecta is the only crustacean taxon where the
taxonomy is based exclusively on larval forms [34]. All
Facetotecta described to date belong to the genus Hansenocaris, although undoubtedly this covers a more extensive
taxonomic diversity [35]. Kolbasov et al. [50] provided a
key to all known facetotectan species, whether formally
described or not, and they list a host of morphological
characters that could be used for analysing the intrinsic
phylogeny of the taxon. Our molecular analysis (Figure 3)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/15

of seven facetotectans had full resolution and high support for many nodes, indicating that the gene regions used
here will also be useful for resolving evolutionary relationships within the Facetotecta. This, and the many features in larval morphology, bodes well for a future
phylogenetically based taxonomy of the group.
Within the Ascothoracida, our analyses did not recover a
monophyletic Dendrogastridae. Similarly, Kolbasov et al.
[50] using lattice organ morphology at a detail not coded
for here, also questioned the validity of this family. Nonetheless, taxon sampling is still limited within the subclass,
and it must be kept in mind that the present classification
of the Ascothoracida was never claimed to be cladistically
based [51].
Within the Rhizocephala, our ML and Bayesian trees
largely agreed with the recent analysis in Glenner and
Hebsgaard [38], although we did not retrieve a monophyletic Akentrogonida. Both the ML and Bayesian analyses confirmed previous claims that the Rhizocephala and
the Thoracica are sister groups [41], while the Acrothoracica diverged at the base of the Cirripedia. Two evolutionary scenarios can account for this: (1), an acrothoracicantype ancestor has led equally to both the Thoracica and
the Rhizocephala; (2) a thoracican-like ancestor of both
lineages became modified in both the Acrothoracica and
the Rhizocephala, while its morphology remains reflected
in the most plesiomorphic extant thoracicans such as the
Iblomorpha [39].
Grygier [8] listed a number of putative apomorphies for
the Thecostraca, mostly pertaining to the presence of a
cypridoid settlement stage with prehensile antennules. To
his list we can now add the presence of five pairs of chemosensory lattice organs on the carapace of the cypridoid
larva [50,52-54]. These structures have not been found in
any other crustaceans.
Larval morphology
Larval characters are the only morphological traits that
can be coded for all thecostracan taxa, but only Grygier [8]
has previously presented a formalized matrix based on
these features. Although our morphological dataset failed
to resolve basic thecostracan radiation in the MP analysis,
we did identify apomorphies in support of the monophyly of the three major groups. For the Cirripedia, one of
the 11 morphological apomorphies is the classical presence of fronto-lateral horns in the nauplii, which was the
first character by which the Rhizocephala could be recognized as belonging to the Cirripedia [1,10]. The remaining
10 apomorphies all concern the cyprid, which is instrumental in enabling the complex and efficient mechanism
of substratum location and attachment seen in all cirripedes irrespective of the immense differences in adult

morphology and biology. As previously predicted [9,26]
these cyprid specializations, notably in the sensory and
locomotory apparatus, are important in explaining the
immense success of the Cirripedia compared with the
other Thecostraca. When facetotectan y-cyprids and ascothoracidan a-cyprids become better analyzed at a level
comparable to that of the cirripede cyprid (e.g., [55]), it is
very likely that additional apomorphies for the Cirripedia
will be revealed.
Parasitism in the Thecostraca
The Facetotecta, Ascothoracida and Rhizocephala are all
parasitic and this raises the question whether parasitism
in these taxa evolved independently or had some level of
common ancestry. Both our outgroups contain parasitic
forms, but these are all secondarily derived with high certainty. In the Malacostraca, parasites are found only in
highly derived taxa such as the Amphipoda and especially
the Isopoda. Both isopods and amphipods are nested
deep within the Malacostraca and the parasites again deep
within the two orders [56-59]. In the Copepoda all available phylogenies, notably the one by Huys and Boxshall
[60], place the several parasitic groups well derived within
the taxon. We can therefore assume a free-living ancestor
at the base of both outgroups, which suggests that the
ancestor of the Malacostraca, Copepoda and Thecostraca
was free-living too. Making this assumption, our phylogeny indicates a shift from free-living to parasite at the base
of the Thecostraca, as the Facetotecta (parasite) is the first
group to branch off. However, our morphological dataset
was not constructed to solve this issue, since it relies on
larval characters only. Moreover, coding parasitism as a
single character is a gross oversimplification, obscuring
the different adaptations to this mode of life within the
Thecostraca. While detailed similarities exist between Facetotecta and Rhizocephala, neither of these taxa shows
any similarity to the Ascothoracida in their mode of parasitism. In the most primitive Ascothoracida there is no
metamorphosis, and the adult parasite is very similar to
the settling a-cypris larva. This contrasts with the profound and remarkably similar metamorphosis known
from both the Facetotecta and Rhizocephala. In rhizocephalans the settled cyprid metamorphoses into a vermigon, a highly reduced stage that is injected into the
haemocoelic system of the host crab and initiates the
endoparasitic phase of the life cycle (Figure 2B)
[29,30,61]. Recently, Glenner et al. [35] found that facetotectan y-cyprids metamorphose into a very comparable
stage called the ypsigon (Figure 2A). Both the vermigon
and the ypsigon are slug-shaped, unsegmented, without
appendages and have an extremely simplified internal
structure that includes only a handful of cell types (Figures
1 and 2). Based on these observations, Glenner et al. [35]
concluded that the adult Facetotecta are parasitic in
unknown hosts and, like the Rhizocephala, with an initial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/15

endoparasitic phase in the life cycle. Our ML and BMCMC
analyses (Figure 3) found no close relation between the
Facetotecta and Rhizocephala, and such a relation was
rejected by both the S-H and Bayesian tests (P and pP <
0.001). If mapped onto our ML or BMCMC trees, the presence of a slug shaped, unsegmented stage (vermigon,
ypsigon) appears to have evolved independently in the
Facetotecta and the Rhizocephala. This remarkable convergence demonstrates the flexibility of the thecostracan
body plan and the morphological diversity crustaceans
can achieve when under selection for parasitism. As complementary work to the analysis presented here we would,
in the future, like to include the parasitic Tantulocarida,
from which we did not have material for molecular analysis [37,62,63]. This class of Crustacea is often assumed to
be the closest relative to the Thecostraca. It would therefore be very interesting to examine if the highly advanced
parasitism seen in this group is homologous to any of the
several modes of parasitism found in the Thecostraca.

Conclusion
We conclude that the Facetotecta is a monophyletic taxon
with a sister relationship to a clade consisting of the Ascothoracida and Cirripedia. Within the latter, the Acrothoracica is sister to a Rhizocephala + Thoracica clade.
Facetotecta, Ascothoracida and Cirripedia are each well
characterized by apomorphies in larval morphology. The
very similar ypsigon and vermigon stages arose independently in the Facetotecta and the Rhizocephala and provide
a remarkable case of convergent evolution. Future analyses with an enlarged morphological database and more
taxa must elucidate whether the ancestors to the Thecostraca were free-living or some form of primitive ectoparasites.

Methods
Taxon sampling
We sampled 79 thecostracans including Facetotecta
(seven species), Ascothoracida (five spp.), and Cirripedia
(67 spp.): Acrothoracica (three spp.), Rhizocephala (25
spp.) and Thoracica (39 spp.). While there is no consensus
on large-scale phylogeny of the Crustacea, the most recent
and comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of arthropod
relationships [64] based on 62 loci (41 Kb) showed that
the Malacostraca is the sister clade to the Thecostraca and
the Copepoda is their closest relative, confirming previous
phylogenetic results by Regier et al. [65] and Mallat and
Giribet [66]. We, therefore, used 12 malacostracans and
10 copepods (Additional file 1, Table S1) to root the Thecostraca tree. All Facetotecta, except Hansenocaris itoi, were
sampled as nauplii and reared to the y-cypris stage at the
Sesoko Marine Station, Okinawa, Japan, as in Glenner et
al. [35]. DNA was extracted from samples of 10–20 ycyprids pooled from distinct types of larvae. These types,
representing still-undescribed species, were distinguished

based on the morphology of moulted skins of the last
nauplius V instars that developed into the y-cyprids (see
[35]). The most recent classification of the Crustacea by
Martin and Davis [37] lists a total of eight orders within
the three thecostracan infraclasses (Facetotecta, Ascothoracida and Cirripedia), and all of these are represented in
this study (see Additional file 1, Table S1; no subdivision
of the infraclass Facetotecta has been attempted yet). We,
therefore, think that this represents a reasonable sampling
for studying basic evolutionary relationships within the
Thecostraca. Specimens were preserved in 70% EtOH and
are housed in the crustacean collection at the Monte L.
Bean Life Science Museum, Brigham Young University.
DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing
DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing were performed as described in Pérez-Losada et al. [39,40]. Since
this study attempts to solve the evolution of backbone lineages in the thecostracan tree, we selected the three more
informative genes in Pérez-Losada et al. [40] for inferring
deep relationships: 18S rRNA (2,305 bp), 28S rRNA
(2,402 bp), and histone H3 (328 bp). As demonstrated in
Pérez-Losada et al. [39], these genes have proven to be
very informative at this level. Here we have generated 39
new sequences (18S rRNA = 13 sequences, 28S rRNA = 12,
and H3 = 14), which have been deposited in GenBank
under the accession numbers FJ751865–FJ751903 (Additional file 1, Table S1).
Morphological data
We scored a total of 41 characters in larval morphology
taken from the nauplii (10), the cypridoid larvae (28) and
from general development (3) (Additional file 1, Appendices S1 and S2). There is no previous morphology-based
analysis of the phylogeny of the Ascothoracida or the
Acrothoracica (Cirripedia), and for the Rhizocephala (Cirripedia) the morphological matrix in Høeg and Lützen
[67] concerned only the order Akentrogonida. For the
Thoracica (Cirripedia), most previously used characters
were derived from the sessile adults [10,39,40,42,68], but
since adult Facetotecta are unknown and adult Rhizocephala are singularly specialized for a parasitic mode of
life, any morphology based matrix of all Thecostraca must
be based on larval characters only. Our matrix is based on
Grygier [8,69], but we have increased the list of characters
and revised definitions and scorings. Recent advances in
the understanding of the ultrastructure of thecostracan
larvae have yielded many new traits, especially concerning
the cypridoid stage [9,50,53,70-73]. On the other hand,
we were compelled to omit some of the potentially important characters of Grygier [8]. He coded the Facetotecta,
Ascothoracida and Cirripedia by reconstructing their supposed ground patterns, but we used an exemplar
approach, and this illustrated that accurate information
on character states was lacking for many species. We there-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/15

fore used '?' in all cases where the character state was
unknown for a species, even if it is supposedly placed
deep within a taxon with an apparently invariable morphology for the trait in question. Unexpected character
states such as the occurrence of 'crest in a trough'-type lattice organs (character 13) in some Chthamalus, which are
nested deep within the Thoracica, shows that this is a prudent approach.
Phylogenetic analyses
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using MAFFT v5.7 [74]
as indicated in Pérez-Losada et al. [39] for each of the
three thecostracan infraclasses. Final assembling of each
aligned group was performed using profile alignment generating a final dataset of 6,244 sites. Uncertainty in our
18S and 28S alignments was identified using GBlocks
v0.91b [75]. No questionable regions were observed in
the entire H3 alignment. GBlocks parameters (minimum
number of sequences for a conserved and a flank position,
maximum number of contiguous non-conserved positions, minimum length of a block and allowed gap positions) were set up as 51-85-8-10-all and 38-63-8-10-all for
18S and 28S, respectively. These settings generated a conserved alignment of 3,437 sites. Long and short (after
GBlocks) aligned data sets were initially analyzed in
RAxML [76] and almost identical ML trees were obtained.
Therefore, in all the subsequent analyses performed here
we used the long aligned dataset (6,244 sites). Congruence among gene regions was addressed using the Wiens
[77] protocol. Separate bootstrap ML analyses [78] were
conducted for each of the three genes using RAxML to
detect potential areas of strongly supported incongruence
as indicated by conflicting nodes with bp 70%. No such
areas of incongruence were observed in our alignment.

Morphological and DNA sequence data were analyzed
under different phylogenetic approaches. Morphological
data alone were analyzed using MP as implemented in
PAUP* v4b10 [79]. We performed MP heuristic searches
using 100 random addition replicates and tree bisection
and reconnection branch swapping. A maxtree limit of
1,000 trees per replicate was enforced in each analysis.
DNA phylogenies were inferred using the ML approach
implemented in RAxML with 100 randomized MP starting
trees. Morphological-DNA phylogenies were inferred
using Bayesian methods coupled with Markov chain
Monte Carlo (BMCMC) inference, as implemented in
MrBayes v3.04b [80]. DNA mixed model analyses were
performed under both ML and BMCMC procedures. DNA
model selection followed the procedure outlined by
Posada and Buckley [81] as implemented in ModelTest
v3.6 [82]. The GTR++I model [83] was selected for all
gene regions. Within the BMCMC approach, morphological data were analyzed using the 'standard' model. This
model is based on the ideas originally presented by Lewis

[84]. Essentially, the model is analogous to a JC model
[85] (equal substitution rates) except that it has a variable
number of states (two in our case). Four independent
BMCMC analyses were run in MrBayes with each consisting of four chains. Each Markov chain was started from a
random tree and run for 107 cycles, sampling every
1,000th generation. Model parameters were unlinked,
treated as unknown variables with uniform default priors
and estimated as part of the analysis. Convergence and
mixing were monitored using Tracer v1.4 [86]. All sample
points prior to reaching stationary were discarded as burnin. The pP for individual clades obtained from separate
analyses were compared for congruence and then combined and summarized on a 95% majority-rule consensus
tree [87,88].

Clade support under the MP and ML approaches was
assessed using the nonparametric bootstrap procedure
[89] with 1,000 bootstrap replicates and one random
addition per replicate. Confidence in our best hypotheses
of phylogenetic relationships was tested by first creating
alternative hypotheses in MacClade [90] as indicated in
Pérez-Losada et al. [40] and then comparing them under
both likelihood and Bayesian frameworks. Likelihood
topological tests were conducted using the Shimodaira
and Hasegawa (S-H) [91] test as implemented in PAUP*.
Ten thousand replicates were performed for every topology test resampling the partial likelihoods for each site
(RELL model). Bayesian topological tests were performed
as described in Huelsenbeck et al. [88].
