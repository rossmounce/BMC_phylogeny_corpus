Abstract
Background: Previous linkage and association studies may have implicated the Dystrobrevinbinding protein 1 (DTNBP1) gene locus or a gene in linkage disequilibrium with DTNBP1 on
chromosome 6p22.3 in genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia.
Methods: We used the case control design to test for of allelic and haplotypic association with
schizophrenia in a sample of four hundred and fifty research subjects with schizophrenia and four
hundred and fifty ancestrally matched supernormal controls. We genotyped the SNP markers
previously found to be significantly associated with schizophrenia in the original study and also
other markers found to be positive in subsequent studies.
Results: We could find no evidence of allelic, genotypic or haplotypic association with
schizophrenia in our UK sample.
Conclusion: The results suggest that the DTNBP1 gene contribution to schizophrenia must be
rare or absent in our sample. The discrepant allelic association results in previous studies of
association between DTNBP1 and schizophrenia could be due population admixture. However,

even positive studies of European populations do not show any consistent DTNBP1 alleles or
haplotypes associated with schizophrenia. Further research is needed to resolve these issues. The
possible confounding of linkage with association in family samples already showing linkage at 6p22.3
might be revealed by testing genes closely linked to DTNBP1 for allelic association and by
restricting family based tests of association to only one case per family.

Background
Schizophrenia has a life time prevalence of 0.85% in the
United Kingdom. Family, twin and adoption studies have
shown that there is a strong genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia. Multiply affected families are common, and
there is good evidence that genes increase susceptibility to
schizophrenia, and can be transmitted by obligate carriers
with no formal mental illness to affected offspring and
that the genetic heritability lies between 66% and 93%
[1]. Clinically unaffected obligate carriers as well as "normal" monozygotic co-twins have repeatedly been shown
to possess an "endophenotype" of brain volumetric deficit, abnormal smooth pursuit eye movements, abnormal
evoked EEG responses and abnormal patterns of speech
[1]. Replicated evidence from genetic linkage studies has
confirmed that multiple chromosomal loci are involved
in the heritability of the disease.
Evidence from linkage analysis in families that there is a
susceptibility locus for schizophrenia on chromosome
6p22.3 has been provided by several groups [2-5]. However, we and several other research groups were unable to
detect the presence of this locus in other family samples
[6-10]. The variability in the outcome of linkage studies
has been attributed to heterogeneity of linkage. This
implies that individual families have genetic effects not
shared by other families and that there are multiple different genetic subtypes of schizophrenia. Confirmed evidence for linkage at the 6p22.3 locus was followed up
with allelic association studies using the family based
methods implemented in TRANSMIT [11]. With this
method it is theoretically possible to confound linkage
with association unless a strict test of transmission disequilibrium is carried out by using only one affected case
in a family together with one set of parents. In general the
potential for confounding of linkage with association is
most likely when a family sample has already shown linkage to the markers for which there is apparent evidence for
association and when the commonest alleles and haplotypes appear to be showing association. In the case of the
original report of allelic association between DTNBP1
gene and schizophrenia the same family sample was
already known to show good evidence for linkage. An
admixture test on lod scores from the linkage analysis was
significant in rejecting homogeneity of linkage and was
also significant for showing significant admixture in the
family sample. Nevertheless when the most stringent test

of allelic association was carried out by observing transmission disequilibrium of alleles into one case of schizophrenia per family per kindred in the sample of 270 Irish
families evidence for allelic association with schizophrenia was weakened but still present [11]. This was computed with TRANSMIT but other family based tests of
association have also been which could still have confounded linkage with association.
The haplotype structure in the original Irish families
showed that 96% of the variability in the sample was
attributed to six haplotypes [12]. Only one of the six haplotypes was identified as a high risk haplotype and this
had a frequency of 6% in the whole sample [12]. The consistency of the disease haplotypes associated with schizophrenia are further explored in the discussion section of
this paper in the light of work by Mutsuddi and coworkers
[13]. These researchers compared all published haplotypes in the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain
(CEPH) reference DNA samples with those in published
association studies.
A subsequent study of 78 German, Hungarian and Israeli
families also showed positive tests of allelic transmission
disequilibrium with the DTNBP1 locus but only with a
single SNP and not with any of the other SNPs that had
been previously found to be associated in the Irish family
sample [14]. The German sample also showed a positive
haplotypic association composed of three adjacent SNPs.
However, the alleles in the associated haplotype were different to those found in Straub et al's Irish sample [11].
A positive haplotypic association was also found in a
study of 233 Han Chinese trios, where the risk haplotype
was composed of the most common SNP alleles [15]. This
was in contrast to the haplotype associated in the Irish
study which was composed of minor SNP alleles [11]. A
genetic association study consisting of three case control
samples from Germany, Poland and Sweden found no
evidence for association with any of the five SNPs previously reported to be positive except for one SNP
(rs1011313, p = 0.032) in the Swedish sub sample. Haplotypic associations were also negative for the German
and Polish sub samples. Only the Swedish schizophrenic
sample showed haplotypic association with schizophrenia. Several, two, three or four marker haplotypes and a
single 5-marker SNP haplotype showed association. The

strength of association was increased in the subgroup of
cases with a positive family history of schizophrenia. The
5 marker haplotype consisted of the nucleotide alleles AC-A-T-T at P1635; P1325; P1757; P1320 and P1578
respectively (3.1% in controls 17.7% in cases) [16]. It
should be noted that the Swedish sub sample only contained 32 family history positive cases which means that
the standard error for these statistical tests was high.
The haplotype associated in the original Straub et al [11]
data was G-C-A-T-C and in the Swedish sub sample was AC-X-C-C, where X is an SNP not tested in the Swedish sub
sample (P1635; P1325; P1757; P1320; P1578). The Swedish haplotype is yet another one to be associated with
schizophrenia. Van Den Bogaert et al., [16] suggest that
the 5 marker Swedish haplotype associated with schizophrenia is phylogenetically related to the original haplotype found to be associated with Irish schizophrenia by
Straub et al [11]. However, the absence of clear cut association in this sample combined with inconsistent haplotypes being associated with schizophrenia does not
encourage strong belief that this study has confirmed the
original data by Straub et al [11].
A novel DTNBP1 haplotype incorporating SNP A (T
allele) has been identified in a case control sample of 708
cases and 711 controls of British and Irish descent that
shows association with schizophrenia [17]. This haplotype was also found to be associated with schizophrenia
in an Irish case control sample that did not initially show
association [18,19]. This haplotype consisted of one novel
SNP (SNP A, A allele trend for increase in cases p = 0.06)
in combination with P1655 (p = 0.91) and P1635 (p =
0.82) from the Straub study [11] and gave an empirical p
value of 0.000056. The discrepancy between the significance of the SNP A single marker association with schizophrenia and the significance of the haplotypic association
is unexpected. Secondly the SNP A T allele showed a trend
towards association when single markers were tabulated
but the T allele was increased in the cases as part of the
haplotypes associated with schizophrenia. The same
research group also reported a positive replication in a
sample of 488 Hungarian schizophrenic trios [19]. However, the two markers and alleles showing association
were P1325 A allele and the P1757 G allele. The two alleles associated in the original study were the G and A alleles
at P1325 and P1757. Once again there is an inconsistency
in the identity of the alleles and haplotypes associated
with schizophrenia in the different studies. It seems that
the study by Kirov et al (2004) [19] found association
between two loci and schizophrenia with the opposite
alleles to those found to be associated in the original Irish
study. This is inconsistent with there being an evolutionary relationship between a schizophrenia susceptibility
mutation in different European sub populations.

A case control study by Funke and colleagues analysed 7
SNPs from the original Straub study [11] in a sample of
524 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 573 control subjects [20]. This sample was split
into white, Hispanic and African American sub-samples.
In the white subset of 258 patients and 467 controls, the
opposite allele T at P1578 to the one found associated in
the original Straub et al (2002) study (allele C) was associated with schizophrenia. At P1763 the A allele was associated in the study by Funke et al [20] but it was the C
allele that was originally associated by Straub et al [11].
Only the A allele at P1765 was consistently associated
with schizophrenia in the original and Funke studies. The
Hispanic subset (51 cases and 32 controls) was also found
to have the same 3 SNPs associated with schizophrenia
with the same inconsistencies with the original study. No
association was observed in the African American subset
which consisted of 215 cases and 74 controls.
Hall et al [21] investigated the role of DTNBP1 in schizophrenia in 210 US trios and 169 trios of Afrikaans descent.
Neither population displayed any significant allelic or
haplotypic associations between DTNBP1 and schizophrenia [21].
An Israeli isolate was used in a genome wide scan by Kohn
and colleagues to identify loci predisposing to any diagnosis of psychosis [22]. This isolate was unique in that
there was only one paternal origin for the whole village as
a result of a bottleneck event that occurred a few centuries
ago. IBD haplotype sharing was used to carry out a
genome wide scan with 359 microsatellite markers. A positive linkage (p < 0.0001) was observed over the DTNBP1
gene on chromosome 6. However, such an inbred population cannot distinguish between linkage and association.
Numakawa and colleagues used a case control sample of
670 patients and 588 controls and found that four SNPs,
P1635 (G allele) P1320 (T allele) P1763 (G allele) and
SNP A (A allele) were associated with schizophrenia [23].
The same authors also detected positive haplotypic association (p = 0.00028). The original alleles associated with
schizophrenia were the G, T, C and T alleles respectively.
Thus once again inconsistencies in the alleles and haplotypes found to be associated are apparent. There is also the
problem that the haplotypic associations are so much
stronger than the individual SNP association. P values
with relatively less differences between single marker and
haplotypic association would be expected.
Positive allelic and haplotypic associations were also
reported by Li and colleagues in a Han Chinese population [24]. Positive haplotypic but not allelic association
was reported by Tochigi et al, [25]. However, as with the

Behavioral and Brain Functions 2007, 3:50

some other studies [14,15], the associated haplotypes
were not the same as reported in the original study. Li et
al [24] screened a Scottish sample of 580 schizophrenic
cases and 620 controls. They were unable to replicate any
previously identified single marker or haplotypic associations. In particular the finding of a protective haplotype of
SNPA-P1655-P1635 was not replicated [17]. This haplotype was found to be strongly associated in a British population and was nominally significantly associated in an
Irish study, therefore one might expect a similar effect in a
Scottish population. However, only a partial replication
in a Scottish sample, with a rare haplotype of SNP A with
P1583 remained significant after permutation testing (p =
0.03) [24].

was an increase in the phosphorylation of AKT1, a gene
that itself has been associated with schizophrenia [30,31].
A possible role for DTNBP1 in both bipolar disorder and
major depression was investigated in three studies, single
marker allelic association with the SNPs identified by
Straub et al[11] was not detected in any of these studies
[32-34]. However, Breen et al., [34] reported genotypic
association with P1757 and P1320 and they also found
haplotypic association with markers P1765, P1757,
P1320 and P1763. In addition, DTNBP1 has also been
implicated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy [26] and in
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 7 (HPS-7) [35].

Methods
DTNBP1 is a 40-kDa coiled-coil-containing protein that
shows cross species evolutionary conservation [26].
DTNBP1 binds to both alpha- and beta-dystrobrevin in
muscle and brain [26]. In the brain DTNBP1 is found in
axons, particularly in the mossy fiber synaptic terminals of
the cerebellum and hippocampus [26]. Talbot and colleagues compared presynaptic dysbindin-1 levels at hippocampal formation sites lacking neuronal dystrobrevin
between schizophrenics and controls and found that
these levels were significantly reduced in schizophrenics
[27].
Weickert and colleagues [28] have studied the role and
distribution of dysbindin in brains from schizophrenics
and controls. Dysbindin mRNA levels in the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, hippocampus, caudate, putamen,
nucleus accumbens, amygdala, thalamus, and midbrain
were significantly reduced in schizophrenic brains. In the
midbrain there was a reduction of dysbindin in patients,
but this was not statistically significant. Significant genotype dependent differences in cortical levels of dysbindin
were also observed. This finding was supported by Bray
and colleagues in Cardiff [29] who demonstrated that a
schizophrenia risk haplotype tagged one or more cis acting variants that reduced expression of DTNBP1 in post
mortem cerebral cortex mRNA of unaffected research subjects. Numakawa et al (2004) investigated the functions of
dysbindin in primary neuronal cultures. They found that
over expression of dysbindin induced the expression of
two presynaptic proteins, SNAP25 and synapsin 1.
Increased extracellular basal glutamate levels and glutamate release was also observed as a result of dysbindin
over expression and this was thought to be evoked by high
potassium levels. Reduced expression of dysbindin using
small interfering RNA (siRNA) caused the opposite effect
with a reduction of pre-synaptic proteins and glutamate.
The authors suggested that the glutamate increase was a
direct effect of dysbindin up regulating the pre-synaptic
molecules. Another effect of over expressing dysbindin

Clinical sampling
450 cases of schizophrenia were studied together with 450
screened normal controls. The cases and controls were all
asked if both their parents and all four grandparents were
of Irish, Welsh, Scottish or English ancestry using our
ancestry questionnaire. Those subjects with two or more
grandparents who had any other ancestry were excluded
but subjects with a single grandparent with European
Union (EU) on the basis of the EU countries before 2004
enlargement), but non Jewish ancestry were included.
U.K. National Health Service (NHS) multicentre and local
research ethics committee approval was obtained for this
study. All subjects gave written consent after reading an
approved information sheet. All affected and unaffected
subjects were interviewed by a psychiatrist using the Lifetime Version of the Schizophrenia and Affective Disorders
Schedule (SADS-L) [36]. The cases were also rated using
the 90-item OPCRIT checklist [37], the family history was
recorded and a pedigree diagram was drawn. Diagnoses
were assigned using Research Diagnostic Criteria [38]. 60
ml of blood sample was taken from each individual for
DNA analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroform method.
Genotyping
All SNPs were genotyped by KBiosciences (Hertfordshire,
UK) which employs either the Amplifluor, KASPar or Taqman SNP genotyping methods or were genotyped by us
using Pyrosequencing. Internal controls were used to
check for accuracy with 17% of samples duplicated in
order to detect error and confirm the reproducibility of
genotypes. The reduplication of sample genotyping was
carried out in a separate microtitre plate and was PCR
amplified separately.
Sequencing
The region incorporating SNPs P1757 and P1320 was
resequenced by us in the molecular psychiatry laboratory
at UCL in random individuals to validate the results of
genotyping from Kbioscience. Direct genomic PCR based

Behavioral and Brain Functions 2007, 3:50

sequencing was carried out using M13 tailed primers synthesised to be homologous to genomic DNA sequences
flanking either side of the polymorphisms. Sequencing
reactions using universal infra red fluoresecent dye
labelled M13 sequence oligonucleotides were then carried
out on the PCR products. Sequencing products were
resolved by polyacrylamide electrophoresis on LiCor
4200 L sequencers and the gel images were inspected
manually.
Statistical analysis
All marker data was first tested for the presence or absence
of Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in both case and
control samples. If there was lack of HWE in the control
sample the genotyping was repeated and the data from
that marker was then rejected if HWE was still not
observed. Single marker allelic associations were performed using standard chi-squared tests of 2 Ã 2 contingency tables. Linkage disequilibrium analysis was
performed using Haploview [39]. The multi locus haplotype association analysis was performed using GENECOUNTING [40,41] and should any statistically
significant asymptotic p-values occur, then an empirical p
value would be calculated by permutation testing.

Results
Allelic, genotypic and haplotypic association studies
All of the markers were found be in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (p > 0.05). Reduplicated samples showed strong
consistency in genotypes called.

Table 1 shows the allele frequencies and tests of association for the SNP markers. None of these tests produced a
statistically significant association. Likewise, no genotypic
associations were found. Pair-wise linkage disequilibrium
was calculated between all pairs of markers using Haploview and the results are displayed in Figure 1. Tests of haplotypic association were carried out even though markers
were individually negative and did not show a trend for
significant association. A sliding window of two and three
marker haplotypes did not reveal any significant associations. Resequencing of the randomly chosen individuals
had 100% concordance rate with the results from Kbioscience which provided validity for the data.

Discussion
The fact that we did not find any association between
DTNBP1 SNPs and schizophrenia is consistent with our
previous linkage studies which did not find evidence for
linkage across the DTNBP1 region. However, linkage analysis is highly prone to the effects of heterogeneity of linkage and family size. Our own and other negative linkage
studies can easily be explained as being due to an admixture of different subtypes of schizophrenia in different
family samples. Tests of allelic association in case control

samples should be more robust to the effects of locus heterogeneity and the power of a sample to detect allelic
association becomes crucial. We calculated that our sample is large enough to detect a marker allele frequency difference of between 5% to 10% between cases and controls
with a power of 0.99 at p < 0.05 and of 0.91 at p < 0.001
with an odds ratio of 2.00 assuming the minor marker
allele frequency is less than 10%. With a high frequency
bi-allelic SNP marker with an odds ratio of 2.00 the sample only had a 80% power to reach a p value of less than
0.05 under dominant, recessive or additive models if there
was a 17% difference in allele frequencies (ie from 50% in
controls to 67% in cases. It is possible therefore that if the
DTNBP1 disease associated alleles are present in high frequency and only differ in frequency by, say about 5%
between cases and controls then the proportion of
DTNBP1 associated schizophrenic individuals in our sample may be too small to detect linkage disequilibrium.
When one considers the almost random way in which different studies report different alleles and haplotypes at
DTBNBP1 to be associated with schizophrenia for example even within the Irish population. Then one could
come to the conclusion that the positive results could all
be random or false positive. Yet the original linkage evidence on chromosome 6 was very robust. The original
positive allelic associations [11] were reported in a sample
which had half or even less power than some of the other
samples subsequently used which have been negative. At
the same time apparent replications have been generated
from small samples consisting of as few as 142 cases [16].
In the Straub study [11] the SNPs P1635 and P1320 were
the two markers most strongly associated with schizophrenia whereas two of the three SNPs located in the
interval between P1635 and P1320 were not associated. A
German sample [14] also found evidence for association
in two separate samples as well as in a combined sample
with P1320 which gave a p value of p = 0.00068. We genotyped both of these strongly associated markers but still
found no evidence of association.
The study by Williams and others on two samples from
the UK and Ireland was negative for all the previously
reported positive SNPs [17]. Sixteen novel SNPs were genotyped in these samples and none of these markers were
significantly associated schizophrenia [17]. Haplotypic
association analysis found a 3-marker haplotype composed of SNPs: SNP A, P1635, and P1655 that was associated with schizophrenia (p = 0.000056). All other
significant haplotypes contained SNPA and either P1635
and/or P1655. Only one haplotype was increased in frequency in controls (p = 0.01) and this was found in both
the Cardiff and Irish sub samples. The large difference in

the strength of single marker versus haplotypic association in this study is unexpected and is inconsistent.
In our study we used genomic sequencing to check that
the validity of some of the genotypes and haplotypes. No
genetic variation in or around the DTNBP1 exons and its
control regions have so far been found to have a convincing role in causing schizophrenia [42]. There are other
genes and expressed sequences in the associated and
linked region and these will also need resequencing in
those individuals with at risk haplotypes. It is possible
that resequencing DTNBP1 in a subgroup of subjects who
have inherited the alleles responsible for any association
might reveal a disease mutation. However, because different alleles and haplotypes have been found to be associated in the different studies, an explanation for these
inconsistencies must first be found. This latter problem
has now also been identified also by Mutsuddi and coauthors [13] who genotyped all the schizophrenia associated
single-nucleotide polymorphisms reported in each of the
studies in DNA samples from the CEPH-derived HapMap
sample (CEU). Using this high-density reference map they
found that that the haplotypes from each association
study were inconsistent with regard to any single diseaseassociated haplotype at DTNBP1. Specifically, all five of
the "replication" studies defined a positively associated
haplotype that was different from that which was reported
originally. They also showed that, in all six studies, the

European-derived populations studied had haplotype
patterns and frequencies that were consistent with the
HapMap CEU samples [13].
If one considers the overall pattern of results it seems that
the family based association studies obtain more significant results than the case control studies. One explanation
for lack of replication by the case control studies is that the
family based tests of association have not been able to distinguish very well between evidence of linkage and evidence of association. This is most likely to occur in family
samples where positive linkage with schizophrenia has
been found on chromosome 6 such as in the Irish and
German samples. The reported evidence for "association"
might therefore be a confirmation of linkage or mixture of
both. Alternatively one could surmise that DTNBP1 associated schizophrenia occurs predominantly in familial
cases of schizophrenia and that case control samples may
therefore contain fewer cases of DTNBP1 associated schizophrenics. Our case control sample has failed to detect
association at the CAPON and RGS4 loci and has implicated the EPSIN4 gene on 5q33, the UHMK1 gene on
1q22.3, the PCM1 gene on 8p22 and the FXYD6 gene on
11q22 with schizophrenia [40,43-47]. All these loci had
all been implicated by prior linkage studies and confirmed by tests of association using case control samples
without subdividing cases of schizophrenia by being family history positive or negative. Thus it is not clear that this

distinction would make much difference to the outcome
of genetic studies of DTNBP1. In genetic association studies as a whole it might be justified to discount certain family based studies as having failed to accurately fine map a
disease gene by being unable to detect pure allelic association/linkage disequilibrium because of the presence of
linkage in the family sample. In the case of the chromosome 6 schizophrenia linked region it now seems justifiable to consider that there could be genetic locus near by
but still very close to DTNB1 that is causing susceptibility
to schizophrenia. Alternatively an adequate explanation
needs to be sought for the inconsistency in alleles and
haplotypes found to be associated with schizophrenia.
