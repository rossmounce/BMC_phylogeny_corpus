Abstract
Background: Previous investigations from our laboratory were largely focused on the genome
organization of vertebrates. We showed that these genomes are mosaics of isochores, megabasesize DNA sequences that are fairly homogeneous in base composition yet belong to a small number
of families that cover a wide compositional spectrum. A question raised by these results concerned
how far back in evolution an isochore organization of the eukaryotic genome arose.
Results: The present investigation deals with the compositional patterns of the invertebrates for
which full genome sequences, or at least scaffolds, are available. We found that (i) a mosaic of
isochores is the long-range organization of all the genomes that we investigated; (ii) the isochore
families from the invertebrate genomes matched the corresponding families of vertebrates in GC
levels; (iii) the relative amounts of isochore families were remarkably different for different
genomes, except for those from phylogenetically close species, such as the Drosophilids.
Conclusion: This work demonstrates not only that an isochore organization is present in all
metazoan genomes analyzed that included Nematodes, Arthropods among Protostomia,
Echinoderms and Chordates among Deuterostomia, but also that the isochore families of
invertebrates share GC levels with the corresponding families of vertebrates.

Background
Recent investigations from our laboratory [1] showed that
the isochore families of all vertebrate genomes explored
are essentially conserved in GC levels (as well as in dinucleotide patterns) and in isochore sizes (with some exceptions in this case). Moreover, at least in eutherian
mammals and birds, even the relative amounts of isochore families (i.e. the compositional patterns) are largely
conserved. It is well established by our previous work that
a number of very basic genome properties, such as the distribution of genes and interspersed repeats, DNA methylation, gene expression, replication timing and
recombination, are different in GC-poor and GC-rich isochore families (see [2,3], for reviews). These results obvi-

ously support the idea of isochores being a "fundamental
level of genome organization" [4], at least in vertebrates.
We also suggested that the conservation of GC levels of
isochore families may underlie chromatin structures [5],
and that the conservation of isochore size may be associated with their role in the structure and replication of
chromosomes [6].
The above points raise the question as to how general the
isochore structure is in the genomes of metazoa. This is a
pertinent question because evidence for a compositional
heterogeneity was already obtained in our previous work
on the genomes of trypanosomes, plasmodium and drosophila [see ref. [2]]

Here we approached this problem by investigating the
compositional compartmentalization of genomes from
invertebrates in all cases in which either full sequences or
at least scaffolds were available. The case of Apis mellifera
will be presented elsewhere because the presence in this
genome of a very GC-poor family (in addition to the other
isochore families), which was absent from other insects,
required a special analysis. Expectedly, the present analysis broadens our view of the structure and evolution of
isochores. In fact, it demonstrates that an isochore organization endowed with a number of shared features is
found in the genomes of all metazoans explored in the
present work.

Results
Isochore patterns
Figure 1, which displays a simplified tree of life (derived
from [7]) of metazoans, in order to outline the phylogenetic position of the genomes investigated. Figure 1 is
shown to indicate the phylogenetic positions of invertebrate genomes explored. These comprised Nematodes,
Arthropods, Echinoderma and Chordata. As shown in
Additional File 1, the sizes of the genomes explored covered a 2.5-fold range, 95 to 240 Mb which, added to the
8-fold range of vertebrates, 400 to 3200 Mb, expand the

overall range of investigated genome sizes up to a 33-fold
value.
Table 1A presents the relative amounts of the isochore
families of all invertebrates investigated (along with those
of human and three fishes that are shown for the sake of
comparison). The salient features that appear in the isochore patterns (Figures 2 and 3) will now be outlined. The
isochore families of Ciona intestinalis, a Urochordate,
which is the closest ancestral species to vertebrates [8] are
presented in Figure 2 (along with those of three representative vertebrates, human, chicken and zebrafish) in order
to show the existence of a major L1 and a minor L2 isochore family. The genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans (Figure 2) also displays a very GC-poor genome,
consisting essentially of L1 isochores with only a very
small amount (less than 10%) of L2 isochores.
Among insects (Figure 3), the three Drosophila species
studied and Anopheles gambiae display three isochore families: a minor L2 family, a predominant H1 family and a
H2 family which is barely represented in Drosophila, but is
rather abundant in Anopheles. A very minor (about 1%) L1
component appears to correspond to chromosome 4 in
Drosophilids and is barely represented (0.5%) in A. gamMollusca

(a)Bold figures indicate the majority isochore families
(b)Figures in parentheses are overestimated (see the text)

biae. The isochore families of insects are shown along
those of a fish, stickleback.
The compositional patterns of scaffolds or contigs from
Branchiostoma floridae, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Aedes
aegypti, Tribolium castaneum and Daphnia pulex are shown
in Figure 4. Compositional distribution were generally
narrow, covering a range of about 5% GC, with the exception of T. castaneum in which case the range was about

10% GC, the center of distribution being lower (33%)
than in the other cases.
GC levels and dinucleotides of isochore families
The average GC levels of the isochore families from the
invertebrates investigated are very close to each other and
to the corresponding values of vertebrates (see Table 1B).

As far as dinucleotide patterns are concerned, C. intestinalis showed a remarkable observed/expected (O/E) pattern
in that complementary dinucleotides belonged in two
classes, higher and lower than statistical expectation,
respectively (see Figure 5). Indeed, AA/TT, AC/GT, CA/TG,
CC/GG were in the more frequent class, whereas AG/CT,
GA/TC were in the less frequent class. The dinucleotides
from all these pairs showed the same frequency. In contrast, TA and CG were less frequent than their complementary dinucleotides AT and GC. Moreover, AT/TA
belonged to the less frequent class whereas CG/GC were
close to statistical expectation.
Some features of the C. intestinalis, a Urochordate, were
also found in C. elegans, a Nematode. Indeed in C. elegans
AA/TT, CC/GG and CA/TG were also high, whereas AG/
CT were also low, but, in contrast, GA/TC were low and
AC/GT were high. Trinucleotides frequencies, showed the
expected similarities and differences (see Additional File
2).
AA/TT, CC/GC and CA/TG were also high in the insects
(and in vertebrates; see ref. [1]; for sake of comparison
with human see also Additional File 3), whereas AG/CT
was low in insects (but not in vertebrates), and AT/TA
were low (TA especially) in all cases (see Figure 6).
Very interestingly, CG was remarkably low in S. purpuratus
and B. floridae. The 0.6 values attained are, however, still
much higher than the 0.2 values reached by mammals
(see Figure 5B).
Isochore sizes
The average size from the most represented families of isochores (see Table 1C) is about 0.5 Mb (megabases) for C.
intestinalis, but higher values were found for C. elegans
(3.4 Mb) for Drosophilids (1.6-2 Mb) and A. gambiae (1.3
Mb). The GC-poorest isochore families comprise two size
groups, a large one and a small one, as in the case of vertebrates [9-11]. In particular, C. elegans showed a number
of extremely long GC-poor stretches (see Discussion). In
contrast, the GC-richest isochores are characterized by one
size group, the small one (see Additional File 4).
Gene density

of two vertebrates, human and stickleback, that are presented for the sake of comparison. In both cases, gene
density increased with increasing GC of isochore families.
Unfortunately, the data for C. intestinalis and C. elegans
did not permit to establish a reliable ratio between gene
densities in the L1 and L2 families because of the small
amounts of DNA and number of genes of the minority
family. In the case of the genomes only represented by
scaffolds, genes were localized on the scaffolds and gene
densities were shown to follow the general trend (see Figure 4).

Discussion
C. intestinalis and C. elegans essentially show a very predominant L1 isochore family and a minor L2 family, a
compositional pattern mimicking that of zebrafish. The
case of C. intestinalis is of interest because a previous investigation by analytical ultracentrifugation in a CsCl density
gradient had shown a remarkable homogeneity at an average molecular weight of 100 kb [12]. The apparent discrepancy can, however, be explained by the fact that the
CsCl investigation dealt with random fragments, whereas
the present one with 100 kb unique segments. The latter

show an average standard deviation of 1.3% GC (Cammarano R., Ph.D. Thesis) a value very slightly above the average standard deviation of 100 kb segments from human
isochores from the L1 and L2 families. The dinucleotide
patterns (observed/expected) present some significant differences (e.g. TA being much lower than AT in C. elegans,
but not in C. intestinalis), which are also expectedly shown
by trinucleotides.
Among insects, the Drosophilids exhibit similar isochore
patterns that are intermediate between those of medaka
and stickleback with a major H1 family and two minor L2
and H1 families. Another point of interest is the close similarity of GC levels of the isochore families as assessed on
Drosophilids and Anopheles (see Table 1B). The compositional pattern of A. gambiae, although being mainly represented by H1 isochores, shows a substantial amount of
H2 isochores. In fact, the GC-richer isochores of A. gambiae have probably been underestimated because of the
presence of a large number of 100-kb GC-rich stretches
that were pooled with the flanking regions because of the
procedure used in assessing isochores (see below).

In the other cases, certainly a number of factors played a
role and led to different compositional patterns. Indeed,
we already noted that while the large evolutionary
changes in isochore patterns occurring between mammals/birds and amphibians/fishes mainly depend upon
body temperature, definitely other factors play a role as
well in the case of fishes.
The average sizes exhibited by different isochore families
of invertebrates showed a greater variability compared to
those of the corresponding families from vertebrates [1].
This may be due, however, to artefactual reasons, such as
gaps, but also to the experimental approach used. Indeed,
in the human genome [9], isochores were taken to be at
least 200 kb in size, a condition linked to the need of
assessing standard deviations of the 100 Kb segments
used in the analysis. Expectedly, this occasionally led to
standard deviation higher than 3 % GC within a given isochore. Since however this only concerned ~7% of the
human genome such "transition isochores" were
accepted.
In the case of C. elegans long stretches of DNA very low in
GC and belonging to L1 isochores were present and interspersed short L2 isochores were neglected. If one accepts
in this case isochores reaching a low size value of 100 Kb,
the very long L1 structures are resolved into shorter
stretches and the high size values are brought back to the
0.5-1 Mb range. For instance, in the case of C. elegans the
large size (3.37 Mb) estimated according to the criteria of
Costantini et al. [9], is reduced to 1.00 Mb, if 100 Kb segments belonging to the GC range of L2 isochores (and
averaging 0.23 Mb in size) are considered separately. This
considerations also applies to the large size of major families of insects as indicated by thin 100-kb lines appearing
in the GC profiles.

Conclusion
The major conclusions of the present investigations are
the following: (i) an isochore structure appears to be general for all metazoans explored; this raises the question
whether, in fact, all eukaryotic genomes are characterized
by an isochore structure; current work on plants and unicellular eukaryotes should clarify this point; (ii) the isochore families are generally characterized by GC levels
that were identical or very close to those of vertebrates;
(iii) differences in dinucleotide patterns (observed/
expected values) were found among invertebrates, as well
as between invertebrates and vertebrates; in the latter case,
the most salient feature was the CpG shortage which is
due to the methylation of C in CpG followed by its deamination to T; this feature was also found in S. purpuratus
and B. floridae even if at a lower extent compared to mammals; (iv) the average size of isochore shows a certain variability, which is apparently due at least to a large extent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/538

to artefactual reasons, as discussed in the preceding section; (v) no correlation was found between isochore size
and genome size in spite of the very large genome size
range explored so far; this practical independence of isochore size on genome size stresses their possible correlation with the structure and replication of chromosomes,
as suggested by Costantini and Bernardi [6]; (vi) the relative amounts of isochore families are different in different
genomes, a situation due in our opinion to the different
environmental factors that play a role in determining
compositional patterns of genome (for example, if
Anopheles has a higher body temperature than Drodophilids it could explain the higher amounts of GC-rich isochores in A. gambiae); (vii) gene concentration increases
with increasing GC of isochore families, as previously
found for vertebrates.
These conclusions are in keeping with some previous suggestions [1]: that (i) the high similarity of GC levels of isochore families may be due to their composition being
linked to chromatin structure; (ii) the increasing variability in isochore patterns from warm- to cold-blooded vertebrates and to invertebrates may be correlated with the
increasing dependence from environmental factors that
affect genome organization and functions; (iii) the distribution of genes seems to be dictated by the need of a certain genomic context, whose composition influences the
transcriptional activity, and also the structure and function of the encoded proteins.

Methods
Genome and gene sequences
The sequences of the eukaryotic genomes as well as of the
genes analyzed in this study were downloaded from different websites (see Additional File 5). Partial, putative,
synthetic construct, predicted, not experimental, hypothetical protein, r-RNA, t-RNA, ribosomal and mitochondrial genes were eliminated and then the cleanup program
[13] was applied for ridding nucleotide sequence databases of redundancies. For the remaining genes a script
implemented by us was used in order to identify the coding sequences beginning with a start codon and ending
with a stop codon. The coordinates of genes on the chromosomes were retrieved from the website used for downloading the chromosomes.
Isochore mapping
The entire chromosomal sequences of the finished
genome assembly were partitioned into non-overlapping
100-kb windows, and their GC levels were calculated
using the program draw_chromosome_gc.pl [14,15]
(http://genomat.img.cas.cz; see Additional File 6).

The methodology used for isochore mapping was
described by Costantini et al. [9]. Briefly, isochores are

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:538

defined by two sets of data, GC levels and their standard
deviations. Indeed, when genome sequences are scanned
using four window sizes ranging from 12.5 to 100 kb, the
final choice of the window is determined by the plateau
values reached by the standard deviations [9]. Compositional jumps significantly larger than the standard deviations of isochore GC (1-2%) separate one isochore from
the contiguous ones (see Additional File 7 for the coordinates, sizes, GC levels and GC standard deviations of the
isochores identified in the analyzed genomes). When isochores are put in bins of 0.5 % or 1% GC, families appear
as well defined peaks. In the case of the human genome,
five isochore families were found which ranged in GC
from 34% to 58% and decreased in relative amounts with
increasing GC. These families were also detected by using
four different approaches that are based, however, on our
boundaries of isochore families [1,16].

In the case of Branchiostoma floridae, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Aedes aegypti, Tribolium castaneum and Daphnia
pulex, the genomes have not yet been assembled and only
the sequences of scaffolds or contigs (3032 scaffolds,
5477 scaffolds, 4758 supercontigs, 176 contigs, 5192 scaffolds, respectively) are available.

Nomenclature
As far as the name of each isochore is concerned, we used
here, as in previous work, a convention in which the first
number in the name represents the chromosome number,
the following two letters are the initials of the scientific
(latin) name of the Eukaryotes under consideration, and
the last number identifies the isochore.
