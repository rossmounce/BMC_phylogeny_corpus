Abstract
Background: De novo sequencing the entire genome of a large complex plant genome like the one
of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a major challenge both in terms of experimental feasibility and
costs. The emergence and breathtaking progress of next generation sequencing technologies has
put this goal into focus and a clone based strategy combined with the 454/Roche technology is
conceivable.
Results: To test the feasibility, we sequenced 91 barcoded, pooled, gene containing barley BACs
using the GS FLX platform and assembled the sequences under iterative change of parameters. The
BAC assemblies were characterized by N50 of ~50 kb (N80 ~31 kb, N90 ~21 kb) and a Q40 of
94%. For ~80% of the clones, the best assemblies consisted of less than 10 contigs at 24-fold mean
sequence coverage. Moreover we show that gene containing regions seem to assemble completely
and uninterrupted thus making the approach suitable for detecting complete and positionally
anchored genes.
By comparing the assemblies of four clones to their complete reference sequences generated by
the Sanger method, we evaluated the distribution, quality and representativeness of the 454
sequences as well as the consistency and reliability of the assemblies.
Conclusion: The described multiplex 454 sequencing of barcoded BACs leads to sequence
consensi highly representative for the clones. Assemblies are correct for the majority of contigs.
Though the resolution of complex repetitive structures requires additional experimental efforts,
our approach paves the way for a clone based strategy of sequencing the barley genome.

Background
Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is among the four most
important cereal crops worldwide [1]. But in contrast to
its agronomical importance efficient gene isolation and
genome-wide studies on genetic diversity are hampered
by the lack of a reference genome sequence. Such a reference would resolve barley's genetic outfit and would serve
as the essential basis to elucidate mechanisms underlying
phenotype and traits as well as processes towards plant's
adaptation and improvement.
Genome size (~5 Gb) and the high content of repetitive
DNA elements (>80%) are the major obstacles towards
sequencing the entire barley genome [2,3]. In contrast to
Sanger sequencing [4] for a budget of over 100 million
USD (T. Sasaki, personal communication) a medium
sized plant genome like rice (~400 Mb), the same
endeavor for barley was not affordable (for review see
[5]). Here, the massively parallel or "next generation
sequencing" (NGS) technologies, currently represented by
the 454/Roche, Solexa/Illumina and SOLID/ABI platforms, promise to change the situation since several Gigabases (Gb) of sequence data can be accumulated in a few
weeks for only a fraction of the costs of Sanger sequencing
(for review see [6-8]). NGS technology was successfully
applied to de novo and re-sequencing of entire prokaryotic
genomes [9] and to re-sequencing higher eukaryotes
including humans [10-13]. Recently, similar efforts were
made in plants by using the Solexa/Illumina platform for
re-sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana [14] and by a mixed
Sanger and 454/Roche sequencing strategy for grapevine
(Vitis vinifera) [15]. Whereas the relatively short read
lengths of the Solexa/Illumina (GAI/II) and ABI (SOLID)
platforms (35-75 and 30-50 bp, respectively) may not yet
match the requirements to sequence efficiently across
long stretches of repetitive DNA in barley, the 454/Roche
system (GS FLX) allows to generate average read lengths of
~250 bp (GS FLX) and ~400 bp (GS FLX Titanium) which
are potentially more appropriate to achieve the goals of de
novo sequencing in complex genomes. However, it
remains to be proven whether this holds true with regard
to the extraordinarily high content of repetitive DNA elements within the barley genome, often forming blocks
extending over regions of several 100 kb [16].
Independently of the platform, two different sequencing
strategies are widely used. Whole genome shotgun (WGS)
sequencing is based on random shearing of whole
genomic DNA and is preferentially applied to medium
sized genomes with limited amounts of repetitive DNA.
For plant genomes, WGS by NGS was so far restricted to
re-sequencing purposes if a reference sequence was available (i.e. Arabidopsis thaliana [14]) and to de novo sequencing (with or without NGS) of small and medium sized
genomes like strawberry (<200 Mb per haploid genome)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/547

[17,18] and Sorghum bicolor (~730 Mb) [19], or with support of non-NGS data (grapevine) [15].
The second, hierarchical shotgun (HS) approach is based
on sequencing bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC)
anchored to a physical map ("clone-by-clone" sequencing). This strategy is more costly than WGS but in return
is suitable to generate high quality reference sequences
even for highly repetitive genomes [5]. The map-based
strategy was not only applied to sequencing the human
genome but also to plant genomes such as Arabidopsis
[20], rice [21] and maize [22]. Due to its accuracy and reliability, the "clone-by-clone" strategy was also favored for
producing a high-quality reference sequence of the barley
genome [2,23].
Previously, it was demonstrated that genes could be
assembled into contigs when barley BACs were sequenced
by short reads of ~100 bp provided by the earlier 454/
Roche platform (GS20) at sequence coverage of ~10 - 20fold [24]. Similar results were obtained by sequencing
BAC clones of salmon (Salmo salar) using the GS FLX
(~250 bp read length), however, the potential of the
method to result in high-quality BAC clone sequences was
put in question [25].
Based on these initial studies the 454/Roche platform can
be considered a robust platform to assemble genes from
genomic sequences given sufficient sequence coverage.
However, at sequencing capacity of up to 500 Mb per single GS FLX Titanium run the sequencing of individual
BAC clones would be a rather non-economical approach
and efficient use of the technology would require the possibility of multiplexing individual samples. Recently,
pools of 28 BAC clones of wild rice Oryza barthii, selected
from fingerprinted contigs, were sequenced by the 454
technology and assembled to superscaffolds by mapping
to the O. sativa rice reference genome [26]. Due to the lack
of a reference genome this BAC pool sequencing approach
is not yet feasible for barley and multiplex sequencing
would require a reliable tagging (barcoding) strategy to
reveal sequence read and BAC clone origin relationships.
Barcodes are specific short sequence tags that can be introduced either before the 454 sequencing library preparation [27] or by ligation of individual adaptors ("MID" =
Multiplex Identifier", Roche Diagnostics) to fragmented
BAC DNAs prior to sequencing in pools.
Here, as a proof of concept for a new strategic component
of sequencing a large complex and highly repetitive crop
plant genome in a clone-by-clone approach, we report the
pool sequencing of 91 barcoded, randomly selected, gene
containing barley BACs by the 454 technology. Furthermore, we present the assembly of the sequence data under

variable parameters and evaluate the resulting assemblies
for their consistency and reliability.

Results
Sequencing and preassembly processing
Initially, 91 non-overlapping BACs were selected based on
the information to carry at least one gene [28]. Five of
these clones, were previously Sanger-sequenced by others
and deposited at NCBI Genbank (Additional file 1: Table
S1). Whereas the sequence of one BAC clone (318G23) is
an unfinished HTGS1 phase entry [29] encompassing 19
unordered contigs, the four others (184G09, 259I16,
631P08 and 711N16) were available as finished sequence
and served as reference to monitor the quality of the 454
sequencing and assembly. In the following these four
clones are referred to as 'reference BACs'.

In two different laboratories, one set each of 43 independent BACs plus the same five reference BACs were barcode
tagged by two different strategies and sequenced in pools
on Roche GS FLX sequencers.
For the vast majority of all reads (98.8% set 1; 94% set 2),
the correct barcoding adaptor motifs could be recognized
allowing the unambiguous assignment of sequences to
the corresponding BACs. This resulted in 11,990 reads per
clone on average except for 8 BACs of set 1 with less than
3,000 sequences per clone (Additional file 1: Table S1),
prompting to re-sequence them. After that, altogether the
BACs of both sets were represented by 1,221,350 reads
(Table 1). Since absolute accuracy and lack of any bias in
clone size estimation, barcoding, determination of DNA
concentration, equimolar pooling and library preparation
is rather impossible, deviations from the expected equal
read recovery rate per BAC clone were expected. In fact,
with a ratio of minimum to maximum number of reads
per BAC of 1:16 (1,817/29,180 reads) we observed such
deviations as illustrated in Fig. 1 and Additional file 1:
Table S1.
After clipping of the BAC specific barcodes the obtained
sequences were processed following the assembly pipeline depicted in Fig. 2. In the preprocessing phase, reads
derived from BAC vector and E. coli DNA were discarded
(mean 3% and 8% of all reads, respectively) leaving
1,086,323 sequences with average read length of 221 bp

(Table 1) for assembly. Presuming that the combined
length of all contigs per assembly represented the overall
BAC insert length, the obtained sequencing coverage by
454 reads ranged between 9.4× and 64.4× per individual
BAC clone (ratio 1:7) with an average of 24.3×. If considering the accumulated contig length per BAC after assembly equals true insert length (see below and Additional file
1: Table S1) this coverage corresponded to average 10,610
reads per 100 kb insert.
Mapping 454 sequences to Sanger references
To evaluate how completely and evenly the clone inserts
were represented by the obtained sequences we mapped
the 454 reads of the reference BACs from both sets to the
complete Sanger sequences by BlastN [30] (Additional file
2: Table S2). Considering all BlastN matches with e-values
< 10-10, altogether 908,757 out of 915,896 reference positions (99.985%) were hit by 454 reads. A similar result
was obtained by evaluating exclusively the best BlastN
alignments. If two or more hits with the same maximum
match score were obtained, one of the alternative hits was
randomly chosen. By this algorithm 915,705 reference
positions (99.979%) were covered.

Examination of the BlastN alignments also provided distribution patterns of the 454 reads along the Sanger reference sequences, as exemplarily illustrated for BACs
259I16 and 711N16 from both sets (Fig. 3). For all eight
alignments, 911,957 positions of the reference sequences
(99.6%) were covered by at least five sequences. Only
3,939 positions (0.4%) were covered less than fivefold.
Optimal assembly parameters differ both between BACs
and sequence sets
For assembly of the 454 sequences we tested initially the
program Newbler (Roche), and subsequently MIRA [31].
Since all assemblies obtained with the latter program
resulted in significantly higher N50/N80 contig lengths
and less gaps when compared to the Sanger references,
sequence assembly by Newbler was skipped for further
analysis of the data. Using MIRA, hss and bph ("hash saving step" and "bases per hash", see methods section for
details) were the two parameters which most strongly
influenced contig numbers and lengths during assembly.
However, while systematically changing the values of
these parameters during assembly of all BAC clones, we

were not able to identify a distinct or at least a restricted
number of hss/bph combinations that outperformed others in regard to yielding the largest contigs for each individual BAC. The most suitable hss/bph combination to
obtain the longest contigs differed between BACs as well
as the set in which the data were generated (Fig. 4, Additional file 3: Figure S1, Additional file 4: Figure S2, Additional file 5: Figure S3).
Sequence assembly under iterative parameter changes
Since optimal ab initio assembly parameters could not be
defined, the clipped sequences were assembled by MIRA
with 279 iterative changes of the hss/bph parameter set
for each of the 96 BAC data sets, resulting in 26,784
assemblies. For each clone, the assembly with the largest
contig was defined as the 'best assembly' and selected for
further analyses. As expected from the parameter optimization attempts (Fig. 4), this approach led to assemblies
with less and larger contigs as compared with assemblies
obtained under default settings (hss 4, bph 16) (Fig. 5,
Additional file 6: Figure S4, Additional file 7: Figure S5).

For 68% (65 of 96) of the best assemblies, the largest contig spanned more than 50 kb. In 76 assemblies (79%), the
number of contigs >1 kb was lower than 10 at a 21× mean
sequence coverage, in 92 assemblies (96%) lower than 30
with a 20× mean coverage. Fig. 6 summarizes the 96 best
assemblies by depicting all contigs larger than 1 kb.
Altogether, the 96 best alignments spanned 10,106,812
bp in 766 contigs >1 kb (Table 2) with N50>48.9 kb (N80
30.9 kb, N90 20.7 kb) and an average coverage of 22×. In
terms of sequence quality 94%, 97% and 99% of the
sequence were represented with Phred confidence values
[32] above Q40, Q30 and Q20, respectively. A detailed
inspection for sequencing errors was done by comparing
the contigs of the 8 best MIRA assemblies with the Sanger
reference sequences (Additional file 8: Table S3). Over a

total length of 879,457 bp inspected sequence, 170 differences were found, thereof 39 single base exchanges and
131 single base insertions/deletions. This corresponded to
a mean Phred confidence value of Q37, ranging from Q36
to Q40 among the 8 assemblies. The majority of sequencing errors was identified within homo-nucleotide
stretches (112 differences, 66% of all). This type of error is
known as intrinsic for the pyrosequencing based 454 technology. These errors could be resolved by additional
sequences generated by other technologies.
The assemblies of six BACs from set 1 resulted in exceptionally high contig numbers or particularly short contig
lengths compared to the other clones (Fig. 6 arrows and
Additional file 9: Table S4). For two BACs (545E16,
576E07), this is due to low amounts of 454 reads even
after re-sequencing (less than 2,500 per clone). Another
two clones (565E21, 575D20) have considerably longer
inserts than the others (>180 kb compared to ~110 kb as
proved by restriction fingerprinting analysis) and were
therefore not sufficiently covered by 454 reads to get satisfactory assemblies. For 551K24 a fair number of reads
was obtained but the assembly represented only 87% of
the insert length expected by restriction fingerprinting.
Here, repetitive regions were assumed as underlying reason since parts of three contigs in the assembly are covered by more sequences than the two-fold median of the
entire clone (Additional file 10: Figure S6). In the 569H14
assembly, parts of nearly all contigs were overrepresented
by 454 reads indicating a high amount of repetitive structures hampering an assembly with less contigs (Additional file 11: Figure S7).

112,920)). The horizontal line indicates the average read coverage.
Consistency of assemblies
To evaluate the assembly completeness and consistency,
we compared in detail the best MIRA assemblies of the
four reference BACs from both sets to their Sanger-derived
sequences which were assumed to reflect the genuine BAC
inserts. These comparisons resulted in eight tuple plots
(Additional file 6: Figure S4) and showed that globally all
parts of the reference sequence were represented in the
454 assemblies. Within the entire set of 45 contigs >1 kb
we observed nine mis-assemblies in nine contigs (set 1:
four, set 2: five). Four out of the five sequence parts
affected by wrong assemblies in set 2 were identical to
those in set 1 indicating that always the same repetitive
structures were the underlying cause. Indeed, by closer
inspection of the mis-assembled regions, different types of

repetitive elements were identified which caused all incorrect assemblies (Fig. 5, other data not shown). Thus, by
the chosen assembly strategy we can estimate that about
1.1 mis-assemblies (9 in 8 BAC assemblies) can be
expected per BAC, preferentially in repetitive regions.
Based on 9 mis-assembled contigs out of 45 in the reference BAC clones, about 153 out of 766 contigs >1 kb
(20%) might be affected within the entire dataset of >10
Mb.
Gene content and representation

clones contained genes and to measure the completeness
and sequence integrity of the respective genes, we compared all contigs of the best MIRA assemblies with three

protein (Sorghum bicolor, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza
sativa) [19,33,21] and two EST libraries (Hordeum vulgare,
Triticum aestivum) [34]. The protein and EST references
were aligned against the contigs using GenomeThreader
[35] and the coverage of the query sequences against the
homologous regions was measured as a proxy for completeness of the respective gene locus and to evaluate
assembly correctness on gene containing regions on the
Hordeum contigs (Additional file 12: Table S5).
On the contig level, Brachypodium proteins hit 109 contigs, rice 97 and Sorghum 95 contigs. 115 contigs were hit
by at least one protein entry, 84 were hit by all three libraries. On the BAC level, Brachypodium proteins hit 71 BACs,
rice 69 and Sorghum 66 BACs. A total of 73 out of 87 BACs
hit at least one protein, 63 BACs contained at least one
gene that showed similarity to all three databases. The
reproducibly larger number of sequence matches with
genes of Brachypodium was consistent with the closer phylogenetic relationship to barley compared to the two other
fully sequenced grass reference genomes of rice and Sorghum [36]. A comparison to barley and wheat ESTs
revealed 1,299 hits (1,154 unique) and 1,874 hits (1,558
unique), respectively.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/547

In total, 115 genes or gene fragments were identified. 84
(73%) were supported by hits to all grass model species
(Brachypodium, rice and Sorghum), 18 (16%) to two and
13 (11%) to only one grass species. For 89 genes (77%),
on average >0.95 of the gene was covered, for 112 genes
(97%) ≥ 0.8. This indicated that the genomic sequences of
the orthologous barley genes were almost completely represented on the contigs (Fig. 7). However, for three genes
(2.6% of all) a representation <0.8 was determined, indicating a partial presence in the respective assemblies. To
analyze the underlying reasons, the assemblies were manually inspected. In one gene locus a frameshift was found
causing an interrupted alignment. Adjustment of the
frameshift resulted in an uninterrupted reading frame
with full gene coverage. The second case of under-representation has potentially been caused by a truncated pseudogene, as indicated by the absence of start and stop
codon and the lack of complementary gene fragments on
other contigs. Finally, for the third gene we found two
complementary fragments located on two contigs from
the respective BAC. Thus in summary, for 114 of 115 predicted genes (99%) the assembly resulted in coherent
gene loci on individual contigs and only one gene
appeared to be split between two contigs.
We also tested for consistency of exon order and orientation to identify potential mis-assemblies. No such events
were observed. Thus, using gene containing regions as a
measure we found no evidence for wrong assemblies indicated by missing exons, wrong exon order or orientation
(flipped/reverse exons).

Discussion
The high-throughput capacity of next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms promises new possibilities for
sequencing large and complex genomes. Due to shorter
read length as typically obtained in comparison to classical Sanger sequencing the full potential for de novo
sequencing of plant genomes carrying more than 80%
repetitive DNA, however, still needs to be demonstrated
for NGS technologies. In the present pilot study we prove
that 454 sequencing of pools of barcoded barley BACs
and automated, sequence assembly can efficiently contribute to map-based clone-by-clone whole genome
sequencing of a Triticeae genome. Sequencing of 91 barley
BAC clones including four clones sequenced twice with
independent strategies and comparison to the complete
Sanger reference sequences revealed that 20-25 fold shotgun sequencing routinely lead to HTGS phase 1 assemblies (unfinished sequence containing gaps, order and
relative orientation of the pieces not known; [29]). Furthermore, mapping of sequence reads to the Sanger references demonstrated the evenness of read distribution
except for repetitive regions of high nucleotide identities.

assemblies after iterative parameter changes. Contigs larger than 1 kb were concatenated after directing and ordering by comparison to the Sanger reference sequence, horizontal green lines mark contig borders. Whereas in the default assembly of
184G09 (A) the longest contig is wrongly assembled in the region homolog to 102.5-108.0 kb (red rectangle) of the reference,
the best assembly (C) results in a single contig accurately fitting the Sanger sequence. In contrast, the assembly problem in
repetitive regions of 711N16 (B, D) even can not be resolved by the best assembly although turning out in less contigs ("collapsed" sequences, see text).

Sequence output and assembly conditions
Sequence read length is known to be one of the key
parameters influencing the efficiency to sequence and
assemble stretches of repetitive DNA of a genome. In the
present study, reads with average lengths between 200250 bp were obtained, which are typical for the 454/
Roche GS FLX platform. At a 20-25-fold sequence coverage, the majority of the assemblies achieved HTGS phase
I quality with N50 ~50 kb and less than 10 unordered
contigs. This is comparable to a typical Sanger shotgun
sequencing to 6-fold or higher coverage. Although it can
not be ruled out that pre-selection of the clones for gene
content may have positively influenced the assembly per-

formance and results, this indicated that neither the moderate sequence lengths nor the high repeat content of the
genome caused principle limitations for de novo sequencing of gene-containing barley BACs by the 454 technology.
Our results differed from those of another study describing the 454 sequencing of pooled but not barcoded
salmon BAC clones [25]. Here, the obtained moderate
contig lengths (N50 ~11.5 kb; largest contig ~34 kb) were
interpreted as indication that considering 454 FLX
sequencing without additional paired end sequences
alone would provide a too limited strategy in context of a

complex eukaryotic genome sequencing project. Yet to
our understanding the moderate contig lengths could be
caused by the limitations of the Newbler assembly software. In our study, with the sequences of the reference
BACs, Newbler produced assemblies in which different
copies of repetitive elements were not correctly separated.
In contrast, MIRA [31] could resolve these structures and
superior assemblies were obtained. However, not only the
assembly algorithm influences contig length. Assembly
quality is usually negatively correlated to the concentration of related repeated DNA elements in the target
sequence. Pooling BAC clones without barcoding would
extend the overall sequence length to be assembled and
thus increases the chance for coincidental presence of
members of highly conserved repetitive element families
in the selected set of pooled BACs. This ultimately interferes with assembly quality and thus may explain to some
extent the shorter assemblies obtained in case of Salmon/
Newbler.

Applying iterative changes of different MIRA assembly
parameters revealed that mainly hss (hash saving step)
and bph (bases per hash) affected the outcome of the
assemblies. Aiming for those with the largest contig per
individual clone as the postulated best assemblies, the key
parameters were found to be variable and unpredictable.
This holds true not only for the assembly of different
BACs but also when assembling the sequences of the same
BAC from different sequencing sources (sets 1 and 2). Different hss and bph parameters leading to the best assemblies of different BACs indicated that at a given minimum
sequence coverage individual features like repeat content
and/or composition may essentially influence the quality
of the assembly. The fact that different sequence sets from
the same BAC - although both being representative for the
sequenced clone - required different parameters for yielding a 'best' assembly, suggested that experimental and stochastic conditions like fragmentation profile, library
representativeness and sequence length distribution influenced the outcome of the assemblies. Furthermore, it can-

not be ruled out that the sequential order of individual
reads fed into the assembly controlled the final outcome
of the assembly.
With respect to these findings, iterative assembly with as
many as reasonable parameter permutations as carried
out in our study, seemed appropriate while consuming
considerable computing time and performance. Selection
of the best assembly as the one with the largest contig
might be questionable, since production of chimeric contigs can be suspected and other metrics are probably better
indicators for a low number of mis-assemblies. To address
this we counted mis-assemblies and chimeric contigs in
assemblies selected by the best N50, N80, and N90 values
and by default parameters, respectively (Additional file
13: Table S6). As a result, compared to the largest contig
metric (nine mis-assemblies in our reference BACs) N50,
N80 and N90 led to similar numbers (nine, eight and
nine, respectively) and application of the default MIRA
parameters even produced 11 errors. Furthermore, except
for one case (184G09 set2), none of the alternative metrics generated less chimeric contigs than the respective
largest contig assemblies. This indicated that selection of
the latter metrics did not warrant for the lowest number of
mis-assemblies but was indeed a reasonable criterion due
to lack of expensive validation experiments.
Assemblies, genes and repeat structures
For de novo sequenced BACs we demonstrated that all
genes present on the clones were practically completely
represented in the best MIRA assemblies. Furthermore,
with the exception of one gene, all ORFs were found uninterrupted by gaps between contigs. This outcome has been
postulated before in another pilot study applying the
Roche/454 GS20 sequencing to barley BACs [24]. There-

fore, the selected approach of pooled BAC sequencing
should enable to survey the entire gene content of the targeted BACs. Other, maybe more cost effective, approaches
of reduced representation sequencing were published that
are suited to survey gene content of a complex genome
(for review see [19]). However, our presented strategy of
barcoded BAC-pool sequencing delivered not only fully
assembled gene sequences instead of partial gene information but could also serve as the basal approach for
whole genome clone-by-clone sequencing in complex
plant genomes.
On the other hand, comparing the assemblies of the four
reference BACs to the Sanger-derived sequences also
revealed limitations of the automated assembly of complex repetitive DNA regions. Mis-assemblies in these
clones were observed preferentially in LTR regions of retrotransposons. LTR transposons are very frequent in barley and the occurrence of such elements with nucleotide
identities of up to >99% in several copies is known to
complicate even the assembly of Sanger sequenced BACs.
Wrong assemblies in regions harboring such elements
typically can occur in two ways:
(I) Sequences derived from different copies of the repeat
"collapse" into one single region, finally "shortening" the
consensus sequence (shown for BAC 711N16 in Fig. 5B,
D). Since this normally should be accompanied by significantly increased sequence coverage in the "collapsed"
region, those effects are possibly amenable to automated
pattern recognition and thus could become corrected by
reassembly under modified conditions. The "collapse"
assembly problem is a strong argument for the selection
of the assembly producing the largest contig as the optimal one. However, the fact that the best assembly of

184G09 (set 2) produced the largest contig by falsely
resolving the retrotransposon structure (Additional file 6:
Figure S4 b), whereas, in contrast, the default assembly
produced shorter contigs but no mis-assembly (Additional file 7: Figure S5 j), indicated that the "largest-isbest-rule" remains a simplification and is not universally
valid.
(II) Repetitive sequences are correctly split into different
copies but the copies are arranged in the wrong order and/
or direction. This type of incorrect assembly can not be
detected without the availability of a reference sequence
or knowledge about the involved types of repeats.
In both cases the use of paired end/mated pair sequencing
approaches may help to overcome such shortcomings in
the future. Paired-end sequencing applications are available and protocols for the preparation of libraries with read
distances of ~200 bp ("paired end") and 2-5 kb ("mated
pairs") were successfully applied [37-39]. In combination
with the barcoding step this strategy may introduce inacceptable additional labour to the BAC pool sequencing.
Therefore, additional non-barcoded paired end/mate-pair
libraries could be prepared for an alternative higher
throughput, shorter read NGS platform from the same
sets of BACs which were already processed as barcoded
pools by the 454 technology. Assembly errors in structural
variants could be resolved in a similar context by deep
coverage paired end Illumina sequencing with different
fragment size in human whole genome sequencing [12].
In our case, as an example, the untagged fragments of 2
pools of 48 BACs (~10.6 Mb non redundant sequence)
could be mixed and converted into Illumina paired end
and/or mate pair libraries, respectively. Sequencing of
such a library in just one lane on the Illumina GAII platform usually could produce 2 × 8 Mio. reads at affordable
costs. This would deliver clone coverages between ~150×
for a 200 bp distance paired end library and ~1,500× for a
2 kb distance mate pair library. Reads from the 200 bp
insert library may only resolve errors in homopolymer
stretches known as a methodological shortcoming of the
454 pyrosequencing method. In contrast, sequences from
the longer distance mate pair library will help to bridge
and order contigs of the 454 assemblies since the distance
between the corresponding reads should be larger than
repetitive elements hampering the joining of contigs. Furthermore, assembly errors will be identified by verification of direction and distance of the mate read pairs. Such
a mixed two step strategy should allow the establishment
of a largely automated BAC assembly and verification
pipeline.

Conclusion
Proving the initial concept, our study has demonstrated
that multiplex sequencing of barcoded BACs by the 454

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/547

technology is appropriate for a clone based strategy of
sequencing complex plant genomes. Though the content
of complex repeat structures causes pitfalls for the assembly process, the sequence information obtained with a
>20× coverage was highly representative for gene containing barley BACs by producing assemblies with N50 ~50
kb (N80 ~31 kb, N90 ~21 kb) and Q40 ~94%, which in
most cases yielded phase I assemblies (unordered contigs,
less than 10 gaps). Whereas the majority of contigs were
expected to be correctly assembled in their gene loci, BACs
harbouring complex repetitive structures will require
additional experimental efforts to yield final assemblies.
This may encompass paired end genomic sequencing
approaches as well as gap closure by primer walking and
Sanger sequencing of individual reads.

Methods
BAC sequencing
91 BACs derived from a barley BAC library [40] were
sequenced in two independent sets of 48 BACs (Additional file 1: Table S1) containing the same five BAC
clones for which reference sequences were generated by
the Sanger method and are available at NCBI Genbank
(Additional file 1: Table S1; BACs 1-5). Set 1 (BACs 1-48)
was sequenced in two pools by proprietary protocols at
Eurofins MWG Biotech [41] whereas set 2 (BACs 1-5 and
49-91) was sequenced following the procedure described
below. Sequence assembly was performed for all clones
under the same procedures as described below. The
sequences of all 91 BACs were submitted to NCBI Genbank as raw data as well as and assembled unordered contigs larger than 0.5 kb (NCBI short read archive ID:
SRP001149; Genome Project 37963).
BAC preparation
DNAs of the clones reported in this study (BACs 1-5 and
49-91) were prepared by an adapted "Maxi-Prep" protocol
which after sequencing resulted in E. coli read ratios of 8%
on average (Additional file 1: Table S1). Although not
atypical for BAC preparations and suitable for the high
throughput sequencing process, the procedure was optimized and applied to more than 1,000 barley BACs.
Sequencing of these BACs resulted in a much lower mean
E. coli sequence ratio of 3.1% with only 26 out of 1,028
clones (2.5%) contaminated by >10% of E. coli reads
(data not shown). The following protocol describes this
optimized version: The BACs were incubated in 2 × 20 ml
TB (6 μg/mL chloramphenicol) for 15 hours at 325 rpm
(36°C) and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The pellets were completely re-suspended on ice in 4 mL 10 mM
EDTA. 8 mL 1% SDS/0.2 M NaOH were added without
mixing and left on ice for 10 min followed by addition of
6 mL 3 M potassium acetate (15 min on ice). After centrifugation for 20 min at 4000 rpm the supernatant was filtered, 12 mL isopropanol were added and the solution

was centrifuged again for 15 min at 4000 rpm. Re-suspension of the pellet was done in 1.5 mL 10 mM Tris/50 mM
EDTA and 1 mL 7.5 M potassium acetate and the mixture
was frozen for 30 min at -80°C. After re-thawing the suspensions were centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 rpm. The
supernatant was transferred to 5 mL 96% ethanol, centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 rpm, and the pellet was re-suspended in 400 μl 50 mM Tris/50 mM EDTA. After
incubation with 50 μg RNAse for 1 h at 37°C, threefold
extraction with phenol/chloroforme/isoamyl alcohol
(400 μl each; centrifugation 10 min 14000 rpm) was carried out. 280 μl isopropanol were added and the tube was
kept at -20°C over night. After centrifugation (10 min
14000 rpm) and washing with 500 μl 80% ethanol the
pellet was air-dried and dissolved in 200 μl TE by shaking
1 h at 42°C. The second precipitation was performed with
20 μL 1 M NaCl/550 μL 96% ethanol for 20 min at -80°C,
followed by centrifugation (10 min 14000 rpm) and
washing (500 μL 80% ethanol). After air-drying the pellet
was dissolved in 50 μl TE.
Insert sizes of BAC clones were determined by pulsed-field
agarose gel-electrophoresis (PFGE) in 1% UltraPure™-agarose (Invitrogen), 18 h, 120°, 5/15 sec switchtimes, 6 V/
cm and 14°C. NotI restriction was performed with 200 ng
of BAC-plasmid-DNA, 5 Units of NotI (New England
Biolabs), 1× NEBuffer 3, 1 μg/ml BSA for 4 h.

Manual (Roche Diagnostics). Single stranded 454
sequencing libraries were quantified by a qPCR assay [42]
and processed by emulsion PCR and sequencing as
described in the GS FLX manuals (Roche Diagnostics).
The BACs of set 2 were sequenced in pools of 12 clones
(BACs 49-60; BACs 61-72) and 24 clones (BACs 1-5 and
73-91, respectively, loading three times a half 70 × 75
Picotiterplate (PTP) with 900,000 beads each.
Sequence processing and assemblies
As shown in Fig. 2, prior to assembly, all 454 reads were
screened for DNA from vector and E. coli by BlastN [30]
against the sequence of pBeloBAC11 (GenBank U51113,
pos. 2391...5890, i.e. the part from 2 kb downstream to 2
kb upstream of the HindIII cloning site) and the genomes
of E. coli DH10B (GenBank:NC_010473) and K-12 substrain MG1655 (GenBank:U00096). All 454 sequences
with matches e-value < 10-10 were excluded from the subsequent assemblies. Vector sequences derived from
regions GenBank U51113, pos. 1...2390 and 5891...7507
were retained in the datasets for assembly by this
approach in order to get complete representation of the
vector-insert spanning clone regions. Contigs in the BAC
assemblies containing these vector sequence parts were
then shortened to the cloning site. In addition, the barcoding motifs as well as low quality regions identified by
the GS FLX software were marked to be ignored for the
assembly.

Barcoding of BAC DNA fragments
About 5 μg of each BAC DNA were individually fragmented for 1 min at 3 bar N2 by nebulizers (part of GS
DNA Library Preparation Kit, Roche Diagnostics) resulting in average fragment lengths of 700-800 bp. The nebulized DNAs were purified by MinElute columns
(Qiagen) and eluted in 20 μl TE each. Blunt end repair,
ligation of the barcoding adaptors to the fragments as well
as all other steps prior preparation of the 454 sequencing
library were carried out essentially as described in [27]
using 500 ng of each nebulized DNA as starting material
(Quant-IT® PicoGreen® ds DNA assay; Invitrogen). Barcode oligonucleotides (desalted) were purchased at Metabion (Martinsried, Germany) and consisted of the
barcode (3'end, Additional file 14: Table S7) and its
reverse complement (5'end), separated by the SrfI recognition site 5'-GCCCGGGC-3'. After careful quantification
of the barcoded BAC-DNAs by the PicoGreen® assay, 10 ng
of each BAC-DNA were pooled and the pool was proceeded to the dephosphorylation step, followed by SrfI
digest and small fragment removal.

The pre-processed reads were assembled by Newbler
(Roche), version 2.0, and MIRA, developmental version
2.9.26x3 [31]. Assemblies were run on a high performance 42 nodes Linux Cluster, consisting of 4 GB RAM
Dual Opteron computers using Rocks4 as operating system. For MIRA, Skim3 Parameters were fitted individually
for each BAC. Skim3 as part of the MIRA program is an
algorithm related to SSAHA [43], which is used for a preselection of related reads. This is done by converting reads
into hashes and storing them in a table. Length of each
hash-word is given by the parameter "bases per hash"
(bph) and the granularity of words being stored per read
is given by "hash saving steps" (hss). Several tests showed
that the quality of an assembly depends essentially on
these parameters. Since best fitting parameters are hardly
to predict, all combinations were executed. The parameter
ranges were 6-30 for bph and 1-12 for hss. Given that
using in combination a larger hss than bph value is not
making any sense, we performed 279 assemblies for each
BAC.

The SrfI digested and purified BAC fragment pool DNA
was used to prepare the 454 sequencing library using the
GS DNA Library Preparation Kit, following the instructions of the GS FLX Shotgun DNA Library Preparation
