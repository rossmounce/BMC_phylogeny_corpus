Abstract
Background: After perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus, infants of anti-HBe positive HBsAg
carrier mothers may develop fulminant hepatitis B. Previously it has been suggested, that fulminant
hepatitis B in adults was associated with specific mutations in the HBV-genome. The aim of this
study was to investigate, whether specific viral variants are associated with fulminant hepatitis B in
young infants.
Methods: The complete HBV-genomes of five mothers and their infants with fulminant hepatitis
were isolated from the sera, amplified and directly sequenced.
Results: Between 6 and 43 base pair exchanges between the HBV genomes of the infants and their
mothers were identified. The mutations spread over the entire virus genome. Nucleotide
exchanges in the basic core promotor and precore region were identified in all cases. A
heterogeneous virus population was detected in four mothers.
Conclusions: Many new mutations were proved to emerge during fulminant hepatitis B in infants,
who had been perinatally infected. HBeAg negative variants were the predominant population in all
children, whereas these mutants could only be detected as subpopulations in four mothers. The
data suggest that the selection of a specific HBeAg negative viral strain may be associated with the
development of fulminant hepatitis B in children.

Background
To date, the pathogenic mechanism leading to the different clinical courses of hepatitis B in early childhood is
largely unknown. Without immunization, 90% of the
babies born to HBeAg-positive mothers develop a chronic
carrier status. On the other side children of anti-HBe positive mothers become less frequently infected, but are at
considerable risk to develop fulminant hepatitis B (FHB).
The clinical outcome is poor and without liver transplantation most of these patients die at the age of 3–5 months.

Both, host and virus specific factors are considered to have
an important impact on the clinical course.
FHB in adults has been associated with mutations in the
basic core promotor BCP (1762 A to T and 1764 G to A)
[1] and the precore region (1896 G to A) [2,3]. A number
of additional changes have been identified in cis acting
regulatory elements and the four open reading frames
including mutations of the pre-S2 start codon. It was suggested that these mutations may influence viral

replication and alter the HBV-protein expression [4-6]. In
a study from Sterneck et al. the full length genome analysis of one mother-child pair with fulminant disease did
not show the presence of a particular HBV-strain in both
individuals [7]. However, in a previous study we were able
to demonstrate that a mixed virus pool was present in
80% of the chronically infected mothers and that certain
variants emerged in the infants regarding the BCP and precore region [8].
Since in most studies only specific regions of the virus had
been analyzed, it is yet unclear, if sequence differences do
exist in other parts of the genome. In this context neonatal
hepatitis represents an interesting "in vivo" model for two
reasons: First, newborns have a partly immature immune
system with the possibility of tolerance and may have
maternal antibodies against HBV, so that an exaggerated
immune response concerning the hepatitis B virus infection rarely occurs in the first months of live. Second, the
viral population isolated in mothers and newborns can be
directly compared with each other.
The aim of our study was to identify mutations in the
entire hepatitis B virus genome, which might play a role in
fulminant hepatitis in infants. Since only rare data are currently available in children, we analysed the complete
viral nucleotide sequences of five chronic HBsAg carrier
mothers and their infants who died of fulminant hepatitis
B.

load below 50.000 virions per ml. However, HBV DNA
ascertainment by PCR revealed a positive result. In the
phase of progressive liver failure HBV DNA determination
remained then negative.
Methods
The serological markers of viral infection were tested
using commercial radioimmunoassays (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL). HBV-DNA was determined quantatively
by a liquid hybridization assay (Hybride Capture Systems,
Digene Diagnostics, Beltsville, MD).

An aliquot of 200 µl of each patient's serum was obtained
to isolate viral DNA with the QuiaAmp blood kit (Quiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The DNA was eluted with 50 µl distilled water according to the manufacturer's
recommendations. The HBV DNA isolated was amplified
by PCR in 50 µl of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 1 U of Taq DNA-Pwo
Polymerase (Expand High Fidelity assay, Boehringer Mannheim) and 30 pmol of primers P1–P8. The PCR was performed for 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 58°C for 1 min
and 72°C for 1 min in a thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer
Cetus, Norwalk, CT). The PCR products were visualized
by 2% agarose electrophoresis and stained with ethidium
bromide. A second PCR was carried out for samples not
detectable after the first amplification. To minimize artificial mutations introduced by PCR, all fragments were
amplified twice with a proofreading DNA polymerase.

Methods
Patients
The mothers were clinically asymptomatic HBsAg carriers
from caucasian origin in the age of 20–24 years and had
normal liver function parameters. With one exception
(mother M4) all of them had seroconverted to anti-HBe
and no HBV-DNA was detectable with a commercial
hybridization assay. All patients were negative for antibodies against hepatitis C, hepatitis D and human immunodeficiency virus. Since the carrier status of the mothers
was unknown at the date of delivery and serological investigations during pregnancy were refused, the infants happened not to be immunized against HBV postnatally.
Diagnosis of chronic HBV infection in the mothers was
established after discovering the disease in their children.
The perinatally infected infants developed fulminant hepatitis B with progressive liver failure at the age of 3–4
months and died 4–6 weeks after the onset of symptoms.
The clinical course was characterized by increasing jaundice and decreasing liver function parameters, particularly
clotting factors. At the time of diagnosis the children were
HBsAg and anti-HBe seropositive and had moderately elevated transaminases (ALAT 60 – 120 U/l). HBV DNA in
serum was not detectable by the commercial liquid
hybridization assay, indicating low viremia with a viral

The four overlapping HBV fragments (plus and minus
strands) were directly sequenced twice with 16 different
sense and antisense primers using a Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit (ABI PRISM, Foster City, CA) in an automated sequencer model 377 (ABI). According to Leitner et
al. [9] very small populations of sequence variants can be
detected with this method. Additionally in all cases parts
of the genome were subcloned and sequenced.
Sequence alignments were performed using the
Sequencher 3.0 software program. The HBV-DNA
sequences were assigned to the appropriate genotype
according to Li et al. [10]. Additionally, sequences were
genotyped by alignment to published HBV sequences of
genotypes A to E including the two strains HT and FH
which were isolated from patients with FHB (Genbank/
EMBL no. M57663, X02763, V00866, E00010, X6525759, M32138, X02496, V01460, I08805, I27106; L08805
and L27106). The sequences were aligned according to
Galibert [11]. The first base pair is the first T residue in the
EcoRI recognition site. Nucleotide differences between
mother and infant were defined as mutations. The reference genome [11] is depicted for better comparison (Figure 1).

Results
Analysis of the complete HBV DNA sequences
The nucleotide sequences of the HBV genomes analysed
from mothers and infants were most closely related to the
HBV genome of genotype D, which was therefore used as
the reference genome [11] for comparative analysis (Figure 1). In comparison with this strain, multiple mutations
were found in all isolates, which were distributed over the
entire genome. Mutations occurring in the HBV genomes
of both, mother and child compared to the reference
genome are not listed. In our analysis we particularly
focused on the sequence differences between the HBV
populations obtained from the mother-child pairs (Figure
1 and Table 1).
Nucleotide exchanges between mothers and infants
27, 6, 43, 22 and 33 nucleotide exchanges were identified
between the HBV isolates from mothers and infants. The
mutations were distributed over the entire HBV genome
and a few hot spots (Figure 2). Many mutations were rare
or unique compared with the other genomes investigated.
A specific mutation that occurred "de novo" in the HBV
genomes of all 5 infants could not be identified. Several
base pair exchanges occurred in at least 2 of the 5 infant
HBV genomes investigated (nucleotides 144, 930, 1764,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/4/11

1940, 2174, 2452, 2797, 3072, 3102). However, 4 mutations (nucleotides 1762, 3067 and 1896, 1899) were
overrepresented (60–100%) in the cases of fulminant
hepatitis compared to the chronic carriers (Figure 1).
Since mutations in promotor-enhancer regions may be of
particular functional relevance, these regions were analyzed in detail. 71 mutations were located within the 5 cisacting regulatory elements (Figure 2).
A total of 10 mutations were located in the predicted
stem-loop structure of the encapsidation signal ε, whereas
nucleotides 1896 and 1899 were overrepresented (in 5 of
5 and 4 of 5 infants). The mutation at position 1896-A is
responsible for the generation of an in-frame translation
stop codon in the precore region.
Six mutations occurred in the surface promotor I (SP I)
and 23 base pair exchanges were observed in the Surface
Promotor II (SPII).
14 and 18 mutations occurred in the enhancer I-X promotor (ENH I-X) and in the enhancer II-core promotor
region (ENH II-CP). The glucocorticoid response element
(GRE) was conserved in all HBV isolates.
Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences
Many of the mutations resulted in amino acid changes in
one or two open reading frames (ORF) (Figure 3). A total
of 114 amino acid subsitutions were observed (Figure 3).
The pre-C /C gene had 9 and 14 amino acid changes. The
HBeAg synthesis was abrogated in all infants due to a precore stop codon, whereas this stop codon was detected as
a major HBV-population in only one mother. 11 of 14
core mutations were detected in known B- T-cell epitopes
(Table 1). The arginin-rich region (aa 155–171) that is
important for DNA binding was highly conserved in all 5
cases. Furthermore, the cystein residues in the pre-C/ C
gene (aa 23 of pre-C and aa 48, 61, 107, 183 of C gene),
which are important for secretion and antigenicity of the
core antigen were also conserved.

In the pre-S /S gene 13 and 5 amino acid changes were
observed. The HBV population of patient 3 was defective
in pre-S2 protein expression due to a mutation in the preS2 start codon. One (aa 131) of five amino acid substitutions in the S gene was located within the major antigenic
determinant, which is the target of neutralizing anti-HBs
antibodies.
In the X gene 17 amino acid changes were identified, with
a cluster of exchanges between codons 127–131 (Figure
3).

The P gene had a total of 56 amino acid changes including
13 in the terminal protein (TP), 20 in the spacer domain
(SP), 14 in the polymerase-reverse transcriptase domain
(Pol RT) and 2 in the ribonuclease H (RnaseH).

Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate, whether specific
HBV variants emerge after perinatal transmission and
whether these variants may be associated with fulminant
hepatitis.
Due to methodological reasons sequence analyses of the
entire HBV genome were performed by direct sequencing.
The disadvantage of this method is that viral quasispecies
harboured in very small amounts may escape the detection. For this reason this method is not suitable to perform phylogenetic studies or to precisely follow the
selective pressure occurring on those quasispecies during
the course of fulminant hepatitis. On the other hand
cloning studies regarding the complete HBV genome
would have not been feasable in this setting.
Numerous nucleotide and amino acid substitutions at
conserved segments were present in all of the four open
reading frames (Figure 2). Interestingly all HBV genomes
belonged to genotype D. This is in accordance with Li et
al. [10], who demonstrated a prevalence of genotype D in
HBeAg negative patients.
Since the core antigen has been postulated as target of cell
mediated and humoral immunity, it is tempting to speculate, that core mutations contribute to a more severe
course of the disease [12-15]. The precore stop codon
1896-A was present in all infants but only in 3 mothers.
Nucleotide 1899-A could be observed in 4 infants but
only in 2 mothers as a subpopulation. These nucleotide
changes had previously been attributed to fulminant hepatitis B in adults [3,16,17]. However, wild type (HBeAg
positive) virus has also been implicated in FH [18,19] and
our study shows that HBeAg-negative virus strains were
already present in 3 chronic carriers. Thus, it remains
unclear if mutations 1896 and 1899 play a major role in
infants with FHB although it is conceivable that the de
novo infection of the new host with HBeAg defective variants contributes to the development of fulminant hepatitis [17,20-22].
Interestingly, 11 out of 12 mutations in the core protein
resulted in changes of known B or T-cell epitopes (Table
1) affecting the immune response of the host [12]. The frequency of these mutations varied from 0 to 8 in the
mother child pairs. This is in contrast to a previous study
of a mother-child pair, in which none of the observed
mutations was located in immunodominant epitopes [7].
A changed core protein due to a 6 aa prolongation in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/4/11

dominant virus population of mothers M1 and M4
changed back to the wild type in the infants (Figure 3).
Additionally the cysteine residues at positions 61 and 183,
which are important for dimerization and particle assembly [23] were conserved in all cases. The amino acid
changes in CTL epitopes have been associated with liver
damage and it has been shown that frequent mutations
occur during active or fulminant hepatitis [12,15,24]. It is
conceivable that mutations in this region could induce a
more intense reaction of CTL, followed by hepatocellular
damage and severe hepatitis. In two mother child pairs
(M3-3, M5-5) 3 changes could be observed in these
epitopes (Table 1). Considering the different results of the
five studied mother child pairs it remains speculative, if
changes in B- T-cell epitopes play a significant role in FHB.
The analysis of the 5 regulatory elements, which might
change viral pathogenicity due to an altered protein
expression and virus replication revealed nucleotide substitutions clustering in all five cis acting elements (Figure
2). These mutations were of particular relevance, because
it has been demonstrated that intracellular accumulation
of HBV-proteins may have a direct cytotoxic effect [2527].
In the ENH II-CP the nucleotide exchanges at positions
1762/ 1764 of the Basic Core Promotor (BCP) have been
associated with FHB [1,4,6,28]. Nucleotide changes
between mothers and infants were observed in 3 (1762)
and 2 (1764) cases. These mutations have been shown to
affect viral antigen expression and replication capacity
[29,30]. Since a reduced HBeAg production may enhance
viral replication [31-33] and modulate the immune
response of the patient [34] it might contribute to the
pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis. However, the role of
these mutations according to in vitro experiments is currently unclear [30,35,36].
While only few mutations were detected in the SP I region,
we frequently found mutations in the other cis acting regulatory elements, clustering in ENH I XP, the stem loop
structure of the encapsidation signal ε and SP II. In these
regions a number of binding sites of several trancription
factors are located, which are important for viral gene
expression. Point mutations may alter the binding of transcription factors, enhance viral replication and influence
protein synthesis. Mutations in the CCAAT-box of the SP
II have been shown to promote expression of the large Sprotein [37,38]. It has been shown in vitro by Xu et al.
[27], that an increased expression and retention of the
large surface protein may be cytopathic for cells [26].
The mutations observed in the S-Gene were distributed
over the entire gene (preS1, preS2 and S) without hot
spots. In only one infant a point mutation in the preS2

start codon prevents the production of the preS2 protein.
Pre-S2 defective strains are rare in HBeAg positive hepatitis but emerge during seroconversion to anti-HBe [39,40].
An association with fulminant hepatitis has previously
been shown and further supports the hypothesis that
strains of the anti-HBe positive phase of infection preferentially induce fulminant hepatitis [5,7,41].

tional analysis of the virus strains and the individual
immune system of the host is required.

Only few mutations were observed in the S protein and
only one aa-substitution was located in the immunodominant a-determinant. Base pair exchanges in this region
seem to be uncommon in fulminant hepatitis [41].

49 amino acid substitutions were found in the polymerase
gene, especially in the 5' terminal binding protein and the
DNA polymerase-reverse transcriptase domains, which is
in accordance with published data from the fulminant
HBV strains HT and FH [4,6]. According to Asahina et al.
[42] these mutations were rarely observed in patients with
chronic hepatitis B. The binding of DNA polymerasereverse transcriptase to the encapsidation signal ε is
important for packaging of pregenomic RNA and the synthesis of viral DNA [43]. Therefore, the polymerase gene is
thought to play a critical role in viral replication.

Enh-CP -enhancer core promotor

In summary we could demonstrate that many mutations
emerged throughout the HBV genome of the dominant
HBV-population in the infants compared to their mothers. Many of the mutations occurred in regulatory and
immunodominant elements. Although HBV is not
thought to be cytopathic, it is conceivable that enhanced
viral replication and altered protein expression with different immunodominant epitopes may contribute to a
more severe form of liver disease [25,26]. Although the
mother's and infant's virus pools differed significantly, it
is still unclear if all these variants might have evolved de
novo or if they have already been present as a minor subpopulation in the mother. The viral strains which have
been analyzed at the state of fulminant liver disease were
not obligatory those which had been present at the time
of perinatal infection. Due to the nature of the natural
course of unknown vertical transmission HBV strains at
an earlier phase were not available. However, either possibility implies that neonatal FHB is associated with the
selection of variant genomes.

Conclusions
In our study we showed that after vertical HBV infection
many mutations emerged throughout the HBV genome of
the dominant HBV-population in the infants compared to
their mothers, quite frequently occurring in regulatory
and immunodominant elements. The results suggest that
the selection of specific virus variants might be one factor
in FHB of newborns, although further structural and func-
