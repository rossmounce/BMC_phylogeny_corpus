Abstract
Background: Formins are multidomain proteins defined by a conserved FH2 (formin homology
2) domain with actin nucleation activity preceded by a proline-rich FH1 (formin homology 1)
domain. Formins act as profilin-modulated processive actin nucleators conserved throughout a
wide range of eukaryotes.
Results: We present a detailed sequence analysis of the 10 formins (ForA to J) identified in the
genome of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. With the exception of ForI and ForC all
other formins conform to the domain structure GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2-DAD, where DAD is the
Diaphanous autoinhibition domain and GBD/FH3 is the Rho GTPase-binding domain/formin
homology 3 domain that we propose to represent a single domain. ForC lacks a FH1 domain, ForI
lacks recognizable GBD/FH3 and DAD domains and ForA, E and J have additional unique domains.
To establish the relationship between formins of Dictyostelium and other organisms we constructed
a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of FH2 domains. Real-time PCR was used to study the
expression pattern of formin genes. Expression of forC, D, I and J increased during transition to
multi-cellular stages, while the rest of genes displayed less marked developmental variations. During
sexual development, expression of forH and forI displayed a significant increase in fusion competent
cells.
Conclusion: Our analysis allows some preliminary insight into the functionality of Dictyostelium
formins: all isoforms might display actin nucleation activity and, with the exception of ForI, might
also be susceptible to autoinhibition and to regulation by Rho GTPases. The architecture GBD/
FH3-FH1-FH2-DAD appears common to almost all Dictyostelium, fungal and metazoan formins, for
which we propose the denomination of conventional formins, and implies a common regulatory
mechanism.

Background
Eukaryotic cells rely on de novo nucleation mechanisms
to generate actin filaments in order to elicit spatial and
temporal remodeling of their actin cytoskeleton. Besides
the Arp2/3 complex, nucleation activity has been recently
demonstrated also for formins (reviewed in [1]). Formins
are multidomain proteins conserved from plants to fungi
and vertebrates. Their name originates from the mouse
limb deformity gene. Mice with mutant alleles fail to form
proper limbs and kidneys [2]. Subsequently, homologues
were identified in Drosophila (Diaphanous) [3] and yeast
(Bni1p and Cdc12p) [4,5]. Due to their pivotal role in the
organization of the actin cytoskeleton formins are
involved in processes as diverse as formation of filopodia,
microspikes and lamellipodia, establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, vesicular trafficking, formation of
adherens junctions, cytokinesis, embryonic development
and signaling to the nucleus (reviewed in [6]).
The FH2 (formin homology 2) domain is the defining feature of all formins. It is very well conserved and is almost
invariably preceded by a proline-rich region, the FH1
(formin homology 1) domain [6,7]. In vitro, the FH2
domain competes with barbed-end capping proteins and
is necessary and sufficient to nucleate actin polymerization, but the FH1 domain, which interacts with profilinactin, funnels actin to the nucleation vicinity and confers
full activity to the molecule [1]. Contrary to the Arp2/3
complex, which nucleates a new filament on the side of a
preexisting filament, remains attached to the pointed end
of the new filament and generates branched networks [8],
the FH2 domain binds and stays associated to the barbed
end, giving rise to unbranched filaments [9-11]. The crystal structure of the FH2 domain of two formins, Bni1p
and mDia1, has been recently solved. Its fold is almost
entirely α-helical and forms a ring-shaped flexible but stable dimer that caps the barbed end and allows processive
elongation of the actin filament [12,13]. The FH1 domain
is also a binding site for diverse SH3-domain containing
proteins like Src-like non-receptor tyrosine kinases, WISH
(WASP-interacting SH3 protein) and IRSp53 (insulin
receptor substrate) in mammals, and Hof1p in yeast [6].
In most fungal and metazoan formins the FH1-FH2 core
is accompanied by a less well conserved N-terminal FH3
(formin homology 3) domain involved in targeting [14].
In plants targeting might be mediated by membrane insertion signals or PTEN (phosphatase and tensin)-related
domains [15,16]. Some formins, the so called Diaphanous-related formins, are able to interact with activated
Rho GTPases through a poorly defined N-terminal Rho
GTPase binding domain (GBD) that overlaps with the
FH3 domain [6,7]. This binding releases the intramolecular inhibitory interaction between the GBD and a C-termi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/28

nal Diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) and
renders the protein active [10,17].
The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is an attractive
model organism to investigate the components of the
actin cytoskeleton and the signaling pathways involved in
its regulation [18,19]. Dictyostelium amoebae are
equipped with a complex actin cytoskeleton that endows
the cells with motile behavior comparable to that of
human leukocytes. In fact, a genome-wide survey revealed
that the repertoire of cytoskeletal components of Dictyostelium is more similar to metazoa followed by fungi than
to plants (Eichinger, et al., submitted). In Dictyostelium,
nine formins have been previously identified but only
three of them have been characterized to some extent
[20]. Mutants lacking ForA, ForB or both showed no
detectable phenotype, whereas disruption of the gene
encoding ForC, which is expressed predominantly at late
developmental stages, led to a cell autonomous developmental defect with the formation of aberrant fruiting bodies, suggesting this formin mediates actin remodeling
during multicellular stages. In vivo experiments with GFP
fusions showed that the N-terminal region of ForC targets
the protein to places of active actin reorganization, like
macropinosomes, phagocytic cups and cell-to-cell contacts [20].
We have made use of the information released by the Dictyostelium sequencing projects in order to achieve a complete inventory of formin genes. A detailed sequence
analysis of the 10 formins identified revealed that, with
the exception of ForI and ForC, all other formins conform
to the domain structure GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2-DAD present
in almost all fungal and metazoan formins, for which we
propose the denomination of conventional formins. Our
sequence analysis also indicates that the GBD and FH3
domains constitute a single domain also found in two
Dictyostelium RasGEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors). The expression pattern of formin genes during asexual and sexual development was studied using real-time
PCR. Our analysis allows some preliminary insight into
the functionality of Dictyostelium formins: all isoforms
might display actin nucleation activity and, with the
exception of ForI, might also be susceptible to autoinhibition and regulation by Rho GTPases.

Results
Sequence analysis of Dictyostelium formin genes
In a previous publication 9 genes that potentially encode
proteins of the formin family were identified in Dictyostelium [20]. For some of the formins (ForA through D and
ForF) full length sequences were available, whereas for the
rest N- and C-terminal sequences were missing. For a complete analysis of this family in Dictyostelium we sought to
exploit the available databases in order to achieve a

complete inventory of formin genes in its entire length.
The sequences already reported by Kitayama et al. [20]
were used as queries for Blast searches of the Dictyostelium
genomic DNA database. This allowed assembly of complete genomic sequence for forA through forI. In order to
verify the predicted amino acid sequence for each formin,
Blast searches were performed against the Dictyostelium
EST database. In cases where no EST sequences were available, like forG and forI, introns were verified after RT-PCR.
Inspection of the EST sequences led to the identification
of one more formin gene, forJ, whose genomic sequence
was also retrieved and inspected. Recent completion of
the assembly of the Dictyostelium genome allowed us to
confirm our gene predictions and map each formin gene
to its corresponding chromosome locus (Eichinger et al.,
submitted). Formin genes are dispersed all over the six
chromosomes (each chromosome harbors at least one
formin gene), and in no case two or more genes are placed
adjacent to each other (Table 1).
With the exception of forE, all other formin genes are
interrupted by one or more introns, which are generally
placed in the 5' half of the sequence, upstream of the
region encoding the FH1 domain (Fig. 1, arrowheads).
Only in forC is an intron placed in the region encoding the
FH2 domain. ForC is also the only case where an intron
was identified upstream of the start codon. Dictyostelium
formin genes do not appear to undergo alternative splicing, at least within the coding region. This is in contrast to
metazoan and plant formins, where alternative splicing
gives rise to a large number of variants that frequently differ in their pattern of tissue distribution and interaction
with binding partners.
Only two intron positions are conserved among Dictyostelium formin genes (Figs. 1 and 4). Intron a is conserved in

forA, forB, forD and forH, whereas intron b is conserved in
forB and forH. The conserved FH3-FH1-FH2 core domain
composition (see below) along with these two intron
positions underscore the view that all Dictyostelium formin
genes might have arisen from a common ancestor gene.
After duplications and divergence from this ancestral
formin gene introns were acquired or lost and additional
domains and extensions were appended to some genes.
Domain structure of Dictyostelium formins: the FH2
domain
The domain structure and topology of all ten Dictyostelium
formins was determined by means of bioinformatics tools
and visual inspection. Although formins vary considerably in length (935 residues of ForI versus 2546 of ForJ),
with few exceptions they have in common a core of about
1100 residues that harbors a GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2-DAD
structure characteristic of most fungal and metazoan
formins (Fig. 1). To better appreciate the relationships
among the members of the Dictyostelium formin family
and to analyze the requirements for their function, we
have generated multiple alignments of the FH2-DAD
domains as well as the GBD/FH3 domain.

The FH2 domain is the best conserved domain of formins
(Fig. 2). In general, the FH2 domain is about 400 residues
long. Some Dictyostelium formins (ForC, D and I) have
one or more stretches of intervening repetitive sequences
of variable length rich in Arg, Gln or Ser. Such repetitive
sequences are characteristic of many Dictyostelium genes.
The crystal structure of the FH2 domain of two formins,
Bni1p and mDia1, has been recently solved [12,13]. We
will consider the FH2 domains of Dictyostelium formins in
the context of these two structures. The FH2 domain fold
is almost entirely α-helical. It is a stable dimer that forms
a closed parallelogram-shaped ring. The structure of this
domain can be subdivided into subdomains. At the N-ter-

minus a so-called lasso is connected to a globular knob
(helices α1 to α5 in red in Fig. 2) by a linker of variable
length. The knob is followed by a three helix bundle with
a coiled-coil structure (α6, α11 and α12 in blue). The Cterminal subdomain (helices α7 to α10 and α13 in green)
forms a so-called post. The lasso subdomain of one subunit encircles the post subdomain of the other subunit in a
dimer. The post also harbors the GNY/FMN sequence
motif that originally defined the FH2 domain (box at the
end of helix α7) [21]. Residues of the lasso/post interface
are highly conserved, particularly Trp1 and 2 (substituted
by Phe in ForB, E and F) that insert into hydrophobic
pockets in the post flanked by Gly residues 6 and 8 (Fig.
2).
All residues of the sequence motif GNY/FMN participate
in dimerization. This motif is also highly conserved in
almost all Dictyostelium formins (NY is substituted by SI in
ForI) but the important methionine residue (Met7) [12] is
present only in ForG and ForJ and is substituted by other
hydrophobic residues in the rest of the Dictyostelium form-

ins as well as in members of the FHOD (formin homology
domain containing protein) and plant class1 subfamilies.
Also very conserved are some residues probably involved
in binding to actin, like Ile3 (absolutely conserved) in the
N-terminal subdomain and Lys9 in the post region (substituted by Arg in ForB and ForH). Mutation of these residues in Bni1p to Ala and Asp, respectively, abolished actin
nucleation and barbed end capping activity of the FH2
domain [13], and replacement of Lys9 and two adjacent
Lys residues by Ala abolished alignment of microtubules
and bundling of F-actin induced by activated mDia1 [22].
Other conserved residues are Asp4 (or the conservative
substitution by Glu in most of the Dictyostelium formins)
and Arg5 (substituted by Lys in ForB and ForE). These residues were found mutated in temperature-sensitive yeast
mutants [23,24], and they probably participate in stabilization of the knob region [13].
In summary, all essential residues in the FH2 domain
revealed by structural and functional studies in metazoan
and fungal formins are conserved in Dictyostelium form-

ins, indicating that all ten formins might be functional
actin nucleators.
Dictyostelium formins in the context of other organisms
In order to establish the relationship between formins of
Dictyostelium and other organisms and to investigate
whether different species share subfamilies of formins, we
constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of
complete sets of sequences of FH2 domains from selected

organisms, including representatives of fungi, plants,
invertebrates and vertebrates. We retrieved sequences of
already characterized formins and additionally we made a
search of further available sequences through the SMART
server with the FH2 domain as query. Appart from the ten
sequences of Dictyostelium, we collected a total of 62
sequences, 21 from plants, 5 from yeasts, 6 from D. melanogaster, 6 from C. elegans and 14 from human. Taking
into account that some genes might not have been pre-

dicted accurately and that predicted proteins not supported by EST sequences were not considered for our
analysis, further metazoan formins, especially from
human, most probably went unidentified in our search.
The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3) supports the high degree of
conservation of the FH2 domain, as becomes evident
from the homogeneous branch length for most of the
sequences. Yeast formins and some C. elegans members
are more divergent. The phylogenetic analysis reveals clustering of most formins into well defined classes. Yeast
formins form a separate class whereas plant formins significantly group into any of two classes. Metazoan formins do not constitute a single cluster, rather they distribute
into a number of subfamilies. The FHOD, Diaphanous
and FMNL (formin in leukocytes) subfamilies have
representatives in human, D. melanogaster and C. elegans.
The Cappuccino/Formin and DAAM (Dishevelled-asssociated activator of morphogenesis) subfamilies, as well as
a novel subfamily, is present in human and D. melanogaster, but seems to be absent in C. elegans. Delphilin
constitutes a subfamily with a unique member present
only in human. Finally, C. elegans has some additional
divergent formins apparently unique to this organism.
On average, Dictyostelium formins are 45.5% similar
(23.8% identical) to each other, with ForC being only
slightly more divergent (40.0%/20.4% similarity/identity
to the rest of Dictyostelium formins). A comparable degree
of similarity (identity) was found to members of several
subfamilies of metazoan formins, and ranged between
40% (20%) and 48% (24%). Similarity (identity) to plant
and yeast formins was lower: 38% (19%) and 36% (17%)
respectively. Dictyostelium ForC and ForG cluster together
with the Cappuccino/Formin group (75% bootstraps),
whereas ForI very weakly clusters with the FHOD subfamily (53% bootstraps). However, taking into account
that the FH2 domain is highly conserved, the position of
these three Dictyostelium formins in the tree does not necessarily mean functional relationship with the mammalian counterpart, because other domains are probably
responsible for diversity of localization and function.
Bootstrapping does not support a significant clustering of
the rest of the Dictyostelium formins, and only few members cluster together with a reasonably high number of
bootstraps (ForE, D, A and F, 51% bootstraps).
Domain structure of Dictyostelium formins: FH1, FH3
and other domains
The FH1 domain is a proline-rich region situated immediately upstream of the FH2 domain. It is present in almost
all known formins, including that of Dictyostelium, with
the notable exception of ForC. The length of the FH1
domains is very variable among formins (10 to >500
amino acids). It constitutes a binding site for the actin

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/28

monomer binding protein profilin, as well as for SH3 and
WW domain containing signaling proteins [25,26].
Binding to profilin is well established for a large number
of formin proteins and might take place through type 1
proline-rich motifs with the sequence XPPPPP, where X is
usually Gly, Leu, Ile or Ser. Dictyostelium formis have a variable number of these motifs, between 1 in ForD and 8 in
ForA (Fig. 1). In most cases Gly occupies the X position. In
general the motifs are separated by a short stretch of up to
five residues, two or more of them usually glycines. In
some formins, like ForA and ForF, the proline-rich motifs
might be the product of internal duplications. ForE has
one additional short proline-rich region located at the Nterminus of the protein.
The FH3 domain was initially identified and characterized
in the yeast formin Fus1p as a region consisting of three
blocks of similarity in the same relative order in several
formins [14]. It is less well conserved than the FH2
domain and is thought to be important for determining
the intracellular localization of formins. Two domains of
the Pfam database are recognized in this region that overlap with the FH3 domain of Petersen and co-workers [14],
the Diaphanous GTPase-binding domain (PF06371) and
the Diaphanous FH3 domain (PF06367). Automatic
domain analysis identified a GBD and a FH3 domain in
ForA, B, D, E, F and H. In ForC and ForJ a GBD was identified with confidence values slightly below the default
threshold of the SMART tool. This was also the case for a
FH3 domain in ForG and ForJ. A multiple alignment of
the N-terminus of Dictyostelium formins with metazoan
and fungal homologues revealed a homology region of
approximately 380 residues in all Dictyostelium formins
with the exception of ForI (Figs. 1 and 4). We will consider
this region as a single GBD/FH3 domain (see discussion).
In ForJ this domain is considerably longer due to stretches
of intervening repetitive sequences rich in Arg and Ser
residues. On average the GBD/FH3 domain of Dictyostelium formins displays 39% similarity to that of human
DRF3 taken as reference for figure 4. Interestingly, inspection of the Dictyostelium genome for proteins with a GBD
as defined by Pfam PF06371 yielded two genes encoding
RasGEF proteins of identical domain composition, RasGEF-L and RasGEF-V. Both proteins harbor a complete
GBD/FH3 domain that is 35% similar to that of human
DRF3 and constitute the first case where this domain is
observed outside of a formin.
We constructed a phylogenetic tree based on a multiple
alignment of the GBD/FH3 domain of Dictyostelium formins (except ForI), RasGEFs, fungal formins and members
of the Diaphanous, DAAM, FMNL and FHOD subfamilies
(Fig. 5). With few exceptions automatic domain analysis
identified GBD and FH3 domains in the metazoan and
fungal formins. For example, a weak GBD was identified

reliably identified in multiple alignments. We could not
identify a GBD/FH3 domain in members of the cappucino/formin subfamily. DmAE003560 has a FH3 domain

and a short piece of a GBD but, interestingly, the human

by intervening stretches of variable length in the different

Bootstrap analysis did not support clustering of fungal or
Dictyostelium sequences into distinct classes, but interestingly, ForC and ForG significantly clustered with the

The DAD immediately follows the FH2 domain and is
required for autoinhibition by intramolecular interaction
with the N-terminus of formins [21]. Inspection of the
multiple alignment of the C-terminus of Dictyostelium
formins revealed a DAD in all members with the exception of ForI (Figs. 1 and 2). This formin ends abruptly at
the last α-helix of the FH2 domain. In all cases the DAD
was placed in the vicinity of and no more than approximately 60 residues beyond the FH2 domain. The DAD is
composed of two sections, a core leucine-rich sequence
and a short stretch of basic residues. Both elements are
present in the DAD of most Dictyostelium formins, in particular three hydrophobic residues shown to be required
for activity in mouse Dia2 (indicated by triangles in Fig. 2)
[17]. In ForJ, where these residues are substituted by polar
or charged aminoacids, the DAD might not be functional.
Like metazoan and fungal formins, most Dictyostelium
formins have predicted coiled-coil regions adjacent to the
FH3 domain that could act as protein-protein interfaces
for yet unidentified ligands (Fig. 1). For example, in mammalian formin1 this region constitutes the binding site of
α-catenin and is involved in recruitment of formin1 to
nascent adherens junctions [27] and in Bni1p the coiled
coil region harbors the binding site for Spa2, a protein
involved in recruitment of Bni1p to the bud cortex [28]. A
few Dictyostelium formins have additional predicted coiled
coil regions upstream of the FH3 domain (ForE and ForI)
or downstream of the FH2 domain (ForD and ForJ) that
might constitute potential protein interaction sites with
regulatory or targeting functions.
Three Dictyostelium formins have additional recognizable
domains at their N-terminus (Fig. 1). ForA has a C2 (protein kinase C conserved region 2) domain. This domain,
present in phospholipases, protein kinases C, synaptotagmins and diverse other proteins, is thought to be involved
in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding [29]. ForE
has a C1 (protein kinase C conserved region 1) domain, a
cysteine-rich region involved in zinc-dependent binding
to diacylglycerol [30]. Finally, ForJ has a FHA (forkheadassociated) domain, a phospho-specific protein-protein
interaction motif found in nuclear proteins [31]. None of
these domains are found in formins from other organisms. ForJ is the only Dictyostelium formin with a long Cterminal extension. Similar extensions, although of unrelated sequence, can be observed in formins from other
organisms, like yeast Cdc12 and For3, C. elegans Cyk-1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/28

and AF106580, D. melanogaster AE003560 and human
KIAA1727.
Expression analysis
Dictyostelium cells can propagate following either an asexual or a sexual life cycle. Characteristic of the asexual life
cycle is the transition from single cell amoebae to a multicellular fruiting body consisting of at least two differentiated cell types. In the sexual life cycle some amoebae
become sexually mature under dark and submerged conditions, fuse and form macrocysts. Either life cycle
involves coordinated transcription of certain sets of genes.
We have used quantitative real-time PCR to study the
expression of the formin genes during sexual and asexual
development (Fig. 6).

The expression patterns observed during asexual development can be classified into two major groups. Expression
of forC, D, I and J displayed an increase during transition
to multi-cellular stages, and except for forI, levels
remained constantly high throughout the rest of development. The rest of genes displayed less marked developmental variations, and expression was either kept at
constant levels (forG and H) or gradually increased (forF)
or decreased (forA, B and E) after the onset of
development.
When expression was analyzed during sexual development only forH and forI displayed a significant increase of
about 3-fold in fusion competent cells compared to
fusion incompetent cells. Cells cultured in light
submerged conditions have a reduced sexual fusion
competency [32,33]. In parallel with this, forH and forI
were enriched in fusion competent compared to light submerged cells, indicating that this enrichment is related to
the acquisition of the fusion competence rather than to
the submerged condition that was included to induce the
fusion competence.

Discussion
We have performed a detailed sequence and expression
analysis of the formin family of Dictyostelium, which in
this organism comprises 10 genes. A comparison of the
domain composition of formins from diverse phyla
allows their grouping into four major classes (Fig. 7). In
general, Dictyostelium formins can be grouped within the
class of what we designate conventional formins (see
below), which includes all fungal and almost all metazoan formins. This is in agreement with a genome wide
analysis that places Dictyostelium closer to fungi and metazoa than to plants (Eichinger et al., submitted).
With very few exceptions all formins have in common a
FH2 domain immediately preceded by a FH1 domain.
The FH1-FH2 combination constitutes the minimal core

Figure 7
Classification of formins according to structural and functional elements
Classification of formins according to structural and functional elements. Most formins of metazoans as well as
formins of Dictyostelium and fungi can be classified as conventional formins, with a GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2-DAD structure,
although in particular members or alternatively spliced variants a domain (but never the FH2) might be absent. Plant formins
can be grouped into one of two classes. Delphilin is an unconventional formin lacking GBD/FH3 and DAD only found in metazoa. Formins are not drawn to scale. SP, signal peptide. TM, transmembrane region.

that is fully functional in terms of actin nucleation and
elongation activity (reviewed in [1]). This FH1-FH2 core is
very ancient, and its remarkable degree of conservation
points at an essential role within the cell. The diverse
formin classes differ in their N-terminal regions, which
have regulatory and targeting roles. Plant formins characteristically lack GBD/FH3 and DAD domains and there is
no evidence for an interaction with Rop GTPases. In
plants the N-terminus is unrelated to that of other organisms. Class 1 plant formins are integral membrane proteins by virtue of a signal peptide or membrane anchor
followed by a transmembrane domain, whereas some
class 2 plant formins have a PTEN-related domain
[15,16]. Conventional formins have characteristically a
GBD/FH3 domain at the N-terminus. Together with the
DAD region at the very C-terminus this domain confers in
most cases regulatable autoinhibition through binding of
activated Rho GTPases. Finally, Delphilin is a variation
only present in vertebrates. Instead of a GBD/FH3 domain
it has a PDZ domain that interacts with a glutamate receptor, and it has been proposed that receptor binding causes
activation of this formin [6,34].
The GBD/FH3 domain: a targeting and regulation domain
Our sequence analysis defines a putative GBD/FH3
domain in most Dictyostelium as well as fungal and

metazoan formins. The two domains identified in the
Pfam database at the N-terminus of several formins, the
Diaphanous GTPase-binding domain and the Diaphanous FH3 domain, overlap with the FH3 domain proposed initially by Petersen et al. [14]. This distinction is
apparently based on reports on binding of activated Rho
GTPases, however the boundaries of each domain have
not been defined experimentally. We propose that these
two regions constitute a single domain for two reasons.
First, when present, these two domains as defined in the
Pfam database invariably appear adjacent to each other
and are separated by only very few residues. Some cases of
sequences where only a FH3 domain is present correspond to alternatively spliced variants of proteins that in
their full length possess GBD and FH3 domains. This is
the case for example of HsDRF3 [35]. Second, the GBD/
FH3 domain appears as a single block in two formin-unrelated proteins of Dictyostelium, indicating that the domain
was shuffled as a unit during remodeling of the genome
(Fig. 4).
The role of the GBD/FH3 domain appears to be twofold.
On one hand the N-terminal region of formins is involved
in subcellular localization through interaction with
diverse targets. For instance, the N-terminus of yeast Fus1 is responsible for recruitment to the projection tip dur-

Page 12 of 16

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:28

ing conjugation [14]. In mouse Dia3 the analogous region
is required for localization at mitotic spindles [36]. In Dictyostelium an N-terminal fragment that encompasses most
of the GBD/FH3 domain of ForC is sufficient for targeting
to crowns and macropinosomes [20]. The N-terminus
appears thus as a major determinant of localization and
therefore function of formins. The low degree of sequence
conservation of this region might correlate with the diversity of binding partners, not only Rho GTPases, and subcellular localization patterns described. On the other
hand the GBD/FH3 domain is involved in regulation of
activation by releasing of an intramolecular interaction
between the DAD and the N-terminus, as initially proposed by Watanabe et al. [21]. As already mentioned, the
boundaries of the GBD region remain poorly defined and
while a CRIB-like (Cdc and Rac interactive binding)
region has been described in mammalian DRF [37], such
motif cannot be identified in any other formin, whether
regulated by Rho GTPases or not.
Although initially not appreciated [6], with very few
exceptions a GBD/FH3, a DAD or both can be identified
in almost all conventional formins, including all fungal
formins, FMNL, FHOD and DAAM ([11,14,38-40] and
Figs. 4 and 5). Although a FH3 domain was reported also
in cappuccino and in one alternatively splice variant of
mouse formin 1 (formin1 IV) [14], we were not able to
identify a GBD/FH3 domain in these proteins. We cannot
exclude that a strongly divergent GBD/FH3 be present in
members of this subfamily. In fact, cappuccino interacts
with activated RhoA [41], and the N and C-terminal segments of formin1 (IV) interact with each other [27], two
features characteristic of conventinal formins.
The designation Diaphanous-related formin has been
applied to those formins that interact with activated Rho
GTPases [7]. However, the number of formins shown to
posses this property is increasing, and includes to date at
least one member of each family of conventional formins
as well as Dictyostelium formins (our unpublished data).
We therefore propose the use of the name conventional
formins for those subfamilies with the general structure
GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2, although in particular members or
in alternatively spliced variants a domain (but never the
FH2) might be absent, indicating whether the protein is
Rho-regulated where documented experimentally. The
name Diaphanous-related formin should be restricted to
the metazoan members of the Diaphanous subfamily, like
human DRF1 to 3.
Functionality and roles of Dictyostelium formins
Functional data on Dictyostelium formins is scarce. Only
three isoforms, formins A, B and C have been characterized to some extent. Mutants lacking ForA, ForB or both
showed no detectable phenotype, whereas deletion of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/28

forC led to formation of aberrant fruiting bodies with
short stalks and unlifted sori, suggesting this formin mediates actin remodeling during multicellular stages [20].
Dictyostelium formins are expected to be functional
according to their highly conserved FH1-FH2 structure;
therefore a certain degree of functional redundancy is
expected. However, diversity might arise through specific
targeting and activation by Rho GTPases conferred by the
GBD/FH3 domain, through interaction of specific SH3domain containing proteins with the FH1 domain and by
virtue of unique additional domains. These issues need to
be addressed experimentally in the future.
ForC and ForI might be exceptions in terms of regulation.
ForC lacks a FH1 domain and consequently does not bind
to profilins [20]. Although the FH2 domain is necessary
and sufficient for nucleation, FH2-induced nucleation is
very slow and requires binding of profilin to the FH1
domain for full functionality [9-11]. While other scenarios are possible, in the case of ForC fueling of the actin
polymerization process by profilin-actin might be furnished by heterodimerization with another formin possesing an FH1 domain. Regarding ForI, that lacks GBD/
FH3 and DAD domains, it is not clear how this isoform
could be regulated.
Three Dictyostelium formins have domains at their N-termini that are not found in other formins and might confer
unique additional functions or ways of regulation or
targeting. The C2 and C1 domains of ForA and ForE,
respectively, might regulate activation or targeting of the
molecule through interaction with specific lipids [29,30],
while the FHA domain of ForJ might be involved in interactions with components of the cell nucleus [31]. In general, well defined domains others than the ones
characteristic of formins are very rare. Most plant class 1
formins carry transmembrane domains and proline-rich
regions in their N-termini that together might mediate
anchorage of actin nucleation sites to the cell wall across
the plasma membrane [15,16] and the PTEN-related
domain of some class 2 plant formins might also be
involved in membrane anchoring [16]. Apart from Delphilin (see above) we have identified only one more case
of additional domains in metazoan formins, CeZ22171.
This protein, that also lacks a FH1 domain, has a zinc finger domain and might be involved in nucleic acid interactions. The C-terminal extensions found in ForJ and several
other fungal and metazoan formins also probably harbor
recognition sites for additional binding partners that
remain to be identified.
Functional diversity might also be related to different patterns of local and temporal gene expression. Our gene
expression analyses also suggest specific roles during asexual and sexual development. Four genes in particular,

Page 13 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:28

forC, D, I and J, displayed an increase in expression during
transition to multi-cellular stages. During this phase cells
acquire aggregation competence in parallel with maturation of signaling pathways involved in remodeling of the
cytoskeleton. At least for forC gene expression data correlate with a developmental role, as mentioned above [20].
ForH and ForI might play specific roles during sexual
development, based alone on their patterns of gene
expression. Interestingly, expression of rac1b and racF2
was found increased during the analysis of a gameteenriched cDNA library [33]. It is therefore conceivable
that one or more formins, irrespective of their expression
pattern, play roles during sexual development upon activation by those GTPases.

Conclusion
The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum expresses 10
formins that with few exceptions conform to the domain
structure GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2-DAD. This arhitecture and
the high degree of conservation of the FH2 domain allow
some preliminary conclusions about the functionality of
Dictyostelium formins: all isoforms may display actin
nucleation activity and, with the exception of ForI, may
also be susceptible to autoinhibition and to regulation by
Rho GTPases. Although functional redundancy may be
expected to occur to some extent among Dictyostelium
formins, specific roles may be conferred by the GBD/FH3
domain, which is less well conserved than the FH2
domain, and by specific patterns of gene expression during asexual and sexual development.
We propose four major classes of formins based on a comparison of the domain composition of proteins from
diverse phyla. Dictyostelium, fungal and most metazoan
formins can be grouped within the class of what we designate conventional formins, characterized by the structure
GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2-DAD. The GBD and FH3 domains,
whose boundaries had not been defined previously, probably constitute a single domain. The architecture shared
by conventional formins implies a common regulatory
mechanism
based
on
autoinhibition
through
intramoleculr interaction of the GBD/FH3 and the DAD
domains and activation through release of this interaction
upon binding of Rho GTPases. Formins of the other
classes (plant formins and Delphilin) lack GBD/FH3 and
DAD domains and must therefore have other mechanisms of activation.
Note. While our manuscript was under review a phylogenetic analysis of the FH2 domain by H. N Higgs and K. J.
Peterson has been published. These authors used a larger
set of FH2 domains that includes only three formins from
Dictyostelium. The topology of the phylogenetic tree
described in that article and that of our tree are essentially
coincident, and all seven metazoan groups identified by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/28

their authors can be found in our tree, with the novel
subfamily
INV
comprising
our
HsKIAA1727,
DmAE003560 and CeAF106580 sequences. Higgs and
Peterson, however, do not recognize the GBD/FH3 region
as a domain present in a larger number of formin
subfamilies.

Methods
Sequence analysis
The amino acid or DNA sequences of Dictyostelium formins were used as query for BLAST searches [42] of the Dictyostelium genome project databases at The Welcome Trust
Sanger Institute, Baylor College of Medicine, The University of Cologne and the Department of Genome Analysis
of the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology in Jena.
Nearly all of this data was generated at the
aforementioned institutes with a small part of it produced
at the Institute Pasteur. After assembly of the genome further analyses were performed through the Dictybase
server [43]. BLAST searches against EST sequences were
performed at NCBI [44]. Accession numbers for Dictyostelium formins can be found in Table 1.

were obtained from Cvrčková et al. [16]. Dictyostelium RasGEF-L and RasGEF-V can be accessed at Dictybase [43]
under DDB0217789 and DDB0216586, respectively.
Protein sequences were aligned using the ClustalX [45]
program with a BLOSUM62 matrix and default settings,
followed by manual edition with the Bioedit program
[46]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithms of the ClustalX program with correction for multiple substitutions; positions with gaps
were not excluded. Construction of trees was done with
TreeView [47]. Bootstrap analysis (1000 bootstraps) was
applied to provide confidence levels for the tree topology.
The domain analysis was done using the SMART tool [48]
and InterProScan [49]. FH1 domains were identified by
visual inspection. GBD/FH3 and DAD domains were
identified in part by inspection of multiple alignments.

Cell culture
D. discoideum AX2 strain was grown at 21°C in shaking
suspension in axenic HL5 medium [50]. AX2 cells were
also cultured for sexual gametes in Bonner's salt solution
(BSS) as described [33]. In brief, cells were cultured for 15
hours in a dense suspension of K. aerogenes in BSS either
in the darkness or in the light. Cells cultured for 15 hours
in the dark become fusion-competent cells. However, cells
cultured for 15 hours in the light condition exhibit
reduced fusion competency, and are designated light
submerged cells. Cells on SM agar plates [50] are fusion
incompetent cells.
Isolation of total RNA and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was purified from both asexually and sexually
developing cells with the TRIZOL reagent (GIBCO BRL,
USA). Asexually developing cells on phosphate agar plates
[50] were collected every 4 hours. Total RNA was treated
with RNase-free DNase to remove contaminating
genomic DNA, and then used to synthesize the first strand
cDNA using SuperscriptII (Invitrogen, USA). For each
time point cDNA was synthesized using two independently isolated mRNA samples. Specific primer sets for each
formin gene were designed. To equalize the concentrations of template cDNAs, amplification was conducted
using the control primer set for the Ig7 gene, which is
expressed constitutively. Quantitative real-time PCR was
performed with an ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
amplifications were carried out using Ex Taq R-PCR Version (Takara Bio, JAPAN) and SYBR Green I. Each sample
had 2 replicates containing 1-, 4-, or 16-fold diluted
cDNA.
Miscellaneous methods
For RT-PCR, first strand cDNA synthesis was performed
with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega Corporation,
Madison, WI) on poly A+ mRNA purified with the Oligotex system (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) from total
RNA. PCR fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy
vector system (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) and
sequenced. DNA sequencing was done at the service laboratory of the Center for Molecular Medicine, Cologne,
using an automated sequencer (ABI 377 PRISM, Perkin
Elmer, Norwalk, CO).
