The complete mitochondrial genome of the citrus
red mite Panonychus citri (Acari: Tetranychidae):
high genome rearrangement and extremely
truncated tRNAs
Ming-Long Yuan, Dan-Dan Wei, Bao-Jun Wang, Wei Dou, Jin-Jun Wang*

Abstract
Background: The family Tetranychidae (Chelicerata: Acari) includes ~1200 species, many of which are of
agronomic importance. To date, mitochondrial genomes of only two Tetranychidae species have been sequenced,
and it has been found that these two mitochondrial genomes are characterized by many unusual features in
genome organization and structure such as gene order and nucleotide frequency. The scarcity of available
sequence data has greatly impeded evolutionary studies in Acari (mites and ticks). Information on Tetranychidae
mitochondrial genomes is quite important for phylogenetic evaluation and population genetics, as well as the
molecular evolution of functional genes such as acaricide-resistance genes. In this study, we sequenced the
complete mitochondrial genome of Panonychus citri (Family Tetranychidae), a worldwide citrus pest, and provide a
comparison to other Acari.
Results: The mitochondrial genome of P. citri is a typical circular molecule of 13,077 bp, and contains the
complete set of 37 genes that are usually found in metazoans. This is the smallest mitochondrial genome within all
sequenced Acari and other Chelicerata, primarily due to the significant size reduction of protein coding genes
(PCGs), a large rRNA gene, and the A + T-rich region. The mitochondrial gene order for P. citri is the same as those
for P. ulmi and Tetranychus urticae, but distinctly different from other Acari by a series of gene translocations and/
or inversions. The majority of the P. citri mitochondrial genome has a high A + T content (85.28%), which is also
reflected by AT-rich codons being used more frequently, but exhibits a positive GC-skew (0.03). The Acari
mitochondrial nad1 exhibits a faster amino acid substitution rate than other genes, and the variation of nucleotide
substitution patterns of PCGs is significantly correlated with the G + C content. Most tRNA genes of P. citri are
extremely truncated and atypical (44-65, 54.1 ± 4.1 bp), lacking either the T- or D-arm, as found in P. ulmi,
T. urticae, and other Acariform mites.
Conclusions: The P. citri mitochondrial gene order is markedly different from those of other chelicerates, but
is conserved within the family Tetranychidae indicating that high rearrangements have occurred after
Tetranychidae diverged from other Acari. Comparative analyses suggest that the genome size, gene order,
gene content, codon usage, and base composition are strongly variable among Acari mitochondrial genomes.
While extremely small and unusual tRNA genes seem to be common for Acariform mites, further experimental
evidence is needed.

Background
The family Tetranychidae (spider mites) (Chelicerata:
Acari) includes ~1200 species, many of which are of
agronomic importance [1], such as Tetranychus urticae,
Panonychus citri, and P. ulmi; the former is a worldwide
pest of many plant species including several economically important agricultural crops, while the latter two
are important fruit plant (e.g., apple and citrus) pests.
Spider mites are often difficult to manage because of
their ability to rapidly develop resistance to various acaricides [2]. It has been reported that the resistance of
T. urticae to the acaricide bifenazate is highly correlated
with the remarkable mutations in the mitochondrial
encoded cytochrome b (cob) [3]. In addition, several
acaricides, such as acequinocyl, fluacrypyrim [4], and
METI-acaricides (mitochondrial electron transfer inhibitors, e.g., fenpyroximate and pyridaben) [5], which are
now in widespread use globally, target mitochondrial
proteins. Unravelling and comparing mitochondrial
genomes of spider mites will not only increase our
understanding of the molecular evolution of acaricideresistance genes, but also help to develop new acaricides
uniquely targeting mitochondrial genes.
During the last 10 years, arthropod mitochondrial genomes have been extensively sequenced due to the
improvements of genomic technologies and the interest
in mitochondrial genome organization and evolution [6].
Mitochondrial genome sequences not only contain more
information than the shorter sequences of single genes,
but also provide larger data sets of genome-level features such as gene rearrangements and RNA secondary
structures [6-8]. To date, the complete mitochondrial
genomes have been sequenced from 25 Acari species.
Among these, 14 species belong to the superorder of
Parasitiformes while the remaining 11 species belong to
the superorder of Acariformes. Most mitochondrial genomes are about 15 kb circular molecules and encode 37
genes including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two
rRNA genes (rRNAs), and 22 tRNA genes (tRNAs),
which is typical of Metazoa [9]. However, the mitochondrial genomes of Leptotrombidium pallidum and Metaseiulus occidentalis possess duplicated genes [10,11], and
the mtDNA of the sexual oribatid mite Steganacarus
magnus lacks 16 tRNA genes [12]. In addition, gene
rearrangement, reverse base composition, and atypical
tRNA genes are frequently present in Acari, especially
for the Acariformes, such as in the mite genera Leptotrombidium [10,13], and Dermatophagoides [14,15], and
also in the mite species P. ulmi and T. urticae [3].
Generally, mitochondrial gene content and gene order
are highly conserved at the lower taxonomic rank (i.e.
family and genus), but gene content variation and
arrangement have reported for the genera Leptotrombidium [10,13] and Dermatophagoides [14,15]. In addition,

the inference of mite mitochondrial tRNA genes may be
extremely difficult and even error prone, especially
when comparative data is absent [15]. Thus, more mitochondrial genomes from closely related species will
improve the accuracy of annotations for mitochondrial
genomes, which will also greatly improve our understanding of molecular evolution and phylogenetic relationships [16-19]. In this study, we sequenced and
analyzed the complete mitochondrial genome of the
citrus red mite P. citri (Family Tetranychidae), an
important citrus pest with a worldwide distribution, and
provide a comparison to other Acari.

Results and discussion
Genome content and organization

The mitochondrial genome of P. citri is a typical circular
DNA molecule of 13,077 bp in length (GenBank:
HM189212, Figure 1, Additional File 1). This genome is
only 2 bp larger than that of another P. citri strain
(13,075 bp) [20] and slightly smaller than those of the
same-family species T. urticae (13,103 bp) [3] and
P. ulmi (13,115 bp) (Additional file 2). To date, the
mitochondrial genome of P. citri is the smallest within
all sequenced Acari and other Chelicerate genomes
available in the GenBank (status August 20, 2010). Its
relatively small size is primarily due to the significant
size reduction of PCGs, rrnL, and the putative control
region (A + T-rich region in arthropods) in comparison
with other Acari (Figure 2). The mitochondrial genome
of P. citri contains all 37 genes (13 PCGs, 22 tRNA
genes, and two rRNA genes) which are typically present
in metazoan mitochondrial genomes [9]. Among these,
20 genes (seven PCGs, two rRNA genes and 11 tRNA
genes) are located on the majority strand (J-strand) and
the others on the minority strand (N-strand) (Figure 1,
Additional File 1). Gene overlaps have been found at 11
gene junctions and have involved a total of 55 bp; the
longest overlap (14 bp) exists between trnV and trnI. In
addition to the large non-coding region, several small
non-coding intergenic spacers are present in the P. citri
mitochondrial genome and are spread over ten positions, ranging in size from 1 to 16 bp.
The largest non-coding region, which presumably functions as the mitochondrial control region, is 57 bp long
and is present between cox1 and nad3 (Figure 1, Additional File 1). This region is completely comprised of
adenines and thymines (A + T-rich region) and is the
third smallest among all sequenced mitochondrial genomes within Acari; only those of P. ulmi (55 bp) and
T. urticae (44 bp) are slightly smaller (Figure 2). The
maximum size difference found in the A + T-rich
regions across all sequenced Acari mitochondrial genomes is 2,756 bp, indicating that strong size variation
among Acari mitochondrial genomes is significantly

correlated to the A + T-rich regions (Figure 2). This
result is concordant with previous findings from other
chelicerates [21] and insects [22-24]. In fact, the A + Trich region has been identified as the source of size variation in the entire mitochondrial genome, usually due
to the presence of a variable copy number of repetitive
elements [25]. The relative location of the A + T-rich
region also varies greatly among Acari with the ancestral
pattern of arthropods being between rrnS and trnI [9].

Previous studies of insect A + T-rich region have
identified extensive conserved sequence stretches and
hypothetical secondary structure features, which are
supposed to be responsible for the control of replication
and transcription of the mtDNA [26-29]. In particular,
one of the most conserved sequence stretches discovered in hexapod A + T-rich region seems to be an array
of thymines (T-stretches), which are important signalling sites necessary for the initiation of the replication

process. In the J-strand of P. citri mitochondrial genome, a short T-stretch (4 bp) has been found six
nucleotides away from cox1, while a slightly longer
T-stretch (6 bp) has been recognized in the N-strand 17
nucleotides away from nad3 (Figure 3). Similar
T-stretch (4 bp) is also found in the J-strand of P. ulmi
A + T-rich region, but no T-stretch can be found in the
N-strand of P. ulmi and on both strand of T. urticae
(Figure 3). It has been shown that the T-stretches vary
in length, e.g., 4-10 nucleotides in the collembolan species, and >10 bp in holometabola [28,29]. While the
minimum length of T-stretch is not known, long Tstretches (>10 bp) seem to be indispensable for the
replication initiation of mtDNA [28]. Therefore, other
sequences instead of the T-stretches may provide essential signals for the replication initiation of mtDNA in
the species that do not possess the long T-stretches,
e.g., Locusta migratoria [28]. However, the A + T-rich
regions are highly variable among P. citri, P. ulmi and
T. urticae (75.0% sequence identity), and only several
short conserved sequences can be recognized (Figure 3).
On the other hand, the stem-loop secondary structure
in the A + T-rich region may also be involved in the
initiation of the replication of animal mtDNA [30]. The
A + T-rich region of the three spider mites can be
folded into stable stem-loop secondary structures

(Figure 3): two stem-loop structures are present in both
P. citri and P. ulmi, whereas only one is found in T.
urticae. It has been previously suggested that the
sequence flanking the stem-loop structure is highly conserved among arthropods: a TATA motif in the 5’-flanking sequence and a GA(A)T motif in the 3’-flanking
sequence [30]. Both motifs are presumed to have a functional significance in the replication and transcription of
the mtDNA [30-32], but are not present in the A + T-rich
regions of P. citri, P. ulmi, and T. urticae (Figure 3).
The gene order of the P. citri mitochondrial genome is
identical to those of P. ulmi and T. urticae (the trnK of
P. ulmi was misannotated on the opposite strand compared to P. citri, see below), but differs markedly from
those of all other known Acari and chelicerates (Figure
1, Figure 4, Additional file 3, also see [14] and [33] for
overviews of gene arrangement within Chelicerata).
Compared to Limulus polyphemus, which is considered
the representative ground pattern for arthropod mitochondrial genomes [34,35], a series of gene rearrangements have occurred in the evolutionary history of
P. citri; only nine of the 38 gene boundaries in L. polyphemus are conserved in P. citri. The most striking features are the inversions of two segments, which change
the relative position and transcriptional orientation of
six PCGs (cox3, atp6, atp8, cox2, nad4, and nad5) and

all of the 12 species belonging to the superorder of
Acariformes are highly rearranged [14,33], suggesting
that these gene arrangements within Acari are independently derived [33]. The rearrangement events (translocations and/or inversion) from other Acari (compared
to L. polyphemus) do not seem to be more parsimonious
to produce the gene arrangement of P. citri (Additional
File 3). It is clear that the unique mitochondrial genome
arrangement present in P. citri, P. ulmi, and T. urticae
likely occurred after Tetranychidae diverged from other
Acari, or after Acariformes split from Parasitiformes and
Opilioacariformes, because this feature is not shared
with any other Acari. Rearrangements of the mitochondrial genome should be relatively rare events at the evolutionary scale, and, therefore, provide a powerful tool
to delimit deep divergences among some metazoan
lineages [36]. However, the mitochondrial gene rearrangement phenomenon seems to occur frequently and
independently in Acari mitochondrial genomes [8,33],
possibly restricting the phylogenetic applications in
recovering the evolutionary relationships between superorders within the Acari. On the other hand, gene order
appears to be linked to taxonomic relatedness at the
lower rank (i.e. genus, family). For example, the relationship between prostriate ticks and metastriate ticks can
be distinguished by gene arrangements [31,37].
Base composition and codon usage

two tRNA genes (trnK and trnH); trnD may invert
before or after the rearrangement of the fragment cox3cox2. All 22 tRNA genes and two rRNA genes are also
severely rearranged, translocated and/or inverted, but do
not show any particular patterns.
So far, the complete mitochondrial genomes of 26
species belonging to Acari have been sequenced and
they exhibit great variation of gene order (Additional
file 3). Among them, 7 of the 14 species belonging to
the superorder of Parasitiformes (e.g. Ixodes spp.) share
the same gene order as the ancestral chelicerates, while

As is the case in other Acari mitochondrial genome
sequences, the nucleotide composition of the P. citri
mtDNA is also biased toward A and T (J-strand: A =
39.62%, T = 45.66%, G = 7.58%, C = 7.14%; Additional
file 1). A comparative analysis of A + T% vs AT-skew
and G + C% vs GC-skew across all available complete
mitochondrial genomes of Acari and L. polyphemus is
shown in Figure 5. The overall A + T content (85.28%)
of P. citri is similar to those of P. ulmi (85.60%) and
T. urticae (84.27%), but much higher than the average
A + T content of Acari mitochondrial genomes (75.34 ±
4.78%) as well as that of L. polyphemus (67.57%).
Metazoan mitochondrial genomes usually present a
clear strand bias in nucleotide composition [38,39]. In
detail, the J-strand is biased in favour of adenine and
cytosine, while the N-strand consequently contains
more thymine and guanine. The strand bias can be measured as AT- and GC-skews [40]. The average AT-skew
of Acari mitochondrial genome is 0.000 ± 0.101, ranging
from -0.253 in Dermatophagoides farinae to 0.264 in
Walchia hayashii, whereas the P. citri mitochondrial
genome exhibits a slight AT-skew (0.071) (Figure 5).
The marked AT-skew values are shared by the mitochondrial genomes of D. farinae (-0.253), D. pteronyssinus (-0.199), Unionicola foili (0.201), and W. hayashii
(0.264).

Figure 4 Gene rearrangements of the Panonychus citri mitochondrial genome. Only protein coding genes (PCGs) and ribosomal RNA
genes (rRNAs) are marked, whereas transfer RNA genes (tRNAs) are not denoted because they are highly complex. Green boxes represent genes
with the same relative position as in the arthropod ground pattern, Limulus polyphemus. Blue color indicates translocations, only, whereas yellow
color denotes translocations and inversions, combined. Horizontal lines combine adjacent genes, which are probably subject to a joint inversion.
tRNA genes are abbreviated using the one-letter amino acid code, with L1 = CUN; L2 = UUR; S1 = AGN; S2 = UCN. All genes are transcribed
from left to right except those underlined to indicate an opposite transcriptional orientation. Genes are not drawn to scale and non-coding
regions are not shown. PCR fragments (a-n) used to amplify the whole genome are also shown.

The average GC-skew of Acari mitochondrial genome
is -0.126 ± 0.195 and most of GC-skew values are negative, similar to those typically found in most metazoan
mitochondrial genomes. However, as has been reported
for other arthropods [38,39,41-43], six mite species in
four genera are characterized by a reversal of GC-skew:
Dermatophagoides [14,15], Phytoseiulus [44], Varroa
[45], and Panonychus (Figure 5). This reversal of the
strand bias could be the result of inversion of the control region [38], which contains all initiation sites for
replication and transcription of the mtDNA [46]. Therefore, an inversion of the control region is expected to
produce a global reversal of asymmetric mutational constraints in the mtDNA, with time resulting in a complete reversal of strand compositional bias [38]. In the
P. citri mtDNA most genes encoded on the J-strand
show a positive GC-skew at the fourfold degenerate
third codon position which is inverted to the common
pattern and probably indicates a reversal of the control
region (Additional file 1). Furthermore, this reverse
strand bias may occur after the genus Panonychus split
from the family Tetranychidae, because T. urticae,
belonging to the same-family (Tetranychidae) with
P. citri and P. ulmi, shows a usual GC-skew (negative),
as found in most of Acari.
The analyses of the base composition at each codon
position of the concatenated 13 PCGs of P. citri show
that the third codon positions (92.9%) have an A + T
content higher than that of the first (82.8%) and second
(79.4%) codon positions, as has also been found in other
sequenced Acari (Additional file 4). The relative synonymous codon frequencies (RSCU) reveal that codons
harbouring A or T in the third position are always overused as compared to other synonymous codons in the
P. citri mitochondrial genome (Table 1), as found in

other sequenced Acari (Additional file 5) and other chelicerates [21,47]. Among 62 amino-acid encoding codons
of invertebrate mitochondrial code [9], the P. citri mitochondrial genome uses 57 codons and never utilizes the
five G + C rich codons. Furthermore, the four AT-rich
codons TTT-Phe (15.3), TTA-Leu (11.4), ATT-Ile
(10.6), and ATA-Met (10.8) are the most frequently
used codons in the P. citri PCGs, (Table 1). Comparative analyses among other sequenced Acari also reveal a
similar pattern with the exceptions of D. farinae and
S. magnus, and the values range from 26.40% in Leptotrombidium akamushi to 48.83% in P. ulmi (Additional
file 5). This noted difference in the four most frequently
used codons between Acari seems to be directly linked
to the overall A + T content (Additional file 6), as
reported in other chelicerates and insects [47,48].
Protein-coding genes

The total length of all the 13 PCGs is 10,196 bp, and
accounts for 77.97% of the entire length of P. citri mitochondrial genome (Additional file 1). The overall A + T
content of PCGs is 73.91%, ranging from 78.45% (cox1)
to 92.06% (nad6). All the PCGs start with ATN codons,
which is typical for metazoan mitochondria [49]: one
(cox1) with ATC, three (nad3, nad4L, and nad1) with
ATA, four (cox2, cox3, atp6, and nad4) with ATG, and
the other five with ATT (Additional file 1). Eight PCGs
terminate with the conventional stop codons TAA
(cox1, nad3, nad4L, atp6, cox2, nad2, and nad4) or
TAG (cob), whereas the remaining five have incomplete
stop codons T. The presence of an incomplete stop
codon is common in metazoan mitochondrial genomes
[49] and these truncated stop codons are presumed to
be completed via post-transcriptional polyadenylation
[50]. A comparison of codon numbers across the

sequenced Acari mitochondrial genomes shows that all
PCGs are highly variable in length, covering a range
from 3,389 bp in P. citri to 6,328 bp in M. occidentalis
(Figure 2). Notably, the M. occidentalis mitochondrial
genome has the largest number of codons within chelicerates due to the duplication of many PCGs, even

though nad3 and nad6 are lost [11]. However, a recent
study has found that the M. occidentalis mtDNA is
smaller than originally suggested, and nad3 is not lacking but is in fact located between nad4L and rrnS [44].
P. citri, P. ulmi, and T. urticae have a reduction in
mean content of 19.8, 19.8, and 19.0 codons per PCG,

respectively, making them the three smallest mitochondrial genomes within Acari.
The 13 PCGs of P. citri were combined with those of
other Acari to investigate the evolutionary patterns
among PCGs in Acari. The nucleotide substitution rates
per site greatly vary among genes (Figure 6). In this
respect, nad1 shows the highest value (3.69 ± 0.24), followed by nad6, while cox1 appears to be the lowest. The
number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous

site (Ks) of cox3 is the highest, but its number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) is
much lower, while this value for nad1 is the highest.
Therefore, at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, cox1
is the slowest evolving protein, making it a useful marker
for investigating phylogenetic relationships at higher
taxonomic levels. However, a DNA barcoding approach
based on cox1 sequence diversity has been utilized for
identification of closely related species [51]. By contrast,
due to the highest divergence, nad1 can be used as an
effective molecular marker to analyze intraspecific relationships and reveal relationships between populations
within the same Acari species. The Ks of each PCG has a
relatively high value compared to Ka, which may indicate
that these genes are evolving under purifying selection
[16,52]. Notably, nad1 accumulates amino acid substitutions twice as fast as the Acari mitochondrial average,
possibly implying positive selection acting at nad1 or due
to relax selection. Furthermore, a negative correlation
has been found between the Ka/Ks and the GC content
of each PCG (R = -0.676, P = 0.011), indicating that the
variation of GC content probably causes the different
evolutionary patterns among genes [23].
Transfer and ribosomal RNA genes

The two genes encoding the large and small rRNA subunits (rrnL and rrnS) are located between trnE and trnR,
and between trnY and trnG (Figure 1, Additional file 1).
Both genes are encoded on the J-strand, as in P. ulmi,
T. urticae [3], M. occidentalis [11], and Phytoseiulus persimilis [44], and in the two genera Dermatophagoides
[14,15] and Leptotrombidium (but L. pallidum has a
duplicated rrnL gene on the N-strand) [10,13]. In contrast, in the mitochondrial genomes of other Acari
and most species of chelicerates and arthropods,
both rRNA genes are encoded on the N-strand
[12,31,33,34,43,47,53,54]. We annotate the 5’- and 3’ends of two rRNA genes as the first nucleotide downstream and upstream of corresponding tRNA genes,
respectively, and the size of the rrnL and rrnS of P. citri
are 989 bp and 648 bp long, respectively (Additional file
1). The A + T contents of rrnL and rrnS (86.66% and
87.54%, respectively) are similar to those of P. ulmi
(86.76% and 88.01%, respectively) and T. urticae (85.27%
and 85.91%, respectively), but much higher than the
average value of Acari (78.58 ± 4.57% and 77.17 ±
5.08%, respectively). The boundaries of some tRNA
genes are incorrectly delimited in P. ulmi, T. urticae and
another strain of P. citri (see below). This aspect affects
the boundaries of rrnL and rrnS in these taxa. Thus we
re-annotate also these genes (Additional file 2). The size
of rrnL and rrnS of P. citri is similar to those of another
P. citri strain (992 bp and 650 bp), P. ulmi (983 bp and
659 bp) and T. urticae (992 bp and 645 bp). The size of

replicates).

rrnL of P. citri is the second shortest among all
sequenced Acari mitochondrial genomes, whereas the
size of rrnS is slightly larger than those of other Acariform mites (637.83 ± 27.70 bp), but are much shorter
than those found in the Parasitiformes (702.57 ± 21.52
bp) (Figure 2).
The secondary structures of the two rRNA genes
inferred for P. citri have similar stem-loop structures as
those published for L. pallidum [13] and D. pteronyssinus [14] (Figure 7, Figure 8). All the helices of the rrnL
found in L. pallidum are present in P. citri; however,
three helices (C1, E2 and E19) found in D. pteronyssinus
are not present in P. citri. The lack of helix C1 is largely
due to the size reduction of the P. citri rrnL compared
to the D. pteronyssinus rrnL, and the deleted nucleotides
are mainly located at 5’-end. The helix H3 is similar in
size to those of L. pallidum and D. pteronyssinus, but
appears to be lost in P. ulmi and T. urticae, though the
length of the three spider mite species is similar. Compared to the 5’-end, the 3’-end of rrnL structure is more
conserved among P. citri, P. ulmi, and T. urticae (Figure
7), especially for the helices G16-G20. In addition, the
loop region of helix H2 is highly conserved not only in
Tetranychidae, but also in the other two mite genera
Leptotrombidium [10,13] and Dermatophagoides [14,15].
Like in L. pallidum and D. pteronyssinus, one compound
helix replaces three helices (24-25-26) of the Drosophila

yakuba rrnS [13]. In the middle of rrnS, two helices (39
and 42) are present in P. citri, which is more similar to
that of S. magnus [12], but only a compound helix (3940-41-42) is present in L. pallidum and D. pteronyssinus.
In addition, the helix 1 not present in L. pallidum is
found in the rrnS of P. citri; this helix is also found in
D. pteronyssinus. The most conserved sequences of rrnS
among Tetranychidae are found in the helices 19, 21,
32, 33, 49, and 50 (Figure 8).
Out of 22 tRNA genes usually present in metazoan
mitochondrial genomes, only 13 tRNA genes can be
detected in the P. citri mitochondrial genome by tRNAscan-SE [55] and/or ARWEN [56]. The remaining nine
tRNA genes (trnN, trnD, trnP, trnY, trnS2, trnA, trnS1,
trnV, trnI) were identified by manually aligning unassigned sequences to known tRNA genes from T. urticae
and P. ulmi, as suggested by Masta and Boore [43]. All
22 tRNA sequences were aligned with those of P. ulmi
and T. urticae, and show high similarity among Tetranychidae, especially for the anticodon stem (Additional file
7). However, only eight tRNA genes (trnF, trnY, trnT,
trnL2, trnC, trnH, trnW, and trnM) of both P. ulmi and
T. urticae are correctly annotated on GenBank. Among
the remaining tRNA genes, the boundaries of ten tRNA
genes of another P. citri strain (trnR, trnP, trnG, trnT,
trnQ, trnC, trnA, trnS1, trnV, and trnI) and T. urticae
(trnN, trnD, trnE, trnP, trnG, trnQ, trnS2, trnA, trnV,

and trnI), and 11 tRNA genes of P. ulmi (trnN, trnL1,
trnR, trnP, trnK, trnQ, trnS2, trnA, trnS1, trnV, and trnI)
were incorrect on GenBank (Additional file 2), because
most of them appear to lack the sequences to form the
canonical amino acid acceptor stem (seven nucleotides)
or at least one D- or T-arm (Additional file 8). The
trnK of P. ulmi is misannotated on the J-strand, but in
this location an unpaired anticodon stem is found. In
fact, the majority of the nucleotides of trnK among Tetranychidae are highly conserved (Additional file 7), and
only when trnK of P. ulmi is on the N-strand, as in P.
citri and T. urticae, can canonical secondary structure
of tRNA genes be found (Additional file 8). Therefore,
we re-annotate these tRNA genes to incorporate the
conserved structural features of tRNA genes (e.g., the
possession of seven nucleotides in the amino acid

acceptor stem, and at least one T- or D-arm) (Additional file 2), and present their secondary structures in
Additional file 8.
Eleven tRNA genes overlap with adjacent genes in a
total of 55 bp, as in another P. citri strain, whereas ten
and nine gene overlaps are present in P. ulmi and T.
urticae, respectively (Additional file 2). The most truncated tRNA genes are trnQ, trnA, and trnI in P. citri,
whose sequences overlap the trnL2, nad6 and trnV on
the same or opposite strand for 13, 10, and 14 nucleotides, respectively (Additional file 1). The similar situations are found in P. ulmi and T. urticae (Additional file
2). The similar amount of gene overlap on the same
strand has been reported for the spider Habronattus
oregonensis [43] and the house dust mite D. pteronyssinus [14]. Furthermore, if the three tRNA genes (trnQ,

trnA, and trnI) do not overlap adjacent genes, they lack
the sequences to form either the usual amino acid
acceptor stem or at least one D- or T-arm. In addition,
the nucleotides present in the anticodon arm of the
three tRNA genes are highly conserved among Tetranychidae (Additional file 7). Other gene overlaps found in
tRNA genes of Tetranychidae are not more than five
nucleotides (Additional file 2). The average size (54.1 ±
4.1 bp) of tRNA genes found in P. citri is similar to
those of P. ulmi (55.1 ± 4.5) and T. urticae (54.1 ± 3.6

bp), reducing the potential of tRNA genes to form a
typical metazoan cloverleaf structure (Figure 9). In fact,
the average size of tRNA genes of Acariformes (mean =
54.8 ± 1.0 bp) is considerably shorter with respect to
those of all species of Parasitiformes (mean = 62.0 ± 1.3
bp) as well as L. polyphemus (mean = 66.3 ± 2.5 bp,
Additional file 9), indicating that atypical tRNA genes
may be a common phenomenon in Acariformes.
Out of 22 tRNA genes, only three tRNA genes (trnN,
trnL2, and trnK) can potentially fold into a typical

cloverleaf structure, whereas all the remaining 19 tRNA
genes appear to lack the sequence to code the D- or Tarm (Figure 9), as found in P. ulmi and T. urticae
(Additional file 8). In at least 13 tRNA genes, the T-arm
has been substituted by a loop of variable size (TVreplacement), whereas another six tRNA genes (trnD,
trnE, trnQ, trnS1, trnS2, and trnV) show a Dreplacement loop instead of the D-arm (Figure 9). With
the exception of trnP, which seems to be lost the D-arm
in P. ulmi, all tRNA genes have similar secondary structures among Tetranychidae (Figure 9, Additional file 8).
The loss of the D-arm in trnS1 (AGN) has been considered a typical feature of metazoan mitochondrial genomes [49]. The absence of the T-arm seems to be a
common feature for the tRNA genes of chelicerates
from the orders of the Araneae, Scorpiones, Thelyphonida, and Acariform Acari [10,13-15,43,57], whereas
other orders (Amblypygi, Opiliones, Solifugae, and Parasitiform Acari) possess typical metazoan cloverleaf
tRNAs [57]. On the other hand, the loss of the D-arm
of tRNA genes is an uncommon circumstance but has
been reported for a few of mitochondrial tRNA genes
from chelicerates, including the scorpion Centruroides
limpidus [58], the sea spiders Nymphon gracile [47] and
Achelia bituberculata [21], and five mites belonging to
two genera Leptotrombidium [10,13] and Dermatophagoides [15]. It has been shown that in the nematode
Ascaris suum the tRNA genes that lack either the D- or
T-arm are functional [59], but functional tRNA genes
that lack both the D- and T-arms have not been found
before. However, tRNA genes that lack both T- and Darms have been reported for the sea spider A. bituberculata (trnA) [21] and the scorpion C. limpidus (trnQ and
trnS1) [58]. In the American house dust mite D. farinae,
some tRNA genes (e.g. trnA) lacking the D-arm have a
small (2-3 bp) and thermodynamically unstable T-arm,
suggesting that these tRNA genes may have lost both Dand T-arms in reality [15]. In this study, we also found
that some inferred T-arms (e.g., trnS2, trnV) or D-arms
(e.g., trnY, trnR, trnP) were short (Figure 9). In particular, the inferred D-arm of trnY in P. ulmi and T. urticae
(only one bp) is shorter than in P. citri, whereas the Darm of trnP is lost in P. ulmi, casting doubt on their
identity as D-arms. Therefore, further experiments are
needed to investigate whether these truly tRNA genes
lack both D- and T-arms and if so, whether they are
functional.
Twenty of 22 tRNA genes have a five bp well-paired
anticodon stem, and the remaining two tRNA genes
(trnM and trnS1) have a single mismatch within this
stem. All tRNA genes, but trnI, have the seven canonical
nucleotides in the anticodon loop, whereas trnI has eight
nucleotides in this region, which is also found for trnI of
P. ulmi and T. urticae (Additional file 8). These

Page 13 of 16

noncanonical anticodon loops are not common, but have
also been reported for the house dust mite D. pteronyssinus (trnL2) [14], the scorpion Mesobuthus gibbosus (trnH
and trnN) [58], and the wild two-humped Camelus bactrianus ferus (trnS1) [60]. Only nine of the 22 tRNA
genes have a completely matched seven bp aminoacyl
acceptor stem (trnN, trnD, trnE, trnG, trnL2, trnK, trnF,
trnW, and trnY), while the remaining 13 tRNA genes
have 1-3 bp mismatches in this stem. This type of a mispaired acceptor stem seems to be a common phenomenon for tRNA genes of chelicerates (e.g., Araneae
[42,43], Acari [14,15], Scorpiones [58]), and a posttranscriptional RNA editing mechanism has been proposed
to maintain function of these tRNA genes [43,61].

Conclusions
We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of
the spider mite, P. citri (Family Tetranychidae). This
mitochondrial genome in size is similar to those of other
spider mites, P. ulmi and T. urticae, and is the smallest
among all sequenced Acari and other Chelicerate genomes. The gene order of the P. citri mtDNA is identical
to those of P. ulmi and T. urticae, but markedly differs
from those of other chelicerates by a large number of
gene inversions and/or translocations, suggesting that
rearrangements occurred after Tetranychidae diverged
from other Acari. Comparative analyses among Acari
mitochondrial genomes show that the genome size, gene
order, gene content, codon usage, and base composition
are strongly variable. The Acari mitochondrial nad1 exhibits a faster amino acid substitution rate than the average, and the G + C content variation causes the different
evolutionary patterns among genes of Acari mitochondrial genomes. Most tRNA genes present in P. citri are
minimal and atypical, lacking the D- or T-arm, as found
in P. ulmi and T. urticae. While extremely short and
unusual tRNA genes seem to be common for Acariform
mites, further experimental evidence is needed.
Methods
Samples and DNA extraction

Female adult of P. citri was collected on Trifoliate
orange from Citrus Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chongqing, China. Total
DNA was extracted from about 800 females using a
CTAB-based protocol [62] and stored at -20°C.
PCR amplification and sequencing

Fourteen pairs of PCR primers were employed to
amplify overlapping segments of the entire mitochondrial genome of P. citri. Initially, cox1 and cob genes
were amplified using the primers COI-F/R [63,64] and
CB3-F/CB4-R [65], respectively. Four perfectly matching
primers, namely cox1-R1, cox1-F4, cob-R3 and cob-F3,

Yuan et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:597
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/597

were designed on the basis of the sequence information
from cox1 and cob. Other primers were designed based
on the conserved nucleotide sequences in T. urticae [3]
and P. ulmi (GenBank: NC_012571). A full of list of primers as well as PCR conditions are presented in Additional file 10. All PCR products were separated by
electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, purified with DNA
Gel Purification Kit (Watson, Shanghai), and cloned into
the pGEM-T vector (Promega, USA). After heat-shock
transformation of Escherichia coli (Trans5a, Beijing
TransGen Biotech) cells, the positive recombinant clone
with an insert was sequenced with M13 primers on
both strands.
Sequence assembly, annotation and analysis

Sequence data were assembled using SeqMan software
(DNAStar, Inc.). Protein coding genes (PCGs) were
identified by ORF Finder implemented at the NCBI
website with the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic
codes and by comparison with the published Acari
mitochondrial sequences with Clustal W 2.0 [66]. Two
large non-protein-coding regions were candidates for
the rRNA genes (rrnL and rrnS). The boundaries were
determined based on alignments and secondary structures of rRNA sequences of other mite species. The
tRNA genes were identified by their cloverleaf secondary
structure using tRNAscan-SE 1.21 [55] and ARWEN
[56]. For tRNAscan-SE the following parameters were
changed: Search Mode = “EufindtRNA-Cove”, Source =
“Nematode Mito”, Genetic Code = “Invertebrate Mito”
and Cove score cutoff = 0.1. ARWEN was run with
default parameters. Other tRNA genes were identified
by aligning to known tRNA genes from P. ulmi and T.
urticae [43]. The secondary structure models for two
rRNA genes of P. citri were constructed by comparison
with the published rRNA secondary structures for L.
pallidum [13], D. pteronyssinus [14], and S. magnus
[12]. The secondary structure of A + T-rich region
(putative control region) was constructed using Mfold
Server [67]. The complete mitochondrial genome
sequence of P. citri has been deposited in the GenBank
database under the accession number HM189212. The
base composition, codon usage, and nucleotide substitution were analyzed with Mega 4.0 [68] and DAMBE
5.0.59 [69]. Mitochondrial genome sequences from
other Acari and the horseshoe crab L. polyphemus were
obtained for comparative analyses (see Additional file 11
for GenBank accession numbers).
