Abstract
Diagnosis and treatment of children affected by disruptions of attachment (out of home placement,
multiple changes of primary caregiver) is an area of considerable controversy. The possible
contribution of psychobiological theories is discussed in three parts. The first part relates the
attachment theoretical perspective to major psychobiological theories on the developmental
associations of parent-child relationships and emotional response. The second part reviews studies
of autonomic reactivity and HPA-axis activity with foster children, showing that foster children
show more reactivity within physiological systems facilitating fight or flight behaviours rather than
social engagement, especially foster children with atypical attachment behaviour. The third part is
focused on treatment of children suffering from the consequences of disrupted attachment, based
on a psychotherapy study with psychophysiological outcome measures. Implications are discussed
for theory, diagnosis, and intervention.

Review
In severe and systematic cases of abuse and neglect, out of
home care is often used as intervention to stop abuse and
neglect. Being placed out of home, children may experience more physical security but not necessarily more emotional security. Young children in particular, who may not
yet have had the opportunity to develop secondary attachment relationships, may lose the only source of security
and comfort that they had, however fallible or limited it
was. Experiments with primates [1,2] and experiments of
nature with orphanage children [3,4] suggest that the risks
of severe disruptions of attachment are profound. Fortunately, these and other studies also suggest that these risks
may be partially offset by a positive and stable caregiving
environment. This has led to an interest in the processes
that might mediate the impact of attachment disruptions

and compensatory attachment experiences on socioemotional development, in particular the pivotal role of
attachment relationships with caregivers in the psychophysiological regulation of affect [5-8]. In this contribution, we discuss psychobiological propositions that may
complement attachment theory in order to understand
the effects of attachment disruptions. Against this background, we discuss studies on children with disrupted
attachment in which the quality of their current caregiving
experience was related to psychophysiological parameters, using cross-sectional as well as experimental study
designs. The findings are discussed with respect to the
value of integrating psychobiological theory in the design
and evaluation of psychological and behavioural interventions for children with disrupted attachment.

Psychophysiological regulation of affect and attachment
disruptions
Attachment refers to a behavioural propensity to seek contact and proximity to an attachment figure when feeling
insecure, due to perceived danger, illness, exhaustion, or
other natural cues to danger [9]. In addition, a perceived
lack of access to attachment figures is supposed to engender the display of signals of insecurity, which can only be
terminated when contact is re-established or an alternative attachment figure is found. Bowlby proposed that
responses to separation are the product of the attachment
behavioural system, which is organized around the set
goal of emotional security. This homeostatic function of
the attachment behavioural system, as Bowlby called it,
has attracted the attention of psychobiologists such as
Hofer [6], who has worked on identifying which neurobiological systems may be involved in organisms'
responses to separation or loss.

According to Hofer, parent-child relationships support a
range of regulatory processes, including thermoregulation, food intake, tactile stimulation, imitation, and emotional attunement, to name a few. Separation from the
parent results in a complete withdrawal of all these regulatory influences, which implicates that children would
have to fall back on alternative self-regulatory processes.
Because young children's self-regulatory capacities are few
and immature, prolonged reliance on these systems may
contribute to maladaptive development. Another implication of Hofer's view is that the impact on developmental
outcomes of disruptions as well as variations in quality of
parent-child interaction may be mediated by multiple and
sometimes interrelated regulatory processes, including
but not limited to the attachment behavioural system proposed by Bowlby. This would explain why attachment disruptions appear to have consequences for functioning and
development that are not confined to the domain of close
personal relationships, including behavioural maladjustment and cognitive development [10]. A recent epidemiological study on adult women with a history of foster
care reported negative outcomes in the domains of mental
and physical health, smoking, educational attainment,
obesity, and poverty [11]. Compelling findings in this
regard were from a longitudinal sample of high risk families, assessed from infancy to adolescence with a broad
array of observational measures and reports from parents
as well as teachers [12]. This study showed increases in
teacher reported behaviour problems after foster placement, compared to children remaining in their own
homes with their maltreating parents, taking into account
baseline adaption and SES. In the long term, children
placed out of home showed levels of behavioural maladjustment similar to the children remaining with maltreating parents, and heightened as compared to children
growing up in high risk families with adequate parenting.

While attachment research is primarily focused on behavioural regulation in parent-child interaction, psychobiological processes are receiving increasing attention. This
has been happening in parallel with advances in measuring the output from specific brain and physiological systems that may be related to psychological and behaviour
functioning, as well as in parallel with growing theoretical
insight in these relations. The current review focuses on
the study of psychophysiology and disrupted attachment,
and not on cognitive neuroscientific or brain imaging
research [13], although this approach is also starting to
yield important insight in the development of children
with disrupted attachment and the effects of interventions
such as foster care [14]. Psychophysiological models provide a further step into advancing our insight into the substrate of behavioural development. Such models have
shown to provide a fruitful approach for providing explanations for the developmental links between environmental factors confined to the domain of attachment and
outcomes spread across a broad array of other domains,
such as mental and even physical health [8]. Psychophysiological models may also be applied in order to expand
the range of possible correlates of subjective experiences
that may be studied, especially when it is hard for research
participants to communicate these experiences, for example because their reports may be biased or because their
communicative ability is too low, such as in children or
persons with severe learning difficulties. Psychophysiological measures can be taken in vivo, which presents
opportunities for links with behaviour and social interaction. Psychophysiological research on disrupted attachment is therefore highly relevant from a clinical
developmental perspective.
In order to test theoretical predictions using physiological
measures, it is necessary to identify which physiological
measures are specific indices for the activity of relevant
regulatory processes, and under which conditions. Hofer's
identification of a multitude of regulatory processes that
are hidden in the parent-child relationship warns of an
important caveat in deriving from the presence or absence
of specific physiological effects the presence or absence of
psychological states, such as attachment security. The
physiological output from processes supported by parentchild relationships may work in the same or in opposite
directions. A separation from the parent may, for example, engender a so-called neuroception of danger and
influence arousal in the sympathetic and parasympathetic
parts of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) [7]. At the
same time, separation from the parent may remove a
source of cognitive stimulation, which has also been
found to lead to changes in parasympathetic activity [15].
The occurrence of parasympathetic reactivity on separation from a presumed attachment figure therefore leaves
open multiple psychological interpretations. Similarly,

the absence of discernable physiological reactivity may be
equivocal as long as it is possible that another regulatory
process has had a counteracting influence on the physiological index.
Porges' polyvagal theory
An important step in identifying more specific links
between psychophysiology and attachment has been
taken by abandoning the concept of general arousal in
response to peripheral challenges in favour of an
approach that seeks to identify the organization of discrete physiological responses [16]. One avenue for such
research has been the polyvagal theory as developed by
Porges [17] to describe the neural underpinnings of adaptive and maladaptive autonomic nervous system
responses to challenges facing humans. In short, polyvagal theory proposes that human adaptive behaviour is
supported by three, hierarchically ordered systems within
the autonomic nervous system: the immobilization system, the mobilization system, and the social engagement
system.

The social engagement system is supposed to be the phylogenetically newest system. It is active when the environment is perceived as safe, and its function is to inhibit
bodily processes that interfere with physical growth and
restoration (including slowing heart rate, inhibiting fight/
flight mechanisms of the sympathetic nervous system,
and dampening stress responses across the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenocortical [HPA]-axis), while facilitating the
regulation of muscles, including muscles in the face and
head turning muscles used for social engagement behaviour. Neurophysiologically, this system involves activity
in the myelinated vagus, implying fast response times and
efficient modulation of behavioural responses. This component, which is supposed to originate in the nucleus
ambiguous, is therefore nicknamed as the 'smart vagus'
[18].
The mobilization system is phylogenetically older, and
depends on the sympathetic-adrenal system. If harm is
perceived as imminent, the influence of the social engagement system 'dissolves' which means that inhibitory
influences on heart rate and fight/flight mechanisms are
lifted. This gives way to increased cardiac output under the
influence of the sympathetic nervous system, decreased
expenditure on long-term processes such as growth and
immune system activity, and increased expression of the
HPA-axis, which are more under the control of limbic
structures. This results in a state which might be described
as 'arousal', in which psychological states and behaviours
such as panic and rage can occur that present a final
opportunity for evasive action.
The immobilization system would have the oldest phylogenetic roots, and appears to be based in the other, unmyeli-

http://www.capmh.com/content/3/1/26

nated branch of the vagus, also called the vegetative vagus.
This system would come into play when the social engagement and the mobilization system both break down. This
system facilitates responses that might limit physical damage and increase chances of survival, such as vessel constriction, freezing, and behavioural shutdown. The
physiological changes induced can be so massive, that
these responses are not without risk to the individual (e.g.,
when fainting).
The hierarchical organization among these three systems
implies a process that links these systems to peripheral
systems. Porges proposed a subcortical process called neuroception to monitor the environment for safety, danger,
and life threat. Based on recent advances in imaging
research, he speculated that neuroception might involve
structures in the temporal cortex that evaluate familiar
faces, voice, and movements, providing the organism with
information about the relative safety of the situation. As a
result, for most individuals the presence of familiar persons gives way to activity in the social engagement system,
and deactivation of the mobilization and immobilization
systems. This allows individuals to affiliate and cooperate,
a prominent behavioural feature in our species [19].
Porges [17] proposed that if neuroception goes awry and
fails to detect safety in familiar social settings, disordered
social behaviour might ensue, such as in autism, social
anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, and reactive attachment disorder. These disorders might therefore be understood as expressions of fight/flight tendencies under
conditions that would otherwise allow affiliative and collaborative behaviour, limiting children's opportunities for
social and cognitive development, and damaging the
social position in the social sphere. Similarly maladaptive
may be the failure to activate the mobilization system in
risk environments, which appears characteristic of children with William's Syndrome and which may also
underlie indiscriminately sociable behaviour towards
strangers and straying away of children with Reactive
Attachment Disorder, disinhibited type.
In sum, instead of looking merely at general arousal in
relation to attachment disruptions, psychobiological
research has advanced towards testing physiological indices of specific systems. Polyvagal theory, as an important
example, provides a basis for hypothesizing about individual differences in the associations between (experimentally induced) experiences and behavioural states to
specific physiological systems [20]. Given the multiple
determination of physiological responses, however, caution should be exercised in inferring psychological process
from physiological responses [20]. Still, psychobiological
mediators of the impact of attachment disruptions on
mental and perhaps also physical health [21] are a likely
complement to the psychological mediators proposed by
Bowlby and Ainsworth in the form of mental models of

attachment relationships [13]. For that reason, the success
of interventions aimed at children with disrupted attachment may not only be measured at the behavioural and
affective-cognitive level, but also at the psychobiological
level.
Psychobiological outcomes of foster care
One of the most invasive interventions in the lives of children is to place them into foster care. As noted, children
are not only removed from their familiar surroundings,
but they are also separated from their existing attachment
figures. For many children placed in foster care, out-ofhome placement is the first in a series of placements and
disruptions of newly formed attachment relationships
with foster parents [22]. These experiences compound the
difficulties that these children may already have with
stress-regulation, due to the atypical experiences that have
led to the foster placement [23]. Psychobiological studies
of foster children have focused on ANS reactivity and
activity of the HPA-axis.
Autonomic reactivity and attachment to foster parents
For foster placement to have a potential beneficial effect
on mental health, placements should not only be stable
and nurturing, but children must also learn to use their
foster parents as external regulators of their psychological
and physiological responses to stress. A first study that
included measures of ANS reactivity to examine the specific role of foster parents in the regulation system of foster children was reported by Oosterman and Schuengel
[24]. ANS reactivity of preschool age foster children (n =
60) towards their foster parents was compared to ANS
reactivity of children without disruptions in their attachment histories (n = 50) towards their parents. Autonomic
reactivity was measured during the Strange Situation Procedure [25], using an ambulatory device [26] which continuously recorded heart rate (HR) as a composite
measure of general arousal, respiratory sinus arrhythmia
(RSA) as a measure of reactivity within the parasympathetic part of the ANS and reflective of activity of the
'smart vagus' [18], and pre-ejection period (PEP) as a
measure of reactivity within the sympathetic part of the
ANS. Children's responses to separation from their parent
or foster parent were reflected in increases in HR and
decreases in RSA. This is consistent with studies reporting
that RSA decreased after the first separation in the Strange
Situation [27,28]. Within Porges' polyvagal theory, the
decrease in RSA is interpreted as an indication that the
social engagement system was activated by the stressor
[17], in this case the separations. There were no significant
differences in these responses between foster and control
children.

Across the whole Strange Situation Procedure, control
children displayed a larger decrease in RSA than foster

http://www.capmh.com/content/3/1/26

children, and showed more variability in RSA across the
episodes, suggesting that the social engagement system
was more active in regulating their responses to separations and reunions with their caregiver as well as the with
stranger. Other interpretations are also possible, however.
A study with low risk infants with their birth parents
found that securely attached infants showed a smaller
decrease in RSA during the Strange Situation than children
with avoidant attachment, and RSA in securely attached
children returned to baseline levels whereas RSA
remained significantly below baseline for the avoidant
infants [27]. This finding might be taken as a possible
contradiction of the view that securely attached infants
would be more prone to regulate responses to separations
and reunions through social engagement than avoidant
attached infants. In order to entangle possible interpretations of differences in physiological responses, it is therefore necessary to study concurrent behavioural indicators
and other correlates of RSA. Without directly linking
social engagement behaviour to online measures of ANS
responses, explanations for the differences in ANS
responses throughout the Strange Situation will remain
speculative.
A further investigation of the foster group also shed light
on correlates of ANS responses in the Strange Situation. It
would be expected that foster children as a group, who are
likely to have had traumatic experiences and neglect,
would not only show less parasympathetic reactivity in
the Strange Situation, but would also show more sympathetic reactivity because for these children fight or flight
responses might have been more adaptive. However, foster children as a group did not show more sympathetic
reactivity within the Strange Situation. Within the group,
however, differences were found. Indicators of negative
preplacement experiences and disorganized attachment to
the foster caregiver were associated with more sympathetic and less parasympathetic reactivity. Increased sympathetic reactivity across the Strange Situation was
associated with preplacement experiences of neglect;
other indicators of early adversity were not associated
with sympathetic reactivity. Within the Strange Situation,
quality of attachment was coded for preschool attachment
[29]. A distinction was made between ordered types of
attachment (secure, avoidant, and ambivalent; 85%) and
disorganized types of attachment (disorganized-controlling and insecure-other; 15%). Attachment quality was
not associated with preplacement experiences. Children
with a disorganized attachment relationship with their
foster parent displayed more sympathetic ANS reactivity
(PEP decrease) on the first separation as well as across the
Strange Situation; they also differed from children with
ordered attachment patterns with respect to parasympathetic reactivity, by showing a RSA increase on the first
separation, rather than RSA decrease and by showing RSA

decrease on the second reunion, rather than RSA increase
[30]. These are first findings, requiring replication in other
samples of foster children. Other studies that looked at
the association between attachment quality and reactivity
in the parasympathetic as well as sympathetic part of the
ANS across the Strange Situation used another measure of
sympathetic reactivity (alpha-amylase [27]), or did not
assess disorganized attachment [27,28].
Physiological responses during the Strange Situation also
shed an interesting light on behaviour patterns that have
been associated with clinically defined disorders of attachment. An interaction effect was found between time in
placement and symptoms of disordered attachment, in
particular symptoms of indiscriminately friendly/disinhibited behaviour [24]. Based on the idea that attachment
relationships need time to develop before they become a
source of emotional security, it was expected that children
with longer placements would show a stronger increase of
RSA (indicative of regulation of the parasympathetic part
of the ANS) from separation to reunion with the foster
parent in the Strange Situation than children with shorter
placements. This was indeed found to be the case, but not
for children with symptoms of disinhibited attachment.
For the latter group of children, who according to the
report by their foster parents showed a clear lack of selective contact seeking when distressed and were prone to
wander away with relative strangers, the increase from
separation to reunion was weaker when placements had
been longer. Symptoms of disordered attachment such as
disinhibited behaviour may therefore moderate the outcome of foster placement. In fact, attachment security to
the foster parent was only found to be significantly associated with foster parent sensitivity, when symptoms of
disordered attachment were taken into account [31]. This
pattern of findings indicates that there might be a subgroup of children who might not experience the benefit of
a positive caregiving environment, because their interaction with their foster parents is not facilitated by the social
engagement system. Instead, there is a subgroup of foster
children with disorganized patterns of attachment that
appear to resort more to sympathetic reactivity, facilitating fight/flight stress responses.
HPA-axis response and intervention programs for foster parents
The HPA-axis has been studied intensively as a system
mediating the impact of psychological and physical stressors on behaviour and health. According to Porges [17],
the HPA-axis joins the sympathetic part of the ANS within
the mobilization system, which becomes active when
neuroception of imminent threat occurs, the social
engagement system 'dissolves', and the organism has to be
prepared for a fight or flight. The HPA-axis expresses itself
by secretion of the hormone cortisol, which can be gauged
from increased concentrations in blood and saliva. Corti-

http://www.capmh.com/content/3/1/26

sol facilitates the release of energy but also stimulates the
immune system. It acts on receptors in the brain, in a way
that is adaptive as a response to acute stress, but might
become maladaptive when stress is chronic [32]. Cortisol
plays a role maintaining a diurnal pattern, which for
humans means that cortisol levels are high after awakening and low at night.
Chronic stress may disrupt the normative diurnal pattern
of cortisol, and for this reason has received a fair amount
of attention as an indicator of stress and self-regulation
among children in foster care. Indeed, it has been found
that foster children were more likely than controls to display an abnormally flattened diurnal cortisol pattern, due
to very low morning levels or stable high levels [33,34]. In
the study of Bruce et al., low morning cortisol was especially associated with a history of severe physical neglect.
Based on animal and some human research, low morning
cortisol levels may be the result of exposure to chronic
stress resulting from abuse or neglect [35]. But not all foster children may have had a similar experience. Bruce and
her colleagues also identified foster children who had primarily been exposed to emotional abuse. These children
showed atypical high levels of morning cortisol. This may
be explained by the more acute, episodic stress associated
with emotional abuse [36]. These findings underline the
need for more research to tease out whether patterns of
physiological functioning of foster children are due to the
out of home placement (as a disruption of attachment) or
to aberrant experiences that precede out of home placement. In both cases, however, foster children are to be
considered a group at risk for atypical psychophysiological development.
Fortunately, however, in independent investigations,
Dozier and her colleagues as well as Fisher and his colleagues have provided experimental evidence suggesting
that cortisol patterns may be changed towards more adaptive patterns using interventions with foster parents. Dozier developed the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catchup (ABC) program for new foster parents through the first
months of placement, to help them in 4 to 5 home visits
to promote secure attachment through nurturing care and
in 5 to 6 home visits to regulate behaviour and physiology. The randomized trial showed heightened cortisol levels in a lab setting among the foster children in the control
treatment compared to foster children in the ABC-condition [37].
Fisher and his colleagues evaluated the effect of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for preschoolers (MTFCP), an intensive therapeutic foster care program for high
risk foster children [38]. This program involves intensive
training for foster parents in behaviour management, support from a multidisciplinary team throughout place-

ment, telephone-based monitoring and guidance of foster
parents, and therapeutic play group activities for the children. It was found that over time, children in the intervention group maintained a diurnal cortisol pattern more
typical of their comparison-group of nonmaltreated children with low-income families, whereas the diurnal pattern in children in the regular foster care condition
increasingly became abnormally flattened. Fisher and
Stoolmiller [23] showed that these effects appeared to be
partially mediated by the reduction of stress in foster caregivers within the MTFC-P condition.
Together, the first psychophysiological studies on foster
care shed more light on the role that foster parents may
play in changing the developmental pathways of
neglected and maltreated children. Foster parents are not
only important for supporting behavioural regulation but
also for affect regulation, an important principle that can
be traced back to the observations that James and Joyce
Robertson made on the basis of their films of the children
they fostered during short separations from their parents
[39]. Symptoms of disinhibited attachment have to be
taken serious as possible signs that separations and reunions with foster parents may indeed have a qualitatively
different meaning for some foster children, perhaps
because the relationship with foster parents plays a less
central role in the regulation of affect. This possible interpretation is consistent with Porges' idea that children with
attachment disorder are more prone to activate the mobilization system than to activate their social engagement
system to deal with challenges under conditions of relative safety [17]. However, interventions to support foster
parents, even foster parents of hard-to-place children,
show promise for improving psychophysiological regulation in children. This may help to prevent negative outcomes of foster care along a broad array of domains [12].
Psychophysiological outcomes of psychotherapy
Some children with a history of severe disruption or deprivation of attachment develop disorders of attachment.
Several descriptions and criteria for disorders of attachment exist for young children, but consensus is emerging
that there is a small group of children who fail to develop
specific attachment relationships or show behaviours
antithetical to maintaining specific attachments, due to
the pathogenic environment in which they grow up [4,4044]. The most well known distinction is between subtypes
of reactive attachment disorder, also called disorders of
nonattachment [41]. One subtype describes children with
emotionally withdrawn behaviour who strongly inhibit
attachment behaviour in situations which are expected to
elicit seeking or accepting contact with a familiar caregiver. The other subtype describes children with indiscriminate proximity seeking to familiar or unfamiliar
persons, showing a disinhibition of contact seeking

http://www.capmh.com/content/3/1/26

behaviour. Although DSM-IV describes these subtypes as
distinct and mutually exclusive, considerable overlap in
symptoms of these subtypes has been found among institutionalized Romanian children [45]. Disinhibited
attachment was found in a substantial minority of children adopted in the UK out of Romanian orphanages, was
associated with severe mental health problems, and
showed strong persistence within the period between 6
and 11 years of age [4]. Less is known about the course of
the inhibited attachment subtype. These disorders of nonattachment are to be distinguished from forms of insecure
or disorganized attachment, as well as disorder within
specific attachment relationships (attachment disorder
with self-endangering, with inhibition, or with compulsive compliance [41]) or temporary reactions to disruptions of attachment [42].
In addition to the plethora of possible forms in which
attachment may be disordered, considerable debate exists
about the appropriate therapeutic response for these children. Based on the available theoretical and empirical evidence, as well as clinical consensus, Boris and Zeanah
outlined recommendations [40]. After ascertaining safety
for the child, the preferred avenue for treatment is working with the children's parents or regular caregivers, based
on methods that have been proven effective in promoting
security of attachment among parents and children at risk
for insecure attachment [46]. Interventions may be said to
be effective for children with disordered attachment, if
children show that they become able to use the prospective attachment figure as a source of comfort and a secure
base for exploration and learning. In Hofer's [6] terms, the
intervention should establish or re-establish regulatory
processes embedded within child-caregiver relationships,
and in particular regulation of emotional distress. In
terms of Porges' polyvagal theory, intervention is successful when children become more able to use the social
engagement system to deal with challenges in the presence of a familiar caregiver or attachment figure. In order
to test these outcomes, psychophysiological measures
may be an important complement to behaviour observation, in order to provide a window to changes in emotion
regulation and the social engagement system.
Although psychophysiological measures are still being
used sparsely in measuring changes in emotions during
psychotherapy [47], successful examples do exist where
cortisol sampling and cardiography are used to obtain
objective indicators of treatment outcome (because these
data are provided 'blind' to the treatment condition) as
well as insight into the psychotherapeutical process [4850]. We used psychophysiological measures to test the
effects of a psychotherapeutical approach that was specifically designed for non-autistic children with disrupted
attachment histories, severe behaviour problems, and

moderate to severe intellectual and visual disabilities [5153].
There are a small group of children who grow up with a
combination of serious risk factors as well as severe learning difficulties. Due to intensive care needs or vulnerability in the family, not all families are able to adequately
care for their child themselves. Unfortunately, these children are often also difficult to place in foster families. As
a result, some of these children grow up in group homes.
Not only do these children experience instability of placement, but in group homes, they are confronted with multiple caregivers. Due to their intellectual limitations, it
may be difficult for these children to develop selective
attachment relationships with these caregivers. Left to
their own, underdeveloped skills for dealing with stress,
maladaptive forms of coping may develop. This may be
one of the reasons why aggression to self, to others, as well
as extremely withdrawn behaviour may be so heightened
among children with intellectual disabilities [54]. The
problem is that these challenging behaviours require a
high level of caution, tolerance, and experience on the
part of caregivers who may attempt to connect to these
children in a way which may develop into an attachment
relationship. For these reasons, a treatment protocol was
developed, called Integrative Therapy for Attachment and
Behavior (ITAB) [53].
The first phase of treatment is that an experienced and
trained psychotherapist attempts to build an attachment
relationship with the child. The therapist makes verbal
and tactile contact and invites the client to engage in interaction. The interactions typically involve imitation and
play. The therapist is sensitive to signs of resistance or discomfort, and never coerces the child into contact. Gradually the therapists attempts to extend the chains of mutual
responsiveness, introduces variations and games, and uses
soothing responses to facilitate the regulation of the client's affective reactions, which may occur on reunion or at
leave-taking, but which may also occur when the joint
activities generate affective arousal. The therapist will be
watching for evidence of object permanence and person
permanence, because this is important for building up a
representation of the therapist. As soon as the therapist
perceives evidence to this effect (searching, recognition),
the therapist will build on this by introducing games and
activities (peek-a-boo) in which person permanence is
further trained. The therapist will also stimulate and
reward the expression of wishes and desires, in order to
strengthen the representation of a responsive attachment
figure. The first phase consists of three sessions a week,
across a period of six months or longer in order for the client to learn about the therapist and recognize her, and
build up expectations about her responsiveness. After this
phase of building a therapeutic attachment relationship,

http://www.capmh.com/content/3/1/26

the second phase uses this relationship as a secure context
in which the child might be able to learn new adaptive
behaviour to replace the maladaptive problem behaviour.
This is done by analyzing the conditions which continue
to give rise to challenging behaviour, defining appropriate
replacement behaviours, and using positive social reinforcement for training these behaviours. Within the final
phase, the psychotherapist works with the regular caregivers to expand the attachment network of the child. Gradually, the relationship with the psychotherapist moves to
the background.
A controlled multiple case study was conducted with six
children between age 10 and 17 years old with a long history of disrupted attachment and IQs between 20 and 35
Clients were blind or visually impaired according to WHO
criteria. Clients were assigned for this intensive form of
psychotherapy if a documented history showed extensive
disruptions of attachment (early neglect, early institutional placement, placement shifts), challenging behaviour was severe, medical causes for the behaviour were
ruled out, and behavioural interventions with the caregivers or others had failed. Most children lived quite isolated
lives in their group home, because the professional caregivers were hesitant to remain in the vicinity. Only one
child received part-time care from his adoptive parents.
The first question was whether these children would begin
to seek proximity to the therapist in times of stress. A second question was whether having to learn new behaviour
in challenging situations would be more successful with
ITAB, as compared to regular behaviour modification, and
whether clients would show less stress reactivity, in particular in the mobilization system. Sessions with the experimental ITAB therapist alternated with a session with a
control therapist on the same day. During phase 1, the
control therapist was only positively involved towards the
client but did not take the initiative to build a relationship. The length of phase 1 was for the study manipulated
to vary, in order to create a multiple baseline design. During phase 2, this therapist applied the same behaviour
modification protocol as the ITAB therapist for learning
new, more adaptive behaviour in the challenging situation. Each session was videotaped, and coded in random
order by trained observers blind to phase and condition.
During the sessions, ambulatory recording was done of
PEP, to measure reactivity in the sympathetic part of the
ANS and an index of the mobilization system, and RSA, a
parasympathetic indicator and reflective of the social
engagement system. Appropriate controls were used for
artefacts due to locomotion [51].
Using the RSA and PEP data, we identified, within each of
the sessions within phase 1, episodes of heightened sympathetic or parasympathetic arousal and coded the duration and frequency of proximity seeking to the therapist

(ITAB or control). A significant difference was found,
meaning that proximity seeking to the ITAB therapist
increased during periods of heightened arousal, whereas it
remained stably low for the control therapist. This indicated that even after a long history of deprivation, children may cease to inhibit their attachment behaviour and
may start approaching responsive people in their environment in times of stress. However, these findings are inconclusive, because stress was not experimentally induced
[20], which meant that the peak periods of ANS reactivity
may have been caused by stress but also by attention,
excitement, or even metabolic processes.
In the second phase of psychotherapy, however, situations were identified which were presumably challenging
or frustrating because they elicited problem behaviour
(such as biting, scratching, spitting). Session with the
ITAB therapist were expected to provide a better context
for learning alternative, adaptive behaviours to replace
these problem behaviours, than sessions with the control
therapist, because these children might not perceive the
situation as safe with the control therapist. Within Porges'
[17] model, this would lead to reactivity in the mobilization system. Indeed we found that children learned to use
adaptive behaviours more frequently in the sessions with
the ITAB therapist [53]. Furthermore, we found that in
four out of the six children, the therapeutic relationship
with the ITAB therapist prevented the activation of the
mobilization system, because sympathetic reactivity
increased during behaviour modification with the control
therapist but remained stably low during behaviour modification with the ITAB therapist [51]. These findings suggest that for clients who before did not approach
caregivers and appeared indifferent to human contact, the
interaction with a specific person had become a support
for the regulation of physiological reactivity in challenging situations.

Conclusion
Psychobiological theory may be an important complement to theories such as attachment theory to not only
explain the consequences of the complex experiences surrounding disruptions of attachment, but also to identify
mechanisms through which developmental change can be
effected. The relationship between children and foster
parents may contain the 'hidden regulators' that Hofer [6]
proposed as typical for regular attachment relationships,
as shown by the parasympathetic nervous system
responses to separations and reunions [24] and by the
effects of interventions aimed towards improving the
interaction between children and foster parents or therapeutic workers [37,38,51] on physiological indices of
affect regulation. Relationships between children with
disrupted attachment and their caregivers are therefore an
important focus for research on their developmental path-

http://www.capmh.com/content/3/1/26

ways, as well as a focus for support and intervention in
order to promote more adaptive developmental outcomes.
For some children, however, the regulating function of
their relationships with caregivers appears compromised.
Within Porges' theory, this would be the case when situations that would be safe enough for social engagement to
be activated, elicit responses that facilitate mobilization of
resources for fight or flight [7,17]. In his theory, processes
on a subcortical level (e.g., the limbic system) operate
without cognitive awareness in order to distinguish
between situations that are safe, dangerous, or life threatening. Mechanisms that facilitate recognition of visual
and auditory patterns are probably involved in this so
called neuroception of safety and danger [17]. Little is
known about the kinds of experiences that may lead to
aberrant neuroception. Neuroception of danger would
predispose to reactivity of the sympathetic part of the
ANS, called the mobilization system in polyvagal theory,
and would weaken parasympathetic reactivity or vagal
tone. The link found between sympathetic ANS reactivity
and a history of neglect suggests one avenue for further
research. Another relevant finding was the low parasympathetic reactivity during reunion with foster parents by
children showing symptoms of disinhibited disordered
attachment [24]. Clinically, children with disorders of
attachment appear to have pervasive disturbances in
social relatedness and in particular using familiar caregivers as a source of comfort and safety [40], and these disturbances appear to be persistent [4]. Distortions in
neuroception of safety and danger may be one explanation for this persistence, and therefore a potential target
for intervention. Links between disorganized attachment
relationships and sympathetic reactivity on reunion with
the caregiver would in Porges' framework be highly consistent with the interpretation by attachment theorists that
disorganized attachment patterns are the result of the
opposing tendencies engendered by the fear system (fight
or flight) and the attachment system (seek contact) [55].
These direct links have, however, not been found in the
one study that examined this. An further important test of
Porges' theory as well as the theories regarding disorganized attachment would therefore be to investigate the
extent to which sympathetic ANS reactivity on reunion
with caregivers mediates the link between frightening
experiences with these caregivers and disorganized attachment behaviour. Furthermore, Porges' propositions that
neuroception is based on systems for feature and movement detection, localized within the temporal cortex [17]
require the extension of psychophysiological measures
with imaging techniques [13].
Psychobiological perspective and research findings may
also contribute to rational interventions for children with

disrupted attachment histories. These interventions
should not only be effective, but also safe (unlike coercive
treatments that are labelled by their proponents as 'attachment therapies' [56]). If support within children's own
families is not effective or feasible and children have to be
placed out of home, the developmental risks of foster care
show that more is needed than a physically safe family.
Emerging findings have been reviewed which suggested
that well-designed interventions aimed at foster parents
may nudge back psychophysiological parameters within
the normative range. Even for children with intellectual
disabilities, the interactions between behaviour, environment, and psychophysiology appeared malleable by psychotherapy (ITAB) consisting of sensitivity and taking the
time to get to know the child and to allow the child to get
to know the therapist. More research is needed to test
whether specific activities within the ITAB protocol, such
as games with disappearing and returning and making
and breaking contact, might derive their effect by stimulating the experience of familiarity and recognition, stimulating neuroception of safety in Porges' terms.

In any case, psychophysiological measures prove useful
because they demonstrate that intervention not only
change outward behaviour, but hidden physiological
responses change as well. Rather than giving up on the
potential of children severely affected by disruptions of
attachment to participate in mutually fulfilling social relationships, practice may build on the initial findings
reviewed to expand the number of evidence based interventions on offer for this vulnerable group of children.
