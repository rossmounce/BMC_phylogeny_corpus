Endogenous retroviruses in primates

Background
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) have much lower mutation rates than exogenous retroviruses (XRVs), therefore
they are an important tool in analysing the long-term
evolutionary history of retroviruses. Their transmission
patterns also act as useful markers when studying host
phylogenetics.
Recently, the first examples of endogenous lentivirus
were characterised. The earliest was rabbit endogenous
lentivirus type K in the European rabbit [Oryctolagus
cuniculus) [1]. Later, examples in the European brown
hare (Lepus europeaus) [2] and in two species of prosimian primate, the grey mouse lemur(Microcebus murinus) [3] and fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaelus
medius) [4] were discovered. Other ERVs are much
more widespread, particularly gamma- and beta- retroviruses, which are present in many vertebrate species
The aim of this project is to look for and characterise
further examples of primate ERVs and therefore gain
insight into the evolutionary history of retroviruses and
their primate hosts. This will involve data mining of primate genomes for previously unknown ERVs as well as
PCR based screening of genera for which genome
sequences are not available. Preliminary work suggests
that prosimian primate genomes contain previously
unclassified endogenous lentiviruses, so PCR-based
screening will be used with DNA samples from lemurs,
bushbabies and lorises to sequence and characterise
these viruses.
Materials and methods
The bioinformatics analysis component of this project
used Exonerate [5] to perform pairwise sequence comparison between host chromosomes and query retroviral
amino acid sequences. Sequences from the polymerase
(pol), group-specific antigen (gag) and envelope (env)

genes of representative XRVs from all known retroviral
genera were used to identify regions of the host genome
which are highly similar to retroviral genes. We have
validated this method by successfully searching the
human genome for known ERV insertions. Regions of
interest are then extracted and analysed in detail.
The initial laboratory work used primers which act on
a conserved region of the lentiviral pol gene (primers
from [4]) on samples from 17 species of prosimian primate, to look for examples of lentiviral insertions. These
were then sequenced and incorporated into the lentiviral
phylogeny.

Results
Bioinformatics analysis of the low-coverage M. murinus
genome sequence identified 3542 ERV-like regions. This
included 256 regions of less than 10,000 base pairs
which incorporated gag, pol and env-like sequences in
the correct orientation. The subset of pol genes which
were within these 256 proviruses appear to be closely
related to known gamma- and beta-retroviruses from
other species.
Preliminary laboratory work has shown previously
uncharacterised lentiviral insertions in several species of
lemur - Varecia variegata, Eulemur rufus and Mirza
coquereli; the loris Perodictus potto and the bushbaby
Galago moholi, although these insertions are yet to be
further characterised.
Conclusions
Multiple potential ERV sequences have been found in
the M. murinus genome. Preliminary laboratory results
suggest that there are undescribed endogenous lentiviruses in further prosimian primate species. Methodology has been established which can be used to screen
further species for proviral insertions and to explore
these in detail.
