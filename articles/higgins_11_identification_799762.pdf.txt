Identification of Mycobacterium spp. of veterinary
importance using rpoB gene sequencing
James Higgins1*, Patrick Camp1, David Farrell1, Doris Bravo1, Mateja Pate2 and Suelee Robbe-Austerman1

Abstract
Background: Studies conducted on Mycobacterium spp. isolated from human patients indicate that sequencing of
a 711 bp portion of the rpoB gene can be useful in assigning a species identity, particularly for members of the
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Given that MAC are important pathogens in livestock, companion animals,
and zoo/exotic animals, we were interested in evaluating the use of rpoB sequencing for identification of
Mycobacterium isolates of veterinary origin.
Results: A total of 386 isolates, collected over 2008 - June 2011 from 378 animals (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
mammals) underwent PCR and sequencing of a ~ 711 bp portion of the rpoB gene; 310 isolates (80%) were
identified to the species level based on similarity at ≥ 98% with a reference sequence. The remaining 76 isolates
(20%) displayed < 98% similarity with reference sequences and were assigned to a clade based on their location in
a neighbor-joining tree containing reference sequences. For a subset of 236 isolates that received both 16S rRNA
and rpoB sequencing, 167 (70%) displayed a similar species/clade assignation for both sequencing methods. For
the remaining 69 isolates, species/clade identities were different with each sequencing method. Mycobacterium
avium subsp. hominissuis was the species most frequently isolated from specimens from pigs, cervids, companion
animals, cattle, and exotic/zoo animals.
Conclusions: rpoB sequencing proved useful in identifying Mycobacterium isolates of veterinary origin to clade,
species, or subspecies levels, particularly for assemblages (such as the MAC) where 16S rRNA sequencing alone is
not adequate to demarcate these taxa. rpoB sequencing can represent a cost-effective identification tool suitable
for routine use in the veterinary diagnostic laboratory.

Background
Skin and tissue infections caused by Mycobacterium spp.
constitute a significant animal health problem for veterinarians involved in the care of livestock and companion
animals. Of particular concern are the species in the
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). While the taxonomy of the MAC has undergone some revision over
the past decade, currently it is considered to comprise
M. avium subsp. avium, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, M. avium subsp. hominissuis, M. avium subsp. silvaticum, M. intracellulare, M. chimaera, M.
colombiense, M. arosiense, and M. vulneris [1-5].
Recently Ben Salah et al [6] designated three new species isolated from clinical cases in southern France,

Mycobacterium marseillense, Mycobacterium timonense,
and Mycobacterium bouchedurhonense, as members of
the MAC.
While 16S rRNA sequencing has some utility for identifying species of Mycobacterium, some subspecies/species within the MAC share identical 16S rRNA
sequences and thus cannot be differentiated using this
locus [7]. Accordingly, a variety of alternate targets have
been investigated for use in differentiating MAC species.
One of the better characterized targets for bacteria,
including Mycobacterium, is the RNA polymerase bsubunit (rpoB) gene [8]. Initial efforts in using the rpoB
gene as a target for PCR and sequencing-based differentiation among Mycobacterium spp. were reported by
Kim et al. [9,10]. Further studies describing the use of
this locus by Adekambi et al. [11] and Adekambi and
Drancourt [12] established the presence of multiple

nucleotide polymorphisms in the full-length rpoB gene
sequence among mycobacteria.
Ben Salah et al. [13] identified a 711-bp region of the
rpoB gene harboring the greatest number of such polymorphisms, and used sequences from this region to
investigate a panel of 100 clinical isolates provisionally
assigned as MAC. These authors reported successfully
assigning 93 of the isolates to a species/subspecies classification. Simmon et al. [14] used simultaneous sequencing of rpoB and 16S rRNA loci to identify clinical
isolates of Mycobacterium; of 139 isolates, 117 (84%)
were identified to the species level. More recently,
Whang et al. [15] used a combination of rpoB PCR, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism, to
identify members of the MAC among 185 isolates,
including 68 samples of ruminant origin.
The majority of published studies on the use of rpoB
sequencing to identify mycobacteria have been conducted on panels of clinical (i.e., human medicine) isolates, and limited collections of animal isolates.
Accordingly, we were interested in evaluating the protocol of Ben Salah et al. [13] for the identification of a
large number of isolates originating from a variety of
animal species. We were particularly interested in the
ability of the rpoB sequence to differentiate between M.
avium subsp. avium, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis,
and M. avium subsp. hominissuis, as these are prominent pathogens of veterinary importance. Here, we
report the results of our investigation into the use of
rpoB sequencing to characterize 386 isolates generated
from submissions to the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL) from companion animals, livestock,
feral animals, and zoo animals.

Results
rpoB gene identification of veterinary isolates

A total of 386 isolates, collected over 2008 - June 2011
from 378 animals (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) underwent PCR and sequencing of a ~ 730 bp
portion of the rpoB gene; 310 isolates (80%) were identified to the species level based on similarity at ≥ 98%
with a reference sequence. The remaining 76 isolates
(20%) displayed < 98% similarity with reference
sequences and were assigned to a clade based on their
location in a neighbor-joining tree containing reference
sequences. The two most frequently encountered clades
within the MAC included the clade containing M.
avium subsp. avium, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis,
M. avium subsp. silvaticum, and M. avium subsp. hominissuis; and the clade containing M. intracellulare, M.
chimaera, and M. indicus pranii.
For a subset of 236 isolates that received both 16S
rRNA and rpoB sequencing, 167 (70%) displayed a similar species/clade assignation for both sequencing

methods. For the remaining 69 isolates, species/clade
identities were different with each sequencing method
(this information is provided in Additional file 1).
rpoB gene sequence of M. avium subsp. silvaticum ATCC
49884

We observed that two separate lots of the M. avium
subsp. silvaticum type strain ATCC 49884, one lot purchased from that company prior to 2008, and the other
in Spring 2011, yielded rpoB sequence with nucleotide
2, 541 (using the M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis
rpoB K10 strain numbering convention) as a cytosine,
rather than the thymine present in the existing GenBank
deposition for M. avium subsp. silvaticum ATCC 49884
[GenBank: EF521905]. The electropherograms for this
portion of the rpoB sequence displayed satisfactory peak
height (Additional file 2), indicating that the cytosine
call was not an artifact of sequencing chemistry. Subsequently, Ion Torrent - based genomic sequencing of the
ATCC 49884 strain by another laboratory also displayed
a cytosine residue rather than a thymine residue (C.
O’Connell, Life Technologies, personal communication).
We have deposited our rpoB sequence of M. avium
subsp. silvaticum ATCC 49884 in GenBank [GenBank:
JN935808].
Use of rpoB sequencing to identify Mycobacterium spp. in
selected cohorts of animals

In order to facilitate understanding of the mycobacterial
diversity in given host groups, we have chosen to present phylogenetic data documenting the use of the rpoB
sequence to assist with the characterization of Mycobacterium spp. in representative cohorts of animals. Note
that, to keep our phylogenetic trees to a manageable
size, all 386 isolates are not presented in the trees;
rather, we focused on incorporating those isolates that
best represented the breadth of taxa recovered from the
animal groups under study.
Figure 1 shows the identities of Mycobacterium spp.
recovered from the lymph nodes (head, thorax, or
abdomen) of 33 domestic and feral pigs in the U.S.
Interestingly, all isolates recovered from domestic pigs
(n = 19) demonstrated ≥ 99% similarity with MAC,
with n = 16 of these showing 100% similarity to M.
avium subsp. hominissuis. In contrast, only one (isolate
10-8388) of 16 isolates obtained from feral swine
(trapped in Brooks, Duval, Kenedy, Maverick, and
Zapata Counties, Texas) displayed 100% similarity with
M. avium subsp. hominissuis. The remaining 15 feral
swine isolates showed considerable diversity in terms
of identities with Mycobacterium spp. in GenBank. M.
arosiense represented the most closely related taxa
(Figure 1) for three isolates (96% similarity with Nos.
10-7413, 10-7412, and 10-9360), while other feral pig

has been documented as a cause of soft tissue infection

the U.S. The majority (n = 39) of isolates clustered
among the MAC, with 19 (45%) possessing 100% identity with M. avium subsp. hominissuis. Other of the
MAC isolates clustered within the clade containing M.
intracellulare, M. indicus pranii, and M. chimaera, with
similarities of 99%. One of the non-MAC isolates displayed similarity to M. palustre (99% with 09-10192),
while the other two (10-4743 and 09-8223) possessed
99% similarity with Rhodococcus equi. Indeed, we
observed a total of four bovine isolates of putative
Mycobacterium spp. that were actually R. equi by rpoB
sequencing; to our knowledge, amplification of this species by the Myco-F and Myco-R rpoB primers has not
previously been reported. In our experience, isolation of
this organism from cattle head and thoracic tissue granulomas is not unusual.
Figure 5 displays the identities of 22 isolates recovered
from lymph nodes, oropharyngeal washings, and skin
lesions from zoo/exotic animals from the U.S. [The
bongo, Tragelaphus eurycerus eurycerus, is a large African antelope, while the gerenuk, Litocranius walleri, is a
variety of East African gazelle]. As with the other
cohorts in our study, M. avium subsp. hominissuis constituted the most frequently isolated species (n = 5 isolates, or 22%). One isolate displayed ≥ 99% similarity
with the rpoB sequence for M. marseillense, a strain
recovered from a wallaby (10-7489). Interestingly, two
gerenuks from zoos in Florida and Missouri both provided cultures (10-7818 and 10-7837) which displayed <
97% similarity with any reference species. An isolate
from a spider monkey (10-7992) from a zoo in Texas
displayed 100% similarity with M. kansasii, while an isolate from a tapir showed closest similarity (100%) with
an unnamed Mycobacterium species (NLA001000736)
identified in sputum from a patient in Uruguay.
For reptile/amphibian isolates, one from a snake
(Gabon viper, 10-7089) displayed 99% similarity with M.
conceptionense; a fire belly toad isolate (11-4803) displayed 99% similarity with the M. immunogenum cluster, while a blue dart frog isolate (11-3450) displayed
99% similarity to the rpoB sequence from M. ulcerans
and M. marinum.
Space considerations precluded us from including a

Characterization of novel isolates in the M. avium subsp.
paratuberculosis clade

Over the course of the project we identified 12 isolates
which clustered in the clade containing M. avium subsp.
avium, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, M. avium

subsp. silvaticum and M. avium subsp. hominissuis,
while not displaying 100% identity with the rpoB
sequence for any of these taxa (Figure 6). The host animals included cattle, a deer, an elk, pigs, and a cat, and
were cultured from submissions made during 2009 2010. All evidenced ≥ 99.3% similarity with the abovementioned members of this MAC ‘sub-clade’ (Table 1);
all possessed nucleotide substitutions in the third position of the codon, and all possessed satisfactory peaks
for their electropherograms, suggesting that the substitutions were not sequencing artifacts.
These novel MAC isolates were queried via PCR for
the insertion elements IS900 (considered to be diagnostic for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis), IS901 (considered to be diagnostic for M. avium subsp. avium),
IS1245 (considered to be diagnostic for a number of
MAC subspecies), and DT1 (considered to be diagnostic
for M. avium subsp. avium and M. intracellulare)
[19-21]. Results of these PCR assays are provided in
Table 2. All isolates were IS900 negative and DT1 negative, and all but one isolate (No. 10-0824, cow) were
positive for both IS1245 PCR assays.
Interestingly, this isolate, No. 10-0824, was positive for
the IS901 element. BLAST analysis of 733 nucleotides
sequenced from this PCR product showed 99% similarity
with [Genbank: AB447556], the M. avium subsp. hominissuis ISMav6 gene, and 96% similarity with [GenBank:
X58030] and [GenBank: AF527973], the M. avium
subsp. avium insertion elements 902 and 901, respectively. Although this same isolate was negative for both
IS1245 PCR assays, it should be noted that the absence
of this element has been documented in some isolates
of M. avium subsp. avium [22].

Discussion
In our hands, the rpoB PCR assay readily generated
amplicons from > 99% of isolates tested, and produced
quality sequences for > 95% of those isolates.
When both 16S rRNA and rpoB sequencing were
performed on a subset of 236 isolates, the percentage
of identities matching at the species or clade level
with both methods was 70%, a figure lower than that
(86%) reported by Simmon et al. [14] in their combined sequencing analysis of clinical isolates. The
greater degree of discrepancy in our panel may be
attributed to the dearth of longer-length (i.e., ≥ 711
bp) rpoB sequences in GenBank for type specimens of
M. bohemicum, M. asiaticum, M. obuense, etc. As
well, we obtain 16S rRNA identities for our Mycobacterium isolates using the Ridom database, which compares ≤ 450 bp of sequence; use of this smaller
segment of the 16S rRNA gene may contribute to discrepant results between the assignations with 16S
rRNA and rpoB. We have noticed that when we use

the ISO17025 standards governing the operation of
our laboratory.
Additionally, some of the isolates for which rpoB similarities were < 98% with reference sequences may (arguably) represent new species. We note that anecdotally,
the descriptions of new species of veterinary origin have
tended to lag behind those of human origin, which may
contribute to the ambiguity surrounding assignations of
identities to some of the isolates in our panel. As we
expand the use of rpoB sequencing in our laboratory,
we intend to continue adding sequences of ≥ 711 bp
from (currently unrepresented) species and veterinary
isolates to GenBank, as this will improve the ability of
this locus, and assays derived from it, such as the RipSeq assay [14], to identify mycobacterial species.
A weakness of the combined use of 16S rRNA and
rpoB sequences for species assignation is that some
clades of Mycobacterium may not be partitioned to species level via the combined use of these two loci. For
example, Zelazny et al. [23] examined 42 clinical isolates
belonging to the M. abscessus group and observed that
rpoB sequencing parsed this collection into 33 M.
abscessus isolates, 7 M. massiliense isolates, and 2 M.
bolletii isolates. The inclusion of additional sequence
data from the secA and hsp65 genes resulted in the
assignation of 26 M. abscessus isolates, 7 M. massiliense

isolates, and 2 M. bolletii isolates; the remaining 7 isolates ultimately were assigned to M. massiliense via use
of ITS sequencing. While the use of multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) incorporating loci such as
hsp65 and secA undoubtedly would aid in the more
accurate identification of isolates, the current economics
of veterinary diagnostic testing rule against routine use
of MLST in our laboratory.
Our evaluation of rpoB sequencing indicated that it
will be of particular value in assigning species designations to members of the MAC. Of the 386 isolates for
which rpoB sequence was obtained, 184 (47%) were
members of the MAC, and the most frequently isolated
species was M. hominissuis (60 isolates, 15%). Similar to
the results of Ben Salah et al. [13], who observed that
M. avium subsp. hominissuis constituted the major
MAC member in their panel of 100 clinical isolates, this
subspecies was the predominant MAC isolated from all
animals in our study. The cosmopolitan distribution of
M. avium subsp. hominissuis observed among our panel
of host animals suggests that this subspecies may be
responsible for a substantial proportion of mycobacterial
disease among livestock, companion animals, and zoo/
exotic animals.
For feral swine isolates, non-MAC species dominated
the assemblage, including novel environmental species
such as Mycobacterium sp. JLS/KMS, suggesting that
these animals are exposed to a variety of mycobacterial
taxa in the course of foraging for food in the forest litter
and pasture land. Also noteworthy is the observation
that 8 feral pig isolates displayed < 97% similarity with
existing GenBank accessions, suggesting that some of
these isolates may represent new species. The implications for transmission of these mycobacteria to cattle or
domestic pigs, with whom feral pigs often come into
contact, are unclear, but in light of the fact that feral
swine may harbor important veterinary pathogens (such
as Brucella spp.), further investigation may be warranted
[24,25].
M. marseillense, M. timonense, and M. bouchedurhonense are recently described members of the MAC; all
three species were originally recovered from patients in
southern France. In their survey of 139 clinical isolates
of U.S. origin, Simmon et al. [14] observed two isolates
with rpoB sequence similarity to that of M. timonense
and M. bouchedurhonense. We observed two elephant
and one feral pig (all three animals located in Texas)
isolates with 96 - 97% similarity to the rpoB sequence
for M. bouchedurhonense. Isolates from an elephant
(eastern United States), a wallaby (location data not
available), and a domestic cat (location unavailable) displayed 99 - 100% similarity to M. marseillense. While
the precise location at which the infection was acquired
by the host animal obviously cannot be determined with

Higgins et al. BMC Veterinary Research 2011, 7:77
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/7/77

certainty, these findings do expand the categories of
host animal and geographic locales for these species.
For other members of the MAC, a number of cattle,
pig, and cervid isolates segregated into the clade containing M. chimaera and M. intracellulare. However, we
did not observe any isolates with rpoB sequences with >
98% similarity with M. colombiense. Regarding M.
avium subsp. silvaticum, the latter species has not been
encountered in diagnostic submissions to the NVSL,
suggesting that it does not represent a significant source
of morbidity or mortality in some groups of animals and
birds. However, we have no record of receiving wood
pigeons over the past decade, during which we received
100 - 200 avian specimens each year. Our analysis of M.
avium subsp. silvaticum indicates that, at least for the
ATCC 49884 strain, differentiating it from M. avium
subsp. avium may not be possible based on the rpoB
sequence amplified with the Myco-F and Myco-R primer set.
M. avium subsp. silvaticum reportedly has a variable
biochemical requirement for mycobactin J, consequently
NVSL uses a media protocol involving formulations
with and without mycobactin J for all avian submissions,
so dependency on this reagent would be recognized.
Accordingly, despite the identical rpoB sequence for M.
avium subsp. silvaticum and M. avium subsp. avium,
we have some degree of confidence in our ability to
recognize M. avium subsp. silvaticum in our laboratory.
We anticipate that the phylogenetic and taxonomic status of M. avium subsp. silvaticum ATCC 49884, as a
member of the MAC, will be clarified by ongoing genomic sequencing efforts (C. O’Connell, Life Technologies,
personal communication).
We identified 12 isolates from cattle, cervids, pigs, and
a cat that clustered with the clade containing M. avium
subsp. avium, M. avium subsp. silvaticum, M. avium
subsp. paratuberculosis, and M. avium subsp. hominissuis; however, these isolates did not display 100% similarity with any of these subspecies.
The implications of this observation for diagnostic purposes are unclear. M. avium subsp. avium and M. avium
subsp. paratuberculosis are important livestock and companion animal pathogens that are tested for on a routine
basis by veterinary diagnostic laboratories, using commercial real-time and conventional PCR assays designed
to target insertion elements considered to be unique to
the individual subspecies [26]. Our evaluation of the
insertion element profiles (i.e., IS900, IS901, DT1, and
IS1245) for these novel MAC isolates indicates that they
display some heterogeneity in this regard, making assignation to a defined subspecies problematic. We are pursuing more detailed genetic analyses of these isolates (i.e.,
genomic sequencing) in order to better characterize their
taxonomic position within the MAC.

Page 11 of 14

Currently, standard operating procedures in our
laboratory for identification of rapid- and slow- growing
Mycobacterium involve selected Gen-probe® assays, in
conjunction with traditional biochemical tests and 16S
rRNA sequencing. Given that 16S rRNA sequences are
identical among M. avium subsp. avium, M. avium
subsp. paratuberculosis, M. avium subsp. silvaticum,
and M. avium subsp. hominissuis , resolution to the
subspecies level has not been feasible, and thus cases
associated with these agents historically have been
reported to clients as ‘M. avium complex’. Our study
demonstrates the utility of rpoB PCR and sequencing
for identification of subspecies within the MAC, and
other species of mycobacteria, derived from veterinary
specimens.

Conclusions
Our panel of 386 veterinary isolates represents the most
comprehensive such collection yet used to evaluate rpoB
sequencing as a method of identification to species and/
or clade level. Our study confirms observations made
from studies performed on human isolates, namely, that
rpoB sequencing can aid in the identification of Mycobacterium spp. to the clade or species level. This is particularly true for species belonging to the MAC, which
continues to represent a major lineage associated with
infections in a variety of livestock and companion animals. We note the some mycobacterial assemblages, as
the M. abscessus group, require additional loci/MLST
for adequate resolution, as a combination of 16S rRNA
and rpoB sequencing alone is inadequate to assign a
species identity. Accordingly, the use of 16S rRNA and
rpoB sequencing necessarily presents with some limitations. However, in the current context of veterinary
diagnostics, the use of 16S rRNA and rpoB sequencing
represents an affordable and cost-effective paradigm for
species identification, particularly when compared to
methods such as culture- and biochemical- based assays.
Methods
Mycobacterial strains

Isolates were cultured from specimens submitted to the
Mycobacteria and Brucella Section, NVSL in Ames,
Iowa, during 2008 - May 2011. Specimens included tissue samples, which were externally decontaminated
using a sodium hypochlorite/sodium hydroxide-based
procedure [27], oropharyngeal swabs, and swabs of skin
lesions. Media used for isolation included customized
formulations made at the NVSL: 7H11 agar with hemolyzed blood, serum, OADC (oleic acid-albumin-dextrose- catalase) and pyruvate; 7H10 agar with OADC
and pyruvate; Stonebrinks media; Lowenstine-Jensen
media (Becton Dickson, Sparks, Maryland, USA), Bactec
460 and Bactec MGIT 960 liquid culture media (Becton

Higgins et al. BMC Veterinary Research 2011, 7:77
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/7/77

Dickson, Sparks, Maryland, USA); Herrold egg yolk agar,
and the ESP II liquid culture system (TREK Diagnostic
Systems, Cleveland, OH) [28].
Genomic DNA was extracted by placing a loopful of
cells, or the cell pellet derived from ~ 100 μl of turbid
liquid media, into a 2.0 ml tube containing 300 μl phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, 300 μl Tris-EDTA buffer, and 200 μl 0.1 mm silica beads. The contents were
mixed and the tube subjected to rotation on a specialized instrument (Mini-Beadbeater, BioSpec Products,
Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA) at maximum setting for 90
sec. Following lysis, the bead tube was centrifuged at 16,
000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant removed and
transferred to a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and the DNA
precipitated using ethanol and 3M sodium acetate. DNA
was reconstituted in 300 μl TE buffer, or molecular biology grade water, and stored at -70°C, with 2 μl used as
template for PCR (below). Extraction controls, consisting of sterile water, were included with all extraction
procedures.
PCR and sequencing

For 16S rRNA PCR and sequencing, genomic DNA was
amplified using primer 27 (forward) and 907 (reverse)
which amplify a ~ 909 bp portion of the 16s rRNA gene
[29]. Initial amplification conditions were: 95°C for 5
min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 45 sec, 53°C for
60 sec, and 72°C for 90 sec and a single 10 min elongation step at 72°C. Negative PCR controls included reactions containing 5 μl water as template. The PCR
amplicons were treated with ExoSap-IT (USB/Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and subjected to dye terminator cycle sequencing using two primer pairs, 271
forward and 519 reverse; and 27 forward and 519
reverse [29,30]. Sequencing products were treated with
BigDye XTerminator purification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and electrophoresed on an
Applied Biosystems 3500XL genetic analyzer. Consensus
sequences (constituting ~ 450 bp at the 5’ end of the
16S rRNA gene) were assembled using Lasergene® software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) and submitted to the
Ridom 16S rDNA website http://www.ridom.com. Assignation to species level was done for sequences with
similarities of ≥ 99% with entries in the Ridom database,
while sequences with < 99% similarity were assigned
complex (i.e., MAC) or clade-level identities.
For rpoB PCR and sequencing, the protocol of Ben
Salah et al. [13] was used. Briefly, genomic DNA was
amplified using the Myco-F (5’ GGCAAGGTCACCCCGAAGGG 3’; base positions 2479-2498 with reference
to the M. paratuberculosis K-10 rpoB sequence) and
Myco-R (5’ AGCGGCTGCTGGGTGATCATC 3’; base
positions 3219-3239) primers, which amplify a ~ 760 bp
portion of the rpoB gene. PCR reactions consisted of 3 -

Page 12 of 14

5 μl (equivalent to 10 - 20 ng) DNA, 5 μl 10× buffer
and 1 U Taq polymerase (AmpliTaq ® Gold, Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 2.5 μl 25 mM MgCl2, and
50 pmol each primer, in a total volume of 50 μl.
Sequencing reaction conditions were the same as those
described above for 16S rRNA sequencing. Resultant
rpoB sequences (~ 730 bp) were analyzed using MEGA
version 5.0 software [31]. Neighbor-joining trees were
constructed from 1000 bootstrap replicates of each
alignment from distances estimated using the JukesCantor method as implemented in MEGA, with values >
75% considered to be significant. As per the recommendation of Adekambi et al. [11,12] sequences with similarities of ≥ 98% with reference sequences in GenBank
were identified to species. Sequences at < 98% similarity
were identified to clade level (for example, the M. intracellulare /M. chimaera /M. indicus pranii clade) based
on their placement with reference sequences in the
neighbor-joining tree.
Differentiation among members of the MAC clade
containing M. avium subsp. avium, M. avium subsp.
paratuberculosis, M. avium subsp. hominissuis, and M.
avium subsp. silvaticum was done on the presence of
the following nucleotide polymorphisms (using the
numbering scheme for the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis K10 strain rpoB gene [GenBank: NC_002944]
[32]: nucleotide 2, 541: T/C for M. avium subsp. silvaticum, C for the other three subspecies; nucleotide 2, 724:
T for M. avium subsp. hominissuis, C for the other
three subspecies; nucleotide 2, 790: A for M. avium
subsp. paratuberculosis, G for the other three subspecies; nucleotide 2, 898: C for M. avium subsp. hominissuis and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, G for M.
avium subsp. avium and M. avium subsp. silvaticum.
Insertion element PCR

Two sets of primers were used for the IS1245 insertion
element: the ‘long’ P1 and P2 primers which amplify a
427 bp fragment [33], and the ‘short’ P40 and P41 primers which amplify a 175 bp fragment [20]. Neither the
long primer pair nor the short primer pair have been
reported to amplify M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis,
although the short primer pair will amplify M. avium
subsp. hominissuis, M. avium subsp. avium and M.
avium subsp. silvaticum [20] (M. Pateja, unpublished
data). The protocol of Kim et al. [26], using the P2
probe and the F3/R3 primer set, was used for the IS900
PCR; this insertion element is considered to be unique
to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. The IS901 and
DT1 PCR assays used the primers of Shin et al. [21]; the
former insertion element is considered to be unique to
M. avium subsp. avium, while the latter element is present in both M. avium subsp. avium and M. intracellulare. Insertion element PCR reactions and thermal

cycling conditions were performed according to the protocols provided in the above publications.
Internal validation of rpoB sequencing

A panel of 14 M. avium subsp. hominissuis isolates (8
isolated from pigs and 6 from humans) of Central European origin was used as an external validation of the
rpoB sequencing assay. These isolates had been identified on the basis of biochemical characteristics, IS1245
RFLP, IS901 PCR, and MIRU/VNTR [34,35]. All 14 isolates generated rpoB sequences that were 100% similar
to the GenBank reference sequence for M. avium subsp.
hominissuis [GenBank: EF521911].
To confirm the stability of the nucleotide polymorphisms in the rpoB sequence used to assign species identity, an isolate of M. paratuberculosis K10 strain that
had been cultured for 8 consecutive passages was subjected to DNA extraction and rpoB sequencing for each
of the passages. All passages displayed 100% similarity
with the reference sequence for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis [GenBank: EF521906].
To confirm the reproducibility of sequences generated
from given isolates using different instruments, different
lots of reagents, and different aliquots of genomic DNA,
a panel of 7 M. avium subsp. hominissuis, one M.
avium subsp. paratuberculosis, one M. avium subsp.
avium, and one M. conceptionense isolate were
sequenced using an ABI 3130 instrument, and then 4 8 weeks later, sequenced again using an ABI 3500 XL
instrument. All 10 isolates displayed 100% similarity
between the first and second replicates.
