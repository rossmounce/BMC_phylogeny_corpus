Comprehensive profiling of zebrafish hepatic
proximal promoter CpG island methylation and
its modification during chemical carcinogenesis
Leda Mirbahai1*, Timothy D Williams1, Huiqing Zhan2, Zhiyuan Gong2, J Kevin Chipman1

Abstract
Background: DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism associated with regulation of gene expression and it is
modulated during chemical carcinogenesis. The zebrafish is increasingly employed as a human disease model;
however there is a lack of information on DNA methylation in zebrafish and during fish tumorigenesis.
Results: A novel CpG island tiling array containing 44,000 probes, in combination with immunoprecipitation of
methylated DNA, was used to achieve the first comprehensive methylation profiling of normal adult zebrafish liver.
DNA methylation alterations were detected in zebrafish liver tumors induced by the environmental carcinogen 7,
12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene. Genes significantly hypomethylated in tumors were associated particularly with
proliferation, glycolysis, transcription, cell cycle, apoptosis, growth and metastasis. Hypermethylated genes included
those associated with anti-angiogenesis and cellular adhesion. Of 49 genes that were altered in expression within
tumors, and which also had appropriate CpG islands and were co-represented on the tiling array, approximately
45% showed significant changes in both gene expression and methylation.
Conclusion: The functional pathways containing differentially methylated genes in zebrafish hepatocellular
carcinoma have also been reported to be aberrantly methylated during tumorigenesis in humans. These findings
increase the confidence in the use of zebrafish as a model for human cancer in addition to providing the first
comprehensive mapping of DNA methylation in the normal adult zebrafish liver.

Background
Tumorigenesis by chemical carcinogens is a multistep
process [1] with accumulation of both mutations and
epigenetic aberrations in regulatory regions of genes and
disruption of cellular signaling pathways [2,3]. In particular, DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is an
important component of epigenetic gene expression regulation [4], resulting in modulation of protein-DNA
interactions [5,6]. Aberrant methylation of CpG islands
(CGI) in the promoter and exonic regions [7,8], and
changes in gene expression, have been associated with
tumorigenesis [7,9,10]. Global hypomethylation occurs
in most human tumors [3,4,7] leading to potential activation of imprinted genes, parasite sequences and oncogenes and increased chromosome instability [3]. In

addition, hypermethylation of genes associated with
negative regulation of tumorigenesis, such as tumor suppressor genes (TSG), DNA repair genes, and anti-angiogenic genes, is a common and key characteristic of
neoplastic cells [4,10-13]. Furthermore, a range of
rodent carcinogens alter methylation status contributing
to the carcinogenic mechanisms [14].
Fish have been used as models to study tumors
induced by environmental carcinogens. For example,
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) [15], zebrafish
(Danio rerio) [16], guppy (Poecilia reticulata) [17], platyfish (Xiphophorus sp.) [18] and medaka (Oryzias latipes)
[17] have been employed in carcinogen bioassays. Zebrafish is a particularly well established model for investigating embryogenesis, organogenesis, environmental
carcinogenesis and for modeling human diseases such as
cancer [15,19-23]. Chemically-induced tumors in zebrafish and tumors in humans are histopathologically very
similar [20,24] and orthologous TSGs and oncogenes in

human and fish have been identified [20]. Recent studies
comparing hepatic gene expression in human and zebrafish tumors demonstrated conservation of gene expression profiles at different stages of tumor aggressiveness
between these two phylogenetically distant species [23].
However, the contribution of altered methylation to
such changes is unknown.
Although there are reports on global levels of methylation during embryogenesis or in adults [25-27], effect
of temperature on global levels of methylation [28]
methylation profiling in zebrafish embryo [29] and role
of chromatin mediated gene regulation during embryogenesis [19], to our knowledge no study has been published on the DNA methylation patterns or methylation
changes associated with carcinogenesis in adult zebrafish. Therefore, the aims of the study were to achieve a
comprehensive mapping of zebrafish hepatic proximal
promoter CGI methylation in both normal liver and in
chemically induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
tumors. We aimed to determine if there was a linkage
between methylation and the observed changes in the
zebrafish HCC gene expression, and to compare biological pathways represented by altered gene methylation in
zebrafish HCC with pathways commonly altered in
human HCC.
To our knowledge this paper is the first to describe
methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) in combination with a CGI zebrafish tiling array for establishing
normal and HCC methylation profiles in the liver of any
adult fish species. This microarray, in combination with
well-established methylation immunoprecipitation,
serves as a powerful tool for elucidating comprehensive
methylation profiles. To further validate the data derived
from the tiling array, bisulfite sequencing PCR was used.

Results
Global measurement of DNA methylation

To establish the global level of cytosine methylation in
zebrafish liver in comparison to mammals, reversephase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
was performed (Figure 1A). Absence of RNA contamination was confirmed using uracil as a reference material. As shown in Figure 1B, zebrafish liver has a
statistically significant 2.14 fold higher methylation level
(p-value <0.01) than that of calf (Bos taurus) thymus.
This is in agreement with previous published data showing higher levels of DNA methylation in fish compared
to mammals [27].
Unbiased enrichment of methylated DNA using methylDNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)

To optimize and test the specificity of the immunoprecipitation method, CGI regions of 14 genes (15 regions)
located 1.5 kb upstream to 1 kb downstream of

Page 2 of 16

transcriptional start sites (TSS) were screened for
methylation of cytosine using bisulfite sequencing PCR
(Additional file 1, Table S1). Following bisulfite treatment and sequencing of the 14 genes, CGIs located at
the promoter region of the “no-tail“ (ntla) gene were
found to be completely methylated while the remaining
13 genes, including glutathione S- transferase P1 (gstp1),
were completely un-methylated (Additional file 2,
Figures S1 and S2). The no-tail gene and the glutathione
S-transferase P1 gene were thus used as fully methylated
(positive control) and un-methylated (negative control)
DNA regions for validating the immunoprecipitation
enrichment method.
DNA was immunoprecipitated and bisulfite-treated.
Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated, bisulfite-treated
DNA were amplified for the two genes of interest. The
gel images achieved indicated a clear enrichment of
methylated ntla gene in comparison to un-methylated
glutathione S-transferase P1 using 5-methyl cytosine
antibody (the primers used and the regions amplified
are shown in Additional file 3, Table S1 and the gel
electrophoresis image is shown in Additional file 4,
Figure S1).
Design of CGI (1.5 kb upstream to 1 kb downstream of
TSS) zebrafish tiling array and comprehensive mapping of
adult zebrafish liver

Probes (43,960) were designed to cover the CGIs located
1.5 kb upstream to 1 kb downstream of the TSS of 6,024
genes. A list of genes with predicted CGIs, number of
CGIs for each chromosome and location on the chromosome are presented in Additional file 5, Table S1. Where
possible, 60-mer probes were tiled over the CGIs with 25
bp spacing, covering the entire region (Figure 2). The
negative control consisted of PCR amplified genomic
DNA, immunoprecipitated and labeled with Cy-5. As
methylation is removed during amplification little DNA
was precipitated as expected. A uniform low intensity
signal was measured for all probes represented on the
array (Additional file 6, Table S1) representing nonspecific binding of DNA to the 5-methylcytosine antibody. The positive control was achieved by treatment
of DNA with CpG methyltransferase (Sss I) in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) prior to MeDIP.
This resulted in complete methylation of all CGIs and
detection of a uniformly high fluorescent signal for all
probes (Additional file 6, Table S1). Using our CGI tiling array we achieved a comprehensive mapping of the
DNA methylation at CGIs in adult zebrafish liver at
the 1.5 kb upstream to 1 kb downstream of gene TSS.
The list of all genes on the tiling array and their
methylation levels are presented in Additional file 6,
Table S4. Those genes with values 2 fold above the
median level (higher methylation) and 2 fold below the

median level (lower methylation) in control are highlighted. Gene ontology analysis using Blast2GO identified GO terms significantly (False Discovery Rate
(FDR) <5%) over-represented amongst lower- and
higher-methylated genes in control samples. For lower
methylated genes, the GO terms were related particularly to involvement in hormone secretion, cellular
response to hormone stimulation, regulation of transcription, sex determination (dmrt), and regulation of
apoptosis (Figure 3). Higher methylated genes included
those involved in molecular transducer activity and the
connexin complex (Figure 4).
Methylation analysis of zebrafish hepatocellular
carcinoma and comparison to gene expression

DNA extracted from zebrafish HCC was processed by
MeDIP, labeled with fluorescent Cy5-dCTP and hybridized to the tiling array against input genomic DNA.
Following quality checks and normalization, probes were
mapped onto the chromosomes and two lists, containing
hypomethylated and hypermethylated regions in comparison to control, were generated (fold change >1.5,
p-value <0.05). It was apparent that most differentially
methylated regions in HCC were hypomethylated (712
probes) in comparison to 168 hypermethylated regions.
Examples of genes relevant to cancer that contained
aberrant methylation are shown in Table 1 (the full list
of genes and gene ontology analyses are presented in
Additional file 6, Tables S2 and S3). Using a principal
components analysis (PCA) scores plot of differentially
methylated regions, the four groups of HCC, controls,
positive and negative control were separated based on
treatment along the PC1 and PC2 axes (Figure 5). Gene
ontology analysis using Blast2GO was carried out to
find changes in GO term representation in lists of hypomethylated and hypermethylated genes. Functionally
related genes with statistically significant differential
methylation between tumors and controls are presented
in Figure 6 (False Discovery Rate (FDR) <10%).
In addition to Blast2GO, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA) was performed to characterize the functional relationships between genes that were altered in methylation in tumors compared to control. Figure 7 illustrates
hypomethylated genes in zebrafish tumors (fold change
>1.5) related to the canonical pathway “molecular
mechanisms of cancer” in humans these included c-jun,
shc and p21.
IPA identified significant networks, top functions and
canonical pathways associated with the differentially
methylated genes for each comparison analyzed. Significantly over represented (FDR <5%) categories of functions for both hypo- and hyper-methylated genes in
zebrafish HCC are shown in Additional file 7, tables S1
and S2.

In a previous study [23], gene expression changes in
zebrafish HCC produced by the same chemical treatment were profiled. We used data from this study to
compare alteration in gene expression with DNA
methylation in HCC samples. Comparisons are limited
to the genes represented on both the expression array
and the CGI tiling array. Expression of 194 genes that
significantly differed between healthy and zebrafish
HCC were investigated for methylation. From the 194
genes with altered gene expression, 68 genes had CGIs
at the 1.5 kb upstream to 1 kb downstream of TSS.
Due to the criteria used for designing probes, only 49
genes from the previously identified 68 genes were
represented on the tiling array and were investigated for
comparison of DNA methylation level with gene expression. In total 22 genes were identified showing both significantly altered transcription and methylation (> 1.5
fold change) in zebrafish HCC (Table 2, A full list of
the 194 genes investigated is presented in Additional
file 8, Table S1). Most genes identified were hypomethylated with up-regulated gene expression, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (mapk1), cell division
protein kinase 8 (cdk8), RAB2A, member ras oncogene
family (rab2) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(pcna). IPA was applied to the list of genes that were
significantly hypomethylated with up-regulated gene
expression. The networks highlighted (Figure 8) contained molecules involved in formation of cancer, proliferation and transformation of cells in humans. For
example, pcna is involved in formation of the replication fork and directs maintenance methyltransferases to
the newly synthesized DNA strand. Mapk1, capn2 and
erk were additional molecules linked with human
tumorigenesis.
Confirmation of the CGI tiling array data using bisulfite
sequencing PCR

Based on the data obtained from the methylation tiling
array, six genes from 3 different categories of hypomethylated, hypermethylated and genes showing no significant change between tumor and healthy tissue based
on microarray analysis were selected for validation of
the array data by bisulfite sequencing PCR (three tumor
samples and three control samples). Bisulfite sequencing
PCR provided a detailed analysis of the methylation status of individual CpGs within the amplified regions [30].
The glutathione S-transferase P1 CGI, as shown in
Additional file 2, Figure S1, is un-methylated in both
tumor and control samples. Following treatment with
CpG methyltransferase (SssI) in the presence of SAM, it
became fully methylated (Additional file 2, Figure S3).
This artificially methylated gene was used as a positive
control to confirm our semi-quantitative measurements
of DNA methylation.

Direct sequencing of bisulfite-treated and amplified
DNA was used for measurement of average methylation
percentage in a population of DNA molecules. Both
normal and tumor tissues are heterogeneous in terms of
molecular alterations and cell populations. As in this
study DNA was extracted from a tissue with a mixture
of cell populations, complete homogeneity of the
sequence data was not anticipated. Therefore, the proportion of C/T was compared between samples based
on well established methodology previously utilized
[31-33]. Direct sequencing of bisulfite treated amplified
DNA (as well as allowing the detection of partial and
rare events [34]) provided an average methylation percentage at particular CpG sites in a population of DNA
molecules. This is in contrast to establishment of the
methylation status of a CpG in one molecule achieved
by cloning prior to sequencing [31-34]. The genes
selected for additional analysis using bisulfite sequencing
PCR (BSP) were coronin, actin binding protein 2ba (coro2ba) (hypermethylated in HCC), insulin-like growth
factor binding protein 1b (igfbp1b) and angiopoietin-like
3 (angptl3) (hypomethylated in HCC), no-tail (ntla) (no
change) and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase-like 2

at a particular CpG site and calculation of the percentage of methylation in four-dye trace sequencing data

allowed a semi-quantitative assessment of the methylation level at the specific site. To compare the methylation status of the targeted area by BSP in tumor and
control, the total amount of methylation for the region
was measured and compared for tumor and control.

the tiling array (Figure 9, sequencing data are presented

showing no significant difference in methylation by
microarray also showed no change in methylation
between tumor and normal samples by BSP.

Discussion
To achieve a global non-biased enrichment of the
methylated fragments of genomic DNA, methyl-DNA
immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) combined with the novel
zebrafish CpG island tiling array was used. This method
enabled us to perform the first gene-specific large scale
analysis and establishment of a comprehensive methylation map at CGIs of the regions 1.5 kb upstream to 1
kb downstream of the TSS in both healthy zebrafish
liver and in hepatocellular carcinoma.
Regulation of transcription is a complex procedure. It
is partly accomplished by formation of nucleosomes [35]
and by modulating the binding of regulatory factors and
the transcription complex to transcriptional response
elements, both directly and indirectly [1]. Epigenetic
mechanisms such as chromatin modifications, RNA

interference (RNAi) and DNA methylation are key modulators of transcription through different mechanisms,
such as prohibiting transcription factor access to their
binding sites and affecting the formation of nucleosomes
[12,35,36].
The methylation profiles of cancer cells are extensively
distorted [11]. Hypomethylation in tumors is associated
with transcriptional activation of previously suppressed
genes and is a hallmark of tumorigenesis [1,11], where
active genes are un-methylated with hyperacetylated histones [12]. As shown in Table 1A, GO terms associated
with DNA binding and transcription regulation were significantly over-represented amongst genes hypomethylated
in HCC samples. Genes including histone deacetylase 4,
DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 6 and lysine-specific
demethylase 4A showed significant decreases in their
methylation levels in HCC samples in comparison to
healthy liver.
Comparison of the normal hepatic gene methylation
pattern between human liver, presented by Archer et al
[37], and zebrafish liver in this study showed a low correlation (r 2 = 0.187) implying lack of conservation of
methylation patterns between human and zebrafish.
However, our comparisons showed that, in zebrafish and

sites = 21; igfbp1b:tumors: number of CpG sites = 15, controls: number of CpG sites = 15; coro2ba: tumors: number of CpG sites = 41, controls:
number of CpG sites = 41 ± SEM).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/3

human HCC tumors, similar gene families and genes
involved in shared pathways are altered in terms of
methylation. For example, zebrafish HCC samples
showed methylation changes in genes involved in proliferation, cell cycle, metastasis, apoptosis, energy production, adhesion, stress, DNA binding and regulation of
transcription (Table 1A, B and Additional file 6, Tables
S2 and S3), similar to the biological processes that contain genes with altered methylation in human HCC [2].
Several other genes from families such as ABCA, CHST,
DHX, KCTD, MEGF, MYO, NPY, RNF and TBCID were
found to be hypermethylated in both zebrafish and
human HCC [38]. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated
that the genes with altered methylation in zebrafish hepatocellular carcinoma were associated with biological functions such as cell death, cell morphology, inflammatory
response, DNA repair and replication and induced molecules involved in cancer formation such as c-jun, shc and
pka. These functions and molecules are commonly
altered in human cancers. We have associated changes in
methylation of these particular genes with changes in
gene expression during tumorigenesis. The changes in
methylation levels of these particular genes and pathways
could be directly or indirectly linked to their altered
expression levels during tumorigenesis.
In our study, GO terms associated with cell proliferation were significantly over-represented in the list of
hypomethylated genes in tumors which is particularly
relevant since an imbalance between regulation of cellular proliferation pathways and cell death by apoptosis
can promote the development of tumors [39]. Antiapoptotic genes, such as BCL-2, and their regulators, are
often over expressed in human tumors [40,41]. Our
results showed a significant decrease in the methylation
of a positive regulator of the Bcl-2 protein, bcl-2 associated athanogene 5 (baga5) gene [40]. Changes in antiapoptotic pathways in zebrafish HCC were concurrent
with changes in pathways of proliferation. Insulin like
growth factors (IGF) and insulin like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) play important roles in organizing
cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation and are
commonly deregulated in human tumors [42]. In zebrafish HCC, genes for several insulin growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) such as igfbp2b were significantly
hypomethylated. The promoter region of the human
IGFBP-2 gene is rich in CpGs and lacks a TATA box
[43]. It is therefore plausible that methylation plays an
important role in regulating the expression of this gene.
Multiple complex IGF-dependent and independent biological functions influenced by the tissue type and
pathological status have been identified for IGFBPs
[42,43]. An increased level of IGFBP-2 protein has been
reported in liver tissues and serum during human

Page 12 of 16

malignancy [42,43] with a positive correlation to the
malignancy status of the tumor [43]. In contrast to its
normal role as a negative regulator of growth, increased
levels of IGFBPs in tumors have been linked to
enhanced proliferation, partly as a response to androgens and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) protein.
Thus, anaerobic conditions as well as IGF, can result in
increased amount of HIF-1 [44]. A lack of vascular supply at the early stages of tumorigenesis in highly proliferating tumor cells results in hypoxia [44]. Under
hypoxic circumstances glycolysis becomes the dominant
pathway for energy production in tumors and glycolytic
enzymes are induced. Associated with this, the HIF-1
protein, expressed in an anaerobic environment, initiates
the transcription of several genes involved in stress and
glycolysis as well as IGFBP2 [43,44]. This is in accord
with our finding that GO terms related to glycolysis and
hypoxia pathways were more prevalent in the list of
hypomethylated genes in HCC samples. Glycolytic
enzymes such as enolase 2 (ENO2) and hexokinase 2
showed significant decreases in methylation of their
genes in HCC samples, indicating a potential increase in
expression. Increased expression of enolases such as
ENO1 and 2, as a response to hypoxia and HIF-1, has
been reported in human HCC [45]. As well as its function in energy production, ENO1 has been associated
with enhanced proliferation in HCC [45]. Therefore,
based on the functions of genes whose methylation was
significantly altered in HCC samples it appears that
there is a link between induction of IGF, IGFBPs, HIF,
anti-apoptotic and glycolytic pathways [43,44,46]. This
is similar to findings previously reported on gene
expression in human HCC implying that differential
methylation is at least partially causative of differential
gene expression in HCC.

Conclusion
In this paper we described the development of a zebrafish CGI tiling array and showed that in combination
with the MeDIP technique, it can be used to detect and
profile the methylation status of specific genes. We used
this method to provide a comprehensive profiling of
zebrafish liver methylation as well as establishing the
methylation changes observed in HCC.
The methylation alterations detected can help to
explain some of the changes in gene expression in HCC.
There are striking similarities between the pathways disrupted by aberrant gene expression and methylation,
both within and between human and zebrafish HCC.
Achieving a better understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation in the zebrafish will increase the confidence regarding the use of zebrafish as a convenient
model for human disease.

Methods
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Poole,
Dorset, UK, unless otherwise stated.
Measurement of genome wide DNA methylation by HPLC

An AKTA Explorer 10 with P900 pump, automatic UV
detector (Amersham Biosciences), APEX ODS C18 column, 250 × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size (Waters
HPLC Ltd, UK, Phenomenex, UK); and grade column
(Phenomenex, UK) were used. Following purification of
DNA using Qiagen DNA/RNA purification kit (Qiagen,
Ltd, West Sussex, UK), percentage of global DNA
methylation was quantified according to the method of
Ramsahoye [47].
Experimental procedure and sample preparation

Methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation in combination
with a CpG island tiling array was used for profiling
methylation patterns in un-treated zebrafish liver and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples. The chemical treatment procedure and doses used for generating
zebrafish tumors are described by Zhan et al [48]. The
exposures were carried out at the National University
of Singapore and the experimental procedure was
approved by its Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Briefly, three-week-old zebrafish fry were
treated with 0.75 ppm 7, 12-dimethylbenz [a]anthracene (DMBA) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, vehicle
control) for 24 h and the treatment was repeated once
2 weeks later for another 24 hours with 1.25 ppm
DMBA or DMSO. Treated fish were rinsed three times
in fresh water and transferred into new tanks for
maintenance. Fish were sampled 6-10 months after
DMBA exposure. The tumor samples used for the present study were all larger than 3 mm in diameter.
Liver tumors were sampled for histopathological diagnosis (histopathology images of HCC and healthy zebrafish liver are presented in Additional file 10, Figure
S1 and histopathology procedures and criteria used for
recognizing HCC are explained in detail in a previous
publication 23). Briefly, criteria for classification of
liver neoplasms were based on nuclear factors
described by Goodman et al [49]. In this study, healthy
male livers (n = 4) from the vehicle control exposure
(n = 4), hepatocellular carcinoma from the DMBA
exposure (n = 4, male) and positive and negative controls artificially generated from the vehicle control
exposure (detailed below) were used for MeDIP and
immunoprecipitated DNA was labeled with fluorescent
Cy5-dCTP. A non-immunoprecipitated genomic DNA
pool was used as a reference and was labeled with
fluorescent Cy3-dCTP.

Design of the 4 × 44 k format CpG island (1.5 kb
downstream to 1 kb upstream of TSS) zebrafish tiling array

Probes were designed by Genotypic (Genotypic Technology, Bangalore, India) and were synthesized and
printed by Agilent (Agilent technologies, Berkshire, UK).
The criteria described by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer [50] for prediction of CpG islands in vertebrates
were used to predict CpG islands in zebrafish, with
minor modifications. The zebrafish genome sequence
was derived from the Ensembl data base (version 56,
genome build zv8, genome build date April 2009). For
each gene, the region 1.5 kb upstream to 1 kb downstream of predicted transcription start sites (TSS) was
found, using the 5’ end of each transcript as the putative
TSS. Repetitive sequences were masked and the Emboss
CpG prediction tool (European Molecular Biology
Laboratory-EBI) identified 9,192 genes containing 14,507
CpG islands. From the preliminary list of genes (9,192),
60-mer probes were designed with an average spacing of
25 bp where possible. Due to the requirements for
probe specificity, probes could not be constructed for all
predicted CGIs. Probes with multiple BLAST hits on the
zebrafish genome and with identical 55 bp alignments
were removed. Finally, 43,960 probes were designed for
7,903 CGIs in 6,024 genes. Slides were printed containing 45,220 features; 1,227 Agilent control features, 33
blank features and 43,960 probes. The array design was
named Agilent Birmingham D.rerio 025794 45220v1 and
is available from ArrayExpress under accession AMEXP-1813. Lists of genes with predicted CGIs and the
detailed criteria used for prediction of CGIs are presented in Additional file 5, Table S1. Probes were functionally annotated from the zebrafish genome and
additional gene ontology (GO) terms were found using
Blast2GO [51].
The “Core Analysis” function included in Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems Inc, USA)
[52] was used to aid interpretation of the hypo- and
hyper-methylated (fold change > 1.5) genes found by
comparison of zebrafish HCC with healthy liver. A Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing correction was
employed to determine significant enrichment of annotation with biological functions and canonical pathways
among these gene sets.
Positive and Negative Controls

CpG methyltransferase (New England Biolabs, U.S.A)
was used to generate artificially methylated DNA from
zebrafish liver genomic DNA using S-adenosyl methionine according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,
10×NEBuffer 2 (2 μl), S-adenosyl methionine (160 μM),
genomic DNA (1 μg) and SssI methylase (40 U/μl; New

Mirbahai et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:3
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/3

England Biolabs, U.S.A) were mixed in a total volume of
20 μl. The sample was incubated at 37°C for 4 h followed by incubation at 65°C for 20 min for inactivation
of the enzyme.
A negative control for the array was generated by PCR
amplification of sonicated zebrafish liver genomic DNA.
DNA samples were amplified using GenomePlex Complete Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) Kit (SigmaAldrich, Poole, Dorset, U.K). PCR amplification removes
DNA methylation, resulting in an artificially un-methylated DNA. Positive and negative control samples
were purified (Qiagen) prior to use in methyl-DNA
immunoprecipitation.
Methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)

DNA from tumor, control, SAM-treated DNA (positive
control) and amplified DNA (negative control) were dissolved in TE buffer (6 μg in 300 μl) and fragmented to
200 bp-1 Kb using a sonicator (SONICS Vibra Cell, 100
watt, 3 × 10 s with 35 s intervals on ice with 20% amplitude). Sizes of the generated fragments were checked on
a 1% agarose gel.
Methylated fragments of DNA were separated from
the un-methylated fragments using MagMeDIP kit
(Diagenode, Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. DNA sample (1 μg) was used in each
immunoprecipitation. To avoid amplification bias, five
aliquots of each sample were immunoprecipitated and
combined. Samples were re-purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and precipitated with
ethanol and glycogen. DNA pellets were air dried and
stored at -80°C until subsequent use for labeling.
Sample labeling and hybridization to CGI (1.5 kb
downstream to 1 kb upstream of TSS) zebrafish
tiling array

The Agilent genomic DNA enzymatic labeling kit (Agilent technologies, Berkshire, UK) and the protocol provided were used for labeling the immunoprecipitated
DNA with the fluorophore Cy-5 and zebrafish genomic
DNA with the fluorophore Cy-3. The specific activities
of the labeled samples were checked using a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer. Cy3-labeled genomic DNA samples
were pooled. For each hybridization, equal amounts (80
pmol incorporated) of Cy-3 labeled genomic DNA and
Cy-5 labeled immunoprecipitated DNA were mixed.
Microarray hybridization was performed using an Agilent Oligo aCGH/Chip on chip hybridization kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the
hybridization mixes were loaded onto 4 × 44 K format
slides (Agilent Birmingham D.rerio 025794 45220v1)
hybridized overnight, washed, stabilized and dried. The
dried slides were scanned using an Axon 4000B laser
scanner (Molecular Devices, Wokingham, UK).

Statistical analysis

MIAME-compliant raw microarray data were submitted
to ArrayExpress at EMBL-EBI and can be found under
accession E-MTAB-209. GeneSpring v7.2 (Agilent) was
used for analyzing the data. Data flagged as present in
at least 4 of the 10 samples were used for analyses. The
Cy-5 test signal was divided by the control signal (genomic pool) and each microarray was normalized to the
mean of the control group. Data with low raw intensity
(less than 25) or standard deviation greater than 1.4
between biological replicates were removed from the
analyses. Lists of hypo- and hyper- methylated genes
were generated using 1.5 fold change cut-offs and parametric Welch t-tests between tumor and healthy groups
(p-value <0.05) on the normalized data.
DNA methylation analysis using bisulfite sequencing PCR

The MethPrimer data base (MethPrimer - Li Lab,
UCSF) was used to design BSP primers (primer
sequences and annealing temperatures used are listed in
Additional file 1, Table S1). An artificially methylated
positive control was used for assessing complete conversion of un-methylated cytosine to uracil after treatment
with bisulfite and methylation of all CpG dinucleotides.
The EZ DNA Methylation kit (Cambridge Biosciences,
UK) was used for bisulfite conversion according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, for each sample, 500 ng of
genomic DNA was bisulfite treated then amplified using
Zymo Taq DNA polymerase (Cambridge Biosciences,
UK). The PCR products were analyzed via DNA
gel electrophoresis followed by sequencing using an
ABI3730 DNA analyzer.

showed complete methylation of the CpG dinucleotides (Figure S2).

methyltransferase (Sss I) in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
results in methylation of all CpG dinucleotides and protection against
conversion of 5-mC to U after treatment with bisulfite. Successful
bisulfite treatment and sequencing of the positive control was
established by observing a single C peak at the CpG dinucleotide
positions. (Two independent tumor samples, two independent control
