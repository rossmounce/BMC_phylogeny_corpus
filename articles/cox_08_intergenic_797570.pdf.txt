Abstract
Background: Despite intensive efforts devoted to collecting human polymorphism data, little is
known about the role of gene flow in the ancestry of human populations. This is partly because
most analyses have applied one of two simple models of population structure, the island model or
the splitting model, which make unrealistic biological assumptions.
Results: Here, we analyze 98-kb of DNA sequence from 20 independently evolving intergenic
regions on the X chromosome in a sample of 90 humans from six globally diverse populations. We
employ an isolation-with-migration (IM) model, which assumes that populations split and
subsequently exchange migrants, to independently estimate effective population sizes and migration
rates. While the maximum effective size of modern humans is estimated at ~10,000, individual
populations vary substantially in size, with African populations tending to be larger (2,300–9,000)
than non-African populations (300–3,300). We estimate mean rates of bidirectional gene flow at
4.8 × 10-4/generation. Bidirectional migration rates are ~5-fold higher among non-African
populations (1.5 × 10-3) than among African populations (2.7 × 10-4). Interestingly, because effective
sizes and migration rates are inversely related in African and non-African populations, population
migration rates are similar within Africa and Eurasia (e.g., global mean Nm = 2.4).
Conclusion: We conclude that gene flow has played an important role in structuring global human
populations and that migration rates should be incorporated as critical parameters in models of
human demography.

Background
Reconstructing human history requires an accurate picture of global human population structure [1]. However,
methods currently used to describe structure among
human groups typically rely on very simple demographic
models that make unrealistic biological assumptions.
Two commonly used models include the island model,
which assumes that populations have no shared ancestry

and are related only through gene flow (Figure 1A), and
the phylogenetic branching or splitting model, which
assumes that populations diverged at some time in the
past and have remained completely isolated ever since
(i.e., no gene flow) (Figure 1B). Despite increasingly
sophisticated genetic datasets, most contemporary studies
still assume these unrealistic models to infer aspects of
human demographic history [2-8].

Figure of population structure reflecting the (A) island, (B) splitting and (C) isolation-with-migration (IM) models
Models 1
Models of population structure reflecting the (A) island, (B) splitting and (C) isolation-with-migration (IM)
models. The island model assumes equilibrium gene flow (m) between subpopulations that have no shared ancestry. The
divergence model describes an ancestral population, which splits at time t into two daughter populations that do not exchange
genes in subsequent generations. The isolation-with-migration model describes a constant-sized ancestral population that splits
into two daughter populations that can exchange genes and change in size. There are seven parameters in the isolation-withmigration model: effective population size of the ancestral deme (NA), effective population sizes of the two descendent demes
(N1 and N2), unidirectional migration between the descendent populations (m1 and m2), proportion of the ancestral population
founding deme 1 (S), and population divergence time (t).

Furthermore, human population structure is often considered only from the perspective of a single summary statistic, FST, which is a standardized measure of the genetic
variation shared between populations. However, FST is
dependent on the effective size (N), migration rate (m)
and divergence time (t) of individual demes, and by itself
has no straightforward demographic interpretation. A
small FST between two populations may indicate large
effective population sizes, high rates of gene flow since
diverging from a common ancestral population, or recent
population divergence. For instance, under Wright's [9]
island model, N, m and FST are linked by a nonlinear relationship independent of t (equation 2) [10]. Assuming a
global effective size for modern humans of ~104, an X
chromosome FST of 0.2 [11,12] suggests that human populations have exchanged ~4 gene copies per generation.
Conversely, under a simple divergence and isolation
model, N, t and FST are related by a nonlinear relationship
independent of m (equation 4) [13]. Assuming a mean
generation time of 25 years, an X chromosome FST of 0.2
suggests that global human populations diverged on average ~84 Kya. However, despite being in common usage,
gene flow-only and divergence-only models probably
have little relevance to actual human demographic history.

Here, we examine the structure of human populations by
means of the isolation-with-migration (IM) model [14],
which incorporates both population splitting and gene
flow (Figure 1C). The IM model describes two daughter
populations, which can expand or contract in size, that
diverge from a constant-sized ancestral population with
continuing migration between the two demes. The IM
model has seven demographic parameters: effective population size of the ancestral deme (NA), effective population sizes of the two descendent demes (N1 and N2),
unidirectional migration rates between the descendent
populations (m1 and m2), proportion of the ancestral
population founding the first deme (S), and population
divergence time (t). Unlike the island model, which
assumes infinite divergence times, or the splitting model,
which assumes zero migration, IM makes no a priori
assumptions about these two demographic parameters. It
is therefore a more flexible model system for inferring
human history from genetic data.
Here, we apply a Bayesian inference framework together
with a maximum likelihood algorithm [15] to determine
demographic parameters for a range of human populations under the IM model. Marginal Bayesian posterior
probabilities are calculated using Markov chain Monte

Carlo, and best-fit parameterizations are inferred for each
population pair (N = 15) for each of the seven demographic parameters. We analyze a multilocus resequencing dataset comprising 20 intergenic regions on the X
chromosome, each of which represents ~5 kb of DNA
[16]. To minimize any potential confounding effects of
natural selection, the sequenced loci were chosen from
single-copy non-coding (i.e., putatively non-functional)
DNA in regions of medium or high recombination (r ≥ 0.9
cM/Mb). Such regions are recombinationally unlinked
from genic regions. Because we use resequence data (i.e.,
all sites were sequenced in each individual) and not preascertained single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
[3,17,18], we avoid some biases in aspects of the data that
rely on the site frequency spectrum (e.g., FST) [19,20].
These data are also well suited for testing the role of gene
flow in the history of anatomically modern humans
because multiple, diverse populations are represented in
our survey (i.e., Biaka from Central African Republic,
Mandenka from Senegal, San from Namibia, Basque from
southern France, Han from northern China, and Melanesians from Papua New Guinea).

Results
Population differentiation
Wright's FST for our global sample averages to 0.25. When
we calculate FST between all pairs of populations, we find
the greatest FST values between sub-Saharan African and
non-African groups (i.e., FST ranges from 0.160–0.450)
(Table 1). However, there is also a substantial amount of
differentiation within sub-Saharan African (mean FST of
0.137) and within non-African groups (mean FST of

0.174), with FST values as high as 0.226 between Melanesians and Basque [16].
Demographic inference under the isolation-with-migration
model
Marginal Bayesian posterior probabilities were calculated
using Markov chain Monte Carlo, and best-fit parameterizations were inferred for each unique population pair
(e.g., see Figure 1 in Additional file 1). Results for the
seven demographic parameters are discussed individually
below (also see Table 1).
Effective population sizes
Modern effective population sizes (N) were inferred multiple times under the IM model (i.e., once for each paired
population, Tables 1 and 2 in Additional file 1). Although
individual estimates of N have some uncertainty, mean
effective sizes are statistically larger for African populations (2,300–9,000) than non-African (300–3,300) populations (t20 = 6.9, P << 0.001). Some non-African groups
have especially small effective sizes, such as Melanesians
(N0 <1,500). Mean ancestral sizes (10,500, range 6,600–
12,800) are generally larger than modern effective sizes,
and are also often larger than the sum of their descendant
populations (t19 = 3.42, P = 0.0029).
Population split proportions
Our dataset has little power to infer how ancestral effective sizes were apportioned among descendent demes.
Most estimates of the split proportion, S, have large confidence intervals (Table 3 in Additional file 1). The few
informative estimates indicate substantial retention of

ancestral effective size in African populations; for
instance, less than ~10% of the ancestral population size
of Mandenka and Papua New Guineans is retained in the
latter population today. Similarly, among non-Africans,
the Han Chinese retain less than ~10% of the diversity carried when their ancestral deme still included the ancestors
of modern Papua New Guineans (upper bounds of the
95% confidence interval for S).
Migration rates
Stationary estimates of long-term unidirectional migration rates average to 2.4 × 10-4/generation (range: 8.7 × 108 – 2.1 × 10-3/generation), thereby suggesting that gene
flow between global populations is relatively frequent
(Table 4 in Additional file 1). The highest bidirectional
migration rate (2.1 × 10-3; lowest rate: 3.8 × 10-5) implies
a movement of ~1 X chromosome every 2 years. Bidirectional migration rates within and between continents vary
significantly (F2,12 = 21.5, P = 0.0001, η = 0.78), with continental assignment accounting for 61% of the variation
in migration rates. Mean bidirectional migration rates
within Africa (2.7 × 10-4), and between Africans and Eurasians (2.1 × 10-4), are relatively low compared to migration rates within Eurasia (1.5 × 10-3). Furthermore,
migration patterns between populations are largely symmetric. Han Chinese and Melanesians provide a key
exception; migration from China to the Pacific (2.1 × 103/generation) has significantly exceeded migration in the
opposite direction (1.8 × 10-5/generation) (see 95% confidence intervals in Table 4 in Additional file 1).
Population divergence times
Marginal posterior distributions for t indicate that divergence times between African populations all occur ~50
kya, with the largest upper confidence interval for any two
African populations at ~140 kya (Table 5 in Additional
file 1. Estimates of non-African split times are made difficult by diffuse posterior distributions with very high variance, and thus caution is advised in interpreting the
higher mean non-African divergence time (~67 kya). Estimates of the lower bounds for non-African divergence
times, with a mean of ~30 kya, are more consistent with
previous estimates. The mean divergence time between
African and non-African populations is ~58 kya (or
~2,100 generations), which is very similar to previous estimates of the out-of-Africa expansion inferred from other
genetic data [21-23].
Validation of inferred demographic parameters
The inference system employed here has been validated
elsewhere [15], and our own tests indicate that known
demographic parameters (including m) for data simulated under an IM model are recovered within 95% confidence intervals (unpublished data). However, to further
assess the suitability of the IM model to explain observed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/76

patterns of variation, we used coalescent simulation to
model each population pair (N = 15) using the parameter
values of NA, N1, N2, m1, m2 and t inferred above. Due to
poor estimates of the split proportion, we assumed S =
0.5. To check whether these coalescent simulations return
data similar to the empirical loci, we compared observed
summary statistics for all twenty X chromosome loci with
summary distributions from these parameterized simulation models. We focused on four summaries of the data:
i) FST, which describes the genetic distance between populations; ii and iii) θW and θπ, which are unbiased estimators of the population mutation rate θ (= 3Neμ); and iv)
Tajima's D, which summarizes the site frequency spectrum.
Observed FST values are correlated with FST values simulated under these 15 simulation models (Mantel test, r =
0.49, P = 0.039). Although this only explains 24% of the
variance, we obtain mean FST values that are just slightly
lower than those actually observed (i.e., mean FST of 0.21
versus 0.25, not significantly different). The simulation
models also provide good fits to observed data for the
remaining summaries, all of which reflect aspects of the
population site frequency spectrum. A Bonferroni correction holding the experiment-wise type-I error rate constant at α = 0.05 was applied to accommodate multiple
tests for each population and each summary. We observe
2% of loci as outliers under the corrected 95% confidence
intervals for the 360 tests performed on our parameterized simulation models (i.e., 6 populations, 20 loci, and
3 summary statistics) (Table 6 in Additional file 1). This
degree of consistency between observed and simulated
data is similar for both African and non-African populations (e.g., Figure 2). This similarity suggests that our estimates of demographic parameters are not strongly biased
by the inference method, and that the IM model is capable
of portraying the evolutionary processes underlying
human population structure, at least at the geographic
scale examined here [24].

Discussion
It is generally appreciated that migration affects many
important ecological and evolutionary properties of populations [25]. Yet there is little consensus in the literature
on the role of gene flow in shaping patterns of human
population structure. Equilibrium models, like the island
model [9], were favored historically because analytical
expectations are relatively simple to obtain. On the other
hand, while it is accepted that migration occurs frequently
among human populations [26-31], gene flow is often
ignored in models of human demography. Recent examples ignoring gene flow include studies of African replacement models [32] and serial-founder models for the
settlement of Eurasia [5]. Other studies of human demographic history analyze data separately for each popula-

tion sample and simply neglect any effects of shared
common ancestry or gene flow [7].
As pointed out by Whitlock and McCauley [25], both
direct and indirect measures of migration and gene flow
are fraught with difficulty. The use of summary statistics
such as FST is limiting because it provides no insight into
which historical processes are responsible for the

observed genetic differences between populations. It is
therefore left up to individual investigators to choose
which model of population structure is used to interpret
data, and inferences depend heavily upon the assumptions inherent in each model. We set out to directly estimate rates of gene flow between human populations
through the use of the isolation-with-migration (IM)
model, which incorporates both population splitting and

gene flow. For this purpose, we have analyzed a large DNA
sequence database collected with the expressed purpose of
constructing models of human demographic history, and
hence, is focused on intergenic (i.e., putatively neutral)
regions on the X chromosome [16]. Values of FST for this
dataset were found to be slightly higher than those estimated from other large X chromosome resequence datasets [11,12]. This difference is probably driven, at least in
part, by the inclusion of more isolated groups than were
included in other DNA sequence surveys of X-linked loci
(i.e., the San from Namibia, Biaka from Central African
Republic, and Melanesians from Papua New Guinea)
[16].
To disentangle the evolutionary processes underlying FST
in real human populations, we inferred N, m and t separately for the six populations in our survey using the IM
model. While the mean global value for ancestral population size, ~104, is consistent with previous estimates of the
global population size of modern humans [33-37], no
individual population approaches the effective size of
modern humans as a whole. Although sizes of individual
populations estimated from nuclear loci remain sparse,
other studies have produced similar results [2,38-40],
including previous applications of the IM model to
human genomic sequences [41]. Non-African population
sizes (N0 ≈ 3000) estimated from linkage disequilibrium
(LD) [42] are particularly noteworthy because recombination information is independent of the site frequency
spectrum, which we used to infer effective sizes here. That
similar results are obtained using unrelated subsets of the
genetic information, and different populations, reinforces
our confidence in these low estimates of effective population size.
This finding is important because many studies make the
simplifying assumption that individual human populations have an effective population size of 104 [e.g., [43]].
We note that estimates of N based on the standard neutral
model (i.e., θ = 3Nμ) are 2–4 times higher than those
returned by IM for individual African and Eurasian samples, and are even higher for our Melanesian sample (see
Table 1 in Wall et al. [16]). We suspect that this difference
is largely due to violations of assumptions of the WrightFisher model rather than a systematic bias in parameters
returned by IM (see Results). For example, population
substructure and gene flow are expected to upwardly bias
estimates of within population diversity (e.g., θ) when
applying models that do not incorporate these variables.
Indeed, we demonstrate here that rates of gene flow
between subdivided human populations are non-zero.
For unidirectional migration rates (m1, m2), ~87% of pairwise comparisons (i.e., 42 of 48) showed gene flow in at
least one direction (i.e., their 95% confidence intervals

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/76

exclude zero migration; Table 4 in Additional file 1).
When bidirectional migration rates (m = m1 + m2) are
considered, lower bounds of 95% confidence intervals are
greater than zero for all 15 pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, mean bidirectional migration rates within Africa
(2.7 × 10-4/generation), and between Africans and Eurasians (2.1 × 10-4), are significantly lower than migration
rates within Eurasia (1.5 × 10-3).
Correspondingly, estimates of the population migration
rate range from 0.2–4.9 (mean Nm = 2.4). This implies
that 2–3 X chromosome copies, on average, move
between human populations every generation, although
this stationary estimate does not explain how migration
events are distributed through time. We infer slightly
higher population migration rates within Africa and
within Eurasia than between continents (Figure 3). Interestingly, because effective sizes and migration rates are
inversely related in African and non-African populations,
values of Nm are similar within Africa and Eurasia (Figure
4). Furthermore, migration rates are not associated with
geographic proximity in any simple fashion. For instance,
Basque and Han are located far apart geographically, but
exhibit one of the highest rates of gene flow. This presumably reflects factors affecting historical mobility that are
more complex than simple isolation-by-distance.
Clearly, our results cannot be interpreted under either the
pure splitting or island models, which assume no gene
flow and no shared ancestry, respectively. In any case,
under an island model, a population migration rate Nm
greater than ~0.25 would be too high to explain the value
of FST observed here (cf. Figure 2A in Additional file 1).
Indeed, no further differentiation of local island populations is expected when Nm > 1 [44,45]. Note, however,
that the axiom whereby exchanging one gene copy per
generation inhibits population divergence does not hold
for the IM model; populations can continue to diverge,
albeit slowly, even when Nm = 3.3 (Figure 2C in Additional file 1). Importantly too, FST depends on interactions
between a suite of demographic parameters, including N,
m and t (Figure 3 in Additional file 1). These results highlight the limited power of FST to yield insights into human
demographic processes without further knowledge of
population divergence times, effective sizes and migration
rates (i.e., the very parameters that we often attempt to
infer from FST). Although FST is often considered directly
proportional to divergence time, where migration is
assumed to be absent and all population sizes identical
[46:29–30], these assumptions do not hold for the
human populations examined here. Thus, caution is warranted when interpreting FST as a simple proxy for population history [e.g., [5,46]].

In sum, we have independently inferred effective population sizes, times of divergence and rates of migration
under an IM model of population structure based on the
analysis of a large X chromosome DNA sequence database. The parameters that we have estimated for six globally distributed populations indicate relatively high
levels of migration (e.g., mean Nm = 2.4) (Figure 4). A
simple interpretation of our results is that human populations have exchanged migrants at a constant high rate during the entire history since their divergence from a
common ancestral population. A more realistic interpre-

tation is that they have experienced changing migration
rates through time. Unfortunately, we cannot currently
discriminate between these two scenarios; IM can only
infer a stationary rate of gene flow (i.e., a time averaged
rate). Our initial explorations permitting migration rates
to change through time suggest that this process can have
significant effects on the value of FST (e.g., see Figure 4 in
Additional file 1). There is also independent evidence that
rates of gene flow may be increasing towards the present.
For example, the very large and asymmetric gene flow that
we observe between Chinese Han and Melanesians may

well result from the late Holocene (3–4 kya) expansion of
agricultural populations recorded not only by haploid
genetic loci [47,48], but also archaeologically and linguistically [49]. This is similar to Wakeley's [50] inference
based on a maximum likelihood analysis of restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) from across the
genome that human populations have transitioned from
a period of higher to lower population structure through
an increased rate of migration towards the present. We
also acknowledge that long-term mean rates of migration
may be affected by both recurrent gene flow restricted by
geographical distance [51] and long range dispersals by

groups of migrants (i.e., range expansions), which can
occur sporadically and still have large effects on global
values of FST [29,52,53]. Interestingly, population genetic
models with spatial and temporal fluctuation in the population migration rate (averaging around Nm ~1 in an
island model) have been shown to be conducive both to
the rapid spread of beneficial mutations throughout the
species and local population differentiation [54]. We note
that theoretical predictions based upon other models of
subdivision (such as metapopulation models) [8,52]
would be worth developing to further explore the nature
and extent of human population structure.

Finally, the finding of high rates of gene flow among
human populations has important implications for how
we interpret the distribution of SNPs associated with disease [55] and the role of natural selection in shaping patterns of diversity [31,52,53]. For instance, recent
migration produces haplotypes with extended linkage disequilibrium that could be misinterpreted as recent selection [56]. Gene flow can also significantly skew the site
frequency spectrum within populations [8], and may
therefore lead to erroneous inferences regarding demography.

Conclusion
While the maximum effective size of modern humans is
estimated at ~10,000, individual populations vary substantially in size. African populations tend to be larger
(2,300–9,000) than non-African populations (300–
3,300). We independently estimate mean rates of bidirectional gene flow at 4.8 × 10-4/generation, and these rates
are higher among non-African populations (1.5 × 10-3)
than among African populations (2.7 × 10-4). Interestingly, because effective sizes and migration rates are
inversely related in African and non-African populations,
effective migration rates are similar globally (e.g., mean
Nm = 2.4). While significant theoretical challenges
remain in disentangling the evolutionary factors that
structure human populations, it is clear that migration can
no longer be treated as a simple, equilibrium parameter –
or ignored – as it often is in reconstructions of human history.

Methods
Genomic data
Our database comprises 20 loci from intergenic regions
on the X chromosome. Each region chosen for sequencing
spans ~20 kb of primarily single-copy non-coding (i.e.,
putatively non-functional) DNA in regions of medium or
high recombination, which are at least 50 kb away and
recombinationally unlinked from the nearest gene [16].
No two regions are within one megabase of each other.
Within each region, there are ~4–6 kb of sequence data
from 3 discrete subsections that span most of the distance
of each region. 10–24 X chromosomes are sampled from
each population, which include 3 from Africa (10 San
from Namibia, 16 Biaka pygmies from Central African
Republic, 18 Mandenka from Senegal) and 3 from Eurasia/Oceania (16 French Basque, 16 Han Chinese, 24 Melanesians) (see Wall et al. [16] for a complete description of
the sequencing strategy).
FST estimates
FST can be calculated using several different algorithms.
Here, we adopt the approach of Hudson et al. [57],
defined in terms of polymorphic site heterozygosity,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/76

which we have amended to accommodate unequal sample sizes [58] and missing data.

FST = 1 −

where Hw (≡ πw) is the mean distance per polymorphic site
sampled from the same population, and Hb (≡ πb) is the
mean distance per polymorphic site sampled from both
populations. Reported values represent the mean FST at all
segregating sites across all 20 X chromosome loci.
The expected value of FST for X chromosome loci under the
island model with an infinite number of demes depends
only on the product of the effective population size N,
and the migration rate per generation m [10: 294-5]
ΌFST΍ ≈ (1 + 3 Nm)-1

FST estimates must be corrected if a finite number of demes
d are intended instead [59]

The population-scaled rate of gene flow Nm can be
derived by simple rearrangement of equation 3.
Correspondingly, the expected value of FST for X chromosome loci under a divergence model depends only on the
divergence time t, in generations, scaled by the effective
population size N [13]

Demographic inference
Genetic diversity at twenty X chromosome loci is applied
to determine the most likely parameterization for a series
of paired population isolation-with-migration models.
Seven demographic parameters are inferred from the
genomic data under each two-deme IM model: effective
population size of the ancestral deme (NA), effective population sizes of the two descendent demes (N1 and N2),
unidirectional migration rates between descendent populations (m1 and m2), proportion of the ancestral population founding the first deme (S), and population
divergence time (t). Populations are analyzed in all pairwise combinations using the Markov chain Monte Carlo
Bayesian/maximum likelihood framework implemented
in the 31 July 2006 version of IM http://lifesci.rut
gers.edu/~heylab/heylabsoftware.htm#IM. More complete descriptions of this method are available elsewhere

[14,15,41,60,61]. The IM software infers all coalescent
parameters, except S, as mutation-scaled rates – θ1 = 3N1μ,
θ2 = 3N2μ, θA = 3NAμ, m1 = m1/μ, m2 = m2/μ, and t = tμ –
which, if mutation rates are known, can subsequently be
transformed to real world values (i.e., actual population
sizes, migration rates and chronological dates). Mutation
rates per year are estimated for each locus from mean
Homo/Pan sequence divergence assuming a split time of 6
× 106 years. Per generation rates assume a mean generation interval of 28 years, as estimated from cross-cultural
ethnographic data [62]. A 1:1 mating ratio is also assumed
throughout. Migration rates m1 and m2 are inferred in the
coalescent (i.e., backward in time), and bidirectional
migration rates m are simply the summation of m1 and
m2.
Because the IM algorithm has most power with perfectly
treelike data (an infinite sites implementation), datasets
with no evidence of recombination were extracted from
each locus using the four-gamete approach of Hudson
and Kaplan [63]. Individuals and segregating sites are
given equal weighting, and the largest non-recombining
block maximizing overall information content is selected
for each locus, a practice that minimizes any bias in the
resulting dataset [64]. Analyses are run at a mean CPU
speed of 2.5 GHz on an ~100 core Condor grid at the University of Arizona Computer Science Department. All
datasets are initially parameterized from a single run with
bounded uniform priors: θ1, θ2, θA ∈ U(0, 40), m1, m2 ∈
U(0, 20), S ∈ U(0, 1) and t ∈ U(0, 3). Ranges are raised or
lowered in subsequent runs to incorporate complete marginal posterior probability densities. Once these bounds
are established, a minimum of four replicate jobs each of
>5 chains are run for a minimum of 107 steps. Chain mixing by Metropolis-Hasting coupling, long run times and
multiple independent runs allow us to identify convergence on each parameter's underlying stationary distribution.
Because we observe little variation among multiple independent runs (e.g., Figure 1 in Additional file 1), marginal
posterior probability densities for a given parameter are
combined and analyzed as a single probability distribution. Maximum probability estimates and 95% confidence intervals are reported as modes and {0.025, 0.975}
quantiles of posterior probability densities, respectively.
We estimate all seven parameters of the model (Tables 1–
5 in Additional file 1) for all population pairs. Uninformative posterior distributions are sometimes encountered for some population pairs; in particular, the
ancestral population split time parameter t often proves
difficult to infer (Table 5 in Additional file 1). However,
the seven demographic parameters are inferred as marginal densities, and therefore uncertainty in one parameter has no impact on the remaining parameters. Parameter

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/76

values are treated as unknown unless we observe clear
maximum likelihood peaks that are replicated across multiple independent IM jobs.
Coalescent simulations for demographic parameter
validation
The nonlinear relationship between gene flow, divergence
time and FST under the isolation-with-migration model is
explored using coalescent simulation with the software
ms [65]. An IM model conditioned on mean values for the
seven demographic parameters, as inferred from the
empirical dataset (Tables 1–5 in Additional file 1), is
implemented for each population pair. A suite of summary statistics is explored under these models: θW and θπ,
which are unbiased estimators of the population mutation rate; Tajima's D, which summarizes the population
site frequency spectrum; and FST, which summarizes the
joint site frequency spectrum. Observed values of these
four summary statistics, calculated from the empirical
dataset, are compared to the summary statistic distributions returned by coalescent simulation. A Bonferroni correction holding the experiment-wise type-I error rate
constant at α = 0.05 is applied to account for the use of
multiple per-population tests. A Mantel test is used to
determine the correlation for FST, a between-population
(i.e., matrix) test.
