Abstract
Background: Since no genome sequences of solanaceous plants have yet been completed,
expressed sequence tag (EST) collections represent a reliable tool for broad sampling of Solanaceae
transcriptomes, an attractive route for understanding Solanaceae genome functionality and a
powerful reference for the structural annotation of emerging Solanaceae genome sequences.
Description: We describe the SolEST database http://biosrv.cab.unina.it/solestdb which integrates
different EST datasets from both cultivated and wild Solanaceae species and from two species of
the genus Coffea. Background as well as processed data contained in the database, extensively
linked to external related resources, represent an invaluable source of information for these plant
families. Two novel features differentiate SolEST from other resources: i) the option of accessing
and then visualizing Solanaceae EST/TC alignments along the emerging tomato and potato genome
sequences; ii) the opportunity to compare different Solanaceae assemblies generated by diverse
research groups in the attempt to address a common complaint in the SOL community.
Conclusion: Different databases have been established worldwide for collecting Solanaceae ESTs
and are related in concept, content and utility to the one presented herein. However, the SolEST
database has several distinguishing features that make it appealing for the research community and
facilitates a "one-stop shop" for the study of Solanaceae transcriptomes.

Background
Solanaceae represents one of the largest and most diverse
plant families including vegetables (e.g. tomato, potato,
capsicum, and eggplant), commercial (e.g. tobacco) and
ornamental crops (e.g. petunia). Some Solanaceae plants
are important model systems such as tomato for fruit ripening [1,2], tobacco for plant defence [3], and petunia for
the biology of anthocyanin pigments [4].

Since no full genome sequence of a member of the
Solanaceae family is yet available, though genome
sequencing efforts are at the moment ongoing for tomato
[5], potato http://www.potatogenome.net/ and tobacco
http://www.tobaccogenome.org/, much of the existing
worldwide sequence data consists of Expressed Sequence
Tags (ESTs). Because of the useful information these data
bring to the genomics of Solanaceae plants, the availability

of EST collections has dramatically increased in size,
partly thanks to the start-up of sequencing initiatives [6].
EST collections are certainly no substitute for a whole
genome scaffold. However, they represent the core foundation for understanding genome functionality, the most
attractive route for broad sampling of Solanaceae transcriptomes and, finally, a valid contribution to comparative analysis at molecular level on the Solanaceae family
members. ESTs are a versatile data source and have multiple applications which result from the specific analytical
tools and methods accordingly used to process this type of
sequence.
Therefore EST databases are useful not only to strictly
serve as sequence repositories, but as powerful tools,
albeit relatively under-exploited and far from complete.
Several web resources have been established for collecting
ESTs and for improving and investigating their biological
information content due to the growing interest in
Solanaceae genomics research. Some of them, mainly
focusing on individual species, address the needs of a particular research community by providing a catalogue of
putative transcripts, describing their functional roles and
enabling gene expression profiling [7,8]. The remaining
represent data-gathering centres or rather comprehensive
resources aiming to meet the challenges raised by the
management of multiple information from diverse
sources worldwide [9-11].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/142

and has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of Solanaceae genomes and address sequencebased synteny issues.
A common complaint in the SOL community concerns
the different unique transcript sets generated for a given
Solanaceae species by diverse research groups. These
worldwide resources [9-12] are built starting from different primary data sets and by applying diverse methods
and user-defined criteria for sequence analysis. Of course,
there are advantages and disadvantages associated to each
set, but to our knowledge, there is currently no easy way
to compare them and, as a consequence, to provide the
scientific community with a comprehensive overview. To
this end, we also propose, as a novel feature of the SolEST
database, a combined resource/interface dedicated to enabling the combination of different unigene collections for
each Solanaceae species based on the UniProt Knowledgebase annotations.
The collection and integration of the whole public dataset
of Solanaceae ESTs facilitate a "one-stop shop" for the
study of Solanaceae transcriptomes.

Construction and content
Sequence retrieval
EST sequences are downloaded from dbEST http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/ and from the Nucleotide/
mRNA division of GenBank (release 011008).

The ultimate goal of these gene index providers is to represent a non-redundant view of all EST-defined genes. The
unigene builds, which emerge, serve as the basis for a
number of analyses comprising the detection of fulllength transcripts and potential alternative splicing,
expression pattern definition, association to array probes
and, as a consequence, to microarray gene expression
databases; association to metabolic and signalling pathways; development of simple sequence repeat (SSR) and
conserved ortholog set (COS) markers etc.

EST/mRNA processing pipeline
The EST processing and annotation pipeline is described
in [14] although it has been recently upgraded by updating the set of databases used in EST vector cleaning and
repeat masking and in the annotation phase. In addition,
the clustering tool was replaced with a more efficient
novel method presented in [15]. This pipeline, divided
into four consecutive steps, was used for processing EST
data from 14 cultivated and wild Solanaceae species and
from two species belonging to the genus Coffea (Table 1).

We present the SolEST database, which integrates different
EST datasets from both cultivated and wild Solanaceae species and also two EST collections from Rubiaceae (genus
Coffea). SolEST is built on the basis of a preceding effort
which was centred on the investigation of ESTs from multiple tomato species [12]. The main purpose is corroborating the existing transcriptomics data which are part of the
multilevel computational environment ISOL@ [13]. In
addition, the Solanaceae EST-based survey can considerably contribute to genome sequence annotation by highlighting compositional and functional features. Indeed,
SolEST is a valuable resource for the ongoing genome
sequencing projects of tomato (S. lycopersicum) [5] and
potato (S. tuberosum; http://www.potatogenome.net/)

(1) Vector cleaning
RepeatMasker http://repeatmasker.org is used to identify
and mask vector sequences by using the NCBI's Vector
database
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/vec
tor.gz; update October 2008). The masked regions are
removed with an in-house developed trimming tool.
(2) Repeat masking
EST sequences are masked using the RepeatMasker program with the RepBase.13.06 http://www.girinst.org/ as
selected repeat database. Targets for masking include lowcomplexity regions, simple sequence repeats (SSR, also
referred to as microsatellites) and other DNA repeats (e.g.
transposable elements).

(3) Clustering and assembling
For each collection the rate of sequence redundancy was
evaluated by first clustering, then assembling EST reads to
produce tentative consensus sequences (TCs) and singletons (sESTs; see Table 1). The wcd tool [15] was used with
its default parameters for the clustering process. The CAP3
assembler [16] with overlap length cutoff (= 60) and an
overlap percent identity cutoff (>85) was run to assemble
each wcd cluster into one or more assembled sets of
sequences (i.e. TCs). Indeed, when sequences in a cluster
cannot always be all reconciled into a solid and reliable
multiple alignment during the assembly process, they are
divided into multiple assemblies/TCs. Possible interpretations are: (i) alternative transcription, (ii) paralogy or (iii)
protein domain sharing. All the ESTs that did not meet the
match criteria to be clustered/assembled with any other
EST in the collection were defined as singleton ESTs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/142

(4) Annotation
Functional annotation, which is performed both on EST
sequences and TCs, is based on the detection of similarities (E-value ≤ 0.001) with proteins by BLAST searches versus the UniProtKB/Swiss-prot (Release 14.3) database.
BLAST annotation is detailed including fine-grained gene
ontology terms http://www.geneontology.org/ and
Enzyme Commission numbers http://www.expasy.ch/
enzyme/. A back-end tool to align on-the-fly the unique
transcripts against the annotated KEGG-based metabolic
pathways http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ was also implemented.
Database content and web interface
Raw input ESTs, intermediate data (from the pre-processing analysis) as well as transcript assembly data and annotation information were stored in a MySQL relational
database whose structure reproduces the one described in

sequences and the amount of sequences containing more than one SSR.

[12]. Web interfaces were implemented in dynamic PHP
pages and include Java tree-views for easy object navigation (http://biosrv.cab.unina.it/solestdb/; Figure 1). In
addition to well-established access to the EST-based
resources via web interfaces, all sequence datasets are
available for bulk download in FASTA format in a typical
web-based data exchange scenario on the web http://
biosrv.cab.unina.it/solestdb/download.php.

Utility
Simple sequence repeat (SSR) characterization
EST and mRNA sequences were explored for the existence
of microsatellite repeat motifs since they are potential
resources for SSR marker discovery [17,18]. Our research
focused on trimeric, tetrameric, pentameric and hexameric repeat motifs. In the entire collection we found 10
trimeric, 28 tetrameric, 88 pentameric and 16 hexameric
motifs. SSR summary statistics are reported in Table 2,
while the frequency of different types of SSR motifs, which
were identified species by species, can be found in Additional file 1. In Figure 2, we report the average repeat
length and the standard deviation for each SSR motif.
Comparison of different Solanaceae unique transcript sets
We considered the most accessed and referenced
Solanaceae unigene collections freely available on the web
[9-11] in an effort to enable comparisons of different unigene projects for a given species by a comprehensive
approach.

Different Solanaceae and Rubiaceae (genus Coffea)
expressed unique transcript sets from the DFCI Gene
Index Project (DFCI; http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/
tgi/plant.html), the plantGDB (PGDB; http://www.plant
gdb.org/download/download.php?dir=/Sequence/EST
ntig) and the Solanaceae Genome Network (SGN; ftp://
ftp.sgn.cornell.edu/unigene_builds/) were downloaded.
In Table 3 the number of collected sequences per species
is reported for each of the resources taken into account.
Each dataset was compared versus the UniProtKB/Swissprot (Release 14.3) database using BLASTX (e-value =
0.001) and the corresponding results are summarized in
Table 4. A total of 29,463 distinct proteins were matched
corresponding to ~7.35% of the whole protein collection
made up of 400,771 sequences. When considering annotations with respect to the origin of the protein data
source, the bulk of the identifications concerned proteins
of plant and vertebrata origin (35% and 34%, respectively), while protein from bacteria and fungi represent
12% and 9% as reported in figure 3. We built a web tool
dedicated to enable the association of different unigene
collections for a given Solanaceae species based on the
UniProt Knowledgebase annotations. Data can be
accessed by specifying the UniProt accession number, the
UniProt entry name or keywords; the latter may be
searched in the protein description lines http://
biosrv.cab.unina.it/solestdb/solcomp.php.
The results of a query are displayed in matrix format
where each row represents a protein and each column

refers to a single species for each web resource. The (i, j)th
entry of the matrix identifies the number of unique transcripts matching a protein sequence (Figure 4A). By clicking on a single matrix cell the user can access the list of
source-specific sequence identifiers (Figure 4B), each of
which is, in turn, used to generate a cross-reference to the
SolEST database itself as well as to the corresponding
external database.
Exploiting SolEST for Solanaceae genome sequencing
EST-based collections represent a much-needed reference
for the structural annotation of the emerging Solanaceae

genome sequences and for addressing sequence-based
synteny studies. In addition, they can support technical
issues arising while sequencing efforts are ongoing.
1,215 BAC sequences from S. lycopersicum and 708 from
S. tuberosum were retrieved from GenBank on July 2009.
ESTs and TC sequences from tomato and potato were
spliced-aligned along BAC sequences using GenomeThreader [19]. Alignments with a minimum score identity of
90% and a minimum sequence coverage of 80% were filtered out.

Table 6 shows that concurrent mapping of Solanaceae
ESTs/TCs along the tomato and potato BAC sequences is
informative not only for investigating genome co-linearity
between the two species but also for supporting genome
sequencing and assignment of BACs to the corresponding
chromosomes.

Table 5 shows the number of ESTs and TCs per species
successfully mapped along the available BAC sequences
from tomato and potato (see Methods).
We estimated the level of coverage of the Solanaceae transcriptome by counting the number of ESTs/TCs mapped
with respect to the total number of the sequences collected in SolEST. The different transcriptome coverage per
species is informative per se of the similarity level of the
Solanaceae transcriptomes. For example, the EST/TC dataset from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), even if it is solid in
number, proved poorly mapped on both tomato and
potato BACs, showing a transcriptome distance with
respect to S. lycopersicum, S. tuberosum or C. annuum.
Columns 4 and 7 in Table 5 report the number of ESTs/
TCs with multiple matches along tomato as well as potato
BACs. This is expected since sequencing proceeds on a
BAC-by-BAC basis, aiming at a minimal tiling path of
BACs. In other words, it is evident that several transcripts
are aligned along different BACs of the same chromosome
because of BAC overlaps. As an alternative, transcripts
with multiple matches can be identified with repetitive
sequences in the genomes.

First of all, panels A and B in table 6 report instances of S.
lycopersicum TCs solely mapped on BACs from a unique
species. In particular, 5,904 S. lycopersicum TCs mapped
exclusively on tomato genome sequences, while 488 were
successfully aligned only along potato BACs, suggesting
that the potato sequencing project, although started later,
is providing a complementary contribution to that of
tomato.
Tomato as well as potato BACs with ambiguous positioning on chromosomes, which have been assigned to the
arbitrary-defined chromosome 0, can be correctly associated to the corresponding chromosomes by exploiting
(Table 6, panels C and D) evidence from the potato or
tomato counterpart, respectively.
In most cases, it is useful to refer to a comparison of BAC
sequences, while they are released, in an attempt to find
clear genome co-linearity with tomato/potato (Table 6
panels E) or to highlight neighboring genetic loci which
retain their relative positions and orders on different chromosomes of the two species (Table 6 panel F).
Figure 5 shows an example that points to the power of a
comparative approach based on different transcriptome
and genome collections integrated in a single platform.
Transcripts from S. lycopersicum and S. tuberosum were
mapped onto the BAC CU914524.3 from tomato and the
BAC AC233501.1 from potato. The two BACs are present
schematically at the center of the figure and were selected
because they share a remarkable number of TCs (20 TCs)
which are represented as colored bars (the same colors
identified the same TCs). Clearly, all the TCs successfully
aligned along the BAC CU914524.3 are mapped onto the
potato BAC AC233501.1 maintaining their relative positions and orders. It can be easily assumed that the two
genomic regions taken into account are co-linear. However, they differ in size, the potato genomic region being
120 kb and that of tomato 70 kb. This is due to insertions
in the potato BAC. In these inserted regions TCs from both
the species are present (black bars). The region which we
are describing is highlighted in yellow and is "zoomed-in"
in order to display details on the TC splice-alignments.
SolEST currently provides information on the mapping of
both EST and TC datasets on the draft sequences of the
tomato and potato genome in the framework of platform
ISOL@ [13].

Discussion
Different databases worldwide are related in concept, content and utility to the one presented herein. All of them
aim to partition EST sequences into a non-redundant set
of gene-oriented clusters and to provide sequences with
related information such as biological function and the
tissue types in which the gene is expressed. Of course, they
differ in their database update policy, in data quality
standards and finally in the level of detail with which the
database is endowed, which supports investigations on
structural and functional information and on expression
patterns to different extents.
The SolEST database presents several features making it
appealing for the SOL research community and for those
interested in EST data management. The Solanaceae EST
collection is endowed with both immediate graphical
interfaces and details on the organization of multiple
alignments and consensus sequence structure to permit a
user friendly interpretation of the results as well as easy
access to accessory information. SolEST can be accessed
through different access points which are briefly summa-

rized to describe the main features of the database that
were, however, inherited by TomatEST [12]. The 'Unique
Transcript' access point allows the list of singletons and
tentative consensus sequences to be associated to the
enzymes they encode and, as a consequence, to be
mapped 'on the fly' on the KEGG-based metabolic pathways. Singleton ESTs as well as ESTs which were assembled generating the corresponding TC can be
independently browsed through the 'ESTs' access point.
The maintenance of the single ESTs as well as of the background information related to each of them (presence of
contamination and of repeat subsequences, functional
annotation), makes SolEST suitable for accessing raw data
also in the event of updating the database. This represents
an attractive feature of TomatEST [12] which was saved in
SolEST. Finally, the 'cluster' access point allows those clusters which have been split into multiple assemblies to be
browsed. It can be exploited for a priori identification of
putative alternative transcripts or allele-specific transcript
isoforms and for investigation of heterozygosity and on
the level of ploidy of many of the included species

The total number of ESTs/TCs for each Solanaceae species collected in the SolEST database is shown in the first two columns. The number of ESTs/TCs splice-aligned along BACs, the number of
ESTs/TCs mapped more than once and the number of EST/TC single matches is reported for the tomato and potato genomes, respectively. In addition, the table lists the number of ESTs/TCs
exclusively mapped onto the tomato or potato genome and, finally, the number of ESTs/TCs splice-aligned along both the genomes.

Each selected TC is identified by its ID (TC ID), and a putative functional annotation is associated to it (UniProtKB Annotation). In case of TCs aligned along S. lycopersicum and/or S. tuberosum
BACs, the chromosome number (# chr), the BAC accession number from GenBank (BAC ID), and the BAC start and stop coordinates are reported.

Being in possession of the entire publicly available EST
collection for Solanaceae permitted identification of SSR
and the building of a comprehensive EST-derived SSR catalogue for Solanaceae which is accessible to users. This catalogue can be used to develop genetic markers, opening
up additional paths into Solanaceae phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis and genetic mapping.
Another novel feature of the SolEST database is aimed at
resolving a common complaint in the SOL community as
to whether different Solanaceae assemblies generated by
diverse research groups should be compared. Various clustering and assembly programs or parameters result in differences among the unique transcript sets provided by
different reference databases. In addition, given that each
set can be built starting from non-homogeneous primary
data sources (e.g. dbEST, RefSeq, genomic or unfinished
high-throughput cDNA sequencing (HTC) entries), differences can further become larger. The different major collections now available for the Solanaceae transcriptomes
are however equivalently used by the entire community,
as they represent the basic collection for specific expression arrays (e.g. a list of microarray resources for tomato
is available in [20] Table 2), for COS marker definition
[11], for genome annotation [12]. In order to overcome
such differences, we decided to compare each unigene collection with the UniProt Knowledgebase. The use of a protein reference database may represent a useful tool to
cross-link the different collections through a specific service and, more interestingly, it is an immediate approach to
compare the different EST-based available resources.
One of the most novel features in SolEST, when compared
to other resources, is the option of accessing and then visualizing Solanaceae EST/TC alignments along the tomato
and the potato genomes. The mapping of Solanaceae ESTs
certainly provides insights into the location of potential
candidate genes and facilitates EST-driven gene annotation. This represents the first attempt to provide a unique
view of the data from both the sequencing efforts, which
we believe will be appreciated by the SOL community. In
addition, having ESTs from Solanaceae and Rubiaceae
mapped along the genomes of two of the major representatives of the family will support comparative genomics
approaches aimed at addressing the most fundamental
issues such as diversity and adaptation within the
Solanaceae family and heterogeneity in gene expression
patterns. Finally, the TCs we defined will provide support
for solving technical issues arising from BAC-by-BAC
genome sequencing and will undoubtedly provide a reference for forthcoming WGS (whole genome shotgun)
efforts in both tomato and potato.

Conclusion
To our knowledge, no similar work has yet been carried
out on the construction of an EST database offering a
broad overview of Solanaceae as well as Coffea transcriptomes. Multiple sequence analysis results from the database (e.g. developing a unigene set, annotation with
putative function and identification of SSRs) extensively
linked to external related resources, represent a major
source of information for these plant families, opening up
novel vistas conducive to comparative evolutionary studies. We think the SolEST database will represent an invaluable resource for supporting the structural annotation of
the emerging Solanaceae genome sequences and addressing technical issues arising while sequencing efforts are
being made. Finally, the SolEST database meets the challenge of connecting the different EST-centered collections
worldwide generated by applying various methods and
starting from disparate primary data sources.

Availability and requirements
The SolEST database is available with no restrictions at the
following URL: http://biosrv.cab.unina.it/solestdb/.
The SolEST update is scheduled at the end of each year
and comprises the retrieval of primary data sources (i.e.
EST/mRNA sequences) and the generation of novel unigenes/TCs as well as their annotation. Therefore, at each
release the update of the satellite databases (i.e. UniVec,
RepBase, UniProtKB/Swiss-prot, Gene Ontology, Enzyme,
KEGG) used in the cleaning, repeat masking and annotation phases is also performed.
The retrieval of new S. lycopersicum and S. tuberosum BAC
sequences from the GenBank repository is ensured daily
by an automated pipeline [13]. The switch to genome
contigs will beensured as the sequencing status will
evolve.

Authors' contributions
NDA was mainly involved in the development, organization and maintenance of the SolEST database and wrote
the manuscript; AT was involved in setting up the comparative analysis of the genome sequences from tomato and
potato; LF contributed to carrying out the project; MLC
conceived the project, directed its design and implementation, coordinated the different efforts and wrote the
manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
