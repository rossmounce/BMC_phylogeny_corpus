Abstract
Background: Cucumber, Cucumis sativus L. is an important vegetable crop worldwide. Until very recently,
cucumber genetic and genomic resources, especially molecular markers, have been very limited, impeding
progress of cucumber breeding efforts. Microsatellites are short tandemly repeated DNA sequences, which are
frequently favored as genetic markers due to their high level of polymorphism and codominant inheritance. Data
from previously characterized genomes has shown that these repeats vary in frequency, motif sequence, and
genomic location across taxa. During the last year, the genomes of two cucumber genotypes were sequenced
including the Chinese fresh market type inbred line ‘9930’ and the North American pickling type inbred line ‘Gy14’.
These sequences provide a powerful tool for developing markers in a large scale. In this study, we surveyed and
characterized the distribution and frequency of perfect microsatellites in 203 Mbp assembled Gy14 DNA sequences,
representing 55% of its nuclear genome, and in cucumber EST sequences. Similar analyses were performed in
genomic and EST data from seven other plant species, and the results were compared with those of cucumber.
Results: A total of 112,073 perfect repeats were detected in the Gy14 cucumber genome sequence, accounting for
0.9% of the assembled Gy14 genome, with an overall density of 551.9 SSRs/Mbp. While tetranucleotides were the
most frequent microsatellites in genomic DNA sequence, dinucleotide repeats, which had more repeat units than
any other SSR type, had the highest cumulative sequence length. Coding regions (ESTs) of the cucumber genome
had fewer microsatellites compared to its genomic sequence, with trinucleotides predominating in EST sequences.
AAG was the most frequent repeat in cucumber ESTs. Overall, AT-rich motifs prevailed in both genomic and EST
data. Compared to the other species examined, cucumber genomic sequence had the highest density of SSRs
(although comparable to the density of poplar, grapevine and rice), and was richest in AT dinucleotides. Using an
electronic PCR strategy, we investigated the polymorphism between 9930 and Gy14 at 1,006 SSR loci, and found
unexpectedly high degree of polymorphism (48.3%) between the two genotypes. The level of polymorphism
seems to be positively associated with the number of repeat units in the microsatellite. The in silico PCR results
were validated empirically in 660 of the 1,006 SSR loci. In addition, primer sequences for more than 83,000 newlydiscovered cucumber microsatellites, and their exact positions in the Gy14 genome assembly were made publicly
available.
Conclusions: The cucumber genome is rich in microsatellites; AT and AAG are the most abundant repeat motifs in
genomic and EST sequences of cucumber, respectively. Considering all the species investigated, some
commonalities were noted, especially within the monocot and dicot groups, although the distribution of motifs
and the frequency of certain repeats were characteristic of the species examined. The large number of SSR markers
developed from this study should be a significant contribution to the cucurbit research community.

Background
Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are
short (1-6 bp) tandemly repeated DNA sequences found
ubiquitously in the genomes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [1-3]. Because of their high mutation rate,
which results in allelic changes of array length, these
repeats represent a rich source of hypervariable codominant markers [4,5]. Thus, microsatellite markers have
become extensively used in many research areas such as
linkage mapping [6,7], population genetics [8], parentage
analysis [9]), and phylogenetic or comparative genomics
research [10,11]. Besides their usefulness as genetic markers, microsatellites are thought to play important roles
in genome evolution, e.g., by creating genetic variability
[12], in regulation of gene expression [13,14] thereby
conditioning the development of some human genetic
disorders [15,16], and in chromatin organization, DNA
replication and cell cycle [17].
The availability and analysis of nearly complete genome sequences from many organisms has provided
insight into the distribution, evolution and putative
function of microsatellites [17]. Microsatellite density
and distribution across the genome is unequal and seemingly non-random, as suggested by SSR data from
humans [18], plants [19] and other eukaryotic organisms
[3], with commonalities and differences observed across
taxa. For example, tri- and hexanucleotide repeats generally prevail in protein-coding sequences, whereas
taxon-specific variation in distribution of repeat motifs
in different genomic fractions (for example, intergenic
or protein-coding regions vs. introns) has also been
reported [3,19]. The distribution of microsatellites in the
genome has practical implications with regard to their
use as molecular markers. For example, compared to
microsatellites from non-transcribed DNAs, genic SSR
markers have higher transferability among related species, which facilitates their use as anchor markers for
comparative mapping studies [20]. On the other hand,
genic microsatellites are under a higher selection pressure [3], so they may not provide sufficient polymorphism to discriminate between closely related germplasm.
In this case, SSRs in noncoding regions may be a valuable complement.
The genus Cucumis (family Cucurbitaceae) includes
two economically important vegetable crop species that
are cultivated worldwide: cucumber (C. sativus L., 2n =
2x = 14) and melon (C. melo L., 2n = 2x = 24). Cucumber is believed to be of Asian origin, and was domesticated around 1,500 BC [21-24]. Two inter-fertile
botanical varieties, the cultivated C. sativus var. sativus
L. and the wild type C. sativus var. hardwickii (Royle)
Alef., comprise the primary gene pool of cucumber. Due
to its narrow genetic base, the intraspecific genetic

diversity in cucumber as revealed in early studies with
marker types such as isozymes, RFLPs (restriction fragment length polymorphisms), AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) or RAPDs (randomly
amplified polymorphic DNAs), is relatively low (3-12%)
as compared to other Cucumis species [25-31], hindering the development of high-resolution genetic maps in
cucumber. This has encouraged efforts towards the
development of marker systems in cucumber that have
higher polymorphism and are more user-friendly.
Among them, microsatellite markers have been developed [32-34] and used for genetic mapping and markerassisted selection studies [35,36]. However, large scale
development of microsatellite markers were not realized
until the whole genome sequence of cucumber was
available [37]. Recently from cucumber whole genome
sequence, Ren et al. (2009) designed ~ 2,100 SSR primer
pairs, from which a cucumber linkage map with 995
SSRs was constructed, which was the largest set of
microsatellites mapped to date in this species [38]. The
usefulness of these cucumber microsatellite markers has
already been demonstrated in several recent linkage
mapping, diversity, as well as phylogenetic studies
[39-42]. Despite such progresses, the number of robust,
informative and user-friendly markers (e.g., SSRs) publicly available for cucumber is still insufficient for some
applications, particularly considering the low intra-specific polymorphism level observed even with microsatellite
markers (10-20%) [41,42]. The availability of a very large
set of microsatellite markers distributed throughout
the genome would facilitate the development of highresolution maps (or rapid saturation of specific map
regions), which are instrumental for applications like
positional gene cloning and detailed comparative mapping, among others. Such molecular resources would
benefit the cucumber research and breeding community.
Recent developments in high throughput DNA
sequencing technologies, such as the Roche/454 FLX
and Illumina’s Solexa platforms [43] provide new opportunities to expedite molecular marker development. In
the past year, the genomes of two cucumber genotypes
have been sequenced; the Chinese fresh market type
inbred line ‘9930’ [37] (database is hosted at http://
cucumber.genomics.org.cn/), and the North American
pickling type inbred line ‘Gy14’ (genome and EST
assembly are available at http://cucumber.vcru.wisc.edu/;
genome annotation is available at http://www.phytozome.net/cucumber.php#A). In spite of the importance
of microsatellite markers in many applications, systematic and genome-wide characterization of microsatellite
sequences in the cucumber genome have not yet be
conducted. In the present study, we have characterized
the distribution and density of perfect microsatellites in

~203 Mbp of non-redundant DNA sequence from the
nuclear genome of Gy14, as well as in cucumber EST
sequence data. Comparative analysis using genomic and
EST sequence datasets from other plant species was performed. In addition, primer sequences for more than
83,000 newly-discovered cucumber microsatellites, and
their exact positions in the Gy14 genome assembly,
were made publicly available.

Results
We analyzed the distribution of perfect microsatellites
with ≥3 repeat units and a minimum total length of 12
bp in ~ 203 Mbp of non-redundant cucumber genomic
sequence, representing 55.3% of its 367 Mbp nuclear
genome [44]. Repeats were first analyzed on a whole
genome basis using genomic DNA sequence of cucumber inbred line Gy14 and other species (for comparison
purposes). We then examined SSR frequencies in transcribed (EST) sequences, and compared them with their
genomic sequence counterparts. For consistency in estimating repeat frequencies, the SSR motifs presented
here represent all variants of both strands of the DNA
sequence (e.g., AC also includes CA and the reverse
complements GT and TG). Unless otherwise stated,
microsatellite content in DNA sequences was expressed
as ‘number of SSRs per million base pairs’ or as relative
frequencies (%) within a particular dataset.

trinucleotides were by far the most frequent repeat type
(Table 1). In both monocot species (rice and sorghum)
trinucleotides predominated whereas tetranucleotides
were more abundant in most (4 out of 6) of the dicot
species analyzed. Other than this observation, no major
differences were evident between monocots and dicots,
and the range of variation in repeat density of both
groups largely overlapped for most SSR types.
We examined the distribution of cucumber microsatellites with regard to the number of repeat units
(Figure 1). For all SSR classes, microsatellite frequency
decreased as the number of repeat units increased.
However, the rate of this change was more gradual in
dinucleotides than in longer repeat types, with tetra- to
octanucleotides showing the most dramatic reduction in
frequency as they increased repeat units. As a consequence, the mean number of repeat units in dinucleotides (9.6) was nearly twice as much as the number of
repeat units in trinucleotides (4.9) and it was three
times higher than in tetra- to octanucleotides (3.2 - 3.3)
(Table 1). Thus, although tetranucleotides (164.2 SSRs/
Mbp) occurred more frequently than dinucleotides
(146.0 SSRs/Mbp) in the Gy14 assembled genome, the
dinucleotide repeats, due to their higher number of
repeat units, had a greater contribution to the genome
fraction occupied by SSRs: the cumulative sequence
length of di- and tetranucleotide repeats was 570 kb
and 432 kb, respectively.

Distribution of SSR types in genomic sequences

The content of perfect microsatellites in genomic
sequences of cucumber and seven other plant species is
summarized in Table 1. A total of 112,073 SSRs with
perfect repeats were detected in the Gy14 whole genome
sequence, which translated to an overall density across
the genome of 551.9 SSRs/Mbp (i.e., one SSR every 1.8
kb of sequence, excluding mononucleotide SSRs). Surprisingly, cucumber had the highest microsatellite density among the species analyzed, comparable to that of
poplar (508.3 SSR/Mbp), grapevine (506.9 SSR/Mbp)
and rice (529.4 SSR/Mbp) (Table 1). Taken together, the
total length of di- to octanucleotide repeats was estimated to account for about 0.9% of the assembled Gy14
cucumber genome (1% if mononucleotides were
included; data not shown).
Tetranucleotides were the most common SSR type in
cucumber genomic sequence representing nearly 30% of
all SSRs, followed by di- (26.5%) and trinucleotides
(25.6%) (Table 1). Hepta- and octanucleotides were the
least frequent repeat types, together representing less
than 3% of the total SSRs. The distribution of SSR types
in cucumber was most similar to that of poplar and
grapevine, which had comparable relative and absolute
frequencies for each SSR type, and least similar to
the distribution in rice and Arabidopsis, for which

Distribution of SSR types in transcript sequences

We analyzed frequencies of perfect microsatellites in
three transcript sequence datasets of cucumber which
included two clustered EST datasets; an 18.8Mbp-set
from cucumber inbred line WI 1983 flowers (Cucurbit
Genomic Database, CuGenDB) and a 42.1 Mbp-set from
Gy14 root and leaf tissues (http://cucumber.vcru.wisc.
edu/; Weng et al., unpublished data); and a bulked EST
dataset from WI 1983 (63.7 Mbp from CuGenDB).
These data, along with similar analyses in clustered
ESTs (gene indices) from seven reference plant species,
are shown in Table 1. For comparisons with other species only the clustered ESTs dataset of cucumber was
used, unless otherwise stated.
SSR frequencies in the two clustered and one nonclustered EST datasets of cucumber were comparable
for tri-, hexa-, hepta- and octanucleotides, whereas a
higher frequency of dinucleotides was found in clustered
ESTs (16.3 vs 12.9 for WI 1983, Table 1). Comparable
frequencies were also found for tetra- and pentanucleotides in both -clustered and bulk- WI 1983 datasets,
whereas these repeats were less abundant in Gy14 ESTs.
Biases due to variations in genotype, developmental
stage and type of the tissue used for transcripts isolation, and sequencing technologies may account for the

observed differences. Considering only EST datasets of
WI 1983, which used the same genotype, transcripts
assay protocol and sequencing technology, the overall
SSR density was slightly higher in clustered (458 SSRs/
Mbp) than in bulk (428 SSRs/Mbp) ESTs.
The overall microsatellite density in cucumber ESTs
was lower than in genomic sequence, although not significantly (P = 0.41). Cucumber trinucleotides and hexanucleotides were more frequent in transcripts than in
genomic DNA, regardless of the EST dataset used. Trinucleotides accounted for 42.6-48.5% and 44.6% of the
total SSRs in clustered and bulk ESTs, respectively
(Table 1). Tetra-, di-, penta-, hexa-, hepta- and octanucleotides followed, in that order, in abundance. Analysis
of microsatellites in the expressed fraction of the genomes of other species revealed distributions similar to
cucumber, with a rather constant relative abundance of
repeat classes across taxa: trinucleotides were by far the
most frequent SSR type (representing 42 to 66% of all
SSRs), followed in order by tetra-, di-, hexa-, penta-,
hepta-, and octanucleotides, in nearly all the species
analyzed (Table 1). However, the absolute frequency of
trinucleotides varied by more than a 4-fold magnitude
across plant species, ranging from 108 in grapevine to
486 trimers per Mbp in rice. Trinucleotide density in

cucumber was most similar to that of soybean, poplar
and Medicago, the most closely related species included
in the study. Considering all the species, di-, tetra-,
penta-, and heptanucleotide repeats were significantly
more abundant in genomic compared to EST data
(t-test, P < 0.05). On the contrary, tri- and hexanucleotides
were more frequent in ESTs than in genomic sequences,
although these differences were not significant.
Distribution of microsatellite motifs

We have carried out a detailed analysis of individual
repeat motifs for each type of SSRs found in genomic
and EST sequences of cucumber, along with similar calculations for other plant species, which is presented as
supplemental data (Additional file 1) available with the
online version of this paper. Here we present the main
results of this analysis.
Dinucleotide motifs

Analysis of AC, AG, AT and CG repeats showed that
AT motif was dramatically overrepresented in cucumber
genomic sequences (Figure 2 and Additional file 1,
Table S2a). AT repeats were not only the predominant
dinucleotides, but they were also the most frequent
motif in the entire genome, accounting for 18.7% of the
total SSRs. In addition, compared to other species,

Figure 2 Distribution of different di- and trinucleotide repeats in genomic and EST sequences of cucumber and selected seven other
plant species. Frequency values were expressed as number of repeats per million base pairs of sequence. Species were arranged in order to
their phylogenetic relationship with cucumber. All species considered, repeats of AT (T = 4.53, P = 0.0021), AC (T = 1.34, P = 0.018), and AAT (T =
2.68, P = 0.028) were significantly more frequent in genomic - than in EST data, whereas ACT (T = 4.25, P < 0.001) and ACC (T = 7.09, P < 0.001)
were more abundant in EST sequence. Detailed information on frequencies of individual di- and trinucleotide repeat motifs was provided in
Additional file 1 (supplement Tables S2a and S3a).

cucumber had the highest density of AT repeats, with
AT also being the most abundant single motif, regardless of repeat type, across all genomic datasets examined. In contrast, cucumber EST sequences had a much
lower frequency of AT dinucleotides, with AG being the
predominant EST dinucleotide.
The same general pattern of dinucleotide motifs distribution was observed in other species; AG predominated
in EST sequence whereas AT prevailed in genomic
DNA (Figure 2). AC and CG repeats were the least frequent dinucleotides (in that order) in both genomic and
EST sequences of all species. Detailed frequencies of
individual dinucleotide motifs are included in Additional
file 1 Tables S2a and S2b.
Trinucleotide motifs

In cucumber, as well as in other species analyzed, trinucleotide repeats were more abundant in ESTs compared
to genomic sequences. Analysis of the frequencies of

different trinucleotides revealed that repeats of AAT
and AAG were most common in cucumber genomic
data, whereas AAG predominated in ESTs (Figure 2).
This pattern also applied for all dicots. Conversely, CCG
were the rarest trinucleotides in both genomic and EST
datasets of dicot species including cucumber. The opposite distribution was observed in the monocots rice and
sorghum, for which CCG was by far the most abundant
trinucleotide repeat motif in both genomic and EST
data. A strong bias in the distribution of trinucleotides
towards GC-rich motifs was found in genomic and protein-coding sequences of monocots, such bias being
more evident in EST sequence (Figure 2). For example,
GC-rich motifs accounted for on average 78% of the
trinucleotide repeats in monocots, with a range of 56%
(in sorghum genomic data) to 88% (in rice ESTs),
whereas only 33% of GC-rich trimers were found in
dicots, ranging from 10 (in grapevine genomic data) to

Cavagnaro et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:569
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/569

46% (in poplar ESTs). For details, see Additional file 1,
Tables S2a, b and S3a, b.
Tetranucleotide motifs

Tetranucleotide repeats were far more frequent in genomic compared to EST sequences of cucumber (Table 1).
The AT-rich motifs AAAT, AAAG, AATT, and AAAC
were, in that order, the most abundant tetranucleotides
in cucumber genomic data, together representing ~78%
of all tetramer repeats, whereas GC-rich repeats like
CCGG, CCCG, AGCC, and AGCG were the rarest, with
relative frequencies of less than 0.1% (Figure 3, and
Additional file 1, Table S2a). A similar distribution was
observed in the other dicots, for which a clear predominance of these same AT-rich motifs was observed. In
general, the same tetramer repeats that predominated in
genomic sequences of dicots, including cucumber, also
prevailed in their ESTs counterparts (Figure 3, and supplement Table S2a). As in the case of trinucleotides,
monocot species had a much higher density of GC-rich
tetramers than dicots in both genomic and EST
sequences (see Additional file 1, Table S2a for details).

Pentanucleotide motifs

Cucumber genomic sequences had higher frequency of
pentanucleotide repeats than ESTs. AAAAG, AAAAT,
AAATT, AAAAC and AATAT were, in that order, the
most common motifs in the cucumber genome, together
accounting for > 65% of the total pentanucleotides (see
Additional file 1, Table 2b). In general, these motifs also
predominated in cucumber ESTs and, compared to
other species, cucumber had the highest density of
AAAAG repeats in both genomic and EST sequences.
Analysis of pentanucleotide frequencies in genomic
data from other species revealed that, in all dicot species
except cucumber, AAAAT was the most abundant
repeat, outnumbering the next most frequent repeats,
AAAAG or AAAAC, by 2.2 to 4 fold, respectively,
whereas nearly identical frequencies for AAAAG and
AAAAT were found in monocots. Similar to monocots,
cucumber genomic sequences had a nearly 1:1 ratio for
these two major pentanucleotide motifs, (although their
absolute frequencies in cucumber were roughly 3-7 fold
higher than monocots).

values are expressed as number of repeats per million base pairs of sequence. Species are arranged in order to their phylogenetic relationship
with cucumber. All species considered, repeats of AAAT (T = 3.46, P = 0.009), AATT (T = 3.90, P = 0.005), AAAC (T = 2.71, P = 0.017), ACAT (T =
3.07, P = 0.008), AACT (T = 4.04, P = 0.001), AATC (T = 3.67, P = 0.003), and AATG (T = 2.25, P = 0.041) were significantly more frequent in
genomic- than in EST sequences, whereas the AACC (T = 2.39, P = 0.031) tetranucleotides were more abundant in EST data. Refer to Additional
file 1 (supplement Tables S2a and S3a) for details on frequencies of individual tetranucleotide motifs.

*No hepta- or octanucleotide repeats were present in the SSRs sample used in this analysis. Loci with compound SSRs were excluded from the analysis unless all
simple repeats within the compound SSR were of the same type, in which case ‘repeat length’ was the sum of the repeat lengths in each simple repeat (for
example, (AT)8(GT)12 = 40 nt). Mononucleotides (5 SSRs) were not included in the analysis.

In general, DNA sequences of monocot species had a
higher frequency of GC-rich pentanucleotide repeats
compared to dicots, although such differences were
more evident when comparing EST data sets. Repeats of
AGAGG, AGGGG, AGGCG, AGAGC, CCGCG, and
CCCCG were relatively abundant in rice and sorghum,
but markedly underrepresented in dicots (AT-rich pentamers predominated in the latter) (see Additional file 1,
Tables 2b and 3b).
Hexanucleotide motifs

Using our SSR search parameters, a slightly higher frequency of hexanucleotide repeats was found in cucumber ESTs (NCBI dataset) than in genomic sequence.
AT-rich hexanucleotide motifs such as AAAAAG,
AAAAAT, AAAAAC, and AAAATT predominated in
cucumber genomic data (73% of total), whereas in ESTs
hexanucleotide repeats were more evenly distributed
between AT-rich motifs (28-37%) like AAAAAG, AAACAC and AAGATG; and GC-rich (~31%) and AT/GC
balanced (32-42%) motifs such as AAGAGG, AAGGAG,
and AGCCGG.
Cucumber genomic sequence had an overall density of
hexanucleotide motifs similar to that of poplar, grapevine, rice and sorghum, and nearly twice the density
found in Medicago, soybean and Arabidopsis. The
AAAAAG repeat was at least two-fold more frequent in
cucumber than in other species. As observed in cucumber, EST sequence data from all others species had a
higher frequency of GC-rich and AT/GC balanced
motifs as compared to their genomic counterparts (T =
2.58, P = 0.031), with rice and sorghum ESTs having the
highest density, and Medicago, soybean and Arabidopsis
the lowest density of such repeats (Additional file 1,
Tables S2b and S3b).

Hepta- and octanucleotide motifs

Hepta- and octanucleotides were the most underrepresented repeat types in cucumber genomic and EST data.
Heptanucleotides were approximately 3 times as dense
as octanucleotides. Both repeat types were ~ 35% more
frequent in genomic than in EST sequences of cucumber. Analysis of motifs revealed -for both SSR types- a
rather dispersed frequency distribution in cucumber
genomic sequence, as indicated by the presence of many
different motifs at low frequency. AT-rich repeats of
AAAAAAG, AAAAAAT, AAAAAAC, AAAATTT, and
AAAGAAG were most abundant, together accounting
for 30% of the total genomic heptanucleotides, whereas
AAAAAAAG, AAAGAGAG, AAAAAAAT, AAAAGAAG, and AAAAAAAC motifs prevailed among octanucleotides. The same heptanucleotide motifs
predominated in cucumber clustered ESTs, except for
AAAATTT, whereas repeats of AAAAAAAG, AGAGAGGG, AAAAAAAC, and AAAGAGAG were most
frequent among transcripts octanucleotides.
In other plant species, a similar relative abundance of
hepta- and octanucleotide repeats was found in genomic
sequence compared to EST data. Again, in general,
many different motifs with low individual frequency
were found in both genomic and EST sequence. Predominant heptanucleotide motifs in genomic sequences of
most plant species were AAAAAAT, AAAAAAG,
AAAAATT, AAACCCT, AAAATTT; whereas
AAAAAAAT, AAAAAAAG, and AAAAAAAC were
frequent among octanucleotides. In EST sequence, a
modest prevalence of AAAAAAAT, AAAAAAAG, and
AAAAAAAC motifs was found in dicots, whereas motifs
of CCCGCCG, AGCGGCG, and ACTCATC were more
common in rice and sorghum.

In silico analysis of SSR polymorphism between Gy14 and
9930 cucumber inbred lines

Using the 2,099 SSR primer pairs originally designed
from genomic sequence of the cucumber inbred line
9930 [38], 1,542 (73.5%) specific bands were amplified
in silico from the genome sequence of Gy14. The
remaining 557 markers failed to generate specific amplicons as they did not meet one or more of the criteria
needed for “specific PCR products” (see Methods). On
the basis of amplicon length comparison between 9930
and Gy14 products, the SSRs were classified as polymorphic (when both alleles differed in at least 2 bp) or
monomorphic (both amplicons were of identical size).
Because a fraction of the Gy14 sequences was generated
from paired-end clones, and the precise sequence length
between these ‘ends’ was uncertain, we were not able to
make reliable comparisons of amplicon sizes in those
cases where the primers of a particular SSR mapped to
different ends of the paired-end contig. This subset
included 407 SSRs that could not be assigned to either
monomorphic or polymorphic categories. In addition,
the Gy14 amplicons of 129 SSRs varied from its corresponding 9930 amplicons by only 1 bp. Due to the possibility that PCR or sequencing errors may be
responsible for some of these variations, these SSRs
were removed from the analysis. The remaining 1,006
SSR loci, which included 972 simple SSRs and 34 compound SSRs, could be unambiguously evaluated for size
polymorphisms comparing Gy14 and 9930. Information
on SSR marker names, primer sequence, in silico PCR
results from Gy14 and 9930 genomes of these 1,006
SSRs was provided in Additional file 1, Table S4.
Of the 1,006 SSR loci, 520 (51.7%) were monomorphic
and 486 (48.3%) were polymorphic, as indicated by
in silico comparisons between Gy14 and 9930. The two
SSR data sets, monomorphic and polymorphic, were
further analyzed to investigate a possible relationship
between polymorphism level and repeat length, for each
SSR type (Table 2). The fact that only 981 of the 1,006
SSR loci are included in Table 2, is because heterogeneous compound SSRs (25 SSRs) could not be assigned
to a repeat-type class. Regardless of the basic motif
length and sequence, the monomorphic SSRs had a
higher frequency of short repeats (30.6% vs. 18.0%, for
repeats < 30 nucleotides (nt)) whereas the polymorphic
SSRs included a substantially higher percentage of long
repeats (33.6 vs 20.8%, for repeats > 40 nt). Both groups
had similar content of intermediate-size (30-40 nt)
repeats (monomorphic 48.8% vs. polymorphic 48.4%,
Table 2).
Considering the basic repeat types, dinucleotides (47%)
were the most common polymorphic SSRs with a frequency 3-fold higher than the frequency of dinucleotides
found in the monomorphic group (Table 2). On the

Page 9 of 18

other hand, trinucleotides (53.9%) predominated among
monomorphic microsatellites, and tri- and pentanucleotides were almost twice as frequent in this group as
compared to the polymorphic SSRs. Variation in the distribution of repeat motifs associated with monomorphic
and polymorphic microsatellites was also found. AAG/
CTT (30.7%), AAT/ATT (14.7%), and AAAG/CTTT
(9.1%) were the most frequent motifs among monomorphic SSRs, whereas AT/AT (36.1%), AAG/CTT
(16.8%), and AG/CT (9.3%) predominated among polymorphic SSRs (data not shown). The nucleotide composition of repeats in both groups was similar, with 83.4%
and 83.8% of AT-rich repeats in the monomorphic and
polymorphic datasets, respectively.
Further analysis of the polymorphic SSR dataset was
performed. We observed that most of the SSR alleles
from 9930 had a corresponding Gy14 allele that was
shorter (i.e., a “contraction” if the 9930 allele is arbitrarily considered the ‘initial’ state of the repeat), and that
the relative frequency of contractions and expansions
varied in relation to the repeat length of the SSRs, with
an increasing proportion of contractions found for
longer repeats (Figure 4). The magnitude of the change
in allele length (Δal) was also related, positively and significantly (r = 0.62, P = 0.005), to repeat length. The latter general trend was largely due to the contribution of
dinucleotides which showed a moderately strong, positive, and significant relationship (r = 0.74, P < 0.0001)
between Δal and repeat length (Figure 5). This association was not statistically significant for other repeat
types. Dinucleotides also had a statistically higher mean
Δal (19.2 bp, 95% LSD test) than tri- (8.5 bp), tetra- (8.7
bp), penta- (8.4 bp), and hexanucleotides (12.3 bp), with
the latter repeat classes not being significantly different
from each other (data not shown). Because variation in
microsatellite mutation rates and polymorphism has
been previously associated with the nucleotide composition of the repeats [45], we compared the Δal of ATrich and AT-poor repeats for each SSR type. The mean
Δal for AT-rich dinucleotides was significantly higher
than for AT-poor dinucleotides (21.9 bp versus 9.4 bp,
95% LSD test) (Figure 5), whereas no significant variation was found for Δal between AT-rich and AT-poor
repeats in other SSR types.
Experimental validation of in silico PCR results

As indicated by results from our in silico analysis, most
alleles from the cucumber inbred line 9930 were larger
than the corresponding alleles from Gy14. These findings were experimentally validated in a subset of these
markers. A total of 660 SSR primer pairs evaluated
in silico, which included 317 polymorphic and 343
monomorphic markers, were tested for PCR amplifications using Gy14 and 9930 genomic DNAs as templates,

markers), 191 (62.4%) SSRs amplified shorter amplicons
in Gy14 than in 9930, and 115 (37.6%) showed the
opposite, which was fully consistent with the results
from our analysis in silico.
Primers design for new SSR markers

Primer pairs for 83,472 microsatellite loci were designed
from cucumber (Gy14) genomic sequence (additional
files 2 and 3, supplement Table S5). Primer pairs that
generated more than one in silico PCR product were
discarded. Thus, this large set of putative markers
includes only non-redundant (single copy) microsatellites. The exact positions of these SSRs in the Gy14 genome assembly, as well as information on repeat motifs,
expected PCR product length, and primers Tm, are presented in Table S5. In addition, correspondences with
SSR markers previously developed and mapped by Ren
et al. (2009) [38], and their linkage map positions, if
available, were included in Table S5 as well.

Discussion
Frequency and distribution of SSRs in the cucumber
genome

Figure 4 Frequency (A) and magnitude (B) of SSR expansions/
contractions in cucumber genotypes Gy14 versus 9930 in
relation to the number of repeat units of the microsatellite.
The allele from cucumber inbred line 9930 was considered as the
reference (or initial state) of the repeat. For each class of ‘number of
repeat units’, the percentage (bars) and actual counts (italic
numbers) of SSRs showing expansions or contractions in Gy14 are
presented in panel A. The magnitude of the change in allele sizes
(Δal) from 9930 and Gy14 is presented in panel B (error bars denote
standard deviations). For compound SSRs, repeat units in each
uninterrupted repeat were summed if the allele had at least 10
repeat units (e.g., (AT)8(GT)12 = 20 repeat units).

and the PCR products were resolved with 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Overall, agreement
between in silico and empirical microsatellite data was
found for 640 (97%) markers. The remaining 20 SSRs
(3%) revealed disagreements between both types of analyzes. Of these, 11 SSRs were polymorphic in silico and
monomorphic in PCR analysis in the lab, whereas 9
markers were monomorphic in silico and polymorphic
by wet-lab PCR assays. Among the evaluated SSRs that
were polymorphic in silico and empirically (306

Genome-wide analysis of simple sequence repeats,
coupled with information on their distribution in coding
and non-coding regions may provide insights into
possible roles of SSRs in gene regulation and genome
organization, and provide abundant markers for genetic,
genomic and evolutionary studies. In this study, we analyzed the distribution and frequency of perfect microsatellites with motifs of 2-8 bp long and minimum of 3
repeat units in the assembled cucumber Gy14 genomic
DNA sequences representing 55% of its genome, as well
as in datasets of EST sequences. It was found that
microsatellites contributed significantly to the assembled
cucumber genome (~0.9% of the 367 Mbp cucumber
genome). A general negative correlation between genome size and SSR density in plants has been reported
[19]. Our data in cucumber agrees with this general
trend. Having a genome size roughly comparable to that
of rice (370-490 Mbp) [46], poplar (485 Mbp) [47], and
grapevine (487 Mbp) [48], cucumber (367 Mbp) [44]
had an SSR density similar to these species, whereas
they all had a higher repeat density compared to the larger genome of sorghum (818 Mbp) [49] and soybean
1,115 Mbp) [44], such difference being ~4 fold higher
when compared to the large 2,365 Mbp genome of
maize (120 SSRs/Mbp), and the 1,000 Mbp chromosome
3B of wheat (163 SSRs/Mbp) [50]. Arabidopsis thaliana
deviates from this general trend, since its 157 Mbp genome, the smallest in our dataset, harbors an SSR density
(370.5 SSRs/Mbp) substantially smaller than densities
found in plant species with twice (e.g., rice) and three
times (e.g., poplar, grapevine) larger genomes.

Differences in SSR density between genomic and the
EST sequences of cucumber and other species were
found (Table 1). In cucumber genomic DNA, microsatellites are present at a higher density than in coding
regions (1.2-1.5 and ~ 1.3 fold higher compared to
clustered and bulk ESTs, respectively). Among all the
species, cucumber, poplar, and grapevine had a 1.2 to
2.0-fold higher repeat density in genomic compared to
EST sequence, whereas the opposite was found for soybean, rice and sorghum, which had 1.2 to 2.0-fold
higher density in ESTs than in genomic data. SSR density was nearly equal in both sequence datasets for Medicago and Arabidopsis (Table 1). These results partially
contradict those of Morgante et al. (2002) [19] reporting
a higher microsatellite frequency in transcribed
sequences than in genomic DNA of five plant species.
Conversely, Mun et al. (2006) [51] reported that four of
the five plant species examined by them had 1.3 to 2.8fold higher SSR frequency in genomic than in bulk EST
sequences. More broadly, Toth et al. (2000) [3] examined SSR frequencies in several eukaryotic organisms
ranging from yeast to primates including Arabidopsis
thaliana as a plant representative, and reported higher
overall SSR density in intergenic regions and introns as
compared to exons in all the taxa investigated. Variations inherent to the genomes examined in these studies

may account for large part of the observed differences.
However, some of these differences may also be due to
variations in the search parameters and algorithms used
for detection of microsatellites in DNA sequence, as
well as differences in the type and size of the data sets
used. For example, the higher repeat density found in
ESTs compared to genomic sequence by Morgante et al.
(2002) [19] was suggested to be due to a bias in the estimation of frequencies due to the small data set used
[51]. However, additional factors are more likely to contribute to the different results obtained by Morgante et
al. (2002) [19] and Mun et al. (2006) [51]. For example,
different repeat types (mono- to pentanucleotides versus
mono- to octanucleotides) of different minimum lengths
(12 bp and 3 repeat units, versus only 12 bp) were
searched using different software. Significant variation
has been found among algorithms used for SSR detection [52]. Toth et al. (2000) [3] used custom Perl scripts
to detect mono- to hexanucleotide SSRs of at least 12
bp and two repeat units, and expressed the results in bp
of repeats/Mbp of sequence (instead of count/Mbp).
These seemingly minor differences in procedure can
strongly influence microsatellite distributions and
impede direct comparison among studies. For example,
in the present study, the density of hexanucleotides ranged from 13 to 56 per Mbp across genomic and EST

Cavagnaro et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:569
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/569

sequences of all species (representing 4-12% of the total
SSRs), whereas data from Mun et al. (2006) [51] showed
that hexanucleotides < 19 bp long were the most frequent repeat type in genomic and EST data, with densities ranging from 597 to 1,015 hexamers/Mbp,
representing a 2.1 to 6.9-fold increase in repeat density
compared to mono-, di-, tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotides. Such extraordinary differences are mainly due to
the fact that we considered a minimum of 12 bp and 3
repeat units per SSR, whereas 12 bp (regardless of the
number of repeat units) was the cutoff for minimum
SSR length in Mun et al. (2006) [51]. Therefore, while
we discarded hexamers of 2 repeats (12 bp), they were
kept in analyses by Mun et al. (2006) [51]. Because the
majority of hexanucleotides occur in the form of two
repeated units, these SSRs outweighed other types of
repeats, increasing also the overall SSR density in their
study. This was confirmed by the fact that when we
repeated the analysis using 2 repeat units (instead of 3)
as the minimum length, we obtained similar values as
reported by Mun et al. (2006) [51]. For example, hexanucleotide density was 845, 727, and 801 repeats/Mbp
for cucumber, Arabidopsis and rice, respectively (data
not shown). The fact that abundant hexanucleotides
with only two repeat units occur in most genomes is
also reflected in the data presented by Toth et al. (2000)
[3]. Although hexamers with 2 repeat units = 12 bp
were also included in their analysis, because SSR frequencies were expressed as ‘total SSR length/Mbp’
(instead of number of SSRs/Mbp), the mostly-short hexamer repeats only accounted for ~ 10% (mean from all
taxonomic groups; with 6.6% for plants) of the total SSR
content. This result by Toth et al. (2000) [3] is in good
agreement with calculations for hexanucleotide frequencies relative to other repeat types from the present
study. Our criterion for selecting a minimum of three
repeat units per SSR was based on the fact that polymorphism levels and mutation rate correlate positively
with the number of repeat units [53], and therefore,
more useful polymorphic markers are expected to be
developed from these SSR loci. The above considerations point to the importance of critically examining
microsatellite frequency data, especially when such data
was generated by different research groups and is
intended for comparison purposes.
Trinucleotide repeats prevailed in protein-coding
sequences of cucumber and all other species. An overrepresentation of trinucleotides in protein-coding
sequences has been previously reported for several
plants species [19,51,54-56], as well as in a range of
other eukaryotes including humans and insects
[3,18,57]. Although together with trinucleotides some
reports also indicated a predominance of hexanucleotides in protein-coding sequences [3,18,51], this has not

Page 12 of 18

been consistently reported due to differences in the program parameters and criteria used for microsatellite
detection, as discussed above. The relative abundance of
trinucleotides over other SSR types has been attributed
to negative selection against frame-shift mutations in
the coding regions and positive selection for specific single amino-acid stretches [19].
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, within a given type of
SSR there may be striking differences in the frequency
of individual repeat motifs, within and between
sequence datasets (genomic and EST) of a species. In
cucumber, the base composition of the SSR motifs is
strongly biased towards A’s and T’s in both EST and
genomic data. For example, the density of the dinucleotide AT was > 1,400-fold higher than CG in genomic
sequence (CG dimers were absent in bulk EST data),
whereas AT dimers were also much more frequent (3.5
fold) in genomic compared to EST data. Similarly, in
the case of trinucleotide repeats more than a 40-fold
difference in density between the most frequent (AAT)
and the least frequent (CCG) motifs was found in
cucumber genomic sequence, whereas such difference
was > 1,200-fold between the most (AAAT) and least
(CCGG) frequent tetranucleotide motifs (Additional file
1, Table S2).
AT-rich repeats prevail in dicot species, including
cucumber, but not in monocots. These differences may
be explained, at least partially, by the relative nucleotide
composition of their genomes (the average GC content
in genomic sequence of dicots and monocots is 34.6%
and 43.7%, respectively). However, these differences cannot explain, per se, the dramatic variation in the frequency observed for some particular motifs between
both groups of plants. Most noticeably, genomic
sequence of rice and sorghum had, on average, a 56-fold
higher density of CCG trinucleotides compared to the
average density for this repeat in dicots. Other motifs
common in monocots but relatively rare in dicots were
ACG, AGG, AGC, AGCT, AGGT, CCCG, CCGG,
ACGT, and CCGCG. Whether these differences in base
composition of microsatellite motifs played any role
during specialization of monocots and dicots, is
unknown.
SSR polymorphism between Gy14 and 9930 cucumbers

Although both slippage of the DNA polymerase and
unequal crossing-over have been proposed as possible
mechanisms for microsatellite evolution, the first
mechanism, which generates gains or losses of one or a
few repeat unit(s), accounts for most of the mutations
in microsatellites [58,59]. Our in silico pair-wise comparisons between 9930 and Gy14-derived alleles at 1,006
SSR loci allowed us to gain insights into possible relationships between the degree of polymorphism and

Cavagnaro et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:569
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/569

particular features of cucumber microsatellites. We
observed that longer alleles of 9930 (i.e., alleles with larger number of repeat units) showed a higher frequency
of contractions in the corresponding Gy14 alleles, than
short alleles of 9930. Despite the arbitrary assignment of
an ‘initial’ state of the SSR, these results suggest that
long repeats are more prone to decrease in size than are
shorter ones. A similar trend was found in human [60]
and yeast [61] microsatellites, with long alleles tending
to mutate to shorter lengths more often than short
alleles. Assuming that within-locus variations in repeat
length are mainly due to mutations representing small
changes in repeat number [62,63], large differences in
allele sizes (Δal) from 9930 and Gy14 suggest that these
loci have higher mutation rates and are more polymorphic than loci with small Δal values. Indeed, the significant correlation found between the number of repeat
units in the SSR and Δal suggests a positive relationship
between mutation rate, polymorphism and repeat length
for these cucumber SSRs. This result is consistent with
earlier studies showing positive and significant relationships between repeat length and mutation rate in
human [53], fruit fly [64], and yeast [61] microsatellites.
However, the strength of this association varies depending on the type of repeats. Data from human, mouse,
fruit fly, and yeast microsatellites indicate that polymerase slippage rates are highest in dinucleotides, followed
by tri-, and tetranucleotides [61,65]. Concordantly with
these data, in the present study, the strongest relationship between Δal and repeat length in cucumber was
found in dinucleotides, and the frequency of dinucleotide repeats was 3 times higher among polymorphic
SSRs than among monomorphic SSRs (Table 2). In
addition, dinucleotide AT-rich repeats were more polymorphic than AT-poor dinucleotides, as indicated by
their Δal mean values and their relative frequencies in
the polymorphic SSR dataset (36.2% for AT-rich versus
9.7% for AT-poor dinucleotides, data not shown),
although such differences were not found in other
cucumber SSRs. According to Schlötterer and Tautz
(1992) [45] sequences with a high AT content are particularly unstable.
In this study, most SSR alleles from 9930 showed
length contractions in the corresponding Gy14 alleles
(the mean number of repeat units/SSR was 15.4 and 5.3
for 9930 and Gy14, respectively). We speculate that this
is due to a bias in the selection of the SSR loci analyzed,
rather than because of differences in SSR mutation rates
between the two genotypes. Because, typically, during
SSR marker development, there is reiterative selection
for larger repeats. That is, library screening methods for
SSR isolation are designed to yield a higher proportion
of long SSRs. Once SSR sequences are obtained, the larger repeat tracks are -preferentially- used for designing

Page 13 of 18

primers, which are then pre-screened for their polymorphism. Thus, the most polymorphic loci are selected
for further utilization (because there is a positive relationship between SSR length and polymorphism [53,61],
there is selection for large repeat tracks at this stage
too). The markers developed by Ren et al [38] represent
a biased selection towards those SSRs with the most
repeat motif numbers in 9930 and, therefore, are likely
to harbor shorter repeats in Gy14. Indeed, these SSRs
were originally selected -from genomic DNA sequence
of 9930- on the basis of their longest motifs, and had an
average repeat length of 39.4 bp [38]. Following this
argument, the inverse scenario -i.e., SSR markers developed from the longest repeats of Gy14- should reveal
shorter alleles in 9930, compared to Gy14. To test this
hypothesis we mined the Gy14 genome sequence for
microsatellites with motif lengths > 30 bp, and searched
for the corresponding SSR loci in the 9930 genome
sequence, and -for each locus- the motifs from Gy14
and 9930 were compared. A total of 323 Gy14 SSRs,
with correspondences in the 9930 genome, were found,
of which 316 SSRs (97.8%) had longer alleles in Gy14
compared to 9930, 1 SSR (0.3%) was longer in 9930,
and 6 SSRs (1.9%) had same allele length in both genomes (data not presented). These results strongly support our previous hypothesis regarding an ascertainment
bias -rather than differential SSR mutation rate- as the
cause for the differences in repeat lengths found in 9930
and Gy14. The effects of such biases, have been well
illustrated in several eukaryotes by Ellegren et al. [66,67]
and Fitzsimmons et al [68], demonstrating that repeat
lengths tend to be longer in the species from which
markers were developed.
A total of 660 SSRs evaluated in silico were validated by
PCR and gel electrophoresis. The experimental results
were largely consistent with the in silico PCR data. However, a small fraction (20 of 660, 3%) of the markers
showed different allele size and/or number of alleles
compared to the corresponding in silico results. Potential
sources of errors that may account for these discrepancies include PCR artifacts (e.g., non-specific amplifications, preferential amplification of one allele over
another, etc.), post amplification gel-electrophoresis artifacts (e.g., secondary conformations and heteroduplexes,
etc.), or errors in the estimation of amplicons size by us
(this work) or by Ren et al. [38]. Errors in sequencing
and/or assembly of the 9930 genome also seem possible.
Indeed, we sequenced the Gy14 and 9930 PCR products
from those SSRs that were polymorphic in silico but
empirically monomorphic, and found that the repeat
numbers of the SSR motifs in 9930 genome were not the
same as shown in the draft genome (data not shown).
Consistent with results from our in silico analysis, the
microsatellite experimental data revealed larger alleles in

Cavagnaro et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:569
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/569

9930 compared to Gy14 for most SSRs tested (62.4% of
all polymorphic SSRs), thus providing empirical support
for our hypothesis regarding a bias due to a prior selection of larger microsatellite loci in 9930.
Utilization of new SSR resources for cucumber research

The high frequency of microsatellites found in cucumber genomic sequence compared to other plant species
examined (Table 1) was unexpected. Due to the nature
of the algorithms used for assembling sequence reads
into contigs and scaffolds, the Gy14 assembly used in
our analysis most likely corresponds to the single/low
copy fraction of the genome (the left-aside unassembled
sequence reads, presumably, represent most of the repetitive fraction). Thus, a possible explanation for the relative abundance of microsatellites in cucumber may rely
on the fact that we analyzed the single/low copy portion
of the cucumber genome. Given the nonrandom distribution of SSRs in plant genomes, predominating in nonrepetitive sequences [19,54], it is possible that our data
may represent an overestimate of the overall SSR density
in the cucumber genome, since it was generated mainly
from non-redundant genomic sequences.
The fact that ~48.3% of the SSR markers tested in silico
were polymorphic between Gy14 and 9930 was also
unexpected, considering that previous studies indicate
3-20% polymorphism at the DNA level within Cucumis
sativus [25-27,41,42]. Most likely, this reflects the same
situation discussed previously: markers selected for being
highly polymorphic in 9930 will produce amplicons of
different and shorter size in Gy14. Although these markers may be useful for fingerprinting and mapping, their
use for estimating levels of genetic diversity in cucumber
germplasm collections would provide an overestimate of
the overall genetic diversity. To avoid this ascertainment
bias and be able to achieve a representative picture of the
genome-wide variation among germplasm, one should
compare markers from both genotypes without previous
selection. The recently finished genome sequences of
9930 and Gy14 provide an unprecedented opportunity
for this type of analysis. Thus, genome-wide comparisons
of simple sequence repeats or SNPs between 9930 and
Gy14, may provide an unbiased picture of the overall
DNA polymorphism in cucumber.
Due to the scarcity of highly polymorphic, user-friendly
molecular markers in cucumber and other cucurbit
crops, high-density genetic maps were not available until
very recently [38]. Thus, most linkage maps with important trait loci have been developed with primarily lowthroughput, anonymous, dominant markers such as
RFLPs, RAPDs or AFLPs [28-31], making them difficult
in applications like map-based cloning, and makerassisted selection. Indeed, to date, only one economically
important gene has been cloned in cucumber through

Page 14 of 18

the map-based cloning strategy (e.g., [69]), suggesting
that marker assisted breeding in this species is still
underdeveloped compared to some other horticultural
crops (e.g., tomato). In the present study, we designed
primer pairs for more than 80,000 non-redundant (single
copy) cucumber microsatellites, and provide their exact
positions in the Gy14 genome assembly. In addition, correspondences between these markers and those developed by Ren et al (2009) [38] were indicated (Table S5 in
Additional files 2 and 3). This very large set of potential
microsatellite markers, distributed throughout the genome, will facilitate the development of high-resolution
maps for positional gene-cloning and detailed comparative mapping, among other applications.

Conclusions
The current work has contributed to a detailed characterization of microsatellites in cucumber and their comparison to that of model species. The cucumber genome was
found to be relatively rich in microsatellites, and polymorphism in comparing two cucumber inbreds was
unexpectedly high, despite its distinctness as a species
with low genetic diversity. Tetranucleotide repeats were
the most frequent SSRs in the genome, with the dinucleotide ‘AT’ being the most common single motif. ESTs
of cucumber were less frequent in microsatellites compared to genomic sequence, with trinucleotides strongly
predominating in the formers. AT-rich motifs prevailed
in both genomic and EST data. Using an electronic PCR
strategy, we compared SSR amplicons from two cucumber genotypes. A surprisingly high percentage of polymorphic markers was found (~48%), with dinucleotides
being the most polymorphic repeats. Our in silico analysis revealed a positive relationship between SSR polymorphism and the number of repeat units, a trend
previously reported in other organisms. In addition, the
data presented here increase the genomic resources available in cucumber by adding a large set (83,472) of microsatellite primers designed from microsatellite loci that
are precisely located in the Gy14 assembly. These
markers may facilitate a number of genetic and genomic
studies in Cucumis, including anchorage of the sequence
scaffolds to the genetic map, development of high-resolution linkage maps, positional gene-cloning, and comparative mapping in other cucurbit crops.
Methods
Source of genomic and transcript sequences

Gy14 is a gynoecious, inbred, classical North American
pickling cucumber line with multiple disease resistance
and superior horticultural characteristics. The genome
sequencing of Gy14 was performed with the Roche 454
GS FLX Titanium platform at 36× genome coverage
with combined shotgun (24×) and multi-span paired

end (3-kb at 9× and 20-kb at 3×) de novo sequencing
strategies. Using the Newbler assembler software version
2.3 (454 Life Sciences), high quality sequence reads were
assembled into 4,219 scaffolds ranging in size from 500
bases to 6.9 Mbp with an average of 48,129 bases per
scaffold. The assembled sequences, which totaled
203,052,159 bases, were used in this study to characterize the distribution of microsatellites in the cucumber
genome. The completeness of the 203 Mbp assembly is
supported by the mapping of over 99% of ~2 million
EST reads (generated using 454-XLR technology) from
Gy14 leaf and root tissues. The assembled Gy14 genome
(4,219 scaffolds) and transcriptome are publicly accessible through http://cucumber.vcru.wisc.edu/ (BLAST
searchable). The annotated Gy14 genome is accessible
through the US Department of Energy’s Joint Genome
Institute (USDOE JGI) database at http://www.phytozome.net/cucumber.php#A.
For comparison purposes, the complete genome
sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana L., rice (Oryza sativa
L.), grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), and poplar (Populus trichocarpa L.) were downloaded from the National Center
for Biotechnology (NCBI) database (GSS Section). The
recently finished sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) genome
sequence was downloaded from the USDOE-JGI database. In addition, 243 and 110 Mbp of genomic
sequences from soybean (Glycine max L.) and Medicago
truncatula, respectively, were also downloaded from
NCBI-GSS. Soybean and Medicago were included in the
study because they represent more closely related taxa
to cucumber, as they belong to the Fabaceae family,
order Fabales, the latter being a sister clade to the
Cucurbitales, within the Eurosids I [70].
As a source of transcript sequences we used plant
gene indices of The Institute of Genome Research
(TIGR), which are up-to-date non-redundant (unigenes)
EST collections [71]. Thus, gene indices of Arabidopsis
(74.8 Mbp), poplar (67.6 Mbp), grapevine (81.4 Mbp),
Medicago (51.9 Mbp), soybean (51.3 Mbp), rice (158.2
Mbp) and sorghum (32.4 Mbp) were downloaded from
the Gene Index databases (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.
edu/tgi/plant.html) and searched for SSRs. Gene indices
for cucumber were not available. Instead, we used 3 sets
of cucumber ESTs for mining microsatellites including
two clustered EST datasets; an 18.8Mbp-set from flower
organ of cucumber inbred line WI 1983 [72] (Cucurbit
Genomic Database, CuGenDB, http://www.icugi.org/)
and a 42.1 Mbp-set from Gy14 root and leaf tissues
(accessible from http://cucumber.vcru.wisc.edu/); and a
bulk EST dataset from WI 1983 (63.7 Mbp; CuGenDB).
Detailed information about the databases used for the
present study is provided in Additional file 1, Table S1.

Detection of SSRs and primer design

Although SSRs are commonly defined as repeats of 1- to
6-bp motifs [1], in this work we also analyzed repeats
with 7- and 8-bp motifs, whereas mononucleotides were
not considered due to the difficulty of distinguishing
bona fide microsatellites from sequencing or assembly
error (these biases are more common in whole genome
shotgun sequence data), and because (A/T)n repeats in
EST sequences may be confused with polyadenylation
tracks. Thus, DNA sequences were searched for perfect
microsatellites, with a basic motif of 2-8 bp, using the
computer program MISA (MIcroSAtellite identification
tool) [73]. Repeats with a minimum length of 12 (for dito tetranucleotides), 15 (for pentanucleotides), 18 (for
hexanucleotides), 21 (for heptanucleotides), and 24 bp
(for octanucleotides) were recorded.
The positions of the SSRs found in the Gy14 genome
assembly (scaffolds) were recorded, and oligonucleotide
primers were designed for the genomic sequence flanking these SSRs using Primer3 (v. 1.1.4) software [74].
Primers were designed to generate amplicons of 100400 bp in length (optimum 250 bp) with the following
minimum, maximum and optimum values for Primer3
parameters: primer length (bp): 18-25-30; Tm (°C): 5760-63; GC content (%): 30-40-60. Other parameters
used the program default values.
In silico analysis of SSR polymorphisms and experimental
verification

The draft genome of the Chinese fresh market cucumber inbred line 9930 was recently released [37] (available
at http://cucumber.genomics.org.cn/). From the 3× coverage Sanger shotgun sequence assembly of the 9930
genome, 2,112 microsatellite primer pairs with the longest repeats were designed and 966 of them were mapped
[38]. In the present study, we used these SSR markers,
with the exception of mononucleotides (13 SSRs), to
investigate polymorphism level at microsatellite loci of
cucumber. Using an in silico PCR (virtual PCR) strategy,
2,099 pairs of primer sequences from 9930 were mapped
onto the Gy14 sequence scaffolds and the genomic
sequence delimited by each primer pair (i.e., by the forward and reverse primers of each SSR) was extracted,
analyzed, and annotated for the presence and type of
microsatellite repeat and its sequence length. This was
performed with a custom Perl script that used the NCBI
BLASTN program as a search engine with expect value
of 10 and no filtering. We allowed up to 5 nucleotide
mismatches at the 5’ end of the primer but no mismatches at the 3’ end, and a minimum of 80% overall

Cavagnaro et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:569
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/569

match homology. The program extracted products
between 100 and 2000 bp. For a given primer pair, we
considered that a specific amplicon was generated if
both forward and reverse primers were mapped to the
same scaffold, within a region of 4 kb, and they flanked
an SSR with the same basic motif as the expected one
in 9930. The specific in silico-generated amplicons from
Gy14 were compared with the expected amplicon size
from 9930 according to Ren et al. (2009) [38], and their
size differences were recorded. On the basis of these
size differences, the SSRs were classified as polymorphic
if amplicons from Gy14 and 9930 varied in at least 2 bp,
or monomorphic if both amplicons were of identical
size. SSR loci with 1-bp difference were considered
ambiguous and were removed from the analysis. The
polymorphic and monomorphic SSR datasets were analyzed in more detail with MISA.
To experimentally validate the in silico PCR results,
we synthesized primers for 660 SSRs (317 polymorphic
and 343 monomorphic based on in silico results) and
performed PCR amplification with genomic DNAs from
9930 and Gy14 as the templates. Seeds of cucumber
inbred line 9930 were kindly provided by Prof. XingFang Gu (Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China). For
PCR amplification, genomic DNAs of Gy14 and 9930
were extracted from newly expanded young leaves using
the CTAB method [75]. Each reaction contained 20 ng
template DNA, 0.5 μM each of two primers, and 1×
PCR master mix (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD, USA) in
a total volume of 10.0 μl. A single, touchdown PCR program [76] was employed. The PCR products were
resolved with 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) and visualized with silver staining.
