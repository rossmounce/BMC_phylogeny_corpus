Abstract
Background: We carried out an analysis of intron length conservation across a diverse group of nineteen
mammalian species. Motivated by recent research suggesting a role for time delays associated with intron
transcription in gene expression oscillations required for early embryonic patterning, we searched for examples
of genes that showed the most extreme conservation of total intron content in mammals.
Results: Gene sets annotated as being involved in pattern specification in the early embryo or containing the
homeobox DNA-binding domain, were significantly enriched among genes with highly conserved intron content.
We used ancestral sequences reconstructed with probabilistic models that account for insertion and deletion
mutations to distinguish insertion and deletion events on lineages leading to human and mouse from their last
common ancestor. Using a randomization procedure, we show that genes containing the homeobox domain
show less change in intron content than expected, given the number of insertion and deletion events within their
introns.
Conclusions: Our results suggest selection for gene expression precision or the existence of additional
development-associated genes for which transcriptional delay is functionally significant.

Introduction
One of the salient features of eukaryotic genomes is
the pervasive presence of introns, comprising up to
95% of transcribed primary protein-coding sequences
in mammals [1]. The functions, origins and evolutionary trajectory of introns have long been of great interest in genomics and genome evolution. Although some
theories of the spread of introns postulate that they
can accumulate passively as a consequence of insufficient purifying selection to remove them in organisms
with relatively low effective population sizes [2,3],
introns have been shown to play a number of functional roles [4]. They give rise to the possibility of

alternative splicing, contributing to the diversity of biomolecules, and they can also have a substantial impact
on levels of gene expression [5-7]. Introns contain
most of the sequence features required for splicing (5’
and 3’ splice sites, branch point sites (BPS), poly-pyrimidine tracts and various intronic splicing elements).
Many introns also contain functional non-coding
RNAs [4], which can play critical roles in fine-tuning
gene expression [8]. Lastly, introns have been proposed
to control the timing of gene expression by delaying
transcription [9].
Negative feedback loops with a time delay can result
in oscillating patterns of gene expression, which can be
exploited by living organisms as biological time-keeping
devices. This appears to be particularly important in
development [9]. The hairy and enhancer of split 7
(Hes7) gene is involved in the control of somite

formation through oscillatory patterns of gene expression [10]. Recently, Takashima et al.[11] investigated in
vivo the impact of removing the introns from the mouse
Hes7 gene. They found that expression of the mutant
Hes7 gene occurred approximately 19 minutes earlier
than for the wild-type and that this reduction in gene
expression delay resulted in abolition of oscillations and
segmentation defects. Given that the delay associated
with transcribing introns appears to play a crucial role
in the functioning of this gene, the length of the introns
may be evolving under purifying selective pressure.
Moreover, further examples of genes with highly conserved intron content across species may reveal more
genes for which transcriptional delay is an important
aspect of gene regulation. We investigated the conservation of the intron content of Hes7 across a diverse set of
nineteen mammals and carried out a search for other
genes for which total intron length shows evidence of
evolutionary conservation. In such cases introns are
likely to play an important functional role and, in a subset, time delays associated with transcribing introns may
be a significant aspect of gene regulation.

Results and discussion
Delayed expression of Hes7 resulting, at least in part,
from intron transcription has been proposed to play a

key role in somite formation in animal embryos by
establishing an oscillating pattern of gene expression
[11-14]. Given the important role played by the length
of the introns rather than their specific sequence content in this gene, we compared the combined length of
Hes7 introns across a diverse set of mammalian species
(Fig. 1) to determine the extent to which the intron content of this gene is conserved over evolutionary time.
For each orthologue, the sum of the distances between
successive exons in the canonical transcript (according
to Ensembl) was calculated. Despite the fact that there
may be differences in gene annotation across species the
intron content of most of the orthologues was similar.
Nine out of the twelve of the available orthologues of
Hes7 among the mammalian species in our dataset differed in combined intron length from the human gene
by less than 10% (Table 1).
To determine whether intron content, and thus potentially transcription time, of Hes7 was exceptionally conserved compared to other genes and to discover
additional examples of genes for which there is evidence
of intron content conservation we compared intron content (defined as the sum of the lengths of all introns in
the canonical transcript) between human gene models
from Ensembl and sets of orthologous genes, obtained
from OrthoDB [15]. Because the pattern of insertion

Cumulative intron length

and deletion may differ between very large and smaller
introns we restricted to genes with introns of similar
lengths to Hes7 (specifically we considered genes for
which the sum of the intron lengths in the canonical
transcript was between one and five kilobases). Restricting also to orthologous groups represented in at least
half of the species, only 11 other orthologous groups
(from a total of 1875 satisfying these criteria) had intron
content within 10% of the human gene in as high a proportion of the orthologues as the Hes7 group. Remarkably, of the corresponding 12 human genes (including
Hes7), five are annotated with the gene ontology (GO)
term GO:0007389 (pattern specification process) from
the biological process component of GO, defined as
“any developmental process that results in the creation
of defined areas or spaces within an organism to which
cells respond and eventually are instructed to differentiate”. Using the DAVID functional annotation tool
[16,17], this is the most statistically enriched GO term
(p = 9.4 × 10–5) and remains significant following correction for multiplicity of testing using the BenjaminiHochberg method (FDR = 0.03). Six of the genes were
annotated with the Swissprot and Protein Information
Resource (SP-PIR) keywords term ‘developmental protein’ (FDR = 0.003).
We also used a more relaxed conservation threshold
and identified a larger set of 144 genes with relatively
conserved intron content among the genes with
between one and five kilobases of intron. Genes for
which more than 50% of the orthologues have intron
content within 10% of the intron content of the
human member of the group were included in this
group, again restricting to orthologue groups

represented in at least half of the species. We again
found evidence for a set of genes with conserved
intron content which was very highly enriched for
genes involved in development, identified using
DAVID (Table 2). Only the top 20 enriched terms are
shown in Table 2. These include terms corresponding
to the presence of homeobox DNA-binding domains,
frequently involved in developmental gene regulation.
To look for examples of conserved intron content
among genes with higher intron content, we separated
the human genes into four intron content size classes
(1 – 5 kb, 5 – 20 kb, 20 – 50 kb and 50 – 100 kb), to
account, to some extent, for the fact that patterns of
intron length evolution may differ between genes with
larger versus smaller introns. The proportion of genes
from the other size classes (other than size class one,
discussed above) that showed evidence of conserved
intron content was smaller and we found no evidence
for enrichment for the default DAVID gene sets (after
multiplicity correction).
Intronic insertions and deletions along lineages leading
to human and mouse

To investigate evolution of intron length through insertion and deletion in greater detail we considered
changes in intron length along the human and mouse
lineages following divergence from their last common
ancestor. Genomic sequences at ancestral nodes of the
mammalian phylogeny were obtained from Ensembl.
These sequences were inferred using a probabilistic
method that has been shown to have high accuracy for
the inference of insertion and deletion events. We
mapped insertion and deletion events to introns.

Conservation of intron content could result from the
absence of insertion and deletion events or from balance
between insertion and deletion. For the 11 genes that
showed as much conservation as Hes7 across the mammalian panel, we found qualitative support for both
effects. The total amount of insertion and deletion was
lower in these genes but there were also some genes
with substantial insertion and deletions in balance (Fig.
2). This was particularly evident in the case of indels
along the lineage leading to mouse, however, as these
genes were selected on the basis of their conservation in
a panel that included humans and mouse this result
should be considered to be illustrative only.
We also identified the complete set of genes in size class
one that were annotated with a homeobox domain by
Interpro [18]. To investigate whether the change in intron
content since the common ancestor of human and mouse
was less than expected, given the inferred numbers of
indels we used a randomization procedure (described in
Data and methods). We applied this procedure to the set
of homeobox domain proteins and found that the change
in intron content of these genes along both the human
and mouse lineages was far less than expected, given the
number of indels inferred to have occurred in each lineage
and under the null assumption that the ratio of insertions
and deletions and size distribution of these events did not
differ for these genes compared to the rest of genes in the
size class. In the case of human, the mean absolute change

in intron content was 450 bp per gene, whereas the median of this value in the randomized data was 846 bp per
gene. The randomized values were less than or equal to
the observed value in 87 of 10,000 randomizations (onetailed p = 0.009). In mouse the mean absolute change in
intron length was just 9 bp per gene. The median of this
quantity across randomizations was 398 bp per gene. The
values in the random data were lower than or equal to the
observed data in 33 of 10,000 randomizations (one-tailed
p = 0.003).
Contribution of conserved sequence elements to intron
length conservation

From our results it appears that there is selection to
prevent large changes in intron content in specific sets
of genes, notably in genes involved in development and
especially in early embryonic patterning. This selection
could result from the presence of cis or trans (e.g. noncoding RNAs) regulatory elements within introns of
these genes, which would be disrupted by insertions and
even more so by deletions. However, the presence of
regulatory elements would tend to increase the intron
length [19], yet we found good evidence for classes of
genes with well conserved intron content only among
the genes with lower intron content. To test the contribution of conserved functional elements within intronic
sequences on the conservation of intron content we
obtained conservaton scores, calculated using

Figure 2 Comparison of insertions and deletions The sum of the insertions and deletions that have taken place in genes in size class 1 along
the human (a) and mouse (b) lineages since divergence from their common ancestor. Blue points, corresponding to the genes that showed as
much or more intron content conservation than Hes7 are shown against a background of grey points, corresponding to all genes in the size
class. All axes are truncated, but the truncated axes include all of the blue points. Grey points lying with cumulative insertions or deletions
greater than 200 bp for human or 2000 bp for mouse are not shown.

phastCons, from the UCSC genome database. phastCons
scores for the intronic regions of Hes7 are shown as
figure 3. While there is evidence of functional elements,
these are relatively few and short and seem unlikely to
prevent changes in intron length over evolutionary time.
More quantitatively, we compared phastCons scores
(averaged across all intronic positions) between the 144
genes with evidence of conserved intron content and
the remainder of the genes in the smallest intron size
class. The difference in mean phastCons scores was not
significant (p = 0.33, Wilcoxon rank sum test). The difference in the proportion of conserved sites (phastCons
scores > 0.95) was also non-significant (p = 0.69), suggesting that a greater proportion of conserved intronic
functional elements is not the cause of the intron length
conservation in these genes.
To explain our observations, conservation acting on
functional elements would, perhaps, have to be balanced
with selection for rapid induction, as rapidly induced
genes have been shown to have short introns [20]. If the
conservation of intron content is a consequence of balance between conservation of intronic functional

elements and selection either for efficiency [21] or for
rapid induction, this balance appears to be particularly
significant for development-associated genes. For these
genes, expression precision at the critical developmental
junctures in which patterns are established in the developing embryo may be particularly crucial. An intriguing
role for introns that has recently gained experimental
support is in the establishment of oscillating patterns of
gene expression through the control of time delays in
expression [11]. These authors attributed a 19 minute
delay to the presence of introns. However, the introns
of Hes7 are relatively short (< 2 kb) and RNA polymerase II processes nucleotides at a rate in the order of 2
kb per minute [22,23]. This may suggest either the existence of other functional elements within the intron
that caused the delay in transcription or specific properties of the intron that result in an exceptionally slow
transcription rate.

Conclusion
Some theories of intron evolution have focussed on the
energy cost associated with introns. Reduced intron

Figure 3 phastCons scores across introns of the Hes7 gene

lengths in highly expressed genes were proposed to
result from selection for efficiency [21]. In support of
this model, greater selective efficiency associated with
larger effective population sizes of unicellular versus
multicellular organisms, is associated with shorter
introns [2,3]. Alternatively longer introns in highly and
ubiquitously expressed genes may be associated with
greater regulatory complexity and the preservation of
regulatory elements in introns [19]. Selection to reduce
energetic costs of transcription and for rapid induction
of some genes as well as selection to preserve regulatory
elements in highly regulated genes may all be important
factors for intron evolution. However, comparison of
genes with very conserved intron contents carried out
here, suggests that there may be a substantial number of
genes for which the size of the primary transcript is an
important and conserved feature. These genes are
enriched for key developmental processes, particularly

the establishment of early embryonic patterns. Since
time delays in gene induction have been shown to be
important for some such genes, we propose that selection to conserve transcription time is an important factor in the evolution of intron lengths, particularly in
development-associated genes. Our analysis involved a
combination of a heuristic examination of intron content across a panel of mammalian species and a statistical randomization approach, which does not take into
account all of the factors that may affect the fixation
probabilities of insertions and deletions in introns. A
better understanding of the evolution of intron sizes
through insertion and deletion requires the development
of evolutionary models of intron length evolution,
though this is challenging because of the diversity of
insertion and deletion events and the difficulty in modelling the constraints imposed by functional elements
within the introns on the occurrence and size

distribution of these events. If an appropriate model of
neutral evolution by insertion and deletion can be
derived, such a model could be used to identify and
quantify purifying selection acting on intron lengths
and, perhaps, to discover examples of positive selection
acting on changes in intron length over a phylogeny or
specific branches of a phylogenetic tree.

Data and methods
Complete sets of gene models were downloaded from
Ensembl release 62 [24] via BioMart for 19 mammalian
species. These were Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, Canis
familiaris, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, Equus caballus,
Erinaceus europaeus, Gorilla gorilla, Loxodonta africana,
Monodelphis domestica, Myotis lucifugus, Microcebus
murinus, Mus musculus, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Sus
scrofa, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus, Tarsius syrichta,
Tursiops truncatus, Vicugna pacos and Felis catus. Species were selected to sample a broad range of mammalian evolutionary history. A phylogenetic tree of these
taxa, obtained from the interactive tree of life [25,26] is
provided for illustrative purposes (Fig. 1). For each
Ensembl gene in each species we considered all annotated exons and calculated the total intronic content of
the gene as the sum of the gaps between non-overlapping successive exons in the canonical transcript associated with the gene. Genes were divided into four
classes, depending on the total intron content of the
gene (1 – 5 kb, 5 – 20 kb, 20 – 50 kb and 50 – 100 kb).
Orthologous groups of mammalian proteins were downloaded from OrthoDB [15]. We extracted the protein
identifiers from OrthoDB corresponding to each of the
mammalian species included in the study. Where more
than one protein from a species was included in the
same orthologous group, we selected one paralogue at
random. For each orthologous group, with a representative in at least half of the mammalian species considered
we determined the number of species in which the
intron content, as defined above, was within 10% of the
length of the intron content of the human gene. This
was done separately for genes in different intron content
classes. Functional analysis of genes with conserved
intron content was carried out using DAVID [16,17].
For each size class, the genes for which the intron content showed evidence of conservation was used as the
foreground set and the complete set of genes in the size
class was used as the background set.
Genomic multiple sequence ancestor alignments,
inferred using the Ensembl Enredo-Pecan-Ortheus pipeline [27], were downloaded from the comparative genomics section of the Ensembl FTP site. Insertions and
deletions were inferred for ancestral sequences included in
these alignments using a branch transducer method that
has been shown to achieve high accuracy [28]. This

allowed insertions and deletions to be placed on branches
of the mammalian phylogeny. For reconstructed insertion
and deletion events we focussed on the branches leading
from the common ancestor of the euarchontoglires (which
includes rodents and primates) to humans and mouse. All
insertion and deletion events occurring within introns (at
least 20 bp from exon-intron) boundaries were identified,
based on Ensembl gene models. In this case, intronic
indels were defined as indels that occur within the boundaries of the gene but not within 20 bp of any annotated
exon associated with the gene.
Randomization study of intron length evolution along the
human lineage

For each intron size class we used the complete set of
insertion and deletion events within the introns to define
the null expectation of events in that intron size class. To
test for evidence of purifying selection acting on the
intron content of a gene or a set of genes we considered
all of the insertion and deletion events in the gene(s)
under consideration and for each event sampled an insertion or deletion from the total set of events in the introns
of genes in that class. Given a set of insertions and deletions randomly sampled in this way we calculated the
change in intron content implied by this set of insertions
and deletions (sum of insertion lengths minus the sum of
the lengths of the deletions), separately along the human
and mouse lineages. This was repeated 10,000 times and
in each case the implied change in intron content in the
randomized data was compared to the change in intron
content, given the actual insertions and deletions inferred
to have occurred. The number of times the absolute
value of the change in intron content in the randomized
data was less than or equal to the absolute value of the
change in intron content in the observed data was used
to calculate a p-value, with a separate p-value calculated
for the human and mouse lineages. These p-values indicate the probability of observing as little or less variation
in the intron content of a gene or set of genes, given the
number of insertion and deletion events that have
occurred and under the assumption that these indel
events have the same distribution as events in other
genes in the same intron size class.
