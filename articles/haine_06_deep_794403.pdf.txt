Abstract
Background: Figs and fig-pollinating wasps are obligate mutualists that have coevolved for ca 90
million years. They have radiated together, but do not show strict cospeciation. In particular, it is
now clear that many fig species host two wasp species, so there is more wasp speciation than fig
speciation. However, little is known about how fig wasps speciate.
Results: We studied variation in 71 fig-pollinating wasps from across the large geographic range
of Ficus rubiginosa in Australia. All wasps sampled belong to one morphological species (Pleistodontes
imperialis), but we found four deep mtDNA clades that differed from each other by 9–17%
nucleotides. As these genetic distances exceed those normally found within species and overlap
those (10–26%) found between morphologically distinct Pleistodontes species, they strongly suggest
cryptic fig wasp species. mtDNA clade diversity declines from all four present in Northern
Queensland to just one in Sydney, near the southern range limit. However, at most sites multiple
clades coexist and can be found in the same tree or even the same fig fruit and there is no evidence
for parallel sub-division of the host fig species. Both mtDNA data and sequences from two nuclear
genes support the monophyly of the "P. imperialis complex" relative to other Pleistodontes species,
suggesting that fig wasp divergence has occurred without any host plant shift. Wasps in clade 3
were infected by a single strain (W1) of Wolbachia bacteria, while those in other clades carried a
double infection (W2+W3) of two other strains.
Conclusion: Our study indicates that cryptic fig-pollinating wasp species have developed on a
single host plant species, without the involvement of host plant shifts, or parallel host plant
divergence. Despite extensive evidence for coevolution between figs and fig wasps, wasp speciation
may not always be linked strongly with fig speciation.

Background
Hosts and their symbionts often have major effects on
each other's evolution. Indeed, many symbioses show
coevolution of key traits, such as parasite virulence and
host resistance and, in some cases, may also manifest
cospeciation. A classic example of a coevolved mutualism

is provided by the obligate relationship between fig trees
(Ficus species) and fig-pollinating wasps (Hymenoptera:Agaonidae). Female wasps enter receptive fig syconia
(inflorescences) via a narrow opening called the ostiole,
pollinate the flowers and lay their eggs inside developing
fig ovules. The fig wasp offspring develop and then mate

inside the syconium, before the next generation of
females disperses carrying pollen to other, receptive syconia. Agaonid wasps are the only vectors for fig pollen, and
fig syconia the only breeding ground for the wasps, making this an obligate association for both partners. As
expected, there are clear examples of coadaptation
between corresponding fig and pollinator traits (e.g. [15]).
There are over 750 species of figs worldwide [6] and most
have only one recorded pollinator species [4,7]. Similarly,
most wasp species have only one recorded fig host, leading to the famous 1:1 rule of reciprocal partner specificity.
Comparisons of the phylogenies of figs and fig wasps support a long history of co-radiation [8] and also show that
cospeciation has played a significant role [9]. However,
they do not support strict cospeciation, as is found in
some symbioses, such as that between aphids and Buchnera bacteria [10]. In addition, recent work has highlighted
biases against detecting cases that break the 1:1 specificity
rule [11] and revealed many cases where a single fig species hosts two (or occasionally more) pollinator species
[12-15]. It now appears that a substantial minority of fig
species have two or more co-pollinators [11,15]. In some
cases, they are largely allopatric, but in many they coexist
in sympatry [11,12,15].
In some cases, co-pollinators have been identified during
taxonomic revisions following extended field sampling
[13], while in others they were initially identified via surprising patterns of genetic variation within what was
thought to be a single wasp species [14]. Regardless of
how they are identified, co-pollinators have important
consequences. First, they change our view of host specificity and make coevolutionary dynamics more complex
[11,14,15]. Second, their coexistence in the same specialised niche poses a problem for ecological competition
theory [16]. Third, fig wasps provide a model system for
sex ratio studies and past work has involved accidental
pooling of members of two species [14,17].
The occurrence of co-pollinators raises the question of
how they evolved. They may be sister species that speciated on the current host plant, or less closely related
because one underwent a host-shift from another fig species. While host-shifting has been important in the radiation of many herbivorous insect taxa (e.g. [18-20]), it is
less clear how a fig-pollinating wasp might speciate without a host-shift or host plant speciation event. One potentially important agent is Wolbachia, an alphaproteobacterium that often causes reproductive incompatibilities between infected and uninfected hosts, or
between populations with different mutually incompatible infections. In theory, these can facilitate – or even
cause – host speciation [21-25]. Fig-pollinating wasps

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/83

have the highest known incidence of Wolbachia infection
for any insect taxon with ca. 70% of Australian and Panamanian species harbouring infections [26,27]. Interestingly, we have previously detected variation in infection
status in the fig wasp Pleistodontes imperialis during a wide
survey of fig wasp species [27].
Most previous studies of fig/pollinator specificity have
been either general literature surveys [7,28,29], or detailed
studies of a few species at one or a few sites (e.g. [13,14]).
These, respectively, revealed geographic variation in pollinator species and local coexistence of alternative pollinators. Here, we combined these two approaches by
studying one fig species (Ficus rubiginosa) with a large geographic range, and collecting many fig-pollinating wasps
(Pleistodontes imperialis) from several sites across that
range. We used sequences from four different genetic
markers – one mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and two
nuclear (28S and wingless) wasp genes and one Wolbachia
(wsp) gene to explore the genetic variation in P. imperialis
across the large geographic range of its host plant.
Ficus rubiginosa occurs naturally along the Eastern Coast of
Australia (roughly 2500 km North-South and up to 200
km inland) and is found in diverse habitats, including
rainforest, granite outcrops and rocky coastal areas (Fig. 1;
[30]). It is also commonly planted in parks and there are
introduced populations in other parts of Australia (e.g.
Adelaide and Melbourne), as well as in New Zealand [31],
Hawaii [32], California and Mediterranean Europe (JMC,
pers. obs.). In a recent taxonomic revision of species in
Ficus section Malvanthera, F. rubiginosa was considered to
have two forms with one difference: form rubiginosa has
leaves that are variously hairy, while form glabrescens [30]
lacks hairs. However, individual leaves of form rubiginosa
may also lack hairs. Form rubiginosa has a natural distribution from Cape York down the East Coast of Australia to
Southern New South Wales (NSW), while form glabrescens
has the same northern distribution, but does not extend
south into NSW (Fig. 1). Only one pollinator wasp species, Pleistodontes imperialis, has been recorded, despite
extensive sampling and a recent taxonomic revision of the
wasp genus [13], which led to the description of four new
Pleistodontes species from other fig species. Most P. imperialis females are black, but a yellow form is found around
Townsville in N. Queensland. Morphological analysis
revealed no clear differences, except for colour, and they
are considered to be the same species [13]. Pleistodontes
imperialis has not been recorded from any other fig species
[13].

introduced population in the USA (Table 1, Fig. 1). We
found 44 unique cytb haplotypes, 444 bp in length, of
which 139 (31.1%) nucleotide sites were polymorphic
and 107 (24.1%) parsimony-informative.
Forty-four P. imperialis sequences were used in phylogenetic analyses, together with sequences from 14 other
Pleistodontes species [33] and four Ceratosolen fig-pollinating wasp species [34] as outgroups. The MP (not shown)
and Bayesian phylogenies (Fig. 2) had very similar topologies, both supporting the monophyly of P. imperialis, but

dividing the species into four deep mitochondrial clades.
The (GTR) pairwise genetic distances between taxa fell
into two distinct groups: 1) distances within each of the
four P. imperialis clades (0–7%); and 2) distances between
P. imperialis clades (9–17%) and between morphologically distinguishable Pleistodontes species (10–26%). Consequently, the large genetic distances between the four P.
imperialis clades are similar to those between morphologically distinct Pleistodontes and indicate cryptic species.
There was one divergent P. imperialis sample, from which
three wasps grouped only weakly with the rest of clade 1

N = no. of wasps typed; - = not determined for this sample; cytb clade indicates into which of 4 major clades the cytb sequences fell, see main text
for further details; individuals were infected by three different Wolbachia strains, W1, W2 and W3; 28S sequences and wingless sequences each fell
into two groups, indicated here by I and II, and wgA and wgB, respectively.

(Figure 2). Based upon the commonly used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) clock rate of 2.3% pairwise divergence/Myr [35], clades 1 and 2 diverged from clades 3 and
4 at least 7.1 million years ago (MYA), clades 3 and 4 split
5.6 MYA and clades 1 and 2 split 4.4 MYA
Geographic distribution of Cytochrome B clades
The four cytb clades show different geographic distributions (Fig. 1). Clade 1 was found throughout the natural
range (Queensland (except Townsville) and New South
Wales (NSW)) of P. imperialis and was also the only clade
found outside the native range (in S. Australia, Victoria
and USA). Clade 2 was found only in the Townsville area
of Northern Queensland and contained all the yellow
wasps that are also restricted to this area. Clade 3 wasps
were found only in N. Queensland, while clade 4 was
found in N. and S. Queensland, but not in NSW. Overall,
clade diversity appears to decrease from North to South
(Fig. 1).

There is not, however, simple geographic replacement of
clades, as most sites in Queensland have two or more
clades present. For example, wasps collected from just five
trees near Townsville represent three of the four clades
(Table 1). In most cases, all individuals from one fig tree
belonged to the same clade. However, in three cases individuals from the same tree belonged to two different
clades (Table 1). Given that only 3–5 wasps were sampled
per fig tree, this suggests the frequent occurrence of wasps
from two or more clades in a single crop of fig fruits.
Wolbachia infections
All 71 wasps harboured Wolbachia, but some carried one
strain and others two. We obtained wsp sequences from 27
insects, revealing 6 with single and 21 with double infections (Table 1). The wsp sequences all belong to the Wolbachia A-clade, and revealed three strains (W1, W2 and
W3). W1 and W2 strains differed by a single synonymous
A/G substitution at position 268, while there was 8.5%

between W2 and W3. There was a highly consistent pattern between Wolbachia infection status and cytb clades.
Wasps in clade 3 had a single infection with W1, while
wasps from the other three clades all had both the W2 and
W3 infections. The single exception was one clade 2 wasp
that harboured only strain W2.
Nuclear sequence variation
We sequenced nuclear 28S (1033 bp) and wg (433 bp)
DNA fragments for 22 wasps representing the four cytb

clades (Table 1). The 28S data revealed two weakly supported clades (28S.I and 28S.II) that differed from each
other by 4–8 nucleotide substitutions, while there was a
maximum of 2 base differences between wasps within the
two clades (Fig. 3). 28S.II contains individuals from cytb
clade 4 only, while 28S.I individuals fall into cytb clades
1–3 (Table 2). Wg also divided the wasps into two clades
(wgA and wgB) and these differed from each other by a
single nucleotide substitution at a synonymous site (position 175) (0.23% nucleotide divergence). Group wgA
contained individuals from cytochrome b clade 3 only,

from eight outgroup taxa: four other Pleistodontes species
and four Ceratosolen species. Nucleotide divergence
ranged from 1.16% to 3.23% between morphologically
distinguishable Pleistodontes species and up to 16%
between genera. While there is no clear association
between 28S variation and Wolbachia infection, there is an
association of Wolbachia with genetic divergence of wg
between clade 3 (W1 infection; wgA) and clades 1, 2 and
4 (W2 and W3 infections; wgB). The overall correspondence of different markers is summarised in Table 2.

Discussion
Deep mtDNA divergences within "P. imperialis"
We have demonstrated that P. imperialis wasps fall into
four major mtDNA clades. These differ from each other by
9–17% nucleotides and are supported strongly by both
MP and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 2). These
deep divergences are very similar to those (10–26%)
found between morphologically distinct members of the
same genus [33]. The mtDNA genetic distances between
our clades are also slightly higher than those reported
between cryptic species of Pegoscapus fig-pollinating wasps
in Panama [14]. These deep divergences suggest strongly
the existence of four cryptic species within the morphologically defined P. imperialis.

We also showed that all wasps harboured Wolbachia bacteria and that clade 3 wasps had a different infection to all
other wasps. Wolbachia can influence both the diversity
and evolution of mtDNA and can maintain mtDNA divergences within or between populations of a species [36].
The best-studied example is Drosophila simulans which has
three distinct haplotypes [37] and is infected by at least
five strains of Wolbachia [38-43]. However, in this and
other cases where populations are polymorphic for Wolbachia infection (e.g. the gall wasp Biorhiza pallida [44])
the genetic distances between different haplotypes
(clades) are very much lower than we report here. Nevertheless, given the very high incidence of Wolbachia infec-

tions in fig-pollinating wasps [26,27], these
endosymbionts have probably played a role in host
mtDNA evolution and reduce confidence in the applicability of a general mtDNA clock.
Evidence against a role for host shifts
Two wasp species may co-occur on a single fig species if
one of them has shifted from another host fig. Indeed,
some mismatches between figs and wasps at deep phylogenetic levels suggest that host shifts have occurred at
times during their coevolutionary history [9,15]. In addition, there are cases of extant co-pollinators that are not
closely related species, suggesting more recent host shifts
(e.g. [14,34]. However, despite high genetic distances
between the four cytb clades, all three wasp genes
sequenced support the monophyly of the P. imperialis
complex relative to other Pleistodontes species. Consequently, it seems unlikely that any of our four clades has
shifted to F. rubiginosa from another Ficus species. In addition, we have not recorded P. imperialis from another fig
species, nor detected mitochondrial haplotype groups
shared by Pleistodontes wasps from different fig species
([33] and further unpublished data).
Evidence against parallel divergences of F. rubiginosa and
P. imperialis
Alternatively, the F. rubiginosa/P. imperialis species pair
could be in the process of cospeciation, with the partner
species diverging together. However, our existing data do
not support this notion and it is also difficult to envisage
how the fig species might split simultaneously into four
genetic units. We found that in most areas, and even some
individual trees, two or more wasp clades were present
(Table 1), despite limited within-site sampling. Furthermore, as part of a long-term survey in Townsville, we have
found that most F. rubiginosa syconia are entered by more
than one foundress and that yellow (clade 2) and black
wasps (clades 3 or 4 at this site) co-enter about 20% of
syconia (53/198 figs from 10 different trees over 2 years).
These results suggest that there is no simple segregation of
wasp clades between different host trees and that they co-

occur regularly in the same trees and even fruits, as
reported in Panama for cryptic species of Pegoscapus figpollinating wasps [14,17].
One possibility is that the different wasp clades predominate in different habitats and that the fig species is diverging into habitat-specific races. For example, in West Africa
Ficus ottonifolia occurs in a mosaic of forest and open habitats and has two pollinators. These co-occur locally, but
one predominates in open habitat patches and the other
in forest patches [12,45]. F. rubiginosa is also found in
both forest and open habitats and further sampling might
reveal a similar pattern. However, we believe that this is
unlikely as, for logistical reasons, almost all of our samples are from open habitats.
A further possibility is that the fig is diverging into two or
more races that are not habitat-specific. Indeed, Dixon et
al. (2001) recognised two forms of F. rubiginosa (see background). Most of our sampling was performed before the
description of these two forms, so we cannot yet compare
pollinators between the different forms. However, most of
our samples came from form rubiginosa, arguing against a
simple split by form. In addition, the only taxonomic
character that separates the two forms is the presence of
hairs on the leaves, which may well be a simple polymorphism that has no connection with the pollinators.
Finally, even if there is segregation by fig form, this can
only provide a partial answer since there are four wasp
clades, but only two fig forms. Clearly, genetic studies of
the figs are needed to test ideas further. However, we note
that recent genetic studies of wasps have revealed cryptic
species [14], but genetic studies of the corresponding figs
have not [8,15].
Wasp divergence without direct involvement of host plant
We argue above that there is no good evidence for either
parallel divergence of F. rubiginosa and P. imperialis, or for
recent host shifts by wasps. Fig wasp divergence might
instead occur following the development of spatial or
temporal barriers within a single wasp species. For example, temporary geographic isolation of wasp (and fig)
populations could occur for periods of time that allow the
evolution of reproductive isolation in the wasps, but not
the figs. Selection and/or genetic drift may be involved
and the approximately 100 times faster generation time of
the insects may facilitate their population divergences
[11]. Many scenarios are possible, but we suggest that the
role of Wolbachia deserves further study, since we have
detected infection differences and the acquisition of different Wolbachia infections in isolated populations can
facilitate or even cause speciation [23-25].

Correspondence of other markers with mtDNA clades
There is very little variation in the slower-evolving nuclear
genes studied. However, 28S sequences split the wasps
into two clades that correspond to cytb clades 1–3 and
clade 4, while wg also splits them into two groups, but corresponding to cytb clade 3 and clades 1, 2 and 4. Cytb clade
3 stands out further by differing in its Wolbachia infection
status. Consequently, three markers support isolation of
clade 3 from the others, and clade 4 differs from all others
on the basis of variation in 28S. Clades 1 and 2 differ
strongly in mtDNA, but not in the other genes studied.
However, clade 2 contains only (and all) the yellow wasps
sampled, while all other wasps are black and this effectively provides a nuclear marker supporting isolation of
clade 2.

Further resolution of gene flow in the "P. imperialis complex" now requires data from from substantial numbers of
wasps representing the different clades. Given the limited
variability of the nuclear sequences studied here, a population genetic approach, using microsatellites, may be
most appropriate.

Conclusion
Our study reveals deep mtDNA divergences within P.
imperialis and indicates the presence of cryptic species. The
data further suggest that these fig-pollinating wasps have
diverged without a role for host plant shifts or corresponding fig speciation. This adds to the growing body of
evidence that figs and their pollinators have not radiated
simply by strict cospeciation. Recent studies of figs in sections Americana and Pharmacosycea have revealed that
some wasp species are regularly associated with two fig
species and that host shifts may be common. There is also
support for past hybridisation of at least one pair of these
fig species linked by a common wasp species. Consequently, Machado et al. [15] suggested a revised coevolutionary model involving groups of genetically welldefined wasp species coevolving with groups of genetically less well-defined (frequently hybridizing) groups of
figs. Current data on Malvanthera figs and their Pleistodontes pollinators support the notion of genetically welldefined wasp species, but we have not found regular sharing of pollinator species between distinct fig species,
despite frequent coexistence of multiple wasps on one fig
species. In addition, the few obviously hybrid trees we
know are cultivated rather than wild. However, we now
need genetic studies of potentially hybridising fig species,
along with continuing surveys of pollinator specificity, to
assess whether this new model applies widely to figs and
fig wasps. In summary, there are at least two ways – host
shifting and independent wasp speciation – to evolve copollinators and break the 1:1 rule of host specificity.

Methods
Field sampling
Between 1998 and 2003 ripe syconia were collected from
F. rubiginosa trees growing at many disparate locations
throughout its natural range. Wasps were allowed to
emerge naturally from their syconia and were then stored
in 95% ethanol at -20C. A single collection tube comprised wasps from syconia from the same tree on the same
day. We later conducted genetic analyses on 1–5 female
wasps from each sample tube.
Molecular methods
The head from each insect was removed and retained as a
voucher specimen, and DNA was extracted from the
remaining body parts using a simple Chelex extraction
procedure [46]. We amplified a 444 bp fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) for all wasps using the
primers CB1 and CB2 [47]. For selected individuals (see
results), we also amplified a region of the nuclear 28S
rRNA gene (28S), using primers D1F and D3R [33,48,49]
as well as the wingless (wg) gene, using primers LepWG1
and LepWG2 [50]. All wasps were also screened for Wolbachia infection by PCR, employing the primers wsp81F
and wsp 691R, which amplify part of the Wolbachia surface protein gene (wsp) [51].

Amplification of cytb was performed using a GeneAmp
2400 machine (Perkin-Elmer Cetus) with 3 min at 95°C,
followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 1 min at 45°C, 1
min 30 s at 72°C, and a final elongation step of 7 min at
72°C. We increased the annealing temperature for the
other gene fragments as follows: 55°C for wsp, 50°C for
28S and 58°C for wg. The sizes of PCR products were 444
bp (cytb), 564–588 bp (wsp), ~1,060 bp (28S), and 433
bp (wg). Ten microlitres of each PCR product was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel to determine amplicon size, and the gel band was excised for purification
using a GFX DNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech Inc). We then sequenced fig wasp genes (cytb, 28S
and wg) directly using the same primers employed in PCR.
For wsp, PCR products were first sequenced directly and, if
direct sequencing failed three times (or repeatedly generated sequences with multiple peaks), the PCR product was
cloned and 6–10 different clones were sequenced to test
for the presence of multiple Wolbachia strains. We ligated
each PCR product into a T-tailed vector (pGEM-T Easy
Vector system, Promega Ltd.) and transformed into E. coli
JM109. Positive colonies were selected and plasmid DNA
was purified using a GFX Micro Plasmid Prep Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc) and the wsp inserts were
sequenced using M13 vector primers. In all cases, we
sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Perkin Elmer Inc.) and an ABI PRISM
3700 DNA Analyzer (Perkin Elmer Inc). All isolates were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/83

sequenced fully in both directions, and sequences have
been deposited in GenBank: cytb [GenBank: AY567594–
AY567638], 28S [GenBank: AY567639–AY567660] and
wg [GenBank: DQ539361–DQ539391].
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencher™
(Gene Codes Corporation), and final adjustments to 28S
and wsp alignments were made by eye, following previous
alignments (wsp: Shoemaker et al. 2002; 28S: Lopez-Vaamonde et al. 2001).

Cytb phylogenies were estimated using Maximum Parsimony (MP) in PAUP* version 4.0b10 [52], and Bayesian
methods in MRBAYES version 3.0 [53]. For MP analyses,
we conducted an initial heuristic search with 10,000 random additions and TBR branch swapping, holding one
tree per replicate. Trees generated by the initial search
were then used as starting trees for a second heuristic
search, in which multiple trees were saved. We assessed
clade support using 1000 bootstrap replicates. For Bayesian analyses, the most appropriate model of nucleotide
substitution was determined, using MrModeltest v2.2
[54], to be the general time reversible model (nst = 6). The
analyses were run for 106 generations, with one tree
retained every 100 generations. Likelihood stationarity
occurred after 2.5 × 105 generations, and this "burn-in"
period was excluded before creating a 50% majority-rule
consensus tree in PAUP*.
