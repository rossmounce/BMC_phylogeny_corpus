Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic methods which do not rely on multiple sequence alignments are
important tools in inferring trees directly from completely sequenced genomes. Here, we extend
the recently described Genome BLAST Distance Phylogeny (GBDP) strategy to compute
phylogenetic trees from all completely sequenced plastid genomes currently available and from a
selection of mitochondrial genomes representing the major eukaryotic lineages. BLASTN,
TBLASTX, or combinations of both are used to locate high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) between
two sequences from which pairwise similarities and distances are computed in different ways
resulting in a total of 96 GBDP variants. The suitability of these distance formulae for phylogeny
reconstruction is directly estimated by computing a recently described measure of "treelikeness",
the so-called δ value, from the respective distance matrices. Additionally, we compare the trees
inferred from these matrices using UPGMA, NJ, BIONJ, FastME, or STC, respectively, with the
NCBI taxonomy tree of the taxa under study.
Results: Our results indicate that, at this taxonomic level, plastid genomes are much more valuable
for inferring phylogenies than are mitochondrial genomes, and that distances based on breakpoints
are of little use. Distances based on the proportion of "matched" HSP length to average genome
length were best for tree estimation. Additionally we found that using TBLASTX instead of
BLASTN and, particularly, combining TBLASTX and BLASTN leads to a small but significant
increase in accuracy. Other factors do not significantly affect the phylogenetic outcome. The BIONJ
algorithm results in phylogenies most in accordance with the current NCBI taxonomy, with NJ and
FastME performing insignificantly worse, and STC performing as well if applied to high quality
distance matrices. δ values are found to be a reliable predictor of phylogenetic accuracy.
Conclusion: Using the most treelike distance matrices, as judged by their δ values, distance
methods are able to recover all major plant lineages, and are more in accordance with Apicomplexa
organelles being derived from "green" plastids than from plastids of the "red" type. GBDP-like
methods can be used to reliably infer phylogenies from different kinds of genomic data. A
framework is established to further develop and improve such methods. δ values are a topologyindependent tool of general use for the development and assessment of distance methods for
phylogenetic inference.

Background
Molecular phylogenies of many taxonomic groups are
based on analyses of single loci. While this approach has
led to important insights into the evolution of many
groups of interest (consider, as an extreme example,
Källersjö et al. [1]), it is also hampered by a number of
potential difficulties. For instance, due to effects such as
horizontal gene transfer, hybridisation, lineage-sorting,
paralogous genes, and pseudogenes, gene trees and species trees do not always agree [2].
Furthermore, length and, hence, information content of
individual genes is limited, sometimes causing a lack of
resolution in the inferred trees. Saturation is an important
problem, in particular if the resolution of relationships
between major groups of organisms("deep phylogeny") is
aimed at [3]. Nowadays, an increasing number of completely sequenced genomes are available and a growing
field of phylogenetic research deals with the question of
how to infer reliable phylogenies from this large amount
of data to overcome the limitations of single-gene phylogenies.
A relatively obvious approach to phylogenetic analysis of
whole genomes is to extract as many genes as possible
from the genome sequences, create a multiple sequence
alignment from each of the genes and to concatenate all
alignments. Datasets in the order of 100, 000 base pairs
have been compiled in this way (e.g., [2,4]). Such datasets
can be analysed using the same phylogenetic inference
tools as single loci datasets.
Difficulties with this approach may arise if orthologous
genes cannot be identified with certainty or if the combined sequence length is still too small to give wellresolved trees. Furthermore, the use of concatenated multiple sequence alignments discards information that can
be utilised by other methods of phylogenetic inference.
For instance, methods that infer trees based on gene content [5-7], gene order [8-10], or content of protein
orthologs and folds [11]. When applied to prokaryote
phylogeny, these different methodological approaches
lead to quite different results [12]. A further loss of information in the concatenated multiple sequence alignment
approach may be caused by regions which have to be discarded since they cannot be aligned with certainty [13].
In contrast, a third group of methods does not require to
specify genes or orthologs in advance, to create multiple
sequence alignments, and to discard unalignable regions,
but is able to generate a distance matrix directly from
complete genome sequences. Trees can then be inferred
using any of the standard distance-based phylogenetic
methods (e.g., [14,15]), even though phylogenetic networks [16,17] may be a more powerful way to explore

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/350

such distance data. Some of these approaches use differences in word-count frequencies [18], complexity-based
measures [19] or breakpoint analysis [20] to derive pairwise distance functions.
The methods of particular interest to us in this paper [2123] rely on identification of local regions of high sequence
similarity between two genomes, this is usually done with
the popular tool BLAST [24]. Henz et al. [23] recently
described the "Genome BLAST Distance Phylogeny"
(GBDP) approach and applied it to deep prokaryote phylogeny. In brief, GBDP works by finding a set of high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) between each pair of genomes,
deriving a distance function from these sets, and building
a tree or a network using algorithms like UPGMA [25], NJ
[26,27], BIONJ [28] or Neighbor-net [16].
Statistical support of individual branches within trees
inferred from multiple sequence alignments is usually
assessed by bootstrapping [29], which assumes a number
of statistically independent individual characters. Similar
to some other less commonly used but valuable (and,
hence, perhaps underused) phylogenetic methods such as
elision [13,30], direct optimisation [31], fixed-states and
search-based optimisation [32,33], or pair-wise distances
between unaligned sequences from single loci [34-36],
the above-mentioned genome distance methods cannot
readily be combined with the bootstrap since the whole
genome is treated as a single character.
In our view, this potential disadvantage is outweighed by
the fact that distance methods may be combined with
phylogenetic network techniques, which have some distinct advantages over bootstrapping (e.g., [16,17,37,38]).
For instance, bootstrapping cannot distinguish between
conflicting signal and low amount of signal, and bootstrapping cannot identify "rogue taxa" (e.g., [39,40]). Furthermore, many evolutionary processes are better
represented by networks than by trees [17,37,38,41,42].
Network techniques are better suited than bootstrapping
to detect systematic error in phylogenetic analyses, particularly in very large datasets such as genomescale data [17].
Neighbor-net is also much faster than even Neighborjoining bootstrapping [16]. Since distance methods such
as GBDP may also directly use complete genome
sequences, their combination with network techniques
may be more efficient than bootstrapping of concatenated
multiple sequence alignments.
The present article builds on the work of Henz et al. [23]
and extends it in several ways. Here, we apply GBDP to
completely sequenced plastid and mitochondrion
genomes to infer relationships of major eukaryotic
groups. Plastid and mitochondrion genomes are highly,
sometimes extremely, reduced, and are subject to evolu-

tionary conditions quite different from prokaryote
genomes. We were thus interested in whether GBDP
would perform as well as with genomes of prokaryotes
[23], and if so, under which conditions. Completely
sequenced plastid genomes have been used in a number
of articles (e.g., [43-47]) to infer phylogenetic relationships based on sequence alignments of many concatenated genes, enabling us to directly compare the GBDP
results with respect to, e.g., recovery and placement of
major eukaryotic groups and location of primary and secondary endosymbiosis events.
We also examine additional modifications of GBDP. A
new distance function based on sequence identity within
HSPs is introduced. Different formulae for creating symmetric similarity scores from the asymmetric results of
BLAST comparisons are examined, as well as two different
formulae to derive distances from similarity values. We
also investigate the use of protein-protein BLAST (WUTBLASTX [24]) instead of nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST
(NCBI-BLASTN [48]) and two ways of combining the two
methods of HSP search. Accuracy of trees inferred from
GBDP distances by three well-known (UPGMA, NJ, and
BIONJ) and two recently described reconstruction methods (STC [49] and FastME [50]) is measured by comparison with current NCBI taxonomy based on c-scores [23].
The c-score is defined as the number of non-trivial splits
in the phylogenetic tree under study which are compatible
[51] to the reference topology divided by the total number
of non-trivial splits in the test tree. These compatible splits
are either already included in the reference topology, or a
refinement of the topology, but do not conflict with it.
The c-score's denominator is useful to correct for, e.g., a
different number of taxa or a different amount of resolution in the test trees. The main factors increasing or
decreasing GBDP accuracy were determined by multiple
regression analysis with c-score as dependent variable.
Holland et al. [52] described a statistical geometry
approach to estimate the departure of a distance matrix
from the additivity condition [53], i.e., the degree to
which it is not treelike, by computing so-called δ values
for all quartets of taxa. A similar approach is the Q criterion of Guindon and Gascuel [54], which is also computed from taxon quartets and can be used to assess the
treelikeness of a distance matrix. As most distance methods are guaranteed to infer the correct tree from completely additive distances, distance matrices with the least
departure from additivity should be preferable [14,52].
An additional advantage of δ values is that they are, in
contrast to, e.g., c-scores, independent of any preconceived hypothesis on how the true phylogeny looks like.
We thus examined quality of each GBDP distance matrix
in phylogeny reconstruction directly by measuring its
mean δ value. As an empirical investigation of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/350

approach described by Holland et al. [52], suitability of δ
values in predicting phylogenetic accuracy could then be
assessed by regression analyses.

Methods
Taxon selection
Completely sequenced plastid and mitochondrial
genomes were downloaded from NCBI [55] and EMBL
[56]. If more than one plastid or mitochondrial genome
of the same species was available, we checked them for
length differences and randomly selected one sequence
representing each of the length classes found. The most
recently published completely sequenced plastid
genomes that could be considered were Acorus calamus
[46] and Pseudendoclonium akinetum [57]. We also
included two completely sequenced genomes of a special
kind of organelle found in Apicomplexa as these "Apicoplasts" have previously been shown to be most likely
derived from plastids [58]. As outgroup specimens, we
included three Cyanobacteria genomes (Synechococcus sp.,
Synechocystis sp., and Thermosynechococcus elongatus) in the
dataset, resulting in a total of 50 genomes for the plastid
analyses.

To infer the position of the root in the analyses of mitochondrial genomes, members of the α-Proteobacteria
genera Rickettsia and Wolbachia were included in the dataset. Partly due to the lack of plastids in most eukaryotes
and partly due to the importance of mitochondrial genes
in phylogeny reconstruction in Metazoa, particularly Vertebrates (e.g., [59]), many more completely sequenced
genomes are available for mitochondria than for plastids.
We thus decided to represent the main lineages within
Metazoa-Coelomata, e.g., Arthropoda and Vertebrata, by
only a single taxon, respectively, and arrived at a total of
125 mitochondrial (and outgroup) sequences, which we
believe to be representative. Including more mitochondrial genomes in the study would have made all analyses
considerably more time-consuming and would have
made the plastid and mitochondrial data less comparable
since mitochondrial genome availability is currently
severely biased towards certain Metazoan lineages. Our
taxon selection does not imply that the excluded mitochondrial sequences, or the application of the methods
described here to these sequences, are devoid of scientific
interest. Rather, the related questions are beyond the
scope of the present article.
Variants of genome BLAST distance
The first step in computing any of the GBDP methods
explored in the present paper is an all-against-all pairwise
comparison of all genomes using BLAST [24,48]. A list of
high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) is determined for each
pair of genomes X and Y including data on location,
length, and significance (indicated by an E-value and/or a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/350

score) of the individual HSPs. Henz et al. [23] observed
that thereafter it is advantageous to determine a maximum subset of HSPs which are non-overlapping in both
sequences X and Y, and that this can be accomplished
using the greedy-with-trimming approach. This approach
is described fully in [23], in brief, HSPs are selected in
decreasing order of length, all of the HSPs that have yet to
be selected are trimmed of any overlap with the currently
selected HSP and placed back into the sorted list of HSPs
still to be selected. Next genome similarity values are
inferred from the lists of non-overlapping HSPs, this can
be done in different ways.
One method relies on the concept of breakpoints [8-10].
In short, a breakpoint occurs if a third, intervening HSP is
found between two HSPs in X, but not between the two
corresponding HSPs in Y (see Figure 1 as well as [23] for
further details). Let BX and BY be the number of breakpoints in X or Y, respectively, and MX and MY denote the
number of matched intervals (i.e., pairs of adjacent HSPs)
on the X genome or the Y genome, respectively. We then
define a breakpoint similarity function between X and Y
as

sbreakpoint ( X , Y ) := 1 −

BX + BY
MX + MY

Y

x2

smcorr ( X , Y ) :=

x3

x4

x5

x6

Xmatch + Ymatch
X + Y
Xmatch + Ymatch
2 min( X , Y )

y2

y5

y6

y3

( 3)

We now introduce a fourth similarity (and, hence, distance) function based on the proportion of identical base
pairs within the set of non-overlapping HSPs to the total
length of this set. Defining I as the sum of the number of
identical base pairs over all HSPs, and H := ∑h∈HSPs
max(|Xh|, |Yh|) as the sum of the lengths of the larger
interval for each HSP, we obtain

I
H

(4)

Again, this function works equivalently with TBLASTX
instead of BLASTN, if we replace nucleotides by amino
acids.
Literature definitions of the term "similarity" usually
agree that similarity values should be constrained
between 0 (inclusively) and 1 (inclusively), a condition
which holds for the formulae listed above by definition.
There is, however, no unique way to define "distance" and
no unique formula to derive distance values from similarity values. Let d(X, Y) denote the distance between X and
Y to be computed from the similarity function. The most
important options for conversion (e.g., [60,61]) are
d(X, Y) := 1 - s (X, Y)

y1

(2)

A distance equivalent of the second formula was presented by Henz et al. (see [23], equation (3)). They
observed that it performed better than the equivalent of
the first similarity function if some genomes were essentially subsets of other genomes because their evolutionary
history included a considerable number of gene losses.

sid ( X , Y ) :=

An entirely different approach is based on the proportion
of nucleotides (or amino acids if TBLASTX is used) found
in the set of non-overlapping HSPs compared to the total
number of nucleotides, i.e., the length of the genome. Let
|Xmatch| and |Ymatch| be the number of base pairs covered by
the selected non-overlapping HSPs in X or Y, respectively,
x1

smatch ( X , Y ) :=

(1)

A distance equivalent of this formula was presented by
Henz et al. (see [23], equation (4)).

X

and |X| and |Y| be the total length of the respective
genome. Similarity formulae may then be defined as follows:

Identification of Breakpoints
Identification of Breakpoints. From a list of high-scoring
segment pairs (HSPs) obtained by use of BLASTN or
TBLASTX and reduced to a non-overlapping subset by
greedy-with-trimming [23], the number of breakpoints can
be inferred as follows. In our example, the HSP (x5, x6, y5,
y6) is located between the HSPs (x1, x2, y1, y2) and (x3, x4,
y3, y4) in genome Y but not in genome X. This will be
counted as a single breakpoint.

and
d(X, Y) := -log(s(X, Y))

(6)

Most formulae described for computing distances from
multiple DNA or protein alignments use a logarithmic
derivation to correct for saturation effects in the sequence
data (e.g., see [62]). Here we apply both formulae to all
above-mentioned similarity functions and test their relative perfomance a posteriori.

Figure 2
Comparison of reconstruction methods
Comparison of reconstruction methods. Comparison of distance functions and reconstruction methods. The graph
shows how phylogenetic accuracy (c-score) is dependent on distance quality (δ value). Each distance matrix is associated with
a certain δ value, which is lowest in case of best distance quality; each phylogenetic tree computed is associated with a certain
c-score, which is highest in case of optimal agreement between the tree and the reference topology. For each distance matrix,
trees were inferred using BIONJ (squares), FastME (circles), NJ (open inverted triangles), STC (diamonds), and UPGMA (triangles). To illustrate the behaviour of these individual methods of phylogenetic inference, cubic splines were used; the number of
15 degrees of freedom for the splines apparently optimal to summarize the shape of the data was found by careful optical comparison. For instance, the splines show that UPGMA performs relatively poorly with best distance values, whereas with high δ
values (i.e., low distance quality) STC performs worst of all tree inference methods examined. See table 1 for a more detailed
exploration of the interrelationships of topological accuracy, distance quality, and distance function parameters by multiple linear regression.

Phylogenetic methods which infer trees from pairwise distance matrices usually expect the distances to be symmetric, i.e., they require that d(X, Y) = d(Y, X) holds even if X
is not equal to Y. BLAST, however, is asymmetric by definition [24]. We therefore inferred symmetric genome
BLAST distances in three ways: as the average [23], minimum, or maximum value of d(X, Y) and d(Y, X). We
examined whether the quality of the distances and the
inferred tree is affected by the choice of approach.
Another way to modify the GBDP approach is to use
TBLASTX instead of BLASTN as already proposed by Henz
et al. [23], i.e., to search for homologies at the protein
level instead of at the nucleotide level. Both BLAST methods could also be combined. As the greedy-with-trimming

approach already sorts HSPs by decreasing length, one
way of combining BLASTN and TBLASTX HSPs is to sort
them together, so that the usually longer HSPs derived
from TBLASTX suppress shorter overlapping BLASTN
HSPs. A more equally-weighted method of combination
is to compute BLASTN and TBLASTX genome distance
matrices separately and to determine the average of both
matrices afterwards (see [63,64] for other examples of distance matrix averaging). Before inferring the mean matrix,
distance matrices usually need to be brought to the same
scale. A reliable and generally applicable method of rescaling is the so-called ranging procedure which consists of
dividing all values in one matrix by the maximum value
observed in that matrix [61,65]. We examined four possibilities for performing HSP search: use of either BLASTN

Neighbor-net reconstruction based on GBDP distances between whole mitochondrion genomes
Neighbor-net reconstruction based on GBDP distances between whole mitochondrion genomes. The GBDP variant used was derived by scaling and averaging distance matrices based on HSP search with BLASTN and TBLASTX, respectively. Further settings were use of equations (2) and (6) and averaging of asymmetric distance values. With BIONJ as tree
reconstruction method, this distance matrix achieved the highest c-score (0.5574), i.e., highest topological accuracy according
to the current NCBI taxonomy, of all GBDP trees inferred from mitochondrial genomes. The matrix' δ value was 0.2946, indicative of a relatively high distance quality compared to the other results obtained with mitochondrial genomes. Bacterial outgroup taxa and major eukaryotic groups are indicated. Note the apparently low resolution of the network as compared to the
best results obtained with plastid genomes (Figs. 4 and 5). Nevertheless, quite a few subgroups of the major eukaryotic groups
are well recovered.
or TBLASTX alone, or a combination of BLASTN and
TBLASTX either before or after distance matrix computation.
Note that it has not been established for any of the abovementioned GBDP methods that they will necessarily
result in a distance matrix which is metric, i.e., obeys to

the triangle inequality (e.g., [66]). Hence, they cannot be
called "distances" in a strictly mathematical sense. Nevertheless, as pointed out by Felsenstein [62], this is also true
for phylogenetic distance formulae based on multiple
sequence alignments such as the Jukes-Cantor equation,
and, more importantly, "most distance methods do not
absolutely require the Triangle inequality to hold".

Quality assessment of distances and phylogenies
The quality of the distance formulae described above for
phylogeny reconstruction was assessed in two ways. First,
we compared the topology of phylogenetic trees inferred
from the respective distance matrix with the topology of
the NCBI taxonomy of the taxa involved (NCBI [67]) by
computing the c-score. The NCBI taxonomy tree can be
regarded as an estimate of the "true" phylogeny, although
it is not fully resolved.

Three standard distance-based phylogeny reconstruction
methods were applied to the distance matrices, i.e.,
UPGMA [25] and NJ [26,27] as implemented in the
Phylip package version 3.63 [68] as well as BIONJ, a modification of the NJ algorithm described and implemented
by Gascuel [28]. Additionally, two more recently
described distance methods were considered, FastME [49]
and shortest triplet clustering (STC, [50]). Both are said to
be faster than any known NJ variant and more accurate,
particularly if large numbers of taxa are involved. FastME
was run under the balanced minimum evolution criterion
[69] including balanced NNI branch swapping.
Compared to trees, phylogenetic networks are more general graphs and may contain conflicting branching patterns. Such networks can be used to visualize
hybridisation, horizontal gene transfer, recombination
events or noise in the data due to finite length of
sequences or inadequacy of the statistical model used to
infer pairwise distances [37]. Several methods are available to infer networks from distance data (e.g., [38]). Here,
the recently described agglomerative Neighbour-net algorithm [16] as implemented in SplitsTree4 [17] was used to
visualize treelikeness of and phylogenetic information
contained in selected distance matrices. Treelikeness cannot appropriately be visualised by means of tree reconstruction methods such as Neighbor-joining since these
will force every distance matrix into a tree irrespective of
how treelike it actually is. Neighbor-net is fast and frequently leads to greater resolution than older methods
like split decomposition [16]. On the other hand, it
would not make much sense to compute c-scores from
phylogenetic networks to assess topological accuracy.
Since methods such as Neighbor-net are designed to allow
the simultaneous representation of multiple trees, or at
least to display conflicting signal as well as other non-treelike aspects of the data, the c-score would clearly underestimate topological accuracy [23]. The latter is much better
represented by the c-score of a phylogenetic tree, which
most likely consists of a subset of the splits represented in
a network if inferred from the same distance matrix.
Holland et al. [52] introduced the computation of socalled δ values for each quartet of taxa present in the
whole dataset (see also [54]). A lower δ value indicates

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/350

greater correspondence to Buneman's condition of tree
additivity [53] which is fully satisfied, if δ approaches
zero. δ values can be averaged over individual taxa; in that
case, large values of δ may, e.g., indicate hybrids [52] or
taxa whose evolutionary history, as far as represented by
its sequence data at hand, has a particularly low fit to the
distance method in use. One can also compute the mean
δ value of complete distance matrices which indicates
suitability of the respective data or the distance function
applied to these data for phylogeny reconstruction in general. A script written in the python language was used to
compute δ values of the individual genomes as well as
average δ values under all distance approaches considered
here. (The script is available on request by emailing
b.r.holland@massey.ac.nz)
A complete data set is available for download (in CSV format), containing all reconstructed phylogenetic trees and
their corresponding c-scores and δ values [see Additional
file 1].
Regression analysis
The individual distance functions described above were
recoded into their four independent components (equation (1), (2), (3), or (4); equation (5) or (6); average, minimum, or maximum of asymmetric distance values;
BLASTN, TBLASTX, BLASTN after TBLASTX, or matrix
combination) each of which was treated as a single qualitative variable with four, two, three, or four possible
states, respectively [70]. The phylogenetic reconstruction
methods are also easily coded as a single quantitative variable with five states (UPGMA, NJ, BIONJ, FastME, or
STC). Two multiple linear regression approaches were
used:

1. δ value as dependent on the distance components.
2. c-score as dependent on distance components and tree
reconstruction methods.
All statistical analyses were carried through using the R
package (version 2.1.1, [71]). R automatically recodes
qualitative variables into a set of binary variables (e.g.,
[70]) carrying the same information and suitable for linear regression. R also provides a step-wise regression procedure to eliminate insignificant variables based on the
Akaike information criterion (AIC; e.g., [72]). The AIC
tries to achieve a balance between model simplicity (the
number of parameters used to explain the data) and
model likelihood, in accordance with the well-known
principle called Ockham's razor (e.g., [73,74]). In each
step of the procedure, a variable which, according to the
AIC, does not significantly improve the fit of the regression model to the data is removed and all regression
parameters such as regression coefficients and t values

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/350

[75] are recomputed. The step-wise elimination stops
when all explanatory variables left make a significant contribution.

Results and discussion
Which distance function is optimal?
Table 1 depicts the results of an AIC-based step-wise elimination approach to multiple linear regression performed
with R [71]. Besides revealing which distance formulae are
most reliable (as discussed in the following paragraphs),
regression analysis also indicates that δ values work well
in predicting phylogenetic accuracy. The δ variable is able
to represent most of the differences between the distance
functions. With data transformed to z-scores, 61.7% of
the variance in c-score is explained, if δ value alone is used
as independent variable. Together with reconstruction
methods, δ explains 62.1%; δ, significant distance parameters (Table 1), and reconstruction methods together
explain 87.0% of the variance in c-score.

Henz et al. [23] observed that breakpoint distances performed very poorly in comparing prokaryote genomes
which is in accordance with the commonly held view that
breakpoint methods lead to reliable results only if the
genomes are sufficiently co-linear. Regression analyses
indicate that, if applied to plastid and mitochondrion
data, breakpoint distances as based on equation (1) had
by far the worst performance of all distance formulae with
respect to δ values and c-scores. We conclude that on the
taxonomic level examined here neither mitochondrion
nor plastid genomes have a sufficient amount of co-linearity for the breakpoint method to be successful.

It also follows from the regression analysis that results
obtained with distances based on nucleotide (or amino
acid) identity within HSPs relative to the total length of
HSPs (equation (4)) are inferior to those obtained with
the matched distance variants (equations (2) and (3)), an
observation which could be explained as follows. If two
taxa are only distantly related, HSPs will only be found in
the most conservative parts of their genomes. It may well
be that these loci are so conserved that nucleotides are
mostly identical within these HSPs. More closely related
taxa, on the other hand, will share more HSPs some of
which will correspond to less conserved loci displaying
more disagreement between the two sequences. If plotted
against corresponding matched distance values (not
shown), HSP identity distances at first appear linearly
related, but decrease again for largest values of matched
distance, supporting our interpretation. It could be argued
that the HSP identity distance approach should be used
only if genomes are not too distantly related, although in
most cases it would still perform much better than breakpoint distances. With mitochondrial genomes, the tied
highest c-score was achieved by one of the matched distances and one of the HSP identity distance variants.
Large differences in genome length are often due to a considerable loss of genes related to particular ecological
adaptations such as parasitism or mutualism [76]. The
main difference between the two matched similarity formulae examined here is that equation (3) attempts to correct for presence of such genomes heavily reduced in size.
Interestingly, equation (2) performed better than the corrected one with respect to both δ value and c-score (Table

STC. Right side: δ value in dependence on all variables. Only those explanatory variables judged as significant in at least one of the two
approaches are included; those not shown were removed in the course of the step-wise procedures and did not contribute to the final
regression model.

1). On the other hand, formula (3) always led to a correct
placement of the reduced genome of Epifagus virginiana
(not shown; placement similar to Figure 4), whereas Epifagus was wrongly located at the base of Angiosperms, if
equations (3) and (5) were combined (Figure 5). However, if formula (2) was used in conjunction with (6), the
position of Epifagus was correctly revealed (Figure 4). We
suggest that formulae not corrected for genome size may
usually be superior, but that the size-corrected one should
be preferred in case of evidence for extreme gene loss in
one or more of the genomes investigated [23]. It seems
worth noting that use of HSP identity distances also led to
Epifagus misplacement at the root of Angiosperms (not

shown) similar to Figure 5, even though equation (4)
does not refer to total genome lengths.
Deriving distances from pairwise similarities as their negative logarithm (equation (6)) performs worse than subtraction from 1 (equation (5)) with respect to δ value, but
has no significant effect on c-score (Table 1). On the contrary, using the logarithm may improve topological accuracy with respect to taxa with extreme genome
modifications like Epifagus (compare Figures 4, 5). However, the suggestion of Holland et al. [52] to remove those
taxa with largest individual δ values would also have been
of use with size-uncorrected distances derived by subtrac-

Neighbor-net reconstruction based on GBDP distances between whole plastid genomes. Here, the GBDP variant
was derived by scaling and averaging distances based on HSP search with BLASTN and TBLASTX, respectively. Further settings
were use of equations (2) and (5) and averaging of asymmetric distance values. The resulting distance matrix achieved the globally lowest δ value (0.1629) and, hence, globally highest distance quality. The highest c-score (topological accuracy) obtained
with this matrix was 0.6596 (using BIONJ or STC as phylogenetic reconstruction method). Bacterial outgroup taxa and major
eukaryotic groups are indicated. Note the apparently incorrect placement of the highly reduced genome of Epifagus virginiana.
Other results are similar to Fig. 4; e.g., most major eukaryotic groups are well recovered.

tion, as Epifagus had a δ value of 0.3681 compared to the
average δ of 0.1629 obtained with the distance matrix
underlying Figure 5. We hypothesise that in most cases
choosing either subtraction or negative logarithm only
has an effect on scaling.

alignments under different types of correction. Possibly,
p-distances sometimes result in better δ values. It may well
be that the most complex model or the best model according to the maximum likelihood criterion does not result
in the lowest δ values [52].

In the multiple sequence alignment setting distances are
typically corrected for multiple changes, such corrections
require an explicit model of nucleotide substitution [62].
A challenge for future research could be to relate GBDP
distance functions to models of genome evolution, so that
similar types of correction could be applied. However, it
would also be interesting to gather more data on the
behaviour of δ values when applied to multiple sequence

We did not observe significant differences in performance
between the average, maximum, or minimum value
approach to conversion of asymmetric into symmetric
distance values. Asymmetric GBDP distance values are
due to an artefact of using BLAST [24] and have no obvious biological meaning. Furthermore, numeric differences between corresponding asymmetric values were in
general quite low, although they increased with increasing

absolute value of their average (not shown) and thus
could to some degree correspond to the variance of these
distances.
Which HSP search and which reconstruction method is
optimal?
Regression analysis (Table 1) indicates that replacing
BLASTN by TBLASTX leads to a small improvement in the
results and that a combination of TBLASTX and BLASTN
at the HSP level (weighting TBLASTX HSPs more heavily
than BLASTN HSPs) works even better. Combination at
the distance matrix level still performs better than using
BLASTN alone, although less significantly so than do
TBLASTX and combination at the HSP level. We conclude
that this difference is due to greater sequence conservation
at the protein level, hence, TBLASTX gives better resolution, especially at the backbone of the phylogenetic trees.
It also seems plausible that nucleotide and protein
sequences, respectively, may contain different information and that combining both levels in some way is useful
in extracting phylogenetic signal from the data.

On the other hand, the effect of the different methods of
HSP determination and combination is much less than
the effects of either choice of data type (mitochondria vs.
plastids), or choice of distance function (breakpoint,
matched, or HSP distance). Whereas TBLASTX HSP search
takes much longer than BLASTN search, trees inferred
from distances based on TBLASTX are not considerably
more accurate. Computation time is no severe problem
with the mitochondrial and plastid data examined here,
but may be limiting if longer sequences like prokaryotic
genomes [23] and/or many more taxa (e.g., all mitochondrion genomes currently accessible) are examined. Therefore, the use of BLASTN may be the more efficient method
under most conditions.
With respect to tree reconstruction methods, regression
results indicate that BIONJ [28] works best overall, but
that the original NJ algorithm [26,27] and the more
recently described FastME method [49] do not perform
significantly worse. Mean c-score values were 0.3899,
0.3888, 0.3790, 0.3601, and 0.3493 for BIONJ, FastME,
NJ, UPGMA, and STC; more importantly, the best values
for each reconstruction method were 0.8298, 0.7660,
0.7660, 0.6170, and 0.8085 respectively. Given that
FastME has a lower time complexity than BIONJ and NJ
[49], we conclude that the former method is preferable
with this kind of distances, especially if large numbers of
taxa are involved. The low c-scores of the UPGMA trees are
as expected, like other clustering methods, UPGMA [25] is
known to work well only if the distances at least approximately satisfy the ultrametric condition. This condition
usually only holds, if rates of evolutionary change do not
vary very much between lineages (e.g., [77]). However,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/350

UPGMA performed surprisingly well with low-quality distances (Figure 2).
Considering the results of Vinh and Von Haeseler [50],
the relatively poor performance of Shortest Triplet Clustering (STC) is surprising. These authors demonstrated
that with large numbers of taxa STC performs better than
NJ, BIONJ, and GME or BME (the latter two methods can
be used to produce a starting tree in FastME). Vinh and
Von Haeseler [50] also showed that these five algorithms
work equally well if they are used to initially build a tree
which is then improved by NNI branch swapping under
the balanced minimum evolution criterion (BNNI
[49,69]). Here we only used BNNI in conjunction with
FastME, so the performance of STC should have been
worse than that of FastME, but better than that of either
NJ, BIONJ, and UPGMA. However, an important difference between Vinh and Von Haeseler [50] and the present
study is that we included some distance data of apparently
very low quality. Figure 2 indeed shows that STC performs
particularly poorly for distances with a high δ value, but
that it works well on high quality distance matrices, in
accordance with Vinh and Von Haeseler [50]. Furthermore, these authors focussed on the performance of
reconstruction methods with very large (> 1000) numbers
of taxa. It must also be emphasised that distance quality,
as measured by δ values, explains a much larger part of the
variance in c-score than does the reconstruction method
factor (see above).
Phylogenetic aspects
Regression results indicate that plastid genomes generally
performed significantly better than complete mitochondrial sequences with respect to both δ values and c-scores,
i.e., correspondence of the resulting trees to current NCBI
taxonomy. Indeed, δ values of distance matrices ranged
from 0.5767 to 0.2882, if inferred from mitochondrial
genomes, but from 0.4564 to 0.1629, if inferred from
plastid genomes. c-scores ranged from 0.0082 to 0.5574
for mitochondrial data, but from 0.0638 to 0.8298 for
plastid data compared to a maximum of 0.727 found by
Henz et al. [23] when applying GBDP to 91 prokaryotic
genomes. Underlying genome data was one of the most
important factors in explaining distance quality (Table 1).

We conclude that mitochondrial genomes are saturated
for comparisons of the members of the main eukaryotic
groups. Maximum values in distance matrices derived
from mitochondria were generally larger than those found
in corresponding distances derived from plastid genomes
(not shown). Consequently, the best mitochondrial phylogenies look rather unresolved (Fig. 3).
Furthermore, some major eukaryotic groups don't appear
as monophyletic in the network, although they are fre-

quently split into only a few different clusters. For
instance, Metazoa are divided into Porifera (Axinella) and
Zoantharia (Acropora to Metridium) on the one hand and
Bilateria (Asterias to Trichinella), i.e., all remaining
included Metazoan taxa on the other hand. Fungi are
almost completely recovered, except Cryptococcus, four
Chytridomycete taxa (Monoblepharella to Hyaloraphidium),
and the highly derived Allomyces, which are misplaced.
Some smaller taxonomic groups of similar rank are completely recovered like α-Proteobacteria (outgroup), Rhodophyta and, although less clearly so, stramenopiles. In
contrast, Viridiplantae (green algae and land plants;
"Chloroplastida" according to [78]) are split into a considerable number of clusters.
However, several subclades of main eukaryotic groups are
recovered. For instance, Platyhelminthes (Schistosoma to
Paragonimus) and Coelomata (Asterias to Apis) within
Metazoa as well as Embryophyta (Arabidopsis to Zea)
within Viridiplantae appear as clusters in the phylogenetic
network. We suggest that mitochondrial data are of
greater use when applied within the major groups of
eukaryotes, e.g., within Deuterostomia, and that it would
be interesting to apply GBDP to such taxon sets. Other
authors were indeed able to construct robust phylogenies
from unaligned mitochondrial genomes within, e.g., Vertebrates [19].
On the other hand, we see no evidence that the low backbone resolution of our mitochondrial network is due to
shortcomings of the GBDP methodology. To our knowledge, mitochondrial genome-scale analyses through concatenation of single loci and inference of trees using
standard methods have not been conducted so far with a
taxon sampling as comprehensive as ours. This may even
be impossible, since mitochondrial genomes of diverse
eukaryotic groups may not share a sufficient number of
loci. An advantage of GBDP-like methods (if combined
with phylogenetic network techniques) over standard
methods based on multiple sequence alignment is that
the former do not assume that homology of single nucleotides or amino acids can be established throughout the
loci. Here, we were able to compute distance matrices and
to assess resolution from the phylogenetic networks without any necessity to preprocess the genomic data.
In contrast to mitochondrial genomes, best plastid-based
GBDP distances and trees were of high quality as measured by δ value as well as c-score, and are worth discussing
in greater detail. A possible limitation of the c-score in
assessing quality of phylogenetic trees derived from plastid genes or genomes is that the reference taxonomy, as far
as it relies on molecular data, is usually based on nuclear
genes. Whereas it is now generally assumed that primary
endosymbiosis giving rise to plant-like eukaryotes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/350

occurred only once [43-45,78], events like secondary or
even tertiary endosymbiosis should lead to incongruence
between plastid-derived and nucleus-derived molecular
phylogenies. However, we observed that splits potentially
causing such conflict (e.g., a group comprised of all plantlike eukaryotes possessing primary plastids surrounded by
two membranes) are not included in current NCBI taxonomy, which is far from being completely resolved.
Thus, our c-score implementation should not be affected
by this potential bias, although secondary endosymbiosis
events are well recovered by best GBDP trees (Figures 4,
5). For instance, both Odontella sinensis (stramenopiles,
Bacillariophyta) and Guillardia theta (Cryptophyta) cluster together with red algae (Rhodophyta). The plastids of
plant-like organisms within stramenopiles as well as
Cryptophyta are currently assumed to be derived from red
algae [43,44]. Plastids of Euglenozoa are also thought to
have originated by secondary endosymbiosis, but by
incorporation of algae of basal position within the
"green" lineage, although exact placement of Euglenozoa
plastids within that lineage is uncertain [43]. In accordance with that view, the Euglena genomes included in our
sample show affinities to basal Streptophyta.
Interestingly, organelle ("apicoplast") genomes of Alveolata are placed by GBDP as sister taxon of Euglenozoa.
These apicoplasts have only relatively recently been demonstrated to be most probably identical to plastids [58].
The "Chromalveolata hypothesis" states that Alveolata
(Apicomplexa, Ciliata, and Dinoflagellates) are closely
related to stramenopiles as well as to a couple of smaller
groups like Cryptophyta, and that plastids found in these
clades originated by a single secondary endosymbiosis
event (e.g., [44]). Two recent studies [79,80] revealed that
plastid-targeted GAPDH enzymes of Chromalveolata
including Toxoplasma and Plasmodium (Apicomplexa)
formed a distinct class unrelated to paralogous genes
found in land plants, green algae, and red algae, a result
which was interpreted as indicative of a single origin of
plastids in Chromalveolata including Apicomplexa. On
the other hand, one could ask whether genes belonging to
the same family of plastid-targeted genes need to be targeted to the same kind of plastids. So far, studies based on
plastid data themselves [58] indicate a sister-group relationship of Euglenozoa and Apicomplexa organelles and,
hence, multiple origins of plastids in Chromalveolata, a
hypothesis which is supported by GBDP applied to complete plastid genome sequences.
The position of the outgroup species is not in agreement
with NCBI taxonomy, as Cyanobacteria appear as nested
within Viridiplantae, the "green" plant lineage comprised
of Chlorophyta (green algae) and Streptophyta (derived
green algae and land plants). Within green plants, Strep-

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:350

tophyta and Streptophytina (Chaetosphaeridium and land
plants, i.e., Marchantia to Adiantum) are recovered. Chlorophyta is also revealed as monophyletic except for Nephroselmis (Chlorophyta, Prasinophyceae) which shows
affinities to Streptophyta. On the other hand, Neighbornet reveals conflicting signal located near what is expected
to be the basal node of the network indicating that GBDP
does not resolve the most basal branchings of plastid evolution including the origin of the green lineage. The long
branch separating Cyanobacteria and plastids may be
indicative of the large amount of gene loss and/or gene
transfer to the nucleus which accompanied plastid creation via endosymbiosis [43].
Within land plants, positions of ferns (Adiantum, Huperzia, and Psilotum), mosses (Physcomitrella), hornworts
(Anthoceros), and liverworts (Marchantia), are not
resolved. Considering the problems more traditional
methods of phylogenetic inference have had in resolving
basal land plant relationships, this outcome should not
be regarded as due to some deficiency in GBDP. The position of mosses, hornworts, and liverworts remains controversial in the literature. The most recent studies based on
plastid multi-gene multiple sequence alignment indicate
that these clades form a monophyletic group, but corrections for amino acid composition bias are required to
achieve that result [46,81] (compare with the phylogenetic trees in, e.g. [44]).
Relationships between seed plants (Pinus to Oryza)are
well recovered except for placement of Epifagus. Epifagus
virginiana (Orobanchaceae) is a reduced, achlorophyllous
land plant which in the course of its adaptation to parasitism on other land plants completely lost its photosynthetic ability [82]. As a consequence, Epifagus apparently
also lost related metabolic genes, many of which would
have been located within the plastid genome. Total length
of its plastid genome is 70 kb, which is 44.7% and 44.9%
of the plastid genome length found in Atropa and Nicotiana, respectively. As already mentioned, Epifagus gets
misplaced at the base of Angiosperms, if GBDP is derived
according to equation (2) in combination with equation
(5) (Figure 5). Corrected distances (equation (3); not
shown) as well as formula (2) in conjunction with formula (6) recover Epifagus's sister-group relationship to
Atropa and Nicotiana (all in lamiids; Figure 4).
Members of the grass family (Triticum to Zea, Poaceae,
monocots) seem to be misplaced near the root of the
Angiosperms in both plastid/Neighbor-net reconstructions depicted. However, Figure 4 also shows alternative
splits indicating a sister-group relationship between
Acorus calamus and Poaceae in accordance with monocot
monophyly. The position of the monocot taxa remained
controversial in analyses of multiple plastid gene align-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/350

ments from a small number of selected flowering plant
taxa [46]. Agreement with studies including several hundreds of species and few genes (e.g., Savolainen et al. [83])
was only recently achieved by including a more representative set of taxa from incompletely sequence plastid
genomes [47]. As with respect to basal land plant resolution, we conclude that these results point to problems
inherent to plastid data (or due to insufficient taxon sampling). We see no evidence that GBDP performs less well
than do more commonly used approaches based on multiple sequence alignment.

Conclusion
As a contribution to the growing field of phylogenomics,
we here inferred GBDP phylogenies from completely
sequenced plastid and mitochondrial genomes. In search
for an optimal approach, a number of modifications of
GBDP were examined. The effects of the individual distance function parameters on distance matrix quality and
on the accuracy of the resulting trees were examined by
multiple linear regression. Such a framework can also be
used in future studies to assess other phylogenetic distance methods.
It turned out that accuracy of the resulting trees is in good
accordance with the treelikeness of the underlying distance matrices as measured by their δ value. As a valuable
approach in general, δ values should be particularly useful
in future research if a choice has to be made between different distance methods but a reference tree is unavailable
or cannot be used because additional independent phylogenetic evidence is aimed at. For instance, it would be
interesting to compare δ values obtained with GBDP with
those obtained with other methods which infer distances
directly from whole genomes (e.g., [5-12,19,20]). However, δ values may also be used to find the optimal substitution model for aligned nucleotide or amino acid
sequences [14,52]. If trees are to be inferred using distance
methods anyway, this approach may be more consistent
than the more commonly used likelihood-based criteria
[74,84,85]. If unambiguous multiple sequence alignment
is difficult, it may also be useful to infer distances matrices
directly from single loci (e.g., [34-36]). δ values could be
used to compare these distance methods with each other
and with distance derived from different alignments of
the same sequence data. The δ approach is not restricted
to sequence data but could also be used to assess other
kinds of phylogenetic distance functions such as those for
restriction endonuclease or immunological data [14] or
even distance formulae based on the distribution of parasite species on their hosts (e.g., [86]). Note that the Q criterion as formulated by Guindon and Gascuel [54] is
computed in almost the same way as δ; it would be interesting to compare these two quartet-based measures of
treelikeness in future studies.

Regarding the GBDP variants, it became obvious that distances based on breakpoints are of little use. On the other
hand, distances based on the proportion of "matched"
HSP length to average genome length performed best in
tree estimation. Furthermore, replacing BLASTN by
TBLASTX in the GBDP approach led to a small increase in
accuracy. Combining TBLASTX and BLASTN HSP search
may also be beneficial. Interestingly, combination works
almost equally well before and after distance computation. We showed that other factors do not have much
effect on the resulting phylogenies. Distance quality also
had a much larger effect than reconstruction methods. If
applied to high quality distance matrices, all agglomerative methods we examined performed well except for
UPGMA. In accordance with earlier studies, Neighbor-net
was found to be particularly useful to visualize the results.
It provides an efficient way to demonstrate the tree-likeness of the distance matrices and the amount of conflicting signal or unambiguous support for certain
phylogenetic relationships in the data.
With respect to the phylogenetic outcome, we conclude
that completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes suffer
from saturation. Application of GBDP to mitochondrial
genomes may be more valuable within major eukaryotic
lineages such as Metazoa. In contrast, plastid GBDP led to
much more accurate phylogenies if based on the most
treelike distance matrices. Besides recovering major plant
lineages as recognised in current NCBI taxonomy, best
plastid GBDP distances reveal a sister-group relationship
between Apicomplexa and Euglenozoa plastids, indicating the plastid evolution in Chromalveolata may have
been more complicated than currently recognised.
