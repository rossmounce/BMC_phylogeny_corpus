Abstract
Background: Recent phylogenetic analyses have identified Amborella trichopoda, an understory tree species
endemic to the forests of New Caledonia, as sister to a clade including all other known flowering plant species.
The Amborella genome is a unique reference for understanding the evolution of angiosperm genomes because it
can serve as an outgroup to root comparative analyses. A physical map, BAC end sequences and sample shotgun
sequences provide a first view of the 870 Mbp Amborella genome.
Results: Analysis of Amborella BAC ends sequenced from each contig suggests that the density of long terminal
repeat retrotransposons is negatively correlated with that of protein coding genes. Syntenic, presumably ancestral,
gene blocks were identified in comparisons of the Amborella BAC contigs and the sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana,
Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera and Oryza sativa genomes. Parsimony mapping of the loss of synteny corroborates
previous analyses suggesting that the rate of structural change has been more rapid on lineages leading to
Arabidopsis and Oryza compared with lineages leading to Populus and Vitis. The gamma paleohexiploidy event
identified in the Arabidopsis, Populus and Vitis genomes is shown to have occurred after the divergence of all other
known angiosperms from the lineage leading to Amborella.
Conclusions: When placed in the context of a physical map, BAC end sequences representing just 5.4% of the
Amborella genome have facilitated reconstruction of gene blocks that existed in the last common ancestor of all
flowering plants. The Amborella genome is an invaluable reference for inferences concerning the ancestral
angiosperm and subsequent genome evolution.

Background
The origin and rapid diversification of the angiosperms
(flowering plants) were pivotal events in the evolutionary
history of Earth’s biota. Over the past 130 to 150 million
years angiosperms have diversified to include approximately 350,000 species occupying nearly all habitable terrestrial and many aquatic environments. Angiosperms

generate the vast majority of human food either directly or
indirectly as animal feed, and they account for a huge proportion of land-based photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. Comparative analyses of genome sequences and
gene function for a growing number of species are shedding light on how gene and genome duplications have
contributed to the diversification within major flowering
plant lineages (for example, Rosidae, Asteridae, Monocotyledoneae [1]), but elucidation of the genetic and genomic
processes underlying the key innovations associated with
the origin of flowering plants (for example, typically

bisexual flowers, endosperm formation, double fertilization, ovules with two integuments, seed development
within the carpel) requires comparisons between lineages
that diverged from the last common ancestor of all extant
angiosperms [2,3].
Recent phylogenetic analyses have identified Amborella trichopoda, an understory tree or shrub species
endemic to the forests of New Caledonia, as the sister
species to all other extant angiosperms [4-8]. Amborella
is no more ‘ancient’ or ‘primitive’ than any other extant
flowering plant species, but comparisons between
Amborella and other angiosperms are allowing researchers to triangulate on characteristics of their last common ancestor. Using a similar approach, researchers
have used the complete genome sequence of platypus,
Ornithorhynchus anatinus, representing the sister group
of all other extant mammals, to elucidate mammalian
genome evolution [9].
Previous comparisons of transcriptome content [10],
gene expression patterns [11-13], and gene function
[14,15] between Amborella and other flowering plant species have suggested that much of the floral development
program that has been characterized in Arabidopsis, snapdragon and maize existed in the last common ancestor of
extant angiosperms. While gene duplications in the
MADS-box transcription factor family likely contributed
to the earliest floral development regulatory networks
[11,12,16-19], it is not clear whether these were single
gene duplications or the product of polyploidization. Genome duplications have occurred repeatedly throughout
angiosperm history [20-23] but there is uncertainty in the
timing of polyploidy events relative to the origin of the
angiosperms and important innovations in flowering plant
history [24].
Here we describe a BAC-based draft physical map
for A. trichopoda and use BAC end sequences (BESs)
to compare the structure of the Amborella genome to
representative eudicot (Vitis, Populus and Arabidopsis)
and grass (Oryza) genomes. Comparative analyses of
sequences for two large contiguous regions (487.3 and
629.7 kb in the Amborella genome) were also performed. In addition we use a large transcriptome
assembly to identify BAC ends matching protein-coding sequences [25]. Our aim here is to begin to investigate whether regions of these genomes have remained
syntenic throughout angiosperm history, and determine whether ancient genome duplications discovered
in eudicot and grass genomes [26-29] occurred before
or after the divergence of these lineages from the
Amborella lineage. In addition, the physical map and
sequence analyses establish a framework for future studies of all flowering plant genomes, including the
Amborella genome itself.

Results and discussion
BAC library and physical map

The structure and composition of the 870 Mbp/C [30]A.
trichopoda genome was investigated through physical
mapping of clones from a 5.2 × coverage BAC library.
The library was constructed after partial digest of highmolecular-weight DNA with HindIII. The library, which
comprises 36,684 BAC clones with an estimated average
insert size of 123 kb, is available through the Arizona
Genomics Institute [31]. The BAC library was double
spotted in high density onto Hybond N+ filters. All
36,684 clones were end-sequenced, and a physical map
was constructed after high information content fingerprinting (HICF) [32,33]. A total of 32,719 fingerprinted
BACs was assembled into 3,106 contigs and 1,356 singletons using the program FPC version 7.2 [34].
The quality of the physical map was assessed by screening the arrayed library with probes developed for Amborella homologs for eight genes that have been found to be
single-copy in sequenced plant genomes [35,36]. Probes
derived from Amborella cDNA clones or PCR amplicons
were putative homologs of following single-copy Arabidopsis genes: ASD (At1g14810), DWARF1 (At3g19820),
GIGANTEA (At1g22770), LEAFY (At5g61850), a dienelactone hydrolase gene (At2g32520), a cytochrome-Coxidase-related gene (At4g37830), EIF3K (At4g33250)
and a hypothetical protein-coding gene with strong similarity to rice gene Os02g0593400 (At5g63135). All verified positive clones mapped to the same FPC contig for
six of the eight probes (Figure S1 in Additional file 1).
Positive clones for the EIF3K and the hypothetical protein-coding gene probes were each distributed between
two FPC contigs and inspection of the HICF bands for
these contigs suggests that the genes have been duplicated in the Amborella lineage. In accordance with the
expected library coverage, the single copy nuclear gene
probes hybridized to 3 to 13 clones (mean 6.9).
The correlation between HICF bands and the number of
BACs included in each FPC contig was 0.655 for all contigs and 0.917 after removing two contigs derived from the
chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes and one contig
composed largely of repetitive elements (Figure S2 in
Additional file 1). We used a calibration of average insert
size (123 kb) over the average number of HICF bands per
BAC clone (128) to obtain a rough estimate of FPC contig
lengths. Of 77 FPC contigs with 39 or more BACs (not
including the contigs with the plastome and repetitive elements), estimated lengths ranged from 308 to 1,429 kb.
BAC end sequencing was performed on all fingerprinted BACs producing 69,466 Sanger reads with an
average length of 695 bp after quality and vector trimming. This corresponds to 48.25 Mbp, or roughly 5.4%
of the Amborella genome. BESs were related to the

Zuccolo et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R48

physical map and used to identify regions of synteny
between regions of the Amborella genome and the
sequenced Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis (grape), and
Oryza (rice) genomes (see below). In addition, end
sequences were used to verify the identity of the three
excluded FPC contigs described above. All BESs mapping at least 100 bp apart on the plastid genome [37]
were found in the same FPC contig. This contig
included just 532 BACs, indicating very low (1.6%) plastid DNA contamination.
Characterization of repeats in BAC end and shotgun
sequences

Repeat composition and frequency in the Amborella genome were characterized through analysis of the BAC end
and whole genome survey sequences. Reads were first
compared with sequences in Repbase (v.15.08) [38] using
BLASTN [39]. In order to minimize the effect of divergence between Amborella genes and homologous repeats
from other species, we used relaxed BLASTN settings (-q
-4 -r 5) to accommodate an estimated 160 million years of
sequence divergence since the last common ancestor of
extant flowering plants [8,40-42] while maintaining rigorous support for significant hits (E-value threshold was set
at 1e-10). All BAC end sequences without significant hits
were then compared with the non-redundant protein database in GenBank using BLASTX and an E-value threshold
of e-5. Finally, the remaining sequences without matches
in Repbase or the GenBank nr database were compared
with sequences that did have matches in either database
using BLASTN with an E-value threshold of 1.0e-10. We
report results both excluding these ‘internal’ BLAST
searches and including them (I). Together these results
provide estimates of transposable element (TE) content
based on conservative and more comprehensive (and possibly more permissive; I) search strategies.
With the more comprehensive strategy (I), slightly more
than half of all the Amborella BESs matched known TE
sequences. Not surprisingly, the most highly represented
TE class was long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons,
accounting for 7.65% (I: 30.01%) of all BESs and 57.5%
(I: 56.58%) of all those with hits to Repbase. Hits to Ty1copia type sequences were slightly more common (3.11%;
I: 13.79%) than matches to Ty3-gypsy-like LTRs (3.50%;
I: 12.09%); the remaining LTR retrotransposon matches
(1.04%; I: 4.13%) were not classified. LINEs also represented a significant fraction of Amborella BAC ends:
2.70% (I: 11.60%) of the total, 19.98% of all the repeats
(I: 22.22%). This is noteworthy because LINEs are usually
significantly less numerous than LTR retrotransposons in
plant genomes [43-47] with some notable exceptions, such
as the element del2 in Lilium speciosum [48]. The complete set of DNA TE-related BESs accounts for just 1.63%
(I: 4.51%) of the total, and the most represented classes are

Page 3 of 14

those of hAT and MuDR elements: 0.92% (I: 2.41%) and
0.49% (I: 1.04%) of the total BESs, respectively. Results
from the same analyses replicated on the set of 2,695 random sheared Sanger sequences (Table 1) and 648,519 454
reads (Table S1 in Additional file 1) are generally in very
good agreement with those obtained using BES data.
A de novo search for novel miniature inverted repeat
transposable elements (MITEs) overlooked by the similarity search approach was carried out using the pipeline
MUST [49]. The most abundant candidates identified by
the pipeline were manually inspected to confirm features
typical of MITEs, such as small size, terminal inverted
repeats, high A+T nucleotide content and target site
duplications. Three putative high-copy MITEs were
identified. All of these were small elements (174 to 500
bp) with terminal inverted repeats, target site duplications, and A+T content greater than 65% (Figure S3 in
Additional file 1). Repeat copy numbers estimated from
the BESs and random sheared sequences were extrapolated to obtain genome-wide estimates using the procedure developed by Hawkins et al. [50]. Copy number
ranges from 3,300 copies for MITE_2 to 17,000 copies
for MITE_1. The estimates inferred from BESs were
generally consistent with those calculated for random
sheared reads (with the possible exception of MITE_3;
Table 2).
The conserved reverse transcriptase domains of LTR
retrotransposons and LINEs were collected and used to
estimate maximum likelihood trees (Figure 1). In the case
of LTR retroelements, the trees indicate substitution rate
heterogeneity (that is, variation in root-to-tip distances)
and no evidence for recent retrotranspositional bursts of
single families (that is, short terminal branches). In the
case of LINEs, the phylogenetic tree displays very long
branches suggestive of an ancient diversification or very
rapid substitution rates. As has been described for other
plants [51], Amborella LINEs exhibit high sequence
divergence and extreme heterogeneity.
The Amborella BESs were also searched for microsatellites (that is, simple sequence repeats (SSRs)); for comparison, the search was also conducted on the Amborella
random sheared reads and on BESs (from other HindIII
BAC libraries) from Glycine (soybean) and Oryza rufipogon. In comparison to the other two species, Amborella
shows a higher frequency of SSRs, particularly mono- and
dinucleotide repeats, with a particularly high frequency of
‘AG’ dinucleotide microsatellites. The results of SSR analysis in BESs were confirmed by those obtained from the
randomly sheared Amborella sequences (Table 3).
Repeat profiles in the shotgun sequences were also
assessed using Tallymer to characterize K-mer frequencies [52]. The Amborella K-mer frequency profiles were
compared with those of Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza
sativa (rice), Sorghum bicolor and Zea mays (maize).

While the Amborella genome size is closest to Sorghum’s
(870 and 740 Mbp/C, respectively), its K-mer frequency
profiles were more similar to those of Arabidopsis and
rice, with much smaller genome sizes (157 and 490 Mbp/
1C, respectively [53]) (Figure 2).
Distribution of BESs with matches to protein-coding
regions of reference genomes

All BESs and shotgun sequences were compared to the
GenBank nr database using BLASTX [39] with an evalue threshold of 1e-5. After the removal of sequences
similar to TEs, the overall frequencies of sequences finding matches in the protein database were 11.9% and
8.05% for the BES and Sanger shotgun sequences,
respectively. For BESs from FPC contigs with ten or
more BACs, we found a negative correlation between
the frequencies of BESs matching protein-coding genes
and LTR retrotransposons (r = -0.423, P < 0.0001). As
has been described for other genomes [54-56], gene
density seems to be negatively correlated with retrotranposon density in the Amborella genome.

Identification of syntenic blocks between Amborella,
Arabidopsis, rice, poplar and grape

Taking advantage of the availability of a phase I physical
map assembly, we mapped the Amborella contigs onto the
genomes of A. thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera, and O. sativa. We focused on the 77 largest contigs
with at least 39 clones. BLAST analyses of BESs were done
within the context of their linkages within FPC contigs. All
of the contig BESs classified as repeats (see above) were
discarded. Those remaining were compared against the
four reference genomes. Because of the large evolutionary
time that separates Amborella from the other four
sequenced genomes [41,42,57], the comparisons were carried out at the protein level using tBLASTX; only the best
hits were taken into account. Amborella FPC contigs were
considered for further analyses if at least two BESs had
matches with bit scores greater than 80 (typically a maximum e-value of 1.0E-20 over 100 amino acidic residues)
to loci separated by less than 500 kb within one of the
four genomes being compared. Positive matches were
used as anchors to circumscribe 4-Mbp tracts within the

synteny with at least one of the four sequenced genomes,
and nine of these showed synteny with at least one region
in all four genomes. All BESs mapping to these syntenic
regions also exhibited significant matches to the
sequences in the Amborella cDNA assembly (Table 4;
Table S2 in Additional file 1). Whereas 25 of these
Amborella BAC contigs mapped to at least one tract in
the Vitis genome, 15, 16, and 24 contigs were found to be
syntenic with one or more tracts in the Oryza, Arabidopsis, and Populus genomes, respectively (Table S2 in Additional file 1). These results provide a novel, albeit coarse,
first view of the ancestral genome for all flowering plants
and the timing of rearrangements and other structural
changes (for example, genome duplications, fractionation,
chromosomal fissions and fusions) that have reduced
synteny between the monocot and eudicot genomes analyzed here (Figure 3). Parsimony mapping of synteny loss
onto a phylogeny consisting of Amborella and the other
four species indicates variation in rates of change in genome structure. In agreement with previous studies
[29,45], Vitis seems to have been the most stable of the

sequenced genomes, and the rate of change slowed in the
lineage leading to Populus following divergence from
the lineage leading to Arabidopsis (Figure 3).
Paleopolyploidy in angiosperm genomes

Paleopolyploidy events have been well characterized in
all four sequenced genomes analyzed here [29,45,58-60],
and the syntenic Amborella FPC contigs described
above often match multiple regions in these genomes.
The most ancient of these paleopolyploidy events is the
so-called g triplication that has been inferred to have
occurred before the divergence of the Asteridae (represented by tomato, Solanum lycopersicon) and the Rosidae, including Vitis, Populus and Arabidopsis [29].
Given the very incomplete view of the Amborella genome that is available in the BES data, we are not able to
assess synteny between Amborella FPC contigs. Nevertheless, comparisons between the Amborella contigs and
sets of syntenic blocks in the Vitis genome indicate that
the g triplication most likely occurred sometime after
the divergence of all other angiosperms from the lineage
leading to Amborella.
All BESs were compared to all annotated protein-coding genes in the Vitis genome placed within the context
of the pre-triplication ancestral gene blocks and post-triplication syntenic segments identified by Tang et al. [29].
A total of 328 Amborella FPC contigs had between two
and eight genes with significant best BLASTX matches
(e-values ≤1.0E-6) to Vitis genes corresponding to pretriplication gene blocks in the ancestral genome. In most
of these cases (199 of 328; Additional file 2), best hits
were distributed between two or three homeologous
(that is, post-triplication) syntenic Vitis genome segments. Of the remaining 129 Amborella FPC contigs
with BESs showing significant BLASTX hits to a single
Vitis subgenome (that is, single copy of a triplicated
ancestral block), most (113) included just 2 genes mapping to the ancestral Vitis gene blocks (14 including 3
genes, and 2 including 4 genes) (Additional file 2). All 21

FPC contigs with best BLASTX matches to five or more
genes within the ancestral Vitis blocks were distributed
among two or three post-triplication subgenomes. Complete sequences for the Amborella BAC contigs may
reveal more even distribution of segments among Vitis
subgenomes, but the results described here suggest that
triplication, fractionation and divergence of homeologous
segments in the Vitis genome postdate the divergence
between lineages leading to Vitis and Amborella (that is,
the last common ancestor of all extant angiosperms).
Analysis of complete sequences for two Amborella BAC
contigs

Two of the larger (approximately 500 kb) BAC contigs (IDs
431 and 1003) mapping to multiple segments in all four
sequenced reference genomes were identified for further
investigation. A minimum tiling path was constructed for
each contig, and florescence in situ hybridizations were
performed to verify that the BACs mapped to a single contiguous region in the Amborella genome (Figure 4). Each
BAC in the tiling paths was subcloned and sequenced to 8
× coverage on an ABI 3730xl sequencer. Gaps were closed
for each scaffold, and contiguous 487,318 and 629,678 bp
phase II sequences were assembled for contigs 431 and
1003, respectively.

The DAWGPAWS suite of scripts was used to organize
ab initio gene predictions, BLAST results and the output
of repeat identification tools [61,62]. Ab initio gene predictions were generated using FGENESH [63], AUGUSTUS [64], SNAP [65], GeneID [66] and GenScan [67]. In
addition, Amborella EST sequences produced by the 454
Titanium platform (2,943,273 reads; total read size of
approximately 776 Mbp; average read length of 263.60
bp) and Sanger sequencing (38,147 reads; total read size
of approximately 21.3 Mbp; average read length of 559.57
bp) were splice-aligned to the contigs using GMAP
(Genomic Mapping and Alignment Program) [68] with
the PASA (Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments)
genome annotation tool [69]. All predictions were manually compared with BLASTX results against gene annotations from Arabidopsis [70], Vitis [45], Z. mays [56],
Medicago [71], Oryza [72,73], and Sorghum [55] as well
as tBLASTx results against the Amborella transcript
assemblies. GBrowse views of gene annotations and
BLAST results for each contig are available at the Ancestral Angiosperm Genome Project website [25].
Rigorous assessments of synteny between these
Amborella contigs and the aforementioned four angiosperm genomes were performed using LASTZ [74,75].

genome show that contigs are syntenic with previously
triplicated blocks [29]. Regions of contig 1003 match
genes on syntenic segments of chromosomes 1, 14 and
17 in the Vitis genome (Figure 5) and contig 431
mapped to syntenic portions of Vitis chromosomes 6, 8
and 13 (Figure 6). These findings support the conclusion
from the BES analyses suggesting that the g triplication
occurred after the first branching event in the phylogeny
of extant angiosperms.

At least two genome duplications (r and s) have been
inferred to have occurred within the monocot lineage
leading to rice since divergence of monocots and eudicots [28]. These duplications were evident in comparisons with both Amborella contigs. Regions of contig
1003 were found to be syntenic with portions of rice
chromosomes 2 and 4 derived from the r duplication
and a portion of chromosome 10 (Figure 5) that is related
to these two regions through the earlier s duplication
[28]. The LASTZ analysis of contig 431 revealed synteny
with seven regions in the rice genome (Figure 6) and one
of the ‘putative ancestral regions’ (PAR 17) characterized
by Tang et al. [28]. These PARs were defined as regions
of synteny between the rice and Vitis genomes. Phylogenetic analyses of genes in Amborella contig 431 and syntenic regions of the rice and Vitis genomes may elucidate
the timing of the g triplication and genome duplications

evident in synteny analyses of the rice genome relative to
the divergence of monocots and eudicots.
Phylogenetic analyses of gene families represented in
sequenced Amborella contigs

While the fractionation process has resulted in the loss of
most duplicated genes following the ancient polyploidy
events evident in the syntenic Vitis and rice segments
shown in Figures 5 and 6, duplicate Vitis genes have been
retained for homologs of three Amborella genes located
on contig 431 (Figures 6a). These genes were used to
search the PlantTribes gene family database [35]. The
three gene sets identified in the synteny analysis correspond to three gene families (auxin-independent growth
promoter, ceramidase and plant uncoupling mitochondrial
protein) circumscribed through OrthoMCL clustering [76]
of gene annotations from the available Arabidopsis, Carica
(papaya), Populus, Medicago (alfalfa), Glycine, Cucumis
(cucumber), Vitis, Mimulus, Oryza, Sorghum, Selaginella
(spike moss) and Physcomitrella genomes. Homologous
genes sampled from exemplar asterid, ranunculid, nongrass monocot and gymnosperm species were obtained
from EST assembly databases [25,77,78] and were added

Page 9 of 14

to each gene family set. Sequences in each gene family set
were aligned using MUSCLE [79], and RAxML [80] run
with the GTRGAMMA substitution model was used to
obtain maximum likelihood estimates of gene trees.
Inspection of the resulting gene trees shows support for
the inference drawn from the BAC end sequence analysis.
The g triplication (hexaploidy event) clearly occurred
after Amborella diverged from other extant angiosperm
lineages (Figure 7). The placement of the g triplication
with respect to the divergence of monocots and eudocots
or core eudicots and the Ranunculales varies among the
three gene trees. This incongruence among gene trees is
likely due to artifacts associated with substitution rate
variation and insufficient taxon sampling. Analyses of
additional gene families with broader taxon sampling will
be necessary to obtain better resolution for the timing of
the g triplication with respect to the divergence of monocot, eudicots, Ranunculales (that is, ‘basal’ eudicots) and
core eudocots.

Conclusions
A. trichopoda is the sister species to the large clade
encompassing all other extant flowering plants. As such,

gene families. The gene trees show divergence of genes on Amborella contig 431 diverging from lineages leading to Vitis g homeologs mapping
to syntenic blocks on chromosomes 6, 8 and 13 (shown in red). Genes sampled from major angiosperm lineages are highlighted.

comparative analyses of Amborella and other flowering
plants offer a uniquely informative perspective on the
most recent common ancestor of all extant angiosperms.
The physical map and BAC end sequences described in
this study provide a low-resolution view of the Amborella genome. Nonetheless, these data shed light on
genomic features of the last common ancestor of flowering plants. Moreover, the Amborella genome provides a
unique reference for understanding genome evolution
throughout angiosperm history. When placed in the
context of the physical map, BESs representing just 5.4%
of the Amborella genome allowed reconstruction of
ancestral gene blocks in regions represented by 29 BAC
contigs and inference of the timing of structural mutations that disrupted these blocks (Figure 3).
Analyses of BESs and BAC contigs also indicate that
the ancient g polyploidy event inferred from the Arabidopsis [58], Carica [81], Populus [60], and Vitis [45]
genomes occurred after the Amborella lineage diverged
from the rest of the angiosperms. Therefore, if the origin of angiosperms was associated with a genome duplication as has been hypothesized elsewhere [16,20,23],
that polyploidy event predated the g event.

Materials and methods
BAC library construction

Protocols for DNA megabase preparation, library construction, picking and arraying proposed in Luo and
Wing [82] were followed.
Fingerprinting

The SNaPshot fingerprinting technique was adopted
[32] with the modifications described by Kim et al. [83].
Snapshot reactions were loaded into ABI 3730xl DNA
sequencers. Analysis of data for each contig was carried
out using the ABI Data Collection Program.
Physical map construction

Fingerprints were assembled into contigs using the program FPC version 7.2 [34]. The initial assembly was carried out using a Sulston score threshold of e-50
followed by three rounds of dequeuing at the same
stringency and auto-merging of contigs at e-21.
BAC end extraction and sequencing

BAC DNA was extracted and end sequenced from
36,684 clones using the methods described by Ammiraju
et al. [83,84]. Sequence quality assessment and trimming
were carried out using the programs Phred [85] and
Lucy [86].
Random sheared library

A random sheared library was constructed as previously
described [87].

Page 10 of 14

cDNA sequencing and assembly

Additional Sanger ESTs were generated from available
male and female flower bud cDNA libraries [10] (Table
4). Libraries for 454 sequencing were constructed from
the tissues listed in Table 4 using the Mint cDNA
synthesis kit (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia). Total RNAs for
cDNA synthesis were isolated using a combination of
CTAB extraction and the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen
Valencia, CA USA) as previously described for basal
angiosperms [11]. Two rounds of messenger RNA isolation were performed with the Poly(A)Purist™ mRNA
Purification Kit (Ambion Inc. Austin, TX USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Contaminant DNA was removed with DNA-free™ (Ambion
Inc.) and mRNA quality was verified using a Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Inc. Santa Clara, CA, United States). Vector
and adaptor sequences were trimmed from 454 Titanium (2,943,273 reads; total read size of approximately
776 Mbp; average read length of 263.60 bp) and Sanger
sequences (38,147 reads; total read size of approximately
21.3 Mbp; average read length of 559.57 bp) using seqclean [88] and assembled using MIRA [89].
Similarity searches, repeat classification and contig
anchoring

Similarity searches were carried out using the programs
BLASTN and BLASTX [39]. BLASTN was run under
relaxed settings (-q -4 -r 5) in order to accommodate the
evolutionary distance between Amborella and the species
included in the repeat databases used; the significance
threshold was set at 1e-10. In the case of BLASTX
searches the threshold was set at 1e-5 or 1e-4 for the BES
synteny analysis. tBLASTX was used to anchor the contigs to the reference genomes (see Results for details).
Databases

The databases used in similarity searches were RepBase
version 15.08 [38], the GenBank non-redundant (nr)
database, and the Oryza, Arabidopsis, Vitis and Populus
genome sequences.
Validation of repeat searches and MITE identification

The program MUST [49] was used for de novo characterization of highly repeated sequences; results were
then inspected for the presence of MITE features.
Inverted repeats were identified manually parsing the
results of dot-plot comparisons made using the program
‘Dotter’ [90].
Simple sequence repeat searches

Microsatellites were identified using the program Sputnik [91]. SSR composition, length and distribution were
parsed and analyzed using the tools and the strategy
used by Morgante et al. [92].

Zuccolo et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R48

Fluorescence in situ hybridization

FPC contigs were validated by hybridizing BAC DNAs
to Amborella chromosome squashes. DNA was prepared
for BAC mapping to the middle and both ends of BAC
contigs 431 and 1003 and used to prepare fluorescently
labeled BAC-FISH probes. Chromosome squashes were
prepared from root tips and labeled BAC-FISH probes
were prepared as described by Xiong et al. [93].
Contig sequencing and annotation

Minimum tiling paths of seven and six BACs were identified for contigs 1003 and 431, respectively, by the visual
inspection of the FPC assemblies. Adjacent clones were
chosen based on their reciprocal position and probability
value associated to their overlapping fingerprinted bands
as shown by FPC. Sequencing of selected minimum tiling
path BACs was done to phase II quality as previously
described [73]. Phase II BAC sequences were then
assembled into 1003 and 431 contig sequences based on
dot plot comparisons and overlap similarity between adjacent clones.
Perl scripts available from the DAWGPAWS package
[61,62] were used to convert computational annotation
results from multiple sources into a single GFF3 file for
combined evidence annotation in Apollo [94] and publication in Gbrowse [95]. Ab initio gene annotation programs
used in this process included FGENESH [63] AUGUSTUS
[64], SNAP [65], GeneID [66] and GenScan [67]. Because
Amborella-specific gene model parameterizations were
not available for these programs, multiple plant models
were used for each ab initio program. The sequence of the
entire contig was BLASTx (e < 1 × 10-5) searched against
gene annotations from Arabidopsis [70], Vitis [45],
Z. mays [56], Medicago [71], Oryza [72], and Sorghum [55]
as well as tBLASTx (e < 1 × 10-5) searched against a database of comprehensive Amborella transcript assemblies
[25]. In addition, Amborella EST sequences (reads and
assemblies; Table 4) were splice-aligned to the contigs
using GMAP (Genomic Mapping and Alignment Program) [68] with the PASA (Program to Assemble Spliced
Alignments) genome annotation tool [69]. The gene models and BLAST search results were manually combined
into gene models using the Apollo genome annotation
curation tool [94].
Synteny analysis of sequenced BAC contigs with Vitis and
Oryza genomes

Sequenced Amborella BAC contigs 431 (487,318 bp)
and 1003 (629,678 bp) were compared to the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) rice
genome assembly (version 5) and the Genoscope 12 ×
Vitis genome assembly using LASTZ and default parameters. Prior to LASTZ comparisons, all genomic
sequences were masked using NCBI’s WindowMasker

Page 11 of 14

to remove simple repeats. Significant matches after
repeat masking were visualized as dot plots. Gene annotations for the rice and Vitis genomes were obtained
from the Rice Annotation Project [96] and Genoscope
[97], respectively, and plotted on the vertical axes of the
dot plots (Figures 5 and 6). FGENESH [63] annotations
for the Amborella contigs were included on the horizontal axes of the dot plots. LASTZ scores were summed
for all aligned Amborella-rice or Amborella-Vitis blocks
within 100 kb of each other in sequenced genomes. All
regions with summed scores >100,000 were considered
as syntenic and included in Figures 5 and 6.
Phylogenetic analysis

All alignments were carried out using the program
‘MUSCLE’ [79] run under default settings. Maximum
likelihood analyses were run on aligned DNA and
amino acid sequences using RAxML [80] and the
GTRGAMMA nucleotide substitution model.
Submission of data to GenBank databases

BESs (HR616970 to HR686434), full-length BAC
sequences (AC243594.1 to AC243606.1), Sanger shotgun
sequences (HR614237 to HR616931), 454 shotgun
sequences (SRP006044), Sanger ESTs (FD425831.1 to
FD443502.1) and 454 cDNA sequences (SRX018174,
SRX018165, SRX018164, SRX018163, SRX018157,
SRX018156) have been deposited in the appropriate
NCBI GenBank sequence databases. All sequences are
also available at the Ancestral Angiosperm Genome Project website [25].
