Abstract
Background: Nematoda diverged from other animals between 600–1,200 million years ago and
has become one of the most diverse animal phyla on earth. Most nematodes are free-living animals,
but many are parasites of plants and animals including humans, posing major ecological and
economical challenges around the world.
Results: We investigated phylum-specific molecular characteristics in Nematoda by exploring over
214,000 polypeptides from 32 nematode species including 27 parasites. Over 50,000 nematode
protein families were identified based on primary sequence, including ~10% with members from at
least three different species. Nearly 1,600 of the multi-species families did not share homology to
Pfam domains, including a total of 758 restricted to Nematoda. Majority of the 462 families that
were conserved among both free-living and parasitic species contained members from multiple
nematode clades, yet ~90% of the 296 parasite-specific families originated only from a single clade.
Features of these protein families were revealed through extrapolation of essential functions from
observed RNAi phenotypes in C. elegans, bioinformatics-based functional annotations, identification
of distant homology based on protein folds, and prediction of expression at accessible nematode
surfaces. In addition, we identified a group of nematode-restricted sequence features in energygenerating electron transfer complexes as potential targets for new chemicals with minimal or no
toxicity to the host.
Conclusion: This study identified and characterized the molecular determinants that help in
defining the phylum Nematoda, and therefore improved our understanding of nematode protein
evolution and provided novel insights for the development of next generation parasite control
strategies.

Background
The phylum Nematoda (roundworms) is one of the most
common phyla of animals, estimated to contain over a
million species [1]. Over 20,000 nematode species have
been described [2], most of them are free-living but many
are successful parasites of humans, animals, and plants,
causing diseases of major socio-economic importance
globally. Nearly three billion people are infected by the
three most prevalent soil-transmitted intestinal worms,
including roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides), whipworms
(Trichuris trichiura), and hookworms (Necator americanus
and Ancylostoma ceylanicum) [3]. Tissue-dwelling filarial
nematodes infect at least a billion people, causing river
blindness (Onchocerca volvulus), elephantiasis (Wuchereria
bancrofti and Brugia malayi), etc. In agriculture, the current
financial losses caused by parasites to domesticated animals and crops greatly affect farm profitability and exacerbate challenges to global food production and
distribution. For example, the root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne spp. and the cyst species (Globodera and Heterodera) cause an estimated $100 billion in annual damage
[4].
Nematodes are believed to have diverged evolutionarily
from other animals between 600–1,200 million years ago
[2]. Proteins encoded by their genomes have experienced
drastic changes since then, as evident in both expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) [5-7] and genomes [8,9], and many
are closely related to functional diversification, speciation, and species adaptation [10-14]. Among them are the
nematode-specific proteins, which bear crucial importance for understanding nematode biology and parasitism
[15-17]. In addition, studies on the proteins unique to
nematodes can illustrate the roles of different genetic
mechanisms, such as gene duplication and degeneration,
retroposition, and de novo origination, in the emergence
of novel proteins and protein families in nematodes. Furthermore, proteins that are specific to the pathogen or
have sufficiently diverged from those in the host can be
good targets for drugs with low toxicity to the host and the
environment. Examples of such differential drug activities
are antibiotics such as β-lactam and streptomycin and
many anti-fungals [18].
Despite the importance of nematode-specific proteins and
protein families, their representations are extremely limited in public databases. For example, 2,635 of the 8,296
protein families in Pfam-A [19,20] (v20) include nematode sequences, yet only 78 of them contain no members
from non-nematode species and are thus putative nematode-specific families. This under-representation is a result
of the quality control measures applied by the existing
protein domain databases, such as Pfam, to restrict the
sequences they incorporate to only the full length-proteins or those predicted from complete genomes [19].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/114

Work by our laboratory and others have generated the vast
majority of sequences currently available for many parasites from the phylum Nematoda as ESTs and genome survey sequences (GSSs) [21,22]. For example,
transcriptomes of 38 nematode species, 32 of which are
parasites of vertebrates or plants, have been sampled to
generate over 510,000 ESTs [23]. However, putative nematode coding sequences among these ESTs and GSSs have
never been explored systematically for the identification
of nematode-specific protein-coding features.
To extend our and others' investigation of nematode evolution based on pan-phylum analyses [7,24,25], we have
undertaken the challenge of identifying nematode-specific (or restricted) protein families using high-throughput computational methods developed to detect highly
conserved coding regions in a robust fashion. From over
214,000 polypeptides in 32 nematode species including
27 parasites, we identified 758 protein families that were
conserved in various nematode subgroups across the phylum Nematoda but were not represented in Pfam-A. These
proteins were conserved in at least three species, therefore
prospectively with essential functions, making them
excellent candidates for the understanding of nematode
evolution as well as targets for the broad control of nematodes. With cautions on the incompleteness of the currently available phylogenetic sampling, these nematode
protein families were further categorized and characterized at functional and at structural levels. Most of them
were conserved proteins with no functional annotations
identified, a fraction of which were found to contain distant structural homology that may infer putative functions.

Results and discussion
Sequence organization
Sequence data is available for many nematode species primarily because of the recent sampling of nematode transcriptomes using ESTs [21,22]. In this study, a total of
130,357 contig-level EST consensus sequences, assembled
from 262,497 ESTs from 29 nematode species, were translated into putative primary sequences of nematode proteins (Table 1). In addition, the complete gene-sets of
84,408 proteins from five genome sequencing projects (3
Caenorhabditis species, B. malayi, and Ancylostoma caninum) were added. Hence, a total of 214,159 polypeptides/
proteins from 32 nematode species in four nematode
clades were used for the subsequent analysis (Table 1).
The complete dataset is available online for retrieval [26].
Building nematode protein families
Protein families were built using MCL clustering [27] with
the Markov cluster algorithm (MCL), which would not
suffer greatly from potential problems caused by multidomain proteins, promiscuous domains, or fragmented

sequences. In total, the 214,159 nematode coding
sequences were clustered into 54,036 protein families.
Protein families conserved across multiple species suggest
conserved features and essential functions, therefore a
total of 5,326 multi-species families (112,271 sequences),
with members from at least three different nematode species, were chosen for further evaluation. Of these, 1,939
protein families (36%) did not share homology to protein
family models in Pfam-A (Figure 1).
A protein family built by MCL can include multiple EST
contigs originating from a single gene. To reduce this
redundancy, we first clustered EST contigs into EST clusters, each containing a group of contigs likely representing
the same gene [28-31]. Then a step-wise approach was
implemented for each MCL family to: i) generate a multiple alignment from all members, ii) build a Hidden

Markov model (HMM) from the multiple alignment, iii)
calculate a matching score for each member of the family
based on the HMM, and iv) retain only the single EST contig from each EST cluster assigned with the best matching
score as the sole representative of the gene in the protein
family. Finally, an additional filtering step required each
valid family to have at least 10% (in length) of its full
alignment contributed simultaneously by sequences from
3 or more species. All of the above led to the identification
of 1,593 multi-species non-Pfam Nematode protein Families (NFs) with a total of 13,963 coding sequences (Figure
1).

the NR-noNema database (all protein sequences in the
non-redundant NR database except those from nematodes), at a BLAST e-value cutoff of 1.0e-03, identified 835
NFs (8,764 proteins) containing homology in non-nematode species although they were derived from nematodes
(Figure 1) (see Additional file 1). Approximately 90% of
these NFs shared primary sequence similarities to arthropod proteins, among which 26 families (NFa; 212
sequences) were found to be homologous only to
sequences from arthropods but not to any proteins from
non-nematode and non-arthropod species at a BLAST evalue cutoff of 1.0e-03 (see Additional file 2). Molecular
features conserved in the sequences of both nematodes
and arthropods were evident in these families, such as
small insertions/deletions [see Additional file 3]. Both
Nematoda and Arthropoda belong to Ecdysozoa, sharing
the common pattern of growth-by-molting [32,33], therefore these protein families likely reflect the evolutionary
conservation between these organisms at the molecular
level. In addition, macrocyclic lactones, such as avermection and milbemycin, have been successfully used as
endectocides to treat both the nematode endoparasites
and arthropod ectoparasites simultaneously [34]. Hence,
the 26 NFs that were conserved only among nematodes
and arthropods could be potential targets for the development of novel endectocides. Interestingly, five of the 26

families were mapped to canonical KEGG metabolic
enzymes [35-37] as various subunits of the electron transfer Complex I [see Additional file 2].
The remaining 758 NF families (5,199 sequences) did not
contain members with sequence similarities to any nonnematode proteins with the BLAST e-value cutoff of 1.0e03 (Figure 1). With no obvious homology to either nonnematode proteins or Pfam-A entries, they became candidate novel protein families specific (or restricted) to nematodes. Their conservation among multiple nematode
species, especially of those spanning all the four nematode clades (Table 2) (phylogeny based on [38]) included
in this study (see below), suggests that they may have
emerged in early nematode ancestors after they diverged
from other animals, and they may include the molecular
determinants archetypical to the phylum Nematoda.
Although their nematode-specificity implies only limited
knowledge currently available, close investigation will
likely reveal conserved functions essential to many nematodes, and the interference with their functions will likely
cause severe damaging effects in nematode parasites in a
novel, safe, and broad fashion.
In addition, by comparing to a database containing all the
currently available sequences from free-living nematodes

(at a BLAST e-value cutoff of 1.0e-05), these nematoderestricted NFs were further divided into 296 NFp (putatively specific to parasitic nematodes) [see Additional file
4] and 462 NFn (conserved across both free-living and
parasitic nematodes) [see Additional file 5]. The NFp and
NFn groups contained 1,514 and 3,685 proteins, respectively, averaging at 5 and 8 members per family with different family size distributions [see Additional files 1 and
6], suggesting differences between the two groups. In
addition, while the majority in the NFp group (90%) contained members from only a single nematode clade, a
similar number of NFn families were found to span 1, 2,
or 3 nematode clades respectively (~31% of all NFn for
each) (Figure 2). These results indicate that proteins
within the NFn families are conserved in more evolutionarily divergent nematode species and are thus likely
involved in essential nematode function across the phylum Nematoda; on the other hand, the NFp families tend
to be restricted to smaller evolutionary niches and are
most likely related to the specific patterns of parasitism
that were hypothesized to emerge independently, at multiple times, during nematode evolution [38].
NF families containing C. elegans members with RNAi

tions via transcript knockdown in many organisms, and
especially in C. elegans [39-42]. However, applying RNAi
in parasitic nematodes possesses significant challenges.
For example, their obligate parasitic life cycles, with
movement into and out of the host, make both the delivery of double-stranded RNA and the assessment of phenotype difficult. Although successes have been demonstrated
in several parasitic nematode species (reviewed in
[21,43]), these methodologies are far from established for
large-scale investigation.
Gene functions derived from RNAi experiments in C. elegans can be further extrapolated, to an extent, to orthologous genes in other nematodes [21]. The NFp families did
not have members from the free-living C. elegans. A total
of 356 of the 462 NFn families had C. elegans members,
most of them (321) had RNAi results available. Among
them, 85 families contained C. elegans genes associated
with non-wild type RNAi phenotypes, including 62 with
strongly deleterious effects (Emb, Ste, Stp, Lva, Lvl, and
Gro) [see Additional file 5]. Such RNAi results could shed
light on the putative functions of their counterparts in
other nematodes included in the same protein families.
For example, NF_0208_1522 contained two members
from each of the three clade V free-living Caenorhabditis
species, as well as four from animal parasites (AC02485
and OS00413 from clade V and SS02646 and PT01276
from clade IVa), and one from the clade IVb plant parasite
M. incognita (MI03217). The inclusion of the two C. elegans insulin-like genes, ins-17 and ins-18, suggested that
this family represented a group of conserved nematode
proteins likely regulating the growth and lifespan as demonstrated by RNAi in C. elegans.

Phylogenetic distribution by members of the NFn and NFp
Phylogenetic distribution by members of the NFn
and NFp families. A similar number of NFn families were
found to span 1, 2, or 3 nematode clades respectively (~31%
for each). In contrast, the majority in the NFp group (90%)
contained members from only a single nematode clade.

Furthermore, the distribution of these RNAi results
among NFn families showed that families conserved in
nematodes spanning a broader evolutionary distance,
especially those with members from all the four nematode clades included in this study, were much more likely
to have observable phenotypes with RNAi knockdown in
C. elegans (Figure 3). This suggested that these multi-clade
NFn families, which might have emerged in the early
common ancestors of Nematoda and remained to be conserved in many nematode species since then, could be the
most essential genes required for nematode survival.
NF families with functional annotations
Based on sequence similarities, members of the NFs were
mapped to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG), which offers curated information
about genes and proteins, as well as molecular wirings of
interactions and reaction networks especially in the
canonical metabolic pathways [36,37]. As expected for
these novel families, none of the NFp members could be
mapped, and the limited assignments for the NFn families
were always derived from their C. elegans members that

were previously annotated by KEGG [see Additional file
5]. In addition, for each of the eight NFn families mapped
through KEGG, a same KEGG Orthology (KO) entry was
always assigned consistently to all of its family members
meeting the mapping criteria (Table 3), confirming that
the family members grouped by MCL were indeed homologous proteins.
Unexpectedly, all the eight KEGG entries assigned to NFn
proteins, such as the various subunits of electron-transfer

complexes (Table 3), were canonical enzymes with extensive knowledge available, including sequences of orthologous groups from many non-nematode species. It was
intriguing because the proteins included in these nematode families, especially the C. elegans members that had
been previously annotated in KEGG, had to contain a fair
amount of sequence homology to be recognized as the
canonical enzymes, yet they were found without similarities to any non-nematode proteins by our discovery pipeline. Close examination showed that this conflict was
caused by a slightly looser requirement of homology during the KEGG mapping. Therefore, the putative annotation assigned to these nematode proteins represented the
relatively low levels of sequence similarities that were still
able to reveal their functions with confidence.
More interestingly, we were able to identify unique
sequence features of these nematode proteins, such as
nematode-specific insertions and deletions, in all the
eight NFn families with KEGG annotations. Such nematode-specific features may have prevented their homology
from being identified in our initial screening. For example, members of NFn family NF_0313_0956 were
mapped to KO: K03951 as the NADH dehydrogenase
(ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex 7. Indeed, these nematode sequences could be forcibly aligned with the group of
proteins from non-nematode organisms that were
assigned to the same KEGG entry, after allowing two fragments of nematode-specific insertions (Figure 4). The lack
of a homologous 3D model of this enzyme made it
impossible to investigate the impact on its structure
caused by these insertions, but they likely created additional loops in the nematode proteins that may introduce
novel functional features specific to Nematoda. These
results demonstrated the mechanism of directed diversifi-

nematode evolution.
Energy generation in nematodes
Energy generation mechanisms are extremely complicated
in nematodes. Free-living nematodes, such as C. elegans,
rely on mammalian-type aerobic electron transfer for the
generation of ATP. However, this oxygen-based energy
generation mechanism is thought to be unlikely for many
parasites because of the low levels of oxygen in their parasitic environments and the lack of an efficient circulatory
system and respiratory organs in nematodes. Instead, an
anaerobic energy generation independent of oxygen has
been suggested. Studies of the clade III intestinal parasite
Ascaris suum have revealed that a developmental switch
around stage L3, wherein an anaerobic pathway in adults,
named the malate dismutation pathway or the PEPCKsuccinate pathway, replaces the mammalian-type aerobic
energy generation found in embryos and larvae [44-47].
Our previous investigation of the adult transcriptome
from another clade III parasite Dirofilaria immitis has suggested a similar mechanism [28].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/114

With KEGG mapping, we identified a total of six components of the well-defined energy-generating electron
transfer complexes among NFn families, each with relatively weak yet clear homology to the canonical enzymes.
Based on this, and the finding that five NFa families conserved in only nematodes and arthropods were also
mapped to the same pathway [see Additional file 4], we
propose that the early common ancestors of nematodes
may have obtained a series of novel features in their
energy generation to collectively and cooperatively
accommodate the severe challenges imposed by the different life styles found in complex parasitism, and that those
NFa families may have represented an intermediate evolutionary path, which would have emerged in the common
ancestors of Ecdysozoa, that leads to unique features specific to Nematoda. This phyla-specific energy generation
mechanism, significantly distinct from the canonical
pathway of oxidative phosphorylation used by mammalian hosts, offers a prime target for the development of
next generation parasite control strategies with potentially
high specificity and minimal toxicity.

included SS00822 (Strongyloides stercoralis), 14968.m01483 (Brugia malayi), F45H10.3 (Caenorhabditis elegans), gi-39591288-embCAE73341.1-(Caenorhabditis briggsae), cr01.Contig9.wum.334.1 (Caenorhabditis remanei), AE04133 (Ancylostoma ceylanicum),

NF families with distant sequence homology
To offer further characterization, NF families were
scanned against the InterPro database [48] for generic
sequence features [see Additional files 4 and 5]. Not surprisingly, even with both KEGG and InterPro mappings,
we were able to obtain information for only 30 NFp and
124 NFn families, leaving the majority of the NF families
(~80%, 606/758) completely un-annotated.

Protein structure diverges more slowly than primary
sequence [49], therefore fold similarity and structurebased alignments were used for the detection of distant
homology of the 606 NF families with no KEGG or InterPro annotation. Firstly, we generated predictions of basic
structural information for each, including secondary
structure, domain architecture, and flexible/dynamic
regions. These predictions are integrated and displayed
within a customized genome browser [50] for easy navigation [26]. Secondly, structural homology to previously
defined protein folds in Protein Data Bank (PDB) [51] or
Pfam [19,20] were searched for using a newly improved
version of the meta-predictor, Meta-BASIC [52], which
combines sequence profile, secondary structure, and prediction of the burial states of individual amino acid with
various scoring systems and meta profile alignment algorithms. The putative matches with a confident 3D-Jury
cutoff score of 50, which corresponds to a false positive
rate of less than 5% [49], are available online via graphic
display [26]. Of the 3,926 sequences from the 606 families, we were able to identify putative homology for 56
polypeptides from 9 families to known protein folds in
PDB, and 14 in 11 families to those in Pfam [see Additional files 4 and 5]. Close investigation of such distant
homology can help to elucidate potential function (as
described below).
An example is family NF_0103_0974 with a domain of
136 amino acids conserved in all the five members. Several structure prediction methods included in MetaBASIC, such as the homology modeling tool FFAS3 [53]
and threading algorithms 3D-PSSM [54] and INUB [55],
all assigned this conserved domain as a match to the PDB
entry 1buqa, which was classified as the structure signature for a group of nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) like
proteins. Further structural modeling using Modeller [56]
showed that the nematode domain contained all the
major components of this fold. The NTF2-like superfamily contains members with diverse functions, including enzymes such as enscytalone dehydratase, delta-5-3ketosteroid isomerase, and limonene-1,2-epoxide hydrolase, and non-enzymatic homologues such as NTF2 [57].
Even though none of these functions could be clearly
assigned to NF_0103_0974, the presence of a cysteine
cluster might suggest the existence of zinc binding site in
these nematode proteins (Figure 5).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/114

NF families on accessible surfaces
Proteins secreted or expressed at surfaces are essential
components of the cellular regulatory networks that
ensure proper interactions with the environment for survival. Thus far, all the commercially available
anthelmintics have a gain-of-function mode of action targeting channels and receptors associated with membranes
[58]. In addition, nematode antigens are believed to be
most effective when secreted from glands [59] or
expressed on exposed surfaces such as the intestinal
lumen in hookworm [60], where they come into contact
with and are therefore targeted by effector molecules from
the host immune system. Among the NFn and NFp families, there were 45% and 27%, respectively, having signal
peptide for secretion predicted in their sequences, and
26% and 21%, respectively, containing members predicted to have both signal peptide and transmembrane
domains. With the caution that some of these predictions
might be putative targeting signals for transport to intracellular compartments such as mitochondria or peroxisomes, we were able to identify 149 NF families, from the
total of 758, as candidates for expression at accessible surfaces [see Additional files 4 and 5].

The intestine has been our focus in other studies [61],
because it is one of the major organs in nematodes creating a key surface at the intestinal apical membrane to
interact with the environment. The easy accessibility of
the nematode intestine has made it an attractive target for
immune or chemical control of parasitic species [62-67].

acids, conserved in all the five members of NF_0103_0974,
were computationally simulated based on its distant homology to the PDB entry 1buqa. All the major components of
1buqa were preserved in this nematode domain, and the
presence of a cysteine cluster might suggest a zinc-binding
site.

H. contortus identified a group of 241 protein families
(IntFam-241) expressed in the intestine of all three nematodes. This group was further proposed to represent an
ancient group of intestinal proteins responsible for the
core intestinal functions in many nematode species [61].
There were 12 NFn families from this study overlapping
with the IntFam-241. Majority of them (11/12) spanned
three or more nematode clades, and eleven had predictions of either signal peptides or transmembrane
sequences [see Additional files 4 and 5]. In addition, all of
the 12 NFn families had C. elegans members with RNAi
information available, and all but two of them had
observable RNAi phenotypes [see Additional file 5 and
Additional file 6], suggesting that they warrant further
investigation.

Conclusion
Genomics studies of parasites from the phylum Nematoda have been mainly restricted to EST-based surveys of
transcriptomes [23]. Beyond C. elegans, more than
520,000 ESTs have been generated from more than 40
species. As next-generation sequencing technologies drive
cost down significantly, the sequencing of complete
genomes of many eukaryotic species, including parasitic
nematodes, can be foreseen in the near future. Nematologists currently have genome sequences available from
nine nematode species including three parasites. The first
annotated genome of a parasitic nematode, Brugia malayi,
contained over 11,000 genes [68]. Recently the genome of
plant parasite Meloidogyne incognita became available with
over 19,000 genes [69]. New anti-parasitic drug targets
were identified through investigations of both genomes.
The human parasite T. spiralis is a significant food safety
concern and an evolutionary out-group to many other
nematodes [70]. The annotation of its genome has been
completed and extensive comparative studies are currently underway (Mitreva, unpublished). In the next five
years, collaborative projects at the Genome Center at
Washington University and the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute will increase the available parasitic nematode
sequences by another order of magnitude, adding a total
of 25 draft genomes supplemented by numerous cDNA
reads with pyrosequencing. However, we anticipate that
their complete annotated genomes are still 2–4 years
away. Until then, transcriptomic data will remain the
main source of information for the investigation of nematodes at the molecular level.
Currently, the primary control of parasitic nematode
infection is based upon chemical treatments
(anthelmintics). However, the incomplete protective
response of the host and the acquisition of anthelmintic
resistance by an increasing number of parasitic nematodes
have hampered what used to be effective control strategies. Moreover, the use of drugs poses the risk of residue
problems in meat, milk, and the environment. With

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/114

minor exceptions, vaccines do not exist against parasitic
nematodes of mammals, although immunity can develop
against many of these pathogens. Hence, better understanding of the unique molecular characteristics in nematodes and a way of target prioritization is essential.
The pan-phylum analyses presented here demonstrate
how genomics-based methods can offer a growing and
fundamental information base, which, when coupled
with extensive functional and structural annotations, can
improve our understanding of the protein evolution in
the phylum Nematoda through identification and characterization of the unique molecular features, and provide
useful information in the identification and characterization of target proteins for the development of vaccines
and next-generation anthelmintic drugs with a broad
application.

Methods
Partial and complete genomes
Detailed information on genetic materials and cDNA
library construction are available online [23,26]. ESTs
were processed and clustered as described earlier [28-31].
EST contig sequences were translated individually by
Prot4EST, a 6-tier translation pipeline combining both
similarity-based methods and de novo predictions [71,72].
Only one translation was accepted to represent each EST
contig, during which false translation was likely reduced
by retaining preferably the longest open reading frame
with strong supporting evidence, if available, in the form
of similarities to known or predicted proteins. The genesets from the genomic sequencing projects were: C. elegans
(Wormbase v158; 23,162 proteins), C. briggsae (downloaded June, 2006; 19,723 proteins), C. remanei (preliminary set, October, 2005; 25,775 proteins), B. malayi
(11,750 proteins), and A. caninum (preliminary set; 4,038
proteins).
Sequence comparison
WU-BLASTP (wordmask = seg postsw) was used to query
the translated sequences against protein databases, and
WU-TBLASTN (wordmask = seg lcmask) for searching
against nucleotide databases [73]. Databases used for
sequence comparisons were: i) NR-noNema, containing
all sequences from the non-redundant protein database
NR except those from nematodes (downloaded 06/06/
2007), ii) NR-noNema-noArthropoda, NR sequences
with those originated from nematode and arthropod species removed (downloaded 06/06/2007), iii) Free-living,
all the 71,496 protein sequences from the free living species C. elegans, C. briggsae, C. remanei, P. pacificus, and Z.
punctata.
Building nematode protein families using MCL clustering
An all-against-all WU-BLASTP was performed on the total
of 214,159 translated sequences from the 32 nematode

species. Raw BLAST results were fed to a C-language
implementation of Markov cluster algorithm [74], a fast
and scalable unsupervised clustering algorithm based on
simulation of flow in graphs [27]. MCL simulates flow in
a protein similarity graph, assigning complete protein
sequences into families based on density and strength
between them. It makes no attempt to decompose the
sequences into their component domains, but rather produces protein clusters that correlate well with the overall
domain architecture. The tightness of MCL clustering is
determined by a user-defined parameter, the inflation factor. A larger inflation factor leads to a higher granularity of
clustering, resulting in the generation of protein families
based more likely on local domains and less likely on global similarities. To avoid such high granularity, we validated the clustering with three inflation factors, 1.6, 1.8,
and 2.0, respectively. With them, the numbers of protein
families differed by only 5% (data not shown). After manual inspection, the inflation factor of 1.8 was chosen to
generate 54,036 protein families for further screening and
downstream analysis. HMM screening against Pfam-A
entries (v20; 8,296 entries) [19,20] were performed using
hmmpfam in HMMER v2.1 at a p-value cut-off 1.0e-05. To
remove sequence redundancy, an automatic screening
pipeline was implemented to: i) generate multiple alignments for each family with MUSCLE v3.52 [75], ii) build
a HMM from the multiple alignment using hmmbuild
from HMMER v2.1, iii) calculate a matching score for each
member of the family based on the HMM using
hmmsearch from HMMER v2.1, and iv) retain only one
EST contig assigned with the best matching score for an
EST cluster, each of which can be approximated as the collection of EST contigs originated from a single genomic
locus.

sequences were submitted to Meta-BASIC [52] against
data sets of meta-profiles derived from PDB [51] and
Pfam [19,20]. For the proteins identified as putative
matches by Meta-BABIC, potential globular regions were
identified with GlobPlot [81], and were subsequently submitted to the Structure Prediction Meta Server [82] for
additional analyses. Secondary structure prediction was
performed with PsiPred and ProfSec via the meta server,
collected models were screened with 3D-Jury [83], a consensus fold recognition prediction method, for final predictions. Homology models were further obtained with
Modeller version 6.2 [56] with additional refinement of
structural alignments performed according to the
Verify3D results as previously described [84].

Prediction of signal peptide and transmembrane domain
A hidden Markov modeling-based algorithm, Phobius
[76], was used with default settings. Each query sequence
was further annotated as SP for containing signal peptide,
TM for containing transmembrane region, or intracellular,
based on raw Phobius outputs.
KEGG and InterPro mappings
The E-value cut-off of 1.0e-10 reported by WU-BLASTP
against the Genes Database Release 43.0 from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was used for
pathway mappings. For each query, the top match and all
the matches within a range of 30% of the top BLAST score,
if meeting the cut-off, were accepted for valid KEGG associations [35-37]. Default parameters for InterProScan
v16.1 [77] were used to search against the InterPro database [48].
