Abstract
Background: Molecular typing methods are commonly used to study genetic relationships among
bacterial isolates. Many of these methods have become standardized and produce portable data. A
popular approach for analyzing such data is to construct graphs, including phylogenies. Inferences
from graph representations of data assist in understanding the patterns of transmission of bacterial
pathogens, and basing these graph constructs on biological models of evolution of the molecular
marker helps make these inferences. Spoligotyping is a widely used method for genotyping isolates
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that exploits polymorphism in the direct repeat region. Our goal was
to examine a range of models describing the evolution of spoligotypes in order to develop a
visualization method to represent likely relationships among M. tuberculosis isolates.
Results: We found that inferred mutations of spoligotypes frequently involve the loss of a single
or very few adjacent spacers. Using a second-order variant of Akaike's Information Criterion, we
selected the Zipf model as the basis for resolving ambiguities in the ancestry of spoligotypes. We
developed a method to construct graphs of spoligotypes (which we call spoligoforests). To
demonstrate this method, we applied it to a tuberculosis data set from Cuba and compared the
method to some existing methods.
Conclusion: We propose a new approach in analyzing relationships of M. tuberculosis isolates using
spoligotypes. The spoligoforest recovers a plausible history of transmission and mutation events
based on the selected deletion model. The method may be suitable to study markers based on loci
of similar structure from other bacteria. The groupings and relationships in the spoligoforest can
be analyzed along with the clinical features of strains to provide an understanding of the evolution
of spoligotypes.

Background
The visualization of relationships among genotypes of
bacterial isolates is a useful approach to addressing both
evolutionary and epidemiological questions. Inferences
from graph representations of data assist in understanding

the patterns of transmission of bacterial pathogens. Presently, there are two approaches to visualization. The first
class of methods is sequence-based, and these methods
often produce phylogenetic trees, or dendrograms. These
trees are used extensively to represent relatedness of isoPage 1 of 16

lates that have been identified by almost any typing procedure. However, the models of sequence evolution upon
which phylogenetic methods depend are not appropriate
for many markers that are not sequence-based. Also,
because many of these markers evolve rapidly enough to
generate intra-specific variation, it is preferable to show
direct relationships between genotypes. Bacterial isolates
often cluster into the same genotype, and dendrograms
are not suited to showing these clusters.
The second class of methods produce "network-like"
graphs that show direct relationships between clusters of
genotypes. Some examples of this second class of methods are found in the works of Zhu et al. [1], Tanaka and
Francis [2] and Excoffier and Smouse [3]. The genoclouds
in Zhu et al. [1] consist of related isolates of Neisseria meningitidis that are grouped according to criteria that minimize genetic, temporal and physical distances. The result
is a parsimonious tree that depicts the relationships
between the genoclouds. Similarly, Tanaka and Francis [2]
proposed cluster-graphs where isolates of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis sharing the same genotype are assigned into
clusters, and all possible close relationships between these
clusters are shown. In both these methods, clusters are
associated with epidemiologically linked cases of infection. Guernier et al. [4] developed a technique of representation that is based on the cluster-graph, with two
additional elements included: (1) concentric circles to
show the number of possible mutation steps between spoligotypes, and (2) hypothetical intermediate nodes to visualize possible links between clades of spoligotypes
known to be related. Excoffier and Smouse [3] used an
analysis of molecular variance to construct minimum
spanning trees and networks to represent genetic relatedness. See Posada et al. [5] for a more general discussion of
graphical methods to represent relationships.
The eBurst package [6,7] is designed for visualizing data
from multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Isolates that
have similar sequence types are assigned to disjoint
groups, where similarity depends on the number of
shared alleles in the MLST profile. The radial layout of
eBurst diagrams shows groups or subgroups of related
genotypes, centered around the inferred founding genotypes. The complexity of an eBurst diagram suggests the
age of the clonal complex; a clonal complex is considered
young when its structure is simple and older when its
structure is complex. There are many genotyping technologies enabling the study of genetic variation in bacteria.
Here, we focus on spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping), a technique that exploits polymorphism in the
direct repeat (DR) region of M. tuberculosis [8,9]. This
method has gained widespread use for differentiating isolates of M. tuberculosis over the last decade [10]. The DR
region is composed of numerous identical 36-base-pair
direct repeats, interspersed by nonrepetitive short

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/496

sequences or direct variable repeats (DVRs) called spacers.
Mechanisms known to cause variation in this locus are
homologous recombination between adjacent or spatially
distant DRs leading to deletion, and transposition and
recombination of IS6110 elements in the DR locus [9,11].
The DR locus has been identified as a hotspot for the integration of insertion elements in the chromosome of M.
tuberculosis complex strains [12]. Such insertion into a
spacer sequence can lead to the apparent deletion of that
spacer [13]. It is presumed that spacers cannot be recovered when lost, since there is little or no recombination
observed between strains [14].
It is possible that there is a relationship between the presence of some number of spacers in specific positions and
the transmission rate of a strain, as seen by the lack of a
length of spacers in the W-Beijing strain, which is prevalent in many data sets. However, in our model, we assume
that a deletion event has no relation with the transmission
rate, and any such relationship is beyond the scope of our
study. We refer the reader to papers that discuss the
importance of studying the W-Beijing type and its transmission [15,16].
In this paper we examine the problem of determining a
plausible evolutionary history of a sample of tuberculosis
spoligotypes using an explicit model of the evolution of
the DR locus. We start with the cluster-graph construct of
Tanaka and Francis [2] to represent all possible mutation
events in a sample of spoligotypes. Nodes of a clustergraph represent distinct spoligotypes in a sample, and
edges drawn between nodes determine the possible mutation events. By mutation we mean a deletion of one or
more spacers in a spoligotype. Even for moderately large
samples, this can lead to a tangled network of relationships between spoligotypes, which can hinder further
analysis. In particular, many spoligotypes appear to have
originated from multiple parent spoligotypes. One solution to this problem is to randomly sample edges from a
set of multiple inbound edges [17]. However, some edges
(mutation events) may be more likely than others to
explain the origin of a given spoligotype. We formulate a
variety of models to describe the deletion processes that
generate variation in the DR locus, and identify an appropriate model using Akaike's Information Criterion. The
selected model can then be used to choose a single
inbound edge into a specific spoligotype. Applying this
procedure to each spoligotype with multiple inbound
edges in a sample, we can refine the cluster-graph. We call
the resulting graph a spoligoforest.

Methods
We present several candidate deletion models of spoligotype evolution, then compare them using a second-order
form of the Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc) and

data from selected published spoligotype samples (see
Table 1). In this section we begin with the underlying
assumptions about spoligotypes and their evolution. We
then outline the procedure for model selection and finally
describe the models.
Assumptions on the evolution of spoligotypes
A spoligotype consists of 43 binary characters. Each binary
character denotes the presence or absence of a spacer in
the DR locus of M. tuberculosis. The copy number of a spoligotype refers to the number of spacers present in its
binary pattern. It is assumed that a mutation event
involves the deletion of any number of adjacent spacers
from the spoligotype; deleted spacers are not recovered, so
that the spoligotype resulting from a mutation always
contains fewer spacers than the parent. For our purposes
we regard the different mechanisms that influence variation in the DR locus to be indistinguishable. Furthermore,
deletion is the only source of variation. In our model we
assume that a deletion event has no relation with the
transmission rate. We assume that the mutation rate is
low enough relative to the transmission rate that infected
individuals carry only a single strain of M. tuberculosis with
a specific spoligotype. When this infecting strain mutates,
it is replaced by a strain with a different spoligotype that
has not been observed elsewhere in the sample. Consequently, in any sample, a given spoligotype can have at
most one possible parent spoligotype, but potentially
many descendants.
Data sets and cluster-graphs
Given that spoligotypes mutate by deletions of adjacent
blocks of spacers, we would like to know whether some
lengths of deleted adjacent blocks are more probable than
others. Specifically, we would like to find the frequency of
each deletion size. There are many published tuberculosis
data sets using spoligotyping as a marker containing the

information required for our purposes. We selected fifteen
published data sets that provide the spoligotyping pattern
of each M. tuberculosis isolate in the sample and the
number of isolates that cluster into each pattern (see Table
1). We consider that individuals within a sample are sufficiently close to each other for transmission to occur.
These data sets come from various parts of the world, and
vary in statistical features such as RTIn-1 (in the range
(0.3279,0.8055)), number of singletons (7,105), average
cluster size (1.8,6.7) and θ-estimate (2.73,66.25). Some
of these quantities are discussed in [2] and [10].
We use cluster-graphs as described in Tanaka and Francis
[2]. We group isolates that have the same spoligotype into
clusters; each cluster is drawn as a node, and a possible
single-event deletion that relates two clusters (spoligotypes) is represented by a directed edge. Possible deletion
events are established by pairwise comparisons of spoligotype patterns. We define a spoligoforest to be a clustergraph in which a single parent is chosen for each cluster
having one or more parents. Some clusters in a clustergraph already have a unique parent, and are likely to represent true deletions. This set of unambiguous deletion
events forms the sample of deletion lengths for the model
selection. Table 2 (column 4) shows the number of such
edges from each data set. We assume that mutations occur
independently of the state of the population, and hence
edges, which represent mutations, are independent. The
edges from the different data sets, representing independent deletion events, are pooled together in order to analyze the frequency of deletion lengths. We obtain an
empirical distribution of deletion lengths represented by
the unambiguous edges from the fifteen data sets. The
total pool of analyzed unambiguous edges consisted of
339 deletion events.
Candidate models for spacer deletion length in pattern
mutations
Our goal is to find a model that best describes the underlying process generating the distribution of lengths of
spacer deletions in the inferred mutation events. We formulated several candidate models based on standard discrete distributions and various hypotheses on spacer
deletion lengths. For each model we found the maximum
likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the parameters, analytically when possible, and numerically otherwise. Let the
observed number of deletions of length i be xi, where i can

take values from 1 to 43, let m be the total number of
mutations analyzed (the unambiguous edges, in this case
339), and let x be the mean deletion length. Let the random variable K describe the deletion length associated
with a mutation event. In each of the candidate models,
let P(K = k) (or P(k)) be the probability mass function. The

the data sets, k is the deletion length, and xk is the frequency of the class of deletions with length k.
For each of the models, we computed the value of the second-order variant of Akaike's Information Criterion
(AICc) [18] to select a parsimonious model. The AICc is
given by the formula

AIC c = −2 ln (p | x) +

at the maximum likelihood, x is the frequency of deletion
lengths collected from the data sets, m is the sample size
(the number of edges) and s is the number of parameters
in the model. Models with low relative AICc values are
favoured. A summary of the probability mass functions
and (MLEs) can be found in Table 3.
Geometric model
Consider a deletion mechanism that moves along the DR
region, making independent attempts to remove a spacer.
Let k be the number of spacers this mechanism is able to
remove, and the constant probability of the removal of a
spacer is p. The probability mass function is P(k) = pk-1(1 ˆ
p), where k ≥ 1 and 0 <p < 1. The MLE for p is p = 1 -1/ x .
Negative binomial model
To generalize the geometric model, we define the negative
binomial parameters p and r. Consider a deletion mechanism that involves r rounds of spacer deletion, so that in
total k spacers are removed. Each of these r rounds
removes a geometrically distributed number of spacers
with parameter p. The probability mass function is

Uniform model
We consider a deletion process that cuts spacers in lengths
distributed uniformly across deletion lengths k up to
some endpoint a. The probability mass function is P(k) =

a ≤ 43. We denote this model as Uniform (V), where the
endpoint a is a parameter, and is allowed to vary. The MLE

a was found numerically. We also included a variation of
the uniform model where P(k) = p for all values of 1 ≤ k ≤

where the endpoint a is fixed at a = 43.
Empirical model
We include in the analysis a model that completely represents the empirical values of deletion frequencies in the
fifteen data sets used as reference (see Table 1). The probxk
ability mass function is P(k) = m where xk is the fre-

quency of k-deletions and m is the total number of
deletions, with 1 ≤ k ≤ 43. Setting the parameters to be pk

Visualizing relationships among spoligotypes
The selected model can now be used in a method to visualize relationships among M. tuberculosis isolates. For a
specific data set consisting of M. tuberculosis isolates typed
using spoligotyping, we represent each spoligotype by a
node with area proportional to the number of isolates
with that spoligotype pattern. Inferred possible mutation
events are represented by directed edges between nodes,
with the arrowheads pointing to descendant spoligotypes.
This specifies the cluster-graph [2].

Multiple inbound edges into a node are reduced to a single inbound edge. We use a heuristic that chooses a single
inbound edge that has maximum weight. We define the
weight w of an edge eAB in a cluster-graph from spoligotype A to its descendant B to be:

This model has 42 free parameters.

Results
We begin with some general observations about the relative frequencies of different deletion lengths. We discuss
the outcomes of the model selection procedure, and then
apply the chosen model to a new visualization method for
representing relationships of isolates of tuberculosis.
Inferred pattern mutations of spoligotypes frequently
involve short spacer deletions
The selected data sets independently show a high frequency of deletions of a single spacer. The pooled set of
edges are shown in the gray bars of Figure 1. The 339 single-event deletions are distributed as shown in Table 4.
Deletion lengths not appearing in Table 4 are not
observed. The average number of spacers deleted is x =
2.46 and the standard deviation is 3.376. The skewed distribution of deletion sizes indicate a high number of short
deletions, and very few longer deletions. Note, it is conceivable that spoligotypes that exist in the population but
not sampled are intermediate in state between two sampled spoligotypes. If such spoligotypes exist and are sampled then the distribution would shift further towards
shorter deletion lengths.
Model selection
We selected the model with the lowest value of AICc (see
Equation 1). This model is the Zipf model (Equation (6)).
AICc values and parameter estimates for some of the models are shown in Table 5. Figure 1 shows a plot of the relative frequencies for deletion lengths estimated by each of
the models as well as the actual empirical values (gray
bars). We verified that the selected model fits the individual data sets well by repeating the analysis separately for
the individual data sets. The Zipf model often has the lowest AICc, while the logarithmic series and geometric models are selected in some individual data sets (see Table 6).

where P(·) is the model of deletion, d(·) is the deletion
length represented by the edge, ni is the cluster size of spoligotype i, and S is the set of nodes that are possible parent
nodes of spoligotype B. Ties in the maximum weight are
broken arbitrarily. The resulting graph is what we refer to
as a spoligoforest. Code for automatically constructing
cluster-graphs and spoligoforests from a sample of tuberculosis spoligotypes was implemented using the visualization software GraphViz [19]. The method has been
implemented on a web server and is publicly available at
http://emi.unsw.edu.au/spolTools (see [20] for details).
Application of the method to tuberculosis spoligotypes
We applied our new method for constructing forests to
several data sets. To illustrate the method, we first use
published data from a study on the transmission of tuberculosis in Cuba [21]. Isolates collected over a year were
typed using both spoligotyping and IS6110 typing. Onehundred and fifty-seven isolates were classified into 47
spoligotype patterns. The clusters of isolates sharing the
same spoligotype are nodes in the diagram, labelled using
shared type (ST) numbers in SpolDB4 [22] wherever possible. When the spoligotype is not found in SpolDB4, we
labelled it as 'Or' with a number (e.g. Or1). Orphan spoligotypes are unique alleles without an ST number [23].
Following the description in Tanaka and Francis [2], we
constructed the cluster-graph for these data in a hierarchical layout as shown in Figure 2, with edges labelled with
the weights computed using our selected model. The size
of each node reflects the number of isolates in that node.
The resulting graph is a complex network showing all possible relationships of spoligotypes under our assumptions
about the spoligotype mutation processes. The Zipf model
is used to calculate the weights of the edges, as given in

Equation (7), of the cluster-graph. In this cluster-graph,
there are 19 nodes with multiple inbound edges. The
nodes are labelled according to the shared type (ST) identifiers used in SpolDB4 [22]. For example, ST 718 has 18
possible parents, while STs 47, 1, 62, 791, 2, 132 and 209,
each has 3 possible parents. Of the 83 edges in the clustergraph, 37 were chosen for the spoligoforest (see Figure 3).
As with the cluster-graph, the nodes in the spoligoforest
represent the number of isolates that share the same spoligotype pattern. If the weight of the edge is equal to 1, we
draw a solid edge, if the weight is greater than or equal to
0.5 but less than 1, a dashed line, and if less than 0.5, a
dotted line.

The spoligoforest consists of two trees (connected components) and eight disconnected nodes. The large tree has ST
53 at the root, suggesting that ST 53 is the oldest spoligotype in this tree. Seven spoligotypes are descended from
ST 53, two of which have comparably large cluster sizes:
ST 50 with 16 isolates and ST 42 with 14 isolates. These
two spoligotypes form two distinct lineages diverging
from ST 53. A comparison with the families in SpolDB4

Haarlem family. The separate smaller tree on the right
includes ST 1 with 20 isolates. This is the spoligotype of
the W-Beijing strain, known to be widely distributed
around the world.
Comparative analyses
In this section, we compare the spoligoforest to two other
methods of visualisation, namely phylogenies and cladograms. We illustrate that using models with AICc values
close to that of the Zipf model has minimal effect on the
edges of a spoligoforest.

The branches in a phylogeny show indirect relationships
between isolates via implicit common ancestors, whereas
the edges in the spoligoforest describe direct relationships
among clusters of spoligotypes.
However, related spoligotypes in the spoligoforest are
consistent with inferences on clustered isolates from a
phylogeny. Figure 4 shows a phylogenetic tree based on
IS6110-typing and Figure 5 is a spoligoforest using data
from a prison in Azerbaijan [24]. The tree depicts genetic
relatedness of isolates with each other based on similarities of IS6110 banding. The leaves of this tree have been
renamed using STs (shared types from SpolDB4) of the
spoligotypes, so that isolates sharing the same spoligotype
may appear in different leaves of the tree. An inspection of
the branch lengths in the phylogenetic tree indicate that
ST 42 is most related to ST 254 (2 isolates of differing

with this observation: ST 42 is chosen as a parent for ST
254, with weight 0.7064 in the cluster-graph (not shown).
Furthermore, the spoligoforest shows that ST 42 is likely
to have evolved from ST 53, which cannot be inferred
from Figure 4. Direct links between spoligotypes are also
seen in the spoligoforest, for instance the edge from ST 35
to ST 1050. In the phylogenetic tree, this relationship can
be seen in the leftmost group with STs 35, 62 and 1050.
Also, ST 1051 shown to be distant from the other types. It
may be worth investigating whether ST 1051 is more
related to the ST 53 group, as shown in the spoligoforest.
A similar network-like technique of visualization to the
spoligoforest is the cladogram in Figure 6 of [25]. The
method of construction of the cladogram involves using
information from nested clades and geographic location.
The main difference between the cladogram and the spoligoforest is that the cladogram involves the introduction
of intermediate steps between types, accounting for possibly unsampled spoligotypes. The spoligoforest for this
data set is shown in Figure 6. The LAM3 and LAM9 groups
identified in the cladogram are also evident as a subtree in
the spoligoforest, with ST 42 at the top of this subtree (see
highlighted region in Figure 6). The relationship of ST G4
with other spoligotypes is different in the two figures. In
the spoligoforest, ST G4 is linked with a dotted line (computed weight of 0.2387 in cluster-graph, not shown) to ST
42. In the cladogram, however, ST G4 is related to ST 45
through a conjectured intermediate type. It may be inter-

In order to assess the choice of model among the best
four, we applied the method to several data sets using a
range of possible models. This procedure has revealed that
model selection has minimal impact on the edges of spoligoforests. We constructed the spoligoforests for six data
sets, using the zeta, logarithmic series, geometric and
empirical models. Table 7 shows the number of differing
edges in spoligoforests constructed from these alternative
models, relative to that constructed using the selected
model (Zipf). Clearly, the Zipf and zeta models are similar, as the only difference between them is that the
domain of the Zipf distribution is finite (see Table 3). The
spoligoforest for the data set from Madagascar [26] using
the selected Zipf model is shown in Figure 7. The spoligoforest using a logarithmic series model (Figure 8) for the
same data set differs from Figure 7 by 4 edges, the highest
number of edge differences among the data sets and models we tested.

called an orphan strain, hence labelled here 'Or' with a number. Sizes of nodes reflect the number of isolates sharing the spoligotype pattern associated with that node. Edges are labelled with corresponding weights that are computed as explained in the
text. For example, ST 1 is inferred to have arisen either from ST 1484 (with weight 0.1666), ST 702 (with weight 0.2752) or
Or1 (with weight 0.2809). The lengths of edges do not represent evolutionary distance.

model of evolution of spoligotypes. The selected model is
the Zipf model with parameter p for deletion length. We
have made the spoligoforest application available in the
spolTools website http://www.emi.unsw.edu.au/spol
Tools.
In this website, users can search through the repository of
spoligotype data sets in spolTools as well as manipulate
their own data sets. These data sets can be processed to
construct spoligoforests.
A spoligoforest recovers a plausible history of transmission and mutation events. The area of each node is proportional to the number of isolates (cluster size); edges
between nodes reflect evolutionary relationships between
spoligotypes with arrowheads pointing to descendants. A
single edge is chosen from multiple inbound edges using
the deletion model, resulting in a forest – that is, a collection of acyclic graphs, or trees.

Information about the age of a spoligotype is contained in
three aspects of a spoligoforest. First, if its node is large,
the strain with that spoligotype may have been transmitted extensively over a long time. Second, a large number
of descendants (outbound edges) suggests the strain has
had a long period over which to generate mutations.
Third, the location of a node also offers clues as to age: the
closer it is to a root node, the older it is. For example, ST
1 in Figure 3 is a root and potentially the oldest spoligotype in this forest.
If a spoligotype node size is large yet located at a tip of the
spoligoforest, this mixed signal may indicate that the
strain with the spoligotype is transmitting faster than the
other strains in the data set [17]. For example, ST 42 in Figure 3 has cluster size 14 and 6 outbound edges, whereas
ST 81 with 10 isolates only has 1 outbound edge. ST 81
could therefore be an "emerging strain". Application of
the analysis of Tanaka and Francis [17] did not, however,
identify any rapidly spreading strains in this data set. In

this case, therefore, there is no evidence for the presence
of emerging strains. Note that the algorithm for choosing
edges proposed in this study could be used to refine the
method of Tanaka and Francis [17].

One way to improve the analysis of strain age and emergence would be to consider spoligotypes in conjunction
with other molecular markers. For example, consider the
same two spoligotypes discussed above (ST 42 and ST 81

higher transmission rate than ST 42. Further quantitative

We note the limitations of our method. First, in choosing
a single edge from multiple edges, we assumed that
homoplasy (i.e., a spoligotype arising from more than
one parent) does not occur. Because the number of spacers is finite and the deletion process is discrete, homoplasy

may occasionally occur, but it is likely to be infrequent.
The occurrence of homoplasy may have only a minor
effect on graph-construction, producing a small number
of cycles if such events could be properly identified. Second, we always choose one edge (parent) among possible
inbound edges into a given spoligotype. It is conceivable,
however, that the given spoligotype did not descend from
any of the candidate parents. An improvement to the
method would incorporate a procedure for not choosing
any edges when appropriate. Third, as in any statistical
analysis involving samples of data, there could be a bias
in sampling. An overrepresentation of a spoligotype in a
sampled data set can lead to biased selection of a parent
node. Fourth, our methodology cannot be applied to
markers such as Variable Numbers of Tandem Repeats
(VNTR), which is commonly used to type various bacteria.
The mutation process for VNTRs is better modeled using a
stepwise mutation model rather than a deletion model.
Our method may, however, be suitable for markers based
on loci of similar structure in some other bacteria. The
direct repeat region of M. tuberculosis is among a family of
repetitive genome sequences that are called Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs)
found in many different species of bacteria and archaea
[27-29]. Recently, CRISPR systems have received
increased attention due to evidence that links these loci
with the acquisition of resistance in bacteria to infection
by phages [30]. Examples of these structures have been
studied in M. tuberculosis [12,13], Haloferax mediterranei
[31], Methanocaldococcus jannaschii [27,32], and Yersinia
pestis [33].
The mechanisms that are believed to be involved in the
evolution of CRISPR systems involve a frequent deletion
of spacer-repeat motifs (thought to be necessary to prevent over-inflation of the CRISPR locus [29]) as well as the
insertion of new spacers next to the leader sequence due
to uptake of phage DNA [33].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/496

As with other visualization methods, the groupings and
relationships that are seen in the spoligoforest can be analysed along with the known clinical features of strains.
Such analyses are valuable when an understanding of the
history of transmission and mutation of strains is
required.

Conclusion
There is a lack of tools for visualizing relationships among
tuberculosis isolates that employ a model describing evolution of a specific marker. Current understanding of the
evolution of spoligotypes led us to a method for visualizing relationships of isolates within a sample. The methodology presented in this paper may be applied to loci that
have the same structure as the DR region of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, and whose evolution involves the deletion of
spacer-repeat motifs. The groupings and relationships that
are seen in the spoligoforest can be analysed along with
the clinical features of strains to understand the evolution
of strains.

Typing methods similar to spoligotyping for other bacterial isolates with CRISPRs are being developed. One such
typing method (also called spoligotyping) has been
applied to Corynebacterium diphtheriae strains, in which
the location and structure of two CRISPR loci have been
identified [34]. These loci consist of 27 spacers (the DRA
with 21 spacers and the DRB with 6 spacers) in two different regions of the genome. The spoligotyping method
used in this particular study is similar to the method used
for M. tuberculosis. At present, there is yet to be an analysis
of the evolution of these DR loci in C. diphtheriae. It has
also been speculated that in some CRISPRs, new repeat
motifs can appear, like those in Yersinia pestis [33]. Investigations into how these loci evolve may allow the development of methods similar to that described here.
