of Orchid Island and the Philippine Islanders of
the Batanes archipelago

Abstract
Background: Yami and Ivatan islanders are Austronesian speakers from Orchid Island and the Batanes archipelago
that are located between Taiwan and the Philippines. The paternal genealogies of the Yami tribe from 1962
monograph of Wei and Liu were compared with our dataset of non-recombining Y (NRY) chromosomes from the
corresponding families. Then mitochondrial DNA polymorphism was also analyzed to determine the matrilineal
relationships between Yami, Ivatan, and other East Asian populations.
Results: The family relationships inferred from the NRY Phylogeny suggested a low number of paternal founders
and agreed with the genealogy of Wei and Liu (P < 0.01). Except for one Y short tandem repeat lineage (Y-STR),
seen in two unrelated Yami families, no other Y-STR lineages were shared between villages, whereas mtDNA
haplotypes were indiscriminately distributed throughout Orchid Island.
The genetic affinity seen between Yami and Taiwanese aborigines or between Ivatan and the Philippine people
was closer than that between Yami and Ivatan, suggesting that the Orchid islanders were colonized separately by
their nearest neighbors and bred in isolation. However a northward gene flow to Orchid Island from the
Philippines was suspected as Yami and Ivatan peoples both speak Western Malayo-Polynesian languages which are
not spoken in Taiwan. Actually, only very little gene flow was observed between Yami and Ivatan or between Yami
and the Philippines as indicated by the sharing of mtDNA haplogroup B4a1a4 and one O1a1* Y-STR lineage.
Conclusions: The NRY and mtDNA genetic information among Yami tribe peoples fitted well the patrilocal society
model proposed by Wei and Liu. In this proposal, there were likely few genetic exchanges among Yami and the
Philippine people. Trading activities may have contributed to the diffusion of Malayo-Polynesian languages among
them.
Finally, artifacts dating 4,000 YBP, found on Orchid Island and indicating association with the Out of Taiwan
hypothesis might be related to a pioneering stage of settlement, as most dating estimates inferred from DNA
variation in our data set ranged between 100-3,000 YBP.

Background
Orchid Island, is located 49 nautical miles from the
southeast coast of Taiwan along the Bashi (or Luzon)
channel in the Pacific Ocean, and is home to the Yami
tribe (also known as Tao). The Ivatan tribe people are
inhabitants of Itbayat in the Batanes archipelago which
is south of Orchid Island (Figure 1). The languages of
Yami and Ivatan belongs to the Batanic sub-branch of

western Malayo-Polynesian languages (Figure 1), which
also belongs to the 10 th branch of the Austronesian
(AN) languages group [1,2]. The Yami are the only nonFormosan Austronesian speakers among Taiwan Aborigines (TwA) [3]. They also have a close cultural
relationship with the Ivatan. According to an oral folk
tale, the Yamis believe that their ancestors came from
the Batanes archipelago [4].
The archaeological findings in Orchid Island have
shown evidence of Fine Corded Ware Culture, which is
related to the Peinan culture [5]. These middle Neolithic
artifacts were found on the east coast of Taiwan

between Hualien and Taitung (Figure 1). These findings
indicate contact and possibly migration from Taiwan to
Orchid Island ~4,000 years before present (YBP).
Furthermore, the post-Neolithic oral history (~1,500
YBP), reports that the interactions between Orchid
island and the Batanes archipelago islanders were frequent until ~300 YBP [6], but the interactions between
TwA and Orchid Islanders have ceased much earlier.
The archaeological excavation from Batanes in 2002
[7] showed that the Batanes archipelago had been inhabited 4000 YBP. Similar to Orchid Island findings [8], the
sites in Batanes indicated connections with middle to
late Neolithic cultures originated in the eastern coast of
Taiwan. More recently, two very specific forms of ear
pendants that were made of green nephrite from eastern
Taiwan were discovered in Orchid Island and Batanes
along with other artifacts dating back to 2,500 to 1500
YBP [8]. Similar artifacts of same period have been
reported in Orchid Island, Batanes, the Philippines, East
Malaysia, southern Vietnam, and Thailand [8]. All these
findings clearly suggest prehistoric trading activities

around the China seas. Carbon dating from food debris
suggests that the colonization of Batanes might have
happened much later (~2,500 YBP), however the dating
obtained from pottery residues or inferred from Northern Luzon findings suggests 4,000 YBP [9]. These date
estimates have raised questions about the relationship
between the present inhabitants of Orchid Island and
Batanes and the simple “stepping stone” (or “Out of
Taiwan”) hypothesis [10].
From the end of the 19th century to the middle of the
20th century, Japanese anthropologists have conducted
important ethnological studies on all Taiwan Aborigines
tribes, including the Yami of Orchid Island [11-20].
Inter-village cultural variations among the Yamis were
first noticed by Kano [21]. However, more recent
anthropological studies suggest that sharing of common
attributes among villages had been overestimated and
accordingly, much more variation among villages should
be expected [4]. A 1962 monograph about the social
structure of the Yami [22] described the paternal genealogies of a number of the Yami families, some of which
would be traced back to ten generations. Wei and Liu
showed that generations of same family remained in the
same village. For the first stage of our study, we used Y
chromosome polymorphism to determine the patrilineal
relationships between Yami families and then compared
the genetic analysis with the genealogical information
from Wei and Liu.
In the early 18 th century, following a destructive
typhoon and ensuing famine, 35% of the Ivatan population perished [23]. The Catholic Church arranged one
fourth of the Ivatans to move south to a more sheltered
island near Luzon in the Philippines. At the end of the
19 th century, however, many of these peoples moved
back to Batanes. As a consequence, one would expect
the genetic profile of the extant population of Batanes
to show some similarity with the northern Luzon people
in the Philippines. In 2001, a human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) study showed that the HLA-A and DRB1 allele
distributions of the Ivatan were similar to the Yami and
to the Puyuma tribe from the southeast coast of Taiwan
[24]. For the second part of this study, we use mitochondrial DNA of relevant coding regions and the control region HVS-1, together with complete mtDNA
genome sequencing of the most representative haplogroups among Yami and Ivatan, to further analyze the
matrilineal relationship between Yami, Ivatan, Taiwan
Aborigines, the Philippine people, and other populations
from Mainland and Island Southeast Asia (MSEA and
ISEA).
In summary, the study proposes to test the issue of
genetic stratification described by Wei and Liu using Y
chromosome polymorphism. Further, using mitochondrial DNA diversity among Yami and Ivatan, we propose

Loo et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/21

to examine the issue of the initial settlement of the
Orchid Islands to determine whether it happened with
the mid Neolithic Austronesian expansion, and whether
there was gene flow between the Batanes and the
Orchid Islands. We will also test the issue of genetic
affinities between the Batanes and the Philippines as
expected given the relocation of Batanes individuals during the XVIII century. Finally we propose to further
analyze the matrilineal relationship between Yami, Ivatan, Taiwan Aborigines, the Philippine people, and other
populations from mainland and island Southeast Asia
(MSEA and ISEA).

Results
Mitochondrial DNA

The complete mtDNA sequence data of HVS-1 (nps
16,037 to 16,365), nps 8,000 to 9,000, nps 9,800 to
10,900 and nps 14,000 to 15,000 of 129 Yami and Ivatan
individuals together with their detailed haplogroup classification are reported in the Additional file 1. The
Yamis as determined by ten different mtDNA haplotypes showed considerably less polymorphisms than the
Ivatans (20 haplotypes) or other Taiwan Aboriginal
tribes (13 to 22 haplotypes) [25].
Except for haplogroup E2b1 (6.3%), all the Yami haplogroups had frequencies greater than 10%. In comparison, only four out of 15 Ivatan haplogroups exceeded
10% (total of 62%). Further, 5 haplogroups (B4a1a,
B4a2a, B4c1b2, E2b1 and M7c3c) were shared between
Yami and Ivatan (Table 1).
Although all Yami mtDNA haplogroups were seen
among TwA, some were found partially in the Philippines (Table 1). Therefore, the Fst tree (additional file 2;
mtDNA) posits the Yamis to be intermediate between
the Ivatans and all the other Taiwanese groups (including the Amis).
Complete mtDNA sequences from all phylogenetically
relevant haplogroups of Yamis and Ivatans are shown in
Figure 2, which include three haplogroups locally named
in accordance with the van Oven “Phylotree” as F1a1d,
M7b4 and N9a10 [26]. Haplogroup F1a1d [27] differs
from F1a1a which was previously described by Hill et al.
at np 16108 [28,29]. Nps 16399 and 11380 (Figure 2), are
found in Tsou and Rukai in Taiwan (10.00% and 5.88%
respectively), in Vietnam (~6%) [30,31], Fujian (<1%),
and among the Yamis where drift is likely to explain the
high frequency (22%) because haplotype diversity is low
on the island (Table 1 and Additional file 1). The presence of these haplotypes in Yamis and near absence in
the Philippines, suggests that the gene flow from Southeast Asia ended in Taiwan [30-32] and could have
reached Orchid island as a result of the jade trade [8].
All B4a1a haplotypes in Yamis (15%) belonged to a subclade defined by nps 4025 and 16360A (Figure 2) [25].

Page 3 of 15

The clade, here named B4a1a4, was not seen in Taiwan.
One twig of B4a1a4 did not show np 16360A and was
seen in two Ivatan individuals (4%). Further screening for
the presence of np 4025 in 132 B4a1a samples was undertaken to determine the presence of B4a1a4 in other
regions of Taiwan, Southeast Asia and ISEA, and if possible, to infer its origin. Five B4a1a4 lineages lacking
16360A transversion were seen among the Filipinos (1%)
and three of them were different at HVS-1. The higher
B4a1a4 diversity south of Orchid Island favored a Philippine origin. As indicated by the low mtDNA diversity
among Yami, genetic drift must have been active on the
island and most likely accounts for the high frequency of
the unique B4a1a4 lineage (24%) (Table 1).
The complete mtDNA sequences and HVS-1
sequences in ISEA and Taiwan ([27] and our unpublished data) were used to estimate and compare the ages
of the haplogroups found in Yami and Ivatan (Table 2).
While such dates may have considerable uncertainty
[33], two patterns were seen:
1) Firstly, haplogroups shared between Yami and Ivatan (B4a1a (including B4a1a4), B4a2a and B4c1b2)
showed age between ~800 to 1,600 YBP (95% CI; 0 to
4,600 years) as estimated by HVS-1 polymorphism.
Compared to the archaeological estimates of settlement
[5,7], our observation suggested that a permanent settlement must have post-dated the first traces of human
activities observed on Orchid or Batanes islands (A caution is noted because there is an estimate overlap
between the 95% confidence interval (CI) and the archeological estimate).
2) Except for the Yami haplogroups M7c3c and E2b1
which had only one representative in Ivatan, no other
non-B4 haplogroups were shared between Yami and Ivatan. The two groups of islanders were clearly differentiated by two patterns, haplogroups F1a1d and M7b3 in
Yami and haplogroups E1a1a, E2a, E2b2, F1a3, F1a4,
M7b4, and N9a10 in Ivatan. While F1a1d and M7b4
have been reported in MSEA [34] (Figure 2, Table 1), all
other haplogroups have only been seen in ISEA or
among TwA. This suggested that the only maternal
influence (via Taiwan) from MSEA was limited to F1a1d
and M7b4, and that most Yami or Ivatan could trace
their ancestry to either ISEA (i.e. B4a1a4, E2a, E2b2,
F1a3 and F1a4) or to Taiwan (i.e. B4a2a, E2b1 and
M7b3a). Further, the largest molecular variation among
these haplogroups within the Yami, gave a 95% confidence interval on an age estimate that is within 3,000
YBP (Table 2). This again supports a more recent stage
of permanent settlement on Orchid Island compared to
the archaeological estimate of 4,000 YBP.
In summary, while Yami (with all haplogroups except
B4a1a4 and B4c1b2) showed a stronger relationship
with Taiwan, the Ivatan showed a closer affinity to the

Philippines or Taiwan than to Yami. If not considering
genetic drift, this pattern indicates bypassing of the
Batanes Islands in the early stage of “Out of Taiwan”,
and later colonization of the Batanes from Luzon. The
evidence of bidirectional maternal gene flow between
the two islands was inferred from a time of settlement
not exceeding 3,000 YBP.
Y chromosome

The frequencies of Y-chromosome single nucleotide
polymorphisms (Y-SNP) haplogroups are shown in table
3. As previously reported for Taiwan and ISEA [35-37],
O1-M119 and O2-P31 were the most common haplogroups among Yami, but O2-P31 was not seen in Ivatan and not so common in the Philippines. Interestingly,
macro haplogroups K and NO*, indicators of Paleolithic
traces for ISEA (9% to 46%) and the Philippines (0% to
6%), were not seen in the Orchid or Batanes Islanders
[38]. Also, except for the presence of one O3a4*GPS002611 lineage in Yami and one O1a1*-P203x
lineages in Ivatan (Table 3), Y-SNP sharing between

Yami and Ivatan was restricted to haplogroup O1a*M119x.
The median joining (MJ) networks were constructed
using Yami and Ivatan polymorphisms obtained from 16
Y-STR loci in each Y-SNP haplogroup (O1a*-M119,
O1a1*-P203, O1a2-M110, O2a*-M95, O2a1a-PK4,
O3a3*-P201 and O3a4*-GSP002611) (Additional file 3).
Only five distinct O1a*-M119 Yami Y-STR haplotypes
were found (Additional file 1). These haplotypes were
not shared between the two islands, suggesting drift,
sampling bias or an absence of recent paternal gene flow
between Yami and Ivatan. No clusters of Yami or Ivatan
Y-STR lineages were found with TwA, and Indonesia
(Additional file 3). Nonetheless the haplogroup O1a1*P203 network showed some relationships among Philippine Y-STR lineages and five Yami individuals from
Iraralai (including three from family 48, one individual
from families 44 and one from family 45) suggesting the
peoples of Orchid island and the Philippines are related.
On the other hand, age estimates according to molecular variation [39] in Y-STR clusters suggested possible

correlation among extended families should extend to
the correlation among most parsimonious tree and the
lay outs (Figure 3). Deviations from this relationship
would create crossings among the correlations lines.
Quantitative visualization of the Wei and Liu relationship was constructed with the GenGIS software [46].
Fitting of the ordered lay outs to the corresponding phylogeny was tested using a Monte Carlo permutation test
of the leaf nodes. The P values indicated that the fraction of crossings were lesser than what was set in the
figure out of 1000 permutations [46] (Additional file 4).
All P values (Figure 3A, B and 3C) were < 0.01 suggesting that the model used to represent the Wei and Liu
hypothesis produced a significant number of correlation
lines.

local founding events not exceeding 3,230 YBP (± 1,400
years) for Yamis (Additional file 4) and 3,300 YBP
(± 1,430 years) for Ivatans (data not shown).
A population phylogenetic tree was constructed using
Y-STR Fst distances between all the groups in our dataset and the other populations in SEA [40-44]. Yamis,
Ivatans, Amis and Filipinos shared a close paternal relationship; this result agreed with the phylogenetic pattern
from mtDNA studies (Additional file 2). Nonetheless,
these ethnic groups also showed Y-STR affinity to the
Southern Taiwan Aboriginal tribes (Paiwan, Rukai and
Puyuma) probably indicating a greater inter-island
movement of men than women. We also noticed that
the few shared haplotypes between Yami and MSEA
belong to the haplogroups O1a*-M119, O2a*-M95 and
O2a1a-PK4 (Malaysia, Thailand, Southwest China, and
Malagasy). Similarly, some haplotypes shared by Ivatan
and Malaysia belong to haplogroups O1a2-M110 and
O3a3*-P201.

Discussion
Genetic relationship between Yamis and Ivatans

Substantial trading among the regions of MSEA, Taiwan
and ISEA dated back to ~4,000 YBP was described in
the literature indicating that all the islanders, including
Yami, Ivatan and coastal dwellers from the China Sea,
used advanced navigation techniques to sail forth and
back among islands. Such findings were inferred by:
1. Artifacts found in Orchid Islands and Batanes that
were dated back to the “Fine Corded Ware Culture” of
Taiwan around ~4,000 YBP [5,7];
2. Jade trading among the Philippines, East Malaysia,
southern Vietnam, Orchid Island, Batanes, and Thailand,
that occurred between 2600 to 1500 YBP [8];
3. The presence of Y haplogroups O1a2 and O2a in
Madagascar suggesting an establishment associated with
the Austronesian expansion or people coming from
Southeast Asians during 1,500 to 2,000 YBP [43,47];
4. Yami and Ivatan linguistically connected to the
Western Malayo-Polynesian branch of Austronesian in
ISEA [2].
In this study the matrilineal and patrilineal relationship
between Yami, Ivatan, Taiwan Aborigines, the Philippine
people, and other populations from the mainland and
island Southeast Asia, were analyzed. Our goals were
first test if there was a northward gene flow from the
Philippines to Taiwan, and second to compare the Y
chromosome data for the Yamis with paternal genealogy
report by Wei and Liu (1962).

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)

Using the information shown in Additional file 1, the
paternal and maternal lineages among Yamis were
regrouped according to village of paternal and maternal
origins. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [45]
between maternal lineages and their village of origin
(Table 4) did not show much differences among villages
(Fst= 0.0055; P > 0.05) indicating that mtDNA lineages
were distributed randomly throughout Orchid Island
among women. On the contrary, the Y-STR paternal
variation among villages varied significantly (F st =
0.17835; P < 0.0001) which suggest a sedentary life of
the Yami men.
Phylogenetic and Genealogy

In Figure 3 (and Additional file 4), the ancestral and
extended families in each village [22] were compared
with the Yami NRY most parsimonious tree constructed
from our Y-SNP and Y-STR results. Each Yami individual in the figures represents one nuclear family. The
relationship between villages, ancestral and extended
families (Left lay out of Figure 3A, B and 3C) have been
arranged to represent the Wei and Liu model, in which
“the Yamis are a patrilocal society where families and
their ancestry are village specific” [22]. Accordingly, the

Figure 3 Concordance between Yami NRY phylogenetic diversity (Y-SNP and Y-STR) and the genealogy survey of Wei and Liu (1962).
Phylogenic tree of Y-SNP and Y-STR diversity. Each leaves (or one individual) represent a nuclear family. According to Wei and Liu conclusions
(1962) [22], extended paternal families (left numbers in diagram C) and their ancestral families (Village + Roman numerals in diagram B) are not
shared between villages. Quantitative visualization of the Wei and Liu relationship with NRY phylogenetic is done using the GenGIS program
[46]. Each axis of categories on the left of diagrams A, B or C (i.e. Villages, Ancestral or extended families) have been ranked to introspect the
Wei and Liu statement and represent the least number of crossings of correlation lines between the left axis and the leaves of the NRY
Phylogram. The fit of each ordered genetic lay out to the genealogy of Wei and Liu was tested using a Monte Carlo permutation test on the
leaf nodes. The fraction of crossings lesser than those shown in the figure (A = 14, B = 11 and C = 8) represent the P values. The P values were
all < 0.01 [46] (see also Additional file 4) and indicate that concordance between the NRY phylogeny and the Wei and Liu paternal genealogy is
not random. A - Villages of paternal origin. The spindles from villages represent the NRY distribution throughout Orchid Island. B - Ancestral
paternal families’ correspondences to the NRY phylogeny. Crossing correlation lines are all restricted to the Iraralai village indicating a few
discrepancies between NRY Phylogeny and the Wei and Liu genealogy. C - Extended paternal families. Families 43 to 49 belong to the Iraralai
village. Three families, 44, 45 and 47 have members belonging to different NRY subclades. Reiterating B, this pattern indicates erroneous Wei and
Liu survey information or departure from a patrilocal way of life among Iraralai families but does not destroy the “one family-one village”
relationship observed by Wei and Liu among Yami.

and Ivatan included B4a1a4, B4a2a, B4c1b2, E2b1, and
M7c3c. The sharing of Y-SNP was higher (40.8%) and
included haplogroup O1a*-M119, O1a1*-P203 and
O3a4*-GSP002611. Lin et al. (manuscript in preparation) observed sharing between Taiwanese Han and
TwA (23% for mtDNA haplogroups and 42% for YSNP). This increased Y-SNP contribution could reflect a
sex biased social behavior. Alternatively, it could be
associated with the slower mutation rate of the Y-SNP
polymorphism that results in lower haplogroup diversity.
However, using mtDNA (HVS-1 and relevant coding
region information), Y-STR polymorphism and the
Y-SNP diversity, no such disproportion of haplotype
sharing was seen between Yami and Ivatan (mtDNA:
8%; Y-STR: 7%). The mtDNA haplogroup B4a1a4
defined by np 4025 (Yami 15%, Ivatan 4% and Philippines 1%) was the only representative one of the B4a1a
clade in Yami. Its complete absence in Taiwan Aborigines and higher diversity in Filipinos suggests a northward gene flow from the Philippines within 3,000 years
(Table 2). The two distinct branches of B4a1a4 seen in
Yami and Ivatans (Figure 2) indicated that the islanders
must have remained in isolation since settlement.
Further, the total number of mtDNA haplogroups
(Table 1) observed in Yami and Ivatan (7 and 15 respectively) were relatively small in comparison to that in
Taiwanese Han and the Filipinos (77 and 43) indicating
isolation and a small number of initial founders on the
islands. This indication of isolation of the Yamis
becomes plausible as only ten mtDNA haplotypes with
frequencies ranging from 6 to 24% were sufficient to
represent all the seven Yami mtDNA haplogroups.
Alternatively, poor sampling, small population size on
the small island, and genetic drift may all have influenced the genetic profiles observed [6].
All the Yami and Ivatan Y-SNP haplogroups belonged
to the subgroups of macro haplogroup O which is seen
throughout the MSEA and ISEA. The frequency of haplogroup O3 is high in Northern and Central Asia,
whereas that of haplogroup O2 in south Asia and
MSEA, and that of haplogroup O1 are being mostly distributed throughout ISEA [37,48,49]. The Y-SNP haplogroups seen in Yamis or Ivatans (subgroups of O1a,
O2a, and O3a) also appear in MSEA and together represented a possible minimal haplogroup sharing of 26%
between MSEA and either Yami or Ivatan. Nonetheless,
a distinct contribution from MSEA to the islands was
difficult to ascertain based of Y-SNP polymorphism
alone. A matrilineal influence from MSEA was also indicated by the presence of the mtDNA haplogroups
B4c1b2, F1a1d or M7b4 which determines a matrilineal
contribution of 6% of the Yamis and of 14% with

Page 10 of 15

Ivatans. Many other mtDNA haplogroups seen in Taiwan and ISEA/Philippines suggest a direct gene flow
from these locations to Batanes and/or to Orchid Island.
For example by comparing haplogroup frequency and
gene diversity, haplogroups B4a2a, and E2b1 (and to a
lesser extent F1a1d and N9a10) suggested a gene flow
from Taiwan, and haplogroup B4a1a4, B5b1, E2a and
E2b2 suggested a gene flow from the Philippines. In
general, Yami and Ivatan had stronger affinity with their
closest larger neighbor.
Our mtDNA phylogenetic tree (Additional file 2) puts
Yami and Amis in the same cluster as Ivatans and the
Philippines. Except for the Amis, this clustering followed
the same pattern as described by Ross (2005) indicating
separate sub-branches of Batanic languages for Yamis
and Ivatans both of which belong to the Western
Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language
family, dated back to 2,500 YBP [2,50]. Also, age estimates from molecular variation of mtDNA haplogroup
B4a1a4 and of Y chromosome O1a*-M119 in Yami and
Ivatan indicated and overlap in the dating ranges (95%
CI for mtDNA ranging from 0 to 3,000 YBP, and SE for
Y-STR ranging from 750 to 3,230 YBP) (Table 2 and
Additional file 4). The strong genetic affinity between
Yamis and Taiwan Aborigines and the lack of genetic
flow between Yamis and Ivatans (Additional file 3) led
us to hypothesize that a language shift from Formosan
to Malayo-Polynesian may have occurred among Yami.
The language shift might not be associated with the
gene flow from the Philippines but might have resulted
from linguistic diffusion that was initiated by trading of
jade or other goods in the region [8].
The formation of Yami and Ivatan - time and people

Molecular Dating with the Rho Statistic [51-53] of
mtDNA clades (Table 2) and/or Y-STR clusters (Additional file 4) of Yamis and Ivatans rarely exceeded
~2,000 years (SE 750 to 3,230) which differs from the
archeological estimate of 4,000 years [5,7]. Thus the
extant populations on these islands most likely represent
a more recent family line of immigrants.
Interestingly, none of the mtDNA and Y chromosome
haplogroups seen in Yami or Ivatan suggested a relationship with the eastern Melanesian populations where
mtDNA haplogroups P and Q, and Y-SNP haplogroups
D, C, F and K are prominent [27,35,54]. A few mtDNA
haplogroups among Yamis or Ivatans originated either
in Taiwan (B4a2a, E2b1, F1a1d, and N9a10) or the
Philippines (B4a1a4, E2a, E2b2 and B5b1). All the
remaining haplogroups were commonly seen in Taiwan
Aborigines and Filipinos. The data suggested a bidirectional gene flow and support the “Viaduct model” proposed by [27].

Yami Paternal genealogy and Phylogenetic diversity

While the Y-SNPs haplogroups were heterogeneously
distributed throughout Orchid Island (Figure 3B and
Additional file 4), only one Y-STR lineage (represented
by YF02 and YE14) was seen in two different villages
(Additional file 4). Nonetheless, an AMOVA test using
Y-STR lineages distribution among villages (Table 4)
confirmed the patrilineal heterogeneity (P < 0.0001)
throughout Orchid Island. On the contrary, the
AMOVA test conducted by mtDNA lineages did not
show significant matrilineal genetic variation within or
among villages, indicating that the maternal genetic
ancestry was homogeneously distributed throughout the
island, and that male gene flow rarely occurred. This
observation was supported by the anthropological study
of Wei and Liu [22] and of Yu-mei Chen (private communication) who observed that intermarriage between
villages were common for women from Iranumilk,
Imourud and Ivarinu villages. Further the mtDNA analysis using an exact pairwise population differentiation
test [55] did not show significant differences among the
three villages (Iranumilk, Imourud and Ivarinu) and
other villages on Orchid Island (data not shown).
We also investigated the Yami oral history which
claims that people from Iraralai, Yayu, and Ivarinu had
close relationships with the Ivatans (Yu-mei Chen private communication). In Additional files 3 and 4, two
O1a*-M119 nuclear Yami families showed clustering
with Ivatans (YD05 and YD12 from the extended
families 44 and 47). No such relationships were found
with Taiwan Aborigines or other region of MSEA.
Another strong relationship was seen in the O1a1*-P203
network (Additional file 3) between YD13 (from family
46) and one Y-STR lineage carried by two Filipinos.
Interestingly, our genetic data supported the oral history
reported by (Yu-mei Chen private communication). We
also investigated two other folk tales of Yami, one
related to children adoption and the other related to
people seeking refuge in another village. If child adoption indeed took place, this can be inferred from the
correlation profile of the Iraralai families 44, 45 and 47
each having some family members in different genetic
subclades (Additional file 4). Our NRY data were unable
to support if the people from Imourud had migrated to
Iraralai after a major flood in the island [6].

Conclusions
A close genetic relationship between Yamis and Ivatans
was hypothesized by linguistic studies, since both groups
of islanders belong to the Batanic sub-branches of the
Malayo Polynesian language group found in the ISEA.
Accordingly, such a relationship would indicate a northward migration from the Philippines via Batanes archipelago and Orchid Island toward Taiwan. Our study,

Page 11 of 15

using Y-SNP and mtDNA polymorphism at the macro
haplogroup level, showed that a strong affinity between
the Yamis and Ivatans was resulted from gene flow
between Taiwan and Philippines. Each island population
showed a higher affinity with the closest main island
(i.e., Yami with Taiwan, or Ivatan with Philippines) than
with each other. This suggests an early isolation of the
population and little intermarriage among the islands.
Only few traces of gene flow were found between Yami
and Ivatan or between Yami and Philippines. The gene
flow appear independent from the cultural development,
suggesting that trading had small impacts on genetic
exchanges but must have resulted the linguistic affinity
observed today among Yami, Ivatan and Philippines.
The age estimates of the mtDNA or Y-STRs variations
suggested settlements on the islands dated back to
~3,000 YBP. However, the archeological artifacts found
on Orchid Island and Batanes were associated with the
“Out of Taiwan” hypothesis, indicating a southward
migration from Taiwan and an earlier settlement on the
islands that might be 4,000 YBP. These conflicting
observations suggested that our sampling may have
been too small to reveal sufficient or significant markers
that can support a unique southward gene flow.
In Additional file 5 we propose three separate scenarios [2]. Briefly, scenarios 1 and 2 were proposed by Ross
[2]. They correspond to the “Out of Taiwan” hypothesis
(scenario 1, Additional file 5) and to a northward migration from Luzon to the Batanes archipelago (scenario 2,
Additional file 5).
Ideally, any scenarios should consider variation due to
drift, founder effect and admixture. Although the Out of
Taiwan model [10] allows for some micro-spatial interactions, these conditions are ignored in a linguistic
based model. The simple stepping stones of Neolithic
dispersal represented by scenario 1 (Additional file 5) is
not sufficient to associate with the complexity of genetic
patterns observed in this study. We described that very
little Y-STR sharing between Yami and Ivatan was seen
(Additional file 3). Their mtDNA patterns/profiles was
also very distinct. In general, the mtDNA haplogroups
with high frequencies in one population was very low in
the other population, but the mtDNA haplogroups were
frequently matched among closest populations. Such
variation could also be expected from a strong genetic
drift (as indicated by the Tajima’s D value (Table 1)).
Scenario 3 (Additional file 5) seems to fit well with the
mtDNA and Y-SNP data. It also evokes a much reticulated network of cultural relationships, and suggests (as
for scenario 2) the possibility of northward Malayo-Polynesian language diffusion from Luzon (or from the
Batanes Archipelago). While these hypotheses require
further simulation testing, we propose that the extant
genetic relationship observed between Yamis and

Loo et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/21

Ivatans was resulted from complex events that occurred
during the period of the Out of Taiwan and the subsequent trading between Taiwan and Luzon. Linguistic
diffusion from Philippines may have also affected these
events.
Finally, our diversity analysis of NRY Polymorphism
diversity showed major concordance with the Wei and
Liu paternal genealogies. Such ethnographic study of
kinship provided insights to the complex and uncertain
ways of how ideas of family ancestry, culture and linguistic contributed toward the formation of the Yami
group identities, and how genetic revealed or confirmed
their descent and their origins. Although the paternal
relationships among the Yami groups determined by the
survey of Wei and Liu covered only a few generations, it
contributed clearly toward the groups self perception of
their identity. However, these notions of relatedness
were complicated by the accumulation of too much
information, such as the complex and deeply rooted one
brought upon by genetics. We showed how knowledge
of ancestry, when combined with history, social relationships, genealogy and the use of several genetic systems,
can be put to work to determine the idea of tribally
pure lines of descent within families.
Despite the complex and ambivalent ways in which people perceive the cultural, biological and genetic constitution of ethnic identities, rapid social changes, frequent risk
of ethnic group dilutions or their disappearance, make it
an urgent requisite to obtain additional data from all minority groups, such as the Yami and Ivatan, to record more
accurate extant profiles, and finally to favor multidisciplinary approaches.

Methods
Seventy-nine unrelated Yami from Orchid Island
(30 men and 49 women) were asked to participate in the
study. All individuals provided their name, birthplace, the
name of their parents and the village their parents came
from. Among the 79 individuals, 12 mothers were from
Imourud, 33 from Iraralai, 11 from Yayu, ten from Iratai,
eight from Iranmilk, and five from Ivarinu (Figure 1).
Among the 30 men, five were born in Imourud, 15 in
Iraralai, eight in Yayu, one in Iranmilk, and one in Ivarinu (Additional file 1). Using subject’s name, parents’
names, and birthplace information, each Yami male individual was traced back to one of the extended families
described in the Wei and Liu ‘s genealogy [22]. Since
Wei and Liu’s genealogy was based on patrilineality, only
the Y chromosome phylogeny (Y-SNP and Y-STR) was
used for comparison between the genealogy and genetics.
To analyze the relationship between the Yami and Ivatan, 50 unrelated Ivatan individuals (24 men and 26
women) were recruited from Itbayat, an island of the
Batanes archipelago belonging to the Philippines (Figure 1).

All participants in this study gave informed consent to
the study for collection of blood samples and DNA analysis. The project was approved by the ethics committee
of Mackay Memorial Hospital, the Taiwan Health
Department and the Philippines government.
To analyze the polymorphism of mtDNA and Y chromosome, DNA was extracted from 500 μl of buffy coat
from each blood sample using the QIAmp DNA kit
(QIAmp ® DNA Blood Mini kit from Qiagen inc. Taiwan). The non-recombining region of the Y chromosome
(NRY) was determined using 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and 16 short tandem repeats (STRs).
For mtDNA typing, control region HVS-1 [56], nucleotide positions (nps) of coding region fragments 8000 to
9000, 9800 to 10900 and 14000 to 15000 were sequenced
using the method described in our previous publications
[25,27]. When relevant to the study, complete mtDNA
genome sequencing was carried out [25]. Briefly, 24 fragments of mtDNA were amplified and sequenced in both
directions [25,57]. Haplogroup assignments were done
according to the “Phylotree” criterion [26] available at
http://www.phylotree.org using the combination of the
HVS-1 sequence, partial sequencing of the coding region,
and other relevant diagnostic variants of the coding
region obtained by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) [25,27]. In addition, the presence of np
4025 indicating locally named mtDNA haplogroup
B4a1a4 (Figure 2) was determined by sequence specific
polymorphism (SSP) using forward primer 3999-4025
(5’TATTA TAATA AACAC CCTCA CCACT AT3’),
and reverse primer 4049-4025 (5’TCATA TGTTG
TTCCT ACCAA GATTG3’) as internal primers of fragment 6 described by Rieder [25,57].
Y chromosome polymorphisms were ascertained using
a hierarchical stepwise approach. For this, relevant SNPs
were determined using direct sequencing of amplicons
obtained from specific primer pairs as described in the
Y Chromosome Consortium 2002 [58-60]. In brief,
DNA samples were initially tested for super haplogroup
O markers. Since all Yami and Ivatan samples were
found to belong to this haplogroup, specific down
stream markers of haplogroup O were then determined
using more restricted primers [58]; [37]. Y STRs were
subsequently determined in all individuals using 16
STRs (AmpFlSTR® Y filer® PCR Amplification Kit from
Applied Biosystems, Taiwan).
Data analysis

Frequencies of haplogroups among populations were
obtained by direct counting (Table 1 and 3). On the
basis of haplogroups frequency, mtDNA and Y-STRs
distances matrices were obtained using F st distances
after 10,000 permutations and a 0.05 significance level
(ARLEQUIN package 3.1) [55]. Population phylogenetic

trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ)
method of (Saitou and Nei 1987) implemented in the
Phylip package [61]. Test of neutrality, Tajima’s D value
(1989) [62], was calculated with DnaSP Sequence Polymorphism software package [63].
Specific Fst indices to measure the variance of paternal
or maternal lineages within and between villages was
obtained from AMOVA using ARLEQUIN package 3.1
[55]. Ages of molecular variation for mtDNA were
inferred using the r method for complete sequencing
and HVS-1 data [51-53], using a rate of one synonymous
transition per 7,884 years (bps 590-15990) and one transition per 19,171 years (bps 16090-16365) for the Soares
method, or 6764 years and 20180 for Kivisild and Foster
and Saillard methods respectively [51-53,64]. Y chromosome dates were estimated using Y-STR data in the background of their respective SNP haplogroups using the r
statistic with an average mutation rate of 6.9 × 10-4 ± 5.7
× 10 -4 per locus per 25 years [39]. Generation length,
bottlenecks, founder events and population size
dynamics, geography are confounding factors that may
cause unexpected variations of rho and warrant caution
to inferences made from molecular variation [33].
Y-STR median joining networks were constructed
using Network software 4.5.1.0 [65]. Finally, a Yami
NRY phylogenetic tree was constructed using Y-SNP
and Y-STR patterns in the background of each Y-SNP
haplogroups, O1a*-M119, O1a1*-P203, O2a*-M95,
O2a1a-PK4 and O3a4*-GSP002611 respectively (Additional file 3) [66,67]. Correlation between the village
restricted paternal genealogy of Wei and Liu [22] and
the leaves of the NRY Phylogeny was analyzed and
visualized with the GenGIS package [68]. Accordingly,
extended families, villages and ancestral families (Figure
3A, B and 3C respectively) were first separately laid out
to obtain the minimum number of correlation lines
crossings between the genealogic lay out and the leaves
of the NRY phylogeny. A Monte Carlo permutation test
was performed on the leaves of the Phylogenetic tree to
assess if the fit was significantly better than random.

Additional file 5: Possible settlement scenarios of Orchid Island and
the Batanes archipelago from Taiwan or the Philippines. Scenario 1
is inspired from Ross linguistic study [2] and supports the “Out of
Taiwan” model. The immediate ancestors of Proto Malayo-Polynesian
speakers migrated out of Taiwan (~6,000 YBP to 4,000 YBP) to Orchid
Island, the Batanes islands and Luzon, and developed languages specific
to each regions (Figure 1). Scenario 2 is also inspired from Ross linguistic
study [2]. In brief, the Proto Malayo-Polynesian origin is not located, but
Northern Luzon is assumed to be a center of dispersion. As such, Orchid
and Batanes islands could have been bypassed/ignored by the first
migrants going from Taiwan to Northern Luzon (6,000 YBP to 4,000 YBP).
Proto-Batanic languages would have developed during and after
migrations from Luzon to the Batanes and Orchid islands (~3,000 YBP)
where local languages later became more specific to Ivatan or Yami.
Scenario 3 is based on genetics studies with first, a Bellwood-like
expansion of people out of Taiwan ~4,000 years ago [10]. Secondly,
Orchid and Batanes Islands could have been re-colonized from the south
(as early as ~3,000 years ago, given the genetic estimates). Thirdly, later
gene flow from Taiwan or Luzon would have affected the genetic
profiles of people from Orchid or Batanes islands to look more like
Taiwanese Aborigines or Filipinos respectively. Alternatively, the second
stage could have been restricted to Ivatan who later extended their
influence to Yami. This scheme is compatible with anthropological
studies reporting that little to no external influence between Yami and
Taiwan occurred from 1,500 YBP to 300 YBP [4]. The historically reported
movement of people back and forth between Ivatan and Luzon during
the 18th century typhoon and famine [23] most likely intensified Ivatan
genetic affinity with Luzon and supports the last stage of this scenario.
