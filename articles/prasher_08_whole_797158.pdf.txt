Abstract
Background: Ayurveda is an ancient system of personalized medicine documented and practiced
in India since 1500 B.C. According to this system an individual's basic constitution to a large extent
determines predisposition and prognosis to diseases as well as therapy and life-style regime.
Ayurveda describes seven broad constitution types (Prakritis) each with a varying degree of
predisposition to different diseases. Amongst these, three most contrasting types, Vata, Pitta,
Kapha, are the most vulnerable to diseases. In the realm of modern predictive medicine, efforts are
being directed towards capturing disease phenotypes with greater precision for successful
identification of markers for prospective disease conditions. In this study, we explore whether the
different constitution types as described in Ayurveda has molecular correlates.
Methods: Normal individuals of the three most contrasting constitutional types were identified
following phenotyping criteria described in Ayurveda in Indian population of Indo-European origin.
The peripheral blood samples of these individuals were analysed for genome wide expression
levels, biochemical and hematological parameters. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway based
analysis was carried out on differentially expressed genes to explore if there were significant
enrichments of functional categories among Prakriti types.
Results: Individuals from the three most contrasting constitutional types exhibit striking
differences with respect to biochemical and hematological parameters and at genome wide
expression levels. Biochemical profiles like liver function tests, lipid profiles, and hematological
parameters like haemoglobin exhibited differences between Prakriti types. Functional categories of
genes showing differential expression among Prakriti types were significantly enriched in core
biological processes like transport, regulation of cyclin dependent protein kinase activity, immune

response and regulation of blood coagulation. A significant enrichment of housekeeping, disease
related and hub genes were observed in these extreme constitution types.
Conclusion: Ayurveda based method of phenotypic classification of extreme constitutional types
allows us to uncover genes that may contribute to system level differences in normal individuals
which could lead to differential disease predisposition. This is a first attempt towards unraveling the
clinical phenotyping principle of a traditional system of medicine in terms of modern biology. An
integration of Ayurveda with genomics holds potential and promise for future predictive medicine.

Background
Genome wide expression as well as genetic marker studies
reveal that most genetic variation is due to inter-individual differences at genetic loci within populations [1-4].
The enormous heterogeneity in expression and sequence
variation of genes coupled with genetic network interactions and environmental factors contributes to phenotypic diversity in health and disease. In the Ayurveda
system of medicine, predisposition to a disease as well as
selection of a preventive and curative regime is primarily
based on phenotypic assessment of a person which
includes one's body constitution termed "Prakriti".
Prakriti is a consequence of the relative proportion of
three entities (Tri-Doshas), Vata (V), Pitta (P) and Kapha
(K), which are not only genetically determined (Shukra
Shonita), but also influenced by environment (Mahabhuta
Vikara), maternal diet and lifestyle (Matur Ahara Vihara),
and age of the transmitting parents (Kala-Garbhashaya)
(see Additional File 1). In an individual, the Tri-Doshas
work in conjunction and maintain homeostasis throughout the lifetime starting from fertilization. Distinct properties and functions have been ascribed to each Dosha. For
instance, Vata contributes to manifestation of shape, cell
division, signaling, movement, excretion of wastes, cognition and also regulates the activities of Kapha and Pitta.
Kapha is responsible for anabolism, growth and maintenance of structure, storage and stability. Pitta is primarily
responsible for metabolism, thermo-regulation, energy
homeostasis, pigmentation, vision, and host surveillance.
Much as it would sound surprising, but the sanskrit version of the modern terms described above exists in the
ancient texts (see Additional File 1). Thus phenotypic
diversity, according to Ayurveda, is a consequence of a
continuum of relative proportions of Doshas resulting in
seven possible constitutional types namely Vata, Pitta,
Kapha, Vata-Pitta, Pitta-Kapha, Vata-Kapha and Vata-PittaKapha. Amongst these, the first three are considered as
extremes, exhibiting readily recognizable phenotypes, and
are more predisposed to specific diseases [5-7].
In an earlier study, correlation of specific HLA-DRB1 polymorphisms with Prakriti has been reported [8]. Recently
an attempt has also been made to integrate Ayurveda with
functional genomics to identify pathways associated with

activity of crude and active components of a herb, Ashwagandha, which is used for cancer treatment [9]. In the
present study, to investigate the Ayurvedic system of phenotypic classification in molecular terms, we examined
the possibility of identifying genome wide expression and
biochemical differences amongst the Prakriti types. We
considered gene expression for correlation because it is a
better measure of functional variation at the molecular
level and can also be mapped more effectively to biological processes and pathways [10,11]. It has also been
recently demonstrated that genetic variations underlie
variations in gene expression [12-14]. As a first step we
analyzed normal healthy individuals belonging to the
three most contrasting groups – Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.

Methods
Development of questionnaire for Prakriti assessment
A questionnaire for clinical phenotyping was designed on
the basis of Ayurvedic literature on phenotypes and methods of Prakriti assessment (see Additional File 1). The phenotypic classification, broadly, takes into account criteria
for defining anatomical features like body built, body
frame, size and symmetry of body parts, physiology, physical endurance and aptitudes. Besides, the questionnaire
also captures information pertaining to ethnicity, family
history of diseases etc. Each of the questions has multiple
options to choose from, and each of the options further
refers to it being a property attributed to either V, P or K
(see questionnaire as Additional File 2 and Table 1). Individuals who had thin and narrow body frame, weakly
developed body build, with irregular appetite, food and
bowel habits, difficulty in gaining weight, quick at physical activities, dry skin and hair, and less tolerance for cold
temperature were considered as Vata Prakriti. Individuals
with moderately developed build, high frequency of appetite and thirst, good digestive power, perspiration tendency higher than normal, tolerance for cold weather,
moderately mobile with moderate physical strength were
identified as Pitta Prakriti. Individuals who had broad
body frames with well developed body build, tendency to
gain weight, low appetite and digestion, preferred to be
less mobile, less forgetful and with good healing power
and cool temperament, were selected as Kapha individuals.

We also developed an automated software for parsing and
calculating scores of V, P, K in an individual using a 0/1
against V/P/K for each of the questions depending on a no
or yes answer respectively. Cumulative scores of V, P and
K is calculated in each individual through the software
without the intervention of the Ayurveda expert.

Subsequently 96 unrelated ethnically matched healthy
individuals with predominance of either Vata (39 individuals), Pitta (29) or Kapha (28) were identified and
included equal numbers of both genders (n = 48 in each
case) and belonged to an age group of 18 – 40 years
(mean age ~23 ± 4 years).

Clinical phenotyping and identification of volunteers
The identification of individuals of predominant Prakriti
types were carried out by two Ayurveda physicians (co
authors of this paper). In order to avoid any confounding
observations due to population stratification the study
was conducted on Indo-European speaking large populations predominantly from North India. A preliminary
assessment of Prakriti was carried out on a total of 850 volunteers, nearly half by each of the two clinicians using
subjective assessment and a screening questionnaire. The
short-listing of individuals to be recruited for detailed
phenotyping was also carried out independently. The
short-listed individuals were swapped between the two
clinicians and were assessed in detail for their Prakriti
using the questionnaire (see Additional File 2). These
comprised of nearly 120 individuals of predominant
Prakriti and 200 individuals of heterogeneous Prakriti.
There was nearly 80% concordance observed in Prakriti
assessment between two clinicians.

Sample collection
Peripheral blood samples of selected individuals were collected using standard procedures following ethical guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research, India and
informed consent of volunteers. Sample collection was
carried out following approval of the Institutional Bioethics Committee (IBC). Three hours prior to sample collection all the volunteers were provided a similar diet with
no interim intake of food, beverage or smoking. It was
ensured that the subject was not ill or under any medication. Blood pressure, pulse, and menstrual cycle, if on,
were also recorded.
Biochemical estimation and analysis
33 biochemical parameters which are used in routine
diagnostics were selected. Biochemical estimations were
carried out using automated analyzer and standardized
kits on all selected volunteers. The tests performed and the
standard accepted normal ranges for these parameters are

differences between the groups, the parameters with normal distribution were analysed using one way ANOVA
with the help of MATLAB. Kruskal Wallis was used for
those with non normal distribution.

DNA isolation, genotyping and validation of genetic
homogeneity
Before undertaking research using these collected samples, the samples were coded in order to maintain their
anonymity. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral
blood leukocytes using the salting-out procedure [15].

In order to validate genetic homogeneity, these samples
were genotyped and analyzed along with 24 reference
populations derived from different ethnic and linguistic
lineages, Indo-European (IE), Austro-Asiatic (AA), TibetoBurman (TB) and Dravidian (DR) from various geographical zones using a panel of SNPs which were identified as
a part of an ongoing Indian Genome Variation Consortium project[16,17]. Genotyping of SNPs was carried out
on the Bead array based Illumina platform. Estimation of
DA distance [17,18] between populations and phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the neighbor joining
(NJ) method[19] which was done using DISPAN (available from http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/)
RNA isolation and cDNA microarray experiments
RNA was extracted within 2–3 hrs of collection using the
EZ-RNA isolation kit (Biological Industries, Israel) following the manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression profiling was carried out using Human 19Kv8 cDNA microarray
(UHN Microarray Databases, CA Ontario). We followed a
loop design method for inter group comparisons (illustrated below). In each set of experiments (Figure 1) comprising of 3 slides, pooled samples of each Prakriti were
labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 and hybridized to the other two
[20]. Four sets of experiments for males and females each
were carried out involving a total of 72 samples. One set
of experiments failed the QC criteria and was not considered for analysis. The results of 4 biological replicates and
4 technical replicates (dye swap) of each Prakriti in
females, and 3 biological and 3 technical replicates of
each Prakriti in males are presented. The detailed method
for labeling, hybridization and scanning are given below.
The data has been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, ID GSE7883) following Minimum Information About Microarray Experiment (MIAME) norms.

Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from 15 μg of
total RNA of pooled samples (5 μg each sample), using
Microarray cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, GmbH). The
cDNA was purified using Micorarray Target Purification
Kit (Roche, GmbH), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each pool of Vata, Pitta and Kapha purified cDNA

was divided into two halves, and labeled with Cy5 or Cy3
(Amersham Biosciences) using Microarray RNA Target
Synthesis Kit T7 (Roche, GmbH) and the labeled products
were purified using Microarray Target Purification Kit
(Roche, GmbH). Pooled samples were precipitated,
washed and air-dried. The dried pellet was dissolved in
RNAase free water (Sigma). Hybridization solution was
prepared by mixing hybridization buffer (DIG Easy Hyb;
Roche, GmbH), 10 mg/ml salmon testis DNA (0.05 mg/
ml final concentration, Sigma) and 10 mg/ml yeast tRNA
(0.05 mg/ml final concentration, Sigma) and added to the
labeled product. This mixture was denatured at 65°C and
applied on to 19K cDNA microarray. Hybridization was
carried out at 37°C for 16 hrs. Following hybridization,
slides were washed thrice (15 minutes each) in 1× SSC
(Saline Sodium Citrate) and 0.2% SDS (Sodium Dodecyl
Sulphate) at 50°C. This was followed by two 15 minute
washes at room temperature in 1× SSC. Finally, slides
were washed in 0.1× SSC for 15 minutes and excess fluid
was removed from the slide by centrifugation at 600 rpm
for 5 minutes. Microarray slides were scanned at 10 μm
resolution in GenePix 4000A Microarray Scanner (Molecular Devices). The 16 bit TIFF images were preprocessed
and quantified using Gene Pix Pro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices).
Statistical analysis of microarray
Analysis was carried out using R language [21] taking two
sets of experiments at a time (which include four data

points each of V, P, K), separately for male and female
data. Background subtracted mean values were considered
for analysis and only spots having above background values across all arrays were considered. Values were log2
transformed and lowess normalization was applied to
remove spatial dye bias. Across-array normalization was
carried out using quantile normalization method. Oneway analysis of variance was adopted to identify differentially expressed genes in all three categories. F-test was carried out in order to reject the hypothesis of equality of
three group means. In order to investigate further the
nature of differentially expressed genes; strip charts were
drawn and pair wise comparisons were made using t-test.
p-values obtained from t-test have been adjusted for multiplicity using Bonferroni method for controlling family

considered to be differentially expressed among all three
groups.

Biosystems, Foster City, CA), following the manufacturer
recommended protocols. The cDNA was amplified using
Taqman universal PCR mastermix (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). It was ensured that the amount of cDNA
template added to each reaction was restricted to a relatively narrow Ct range as determined by the cDNA quality
control measurement of 18S rRNA. Since no single reference/control was used in the study, instead of fold change
values, expression differences were estimated through
comparison of delta (Δ) Ct values of V, P and K subsets
using ANOVA. ΔCt values were calculated for each gene
using 18srRNA as internal control. Since the sample sizes
were small, both males and females (n = 96) were considered together for the analysis. One way ANOVA was carried out using MATLAB for determining differences
between the three and two groups. Low or High mean ΔCt
values were inferred as up-regulation or down-regulation
respectively.

In order to investigate whether the expression differences
observed between V, P, K were specific or contributed by
inter-individual variations we randomly generated three
groups from the same experiment sets as used in V, P, K
analysis. A similar analysis methodology was applied as
described above and genes whose expression differences
were significantly different at p ≤ 0.05 were considered.
This was repeated twice with different random sets.

Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes
Gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using GO
tools Box http://burgundy.cmmt.ubc.ca/GOToolBox/ for
classifying the differentially expressed genes into biological processes. Annotation of 19 K array as obtained by
source batch search http://smd-www.stanford.edu/cgibin/source/sourceBatchSearch (June 2007 release) was
used for GO analysis. We looked at enriched GO categories both with (p ≤ 0.05), and without Bonferroni correction (p ≤ 0.01) as Bonferroni correction has been
proposed to be overly conservative and counterproductive
in interpreting microarray results [22]. Pathway analysis
was carried out using Pathway Express of ONTO-Tools
http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/ontoexpress/[23]. We followed the definition of hubs as those which belonged to
the top 20% of the interacting proteins [24] as reported in
HPRD database http://www.hprd.org. These hubs had
more than ten interacting partners. Human housekeeping
genes were retrieved from the Eisenberg and Levanon's
study [25]. Cluster and Tree View were used for making
Heat Maps.

In addition we also studied genes which show intra group
variations within each constitution types (by estimating
variance) as well as those which did not vary across all the
constitution types (by estimating S.D). For both the cases
quantile normalized expression values were used, treating
each pool as a sample. We selected a 5% cut off of upper
variance and lower S.D for identifying the genes that show
intra group variations or are similar across groups, respectively.
Similarly to investigate whether the biochemical differences obtained among V, P and K are specific to these
groups, we randomly labeled the 96 samples into three
groups and carried out ANOVA. This process was iterated
1000 times. The mean of the F values obtained from random samples were compared with that obtained with the
test set and depicted as Box plot using R language.
Quantitative PCR analysis
In order to validate the microarray experiment results a
small subset of 18 genes along with 18S rRNA (control)
were selected for quantitative real time PCR on individual
samples of males and females. TAQMAN PCR using custom designed TLDA assay (Applied Biosystems) was carried out on ABI 7900. Each experiment was carried out in
triplicates. RNA from all samples were reverse transcribed
to cDNA using High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied

Results
Genetic affinity of the study population to Indo-European
populations of India
Indian populations exhibit extensive linguistic and ethnic
diversity. Therefore, as a first step, the genetic homogeneity of the study population was validated by phylogenetic
analysis with known ethnic Indian populations included
in the Indian Genome Variation Consortium. Analysis
confirmed that the study population was most closely
related to Indo-European Large populations [16,17]
which corroborated with the information captured in the
questionnaire (see Additional File 4).

Clinical phenotyping
On an average 10% of the individuals were of predominant Prakriti types as assessed by the physicians. Cumulative scores of V, P and K calculated for each individual
through the software without the intervention of the
Ayurveda expert also corroborated with the expert's assessment. The percentage mean score of either V, P or K features in individuals of predominant Vata, Pitta or Kapha
constitution types respectively calculated through the software was significantly higher than the mean score of V.P,
K obtained from set of heterogeneous Prakriti groups who
were not classified as predominant types.
Individuals of different Prakritis exhibit differences at
biochemical level
Among the 33 Biochemical parameters, 15 parameters in
males and 4 in females, revealed significant differences (p
≤ 0.05), albeit, within the normal range, with respect to
Prakriti (Figure 2A and 2B and see Additional File 5).
Notably, the components of the lipid profiles like triglyc-

erides (TG), total cholesterol, VLDL, LDL, LDL/HDL ratio,
the common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases was
higher in Kapha when compared to Pitta and Vata males.
Additionally, Kapha also had lower levels of HDL when
compared to Vata. The levels of serum uric acid, recently
considered to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality, were also found to be elevated in Kapha. In
addition, GGPT, SGPT, and serum Zinc were found to be
high in Kapha. Serum prolactin and prothrombin time
were high in Vata in comparison to Kapha and/or Pitta. On
the other hand, hematological parameters like hemoglobin, PCV, and RBC count differed significantly
amongst all the three groups where, Pitta males showed
high values in comparison to Vata and/or Kapha.
In females only 4 parameters among all those measured
differed among the groups with Pitta showing the highest
levels in all cases. Phosphorus level varied significantly
among groups with Pitta > Kapha > Vata. Besides, Pitta dif-

copper levels.
Significant differences were not obtained when random
sets (1000 iterations) of individuals grouped into three
sets were compared. The mean of F statistics from ANOVA
of the random sets was insignificant and always lower
than the test sets (see Additional File 6).
Significant differences in genome wide expressions among
individuals of distinct Prakriti types
Analysis of genome wide expression through cDNA
microarrays, using independently pooled samples of Vata,
Pitta and Kapha males and females in a set of loop design
experiments revealed a number of differentially expressed
genes in each category of individuals. Out of the 8416
annotated genes in the 19K array (CA Ontario) 159 in
males and 92 in females (excluding un-annotated ESTs)
were observed to be differentially expressed (p ≤ 0.05).
Only 5 genes among these were common to both the
groups. Amongst the differentially expressed genes there
was a significant (p < 1.8 × 10–12; n = 53) over-representation of hub and housekeeping genes (p < 10-07; n = 19)
(see Additional File 7). 93% of the differentially expressed
genes amongst the Prakriti groups did not show any over-

lap with the genes obtained with the random sets. Real
time quantitative PCR was carried out on 96 individual
samples for validation of microarray data. 18 genes were
considered for analysis, eight (ADM, ATP5G2, CH25H,
FAS, FTL, HLA-DQB1, KCNJ2, TALDO1) showed similar
profiles as observed in microarray (see Additional File 8).
Systemic differences in Prakriti types reflected in GO
categories and molecular pathways
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed
genes, revealed contrasting enrichments of core biological
processes which remained significant even after Bonferroni correction (p ≤ 0.05, Table 2 and 3) amongst the
Prakriti groups. Males of the Vata group showed a distinct
up regulation of genes involved in regulation of cyclin
dependent protein kinase activity and regulation of
enzyme activity. In Vata females, over-expression of genes
related to nucleocytoplasmic transport was observed. In
Kapha males, overall down-regulation of genes of fibrinolysis involved in negative regulation of blood coagulation
was observed. Pitta males exhibited significant over
expression of genes related to immune response (response
to biotic stimulus) (Table 2 and 3). However, there were
some distinct differences between males and females.
Besides, females also demonstrated comparatively lower

inter group differences and a considerable higher intragroup variance (data not shown).

localization were observed to be enriched in the dataset of
similarly expressed genes (see Additional File 9).

When analysis was done without the overly conservative
correction, some similarity in biological processes was
revealed in males and females (Figure 3A and 3B). Both
males and females of Vata group showed enrichment of
differentially expressed genes involved in cellular processes like cell cycle, DNA repair and recombination. Additionally males of the Vata group showed a distinct down
regulation of genes involved in response to biotic stimulus and inflammatory response which was not observed in
the corrected GO Biological processes. In Kapha males,
overall up-regulation of genes involved in cellular biosynthesis including ATP and cofactor biosynthesis and purine
salvage pathway were observed. Complement activation
was observed to be low in both Kapha males and females.

The systemic differences observed between the Prakritis in
biological processes were also evident in pathways. For
instance over-expression of genes of immune related pathways was observed in Pitta and cell cycle related in Vata in
males (Table 2 and 3). Though immunity was not
reflected as enriched in GO process, both B- and T-cell
receptor signaling pathways were enriched in overexpressed genes of Kapha males. It is interesting to note
that functional categories of genes that significantly vary
among Prakriti groups correlate with few descriptions of
their functions in Ayurveda for e.g. Vata (cell division and
regulation of function of Kapha and Pitta), Pitta (host surveillance) and Kapha with anabolism (see Additional File
1)

We also compared the biological processes which differentiated the constitution types versus the ones which did
not. Strikingly, none of the biological processes obtained
after correction show any overlap. However, when we did
not perform correction there were a few overlaps in the
processes. Importantly, in males, immune response, cell
homestasis, co-factor biosynthesis, purine salvage, fibrinolysis, DNA damage check point and protein export
from nucleus were exclusive to the differentially expressed
set. In females, lipid biosynthesis, neurotransmitter catabolism, NLS-bearing substrate import into nucleus, mitotic
recombination was unique to the differentially expressed
set. The processes like cell division, differentiation, motility and development as well as processes related to protein

Discussion
We observed significant differences in biochemical and
genome wide expression levels in individuals from three
contrasting constitution types selected on the basis of phenotyping principles of Ayurveda (Table 2 and 3). A
number of differences in biochemical parameters also correlate to gene expression differences. Lipid profiles, which
are used as markers for cardiovascular diseases differed
significantly between groups. Apart from lipid profile,
serum uric acid, recently considered to be an independent
predictor of cardiovascular mortality [26] was also found
to be significantly high in Kapha males, compared to other
groups. Besides, Kapha males also had high levels of LDL,
reduced prothrombin time and low expression of genes

Biological Process (GOBP) category enrichments in distinct Prakriti groups – "Vata" (V), "Pitta" (P) and "Kapha" (K). Each column
defines profiles based on their unique expression in one Prakriti compared to the other two. For instance "P-" refers to downregulation in Pitta when compared to Vata and Kapha and vice versa for "P+". Heat map (made using Cluster and Tree View)

related to fibrinolysis (KRT1 and F2), features which are
reported to increase risk for atherosclerotic conditions
[27,28]. Susceptibility of Kapha individuals to cardiovascular and atherosclerosis also exists in Ayurveda texts
(Dhamani Pratichaya, see Additional File 1). Females classified by Prakriti did not exhibit differences in lipid profiles, possibly due to age and heterogeneity in hormonal
cycles even within similar constitution types. Heterogeneity in females were also reflected in gene expression profiles.
Hematological differences also correlated with gene
expression levels. Higher expression of genes which affects
hemoglobin levels HBA1, HBB, NOV [29], in Pitta com-

pared to Vata and Kapha correlate with the differences in
hemoglobin levels between the Prakritis.
Interestingly, 78 (31% of the entire data set) of the genes
that were differentially expressed among Prakriti groups
were reported to be associated with complex and monogenic diseases in OMIM and genetic association database
(GAD). Noteworthy were a number of hub genes like
TLR4, FAS, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA1, F2, HLA-C, IFNAR1,
which link complex diseases related to metabolic, immunological, infectious, cardiovascular, neuro-psychiatric
disorders and cancer (see Additional File 10). Additionally genes DPYD [30,31], ABCC1[32], FTL[33] and
ICAM3[34] whose expression is shown to be associated

with outcome of cancer treatment were also observed in
the data set. The differential expression of these disease
associated genes might have implication in health and
disease.

Conclusion
It is well acknowledged that subtle variations in large
number of genes and their interactions can give rise to system-wide changes which confer differential predisposition to diseases. These variations are common and
contribute to 95% of the inter-individual differences
observed both at the expression and genetic level in a population. In this exploratory study, we have analysed differences between subsets of individuals from a
homogeneous population which are at the phenotypic
endpoints of normal health spectrum identified using
method of classification described in Ayurveda. The
extreme constitution types revealed differences at gene
expression level as well as biochemical levels and also
included genes with reported disease involvement. Interestingly, it revealed differences in a significant number of
hub and housekeeping genes which if perturbed can have
system-wide effects. Although, this study has been carried
out on a small dataset and requires a more rigorous study
of Ayurveda based phenotype to genotype correlations on
larger number of individuals and diverse populations for
validation, nevertheless, it gives us a lead and confidence
to use this method of phenotyping to capture variability
among the normal healthy individuals and classify them
into more uniform population types.
The study provides a molecular framework for understanding the holistic principles of the Indian Traditional
System of Medicine, Ayurveda. Identification of genetic
variations that underlie differential expression of genes
and biochemical end-points, co-relatable to Prakriti phenotypes will further provide a strong basis for integration
of this holistic science with modern genomic approaches
for predictive marker discovery and system biology studies.
