Abstract
Background: BamHI-A rightward frame-1 (BARF1) is a carcinoma-specific Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded
oncogene. Here we describe the BARF1 sequence diversity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), other EBV-related
diseases and Indonesian healthy EBV carriers in relation to EBV genotype, viral load and serology markers.
Nasopharyngeal brushings from 56 NPC cases, blood or tissue from 15 other EBV-related disorders, spontaneous B
cell lines (LCL) from 5 Indonesian healthy individuals and several prototype EBV isolates were analysed by PCRdirect sequencing.
Results: Most NPC isolates revealed specific BARF1 nucleotide changes compared to prototype B95-8 virus. At the
protein level these mutations resulted in 3 main substitutions (V29A, W72G, H130R), which are not considered to
cause gross tertiary structure alterations in the hexameric BARF1 protein. At least one amino acid conversion was
detected in 80.3% of NPC samples compared to 33.3% of non-NPC samples (p < 0.001) and 40.0% of healthy LCLs
(p = 0.074). NPC isolates also showed more frequent codon mutation than non-NPC samples. EBV strain typing
revealed most isolates as EBV type 1. The viral load of either NPC or non-NPC samples was high, but only in nonNPC group it related to a particular BARF1 variant. Serology on NPC sera using IgA/EBNA-1 ELISA, IgA/VCA-p18
ELISA and immunoblot score showed no relation with BARF1 sequence diversity (p = 0.802, 0.382 and 0.058,
respectively). NPC patients had variable antibody reactivity against purified hexameric NPC-derived BARF1
irrespective of the endogenous BARF1 sequence.
Conclusion: The sequence variation of BARF1 observed in Indonesian NPC patients and controls may reflect a
natural selection of EBV strains unlikely to be predisposing to carcinogenesis. The conserved nature of BARF1 may
reflect an important role in EBV (epithelial) persistence.

Background
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human gamma-herpes virus
that establishes persistent infection of B lymphocytes in
more than 90% of the human adult population [1,2]. EBV
is associated with a variety of lymphocytic cell malignancies including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin’s Disease,
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and post-transplant and AIDSassociated lymphoproliferative disorders as well as
epithelial cell malignancies such as nasopharyngeal

carcinoma (NPC) and gastric carcinoma, reflecting its
dual cell tropism [3].
The vast majority of NPC cases, in particular the prevalent undifferentiated WHO type-III, is 100% related to
EBV infection. In this type of NPC, EBV is present in all
tumour cells with active expression of distinct viral coding and non coding genes [4]. The etiological role of
EBV in NPC pathogenesis is consistently reflected by
the presence of clonal EBV genomes in premalignant
and malignant nasopharyngeal lesions [5] and the
expression of viral proteins [4]. NPC develops in parallel
with characteristic IgA and IgG antibody responses to
EBV proteins which are detectable at early and even
preclinical stage of disease [6-8]. Moreover, abnormal

EBV DNA loads and viral mRNA are present in nasopharyngeal brushings, whereas elevated EBV DNA loads
are detectable in the circulation of most patients at the
time of NPC diagnosis [7,9-11].
Two types of EBV have been identified, which can be
discriminated by genomic difference in a subset of latent
genes encoding EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2),
EBNA-3A, -3B, and -3C [12,13]. EBV type 1, which is
predominantly detected in Asian NPC patients, has a
greater efficiency of B lymphocyte transformation than
EBV type 2 [14], and this difference may associate with
divergence in the EBNA-2 sequences [15,16].
EBV gene expression between and within tumors is
highly variable. Each EBV-associated malignancy is characterized by a distinct viral gene expression profile,
although EBNA-1, EBERs, and BARTs are found in all
EBV-related tumors [4]. Of the 86 genes encoded by
EBV genome [17], two are considered as viral oncogenes, i.e. LMP1 and BARF1, both having tumorigenic
activity in an epithelial background [2,18-20].
LMP1 is detected only in 50-90% of NPC tumors with
heterogenous expression [21-23]. LMP1 gene with a
30 bp deletion (del-LMP1) at nucleotide positions
168256-168285 (codons 346-355) compared to the B958 EBV prototype is found in a higher frequency of Asian
NPC cases [24,25]. In addition, EBV del-LMP 1 is associated with increased NPC tumorigenicity in nude mice
[26]. More recently, additional amino acid substitutions
have been described for LMP1, but the functional consequences remain unclear [27,28].
BARF1-encoded protein was found to be expressed in
more than 85% NPC biopsies and its mRNA is consistently expressed [10,29-31]. BARF1 protein forms a hexameric structure that is actively secreted and may act as
immunomodulator through homology with the colony
stimulating factor receptor c-fms, binding CSF-1 (MCSF) [17,30-35]. BARF1 has mitogenic properties and
can induce oncogenic transformation in rodent fibroblasts [18,19,35] and human B lymphocytic line [36,37].
Overexpression of BARF1 in EBV-infected epithelial
cells leads to enhanced tumor formation in nude mice
[20] and its immortalization potency has been demonstrated in monkey kidney primary epithelial cells [38].
Moreover, the BARF1 gene is consistently transcribed in
EBV-positive gastric cancer in the absence of LMP1
[31,39]. Thus, BARF1 would then be more pivotal for
NPC oncogenesis than the LMP1 protein. However, in
contrast to LMP1 which has been widely explored,
study of BARF1 sequence variation is still limited.
Therefore in the present study we aimed to determine
whether BARF1 gene has sequence diversity in NPC. To
verify its association with NPC, sequence analysis in
other EBV-related disorders and in spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) established from healthy

Indonesian blood donors was also defined. To identify
whether BARF1 variation has an influence on tumor
biology, EBV genotype (EBNA-2 subtype), EBV DNA
load, and serology pattern were analysed. Finally, we
studied the immunogenic properties of NPC-derived
BARF1 as a purified hexameric protein.

Results
Most of NPC isolates display nucleotide and amino acid
changes

In the present study we have sequenced the complete
BARF1 gene from 56 NPC brushing samples,15 nonNPC EBV-related tissue or blood, 5 spontaneous LCL
from healthy EBV-seropositive individuals and several
NPC-derived and non-NPC reference EBV strains. The
EBV genome of B95-8 was used as the prototype EBV
strain. The sequence of BARF1 gene derived from the
B95-8 transformed LCL JY was identical to that of the
B95-8 sequence from the database (GeneBank No.
V01555). Prototype GD1 and AG876 strains also revealed
an identical BARF1 sequence compared to B95-8. The
C666-1 cell line showed 1 silent mutation at position of
165545 (T to C). The C15 tumor line displayed 4 nucleotide mutations, one at position of 165589 (T to C) leading
to V29A conversion, and 3 silent mutations at position of
165677 (G to A), 165944 (C to T), and 166136 (C to T).
The C17 tumor line did not demonstrate any nucleotide
exchange compared to the B95-8 prototype.
Fourty-five (80.3%) NPC isolates, 5 (33.3%) non-NPC
EBV isolates, and 2 (40.0%) healthy LCLs exhibited
nucleotide mutations relative to the B95-8 prototype
sequence (table 1). A total of 11 different nucleotide
mutations were identified, scattered over the BARF1
sequence. Most NPC isolates showed multiple point
mutations within the BARF1 nucleotide sequence. At
the protein level most NPC (78.6%) demonstrated 2
amino acid substitutions at position V29A (valine to alanine) and H130R (histidine to arginine), except 1 sample
(NPC-13) which displayed a unique conversion in the
position of W72G and H130R. Some isolates (14.3%)
showed rare mutations at position W72G (tryptophan to
glycine). Very rare mutations at position S12T (serine to
threonine) and S128F (serine to phenylalanine) were
also observed in 2 single NPC samples, together with
the above-mentioned more prevalent V29A and H130R
changes. Other nucleotide mutations did not result in
amino acid substitutions and were therefore silent.
Most of non-NPC EBV samples and healthy LCLs did
not exhibit any nucleotide change and the sequences
were similar to the B95-8 genome. Some isolates (33.3%
of non-NPC and 40.0% of healthy carriers) showed 2-6
nucleotide mutations leading to 2 specific codon
exchanges. These converting amino acids were identical
to those of NPC majority (V29A and H130R).

Overall, amino acid conversion was revealed in 80.3%
of NPC samples which is significant compared to 33.3%
in non-NPC isolates (p < 0.001) but insignificant compared to the substitution rate of 40.0% in LCLs from
regional healthy EBV carriers (p = 0.074). Statistical analysis also suggested that NPC isolates displayed more
BARF1 sequence diversity than isolates in other EBVrelated disorders (table 2). These differences were significant in the presence of 2 (p < 0.001) and 3-4 amino
acid changes (p = 0.030).
Phylogenetic Analysis

The sequences from all isolates were applied to construct a phylogenetic tree to verify the genetic difference
among EBV isolates from all groups either in nucleotide
or amino acid level (figure 1). The samples were characteristically clustered according to their sequence variations. There was little difference in display between the
tree of nucleotide and amino acid as many nucleotide
mutations consisted of silent exchanges.
At amino acid level the tree was divided into several
branches with the common mutations at codon 29 and
130. The group with most of non-NPC and healthy
samples in term of their similarity to the sequence of
B95-8, GD1 and AG876 contained only few NPC isolates. In contrary, majority of NPC were included in
other branches along with a small number of non-NPC

and Indonesian healthy LCLs characterizing the occurence of more mutations and diversities. One NPC
(NPC-20) and 3 PTLD isolates (PTLD-2, PTLD-6, and
PTLD-7) were put in a separated branch from other isolates revealing same codon conversions (V29A and
H130R) because they had less overall nucleotide mutations. Seven NPC isolates were grouped together as the
fact of having 3 mutations. Two of them (NPC-16 and
NPC-44) had further separation than the other 5 as they
presented one more rare mutation.
In the NPC lines, C666-1 cell line had 1 silent mutation and was grouped together with the EBV genome
prototypes, most of non-NPC and healthy samples, and
few of NPC isolates at both the phylogenetic tree. In
this group the C17 tumor line was also classified since it
exhibited identical BARF1 gene sequence to B95-8. The
C15 tumor line, which showed 4 nucleotide exchanges,
was clustered with some PTLD isolates at nucleotide
tree. At amino acid level 1 NPC sample joined this
small cluster, which was separated from most of NPC
samples.
Structural analysis of BARF1 amino acid substitutions

Using the recently published crystal structure of hexameric B95-8 derived BARF1 we analysed possible
implications of the most prevalent amino acid changes
on protein secondary structure elements [17]. The three

main amino acid substitutions are depicted in figure 2.
The conserved V29A mutation is positioned at the start
of an internal beta-sheet element and is predicted to
render little change to the overall structure. The W29G
mutation is providing more flexibility to a beta sheet
element inside the BARF1 molecule normally stabilized
by hydrophobic interactions. It is uncertain to what
extent this substitutions affects the overall BARF1 structure. The H130R replacement is located towards the
water-contact surface of the inner core of the BARF1
hexameric structure and may have little effect on structure, merely affecting hydrophilic water interactions.
Overall the most prevalent amino acid changes in
BARF1 sequence are therefore not considered to change
the structural properties of BARF1.
Correlation of BARF1 sequence variation with viral and
diagnostic parameters

To determine whether BARF1 variation might associate
with a particular EBV genotype, we performed a classic
EBV genotype analysis for the EBNA-2 gene [13,40].
The EBV-positive JY (B95-8) DNA was used as positive
control for EBV type 1 (250 bp in length) while Jijoye
DNA was used as positive control for EBV type 2 (300
bp in length). EBV type 1 was detected in 55/56 (98.2%)
of NPC cases and 14/15 (93.3%) of other EBV-related
disorders, respectively. One NPC sample showed mixedtype infection and 1 non-NPC sample contained EBV
type 2. No correlation was found between the presence
of BARF1 variant to the EBV genotype, although the
number of type 2 isolates was too small to allow statistical analysis.
Severity of EBV-associated diseases can be reflected in
the level of EBV DNA load in biological specimens

obtained from affected patients, as demonstrated by us
and others before [9,10]. Therefore we analysed EBV
DNA loads in nasopharyngeal brushings and peripheral
blood samples from the patients in our cohort that
yielded the BARF1 isolates as shown in figure 3A and
3B. All viral DNA loads from either NPC or non-NPC
samples were above the cutoff (2,300 copies/brush or
2,000 copies/ml blood). No trend or difference between
the extent of BARF1 codon conversion and the level of
EBV DNA load in nasopharyngeal brushings was found
in the NPC samples (p = 0.606) while there was significant difference between them in blood of the non-NPC
samples (p = 0.014). When considering 1 outlier in the
non-NPC isolates, no significance is reached (p = 0.261).
Because BARF1 variation might have an effect on NPC
tumor behaviour or EBV activity associating with the
malignant process, we analysed possible correlations
between BARF1 sequence variation and biological markers reflecting NPC disease progression. Most NPC
samples were obtained from patients with advanced disease (tumor, nodul >2). No relation was found between
the level of BARF1 variation and tumor, nodul or metastase-stage (data not shown).
Increased EBV activity underlying the disease process
is frequently reflected in abnormal antibody responses.
Therefore we analysed whether BARF1 variation would
lead to aberrant anti-EBV antibody responses in our
cohort. Figure 4 shows the relation between the number
of amino acid changes of BARF1 variants and serological
responses of individual patients carrying this variant in
the NPC group. IgA antibody levels measured by ELISA
against EBV latent antigen (IgA/EBNA-1) and EBV lytic
antigen (IgA/VCA-p18), shown in figure 4A and 4B.
Most of NPC sera exhibited high level of IgA reactivity

EBV, generally showing an elevated IgG diversity score
in NPC sera. When we associated IgG diversity score to
the genetic diversity of BARF1 no significant difference
was proven (p = 0.058).
Finally, because BARF1 mutation might have a direct
influence on immune recognition and possible immune
escape, we compared anti-BARF1 specific antibody
responses in NPC and control patients, with known
endogenous BARF1 sequence. The BARF1 used for analysis contained the most prevalent V29A and H130R.
This “mutant” BARF1 protein was expressed and
secreted as a hexameric molecule in human HEK293
cells and purified to homogeneity by lectin-affinity chromatography, as described in detail elsewhere (Hoebe
et al., manuscript submitted). The data shown in figure
5 indicate that NPC patients and EBV seropositive controls with or without mutations in their endogenous
BARF1 sequence have detectable but variable antiBARF1 antibody responses. No statistical difference in
the anti-BARF1 responses was observed between
patients with B95-8 prototype or mutated NPC-related
BARF1 (p = 0.850). The observed anti-BARF1 IgG reactivity was relatively low compared to anti-EBNA-1 and
anti-VCA responses in the same sera (data not shown).
NPC patients showed elevated but individually variable
IgG reactivities to BARF1 which were different compared to healthy EBV carriers. This may be of relevance
for NPC serodiagnosis.

value set on 2,300 copies/brushing in NPC brushing and 2,000

compared to the presence of BARF1 amino acid conversion, no significant difference was demonstrated (p =

respectively). Immunoblot analysis reveals the IgG diversity underlying the overall antibody response against

Discussion
BARF1 is a putative EBV-encoded oncogene, predominantly and abundantly expressed in EBV-associated carcinoma, but not in EBV-driven lymphomas [30,39,41].
To characterize genetic diversity of the EBV-encoded
BARF1 oncogene, we analysed BARF1 nucleotide
sequences in various EBV-positive clinical specimens.
Since BARF1 is especially expressed in epithelial tumor
cells, the focus was on EBV-driven NPC tumors. This
study is the first to describe in detail the sequence variation of the BARF1 genotype in NPC, non-NPC EBV isolates, and healthy carriers.
A total of 11 nucleotide changes were found among
NPC isolates, most of them being silent mutations. Five
mutations led to amino acid changes, mostly yielding
conserved mutations of V29A (valine to alanine) and
H130R (histidine to arginine). Zhang et al. [42] reported
variants of BARF1 gene on EBV cell lines from EBVassociated T/NK-cell lymphoma showing change of G to
A at the position of 165554, change of T to C at
165589, and change of T to C at 165545. Only nucleotide mutation on 165589 (T to C) was similar to most
of the sequences in our isolates. We did not find any
isolate exhibiting mutation on other two nucleotides
identified by that study.

patients. No difference found in anti-BARF1 response between wild-type and variant BARF1 NPC patients (Mann-Whitney U test p = 0.850).

Analysis of BARF1 gene in NPC and non-NPC EBVrelated disorders showed a significant correlation
between variant BARF1 and NPC susceptibility (p <
0.001). Interestingly, the Dutch-Caucasian NPC case
(named NPC-56-NL in figure 1) also revealed a mutated
BARF1 sequence. In further analysis difference in mutation frequency showed significant difference between
NPC and European non-NPC group in particular the
existence of 2 (p < 0.001) and 3-4 codon mutations (p =
0.030). However, no difference was demonstrated
between NPC and regional EBV isolates in spontaneous
LCL cultured directly from the arm of healthy Indonesian EBV carriers (p = 0.074). This indicates that mutant
BARF1 EBV is prevalent in the endemic NPC population in Indonesia. Furthermore, BARF1 variants with 2
amino acid changes (V29A and H130R) most commonly
detected in EBV isolates from the NPC group which
indicates this to be the dominant strain in Indonesian
NPC. The similarity to EBV strains found in healthy
Indonesian individuals supports the view that this represents a geographic-associated distribution of EBV variants rather than a specific oncogenic strain. Moreover,
the EBV-positive NPC cell line C666-1 obtained from a
Chinese NPC case [43] and NPC tumor line C17 of European origin [44] were in the same phylogenetic branch
with EBV genome prototype B95-8. Another NPC
tumor line derived from North-African origin, C15 [44],
even though demonstrating the V29A codon conversion,

was also separated from most of the Indonesian NPC
samples. Therefore, grouping most Indonesian NPC isolates apart from these NPC lines, as well as Chinese
NPC prototype GD1, indicates that Indonesian NPC
evolved independently from NPC strains from different
geographic origins.
Several studies on LMP1 genetic variation argued that
the genetic diversity in LMP1 gene may lead to potential
immune evasion of infected host cells [45-47]. Another
study showed a greater oncogenic potential of LMP1
variants with a 30 bp C-terminal deletions [24]. The
overall conserved character of the BARF1 gene suggests
the importance of BARF1 function for virus-driven
immortalization and escape strategies in an epithelial
context. This is in line with the low variability of other
lytic cycle proteins, like the viral IL10 encoded in
BCRF1 [48] and the major envelope protein gp350/220
encoded in BLLF1 [49]. The limited overall sequence
diverged at the protein level in different EBV isolates
suggests BARF1 to play an important role in epithelial
persistence during natural viral infection in man.
The functional consequence of any mutation in
BARF1 gene presented in this study is not known yet.
Probably these will be minimal because the mutations
are rather conserved. Detailed functional analysis of
BARF1 protein is now underway. Our preliminary data
indicate that the Indonesian variant BARF1 (V29A and
H130R) is rapidly secreted from human epithelial cells,

Hutajulu et al. Infectious Agents and Cancer 2010, 5:16
http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/5/1/16

has a stable hexameric structure and binds M-CSF
(CSF-1) with high affinity (Hoebe et al., unpublished
data). Therefore a contribution of the observed amino
acid substitutions to altered protein functions and oncogenesis is considered unlikely, but this remains to be
determined in further studies.
Our ongoing studies indicate that the natural hexameric BARF1 is a protein of low immunogenicity relative to other EBV proteins and largely escapes humoral
immunity. However, when present, anti-BARF1 antibody
responses are formed irrespective of the sequence of the
endogenous BARF1 in a particular patient. This argues
against major influences in the tertiary structure
imposed by the observed mutations and is in line with
the conserved characteristics of the amino acid substitutions. Further studies are needed to reveal potential
subtle influences of BARF1 sequence variation on its
oncogenic or pathogenic properties that might predispose to NPC development.
EBV type 1 and type 2 differ in geographic distributions and among patient populations. We found that
nearly 100% of our subjects contain EBV type 1, either
from Asian (Indonesian) or European background. It
has been recorded that EBV type 1 is predominated in
Asia NPC (86.5-95.0%), while EBV type 2 is rarely
detected (4.0-13.5%) [24,25,50]. Our NPC samples
showed even less EBV type 2 and in a form of mixed
type (1.7%). We did not find an association between
EBNA-2 subtypes and BARF1 sequence variation.
Quantitative analysis of EBV DNA levels in brushing
in the NPC group indicated no trend or differrence
when having a BARF1 variant. In term of antibody
response against EBV, all serology assays assessing the
abundance or diversity of antibody responses to EBV
latent or lytic antigens revealed no significant differences
relating to the presence of BARF1 mutations.

Conclusion
The present study revealed that Indonesian NPC-derived
EBV strains exhibit BARF1 genetic variation relative to
the B95-8 prototype which may contribute to a biological role for BARF1 in NPC development. In term of
EBV genotype, viral load, and antibody reactivity to EBV
there was no correlation between presence of single or
multiple mutation(s) or none, suggesting no effect of
BARF1 mutation of the biological markers associating
with EBV carcinogenesis in NPC. The silent or conserved nature of most mutations and comparison to
indirect disease markers suggests these variations are
determined by the geographical prevalence and have
minor biological effects on NPC development. The evolutionary conservation of BARF1 sequence and structure

points to an important role for BARF1 protein in EBV
biology.

Materials and methods
Patients and controls

Fifty-five NPC patients were recruited from Dr. Sardjito
Teaching Hospital, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. NPC diagnosis was based on pathological assessment tumor biopsy specimens based on WHO
criteria, as detailed before [6,51]. All cases were in
advanced stages. Approval of the local medical ethical
committee was obtained. We also included 1 NPC
patient identified at VU University Medical Center,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
As controls, whole blood or tumor tissue of other
EBV-related diseases (n = 15) were collected. This nonNPC group consisted of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) (n = 7), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (n = 4), Burkitt’s lymphoma (n = 1),
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1), infectious mononucleosis (n = 1), and gastric cancer (n = 1). All non-NPC
EBV-related patients were Caucasians. In order to define
BARF1 variation in the general population, 5 spontaneous LCLs established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy EBV-seropositive individuals
from Indonesian background, were also included. These
spontaneous LCL lines were obtained by culturing fresh
blood B-lymphocytes in the presence of 1 mM cyclosporine-A. NPC xenograft samples C15 and C17 were a
gift from Dr. Pierre Busson (Inst. Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France) [44]. EBV positive cell lines B95-8 and JY
(EBV-1 prototype), Jijoye (EBV-2 prototype) and spontaneous LCLs were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) and the EBV
positive NPC cell line C666-1 [43] was cultured in
DMEM/Ham’s F12 medium, all with penicillin (100 IU/
ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serumin a CO2 incubator at 37°C.
Biological samples

Genomic DNA from NPC patients was obtained from
nasopharyngeal brushings performed by experienced
Ear, Nose, and Throat specialists. In all cases, the nasopharyngeal (NP) brush sample was taken prior to the
biopsy in patients with suspected NPC, and both were
sampled from the same site, as defined by nasendoscopy, exactly as described before [10]. In total, 56 NP
brush samples were obtained from patients with subsequently biopsy-proven NPC. Genomic DNA from other
non-NPC EBV-related patients were obtained either
from formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from
archival cases or from peripheral blood [9,52].

DNA extraction

EBV DNA was isolated from 1 ml of lysed brushings,
blood or tissue samples by silica-based extraction
[9,10,53]. Nucleic acids were eluted in 100 μl of which 5
μl was used in subsequent DNA amplification assays.
All reagents for nucleic acid isolation were obtained
from BioMerieux (Boxtel, The Netherlands).
DNA sequencing

Primer sequences were derived from the B95-8 prototype sequence [GeneBank accession No. V01555]. We
designed two pairs of primers for sequence analysis of
BARF1 in a double PCR procedure. The outer sequences
were BARF1-F1 (forward): 5′-TCCTCACAAACACAGAATCTG-3′ (165364-165384) and BARF1-R4
(reverse): 5′-ACGAGTCGCGAGGCTATC-3′ (166229166246) amplified the full 882 bp BARF1 sequence in a
first PCR step and the the inner primers BARF1-F6 (forward): 5′-GAGTGGCCTTTCAGGGGCTTC-3′ (165711165734) and BARF1-R5 (reverse): 5′-GTGGCCTT
TCAGGGGCTTC-3′ (165845-165866) combined with
F1 and R4 were subsequently used for generating two
PCR amplicons with an overlap of 155 basepairs. BARF1
amplification was performed in a final volume of 25 μl
of a master mix sample solution containing 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase,
and 10 pmol each of forward and reverse primers. The
EBV B95-8 transformed LCL, JY, was used as positive
control. The cycling parameters were 94°C for 5 min, 45
cycles of 94°C for 1 min, followed by 54°C for 1 min;
72°C for 1 min; and a 7 min hold at 72°C. After amplification, the PCR products were purified using QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and 2
μl DNA was used for sequencing. PCR direct sequencing of BARF1 was carried out using BigDye Terminator
version 3.1. (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
with 2 μl of each sample and 2 pmol of each of the corresponding primers. Each reaction was analysed on ABI
PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and
partly by external commercial party (Baseclear, Leiden,
The Netherlands). Data were assembled and edited
using Chromas Lite software (Technelysium Pty Ltd).
The acquired BARF1 sequence then was aligned and
compared to the combined Raji and B95-8 prototype as
the wild type of EBV genome in BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information: NCBI; http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
Phylogenetic analysis

To analyse the phylogenetic relationship within the EBV
sequence samples, the BARF1 sequence was aligned
from B95-8, GD1 [Genbank No. AY961628], AG876
[Genbank No. NC009334], NPC lines and all BARF1
variants. The sequences were aligned and the distances

Page 10 of 12

between each sample were determined with the ClustalW home page. A phylogenetic tree was assembled
from these matrices by the neighbor-joining method
using the Phylogenetic Tree Printer (Phylodendron:
http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/treeapp/).
EBV typing

Definition of EBV type 1 or type 2 was determined by
nested-PCR [13,40]. The first PCR reaction amplified a
common region of EBNA-2 followed by two separate
nested reactions amplifying distinctive regions. DNA
was amplified in 25 μl reactions containing 1.5 mM
MgCl2, gelatin 0.001%, 0.3 μM of each primer, 1 U of
Taq Platinum DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and 1 μl of
first reaction for nested-PCR. Cycling conditions: First
reaction: 94°C 2 min, 35 cycles of 94°C 1 min, 52°C 90
sec,72°C 4 min, followed by 72°C for 10 min. Nested
reaction: 94°C, 2 min, 35 cycles of 94°C 30 sec, 52°C 1
min, 72°C 2 min, followed by 72°C for 10 min. The
EBV-positive JY and Jijoye were used as positive control
for type 1 and type 2 PCR assays, respectively. PCR
reactions were performed at least twice, in a 9800 Fast
Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems). After PCR assay,
the amplified products were subjected to electrophoresis
in 2% agarose gel (Sigma), stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultra violet illumination. The
amplicons of EBV type 1 and type 2 were 250 bp and
300 bp in length, respectively.
EBV DNA load quantification by quantitative real-time
PCR

The EBV DNA load in brushings was determined by a
quantitative LightCycler (LC) real-time PCR that targets
a highly conserved 213-bp region of EBNA-1 [54]. The
primers used in this assay were QP1 and QP2, and the
fluorigenic internal hybridization probes were EBNA
LCN and EBNA FLN (TIB MolBiol, Berlin, Germany).
Real-time PCR reagents were obtained from Roche
Diagnostics (Almere, The Netherlands). Ten fold dilutions of spectrophotometrically quantified plasmid DNA
containing the EBNA-1 target sequence were used to
create a standard curve. PCR runs were conducted in a
mixture of 20 μl containing 20 pmol of each primer, 4
pmol of each probe, 2 μl of LightCycler Fast Start DNA
master hybridization probe reaction mixture, 4 mM
MgCl2, and 5 μl of plasmid DNA or clinical specimen
DNA. Amplification was conducted for 45 cycles of 10
sec at 95°C, 10 sec at 55°C, and 10 sec at 72°C. Then
PCR samples were cooled to 40°C.
EBV serology

In all NPC patients and controls EBV specific IgA reactivity was quantitatively assessed by a synthetic peptide
based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for

Hutajulu et al. Infectious Agents and Cancer 2010, 5:16
http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/5/1/16

immunodominant epitopes derived from EBNA-1 and
VCA-p18 (BFRF3) [51]. IgG seroreactivity against EBV
was assessed by immunoblotting by using the nuclear
fraction of HH514.c16 cells, which were chemically
induced to express the viral early and capsid antigens.
Immunoblots were scored semiquantitatively from 1
(weakest) to 4 (strongest), with reference to several control samples and monoclonal antibodies analysed in parallel as described elsewhere [6].
IgG reactivity against BARF1 was studied by ELISA
using sera of EBV negative and EBV positive healthy
donors as well as NPC patients. The antigen for ELISA
consisted of affinity chromatography-purified native hexameric NPC-derived BARF1 protein expressed in human
HEK293 cells (Hoebe et al., manuscript submitted). In
short, 10 μg/ml BARF1 protein was coated in 0.05 M
Na2 CO3 pH 9.6 overnight at 4°C. Serum dilution and
incubation conditions were standardized as described
before [51].
Statistical Analysis

Chi-square test and Fischer’s exact test were performed
to analyse the frequency of mutation in NPC cases,
non-NPC EBV-related diseases and healthy individuals.
Differences between diagnostic parameters and sequence
variations were tested using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) (EBV DNA load) and Mann-Whitney U-test
(serology). Computations were done using the statistical
software SPSS version 15.0.
