Abstract
Background: Olfactory receptors (ORs) are the largest gene family in the human genome.
Although they are expected to be expressed specifically in olfactory tissues, some ectopic
expression has been reported, with special emphasis on sperm and testis. The present study
systematically explores the expression patterns of OR genes in a large number of tissues and
assesses the potential functional implication of such ectopic expression.
Results: We analyzed the expression of hundreds of human and mouse OR transcripts, via EST
and microarray data, in several dozens of human and mouse tissues. Different tissues had specific,
relatively small OR gene subsets which had particularly high expression levels. In testis, average
expression was not particularly high, and very few highly expressed genes were found, none
corresponding to ORs previously implicated in sperm chemotaxis. Higher expression levels were
more common for genes with a non-OR genomic neighbor. Importantly, no correlation in
expression levels was detected for human-mouse orthologous pairs. Also, no significant difference
in expression levels was seen between intact and pseudogenized ORs, except for the pseudogenes
of subfamily 7E which has undergone a human-specific expansion.
Conclusion: The OR superfamily as a whole, show widespread, locus-dependent and
heterogeneous expression, in agreement with a neutral or near neutral evolutionary model for
transcription control. These results cannot reject the possibility that small OR subsets might play
functional roles in different tissues, however considerable care should be exerted when offering a
functional interpretation for ectopic OR expression based only on transcription information.

Background
Olfaction, the sense of smell, is mediated by a very large
family of olfactory receptors (ORs), whose chemical interaction with a multitude of odorant ligands initiates a cascade of signal transduction events leading to smell

perception [1-4]. OR proteins participate also in guiding
olfactory sensory neurons axons to their glomerular targets [5], and have been proposed to be involved in the regulation of their own expression [6,7].

The publication of the complete human genome
sequence, as well as that of other mammals such as
mouse, dog and chimpanzee, allowed the identification
of entire OR repertoires in those species via computational data-mining. Currently, 853 human OR genes are
known in the human genome [8], 1490 in the mouse
genome [9,10], 1493 in the rat genome [11], 971 in the
dog genome [12,13] and 1091 ORs in chimpanzee [14].
These are represented in the Human Olfactory Receptor
Exploratorium Database (HORDE) and in the Olfactory
Receptor DataBase (ORDB) [15]. In addition to this massive information that has been obtained by scrutinizing
genome sequence repositories, several publications have
provided information on transcription of OR genes in different tissues and species. In mouse, olfactory epithelial
ESTs have been sequenced for more than 400 OR genes
[16] and a custom mouse OR microarray was used to
examine the expression levels of more than 800 genes in
olfactory epithelium [17]. In contrast, human OR expression has been investigated for only a small number of
genes, as exemplified by the demonstration of transcripts
for genes in an OR cluster on human chromosome 17
[18].

ectopically in placenta, brain, peripheral nervous system,
colon and fetal liver [41-45]. Because of their broad pattern of tissue expression during development and in adult
life, ORs have been proposed to play a role in cell-cell recognition [46]. Despite such reports regarding the potential functions of ectopically expressed ORs, this
phenomenon is far from being fully understood and
requires further systematic investigation.

ORs are expected to be specifically expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where their expression is also highly regulated by mechanisms which allow each sensory neuron
to express a single allele of a single OR gene [19-21]. OR
genes are also expressed in the olfactory bulb, where they
are specifically localized to the nerve and glomerular layers, potentially related to the targeting of the sensory
axons [22,23]. In the present paper we address the question to which degree OR genes are expressed in non-olfactory tissues. We use the term "ectopic" defined as "a
biological event or process that occurs in an abnormal
location or position within the body" [24]. We note that
the term has also been used to describe abnormal expression in malignant tumors, not studied here.

Results

Here we report the first systematic global analysis of spatial OR expression patterns in human and mouse. We aim
to obtain transcriptional evidence for numerous ORs in a
large number of tissues, so as to shed further light on the
possible factors influencing OR ectopic expression. To this
end, we have collected mouse and human transcriptome
information from various sources, including public
domain and Celera ESTs, as well as genome-wide microarray data [47]. We found substantial expression in several
dozens human and mouse tissues, but no indications for
unusually high expression in testis. Our results support a
neutral or near neutral evolution model for OR transcription control, whereby functionality is rendered less likely.
All the results are fully available through HORDE [48].

Collection of OR transcription data
Our first aim was to obtain evidence of transcription for
human and mouse OR genes. We examined expression
data from a multitude of sources, including cDNAs and
mRNAs information as well as microarray data [47]. The
source of microarray data is the GeneAtlas2 project, which
provides whole genome expression patterns in dozens of
human and mouse tissues [47].

Most of the early reports about ectopic OR expression
have been related to testis and germ cells, where several
dozens of human and mouse ORs have been shown to be
transcribed [25-32]. These results have led to the hypothesis that at least some ORs are involved in mammalian
sperm chemotaxis. Evidence for the involvement of
human hOR17-4 (OR1D2) [30,33] and mouse MOR26713 (orthologous to human OR10J5) [34] in sperm chemotaxis has been provided. Another hypothesis proposed
that ORs linked to the major histocompatibility complex
locus and expressed in testis are implicated in olfactiondriven mate choice [35].

A search through the GeneAtlas2 data identified (after filtration on potentially cross-reacting probesets) a total of
293 probesets matching 273 human ORs, and 397
probesets matching 371 mouse ORs. Probesets were then
tested for being positively expressed applying the CrossGene Error Model on the full microarray data. We identified 206 human and 216 mouse OR genes as expressed in
at least one tissue. This analysis included 61 human and
48 mouse tissues, among them mouse olfactory epithelium, mouse vomeronasal organ, and human and mouse
olfactory bulb and testis. Every one of these tissues
showed positive expression of at least one OR gene. Further information regarding expression of 221 human ORs
and 587 mouse ORs was obtained from ESTs and mRNAs.
This information was supported by 867 human transcripts in 78 tissues and 1965 mouse transcripts in 50 tissues.

Some human ORs were also shown to be expressed in
tongue [36,37], erythroid cells [38] and prostate [39,40].
Some murine ORs have been shown to be expressed

Altogether, we present evidence for the expression of 371
human ORs and 697 mouse ORs (see Additional file 1),
which represent approximately 45% of both the human

and mouse repertoires. Gene expression does not appear
to be biased relative to particular genomic OR clusters
(Figure 1), suggesting that an appreciable proportion of
the entire genomic repertoire is likely to be transcribed.
Ectopic expression of OR genes in non-olfactory tissues
We examined the GeneAtlas2 data using a quantile-based
scale [49] for all the expression values in the microarray.
Ectopic OR gene expression was noticeable in a large
diversity of non-olfactory tissues. We noted that in every
tissue a group of ORs showed high expression level even
when compared to all the genes included on the microarrays. The highest OR expression was observed in nonolfactory tissues, and these differed between human and
mouse. In human, atrioventricular node, skin and uterus
showed the highest quantile-based expression levels,
while in the mouse such tissues were thyroid and salivary
gland (Figure 2). While some ORs showed a relatively
high specificity to particular tissues, others exhibited
expression in a number of tissues (midrange genes [49])
and a few ORs had high quantile values in all or most tissues, i.e. behaved as housekeeping genes (Figure 2A,B and
Figure 3). We examined the matrices of expression again
after filtering out 36 human and 12 mouse OR-related
probesets, whose specificity or sensitivity was less than 1.
The general picture remained as before (see Additional file
2).

We asked whether the distribution of OR expression
intensities was different in functionally implicated tissues
as compared to other tissues. Generally, the distributions
were rather similar for the two classes (Figure 2C,D). The
functionally implicated tissues (olfactory epithelium and
bulb, as well as testis) did not display an unusual distribution, nor did they show an unusually high number of
highly expressed genes. The number of highly expressed
ORs in testis was smaller than in olfactory epithelium and
bulb (Figure 2C,D, red colors). Interestingly, these highly
expressed ORs are not biased toward a genomic location
or family affiliation [50]. In addition, highly expressed
human and mouse ORs in the different tissues were not
orthologous. More functionally related expression patterns were observed for a set of non-receptor genes with an
established olfactory function (Figure 2E,F). Note that
Olfactory Marker Protein (OMP) was expressed in mouse
but not in human olfactory bulb. This might be the result
of a poor probeset design since human OMP is not
expressed in any tissue.
Across-tissue patterns of expression for individual OR
genes were eclectic, differing widely from one gene to
another (Figure 2A,B). A hierarchical clustering analysis
was applied to 108 human and 141 mouse differentially
expressed ORs, as determined using an ANOVA test
applied to the GeneAtlas2 microarray data (see Additional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/121

file 3). The human OR gene tree ramified into two principal branches, whose major expression divergence was
observed in the highly expressing tissues. In mouse, no
significant clustering was observed. Principal component
analysis also could not separate the ORs expression profiles into distinct groups (data not shown).
Quantification of ectopic expression
To quantify ectopic expression, we ranked for each OR
gene the ectopic tissues according to their expression level
(Figure 4A,B), then for each ranked position we calculated
the mean expression intensity and the entropy, which
reflects the diversity of tissues in the given position (Figure
4C,D). The entropy was normalized to range from 0 to 1,
where 0 indicates a single tissue population and 1 a population of all tissues. For OR genes, the entropy in most
ranked positions was between 0.7 and 0.8, indicating that
each position is populated with a great variety of tissues
and that none of the tissues dominated the high expression positions, as would have been expected if ORs had a
specific function in such tissues. Reanalyzing the data
including olfactory tissues did not change the entropy values, an indication for the low level of ORs expression in
the olfactory epithelium.

The product of the entropy and the expression intensity at
each position was calculated and the mean of all products
defined as the ectopic expression index, theoretically ranging from 0 (no ectopic expression) to 10 (all the examined
genes are ubiquitously expressed and all the tissues are
represented in every ranked position). The ectopic expression index was found to be 1.6 for human ORs and 1.3 for
mouse ORs. Interestingly, a similar level of ectopic expression was observed in groups of brain specific genes (see
Additional file 4) and spermatogenesis-related genes (see
Additional file 5). In these gene groups, the entropy in
most ectopic ranked tissue positions was above 0.7 and
the ectopic expression index ranged from 1.1 and 1.5 for
human and mouse brain specific genes respectively, to
respectively 1.5 and 1.4 for spermatogenesis-related genes
in human and mouse.
Comparison with other microarray expression
experiments
Recently, the results of a custom-made microarray, which
includes all mouse OR genes hybridized to olfactory epithelium and 6 additional tissues (vomeronasal organ,
lung, heart, testis, muscle and cerebellum) were published
in Zhang et al. [17]. An examination of the 397 OR genes
represented in both our analyzed experiment and that of
Zhang et al., using the same cutoff criteria, revealed a significant concordance. Thus, all 48 ORs that showed olfactory epithelial expression in our analysis were also highly
expressed in the results of Zhang et al. (see Additional file
6, p = 0.0001, chi-square test = 21).

show genes that are tissue specific (blue, left), midrange (yellow, middle) and ubiquitously expressed (red, right).

We further compared the results of the two experiments
by examining the correlation between expression profiles
of genes that were represented in the two microarrays (Figure 5). The distribution of the correlation values was
skewed towards positive values with a median of 0.17 and
a most probable value of 0.4, results that show a highly
significant deviation from randomness (Wilcoxon test, p
< 0.0001). Interestingly, the distribution obtained from
the correlation values of probesets extracted from the coding region versus the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the
same OR in Zhang et al. had a similar median (0.19),
although the most probable correlation value was found

to be higher: 0.6. We examined also correlations between
expression profiles of two probesets representing the same
OR gene in the GeneAtlas2 project. Only seven such
probeset pairs were found and the mean correlation value
between their expression profiles was 0.61 with a standard
deviation of 0.13. Reexamination of Zhang et al. data
revealed abundant ectopic expression not explicitly
reported because of the stringent cutoff they used for
defining differentially expressed genes.

functional tissue(s): olfactory bulb in A and olfactory bulb (left) and epithelium (right) in B. The rows were sorted according to

OR expression in sperm and testis
Because of the presumed OR function in sperm chemotaxis, we examined human and mouse OR genes reported
to be expressed in sperm and testis [26-31] and for which
we had expression data. Most of these ORs were probably
expressed in testis at levels below the noise-related detection threshold in these experiments (Figure 6A,B). In all
cases where higher than background expression was
detected, its level in testis was lower than in some other
tissue(s). Two ORs, the human gene OR1D2 and the nonorthologous mouse gene MOR267-13 (outlined in black
in Figure 6) have been the focus of more intense previous
scrutiny in terms of a potential role in sperm chemotaxis
towards the egg. Here, none of these genes showed their
highest level of expression in testis nor did they show
sperm/testis tissue specificity.

Expression of OR genes and pseudogenes
We asked whether all ORs had an equal probability of
being transcribed. For this purpose, we analyzed the ESTs
data set, assumed to constitute a random representation
of the transcribed OR repertoire. The distribution of ESTs
per OR in human intact and pseudogenized genes
(excluding pseudogenes belonging to subfamily 7E) was
found to be in agreement with a Poisson distribution
within statistical error (Figure 7A,B), as expected in case of
equal transcription probability. A similar result was
obtained for mouse ORs (Figure 7D). These results are
somewhat tenuous because they could be affected by varying depth of EST sampling in different tissues. Reanalyzing the distributions based only on spliced ESTs did not
change the agreement to Poisson distributions for intact
and pseudogenized genes (excluding 7E members).
Importantly, there was no significant bias against pseudogene transcription both in human and in mouse nonolfactory tissues (Table 1).

smoothed applying a moving average every 2 points. The first two correlation groups were not significantly different according
to Wilcoxon test (p = 0.55), while these two differed from the third (Wilcoxon test, p < 0.0001).

One OR subfamily, 7E, shows an unusually high average
level of transcription, significantly different from the one
of other intact and pseudogene ORs according to the

Tukey-Kramer test (p < 0.05), (Table 1). Members of this
subfamily were the only OR group for which the EST coverage differed significantly from a Poisson distribution

genes for which evidence of transcription was found based only on spliced ESTs was 9% for intact, 8% for pseudogenized human ORs,

genes and pseudogenes excluding 7E members, while coverage was 0.17 for the 7E subfamily, significantly different from that of the
other groups.

(Figure 7B). In this skewed distribution, most 7E genes
were under-expressed, while four genes, all belonging to
one of the two 7E phylogenetic clades [51] were highly
overexpressed. Most additional genes represented by ESTs
belonged to the same over-expressed phylogenetic clade.
Lack of correlation in orthologous OR expression profiles
Out of 122 orthologous pairs of OR genes as previously
defined [13], 64 OR pairs were found to be represented in
both the human and mouse GeneAtlas2 microarrays [47].
This allowed us to examine the relationship between their
expression profiles in the 20 normal tissues shared by the
reported human and mouse data (Figure 8A). Pearson
correlations between the expression profiles of each pair
were normally distributed around a mean of zero, suggesting that no significant correlation existed between the
orthologous expression profiles. A nearly identical distribution was seen for random pairs. In addition, the Pearson correlations were independent of the protein
sequence divergence between orthologs (Figure 8B). No
significant correlation was observed when human and
mouse orthologs were analyzed for each tissue separately
(not shown), including the functionally implicated olfactory bulb and testis where ortholog correlation is more
likely to be observed [52]. In a control test, we compared
a set of all 9616 human-mouse orthologous genes present
on the arrays, as well as 64 human-mouse orthologous
pairs of genes participating in spermatogenesis. The distribution for the former had a mean of 0.15, in agreement
with previous reports comparing orthologs using the
same platform and analysis methods [52,53] and significantly different from the random pairs distribution (t-test,
p < 10-16). For the spermatogenesis related genes the mean
was 0.38 (Figure 8A) with a positive Pearson correlation
in testis (r = 0.65, p < 10-16). It is important to note that
all the experiments compared here were performed in the
same laboratory using the same platform and analysis
methods, thus variations in experimental parameters
between species could not account for the observed lack
of correlation between OR orthologs.
Relationship between OR expression and genomic
neighborhood
We examined the possibility that OR gene expression is
related to genomic location, and potentially influenced by
the transcription of non-OR neighboring genes, namely
genes not belonging to the OR superfamily and located at
a maximum distance of 0.5 M from an OR. We found that
98 out of 165 human ORs (59%) represented by at least
one EST whose source was non-olfactory tissues, have a
non-OR neighbor. This is in contrast to 241 out of 684
genes (35%) for ORs not observed to be ectopically
expressed (p < 0.0001, chi-square test = 36). In mouse, a
similar but weaker trend was found: 51% (80 out of 156
genes) of the ectopically expressed ORs had a non-OR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/121

genomic neighbor while the fraction was 42% (317 out of
749 genes) for ORs not observed to be ectopically
expressed (p= 0.04, chi-square test = 4.21).

Discussion
Wide range of ectopic OR transcription
Motivated by the need to provide evidence of OR transcription, we searched through numerous databases for
transcription evidence and successfully provided such
information for 371 human OR genes. Since the nominal
expression site of OR genes, namely olfactory epithelium,
is practically not represented in transcript databases, most
of the expression evidence presented here originates from
ectopic tissues. Our results generally indicate that hundreds of OR genes have active promoters capable of directing transcription in diverse cellular contexts. As the
samples explored are basically unbiased, it is suggested
that our results are representative of the entire olfactory
receptor gene repertoire.

It could be argued that the ectopic OR expression is an
artifact of microarray experiments. Indeed, microarray
experiments are known to be "noisy" [54], requiring independent experimental validation. Such validation is presently underway for selected OR genes that show unique
patterns of expression, and preliminary results show adequate concordance for two genes in terms of tissue-average expression levels, though not yet for individual tissue
levels. However, the essence of the presently reported
results, namely the widespread occurrence of OR expression in ectopic tissues is amply supported by previous
reports showing ectopic OR transcription by PCR and
sequencing methods [25,29,36,37,55]. The identification
of numerous OR-related ESTs in diverse tissue origins provides further corroboration. Moreover, since we carefully
selected the OR probesets to avoid possible cross-reaction
between similar ORs, the observed expression levels could
not be a result of summation over numerous genes, each
expressed in negligible amounts. In fact, some of the OR
genes were found to be highly expressed well above the
background level.
Ectopic expression is a universal phenomenon that
extends beyond the OR gene superfamily. Here, we corroborate this phenomenon for two additional gene
groups, brain specific and spermatogenesis-related genes.
Ectopic expression has been also observed previously at
the protein level in enzymes and neurotransmitters and it
has been suggested to be widespread in the cells of multicellular organisms [56].
Comparison between the olfactory epithelium and other
tissues
Our findings do not indicate unusually high OR expression levels in olfactory epithelium relative to other tissues.

Figure 7
Distribution of EST coverage for OR genes
Distribution of EST coverage for OR genes. Bars show observed distributions for ESTs (spliced and non-spliced) coverage in non- olfactory tissues. The ESTs utilized for the distributions calculation were from normal tissues, non-subtracted and
non-normalized libraries. Distributions for A. human intact ORs, B. human 7E subfamily ORs, C. human pseudogenes (excluding 7E subfamily members), D. mouse ORs (intact and pseudogenes). Solid lines are computed Poisson distributions based on
the average value of ESTs per OR gene. The fit to the expected Poisson distributions was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The resulting p-values are: 0.998 for A, 0.003 for B, 0.401 for C and 0.591 for D.

This expression is specific for mature olfactory sensory
neurons and not for other cell types in the olfactory epithelium, as previously reported [57,58]. At face value,
such result could be interpreted as contradicting a function for OR genes in olfactory epithelium. However, as
each OR gene is expressed only in approximately 0.1% of
the sensory neurons, OR transcripts are diluted in the total
olfactory tissue mRNA.
We compared the results of our analyses to the ones of an
expression custom-made microarray published by Zhang
et al. [17]. We identified in the GeneAtlas2 microarray
397 mouse unique OR-related probesets representing 371
genes, we could not detect expression in any tissue for 181
probesets (155 genes), from the remaining 216 OR genes,
117 were not found to be expressed in the olfactory epi-

thelium and only 32 were expressed in the five upper
quantiles. In contrast to our results, they found a higher
fraction of OR genes that surpass the threshold and are
called "enriched in the olfactory epithelium" as compared
to fraction of expressed in the olfactory epithelium as
emerging from the data analyzed here. Su et al. [47] used
5 Âµg of cRNA in the microarray hybridization experiments, while Zhang et al. used 70 Âµg. This difference is a
possible explanation as to why we fail to identify olfactory
epithelium-specific OR transcription.
The median correlation coefficient between the two experiments is in line with those in other reports, ranging from
0.2 to 0.4 in comparisons among datasets acquired for
identical RNA samples but in different laboratories and
using different experimental and analysis protocols [54].

Other factors which may account for the differences in the
two experiments include the use of mRNA from different
mouse strains, differences in probeset designs and differences in data processing software. The influence of the
probeset design is critical, as learned from comparisons of
different results in the same report (Zhang et al.).
OR genes in testis
It is widely believed that the main function of OR proteins
is in mediating olfaction within the chemosensory organ.
In parallel, reports published ever since the discovery of
OR genes have proposed an additional OR function,
namely as mediators of sperm chemotaxis. In the past decade, considerable evidence has accumulated in support
for this hypothesis [25-31], but the concept has also been
disputed [59]. The present study, which addresses the
expression of a large number of OR genes in olfactory tissues as well as in other tissues, including testis, could help
to shed light on this issue. One of the important questions
is which of the hundreds of OR genes is actually involved
in sperm chemotaxis, as such specific function is unlikely
to be mediated by the entire OR repertoire. Previous functional studies have focused on two OR genes: the human
OR1D2 (hOR17-4) [33] and a non-orthologous mouse
gene, MOR267-13 (MOR23) [34]. For MOR267-13 it was
stated that it is expressed at low level in testis [34], this is
also supported by our results. We found that also OR1D2
is expressed at low level in testis. Our results further show
that these two specific ORs have a higher expression in
other tissues. Conversely, other ORs are highly expressed
in testis but have not been invoked so far as chemotaxis
mediators. It should be noted, however, that genes could
function in an ectopic tissue (e.g. sperm) even if they are
expressed at higher level in another tissue. The notion that
a gene must be expressed at the highest level in the tissue
in which it is functional is plausible but exceptions may
exist.
OR ectopic expression may be selectively neutral
In addition to a proposed role in sperm chemotaxis, ORs
have been proposed specific roles in numerous other tissues, mostly based on the mere presence of OR transcript(s). This includes cell-cell recognition and organ
construction during development [37,41,45,46], taste
perception [36], chemical detection of exogenous or
endogenous ligands in the cerebral cortex [45] and additional functions [40,43,44]. Does OR expression in a
given ectopic tissue indicate specific functionality? An
alternative scenario would be that ectopic OR transcription is predominantly the result of neutral or nearly neutral mechanisms, e.g. small DNA sequence changes in
regulatory regions, fixed in the population by random
drift and not necessarily related to function or fitness
[52,60,61].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/121

A claim that ectopic OR expression may be in part governed by neutral changes is supported by several findings.
First, the divergence in the expression patterns of humanmouse orthologous OR pairs in ectopic tissues is similar
to that of randomly selected pairs. This observation generalizes a previously reported specific case for OR51E2,
which was found to be over-expressed in human prostate
[39,40], although minor expression could be detected
also in brain. Its mouse ortholog was found predominantly in brain, and its rat ortholog in brain and liver [43].
Second, OR transcription was found here to be unbiased
with respect to any particular OR subgroup in ectopic tissues (except for the human 7E subfamily members, see
below), as indicated by the approximate fit to a Poisson
distribution. We note, though, that other studies have
reported up to 300-fold difference in the levels of ORs
transcription in mouse olfactory epithelium [5,16]. Last,
OR pseudogenes were found here to be expressed in
ectopic tissues at similar levels to those of intact genes. In
contrast, in olfactory epithelium, where chemosensory
functionality is expected, OR pseudogenes were found to
be significantly less expressed than intact genes [16]. In
spite of this, our results can neither exclude nor confirm
the possibility that some ORs do have a function in
ectopic tissues, as the functionally-related transcription
might be concealed within the relatively noisy microarray
data.
The relative weight of neutral evolution and purifying
selection in shaping gene expression changes is controversial. Based on the expression data that have accumulated
lately, a predominantly neutral model of evolution for
gene expression has been proposed [52,60,61]. On the
other hand, others [62] have recently indicated the parallel importance of selective constraints. The neutral model
was previously supported by a lack of correlation between
gene expression profiles and gene sequence divergence
[52], a general observation that is in line with our own
results. Also, similar rates of divergence in gene expression
levels between humans and chimpanzees were found for
intact and expressed pseudogenes [60], again echoing the
results reported here.
Recently, ectopic expression and its evolutionary significance have been reviewed [56]. The authors propose that
transcription regulation is leaky due to the need to
decondense chromatin and the limited number of transcription factors in the cell. They suggest that ectopic
expression, which appears randomly, may have evolutionary potential and provide an opportunity to develop
protein function diversification ("the marginal benefit
hypothesis"). The same might be true for OR genes, a
point that will have to be further explored.

pairs (dark gray/pink bars) and 64 mouse-human spermatogenesis related orthologous genes (light gray/blue bars). A significant
difference between the correlations values in the orthologous OR and spermatogenesis genes groups was supported by Wilcoxon test (p < 0.0001). B. Pearson's correlations between mouse-human orthologous OR pairs were plotted against the protein identity percent within each pair.

The 7E subfamily
The OR gene subfamily 7E has expanded extensively in
the primate lineage, composing ~10% of the human and
chimpanzee OR repertoires. In humans, all its members
but one are pseudogenes [51,63]. It was suggested that the
subfamily expansion occurred through a complex mechanism of large segmental duplications, and that the duplication unit included one 7E subfamily member from each
of the two phylogenetic clades of the subfamily [51]. Our
results suggest that one of these two genes had already a
disrupted promoter when the expansion started. The unusually high expression level of the second clade may be
the result of mutations enhancing expression. It is also
possible that highly expressed 7E members have some
potential function after all as previously suggested [51].
OR genomic neighborhood
Previous reports have shown that adjacent and nearby
genes show correlated expression patterns in yeast [64].
Human genes were shown not to be randomly distributed
in the genome; highly expressed genes and weakly
expressed genes tend to populate different chromosomal
domains [65,66]. It has been suggested that co-expressed
genes in eukaryotic genomes reflect the domain organization of chromatin [67]. We have noticed that ORs located
within the range of 0.5 M from non-OR genes have a
higher tendency to be expressed than others, hinting that
the genomic environment may partially influence OR
gene expression. This is further supported by the expression of an OR gene in erythroid cells, attributed to its
genomic location in the transcriptionally active chromatin domain of the extended Î²-globin gene cluster [38].

Conclusion
We reported on widespread ectopic OR expression.
Related observations have formed the basis for proposing
specific roles for ORs in non-olfactory tissues. We proposed an additional explanation for ectopic expression, a
neutral or near neutral model of evolution for at least part
of OR transcription regulation in non-olfactory tissues.
This is supported by the uniform overall transcription
level in most tissues, the heterogeneity in its patterns, the
expression level proportion similarity in OR intact and
disrupted genes and the total lack of correlation between
human and mouse orthologous ORs.

Methods
Identification of OR genes in GeneAtlas2 microarrays
Human OR probesets were identified based on genomic
location overlap between GeneAtlas2 targets and HORDE
annotation [48]. Mouse OR probeset identity was established using the UCSC genome annotation database table
knownToGnf1m.txt.gz [68], which connects between
probesets and GenBank accession numbers. Gene symbols and definitions were assigned to the accession

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/121

number using Ensembl annotations downloaded via EnsMart [69].
We validated the probesets annotation using BLAT [70]. A
probe was matched to an OR gene if it aligned in the correct orientation, with no more than one mismatch, and
did not align to any additional OR gene or to any other
gene from Ensemble all human/mouse transcripts library.
Following the GeneAnnot algorithm described in [71],
sensitivity and specificity scores were calculated for each
probeset. Sensitivity score describes the percentage of
probes in a probeset that match a gene and specificity
score denotes how many other genes match the probeset
and to how many probes within the probeset they match.
Probesets having sensitivity or specificity lower than 0.7
were excluded and not used on further analyses. After filtering the probesets we were left with representation for
273 human and 371 mouse ORs (293 human and 397
mouse probesets). Most remaining probesets were of high
quality, with both sensitivity and specificity scores of 1
(79% in human and 91 % in mouse), (see Additional file
7).
Scaling GeneAtlas2 expression level intensities
Expression data for human and mouse tissues were
obtained from GNF Symatlas [72]. The human and mouse
arrays data were supplied after applying the MAS5
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) algorithm and normalization using global median scaling [47]. Sixty one human
normal adult tissues and 48 mouse normal adult tissues
were selected for the analysis.

Log10 of the expression values were averaged for replicas
and were divided into 11 bins according to [49]. Intensities lower than log10200 for mouse and log10300 for
human were considered as the zero bin. The remaining
intensities were divided into 10 equal density quantiles.
Throughout this work quantile scaling was utilized, unless
otherwise stated.
Tissue specificity index calculation
A graded tissue specificity index, Ï, ranging from 0 (ubiquitously expressed) to 1 (one-tissue specific) was calculated as described in Yanai et al. [49].
GeneSpring analyses
Expression data was analyzed also applying GeneSpring
software. This was used for determining the number of
positively expressed genes, differentially expressed genes,
and clustering. Each expression value was divided by the
median of the microarray and the median of the probeset
across all tissues. Unexpressed probesets were filtered out
using the Cross-Gene Error Model. Differentially
expressed genes were determined by an ANOVA test, p-

value of 0.001. Under these conditions, 206 human and
216 mouse OR genes were found expressed, and 108
human and 141 mouse ORs were differentially expressed.
Hierarchical gene clustering (gene tree) and tissue clustering (condition tree) were performed for differentially
expressed ORs.
To verify that expression data from all the tissues have the
same distribution (normal), we calculated the distribution of the expression log values for each tissue and its
skewness parameter. Tissues with a skewness parameter
outside the range of average plus 2 standard deviations of
all skewness values were removed from further analyses.
The removed tissues were pancreas, brown fat and tongue
in mouse and cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion,
ovary and appendix in human.
Ectopic expression quantification
To quantify ectopic expression, we ranked for each OR
gene the ectopic tissues according to their expression level,
entropy and mean expression were then calculated for
each ranked position. The Shannon entropy (H) formula
[73] was utilized to measure the entropy:
T

H = ââ Pilog 2Pi
i =1

where Pi is the fraction of the tissue type i, and T is the
total number of tissues. The entropy was normalized
dividing by log2 T, to range from 0 to 1.
Choice of brain-specific and spermatogenesis gene groups
Brain specific genes were selected based on scientific literature. We search Pubmed [74] for papers including the
exact phrases "brain specific" or "brain-specific" in the title
or abstract. The list of genes was then manually extracted
and carefully curated by inspection and reading of the
title/abstract. Probesets/genes assignment was based on
the GNF organization annotation [75]. The final list
included 57 human brain specific genes and 50 mouse
brain specific genes. Human spermatogenesis related
genes were identified searching with the keyword "spermatogenesis" in GeneAtlas web site. Corresponding mouse
orthologs for the two groups were extracted from GeneCards [76].
Human mouse comparisons
Human-mouse OR orthologs identification was based on
a previous work, which identified human-mouse-dog
three way mutual best hits [13]. GeneCards was further
used to extract 9616 human-mouse orthologous pairs represented in the mouse and human microarrays. Random
pairs were selected from this list using the PERL rand function. Pearson correlations were calculated using the log10

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/121

expression values supplied by Su et al., since these values
are normally distributed.
ESTs and mRNA data mining and procedures
Data mining of ESTs and mRNA was performed using
UCSC genome browser annotation tables chr#_est.txt.gz
and chr#_mrna.txt.gz, (# represents the chromosome
number) [68]. We selected ESTs and mRNAs which were
aligned to ORs coding regions.

After curation (see below), ESTs and mRNAs that included
part of the UTR, were used as probes for extracting additional ESTs (in two data mining rounds). In addition,
spliced ESTs which were aligned upstream of the coding
region (up to 10 Kb) were collected. ESTs and mRNAs
annotations regarding tissue source and type (tumor or
normal) were extracted from GenBank and MEROPS [77].
Data mining from Celera Genomics [78] was performed
using all OR coding sequences as queries in a BLASTN
search against Full Invitrogen sequences (FIS) and 5' Invitrogen clones libraries. Hits with an e-value of less than
10-10 were downloaded to our computer. The final assignment of a particular Celera's cDNAs to a particular OR was
based on an alignment >97% over 500 bp.
ESTs and mRNA curation
ESTs were rechecked to represent OR genes by excluding
those whose genomic locations overlapped exons of the
non-OR subset from the UCSC known gene table [68].
Spliced ESTs were required to be transcribed from the
same strand as the OR. This criterion was not applied to
non-spliced ESTs, because their transcription strand is less
reliable since they lack splice junctions that verify the
strand. We applied a cutoff of maximum 500 bp length for
non coding exons and maximum distance of 100 Kb
between a non coding exon and the coding region. The
first criterion was based on previous knowledge about the
typical OR UTR structure [18,31] and was applied to avoid
genomic contamination, the second was applied to avoid
collection of chimeras (transcripts including very large
introns are suspected to be chimeras). Redundant information from ESTs that belong to the same clone was
removed. mRNAs which their GenBank definition
matched non-OR genes were manually removed from the
dataset.

The final dataset contained 867 human transcripts,
including 721 ESTs (spliced and non-spliced) and 146
mRNAs, from 78 tissues. These provided evidence for
transcription of 221 human ORs. In mouse we obtained
1860 ESTs and 105 mRNAs, from 50 tissues. Of these
1176 ESTs are the result of a single project [16]. Together
they provided transcription evidence for 587 mouse ORs.

ESTs distribution analysis
Poisson distributions were calculated using ESTs from the
first data mining round, as these constitute a true random
set. Also, we filtered out ESTs whose source was not normal adult tissue as well as ESTs from normalized or subtracted libraries. Kolmogorov-Sminorv tests were
performed at the web server [79] or using the Matlab6p5
application software.
