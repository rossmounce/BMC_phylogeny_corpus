Abstract
Background: Orchids are one of the most diversified angiosperms, but few genomic resources are available for
these non-model plants. In addition to the ecological significance, Phalaenopsis has been considered as an
economically important floriculture industry worldwide. We aimed to use massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing for
a global characterization of the Phalaenopsis transcriptome.
Results: To maximize sequence diversity, we pooled RNA from 10 samples of different tissues, various
developmental stages, and biotic- or abiotic-stressed plants. We obtained 206,960 expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
with an average read length of 228 bp. These reads were assembled into 8,233 contigs and 34,630 singletons. The
unigenes were searched against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) protein database. Based on sequence similarity with
known proteins, these analyses identified 22,234 different genes (E-value cutoff, e-7). Assembled sequences were
annotated with Gene Ontology, Gene Family and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways.
Among these annotations, over 780 unigenes encoding putative transcription factors were identified.
Conclusion: Pyrosequencing was effective in identifying a large set of unigenes from Phalaenopsis. The informative
EST dataset we developed constitutes a much-needed resource for discovery of genes involved in various
biological processes in Phalaenopsis and other orchid species. These transcribed sequences will narrow the gap
between study of model organisms with many genomic resources and species that are important for ecological
and evolutionary studies.

Background
The family of Orchidaceae is the largest family of flowering plants and the number of species may exceed
25,000 [1]. Like all other living organisms, present-day
orchids have evolved from ancestral forms as a result of
selection pressure and adaptation. They show a wide
diversity of epiphytic and terrestrial growth forms and
have successfully colonized almost every habitat on
earth. Factors promoting orchid species richness include
specific interaction between the orchid flower and

pollinator [2], sequential and rapid interplay between
drift and natural selection [3], obligate interaction with
mycorrhiza [4], and epiphytism which is true for most
of all orchids and probably two-thirds of the epiphytic
flora of the world.
The radiation of the orchid family has probably taken
place in a comparatively short period as compared with
that of most flowering plant families, which had already
started to diversify in the Mid-Cretaceous [5]. The time
of origin of orchids is in dispute, although Dressler suggests that they originated 80 to 40 million years ago
(Mya; late Cretaceous to late Eocene) [6]. Recently, the
origin of the Orchidaceae was dated with a fossil orchid
and its pollinator. The authors showed that the most
recent common ancestor of extant orchids lived in the
late Cretaceous (76-84 Mya) [7]. They also suggested
that Epidendroideae and Orchidoideae, two of the

largest orchid subfamilies, which together represent >
95% of living orchid species, began to diversify early in
the Tertiary (65 Mya) [7].
According to molecular phylogenetic studies, Orchidaceae comprise 5 subfamilies: Apostasioideae,
Cypripedioideae, Vanilloideae, Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae. The Apostasioideae is considered the sister
group to other orchids. Vanilloideae diverged just before
Cypripedioideae. Both subfamilies have relatively low
numbers of genera and species. Most of the taxonomic
diversity in orchids is in 2 recently expanded sistersubfamilies: Orchidoideae and especially Epidendroideae
[8,9]. Orchids are known for their diversity of specialized reproductive and ecological strategies. For successful reproduction, the production of labellum and
gynostemium (a fused structure of androecium and
gynoecium) to facilitate pollination is well documented
and the co-evolution of orchid flowers and pollinators is
well known [10,11]. In addition, the especially successful
evolutionary progress of orchids may be explained by
mature pollen grains packaged as pollinia, pollinationregulated ovary/ovule development, synchronized timing
of micro- and mega-gametogenesis for effective fertilization, and the release of thousands or millions of immature embryos (seeds without endosperm) in a mature
capsule [12]. However, despite their unique developmental reproductive biology, as well as specialized
pollination and ecological strategies, orchids remain
under-represented in molecular studies relative to other
species-rich plant families [13]. The reasons may be
associated with the large genome size, long life cycle,
and inefficient transformation system of orchids.
The genomic sequence resources currently available
for orchids are limited. Very recently, a sketch of the
Phalaenopsis orchid genome from sequencing the ends
of 2 bacterial artificial chromosome libraries of P. equestris was reported [14]. In addition, a number of studies
have developed expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
resources for orchids by using Sanger sequencing
[15-18]. Fewer than 12,000 ESTs, including 5,593 from
P. equestris, 2,359 from P. bellina, 1,080 from Oncidium
Gower Ramsey, and 2,132 from Vanda Mimi Palmer,
have been deposited in public database. These studies
have highlighted the utility of cDNA sequencing for discovering candidate genes for orchid floral development
[19,20], floral scent production [16,21] or flowering time
[22] in the absence of a genomic sequence. However, a
comprehensive description of the full complement of
gene expressed in orchids remains unavailable.
Massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing has become
feasible for increasing sequencing depth and coverage
while reducing time, labour, and cost [23,24]. This technology can be used to deeply explore the nature and
complexity of a given transcriptional universe. 454

sequencing of transcriptomes for model organisms has
confirmed that the relatively short reads produced by
this technology can be effectively assembled and used
for gene discovery [25,26]. In addition, the superior
performance of this technology has been demonstrated
in several studies [27], including those of mustard weed
Arabidopsis thaliana [28,29], the model legume Medicago truncatula [21], maize Zea may [30,31], the tree
Eucalyptus grandis [32], chestnut [33], oil crop Olea
europaea [34], oilseed rape Brassica napus [35], and the
antimalarial plant Artemisia annua [36].
The genus Phalaenopsis Blume (Orchidaceae), a beautiful and one of the most popular ornamental flowers
exported worldwide, comprises 66 species according to
the latest classification by Christenson [37]. The species
are found throughout tropical Asia and the larger
islands of the Pacific Ocean. In Taiwan, 2 of the native
species, P. equestris and P. aphrodite subsp. formosana,
are usually used as parents for breeding. P. equestris
possesses several favorable commercial traits such as
numerous spikes and branches and multitudinous and
colorful flowers. P. aphrodite subsp. formosana has a
perfect arrangement of flower positions at the spike and
an elegant flower shape with extended longevity. The
flowers of both species are scentless. Many of the scent
traits in the P. hybrids are mainly derived from
P. bellina and/or P. violaceae, the native species in
Malaysia. Both P. equestris and P. aphrodite subsp.
formosana are diploid plants with 38 chromosomes
(2n = 2x), which are small and uniform in size
(< 2 μm). The estimated haploid genome sizes are 1,600
Mb (3.37 pg/diploid genome) and 1,300 Mb (2.80 pg/
diploid genome) for P. equestris and P. aphrodite subsp.
formosana, respectively, which are relatively small in
genus of Phalaenopsis [38]. The 2 species could be considered model organisms for studying orchid biology
because of their relative small genome size [39], high
performance of culture system and well applicable functional genomic tools such as genetic transformation
[40-42] and virus-induced gene silencing system [43].
In this report, we provide the first comprehensive
characterization of the transcriptome of Phalaenopsis
orchids by massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing. To
expansively cover the Phalaenopsis orchid transcriptome
and facilitate identifying sets of genes involved in a
broad range of biological processes, we developed the
EST set from 10 samples derived from 3 different
species of Phalaenopisis (Table 1). Based on data corresponding to a single run on the GS FLX sequencer,
almost 42 million bases were assembled into ~43,000
pieces of putative transcripts and the majority of these
have been annotated and functionally classified. All the
sequences were deposited in OrchidBase (http://
140.116.25.218/EST, [44]) and Short Read Archive

Results
Sequencing and assembly of 454 pyrosequenced ESTs

In total, 207,110 ESTs (minimal size > 50 bp) averaging
230 bp were generated from one pyrosequencing run.
Cleaning (removal of primer, polyA tail, etc) of the raw
sequences resulted in a total of 206,960 high-quality
reads with an average length of 228 bp nucleotides totaling 42 Mb. After assembly using GS FLX gsAssembler,
these reads were assembled into 8,233 contigs and
34,630 singletons under the criteria of minimum 40
bases overlap with at least 95% identity. The average
length of contigs and singletons was 364 bp and 201 bp,
respectively. These contigs and singletons represented
up to 42,863 unigenes. The length distribution of unigenes and their component reads are summarized in
Table 2 and Additional file 1 and Additional file 2. Our
assembly also included a larger proportion of long contigs (16% of the contigs were ≥ 500 bp) (Additional file
1) than the 8% reported by Novaes et al. [32]. The unigene set was also compared to the ESTs derived from P.
equestris [11] and P. bellina [12]. About 16.2% (E-value
cutoff, e -10 ) of the unigenes could be matched to the
published Phalaenopsis ESTs (Figure 1). In addition,

different sized contigs were selected to recalculate the
BLAST hits. Result showed that the percentage of hits
was proportion to contig size (400 bp-600 bp, 29.84%;
600 bp-800 bp, 46.6%; 800 bp-1000 bp, 52.63%; > 1000
bp, 64.92%; Figure 2). Furthermore, the previously available ESTs derived from Phalaenopsis orchids were
BLAST against ESTs generated by this study. Results
showed that among 4,875 unigenes, 3,503 (71.9%)
matched the ESTs produced by 454 pyrosequencing.
The unigenes were searched against the NCBI nonredundant (NR) protein database by use of the BLASTX
algorithm. Among the 42,863 unigenes, 22,234 (51.9%)
had at least one significant alignment to existing genes
in the database (E-value cutoff, e -7 ) (Figure 3), and
20,684 of these (93.03%) had an open reading frame
(ORF). A majority (48.1%) of the pyrosequencing assemblies did not match any known sequences in the database. To analyze effects of fragment size on annotation
efficiency, we compared the percentage of hits between
different sized ESTs with and without homology at Evalue < 10-7 (Figure 4). The result showed that 42.88%
of genes without homology and 13% of those with
homology were < 200 bp. Thus, short reads may have a
low level of annotation. In addition, it is also possible

that unannotated reads may likely represent novel genes.
Alternatively, these sequences might correspond to
divergent 5’ or 3’ regions of genes.
Functional annotation of novel transcripts

To determine the possible functions of genes tagged, we
used the Gene Ontology (GO) classification system for
plants developed at TAIR [45] (http://www.arabidopsis.
org/help/helppages/go_slim_help.jsp). The functions of
genes identified cover various biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components (Figure 5). In
total, 10,427 of the 42,863 transcripts were assigned to
biological processes. The largest proportion of functionally assigned ESTs fell into protein metabolism (11%)

and transport (8%) except of unknown biological
processes (20%) and other cellular processes (14%).
Among the molecular functions, 9,518 out of a total
42,863 transcripts were assigned in this category. The
molecular functions most represented were hydrolase
activity (12%), transferase activity (8%) and nucleotide
binding (8%) except for other enzyme activity (19%) and
unknown molecular functions (17%). Among the cellular
components, 9,685 out of a total 42,863 transcripts were
assigned in this category. Chloroplast (18%) and plasma
membrane (12%) are the most represented categories in
cellular components except for unknown cellular components (22%).
These ESTs obtained from a non-normalized cDNA
library could be used to reveal global gene expression
patterns as deduced from transcript abundance. The
transcripts highly expressed in Phalaenopsis tissues are
listed in Table 3. The most abundant ESTs coded for
cytochrome P450-like protein precursor (2.27%), followed by triple gene block 3 (1.98%) and cytochrome
P450 monooxygenase (1.28%). These ESTs probably correspond to the most highly expressed genes in the Phalaenopsis. Plant systems utilize a diverse array of
cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in their biosynthetic
and detoxicative pathways. High expression of the cytochrome P450 gene family suggests that these genes are
important for orchid subsistence and adaptation to the
environment. The high expression of triple gene block 3
raised the interesting question of whether the sequence
samples were infected by Cymbidium mosaic virus
(CymMV) or if the gene is included in the Phalaenopsis
genome. Therefore, we screened other genes of the
same CymMV in the EST dataset. In addition to triple
gene block 3, several genes of CymMV were found,
including 30 unigenes of RNA dependent RNA

and 2 of triple gene block 2. These transcripts showed
significant expression in Phalaenopsis, which indicates
that some of the experimental materials used here may
have been infected with virus prior to the sampling.
Analysis of a large number of ESTs has revealed
ancient polyploidy throughout the major angiosperm
lineages [46,47]. It would be interesting to analyze how
many subfamilies exist in very high number of ESTs to

evaluate the possibility of gene duplication in Phalaenopsis orchids. We set more stringent criteria for assembly (a minimum of 40 bases of overlap with 97% and
99% identity) and found a greater number of unigenes
(Table 3), suggesting that some genes may have been
undergone gene duplication. However, more evidence is
needed to solve the causes that lead to the formation of
paralogous genes, such as whole-genome duplication,
tandem gene duplication or segmental duplication.

Gene families and Pathways

To evaluate the effectiveness of the orchid transcriptome
library, we categorized the assembled unigenes through
the use of Arabidopsis proteome as targets. In total,
4,833 unigenes were classified into 130 gene families
representing 73.9% (130/176) of Arabidopsis gene
families (Additional file 3). We also mapped assembled
unigenes into the KEGG Pathways including metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental
information processing, cellular processes, and organism
systems (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html). A
total of 7,885 unigenes were mapped onto KEGG Pathways (Table 4). Among these, 6,269 unigenes were
related to metabolism, 1,078 unigenes corresponded to
genetic information processing, 121 unigenes mapped to
environmental information processing, 213 unigenes
were classified as cellular processes, and 204 unigenes
belonged to organism systems (Table 4). The presence
genes for these essential cellular processes suggest that
these sequences account for most of the comprehensive
Phalaenopsis transcriptome.
Previously, we identified the major compounds emitted
from P. bellina flowers to be monoterpenes, including
linalool and geraniol [13]. Identification of the potential
genes involved in the biosynthetic pathways for terpenoid precursors will be important for understanding the
regulation of scent biosynthesis in orchids. In our 454
sequence dataset, 50 unigenes assembled from 209 reads
were found potentially related to the methylerythritol

Page 6 of 13

phosphate pathway (MEP) and mevalonate pathway
(MVA) (Additional file 4). Analysis of previous ESTs
from P. bellina showed 8 unigenes assembled from 20
reads were potentially related to the MEP and MVA
pathways (Figure 6). The use of 454 pyrosequencing
identified more genes and more ESTs per gene constituted in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis than did
Sanger sequencing (Figure 6). At least one unigene was
found to correspond to the enzymes participating in the
two pathways, except the third step of the MEP pathway
(Figure 6). Thus, the large amount of transcriptomic
information provided by 454 pyrosequencing may accelerate the progress for the study of scent production and
regulation in orchids.
Transcription factors

Because transcription factors control the expression of a
genome and play important roles in all aspects of the
life cycle of higher plants, we characterized the transcription factor-associated ESTs from the transcriptome
of Phalaenopsis by using rice transcription factor
sequences downloaded from the Plant Transcription
Factor Database (http://planttfdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/) as
queries. In the Phalaenopsis transcriptome, we identified
786 unigenes consisted of 2,317 reads encoding putative
transcription factors, occupying 1.83% (786/42,863) of
the unigenes of Phalaenopsis transcriptome. Compared
to the 5.7% of plant genes that have been shown to be
transcription factor genes [48], 1.83% of genes related to

transcription factors in Phalaenopsis is low. To analyze
the underestimation, we mapped all unigenes to 9 fulllength cDNAs (FL-cDNAs) encoding MADS-box proteins (PeMADS1~PeMADS9) derived from P. equestris.
In total, 33 unigenes could be mapped to the 9 FLcDNAs. Among the 33 unigenes, 5 are located in
untranslated regions, and the other two are short fragments (< 90 bp) located within coding regions. However,
these seven unigenes were not identified as transcription
factor genes. These results suggest that one of the reasons for an underestimation of transcription factor
genes in Phalaenopsis can be explained by sequences
corresponding to divergent 5’ or 3’ regions of genes
and/or they are short reads per se.
The most abundantly expressed transcription factor
gene families, C3H and AP2/ERF, accounted for a full
32.2% (746/2,317) of the overall transcription factor
expression (Figure 7). In addition, bHLH (4.9%), MYB
(4.7%) and NAC (4.5%) families were found in turn
(Figure 7). These five families occupied approximately

46.3% of expressed transcription factors. However, five
families of transcription factors including LFY, M-type,
STAT, VOZ, and WOX were not detected. The few
families that could not be found might result from
inadequate sampling of the transcriptome or genes that
are truly rarely expressed. Large-scale efforts in deeper
sampling and sequencing of the transcriptome will help
completely identify genes related to of transcription
factor families in orchids.

Discussion
As the most species rich and diversified family, Orchidaceae has mesmerized botanists for centuries. As for
most other non-model plant species, we lack genetic
and genomic resources for molecular biological study.
Although a precise estimate of transcriptome coverage
is unattainable without the full genomic sequence, the
massively parallel pyrosequencing characterization can
be considered an initial step for functional genomics
studies in Phalaenopisis. From 206,960 sequence reads,

Figure 7 Number of ESTs related to transcription factors in each transcription factor family. A total of 2,424 putative Oryza sativa subsp.
japonica transcription factors were searched against the Phalaenopsis transcriptome, and target ESTs were classified into corresponding
transcription factor families. Black bars are the number of reads in each family. Shaded bars are the number of unigenes in each family.

Hsiao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:360
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/360

we assembled data for 42,863 unigenes consisting of
8,233 contigs and 34,630 singletons from Phalaenopsis.
Although a high number of transcripts are short-length
reads which may result in several assembled contigs and
singletons for each gene, the dataset we report here still
provides a plentiful dataset of different genes representing a substantial part of the transcriptome of orchids,
which in turn reflects these plants’ sophisticated designs
for successful pollination, reproduction and adaptation
to the environment.
Homology searches showed that 48.1% of the ESTs
have no significant similarities to any other protein
sequences in public databases. About 42.88% of these
ESTs are < 200 bp, indicating that the short size has a
negative effect on successful annotation. However, these
genes may perform specific roles in orchids and be
quite divergent from those of other plant species. The
orchids, indeed, have diverse specialized reproductive
and ecological strategies for adaptive radiation. On the
other hand, we could not reliably annotate a high proportion of unigenes lacking assignment of a putative
function because they did not cover the full length of
the transcript or because they represent untranslated
regions.
Comparing the distributions of the functional categories among ESTs provides support for the expression
levels of the different gene classes. The transcripts with
the first and third highest expression we found for Phalaenopsis were homologous to the members of cytochrome P450 (4.55%). Plant cytochromes P450 catalyze
a wide variety of monooxygenation/hydroxylation reactions in primary and secondary metabolism. Genomic
sequencing projects have revealed that cytochromes
P450 genes represent approximately 1% of the total
gene annotations for each plant species [49,50]. In addition to revealing the highest transcript expression in
Phalaenopsis, the next-generation transcriptome sequencing also generated 94 members of the cytochrome
P450 family. The extraordinary expression level and
remarkable diversification of this gene family may have
led to the Phalaenopsis orchid survival ability. The transcript with the second highest level of expression was
homologous to triple gene block 3 (1.98%) of CymMV.
We also found genes with significant expression that
were homologous to RNA dependent RNA polymerase,
coat protein, triple gene block 1 and triple gene block 2
of CymMV. Even though we found no substantial virusinfected symptoms in our samples, some of the experimental materials have been infected with virus prior to
the sampling. We also found transcripts with high
expression (1.1%) that were homologous to LLA-1378
derived from lily (Lilium longiflorum). This transcript is
found in immature anther, tepal, pistil, stem and leaf in
lily [51], however it has an as yet unknown function.

Dissection of function of these genes might be a useful
direction for further study of orchid biology.
The fact that whole-genome duplication often gives
rise to species-rich groups of organisms, such as
> 23,000 species of Asteraceae and > 19, 400 species of
Fabaceae, highlights that polyploidy can facilitate diversification and speciation of organisms [52,53]. The
Orchidaceae contains more than 25,000 species and
has successfully colonized almost every habitat on
earth. Whole-genome duplication may also have
occurred in the orchid genome. Based on the results
from analyzing how many subfamilies exist with very
high number of ESTs, we suggested gene duplication
probably have occurred on these genes. However, these
gene duplication events may be caused by whole-genome duplication, tandem gene duplication or segmental
duplication. Only after completeness of whole-genome
sequencing of Phalaenopsis has been performed, it will
be possible to differentiate whole-genome duplications
from segmental and tandem duplications by mapping
chromosome locations of the duplicated genes or
blocks of genes.
To evaluate whether the sequences annotated in this
study include all genes expressed in these tissues, developmental stages, and treatments, we searched for a
number of genes involved in metabolic pathways and
homologous to members characterized in Arabidopsis
gene families. The genes associated with metabolic pathways were based on the KEGG database of pathways
and those for gene family on the TAIR database of Arabidopsis proteome. The rationale for these searches was
that those essential genes must be expressed to maintain
cellular functions, so failure to find these sequences in
the transcriptome would reflect either inadequate
sequencing depth or ineffective annotation. For the
pathways considered here, essentially all genes involved
in the pathways were found except those involved in
anthocyanin biosynthesis. For the 176 gene families in
Arabidopsis, total 4,833 unigenes were classified into
130 gene families occupying more than 70% (130/176)
of Arabidopsis gene families. A caution for these finding
is that high levels of expression might be expected for
some essential house-keeping genes, leading them to be
well represented in even an incomplete transcriptome
sequencing effort. To account for this possibility, we
searched for genes associated with transcription factors.
Because of their more restricted spatial and temporal
expression profiles, transcription factor genes are not
expected to be as highly expressed as essential housekeeping genes in whole-organism libraries. We successfully identified genes from nearly all the transcription
factor families considered (51/56, 91%). The few genes
that could not be found might result from incomplete
annotation or inadequate sampling of the transcriptome

Hsiao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:360
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/360

or they may be truly not expressed. Overall, these
searches support that the collection of annotated
sequences we produced represents a reasonably broad
description of the Phalaenopsis transcriptome. These
sequences of expressed transcripts will be very useful for
genome annotation of Phalaenopsis genome in the
future.
Analysis of expression profiles of transcription factors
in the transcriptome of Phalaenopsis is meaningful
because these are master-control proteins in all living
cells. Surprisingly, we found that C3H and AP2/ERF
families together represented more than 30% of expression of Phalaenopsis transcription factors. The C3H
family has been reported to be involved in Arabidopsis
embryogenesis [54], shoot apical meristem maintenance
[55], drought tolerance [56], and response to abscisic
acid in Craterostigma plantagineum [57]. The AP2/ERF
superfamily is defined by the AP2/ERF domain, of about
60 to 70 amino acids, and is involved in DNA binding.
A combination of genetic and molecular approaches has
been used to characterize a series of regulatory genes of
the AP2/ERF family. The members of this family are
involved in regulating various biological processes
related to growth and development, as well as various
responses to environmental stimuli. This family includes
genes related to drought [58], high salt concentration
[58], low temperature [59], diseases [60,61], and the
control of ovule development and flower organ growth
[62]. Understanding the functions of these genes will
advance our understanding of the great morphological
diversity and successful adaptation of orchids. However,
we did not find the transcription factor families LFY,
M-type, STAT, VOZ, and WOX, in the Phalaenopsis
transcriptome. These families might either be rarely
expressed, or might not have appeared in our cDNA
sampling.

Conclusion
Thanks to recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology, we have applied RNA-seq to facilitate
transcriptome analysis of orchids which present important biological questions but lack a fully sequenced genome. Our findings represent substantial contributions to
the publicly accessible expressed sequences for the
Orchidaceae family. With the whole genome sequencing
of P. equestris in progress, this collection of ESTs is a
valuable resource that will be immediately useful for
researchers, allowing for correction of assemblies, annotation, and construction of gene models to establish
accurate exon-intron boundaries. Application of these
resources through the common language of nucleotide
sequences will greatly enhance the insights into the
reproductive success of orchids.

methods
Plant materials and cDNA library construction

Phalaenopsis equestris, P. aphrodite subsp. formosana
and P. bellina were grown without fungal symbiosis in
greenhouses at National Cheng Kung University under
natural light and controlled temperature ranging from
23°C to 27°C. To maximize the diversity and effectively
collect sequences from expressed genes of orchids, we
collected 10 samples from different tissues, developmental stages and treatments (Table 1). Inflorescences,
flower buds, leaves and roots were sampled from the 3year-old P. equestris. Young leaves were collected as
they emerged. Old leaves were taken at the fourth leaf
counting down from the newly emerged one. The coldstressed leaves were collected from old leaves of 3-yearold plants treated for 4 hrs at 4°C. Because Erwinia
chrysanthemi is one of the most serious pathogens
infecting Phalaenopsis, old leaves were infected with E.
chrysanthemi to induce the expression of pathogenrelated genes. Protocorms were 20-day-old germinating
seeds of P. aphrodite subsp. formosana grown on tissuecultured plates without fungal symbiosis. Cool nightinduced spikes were sampled from 3-year-old P. aphrodite subsp. formosana treated with cool night temperature (28°C day/20°C night) for 2 weeks to induce spike
emergence [63]. P. bellina flowers with a strong fragrance were collected on day 5 post-anthesis [16]. Collected samples were frozen immediately in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C until used.
Total RNA from each sample was extracted separately
following the method described by [19]. Poly-A RNA
was prepared from each total RNA sample using the
Oligotex@ mRNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Ontario, Canada).
Samples of 0.5 μg mRNA from each sample were combined into a single large pool and mixed well. This single large, equally-mixed pool was the source for the
cDNA library construction. The cDNA library was constructed using the SMART cDNA synthesis Kit (BD
Clontech, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Pyrosequencing and assembly

In preparation for 454 sequencing, 5 μg of the cDNA
sample was nebulized to a mean fragment size of 600 ±
50 bp, end repaired and adapter ligated according to
previously published literature [23]. After streptavidin
bead enrichment and DNA denaturation, singlestranded molecules were titrated onto derivatized
Sepharose beads and then amplified by emulsion PCR.
A second streptavidin bead enrichment followed emulsion breaking, the bead-attached DNAs were then denatured with NaOH, and sequencing primers were
annealed. One 454 pyrosequencing run was carried out

Hsiao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:360
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/360

with use of a GS FLX sequencer. A 454 SFF file containing raw sequences and sequence quality information can
be access through the SRA web site under accession
number SRA030758.2.
Low quality data (base call score < 10) were trimmed
from the ends of individual sequences. Sequences
shorter than 50 bp after processing were excluded from
the analysis. For assembly, GS FLX gsAssembler was
used with minimum 40 bases overlap with at least 95%
identity.

singletons. This table summarizes the number of contigs and singletons
in different length distribution.
Additional file 2: Summary of component reads per assembly. This
table summarizes the number of component reads assembled into

Sequence analysis and GO classification

All sequences were queried for their similarity to known
sequences by use of a BLASTX algorithm [64] against
the “nr” protein database. Sequence similarity was considered significant at E-value < 10-7 and the “best hits”
annotation was used to represent proteins similar to
those encoded by the contigs and singletons. The
BLAST score (bits) used the BLOSUM 62 matrix and
Existence 11, Extension 1 Gap costs for BLASTX. The
GO Slim Classification for Plants, developed at TAIR
(http://www.arabidopsis.org/help/helppages/go_slim_help.jsp) was used to characterize the ESTs functionally.
The GO identifier of the best hit (with a cutoff of 1e-7)
was attributed to the sequence. This step allowed putative functions to be assigned on the basis of the classification proposed by GO.
Characterization of ESTs by Arabidopsis Gene Family and
KEGG Pathways

The TAIR9 A. thaliana annotated protein databases
(ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/TAIR9_genome_release/TAIR9_sequences) was downloaded. The
protein sequence set was BLAST against Phalaenopsis
contigs and singletons with use of the TBLASTN programs. Sequence similarity was considered significant at
an E-value < 10 -7 . Unique sequences with BLAST
matches were mapped to TAIR Gene Families and
KEGG Pathways of Arabidopsis for further analysis. The
TAIR Gene Family information contains 8,693 genes in
176 gene families updated on September 26, 2009. The
KEGG Pathways for Arabidopsis contains 6,756 genes in
121 pathways released on May 11, 2010.
Identification of putative transcription factor-related ESTs

The protein sequences of predicted transcription factors
for rice were downloaded from the Plant Transcription
Factor Database (PTFDB; http://planttfdb.cbi.pku.edu.
cn/). PTFDB contains information on 2,424 rice (Oryza
sativa subsp. japonica) transcription factors in 56
families. For identification of transcription factor-related
ESTs from Phalaenopsis, the protein sequence set of
each predicted rice transcription factor family was
