Analysis of the genomic homologous
recombination in Theilovirus based on complete
genomes

Abstract
At present, Theilovirus is considered to comprise four distinct serotypes, including Theiler’s murine
encephalomyelitis virus, Vilyuisk human encephalomyelitis virus, Thera virus, and Saffold virus. So far, there is no
systematical study that investigated the genomic recombination of Theilovirus. The present study performed the
phylogenetic and recombination analysis of Theilovirus over the complete genomes. Seven potentially significant
recombination events were identified. However, according to the strains information and references related to the
recombinants and their parental strains, four of the recombination events might happen non-naturally. These
results will provide valuable hints for future research on evolution and antigenic variability of Theilovirus.
Keywords: Theilovirus, Recombination, Phylogenetic analysis

Introduction
Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and Theilovirus are
two distinct species in the Cardiovirus genus of the
family Picornaviridae [1]. The EMCVs comprise a single
serotype and have a wide host range, while the Theilovirus species, probably includes four serotypes: Theiler’s
murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), Vilyuisk human
encephalomyelitis virus (VHEV), Thera virus (TRV; isolated from rats) and Saffold virus (SAFV; isolated from
humans). TMEVs were originally isolated from mice and
later from rats [2]. Serological studies indicated that the
feral house mouse Mus musculus is the natural host for
TMEV [3]. VHEV was isolated by the inoculation of mice
with nasopharyngeal secretions, serum samples, feces,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens, and brain specimens
from the Yakut-Evenk population, indigenous rural people in Siberia that had a chronic form of encephalitis [4].
TRV was isolated from sentinel rats housed with TMEVseropositive rats in Japan [5]. This virus has not yet been
associated with disease in rats but has raised the possibility of additional clades of undiscovered theiloviruses.

SAFVs, new theiloviruses, were first isolated in California
from a fecal sample from an 8-month-old infant with
fever of undetermined origin [6] and then from a nasopharyngeal sample collected from a 23-month-old child
in Canada in 2006 [7].
For picornaviruses, recombination is a common
mechanism of evolution and antigenic variability.
Although a recent report suggested that recombination
happened in Cardiovirus genus [8], no study has systematically investigated the recombination among Theilovirus strains. In the present study, therefore, we
systematically analyzed the available complete Theilovirus genome sequences in GenBank to elucidate the
recombination among these viruses.

Methods
Sequences

The study sequences comprised all the 23 available
complete genome sequences of Theilovirus from GenBank dated January 2011. Sequences were firstly
screened to exclude patented and artificial mutants, and
then aligned in the ClustalW program [9]. The alignment was manually adjusted for the correct reading
frame. Sequences showing less than 1% divergence from
each other were considered as the same. The strain
information of the remaining 21 Theilovirus genomes

were shown in Table 1. Because there was no complete
genome of VFHV in GenBank before our analysis, this
virus was not analyzed in the present study.
Phylogenetic analysis

Before phylogenetic analysis, multiple-alignment was
performed in the ClustalW program. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed using the neighbor-joining method
and evaluated using the interior branch test method
with Mega 4 software [10]. Percent bootstrap support
was indicated at each node. GenBank accession no. was
indicated at each branch.
Recombination Detection

The remaining 21 Theilovirus genomes were re-aligned
in the ClustalW program. Detection of potential recombinant sequences, identification of potential parental
sequences, and localization of possible recombination
break points were determined using the Recombination
Detection Program (RDP)[11], GENECONV [12],
BOOTSCAN [13], MaxChi [14], CHIMAERA [15], and
SISCAN [16] methods embedded in RDP3 [17]. A Multiple-comparison-corrected P-value cutoff of 0.05 was
used throughout.

Results and Discussion
Based on the 21 complete Theilovirus genomes, a phylogenetic tree was constructed (Figure 1). The taxonomy

genomes. Phylogenetic analysis were performed using the
neighbor-joining method and evaluated using the interior branch
test method with Mega 4 software. Values for various branches are

data. Percent bootstrap supports are indicated at nodes.

of these Theilovirus showed in the phylogenetic tree was
consistent with the strain information from the original
sources. From the phylogenetic tree, we can see that
Theilovirus were divided into two major different genetical groups. Among the two major groups, SAFV formed
a single group, while TMEV and TRV closely clustered,
forming the other group. Sequence alignment indicated
that TMEV strains shared 71.2%-75.3% and 67.4%-70.1%
sequence identities with TRV and SAFV strains, respectively. While TRV strains showed 72.2%-74.8% sequence
homologies to SAFV strain.
Seven potentially significant recombination events
were detected with a high degree of confidence (p value
≤ 1.3 × 10-4) judged by the above-mentioned six recombination detection methods. Figure 2 indicated the 7
recombination events, where we can see that event1
included three recombinants which had the same parental strains while the other six recombination events contained six recombinants, respectively.

strain [GenBank:EF165067] [6] as the major parent. This
recombination event led to three recombinant SAFV
strains [GenBank:EU376394, EMBL:AM922293, [GenBank:GU595289 ][7,19,20]. In this recombination event,

the two parental strains were isolated in different countries, and the three daughter recombinants were distributed in different countries, which might hint that this
recombination event happened long time ago and the
recombinants were prevalent worldwide.
Recombination event2 identified the recombination
occurred between two SAFV strains [GenBank:
GU595289, GenBank:EU681179], leading to the other
recombinant SAFV strain [GenBank:EU681176]
(Additional File 1, Part A). However, in this recombination event, one of the parental strain [GenBank:
EU681179] and the daughter strain were sequenced in
the same lab [19], therefore, whether this recombination event occurred naturally or not should be verified by future studies. Additional File 1, Part B and C
indicated the recombination event3 and event4,

Page 4 of 6

respectively, and three SAFV strains [GenBank:
FJ463615, GenBank:FJ463616, GenBank:FJ463617]
involved in the two recombination events were all
sequenced in the same lab [21], therefore, it should
be cared whether these two recombination events
non-naturally occurred by sequencing error and/or
contamination. The recombination event5 (Additional
File 1, Part D) also contained two strains [GenBank:
EU681179, GenBank: EU681178] which were isolated
in the same lab [18], therefore, whether this recombination event non-naturally occurred by sequencing
error and/or contamination should be elucidated by
further study.
Figure 4 indicated the recombination event6 that
occurred between a two TMEV strains, Yale strain
[GenBank:EU723238] and DA strain [GenBank:
M20301] [22], which led to the recombinant TMEV
strain BeAn [GenBank:M16020] which was isolated
from mouse in 1987, and these three virus strains were
all isolated from mouse in USA [1,22]. Figure 5
revealed the putative recombinant TMEV strain (GenBank:M20301), however, the accurate parental strains
has not been detected in the present study, which may
due to the limited numbers of Theilovirus sequence
available at present, therefore, further study should be
performed to identify the accurate parental strains
with the increasing number of Theilovirus genome
sequences.
Recombination is a relatively common phenomenon
in RNA viruses and understanding recombination will
be helpful in unravelling the evolution of pathogens
and drug resistance [23-25]. In the present study, we
performed phylogenetic and recombination analyses
over the full genome of Theilovirus available in GenBank nowadays. Seven potentially significant recombination events were detected. However, four of the

were based on the basis of pairwise distance, modeled with a
window size 200, step size 20, and 100 Bootstrap replicates.

recombination events might happen non-naturally in
the lab, which should be taken into notice in the
future evolutionary analysis of Theilovirus. The other
three recombination events were further analyzed
using other algorithms in RDP software bag and some
of them were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. The
recombination phenomena of Theilovirus will also be
noted in the further research because this will be one
pattern of virulence factor variation in Theilovirus.
