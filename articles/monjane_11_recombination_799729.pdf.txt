during maize streak virus evolution

Abstract
Background: Maize streak virus -strain A (MSV-A; Genus Mastrevirus, Family Geminiviridae), the maize-adapted strain of MSV
that causes maize streak disease throughout sub-Saharan Africa, probably arose between 100 and 200 years ago via
homologous recombination between two MSV strains adapted to wild grasses. MSV recombination experiments and
analyses of natural MSV recombination patterns have revealed that this recombination event entailed the exchange of the
movement protein - coat protein gene cassette, bounded by the two genomic regions most prone to recombination in
mastrevirus genomes; the first surrounding the virion-strand origin of replication, and the second around the interface
between the coat protein gene and the short intergenic region. Therefore, aside from the likely adaptive advantages
presented by a modular exchange of this cassette, these specific breakpoints may have been largely predetermined by the
underlying mechanisms of mastrevirus recombination. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed artificial, low-fitness,
reciprocal chimaeric MSV genomes using alternating genomic segments from two MSV strains; a grass-adapted MSV-B,
and a maize-adapted MSV-A. Between them, each pair of reciprocal chimaeric genomes represented all of the genetic
material required to reconstruct - via recombination - the highly maize-adapted MSV-A genotype, MSV-MatA. We then coinfected a selection of differentially MSV-resistant maize genotypes with pairs of reciprocal chimaeras to determine the
efficiency with which recombination would give rise to high-fitness progeny genomes resembling MSV-MatA.
Results: Recombinants resembling MSV-MatA invariably arose in all of our experiments. However, the accuracy and
efficiency with which the MSV-MatA genotype was recovered across all replicates of each experiment depended
on the MSV susceptibility of the maize genotypes used and the precise positions - in relation to known
recombination hotspots - of the breakpoints required to re-create MSV-MatA. Although the MSV-sensitive maize
genotype gave rise to the greatest variety of recombinants, the measured fitness of each of these recombinants
correlated with their similarity to MSV-MatA.
Conclusions: The mechanistic predispositions of different MSV genomic regions to recombination can strongly
influence the accessibility of high-fitness MSV recombinants. The frequency with which the fittest recombinant MSV
genomes arise also correlates directly with the escalating selection pressures imposed by increasingly MSV-resistant
maize hosts.

Background
Viruses are characteristically capable of rapid evolutionary adaptation. Typically, the primary driver of this
adaptation is high basal mutation rates. For example,
single-stranded RNA and DNA virus genomes generally

accumulate 10-4 to 10-6 mutations per site per replication cycle [1-5]. Many viruses also experience high rates
of homologous recombination and/or reassortment of
genome components [6-10]. Acting either individually
or in concert, these processes can create novel combinations of new and pre-existing genetic polymorphisms,
generating substantial genetic diversity within a single,
closely-related group of viruses (such as those within
the same species [11,12]), or among viruses belonging to
more distantly-related species, genera, or even families.

In this way, new virus strains [13], species [14], genera
[15,16], or - in at least some instances - families [17,18]
can be formed. It is probably this capacity for rapid
genetic diversification that has enabled the recent emergence of numerous economically and socially important
pathogenic viruses of humans and their domesticated
plants and animals.
One of these emergent pathogens is Maize streak virus
strain A (MSV-A), which apparently arose around the
mid 1800s via a recombination event between two Digitaria sp. adapted MSVs [3,13]. MSV-A is distributed
throughout sub-Saharan Africa where it jeopardizes sustainable maize production in some of the world’s poorest countries [19-21]. Its single component, circular,
~2.7 Kb, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome
encodes a movement protein (MP) and coat protein
(CP) in the virion-sense [22-24], and in the complementary-sense the replication-associated proteins Rep and
RepA [25-29]. Separating the virion- and complementary-sense open reading frames (ORFs) are the long
intergenic region (LIR) - comprising transcriptional promoter elements and the virion strand origin of replication (v-ori) [30] - and a short intergenic region (SIR),
where the transcription termination elements and the
complementary strand origin of replication reside.
Experimental evolution can reveal key aspects of natural evolution, and has been used to study evolutionary
processes leading to, for example, viral host-switching
[31], resistance-breakage [32], and increased virulence
[33]. With their small genome size, recombinogenic nature, and high mutation rates, geminiviruses have proved
to be excellent models for experimental studies of the
evolutionary mechanisms of virus emergence and adaptation. Accordingly, various experiments involving geminiviruses - and MSV in particular - have illuminated
genetic factors underpinning important evolutionary
processes, including the adaptation of these viruses to
specific vector species [34] or hosts [35-37], their mutational dynamics [2,3,38-41], and the biochemical and
selective factors constraining their adaptation through
recombination [37,42-45].
We have previously described an experimental scheme
for studying factors that affect the adaptive potential of
recombination in mastrevirus evolution [45]. In this
scheme, low-fitness laboratory-constructed reciprocal
chimaeras of two wild-type (wt) MSV isolates (one naturally adapted to wild grasses, and the other adapted to
maize) are co-introduced into a host plant, where they
might re-create - via recombination - relatively high-fitness genomes that approximate the fittest wt genome.
We used this experimental approach to identify maizeadaptive genetic polymorphisms within the MSV-A genome, and verified apparent hotspots of recombination
detected in natural MSV populations at the v-ori and

SIR [13,46], indicating that these regions of the genome
are mechanistically predisposed to recombination.
Moreover, this study demonstrated that a pair of coinfected low-fitness MSV genomes could efficiently
recombine to regenerate genomes closely resembling wt
MSV-A genotypes, and displaying fitness in maize that
approached that of field-isolated MSV-A viruses.
In this previous study, only MSV-A-like genomes were
recovered, suggesting that genomes representing positions of intermediate fitness within the sequence space
were substantially less maize-adapted than the MSV-Alike genomes. This may have been due to the severe
selective constraints of the MSV-resistant maize genotypes and/or to the specific pairs of chimaeric viruses
used. Either way, these constraints limited the power
and resolution of that specific experimental scheme. For
example, the scheme provided no plausible way in
which to recapitulate the evolutionary path that prototypical MSV-A genomes circulating in the mid 1800s may
have taken - presumably via mutation and recombination, in a variety of differentially MSV-resistant maize
plants - to traverse the maize-infecting fitness landscape
towards the fitness peak occupied by extant MSV-A
genotypes. It is plausible that such information may aid
the elucidation of the actual history of MSV-A evolution, because other in vitro evolution studies have indicated that adaptive steps across fitness landscapes are
constrained to relatively few, specific, evolutionary pathways [47-50].
Here we describe an improved version of the experimental system described by van der Walt et al. [45]
that has enabled us to investigate the role played by
host susceptibility, and the use of architecturally different pairs of defective starting chimaeras, in MSV evolution by recombination. In these experiments, we
recovered recombinant genomes occupying a much
wider variety of positions within the sequence space
than those encountered in the original study, suggesting a plausible scenario for the initial adaptation of
MSV to maize.

Methods
Viruses

Agro-infectious clones of wild-type MSV isolates MSVVW [51] and MSV-MatA [52], as well as the laboratoryconstructed reciprocal chimaeras of these viruses,
MatMPCPVW and VWMPCPMat, and MatMPCPLIRVW and VWMPCPLIRMat [36] have been
described previously. To explain the naming of the reciprocal chimaeras, the virus name following, say, the MP
+CP segments in MatMPCPVW, indicates that the segments were derived from MSV-VW, whereas the rest of
the MSV genome was derived from MSV-MatA (see
Additional file 1).

Agro-infection and leafhopper transmissions

and MSV-VW and each of the parental artificial chimaeras, was assessed in the moderately MSV-resistant
maize genotype Sweetcorn cv. STAR 7714 (Starke
Ayres, South Africa) by quantifying the percentage
chlorotic leaf area produced by the viruses on leaves 4,
5 and 6 of symptomatically infected plants as previously
described [59,60].
More specifically, with the exclusion of the virus GB1R2, which was tested on approximately 42 separate
plants, 18 of which became symptomatically infected, all
the chlorotic areas caused by all of the viruses were
assayed on leaves 4 through six for between 24 and 62
separate plants. Percentage chlorotic leaf areas caused
by each virus on each plant were expressed as the mean
(with 95% confidence interval) of the data obtained
from leaves 4, 5 and 6.

We agro-inoculated 70 three-day-old seedlings of the
MSV-sensitive maize genotype Sweetcorn cv. Golden
Bantam (Millington Seed Co. USA), with a mixed inoculum of either MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat, or
MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat as described by
van der Walt et al. [45]. At approximately 30 days post
inoculation (dpi) we transmitted viruses via leafhopper
from each symptomatic plant to 13-day-old seedlings of
the moderately MSV-resistant maize genotype
PAN6099. For each transmission this was achieved by
caging approximately eight Cicadulina mbila adults on
a symptomatic Golden Bantam leaf for three days followed by transfer of cages to the third leaf of PAN6099
seedlings where they remained for the duration of the
experiment [45,53]. We isolated DNA from symptomatic
PAN6099 plants at approximately 30 dpi, and from
symptomatic Golden Bantam plants at 60 dpi.
Viral DNA isolation, cloning and sequencing

Viral DNA was isolated from symptomatic leaves using
the Extract-n-Amp™Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by
rolling-circle amplification as previously described
[54,55]. Amplified DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI to generate ~ 2.7 kb monomeric
MSV genomes which were gel-purified (GFX™, GE
Healthcare), ligated into BamHI-digested pGEM®-3Zf(+)
(Promega Biotech) using T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas),
and transformed into competent Escherichia coli (E.
cloni®, Lucigen® Corporation) using standard protocols
[56]. The resulting positive clones were sequenced using
universal M13 forward and reverse sequencing primers
and previously-described internal primers [57]. The genome sequences of an additional 11 recombinant viruses
from van der Walt et al. [45] were included in our
analyses.
These, along with the viruses obtained in this study,
were named using informative details such as, sequentially, the maize cultivar used (either Golden Bantam,
[GB], or Pan6099, [Pan]), which recombination experiment they were obtained from (the MatMPCPVW
+VWMPCPMat and MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat co-infections being, respectively, experiment 1 and
2), and following a hyphen, whether the viruses
sequenced were either recombinants or parental input
virus (labelled as R and I, respectively), and the specific
plant number (and in a few cases followed also by the
specific clone) from which the viruses were isolated.
Construction of agro-infectious clones and fitness assays

Infectious clones of recombinant viruses were constructed in pBI121 (Clontech Laboratories, USA) as previously described [58]. The fitness of these cloned
recombinants, along with that of wt viruses MSV-MatA

Statistical analysis

To test whether recombination breakpoints occurred
more frequently in the coding or non-coding regions
when using sensitive or resistant maize genotypes, we
tallied the number of breakpoints occurring over the
respective number of nucleotides (2219 nt for the coding regions, and 470 nt for the non-coding regions) and
calculated a two-tailed p value using the Fisher’s exact
test.
Similarly, using the percentage pair-wise difference
between recombinant viruses and MSV-MatA - obtained
using the different pairs of parental viruses and maize
genotypes - we calculated a two-tailed p value using a
Mann-Whitney test to test for differences in the overall
genomic similarity of recombinant viruses to MSVMatA.

Results and Discussion
Recombination efficiently generates maize-adapted
progeny from maladapted parental MSV genomes

We investigated the adaptive value of recombination
during mixed MSV infections by tracing the trajectory
of evolution via recombination across a sequence space
bounded by maize-adapted and non-maize-adapted wt
MSV genotypes. Specifically, we used a variation of a
previously described experimental system [45] in which
defective, laboratory-constructed MSV recombinants
collectively comprising the complete genomic sequence
of a maize-adapted MSV isolate were co-inoculated into
maize and allowed to recombine during a defined time
period. We assessed the efficiency with which maize
adapted progeny genomes were generated within this
simple experimental system, with respect to two important factors: (1) the particular partitioning of maizeadaptive genetic polymorphisms within defective parental viruses, and (2) the differential selective challenges
imposed by different maize genotypes.

Seventy MSV-sensitive maize seedlings (Golden Bantam) were co-infected with each of the defective laboratory-constructed recombinant virus pairs MatMPCPVW
+VWMPCPMat (containing reciprocal mp and cp
exchanges between the maize-adapted MSV-A isolate,
MSV-MatA, and the Digitaria-adapted MSV-B isolate,
MSV-VW) and MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat
(containing reciprocal mp, cp and LIR exchanges). From
each set of agro-infections we identified approximately
60 plants with symptoms (chlorotic streaking and stunting) that ranged from mild to severe. At 60 dpi we isolated and sequenced a single MSV genome from each
symptomatic plant. In addition, we transmitted viruses
using leafhoppers from each of 36 symptomatic plants
inoculated with MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat
and five symptomatic plants inoculated with
MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat to individual thirteen-day
old MSV-resistant plants (PAN6099) as previously done
[45].
We observed symptomatic infections in 15 MSV-resistant maize plants that were infected via leafhopper with
viruses derived from the MatMPCPLIRVW
+VWMPCPLIRMat co-infections, and in one symptomatic MSV-resistant maize plant infected with viruses
obtained from the MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat coinfections. Approximately 60 days after the co-inoculations into Golden Bantam and 30 days after the leafhopper transmissions, we isolated and sequenced single
MSV genomes from each infected MSV-resistant plant.
We also analysed a further 11 MatMPCPVW
+VWMPCPMat derived recombinants arising in MSVresistant maize plants that were described by van der
Walt et al. [45].
Complete genome sequences of the viruses isolated
from symptomatic plants revealed that recombinant
progeny arose frequently within the various mixed
infections although this depended on the specific chimaeric nature of the co-inoculated viruses. While
some of the viruses retrieved from MSV-sensitive
maize were not recombinant, from the cohort of
viruses transmitted via leafhoppers from sensitive to
MSV-resistant maize all the isolated viruses were
recombinant (Table 1; see also Additional file 2), presumably because of the greater selective pressures
imposed by the resistant host, and/or due to a strong
selective sieve during leafhopper transmission. As
reported previously in co-inoculations with the
MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat chimaera pair [45], we
only retrieved parental viruses from some symptomatic
plants. The parental viruses that were most frequently
retrieved were those containing the maize adapted
MSV-MatA derived mp and cp genes (i.e.
VWMPCPLIRMat and VWMPCPMat). This was not
surprising, since the mp-cp module of MSV-MatA has

Page 4 of 14

been shown to be the primary pathogenicity determinant of MSV in maize [36]. The additional contribution of the LIR to MSV pathogenicity [30,36] was also
corroborated here by the fact that the parental virus,
VWMPCPLIRMat, differing from VWMPCPMat only
by the presence of the MSV-MatA LIR, was retrieved
twice as often from symptomatic plants (Table 1).
Recombination breakpoint patterns are dependant on the
starting parental chimaeras as well as the degree of host
resistance

In agreement with our previous findings [45], the
recombinant viruses recovered from these experiments
displayed between two and 22 recombination breakpoints (i.e. they were a mixture of simple and complex
recombinants), with higher proportions of simple
recombinants being isolated from MSV-sensitive plants
than from MSV-resistant plants (Table 1).
Although the two sets of laboratory-constructed parental chimaeras differed with respect to the partitioning
of maize-adapted MSV genetic material between their
constituent genomes, the recombination breakpoint distributions detected within the progeny recombinants
mirrored those seen in natural geminiviruses
[13,46,61-63]. Specifically, the majority of recombinant
viruses had recombination breakpoints in previously
identified mastrevirus and/or begomovirus recombination hot-spots such as at the cp/SIR interface and at the
virion-strand origin of replication (v-ori) within the LIR
[13,44,61,64,65] (Figure 1). However, contrary to natural
breakpoint distributions observed in mastreviruses and
begomoviruses, fewer recombination breakpoints fell in
the complementary-sense genes, and more fell within
the cp gene, particularly within the 3’ half of the gene.
Despite these differences between the natural and
experimental recombination breakpoint distributions,
both display a marked bias against recombination breakpoints within the protein-coding sequences, with the
majority of cross-over events occurring in the intergenic
regions (p-value < 0.0001 for each individual data set, or
combined data set). It is likely that these coding region
cold-spots are at least partially attributable to selection
against the disruptive effects that recombination within
genes can have on amino acid interactions within the
tertiary and/or quaternary structures of recombinant
proteins [66].
Notwithstanding the similarities between the recombination breakpoint distributions observed in the different
experiments, there are two potentially important differences between recombinants arising during the
MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat and MatMPCPLIRVW
+VWMPCPLIRMat co-infections. While the recombination breakpoints in the 5’ portion of mp have previously
been observed in field-isolated MSV recombinants [13]

genome schematic divided into seventeen approximately equal segments. The light- and dark-grey hatched regions demarcate the regions
swapped between the original wild-type viruses during construction of the chimaeric parental viruses (names indicated under each linearised

viruses were obtained using the MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat chimaeric pair (panels A and B), or the MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat chimaeric
pair (panels C and D) respectively in MSV-sensitive (panels A and C) and MSV-resistant (panels B and D) maize. The red and blue horizontal bars

been genetically detected and it is uncertain which of
these interactions occur; [36]).
A second observation worth noting is that the MSVresistant and MSV-sensitive maize hosts gave rise to
sets of recombinant viruses with different breakpoint
distributions within the complementary-sense ORFs, C1
and C2. From the MSV-sensitive maize plants we identified six recombinants with breakpoints within this
region (GB1-R18 and GB1-R19 in Figure 2A and GB2R3, GB2-R5, GB2-R7, GB2-R18 and GB2-R21_1 in Figure 2C), while none were observed in this area of the
recombinants isolated from the MSV-resistant maize.
Two viruses obtained from resistant maize plants inoculated using leafhoppers previously fed on MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat co-infected plants, showed
possible evidence of small recombination events in C1/
C2 (Pan2-R4 and Pan2-R12, Figure 2D). However, these
events would have only involved the exchange of a single polymorphic nucleotide and therefore could not be
reliably distinguished from convergent point mutations.
Although recombination within the C1/C2 genes of
field-isolated MSVs has been observed, the parental
viruses shared greater than ~95% sequence identity in
all of these cases [13]. The presence of recombination
breakpoints within this region in viruses that we isolated
from sensitive maize plants implies that there is no biochemical impediment to recombination breakpoints falling in C1/C2 when parental viruses are <95% identical
(in all cases here the parental viruses were 89% identical). Rather, the absence of breakpoints in this region in
the resistant maize plants strongly implies that such
recombinants are possibly usually defective, and that
natural selection is responsible for their apparent rarity
in nature.
Most of the recombinants produced during our experiments were essentially reconstructions of the original
maize-adapted wt parental virus, MSV-MatA, with one
breakpoint occurring within 200 nucleotides (nt) upstream
or downstream of the v-ori, and another close to the cpSIR interface (Figure 2). Importantly, and consistent with
previous findings that the v-ori is a recombination hotspot
[13,37,44,64], 42% of all MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat
recombinants (10/26 from the MSV-sensitive maize and
6/12 from the MSV-resistant maize) analysed in this study
as well as 64% (7/11 from the MSV-resistant maize) analysed previously by van der Walt et al. [45], and 47% of
MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat derived recombinants (9/22 from MSV-sensitive maize and 8/14 from
MSV-resistant maize) had a breakpoint within 14 nt of
this site (Figure 2).
Besides transfers of extensive contiguous sequences
comprising nearly entire virion-sense or complementary-sense gene cassettes, many signals of transfers of
much smaller fragments were also observed. While

Page 6 of 14

some of these may have represented the exchange of a
single polymorphic nucleotide, it is difficult to distinguish such recombination events from possible convergent point mutations, and we therefore did not consider
them any further with respect to our recombination
analysis. Small recombination events entailing the
exchange of two or more polymorphic nucleotides were
not apparently clustered and occurred throughout the
genome in the LIR (recombinants GB1-R23, Pan1-R11
and Pan1-R3), cp (recombinants GB1-R1 and Pan1R11), mp (recombinants GB1-R23, GB2-R18 and Pan1R2) and C1/C2 (recombinants GB1-18 and GB1-R19;
see Figure 2A and 2B).
Although almost all of the recombinants were unique
to the plants from which they were isolated, occasionally
identical recombinants were isolated from different
plants suggesting that certain “recombinant solutions”
were more easily accessible and/or selectively favoured.
Examples of such recombinants derived from the
MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat co-infections include
GB1-R8 and GB1-R26 isolated from MSV-sensitive
maize plants (Figure 2A), and Pan1-R8 and Pan1-R9 isolated from MSV-resistant maize plants (Figure 2B).
Examples from the MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat co-infections include GB2-R6, GB2-R19, GB2-R12
and GB2-R21_2 isolated from MSV-sensitive maize (Figure 2C), and Pan2-R7 and Pan2-R8 or Pan2-R2 and
Pan2-R3 (Figure 2C) isolated from MSV-resistant maize
plants. Conversely, we also identified instances, exemplified by GB2-R21_1 and GB2-R21_2 (Figure 2C), where
two different recombinants were isolated from the same
plant.
Recombinants tend to converge on the MSV-MatA
genotype

Given the potential importance of genetic recombination
during evolutionary adaptation, we were interested in
assessing the efficiency with which recombination could
reassemble a genome resembling MSV-MatA - the easily
accessible, and presumably “optimal”, maize-adapted
“target solution” genome that we used to construct the
reciprocal parental chimaeras. In our experiments,
recombination enabled the exploration of vast tracts of
sequence space bounded by, in one dimension, the parental genomes used during the co-infections and, in a
second dimension, the original wt viruses MSV-MatA
and MSV-VW used to construct these parental
genomes.
The simplest way in which all 248 MSV-MatA-derived
polymorphisms carried by a set of reciprocal chimaeras
could have recombined to form a single progeny genome was via two crossover events, at the junctions used
to construct the parental chimaeric genomes. While the
majority of the recombinant genomes appeared to

the degree to which progeny genomes recovered MSVMatA-derived polymorphisms varied according to the
particular pair of reciprocal chimaeric viruses in the
experiment, and with the type of host plant.

In recombinants recovered from MatMPCPVW
+VWMPCPMat co-infections of the sensitive maize genotype, 31.5% - 97.3% of polymorphic sites were identical
to MSV-MatA. In contrast, recombinant progeny from
the same reciprocal chimaeric parental genome pair

Monjane et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:350
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/350

isolated from resistant maize carried 88.3% - 98.2% of
the MSV-MatA polymorphisms.
The recombinants arising from MatMPCPLIRVW
+VWMPCPLIRMat co-infections were generally more
closely related to MSV-MatA than were recombinants
isolated from MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat co-infections, with MSV-MatA contributing between 71.4% 97.3% of polymorphisms in recombinants isolated from
MSV-sensitive maize, and between 92.9% - 99.2% of
polymorphisms in recombinants isolated from resistant
maize.
The differences in the extent to which recombinants
in the four separate experiments converged on the
MSV-MatA sequence is reflected in the conserved and
consensus sequence polymorphism maps in Figure 3.
Importantly, irrespective of the specific experimental
conditions, only MSV-A-derived polymorphisms were
absolutely conserved amongst all the recombinants
obtained from each of the different experiments (see the
conserved solution maps in Figure 3 indicating the origins of the invariant sites across all observed recombinants). Moreover, the consensus sequence of the
recombinants (that is, the genome constructed from the
most common polymorphisms observed at each variable
site across all the observed recombinants) was between
93.69% and 96.87% similar to the MSV-MatA sequence
in all four of the experiments.
Whereas the recombinants isolated from
MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat co-infections of MSVsensitive maize shared only a few conserved polymorphic sites around the 3’ end of mp and the 5’ portion of cp (Figure 3A), conserved sites amongst the
recombinants from the MSV-resistant maize genotype
additionally included all sites within C1/C2 and many
sites within the LIR and SIR regions (Figure 3B). In
both host genotypes, the ‘’conserved’’ regions of recombinants from MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat coinfections included sites in the 3’ portion of mp, the 5’
portion of cp, most of the C2 and the C2 proximal half
of the SIR (Figure 3C and 3D). Recombinants obtained
from resistant maize additionally contained MSV-A
derived polymorphisms throughout most of their C1
and C2 ORFs and within the V2 proximal portion of
their LIR sequences immediately downstream of the vori (Figure 3D).
Although the “consensus” recombinant progeny genomes arising from the different parental chimaera pairs
in the two hosts were all remarkably MSV-MatA-like,
some MSV-VW derived polymorphisms were invariably
present around the sites used in the initial construction
of the chimaeras from MSV-MatA and MSV-VW (Figure 3). Whereas in MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat
derived recombinants the MSV-VW polymorphisms
within the consensus occurred downstream of the v-ori,

Page 8 of 14

in the MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat derived
recombinants they occurred upstream of this site.
Although this pattern doubtlessly reflects the differences
between the ligation sites used to construct the two
reciprocal chimaeric pairs, it also indicates that the v-ori
is a recombination hotspot.
MSV-sensitive maize hosts provide a more permissive
fitness landscape

Although the ‘’consensus’’ recombinant genomes generated under the different experimental conditions were
very similar, there were notable differences in the relative ease with which recombination between the different co-infected parental chimaera pairs yielded
recombinants that approximated MSV-MatA. For example, although the recombinants obtained from MSV-sensitive plants inoculated with MatMPCPVW
+VWMPCPMat showed the most diverse recombination
patterns, these recombinants were collectively not significantly less similar to MSV-MatA than those obtained
from MSV-resistant plants, which displayed much less
diverse patterns of recombination (p = 0.57, MannWhitney U-test; Figure 3A and 3B; see Additional file
3). However, recombinant viruses isolated from MSVsensitive plants co-infected with MatMPCPLIRVW
+VWMPCPLIRMat were significantly less like MSVMatA than those obtained from MSV-resistant plants (p
= 0.0014, Mann-Whitney U-test; Figure 3C and 3D; see
Additional file 3).
In the MSV-sensitive host, the recombinant viruses
produced by each pair of chimaeric parental viruses
were indistinguishable with respect to their similarity to
MSV-MatA (p = 0.66, Mann-Whitney U-test; see Additional file 3). In contrast, in MSV-resistant maize, the
recombinants derived from MatMPCPLIRVW
+VWMPCPLIRMat co-infections were collectively much
more similar to MSV-MatA than their MatMPCPVW
+VWMPCPMat-derived counterparts (p = 0.0015,
Mann-Whitney U-test; see Additional file 3).
These results suggest that host susceptibility, as well
as the configuration of parental genomes, can influence
the efficiency with which fit genomes are assembled via
recombination in a mixed infection. In other words, not
only does a more selective maize host limit the possible
trajectories of MSV evolution by reducing the diversity
of arising recombinants, but it also is more selective of
maize-adapted polymorphisms.
However, it remains unlikely that different degrees to
which recombinants converge on the MSV-MatA
sequence in co-infections of different parental chimaera
pairs are attributable to selection alone. Rather, we
expected that the parental chimaera pair that was
assembled using cloning sites closest to the biochemically predisposed recombination hotspots, either within

the LIR near the v-ori or within the SIR, would converge
more easily on the ideal MSV-A solution. The reason
for this is that recombination events at these sites would
be most likely to reverse the steps used to construct the
original parental chimaeras and to yield the wt maize-

adapted genome (in this case MSV-MatA). This expectation was borne out by the observation that the cloning
sites used to construct the MatMPCPLIRVW
+VWMPCPLIRMat chimaera pair (the pair yielding
recombinants that converged most closely on the MSV-

MatA target solution) were on average 45 nt closer to
the biochemically predisposed recombination hotspots
than those used to construct the MatMPCPVW
+VWMPCPMat chimaera pair.
The fitness of recombinant genomes

The recombinant genomes that we recovered occupied a
variety of positions within the sequence space separating
MSV-MatA from MSV-VW (see Figure 3A and 3C). We
hypothesised that MSV-MatA occupies a peak within
the fitness landscape, and we therefore compared the fitness in maize of eight of the recombinants recovered
from our experiments with that of MSV-MatA, MSVVW and their parental reciprocal chimaeras. As an
approximate measure of viral fitness, we agroinoculated
a moderately MSV-resistant maize genotype (Sweetcorn
cv. STAR 7714) and quantified the percentage chlorotic
leaf areas on leaves 4, 5 and 6 of successfully infected
plants. The selection of this genotype was due to it
being amenable to producing more discriminative infection data, than either the MSV-sensitive genotype within
which most of the tested viruses produced indistinguishable symptoms, or the MSV-resistant genotype within
which some of the viruses produced no symptoms at all.
Although increased pathogenicity does not necessarily
equate with increased fitness in nature, in the context of
MSV infecting individual maize plants, replicative fitness
and pathogenicity seem to be quite highly correlated
(43, 52).
All of the recombinants from MatMPCPVW
+VWMPCPMat co-infections, namely GB1-R2, GB1-R7
and GB1-R11, produced symptoms that were less severe
than those of VWMPCPMat, the more virulent of the
two parental chimaeras. One recombinant, GB1-R7, was
even less severe than MatMPCPVW - the least virulent
of the two parental chimaeras - but was nevertheless
slightly more severe than MSV-VW (Figure 4A). A comparison of the mean percentage chlorotic leaf area produced by the three recombinants suggests that symptom
severity correlated with genetic distance from the MSVMatA genomic sequence. Thus, of the three recombinants, GB1-R7 was the least like MSV-A (only 36.9% of
the 248 MSV-MatA/MSV-VW polymorphic nucleotides
were derived from MSV-MatA), and was also the least
virulent. GB1-R2, which derived 94.6% of its polymorphic nucleotides from MSV-A, was slightly more
virulent, and GB1-R11 was the most genetically similar
to MSV-A (97.3% of the polymorphic nucleotides are
from MSV-MatA) and produced the most severe symptoms. While these data suggest an apparent trend, one
should note both that the 95% confidence intervals (CI)
of the mean symptom severity estimates of these recombinants overlap extensively (Figure 4A) and that the correlation between genetic distance from MSV-MatA and

Page 10 of 14

symptom severity is not statistically supported (p = 0.43;
Spearman ranks test).
Of the five recombinants derived from MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat co-infections, four (GB2R2, GB2-R4, GB2-R7, and GB2-R11) produced symptoms as severe as MSV-MatA, but one (GB2-R21_2) was
only slightly more severe than MSV-VW and MatMPCPLIRVW (Figure 4B). GB2-R7 was the least MSV-A-like
of these recombinants (72.3% of the polymorphic sites
were derived from MSV-MatA) and accordingly produced less severe symptoms than did the more MSVMatA-like recombinants GB2-R4, GB2-R11, and GB2R2 (which respectively obtained 93.8%, 94.6%, and 94.6%
of their polymorphic sites from MSV-MatA). However,
the 95% CI of the chlorotic leaf area measurements
made for these viruses were all largely overlapping (Figure 4B) and they probably do not have very different
degrees of pathogenicity in maize. It is noteworthy that
in addition to being clustered closer to the ideal solution, MSV-MatA, the MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat derived recombinants were also on average
substantially fitter than those derived using the
MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat chimaera pair (Figure 4A
and 4B; p = 0.064 Mann Whitney U-test).
Although GB2-R21_2 was more MSV-A-like than
GB2-R7 (respectively 92.9% and 72.3% of polymorphic
sites derived from MSV-MatA), the symptoms it produced in maize were significantly less severe than those
produced by all of the other recombinants tested. It is
noteworthy however, that GB2-R21_2 carries a mutation
in the C1 ORF that differentiates it from both MSV-VW
and MSV-MatA. Although this mutation is silent for
both Rep and RepA, it could conceivably have an
adverse effect on ssDNA genomic or transcribed RNA
secondary structures, as has been demonstrated for
other silent Rep mutations [67,68].
Although of low resolution, our survey of the fitness
landscape surrounding the maize-adapted MSV-MatA
genotype and the non-maize-adapted MSV-VW genotype in the maize cultivar Sweetcorn (STAR 7714) suggests a feasible evolutionary trajectory leading to the
maize-adapted MSV-A strain (represented here by
MSV-MatA[52]). Being mildly symptomatic in MSVsensitive maize genotypes [60,61,65,69], the Digitariaadapted MSV-B (represented here by MSV-VW), -G
and -F strains probably occupy the ‘lowlands’ of the
“MSV in maize” fitness landscape. In addition to natural
examples [13], our experiments demonstrate that
recombination between these strains resulting in the
exchange of a maize-specific pathogenicity determinant,
the mp-cp gene module [36], could have greatly
improved the fitness of the ancestral MSV-A virus. Even
in our most permissive maize genotype, large portions
of the maize-adapted MSV-MatA-derived mp-cp

Figure 4 Fitness assay of parental MSV genomes and recombinant MSV viruses. The viability of recombinant viruses compared to that of
their chimaeric parents, and the wild-type viruses MSV-MatA and MSV-VW. Recombinants recovered from MSV-sensitive plants (cv. Golden
Bantam) after agroinoculation with the pair MatMPCPVW+VWMPCPMat (A) and MatMPCPLIRVW+VWMPCPLIRMat (B) were tested in moderatelyresistant maize (cv. STAR 7714). Mean chlorotic leaf areas (and the 95% confidence intervals of these estimates indicated by error bars) observed
on leaves 4, 5 and 6 of symptomatic plants. Shown in blue and pink on the genome schematic are regions derived from MSV-VW and MSVMatA, respectively. The genome regions are as indicated in the legend of Figure 1.

sequence were conserved across all the recombinants.
From this point onwards, as is implied by the relative
fitness value of all the recombinants we tested, our
results suggest that further exploration of the fitness
landscape in permissive maize genotypes, either by
further recombination or by point mutation, could have
enabled a prototypical recombinant MSV-A to progressively climb higher on the fitness landscape to eventually
attain the altitudes that have been reached by MSV-A
genotypes found today throughout Africa [70].

Conclusions
Using an established model system for analysing the
evolution and adaptation of MSV to maize plants, we
demonstrate that despite diverse recombinants emerging
during mixed infections involving two separate sets of
parental viruses and two different hosts, both the overall distributions of recombination breakpoints and the
average patterns of recombination are remarkably similar across all experimental conditions. Most notably, in
all experiments the consensus of all observed

recombinants deterministically converged upon that of
the maize-adapted MSV-A genotype, MSV-MatA, which
was initially used to construct the parental chimaera
pairs. Besides converging on the MSV-MatA sequence,
when tested in isolation some of the recombinants also
produced symptoms in maize that approached those
produced by MSV-MatA.
It is clear from our study that the biochemically predisposed recombination hot-spots within the MSV genome strongly influenced the recombination patterns that
we observed in our experiments. It is also evident that
varying mechanistic predispositions to recombination
across the MSV genome can constrain the efficiency
with which recombination provides access to fitness
peaks within the sequence space. However, it is noteworthy that we have provided evidence in MSV that, as
is becoming apparent in other viruses such as Human
immunodeficiency virus [71], recombination hotspots
within the intergenic regions correspond with genome
sites at which recombination breakpoints are likely to
have the smallest deleterious impact on virus viability -

Monjane et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:350
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/350

a finding which suggests that the MSV genome may
have specifically evolved to accommodate a recombinogenic life-style.
Finally, our results indicate a plausible scenario for the
creation and early evolution of the maize adapted MSVA strain through recombination between two Digitariaadapted MSVs. The complex recombination patterns
that we have sometimes observed indicate that within a
permissive MSV-sensitive maize genotype, the prototypical MSV-A genome could conceivably have been
assembled through a series of adaptive recombination
events (and possibly also compensatory and/or adaptive
point mutations) that incrementally nudged it towards
the fitness peak that MSV-A currently populates in
maize.
