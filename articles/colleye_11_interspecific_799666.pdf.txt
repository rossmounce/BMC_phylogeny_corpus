Interspecific variation of calls in clownfishes:
degree of similarity in closely related species
Orphal Colleye1, Pierre Vandewalle1, Déborah Lanterbecq2, David Lecchini3 and Eric Parmentier1*

Abstract
Background: Clownfishes are colorful coral reef fishes living in groups in association with sea anemones
throughout the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Within their small societies, size hierarchy determines which fish have access to
reproduction. These fishes are also prolific callers whose aggressive sounds seem to play an important role in the
social hierarchy. Agonistic interactions being involved in daily behaviour suggest how acoustic communication
might play an important role in clownfish group. Sounds were recorded and compared in fourteen clownfish
species (some of which have never been recorded before) to evaluate the potential role of acoustic
communication as an evolutionary driving force.
Results: Surprisingly, the relationship between fish size and both dominant frequency and pulse duration is not
only species-specific; all the specimens of the 14 species are situated on exactly the same slope, which means the
size of any Amphiprion can be predicted by both acoustic features. The number of pulses broadly overlaps among
species, whereas the pulse period displays the most variation even if it shows overlap among sympatric species.
Sound comparisons between three species (A. akallopisos, A. ocellaris and A. frenatus) having different types of
teeth and body shape do not show differences neither in the acoustic waveform nor in the power spectrum.
Conclusion: Significant overlap in acoustic features demonstrates that the sound-producing mechanism is highly
conservative among species. Differences in the calls of some species are due to size dimorphism and the sound
variation might be in this case a by-product. This morphological constraint does not permit a consideration of
acoustic communication as the main driving force in the diversification of clownfishes. Moreover, calls are not
produced to find mate and consequently are less subject to variations due to partner preference, which restricts
the constraints of diversification. Calls are produced to reach and defend the competition to mate access.
However, differences in the pulse period between cohabiting species show that, in some case, sounds can help to
differentiate the species, to prevent competition between cohabiting species and to promote the diversification of
taxa.

Background
Acoustic communication provides a good model for
studying the evolution of behaviour. Generally speaking,
acoustic signals used in mate choice and mate recognition can play a role in speciation for sound producing
taxa such as anurans [1,2], insects [3,4] and birds [5,6].
Variation in acoustic signals can act as pre-zygotic isolating mechanisms [7-9], the receivers being the

selective force on the evolution of the signal [10]. The
acoustic signal is typically composed of both temporal
and spectral components, which may evolve at different
rates [11]. Examining these patterns of acoustic variation
among species may be useful for testing the evolutionary
history of the characters [12,13].
Among the sound-producing fish, the coral reef damselfishes (Pomacentridae) are one of the most intensely
studied families with sound production being documented for more than 20 species, belonging to seven different genera [14-16]. Within this large and diverse fish
family, clownfishes are colorful coral reef fishes well

known for their mutualistic relationship with tropical
sea anemones that host them [17]. Recent phylogenetic
investigations using both morphological and molecular
characters supported the monophyly of the clownfishes
belonging to the genera Amphiprion and Premnas
[18-20]. More specifically, on the basis of 23 (out of 28)
species and three mitochondrial genes, Santini and
Polacco [20] proposed a first hypothesis concerning the
lifestyle and origin of the ancestral clownfish. They suggested it was a slender-bodied animal with a rounded
caudal fin. However, their interpretation of the evolutionary history of this group still remains poorly
explained.
In clownfishes, groups are composed of a breeding
pair and between zero to four non-breeders, depending
on species and size of host [21,22]. Within each group,
the sex is controlled socially and there is a size-based
dominance hierarchy: the breeding female is the largest
individual, the breeding male is the second largest and
the non-breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends [22,23]. The size hierarchy forms a queue
to attain dominant status; individuals only ascend in
rank when a higher rank individual disappears, and the
smallest fish in the group is always the most recent
recruit [21,24]. Clownfishes are prolific callers, producing sounds during interactions among group members
[16,25]. In such a system, sounds are not used for mate
attraction. However, acoustic signals might confer a
higher probability of attaining breeding status. Dominant frequency and pulse duration of the calls being
morphologically determined signals related to fish size
[26,27], sounds seem to be important for living in social
group because the hierarchy determines which fish can
have access to reproduction [21].
Agonistic interactions are involved in daily behavior
[22] and sounds are known to be associated with them
[17,26,28], suggesting how important acoustic communication is in clownfish group. So, the question arises as
to whether this behaviour is also important in speciation
process. To find out, the first step was to compare the
calls of closely related clownfish species in order to evaluate the variation in call characters [see [7]]. Amphiprion species produce the same kind of broadbandpulsed sounds during agonistic interactions [17,27,29],
meaning the differences should not be at the level of the
biomechanics. Although sounds are all produced by
snapping jaws [30], other characteristics could display
variation among species. Moreover, dominant frequency
and pulse duration are known to be size-related acoustic
signals in clownfishes [26,27]. We predict that if these
characters were important in the taxon diversification,
the different species would have evolved different relationships between dominant frequency and fish size, and
between pulse duration and fish size. Overlap in other

characters such as pulse period or number of pulses in a
call would not be observable in case of diversifying character of the taxa. This study analysed the sounds of 14
different clownfish species. The aim was to test the
hypothesis that acoustic features can help to evaluate
the potential role of acoustic communication as a driving force in the evolution of clownfishes.

Results
Interspecific differences in sounds

Sounds were produced by all the 14 species during
aggressive interactions. The call of each species consisted of short pulses emitted alone or in series, and
in a relatively narrow band of low frequencies (Table
1). Pulse duration and dominant frequency were
highly related to fish size across species (Figure 1).
The more fish size increased, the more pulse duration
increased (r = 0.98, p < 0.0001; Figure 1A), and the
more dominant frequency decreased (r = -0.99, p <
0.0001; Figure 1B). To determine whether these sizerelated acoustic features evolved in a similar way
among species, five groups of individuals were analysed (see methods section for more details). The
inter-species comparison using fish size as a covariate
showed that pulse duration (ANCOVA, test for common slopes: F 4,33 = 1.812, p = 0.150) and dominant
frequency (ANCOVA, test for common slopes: F4,33 =
1.753, p = 0.162) did not differ among species, with
all the 14 species being situated on the same slope.
Thereby, variation among species in both acoustic features was clearly explained by size dimorphism
between clownfish species.
Some differences between species still remained for
the frequency-size and duration-size relationships even
after removing the effect of body size (Figures 2A,B).
However, this observation needs to be carefully interpreted because deeper attention to pairwise comparisons
revealed that pulse duration/body size relationship (H =
8.332, d.f. = 4, p = 0.0801) and dominant frequency/
body size relationship (H = 7.276, d.f. = 4, p = 0.1220)
were not significantly different between individuals having similar body size (53-54 mm SL) and belonging to
five different species (A. latifasciatus, A. melanopus, A.
ocellaris, A. percula and A. perideraion). The number of
pulses broadly overlapped between species (Figure 2C,
Table 1), although there were some differences (H =
47.62, d.f. = 13, p < 0.01). Pairwise comparisons showed
a few species were significantly different (Dunn’s test, p
< 0.01): A. ocellaris and A. nigripes, A. ocellaris and A.
clarkii, A. ocellaris and A. akallopisos. Pulse period displayed the most variation among species (H = 383.1, d.f.
= 13, p < 0.001), but considerable overlap in pairwise
comparisons showed that several species were similar
(Dunn’s test, p > 0.05; Figure 2D, Table 1).

All recordings were made at 26°C. Species are presented in ascending size order
n, number of recorded individuals per species with 50 sounds analysed per individual. Thus, the standard deviation was sometimes calculated from 300
measurements (in case of 6 recorded individuals per species) or from 50 measurements when only one specimen per species was recorded.

Morphology and sounds

Deeper attention was given to three species having different teeth shape. Sound comparisons of these three
species based on three specimens having the same size
(61-63 mm SL) revealed that the dominant frequency of
A. akallopisos, A. ocellaris and A. frenatus was not significantly different (H = 0.0207, d.f. = 2, p = 0.9897) and
was respectively 646, 627 and 625 Hz. Moreover, the
acoustic waveform and the power spectrum exhibited
the same pattern despite the different types of teeth:
rectangular and incisiform in A. akallopisos, conical and
caniniform in A. frenatus and spatulate in A. ocellaris
(Figure 3).

Discussion
This study is one of the first comparisons of acoustic
characteristics in a sizeable number of closely related
species of fishes [see also [31]]. The most important
insight was found at the level of the relationship
between fish size and both dominant frequency and
pulse duration. These kinds of relationships were already
well known in fishes and have been found in numerous
species from different taxa [26,27,32-36]. In the present
study and for the first time, it appears that these relationships are observed at a higher taxonomic level in
the case of clownfishes (i.e. spread over the entire tribe
Amphiprionini; see [18]) since dominant frequency and
pulse duration are strongly predicted by body size
among the 14 different species. It clearly shows all
clownfish species use the same mechanism of vocalization [30], which has remained largely conserved
throughout evolution. Moreover, different species having

different body shape and different types of teeth (A.
akallopisos, A. frenatus and A. ocellaris) but the same
size produce sounds that display the same power spectrum and the same oscillogram, demonstrating these
morphological variations do not make significant differences in the sounds produced by the jaw teeth snapping.
The size influence highlights that all the fourteen species might have a major overlap at the level of pulse
length and dominant frequency. Surprisingly, using the
pulse duration/body size and dominant frequency/body
size ratios removes the effect of body size at the level of
pulse duration (Figure 2A), but not at the level of dominant frequency (Figure 2B). Regarding the dominant frequency, the ratio continues to be smaller in larger
species, but highly reduces the overlap between species.
For example, some Amphiprion clarkii, measuring
between 55 and 110 mm in SL, produced a frequency
range that was between 700 and 400 Hz, overlapping
also the frequency of smaller A. ocellaris (625-900 Hz;
see also [27]). However, the ratio of dominant frequency/body size was 1.40 in A. clarkii and 1.62 in A.
ocellaris, clearly distinguishing the species. Therefore, a
factor other than body length must be important in
determining the absolute frequency values. The volume
of the swimbladder could be the determining factor.
Moreover, the data of this last factor are also correlated
with fish size. The question arises whether the fish is
able to determine the relationship (or the discrepancy)
between the emitter size and the sound frequency it
detects. If so, it could enable the fish to distinguish
whether the emitter is conspecific or not. In the future,
it would be interesting to compare these size-related

relationships between Amphiprion and other pomacentrids. Comparison with Pomacentrus partitus data [36]
seems to indicate these fish might also be placed on the
same slope. In this case, we could expect there is an
ancestral relationship between dominant frequency and
body size, and this relationship is not important in the
taxon diversification because it does not change between
species. However, more precise data from other pomacentrids are needed.
Variations in sounds are usually considered as prezygotic isolating mechanisms leading to speciation
[7,37,38]. In Amphiprion species, acoustic properties can
contribute to the differentiation of species because some
of them showed differences in at least one of the acoustic characteristics recorded. However, the significant
overlap in acoustic data due in part to the conserved
mechanism of sound production supports the acoustic
communication cannot be considered as the unique isolating barrier and does not seem to be the main driving
force in the evolution of clownfishes. The fact that all
species have the same biomechanics implies these fishes
do not have many possibilities to develop variations in
their calls: they can differ in dominant frequency and
pulse duration through their body size, in pulse period
and in number of pulses in a call. The alternative
hypothesis would be some differences in the calls are a
by-product of the size variation. Body size as a trait of

natural selection has already been demonstrated in the
speciation event of some stickleback species in which
this difference is thought to be an adaptation to alternative foraging habitats [39]. In damselfishes, evolutionary

change in body size (i.e. gigantism or nanism) could be
assumed as a relatively common phenomenon [40,41]
and could therefore be involved in the isolation of some
Amphiprion species. From the proximal cause point of

Colleye et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:365
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/365

view, the size appears really important in maintaining
the hierarchy existing within groups. In Amphiprion
akallopisos, all aggressive interactions (biting, chasing,
frontal and lateral display, body jerking) appear to be
preferentially directed towards individuals adjacent in
ranks [22]. In Amphiprion percula, rank was the only
factor associated with the probability of mortality; lowrank individuals suffer from a higher mortality rate than
high-rank individuals. The most likely explanation for
this pattern is competition for rank [21], preventing
smaller fish from having access to reproduction. It
means that acoustic communication can be an important factor for mating access.
From the ultimate cause point of view, competition
for the limited anemone resource may have resulted in
niche partitioning through specialization for different
anemone species [42], most clownfish species remaining
in close contact with their hosts and rarely interact with
other species on the reef [17]. However, some clownfish
species appear to partition the anemone resource with
other species by having a refuge in size [42,43]: small A.
sandaracinos or A. leucokranos cohabit with A. chrysopterus in the region of Madang (Papua New Guinea),
while small A. perideraion use the same host sea anemone as A. clarkii in the region of Okinawa (Japan). In
both cases, the different sizes of cohabiting species
imply they possess clear differences in their acoustic
repertoire (Table 1), size-related call characteristics such
as main frequency and pulse length being a by-product
of the evolutionary trait. In the Japanese heterospecific
groups, small A. perideraion are not considered as competitors and should receive less aggressive attention
from larger congener A. clarkii. Although A. clarkii suppresses the growth and reproduction of A. perideraion
[44], subadult A. perideraion are able to mature in heterospecific groups, and change to female when they are
the largest among conspecific members. This suggests
that A. perideraion in heterospecific groups prepare for
reproduction before the disappearance or emigration of
larger A. clarkii. Thus, they adopt a mating strategy that
involves waiting for vacated breeding posts because of
their low mobility and a low host density [43].
Due to the relative simplicity of many central and peripheral vocal mechanisms, fish typically lack the ability
to produce complex and dynamic, frequency-modulated
calls [45]. Vocal differences among fish species are
usually due to variations in temporal patterning [27,31].
Pulse period has been shown to be the most important
acoustic feature involved in species recognition in
pomacentrids [46,47]. Divergence in this character
seems to be sufficient to drive pre-zygotic isolation [7],
because differences in the calling characteristics are able
to prevent the signaller to be considered as a competitor. Myrberg et al. [48] conducted playback experiments

to test the responsiveness of different Stegastes species.
Although sounds of each species were able to elicit
responses of all the other species, males significantly
more responded to sounds of their own species than to
sounds from congeners. Interestingly, species that cohabit individual sea anemones (i.e. A. sandaracinos with A.
chrysopterus in the region of Madang, or A. perideraion
with A. clarkii in the region of Okinawa) present a completely different pulse period. As previously stated, nonoverlap in this character may have been important in
the taxon diversification. However, pulse period is not
systematically significantly different among sympatric
species: A. clarkii, A. frenatus and A. ocellaris have the
same pulse period range (Figure 2D) while living in
sympatry on the fringing reef around Sesoko island [49].
These three species inhabit different host species, being
Heteractis crispa for A. clarkii, Entacmaea quadricolor
for A. frenatus and Stichodactyla gigantea for A. ocellaris [44,49], which suggests overlap in pulse period
among these species is of minor importance.

Conclusion
We predicted that no-overlap in different acoustic features would drive the taxon diversification. However,
results surprisingly showed significant overlap in some
acoustic features (dominant frequencies and pulse durations) in Amphiprion species. It is the first case for
which so many different species can be placed on the
same slope, giving the opportunity to use the dominant
frequency and pulse duration for assessing fish size.
This set of observations highlights 1) the use of a highly
conservative mechanism, 2) the important role of body
size in clownfish ways of life and 3) that this character
is not important in this taxon diversification because all
the clownfish species maintained the same relationships
between fish size and both dominant frequency and
pulse duration. However, in some case, the refuge in
size could be a way to access to diversification. Significant overlap in sonic features could also be due to the
fact that sounds are not produced to find mate, but to
defend mate access, which restricts the constraints of
diversification. We conclude that sounds do not appear
to be the main driving force in the diversification of
clownfishes. However, differences in the pulse period
between cohabiting species showed that, in some case,
sounds can help to differentiate the species, to prevent
competition between cohabiting species and to promote
the diversification of taxa.
Methods
Sound recording and analysis

Forty-three specimens belonging to 14 species were
audio-recorded, and 50 sounds per individual were analysed. Different methods were used to collect acoustic

Colleye et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:365
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/365

data. On the one hand, sounds were recorded during
fieldwork in the lagoons in front of Toliara (Mozambique Channel, west coast of Madagascar, 23°36’S - 43°
66’E), in front of Opunohu Bay (Moorea, French Polynesia, 17°29’S - 149°51’W) and on a fringing reef in front
of Sesoko Station (Okinawa, Japan, 26°39’N - 127°57’E).
Fishes were collected by scuba diving and were placed
with their anemone host in glass tanks filled with running seawater at a constant temperature of 26°C. On the
other hand, recordings were also made on fishes maintained in tanks (T = 26°C) in the Aquarium of La
Rochelle (France) and in Oceanopolis (France). Whatever the method used, all recordings were performed in
standard aquaria. Sound recordings and analyses were
carried out according to the methodology used by Parmentier et al. [25] and Colleye et al. [26]. The following
sonic features were measured: pulse duration (ms),
number of pulses in a train, pulse period (ms) and
dominant frequency (Hz). Other variables were removed
because they are not independent: 1) the interpulse
interval (measured as the time from the end of one
pulse to the beginning of the next one) was correlated
with the pulse period and 2) the sound duration
depended on the number of pulses in a call.
Character reconstruction of acoustic signals

Acoustic characters were obtained from recordings of
living fishes. Some acoustic characteristics, such as
dominant frequency and pulse duration, vary in a predictable fashion with the size of the calling individual
[26,27]. Because differences in these features between
species might simply reflect an effect of differences in
body size, the size-frequency and size-duration relationships were taken into account rather than the variables
alone. Ideally, these relationships should be determined
within each species, but we had limited sample size for
some species used in the analyses. Accordingly, all individuals’ means were used as data points in a linear
regression analysis, and the overall significant slope was
used to remove the effects of body size from the
among-species comparison. Note that data related to
dominant frequency were first ln-transformed because
they were exponentially related to fish size. Then, the
among-species comparison was made by pooling
together individuals belonging to the same species.
Coding of acoustic characters

In this study, we focused on variation in agonistic
sounds between closely related species. Usually, phylogenetic studies deal with behavioural characters and score
the presence or absence of a given display. However,
variation in most acoustic characters is quantitative
rather than categorical. Quantitative characters are often
used in phylogeny reconstruction but methods of coding

Page 7 of 9

these characters continue to be debated [50,51]. Therefore, variation among species for each character was
examined according to published protocol [7]. This
method is based on the criterion of non-overlap of 95%
confidence intervals to define gaps, and divides each
acoustic variable into one or more sets of overlapping
intervals. Each set was coded as a single character state
(see Figure 2 in results). This coding method is relevant
because it provides a consistent way of comparing character change across species [7].
Morphological study

Sound being initiated by teeth collision [see [30]], the
buccal dentition of three different species (A. akallopisos, A. frenatus and A. ocellaris) was studied, with three
individuals from each species used to make comparisons
among tooth shapes. Fishes were deeply anaesthetised
with tricaine methanesulphonate MS-222 in seawater
(500 mgl-1) and were fixed in 7% buffered seawater formalin for approximately 2 weeks before being transferred to 70% ethanol for storage. Experimental and
animal care protocols followed all relevant international
guidelines and were approved by the ethics commission
(no. 728) of the University of Liège.
After having been removed from the fish, the buccal
jaws were minutely cleaned using whet clamps and a little brush. After dehydration, samples were critically
point-dried with CO2 using a Leica EM CPD030, and
platinum coated using a Balzers SCD 030. The material
was then examined using a Jeol JSM-840 A scanning
electron microscope.
Statistical analyses

The data used in the analyses were mean values of all
recorded sounds for each individual. Because we had
limited sample size for some species, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was run to test whether acoustic
variables related to fish size evolved in a similar way
among five different groups. The first four groups corresponded to species for which we have a sufficient sample size (A. akallopisos, A. clarkii, A. frenatus and A.
ocellaris, see Table 1) while the fifth group was a pool
grouping all individuals of the other species with limited
sample size (only one or two individuals). The comparison aimed to determine whether the intraspecific sizerelated variation of the acoustic variables is similar to
the interspecific variation (the pool of species). Note
that data about dominant frequencies were first lntransformed because they were exponentially related to
fish size. The other two acoustic variables (pulse period
and number of pulses per sound) were tested for the
assumption of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test), and then
