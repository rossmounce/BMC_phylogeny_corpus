Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurologic disease of young adults. In the recent years,
our understanding on disease pathomechanisms has considerably improved and new therapies have
emerged. Yet a cure for this devastating disorder is still a far cry away and human resources on ex
vivo specimens are limited. More than 70 years after its first description, experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) remains an important tool to understand concepts of T cell mediated
autoimmunity as well as the roles of the innate and the humoral immune systems. Some EAE
models also well reflect mechanisms of tissue damage including demyelination, axonal injury and
also cortical changes. A limitation of the classical EAE model is a neglect of CD8 T cell mediated
immune mechanisms. Moreover, well characterized models for primary progressive MS or
demyelination patterns involving primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy are still not available. Yet
many current therapeutic concepts including glatiramer acetate or natalizumab stem from their
successful first application in EAE models. New strategies include the widespread use of conditional
knockout mice to understand the cell-type specific function of single genes, innovative approaches
to establish models on the roles of B cells and CD8 T cells as well as on the relation of inflammation
to primary degeneration. In summary, EAE models continue to play an important role in
neuroimmunology thereby also stimulating research in other fields of the neurosciences and
immunobiology.

Classical EAE models: an overview
The model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) stems back from an attempt to understand the
pathogenesis of post vaccinal encephalomyelitis, e.g.,
after rabies vaccination during the 1920s and 1930s (for
overview see Gold et al., 2006). At that time, first immunization experiments with repeated inoculations of
human spinal cord homogenate in rabbits and rhesus
monkeys resulted in the first models of experimentally
induced encephalomyelitis. Over the next 70-80 years,

EAE was studied in many different species, including primates and rodents. Improved protocols included the
application of a mineral oil-based adjuvant (Freund's
adjuvant), and later on the addition of heat-inactivated
mycobacteria (complete Freund's adjuvant, CFA) that
facilitate disease induction after a single inoculation.
Some models, especially in mice, also require the intraperitoneal injection of pertussis toxin which may deplete
regulatory T cells and thus enhance autoimmune reactions [1].

After World War II, EAE models in rats and guinea pigs
dominated neuroimmunological research for many decades. In these species, active immunization used either
spinal cord homogenate, myelin or, as first purified antigen in the 1960s, myelin basic protein (MBP) in CFA.
Such protocols resulted in a very reproducible disease
with an onset 9-12 days after immunization and an acute
monophasic or chronic relapsing-remitting/progressive
disease course depending on the species or rodent strain
[2]. Moreover, EAE can be induced not only by active
immunization, but also passively by adoptive transfer of
antigen specific T cells (AT-EAE). This was shown after in
vitro propagation of MBP specific T cell lines and subsequent transfer of cells in mice [3]. In the Lewis rat strain,
this regimen results in disease onset 3-4 days after cell
transfer, followed by disease maximum 1-2 days later and
a subsequent complete remission within the next few
days. The histopathology of this model is characterized by
a purely inflammatory pattern with minimal central nervous system (CNS) demyelination, thus rather reflecting
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Yet MBPEAE provides an excellent paradigm to investigate T cell
function and regulation in autoimmune neuroinflammation and nicely underpins the autoimmune origin of MS.
The induction of EAE is not restricted to myelin antigens,
as the disease can also be elicited by astroglial antigens
like S-100 or glial fibrillary acidic protein (for review see
[4]) and neuronal antigens including Ma [5] or amyloid
precursor protein (APP, [6]). Similarly, AT-EAE can also
be induced by adoptive transfer of T cells specific for astroglial and neuronal antigens (reviewed in [7]).
Over the last 20-30 years, further encephalitogenic myelin
antigens were identified, the first of which was proteolipid
protein (PLP). Other myelin autoantigens in rodents
include myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG; [8],
myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), 2', 3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), oligodendrocyte
(OL)-specific protein, and myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein. The most recent studies were
performed in inbred mouse strains in which immunodominant and encephalitogenic T cell epitopes, like PLP
aa139-151 or MOG aa35-55, were also identified. Some
of the mentioned myelin proteins are components not
only of CNS, but also peripheral nervous system myelin.
Thus immunization with e.g. MPB or PLP theoretically
can also result in radiculitis or neuritis [9]. Importantly,
not only the susceptibility to disease but also the pathology and clinical course are determined by both genetic
factors and the specific immunogen/adjuvant used, resulting in established combinations of autoantigen and
inbred mouse strain, e.g. PLP139-151 EAE in SJL mice. In
some cases, tolerance to single autoantigens in non-sus-

http://www.etsmjournal.com/content/1/1/5

ceptible strains can be overcome by specific protocols
including booster immunization [10].
A milestone in multiple sclerosis (MS) research was
marked by the characterization of MOG as an autoantigen. Although only a minor component of CNS myelin,
MOG is part of the outer myelin layer thus being of special
interest as target of a first autoimmune attack before antigen spreading may occur. Immunization with MOG
induces not only encephalitogenic T cells, but also a
demyelinating autoantibody response in susceptible species. Moreover, demyelinating anti-MOG antibodies
enhance disease severity causing extensive demyelination
after T cell-mediated CNS inflammation in rat and primate EAE models [11,12]. Such antibodies to native MOG
are also found in MS patients and mediate demyelination
after transfer into EAE rats [13]. At first, immunization
with MOG in rodents was mainly investigated in different
rat strains [14]. Studies in the DA rat were able to reproduce a range of pathological and clinical phenotypes
mimicking the spectrum of MS [15]. Induction of MOGEAE in Brown Norway rats led to a Devic like disease (at
least in clinical terms) with eosinophilic infiltrates also
suggesting the involvement of T helper (Th2) cells [16]. In
congenic Lewis rats, the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to disease susceptibility and modulation of target tissue responses were characterized. In
contrast, immunization of marmoset monkeys with CNS
tissue homogenates or recombinant MOG provided a disease model closely mimicking humoral disease patterns of
MS in a species that is phylogenetically very close to man
[17,18]. Like in rats, pathogenic mechanisms include the
contributions of encephalitogenic T cells and demyelinating autoantibodies [19]. While the investigation of marmoset EAE is somewhat limited by ethical issues as well as
a fulminant disease course and lack of suitable markers in
this species, this model may be of particular interest for
pre-clinical treatment studies and imaging approaches.
In mice, MOG protein or MOG35-55 peptide can induce
EAE in C57BL/6 mice or Biozzi ABH mice resulting in a
relapsing-remitting or chronic disease course. In the
C57BL/6 mouse strain, the H-2b MHC haplotype governs
the ability to induce encephalitogenicity and to develop
demyelinating autoantibodies in response to mouse or rat
MOG. Transfer of these demyelinating anti-MOG antibodies also enhances demyelination and exacerbates disease severity in mouse models of EAE [8]. Over the last 15
years, the avenue of genetically engineered mice has
greatly promoted the investigation of EAE pathomechanisms, particularly after backcrossing strains on the
C57BL/6 background. Today, MOG-EAE in the C57BL/6
mouse is one of the most widely used models in neuroimmunological research with over 100 publications in recent
years.

In summary, EAE models mimic many of the clinical, neuropathological and immunological aspects of MS but
none is able to reproduce the whole spectrum of the
human disease. In particular, many of the classical EAE
models mainly affect the spinal cord (and not the brain)
and are especially based on CD4 positive T cells, while the
recently recognized importance of CD8 positive T cells in
autoimmune inflammation of the CNS remains largely
scotomized. So far, a model for the primary progressive
course of the disease is still lacking and induction of EAE
results in extensive tissue damage (including axons and
neurons) rather than in primary demyelination. Nevertheless, the data from EAE studies still provide the most
important cue for the notion of MS as an autoimmune
disease where myelin specific cells initiate an inflammatory reaction in the CNS which ultimately leads to demyelination, gliosis and axonal injury.

EAE models contribute to unveiling the
immunopathogenesis of MS
Research in EAE first focused on the adaptive immune system including T and B cell responses. Recently, components of the innate immune system, in particular
macrophages, microglia, Toll-like receptors and even mast
cells, have also been recognized as important parts of disease pathogenesis [20,21]. In particular, the roles of vessel-associated dendritic cells for the re-activation of T cells
in situ and of microglia for the development and maintenance of inflammatory CNS lesions have been highlighted [22,23]. Another recent focus is on B lymphocytes.
Besides production of demyelinating antibodies after differentiation into plasma cells (see also above), B cells may
have a co-stimulatory function for T cell effectors, but can
also play a regulatory role [24,25].
The pivotal role of T lymphocytes in disease induction was
confirmed by adoptive transfer of autoantigen specific T
cells [26]. Later on, the importance of antigen-presenting
cells (APC) governing T cell responses was recognized.
Professional APC, like dendritic cells (DC), are characterized by a complete repertoire of co-stimulatory molecules
like CD28/B7, inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS)/
ICOS-L, and programmed death (PD)1/PD-1/2L thus
enabling them to fully activate naive T cells, but also to
regulate this activation (for overview see [27]. In contrast,
non-professional APC, like macrophages, microglia or
astrocytes, can upregulate the expression of immune molecules upon stimulation that facilitate activation only of
memory, but not naive T cells. Recently, the special
importance of perivascular DC for the reactivation of antigen specific T cells and their entry into the target organ
was highlighted and DC may also present a valuable target
for therapies as shown after intracerebral injection [28].

http://www.etsmjournal.com/content/1/1/5

During T cell activation, the production of cytokines and
chemokines influences the local microenvironment and
finally determines the functional outcome of the immune
response. In a classical paradigm, IFN-γ results in the differentiation of naive CD4 positive T cells into a "proinflammatory Th1" effector T cell subset which may initiate
autoimmunity in the CNS [29]. In contrast, the "Th2"
cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, or IL-13 induce the differentiation of naive T cells into "Th2" T cells which are
able to counterbalance the inflammatory reaction in the
CNS. Only recently, the importance of IL-23 and not IL-12
for perpetuation of the immune response in EAE was recognized. This concept was further refined by the characterization of IL-17 producing "Th17" cells which seem to
play a role for EAE induction in addition to "Th1" cells.
While this concept was first established in rodents, a role
for Th17 was recently also described in humans in vitro
and in situ [30,31]. The generation of Th17 cells requires
the presence of the "proinflammatory" cytokine IL-6 in
concert with the "regulatory" cytokine transforming
growth factor (TGF)-β, whereas IL-23 is involved in their
maintenance [32]. An alternative pathway for the differentiation of Th17 cells may be induced by IL-21 [33]. In
fact, cytokine regulation may involve complex networks
rather than linear pathways. This notion is further corroborated by the involvement of the IL-18 receptor pathway
in the generation of IL-17 responses [34]. Moreover, some
T cell clones may be capable of producing both interferon
gamma and IL-17, while IL-22 seems to be more specific
for Th17 cells [35]. Some studies point at the importance
of Th17 cells as part of the first wave of T cell infiltration
into the CNS which may be mediated by specific chemokines and their receptors like CCR6 and CCL20 [36]. While
IL-17 promotes autoimmunity by triggering a positivefeedback loop via interleukin-6 induction [37], other
reports also found that Th17 cells are not in all cases necessary for the propagation of EAE [38]. Some recent data
rather point at the importance of the transcription factor
T-bet for governing encephalitogenicity of myelin-specific
T cells rather than pathway specific cytokines such as IFNγ or IL-17 [39]. Finally, Th9 cells entered the stage as most
recent effector T cells. In vitro, this population is generated by a combination of IL-4 and TGF-β [40]. Besides IL9, these cells also produce IL-10 and contribute to tissue
inflammation like colitis or, as shown recently, also
autoimmune inflammation of the CNS [41]. A further
level of complexity was introduced by the identification of
further leukocyte subtypes which can be involved in disease pathogenesis. In some models, pathogenic neuroantigen-specific Th2 T cell responses or neutrophilic as well
as eosinophilic granulocytes as effector cells may be
involved in tissue damage [42,43]. Moreover, mast cells
produce IL-9 and thus may play a role in regulating T cell
tolerance and in modulating the course of EAE [21,44].

The invasion of all these immune cells into the CNS
requires transmigration over the blood brain barrier.
Here, a complex molecular interaction takes place
between adhesion molecules on the surface of immune
cells and the cerebral endothelial cells forming the blood
brain barrier [45,46]. These molecular interactions have
been extensively studied in the 1990s. In particular, the
interaction between the integrins very late antigen (VLA)
4 and leukocyte function associated antigen (LFA) 1 with
their immunoglobulin-like counter-ligands vascular cell
adhesion molecule (VCAM) 1 and intercellular adhesion
molecule (ICAM) 1 was shown to be essential for T cell
adhesion and migration into the central nervous system
[47,48]. Recently, proteomic based approaches defined an
important function for the activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) in the recruitment of leukocytes
into the brain [49]. Meanwhile, many studies point to a
role of the brain endothelium not only as barrier, but also
as active immunomodulator involved in DC polarization
and Th17 signaling pathways [50].
While Th17 cells promote autoimmune tissue inflammation, several regulatory cell types contribute to the delicate
balance between autoimmunity and immunoregulation.
In EAE, a regulatory role was first established for CD8 positive effector cells [51] and later also natural killer (NK)/
NK-T cells [52]. Most recent work indicated that particularly regulatory T cells (Treg) characterized by the presence
of the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor family
member FoxP3 are necessary and sufficient to prevent
autoimmunity both in rodents and in man. Interestingly,
Th17 cells and FoxP3 positive Treg seem to be dichotomously regulated by TGF-β, which induces FoxP3 in naive
T cells, but together with IL-6 drives the generation of
Th17 cells [32]. In rat EAE, polyclonal expansion of Treg
prevents transmigration of encephalitogenic T cells into
the CNS [53]. In a murine model, naturally occurring
FoxP3 positive Treg expand in the peripheral immune
organs and also accumulate in the central nervous system
(CNS), but then do not prevent the onset of EAE [54].
Thus, therapeutic approaches strengthening regulatory
mechanisms may be more promising when additional
regimens control tissue inflammation in parallel.

Histopathology of EAE reflects many aspects of
MS
Classical histopathological changes in MS lesions comprise perivascular inflammation, demyelination and gliosis in the white matter. Over the past 10 years, this concept
has been refined and axonal injury, cortical demyelination as well as neuronal changes have come into the focus
of interest. In acute demyelinating MS lesions, distinct
patterns have been described pointing to patient-specific
mechanisms of demyelination. In this classification, pattern I is characterized by the presence of T cells and mac-

http://www.etsmjournal.com/content/1/1/5

rophages and pattern II by antibody and complement
deposition. In contrast, patterns III and IV are mediated
by primary OL damage. In pattern III, an ischemic mechanism leading to loss of MAG, but not of MOG immunoreactivity, was postulated [55]. So far, EAE models
predominantly reflect patterns I and II. In particular, antibody and complement deposition are detected in MOGEAE lesions of marmosets and rats which are reminiscent
of pattern II pathology [56]. In contrast, MOG-EAE in the
C57BL/6 mouse results in less well demarcated demyelination which, after immunization with the T cell epitope
MOG 35-55, is independent of humoral immune
responses as revealed in μMT mice lacking mature B cells
[57] and in models with deficiency for the complement
component C3 or the C5a receptor [58,59]. Although the
exact mode of demyelination in this model remains to be
determined, myelin damage seems to be critically dependent on the presence of macrophages and possibly also
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. To evoke a significant B
cell response in C57BL/6 mice, immunization with whole
recombinant MOG protein is preferred. Studies on the
role of antibodies may also involve co-transfer
approaches. Here, a role for complement activation, but
not FcRγ receptors on phagocytes, could be delineated for
antibody mediated demyelination [60].
To a large extent, inflammatory demyelination in MOGEAE is paralleled by apoptotic loss of OL in the lesions
[61]. Thus, oligodendroglial repopulation may constitute
an important prerequisite for myelin repair. Indeed, OL
precursor cells have been identified in the rodent and
human adult CNS (for review see [62]). In different experimental models of demyelination including EAE, oligodendroglial cells are recruited, proliferate and can
differentiate into mature OL [63]. Here, glial growth factors as well as the re-expression of developmentally regulated oligodendroglial pathways, including expression of
potassium channels like Kv1.4, may be relevant [64]. Yet,
in murine MOG-EAE lesions, repair is largely incomplete
resulting in an accumulation of lesions over time which
correlates with persistent disability of mice. Thus, mechanisms of remyelination are preferably studied in toxic
models of demyelination including the application of
cuprizone, lysolecithine or ethidium bromide (for review
see [65]).
In recent years, further research focused on the presence of
grey matter demyelination in the cortex. Although this
specific feature is not predominant in murine MOG-EAE,
cortical demyelination was well characterized in a focal
model of rat MOG-EAE [66] and in some Lewis rat strains
(LEW.1AR1 and LEW.1W strains, [67]).
With the avenue of confocal and magnetic resonance
imaging techniques, the importance of axonal damage re-

entered the stage in neuroimmunological research [68]. In
rat MOG-EAE models, patterns of axonal damage and, in
some settings, also neuronal injury, were characterized
[69,70]. After immunization with recombinant MOG,
axonal damage was observed in the white matter of marmoset monkeys [17] and, in focal EAE models, also in the
cortex of susceptible rat strains [66]. Investigation of
axonal damage in chronic rat EAE and murine PLP-EAE
underscored the concept that loss of axons may in particular correlate with permanent disability [71]. In murine
MOG-EAE, axonal loss occurred early in lesions of white
matter, but also in the grey matter of the spinal cord. At
the later disease stages, disseminated axonal loss including the normal appearing white matter correlated with
persistent disability [72]. Further studies in murine models were mainly performed in genetically engineered mice.
Mice with a deficiency of the axonoprotective neurotrophic cytokine ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)
exhibited a more severe course of MOG-EAE with
enhanced myelin and axonal pathology [61]. In a Thy1GFP transgenic mouse model, patterns of axonal damage
were directly characterized by fluorescent labelling of
axon tracts in the spinal cord [73]. A focal EAE model in
rats also allows the investigation of axonal remodelling in
defined tracts [74]. In the near future, an elegant combination of these approaches in combination with 2-photon microscopy will be feasible in living animals [75].
Different mechanisms contribute to axonal damage during autoimmune demyelination (for overview see [76]).
Among others, candidates include TNF-α mediated cytotoxicity, Fas-FasL interaction or glutamate excitotoxicity.
Moreover, interaction of cytotoxic CD8 positive T cells
with up-regulated major histocompatibility complex
(MHC)-I on axons may play a role [77] although mice
lacking MHC-I exhibit significant amounts of APP positive axons [78]. In several recent studies, altered expression of ion channels were implicated in axonal injury
which may involve the sodoim channels Nav 1.2 or
Nav1.6 [72] or the Ca2+ and Na+ permeable acid-sensing
ion channel-1 [79]. Finally, EAE models allow investigation not only of axonal injury, but also of recovery and
axonoprotection [80]. Recent studies focused on the role
of the wlds fusion protein as an endogenous axonal protection mechanism [81] while some earlier studies in
rodents
characterized
neuroprotective
treatment
approaches, like blocking of glutamate receptors [82].
Moreover, blocking of sodium channels may provide an
attractive new therapeutic option (among others, see
[83]), although expression of these channels in the
immune system may somewhat limit these approaches
and first studies in MS were reportedly not successful.

The value of experimental models for imaging
studies and innovative therapies
EAE models may not only serve for the characterization of
immunological and neurobiological mechanisms, but
can also be valuable for the pre-clinical testing of new
diagnostic or treatment modalities. Different magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been
employed to depict EAE lesions in rat brains, including
contrast enhancement with gadolinium or ultra small
iron particles [84], which allow macrophage tracking [85].
While most investigations focused on MBP-EAE models,
some recent studies also investigated MOG-EAE in rats
[86], marmosets [87] and also murine EAE models [88].
Yet imaging of spinal cord is still not satisfactory with routine protocols, and is only feasible with high-resolution
techniques [89]. Advanced MR protocols may also include
diffusion tensor imaging which is able to detect selective
vulnerability of cerebral white matter in murine EAE [90].
More sophisticated protocols even allow imaging on a
molecular level. These techniques include ultrasound
based approaches which are able to depict and quantify
adhesion molecules in living EAE rats with an axial resolution in the μm range [91]. Similarly, antibody-conjugated microparticles carrying iron oxide can provide
quantifiable MRI contrast effects that delineate the architecture of activated cerebral blood vessels [92].
Regarding treatment approaches, many established
present-day MS therapies like glatiramer acetate as well as
natalizumab stem from their first successful application in
EAE models. Yet a plethora of new therapeutic approaches
are effective in animal models, but have failed in human
trials. Well known failures include anti-TNF therapies in
MS patients [93] as well as the application of superagonistic anti-CD28 antibodies in healthy volunteers [94]. In
case of the anti-TNF studies, negative results in patients
were better understood when data from knockout mouse
models became available which revealed a beneficial role
for TNF-α in apoptotic clearance of T cells from inflammatory lesions [95]. Even though a thorough characterization of CD28 superagonistic antibody therapy in animal
models of both peripheral and CNS inflammation [96,97]
as well as later on also with live imaging of immune
organs [98] was performed, this did not foresee the multiple cytokine release syndrome leading to severe side
effects in a human phase I study. These failures call for the
highest possible awareness with new therapies in human
beings. EAE experiments cannot substitute for, but are
rather complementary to, human clinical studies, and
maximum safety standards during the first application of
new compounds in patients must always apply. Yet, if
interpreted correctly and chosen with care, EAE models
can provide useful information, and sometimes may
avoid complications which delay drug development or
pose a threat to patients. In particular, EAE models may

Experimental & Translational Stroke Medicine 2009, 1:5

help to elucidate mechanisms of action for new MS therapies. One example is fumarate (FAE) therapy in MS, currently being tested in a human phase III trial. In the
human skin disease psoriasis, FAE was shown to be effective via a Th1/Th2 shift. Yet, in EAE, FAE seems to exert
effects on macrophages [99] and possibly also to harbour
neuroprotective effects. Since other regenerative treatment
approaches for MS are still a long way ahead, the best neuroprotective approach still consists in effective immunotherapy. This can be convincingly shown in treatment of
rat MOG-EAE with liposomal steroids which effectively
deplete phagocytes, modulate T cells and at the same time
preserve axons in inflammatory lesions [100].

Future developments and new strategies
Future directions include EAE studies in conditional
knockout mice to carve out the contribution of single
molecules to the induction or effector phase of EAE. First
studies used the Cre loxP system to conditionally delete
genes involved in nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling
pathways (EAE in CNS-restricted NEMO knockout mice,
[101]). Together with the generation of bone marrow chimeras, these techniques provide powerful tools to dissect
mechanisms during autoimmune inflammation of the
CNS. Other innovative approaches include the immunization of Lewis rats with alpha synuclein leading to grey
matter pathology which recently came into the focus of
interest [102]. In the grey matter, also contactin2/TAG-1
mediated autoimmunity was recently characterized as
contributing to cortical damage [103].
Moreover, the characterization of neurofascin as a novel
autoantigen on axons at the node of Ranvier [104] and the
identification of a protective role for the candidate astroglial autoantigen αβ crystallin in autoimmune demyelination [105] shed further light on non-myelin proteins as
targets in disease pathogenesis. Further strategies are aiming at the implementation of models for aspects of MS
which are not well mimicked in EAE paradigms so far.
These efforts include studies on CD8 positive T cells
which are a major component of the inflammatory infiltrate in chronic MS lesions [106]. In fact, several
approaches in mice demonstrated that CD8 positive T
lymphocytes also harbor an encephalitogenic potential
[107-109] and are able to attack and transect MHC class I
expressing axons in an antigen-specific manner. Recently,
an elegant viral model studying cytotoxic T cells in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection demonstrated that two related, but independently
encountered, viral infections can lead to organ-specific
immune disease without molecular mimicry or breaking
immune tolerance [110].
CD8 T cell restricted autoimmune reactions can also be
studied after conditional expression of MHC-I as shown

http://www.etsmjournal.com/content/1/1/5

in the muscle [111] or in double transgenic mice with
simultaneous an OL sequestered antigen like ovalbumin
or influenca hemagglutinin in the context of a respective
MHC-I restricted T cell receptor [112,113]. In such settings, monoclonal antibodies specific for MHC class I
molecules presenting a dominant autoantigen peptide
may allow selective immunotherapy [114]. Such transgenic approaches were also used to study CD4 T cell and
B cell mediated immune reactions. In genetically engineered mice exclusively harbouring an MBP specific T cell
receptor (TCR), EAE develops spontaneously with a high
incidence [115]. In a similar approach, MOG-TCR transgenic mice suffer from spontaneous autoimmune optic
neuritis to some degree [116]. In contrast, double transgenic mice with a MOG specific TCR and MOG-specific B
cells spontaneously develop a Devic like disease pattern
with lesions exclusively in the optic nerve and spinal cord,
thus nicely underscoring the cooperation of B cells and T
cells in the development of autoimmune inflammation
[117,118]. These spontaneously occurring models do not
require artificial immunization protocols with adjuvant
or pertussis toxin and are therefore of special value for
neuroimmunological studies. In this MOG TCR transgenic model, autoreactive T cells harbor a bi-specificity
and recognize their MOG epitope, but also neurofilament
M as self-antigen. Such cumulative responses against several autoantigens by one autoreactive T cell clone may
also contribute to pathogenicity in MS [119]. Whilst most
of these spontaneously occurring models lead to a chronic
disease course, a recently developed model with a transgenic MOG92-106 specific TCR in the context of an I-A(s)
background was also able to spontaneously mimic relapsing remitting disease course [120]. Further elegant tools
are humanized transgenic mice which can be used as tools
to study human T cell receptors (TCR) in experimental
models. This was first shown in a transgenic mouse model
for an MHC-II restricted TCR specific for MBP84-102
[121]. While the incidence of spontaneous EAE in this
model is low, immunization with a microbial peptide
results in induction of disease, which may be due to structural mimicry of a binding hotspot shared by self and
microbial antigens rather than to a degenerate TCR recognition [122]. Recently, such concepts were also analyzed
in a transgenic model harboring a myelin specific T cell
receptor of a CD8 T cell clone from a MS patient and the
respective MHC class I allele. In this model, CD 8 positive
T cells can exert disease promoting or protective functions,
depending on the MHC class I context [123].
So far, EAE models cover the spectrum of demyelination
patterns I and II, but they do not well reflect patterns III
and IV with primary OL dystrophy. Yet, this obstacle may
be overcome by the analysis of mutants with primary
demyelination due to a genetic defect. This was recently
suggested in a study of mice with peroxisome-deficient

OL. Here, a metabolic defect in myelin producing cells led
to demyelination and subsequently also CNS inflammation with infiltration of B cells and activated CD8 positive
T cells [124], similar to previous investigations in knockout models of PNS myelin [125].

Finally, all these data from EAE models may also promote
knowledge on immune reactions in other neurologic diseases, like infectious disorders of the CNS [126] or poststroke immunodepression [127].
