Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid
bacteria: an update
Zhi-Gang Zhang1†, Zhi-Qiang Ye1,3†, Li Yu2*, Peng Shi1*

Abstract
Background: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food
products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB
species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets.
Results: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome
sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved
tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group
1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and
Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the
acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus
complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were
clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five
species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus,
and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one
corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc
pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify
those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and
ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance
protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB).
Conclusions: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB
species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple,
independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further
analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular
mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.

Background
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are Gram-positive bacteria
that have been widely used as starter or nonstarter cultures in the plant, meat, and dairy fermentation, and also
as probiotic bacteria in human gastrointestinal tract

contributing to pathogen inhibition and immunomodulation. At present, nearly 400 LAB species have been recognized [1]. They are generally classified into four families
and seven genera, as follows: family Lactobacillaceae
(genera Lactobacillus and Pediococcus), family Leuconostocaceae (genera Oenococcus and Leuconostoc), family
Enterococcaceae (genus Enterococcus) and family Streptococcaceae (genera Lactococcus and Streptococcus) [2-4].
Phylogenetic relationships among the LAB species have
been hotly disputed. One of the foremost debates in LAB
phylogeny concerns the species in the genera Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc, which
belong to family Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae,

due to the severe disagreements arising from analyses of
different data sets [2-11]. In the genus Lactobacillus,
there are uncertainties about the interspecies affinities
within the acidophilus complex [8] that consists of five
species Lb. gasseri, Lb. johnsonii, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. helveticus and Lb. delbrueckii. In particular, the divergence
between Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii, Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. delbrueckii remains unresolved. Based on
the analyses of a 16 S rRNA gene and a few nuclear
genes [3,5,7,10,12] and that of 32 ribosomal proteins [9],
Lb. delbrueckii was found to be more closely associated
with Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus than with Lb. gasseri/
Lb. johnsonii. However, a recent study using 141 core
proteins from 17 LAB species suggested that Lb. delbrueckii diverged earliest within the acidophilus complex,
while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb.
johnsonii clustered into a sister group [8].
Although the paraphyly of Lactobacillus species is
well-established, a general consensus for the placement
of the Lactobacillus species, e.g., Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. sakei, and Lb. casei,
and their relationship to the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc has not yet emerged in the ‘salivarius’ subgroup. For example, in the analysis of four
subunits of RNA polymerase, the clade uniting Lb. sakei
and Lb. casei is placed at the most basal position, followed by Lb. salivarius. Pediococcus is sister to the clade
containing Lb. plantarum and Lb. brevis, while Oenococcus/Leuconostoc clusters with Lb. reuteri [7]. In contrast,
an analysis of 141 core proteins suggested that the Lb.
sakei/Lb. casei clade is more related to acidophilus complex, while the other Lactobacillus species and Pediococcus, Oenococcus, as well as Leuconostoc group together,
in which Oenococcus/Leuconostoc diverged earliest, followed by Lb. salivarius, Pediococcus, Lb. reuteri, and
lastly the species most recently diverged, Lb. plantarum
and Lb. brevis [8].
These findings highlight the need to gather and analyze larger sequence data sets in order to unravel the
phylogenetic relationships among LAB species and clarify specifically those within genera Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. The increasing
availability of LAB genome sequence data provides a
good opportunity to understand the evolutionary history
of LAB species. In the present study, we studied LAB
phylogeny by gathering and analyzing 232 orthologous
genes from 28 LAB genome sequences representing all
genera from four families. Our objectives were to provide new insights into the relationships of LAB species
and to examine the utility of such an analysis in the
context of LAB phylogeny, and develop new potential
genetic markers for study of LAB systematics. This
study not only contributes to clarifying the currently
obscure LAB species relationship, but also lays a

foundation for further studies on adaptive evolution of
LAB species in different environmental niches.

Results and Discussions
Identification of orthologous genes

The use of accurate and reliable methods for the identification of orthologous genes is essential for phylogenetic reconstruction based on analyses of large data sets,
especially for those using whole genome sequences [13].
In the present study, the strategy of developing potential
orthologous gene sets for LAB phylogenomic studies
was different from those used in previous LAB analyses.
First, in previous studies of LAB phylogeny, less stringent clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) [6] and
reciprocal best hits [8] methods were applied to identify
putative orthologs. Here, we applied both Inparanoid
[14] and MultiParanoid [15] programs to serve this purpose. Inparanoid [14] exploits a BLAST-based strategy
to identify orthologs as reciprocal best hits between two
species, and applies additional rules to accommodate inparalogs that arise from recent duplication events after
speciation. Compared with other methods, including
COGs [16] and OrthoMCL [17], Inparanoid’s superiority
lies in the ability to distinguish orthologs from in-paralogs and out-paralogs (those that arose via ancient
duplication event before speciation) [17-21]. MultiParanoid software [15] performs clustering of orthologs and
in-paralogs that are shared by more than two species.
By using the conservative searching algorithms, we
obtained a total of 310 one-to-one protein coding orthologs (Additional file 1 Table S1).
To make our dataset more conservative, we further
excluded potentially problematic orthologs such as those
with short sequence lengths and those involved in horizontal gene transfer (HGT). These criteria have not yet
been used in previous LAB studies. In the end, a total of
232 orthologous genes, including 225 genes that have
clear functional definition and 7 genes that have been
annotated as hypothetical proteins (Additional file 2
Table S2), were used to reconstruct LAB phylogeny in
this study. This dataset of 232 genes included those
encoding 135 out of the 141 core proteins of the Claesson’s study [8] that were identified by phylogenomic
analyses of 17 LAB species genomes. Noticeably, 6 core
proteins included in Claesson’s study [8] were discovered as in-paralogs here and hence excluded from
further analyses. This suggests that our dataset is more
conservative and reliable than those from previous studies aimed at inferring LAB phylogeny.
Reconstruction of LAB phylogenomic tree

Based on the concatenated amino acid alignment of 232
genes, phylogenetic analyses using two gap selection criteria (see Methods) and two tree-building methods,

Zhang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/1

partitioned maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses, yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology
with strong supports for all nodes (BS > 99% and PP >
0.99) (Figure 1), suggesting that the accuracy of our
phylogenetic inference is independent of tree-building
methods. As revealed in Figure 1 the monophyly for
families Leuconostocaceae, Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae were strongly supported. For Lactobacillaceae, some species were more closely related to
Leuconostocaceae than the other Lactobacillaceae species, supporting the paraphyly for family Lactobacillaceae, providing a possibility that Leuconostocaceae and
Lactobacillaceae can be combined into a family.
The LAB species were divided into two groups. Group
1 included Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group
2 included Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae.
Within Group 1, the monophyly of the genera

Enterococcus, Lactococcus and Streptococcus were
strongly supported. In Streptococcus, S. mutans and S.
thermophilus were grouped together, and S. gordonii was
their sister taxon. The relationships within Group 1
observed here were congruent with two other studies
[5,10], but disagreed with the 16 S rRNA gene tree [22]
(Figure 1). Within Group 2, LAB species were divided
into two clades. One clade composed of acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other Lactobacillus
species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. This result is in contradiction with the RNA polymerase-based study of Liu [7]
that suggested that Lb. sakei and Lb. casei are more closely related to other Lactobacillus species and the genera
Pediococcus, Oenococcus as well as Leuconostoc. However,
our results are in agreement with the RNA polymerase
trees [5,10], ribosomal-protein tree [9] and the 141-core
proteins tree [8]. Of the five recognized Lactobacillus

species in the acidophilus complex, our results strongly
support the notion that Lb. delbrueckii separated first,
while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb.
johnsonii clustered into a sister group. This finding is in
accordance with the result derived from the 141-core
proteins analyses [8], but disagrees with those derived the
single 16 S rRNA gene [3,8,12] and the nuclear gene analyses [5,7,10,23] as well as that of 32 ribosomal proteins
[9], in which Lb. delbrueckii was seen to be more closely
associated with Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus than Lb.
gasseri/Lb. johnsonii. Five Lactobacillus species, including
Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb.
fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and
Leuconostoc constitute the other clade, the ‘salivarius’
subgroup within Group 2. In this clade, Lb. salivarius
was positioned most basally, followed by two distinct
clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis
group and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc group and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum
group. The basal position of Lb. salivarius in this clade
is consistent with the RNA polymerase tree inferred by
Makarova and Koonin [5] as well as by Liu [7], but not
with the 16 S rRNA gene tree [12] and studies by
Claesson [8] and Cai [10] that indicated that Oenococcus/Leuconostoc group diverged first. In addition, the
grouping of Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis and Pediococcus
observed here is supported in most current studies, but
is in contradiction with the recent proposal of the connecting of Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis and Lb. reuteri. In
the present study, the close relatedness of Oenococcus/
Leuconostoc group and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum is in
agreement with RNA polymerase tree inferred by Liu et
al. [7]. The possible placement of Oenococcus/Leuconostoc group as the first diverging taxa [8,10] or as the
diverging taxa subsequent to Lb. salivarius [5] was not
supported here.
Taken together, our study provides new insights into
the evolutionary relationships of these LAB species, and
helps to resolve the current controversial issues in LAB
phylogeny. Depending on the gene segments or genomes
and the tree-building methods used, different phylogenetic hypotheses can be obtained. Interestingly, our study
demonstrated that different evolutionary rates among
sites may also affect LAB phylogenetic reconstruction.
When we repeated the phylogenetic analyses by setting a
fixed alpha value of gamma distribution in the optimal
amino acid substitution model, the species relationships
within acidophilus complex, i.e., that among Lb. gasseri/
Lb. johnsonii, Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. delbrueckii, became unstable and were poorly supported in
partitioned ML and Bayesian analyses (data not shown).
Therefore, our study revealed that different evolutionary
rate among sites is also an important factor in tracing the
evolutionary history of LAB species.

Besides the contribution of phylogenetic resolution,
our results revealed the presence of independent adaptation to four types of habitat niches in LAB species
(Figure 1), involving human gastrointestinal tract,
human oral flora, dairy fermentation and other fermentations of beer, wine, plants, or meat (Table 1). For
example, within acidophilus complex, Lb. acidophilus
that is isolated from human gastrointestinal tract and
Lb. helveticus that is widely applied to dairy fermentation are more closely related to each other than to the
other three Lactobacillus species, suggesting an independent adaptation to their respective niches. The independent adaptation events of Lb. plantarum to human
gastrointestinal tract were also evidenced by transcriptome analyses [24], although Lb. plantarum strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract or feces may be
derived from human diet and may in fact reflect earlier
adaption to other environmental niches such as fermentations of meat, plant, cheese or wine [25]. Otherwise,
Lb. brevis is most suitable for meat fermentation in our
phylogenetic tree. Given that strains of many LAB species occur in a multitude of ecological niches, further
analyses of more genes and functional assays of additional LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular
mechanisms underlying the adaptation of LAB species
to various environmental survival niches.
Utilities of different genes in LAB phylogeny

We also evaluated the phylogenetic utility of different
genes used here. According to COG annotation [16], we
classified 232 genes into four functional categories
(Additional file 2 Table S2) relating to: information storage and processing (ISP; 135 genes), cellular processes
and signaling (CPS; 49 genes), metabolism (41 genes),
and hypothetical proteins (HP; 7 genes). Among them,
the genes with ISP function were further divided into
translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB;
69 genes), replication/repair/recombination (RRR; 51
genes), and transcription (15 genes). The phylogenetic
analyses of LAB were repeated using each of the above
six categories of genes individually. Our results suggested that the analyses of RRR (Figure 2), transcription
(Figure 3), CPS (Figure 4), metabolism (Figure 5) and
HP (Figure 6) genes produced different tree topologies
from that of all concatenated genes (Figure 1), while the
analyses of TRSB genes yielded identical tree topologies
to those shown in Figure 1 suggesting that the TRSB
genes are better indicators of LAB phylogeny than are
other subsets of genes. The Robinson-Foulds distances
analysis (Additional file 3 Table S3) also showed that
there are no differences between the tree of TRSB genes
and that of all concatenated genes. The differences
among tree topologies based on these functional categories can be caused by various factors, including

different selective constraints imposed by the functional
categories that were involved in various metabolic
networks [26-31].
Ranking single genes in six function categories by
their respective phylogenetic resolution to LAB species
reveals that 3 of 232 genes, including the ultra-violet
resistance protein B gene (uvrB) and the DNA polymerase III gene (polC) from RRR category, and the penicillin
binding protein 2B gene (pbpB) from CPS category
(Additional file 2 Table S2), produced ML tree topology
(Additional file 4 Figure S1a-1c) that was largely consistent with that of the complete analyses (Figure 1), albeit
with low supports for some branches (BS < 70%). When
we conducted the phylogenetic analyses by combining
the three genes, a completely identical tree topology to
that shown in Figure 1 with high supports for most of
nodes was obtained. Therefore, a combined analysis
using uvrB, polC and pbpB together seems to be a better
indicator for inferring LAB phylogeny than the other
subset of genes including the ribosomal protein families
or RNA polymerase subunits that have been widely used

in previous LAB phylogenetic studies [5-7,9,10]. The
Robinson-Foulds distances analysis (Additional file 3
Table S3) also showed that there are no differences
between the tree of combined uvrB, polC and pbpB
genes and that of all concatenated genes. In the present
study, the assessment of phylogenetic utility and limits
of the individual genes makes it possible to preselect
subsets of genes for future molecular studies of LAB
phylogeny when the complete genome sequences are
unavailable.

Conclusions
In this study, phylogenetic relationships among LAB
species are presented based on 232 genes from 28 LAB
genome sequences. The concatenation of all these genes
allowed the recovery of a strongly supported phylogeny,
providing a maximum and decisive resolution of the
relationships among the LAB species examined. Our
phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into
not only LAB phylogeny, but also the phylogenetic utility of different genes suggesting that the genes relating

mechanisms underlying the adaptation of LAB species
to various environmental survival niches.

Identification of one-to-one orthologs for LAB
phylogenetic inference

Based on protein coding genes (pseudogenes are not
included) downloaded from 28 LAB and one B. subtilis
genome sequences, a search for orthologs was conducted with the program Inparanoid version 2.0 [14].
Several stringent criteria were employed: (1) using a
BLAST score cut-off of 50 bits; (2) using an overlap

cut-off of 50%; (3) using a confidence value of 95%
when searching in-paralogs; (4) using BLOSUM45
amino acid substitution matrix [45]. Automatic clustering of orthologs and inparalogs identified by the program Inparanoid was then performed by program
Multiparanoid [15].
Among the candidate orthologous genes selected as
above, we excluded those that met the following criteria

a total of 232 orthologous genes, including 225 that
have clear functional definition and 7 that have been
annotated to be hypothetical proteins, were used to
reconstruct LAB phylogeny in this study (Additional file
2 Table S2).

Phylogenetic Reconstruction of LAB species

In total 232 orthologous genes were concatenated into
two supermatrices according to two gap selection criteria in Gblocks [allowed gap positions = none (61,020
amino acids in length) and with half (only positions
where 50% or more of the sequences have a gap are
treated as a gap position in the final alignment) (63,910
amino acids in length)] [46]. Optimal substitution models were selected by using the program ProtTest version
2.4 [47] according to Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) [48]. The selected substitution models were used

in partitioned Bayesian analysis implemented MrBayes
v3.2.1 [49-51] and partitioned maximum likelihood
(ML) analysis implemented in RAxML v7.0.4 [52]. The
reliability of ML tree topology was evaluated by bootstrapping sampling (BP) of 1000 replicates. For Bayesian
analyses, three independent runs of one-million generations each were used. The trees sampled prior to reaching convergence were discarded as burn-in and the

remaining trees were used to construct the consensus
tree and posterior probabilities (PP).
Tree topology comparison

The differences between tree topologies were compared using Robinson-Foulds distances that were calculated with program Treedist from the PHYLIP v3.69
package [53].
