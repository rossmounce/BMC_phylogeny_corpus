Abstract
Background: Vertebrate genomes contain numerous duplicate genes, many of which are
organised into paralagous regions indicating duplication of linked groups of genes. Comparison of
genomic organisation in different lineages can often allow the evolutionary history of such regions
to be traced. A classic example of this is the Hox genes, where the presence of a single continuous
Hox cluster in amphioxus and four vertebrate clusters has allowed the genomic evolution of this
region to be established. Fox transcription factors of the C, F, L1 and Q1 classes are also organised
in clusters in both amphioxus and humans. However in contrast to the Hox genes, only two
clusters of paralogous Fox genes have so far been identified in the Human genome and the
organisation in other vertebrates is unknown.
Results: To uncover the evolutionary history of the Fox clusters, we report on the comparative
genomics of these loci. We demonstrate two further paralogous regions in the Human genome,
and identify orthologous regions in mammalian, chicken, frog and teleost genomes, timing the
duplications to before the separation of the actinopterygian and sarcopterygian lineages. An
additional Fox class, FoxS, was also found to reside in this duplicated genomic region.
Conclusion: Comparison of loci identifies the pattern of gene duplication, loss and cluster break
up through multiple lineages, and suggests FoxS1 is a likely remnant of Fox cluster duplication.

Background
The Fox genes are members of the forkhead/winged helix
family of transcription factors, characterised by a 110
amino acid DNA binding domain [1]. Fox genes have
been identified in the genomes of animals and fungi, but
not plants. Animals appear to have more Fox genes than
fungi, with four genes identified in Saccharomyces and
Schizosaccharomyces, at least 15 in the cnidarian sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, 17 in Drosophila melanogaster,
29 in Ciona intestinalis and over 40 in the human and
other vertebrate genomes [1-4]. Phylogenetic analysis of
the forkhead domains has lead to placement of most of
these genes into 20 subclasses named FoxA to FoxS, with a

small number of 'orphan' genes of unclear relationships
defying classification [5,6]. These studies show vertebrate
genomes contain more Fox genes than the genomes of
other animals, suggesting an expansion that mirrors the
increase in gene numbers seen for other gene families [7].
Two competing theories for how this increase in gene
number took place are that two whole genome duplications (WGD; referred to as the 2R hypothesis) occurred
early in the vertebrate lineage [8,9], or that continuous
gene duplications occurred throughout vertebrate evolution [10-14]. The 2R hypothesis predicts that a 1:4 ratio of
genes should have been present in an ancestral vertebrate
when compared to an invertebrate, and that in molecular

phylogenetic trees these paralogues would adopt a specific
topology reflecting the history of duplication [11]. While
the identification of blocks of paralogous genes has been
interpreted as evidence in favour of WGD [15-24], paralagous gene sets often adopt different topologies [11], and
multiple independent duplications could also explain the
observed data.
Previously it has been reported that the human representatives of four Fox subclasses, FoxC, FoxF, FoxL1 and FoxQ1,
are localised to two small regions of the human genome;
specifically, the genes FOXC2, FOXF1 and FOXQ1 are
found on chromosome 6 within 70 kb, while the genes
FOXL1, FOXC1, FOXF2 are found on chromosome 16
within 300 kb [1,25,26]. Recently, we have shown that the
amphioxus orthologues of these genes are found clustered
in one region of the amphioxus genome, suggesting block
duplication of this region in the vertebrates underlies the
evolution of the chromosome 6 and 16 loci [25]. Under
the 2R hypothesis, however, four such loci would be predicted. This discrepancy could be explained by gene loss.
To investigate this, we carried out a detailed comparative
genomic survey of the human chromosome 6 and 16 Fox
cluster loci. Genes around each locus were identified, and
their evolutionary history established by database
searches and molecular phylogenetics. This revealed two
additional human loci containing genes paralagous to
those found adjacent to the clustered Fox genes. All four
loci were then compared to the genomes of other vertebrates, including other mammals and Xenopus tropicalis,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/271

Gallus gallus, Fugu rubripes, Danio rerio and Tetraodon nigroviridis. This allowed us to identify orthologous regions in
all these animal genomes, and to show teleost genomes
have undergone further duplications. By comparing these
loci, we are now able to establish the pattern of clustered
Fox gene duplication and loss through multiple vertebrate
lineages. Furthermore, a previously orphan gene, FoxS1,
was identified as a likely remnant of cluster duplication.

Results
Identification of human Fox cluster paralogons
Gene maps pertaining to this section are summarised in
Figure 1. Our searches identified 5 gene families that
showed evidence of genomic co-localisation with the Fox
clusters; the Neighbour of COX (NOC) genes, the Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit 4 (COX4) genes, the Dual Specificity Phosphatase (DUSP) genes, the Interferon
Regulatory Factor (IRF) genes and the Myosin Light Chain
Kinase (MLCK) genes. Phylogenetic analyses of these families are shown in Additional Files 1 and 2. To summarise,
the NOC genes are found on the chromosome 16 and 14
(NOC4 and NOC9) and the COX4 genes are found on
chromosome 16 and 20 (COX4I1 and COX4I2 respectively) though their exact positions relative to the other
genes differ. DUSP genes are found next to the chromosome 6 and 20 clusters (DUSP22 and DUSP15). Each
locus on chromosome 6, 20, 16 and 14 contains an IRF
gene (IRF4, IRF10, IRF8 and IRF9 respectively). The MLCK
genes are found by the chromosome 6 (MLCKF2) and 20
(MLCK2) clusters while a third gene, MLCKF1 is found on
chromosome 16, though this last gene is not tightly linked

to the rest of the cluster (and hence is not shown on Figure
1). Furthermore, another Fox gene, FOXS1, which has
been previously regarded as an orphan [5,6], was identified adjacent to IRF10 on chromosome 20. We therefore
conclude regions of chromosomes 14 and 20 shown in
Figure 1 are the likely remaining paralogous genomic
regions (paralogons) of the chromosome 6 and 16 Fox
cluster regions.
Orthologous paralogons in mammals, chicken, Xenopus
and teleosts
Conserved genomic regions to the four human loci
described above were identified in the M. musculus, X.
tropicalis, G. gallus, F. rubripes, D. rerio and T. nigroviridis
genomes. These are summarised in Figure 2. We also
examined chimp, dog and cow genomes. Gene organisation appeared similar to that in mouse and human
(within the limits of the quality of genome assembly for
these species; data not shown), and hence we have omitted them from the following sections. Further details of
the phylogenetic analyses that confirm orthology and paralogy relationships are shown in the additional files that
accompany this report. Below, we summarise the salient
features of each orthologous set. In addition to the paralagous genes described in humans above, we also utilised
other genes present in these genomic regions to re-enforce
evidence of orthology.
Genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome 6
This region consists of DUSP22, IRF4, EXCO2, FOXQ1,
FOXF2, FOXC1, GMDS and MLCKF2. Genomic regions
orthologous to human chromosome 6 are summarised in
Figure 2A. A region of mouse chromosome 13 (and of
chimp chromosome 6 and dog chromosome 35, data not
shown) showed the order and intergenic distance of these
genes to be comparable in these mammals. In the chicken,
a region of chromosome 2 is orthologous to the same
region, and includes the linked FOXF2 and FOXQ1 genes.
A chicken FOXC1 gene was identified in a previous study
[27], however its genomic position is currently unknown.
We also note a large gap in the sequence between chicken
FOXF2 and GMDS, and suggest chicken FOXC1 may
reside here. In X. tropicalis this region is contained on two
scaffolds; dusp22, irf4 and exco5 are on scaffold 211, and
foxq1, foxf2, foxc1, gmds and mlckf2 on scaffold 95. High
quality sequence is present for 150 kb and 230 kb past the
final genes on each respective scaffold. However, as the
gap between Exoc2 and FoxQ1 can exceed 500 kb in mammals, this does not preclude the linkage of these regions
in the X. tropicalis genome.

A region in the D. rerio genome was identified on chromosome 20, extending from irf4 to mlckf2 and included identical gene organisation but relatively small intergenic
distances when compared to tetrapods. foxq1, foxf2 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/271

foxc1b are present in the expected positions. An additional
contig containing linked irf4, and dusp22 orthologs was
also identified. In the T. nigroviridis genome, two Fox clusters orthologous to human chromosome 6 were identified, one on chromosome 15 (extending from foxq1 to
mlckf2) and one on unassigned scaffold 14546. An additional unassigned scaffold contains irf4a and dusp22, and
could also be part of the chromosome 15 region as
sequence quality is low adjacent to foxq1. This is supported by the F. rubripes arrangement, in which the orthologous genes are found on one scaffold.
In summary, we found evidence for single genomic
regions orthologous to the Fox cluster region of human
chromosome 6 in tetrapods, while in teleost fish we found
evidence for the presence of two such regions, in keeping
with the additional genome duplication proposed to have
occurred in this lineage [28-31].
Genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome 20
This region consists of DUSP15, IRF10, FOXS1, MLCK2,
TPX2, BCL2 and COX4I2. Genomic regions orthologous
to human chromosome 20 are summarised in Figure 2B.
A region of mouse chromosome 2 (and of chimp chromosome 20, cow chromosome 13 and dog chromosome 24,
data not shown) showed the order and intergenic distance
of these genes to be comparable in these mammals. An
exception is that no Irf10 gene was identified in this
region of the mouse genome. In the chicken a single
orthologous region was identified on chromosome 20,
and included a FOXS1 orthologue. However we were unable to identify a COX4I2 gene. In X. tropicalis, two scaffolds (1295 and 95) were identified as orthologous to this
human region; these do not overlap in gene content,
hence we infer they derive from one region of orthology.
foxs1 was not found in the X. tropicalis genome.

Evidence for orthologous regions in teleost genomes is
weaker. A tenuous orthology region may exist in the D.
rerio genome, as bcl2 and cox4 genes exhibit tight linkage
on chromosome 23. An irf10 orthologue is also on chromosome 23, but at 44.65 Mb from the other genes, this
linkage is unlikely to be significant. In T. nigroviridis and
F. rubripes, we were only able to identify irf10 orthologues.
Genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome 16
This region contains PSF2, NOC4, COX4I1, IRF8, FOXF1,
FLJ12998, FOXC2 and FOXL1. Genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome 16 are summarised in Figure
2C. Investigation of mammalian genomes showed
regions of chromosome 8 of the mouse (and of chimp
chromosome 16, cow chromosome 18 and dog chromosome 5, data not shown) to be comparable in gene order
and intergenic distance to the genes on human chromosome 16. Chromosome 11 of the chicken genome has a

lines at the site of inversions. Double vertical red lines indicate separate contigs that we placed on a line due to their gene content; this does not imply they have been shown to be physically linked. Dashed boxes represent presence of a gene but no linkage information. Black circles indicate scaffold ends.

region orthologous to human chromosome 16, comprising of PSF2, NOC4, COX4I1, IRF8 and FOXF1. However
part of this region is inverted in comparison to mammalian genomes. Similarity past FOXF1 extends to a region
containing FLJ12998, which is found between FOXF1 and
FOXC2 in the human genome. A chicken FOXL1 is yet to
be identified, however the sequence quality upstream of
FoxF1 in the chicken genome is poor.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/271

genome contains an irf9, noc9, psme2 orthology group on
chromosome 20, with an inversion between irf9 and
psme2. A second region on chromosome 12 includes a
noc9 gene linked to a psme2 gene. The T. nigroviridis and F.
rubripes genomes also contain a single region including
irf9, noc9 and psme2, but with an inversion between noc9
and psme2.

Discussion
Orthologous regions in the X. tropicalis genome are recovered from three separate scaffolds: s188 containing psf2,
noc4, cox4I1 and a dusp family member. s120 contains irf8,
foxf1 and flj12998 and s181 contains the foxc2 and foxl1
genes. Truncation of scaffolds 188 and 120 at the irf8 end
do not preclude close linkage, however good sequence
quality past flj12998 and before foxc2 suggest these
regions, if linked, are minimally 3.5 Mb apart.
In D. rerio, an orthologous region on chromosome 18
matches the human arrangement from psf2 to a region
with similarity to flj12998 with the exceptions that D. rerio
(like X. tropicalis but unlike chicken and mammals) also
has a dusp gene in this region, and that irf8 is absent and
instead found on a contig yet to be assigned to a chromosome. Sequence quality past foxf1 appears to be high,
however no foxc2 has been found in the genome of these
teleosts. foxc2 is present in the basal Actinopterygian A.
calva (see additional files), showing loss of foxc2 to be specific to teleosts. A foxl1 gene has been identified on chromosome 14. The arrangement in T. nigroviridis and F.
rubripes is similar except irf8 is included in these clusters.

Human paralogons and orthologous regions in other
vertebrates: gene duplication and gene loss
Here we report the results of a comparative analysis of vertebrate Fox cluster loci. First we identified four putative
paralogons in the human genome; on chromosome 6
(with DUSP22, IRF4, FOXQ1, FOXF2, FOXC1, MLCKF2
linkage); on chromosome 20 (with DUSP15, IRF10,
FOXS1, MLCK2, COX4I2 linkage); on chromosome 16
(with NOC4, COX4I1, IRF8, FOXF1, FOXC2, FOXL1 linkage); and on chromosome 14 (with NOC9, IRF9 linkage).
Of these, that on chromosome 14 has the weakest supporting evidence, though IRF gene phylogenetics and the
preservation of NOC9 and IRF9 linkage in other genomes
supports its status as a paralagous region.

In summary, we find good evidence for orthologous
regions to the human chromosome 16 Fox cluster region
in the genomes of tetrapods and teleosts. However teleosts appear to have split this region between flj12998 and
foxl1. An alternate explanation for this apparent split is
they are remnants of the proposed teleost tetraplody, with
reciprocal gene loss yielding non-overlapping gene sets.
Higher quality genome assemblies will be needed to distinguish between these possibilities.

We also identified putative orthologous regions in the
genomes of other vertebrates. Organisation in all mammals examined was very similar to that in human. In the
tetrapods G. gallus and X. tropicalis, gene organisation was
consistent with the ancestral tetrapod genome including a
single copy of all four regions [32]. Some lineage specific
changes are also inferred, and one paralogon is currently
missing in G. gallus. The situation in the teleost genomes
is more complex, with two putative orthologous regions
identified for some of the loci. The teleost lineage is
hypothesised to have undergone an additional genome
duplication [28-31], and the pattern of orthologous
regions we observed is consistent with this, though this
would imply significant gene loss from several duplicated
regions. Consistent with this we note that as high as 85%
gene loss have been suggested for the teleosts following
WGD [33].

Genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome 14
This region consists of PSME1, NOC9, PSME2, RF31 and
IRF9. Genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome 14 are summarised in Figure 2D. Regions identified
on mouse chromosome 14 (and on chimp chromosome
14, dog chromosome 8 and cow chromosome 10, data
not shown), suggest preservation of this orthologous
region in mammals. We were unable to identify a similar
orthologous region (or any of the genes it contains) in the
chicken genome, however a similar region was identified
in the genome of X. tropicalis, suggesting the chicken has
either lost these genes, or they are not included in the current assembly and associated sequence data. The D. rerio

The evolutionary relationship of FoxS1
FoxS1 has previously been named in humans as FKHL18
[34] and in mouse as Fkh3 [35], however its phylogenetic
relationship to Fox genes in more distant taxa has
remained unresolved [5,6]. Our study extends the number
of known FoxS1 genes to chimp, cow, dog and chicken
orthologues, indicating the gene is at least as old as the
mammal and bird lineage divergence. The consistent
placement of FoxS1 in a genomic region paralagous to the
clustered Fox genes suggests its evolutionary origin from
the original Fox gene cluster. This is because the presence
of orthologous regions in tetrapod and teleosts imply the
origin of these paralogons, including the FoxS1 gene, via

duplication prior to the separation of the actinopterygian
and sarcopterygian lineages. Assuming this, it is possible
the original pre-duplication Fox gene cluster included five
genes (FoxC, FoxL1, FoxF, FoxQ1 and FoxS1), and that
these have been fragmented by duplication and reciprocal
gene loss. A literal interpretation of Fox gene phylogeny
supports this view, as the FoxS1 genes group together, well
separated from the other Fox subclasses. However, Fox
gene phylogenies (including published accounts [5,6] and
our study) are necessarily based on the relatively short
sequence of the forkhead domain. Rapid divergence could
lead to long branch attraction artefacts in such phylogenies, and hence we consider it possible that FoxS1 is paralagous to FoxC, FoxL1, FoxF or FoxQ1, and that this
relationship has become obscured.
Furthermore, no foxs1 gene was recovered from the
genomes of the teleosts or of X. tropicalis. We are currently
unable to determine if this gene has been lost from these
lineages, or is present but has not yet been sequenced. If
the latter, the sequence quality in X. tropicalis and T. nigroviridis renders it unlikely it exists in the orthologous
region of these genomes. This would raise a third possibility, that FoxS1 had independently translocated into this
genomic region after the separation of the amphibian and
amniote lineages. Sequencing of further vertebrate
genomes may help resolve this issue.
Fox cluster break-up in vertebrates
Retention of linkage between clustered Fox genes observed
in humans, amphioxus and some insects has been
hypothesised to have been constrained by co-ordinated
regulation, analogous to that suggested for the homeobox
genes [25]. Our results show the retention of Fox clusters
in mammals. The chicken genome assembly is currently
of insufficient quality to determine if the Fox clusters are
intact, however in X. tropicalis, while foxq1-foxf2-foxc1 linkage is maintained, the foxf1 and foxc2-foxl1 genes are separated by at least 3.5 Mb, and could lie on different
chromosomes.

In all three teleost genomes we found evidence for foxq1foxf2-foxc1 linkage, however again the foxf1-foxc2-foxl1
cluster appears broken, and foxc2 appears to have been
lost. In conclusion, our data do not disprove the possibility of constraint on the organisation of the FoxQ1-FoxF2FoxC1 genes, but suggest such constraints, if they exist, are
less likely on the organisation of the FoxF1-FoxC2-FoxL1
genes.
In summary, our data are consistent with the origin of paralagous regions via duplication of large regions of DNA.
The timing of the duplications is consistent with that proposed for three of the genome duplications suggested to
have occurred in vertebrate evolution, but also consistent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/271

with independent block duplication of this genomic
region. Based on the pattern of duplication, we have constructed a model indicating how the Fox cluster locus
evolved in vertebrates (Figure 3). Duplication of the
whole region to yield four copies is inferred to have
occurred by the base of bony vertebrates. Considerable
gene loss is then inferred before the radiation of bony vertebrates. Subsequent losses and inversions in different vertebrate lineages are indicated in the figure.

Conclusion
Comprehensive analysis of the human Fox cluster loci has
identified 4 paralogons, 3 containing Fox genes and one
Fox-less 'cryptic paralogon'. Extension of this comparison
to other vertebrates has allowed a model for the evolution
of this genomic region to be constructed, indicating patterns of gene duplication, loss, inversion and Fox cluster
break up. To obtain a more complete picture of the evolution of the Fox clusters we note the importance of including basal actinopterygian, chondrichthian and agnathan
data in future analyses to gain a greater understanding of
the evolutionary history and timing of these events.

Methods
Regions surrounding the human FOX cluster loci where
searched using NCBI Map Viewer build 36.1 [36]. To identify further paralagous genes, BLAST searches [37] with
putative protein sequences were conducted against the
human genome, and putative positive targets further characterised by molecular phylogenetics to resolve orthologous and paralagous relationships. Each of the genes from
the putative human paralogons was cross referenced by
BLAST against the following NCBI genome assemblies;
Pan troglodytes (build 1.1), Bos taurus (build 2.1), Canis
familiaris (build 2.1), Mus musculus (build 3.5), Gallus gallus (build 1.1) and Danio rerio (Zv4) on NCBI map viewer.
The Xenopus tropicalis and Fugu rubripes genomes were
searched at the Joint Genome Institute genome portal
[38], and the Tetraodon nigroviridis genome searched by
BLAT via the Genoscope server [39]. Putative target
sequences were further analysed by molecular phylogenetics, to establish orthologous and paralagous relationships and to reaffirm our original classification of human
sequences. For molecular phylogenetic analyses, protein
sequences were first aligned, (with invertebrate outgroup
sequences included where possible) using ClustalX [40].
Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using Neighbor
Joining and maximum likelihood implemented by ClustalX, and by PHYML [41,42].

A model for gene duplication and loss in the Fox cluster loci during vertebrate evolution. Two initial rounds of
duplication of the whole region are inferred to have occurred by the base of bony vertebrates, and this is consistent with both
the 2R hypothesis and multiple block duplications. Considerable gene loss is then inferred before the radiation of bony vertebrates. Subsequent losses and inversions in different vertebrate lineages are indicated on the tree, with capital letters indicating
the paralogon (nomenclature as shown in Figures 1 and 2) affected. A third round of genome duplication (3R) is indicated in the
