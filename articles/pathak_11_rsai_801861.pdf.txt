RsaI repetitive DNA in Buffalo Bubalus bubalis
representing retrotransposons, conserved in
bovids, are part of the functional genes
Deepali Pathak and Sher Ali*

Abstract
Background: Repetitive sequences are the major components of the eukaryotic genomes. Association of these
repeats with transcribing sequences and their regulation in buffalo Bubalus bubalis has remained largely
unresolved.
Results: We cloned and sequenced RsaI repeat fragments pDp1, pDp2, pDp3, pDp4 of 1331, 651, 603 and 339
base pairs, respectively from the buffalo, Bubalus bubalis. Upon characterization, these fragments were found to
represent retrotransposons and part of some functional genes. The resultant clones showed cross hybridization
only with buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep genomic DNA. Real Time PCR, detected ~2 × 104 copies of pDp1, ~ 3000
copies of pDp2 and pDp3 and ~ 1000 of pDp4 in buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep genomes, respectively. RsaI
repeats are transcriptionally active in somatic tissues and spermatozoa. Accordingly, pDp1 showed maximum
expression in lung, pDp2 and pDp3 both in Kidney, and pDp4 in ovary. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed
repeats to be distributed all across the chromosomes.
Conclusions: The data suggest that RsaI repeats have been incorporated into the exonic regions of various
transcribing genes, possibly contributing towards the architecture and evolution of the buffalo and related
genomes. Prospects of our present work in the context of comparative and functional genomics are highlighted.

Background
Different families of repetitive DNA contribute towards
architectural organization of the mammalian genomes
[1]. They represent both, tandemly arranged and interspersed sequences [2]. Based on their size and mode of
propagation, Interspersed elements can be divided into
two separate classes, the long terminal repeat (LTR) and
non-LTR. The non LTR LINEs (long interspersed repeat
elements) and SINEs (Short interspersed repeat elements) are widely distributed occupying a substantial
fraction of the eukaryotic genomes. These elements
replicate and proliferate themselves through a “copy and
paste” mechanism called retrotransposition [3,4]. In this
process, transcription of their genomic copies is followed by an RNA intermediate resulting cDNAs reintegration at a new location in the genome [5].
Approximately, 100 LINE and SINE families have been

reported to date in various eukaryotic genomes [6]. In
mammals, LINE, L1 repeats are dominant retrotransposons type both in the common ancestor and in extant
species [7]. In addition to L1, an element belonging to
the retrotransposable element family of autonomous retrotransposons (RTE-1) has been reported in mammals
[8]. Few mammals have active non LTR LINE other
than L1 that contribute significantly to repeat
composition.
Species specific retrotransposons have been widely
used as a tool for Phylogenetic analysis and population
studies [9,10]. Many retrotransposons are inactive,
found in the non-coding regions of the genome and are
subjected only to the neutral evolution. Thus, rare new
insertions have led to some form of advantageous or
noteworthy phenotypic variations [11-13]. These and
other such discoveries have resulted in a shift from earlier thought of them being “parasite” to functional elements cultivated in the genome for their beneficial
attributes.

Retrotransposons have gained novel functions, providing alternative splice sites and/or polyadenylation signals
or modifying gene expression [14-16]. These elements
account for 46.5% of bovine genome [17]. The bovine
genome is very different in its repeat composition compared to other mammalian genomes. It has unusual
composition of LINE RTE type Bov B and its associated
SINE elements which together account for 25% of the
bovine genome [17]. The impact of the interspersed
repeats on the genomes of human [18-20], dog [21,22],
cow [17,23], mouse [24] and opossum [25,26] has been
studied. However fate of these interspersed elements
and their association with mRNA transcriptomes in buffalo remains still unclear. Here, we report RsaI family
repetitive DNA in the genome of water buffalo “Bubalus
bubalis“ and their copy number status. We also studied
their expression in somatic tissues and spermatozoa.
The repeat fraction pDp1, pDp2 and pDp3 were used
for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with buffalo
metaphase chromosomes. In addition, we isolated and

sequenced ACOT11 (Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 11)
gene harboring part of pDp1 repeat.

Results
RsaI enzyme digestion uncovers four repeat fractions

Digestion of buffalo genomic DNA with RsaI enzyme,
besides minor ones, showed four prominent bands ranging from 1331 base pairs, pDp1; 651, pDp2; 603, pDp3;
to 339; pDp4 (Figure 1). Approximately, 15-20 recombinant clones subjected to restriction digestion and slot
blot hybridization screening yielded ten positive clones
for each repeat. Five-six clones from each fragment
were then sequenced. The accession numbers of the
recombinant clones are given in the Additional File 1.
All the four major repeat elements were AT rich but
sequence-wise, were different from one another (Additional File 2). No inter-clonal variations were detected
in these sequences. However, random repeats were present in the nucleotide sequences (Table 1). Repeat Masker programme revealed presence of LTR LINE, SINE

Most striking feature of pDp1 sequence was the presence
of 489 bp, +1 ORF (nucleotide position, 841-1329) (Figure 2B). BLASTP search with GenBank sequences using
conceptual translation of this ORF (162aa) gave matches
to putative reverse transcriptase’s domain. This region
corresponds to central position of the Reverse transcriptase ORF (Figures 2A and 3). Similarly, pDp2, 111 bp, +3

(Table 3) amplified bands in buffalo, cattle, goat and
sheep genomic DNA (Figures 3A &3B). Southern hybridization of two representative RsaI sequence pDp1, and
pDp2 showed same number of bands within the genomic DNA of bovids (Additional File 5). Prominent
bands within the smear reflect identical size of the fragments dispersed throughout the bovid genomes. ClustalW alignment of 489 bp pDp1derived fragment with

(AC148038) showed high level of sequence conservation
among the bovids (Additional File 6). Phylogenetically,
with respect to all the four sequences, cattle and buffalo
were found to be closer to each other (Additional

differential expression of RsaI related transcripts across
somatic tissues and spermatozoa (Figure 4). pDp1
showed highest expression in lung, pDp2 and pDp3 in
Kidney and pDp4 in ovary. Summary of the relative
expression (in folds) derived from 2-ΔΔCt values obtained
for various transcripts based on Real Time PCR are
given in Table 4.
Multiple copies of RsaI fragments in bovids

The pair of internal primers deduced from pDp1-4 used
for expression study was also employed for copy number analysis of these fragments in cattle buffalo, goat
and sheep using Real Time PCR. Standard curve slope
value was between 3.2-3.5. Single melting peak on dissociate curve confirmed primer specificity. pDp1 showed
~2 × 104 copies, pDp2 and pDp3, ~ 3000 copies each
and pDp4 showed ~ 1000, in these species (Table 5 and
Additional File 9).

pDp1, pDp2 and pDp3 sequences are dispersed
throughout the buffalo genome

In silico analysis of pDp1, pDp2, pDp3 and pDp4
sequences using reference cattle genome revealed its
multiple locations on the cow chromosomes (Figure 5).
Probing of pDp1 to buffalo genomic DNA digested with
RsaI enzyme detected a strong hybridization signal
(Additional File 10) giving rise to a single isomorphic
band in all the samples. FISH mapping of pDp1, 2, 3
spectrum red labeled cloned probes showed ubiquitous
discernible signals over buffalo metaphase chromosomes
(Figures 6 and 7). All the chromosomes showed dispersed pattern with all the three probes used independently. In several chromosomes, signals in the
centromeric regions were absent or reduced giving rise
to inconsistent pattern. FISH with pDp1 sequence
showed more localized signals on the metaphase chromosomes as compared to that detected by pDp2 and
pDp3. FISH with spectrum red labeled clone pDp4
probe showed background signals even after washing

Full length cDNA sequence of ACOT11 gene in Buffalo

RsaI repeats to be part of Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase
11(ACOT11), Vacuolar Protein Sorting 24 (VPS24) and
Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member
1A2 (SLCO1A2) genes (Additional File 1) Full length
Buffalo ACOT11 cDNA was generated using end point
PCR and gene specific (B. taurus ACOT11) primers
(Table 3). Assembled cDNA sequence of 2592 base pair
fragment lacking poly A tail representing six exons
(Additional Files 11 and 12) were deposited in the GenBank (HQ848649 and HQ848650).

Discussion
We have studied four (pDp1, pDp2, pDp3 and pDp4)
RsaI fragments from the buffalo genome which are AT
rich, though buffalo genome on the whole is GC rich
(40.69%, NC_006295). Database searches with the
repeat-maskers revealed the presence of several LTR,
LINE and SINE element in the four sequences (Table
2). Apparently, SINEs occupy the (G+C)-rich regions
while LINEs are mainly located on the (A+T)-rich
regions. Reports suggest that very large number of
highly truncated insertions of L1 have occurred in the
bovine genome [8]. Full length copies of the human L1
contain two open reading frames, ORF1 and 2. ORF1
encodes a DNA binding protein and ORF2 includes
endonuclease and reverse transcriptase domains [27].
Presence of partial reverse transcriptase and endonuclease domains in pDp1, pDp2 and pDp4 reported

herein led to the hypothesis that RsaI repeats might be
related to a novel retrotransposable element.
Interspersed repeats get inserted into a new genomic
location through the process of retrotransposition
[28,29]. This is reflected by our FISH results of pDp1, 2
and 3 showing signals on all over the chromosomes
with varying intensity. In silico analysis of pDp3 on the
reference cattle genome showed fewer distribution

suggesting its poor characterization in the cattle genome. This is supported by the fact that using real time
PCR, we detected similar copy number of pDp3 in the
bovids. Repetitive sequences in centromeric regions are
dynamic components, ever prone to mutation, recombination, deletion, and translocation leading eventually to
their alterations [30]. Absence of RsaI sequences in the
centromere of several chromosomes may be undergoing

such events. All the four sequences showed no homology with each other as revealed by clustalW alignment
(Additional File 2). Startlingly, these four repeat elements were not detected in any of the non-bovid species. This suggests that irrespective of their origin and
biological significance, their evolutions have been confined to limited number of species. Most likely, in nonbovid species, they were not favored evolutionarily and
therefore purged slowly and gradually in due course of
time. We presume that amplifications of repeat elements
could have originated from its discrete blocks. Reintegration of extra chromosomal copies of these repeat elements [31] could have allowed its further dissemination
in the genome. However, it is not clear whether all the
repeats have similar significance in the buffalo genome.
It is likely that these repeats are collectively involved in
the evolution and sustenance of bovid chromosomes.
Reports suggest that new retrotransposons are conserved within the same group of species [32]. This is
corroborated by our Slot blot and PCR results. Real
time PCR results showed approximately similar copy
numbers for pDp1, 2, 3 and 4 in cattle, goat and sheep
genomes as mentioned earlier. The copy number assessment of these repeats in different known and nondescript breeds of buffalo may enable to establish a correlation, if any, towards the delineation of different
breeds.
Retrotransposons copies are reportedly involved in the
regulation of transcription [33-36]. Presence of RsaI
repeats in exonic database of various transcribing genes
suggests that these sequences function as parts of

mRNA. Since repeat sequences were also present in the
introns, it is possible that they are transcribed as premRNA and contribute to the processing of mRNA and
splicing. Thus, differential expression of transcripts in
somatic tissue and spermatozoa might be under the
influence of post transcriptional regulation required for
various cellular processes. Presence of transcribing retroelements within the buffalo spermatozoa reported
here seems to be first such observation. Studies have
shown existence of an RT-dependent mechanism operating in the spermatozoa, responsible for the genesis of
new biologically active retrogenes [37]. These retrogenes
may be delivered to the embryos during fertilization and
propagated subsequently in the tissues of adult individuals [37].
RsaI elements were found to be part of the three functional genes (ACOT11, VPS24 and SLCO1A2) mostly
present in 3’ UTR. Our work corroborates recent
reports that most part of retrotransposons inserts themselves in first and last exons and in untranslated regions
(UTRs) [38]. In human, this type of insertion has been
shown to create new non-conserved polyadenylation signals [39], influencing the level of gene expression [40].
However, how these insertions affect expression of buffalo transcriptomes is still a matter of speculation.

Conclusions
Buffalo has several known and non-descript breeds of
which a few are considered to be superior with respect
to productivity and economic return. Whether, RsaI
repeat in different breeds of buffalo would show similar

prove to be useful biomarkers.

Methods
Species sample and DNA extraction

Approximately, 10 ml blood samples from both the
sexes of buffalo, goat and sheep were collected from
local slaughterhouse, Delhi following the guidelines of
institute’s Ethical and Biosafety Committee. Cattle blood
sample was procured from the owner of the animal.
Blood samples of human, fish, bird, rat, jungle cat, bonnet monkey, were available from other projects in the
lab. Tiger, Indian rhinoceros and leopard samples were
obtained with due permission from the competent
authorities of the state and union government of India
following strictly the guidelines of the Institute’s Ethical
and Biosafety Committee. Genomic DNA was extracted

according to standard phenol-chloroform procedure
[41].
Restriction digestion of buffalo genomic DNA, cloning
and sequencing

Approximately, 5 μg of buffalo genomic DNA from both
the sexes was digested with RsaI restriction enzyme following supplier’s (NEB) specification. Fragments were
separated on 1% agarose gel in 1× TBE. Distinct bands
within the smear were sliced from the gel, purified and
cloned into dephosphorylated pBluescript II SK+ vector
(Stratagene, USA), using standard protocol [42]. Approximately, ten clones, representing each fragment, were
screened with restriction enzyme Xho1/Nde1 for the presence of insert. Slot-blot hybridization was conducted
using RsaI fragments as probe labeled by random priming
(RediprimeTM II kit, Amersham Pharmacia biotech,
USA). Finally, positive clones were selected for sequencing.

In silico analysis

Multiple sequence alignment and Phylogenetic tree construction were carried out using ClustalW program. Blast
search were performed with the sequences in GenBank
using BLASTN program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&BLAST_PROGRAMS=megaBlast&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&SHOW_DEFAULTS=on&LINK_LOC=blasthome version 2.2.18+) with
default parameters. Repeats were calculated using Repeat
masker http://www.repeatmasker.org/cgi-bin/WEBRepeatMasker. Clustered repeats were found out using
http://zlab.bu.edu/repfind/form.html ORFs and amino
acid sequence identification was done using http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html Conserved domain was
determined using site http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi Cattle chromosome map was
constructed using NCBI Bos taurus genome view.
Buffalo genomic DNA analysis

For cross hybridization studies, approximately 500 ng
heat denatured genomic DNA from 14 species each
mentioned earlier were slot-blotted onto the nylon
membrane (Amersham) along with cloned plasmid as
positive control and 2× SSC as negative control following standard protocol [41]. For Southern hybridization,
approximately, 4-5 μg of buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep
genomic DNA were subjected to restriction digestion
using RsaI enzyme following supplier’s (NEB) specifications. The digested DNA was resolved on 1.5% agarose
gel and transferred onto the nylon membrane (Amersham) following standard protocol [42]. Membranes
were rinsed in 2× SSC, dried and UV cross-linked. Blots
were hybridized at 60°C overnight with a-32P-dCTP
labeled recombinant plasmid (25 ng) using random
priming method (rediprimeTM II kit, Amersham Pharmacia biotech, USA). Washing of the membranes was
done using standard protocols and signals were
recorded by exposure of the blot to X-ray film [41].
PCR

The extent of sequence conservation across bovid genomes was further determined by PCR analysis. Primers
were designed from ORF using Primer 3 software (Table
3). 50 ng of genomic DNA from buffalo, cattle, goat and
sheep were PCR amplified using reaction conditions 95°C
for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles each consisting 95°C
for 1 minute, 60°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 1 minute,
and final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes for all the four
fragments. Amplified fragments were resolved on 1.5%
agarose gel in 1% TAE buffer (Table 3).

TRIzol (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati,
OH) following manufacturer’s instructions [43,44]. Tissues were procured from the local slaughterhouse,
Delhi. Fresh ejaculated semen samples from buffalo
bulls were obtained from the animal farm, Lucknow,
U.P., India, strictly following the guidelines of the
Institutes Ethical and Biosafety Committee. To check
the contamination of mRNA from the cells other than
spermatozoa, RNA extractions from the sperms were
tested by RT-PCR for both the CDH1 (E-cadherin)
GenBank Accession no. AJ400864 and CD45 (tyrosine
phosphatase) GenBank Accession no. NM_001002763
[45]. Similarly, presence of DNA was ruled out by PCR
using b-actin primers, GenBank accession no.
DQ661647 (Table 3). Following this, approximately 10
μg of RNA from different tissues and spermatozoa was
reverse transcribed into cDNA using commercially
available high capacity cDNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). The success of cDNA synthesis was confirmed by 35 cycles of PCR amplification using buffalo
derived b-actin primers.
RT-PCR and Relative expression analysis

Expression analysis of pDp1, pDp2, pDp3 and pDp4
transcripts using 50 ng cDNA from different somatic
tissues and spermatozoa of buffalo was done with
sequence specific internal primers designed by Primer 3
software (Table 3). PCR conditions were same as that
mentioned earlier. b-actin was used as positive control.
Relative expression analysis for the four transcripts was
done using SYBR Green and Real time PCR Sequence
Detection System-7500 (ABI, USA). The primers specific
to the sequence were designed using Primer Express
Software V2.0 (ABI) (Table 3). Primers for the housekeeping gene GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase) GenBank Accession no. XR_083674.1
was used to normalize the values for each sample. The
specificity of each primer pair and efficiency of the
amplification were tested by assaying serial dilutions of
the cDNA. Each reaction was performed in triplicates
and the mean value was used for the analyses [46]. The
cyclic conditions comprise 50°C for 2 min and 95°C for 10
min, followed by 40 cycles each of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C
for 1 min. Each experiment was repeated three times to
ensure consistency of the results. The expression level of
the desired sequence in different tissues and spermatozoa
was calculated in the form of 2-ΔΔCt value http://www3.

genomic DNA (0.1, 1.0 and 5 ng), forward and reverse
primers at final concentration of 100 μM. Copy number
estimation for four RsaI fragments in buffalo, cattle,
goat and sheep genomes were done using 10 fold dilutions series of recombinant plasmids in the range
30,00,00000 to 3 copies (assuming haploid genome of
farm animals =3.3 pg, wt per base pair = 1.096 × 10-21
gm). Reactions were performed in 96-well MicroAmp
Optical Reaction Plates (Applied Biosystems) in triplicates using the Real time PCR Sequence Detection System-7000 (ABI, USA) and SYBR Green dye. Primers and
assay conditions were similar to those used for Relative
expression studies (Table 3). Reaction specificity was
confirmed with melting curves analysis. The standard
curve was prepared using 10 folds dilution series of the
recombinant plasmids and buffalo, cattle, goat and
sheep genomic DNA [45,46].
Chromosome preparation and fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH)

Approximately, 200 μl of the whole blood from buffalo
was cultured for chromosome preparation following
standard protocols [46]. FISH was conducted with
spectrum red labeled pDp1, pDp2 and pDp3 and pDp4
cloned probes (Abbott Molecular) on the metaphase
chromosomes using Nick Translation Kit, Abbott
Molecular, (Illinois, USA). Hybridization was carried
out in 20 μl volume containing 50% formamide, 10%
Dextran sulphate, Cot 1 DNA and 2× SSC, pH 7 for
16 hours at 37°C in a moist chamber. Post hybridization washes were done in 2× SSC at 37°C (low stringent condition) and then at 60°C in 0.1× SSC (under
high stringent condition). Slides were counterstained
with DAPI, screened under Olympus Fluorescence
Microscope (BX51) and images were captured with
Olympus U-CMAD-2 CCD camera. Chromosome
mapping was done following the International System
for Chromosome Nomenclature (ISCND 2000) for
Bovids [47].
