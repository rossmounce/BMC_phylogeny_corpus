Abstract
Background: Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), a starchy root crop grown in tropical and
subtropical climates, is the sixth most important crop in the world after wheat, rice, maize, potato
and barley. The repertoire of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for cassava is limited and
warrants a need for a larger number of polymorphic SSRs for germplasm characterization and
breeding applications.
Results: A total of 846 putative microsatellites were identified in silico from an 8,577 cassava
unigene set with an average density of one SSR every 7 kb. One hundred and ninety-two candidate
SSRs were screened for polymorphism among a panel of cassava cultivars from Africa, Latin
America and Asia, four wild Manihot species as well as two other important taxa in the
Euphorbiaceae, leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) and castor bean (Ricinus communis). Of 168 markers
with clean amplification products, 124 (73.8%) displayed polymorphism based on high resolution
agarose gels. Of 85 EST-SSR markers screened, 80 (94.1%) amplified alleles from one or more wild
species (M epruinosa, M glaziovii, M brachyandra, M tripartita) whereas 13 (15.3%) amplified alleles
from castor bean and 9 (10.6%) amplified alleles from leafy spurge; hence nearly all markers were
transferable to wild relatives of M esculenta while only a fraction was transferable to the more
distantly related taxa. In a subset of 20 EST-SSRs assessed by fluorescence-based genotyping the
number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 10 with an average of 4.55 per locus. These markers
had a polymorphism information content (PIC) from 0.19 to 0.75 with an average value of 0.55 and
showed genetic relationships consistent with existing information on these genotypes.
Conclusion: A set of 124 new, unique polymorphic EST-SSRs was developed and characterized
which extends the repertoire of SSR markers for cultivated cassava and its wild relatives. The
markers show high PIC values and therefore will be useful for cultivar identification, taxonomic
studies, and genetic mapping. The study further shows that mining ESTs is a highly efficient strategy
for polymorphism detection within the cultivated cassava gene pool.

Background
Cassava, Manihot esculenta subsp esculenta Crantz (2n =
36), is a starchy root crop and the primary staple for over
800 million people worldwide [1]. Native to the Neotropics [2], cassava is now cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions in Asia, Latin America and Africa. In 2007,
Africa was the world's largest producer with 118 million
tons out of a global production of 228 million tons [3].
Cassava can grow under adverse climatic conditions with
erratic rainfall and on marginal land under low intensity
management [4]. Because of these attributes, cassava plays
an essential food security role in Africa. In addition to
food, cassava also has important industrial uses for the
production of starch-based products, alcohol and animal
feed [5,6].
Like most vegetatively propagated crops, cassava is highly
heterozygous. Low rates of flowering and the long breeding cycle further render conventional breeding of cassava
arduous [7]. Breeders have used controlled wide crosses
with wild Manihot species for cassava improvement: for
example, resistance to mosaic virus and bacterial blight
has been successfully transferred from Manihot glaziovii to
locally adapted cassava cultivars in Africa [8,9]. Because
the genus Manihot is largely inter-fertile, wild species
could further broaden the genetic base of cultivated cassava [10]. Natural hybridization between wild Manihot
and cultivated cassava has also been reported [11].
Molecular marker technology is an efficient tool for the
characterization and management of plant genetic
resources and also in crop improvement programs.
Among the different classes of molecular markers, microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are widely utilized for genetic diversity and genetic mapping because
they are largely co-dominant, multi-allelic, have good
genome coverage and can be multiplexed on semi-automated systems [12,13]. In the case of cassava, SSR markers
have been utilized for the characterization of genetic
resources [14-16] and an SSR-based molecular genetic
map for cassava comprising 100 markers was described
[17]. Despite these advances, the development and utilization of molecular markers for cassava lags behind the
achievements of other major crop plants. For example, in
case of barley, a high density microsatellite consensus
map with 775 SSR loci has been described [18].
In recent years, EST and cDNA resources for cassava have
increased substantially [19-21]. Cassava genomic and EST
resources will further vastly increase with the recent completion of a draft cassava genome sequence and associated
EST projects http://www.jgi.doe.gov/genome-projects/.
These datasets constitute valuable and inexpensive
sources of molecular markers such as SNPs [22] and microsatellites, since these can be readily detected computa-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/118

tionally. Thus, mining these resources provides an
opportunity to greatly expand the database of molecular
markers for cassava at minimal cost.
Cassava is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. The
invasive weed leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) and the
oilseed plant castor bean (Ricinus communis) are other
important members of this family. A draft genomic
sequence for castor bean is available and both castor bean
and leafy spurge have extensive EST resources (http://cas
torbean.tigr.org; [23]). With the recent completion of the
cassava genome sequence, cassava and castor bean will
constitute a valuable comparative genomics system.
The objectives of this study were to (i) increase the
number of SSR markers by mining a previously developed
cassava 8,577 unigene set; (ii) characterize EST-derived
microsatellite markers in terms of abundance and level of
polymorphism; and (iii) assess their transferability to
other taxa in the Euphorbiaceae. The approach taken has
been to characterize and validate 192 microsatellites identified in silico from a cassava unigene set by DNA fingerprinting a sample set consisting of: cultivated cassava
from Africa, Latin America and Asia; four wild Manihot relatives; and leafy spurge and castor bean, two more distantly related taxa within the Euphorbiaceae.

Results and Discussion
Frequency and distribution of microsatellites in the cassava
transcriptome
A total of 18,177 ESTs were used in this study, which were
clustered in 8,577 unigenes [20]. In total, 836 microsatellite repeats were identified in the 8,577 unigenes (Table
1). Perfect repeats and imperfect repeats, i.e. repeats with
small insertions or deletions within the repeat, were identified. Mononucleotide repeats were not included due to
difficulties in accurate sizing of polymorphisms. Of 836
EST-SSRs, 316 (37.8%) were perfect repeats while 520
(62.2%) were imperfect repeats. A total of 137 ESTs contained perfect as well as imperfect repeats. Also, several
ESTs contained 2 or more perfect or imperfect repeats.
Overall, 596 ESTs were identified in the 8,577 unigene set
that contained microsatellite repeats.

SSR loci were classified by repeat type and structure (Table
1). The most frequent number of repeats per motif was
between 5 and 9, thus microsatellites in cassava ESTs are
rather small, in agreement with previous findings in coffee
[24] eggplant [25] and barley [26]. Since the unigene set
represented 5.8 Mb of the cassava transcriptome, the average distance between SSRs is approximately 7.0 kb or one
SSR-containing EST every 10.3 ESTs. This number corresponds well with barley where the average distance
between SSRs was 6.3 kb or one SSR-containing EST every
13.3 ESTs [26], Coffea which has an average density of one

microsatellite every 7.73 kb [27], but is lower compared to
pepper (Capsicum) where one SSR was found in every 3.8
kb EST [28].
The highest proportion of repeat motifs comprised dinucleotide (68.7%) repeats, followed by tri-nucleotide
repeats (30.4%). Only five tetra- (0.6%) and three pentanucleotides (0.3%) were found. This result is in contrast
with the majority of earlier studies which report tri-nucleotide repeats as the most abundant class of repeats [2831] but in agreement with studies in Picea species [32] and
Coffea [24] where di-nucleotide repeats were found to be
the most abundant class. Reported frequencies and distribution of EST-SSRs is variable for different plant and animal species. This can be partly attributed to the
microsatellite search criteria and the characteristics of the
EST database analyzed in these studies. Since the cassava
EST dataset used in this study was sequenced from the

5'end, a greater proportion of the EST-SSRs could be
located in the 5'untranslated region rather than in the
coding region where tri-nucleotide repeats are expected to
be the predominant repeat type.
EST-SSRs were identified in 9.7% of the total number of
contigs in cassava, compared to 10.2% for pepper [28],
6.8% for coffee [27], and 7.5% for wheat [31]. In this
study, the SSR search was conducted on a unigene set
which will return non-redundant SSRs. This approach
results in a realistic estimate of microsatellite repeat frequency and ensures that EST-SSR markers correspond to
unique loci in the genome.
EST-SSR marker development
Out of the 596 unique ESTs containing microsatellites,
primer pairs were designed for 346; 167 with perfect
repeats (48.3%) and 179 (51.7%) containing imperfect

repeats. The remaining sequences were inappropriate for
primer design mainly because of insufficient DNA
sequence flanking the microsatellite core. In addition,
duplicates (21) with an existing cassava SSR dataset [33]
were eliminated. One hundred and ninety-two randomly
chosen primer pairs flanking di-, tri-, or tetrameric SSRs
were optimized for PCR amplification using one or two
cassava genotypes, TMS30572 and/or TME3. Details of
the primer sequences and expected product size with SSR
motif are described [see Additional file 1]. Of the 192
primer pairs tested, 168 (87.5%) yielded scorable amplicons. This percentage of working primers (mono- and polymorphic) is in the range previously observed for
zoysiagrass (1,044 out of 1,163 or 89.7%) [34], clementine (41 out of 48 or 85.4%) [35], eggplant (39 out of 50
or 78%) [25] and Coffea (18 out of 24 or 75%) [24].
Twenty-seven primer pairs produced weak or no amplicons leading to exclusion from further analysis. Nine microsatellites produced amplicons that were significantly
longer than expected and most likely indicate the presence
of introns. Five of these produced fragments larger than

500 bp and could not be scored accurately for small differences in fragment size. These were also excluded from further analysis.
Next, primer pairs with scorable amplicons were assayed
for polymorphism among cassava cultivars from Africa,
Asia and Latin America (see Table 2). This panel included
cassava landraces, elite breeding lines and some putative
interspecific hybrids. To assess transferability of the ESTSSRs to other taxa within the Euphorbiaceae, the panel
also included four wild Manihot species, castor bean and
leafy spurge. In order to assess the potential of the newly
developed EST-SSR markers for detecting polymorphism,
all 168 primer pairs yielding PCR products were tested on
this diversity panel or on a subset thereof, hereafter
referred to as panel 2. Panel 2 is a subset of 24 genotypes,
intended to represent the larger sample set; it includes cassava cultivars from 14 different countries in Africa, South
America and Asia, three wild Manihot species, plus castor
bean and leafy spurge (Table 2). Overall, 124 primer pairs
(73.8%) showed polymorphisms in the germplasm ana-

lyzed, as illustrated for MeESSR119 (Figure 1A). Of the
124 polymorphic primers, 78 (62.9%) were for perfect
SSRs while 46 (37.1%) were for imperfect SSRs. Thus perfect SSR repeats were more polymorphic than imperfect
repeat types. When only cultivated cassava was considered, 40 out of 79 markers tested on panel 2 were polymorphic, corresponding to a frequency of 50.6%. The
difference in level of polymorphism between cultivated
cassava and all genotypes in panel 2 is due to the presence
of additional, unique alleles in the wild Manihot species.
Marker polymorphism for cultivated cassava in this study
is about 2.7-fold higher compared to a study on cassava
EST-SSRs where 18.4% polymorphism was detected (9
out of 49 primers tested were polymorphic) [36]. In citrus,
more than 90% of EST-SSR markers were polymorphic
which is higher compared to our results [35]. Fluctuations
in level of polymorphism detected in EST-SSRs can be
explained in part by the level of diversity among the germplasm surveyed. The higher frequency of polymorphism
observed here compared to the study of Tangphatsornruang et al. [36] is possibly due to the inclusion of diverse
landraces from 14 different countries in Africa, Latin
America, Asia as well as elite cassava genotypes in this
panel. Since polymorphism was scored on high resolution

agarose gels, it is also possible that the level of polymorphism is higher than the frequency reported here since
allelic variants with small size differences may not have
been resolved on this system. Overall, our results show
that mining ESTs for the development of SSRs is a highly
effective strategy to increase the SSR database for cassava.
Out of 85 markers with clear amplicons tested on the 19
cassava cultivars of panel 2, 25 (29.4%) showed nonamplifying or null alleles in one or more genotypes.
Therefore null alleles were common among the diverse
cassava cultivars examined here. Null alleles for genic
SSRs have also been described in other plant species such
as for example kiwifruit [37], amongst others. The frequency of null alleles is influenced by several factors,
including the diversity of the germplasm tested and technical aspects such as quality of the sequence data for
primer development or PCR conditions. In a study on
sunflower and related wild relatives, a clear relationship
was found between genetic distance and amplification
failures, with the frequency of null alleles ranging from
11.2% for an inbred sunflower accession to 34.5% among
a wild sunflower species [38]. In a sample of wheat germplasm consisting of 52 diverse genotypes, null alleles for
EST-SSRs occurred at a frequency of 45% [39] which is

higher compared to the result obtained here. In view of
the highly heterozygous nature of cassava and the occurrence of point mutations and/or insertion-deletions in the
EST-SSR alleles outside the microsatellite repeat region
(unpublished results), most null alleles observed in the
present study are likely due to sequence variation in the
primer binding sites.
SSRs are assumed to be locus specific. Cassava is considered an allotetraploid with disomic inheritance [40,41].
Therefore we expect amplification of one or two bands per
locus. Out of 79 markers tested on panel 2, 49 (62%)
amplified one or two alleles per locus while the remaining
30 (38%) markers amplified more than two bands for at
least one genotype (see Figure 1B). In a previous study on
genomic microsatellites in cassava [42], approximately
80% of the markers detected one or two alleles per accession, thus suggesting a fairly low degree of genomic microsatellite locus duplication. Our results show about a
two-fold higher frequency of markers amplifying more
than two bands per genotype. This is surprising in view of
the fact that genic SSRs are generally considered to be
more conserved compared to genomic SSRs [12]. However, multiple bands could also be due to the presence of
multigene families. Therefore, in case of genic SSRs, the
multiple bands could be due to cross-amplification of
conserved members of multigene families. It should be
noted that the frequency of multiple loci reported here
represents a minimum estimate, considering that this
result is based on high resolution agarose gel electrophoresis which does not resolve all allelic variants
(unpublished observations). Similarly, the frequency of
polymorphism reported here is a conservative estimate as
markers with an allelic size range of 3-5 bp or less may
have escaped detection. While the resolution of the agarose gel system is limited to about 3-5 bp, it does allow for
a rapid screening of candidate microsatellite markers.
Cross-species and cross-genera transferability
Cross-species transferability of the new cassava-derived
SSR markers was tested for three wild Manihot species and
two other Euphorbiaceae taxa; leafy spurge and castor
bean. In general, the markers resulted in robust cross-species amplification with alleles of comparable sizes in cassava cultivars and the wild Manihot species. Out of 85
amplicons tested, 85 amplified for TMS30572 (100%); 82
for TME117 (97%); 80 for TME419 (94%) which are cassava cultivars, while 78 amplified for M glaziovii (91%);
74 for M brachyandra (87%) and 72 for M epruinosa
(84.7%) which are wild Manihot species. Overall, a transferability of ~94% was observed for the wild Manihot relatives, i.e. 80 markers amplified alleles from one or more
wild species. In agreement with this, it was previously
demonstrated in cassava that genomic SSRs can be used to
assess its wild relatives [14]. By contrast, only 13 (15%)
and 9 (11%) respectively, of the EST-SSR markers yielded

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/118

amplicons in castor bean and leafy spurge. Moreover, the
sizes of the amplicons from castor bean and leafy spurge
were often outside the allelic range observed in cultivated
cassava and the wild Manihot species (see Figure 1), suggesting that these may not represent orthologous
sequences. These numbers are very similar to those
obtained in a study on the Compositae where transferability from sunflower (Helianthus annuus) to wild species was
88.6% while transferability to the more distantly related
genera safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) was 14.8% and 14.4% respectively [38]. Thus,
the cassava EST-SSR markers display broad utility within
the genus Manihot but limited utility beyond the genus
level, in agreement with previous studies in plants [4345]. It should be pointed out that amplification of the
genic SSRs in the wild species does not necessarily imply
that these loci are polymorphic in these species, since only
a single accession was analyzed per taxon.
Allelic polymorphism and genetic relationships
A subset of 20 randomly selected polymorphic EST-SSRs
producing one or two amplicons per genotype was tested
for their potential in genetic studies by ascertaining the
genetic diversity in panel 2. Alleles were resolved by semiautomated fluorescence-based genotyping to attain a
more accurate estimation of the allelic diversity and size
range. Good amplification was obtained for all the markers across the tested genotypes. Leafy spurge and castor
bean produced fewer amplicons compared to cassava and
the wild Manihot species, in agreement with the results
obtained from high resolution agarose gel electrophoresis.

The 20 polymorphic EST-SSR markers generated 94 alleles
and discriminated all 24 accessions into different clusters
according to their phylogenetic relationship. The principal coordinate plot (Figure 2) shows the genetic relationship and distribution of the panel. The first and second
principal coordinates accounted for 60.79% of the total
variation, and showed an effective clustering among the
species. From the principal coordinate plot, three groups
were clearly shown: (i) the cassava accessions (ii) the wild
Manihot species and (iii) castor bean and leafy spurge.
Next, a dendrogram was constructed to show the genetic
differentiation of the cassava accessions and wild Manihot
species (Figure 3). The dendrogram grouping showed the
expected separation of the cultivated cassava accessions
from their wild relatives, in agreement with the cluster
grouping obtained from the principal coordinate plot. In
addition, the dendrogram revealed expected genetic relationships between cassava cultivars based on their pedigree or previous diversity studies. For example, TMS
4(2)1425 and TMS 30572 are two progeny from TMS
58308 and group together in the dendrogram, in agreement with their shared ancestry [46]. Genetic similarity
was also detected between TME225 and TME419, lanPage 6 of 11

draces from Benin and Togo respectively, in agreement
with a previous genetic diversity study based on 18
genomic SSRs [47]. Overall, this analysis supports the
botanical classification of the germplasm surveyed and
suggests the usefulness of the EST-SSR markers for genetic
diversity studies and other genotyping applications in cassava and its wild relatives.
The allelic diversity and extent of polymorphism for panel
2 accessions were also determined and are summarized in

Table 3. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to
10 with an average of 4.55 alleles per marker. The allele
size of the original TME117 EST sequences all fall within
the allele size range determined by fluorescence-based
genotyping as summarized in Table 3, as expected. The
number of alleles per locus is higher compared to a previous study on cassava EST-SSRs where this ranged from 2
to 4 [36]. In the latter study, alleles were detected on polyacrylamide gels after silver staining. The higher number of
alleles observed in our study is likely due to the higher resolution of fluorescence-based genotyping as well as the
inclusion of three wild species, leafy spurge and castor
bean in the panel. In previous studies on genomic SSRs in
cassava, an average of 8.6 alleles per locus [42] and 9.0
alleles per locus [15] was detected which is higher compared to the value 4.55 found here for the genic SSRs. The
average allelic size range for the cassava EST-SSRs
described here is 16.7 bp which is lower compared to the
value of 25.4 for seven cassava genomic SSRs previously
analyzed using fluorescence-based genotyping [42]. ESTSSR markers were found to be less polymorphic compared
to genomic SSRs in other crop plants such as rice and barley [48,49]. In cultivated durum wheat, EST-SSR markers
were less powerful in discriminating genotypes compared
to genomic sources, though they produced higher quality
markers, i.e. with fewer stutter bands [50]. The polymorphism information content (PIC) values of the EST-SSR
markers identified here varied from 0.19 to 0.75 with an
average of 0.55 (Table 3). These values are within the
range of those reported for other plant species where average PIC values of EST-SSR markers varied from 0.32 to
0.66 (see [12] and references therein). In terms of allelic

polymorphism, our results in cassava seem to support the
findings in other species such as rice and maize where
microsatellites from coding regions tended to have a narrower allele size range and be less polymorphic than those
derived from genomic clones. It will be interesting to
compare the EST-SSRs described here to the genomic SSRs
previously developed for cassava in terms of discriminating power and quality.
EST-SSRs as functional markers
To assess functionality of the new markers, BlastX searches
were performed for 123 ESTs containing polymorphic
SSR. These results are summarized [see Additional file 2]
and showed that a putative function could be assigned to
50 ESTs (40.7%) assuming a threshold of E<1.10-4, while
54 (43.9%) corresponded to predicted or hypothetical
proteins. Ten ESTs (8.1%) produced no significant match.
Cassava ESTs that produced no specific matches, or
matches to hypothetical or unknowns, were then compared to annotation of the original cassava EST-database
http://titan.biotec.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/ESTWebsite/
estima_start?seqSet=cassava to identify potential Arabidopsis homologues. This search resulted in annotation of
an additional 24 EST sequences, bringing the total
number of matches to proteins with a putative function to
74 (60.2%). As expected, most searches retrieved
sequences from castor bean (70) followed by poplar (22),
two plant species whose complete genomic sequence has
been determined and that are most closely related to cassava.

Conclusion
In cassava, the number of published SSR markers is limited compared to other major crops. In this study, an in
depth analysis of genic microsatellites in terms of density,
level of polymorphism, and informativeness is presented.
A new set of 124 genic SSR markers with PIC values comparable to genic SSRs in other plant species was developed. These resources will be of interest to the
Euphorbiaceae research community in general and the
cassava research community in particular, where research
focuses on basic and applied aspects of cassava biology,
including germplasm characterization, breeding applications, and phylogenetic studies of Manihot species. We
have shown that mining ESTs is an effective strategy to
identify functional microsatellites in the cultivated cassava gene pool with perfect repeats being more polymorphic that imperfect repeats. Nearly all genic SSRs are
readily transferable to other species within Manihot but
much less so with two other genera of the Euphorbiaceae
examined here, Ricinus communis and Euphorbia esula.

Methods
Plant material
The cassava cultivars, wild Manihot relatives along with
other Manihot accessions and castor bean summarized in
Table 2 were collected from the Cassava Breeding Unit
and the Genetic Resources Center of the International
Institute for Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria. Leafy
spurge DNA was provided by USDA-ARS, Fargo, ND, USA.
DNA was extracted from leaf tissue as described [51].

Searching for microsatellites and primer design
The identification and localization of microsatellites in
ESTs was accomplished by a microsatellite search as
described previously [52]. For in silico identification of the
perfect repeats, the minimum number of repeat motifs
was set at 6 for the di-nucleotide repeats and at 5 for all
other repeats. For the imperfect repeats, the minimum
number of repeats motifs was set at 7 for the di- and trinucleotide repeats and 6 for the tetra- and penta-nucleotide repeats. The repeats in Table 1 are the combined
number of perfect and imperfect repeats; all possible combinations are listed for the di- and tri-nucleotide repeats
while for the tetra- and penta-nucleotide repeats, only
repeats for which microsatellites were retrieved are listed.
The number of repeat units for the imperfect and perfect
repeats separately can be obtained upon request. Primer
pairs
were
designed
using
Primer3
http://
frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3. The major primer design
parameters were set as follows: primer length from 18 to
28 (optimum 20), PCR product from 100 to 300 bp, optimum annealing temperature between 57 and 60°C.
Primer sequences and annealing temperatures for polymorphic SSRs reported in this paper are given [see Additional file 1]. Information on additional primer pairs that
failed to amplify, could not be easily scored or were monomorphic, can be provided upon request.
Polymerase chain reaction conditions and product
electrophoresis
PCR was performed in a 10 μl volume containing 10 ng
DNA in 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer (Bioline, United
Kingdom), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 μM of forward and
reverse primer and 1.0 u Biotaq DNA polymerase (Bioline, United Kingdom). Reactions were performed in 96well plates in MJ thermocyclers (PCT-100; MJ Research,
Watertown, Mass, USA) under the following touchdown
profile: (I) 3-min initial denaturation at 94°C; (II) 10
cycles of: 30 s at 94°C; 30 s at 60°C with 0.5°C decrease
per cycle; 60 s at 72°C; (III) 25 cycles of: 30 s at 94°C, 30
s at 55°C and 1-min extension at 72°C; (IV) final extension was 5-min at 72°C. PCR reactions were optimized
using 3 annealing temperatures: 55°C, 58°C and 60°C.
Primer pairs that did not amplify under these conditions
were subsequently tested using 1, 1.5 and 4 mM MgCl2
concentration for the 3 touchdown profiles. Success of
amplification was checked on 2% agarose gels run in 1×
TBE (89 mM Tris-Borate, 20 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and stained with EtBr. Primer pairs with
clean amplification products were then screened for polymorphism using the fingerprinting panels in Table 2. PCR
products were run on 3.5% MetaPhor Agarose (Lonza,
Rockland, ME, USA) or Super Fine Resolution Agarose
(Amresco, Solon, OH, USA) in 1× TBE buffer and visualized by EtBr staining. Band sizing was estimated by comparison with the size marker HyperLadder V™ (Bioline,
United Kingdom). A subset of polymorphic markers was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/118

resolved on ABI3100 DNA Genetic Analyzer and analyzed
using GeneMapper v 3.7 (Applied Biosystems). The allelic
data were used to determine the number and sizes of
amplified alleles.
Data analysis
Principal coordinate and cluster analyses were performed
to estimate the discriminatory ability of 20 EST-SSR markers to assess inter and intra species relationships. Genetic
similarity coefficient was generated from 94 EST-SSR alleles using the Nei and Li [53] method. The similarity
matrix was used to construct a dendrogram using the
neighbor joining method and the TREE VIEW sub program of the NTSYS-PC software [54]. Principal coordinate
analysis was performed to show genetic relationships
among the accessions. The polymorphism information
content (PIC) of the markers was determined to measure
the informativeness of the markers using the equation:
n

PICi = 1 −

∑ Pij

2

j =1

Where PICi is the polymorphic information content of a
marker i; Pij is the frequency of the jth pattern for marker
i and the summation extends over n patterns [55,56]. For
functional analysis, the translated EST sequences were
searched against the GenBank non-redundant CDS translations + PDB + SwissProt + PIR + PRF excluding environmental samples from WGS project using the BLASTX
algorithm (GenBank release May 2009; [57]).
