Abstract
Background: Current vaccines to avian influenzae virus (AIV), a highly contagious disease of birds, need to be
constantly updated due to the high level of variation in the target antigens. Therefore, a vaccine that could induce
broad cross protection against AIV is required. The M2 membrane protein is structurally conserved amongst AIV
subtypes but tends in induce a poor immune response, whereas C3d has been shown in many species to enhance
immunogenicity. In this study, we investigated the potential of M2-avian C3d fusion proteins to provide effective
immunity.
Results: We fused chicken complement C3d to sM2 (M2 protein with the transmembrane region deleted) of AIV and
expressed four fusion proteins, GST (Glutathione S-transferase tagged proteins in pGEX expression vector) -C3d-sM2,
GST-C3d-L2-sM2, GST-C3d-L1-C3d-sM2 and GST-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2 were used to immunize mice. In addition, Specific
pathogen free (SPF) chickens were inoculated with the plasmids pcDNA-sM2, pcDNA-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2, GST-sM2
and GST-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2. The immune response was monitored by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) for sM2 antibody, and all the test animals were challenged with A/chicken/Bei Jing/WD9/98 (H9N2) virus.
Results revealed that the anti-sM2 antibody in mice and chickens vaccinated with these proteins was higher than the
nonfused forms of sM2, the GST-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2 groups have conferred the highest 30% and 20% protection ratio
in mice and chickens respectively. In addition, the pcDNA-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2 also enhances the antibody responses
to sM2 compared to pcDNA-sM2 in chickens, and acquired 13.3% protection ratio.
Conclusion: These results indicated that chicken C3d enhanced the humoral immunity against AIV M2 protein either
fused proteins expressed by the prokaryotic system or with the DNA vaccine. Nevertheless, in view of the poor
protection ratio for these animals, we speculated that this is not a worthy developing of vaccine in these constructs.
Background
Complement is a protein system in the plasma of humans
and animals [1]. After being activated, a series of important biological reactions generate several complement
proteins that nonspecifically defend against invading
pathogens [2]. While complement protein C3 is a central
component of the innate immune system, it also plays an
important role in stimulating the humoral immune
response [1,3]. At the point of convergence of three dis* Correspondence: li.yongqing@bbsrc.ac.uk, vetchen@cau.edu.cn

tinct pathways of complement activation, C3 is cleaved
into C3a and C3b by the C3 convertase [4]. Further proteolytic cleavage of C3b results in the formation of C3c and
C3dg. The C3dg product can be further degraded by a
variety of cellular proteases into C3d, a protein which
attaches covalently to the surface of pathogens and
upregulates B-cell responses [4,5]. Previous studies have
demonstrated that C3d could enhance antigen recognition and specific immunoglobulin synthesis by antigenspecific B cells, as the antigen is taken up and processed
via cell receptor 2 (CR2) by both antigen-specific and
non-specific B cells [6]. Subsequent investigations
showed that three copies of murine C3d could dramatically enhance antibody responses to specific antigen,
being 100-fold more effective than incomplete Freund's

adjuvant [7,8]. Ross reported that C3d could enhance
antibody responses directed toward a specific antigen
encoded by a DNA vaccine [9]. A DNA vaccine expressing a fusion of hemagglutinin (HA) from influenza virus
or measles virus fused to three copies of the murine
homologue of C3d (mC3d) achieved an early and efficient
immune response in mice. Fusion to C3d has been shown
to increase the immunogenicity of the capsular polysaccharide antigen of Streptococcus pneumoniae [10]. Using
DNA vaccination, various forms of envelope (Env) proteins of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) fused at the carboxyl terminus with C3d of murine
complement, generated high-titer, long-lasting, neutralizing antibodies in mice [11]. In addition, the human
homologue of C3d (hC3d) also enhanced anti-Env antibodies in rabbits when it was fused to sgp120 [12].
Recently, Wang reported that the bovine homologue of
C3d (boC3d) coupled to the E2 envelope protein of
bovine viral diarrhea virus greatly enhanced immunogenicity in mice [13]. Liu also reported that chicken C3dP29 linked to the F gene of Newcastle disease virus
(NDV) enhanced immunogenicity in chickens [14].
Logan GJ found C3d (3)-fusion markedly increase antibody responses to the AAV-encoded model antigen (hen
egg lysozyme) with greater than 50-fold enhancement in
responses [15]. Comparison of the human, mouse and
bovine C3d sequences showed 84.1% amino acid homology between hC3d and mC3d and 80.5% homology
between hC3d and boC3d, they either showed the function of immune adjuvant in mammalian model. Information on the function of avian C3d is scarce. Importantly,
there are structural differences in the mammalian and
avian immune systems, particularly the role of the bursa
as one of the central immune organs in avian species.
Avian influenza (AI), caused by avian influenza virus
(AIV), is a highly contagious disease of birds. Current AI
vaccines induce antibodies against HA and neuraminidase (NA), two major surface glycoproteins expressed on
the virus particles. However, due to rapid antigenic variation of HA and NA, AI vaccine can not protect avian
against the new avian influenza virus strains. A vaccine
that is less sensitive to the antigenic evolution of the virus
would be a major improvement. As a result, vaccines have
to be updated continuously to prevent disease emerging
due to new viral strains. Hence, a vaccine that could
induce broad cross protection against AIV would be
desirable.
The Matrix protein 2 (M2) is an integral tetrameric
membrane protein of AIV. Natural M2 protein is present
in a few copies in the virus particle but in abundance on
virus-infected cells. In contrast to hemagglutinin and
neuraminidase, M2 is almost nonimmunogenic, and its
sequence is highly conserved in all diverse subtypes of
AIV. Several investigations have shown that the M2 pro-

Page 2 of 11

tein has the potential to induce a broadly protective
immunity against AIV. M2-specific antibodies have been
shown to restrict virus growth in vitro and in vivo and
thus have the potential of providing cross-reactive resistance to influenza type A virus infection [16]. Frace
reported that vaccination with the protein M2 was found
to raise M2-specific serum antibodies and enhance viral
clearance in mice challenged with homologous and heterologous influenza A viruses [17]. Neirynck reported that
the M2 domain was genetically fused to the hepatitis B
virus core (HBc) protein to create fusion gene coding for
M2HBc, and intraperitoneal or intranasal administration
of purified M2HBc particles to mice provided 90-100%
protection against a lethal virus challenge [18]. Zhao
designed a tetra-branched multiple antigenic peptide
(MAP)-based vaccine, designated M2e-MAP, which contains the sequence overlapping the highly conserved
extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) of a HPAI
H5N1 virus, animals test results showed that M2e-MAP
vaccine induced strong M2e-specific IgG antibody
responses following 3-dose immunization of mice with
M2e-MAP in the presence of Freunds' or aluminium
(alum) adjuvant [19]. Rao SS have shown that vaccination
with M2 in recombinant DNA and/or adenovirus vectors
or with adjuvants confers protection against lethal challenge in the absence of HA, and also find that the protective efficacy of NP and M2 diminishes as the virulence
and dose of the challenge virus are increased [20]. However, M2 is only a minor protein component of AIV, and
tends to induce a poor immune response [21]. To overcome the shortcomings of M2-based vaccines, in this
study we investigated the potential of M2-avian C3d
fusion proteins to provide effective immunity.

Results
Cloning and sequence analysis of the chicken C3d gene
fragment

Chicken C3d has not previously been cloned so it was
necessary to clone and sequence the complement C3d
fragment. A PCR product of approximately 1 kb was
amplified from RNA extracted from chicken liver tissue.
The fragment was cloned into the pMD18-T (Takara)
plasmid and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that
the amplified fragment was 993 bp in length and that the
chicken C3d gene was 897 bp in length. This nucleotide
sequence for chicken C3d was submitted to the GenBank
database (DQ291160). The chicken C3d sequence
showed the following % identities to the published
sequences for C3d from: Arbor Acres chicken (EF632299)
99.8%; human (NM_000064) 66.4%; mouse (BC043338)
66.2%; hamster (AB024425) 67.9%; cow (AY630404)
67.2%; rabbit (M32434) 67.0%; pig (NM_214009) 66.8%;
chimpanzee (XM_512318) 66.4% and sheep (AF038130)
66.9%, as determined by Clustal W multiple alignment of

chicken C3d showed the following % similarity to the
published protein sequences for C3d from: Arbor Acres
chicken, 100%; human, 61.5%; mouse, 61.9%; hamster,
61.2%; cow, 62.2%; rabbit, 56.5%; pig, 61.9%; chimpanzee,
61.5% and sheep, 61.5%, as determined by DNAStar
ClustalW analysis. A phylogenetic tree of the C3d amino
acid sequences is shown in Fig. 1.
Construction and identification of the recombinant
expression plasmids

Recombinant expression plasmids pGEX-C3d-sM2,
pGEX-C3d-L1-C3d-sM2, pGEX-C3d-L2-sM2, pGEXC3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2 and pcDNA-sM2, pcDNA-C3d-L1C3d-L2-sM2 were constructed with gene expression cassettes, pGEX-5x-1 and pcDNA4.0-LacZ. EcoRI and XhoI
restriction endonuclease digestion resulted in a linearized
pGEX-5x-1plasmid (of about 4900 bp), expression cassettes DNA of two copies of cC3d and sM2 (of about 2100
bp) and gene cassettes DNA of one copy of cC3d and sM2
(of about 1200 bp).
Expression and purification of fusion proteins

E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the four
prokaryotic expression plasmids detailed above. Cells
were then induced by IPTG at 28°C. The expression
products were purified using the SKL method. Examination by 12% SDS-PAGE showed that the molecular
weight of the single fused copy of cC3d was about 70 kDa,
while the molecular weight of the two copies fused to
cC3d was about 102 kDa, both of these sizes corresponding to the sizes expected (Fig. 2).

was greater than that in GST-sM2 mixed in IFA group,
but the difference between the two groups was not significant (P > 0.05). The GST-sM2+IFA and GST-C3d-L1C3d-L2-sM2 groups have conferred the highest 30% protection ratio in mice (Table 1), the GST-C3d-sM2 group
provide 20% protection ratio secondly. Most of mice that
attacked with H9N2 virus have showed some clinical
signs after post-challenge, such as depressed, shiver and
so on.

GST-C3d-L1-sM2, GST-C3d-sM2, GST-sM2 proteins
and GST-sM2 mixed in IFA. The results showed that no

and DNA vaccines of pcDNA-sM2 and pcDNA-C3d-L1C3d-L2-sM2. In the indirect ELISA, for the fusion protein groups, the difference between GST-C3d-L1-C3dL2-sM2, GST-sM2 mixed in IFA and GST-sM2 (control
group) was very significant (P < 0.01) after the second
immunization. Indeed, the antibody titer of the GSTC3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2 immunized group was higher than
that of all the other groups at this point. The difference
between GST-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2 and GST-sM2 mixed

group became significant (P < 0.05) (Fig. 6). The GSTsM2+IFA group has the highest antibody titer and a
26.7% protection ratio (Table 2), the GST-C3d-L1-C3dL2-sM2 and pcDNA-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2 groups provide 20%, 13.3% protection ratio respectively. No chicken
that received H9N2 virus have showed obvious clinical
signs on 5 days post challenge.

Discussion
Many researchers have confirmed that in the immune
system of mammals, complement component C3d as a
molecular adjuvant bridging innate and acquired immunity [7,22,23]. Apart from enhancing the activation of B
cells, promoting the affinity maturity of antibodies and
maintaining immunologic memory, C3d also has the
molecular adjuvant function of enhancing the antigen
presentation of B cells as well as decreasing the activation
threshold of these cells [24-26]. As a molecular adjuvant,
C3d can be linked to different antigens, effectively
enhancing the titer and life-span of specific antibodies
against these antigens [7,27-29]. However, there have

Figure 5 Titers of antibody against sM2 in BALB/c mouse serum

6 (n = 10) groups. The mice in the six test groups were immunized
thrice with GST-sM2, GST-C3d-sM2, GST-C3d-L1-sM2, GST-C3d-L1C3d-sM2, GST-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2 and GST-sM2+IFA, respectively.
Blood samples were collected before each vaccination and two weeks
after the final booster, and antibody against sM2 were detected by ELISA. Ab-positive cut-off values were set as mean + 2 SD of non-immunized sera. An ELISA Ab titer was expressed as the highest serum
dilution giving a positive reaction. The titer values were showed in 100

been few reports about the structure and function of
chicken C3d published to date. In 2005, we cloned the
full-length chicken C3d gene and submitted its sequence
to the GenBank database (Accession number:
DQ291160). Amino acid homology between chicken C3d
and mammal C3d was found to be low.
In this study, we fused one to two copies of C3d to the 5'
end of sM2 gene of AIV to construct expression plasmids,
from which fusion proteins were expressed and purified.
We immunized BALB/c mice and SPF chickens with the
purified proteins. The experimental results in mice and
chickens showed that C3d could enhance the antibody
titer to sM2 protein in both host species. In studies using
human and mouse C3d, most researchers considered that
at least three copies of C3d fused to antigen were needed
to enhance immunity [30-32]. Suradhat also reported that
two copies of mouse C3d fused to bovine rotavirus (BRV)
VP7 or bovine herpesvirus type I (BHV-I) glycoprotein D
did not enhance antibody titers to either antigen [33].
Bower reported that there was no relationship between
the copy numbers of C3d binding to antigen and the antibody titer [34]. In our present study, no obvious changes
in antibody levels were detected in each C3d injected
group after the first and second immunizations, so
repeated immunizations were performed to improve the
immune response. However, after the third immunization, both one copy and two copies of C3d significantly
enhanced the antibody titer against sM2. This indicates
that repeated immunization with chicken C3d can
enhance the humoral immune response to an antigen
molecule. The antibody titers of sM2 produced by immunizing the fusion proteins of two copies of C3d and sM2
bound by two simple amino acid flexible peptides, are significantly higher than for other treatment groups. This
result was further verified by immunization of SPF chickens, and agreed with the findings of a previous report
[35]. It is not clear why in mice immunized with fusion

proteins bearing one copy of C3d or with fusion proteins
that consisted of two copies of C3d only linked with one
flexible peptide, anti-sM2 antibody could not be detected
after two immunizations. It is possible that, because the
molecular weight of C3d is greater than that of sM2, the
C3d stereochemistry blocked sM2 binding. In contrast,
with the protein GST-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2, which has
two flexible peptides, repeated immunizations are not
required, a finding that has been reported previously [3436].
Many previous researches have shown the molecular
adjuvant effect of C3d in the immunization of DNA vaccines [33,36-39]. However, our immunological test in SPF
chickens found that C3d can enhance the immunogenicity of the linked sM2 protein, whether it exists as a
prokaryotic expressed fusion protein or a eukaryotic
recombinant plasmid. The reason for this was not clear.
We also found that DNA vaccine bearing two copies of
C3d can enhance the immunogenicity of the antigen sM2,

but its ability to increase the antibody titer is lower than
that of the fusion proteins.
The transformation ability of lymphocytes may reflect
the immune status of the body. Mitsuyoshi reported that
C3d might enhance the immunogenicity of antigens without T lymphocytes [40]. In the present study, we used
LPS and Con A as mitogens to perform peripheral blood
lymphocyte transformation tests. The results showed
that when stimulated with LPS, the differences between
the GST-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2 immunized group and the
matching control group and between the pcDNA-C3dL1-C3d-L2-sM2 immunized group and the matching
control group were significant. However, when stimulated with Con A, there was no significant difference
between the immunized groups. Since LPS and Con A are
major mitogens of B and T lymphocytes respectively,
these findings indicate that C3d can enhance the proliferation of chicken B lymphocytes but has no obvious effect
on the proliferation of T lymphocytes. In contrast,
Mitchel reported that C3d could activate T cells and
express major histocompatibility complex class I and II
proteins in an antigen dependent manner [29]. Also,
Bower reported that C3d could induce higher expression
of T cells stimulating secretions of interferon-γ and interleukin-4 [41]. Based on this research, our future studies
will focus on the effect of chicken complement component C3d on cell-mediated immunity.
In this review, though the results presented here suggest that C3d as an adjuvant might be effective to
enhance antibody response, a good AIV vaccine is the
ability to protect vaccined animals. In order to improve
the vaccine efficacy, one or two copies of chicken C3d
and flexible peptides were applied in the constructs of
vaccines, but the M2 vaccines still needs at least two
booster immunizations. Furthermore, Vaccinations as
described here, only afforded 30% protection in mice and
20% protection in chickens. Therefore, this is not a promising vaccine in these constructs. We hope that it is help-

cloning to facilitate subsequent manipulation, and the
recombined plasmid was designated pMD-cC3d.

Conclusion
In this study, we investigated the potential of M2-avian
C3d fusion proteins to provide effective immunity. These
results indicated that chicken C3d enhanced the humoral
immunity against AIV M2 protein either fused proteins
expressed by the prokaryotic system or with the DNA
vaccine. Nevertheless, in view of the poor protection
ratio for these animals, we speculated that this is not a
worthy developing of vaccine in these constructs.

Construction and identification of the recombinant
expression plasmids

Methods
Cloning and sequencing of the chicken C3d gene fragment

Using the publicly available sequences of human, mouse,
hamster, cow, rabbit, pig, chimpanzee and sheep complement component C3d and the fowl complement component C3, two primers (upstream: 5'-CCT GGT GGA
GAA AGC C-3'; downstream: 5'-TGC GGT AGG TGA
TGG C-3') were designed. Samples of liver tissue were
obtained from a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) White Leghorn chicken inoculated with a 0.5 ml dose of infectious
coryza oil vaccine. RNA was extracted using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen, USA) as per the manufacturer's
instructions. A reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction was
carried out using the above reverse primer and Maloney
murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
USA) to generate cDNA containing the chicken complement C3d sequence. The C3d gene was PCR amplified
using the above cDNA as a template. Standard PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94°C (5
min), followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 94°C (30 sec),
annealing at 56°C (45 sec) and extending at 72°C (1 min),
followed by a 10 min final extension step at 72°C. The
plasmid sequence was verified by automated nucleotide
sequence analysis using standard protocols. The RT-PCR
product was inserted into pMD18-T (Takara) by TA-

Primers were designed for PCR amplification of the fulllength gene sequence of (918 bp) chicken C3d (cC3d)
from the sequence of the recombinant plasmid pMDcC3d. The forward primer (5'-GAATTC ATGCACCTCATTGTGACCCCCTCGGGCAGT-3') was specific for
the 5' coding region of the chicken C3d gene and began
with an upstream EcoRI restriction site (in bold) and start
code. The reverse primer (5'-CCCGGGGCGGTAGGTGATGGCGTTG-3') coded for the 3' region and provided
an XmaI restriction site (in bold). The sM2 gene of AIV
(A/chicken/Guangdong/2000, H9N2) was amplified from
plasmid pMD-sM2 by PCR [42]. The amplified sM2 gene
fragment (256 bp in length) encoded the complete M2
open reading frame of AIV but not the transmembrane
domain. Upstream HindIII and downstream XhoI sites
were added to the sM2 fragment. Two linker sequences
(L1 and L2) were constructed following the design of
Dempsey et al. [7] to provide spacing between protein
motifs. Four single stranded oligonucleotides encoding
the amino acid sequence GS [G4S]2GS with upstream
XmaI and downstream HindIII or NheI sites were prepared by forming adhesive ends after annealing. One or
two copies of the cC3d and sM2 genes were joined with
different linkers to form four gene expression cassettes:
EcoRI-C3d-HindIII-sM2-XhoI,
EcoRI-C3d-XmaI-L2HindIII-sM2-XhoI, EcoRI-C3d-XmaI-L1-NheI-C3d-HindIII-sM2-XhoI and EcoRI-C3d-XmaI-L1-NheI-C3dXmaI-L2-HindIII-sM2-XhoI. To construct the plasmids
needed, these gene expression cassettes were ligated into
EcoRI and XhoI sites of a plasmid vector pGEX-5x-1
(Amersham-Pharmacia). The gene cassette encoding
EcoRI-C3d-XmaI-L1-NheI-C3d-XmaI-L2-HindIII-sM2XhoI was cloned into the identical site of the eukaryotic

plasmid pcDNA4.0-Lacz (Invitrogen) containing the
cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, an upstream
intron and the simian virus 40 late poly (A) signal
sequences. As a control, the sM2 gene alone was inserted
into plasmids pGEX-5x-1 and pcDNA4.0-Lacz respectively to construct recombinant expression plasmids
[43,44].
Expression and purification of fusion proteins

The recombinant prokaryotic expression plasmids were
transformed into competent Escherichia coli strain BL21
(DE3). Single colonies of four positive recombinant bacteria were inoculated into Luria broth (LB) supplemented
with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. These cultures were incubated
at 37°C until mid-log phase (OD600 0.6-0.8). The broth
was then divided into two, with one half being induced
with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) while
the other half served as an uninduced control. The broths
were incubated for an additional 4 h at 28°C. The expression product was purified from the supernatants of bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathione
sepharose 4B (Amersham-Pharmacia). Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay
dye reagent concentrate, and the purified proteins were
stored at -80°C.
SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot detection of fusion
proteins

Expressed proteins were separated by electrophoresis in
12% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels.
To visualize total proteins, gels were stained with BioSafe™ Coomassie G250 stain (New England Biolabs). Protein All Blue™ standard (New England Biolabs) was used
as a molecular mass standard.
For Western immunoblot analysis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The
membranes were blocked for a minimum of 1 h with PBS
containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma)
and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) prior to incubation with a
1:500 dilution of a monoclonal antibody (3F8) specific for
sM2 (primary antibody, which is prepared in previous
research by ourselves). After extensive washing, bound
antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) with a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) (secondary antibody). Blots were developed using alkaline phosphatase (AP) Conjugate Substrate Kit (New England
Biolabs). Color development was stopped by washing the
membrane in deionized water.
Expression of recombinant eukaryotic plasmids in BHK-21
cells

The eukaryotic plasmids containing EcoRI-C3d-XmaIL1-NheI-C3d-XmaI-L2-HindIII-sM2-XhoI and the sM2
gene alone were isolated from E. coli DH5á cells and puri-

fied using a Plasmid Mini Purification Kit (QIAGEN
GmbH). The endotoxin-free plasmids were verified by
restriction endonuclease digestion with EcoRI and XhoI
and analysis by gel electrophoresis. The purity and concentration of DNA preparations was determined based
on the optical densities (ODs) at 260 and 280 nm. In a sixwell plate (Costar), baby hamster kidney cell lines (BHK21) on slides were transfected with 4.0 μg of DNA and 10
μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, N. Y.) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
The transfected cells were incubated for 36 h at 37°C in a
CO2 incubator, and then harvested for immunological
examination.
Indirect immunofluorescence detection

The slides that carried the infected cells were carefully
removed from the wells, washed with 0.01 M PBS, then
fixed (acetone: absolute alcohol, 3:2) for 30 min at 4°C.
The fixed BHK-21 cells were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of monoclonal antibody (3F8) against sM2 for 45
min at 37°C in a wet box. After extensive washing, bound
antibodies were detected using a FITC-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and observed by fluorescence
microscopy.
Animals immunization and challenge

Six-week-old BALB/c mice (Jingfeng Medical Laboratory
Institute, Beijing, China) were inoculated. Mice were randomly divided into six groups, with 10 mice in each
group, and housed with free access to food and water.
Mice were administered with purified proteins GST-sM2,
GST-C3d-sM2, GST-C3d-L1-sM2, GST-C3d-L1-C3dsM2 and GST-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2 in 100 μl of PBS subcutaneously in the rear flank. Mice were also injected
with GST-sM2 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA;
Sigma) as control group. Booster immunizations with the
same proteins were performed with an interval of two
weeks. For the three inoculations, the injection dose was
100 μg proteins respectively. Non-lethal tail bleeds were
collected before each vaccination and two weeks after the
final booster. For virus challenge, phenobarbital sodiumanesthetized mice were intranasally infected with A/
chicken/Bei Jing/WD9/98 (H9N2) virus (106.5 EID50 [the
50% embryo infectious dose]) in 100 μl of PBS per mouse
2 weeks after the final immunization. Lung samples were
collected from individual mice at day 5 after a challenge
infection. The whole-lung extracts prepared as homogenates using frosted glass slides were centrifuged at 3,000
rpm for 5 min to collect supernatants. The lung supernatants were frozen and kept at -70°C until used for virus
isolation assay. The supernatants (0.2 ml/egg) were inoculated into the allantoic cavity of five 10-days old specific
pathogen free (SPF) chicken embryos. Early embryonic
death within the first 24 hours of inoculation was consid-

ered as non-specific death and these embryos were discarded. After incubation at 37°C for 5 days the allantoic
fluid was harvested and tested by haemagglutination
(HA) assay. In the cases there was no virus was detected
in the first virus isolation, the allantoic fluid was passaged
once in embryonated hen eggs. The mouse was considered not to be protected whichever HA test was positive
in two virus isolations. The mouse was considered to be
protected when the second passage HA test still was negative.
75 aged 3 weeks SPF chickens (Beijing Center for Laboratory Animals, Beijing) were divided into five equal
groups. Three groups of chickens were injected intramuscularly with 200 μg of purified proteins GST-sM2, GSTsM2 mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA;
Sigma) and GST-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2 respectively. The
other two groups were vaccinated with the mixtures of
the recombinant plasmids DNA (pcDNA-sM2 and
pcDNA-C3d-L1-C3d-L2-sM2) and Lipofectamine™ 2000
(Invitrogen) by the intramuscular route. A dose of 0.2 ml
contained 100 μg DNA and 50 μl Lipofectamine™ 2000 in
Opti-MEM® I Reduced Serum Medium (Invitrogen). Two
booster immunizations of the same purified proteins and
plasmid DNA were given at an interval of two weeks,
with the same dose being 100 μg respectively. Blood was
collected from the wing vein before every vaccination and
two weeks after the final boost. Virus challenge and virus
isolation trials were carried out refer to the above mouse
test procedure, 5×106.5 EID50 of H9N2 virus was used as
the challenge viral dosage. All of the animal experiments
performed in this study were approved by the Beijing
Laboratory Animal Management Office (China).
Indirect ELISA for detection of anti-sM2 antibodies

According to previously described methods [15,43], purified sM2 protein was obtained by cleaving GST-sM2
bound to Glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham-Pharmacia) with factor Xa. Polystyrene microplates (Costar,
Corning Incorporated) were coated with 100 μl of purified sM2 protein at a concentration of 0.125 μg/ml, and
the samples were incubated with 2-fold serially diluted
sera from the vaccinated animals. Anti-mouse (or antichicken) IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
(Sigma, 1:8000 dilutions) was used as the secondary antibody. End-point titers were calculated as the reciprocal of
the last serum dilution that gave a value 2-fold higher
than the negative serum. Antibody titers below the cutoff
of the assay were assigned an arbitrary titer one-half the
cutoff in order to allow calculation of the geometric mean
of the titers.
Lymphocyte proliferation assay

Ten SPF chickens from each of the immunized groups
described above were bled aseptically from the heart two

weeks after the final boost. Peripheral blood lymphocytes
were isolated by Lympholyte ®-Mammal (Cedarlane®, Laboratories Limited). The cells were resuspended in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum,
100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all
from Invitrogen). Freshly isolated lymphocytes were
seeded in quadruplicate at 4×106 cells/ml in 96-well
round-bottomed microtiter plates (Costar). Cells were
either left un-stimulated or stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 5 μg/ml; Sigma) or Concanavalin A (Con A;
5 μg/ml; Sigma) as the mitogen. After incubation for 60 h
at 37°C, 3- [4, 5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenylthtrazolium bromide (MTT) was added to the cultures and a
further 3 h incubation performed. The reaction was
stopped with 10% SDS-0.01 mol/l HCL and the OD570 nm
was measured using a Bio-Rad 550 plate reader.
Statistical analysis

The anti-sM2 antibody titers were expressed as the 100
Log2X where X was the reciprocal of the final dilution of
serum. Proliferation of lymphocytes were expressed as
the OD570 value which was expressed as the mean ± standard errors of the mean (SEM) of at least three independent experiments. The t-test was used to analyze the
statistical significance of the differences. Probability (P)
values of < 0.05 (*) and < 0.01 (**) were considered significant.
