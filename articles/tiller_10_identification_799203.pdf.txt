Abstract
Background: Brucellosis is primarily a zoonotic disease caused by Brucella species. There are currently ten Brucella
spp. including the recently identified novel B. inopinata sp. isolated from a wound associated with a breast implant
infection. In this study we report on the identification of an unusual Brucella-like strain (BO2) isolated from a lung
biopsy in a 52-year-old patient in Australia with a clinical history of chronic destructive pneumonia.
Results: Standard biochemical profiles confirmed that the unusual strain was a member of the Brucella genus and
the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence was 100% identical to the recently identified B. inopinata sp. nov. (type
strain BO1T). Additional sequence analysis of the recA, omp2a and 2b genes; and multiple locus sequence analysis
(MLSA) demonstrated that strain BO2 exhibited significant similarity to the B. inopinata sp. compared to any of the
other Brucella or Ochrobactrum species. Genotyping based on multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat
analysis (MLVA) established that the BO2 and BO1Tstrains form a distinct phylogenetic cluster separate from the
other Brucella spp.
Conclusion: Based on these molecular and microbiological characterizations, we propose that the BO2 strain is a
novel lineage of the newly described B. inopinata species.

Background
Brucellosis is primarily a zoonotic disease, caused by
members of the genus Brucella, which currently constitutes several species based on pathogenicity, host preferences and phenotypic characteristics: B. abortus (cattle),
B. canis (dogs), B. melitensis (goats), B. suis (pigs), B.
ovis (rams), B. neotomae (desert rats), B. ceti and B. pinnipedialis (marine mammals), and B. microti (common
vole) [1-6]. Recently, a novel species, Brucella inopinata,
associated with a human infection has been recognized
as the newest member of the genus Brucella [7,8]. In
early 1985, whole genome hybridization analysis studies
revealed a high degree of genetic homology among the
Brucella species, which led to the proposal that the
genus Brucella was a mono-specific species with B.
melitensis being the primary species and all others as

sub-species and biovars [9-11]. However, due to the limited acceptability of the one-species concept, the traditional classification of Brucella spp. based on phenotypic
characteristics has been re-instated by the Brucella Taxonomy Subcommittee in 2006 [3].
Brucella are facultative intracellular pathogens that
infect many organs and soft tissues, including mammary
glands. Infection frequently results in abortion, low milk
production and fetal death in animals [2,12-16]. Brucellosis in humans is mostly caused by B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. suis, and sometimes B. canis [14,17-19], and is
commonly associated with the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, meat from infected animals and
exposure to infected animal tissues or laboratory transmission [1,2,20]. Human brucellosis is a chronic debilitating infection with a very broad clinical picture
potentially affecting any major organ, including the
lung, causing varying respiratory symptoms [20].
Respiratory infections in humans caused by Brucella
spp. is a rare manifestation with reports describing

multifocal abscesses or nodules, hilar adenopathy and
hemorrhagic pleural effusion with resolution by antimicrobial therapy and lung decortications [21-26]. Most
pulmonary brucellosis cases were found in farmers
handling infected meat or travelers who consumed raw
infected animal meat or unpasteurized milk products
while visiting countries endemic for brucellosis [26,27].
We report the isolation and identification of an unusual gram-negative, non-motile Brucella-like coccoid
bacillus (BO2) isolated from a lung biopsy in a 52-yearold male in Australia with a history of chronic destructive pneumonia. The patient traveled worldwide but
denied any common risk factors associated with brucellosis. Both biochemical and molecular characteristics of
the BO2 strain have demonstrated unique similarity
with a recently described B. inopinata strain (BO1 T )
associated with a breast implant wound of a 71-year-old
patient from Portland, Oregon with clinical signs of brucellosis [7,8].

Results
Phenotypic characterization

BO2 cells grown on SBA or RBA at 35-37°C with or
without 5% CO2 for 24 to 48 h were circular, convex,
entire, smooth and opaque. The organisms were gramnegative, generally stained uniformly; and appeared coccoid to short coryneform rods. Colonies of the BO2
strain ranged in size from punctuate to 1.5 mm in diameter and they were non-motile, mucoid colonies on
MacConkey agar; positive for oxidase and catalase,
exhibited nitrate reduction with production of gas and
rapid urease production (< 5 min). Hydrogen sulfide
production by the BO2 strain was observed by the
development of a dark gray color on lead acetate paper
suspended above the heart infusion agar slant.

Subculture of individual colony types produced similar
profiles and no hemolytic reaction was observed on SBA
plates after overnight incubation at 37°C. The BO2 cells
grew in the presence of thionine (1:25,000, 1:50,000 and
1:100,000 dilutions) and basic fuchsin (1:50,000 and
1:100,000 dilutions) dyes within 24 to 48 h. Both the
acriflavin and gel formation tests were negative. However, lysis by Tbilisi phage specific for detection of Brucella spp. in two routine test dilutions (1× and 4× RTD)
appeared incomplete [7,8,28] and agglutination of the
BO2 cells with either monospecific anti-M or anti-A
antisera were very weak.
Antimicrobial susceptibility test

The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the BO2 strain
was compared with a set of 93 other Brucella spp.
strains (74 B. melitensis, 14 B. suis and 5 B. abortus)
along with BO1T based on CLSI interpretive requirements for Brucella spp. [8,29,30]. Both strains had very
similar MIC patterns to all Brucella reference strains
tested previously [8,30] (Table 1). BO1T and BO2 strains
grew well in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth
(CAMHB) after just 20 hours of incubation, unlike
other Brucella spp. (e.g., B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B.
suis) which do not routinely grow very well in CAMHB
and require 48 hours of incubation in Brucella broth for
MIC testing [30]. Our standard phenotypic characterization, including the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles,
suggested that the BO2 strain more closely resembled
the BO1T strain of the B. inopinata sp. than the other
classical Brucella spp.

strain BO2 was approximately the same size as that of
the BO1T strain and the classical Brucella spp. including
B. ovis (ATCC 25840) (Figure 1). The BO2 strain also
generated several large amplicons (>1000 bp) similar to
BO1T and other Brucella strains with low intensity as
reported earlier [8].
Real-Time PCR for BO1T/BO2

A TaqMan PCR assay targeting conserved regions of the
BO1T and Brucella spp.16S rRNA gene sequence was
designed for rapid differentiation of potential B. inopinata-like strains from all other classical Brucella and
Ochrobactrum spp. This real-time PCR assay, using two
hybridization probes: BI-P specific for B. inopinata spp.
and BRU-P specific for Brucella/Ochrobactrum spp.,
gave average crossing threshold (Ct) values in the range
of 15 to 20 (strong positive). The BI-P probe demonstrated perfect agreement for both BO1 T and BO2
strains as did the BRU-P probe for all other Brucella or
Ochrobactrum spp. respectively. Both probes showed no
cross reactivity against the other non-Brucella strains
tested to date [31] demonstrating very high specificity of
the target sequences in the PCR assay. Both the BO1T/
BO2 and the Brucella/Ochrobactrum specific probes
were capable of optimal detection of template down to
10 fg/μl concentration of genomic DNA template (data
not shown).
16S rRNA gene sequence analysis

Rapid identification of the BO2 strain as B. inopinatalike by the BO1 PCR assay led to sequence analysis of
the full-length 16S rRNA gene (1,412 bp) of the BO2
strain. Full sequence alignment with the 16S rRNA gene
sequences of BO1 T , reference Orchrobactrum spp.
strains, and the Brucella spp. consensus sequence confirmed that the BO2 strain shared 100% 16S rRNA gene
sequence identity to that of BO1 T and 99.6% identity
with other Brucella spp. (Table 2).
Omp2a/2b genes sequence analysis

We also analyzed two highly homologous outer membrane porin genes (omp2a and omp2b) of the BO2 and
BO1Tstrains and compared their full-length sequences

with that of other Brucella species available in GenBank.
The phylogenetic relationships derived by neighbor-joining clustering analysis of the BO2 omp2a (1093 bp) and
omp2b (~1212 bp) genes with the NCBI sequences of
other Brucella strains and the Ochrobactrum anthropi
LMG 3331 reference strain demonstrated considerable
intra- and inter-species variability (Figure 2). The BO2
omp2a and omp2b genes are 84.6% homologous to each
other. Neighbor-joining clustering analysis of both
omp2a and omp2b nucleotide sequences shows that
BO2 clusters closest to BO1T and an atypical B. suis 83210 strain [32]. The omp2a gene of BO2 is only 1.0%
divergent from that of BO1T. The omp2b gene is characteristically more diverse within the Brucella spp. and
is also evident with the BO2 omp2b gene which was
95.3% and 94.1% identical to the BO1T and B. suis 83210 strains, respectively (Figure 2, Table 2). Clustering
analysis demonstrates that BO1T, BO2 and the B. suis
83-210 strains form consistent sub-groups based on
their omp2a and omp2b gene homology [32].
RecA gene sequence analysis

The recA gene (948 bp) of strain BO2 was compared to
those of BO1 T , the classical Brucella spp.(n = 8) and
several representative Ochrobactrum spp. [31,33].
Within the genus Brucella, the recA gene is highly conserved with 100% nucleotide sequence identity among
the different species. Interestingly, the BO2 recA nucleotide sequence reveals 99.2% identity to the Brucella consensus recA sequence due to 8 nucleotide substitutions.
However, the BO2 recA gene has a lower identity
(98.2%) when compared to the BO1T recA sequence differing by 17 nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis of BO1T
and BO2 strains with other Brucella and Ochrobactrum
spp. shows that the Brucella spp. clade including BO2
and BO1 T , are distantly similar to the Ochrobactrum
spp. with approximately 85% sequence identity (Figure
3).
Multiple Locus Sequence Analysis

Multiple locus sequence analysis (MLSA) of nine Brucella spp. house-keeping genes has been used to

differentiate Brucella spp. into distinct sequence types
(ST). BO1T was determined to be 1.67% divergent from
ST1 and to possess novel alleles at all nine loci [8]. BO2
has shown similar divergence (1.5%) from ST1 by MLSA
also with novel alleles in all nine loci. Neighbor-joining
phylogenetic analysis clearly shows how divergent the
BO1T and BO2 species are from the classical Brucella
sequence types (Figure 4). Throughout the 4,396-bp
sequence examined, the BO1T and BO2 genomes have
32 common SNPs while there are 30 BO1T and 26 BO2
specific nucleotide changes that further characterize the
divergence of these two strains at these highly conserved
loci in the Brucella genus.
Multiple-Locus Variable-Number Tandem Repeat Analyses

Both BO2 and BO1T strains were also investigated by
multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR)
analysis (MLVA) using fifteen VNTR loci by capillary
electrophoresis. Results were compared with a panel of
well-characterized Brucella strains (n = 209) representing known species from our collection [31]. Our
MLVA-15 typing analysis of both BO2 and BO1T strains
demonstrated unique VNTR profiles in which both
strains have six Brucella-loci with the same alleles
(VNTR 2, -3, -14, -20, -21 and -25); and seven loci with
variable VNTR amplicons (VNTR1, -7, -27, -29, -30, -31
and -33). All VNTRs successfully amplified in both BO1
and BO2 with the exception of VNTR16 and -28 in
BO1T. MLVA-15 analysis revealed that both BO2 and
BO1T had distinct VNTR profiles in comparison to each
other and other Brucella strains (Figure 5).

Discussion
In this paper we present the identification of an atypical
Brucella-like strain (BO2) isolated from the lung biopsy
of a 52-year-old patient. As a young adult he lived in
Oregon on two occasions (1981 and 1985-1987), and
experienced an unexplained ‘liver failure’ and then
severe pneumonia (with pleurisy) from which he recovered with multiple courses of antimicrobial therapy as
reported by the patient to his physicians in Australia.
This patient was originally misdiagnosed because of the
misidentification of the BO2 strain as O. anthropi on an
AP1 20NE system. It is a common practice for clinical

labs to attempt rapid identification of gram-negative coccobacillus organisms like Brucella spp. from blood culture using automated systems. However, the Brucella
spp. are often misidentified due to their similar phenotypic characteristics to closely related organisms such as
Ochrobactrum spp. [34,35]. Though the patient was
initially treated for both Ochrobactrum and Brucella
infections due to the difficulties in diagnosis, he recovered with an extended course of combination oral antimicrobial therapy.
This BO2 strain is phenotypically and molecularly
similar to the recently identified B. inopinata type strain
(BO1T) recovered from a patient from Oregon, which
was also originally misidentified as O. anthropi by the
API 20E and API 20NE [7,8]. Both these strains share
common colony morphology and biochemical characteristics including rapid urease and positive H2S production, inability or very weak agglutination with Brucella
specific antisera for the lipopolysaccharide-O-antigens
or acriflavin. Neither the BO1T or BO2 strains supports
gel formation or exhibits growth inhibition to the dye
media as shown by common members of the genus Brucella. BO2 also exhibited incomplete lysis by Tbilisi
phage and had very similar antimicrobial susceptibility
profiles to BO1T in comparison to other Brucella reference strains.
Insertion sequence (IS) fingerprinting in the Brucella
species has shown that the genomic localization and
copy number of the IS711 insertion element (also called
IS6501) is species-specific and could have an association
with specific pathogenicity for a preferred host [36-38].
The presence of multiple copies of BO1 T -like IS711
insertion sequences suggest not only that BO2 is a
member of the Brucella genus (Figure 1) but that the
BO2-IS711 amplification pattern specifically resembles
that of the newly described B. inopinata species [8].
Positive identification of the BO2 strain as a member of
B. inopinata by our real-time BO1 PCR assay was significant. Both BO1T and BO2 strains were the cause of distinct and unusual forms of human brucellosis. Atypical
clinical isolates of this nature can often be misdiagnosed
by automated systems as was the case with BO1T and
the BO2 strain described here [8,35]. The availability of
the real-time TaqMan assay served as a reliable first-line
tool for determining B. inopinata-like species.
These initial findings led to further characterization
and sequence-based typing which provided additional
supporting evidence that this new BO2 strain most
resembles the B. inopinata sp. within the Brucella
genus. Using broad-range eubacterial primers, Gee et.
al. effectively demonstrated the advantage of 16S rRNA
gene sequencing to identify Brucella isolates reporting
100% identity in all the strains examined [31]. Interestingly, the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of BO2

was 100% identical to that of BO1T and 99.6% identical
to the Brucella spp. consensus 16S rRNA gene
sequence. The high sequence identity of the BO2 16S
rRNA sequence to the recently described B. inopinata
sp. is remarkable and represents the first recognized
Brucella species to have a divergent 16S rRNA sequence
[8].
The recA gene has been investigated as an alternative
phylogenetic marker for several bacterial genera due to
its highly conserved nature and ubiquity in prokaryotes
[33,39,40]. Unlike the high sequence homology of the
recA gene within the Brucella genus [41], we identified
unique variability in the recA gene sequences of BO2
and BO1 T . Sequence analysis revealed that the recA
nucleotide sequence of the BO2 strain shared greater

similarity with the Brucella spp. recA consensus
sequence than to BO1 T . Both BO2 and BO1 T recA
sequences are distanced by 8 and 11 unique SNPs,
respectively, from the Brucella spp. recA consensus
sequence, and share only one common transversion at
the 517 nucleotide position. Translation of the recA
gene sequences of BO1 T , BO2 and the Brucella spp.
consensus sequence shows that all base pair changes
were synonymous substitutions having no effect on protein structure or function. The Brucella outer membrane proteins have been studied extensively for their
function in virulence, pathogenicity, bacteriophage
reception, antigenic factors and antibacterial evasion
[42-45]. The genetic variability among the omp genes
within the Brucella spp. has proven effective at

characterizing Brucella spp. and strain types and is often
used for higher resolution molecular typing [4,32,43,45].
The omp2a/2b genetic analysis we report here is very
interesting in that BO2 consistently associates with not
only BO1 T but the atypical B. suis 83-210 strain that
was isolated from a rodent in Australia [32]; and thus
further investigation may be warranted into rodents as a
possible natural reservoir for these novel Brucella
species.
Investigation of the nine housekeeping genes by multi
locus sequencing analysis demonstrates that BO2 is
genetically distinct from BO1T yet exhibits remarkably
similar divergence (1.5%) from the classical Brucella
sequence types as shown in Figure 4. The relative similarity of the nucleotide sequences of BO1T and BO2 by
MLSA demonstrates uniquely distant sequence types
within the currently characterized Brucella spp. and
should be considered as a new group of STs within the
Brucella genus. They also exhibit distinct allelic profiles
by MLVA although all alleles in both the BO1 T and
BO2 allelic profiles have been observed in other Brucella
spp. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis shown in
Figure 5 demonstrates that these strains form a single
separate cluster from the classical Brucella spp. [8].
The molecular and microbiological characteristics presented here provide supporting evidence that strain BO2

is most closely associated with the BO1 T strain and
should be considered as a novel lineage of B. inopinata
sp. Attempting to understand the evolutionary origin of
these two strains is somewhat confounded by the interesting and disparate medical histories of the case patients
(who both happened to have lived in Portland, Oregon)
from whom these strains were isolated and suggests that
there are new and emerging Brucella strains capable of
causing unusual presentation of human brucellosis.

Conclusion
Phenotypic and genomic analysis of the unusual Brucella strain (BO2) from a lung biopsy have established it
as a lineage of the recently identified novel B. inopinata
sp. type strain BO1T, which was isolated from a wound
associated with a breast implant. This is the first report
of a human brucellosis case associated with chronic
destructive pneumonia caused by an atypical Brucella
strain. An interesting finding from our molecular analysis reveals that both strains BO1T and BO2 appeared to
be closely related to a less-characterized B. suis strain
83-210 (isolated from a rodent in Australia) by their
omp2a/2b genes, which may suggest a common ancestor
and may also provide insight into the ecological niche,
and host reservoir for these novel Brucella strains causing unusual human infections.

Methods
Patient

The patient was born in Malta in 1956 and immigrated
to Australia at age two, where he would continually
return and eventually settle throughout extensive worldwide travel including the Western region of the United
States. Between 2003 and 2007, the patient was hospitalized multiple times in different hospitals in Australia
for abnormal liver function, community acquired pneumonia, anterior chest wall abscess and sinus infection.
In September 2007 a percutaneous lung biopsy was performed and a gram-negative organism was isolated from
a broth culture of the fine needle aspirate of the
patient’s lung and identified as Ochrobactrum anthropi
on an API20NE system. The testing laboratory was
aware of the possibility of Brucella sp. being misidentified as Ochrobactrum anthropi [35] and the isolate was

referred for further testing. The patient was treated with
combination therapy of doxycycline and rifampicin for
twelve months and ciprofloxacin for three months (the
latter was ceased after molecular testing confirmed Brucella species). The culture was initially tested according
to standard microbiological and molecular procedures
and then forwarded to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA, for further characterization. This gram-negative organism was designated
as BO2 and stored at -70°C in defibrinated rabbit blood
until further evaluation.
Phenotypic analysis

The BO2 strain was routinely maintained on Trypticase
soy agar with 5% defribinated sheep blood agar (SBA) or
rabbit blood agar (RBA) (BBL Microbiology Systems,
Cockeysville, MD). Phenotypic identification of the BO2
strain was performed according to the laboratory

techniques in brucellosis described by Alton et. al. in
the World Health Organization monogram [7,8,28].
Antimicrobial susceptibility analysis

The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the BO2 strain
was performed by the broth microdilution method in
CAMHB and Brucella broth in accordance with the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) protocol as described previously [8,29]
Molecular analysis
Detection of IS711

To detect the Brucella-specific insertion sequence IS711
element (842 bp) [37], cell lysate DNA templates from
strains BO2, BO1T, B. abortus (ATCC 23448), B. suis
1330 (ATCC 23444), B. ovis (ATCC 25840) and B. melitensis 16 M (ATCC 23456) were amplified and the
amplicons were analyzed by 2% E-Gel agarose gel electrophoresis as mentioned previously [8].
Real-Time PCR assay

A real-time TaqMan PCR assay was developed targeting
a four base nucleotide substitution within the 16S rRNA
gene sequence of BO1T (positions 145 to 148; GenBank
accession no. EU053207). We designed two PCR primers16SF (5’-CGGGCCGATCATTTGC-3’) and16SR
(5’-AACTCAGGGAAACTTGTGCTAATACC-3’) to
amplify a 72-bp region of the 16S rRNA Brucella consensus sequence and two hybridization probes, BI-P (5’AAATCTTTCCCCTTTCGGGCAC-3’) and BRU-P (5’AAATCTTTCCCCCGAAGGGCAC-3’), targeting a 4-bp
polymorphic region within the 72-bp amplicon. Both
probes were synthesized with a 6-carboxyfluorescein
reporter molecule attached at the 5’ end and Black Hole
Quencher 1 on the 3’ end. Each final PCR reaction mix
contained 2 μl of DNA template and 18 μl of PCR master mixture containing 1 × LightCycler Faststart DNA
Master HybProbe mix (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN), 4 mM MgCl2, 0.4 μM of each primer and
0.2 μM of probe. The LightCycler thermal cycling conditions were 95°C for 8 min followed by 45 cycles of 95°
C for 5 sec and 60°C for 5 sec ending in a 45°C hold for
1 min 15 sec. A panel of 54 well characterized Brucella
strains and 28 near-neighbors, including 5 Ochrobactrum strains [31] were evaluated by the assay. Positive
results are expressed in log scale as crossing threshold
values (Ct) of fluorescence released above the no-template control baseline of 0.01 following each amplification as described by the manufacturer.
16S rRNA gene analysis

The full length amplicon of 16S rRNA gene was generated using the BO2 cell-lysate DNA and sequenced
using the BigDye terminator cycle 3.1 sequencing kit
(ABI, Foster City, CA) as described previously [31]. A
comparative full-length sequence analysis of BO2 was
performed with the consensus 16S rRNA gene sequence
of Brucella spp. [31], and the Ochrobactrum

intermedium type strain (GeneBank accession no.
AM114411T) along with that of the B. inopinata BO1T
strain (GeneBank accession no. EU053207) using the
GCG Wisconsin software package (version 10.2;
Accelrys, San Diego, CA) and MEGA 4.0 [31,46].
Omp2a/2b and recA genes analysis

The full-length outer membrane porin genes omp2a and
omp2b, and also the recA gene of BO2 were sequenced
[33,45], and compared with sequences of BO1 T and
other Brucella and Ochrobactrum spp. available in GenBank. Contigs were assembled and edited before multiple sequence alignments were constructed in the
DNASTAR Lasergene 8 genetic analysis software suite
(DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). Neighbor-joining consensus trees inferred from 1000 bootstrap replicates
were constructed using MEGA version 4.0 [46].
MLSA typing

To assess the relation of BO2 with other classical Brucella
spp. and BO1T, the multi locus sequence analysis (MLSA)
primer sets were used to amplify and sequence nine discrete house-keeping genes as described previously [47].
Multiple sequences were aligned and neighbor-joining
phylogenetic trees were constructed as described above.
Sequence identities

Similarity values reported throughout the text and in
Table 2 were calculated from estimates of evolutionary
divergence between the sequences represented in the corresponding dendograms. All results are based on the pairwise analysis of inclusive sequences using the Maximum
Composite Likelihood method in MEGA 4.0 [46]. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated
from the dataset.
MLVA typing

Molecular typing of the BO2 strain based on multiplelocus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis
(MLVA) was investigated by examining fifteen Brucella
spp. VNTR genetic markers (MLVA-15) [48,49], and a
distance tree was generated in BioNumerics v.5.1
(Applied Maths, Saint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) by clustering analysis using the unweighted-pair group method
with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) and saved in newick
format. Tree manipulations and labeling were done in
MEGA 4.0 [46].
