Abstract
Background: The L-lactate and D-lactate dehydrogenases, which are involved in the reduction of
pyruvate to L(-)-lactate and D(+)-lactate, belong to evolutionarily unrelated enzyme families. The
genes encoding L-LDH have been used as a model for gene duplication due to the multiple paralogs
found in eubacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes. Phylogenetic studies have suggested that
several gene duplication events led to the main isozymes of this gene family in chordates, but little
is known about the evolution of L-Ldh in invertebrates. While most invertebrates preferentially
oxidize L-lactic acid, several species of mollusks, a few arthropods and polychaetes were found to
have exclusively D-LDH enzymatic activity. Therefore, it has been suggested that L-LDH and DLDH are mutually exclusive. However, recent characterization of putative mammalian D-LDH with
significant similarity to yeast proteins showing D-LDH activity suggests that at least mammals have
the two naturally occurring forms of LDH specific to L- and D-lactate. This study describes the
phylogenetic relationships of invertebrate L-LDH and D-LDH with special emphasis on
crustaceans, and discusses gene duplication events during the evolution of L-Ldh.
Results: Our phylogenetic analyses of L-LDH in vertebrates are consistent with the general view
that the main isozymes (LDH-A, LDH-B and LDH-C) evolved through a series of gene duplications
after the vertebrates diverged from tunicates. We report several gene duplication events in the
crustacean, Daphnia pulex, and the leech, Helobdella robusta. Several amino acid sequences with
strong similarity to putative mammalian D-LDH and to yeast DLD1 with D-LDH activity were
found in both vertebrates and invertebrates.
Conclusion: The presence of both L-Ldh and D-Ldh genes in several chordates and invertebrates
suggests that the two enzymatic forms are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Although, the
evolution of L-Ldh has been punctuated by multiple events of gene duplication in both vertebrates
and invertebrates, a shared evolutionary history of this gene in the two groups is apparent.
Moreover, the high degree of sequence similarity among D-LDH amino acid sequences suggests
that they share a common evolutionary history.

Background
The reduction of pyruvate to L(-)-lactate and D(+)-lactate
is catalyzed by different NAD-dependent enzymes, the Llactate (L-LDH: L-lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC
1.1.1.27) and D-lactate dehydrogenases (D-LDH: D-lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.28) as well as by
NAD-independent (cytochrome) enzymes (DLD: D-lactate ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.2.4).
Despite their apparent functional similarity, these classes
of enzymes are selective for the D/L chirality of the substrate [1]. Studies on the primary amino acid structures of
L-LDH and D-LDH suggest that the genes encoding them
are not evolutionarily related [2,3] and that their products
belong to larger families of enzymes: L(-)-LDHs belong to
the L-specific NAD-dependent dehydrogenases, while
D(+)-LDHs belong to the D-isomer specific 2-hydroxy
acid dehydrogenases and the FAD-binding oxidoreductase/transferase type 4 family.
L-LDH has been among the most studied enzyme families,
but very little is known about the structure, function, and
kinetics of D-LDH [4,5]. The main question in the evolution
of L-LDH relates to the orthology of the gene loci encoding
the proteins with various enzyme activities [6,7]. While LLDHs have been extensively studied in vertebrates, there is
much less information on these enzymes in invertebrates.
With the availability of new L-Ldh sequences from two crustaceans (Daphnia pulex in the Branchiopoda, and a second
malacostracan, the porcelain crab, Petrolisthes cinctipes in the
Decapoda) and a few other invertebrates such as the leech
Helobdella robusta, the polychaete Capitella capitata, and the
tunicate Ciona intestinalis, we sought to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between invertebrate and protochordate L-LDHs and those of vertebrates, and to elucidate
the evolutionary relationship among invertebrate L-Ldhs.
Moreover, the recent description of mammalian D-LDH
enzymes that show significant similarity to yeast proteins
with D-LDH activity [5] prompted our search for sequences
with putative D-LDH activity in both vertebrate and invertebrate genomes.

Results
Alignments and phylogenetic analyses of L-LDH amino
acid sequences
The L-LDH alignment used in phylogenetic analyses
includes 315 amino acids, with 68 constant characters
and 214 parsimony-informative characters. Maximumparsimony (MP) analysis of 49 L-LDH sequences using
the tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) algorithm found
two most parsimonious trees of 1982 steps long with a
consistency index (CI) = 0.48, a homoplasy index (HI) =
0.51 and a retention index (RI) = 0.63. The uncorrected
number of amino acid differences per site between invertebrate and chordate groups is 0.38 ± 0.019.

Phylogenetic trees generated by MP and Neighbor-joining
(NJ, Figure 1) and Bayesian Inference (BI, Figure 2) all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/268

support a deuterostome cluster. The only exception is the
echinoderm, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, which groups
with nematodes, although bootstrap support for this phylogenetic relationship is extremely low (Figure 1). The vertebrate sequences form a well-supported cluster with the
LDH-A and LDH-B isozymes separating into distinct
groups. Even so, there are examples of species whose A, B
and C isozymes cluster with one another (e.g. Xenopus
laevis).
The arthropod LDH sequences form a well-resolved cluster, as do the insects within it. Two copies of Ldh were
found in the Daphnia pulex genome, and three copies in
the Helobdella robusta genome. As with other cases of gene
duplication outside chordates, the suffixes A, B and C do
not denote orthology to the vertebrate A, B and C isozymes. The predicted protein sequences from the two
Daphnia paralogs show 0.17 ± 0.012 amino acid divergence (p-distance) and 0.224 ± 0.014 nucleotide divergence (p-distance) in the coding regions. They cluster with
one another indicating that this gene duplication occurred
after the divergence of Daphnia from the other crustaceans, the decapods Carcinus maenas and Petrolisthes cinctipes (Figure 1 and 2). The insects and crustaceans are
reciprocally monophyletic in the MP and NJ trees (Figure
1), although bootstrap support for the crustacean node is
very low. Conversely, very strong support for an arthropod clade in which the crustaceans are paraphyletic relative to the insects was obtained in the BI tree (Figure 2).
The level of amino acid divergence between the three
Helobdella robusta LDH proteins (0.32 ± 0.026, 0.46 ±
0.028, 0.52 ± 0.028) is higher than that between the Daphnia copies or Fundulus heteroclitus (LDH-B and LDH-C,
0.21 ± 0.028) and much higher than that between the
recently diverged Xenopus laevis copies (0.019 ± 0.008,
0.049 ± 0.013, 0.063 ± 0.014). Moreover, the relationships among the three genes differs among the phylogenetic trees. Only two of the three H. robusta genes (Ldh-A
and Ldh-B) are clearly paralogous in the MP/NJ tree, and
duplicated after the divergence of H. robusta from the
other annelid in the analysis (the polychaete, Capitella
capitata). However, the annelid cluster also contains the
trematode flatworm, Clonorchis sinensis, although bootstrap support for these relationships is low (Figure 1). The
annelid/trematode clade is also recovered in the BI tree
(Figure 2), although in this case, C. capitata is the sister
group to the three leech and the flatworm sequences.
Alignments and phylogenetic analyses of D-LDH amino
acid sequences
The D-LDH alignment included 486 amino acids with 73
conserved sites and 319 parsimony informative sites. The
uncorrected number of amino acid differences per site
averaged over all sequence pairs between chordates and
invertebrates is 0.41 ± 0.015.

In general, the topology of the NJ tree generated from these
sequences (Figure 3) shows that the deuterostomes form a
distinct cluster relative to the other animals, as expected.
For example, there is strong bootstrap support for a vertebrate cluster, and the non-vertebrate deuterostomes (C.
intestinalis and S. purpuratus) cluster with them, although
unexpectedly, C. intestinalis (a tunicate) clusters with S. purpuratus (an echinoderm) instead of the vertebrates. Relationships among the other invertebrates are not well
resolved. For example, the annelids, H. robusta and C. capitata, do not cluster with each other, and the protostomes
themselves do not form a monophyletic group (H. robusta
is the sister taxon to all the other animals except C. elegans),
but bootstrap support for several of the invertebrate nodes
is low. Overall, this tree strongly suggests that D-Ldh was
present in the common ancestor of animals.

Discussion
L-lactate dehydrogenases in vertebrate and invertebrate
evolution
The majority of taxa of jawed vertebrates contain three isozymes of L-LDH (LDH-A, LDH-B and LDH-C) encoded by
three loci. The M form (LDH-A) is found predominantly
in white skeletal muscle (fast twitch glycolytic fibers) and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/268

is best suited for pyruvate reduction in anaerobic conditions, while the H form (LDH-B) is found in more aerobic
tissues such as heart and brain and is most efficient for lactate oxidation. The X form (LDH-C) is found in various
tissues such as the spermatozoa of mammals and birds,
the eye lenses of birds and crocodilian and the liver and
eye of teleosts [8,9].
It is commonly accepted that new metabolic capacities of
L-LDH enzymes have often arisen by gene duplications in
addition to more orthodox evolutionary changes in existing genes. For this reason the Ldh gene family has been
used as a model for gene duplication in vertebrate evolution [8,10]. It is generally accepted that the Ldh genes of
jawed vertebrates arose as a series of gene duplications in
early vertebrate evolution, after the divergence of vertebrates from tunicates. However, the succession of these
gene duplication events is not well understood [9,11,12].
Two main evolutionary scenarios have been proposed.
The classical scenario involves the duplication of an LdhA-like locus in Agnatha (lampreys have a single LDH
form) that gave rise to Ldh-A and Ldh-B. A second round
of gene duplication involved Ldh-B and gave rise to Ldh-B
and Ldh-C. Several phylogenetic studies support this

hypothesis of an original Ldh-A and Ldh-B gene duplication followed by more recent and independent origins of
the Ldh-C genes in teleost fish, Xenopus laevis, pigeon and
mammals [7,10,13]. A second school of thought suggests
that the primordial vertebrate LDH was an LDH-C like
enzyme. This hypothesis emerged from phylogenetic
reconstructions and from the observation that the single
LDH isozyme of the primitive agnathan, the sea lamprey,
is immunologically more similar to LDH-C in teleost fish
than to LDH-A or LDH-B [14-16].
Our phylogenetic analyses of L-LDH isozymes are consistent with the general view of a major gene duplication
event near the origin of vertebrates. Both NJ and MP phylogenies suggest that the vertebrate isozymes LDH-A and
LDH-B evolved through a series of gene duplications soon
after the vertebrates diverged from tunicates. The main
difference between the MP, NJ and BI reconstructions is
that MP and BI supports a sister group relationship
between LDH in Petromyson marinus, the only chordate
with a single LDH locus, and all of the other vertebrate
LDHs. Conversely, this sequence clusters with fish LDH-A
in the NJ tree. Although the controversial phylogenetic
position of the LDH-C isozymes cannot be easily settled,
it is clear from our results that Ldh-C in mammals, X. laevis
and Fundulus have independent, derived origins from
either Ldh-A or Ldh-B-like ancestors.
The relationship of invertebrate and protochordate Ldh to
vertebrate Ldh is not well understood. Although most
invertebrates seem to possess one copy of L-Ldh [17-19],
several events of gene duplication involving nonvertebrates have been reported in crustaceans, barley [20] and
in the psychrophilic bacterium, Bacillus psychrosaccharolyticus [21]. In studies of crustacean LDH, protein electrophoresis has detected the presence of two Ldh loci in the
northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica, the Antarctic krill
Euphausia superba [22], the lobster Homarus americanus
[23], the snow crab Chionoecetes opilio [24], the amphipod
Hyallela azteca (J. Witt personal communication), the
cladoceran Daphnia magna [25] and possibly Daphnia carinata [26] and Daphnia cephalata [27]. All of these crustaceans except Daphnia belong to the class, Malacostraca.
Further work will be required to determine if a gene duplication occurred early in this crustacean lineage (as
occurred in vertebrates), or if these duplicated genes have
independent origins within the class. The two copies of LLdh in D. pulex group with one another in our phylogenetic analyses, suggesting that they do not represent an
ancient crustacean duplication, but analysis of other branchiopods will be required to determine when this duplication occurred. Moreover, the MP and NJ trees suggest that
insects and crustaceans are reciprocally monophyletic, but
the crustaceans are paraphyletic relative to the insects in
the BI tree, with strong support. The possibility of crustacean paraphyly has been suggested in other phylogenetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/268

studies involving a variety of markers [28-30], but these
relationships have not been definitively resolved.
The only other invertebrate in our analysis with multiple
copies of L-Ldh is the leech, H. robusta, with three copies.
Two of the copies appear to be unique to this taxon, but
our sample of sequences is not sufficient to determine
when this duplication occurred. A very long branch connects Ldh-C in H. robusta with the flatworm instead of the
other annelids in the NJ tree, while Ldh-B clusters with the
flatworm in the BI tree. Additional annelid and flatworm
taxa must be analyzed to "break up" these branches, and
to examine the relationship between these two phyla.
What is clear from our phylogenetic analyses is that the
LDH genes of Arthropods are significantly distinct from
the LDH genes of other invertebrates, including annelid
and nematode worms.
LDH allozyme polymorphism has been intensely studied
in Daphnia including species with strong habitat specificity. For example,D. pulex inhabits mainly freshwater
ponds throughout North America and Europe that lack
fish, while its closest relative, Daphnia pulicaria, inhabits
lakes and is able to coexist with fish, which are efficient
predators of these limnetic zooplankters. The two ecological species can be distinguished based on a diagnostic
LDH allozyme polymorphism with a "slow" (S) allele in
D. pulex and a "fast" (F) allele in D. pulicaria [31]. However, the situation is complicated by hybridization and
transitions from cyclical to obligate parthenogenesis
[32,33]. Although there are distinct mitochondrial lineages in the two species in North America [34], there are
many lake populations of Daphnia that have a D. pulicaria
LDH profile (F), but a D. pulex-like mitochondrial DNA
(T. Crease, unpublished data).
The maintenance of the LDH-F allele in lake populations of
Daphnia, regardless of maternal origin, suggests that LDH
genotypes differ in physiological performance, which may
affect fitness. This is the case in the teleost, Fundulus heteroclitus [35], where the frequency of two LDH-B alleles shows
clinal variation with latitude and environmental temperature. In addition, the fish allozymes show differences in
kinetics related to temperature suggesting selection has
favored a particular form of the LDH protein. Further studies on Ldh genes from populations of both the lake and
pond Daphnia species are necessary to determine which of
the two L-Ldh loci is responsible for the S/F polymorphism,
and to provide evidence for the presence or absence of
selection on the polymorphic locus. This work will be complemented by the examination of the enzyme kinetics of
the allozymes themselves.
D-lactate dehydrogenases
Enzymes that oxidize D-lactic acid have been mainly identified in lower organisms such as prokaryotes and fungi

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:268

(e.g., Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, yeast) in which they
play an important role in anaerobic energy metabolism.
While most invertebrates preferentially oxidize L-lactic
acid, several species of mollusks (the oyster Crassostrea virginica, the mussel Mytilus edulis, the limpet Acmaea unicolor, the chiton Middendorffia caprearum, the octopus
Eledone cirrosa), a few arthropods (horseshoe crab, spiders,
scorpions) and one polychaete, Nereis sp., were found to
have exclusively D-LDH enzymatic activity [36,37]. Therefore, it had been suggested that the L-LDH and D-LDH
enzymes are mutually exclusive. However, Flick and
Konieczny [5] identified and characterized a putative
mammalian D-LDH enzyme that shows substantial similarity to three yeast proteins with D-LDH activity. This
suggests that mammals have the two naturally occurring
forms (D- and L-) of LDH. Moreover, we identified a DLdh gene in the genomes of several taxa that also possess
L-Ldh including D. pulex, several non-mammalian vertebrates, the urchin, S. purpuratus, and C. elegans, suggesting
that the possession of both forms of this enzyme is phylogenetically widespread. Further research will be required
to determine the phylogenetic distribution of D-Ldh in
animals, to understand why it has been retained in some
groups but not others, and to determine the different roles
that L-LDH and D-LDH play in such diverse animals.
Comparisons of taxa with both types of enzymes to close
relatives with only one type would be informative in this
regard. In addition, it will be interesting to determine
whether the "missing" enzyme in such cases is the result
of gene inactivation, degradation into a pseudogene, deletion, or is expressed at such low levels that the enzyme is
not detected in typical assays.

Conclusion
The presence of both L-Ldh and D-Ldh in several chordates
and invertebrates suggests that the two enzymatic forms
are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Moreover, the high
degree of sequence similarity among D-LDH amino acid
sequences suggests that they share a common evolutionary history. No recent duplications of D-Ldh have yet been
observed. In contrast, the L-Ldh gene family is characterized by a history of duplication and deletion events, particularly within vertebrates. However, duplications have
also been identified in several invertebrate taxa suggesting
that the occurrence of isozymes whose activity is specific
to different tissues or developmental stages is a common
theme in L-LDH evolution.

invertebrate sequences were used as the query. Blast
searches were also performed on invertebrate genome
projects from which a few unannotated sequences were
retrieved. The deduced amino acid sequence for the porcelain crab, Petrolisthes cinctipes was obtained from a cloned
EST that contained the full length cDNA sequence [38].
The alignment of amino acid sequences was conducted
using CLUSTAL W [39] with a gap opening penalty of 10
and a gap length penalty of 0.1. Minor adjustments to the
alignments were made manually. To avoid ambiguity due
to extensive sequence variability and length variability in
the amino terminal arm, alignment positions 1–30 were
removed from the L-LDH alignment in all analyses. Without this ambiguous region, the alignment of the ingroup
taxa included six gaps, while the addition of plant
sequences to the alignment resulted in four additional
gaps. Phylogenetic analyses were inferred in MEGA4 [40],
PAUP, version 4.0 [41] and MrBayes V3.1.2. [42] using
three analytical approaches: Neighbor-joining (NJ), Maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (BI). NJ
trees were constructed from pairwise amino acid distances
estimated using a Poisson correction. MP trees were estimated using a heuristic search algorithm with 100 replicates, sequences added at random and tree bisectionreconnection branch swapping. Amino acids were treated
as unordered characters with equal weight and gaps were
treated as "missing". The stability of both phylogenetic
hypotheses was assessed with bootstrap analyses (100 replicates for MP and 1000 replicates for NJ). Analysis of the
amino acid data was also conducted using the Bayesian
inference (BI) method with a fixed rate model of amino
acid substitution. The fixed rate model WAG was estimated
by allowing "model jumping" between nine fixed-rate
amino acid models. Runs of 1,000,000 generations were
executed, with a sampling frequency of 10, a burn-in
parameter of 25,000. Stability of the likelihood scores was
assessed in preliminary trials before setting the burn-in
parameter. To confirm that the results converged to the
same topology, we repeated the analysis three times.
