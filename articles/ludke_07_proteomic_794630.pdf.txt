Abstract
Background: The influence of the membrane-bound AAA+ protease FtsH on membrane and
cytoplasmic proteins of Corynebacterium glutamicum was investigated in this study. For the analysis
of the membrane fraction, anion exchange chromatography was combined with SDS-PAGE, while
the cytoplasmic protein fraction was studied by conventional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
Results: In contrast to the situation in other bacteria, deletion of C. glutamicum ftsH has no
significant effect on growth in standard minimal medium or response to heat or osmotic stress. On
the proteome level, deletion of the ftsH gene resulted in a strong increase of ten cytoplasmic and
membrane proteins, namely biotin carboxylase/biotin carboxyl carrier protein (accBC),
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gap), homocysteine methyltransferase (metE), malate
synthase (aceB), isocitrate lyase (aceA), a conserved hypothetical protein (NCgl1985), succinate
dehydrogenase A (sdhA), succinate dehydrogenase B (sdhB), succinate dehydrogenase CD (sdhCD),
and glutamate binding protein (gluB), while 38 cytoplasmic and membrane-associated proteins
showed a decreased abundance. The decreasing amount of succinate dehydrogenase A (sdhA) in
the cytoplasmic fraction of the ftsH mutant compared to the wild type and its increasing abundance
in the membrane fraction indicates that FtsH might be involved in the cleavage of a membrane
anchor of this membrane-associated protein and by this changes its localization.
Conclusion: The data obtained hint to an involvement of C. glutamicum FtsH protease mainly in
regulation of energy and carbon metabolism, while the protease is not involved in stress response,
as found in other bacteria.

Background
Corynebacterium glutamicum, is a Gram-positive soil bacterium, which is used for the industrial production of different amino acids, mainly L-glutamate and L-lysine, and of
nucleotides [1,2]. As a member of the Corynebacterinae,

C. glutamicum is closely related to other mycolic acid-containing bacteria, e. g. to the amino acids producer Corynebacterium efficiens and to important pathogens such as
Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
Mycobacterium leprae [3]. Due to the enormous industrial

importance of C. glutamicum, this bacterium is very well
investigated. Its genome was sequenced and published
independently by different industry-supported groups
recently [4,5] and different global analyses techniques are
available including transcriptome [6], metabolome [7],
flux [8] and proteome analyses [9].
We are interested in nitrogen metabolism and nitrogen
control in C. glutamicum (for review, see [10-12]) and
recently identified proteolysis as a new regulatory mechanism in nitrogen regulation [13]. Different proteases,
namely ClpXP and ClpCP [14] as well as FtsH are
involved in the degradation of nitrogen signal transduction protein GlnK [13]. The identified enzymes are members of the AAA+ protease family. These proteases and
protein disassembly machines are found in all kingdoms
of life and often exhibit crucial regulatory functions (for
recent reviews, see [15,16]).
In C. glutamicum, an effect of FtsH on the degradation of
nitrogen signal control protein GlnK was reported [13].
The deletion of the ftsH gene is very well tolerated by C.
glutamicum cells and obvious detrimental effects of an ftsH
deletion could not be observed. Since we were interested
in the function of this protease, we initiated a proteomic
study and investigated the influence of an ftsH deletion on
membrane and cytoplasmic protein profiles.

Results
Influence of FtsH on growth of C. glutamicum strains
Mutations of ftsH were described in different bacteria. The
effect of these mutations are remarkably species-specific
and range from drastic growth impairment in Escherichia
coli [17] to effects on sporulation, development and stress
response in Bacillus subtilis [18,19] and Caulobacter crescentus [20]. When growth of C. glutamicum wild type strains
ATCC 13032 and strain ∆ftsH was analyzed, only a minor
effect of the ftsH deletion was observed (Fig. 1A). Doubling times of wild type and mutant strain were very similar in standard minimal medium (2 h 18 min versus 2 h
38 min). Next, the influence of increased temperature on
growth was tested. Neither growth at increased temperature (37°C instead of 30°C) had a significant detrimental
effect nor exposure of cells grown at 30°C to a sudden
heat shock of 37 and 39°C, respectively (data not shown).
Also when the ftsH mutant was exposed to osmotic stress
applied either by growth in medium with increased osmolarity or as sudden osmotic shock due to sodium chloride
addition, no significant growth defect compared to the
wild type was detectable (S. Morbach and U. Meyer, personal communication). Obviously, FtsH plays a less crucial role in C. glutamicum compared to other bacteria. To
identify FtsH targets in the cell, proteome studies were carried out.

Differences in the membrane proteome of wild type and
ftsH deletion strain
FtsH is a membrane-bound AAA+ protease and therefore
we started our investigations with an analysis of membrane proteins. While the separation of C. glutamicum
membrane proteins by 2-D PAGE is restricted to those
with two or less transmembrane helices [21,22], recently,
a technique was established to separate highly hydrophobic proteins of the membrane fraction by anion exchange
chromatography and 1-D SDS-PAGE [23]. This technique
was applied for the comparison of membrane proteins
from wild type and corresponding ftsH deletion strain.

The FtsH protease was identified for the wild type in a
faint gel band in all three biological replicates, while this
band was absent in the deletion strain (Figure 2). Compared to the wild type, five different proteins showed an
increased abundance in the ftsH mutant strain (Table 1),
namely all subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase complex (sdhA, sdhB and sdhCD), glutamate binding protein
(gluB) and homocysteine methyltransferase (metE).
Upregulation of protein concentration did not exceed a
factor of five. While the succinate dehydrogenase complex
could be a direct substrate of FtsH, GluB is a lipidanchored glutamate binding protein [24], which is
located at the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane.
Therefore, GluB must be an indirect target or processed by
FtsH before secretion to the external site of the cell. C.
glutamicum contains two homocysteine methyltransferares (metE and metH) catalyzing the final reaction of
methionine synthesis, yet only metH requires vitamin B12
(cobalamin) as a cofactor [25]. Upregulation of metE
could indicate that more of this enzyme is required for
methionine synthesis, maybe due to reduced import of
cobalamin in the ftsH deletion mutant, though further
experiments are needed to verify this hypothesis. Interestingly, the ftsH deletion also influenced the abundance of
ClpC, the ATPase component of the ClpCP protease complex. This protein was down-regulated in the mutant compared to the wild type by a factor of 0.4. However, the
significance of this putative cross-talk between AAA+ proteases in C. glutamicum needs further investigation.
Additionally, a role of FtsH in the response to nitrogen
starvation and to improving nitrogen conditions after a
starvation period was tested. Compared to the wild type,
NADH dehydrogenase (ndh), a putative integral membrane protein (cg0952) and the ATPase component of an
ABC-type sugar transport system (msiK) were down-regulated by a factor of 0.5 (data not shown).
Comparison of cytoplasmic protein profiles
In addition to the membrane proteome also the cytoplasmic protein fraction of wild type and ftsH deletion was
analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D

PAGE, Figure 3). By this approach, six proteins were found
in increasing amounts, namely the biotin carboxylase/
biotin carrier protein (accBC), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gap), malate synthase (aceB), isocitrate lyase (aceA), a conserved hypothetical protein
(NCgl1985) and homocysteine methyltransferase (metE),
which was also identified as an upregulated protein in the
membrane fraction. AccBC was upregulated more than
50-fold, while GAP-DH was upregulated by a factor of
four. 37 different protein spots showed a decreased abundance in the mutant. Almost one third of the proteins
identified (presented in Table 2) is clearly involved in carbon and energy metabolism. These include the maltooligosyl trehalose synthase (treY), the 1,4-alpha-glucan
branching enzyme (glgB), fumarate hydratase (fum), a
putative L-lactate dehydrogenase (lldA), glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (gap), phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase (ppc), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component
(aceE), an acyl-CoA synthetase (fadD4), succinate dehydrogenase A (sdhA) and transaldolase (tal). Interestingly,
GAPDH is present in two spots, which differ in their
approximate pI, an upregulated one (see above) spot
number 2 in Figure 4 and a downregulated spot (number
30), indicating a posttranslational modification of the
protein. Furthermore in the ftsH deletion strain succinate
dehydrogenase A (sdhA) is less present in the cytoplasm
but enriched in the membrane fraction. This indicates that
FtsH is involved, either directly or indirectly, in the release
of this succinate dehydrogenase subunit from the membrane into the cytoplasm. Since FtsH lacks a robust
unfolding activity, a cleavage of SdhA and release of the
protein from the complex by FtsH is rather unlikely. Other
identified proteins with decreased abundance were parts
of amino acid metabolism such as glutamine synthetase
(glnA), aspartate-ammonium-lyase (aspA), succinyldiaminopimelate desuccinylase (dapE), and dihydroxyacid dehydratase (ilvD) (Fig. 4). As in the case of the membrane proteome, the influence of FtsH on the cytoplasmic
protein profile in dependence of the nitrogen status of the
cell was analyzed. For unknown reasons, 2-D gels of proteins isolated from nitrogen-starved ∆ftsH cells revealed in
contrast to the wild type (see also [26]) reproducibly
strong horizontal streaking. The reason for this FtsH-specific effect, which made comparisons impossible, is
unknown and could not be prevented by alternative gel
loading techniques such as cup loading (C. Lück, personal
communication).

Discussion
Data which hint to an involvement of FtsH in GlnK signal
transduction protein degradation [13] prompted us to
investigate the influence of this AAA+ protease on membrane and cytoplasmic protein profiles in C. glutamicum.
Using a combination of anion exchange chromatography
and SDS-PAGE for membrane protein analysis and 2-D

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/6

PAGE for cytoplasmic proteins, we were able to show that
FtsH regulates only a few proteins under the growth conditions tested. However, since the applied method only
covers about 10% of the C. glutamicum membrane proteome [23], some FtsH targets may have been missed due
to technical limitations. For example, the FtsH target GlnK
is degraded depending on FtsH but proteolysis is also
influenced by ClpCP and ClpXP [13]. In contrast to the
situation in E. coli (for recent review, see [27]), we found
that deletion of the ftsH gene is tolerated by C. glutamicum
cells very well, although this gene is conserved in all other
corynebacterial genome sequences published so far, i. e.
in the C. diphtheriae [28], C. efficiens [29] and Corynebacterium jeikeium [30] genome, and although no obvious paralog of the ftsH gene is encoded in the C. glutamicum
genome. Obvious detrimental effects of an ftsH deletion
were not observed. In this respect the C. glutamicum results
resemble the situation in B. subtilis and C. crescentus. Also
for these organisms, a less severe effect of ftsH mutation
compared to an E. coli mutant was shown. In B. subtilis,
FtsH is involved in sporulation, stress adaptation and protein secretion [18,19], and the effect of its deletion on the
cytosolic proteome has been studied [31]. FtsH deletion
resulted in increased levels of an arginase, a protein similar to a quinone oxidoreductase, and penicillin binding
protein, but for the latter direct proteolytic action could be
excluded and for the other two proteins it was not verified.
FtsH of M. tuberculosis, which is phylogenetically closely
related to C. glutamicum, was heterologously expressed in
E. coli, and proteolytic activity against the known E. coli
substrates heat shock transcription factor σ32 protein, protein translocation subunit SecY, and bacteriophage λCII
repressor protein was observed [32]. For M. tuberculosis no
experimental verification exists if SecY is indeed a target of
FtsH, and our data for C. glutamicumdoes not support this
hypothesis, but it does not completely rule this out, too.
For C. crescentus an involvement of FtsH in development,
stress response and heat shock control was shown [20].
The ftsH gene is expressed transiently after temperature
upshift and in stationary phase in this organism, while
during normal growth conditions FtsH is dispensable. In
C. crescentus a mutation of ftsH influences chaperones,
DnaK is derepressed under normal temperature compared
to the wild type, while an influence on GroEL abundance
was not observed. In contrast, the ftsH deletion in C.
glutamicum had no influence on DnaK and even less
GroEL was observed compared to the wild type. Further
differences besides chaperone activation are sporulation
and cell cycle proteins, processes which are absent in C.
glutamicum. The majority of proteins identified to be differentially synthesized in dependence of FtsH C. glutamicum seem to be involved in carbon and energy
metabolism.

Conclusion
The data obtained in this study, indicate that C. glutamicum AAA+ metalloprotease FtsH is not involved in the cellular response to heat or osmotic stress as shown in other
bacteria. An astonishingly small amount of membrane
and cytoplasmic proteins is affected by an ftsH deletion.
From these data an involvement of FtsH in regulation of
energy and carbon metabolism as well as in amino acid
biosynthesis is indicated.

and the pellet was suspended in and transferred to prewarmed minimal medium without nitrogen source. The
nitrogen-deprived cells were incubated at 30°C under aeration.
Polymerase chain reaction
To verify the deletion of the ftsH gene, PCR experiments
were carried out. Primers were designed to anneal approx.
214 bps up and down stream of ftsH gene (2562 bps)
(ftsH+200up fw: 5'-GTG GGC TAC GGA CTT GAT TTC G3'; ftsH+200down rv: 5'-GAA CCA ACT CTT CAT GGC
CCT C-3'). Chromosomal DNA prepared by phenol-chloroform extraction was used as template. PCR was performed using Taq polymerase and the following program:
95°C 5 min; 30 cycles (95°C 30 s; 64°C 30 s; 72°C 3
min) followed by 72°C 10 min and cooling down to 4°C.
PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis [35].
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
To demonstrate deletion of ftsH on protein level, cells
were disrupted band fractionated as described below or 2D PAGE. Cytoplasmic proteins and membrane fraction of
the wild type ATCC13032 and the deletion strain were
separated by Tricine-buffered 9.5% SDS gels as described
[36]. After SDS-PAGE proteins were transferred onto a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, ImmobilonP, pore size 0.45 µm, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) by
semi-dry electroblotting. Immunodetection of FtsH was
performed with antibodies against peptide fragments of E.

Membrane proteomics
For analysis of membrane proteins, a combination of
anion exchange chromatography and SDS-PAGE was
applied as described previously [23]. For this method,
cells were disrupted by French Press treatment; the membrane fraction was separated from cell debris and cytoplasm by differential (ultra)centrifugation and washed
with 2.5 M NaBr to remove membrane-associated proteins. Membrane proteins were subsequently solubilised
in buffer containing 2% ASB-14 and separated by anion
exchange chromatography. After TCA precipitation and
SDS-PAGE, gels were scanned and analyzed using the LabScan software package (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg,
Germany). The scanner was calibrated with a greyscale
marker (Kodak) and the same settings applied for all gels.
Scanning was carried out at 300 dpi and 8 bit greyscale.
Gel bands were quantified relative to each other by densitometry using the software scion image (version beta
4.0.2; Scion Corporation). Proteins from three independent experiments (biological replicates) were regarded as
regulated if a p-value < 0.1 was calculated for a Student's
t-test (paired, two-tailed).
2-D PAGE, staining and protein analysis
For 2-D PAGE analyses C. glutamicum cells were disrupted
using glass beads and a Q-BIOgene FastPrep FP120 instrument (Q-BIOgene, Heidelberg, Germany) by lyzing the
cells four times for 30 sec and 6.5 m sec-1 in the presence
of the proteinase inhibitor Complete as recommended by
the supplier (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Proteins were
separated by ultracentrifugation in cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein fractions [37,21]. For classical 2D PAGE, only the cytoplasmic proteins were analyzed further. Protein concentrations were determined according
to Dulley and Grieve [38]. For isoelectric focusing (IEF) 24
cm pre-cast IPG strips pI 4–7 and an IPGphor IEF unit
(Amersham Biosiences, Freiburg, Germany) were used as
described [39]. 100 µg and 200 µg of protein were loaded
by rehydration for 24 h in a sample buffer containing 6 M
urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% Pharmalyte (3–10)
and 0.4% DTT. The isoelectric focusing was performed for
48 000 Vh. The run for the second dimension was carried
out using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and an Ettan Dalt II
system (Amersham Biosiences, Freiburg, Germany). After
electrophoresis 2-D gels were stained with Coomassie
brilliant Blue [35]. The Coomassie-stained gels were
aligned using the Delta2D software, version 3.3 (Decodon, Greifswald, Germany). All samples were separated at
least twice by 2-D PAGE to minimize irregularities (tech-

nical replicates). To validate the results, each comparison
of interest was performed using samples from at least
three independent experiments (biological replicates).
The Delta2D software (version 3.3) was also used for spot
quantification. Proteins were regarded as regulated if (i)
the corresponding ratios referring to the relative volumes
of the spots changed more than two-fold and if (ii) this
regulation pattern was found in all biological and technical replicates. All other proteins were classified as "not regulated". Pearson coefficients for wild type gels were higher
than 0.9962, for ftsH gels 0.9929, and for the comparisons
of wild type and ftsH mutant 0.9510.

Protein identification
Protein spots or bands with significantly altered abundance in the ftsH mutant compared to the wild type were
analyzed by trypric in-gel digest and MALDI-ToF-MS as
described earlier [26].
