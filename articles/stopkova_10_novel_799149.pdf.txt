Abstract
Background: Chemical communication in mammals involves globular lipocalins that protect and transport
pheromones during their passage out of the body. Efficient communication via this protein - pheromone complex
is essential for triggering multiple responses including aggression, mate choice, copulatory behaviour, and onset
and synchronization of oestrus. The roles of lipocalins in communication were studied in many organisms and
especially in mice (i.e. Mus musculus domesticus) which excrete Major Urinary Proteins (Mup) in excessive amounts
in saliva and urine. Other mammals, however, often lack the genes for Mups or their expression is very low.
Therefore, we aimed at characterization of candidate lipocalins in Myodes glareolus which are potentially linked to
chemical communication. One of them is Aphrodisin which is a unique lipocalin that was previously described
from hamster vaginal discharge and is known to carry pheromones stimulating copulatory behaviour in males.
Results: Here we show that Aphrodisin-like proteins exist in other species, belong to a group of Odorant Binding
Proteins (Obp), and contrary to the expression of Aphrodisin only in hamster genital tract and parotid glands of
females, we have detected these transcripts in both sexes of M. glareolus with the expression confirmed in various
tissues including prostate, prepucial and salivary glands, liver and uterus. On the level of mRNA, we have detected
three different gene variants. To assess their relevance for chemical communication we investigated the occurrence
of particular proteins in saliva, urine and vaginal discharge. On the protein level we confirmed the presence of
Obp2 and Obp3 in both saliva and urine. Appropriate bands in the range of 17-20 kDa from vaginal discharge
were, however, beyond the MS detection limits.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that three novel Obps (Obp1, Obp2, and Obp3) are predominant lipocalins in
Myodes urine and saliva. On the protein level we have detected further variants and thus we assume that similarly
as Major Urinary Proteins in mice, these proteins may be important in chemical communication in this Cricetid
rodent.

Background
Lipocalins are known to be involved in many important
biological processes, of which one of them is chemical
communication. Due to a conservative tertiary structure
forming typical beta barrel all lipocalins share ability to
bind various ligands of different size and structure. For
some of the lipocalin members there already exists evidence for causing significant behavioural effects by their
specific pheromonal ligands. The main lipocalin proteins
studied to date in association with chemical communication are the mouse Major Urinary Proteins (Mup)
secreted predominantly in the urine and saliva and

Odorant Binding Proteins (Obp) with predominant site
of expression in nasal tissue.
In mice, urine is an important source of chemical
information, frequently investigated by conspecifics and
having the ability to elicit various behavioural responses
including aggression, dominance and mate choice [1-6].
The major components of mouse urine are the Major
Urinary Proteins, constituting approximately 90% of all
proteins in the urine. The amount of Mups excreted to
urine is sexually dimorphic, with males expressing more
Mups than females on both mRNA and protein level
[7]. However even the lower amount of Mups in female
urine may be sufficient as a signal of reproductive status,
advertising the beginning of oestrus [8]. Various substances with pheromonal effect bound to Major Urinary

Proteins were identified [3,9-11] and many of studies
have brought the evidence that these Mup-ligand complexes [12-14], unbounded ligands and potentially Mup
itself [4,12] have effect upon the reproductive physiology
of the signal/pheromone receiver.
Mups are coded by high number of genes which have
probably evolved by recent gene duplication and form a
cluster of 21 intact genes and 21 pseudogenes on chromosome 4 [15,16]. Such variability leads to the hypothesis that urine marks may serve for individual odour
discrimination in mice [17]. However, high variability of
Mups is clearly demonstrated only in particular subspecies of the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and
derived laboratory strains and is completely missing in
some other rodent species.
Contrary to Mup sexual dimorphism biased to males
there exists another lipocalin in hamsters, called Aphrodisin, of which the expression is attributed only to
females. Aphrodisin is a lipocalin that was isolated from
hamster vaginal discharge by Singer et al. [18] and is
detected (or it’s ligands) via the vomeronasal organ of
male hamsters. The term Aphrodisin originates from its
functional property to stimulate copulatory behaviour in
male hamsters which were exposed to vaginal odour of
females [19]. Analysis of various fractions of female
vaginal discharge led to the conclusion that this lipocalin itself is responsible for various behavioural and physiological effects [18]. However later studies revealed
that recombinant Aphrodisin produced in E. coli was
clearly less active than Aphrodisin isolated from vaginal
discharge [20]. It, however, remains to be determined
whether 3D structure of lipocalins produced in bacteria
corresponds to the structure detected in mammals that
naturally produce aphrodisin. The effect of Aphrodisin
may be enhanced by various ligands that were detected
in hamster vaginal smears by Briand et al. [21] who
described five specific compounds which are also present in insect pheromone blends. Analysis of the Aphrodisin expression sites revealed that the main tissue
expressing this gene is vagina with the Bartholin’s glands
[22-24], cervix uteri, low level of expression was
detected also in ovaries [23], and moreover in the parotid glands of females [24]. Expression of Aphrodisin is
attributed only to females, nevertheless there is weak
evidence for the absence of Aphrodisin in males,
because there is only one paper [24] from available literature where the researchers analyzed male saliva and
parotid glands and had found no expression. To our
knowledge, there is as yet no published information on
the expression of Aphrodisin in male bulbourethral
glands which are homologous to female Bartholin’s
glands.
According to the protein sequence analysis and of
exon-intron organization, hamster Aphrodisin falls

within the monophyletic group of lipocalins (described
as cluster X) including i.a. mouse Obps, rat Obp1f and
Probasin [25,26]. Protein sequence comparison of Aphrodisin shows the highest similarity with the mouse
Obp1a and Obp1b (~50%) [24] and ~40% similarity
with the rat Obp1f [21]. Our presented novel sequences
on the translated protein level share 59% similarity with
this hamster lipocalin. In mice Odorant Binding Protein
forms heterodimer containing 18 kDa and 19 kDa subunits called Obp1a and Obp1b, which are expressed
mainly in the main olfactory epithelium [27]. In our previous paper [16] we have analyzed public databases
(NCBI) and proposed that the mouse Obp forms a gene
cluster of more than only two Obp variants. On the X
chromosome in the range of 0.5 Mb there are at least 8
Obp genes, including one pseudogene and these genes
can be further divided into three structural groups [16].
Lipocalins linked to the monophyletic cluster X [25],
including all mouse Obp genes, homologous rat Obp
genes from X chromosome and Aphrodisin share typical
sequence characterized by extra two cystein residues
forming CxxxC motif [16]. In addition to the conservative disulfide bond tightening the beta-barel to the Cterminal tail [28] this extra two cystein residues form a
second disulfide bridge characteristic for this group of
lipocalins [29]. Interestingly, this motif also occurs in
some other lipocalin genes, namely Probasin, with chromosomal location next to the Obp cluster, and recently
described hamster’s Male Specific Salivary Protein
(MSP) and Female Lacrimal Protein (FLP) [30-32]. It
suggests that despite the different names, these lipocalins belong to the Obp group and may also act as odorant/pheromone carriers, however, this has to be further
studied.
Obps are known to bind various odorant molecules
[33] and are found through the wide spectrum of animals [27,34-38]. The suggested role of Obp in olfaction
predicts the transport of hydrophobic odorants across
the aqueous mucous layer to the odorant receptors
[39-41], termination of olfactory signals by removing the
odorants from the receptor [35] or enhancing the signal
by maintain the active conformation of olfactory receptors and thus contribute to signal amplification [42,43].
Boudjelal et al. [44] pointed out that the receptor for
Obp is presented in number of tissues unrelated to
olfaction and therefore suggested that the function of
this lipocalin may not be limited only to odorant transport. Another feature of lipocalins is their ability to scavenge for toxic substances or act as an antibacterial
defence. The scavenger function of porcine and bovine
Obp was suggested [45] in an experiment which clearly
showed that Obp binds with high affinity HNE (4hydroxy-2-nonenal), a toxic compound derived from
lipid peroxidation, and therefore can protect living cells

Stopková et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/45

from damage caused by oxidative stress by removing
cytotoxic compounds from the nasal mucus. The antibacterial defence arises from the ability of some lipocalins (i.e. called siderocalins) to bind bacterial
siderophores and thus prevent the bacterial growth
[46-48]. There are few candidate siderocalins in mammals (Lcn1, Lcn2 and Lcn12), however it is possible that
due to the conservative tertiary structure some other
lipocalins may also share this ability [49].
The main goal of this paper was to identify dominant
transcripts/proteins in Myodes glareolus that are
secreted to urine, saliva and vaginal secrets and propose
potential roles for these proteins. Bank voles are a target
species in various ecological studies and our previous
analysis revealed that individuals of both sex contain
candidate proteins of approximately 17-20 kDa in the
urine. However, there is little available information on
the mechanisms that bank voles use to mark their territories, attract individuals of opposite sex and how is this
information transmitted to other individuals. Therefore,
this study employed gene expression and gene characterization techniques to uncover a potential group of
proteins that may play a role in chemical communication in this species.

Results
M. glareolus voles express three novel Obp genes/
transcripts in different secretory tissues

RT-PCR was conducted using mRNA from secretory tissues (prostate, preputial glands, salivary glands, liver).
The samples were derived from wild caught M. glareolus
to ascertain whether M. glareolus express transcripts for
candidate lipocalins that are known to carry volatiles
facilitating chemical communication. Use of a hamster
Aphrodisin specific primer set generated clear bands in
the expected area. M. glareolus amplicons were purified
and cloned with TA TOPO kit and consequently the
total of 28 clones were each forward and reverse
sequenced. This analysis revealed three unique cDNA
amplicons described as Obp1 [GQ219783], Obp2
[GQ219784], and Obp3 [GQ219785] (Figure 1) which
were similar to hamster Aphrodisin (75% identity) and
mouse Obp1a and Obp1b (72% identity) from public
NCBI database. Sequencing further revealed that 20
sequences - identified as Obp1 - were present in individuals of both sex and across all tissues analyzed except
male prostate. Three nucleotide polymorphisms were
revealed in two of the female samples (i.e. liver, parotid
glands) causing 1% difference (i.e. 99% identity) from
Obp1 for which we use the term Obp1b. However, this
could be a result of heterozygous effect. The Obp2 transcripts were detected in male prostate (3 clones, i.e. 6
sequences) whilst Obp3 was detected from a single
clone using cDNA from submandibular glands.

More detailed analysis of translated transcripts
revealed that the novel Obp genes have typical lipocalin
signatures including GxW motif [50], two conservative
cystein residues characteristic for most of the lipocalins,
and extra two cysteins forming the CxxxC motif (see
Figure 1). This motif is a specific feature of hamster
Aphrodisin described as a position of the second disulphide bond in this lipocalin [29]. To add, all mouse
Obps, Rat Obp1f, and other lipocalins compared in Figure 2 share the same feature.
Contrary to hamsters, the expression of novel genes is
not female specific but is present in individuals of both
sex and across different tissues studied. Although, these
novel sequences were highly similar to hamster Aphrodisin (75% identity) we use more general term Obps (i.e.
Obp stands for Odorant Binding Protein) with which
they share 72% identity (Figure 2) because the term
Aphrodisin presupposes its aphrodisiac function which
was not assessed for novel proteins in this study.
2-D electrophoresis and MS analyses confirmed the
presence of detected Obps in the urine and saliva but
not in vaginal flushes

Image analysis of 2D gels of urinary, salivary and vaginal
samples revealed protein spots in the predicted region
of pI (3.9-5.1) and in the MW range of 18-20 kDa. After
tryptic digestion protein spots were subjected to
MALDI-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS analysis. MS/MS data
were primarily searched against to the Obp library containing DNA- derived sequences. Subsequently, the data
were searched against NCBI protein database to avoid
random false positives caused by small size of the Obp
library. MS/MS data of peptides which have not
matched to Obp library in Mascot database search were
manually evaluated. Based on MS/MS data three Obp
proteins were unambiguously identified: Obp2 and two
Obp3 isoforms (Obp3-A and Obp3-B). These proteins
correspond to the most intensive spots in 2D gel of the
salivary sample. Only Obp2 and Obp3-A were identified
in the urinary sample (see Figure 3). The transcript corresponding to Obp1 gene was abundant on the level of
mRNA, however, remained undetected on the level of
protein. Reasons for this failure may involve modifications that changed its pI or that the concentration of
Obp1 protein was low and thus below MS identification
limits. Furthermore, the Obp proteins were present also
in less intense spots but their identification was based
on sequence regions identical for all variants not allowing correct determination of the particular variant and
they are not further discussed in this study. Results of
MS/MS analysis of three main Obp variants in salivary
samples are summarized in Figure 4.
Sequence coverage ranged from 63% (Obp2) to 77%
(Obp3-B) when non-specific trypsin cleavage were taken
in account (enzyme “semiTrypsin”). While detected

parts of Obp2 sequence were completely in agreement
with cDNA-derived sequence, Obp3 protein sequence
showed several differences from cDNA-derived sequence
indicating the presence of two Obp3 variants (see Figure
4). The amino acid changes were tentatively identified
and their confirmation on the mRNA and protein level
is a subject of ongoing projects. Complete results of
Mascot searches against Obp sequences library including amino acid corrections for Obp3 are available in
Additional file 1.

Discussion
Wild caught M. glareolus voles transcribe (and translate)
three novel Obp genes highly similar to those previously
described as hamster Aphrodisin. Exon 2, encoding the
first sheet of beta barrel, includes a specific signature in
amino acid sequence (GxW) that places these novel
genes to a family of proteins called lipocalins. As in
mouse and hamster these Myodes Obp genes also
include specific amino acid feature CxxxC which is
known to form disulphide bond in hamster Aphrodisin.
For its ability to form a pheromone-carrying beta barrel
this protein is important as it may have overtaken the

role of Major Urinary Proteins (Mups) in those species
where Mups are not present or are expressed in low
quantities. This argument is further supported by studies that show Mups being important in individual
recognition and mate choice [17,51]. If lipocalins are
generally important in these processes they must by
substituted by a similar sort of proteins in those species
where the expression of Mups is lost.
M. glareolus Obp (i.e. Obp1, Obp2, Obp3) mRNA
derived nucleotide sequences (cDNA) were aligned
against the corresponding consensus sequences from the
Mus, Rattus, and Cricetus sequences from NCBI library.
The analyses of replicate trees in which the associated
taxa/proteins clustered together revealed that novel
Myodes Obps cluster together with Cricetus Aphrodisin,
thus, forming a parallel cluster to mouse Obp1a, Obp1b
and remaining Mus Obps (bootstrap = 100) previously
described as O4-O8 in Stopková et al. [16]. To add,
both Cricetus Aphrodisin and Myodes Obp form a
group of proteins that, due to a high structural similarity
may also serve similar functions where a capacity to
bind and transport pheromones by Cricetus Aphrodisin
has already been documented [21,52]. Furthermore, the

and described as myo Obp1-3. Mouse Obp sequences are depicted as mus O1-O8 assigned with respective synonyms Obp1a and Obp1b.
Known lipocalin sequences from Cricetus cricetus are Aphrodisin (cri Aphr), Male salivary protein (cri Msp), Female lacrimal protein (cri Flp) and
Probasin (cri Prb). In Rattus norvegicus the only two lipocalins belonging to this cluster are Obp1f (rat Obp1f) and Probasin (rat Prb). The optimal
tree with the sum of branch length = 11.92163796 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together
in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as
those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum
Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data
were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 478 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses and
this caption were conducted in MEGA4 software [57].

method of clustering in Figure 2 shows that the divergence of Obp-like lipocalins caused by gene duplication
preceded a mouse - rat split that occurred 10.3 millions
of years ago as well as muroid and cricetid divergence
that most likely occurred 22.5 millions years ago [53].
This is seen in Prb (Probasin) with a branching pattern
where a mouse - rat split was preceded by a split of the
mouse - rat common ancestor from Cricetid rodents (i.
e. Cricetus, Myodes etc.).
In contrast to mouse Major Urinary Proteins with 21
genes and 21 pseudogenes, Obps in Myodes glareolus
were detected as only three unique transcripts. However,
our 2-DE and consequent MS/MS analyses indicate that
the number of potential protein products depicted in
Figure 3 may be higher and that further analysis is
required to uncover other potential genes and/or allelic
variants. On the level of proteins the number of
detected variants exceeded the number of detected transcripts in case of Obp3 (Figure 4) and several other Obp
proteins were detected in low abundant spots.
To add Myodes glareolus Obp is highly similar to Cricetus and Mesocricetus Aphrodisin, however, their

expression pattern is different. Contrary to hamsters, M.
gareolus Obp was detected in both sexes and in all tested
tissues whilst it was missing in vaginal flushes or its
expression was low. Its absence might have been caused
by the fact that the main site of Obp production in this
area are prepucial glands which secret this protein in to
the vaginal lumen under specific stimuli which our
experimental sample collection method did not satisfy.

Conclusions
Myodes glareolus voles express three novel Aphrodisinlike genes here named as Obp1, Obp2, and Obp3. Proteomic analysis further revealed that there may be
further variants of this genes and that they are secreted
into urine and saliva. The comparative analysis provided
evidence that these transcripts are expressed in all studied tissues and by individuals of both sex. All this evidence - along with the fact that almost identical Obps
in other species have binding affinity to pheromones suggests that these proteins may be used in M. glareolus
for chemical communication similarly as Major Urinary
Proteins in mice.

MS/MS techniques where the presence of Obps was detected in most of them. However, only annotated spots (i.e. Obp2, Obp3-A, Obp3-B)
were reliably assigned to the particular sequences depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 4.

Methods

Protein electrophoresis

Subjects and samples

The Bradford method [54] was used to detect appropriate concentration of proteins for further analysis. The
total of 5 μl (urine), 5 μl (saliva), or 11.25 μl (vaginal
flush) of sample was acetone precipitated. The pellet
was diluted in 10 μl of SDS sample buffer and heated at
70°C for 10 minutes. Separation was performed by
means of denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) using 10% NuPAGE® Novex Bis-Tris Midi
Gels and NuPAGE® MES Running Buffer (Invitrogen
Technologies, Paisley, UK). The gels were stained with
the Colloidal Coomassie® G-250 (SimplyBlue™ Safe Stain,
Invitrogen Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) with images
being acquired by GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer.
Two dimensional polyacrylamide elctrophoresis (2DPAGE) was performed with IEF cell (Bio-rad®) and Protean II electrophoresis system. For the first dimension
12 μg of proteins was applied to Bio-Rad 17 cm strips
(pI: 3.9-5.1). Isoelectric focusing was performed after
passive rehydration at room temperature and run at 50
V 9.5 hrs, 250 V (rapid) for 15 min, 500 V (rapid), 1000
V (rapid) for 15 min, 10000 V (rapid) - 35000 V/hrs,
and finished at 500 V until further step. For the seconddimension separation, the strips were equilibrated for 10
minutes in 45 mM Tris base (pH 7.0) containing 6 M
urea, 1.6% SDS, 30% glycerol, and 130 mM dithiothreitol, and then re-equilibrated for 10 minutes in the same
buffer containing 135 mM iodoacetamide in place of
dithiothreitol. The strips were then placed on Protean II
hand-made 12% gels, and unstained molecular standards
were applied. Second dimension gels were run at constant current - 50 mA for 1 hr, 100 mA for 1 hr and
150 mA for 1.5 hrs at 10°C. After electrophoresis, the
gels were stained with the Colloidal Coomassie® G-250
(SimplyBlue™ Safe Stain, Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Paisley, UK) with images being acquired by GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer. All spots in the range 15-25 kDa
were excised with a Bio-rad Spot Cutter.

The total of twenty individual bank voles (10 males and
10 females, Myodes glareolus) were caught in the Czech
Republic in Cernovice near Tabor, near Prague and near
Prachov City using the Chmela wild traps. All animals
were individually caged with food and water provided
ad libitum. All conditions of the Czech law were met to
diminish animal suffering under captive rearing. Urine
samples were collected in the first half of the 14:10 light
period by spontaneous lavage straight to eppendorf
tubes, whilst salivary and vaginal samples were collected
by gentle flushes with a 10 μl Eppendorf tips and with
the total volume of 50 μl of distilled water.
Analysis of transcripts

At the day of tissue extraction animals were sacrificed
by cervical dislocation and five tissue samples were collected from each animal. Tissue samples were obtained
from prepucial/clitorial glands, prostate, liver, parotid
glands, submandibular glands and whole uterus tract
(without ovaries). Immediately after resection each tissue
sample was placed into eppendorff tube with mixture of
Trizol (TRIzol Reagent - Invitrogen) and glass pellets
and homogenized using mill homogenizator (MM200 Retsch). RNA was isolated using standard Trizol protocol and followed by cDNA synthesis using First strand
cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas).
Various primer sets were tested to amplify the “Aphrodisin” gene, derived from known sequence of hamster Aphrodisin (Mesocricetus auratus, Cricetus
cricetus). Finally we set up one pair of primers giving
one clear band in the expected area. This primer set
covers the whole region from start to stop codon (i.e.
Forward: CAAGTCAGGCACCACCATG and Reverse:
TTTATTCAGGACAAGTATCTG). Using following
conditions for PCR reaction (denaturation 95°C for
30s, annealing 56°C for 30s and extension 75°C for
50s, repeated for 35 cycles) we get in all tissues one
clear band in the expected range of 515 bp checked in
agarose gel. These PCR products from all tissues were
purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).
We have cloned the PCR product of two males and
two females from different tissues separately. Cloning
into pCRII TA vector was made as described by the
manufacturer (TOPO TA Cloning Kit - Dual promoter, Invitrogen). Clones were sequenced (3130 Genetic
Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) using a forward and
reverse M13 primers. Sequences were analyzed using
Sequence Scanner (Applied Biosystem) software and
compared with known sequences from public database
NCBI using BLAST. Novel sequences were deposited
in GeneBank with the accession numbers provided in
the results section.

Mass Spectrometric Analysis

Protein spots selected for analysis were excised from 2DE gels. After destaining, the proteins in gel pieces were
incubated with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) at
37°C for 2 h. Digested peptides were extracted from gels
using 50% ACN solution with 5% formic acid.
MALDI-MS and MS/MS analyses were performed on
an Ultraflex III mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik,
Bremen, Germany). Peptide maps were acquired in
reflectron positive mode (25 kV acceleration voltage)
with 800 laser shots. Peaks within 700 - 4000 Da mass
range and minimum S/N 10 were picked out for MS/
MS analysis employing LID-LIFT arrangement with
600 laser shots for each peptide. CHCA solution prepared according to Havlis [55] was used as the matrix

in combination with AnchorChip target to enhance
measurement sensitivity. Sample (1 μl) was mixed with
matrix solution on the target in a 2:1 ratio. Known
autoproteolytic products of trypsin were used for internal calibration of digested peptides. In the absence of
these products, an external calibration procedure was
employed, using a mixture of seven peptide standards
(Bruker Daltonik) covering the mass range of 10003100 Da. The Flex Analysis 3.0 and MS Biotools 3.1
(Bruker Daltonik) software were used for data
processing.
LC-MS/MS experiments were accomplished on an
HPLC system consisting of a gradient pump (Ultimate),
autosampler (Famos) and column switching device
(Switchos; LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
on-line coupled with an HCTultra PTM Discovery System ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik).
Tryptic digests were concentrated and desalted using
PepMap C18 trapping column (300 μm × 5 mm, LC
Packings). Sample volume was 15 μl. After washing with
0.1% formic acid, the peptides were eluted from the
trapping column using an acetonitrile/water gradient (4
μL/min) onto a fused-silica capillary column (320 μm ×
180 mm), on which peptides were separated. This column was filled with 4-μm Jupiter Proteo sorbent (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) according to a previously
described procedure [56]. The mobile phase A consisted
of acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (5/95 v/v) mixture and
the mobile phase B consisted of acetonitrile/0.1% formic
acid (80/20 v/v) mixture. The gradient elution started at
5% of mobile phase B, and after 4 minutes, it was
increased linearly from 5% to 50% during 55 minutes.
The analytical column outlet was connected to the electrospray ion source via a 50-μm-inner diameter fusedsilica capillary. Nitrogen was used as nebulizing as well
as drying gas. The pressure of nebulizing gas was 15 psi.
The temperature and flow rate of drying gas were set to
300°C and 6 L/min, respectively, and the capillary voltage was 4.0 kV. The mass spectrometer was operated
in the positive ion mode in a m/z range of 300 - 1500
for MS and 100-3000 for MS/MS scans. Extraction of
the mass spectra from the chromatograms, mass annotation and deconvolution of the mass spectra were performed using DataAnalysis 4.0 software (Bruker
Daltonik).
Data Processing

MASCOT 2.2 (MatrixScience, London, UK) search
engine was used for processing the MS and MS/MS
data. Database searches were done against the NCBI
protein database (Release 20090210) as well as against
translated sequence data obtained by TOPO cloning
experiment. A mass tolerance of 60 ppm was allowed
during processing MALDI MS data for PMF and 0.7 Da

Page 8 of 10

during processing LID-LIFT data for MS/MS ion
searches. For ESI-MS/MS data, mass tolerances of peptides and MS/MS fragments for MS/MS ion searches
were 0.5 Da. All searches were done without taxonomic
restriction. Both trypsin and semitrypsin as an enzyme
were selected for each sample. Oxidation (M), carbamidomethylation (C), deamidation (N, Q) and pyro-Glu
(Q, N-term) as optional modifications and up to three
enzyme miscleavages were set for all searches. Unassigned MS/MS spectra were subjected to manual interpretation to elucidate peptide primary structure and its
changes from given sequence data.
