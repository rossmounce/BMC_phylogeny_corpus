Abstract
Background: Rates of synonymous nucleotide substitutions are, in general, exceptionally low in
plant mitochondrial genomes, several times lower than in chloroplast genomes, 10–20 times lower
than in plant nuclear genomes, and 50–100 times lower than in many animal mitochondrial
genomes. Several cases of moderate variation in mitochondrial substitution rates have been
reported in plants, but these mostly involve correlated changes in chloroplast and/or nuclear
substitution rates and are therefore thought to reflect whole-organism forces rather than ones
impinging directly on the mitochondrial mutation rate. Only a single case of extensive,
mitochondrial-specific rate changes has been described, in the angiosperm genus Plantago.
Results: We explored a second potential case of highly accelerated mitochondrial sequence
evolution in plants. This case was first suggested by relatively poor hybridization of mitochondrial
gene probes to DNA of Pelargonium hortorum (the common geranium). We found that all eight
mitochondrial genes sequenced from P. hortorum are exceptionally divergent, whereas chloroplast
and nuclear divergence is unexceptional in P. hortorum. Two mitochondrial genes were sequenced
from a broad range of taxa of variable relatedness to P. hortorum, and absolute rates of
mitochondrial synonymous substitutions were calculated on each branch of a phylogenetic tree of
these taxa. We infer one major, ~10-fold increase in the mitochondrial synonymous substitution
rate at the base of the Pelargonium family Geraniaceae, and a subsequent ~10-fold rate increase
early in the evolution of Pelargonium. We also infer several moderate to major rate decreases
following these initial rate increases, such that the mitochondrial substitution rate has returned to
normally low levels in many members of the Geraniaceae. Finally, we find unusually little RNA
editing of Geraniaceae mitochondrial genes, suggesting high levels of retroprocessing in their
history.

Conclusion: The existence of major, mitochondrial-specific changes in rates of synonymous
substitutions in the Geraniaceae implies major and reversible underlying changes in the
mitochondrial mutation rate in this family. Together with the recent report of a similar pattern of
rate heterogeneity in Plantago, these findings indicate that the mitochondrial mutation rate is a
more plastic character in plants than previously realized. Many molecular factors could be
responsible for these dramatic changes in the mitochondrial mutation rate, including nuclear gene
mutations affecting the fidelity and efficacy of mitochondrial DNA replication and/or repair and –
consistent with the lack of RNA editing – exceptionally high levels of "mutagenic" retroprocessing.
That the mitochondrial mutation rate has returned to normally low levels in many Geraniaceae
raises the possibility that, akin to the ephemerality of mutator strains in bacteria, selection favors
a low mutation rate in plant mitochondria.

Background
For almost 20 years, it has been widely appreciated that
nucleotide substitution rates are unusually low in mitochondrial genomes of land plants. This conclusion was
first reached by Wolfe et al. [1] from an examination of
synonymous substitution rates for several mitochondrial
genes among a small set of angiosperms. Wolfe et al. [1]
estimated that synonymous substitution rates in plant
mitochondrial genomes are several times lower than in
chloroplast genomes, 10–20 times lower than in plant
nuclear genomes, and 50–100 times lower than in mammalian mitochondrial genomes. Palmer and Herbon [2]
quickly extended this inference to the entire mitochondrial genome (most of which is noncoding) through
genome-wide comparative restriction site mapping
among crucifers and also showed that whereas sequence
evolution is abnormally slow in plant mitochondrial
genome, structural evolution is quite rapid.
Subsequent studies have extended this picture of unusually low mitochondrial substitution rates to other groups
of land plants [reviewed in 3–5]. Within this context of
generally slow evolution, a few studies have reported
moderate variation in mitochondrial synonymous substitution rates between different groups of plants [6-9]. In
most of these cases, correlated rate changes have been
noted for chloroplast and/or nuclear genes. For example,
all three genomes of grasses exhibit several-fold higher
synonymous rates than do palms [6]. These findings suggest the operation of forces, such as generation time
effects [6-8], paternal transmission of organelles [9], or
correlated substitution and speciation rates [10,11], acting on all three genomes or on both organellar genomes.
Beginning in the late 1990's, we have carried out a largescale Southern hybridization survey in which numerous
mitochondrial and chloroplast gene and intron probes
were hybridized to filter blots containing total DNAs from
280 diverse angiosperms [12-16]. With the exception of
two plants, most if not all of the mitochondrial gene
probes hybridized well to all 280 plant DNAs. For these

two plants, all mitochondrial probes hybridized poorly if
at all, despite typically strong hybridization with chloroplast probes. This very reduced mitochondrial hybridization (relative to chloroplast hybridization) suggested
either 1) greatly reduced mitochondrial genome copy
number in one or both plants, 2) highly elevated mitochondrial sequence divergence, or 3) loss from the mitochondrial genome and transfer of these genes to the low
copy number and high mutation rate environment of the
nucleus. A preliminary report [15] provided evidence of
exceptional divergence for two, normally mitochondrially-located genes for each of these two plants, Plantago
rugelii (plantain) and Pelargonium hortorum (the common
geranium).
In a recent study [17], we explored the Plantago case in
some detail, showing that it represents the first example of
extremely rapid sequence evolution of mitochondrial
DNA in plants. This rapid evolution was confined to the
mitochondrial genome and to Plantago, for which major
increases and decreases were found in the mitochondrial
synonymous rate and, underlying this, the mitochondrial
mutation rate. The fastest evolution in Plantago was estimated to exceed even the fastest evolution in animal mitochondria by an order of magnitude. Coupled with the
discovery of other angiosperms with exceptionally slow
evolution (even for plants), synonymous substitution
rates in angiosperm mitochondrial genomes were estimated to vary by a factor of some 4,000-fold [17].
Here we explore the Pelargonium situation and report a
second, entirely independent case of exceptionally rapid
and variable sequence evolution in plant mitochondria,
involving the Geraniaceae and especially Pelargonium. The
Geraniaceae and Plantago cases are similar in overall
aspect, involving initial, stepwise major increases in the
rate of mitochondrial synonymous substitutions, followed by major rate decreases in certain descendant lineages. There are, however, differences between the two
cases, including striking evidence from the Geraniaceae

frames. 5) In comparisons with homologs from other

low ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, indicating that they are functional and evolving

that high mitochondrial mutation rates may be deleterious in plants, at least in the long run.

Results
We used PCR to isolate nearly full-length segments of
seven mitochondrial genes from Pelargonium hortorum
and three genes from P. reniforme. All seven P. hortorum
mitochondrial genes show exceptional divergence relative
to other angiosperms. This finding suggests that exceptionally rapid mitochondrial evolution – rather than
reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number or mitochondrial gene loss/nuclear transfer – is the explanation for the
very poor hybridization of heterologous mitochondrial
gene probes to P. hortorum total DNA in the survey blots
described in Background. Several other lines of evidence
support the conclusion that these genes are located in the
mitochondrial genome and are functional: 1) Two of the
seven genes were tested by Southern blots and shown to
hybridize preferentially to purified mitochondrial DNA
compared to total DNA from P. hortorum (data not
shown). 2) Both genes tested by Northern blots hybridized preferentially to poly (A)- RNA compared to poly
(A)+ RNA (data not shown), and all three genes examined
for RNA editing are transcribed. 3) Four of the seven genes
are invariantly mitochondrially-located in all examined
eukaryotes (except in those rare organisms where the gene

Because a disproportionate amount of the enhanced
divergence of the protein genes was at synonymous sites,
we chose to present their divergence graphically in the
form of phylogenetic trees constructed from synonymous
sites only (Fig. 1). The level of divergence in P. hortorum is
generally comparable, at both synonymous sites and all
sites for ribosomal RNA genes, to divergences of Plantago
rugelii (Fig. 1), which has one of the most divergent mitochondrial genomes in Plantago [17] (P. media is the most
divergent Plantago). For the three genes available, Pelargonium reniforme is also quite divergent but consistently less
so than P. hortorum (Fig. 1). For the eighth mitochondrial
gene shown in Fig. 1, nad1, only a relatively short
sequence was available, and this only from different species of Pelargonium [18]. To illustrate synonymous site
divergence for this gene, we chose P. tongaense and P. cotyledonis, as these are close relatives of P. hortorum and P.
reniforme, respectively. The less exceptional apparent
divergence of nad1 for these two taxa (Fig. 1) is probably
a function of the very short region analyzed (198 NT in
total, and only about 50 synonymous sites) rather than
gene-specific differences in substitution rates. Phylogenetic analysis of synonymous sites for five chloroplast and
three nuclear genes shows, unlike the mitochondrial situation, no evidence of exceptional divergence in P. hortorum (Fig. 1).
An expanded data set (Fig. 2) was generated for two mitochondrial genes, cox1 and small subunit ribosomal DNA
(SSU rDNA), in order to explore the extent and pattern of
mitochondrial rate heterogeneity within Pelargonium and
other genera in the Geraniaceae, and to allow comparison
with rate variation in other rosids and across eudicots,
including the previously described case of rapid mitochondrial evolution in Plantago [17]. Seven species of Pelargonium were examined, as were eight other Geraniaceae
species representing the five other genera in the family.
The fifteen Geraniaceae taxa all show enhanced divergence at cox1 synonymous sites compared to all other rosids examined, but to markedly different extents, falling
into three divergence groups (Fig. 2). The five non-Pelargonium genera are divergent compared to other rosids,
members of Pelargonium subgenus Pelargonium (comprising P. cotyledonis through P. capitatum) are much more
divergent, and those of the other subgenus, Ciconium
(comprising P. hortorum through P. candicans), are even

more divergent. The mitochondrial SSU rDNA gene shows
much the same pattern, which is striking considering that
all sites are included for this gene compared to only synonymous sites for cox1. The magnitude and overall aspect
of enhanced mitochondrial sequence divergence in Geraniaceae – different levels of divergence according to taxonomic group within the family – mirrors the pattern seen
within Plantago (Fig. 2) [17]. Consistent with the results
shown in Fig. 1 for Pelargonium hortorum, levels of chloroplast synonymous site divergence and nuclear SSU rDNA
divergence are unexceptional in Geraniaceae (except for
somewhat enhanced rbcL divergence in Erodium).
To put the synonymous site divergence data on a quantitative footing, we calculated absolute rates of cox1 synonymous substitutions along all branches in the rosid part of
the cox1 trees shown in Fig. 2. Absolute rates were calculated for each branch by dividing its synonymous branch
length by the estimated divergence time of the branch.
Divergence times within rosids were calculated using the
4-gene (three chloroplast and one nuclear), 6,226 NT
character set used to estimate rosid phylogeny in Fig. 3.
Support for the relationships in this phylogenetic tree is
mixed at basal nodes within rosids. Critically, though,
support is strong at the node leading to Geraniaceae and
throughout the family (96–100% bootstrap support at 13
of 14 nodes; Fig. 3).
A chronogram (time-based tree) of rosids is shown in Fig.
4, with RS, the absolute rate of cox1 synonymous substitutions, marked on each branch in units of substitutions per
site per billion years (SSB units). The dearth of inferred
synonymous site changes on the relatively short branches
at the base of rosids is reflected in the RS = 0 estimates on
most of these branches. RS is comparably low (0.31 SSB)
on the H-L branch leading to the common ancestor of
Geraniaceae and Crossosoma as throughout the rest of the
non-zero rosid branches (RS = 0.14–0.74 SSB). On the
next four branches leading from the H-L branch towards
the "top" of tree, RS becomes progressively higher, from
0.3→2.4→4.1→30→38 SSB, before diminishing on subsequent branches. There is no reason to think that rate
changes should coincide in timing with cladogenetic
events. Given this, and wishing to minimize the number
of inferred rate changes, we can very provisionally model
these branch-wise rate increases with a minimum of two
actual rate changes: an ~10-fold increase in RS (from 0.3 to
4 SSB) in the common ancestor of the Geraniaceae (L-M
branch) and a further ~10-fold increase (from 4 to 38) in
the common ancestor of Pelargonium (N-U; Fig. 4). Thus,
we provisionally infer at least (see Discussion) a 100-fold
overall increase in RS from near the base of rosids to the
period of putatively fastest evolution in Pelargonium.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/73

The terminal branches leading to all examined species of
Pelargonium have estimated RS values considerably below
the genus' peak inferred value of 38 SSB. Likewise, the terminals leading to all non-Pelargonium Geraniaceae have
RS values considerably lower than 4 SSB. In fact all of this
latter set of terminals have values comparable to the
inferred ancestral rosid value of roughly 0.3 SSB, as do
even some of the Pelargonium terminals (Fig. 4). Thus,
there must have been multiple decreases in the synonymous substitution rate, some of considerable magnitude,
following its early increases. We are confident of at least
three rate decreases in the Geraniaceae: one each in the
two subgenera of Pelargonium and one in the common
ancestor of the clade comprising Erodium through Sarcocaulon. Furthermore, Fig. 4 raises the possibility of additional rate decreases, e.g, in P. hortorum, in Erodium, and in
Hypseocharis.
The large standard errors on many of the RS values within
the family (Fig. 4) pose a particular problem in formulating rate-change scenarios with any certainty. But what is
clear is that there have been multiple increases and
decreases in the rate of mitochondrial synonymous substitutions within the Geraniaceae, and that the overall
magnitude of these changes has been quite large.
Divergence at nonsynonymous sites in cox1 was also analyzed phylogenetically and is plotted both at the same
scale as synonymous site divergence (Fig 2, middle top)
and at a five-fold expanded scale (Fig. 2, middle bottom).
Although replacement sites also show enhanced divergence in Pelargonium and other Geraniaceae relative to
other rosids, the effect is considerably muted compared to
the pattern of synonymous site divergence. Absolute rates
of nonsynonymous substitutions (RN) were calculated
within the rosids and are given in Additional File 1, as are
RN/RS values. Among the very lowest RN/RS values are
those on the branches with the highest RS values (RN/RS =
0.02 for the N-U branch of RS = 30, and RN/RS = 0.03 for
the U-X branch of RS = 38).
One notable feature of the very rapidly evolving mitochondrial DNAs of mammals is a pronounced (ca. 20fold) transition/transversion (ti/tv) bias in favor of transitions [19]. The most divergent Geraniaceae cox1 genes, in
Pelargonium, show only a modest increase in ti/tv (= 1.91
averaged across all within-Pelargonium comparisons) relative to all non-Geraniaceae (ti/tv = 0.82). Base composition and the overall mutational spectrum are not
significantly different in Pelargonium than in other plant
lineages (data not shown).
Although only limited data are available, there seems to
be relatively little RNA editing of mitochondrial genes in
the Geraniaceae (Table 1). We directly assessed RNA edit-

ing, by cDNA sequencing, for three mitochondrial genes
in P. hortorum. Only a single, C→U edit site was found
among the three genes, and very few edits were predicted
(Table 1) for the various other sequenced Geraniaceae
mitochondrial genes using a sensitive program [20] for
predicting C→U editing of angiosperm mitochondrial
genes. In comparison, other rosids (Crossoma through
Pisum in Table 1), as well as the caryophyllid Beta and the
grasses Oryza and Triticum, generally have much more
RNA editing of these same five protein genes, with many
edit sites conserved among angiosperms.

Discussion
Tempo and pattern of rate variation
We have discovered dramatic variation in rates of mitochondrial synonymous substitutions within the
angiosperm family Geraniaceae. Our principal findings
are three-fold: 1) The synonymous rate increased hugely
during the evolution of the Geraniaceae, by at least a factor of 100. 2) This overall rate increase occurred via multiple (at least two, possibly more) stepwise and
temporally separated rate increases. 3) Following these
rate increases, at least three, and quite possibly more, rate
decreases occurred, with many lineages reverting to the
very low synonymous rates typical of most angiosperms.

Numbers in bold indicate that editing sites were identified experimentally. All other reported numbers were predicted with PREP-Mt [20] using a
cutoff value of 0.5.

Our estimates for the highest and lowest rates of synonymous substitutions, and of the number of rate changes,
are inherently conservative ones, being constrained by the
limited taxonomic sampling of this study. The RS values
by definition average the substitution rate across an entire
branch, the length/time of that branch being a function of
the number of extant Geraniaceae taxa and our sampling
of those taxa. Any one RS value may in fact average across
periods of substantially higher and lower absolute substitution rate than would be indicated by the RS value itself.
For example, the highest branch-wise (RS) rate estimated
in this study, of 38 SSB, may turn out to be a significant
underestimate of the fastest period of mitochondrial evolution within Pelargonium. We sampled only 7 of ~280
species in the genus, and thus there is ample opportunity
to more finely dissect the pattern of rate variation and
thereby discover greater peaks (and valleys) of substitution rates, as well as detect a larger number of rate
changes.
If synonymous rates are more or less equal across genes
within a mitochondrial genome (as seems to be the case
for P. hortorum; Fig. 1), then sampling multiple protein
genes (and among many taxa) should provide another
opportunity to better elucidate the tempo and pattern of
rate changes. In particular, this should significantly reduce
the standard errors on the estimates of RS, many of which
are quite high for cox1 alone (Fig. 4 and Additional File 1).
Sequencing additional non-mitochondrial genes, to
reduce the standard errors on the divergence time esti-

mates (see Additional File 1), should also be helpful in
this regard.
The mitochondrial rate variation in Geraniaceae uncovered in this study is similar in several respects to that
recently described in Plantago [17]. In both cases, 1) there
is dramatic variation in synonymous substitution rates; 2)
taxa fall into multiple (three or four) groups with respect
to the amount of accumulated sequence divergence (Fig.
2); 3) the most divergent groups have accumulated comparable levels of synonymous site divergence (Fig. 2); 4)
at least two successive major increases in the synonymous
rate occurred relatively early on; 5) multiple rate decreases
occurred subsequent to the initial increases; and 6) rates
of chloroplast and nuclear evolution are not elevated,
such that in the fastest lineages mitochondrial rates significantly exceed those of the chloroplast and nuclear
genomes (Fig. 2; ref. [17]).
The Geraniaceae and Plantago situations also differ in several ways: 1) The Geraniaceae situation encompasses a
broader group taxonomically. 2) The initial speed-up
occurred much earlier in the Geraniaceae (ca. 80 Myr)
than in Plantago (ca. 30 Myr). 3) The peak rates estimated
in Plantago (ca. 200 SSB and possibly even 700 SSB) far
exceed those in Geraniaceae (38 SSB), although this difference could in large part be a sampling artifact (i.e., if
the fastest period of mitochondrial evolution extended
throughout a single sampled branch in Plantago, whereas
that in Pelargonium was averaged, on the fastest measured
branch, with periods of significantly slower evolution). 4)

There seems to be less of a tendancy to revert to a typically
low substitution rate (of ca. 0.5 SSB) in Plantago compared
to Geraniaceae. Overall, then, the Plantago speed-up is
more recent, apparently more intense, and apparently less
reverted. Like Pelargonium, Plantago is a large genus (in fact
the two are almost exactly the same size), and it will be
interesting to see how the two situations compare once
more taxa and genes (and even some complete genomes)
are sampled from both groups.
Geraniaceae and Plantago are, to our knowledge, the only
two cases of such dramatic variation in synonymous substitution rates – both in magnitude and rollercoaster-like
behavior – documented in any group of plant mitochondrial genomes, or, for that matter, in any genome/group
whatsoever. However, several published, mostly phylogenetic studies have identified other plants for which mitochondrial divergence is disproportionately high
compared to chloroplast divergence. These long-branched
mitochondrial clades include Ephedra in the Gnetales [2123], the monocots Acorus and Alismatales [24], the lycophyte Selaginella [25], the asterids Goodenia and Polemonium [17,26], and the simple thalloid and leafy
liverworts [27]. With the exception of Goodenia [17],
none of these cases has been quantitatively treated, and
the published trees include all sites rather than just synonymous sites. Nonetheless, in each case, the accumulated
divergence appears to be lower than in Pelargonium or
Plantago. However, in most of these cases, only one or two
species were examined, and thus there is plenty of opportunity to find even more divergent lineages in these
groups that may approach or even exceed Pelargonium and
Plantago in amount of divergence and peak substitution
rate.
Mutation rates, mechanisms, and selection
Because the extensive variation in substitution rates in the
Geraniaceae is restricted to the mitochondrial genome
and because nonsynonymous rates are proportionately
less elevated than synonymous rates (Fig. 2, Additional
File 1), the root cause of this rate variation is almost certainly changes in the mitochondrial mutation rate. The
same conclusion was reached for Plantago mitochondrial
rate variation [17], whereas most other cases of (much
more modest) synonymous site variation in plant mitochondrial DNA have been ascribed to factors that would
affect all three plant genomes, such as generation time,
population size, and/or speciation rate [6-8].

By analogy to the extensive literature on mutators (and
antimutators) in bacteria and yeast, mutations affecting a
broad range of processes that impinge on the mutation
rate could be responsible for the extensive variation in
mitochondrial mutation rates in Geraniaceae. The only
mitochondrial mutators characterized thus far, in lab

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/73

mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, affect DNA
replication and mismatch repair [28]. These are also the
most common mutators in microorganisms [29,30]. In
plants and virtually all other mitochondrial systems, these
processes are controlled entirely by nuclear genes. Thus,
the major increases in the mitochondrial mutation rate
that took place early in the evolution of the Geraniaceae
and then Pelargonium could be the consequence of nuclear
mutations resulting in error-prone replication or defective
mismatch repair, as postulated for other cases of synonymous rate variation in plant organelle genomes [7,17,31].
Subsequent rate decreases could reflect direct reversal or
compensatory suppression of these mutator mutations.
Mitochondrial-specific forces could also be at work, e.g.,
major increases in the amount of oxygen free-radical damage to mitochondrial DNA [32,33].
That Geranicaeae mitochondrial genes seem, based on
limited samping (Table 1), to be relatively bereft of RNA
editing, raises the possibility of a novel molecular mechanism, which we term "mutagenic retroprocessing" (see
also [34]). Reverse transcriptases are extremely errorprone polymerases, and so exceptionally high levels of
reverse transcription in Geraniaceae mitochondria, coupled with high levels of homologous recombination,
could in principle be responsible for at least part of the
elevation in mitochondrial mutation rate seen in the family. If this hypothesis is correct, we would expect nontranscribed regions to be much less divergent than genes.
Unfortunately, identifying and amplifying homologous
intergenic spacer DNA is not straightforward given the
high rate of rearrangement in plant mitochondrial
genomes [2], and our attempts to do so in Pelargonium
have been unsuccessful. According to this hypothesis, the
existence of limited RNA editing in extant Geraniaceae
(Table 1) would reflect mutational drift to unedited C residues following the evident reversals in mutation rate, i.e,
cessation of the hypothetical mutagenic retroprocessing
activity.
In all 15 examined Geraniaceae, the mitochondrial mutation rate has dropped from its peak levels, with at least
three (and probably more) separate rate decreases implied
by the RS patterns of Fig. 4. In many taxa, the mutation
rate appears to have dropped more or less to the low rates
(ca. 0.3 SSB) typical of most rosid lineages (Fig. 4). And
even those taxa (four species of Pelargonium) whose terminal branches possess relatively high RS values may nonetheless have more fully reverted mutation rates, the
present-day rates being averaged with potentially higher
rates earlier on these branches.
Such a pervasive local pattern of rate decreases, combined
with pervasively slow mitochondrial evolution across
land plants in general, suggests that high mutation rates

Page 9 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:73

are selected against in the evolution of plant mitochondrial genomes. Chance mutations that directly reverse or
otherwise suppress the earlier mutator-like mutations in
Geraniaceae may be favored and fixed by natural selection. From this perspective, plant mitochondrial mutators
may be viewed as ephemeral, like bacterial mutators but
on a much longer time scale.
If most or all Geraniacease have reverted to low mitochondrial mutation rates, then it may be difficult if not impossible to figure out the nature of the mutator mutations
that caused the rapid periods of mitochondrial evolution.
Mutagenic retroprocessing, admittedly a long-shot
hypothesis, is nonetheless attractive in this regard because
it would leave obvious signatures in the genome (see
above).

Methods
Molecular techniques and sources of DNA sequences
Methods for plant DNA isolation, Southern and Northern
blot hybridization, PCR isolation, DNA cloning, cDNA
preparation, and DNA sequencing are as in [12,13,35].
Additional sequences used in this study were taken from
GenBank and are listed in Additional File 2, as are GenBank numbers for the sequences generated in this study.
PCR primer sequences and aligned data sets are available
upon request.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic relationships within the rosids were determined from a concatenated data set consisting of nuclear
SSU rDNA and the chloroplast genes atpB, matK, and rbcL.
Total aligned length was 6,226 NT. Poorly alignable
regions and regions with gaps in most taxa were excluded
from the analyses. A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was
constructed with PAUP*, version 4.0b10 [36], by using
the general time-reversible model, a gamma distribution
with four rate categories, and an estimate of the proportion of invariant sites. The rate matrix, base frequencies,
shape of the gamma distribution, and proportion of
invariant sites were estimated before the ML analysis from
a parsimony tree constructed from the data. Support for
the ML tree was evaluated by the bootstrap procedure with
500 replicates using parameters estimated from the ML
tree.
Divergence time estimates
Divergence times for all nodes within rosids were calculated using a penalized likelihood approach as implemented in the r8s program [37]. A fixed time constraint of
110 million years [38,39] was used for the crown group
age of rosids. The ML tree from the phylogenetic analysis
of rosids (Fig. 3) was used as the starting tree. A smoothing factor of 18 was determined by using the r8s cross-validation procedure [37]. Different starting points of initial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/73

age estimates and reanalysis after perturbation of the final
age estimates had no effect on the results. Standard errors
for the divergence time of each node were calculated by
rerunning the divergence time analyses on 500 bootstrapped data sets.
The elapsed time along each branch, Tij, was calculated as
the difference in divergence times of the starting node, Ti,
and the ending node, Tj, that define the branch. Standard
errors for Tij were calculated according to the formula

σ Tij = (σ Ti )2 + (σ Tj )2
Branch length estimates
Branch lengths, representing the number of substitutions
per synonymous site (dS) or number of substitutions per
nonsynonymous site (dN), were determined for protein
genes using codeml in the PAML package, version 3.14
[40]. The Muse-Gaut (MG94) codon model was used with
separate dN/dS ratios for each branch. Codon frequencies
were computed by using the F3 × 4 method. The transition/transversion rate ratio and dN/dS ratios were estimated during the analysis with initial values of 2 and 0.4,
respectively. Standard errors for total branch lengths (t)
were reported by PAML, and these values were propagated
to calculate standard errors for their corresponding dS and
dN branch lengths according to the formulas

σ dN =

σ dS =

(N + S)σ t
S
N+
ω
(N + S)σ t
Nω + S

where ω is the dN/dS ratio and N and S are the number of
nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, respectively, as
reported by PAML. Branch lengths representing total substitutions per site for rRNA genes were estimated with
baseml in PAML. The general time-reversible nucleotide
model was used with a gamma distribution for rate variation with four categories. The rate matrix, nucleotide frequencies, and shape of the gamma parameter (initial
value of 0.5) were estimated during the analysis.
All branch length analyses employed user-defined topologies. Within rosids, topologies were constrained according
to the phylogenetic analysis carried out in this study (Fig.
3). Relationships in the Plantaginaceae were constrained
according to [17]. All other relationships were constrained
according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website [41].
Absolute substitution rate estimates
Absolute rates of synonymous substitution per branch
(RS) were calculated by dividing the synonymous branch

length, dS, by the length of time, T, for that branch. Standard errors for RS were determined by propagating the
errors associated with branch length and time according
to the formula
