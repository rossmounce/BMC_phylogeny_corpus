Abstract
Background: The Apicomplexa are a diverse group of obligate protozoan parasites infesting a
wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate hosts including humans. These parasites are notoriously
difficult to control and many species continue to evolve resistance to commercial antibiotics. In this
study, we sought to find an effective chemotherapeutic treatment against arthropod gregarines
(Apicomplexa), and to identify candidate compounds for testing against other groups of protozoan
parasites.
Methods: We tested eleven commercial antibiotics against a gregarine parasite of Romalea
microptera grasshoppers. Infected insects were fed daily, lettuce containing known amounts of
specific antibiotics. On Days 15 or 20, we measured the number of gregarines remaining in the
digestive tract of each grasshopper.
Results: Treatment with metronidazole and griseofulvin in host insects significantly reduced
gregarine counts, whereas, gregarine counts of insects fed, albendazole, ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, fumagillin, quinine, streptomycin, sulfadimethoxine, thiabendazole or tetracycline,
were not significantly different from the controls. However, albendazole produced a strong, but
non-significant reduction in gregarine count, and streptomycin exhibited a non-significant
antagonistic trend.
Conclusion: Our results confirm that gregarine infections are difficult to control and suggest the
possibility that streptomycin might aggravate gregarine infection. In addition, the insect system
described here, provides a simple, inexpensive, and effective method for screening antibiotics.

Background
The phylum Apicomplexa consists of unicellular protozoan parasites, infesting a wide range of Metazoa [1,2].
Included are numerous genera that attack humans or
domesticated animals (e.g., Plasmodium, Toxoplasma,
Cryptosporidium, Neospora, Theileria, Babesia, and Eimeria)
[3,4]. In aggregate, these parasites cause great suffering

and economic damage, and contribute to millions of
human deaths each year [5]. Chemotherapeutic control
ranges from non-existent to fairly effective; however,
many species of Apicomplexa continue to evolve resistance to commercial antibiotics. For example, although
most Plasmodium infections can still be cured by appropriate antimalarial drugs if treatment is administered early

enough, resistance is increasing rapidly to essentially all
compounds in use [5]. Clearly there is an urgent need to
develop novel chemotherapeutic approaches against
these diseases.

sometimes laborious and ineffective [24,29]. The main
problem with sterilization of host eggs and subsequent
rearing is that it takes too long, especially for hosts that
undergo only a single generation per year. Hence, there is
a need to rapidly eliminate gregarines from hosts. Controlling other Apicomplexa is important as well. We are
seeing increased levels of Apicomplexa infection in
immune-repressed, HIV-infected patients, in part because
of the evolution of drug resistance [5]. Numerous other
human apicomplexan diseases like cryptosporidiosis are
likewise difficult to treat [5,42]. Thus, there is a need to
identify new antimicrobials for use against this group.

Gregarines (Apicomplexa of the subclass Gregarinia
Dufour, 1828) are perhaps the most ubiquitous and taxonomically diverse of all parasites, infecting a wide range of
invertebrate hosts, including arthropod vectors of vertebrate diseases [1,6-11]. Gregarines are considered to represent an early diverging apicomplexan lineage, thus
making them a key group for questions regarding apicomplexan evolution [12]. Phylogenetic analysis of the small
subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene suggest that
the gregarines are a sister group to the Cryptosporidium, a
group parasitic on vertebrates [13-15]. Moreover, gregarines and Cryptosporidium share many life cycle features
[16,17], and both groups lack a plastid genome, which is
present in other apicomplexans [12,18]. Gregarines do
not appear to directly impact human health. However,
one gregarine species influences a human disease; the gregarine parasite Ascogregarina culicis apparently helps to
maintain Chikungunya virus in vector mosquitoes [19],
thereby fostering febrile epidemics in Southeast Asia and
Africa [20-22], and recently spreading over Europe [2325].
Although gregarines do not attack vertebrates, they have
harmed, and continue to harm, scientific research, including research on arthropod vectors of human and animal
diseases. This is because gregarines are extremely common
in both field and laboratory arthropods [11,26,27] yet few
researchers are aware of their presence or how these parasites may influence their experiments [10,28-30]. Gregarines are often considered to be sub-lethal or even
harmless to their hosts, but in fact, they divert host nutrients to their own use, occupy space, alter host immune
systems, and damage host cell walls when emerging, and
thus foster microbial attack. As such, they can reduce longevity, vitality, or fecundity, or cause rapid mortality
[27,31-38]. The effects of gregarines are seldom examined
by researchers who study arthropod vectors of vertebrate
diseases. Yet recent studies demonstrate that gregarine
infection significantly increases the effectiveness of both
chemical and microbial control measures against insect
pest [28]. Hence, controlling an arthropod vector may
hinge on the presence of gregarines.
Knowing the effects of gregarine parasites on their hosts
requires a comparison of gregarine-infested and gregarine-free hosts. However, there are few effective antibiotic treatments to eliminate gregarines; typically, parasite
numbers can be reduced, but seldom completely eliminated [39-41]. Sanitation and sterilization are commonly
employed to combat gregarines, but these methods are

In this paper, we test 11 different commercial antibiotics
for control of a gregarine (Gregarina sp.) in an insect, the
Eastern Lubber Grasshopper, Romalea microptera (Beauvois). Our primary goal is to find an effective chemotherapeutic treatment against arthropod gregarines, and
identify candidate compounds for testing against other
related groups of apicomplexan parasites. Our secondary
goal is to develop an inexpensive and effective insectbased system for rapidly testing large numbers of antibiotics in vivo.

Methods
Insect host
All experiments were conducted on Eastern Lubber grasshoppers, Romalea microptera obtained from stock colonies
at Illinois State University [43]. The colony was established in 1997 from wild animals collected from Copeland, Florida, USA. A survey of the colony in 2003
indicated ~96% prevalence of gregarine infection. The origin of this infection is unknown.
Gregarine parasite
We used an unknown species of Gregarina. Placement into
this genus was based on trophozoite with papillae shaped
epimerite, early association, and gametocysts dehiscing
through multiple sporoduct (Fig. 1A-D) [1,11] (Johny
and Whitman, unpubl.). The natural occurrence and host
range of this specific parasite is unknown. Indeed, probably more than 95% of the world's gregarine fauna awaits
identification [11]. Gregarine gametocysts were collected
from the faeces of captive male and female grasshoppers,
washed with sterile distilled water 3–5 times, and incubated in air at 30°C under 90% RH [44], until dehiscence
occurred. The resulting oocyst coils were disrupted by centrifugation in sterile distilled water at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes, resuspended, and then fed to grasshoppers. The
oocyst concentration was determined using a haemocytometer, as per Undeen and Vavra [45].
Compounds tested
We tested the following 11 commercially available products: albendazole, powder, 100% methyl 5-(propylthio)-

Preparation of test compounds
We prepared oral doses of the various antibiotics by mixing them with juice from fresh carrot (Daucus carota)
leaves. Carrot leaf juice is a strong phagostimulant for R.
microptera. Juice was prepared without adding water, using
a commercial juicer, and then filtered through cheesecloth. The water-soluble drugs were directly mixed with
the filtrate. The hydrophobic drugs (albendazole, griseofulvin, metronidazole, and quinine) were first mixed with
dry powdered sucrose, then blended into the pure juice, to
produce suspensions. We then applied 20 µl of juice, containing a known concentration of drug onto 2 cm2 pieces
of fresh Romaine lettuce leaves, spreading the juice evenly
over the surface. We allowed the juice to dry at air temperature (~10 min) and then fed one leaf to each grasshopper. All test compound mixtures were prepared
immediately prior to feeding.

Treatment procedure
Ten male Romalea microptera (5- to 40-day-old adults)
were tested with each drug. Grasshoppers were numbered
individually with permanent markers and placed into
individual, ventilated, 500-ml transparent plastic containers. Each day, for the next 19 days, each grasshopper was
starved for12 hr, then fed a 2 cm2 piece of Romaine lettuce
smeared with 20 µl of juice + antibiotic. Insects were
allowed to feed on the treated lettuce for 4 hr, and the
amount of chemical ingested was calculated based on the
amount of lettuce eaten by the insect. Note that not all
insects consumed a full dose of antibiotic each day; hence,
the dose consumed differs from the dose offered (Table
1). A control group of 40 insects received lettuce with pure
carrot juice. After each day's antibiotic feeding, grasshoppers were fed ad lib Romaine lettuce and oatmeal for 8 hr,
followed by the next 12 hr starvation period. Insects were
maintained at 26 ± 2°C; 60–85% RH, and 14:10 (L:D)
photoperiod. On Day 10, the control and treatment
groups were inoculated with ~3000 gregarine oocysts/
grasshopper by feeding each 1 cm2 of Romaine lettuce
contaminated with oocysts (collected as previously
described). On Days 5 and 10, one or two grasshoppers
from each treatment group and five from the control were
dissected and examined for gregarines. These examinations looked for early and profound control; however, no
dramatic effects were found in these early inspections, and
therefore, these low-n results are not reported here. On
Day 15, we dissected one or two grasshoppers from each
treatment group, and on Day 20, all survivors were dissected and examined for gregarines.

Determination of proper doses for antibiotics
We prepared a wide range of concentrations of each antibiotic in carrot juice, as above, and then determined the
maximum concentrations acceptable to adult male grasshoppers (the highest dose that 90% of hungry grasshoppers would consume). Once the maximum accepted dose
was determined, we then selected our test doses as 50% of
the maximum accepted dose (Table 1). Note that our purpose was not to compare identical doses of different antibiotics, but to identify a specific oral dose of antibiotic
that was both palatable to grasshoppers and effective in
eliminating gregarine infection in our test animal.

Evaluation of drug effect
To quantify the gregarines in individual insects, we
removed and opened the host's digestive tract, under
Yeager's physiological saline [46]. We examined the gut
contents under a dissecting microscope, and counted the
number of trophozoites, gamonts, and gametocysts. In
this species, gamonts were always associated (conjugation), and such associated gamonts and gametocyst were
counted as two individuals. Thus the total number of gregarines per grasshopper = # trophozoites + 2 × (# associated gamonts + # gametocysts). Our gregarine parasite
requires more than 20 days to complete its life cycle at 26
± 2°C. Hence, in our experiment, when we found individuals to be gregarine-free on days 15 or 20, we assumed
that this had resulted from antibiotic treatment. We analyzed the combined data for Days 15 and 20 by one way
ANOVA weighted for unequal variances, and the difference among treatment groups were identified using

Tukey's honesty significant difference test. The data were
normalized by log transformation before carrying out the
ANOVA. All analysis were completed using Statistica 5.5
(StatSoft, Inc. Tulsa, OK, U.S.A) with α = 0.05.

Results
The mean densities of gregarines (pooled data for Days 15
and 20) for the different treatment groups are presented in
Figure 2. Grasshoppers treated with metronidazole
(ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD test, P < 0.01) and griseofulvin (ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD test, P < 0.05)
exhibited significantly lower gregarine counts than control insects (Fig. 2). No other treatments were significantly
different from the control; however, albendazole treatment exhibited a strong, but non-significant trend for
reduced gregarine count (P > 0.05; Fig. 2). In contrast, a
non-significant antagonistic trend was observed in the
streptomycin treatment, which showed higher gregarine

poor absorption rate of albendazole across the gut. However, albendazole absorption is enhanced in mammals by
taking it with fatty meals [60].

Discussion
Of the 11 antimicrobials tested in this experiment, griseofulvin was the most effective in reducing gregarine parasites in the gut lumina of grasshoppers, followed by
metronidazole. Griseofulvin, a chlorine-containing
metabolite of the fungus Penicillium griseofulvum Direck
[47], has been successfully used against onychomycosis
(fungus), and used for more than three decades to treat
dermatomycoses in humans and animals. It inhibits
nucleic acid synthesis and its main effect on mitosis is due
to disorganization of spindle microtubules in the M phase
[48,49]. To our knowledge, griseofulvin has never been
used to treat any apicomplexan parasite groups. Hence the
potential use of griseofulvin against gregarines and related
apicomplexan groups should be explored.
Metronidazole is a benzimidazole, known for its strong
antiprotozoan activity, first used to treat Trichomonas vaginalis (Phylum: Zoomastigina) and later Entamoeba histolytica (Phylum: Sarcomastigophora), Giardia lamblia
(Sarcomastigophora) and Cryptosporidium sp. (Phylum:
Apicomplexa) [50-53]. It is administered in an inactive
form and enters cells by passive diffusion [54]. The drug is
then activated in cells via electron transfer from ferredoxin
to its nitro group, resulting in the therapeutically active
intermediate [55]. In the present study, metronidazole
reduced gregarine mean intensities by 90% over controls,
an effect comparable with the 71% reduction reported by
Smith and Clopton [40] for treatment with metronidazole
in their gregarine-cockroach model system. The dosage
used in the present study (20 mg/kg body weight/day) is
50-fold higher than the dosage (0.4 mg/kg body weight/
day) used by Smith and Clopton [40]. Moreover, their
treatment regime was only for 5 days, whereas we administered metronidazole up to 19 days. However, on Day 10,
we introduced a large dose of gregarine oocysts (~3000)
into our test animals. Overall, our study reaffirms that
metronidazole is a strong gregarinostat.
Albendazole, another benzimidazole with broad-spectrum antihelminthic and antifungal activity, is also effective against various protozoa [56]. It binds to tubulin and
affects cytoskeletal microtubules; this property makes it
potentially useful in the treatment of some protozoan
infections in addition to its more established roles in therapy for helminthic infections. Albendazole is also strongly
active against Plasmodium berghei and P. falciparum [5759]. In our experiments, treatment with albendazole
resulted in a strong, but non-significant decrease in the
gregarine count. The lack of significance may be due to the

Earlier reports suggested that sulfadimethoxine displays
some apicomplexan toxicity and this, and related compounds, are commonly used for prophylactic control of
coccidians in livestock and poultry [1,61,62]. Recently
Clopton and Smith [41] evaluated the activity of sulfadimethoxine against Gregarina cubensis and Protomagalhaensia
granulosae
(Apicomplexa: Eugregarinida),
infecting the Death's Head cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis,
and found that sulfadimethoxine significantly reduced
the mean gregarine intensities, but did not eliminate the
gregarine infection completely. In our test, sulfadimethoxine did not significantly reduce the gregarine numbers
even after 19 days of treatment. One possible reason
might be due to the dosage: the 30 mg/kg body weight
used in our experiment is 5–6 times lower than the dosage
(170 mg/kg body weight) used by Clopton and Smith
[41] in their cockroach-gregarine model. Mourya et al.
[30] assessed the efficacy of sulfadimethoxine against
Ascogregarina culicis (Eugregarinida: Lecudinidae) infecting larval Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Though high concentration of sulfadimethoxine (0.5 mg/ml culture water)
reduced the mean gregarine intensity, it also resulted in
host mortality of upto 52%.
In our study, streptomycin-treated animals had, on average, double the gregarine load of control animals.
Although the difference was not significant, it suggests the
possibility that streptomycin aggravated gregarine infection. In humans, gut microbiota effectively limit the
capacity of invading micro-organisms, including pathogens, to colonize the gut, giving rise to what has been
termed 'colonisation resistance' [63]. Streptomycin is a
strong bacterial antibiotic which inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit [64]. In the
present study, streptomycin may have reduced midgut
bacteria in grasshoppers, thereby increasing the survival of
gregarines. Toure et al. [65] reported that combination
antibiotics such as gentamicin, penicillin, and streptomycin reduced the bacterial flora in the mosquito midgut,
which in turn increased the infectivity of Plasmodium falciparum in Anopheles mosquitoes. Likewise, Culex bitaeniorhynchus mosquitoes treated with tetracycline showed an
increased susceptibility to the Japanese encephalitis (JE)
virus [30].

Conclusion
The gregarines (Apicomplexa) appear to be highly resistant to chemotherapy, although our results suggest that
metronidazole and griseofulvin have moderate antibiotic
effects. Streptomycin might aggravate gregarine infections. Apicomplexa parasites have a global impact on eco-

nomic development and on the health and survival of
millions of people and domesticated animals worldwide.
New therapies for the diseases they cause are urgently
required, but many drugs have proven ineffective [42] or
are becoming increasingly ineffective because of increased
antibiotic resistance in pathogens [66]. The insect system
described here is a simple method for evaluation of drugs
against gregarines. It can also serve as a model system to
identify compounds with a potential broad activity
against other Apicomplexa. Insects can be cheaply massreared, require less laboratory space and support facilities,
do not suffer from the ethical problems of using mammals as experimental hosts, and share some common
immune-response features with vertebrates [67]. Insects
can be infected by virtually all pathogen and parasite taxa,
including viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria, fungi, protozoa,
and nematodes, etc. Therefore, insects can be exploited,
not only to examine pathogens of arthropods, but also to
screen new drugs for potential use against a wide range of
pathogens and parasites of vertebrates [40,41,68]. Finally,
the effects of gregarines on arthropod vectors of vertebrate
diseases have been largely ignored. Understanding such
effects will require the ability to culture gregarine-free
hosts. This research contributes to that goal.
