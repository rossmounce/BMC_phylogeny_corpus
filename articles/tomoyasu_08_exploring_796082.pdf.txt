Abstract
Background: RNA interference (RNAi) is a highly conserved cellular mechanism. In some
organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, the RNAi response can be transmitted systemically. Some
insects also exhibit a systemic RNAi response. However, Drosophila, the leading insect model
organism, does not show a robust systemic RNAi response, necessitating another model system
to study the molecular mechanism of systemic RNAi in insects.
Results: We used Tribolium, which exhibits robust systemic RNAi, as an alternative model system.
We have identified the core RNAi genes, as well as genes potentially involved in systemic RNAi,
from the Tribolium genome. Both phylogenetic and functional analyses suggest that Tribolium has a
somewhat larger inventory of core component genes than Drosophila, perhaps allowing a more
sensitive response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We also identified three Tribolium homologs
of C. elegans sid-1, which encodes a possible dsRNA channel. However, detailed sequence analysis
has revealed that these Tribolium homologs share more identity with another C. elegans gene, tag130. We analyzed tag-130 mutants, and found that this gene does not have a function in systemic
RNAi in C. elegans. Likewise, the Tribolium sid-like genes do not seem to be required for systemic
RNAi. These results suggest that insect sid-1-like genes have a different function than dsRNA
uptake. Moreover, Tribolium lacks homologs of several genes important for RNAi in C. elegans.
Conclusion: Although both Tribolium and C. elegans show a robust systemic RNAi response, our
genome-wide survey reveals significant differences between the RNAi mechanisms of these
organisms. Thus, insects may use an alternative mechanism for the systemic RNAi response.
Understanding this process would assist with rendering other insects amenable to systemic RNAi,
and may influence pest control approaches.

Background

A decade has passed since the discovery that double-stranded
RNA molecules (dsRNA) can trigger silencing of homologous
genes, and it is now clear that RNA-mediated gene silencing
is a widely conserved cellular mechanism in eukaryotic
organisms [1-3]. RNA-mediated gene silencing can be categorized into two partially overlapping pathways; the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway and the micro-RNA (miRNA)
pathway [2,4-6]. RNAi is triggered by either endogenous or
exogenous dsRNA, and silences endogenous genes carrying
homologous sequences at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. In contrast, the miRNA pathway is triggered by mRNAs transcribed from a class of non-coding
genes. These mRNAs form hairpin-like structures, creating
double-stranded regions in a molecule (pre-miRNA). In
either pathway, dsRNA molecules are processed by Dicer
RNase III proteins into small RNAs (for a review of Dicer, see
[7]), which are then loaded into silencing complexes
(reviewed in [8]). In the RNAi pathway, small RNAs are called
short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and are loaded into RNAinduced silencing complexes (RISC) for post-transcriptional
silencing, or RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene
silencing (RITS) complexes for transcriptional silencing. In
contrast, miRNAs (small RNAs in the miRNA pathway) are
loaded into miRNA ribonucleoparticles (miRNPs) (see [2] for
a review of silencing complexes). dsRNA binding motif
(dsRBM) proteins, such as R2D2 and Loquacious, help small
RNAs to be loaded properly into silencing complexes [9-14].
Using the small RNA as a guide, silencing complexes find target mRNAs and cleave them (in the case of RISC) or block
their translation (in the case of miRNP). RITS is involved in
transcriptional silencing by inducing histone modifications.
Argonaute family proteins are the main components of silencing complexes, mediating target recognition and silencing
(reviewed in [15,16]). The RNAi pathway and miRNA pathway are essentially parallel, using related but distinct proteins
at each step. For instance, in Drosophila, Dicer2, R2D2 and
Argonaute2 are involved in the RNAi pathway, while Dicer1,
Loquacious, and Argonaute1 function in the miRNA pathway
[10,12,14,17,18]. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the primary siRNAs processed by Dicer are used as guides for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to produce secondary dsRNAs
in a two-step mechanism [19,20]. This amplification step is
apparently essential for the RNAi effect in C. elegans [19-21].
RNAi has become a widely used tool to knock down and analyze the function of genes, especially in non-model organisms
where the systematic recovery of mutants is not feasible.
However, in some organisms, delivery of dsRNA presents a
problem. Injecting dsRNA directly into eggs seems to be the
most efficient way to induce an RNAi effect; however, many
embryos do not survive the injection procedure, the number
of knock-down embryos generated is limited and all individuals have been injured by the injection. In addition, in some
species such as Drosophila, dsRNA injection into embryos
sometimes results in a mosaic pattern of knock-down effect

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R10

Tomoyasu et al. R10.2

[22]. Furthermore, knocking down genes frequently kills the
embryo, making it difficult to perform functional analyses of
these genes at later, post-embryonic stages. In a few highly
established model systems, such as Drosophila, hairpin constructs can be used to overexpress dsRNA in particular tissues
at certain stages [23-25]. Virus-mediated methods offer an
alternative way to overexpress dsRNA [26]; however, some
organisms seem to eliminate virus quickly (M Jindra, personal communication), making it difficult to apply this
method globally. In some organisms (but not others) dsRNA
can be introduced at postembryonic stages by feeding, soaking or direct injection (for example, larval/nymphal stage [2731], adult stage [32-37], feeding RNAi [38,39], soaking RNAi
[40]). The dsRNA somehow enters cells and induces an RNAi
effect systemically. Transmission of the RNAi effect to the
next generation is also possible (parental RNAi [41-45]).
However, some organisms, such as the silkworm moth Bombyx mori, do not show a robust systemic RNAi response [46]
(ST, unpublished data; R Futahashi and T Kusakabe, personal communications; but see also [47-49] for some successful cases). Understanding the molecular mechanisms
underlying systemic RNAi may help in applying RNAi techniques to these organisms.
Systemic RNAi was first described in plants as spread of posttranscriptional gene silencing [50-52]. The first animal in
which RNAi was shown to work systemically was C. elegans,
where it has been thoroughly investigated [1,53] (for reviews
of systemic RNAi, see [54-57]). The phenomenon can be subdivided into two distinct steps: uptake of dsRNA by cells, and
systemic spreading of the RNAi effect [58]. Several genes
have been identified in C. elegans as important for systemic
spread but not for the interference itself. sid-1 encodes a
multi-transmembrane domain protein, which is thought to
act as a channel for dsRNA [53,59]. Mosaic analysis in C. elegans as well as the overexpression of Sid-1 in cultured cells
show that Sid-1 is involved in the dsRNA uptake step in both
somatic and germ-line cells [53,59]. Three more proteins,
Rsd-2, Rsd-3, and Rsd-6, have been identified as important
factors for the systemic RNAi response in germ-line but not
somatic cells [60]. Recently, over 20 genes have been
reported to be necessary for dsRNA uptake in Drosophila tissue culture cells [61,62]. Many of the genes identified in this
system have been previously implicated in endocytosis, suggesting that this process may play an important role in dsRNA
uptake also in other cells [61,62].
Interestingly, core RNA machineries are not involved in systemic RNAi spreading in C. elegans. Homozygous Argonaute
mutant (rde-1) individuals are still capable of transmitting
the RNAi effect from intestine to gonad [63]. The same result
is observed in rde-4 mutants (rde-4 encodes a dsRBM protein
that acts upstream of Rde-1) [63]. These mutants produce
only initial siRNAs, which represent only a trace amount
compared to the secondary siRNAs and are not sufficient to
trigger any RNAi response [21,64]. These data indicate that,

Genome Biology 2008,

at least in these mutant conditions, siRNA production and
amplification are not necessary for spreading of the RNAi
effect in C. elegans, suggesting that dsRNA itself may be the
transmitting factor for RNAi spreading. Longer dsRNA is
preferably imported by tissue culture cells overexpressing the
C. elegans sid-1 gene, which supports this view [59]. Moreover, 50 bp dsRNA injected into an intestinal cell is too short to
induce systemic RNAi in C. elegans [59], suggesting that it is
not siRNAs or dsRNA subsequently produced by RdRP, but
rather the long initial dsRNA, which is critical for the systemic
RNAi response.
Although, systemic RNAi spreading from cell to cell has not
been shown in any animals other than C. elegans (spreading
does not seem to occur in Drosophila ([65]), systemic uptake
of dsRNA by cells seems to be conserved in some insects [2730,32-37,41,42,45]. Unfortunately, the systemic aspect of
RNAi in Drosophila, the prime insect model organism, has
not been studied thoroughly, and the extent to which systemic
RNAi occurs in this insect is still unknown. Some tissues in
Drosophila adults (including oocytes) [35,36,45] seem to be
capable of taking up dsRNA; however, the systemic RNAi
response seems to be greatly reduced in the larval stage (SCM
and YT, unpublished data). In addition, parental RNAi at the
pupal stage for some genes has failed (GB and M Klingler,
unpublished data). The lack of a robust systemic RNAi
response in Drosophila necessitates another model system if
systemic RNAi is to be studied in insects. The red flour beetle,
Tribolium castaneum, is the best characterized insect genetic
model system besides Drosophila. Since Tribolium has the
ability to respond to dsRNA systemically [27,41], it is an ideal
model system for studying this process in insects.
The recently completed genomic sequence of T. castaneum
[66] allowed us to comprehensively analyze the inventory of
Tribolium homologs of genes involved in RNA-mediated gene
silencing and the systemic RNAi response. Our results suggest that the molecular mechanisms for both RNAi amplification and dsRNA uptake in Tribolium are different from those
in C. elegans. Therefore, systemic RNAi in insects might be
based on a different mechanism that remains to be discovered. We also noticed several differences in the number of
RNAi core component genes between Tribolium and Drosophila. These differences might contribute to the robust
RNAi response in Tribolium. Based on our results we discuss
several factors that might make Tribolium so amenable to
systemic RNAi.

Results
Core RNAi components
Although the core components of RNA-mediated gene silencing are usually well conserved among species, the number
and the degree of conservation of these proteins often vary
between species. The efficiency of RNAi might affect the

degree of systemic RNAi response. Therefore, we have surveyed genes that encode some core RNAi components.

Dicer and dsRBM protein family
Dicer family proteins are involved in the production of small
RNA molecules and have several conserved motifs (Figure 1c)
[7,67]: two amino-terminal DExH-Box helicase domains, a
PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille) domain, tandem RNase III
domains and a carboxy-terminal dsRNA binding domain. A
single Dicer protein is involved in both the siRNA and miRNA
pathways in C. elegans [67-69]. In contrast, different Dicer
proteins are assigned to the siRNA and miRNA pathways in
Drosophila [17]. Dcr-1, which retains a PAZ domain but lacks
an amino-terminal helicase domain (Figure 1c), is involved in
the miRNA pathway [17]. On the other hand, Dcr-2 seems to
lack a full-length PAZ domain but has the helicase domain
(Figure 1c), and is involved in the RNAi pathway [17]. In addition, a distantly related RNase III emzyme, Drosha, is
involved in the maturation of miRNA precursors [70,71].
We identified one drosha and two Dicer genes in the Tribolium genome. One gene (Tc-Dcr-1) clearly codes for the
ortholog of Dm-Dcr-1 and Ce-Dcr-1. The sequence of the second Tribolium Dicer does not clearly cluster with Dm-Dcr-2
(Figure 1a, b). However, as it shares some similarities in
domain architecture with Dm-Dcr-2 (Figure 1c, and see
below), we tentatively call it Tc-Dcr-2.
A ScanProsite search [72] has revealed that, in contrast to
Dm-Dcr-1, which lacks a helicase domain, Tc-Dcr-1 retains
both the helicase and PAZ domains (Figure 1c). This domain
architecture makes Tc-Dcr-1 more similar to Ce-Dcr-1. TcDcr-2 also has both domains, but the PAZ domain is more
diverged (Figure 1c). ScanProsite shows high scores for the
PAZ domains of Ce-Dicer-1, Tc-Dcr-1, and Dm-Dcr-1 (scores
of 24, 23 and 30, respectively), while the PAZ domain in TcDcr-2 shows a lower score (score 17) (see Materials and methods for a brief explanation of these scores). Dm-Dcr-2, which
lacks a full-length PAZ domain, shows a much lower score for
the PAZ domain region (score 8). Tc-Dcr-2 also lacks the carboxy-terminal dsRNA binding domain. The diverged PAZ
domain and the lack of the dsRNA binding domain make TcDcr-2 more similar to Dm-Dcr-2 (Figure 1c).
A group of dsRBM-containing proteins act with Dicer to load
small RNA molecules into a silencing complex. In Drosophila, each Dicer protein acts with a particular dsRBM protein: Loquacious (Loqs) for Dcr-1, R2D2 for Dcr-2, and Pasha
for Drosha [10-14,73]. Interestingly, these proteins seem to
determine the specificity of Dicer proteins, since Drosophila
Dcr-1, which normally processes miRNAs, can instead produce siRNA in a loqs mutant [11,14]. This suggests that differences in these dsRBM-containing proteins might affect the
efficiency of RNAi in different organisms.

cannot solve the orthology of insect Dcr-2 proteins, the similarity in the domain architectures of Dm-Dcr-2 and Tc-Dcr-2 suggests that they might be

might also be involved in both pathways (unlike Dm-Dcr-1, which is involved only in the RNAi pathway). The ScanProsite scores are shown and the
location of domain truncations is indicated. The first helicase domain in Dm-Dcr-1 and dsRBD in Tc-Dcr-2 (indicated by an asterisk) are not recognized by

We found clear orthologs of Drosophila loqs and pasha in
Tribolium (Figure 2). In contrast, the Tribolium genome contains two R2D2-like genes (we named one of them Tc-R2D2
and the other Tc-C3PO), but orthology with Drosophila R2D2
is not as clear as for the other dsRBM proteins (Figure 2).
In conclusion, Drosophila and Tribolium have the same
number of Dicer proteins. However, similarity of domain
architecture of Tc-Dcr-1 to Ce-Dcr-1 (rather than to Dm-Dcr1) suggests that, in addition to Tc-Dcr-2, Tc-Dcr-1 could also
be involved in both the miRNA and RNAi pathways, perhaps
contributing to the robust RNAi response in Tribolium. The
presence of an additional R2D2-like protein might also help
make Tribolium hypersensitive to dsRNA molecules taken up
by cells.

Argonaute family
Argonaute proteins are core components of RISC and miRNP,
and are involved in siRNA-based as well as miRNA-based
silencing [2,16]. Some Argonaute proteins are also involved in
transcriptional silencing as a component of RITS [74,75]. Different Argonaute proteins are used for each process [16]. For
instance, in Drosophila, Ago-1 and Ago-2 are predominantly
used for miRNA and siRNA pathways, respectively [18], while
Piwi, Aubergine (Aub), and Ago-3 are used for transcriptional
silencing [76-79]. Argonaute proteins contain two distinctive
domains: a PAZ domain and a PIWI domain [16]. The PAZ

domain seems to be involved in dsRNA binding, while the
PIWI domain possesses RNase activity.
There is a striking expansion of Argonaute proteins in C. elegans (27 Argonaute proteins have been identified) [80]. As in
Drosophila, these Argonaute proteins function in different
processes. Rde-1 and Ergo-1 have been identified to act in the
RNAi pathway [9,80], while Alg-1 and Alg-2 are important for
the miRNA pathway [81]. Yigit et al. [80] identified yet
another class of Argonaute proteins, the secondary Argonautes (Sago), that interact specifically with the siRNAs produced
via RdRP amplification but not with the initial siRNAs. These
results led the authors to propose a two-step model: first, the
primary siRNAs, which are produced from the initial dsRNA,
bind specifically to the initial Argonautes (Rde-1 or Ergo-1),
and second, subsequent amplification by RdRP leads to the
production of secondary siRNAs, which exclusively bind to
secondary Argonaute proteins. This two-step recognition is
proposed to be required for amplification of the RNAi effect,
and at the same time possibly reducing off-target effects. As
the secondary Argonaute proteins lack critical metal binding
residues in the catalytic RNAse H-related PIWI domain, they
are predicted to recruit other nucleases for degradation of target mRNAs [80].
Both Tribolium and Drosophila have five Argonaute genes.
To investigate the orthology relationships of these genes we
calculated a tree based on an alignment of the PIWI domains
of all Tribolium and Drosophila Argonaute proteins, a representative selection of C. elegans paralogs and the single
Schizosaccharomyces pombe Argonaute protein (Figure 3;
see Additional data file 1 for the alignment).
A single miRNA class Argonaute (Ago-1 in Drosophila and
Alg-1/Alg-2 in C. elegans) is present in Tribolium (Tc-Ago-1).
For the siRNA class Argonautes, we found two Ago-2 paralogs
in Tribolium (Tc-Ago-2a and Tc-Ago-2b) that probably stem
from a duplication in the lineage leading to beetles. These two
proteins are clearly orthologous to Drosophila Ago-2; however, the relationships to C. elegans Rde-1 and Ergo-1 are not
resolved in our analysis. The duplication of Ago-2 in Tribolium might lead to higher amounts of Tc-Ago2 protein and,
hence, an enhanced RNAi response.
For the Piwi/Aub class Argonautes, which are involved in
transcriptional silencing, we find one Tribolium ortholog (TcPiwi) of the Drosophila Piwi and Aub. One additional protein
of this family (Tc-Ago3) is orthologous to a recently described
Drosophila protein, Dm-Ago3 [77,82]. All these insect PIWItype proteins are orthologous to the C. elegans Prg-1 and Prg2.
Importantly, we do not find any homologs of secondary Argonaute proteins (represented by Ce-Ppw-1 and Ppw-2 in our
tree) in either Tribolium or Drosophila (Figure 3). Furthermore, we confirmed that all Tribolium and Drosophila Argo-

Phylogenetic analysis of Argonaute proteins
Phylogenetic analysis of Argonaute proteins. The neighbor-joining tree is based on the alignment of the conserved PIWI domain. Argonaute proteins can
be categorized into four groups, each important for a different process; the RNAi pathway, the miRNA pathway, transcriptional silencing, and amplification
of the RNAi effect (secondary Argonautes). Tribolium and Drosophila lack secondary Argonautes, suggesting that the secondary Argonaute-based
amplification mechanism is not conserved in these insects.

naute proteins do have the metal binding residues of the PIWI
domain, unlike the C. elegans secondary Argonaute proteins,
which lack them [80]. The only exception is Drosophila Piwi,
which has a lysine instead of a histidine in the third position.
These data, along with the fact that the Tribolium genome
lacks an ortholog of RdRP (see below), suggest that the twostep RNAi mechanism of RdRP-mediated amplification followed by secondary Argonaute function is not conserved in
either Tribolium or Drosophila. The different abilities of Drosophila and Tribolium to perform systemic RNAi might,
therefore, depend on factors other than the Argonaute repertoire in these insects.

Absence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in Tribolium
Systemic RNAi relies on the distribution of the trigger
dsRNA, its uptake and subsequent efficient gene knockdown
in cells. The distribution of the dsRNA trigger leads to its dilu-

tion [83]. Hence, a mechanism for enhancing the signal may
be required for efficient silencing. RdRP is a key for the amplification of the RNAi effect in C. elegans as well as in several
plants [19,20,84,85]. It is possible that Tribolium has a similar amplification mechanism. However, we do not find a gene
encoding an RdRP-related protein in the Tribolium genome
by BLAST searches. Moreover, a BLAST search of all metazoan genes in the NCBI database identified RdRP genes only
in several Caenorhabditis species and a cephalochordate
Branchiostoma floridae [86]. Even some nematode species
outside Caenorhabditis do not seem to carry RdRP genes. All
other eukaryotic RdRPs belong to plants, fungi or protists,
suggesting that RdRP is not conserved in animals (Figure 4).
The lack of an RdRP gene in Tribolium suggests that the
strong RNAi response in Tribolium does not rely on amplification of the trigger dsRNA by RdRP.

Tetrahymena thermophila.

Eri-1-like exonuclease family
In C. elegans, several tissues, such as the nervous system, are
refractory to RNAi, apparently due to the expression of eri-1
[87]. Abundant siRNA accumulates in eri-1 mutants, suggesting that Eri-1 is involved in siRNA degradation [87]. The eri1 gene encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein that contains a SAP/SAF-box domain and DEDDh family exonuclease
domain [87]. The expression level and/or tissue specificity of

eri-1 homologs might cause differences in sensitivity to
dsRNA among organisms.
We have identified an eri-1-like gene in Tribolium. 5' and 3'
rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis has
revealed that this gene encodes a 232 amino acid protein (see
Materials and methods for details). We also found a close
homolog of this gene in Drosophila (CG6393, Dm-snipper).

Several proteins are important for the systemic spread of the
RNAi response in C. elegans but not for the RNAi pathway
itself [53,60]. However, the degree of conservation of these
proteins in other organisms has not been described. The presence of these factors might be critical for robust systemic
RNAi. In addition, dozens of proteins have recently been
identified as crucial for dsRNA uptake in Drosophila S2 cells
[61,62]. We have screened the Tribolium genome for
homologs of both of these groups of proteins.

Figure 5
Phylogenetic analysis of Eri-1-like exonucleases
Phylogenetic analysis of Eri-1-like exonucleases. The neighbor-joining tree
is based on the alignment of the exonuclease domain. Eri-1-like nucleases
cluster into three subclasses: Eri-1/3'Exo, Snipper, and Pint1. Tribolium and
Drosophila have only Snipper-type nucleases. One human and three sea
urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) proteins are represented by NCBI
accession numbers.

Interestingly, these genes are lacking the amino-terminal
SAP/SAF-box domain. Also, phylogenetic analysis using the
nuclease domain (Additional data file 1) reveals that the
insect homologs cluster together, while Ce-Eri-1 and its
human ortholog (3'hExo; three prime histone mRNA
exonuclease [88]) compose another subclass. We subsequently noticed that there are at least three subclasses of
nucleases closely related to Eri-1 in metazoans: the Eri-1/
3'hExo subclass, the Pint1 (Prion Interactor 1 [89], also
named Prion protein interacting protein (PrPIP) in [90]) subclass, and the Snipper subclass (Figure 5). Humans as well as
sea urchins have all three subclasses of nucleases. C. elegans
has at least two types of these nucleases, which belong to the
Eri-1/3'hExo and Pint1 subclassses, respectively. In addition,
it contains another nuclease (Cell-death-related nuclease 4
(Crn-4) [91]), whose position relative to the three subclasses
of nucleases is unclear. Crn-4 clusters with C. elegans Eri-1
(Additional data file 2), but this affinity is questionable since
Crn-4 does not share the amino-terminal region that is conserved in other members of the Eri-1/3'Exo subclass. The Tribolium and Drosophila nucleases, with their vertebrate and
sea urchin orthologs, compose a distinct subclass (Snipper
subclasss). This suggests that Drosophila and Tribolium lack
nucleases belonging to the Eri-1 subclass, and that the insect
nucleases might have a function other than siRNA digestion.
Recently, the Drosophila nuclease has been characterized as
Snipper (Snp) [90]; therefore, we have named the Tribolium
ortholog Tc-Snp. Although Snp can cleave RNA as well as
DNA molecules in vitro, Snp seems to have no role in RNAi in
Drosophila [90]. This supports our idea that the Snp subclass
nucleases might not have an important role in the RNAi path-

Sid-1 is the best characterized protein involved in systemic
RNAi in C. elegans [53,59]. The Sid-1 protein contains a long
amino-terminal extracellular domain followed by an array of
transmembrane domains, which are inferred to form a channel for dsRNA molecules [53,59]. Mosaic analysis in C. elegans using a sid-1 overexpression construct showed that Sid1 is cell-autonomously required for receiving the systemic
RNAi signal (it is still possible that Sid-1 is also involved in the
RNAi spreading step) [53]. Overexpression of sid-1 in Drosophila culture cells also enhances the ability of the cells to
uptake dsRNA from the culture media, further suggesting an
important role for Sid-1 in dsRNA uptake [59]. C. elegans carries two additional sid-1 like genes, tag-130 (also known as
ZK721.1) and Y37H2C1, although their functions are unclear.
Many vertebrate species also have sid-1 homologs [53,92].
However, Drosophila, which does not show a robust systemic
RNAi response, lacks sid-1-like genes, leading to the hypothesis that the presence or absence of a sid-1-like gene is the primary determinant of whether or not systemic RNAi occurs in
an organism [28,53,92-94].
We have identified three sid-1-like genes in the Tribolium
genome. We have decided to call these genes sil (sid1-like; TcsilA-C) instead of Tc-sid-1, because of uncertainty about the
orthology of insect sid1-like genes to C. elegans sid-1 (see
below). RT-PCR and RACE analyses have revealed the fulllength sequences (Tc-SilA, 764 amino acids; Tc-SilB, 732
amino acids; Tc-SilC, 768 amino acids, see Materials and
methods for details). Like C. elegans Sid-1, all three proteins
contain a long amino-terminal extracellular domain followed
by 11 transmembrane domains predicted by TMHMM server
version 2.0. InterProScan identified no additional motifs or
domains.
To determine whether the presence of sil genes correlates
with the presence of systemic RNAi in insects, we have
searched the genome of several insects using the Tc-SilA protein sequence as a query (Table 1). The honeybee (Apis mellifera; Hymenoptera) and a parasitic wasp (Nasonia
vitripennis; Hymenoptera) each contain a single sid-1-like

gene. The silkworm moth (B. mori; Lepidoptera) has three
sid-1-like genes. We have determined the full-length
sequences of these genes in Bombyx (see details in Materials
and methods). As previously mentioned, D. melanogaster
does not have any sid-1-like genes. We have confirmed that
none of the 11 additional Drosophila species whose genomes
have been sequenced carry sid-1 family genes. In addition,
two mosquito species (Anopheles gambiae and Aedes
aegypti) also lack sid-1-like genes, suggesting the early loss of
sid-1-like genes in the dipteran lineage.
The presence of three sil genes in Tribolium is consistent with
their hypothesized importance to a robust systemic RNAi
response. It has also been shown that parental RNAi is possible in Nasonia [42], which is consistent with the presence of
a sil gene in this insect. On the surface, the lack of sid-1-like
genes in dipterans seems to correlate with the apparent lack
of systemic RNAi response in these insects. However, reports
that some tissues in Drosophila as well as in mosquitos are
capable of taking up dsRNA [33-37,45] (MJ Gorman,
personal communication) suggest that such correlations
might be misleading. Moreover, Bombyx carries three sil
genes, yet does not show a robust systemic RNAi response (S
Tomita, unpublished data; R Futahashi and T Kusakabe, personal communications). This apparent breakdown in the correlation between systemic RNAi and sil genes (Table 1) raises
the question of whether sid-1-like genes are the determinant
of presence/absence of systemic RNAi in insects.
We have analyzed the expression of sil genes to provide a clue
about the function of these genes in Tribolium. in situ hybridization analysis shows that all three sil genes are expressed
uniformly in embryos; however, silA and silB seem to be
expressed at lower levels than silC (data not shown). Semiquantitative RT-PCR reveals that all sil genes are expressed
throughout all developmental stages (Additional data file 3).

silA and silB expression level is uniform through the larval to
adult stages, while silC has peak expression at the pupal stage.
We have performed phylogenetic analyses using the carboxyterminal conserved region (the region corresponding to the
second to tenth transmembrane domains; Additional data file
4) to solve the orthology of Sid1-like proteins. Both neighbour-joining and maximum-likelihood analyses produce the
same tree with slightly different bootstrap values (see Figure
6a for the neighbour-joining tree). In these trees, all three C.
elegans proteins comprise a distinct cluster. Two of the Tribolium Sil proteins (Tc-SilA and Tc-SilB) also comprise a
separate cluster, while Tc-SilC clusters with honeybee as well
as vertebrate Sid-1-like proteins. Bombyx Sil proteins belong
to this cluster; however, they comprise a distinct sub-cluster
in this branch. This result is somewhat puzzling since it
appears to suggest multiple occurrences of lineage-specific
duplication. Alternatively, the expansion of sil genes might be
ancient, but the paralogs might have been subjected to lineage specific parallel constraints (perhaps to target a species
specific ligand), leading to convergent sequence similarity.
The clustering of the three C. elegans homologs might be due
to a long branch attraction caused by their highly diverged
sequences. The clustering of vertebrate Sid-like proteins with
Tc-SilC and the honeybee proteins might suggest a conserved
function in this cluster.
Although the carboxy-terminal transmembrane region shows
a high degree of identity between all Sid-1-like proteins, the
amino-terminal extracellular region is less conserved (Additional data files 4 and 5). We noticed, however, that there are
several segments in the extracellular region that are shared by
insect and vertebrate Sid-1-like proteins (Figure 6b; see also
Additional data file 5 for dot-matcher alignments). Interestingly, C. elegans Tag-130, but not Sid-1, also shares these
amino-terminal motifs (Figure 6a, Additional data file 5),

raising questions about the orthology of insect/vertebrate
Sid-like proteins and C. elegans Sid-1. Sil proteins in insects
and vertebrates might instead be orthologous to C. elegans
Tag-130.
Although our phylogenetic analysis is inconclusive on the
orthology of insect Sil proteins, the sequence similarity of the
amino-terminal extracellular region between Sil proteins and
C. elegans Tag-130 suggests that these proteins may share
similar functions. To gain further insight into the function of
sil genes, we have analyzed whether tag-130 has any function
in systemic RNAi in C. elegans. We obtained two deletion
alleles of tag-130 from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center.
One allele, tag-130gk245, has been described to have a 711 bp
deletion that removes the promoter region as well as the first
221 bp of the coding region (73 amino acids) (Additional data

file 6). We have confirmed this deletion by PCR. We have also
determined that the other allele, tag-130ok1073, has a 689 bp
deletion spanning several exons that encode transmembrane
domains (exons 14 to 17; see Additional data file 6 for the
detailed deleted region). RT-PCR analysis has revealed that
tag-130gk245 lacks tag-130 gene transcription, suggesting that
this is a null allele. We have detected two different forms of
mRNA transcribed in tag-130ok1073, both of which encode
truncated proteins (Additional data file 6). These proteins
lack several transmembrane domains, suggesting that tag130ok1073 is also a null allele. To determine whether these
mutants are susceptible to systemic RNAi, we fed them unc22 dsRNA expressing E. coli. The N2 wild-type strain was
used as a positive control, and sid-1sq2, a null allele for sid-1
[53,59], was used as a negative control. If tag-130 is involved
in systemic RNAi, mutations in the tag-130 gene should

prevent the unc-22 RNAi twitching effect [95]. However,
almost 100% of individuals carrying either tag-130 deletion
allele show a twitching phenotype upon administration of
unc-22 feeding RNAi, while none of the sid-1 individuals
showed twitching (Table 2). These data indicate that tag-130
is not necessary for the systemic RNAi response in C. elegans.
By extension, the greater sequence similarity of insect Sil proteins to Tag-130 than to Sid-1 suggests that Sil proteins might
not be involved in systemic RNAi in Tribolium.

C. elegans rsd gene homologs
Another screen for C. elegans mutants lacking systemic RNAi
led to the discovery of several additional genes involved in the
systemic RNAi response, including rsd-2, rsd-3, and rsd-6
[60]. Mutants for these genes still retain the systemic RNAi
response in somatic cells, but germ-line cells lack the ability
to respond to dsRNA [60]. The Rsd-2 protein contains no
particular motifs, while Rsd-6 has a Tudor domain, which is
found in some RNA binding proteins [60]. A yeast two-hybrid
analysis found that Rsd-2 interacts directly with Rsd-6, suggesting that these proteins act together [60]. We do not find
Tribolium homologs for rsd-2 or rsd-6 in the genomic
sequence of Tribolium (Table 3) or in several other insects
whose genomes have been sequenced, which suggests that the
Rsd-2/Rsd-6 system is either not conserved in insects, or is
evolving too rapidly to be detected across long evolutionary
distances.
The third gene, rsd-3, encodes a protein that contains an
epsin amino-terminal homology (ENTH) domain [60].

ENTH domains are often found in proteins involved in vesicle
trafficking, suggesting the possible involvement of
endocytosis in systemic RNAi [60]. We found a homolog for
Rsd-3 in Tribolium (Tc-Rsd3). Drosophila also carries a protein similar to Rsd-3 (Epsin-like).
In addition, the Rsd-3 protein has a close relative in C. elegans, Epn-1, whose Drosophila counterpart (Liquid Facets;
Lqf) has been reported to be involved in Notch signaling [9698]. We found a Tribolium ortholog for Epn-1/Lqf, which we
named Tc-Lqf. Although there is no report implying the
involvement of Epn-1/Lqf family proteins in systemic RNAi,
their high degree of identity with Rsd-3 proteins suggest that
such a role is possible.
Since Drosophila (which seems to lack a systemic RNAi
response) also carries Rsd-3-like proteins (Table 3), it does
not seem likely that these proteins determine the presence or
absence of systemic RNAi in insects. However, it might be still
possible that the expression level and/or tissue specificity of
rsd-3-like genes affect the degree of RNAi efficiency.

Endocytosis components and scavenger receptors
Another piece of evidence that suggests the involvement of
endocytosis in dsRNA uptake comes from a study using Drosophila S2 culture cells [61,62]. Among the factors identified
in this study as necessary for dsRNA uptake are a number of
proteins whose functions are implicated in endocytosis
[61,62] (Table 4). Also, several scavenger receptors, such as
Eater and Sr-CI, were found to be important for dsRNA

uptake [61,62] (Table 4). Scavenger receptors are known to
act as receptors for large molecules and/or microbes (for a
review of scavenger receptors, see [99]). Since these receptors
act in phagocytosis, a type of endocytosis, they could potentially act as receptors for dsRNA molecules in an endocytic
process. Although the factors identified in S2 cells might
reflect mechanisms of dsRNA uptake specific to hemocytelike cells [100], it is possible that some of them function in
other tissues as well.
We have identified the Tribolium orthologs of these genes
(Table 4). In many cases, they show clear one-to-one
orthology. In the case of Sr-CI, however, we found only one
Tribolium homolog (Tc-Sr-C), in contrast to four closely
related paralogs in Drosophila [100]. The case of eater is even
more complicated. eater encodes a Nimrod family protein
that contains multiple NIM-type EGF domains [101,102]. A
BLAST search using Drosophila Eater (CG6124) identifies
several predicted Tribolium proteins that contain NIM

repeats. Among them, an NCBI predicted protein
(XP_969372) and Eater are reciprocal best hits, suggesting
that they might be orthologous. However, the similarities
among Nimrod family proteins in both insects make it
difficult to assign orthology. Detailed sequence analysis will
be required to definitively determine the orthology of these
genes.
As in the case of rsd-3, the fact that both Drosophila and Tribolium carry these genes might suggest that these factors do
not determine the presence or absence of systemic RNAi in
insects. Yet, it is still possible that a difference in tissue specificity and/or expression level might affect the efficiency of
dsRNA uptake from the outside environment. Expression
analysis of these genes might help determine whether these
factors are broadly involved in dsRNA uptake in insects.

Functional analysis of Dicer, Argonaute, and Sil genes
in Tribolium
To further understand the RNAi mechanism in Tribolium, we
have developed an assay system to assess the involvement of
genes in the RNAi pathway in vivo. This system takes advantage of an enhancer trap line (Pu11), which expresses
enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) in the eyes and
in the future wing primordia (Figure 7a, b). We previously
reported that the RNAi effect can be monitored by the intensity of EGFP fluorescence in the Pu11 line after EGFP RNAi
[27]. Our assay system is composed of three steps (Figure 7a):
first, RNAi for a gene of interest at the early last larval stage,
prior to the onset of wing EGFP expression in Pu11; second,
RNAi for EGFP two days after the initial injection; and third,
monitoring of the EGFP expression at the prepupal and midpupal stages when Pu11 EGFP expression is most intensified.
In this assay system, the efficiency of EGFP RNAi would be
reduced (therefore, EGFP expression would be visible) if the
gene knocked down at the first step is involved in the RNAi
pathway. In contrast, EGFP expression would be silenced if
the initially knocked down gene is not involved in the RNAi
pathway. In order to maximize the sensitivity of this test, the
initial RNAi is done at a high concentration (1 μg/μl, approximately 0.5 μg/larva) while the second RNAi for EFGP is
performed at a lower concentration (10 ng/μl, approximately
5 ng/larva). This low concentration of EGFP dsRNA is enough
to completely silence EGFP expression (n = 147; Figure 7c)
when injected alone. A potential caveat of this system is that
injection of the initial dsRNA might saturate the RNAi
machinery and prevent the effect of the secondary RNAi in a
non-specific manner. In this case, a low concentration of the
secondary dsRNA might exacerbate the problem.
To rule out such a problem, we first tested our assay system
with genes that are not involved in the RNAi pathway. dsRNA
for dsRed (an exogenous gene) was injected prior to EGFP
RNAi, which resulted in complete silencing of EGFP (n = 27;
Figure 7d). We also used Tc-Ultrabithorax (Tc-Ubx) as a control for an endogenous gene. Tc-Ubx RNAi induced a hindwing to elytron transformation as described before [103], but
did not affect the EGFP silencing (Figure 7e). The prior injection of dsRNA for either an exogenous or an endogenous gene
did not affect the effectiveness of EGFP RNAi, indicating that
our assay system does not have a competition problem.
One of the findings through our genome-wide survey for
RNAi genes in the Tribolium genome is that Tribolium has
more RNAi component genes than Drosophila, which might
make Tribolium more sensitive to dsRNA. We have cloned
the Tribolium Argonaute and Dicer genes and tested whether
these genes are actually involved in the RNAi pathway. We
found that RNAi for Dcr-2 decreases the effectiveness of subsequent EGFP RNAi (Figure 8b; 10 of 17 individuals show
EGFP expression), indicating that Dcr-2 is important for the
RNAi pathway. However, contrary to our analysis of the Dcr1 protein domain architecture (which suggests the possible

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R10

Tomoyasu et al. R10.13

involvement of Dcr-1 in the RNAi pathway), RNAi for Dcr-1
had no effect on EGFP RNAi (n = 32; Figure 8a), and did not
enhance the effect of the Dcr-2 RNAi in the Dcr-1/2 double
RNAi (Figure 8c; 12 of 30 show EGFP expression). Instead,
Dcr-1 RNAi shows an occasional wing expansion defect (3 of
20), suggesting that Dcr-1 is involved in wing development,
most likely through the miRNA pathway.
Of the three Tribolium Argonaute genes, we found that both
Ago-2 genes are involved in the RNAi pathway (Figure 8e-g;
8 of 28 Ago-2a RNAi and 12 of 28 Ago-2b individuals show
EGFP expression). This is in line with our hypothesis, and
indicates that Tribolium indeed has duplicated Argonaute
genes that are functional in the RNAi pathway. Larvae
injected with Ago-1 dsRNA show developmental defects and
fail to pupate, but still exhibit efficient EGFP silencing (Figure
8d; n = 21). This result suggests that Ago-1 is involved in the
miRNA pathway, but not in the RNAi pathway.
We also tested whether the Tribolium sil genes are involved in
the RNAi pathway. Neither the single RNAi for each sil gene
nor the triple RNAi shows any effect on subsequent EGFP
RNAi (Figure 8h-k), suggesting that the sil genes are not
involved in systemic RNAi in Tribolium. This result is consistent with our tag-130 deletion mutant analysis in C. elegans. However, this result must be interpreted with caution
since triple RNAi might weaken the RNAi effect on the sil
genes (see Discussion).

Discussion

RNAi techniques have had tremendous impact on many biological fields. In many organisms, RNAi allows loss-of-function phenotypes to be analyzed in the absence of mutants. In
some organisms such as Tribolium, simple injection of
dsRNA into the larval or pupal body cavity can induce the
RNAi response systemically [27,41]. However, some organisms (such as many lepidopteran [46]) lack the ability to
respond to dsRNA systemically. Understanding the
molecular basis of systemic RNAi might help us apply systemic RNAi-based methods to these insects.
Tribolium, which is a highly established genetic model system, has a robust systemic response to dsRNA, giving us an
opportunity to explore the molecular mechanism for systemic
RNAi in an animal other than C. elegans. In this study, we
have surveyed the Tribolium genome for the genes that
encode RNAi core components, as well as the genes that have
been implicated in systemic RNAi. If the mechanism for systemic RNAi is conserved between C. elegans and insects, we
would expect to find a component that is present in C. elegans
and Tribolium but not in Drosophila. However, we find a surprisingly low degree of conservation between the C. elegans
and Tribolium gene inventories.

In the following section, we discuss our results in the context
of three steps that might be important for systemic RNAi: the
cellular uptake of dsRNA; the amplification and maintenance
of dsRNA; and an efficient RNAi response.

The dsRNA uptake mechanism is not highly conserved
For a systemic response, cells must first take up dsRNA from
their environment. Several proteins responsible for dsRNA
uptake have been discovered in C. elegans. The best described
is Sid-1, which can confer the ability to import dsRNA to Drosophila cells in a cell culture environment [59]. The finding of
three sid-1 homologs in Tribolium but none in Drosophila

appears on the surface to be a convincing explanation for the
ostensible lack of systemic RNAi in Drosophila.
We challenge this assumption with two lines of evidence. The
first evidence comes from the fact that all sid-1 homologs in
Tribolium (and other organisms) have more identity with
another C. elegans gene, tag-130, than with sid-1. Importantly, these proteins share several blocks of identity in the
extracellular amino-terminal domain that are not present in
C elegans Sid-1. Since the extracellular domain is likely
important for ligand specificity, this conservation suggests
that the function of Sil proteins in Tribolium might be more
similar to that of Tag-130 than Sid-1. Further, we have shown

Functional
Functional analysis of Dicer, Argonaute, and sil genes in Tribolium. Larvae and pupae that were injected with dsRNA for (a-c) Dicer, (d-g) Argonaute, or
(h-k) sil genes prior to EGFP RNAi. RNAi for Dcr-2, Ago-2a, or Ago-2b reduces the efficiency of EGFP RNAi (b, c, e-g). In contrast, RNAi for Dcr-1, Ago-1,
or sil genes does not affect EGFP RNAi (a, d, h-k).

that the tag-130 gene is not required for systemic RNAi in C.
elegans. These data raise the possibility that the dsRNA
uptake function of sid-1 has evolved in a nematode lineage,
and is not an ancestral feature of tag-130 homologs. C. elegans is known to exhibit an exceptionally high rate of amino
acid change [104]. The long branch of C. elegans Sid-1 in the
phylogenetic tree might support the idea that Sid-1 has
diverged quickly, and gained a function that is not conserved
in other organisms.
The second line of evidence comes from the apparent breakdown in the correlation between systemic RNAi and sil genes
(Table 1). We note that the silkworm moth, B. mori, has similar sil genes but efforts to apply systemic RNAi on this species have been unsuccessful (S Tomita, unpublished data; R
Futahashi and T Kusakabe, personal communications; but
also see [47-49] for some successes). In contrast, some tissues
in adult dipterans have been shown to be capable of taking up
dsRNA [33-37,105], although these insects lack sid-1-like
genes. Parental RNAi has also been performed successfully in
Drosophila [45,106]. In addition, the parasitic nematode spe-

cies Haemonchus contortus shows an ability to respond to
soaking RNAi [107], but sid-1/tag-130 related genes can not
be found in its sequenced genome [107] (data not shown).
Taken together, these observations suggest that a Sid-1-based
mechanism is not the only existing method of dsRNA uptake.
Triple RNAi for the three sil genes does not affect subsequent
RNAi for EGFP (Figure 8h-k), suggesting that sil genes are
dispensable for systemic RNAi in Tribolium. However, the
use of multiple RNAi complicates interpretation of this result.
Competition for RNAi components by multiple dsRNA triggers is known to weaken the efficiency of RNAi in C. elegans
[83] as well as in Tribolium (SCM and YT, unpublished data).
Thus, it is still possible that sil genes are required for systemic
RNAi, but that the competition produced by triple RNAi
results in incomplete knockdown of the sil genes. The stability
of Sil proteins could also affect our assay. Some amount of the
Sil proteins might stay functional even two days after knockdown of the sil genes. In these cases, the systemic RNAi pathway would retain some function. While the above concerns
need to be considered, we do see a delay in larval develop-

ment in the triple sil RNAi (data not shown), but not in each
single RNAi. This might suggest that the triple RNAi is efficiently removing sil gene function. Further functional analysis, such as attempts to rescue C. elegans sid-1 mutants with
Tribolium sil genes, or overexpression of sil genes in Drosophila culture cells, might reveal whether insect Sil proteins
are capable of promoting dsRNA uptake.
Three more genes, rsd-2, rsd-3, and rsd-6, have been identified as important factors for the systemic RNAi response in
germline cells in C. elegans [60]. Two of them, rsd-2 and rsd6, are either not present in the Tribolium genome or their
sequence is rapidly evolving such that homology cannot be
detected over long evolutionary distances. Only rsd-3 has a
clear ortholog in Tribolium (Tc-epsin-like). However, Drosophila also has an epsin-like gene but does not show clear
systemic RNAi. Either the gene is not sufficient to confer
enough dsRNA uptake for systemic RNAi or the expression of
this gene is more restricted in Drosophila.
In summary, the genes required for systemic RNAi in C. elegans are not highly conserved in Tribolium. These findings
contradict the recent suggestion that the presence of sid-1 like
genes is sufficient for a systemic RNAi response in an
organism [28,53,93]. A different mechanism for dsRNA
uptake, such as an endocytosis-based mechanism, might
await discovery in Tribolium.

The C. elegans RNAi amplification mechanism is not
present in Tribolium
In C. elegans (as well as in plants and fungi), RdRP amplifies
the RNAi effect [19,20]. This amplification is apparently
absolutely necessary for the RNAi response in C. elegans, as
RdRP mutants are insensitive to dsRNA [19,20]. The robust
RNAi response in Tribolium might be due to an amplification
mechanism similar to that in C. elegans. However, we do not
find RdRP in Tribolium. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that an RdRP gene is located in the non-sequenced
part of the Tribolium genome, this possibility is unlikely for
several reasons. First, RdRP genes do not seem to be present
in most animals (see the 'Absence of RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase in Tribolium' section). Second, RdRP-amplified
siRNAs are associated with a specific class of Argonautes (secondary Argonautes) in the two-step RNAi mechanism of C.
elegans, but secondary Argonautes are not conserved in Tribolium. And third, in Tribolium, it is possible to target a particular isoform of a gene by RNAi, even when it shares more
upstream sequence with other isoforms (lack of transitive
RNAi) [108]. This indicates that there is no RdRP activity in
Tribolium, since such activity would result in production of
siRNAs corresponding to the region upstream (and perhaps
even downstream) of the initial dsRNA target site and the
knockdown of all messages sharing the upstream sequence. If
there is an RNAi amplification step in Tribolium, it must be
based on a different mechanism.

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R10

Tomoyasu et al. R10.16

The Tribolium RNAi machinery could be more efficient
than that of Drosophila
The inventories of genes involved in systemic RNAi and
amplification do not show clear differences between Tribolium and Drosophila that would explain the presence and
absence of systemic RNAi. An alternative hypothesis is that
the core machineries for RNAi might function with different
efficiencies in these species. Our genomic survey for RNAi
core components has indeed revealed several differences in
the number of these core component genes between Tribolium and Drosophila. Drosophila carries only one Ago-2
gene, while the Tribolium genome has two, apparently due to
a lineage-specific duplication. We have shown that both Tribolium Ago-2 genes are involved in the RNAi pathway (Figure 8d-g). As the availability of Ago proteins has been shown
to determine the RNAi efficiency [80], it is quite possible that
the Ago-2 copy number allows a more efficient RNAi
response in Tribolium than in Drosophila.
There are also interesting differences between Dicer proteins.
Dicer proteins can be involved in both RNAi and miRNA
pathways [7]. For example, Dcr-1 protein in C. elegans functions in both pathways [67,69]. In Drosophila, however, a
subfunctionalization seems to have happened between the
two Dicer genes; one Dicer (Dcr-1) works specifically in the
miRNA pathway, while the other (Dcr-2) functions in the
RNAi pathway [17]. Each of these Dicer proteins has unique
domain losses [17] (Figure 1c). One of the Tribolium Dicer
proteins, Tc-Dcr-2, has similar domain architecture to Drosophila Dcr-2, suggesting that Tc-Dcr-2 is involved in the
RNAi pathway. In contrast, Tc-Dcr-1 has an amino-terminal
helicase domain, which is lacking in Dm-Dcr-1. This makes
the domain architecture of Tc-Dcr-1 more similar to C. elegans Dcr-1, which might suggest that, in addition to Dcr-2,
Dcr-1 could also be involved in the RNAi pathway in Tribolium. Our assay system provided no evidence that Dcr-1 is
also involved in the RNAi pathway (Figure 8a). However,
Dcr-1 RNAi does produce developmental defects. This could
be due to defects in the miRNA pathway, since miRNAs play
a crucial role in development in Drosophila and other organisms [109]. We noticed that the Dcr-1 RNAi phenotype is
weaker than that of Ago-1, which is also likely to be involved
in the miRNA pathway. This difference suggests that there
might be another factor that acts redundantly with Dcr-1.
This redundancy might also influence the Dcr-1 function in
the RNAi pathway, leaving open the possibility that Dcr-1 is
involved in the RNAi pathway but that its RNAi effect is
masked in our assay system by a redundant factor. Dcr-2 is
not the redundant factor since the Dcr-1/2 double RNAi phenotype is still weaker than that of Ago-1. Further functional
analysis is necessary to unravel the involvement of Dicer
genes in the RNAi pathway in Tribolium.
In line with this, the Tribolium genome contains an additional R2D2-like dsRBM gene compared to Drosophila.
R2D2 determines the specificity of Dicers in Drosophila; Dcr-

1 can associate with siRNA in R2D2 mutants [11,14]. An additional R2D2 in Tribolium, with C. elegans-type Tc-Dcr-1,
might contribute to the robust RNAi response in Tribolium.
Alternatively, since dsRBM proteins are known to bind to
dsRNA, they might be involved in the maintenance of dsRNA
in cells. In that case, the presence of an additional dsRBM
protein might allow a longer-lasting RNAi effect. Intriguingly,
it has been suggested that an ATP-dependent mechanism
might be involved in retaining dsRNA inside cells in C.
elegans [59], implying the existence of a yet to be found
dsRNA maintenance mechanism.
These differences in core RNAi components might allow Tribolium cells to respond to dsRNA more sensitively than Drosophila cells. Further functional analysis is necessary to
understand the molecular mechanism underlying the systemic RNAi response in Tribolium, as well as the evolutionary
changes that caused the difference in ability of Tribolium and
Drosophila to respond to dsRNAsystemically.

Ancestral gene set for RNAi machinery
Our genome-wide survey for RNAi genes has revealed that
the repertoire of RNAi genes has been diversified even among
insect species. Although the comparison between Tribolium,
Drosophila, and C. elegans has clearly illuminated diversity
in the inventory of RNAi component genes (Additional data
file 8), more species will be necessary for the reconstruction
of an ancestral RNAi gene set. The RNAi pathway is
conserved not only in animals but also among many
eukaryotes such as fungi, plants, and protists [2,110,111]. Phylogenetic analysis including diverse species might shed light
on understanding the ancestral gene set and evolution of
RNAi machinery.

Conclusion

Our analysis does not find a highly conserved mechanism for
systemic RNAi between C. elegans and Tribolium. Insect systemic RNAi is likely, therefore, to be based on a different
mechanism that remains to be uncovered. Understanding
this process would assist with rendering other insects amenable to systemic RNAi, which in many cases is a prerequisite
for functional gene analysis. In addition, knowing the mechanism of systemic RNAi in insects is likely to influence
approaches of pest control in which dsRNAs are produced by
a host plant. With its robust systemic RNAi response [27,41],
recently sequenced genome [66] and available genetic tools
[112-119], Tribolium offers an excellent opportunity to
uncover the molecular basis of systemic RNAi in insects.

Materials and methods
Manual curation of automatically annotated Tribolium
genes
Tribolium homologs were identified by BLAST search at BeetleBase [120], and the corresponding predicted protein

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R10

Tomoyasu et al. R10.17

sequences were obtained from the Tribolium castaneum
Genome Project website at the Baylor College of Medicine
website [121]. These sequences were used for dot-plot analyses [122] and ClustalW alignments with Drosophila and other
orthologs. Predicted exons that showed no identity to other
orthologs were deleted. Conversely, when the Tribolium predictions were missing regions conserved in other orthologs,
we searched the appropriate region of Tribolium genomic
sequence for exons missed by the predictions.

Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignments were created and curated in MEGA 3.1
(Additional data file 1) [123]. Neighbour-joining analysis was
performed in MEGA 3.1 with bootstrapping using 1,500 or
5,000 replicates. The same alignments were also used in
TreePuzzle for maximum likelihood analysis [123,124] using
standard settings. The trees were visualized using TreeView
[125]. Both types of analysis resulted in essentially the same
relationships.
The following conserved domains were used to create multiple alignments: Piwi domain for Argonaute proteins; first
RNaseI domain for the Dicer protein alignment including
Drosha; full-length except for dsRBM for the Dicer protein
alignment without Drosha; tandem dsRBM for R2D2/Loquacious/Pasha; RdRP domain for RdRP proteins; exonuclease
domain for Eri-1-like exonuclease; and multiple transmembrane domain (corresponds to TM2-TM11 portion of C. elegans Sid-1) for Sid-1-like proteins (Additional data file 1).

Search for RdRP orthologs
S. pombe RdP1 and C. elegans Ego proteins were used as the
query in a tBLASTn search of the NCBI database (first searching all organisms and subsequently restricted to Eukaryota
and then to Metazoa) to identify RdRP homologs. Sequenced
nematode genomes were also searched at Nematode.net
[126]. Viral RdRPs were excluded from the analysis, since
they were not identified by these searches and ClustalW did
not produce reasonable alignments of eukaryotic and viral
RdRPs.

Domain analysis
Domain architecture of Dicer proteins was analyzed by ScanProsite [72,.127]. The scores for each protein domain presented in Figure 1c are similarity scores produced by a
PROSITE search. A query sequence is compared to the
PROSITE protein domain database. Domains are represented
as a 'profile', which is a table of position-specific amino acid
weights and gap costs. These numbers are used to calculate a
similarity score for any alignment between a profile and a
sequence. An alignment with a similarity score higher than or
equal to a given cut-off value indicates a motif occurrence.
Similarity scores below 8.5 are typically (but not for all profiles) regarded as questionable. See details at the PROSITE
website [128]. Sid-1-like proteins were analyzed by TMHMM
server v2.0 [129] and InterProScan [130].

Cloning genes
Total RNA was isolated from Tribolium pupae (or adult Drosophila in the case of Dm-Ago3) using the RNeasy Protect
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, US), and cDNA was
synthesized with SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) using oligo dT primer. Primers for Tc-sil genes and Tcsnp were designed based on the conserved domains identified
by BLASTx analysis using Ce-Sid-1 and Ce-Eri-1, respectively.
Primers for Argonaute and Dicer genes were designed based
on conserved domains identified by BLASTx analysis using
Drosophila homologs. Subsequent RACE analysis was performed using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) on mRNA isolated from Tribolium pupae by the QuickPrep micro mRNA
Purification Kit (GE Healthcare Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ,
USA).

Isolation of Bombyx sil genes
Silkworm whole genome shotgun contigs and scaffolds at
KAIKObase [131] were searched with tBLASTn using Tc-sil
genes as queries. Three scaffolds, 000945, 000542 and
002595, were revealed to contain conserved domains. Primers were designed based on the sequences of these scaffolds
and partial cDNAs were amplified by RT-PCR using mRNA
isolated from Bombyx eggs at 72-120 hours after oviposition.
Full-length cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced by
screening cDNA libraries made from eggs 40 hours after
oviposion [132] and midgut of the fifth instar day-2 larva (gift
from Dr Kazuei Mita, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Japan) with the partial cDNAs as probes.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR
cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III (Invitrogen)
using mRNA isolated from five developmental stages (0-72
hour embryos, third/fourth instar larvae, last instar larvae,
pupae, and adults). PCR was performed using Ex-Taq
polymerase (Takara Bio USA, Madison, WI, USA). Reactions
were performed with a varying number of cycles to ensure
that comparisons were made within the linear range.

C. elegans mutant strains and feeding RNAi
Two tag-130 alleles, tag-130gk245 (strain name: VC452, created by the C. elegans Reverse Genetics Core Facility at UBC)
and tag-130OK1073 (RB1095, created by the C. elegans Gene
Knockout Project at OMRF) were obtained from the
Caenorhabditis Genetic Center at the University of Minnesota. The sid-1sq2 strain and unc-22 feeding RNAi Escherichia
coli strain were the kind gift of Dr K Morita and Dr M Han
(University of Colorado at Boulder, USA). Feeding RNAi was
performed as previously described by Kamath et al. [133],
and the unc-22 twitching RNAi phenotype was scored under
a stereomicroscope. Four independent replicates of the feeding experiment were performed for each genotype.

tag-130 mutant lesion
Genomic DNA was isolated from tag-130 mutants (as well as
N2 and sid-1sq2 strains) by adapting a protocol for isolation of

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R10

Tomoyasu et al. R10.18

genomic DNA from a single Drosophila adult [134]. To determine the deleted region, five sets of primers that together
cover the entire tag-130 gene were used to survey the tag-130
locus.
We
used
[gk245iF1:gtgcatcgtatgagcctgtg]/
[gk245iR1:aattgttgcagacgtggtca] and [OK1073D F1:ctaggtgcaatcagtgagccagtg]/[OK1073E R1:ataaaattccggcacaagtccag]
to amplify the genomic region that contains the deleted
region in tag-130gk245 and tag-130OK1073, respectively. PCR
products were then cloned into pCR4-TOPO using the TOPO
TA-Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen), and sequenced
to determine the deleted region [GenBank: EF695395,
EF695396]. Total RNA was isolated from tag-130 mutants
and the sid-1sq2 and N2 strains using the RNeasy Protect Mini
Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III
(Invitrogen) using oligo dT primer. We used [tag130cDNA
F2:aagagcgtatacacatttggaaga] and [tag130cDNA R3:attacattgatggcggtgaaa] for RT-PCR. We detected two different transcripts in tag-130OK1073, both of which were cloned into
pCR4-TOPO and sequenced [GenBank: EF695397,
EF695398].

dsRNA synthesis and larval injection in Tribolium
A PCR amplified fragment of each gene was cloned into
pCR4-TOPO using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing
(Invitorogen). Primers used to amplify gene fragments and
the size of each fragment are summarized in Additional data
file 9. Templates for in vitro transcription were prepared by
PCR using a primer designed to prime on two pCR4-TOPO
vector regions that flank the inserted gene fragment
[TOPO_RNAi_T7:taatacgactcactatagggcgaattcgccctt]. This
primer amplifies a gene fragment with the T7 polymerase
promoter site at both ends. Gene specific primers with the T7
sequence at their 5' end were used to create a EGFP dsRNA
template (520 bp) [GFPiF2:taatacgactcactatagggcgatgccacct,
GFPiR5: taatacgactcactatagggcggactgggtg] (the T7 site is
underlined). dsRNA synthesis (using an Ambion MEGAscript
T7 High Yield Transcription Kit. Ambion, Austin, TX, US) and
larval injection were performed as described previously [27].
Larvae and pupae were documented using an Olympus SZX12
microscope with Nikon DXM 1200F digital camera. The same
exposure time (1/6 second) was used for all images.
