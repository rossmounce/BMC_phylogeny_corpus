Abstract
Background: The improvement of agricultural crops with regard to yield, resistance and environmental adaptation
is a perpetual challenge for both breeding and research. Exploration of the genetic potential and implementation
of genome-based breeding strategies for efficient rye (Secale cereale L.) cultivar improvement have been hampered
by the lack of genome sequence information. To overcome this limitation we sequenced the transcriptomes of five
winter rye inbred lines using Roche/454 GS FLX technology.
Results: More than 2.5 million reads were assembled into 115,400 contigs representing a comprehensive rye
expressed sequence tag (EST) resource. From sequence comparisons 5,234 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
were identified to develop the Rye5K high-throughput SNP genotyping array. Performance of the Rye5K SNP array
was investigated by genotyping 59 rye inbred lines including the five lines used for sequencing, and five barley,
three wheat, and two triticale accessions. A balanced distribution of allele frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 was
observed. Residual heterozygosity of the rye inbred lines varied from 4.0 to 20.4% with higher average
heterozygosity in the pollen compared to the seed parent pool.
Conclusions: The established sequence and molecular marker resources will improve and promote genetic and
genomic research as well as genome-based breeding in rye.

Background
The improvement of agricultural crops with regard to
yield, resistance and environmental adaptation is a perpetual challenge for both breeding and research. With
regard to prospected climate changes, improved tolerance against abiotic stresses like drought, low soil fertility, and extreme temperatures is required in crop
improvement. The outcrossing species rye shows the
highest freezing tolerance among small grain cereals [1]
and exhibits excellent tolerance against many biotic and
abiotic stresses. Understanding the functional genetic
basis of stress tolerance in rye will facilitate the
improvement of stress tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). As a genetic

research system, rye is intriguing due to its high genetic
variability. In addition to being an economically important crop for Middle and Eastern Europe, rye provides
valuable traits for other crops, as a parent of the amphiploid triticale, and as a donor of translocated chromosome segments in wheat [2]. Rye benefits from being
diploid and closely related to the more extensively characterized species wheat and barley. While reference
sequences of grass genomes have become available for
rice [3,4], sorghum [5], Brachypodium [6] and maize [7],
sequence information for rye is sparse which hampers
the exploitation of its genetic potential.
The haploid genome size of rye is more than 8 Gbp
[8] which is one of the largest among cereal crops. In
addition, 92% of the genome is composed of repetitive
sequences [9]. Genetic and genomic resources are limited compared to other Triticeae. Currently, 1,073,668
wheat and 501,620 barley ESTs are publicly available

whereas only 9,298 rye ESTs are deposited in public
databases http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/dbEST_summary.html (release 070111). Publicly available genomic resources for rye are restricted to one BAC library
[10], a limited number of genetic markers http://wheat.
pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml, and genetic maps with
low marker density [11-15].
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies such
as Illumina’s Genome Analyzer and Roche’s 454 sequencing platforms have opened the way to tackle sequencing of large genomes like those of barley and wheat
which would be impossible to address by Sanger
sequencing [16]. NGS platforms produce hundreds of
thousands of sequences in a massively parallel manner,
are cost and labour effective and were proven to be reliable and accurate. Several studies have highlighted the
success and usefulness of NGS for extending available
genomics resources by transcriptome [e.g. [17,18]] and
whole-genome [19] sequencing. Furthermore, NGS has
been used for gene expression profiling [20], analysis of
genome organisation [21], DNA methylation studies
[22], and molecular marker development [23], to name
few.
Given the large genome size and the lack of sequence
information and genomic resources in rye, identification
and targeted isolation of genes underlying agronomic
traits and understanding of gene function and trait variation is greatly hampered. The aim of the present study
was to promote rye genome analysis through massive
improvement of the public rye EST resource and development of the first high-throughput SNP genotyping
array.

Methods
Plant material, RNA and sequencing

Five winter rye inbred lines Lo7, Lo152, Lo225, P87, and
P105 were used for cDNA sequencing. Lo7, Lo152, and
Lo225 were provided by KWS LOCHOW GMBH (Bergen, Germany) and represent lines from the seed parent
and the pollen parent pool of the company’s hybrid rye
breeding program. P87 and P105 were developed at the
Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Minsk, Belarus, and
are parents of the mapping population P87 × P105 [24].
Inbred lines Lo7, Lo152, and Lo225 were generated by
six selfing generations, whereas P87 and P105 were
selfed seven and eight times, respectively. In addition,
54 proprietary inbred lines from the breeding material
of KWS LOCHOW GMBH, representing the two breeding pools were investigated. Lines from the pollen parent pool were generated by two to three selfing
generations, whereas lines from the seed parent pool
have undergone five selfing steps.
To capture a comprehensive part of the rye transcriptome 20 samples of total RNA per inbred line

Page 2 of 13

were obtained from a set of plant tissues harvested at
five developmental stages and after three stress treatments, respectively (Additional file 1). Three plants per
inbred line were pooled to obtain each of the 20 RNA
samples. For all non-stress treatments tissue samples
from leaves, stems and/or roots were harvested at
three- to four-leaf stage, tillering, stem extension,
heading and harvest ripe stage. Coleoptiles, florets,
early and mature spikes were harvested. To enrich
stress induced genes in the cDNA sample, cold stress,
dehydration shock, and nutrient-starvation stress treatments were applied in the three- to four-leaf stage.
Cold stress was induced by placing plants in a freezer
at -15°C. Root, stem and leaf tissues were harvested
after 1, 3, and 6 hours of stress treatment and pooled.
Dehydration shock experiments were conducted by
removing well-watered plants from soil and leaving
them on Whatman ® 3 MM paper (Whatman GmbH,
Dassel, Germany) at room temperature [25]. Root,
stem, and leaf tissues were harvested after 3, 6, and 12
hours of stress and pooled. Three plants per inbred
line were densely planted leading to nutrient-starvation
stress. Root and leaf tissues were harvested and pooled.
All tissue samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80°C until use. Total RNA was isolated
according to manufacturer’s instructions using the
NucleoSpin RNA Plant kit (#740949, Macherey-Nagel,
Düren, Germany) and quantified with the SPECTRONIC GENESYS™ 10 BIO spectrometer (Thermo
ELECTRON CORPORATION, Madison, USA).
Five micrograms of the 20 RNA samples of each
inbred line were pooled and 100 μg total RNA per
inbred line was sent for cDNA synthesis to vertis Biotechnology AG (Freising, Germany). Poly(A)+ RNA was
prepared from total RNA. First-strand cDNA synthesis
was primed with random hexanucleotide primers. Then
454 sequencing adapters A (5’-GCCTCCCTCGC
GCCATCAG-3’) and B (5’-CTGAGCGGGCTGGCA
AGGC-3’) were ligated to the 5’ and 3’ cDNA ends.
Finally, cDNAs were amplified in 20 (Lo152) and 21
(Lo7, Lo225, P87, P105) PCR cycles using a proof reading enzyme. Normalization was carried out by one cycle
of denaturation and reassociation of the cDNA. Reassociated ds-cDNA was separated from the ss-cDNA on
hydroxylapatite columns to obtain the normalized
cDNA samples. After hydroxylapatite chromatography,
the ss-cDNA samples were amplified in 8 PCR cycles.
The cDNA fraction in the size range of 600 to 800 bp
was eluted from preparative agarose gels. As a control,
aliquots of the fractionated cDNAs were analyzed on
1.5% agarose gels. Approximately 150 to 250 μg of the
normalized, adapter-ligated, and size selected cDNA
samples were used for GS FLX 454 sequencing. All 454
sequence raw data were submitted to the EBI sequence

De novo sequence assembly

Sequence comparisons

After 454 sequencing, raw sequence reads were passed
through quality filtering where cDNA synthesis primer
and sequencing adapter sequences were removed. After
pre-processing, cleaned and trimmed reads were subjected to inbred line-specific assemblies. Therefore, we
adapted the strategy of Kumar and Blaxter [26] for
assembling transcriptome data using multiple assembly
programs and combining the outcomes to create longer
contigs that are less likely to be in-silico artefacts
brought forth by a single algorithm. The strategy has
been modified to be applicable for various lines (Figure
1). We used three independent assemblers to achieve
most credible consensus contig sequences. Initially, all
reads from each of the five lines were assembled separately into first-order contigs with the programs CLC
assembly cell v3.20 http://www.clcbio.com, Mira v3.21
[27] and Newbler v2.5 [28]. While MIRA and Newbler
follow the overlap-consensus-layout paradigm (OLC),
CLC attempts to find paths in De Bruijn graphs. To
obtain line-specific assemblies, all first-order contigs
constructed by the three assemblers were merged using
the OLC assembler CAP3 [29]. We considered only
line-specific contigs whose constituents included firstorder contigs from all three assemblers. For EST
resource generation (Sce_Assembly03), we employed
CAP3 a second time to co-assemble the high confidence
line-specific contigs and denoted those supported by
constituents from more than one line as multi-line contigs, while contigs with evidence from only one line
were deemed single-line contigs. The assembly process
of Sce_Assembly03 has been accomplished with a
screening for potential DNA and foreign RNA contamination. We applied a BlastN against chloroplast genome
sequences of barley (GenBank: NC_008590) and wheat
(GenBank: NC_002762), mitochondrial genome
sequences of rice (GenBank: AP011077), sorghum (GenBank: DQ984518), and wheat (GenBank: GU985444),
and plastids genome sequences of Brachypodium (GenBank:EU325680), rice (GenBank: GU592207), sorghum
(GenBank: NC_008602), and wheat (GenBank:
AB042240). Further purity was gained by excluding hits
against CDS sequences of Acyrthosiphon pisum (GenBank: ACFK00000000), Buchnera aphidicola (GenBank:
AE013218), Fusarium graminearum (GenBank:
AACM00000000), and the draft sequence of Puccinia
triticina available at the Broad Institute. We discarded
contigs from the Sce_Assembly03 sequence set that
showed E-values larger than E-20 and the proposed best
hits representing at least 10% of the full contig size. The

Sequences between the five rye inbred lines potentially
differ to a degree that prevents the de novo assembly of
two lines. Blast [31] comparisons which do not require
strict sequence identity were carried out to analyze for
overlaps between the different assemblies. Line-specific
assemblies generated by CAP3 were used together with
the Sce_Assembly03 in an “all versus all” BlastN analysis. Each line-specific assembly as well as the multi-line
and single-line contigs of the Sce_Assembly03 were
used as both, subject and query sequences. The best
query hit to a subject sequence was counted to identify
homologs in the respective assemblies. Hits were considered significant when they exceeded a conservative cutoff value of > = 70% identity and 30 bp coverage.
Comparisons of the Sce_Assembly03 against the four
currently available protein databases of maize
[ZmB73_v5b.60, http://www.maizesequence.org], rice
[RAP2, [32]], sorghum [5], and Brachypodium [6], two
EST databases of barley and wheat (Barley assembly 35
and Wheat assembly WK, http://harvest.ucr.edu), and
two full length cDNA (flcDNA) library databases of barley [33] and wheat [34] were performed using BlastX
and tBlastX, respectively. Hits were only considered significant when they exceeded a conservative cut-off value
of > 70% identity and 30 bp coverage. To prevent hits
found based on low-complexity sequences or repeats the
Sce_Assembly03 was masked using RepeatMasker [35]
and the internal MIPS repeat database [36].
Genome-wide distribution of the Sce_Assembly03
contig sequences was investigated by chromosome-wise
BlastX analysis comparing multi-line and single-line
contigs with Brachypodium protein sequences. Sce_Assembly03 sequences were mapped onto the Brachypodium genome by using a sliding window approach with
a window size of 0.5 Mb and a shift of 0.1 Mb along the
Brachypodium chromosomes. The number of BlastX
hits and the percent bp coverage of the respective Brachypodium genes were determined. These density values
were corrected for the number of Ns per window, if the
N content exceeded 60% the value was set to zero. Density values were extrapolated to genes [6] or hits (rye)
per Mb to facilitate comparisons. To visualize the mapping results heatmaps were created from the density
values using the Python matplotlib module in combination with the jet colormap [37].
Functional gene annotation

The 115,400 sequences of the Sce_Assembly03 were
functionally annotated performing a Blast search with
Blast2GO default parameters against the non-redundant (nr) protein sequence database [38] after masking

Figure 1 Pipeline for the assembly procedure of Roche/454 sequence reads. After data generation [A], sequence (fasta), quality (qual) and
trace file information were extracted. Low quality regions, vector and adaptor sequences were removed from raw reads [B]. Preprocessing was
finished by subjecting trimmed reads to the line-specific assembly. For establishment of the SNP resource Sce_Assembly02 [C] only reads
assembled in contigs of line-specific assemblies were subjected to the merging process of the second assembly using Mira. For establishment of
the EST resource Sce_Assembly03 [D] assemblies were computed for each of the five lines separately with CLC assembly cell, Mira, and Newbler
and merged by CAP3 assembly. Consensus sequences of all lines were passed to a second CAP3 assembly combining sequences over multiple
lines. The resulting sequence set comprises contigs that were confirmed by consensus sequences from two to five lines (multi-line contigs) or
contigs that contain reads originating from one line (single-line contigs).

Gene ontology (GO) terms were assigned using

installed Blast2GO database. The annotation file was
extended by its respective GO category - biological
process, cellular component, and molecular function -

using a custom built Python script that is available
upon request.
SSR mining and SNP discovery

Simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs within 338,536
contigs of the line-specific assemblies were identified by

Haseneyer et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/131

MISA [39] under standard settings. Out of the five
inbred lines, Lo225 was selected as reference dataset as
it provided the highest number of SSR containing contigs. The MISA output of the four remaining lines was
cross-matched with the Lo225 dataset to detect redundant SSRs. A non-redundant SSR dataset was generated
by combining “unique” SSR motifs detected in Lo7,
Lo152, Lo225, P87, and P105. Mononucleotide repeat
motifs were discarded since monomer runs are known
to be the most frequent sequencing errors in Roche/454
data. For experimental validation of in silico detected
SSRs, primers flanking the SSR motifs were designed
using Primer3 [40]. Amplification of the fragments was
performed in Lo7, Lo225, P87, and P105 as they are the
parents of two mapping populations. Thus, polymorphisms detected between Lo7 and Lo225 and/or P87 and
P105 enable the genetic mapping of discovered SSRs.
PCR was conducted in a total volume of 20 μl, including
20 ng of genomic DNA, 1× HotStar Taq PCR buffer
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 250 nM of each primer, 200
μM dNTPs, and 0.5 U HotStar Taq DNA polymerase
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Using a touch-down PCR
profile, an initial denaturation step of 15 min at 95°C
was followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1
min, annealing for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1
min. Annealing temperature was decreased by 1°C per
cycle from 65°C to 55°C and was kept constant for 35
subsequent cycles. A final extension step was performed
at 72°C for 10 min. Successful amplification was
checked on 1.5% agarose gels.
For the discovery of SNPs in assembled sequences, a
second assembly strategy was pursued. Reads assembled
in line-specific contigs were selected from all reads and
subjected to an overall assembly, merging the extracted
reads of all five genotypes (Sce_Assembly02, Figure 1).
With this strategy information about nucleotide coverage is maintained which is important for reliable SNP
discovery. The Sce_Assembly02 is described in Additional file 2 and is available from the GABI primary
database http://www.gabipd.org. The workflow from in
silico SNP discovery in the Sce_Assembly02 to selection
of high confidence SNP candidates was a three-step procedure: First, the tool GigaBayes V0.4.1 [41] was applied
with parameter settings given in Additional file 3. Second, characteristics for discovered SNPs were extracted
by in-house implementations to compute defined selection criteria for candidate SNPs. Candidate SNPs were
filtered by these selection criteria to meet the following
requirements: SNPs should be bi-allelic and polymorphic between parents of the two mapping populations Lo7 × Lo225 and/or P87 × P105. For successful
probe design they should have a distance to homopolymeres > 5 bp, to the next Indel > 60 bp, and to the contig end > 60 bp. Third, filtered SNPs were manually

Page 5 of 13

inspected in the assembled sequences using EagleView
[42] to ensure high quality of the SNP genotyping array.
We considered putative sequencing errors, SNP position
in individual reads, and haplotype information. Oligoprobes for 5,234 SNP were designed and the Rye5K
array was produced by Illumina Inc. (San Diego, USA)
as Infinium iSelect HD Custom BeadChip. To demonstrate genome-wide coverage of the SNPs represented
on the genotyping array SNP containing contig
sequences were in silico mapped against the Brachypodium genome by BlastN analysis.
SNP array performance was assessed by analyzing 59
rye inbred lines including the five inbred lines used for
sequencing as well as accessions from barley (Barke,
Morex, OWB Dom, OWB Rec, Steptoe), wheat (Chinese
Spring, Dream, Mulgara), and triticale (Modus, breeding
line SaKa3006). A total of 300 ng genomic DNA per
plant was used for genotyping on the Illumina iScan
platform and the Infinium HD assay following manufacturer’s protocol. The fluorescence images of an array
matrix carrying Cy3- and Cy5-labeled beads were generated with the two-channel scanner. Raw hybridization
intensity data processing, clustering and genotype calling
(AA, AB, BB) were performed using the genotyping
module in the GenomeStudio software V2009.1 (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Genotype data were cleaned
through exclusion of all SNP assays with more than 5%
missing data. Frequencies of the A and B allele for a
given SNP were calculated directly by dividing the number of occurrences of one allele (AA + 1/2 AB or BB +
1/2 AB) by twice the number of assayed lines per SNP.
Residual heterozygosity of 59 inbred lines was calculated
by the relation of heterozygous SNPs (AB) to the number of assayed SNPs per inbred line. Significant deviation of the observed value from the expected value was
tested with an exact binomial test using R [43]. Genotyping data of the 10 non-rye accessions were analyzed
to investigate the applicability of the Rye5K SNP array
to other small grain cereals.

51,462 and 78,813 contig sequences per line-specific
assembly, summing up to 338,536 contigs (Additional
file 2). On average each nucleotide in the five line-specific assemblies was covered by 4.5 to 6.2 reads.
Consensus sequences created by multiple assembly
programs and merged by CAP3 were used to generate
the Sce_Assembly03 (Figure 1, Table 2). 89.0% of the
reads were assembled into contigs originating from two,
three, four, or five inbred lines (multi-line contigs) or
from one single inbred line (single-line contigs), respectively. The Sce_Assembly03 resulted in 115,400
sequences including 33,352 multi-line contigs (77.8% of
all reads) and 82,048 single-line contigs (11.1% of all
reads). 11.0% of all reads failed the quality criteria and
were removed from the assembly. The multi-line contig
sequence length ranged from 201 bp to 8,636 bp with a
L50 length of 1,070 bp. On average, each contig was
built from sixty reads in the multi-line contigs and three
reads in the single-line contigs.

(Table 3). This revealed 52.16% to 78.72% hits between
the line-specific assemblies. BlastN analysis of the line-specific assemblies against the multi-line contigs reached up
to 87.79% hits. Thus, as expected, a large overlap of represented genes between single-line assemblies can be concluded. However, the remaining 12.21% revealed either
pronounced sequence differences (highly polymorphic
genes/alleles) or genes that are represented (expressed) in
only one of the five rye inbred line samples.
The sequence homology between the line-specific
assemblies and the Sce_Assembly03 with the reference
genomes of Brachypodium, maize, rice, and sorghum,
and available flcDNA and EST collections from wheat
and barley, respectively, was investigated by (t)BlastX
comparisons (Figure 2). Most homologs were identified
in comparison to barley sequences, followed by Brachypodium, wheat, sorghum, maize and rice. Contig
sequences of the line-specific assemblies and multi-line
contigs of the Sce_Assembly03 showed a high homology
to the public sequence databases. Low homology was
detected for the single-line contigs of the Sce_Assembly03. This finding can be attributed to the sequence
length which is about two thirds shorter than that of
multi-line contigs (Table 2). Multi-line contigs of the
Sce_Assembly03 yielded more than 65% hits with either
barley or wheat flcDNA and HarvEST assemblies (data
not shown). Through tBlastX comparisons of the
Sce_Assembly03 against the genome sequences of Brachypodium, maize, sorghum, and rice we were able to
tag fragments from about 46.3%, 35.9%, 37.2% and
36.2% of the reference gene repertoires. From 33,352
multi-line and 82,048 single-line contigs 22,926 (68.7%)
and 23,406 (28.5%) revealed a hit to at least one of the
public grass sequence resources. The genes comprised
in the rye cDNA libraries indicated no bias for or
against a certain region of the rye genome when comparing the Sce_Assembly03 contig sequences to the Brachypodium genome (Additional file 4). The dense gene
content in the distal regions of the Brachypodium

Functional gene annotation

After masking repetitive sequences of the Sce_Assembly03 111,150 sequences (32,725 multi-line and 78,425
single-line contigs) remained for Blast2GO analysis. Out

of these sequences 49,294 revealed a hit against the nr
database and subsequently 35,356 (71.7%) unique rye
contig sequences (16,970 multi-line and 18,386 singleline contigs) were assigned to one or more GO annotations. In total 35,186, 38,280 and 51,950 GO terms were
obtained for biological processes, cellular components
and molecular functions, respectively (Additional file 5).

Across the three GO categories, 4,997 unique GO terms
were identified. More than 350 sequences in the
Sce_Assembly03 were related to biotic and abiotic stress
response (data not shown).
Marker discovery, SNP array design and high-throughput
genotyping
SSR marker development

Within the 338,536 contigs of the line-specific assemblies
a fraction of 12,317 (3.6%) contigs contained SSR motifs.
Primer sequences could be designed for 5,230 of these
contigs. Restriction to di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- or hexanucleotide motifs reduced the number of SSR candidates
to 3,799. Cross-match analysis filtered a final SSR dataset
comprising 1,385 unique, non-redundant SSRs (Additional file 6). A random subset of 155 SSRs was chosen
for experimental validation by PCR amplification of the
four parental genotypes Lo7, Lo225, P87, and P105. 146
primer pairs (94%) immediately amplified fragments of
expected size without further optimization of PCR conditions. Twelve primer combinations produced fragments
larger than expected indicating the presence of introns.
These were excluded from further analyses. Finally, 61
(46%) out of 134 PCR products with expected fragment
size revealed naked-eye polymorphisms on agarose gels
between either P87 and P105 (29) or Lo7 and Lo225 (37).
SNP discovery

SNP discovery requires sufficient coverage with high
quality sequence reads in order to allow for distinguishing true SNPs from sequencing errors. Therefore, the
assembly Sce_Assembly02 was performed that excluded
singletons from the line-specific assemblies when merging sequences of the five inbred lines. Overall 277,033
putative polymorphisms in 138,339 contigs cumulating
55 Mb consensus sequences were identified in a first
data mining step using GigaBayes. The number of SNP
candidates was reduced to 17,917 by filtering those
SNPs that fulfilled the selection criteria and quality
requirements such as bi-allelic and polymorphic
between parents of the two mapping populations Lo7 ×
Lo225 and/or P87 × P105, distance to homopolymeres >
5 bp, distance to the next Indel > 60 bp, and distance to
the contig end > 60 bp. Subsequent manual inspection
in the Sce_Assembly02 reduced the dataset to 5,211
SNP candidates from 3,961 contigs. This dataset
together with additional 23 SNPs discovered in nonpublic rye sequences was used for the design and production of the Rye5K SNP genotyping array. Out of the
3,961 unique contigs, 2,835 contigs (71.6%) were in
silico mapped to the Brachypodium genome. The contigs were evenly distributed with 826, 641, 688, 416, and
262 hits on chromosomes Bd1 to 5, respectively (Additional file 4). Blast2GO analysis of 3,961 contig
sequences represented on the Rye5K array assigned

Page 8 of 13

2,096 sequences with associated GO identifiers (Additional file 7).
Application of the Rye5K SNP array

The performance of the Rye5K SNP array was tested on
the five inbred lines selected for RNA-seq, 54 additional
rye inbred lines, and 10 non-rye accessions. Out of the
5,234 SNPs, 4,557 (87%) generated signals and between
2,970 (57%) and 3,148 (60%) were successfully called for
the 59 rye inbred lines representing the hybrid rye seed
parent and pollen parent pools (Table 4 Additional file
8). Based on genotyping results for the five inbred lines
used for SNP discovery, 3% of the in silico detected
SNPs turned out to be false positives. Allele frequencies
in rye were evenly distributed from 0.1 to 0.9 (Figure 3).
A small proportion of 12.3% called SNPs turned out to
be monomorphic in the independent set of 54 inbred
lines not used for SNP discovery with slightly increasing
values when looking separately at the pollen parent
(15.7%) and the seed parent (13.7%) pools.
Genotyping data were used to calculate the observed
residual heterozygosity of the rye inbred lines. The
observed percentage of heterozygous loci for each line
varied between 4.1 and 4.8% in the five rye inbred lines
used for 454 sequencing and between 4.0 to 20.4% in
the 54 inbred lines from the two heterotic breeding
pools. On average, a higher level of residual heterozygosity was observed for the pollen parent pool (11.5%)
than for the seed parent pool (5.5%).
Applicability of the Rye5K SNP array to other small
grain cereals was investigated. Out of the 4,557 SNP assays
that generated a signal in rye, 63.0% (2,871), 75.8% (3,452),
and 84.1% (3,831) could be scored in barley, wheat, and
triticale, respectively. However, 86.7, 91.6, and 76.5% of
the scored SNPs did not show a polymorphism between
the investigated barley, wheat, and triticale accessions.

Figure 3 Distribution of allele frequencies for evaluable SNPs on the Rye5K SNP array. Allele frequencies observed in total and separately

SSRs, more than 5,000 SNPs, and the Rye5K SNP array
for large-scale genotyping. NGS was used to generate
transcriptome sequences of the five rye inbred lines Lo7,
Lo152, Lo225, P87, and P105. The number of reads per
sequencing run of the present study was in line or even
surpassed results obtained in other studies [17,23,44].
Due to the massive number of 2.5 Mio read sequences
obtained by 454 sequencing the de novo assembly of
such datasets remains a computational and bioinformatic challenge. Two purpose-oriented assembly strategies were followed in order to first provide a
comprehensive EST resource and second enable discovery of polymorphisms between inbred lines. A second
assembly on top of the five line-specific assemblies
reduced the possibility of creating chimeric artefacts in
the Sce_Assembly03. In addition, sequence redundancy
introduced by variations between lines is removed. This
was achieved by bringing together related sequences
while accepting line specific nucleotide differences. In
contrast this fact was essential for SNP detection, where
only reads that were pre-assembled in line-specific contigs were subjected to the Sce_Assembly02. Thus, information about allele coverage at the SNP position was
retained which increased the reliability of SNP candidates. A challenge in our study was the detection of
SNPs without a reference sequence. Many SNP

detection tools such as GMAP [45] or MAQ [46] are
only applicable to de novo assemblies that are aligned to
a reference sequence. This was a strong challenge in our
approach and much effort was invested in the detection
of high confidence SNPs. Manual inspection of SNP
candidates in more than 10,000 contigs indicated that
many sequencing errors occurred in the beginning of
read sequences which, as a consequence, lead to false
positives. Exclusion of SNP candidates detected in such
regions of read sequences might reduce the false positive rate and improve automated tools that detect polymorphisms in de novo assembled sequence data without
a reference sequence.
Genome sequencing has progressed rapidly in model
plants. Given the increased sequencing throughput and
the decreasing costs, NGS technologies pave the way for
sequencing even large genomes [47-49]. Although of
major importance for research and breeding, sequence
resources for rye were sparse imposing serious limitations for trait mapping, association studies, and functional genomics in rye. Rye is of interest especially for
Middle and Eastern European economic markets due to
its high tolerance to abiotic stresses. As a first step
towards deciphering the rye genome we aimed to
sequence a large portion of the rye transcriptome. To
achieve this we first sampled RNA from plants under

Haseneyer et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/131

various stress conditions, different plant tissues and
developmental stages. Rye-specific sequences e.g. related
to stress tolerance were generated in the present study
which are indispensable for functional genomic studies
in rye. Second, we reduced the complexity of the transcriptome by cDNA normalization prior to sequencing.
cDNA normalization lead to a significant increase in
transcriptome sequencing efficiency by equalizing the
representation of high, medium and rarely expressed
transcripts in the cDNA population [50-52]. Since many
transcripts are temporally and/or spatially expressed
during plant development, RNA pooled from different
tissues at different developmental stages ensured the
coverage of temporal- and spatial-specific transcripts.
Linking rye to grass genome sequence resources

To assess, how much of the rye transcriptome is represented by the established EST resource, we compared
the Sce_Assembly03 sequences to currently available
grass genome, flcDNA, and EST sequences. Generally,
the number of sequences with significant BlastX hit in
public databases was higher for multi-line contigs than
for single-line contigs. This finding is in line with results
of Schafleitner et al. [53] who compared EST sequences
of sweet potato (Ipomea batatas) with sequences contained in the UniRef100 protein database.
The overall gene content across the grass subfamilies
Ehrhartoideae (rice), Panicoideae (maize, sorghum), and
Pooideae [6] is in a similar range. A total of 25,532 protein coding gene loci were found for Brachypodium [6]
which is in line with rice [RAP2, 28,236 protein coding
gene loci, [32]], maize [ZmB73_v5b.60, 39,656 protein
coding loci, [7]], and sorghum [v1.4, 27,640 protein coding gene loci, [5]]. Due to a close evolutionary relationship with these model genomes a pronounced overlap
with rye transcripts was expected. The comparison of
the Sce_Assembly03 against flcDNA, EST, and genomic
sequences revealed a higher homology to barley, Brachypodium, and wheat than to maize, rice, and sorghum
which was expected, as rye is phylogenetically more closely related to other members of the Pooideae than to
maize, rice, and sorghum [54,55]. The GO annotation
analysis reveals that a broad spectrum of genes was
sampled in our normalized cDNA pool from multiple
tissues and developmental stages. The large number of
reads generated by 454 sequencing entails a substantial
gain at the level of gene discovery which provides a
valuable resource for forward and reverse genetics
approaches in rye as well as for comparative gene analyses. A significant fraction of multi-line contigs (31%)
gave no hits with the public grass sequence resources.
In part this finding can be attributed to species specific
and tribe specific genes and gene families. The Pooideae
contain 265 subfamily-specific gene families leading to

Page 10 of 13

subfamily-specific Blast hits [6]. Given our stringent
BlastX/tBlastX cut-off value of > 70% sequence identity,
non-conserved and non-coding sequences such as 3’- or
5’- untranslated regions and non-coding RNAs are
assumed to contribute to the fraction that lacks homology with other grass species. Around 2% of all rye 454
reads revealed hits to the MIPS Repeat Element database [36], suggesting that transcriptional activity of retrotransposons contributed to the sampled RNA pool.
Transcriptome sequencing in two rice subspecies
detected alternative splicing patterns in about half of the
rice genes and more than 15,000 novel transcriptional
active regions of which more than half had no homolog
in public protein data [56]. This might suggest that the
rye EST resource contains rare, tissue-specific and/or
stress-related transcripts that are not represented in
sequence resources of the closely related species wheat
and barley despite their extensive EST resources. It is
anticipated that rye transcriptome sequence analysis will
greatly benefit from a reference genome sequence for a
member of the Triticeae family. Whole genome sequencing is in progress for barley [49,57] and wheat [58] and
exploratory BAC end sequencing of rye 1RS-specific
BAC libraries [59] has been reported. In silico mapping
of rye ESTs to the model genome of Brachypodium
revealed an even distribution of rye transcripts when
anchored to their Brachypodium homologs. The large
extent of synteny between grass genomes will facilitate
the construction of a virtual gene map of rye representing the ancestral gene scaffold. Genetic mapping of the
SNPs represented on the Rye5K array and of SSRs
developed from our rye ESTs is underway and will lead
to fine-scale comparative maps between rye and other
grasses. A fully annotated genome sequence for rye is
still out of reach due to the complexity and highly repetitive nature of the rye genome. However, with the tools
established in our study, rye catches up with other grass
genome resources and a far more detailed glimpse into
the rye genome and its evolution will be possible.
Molecular toolbox for rye

Sequence information of the five rye inbred lines was
used to detect sequence variation that was transferred
into more than 1,300 SSRs and about 5,000 SNPs. Molecular markers have been developed for a range of crop
species and play an essential role in modern plant
breeding. They have been used to monitor DNA
sequence diversity within and among species, to identify
genes responsible for desired traits, to disclose sources
of genetic variation that allow for the production of new
varieties by introducing favorable traits from landraces
and related grass species, and to manage backcrossing
programs [60]. Together with amplified fragment length
polymorphisms (AFLPs), SSRs are currently the most

Haseneyer et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/131

popular marker system in cereals. They have been developed for major crop plants including cereals and when
applied in breeding programs this marker system is predicted to lead to accelerated progress [61]. Currently,
the availability of public rye SSRs is very limited. Our
resource significantly increases this marker resource that
might facilitate the assessment of genetic variability and
the estimation of genetic distances between populations.
Besides SSRs the marker system receiving the greatest
attention nowadays are SNPs [62]. SNPs have shown
huge potential in highly efficient fingerprinting, genetic
map construction, marker assisted selection as well as
population and evolutionary genetics. The Rye5K SNP
array provides a powerful new resource for large-scale
genotyping in molecular and genome-centric research in
rye. Recently whole-genome genotyping arrays became
available for crops and livestock and are used for genome-wide association studies and to investigate genetic
variation [e.g. [63]]. In a pilot experiment, we analyzed
59 rye inbred lines including the five lines used for
sequencing with the Rye5K SNP array to estimate the
degree of residual heterozygosity. Theoretical expectation after two, three or six cycles of selfing is about
12.5%, 6.3%, and 1.6%, respectively. Genotyping of these
59 lines using the Rye5K array showed that the degree
of heterozygosity significantly (p-value < 0.05) exceeds
this theoretical expectation. This might be in part
explained by the allogamous behaviour of rye resulting
in remaining heterozygosity [64]. Despite forced selfing
during inbred line production some degree of cross-pollination cannot be excluded as the seed was produced as
single-ear progenies in a commercial breeding program.
The lower levels of residual heterozygosity observed for
the seed parent pool is in agreement with the higher
advanced selfing generations in rye seed parent lines (P.
Wilde, personal communication). A detailed analysis of
sequences that remained heterozygous indicated
sequences belonging to large gene families, such as
transferases and hydroxylases. Detection of SNPs in
paralogs or members of gene families may mimic a substantial part of the detected heterozygosity, thus leading
to an overestimation of the true remaining heterozygosity in the rye inbred lines.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the Sce_Assembly03 provides a new and
comprehensive EST resource that integrates rye in the
comparative analysis between small grain cereals. The
Rye5K SNP array allows the analysis of large sets of individuals to obtain genotyping data for association studies,
estimating linkage disequilibrium, and population genetic
approaches. Our genomic resources comprise 115,400
EST sequences, 1,385 SSRs, more than 5,000 SNPs, and
the Rye5K SNP array for large-scale genotyping that will

improve and promote genetic and genomic research as
well as genome-based breeding in rye.

each rye inbred line was extracted from plant tissues exposed to various

Additional file 2: Establishment and description of the
Sce_Assembly02 generated for in silico SNP mining. The
Sce_Assembly02 was performed in three steps using the MIRA assembler
V2.9 on integrated standard settings: Firstly, raw sequence reads
surpassed a quality filtering process where 454 sequencing adapter and
cDNA synthesis primer sequences as well as low quality reads were
removed. Secondly, the cleaned and trimmed sequence reads were
subjected to a line-specific assembly where reads of each inbred line
were aligned in a separate assembly run. Non-aligned reads in the linespecific assemblies, i.e. singletons, were rejected. Thirdly, those reads that
merged into contigs in the line-specific assemblies were moved further
to the Sce_Assembly02 starting again with the cleaned and trimmed
reads, but now from all five inbred lines. This strategy resulted in contig
sequences that were used for SNP detection and subsequently for the
design of the high-throughput genotyping SNP array. With regard to
SNP discovery this assembly allowed the deduction of critical information
about the SNP position like allele coverage.

inbred lines (from top to bottom) by going along the Brachypodium
chromosomes in a sliding window with 0.5 Mb window size and a 0.1

coverage of the respective tagged genes. The density values were
corrected for the number of Ns per window, if the N content exceeded
60% the value was set to zero and drawn in white color. The number
was extrapolated to number per Mb to facilitate comparisons. The
heatmaps were created from density values using the Python pylab
module in combination with the jet colormap (low to high values from
