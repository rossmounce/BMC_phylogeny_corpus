Background

to several dozen genes, which are dispersed among many
chromosomes [4,5]. Although the number of clusters is similar among species, the typical cluster size varies significantly
because of extensive lineage-specific evolutionary events (for
example, inter- and intra-chromosomal gene duplications
and genomic deletions) [3,6-8].

information

Olfactory receptor (OR) genes constitute the largest superfamily in the vertebrate genome, with several hundred genes
per species [1-3]. This large repertoire of receptors mediates
the sense of smell through the recognition of diverse volatile
molecules, used to detect food, predators, and mates. Mammalian OR genes reside in about 50 genomic clusters of one

interactions

Conclusion: The identified multi-species CLICs demonstrate that most of the mammalian OR
clusters have a common ancestry, preceding the split between marsupials and placental mammals.
However, only two of these CLICs were capable of incorporating chicken OR genes,
parsimoniously implying that all other CLICs emerged subsequent to the avian-mammalian
divergence.

refereed research

Results: We developed a new and general tool for genome-wide definition of genomic gene
clusters conserved in multiple species. Syntenic orthologs, defined as gene pairs showing
conservation of both genomic location and coding sequence, were subjected to a graph theory
algorithm for discovering CLICs (clusters in conservation). When applied to ORs in five mammals,
including the marsupial opossum, more than 90% of the OR genes were found within a framework
of 48 multi-species CLICs, invoking a general conservation of gene order and composition. A
detailed analysis of individual CLICs revealed multiple differences among species, interpretable
through species-specific genomic rearrangements and reflecting complex mammalian evolutionary
dynamics. One significant instance involves CLIC #1, which lacks a human member, implying the
human-specific deletion of an OR cluster, whose mouse counterpart has been tentatively
associated with isovaleric acid odorant detection.

deposited research

Background: Mammalian olfactory receptor (OR) genes reside in numerous genomic clusters of
up to several dozen genes. Whole-genome sequence alignment nets of five mammals allow their
comprehensive comparison, aimed at reconstructing the ancestral olfactory subgenome.

Aloni et al.

Comparative analysis of mammalian OR clusters is crucial for
deciphering the common evolutionary origins of the OR repertoires, as well as for highlighting inter-species differences.
Large-scale comparisons have mapped most pairwise relations among human and mouse clusters based on sequence
similarity between individual genes [9]. A similar study also
revealed that, in most cases, pairs of OR clusters that exhibit
human-mouse similarity fall into established synteny blocks,
which indicates their common origin [10]. Clusters with similarity that did not share synteny relationship were attributed
to inter-chromosomal duplication events. Similarly, the combination of synteny data and sequence similarity has been
used to map between the majority of human and dog clusters,
indicating their common origin [11]. Thirteen dog clusters
that could not be mapped were suggested to be 'dog specific'.
A highly relevant endeavor is the recent establishment of a
comprehensive network of whole-genome pairwise alignment
chains, bridging between local sequence similarity and global
synteny mapping, thus providing a better resolution for
genome-wide comparisons [12]. Because this system currently includes all complete mammalian genomes published
so far, including the marsupial opossum (Monodelphis
domestica), it has the potential to assist greatly in conducting
a comprehensive multi-species comparison of mammalian
OR clusters. Here, we used this powerful framework to establish relationships among mammalian OR clusters on a
genome-wide basis. This allowed us to reconstruct a parsimonious scenario for the evolution of gene clusters in the mammalian olfactory subgenome, and to reconstruct a putative
OR cluster architecture of the common ancestor of five mammals, spanning nearly 200 million years of phylogeny.

Results
OR genomic mining in opossum and dog
For the OR gene repertoire of the opossum Monodelphis
domestica, we mined a total of 1,518 ORs (the nucleotide and
protein sequences are available in Additional data files 9 and
10) from the Opossum October 2004 assembly (monDom1).
This was achieved using previous computational methodologies, as described previously [3,13]. Because the opossum
genome has not been assembled to the chromosome level, the
sequence coordinates were referred to genomic scaffolds. The
assembly used consisted of scaffolds with average length of
about 4.5 megabases (Mb), ensuring inclusion of whole OR
clusters or substantial parts thereof in most cases.
Our previously reported canine OR repertoire [14] was a
result of combining directed DNA sequencing of the beagle
genome and data mining of Celera's 1× poodle genome, and it
contained 997 ORs sequences without genomic location. For
the purposes of the present study, we re-established the repertoire from the July 2004 assembly of the boxer breed
(canFam1). We applied BLAT (BLAST [Basic Local Alignment

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/10/R88

Search Tool]-Like Alignment Tool) and other procedures as
described previously [13], using the published canine ORs as
queries. The new dataset obtained included 922 ORs (the
nucleotide and protein sequences are available in Additional
data files 11 and 12). The two repertoires were compared
using Sequencher (version 4.2 for PC; GeneCodes Corp., Ann
Arbor, Michigan, USA) with a 97% identity threshold to yield
an overlap set of 765 ORs. The main reason why 189 of the
poodle ORs failed to overlap the boxer genome is low
sequence quality, mainly at the ends of the unmatched poodle
ORs. The 209 ORs found in the new mining effort were classified into families and subfamilies and were assigned an
appropriate symbol, using the nomenclature system of
HORDE (Human Olfactory Receptor Data Exploratorium)
[13]. The opossum and dog OR sequences are available in the
HORDE database [15] and in Additional data files 9, 10, 11, 12.

Identification of clusters in conservation
We aimed to produce a systematic depiction of the relationships among OR clusters of five mammalian species. For that
we developed a three-step algorithm to identify CLICs (CLusters In Conservation), the multi-species equivalent of a
genomic cluster. This algorithm progressed from the intraspecies identification of genomic clusters, through the pairwise comparison of individual ORs from different species, to
integration in the multi-species framework of CLICs.
In the first step, we defined OR clusters in all five species,
based on a selected maximal intergenic distance of 300 kilobases (kb). This resulted in the definition of 48 ± 5 (mean ±
standard deviation) clusters with two or more ORs and 24 ±
9 singletons in the four placental mammals (Table 1). For
opossum, the numbers were considerably greater, presumably because the fragmented genome assembly in this species
(Table 1).
The second step was focused on relationships stemming from
the UCSC (University of California at Santa Cruz) alignment
net for 12 species pairs [12]. This net is a whole-genome pairwise alignment protocol that provides the best match to every
position in the genome, according to both local sequence similarity and global genomic context. Of 5,969 ORs in five species, 5,305 (89%) were found to match an OR in an alignment
net with at least one other species (Table 2). A small fraction
(3.5%) of alignment pair events were between an OR and a
genomic sequence not hitherto defined as an OR gene (see the
legend to Table 2). The aligned ORs are shown in Figure 1 in
a genomic position context, in which each panel shows a
whole genome comparison of two species. The visible contiguous diagonal arrays of OR genes, often spanning considerable genomic segments, provide evidence for the conservation
and syntenic organization of OR clusters in different mammals. Synteny often extends beyond the OR clusters, whereby
the relevant alignment chain contained non-OR genes as well.
For example, this was found to be true by manual examination for 30 out of all 33 human versus mouse chains.

The inter-species OR alignment pairs were filtered to highlight ORs with high confidence of orthology, defined here as
'syntenic orthologs', which correspond to well defined synteny blocks in addition to high mutual sequence identity. The
final subset of syntenic orthologs contained OR pairs that
belong to alignment chains longer than 100 kb and showing
sequence identity higher than a 72% cutoff. Approximately
56% of all ORs (and 71% of the eutherian ORs) were included
in the syntenic orthologs category.

interactions

Finally, in the third step, CLICs were defined as connected
components in an OR graph. A CLIC is thus a set that includes
all OR clusters from different genomes, within which every
cluster is connected by at least one syntenic orthology edge to

at least one other cluster. Whenever several genes from the
same species were aligned to a single gene in another species,
and were defined as its syntenic orthologs, they were all
included in the same CLIC.
The foregoing analysis divided the examined mammalian OR
repertoire into 251 mutually exclusive CLICs (Figure 2a,b,
and Additional data file 1, with sample data in Table 3). Of
these, 48 CLICs contained clusters from more than one species (multi-species CLICs), with most of them containing
representations from all five mammals, or at least the four
placental mammals. The multi-species CLICs encompassed
90% of the combined mammalian OR repertoire (Figure 2c).

of 20 possible comparisons between five species, only 12 are available at the UCSC alignment net [56]. A pairwise comparison is directed from
a reference genome to a target genome, and is thus not symmetric. bWe filtered out alignments between an OR to a genomic segment that was
mapped to 'chrUn' or 'random' (approximately 1% of all alignment pairs), was split between two separated genomic locations (approximately 7%), or
did not overlap with any annotated OR from the collection described in Table 1 (approximately 3.5%). However, the overlooked segments may

The number of genes from each species in a given CLIC varied
considerably (Figure 3). Attempting to obtain an overview on
cluster sizes in the different species, we preformed an analysis
that focused on larger CLICs. This was done to filter noise
stemming from small number statistics. Considering CLICs
with at least 15 human genes (containing 80% of all genes in
multispecies CLICs), human and dog had a similar gene
number in a given CLIC, whereas mouse and rat had a larger
number (typically 1.5-fold higher). Thus, the observed interspecies variation in repertoire size (Table 1) cannot be
explained by the number of clusters but rather by increased
cluster size. This is in accordance with previous results
[10,16].

Inter-chromosomal cluster dispersion is observed for CLIC
#31 (Figure 3c). It contains one OR cluster from every species
except dog, whereas dog is represented by four clusters. Two
of the dog clusters belong to two different human-dog synteny
blocks, with the breakpoint located at the middle of the
human OR cluster. For the two other clusters there is no conserved synteny beyond the stretch of OR genes. These
inferred novel OR locations in the dog genome could be created by an inter-chromosomal cluster duplication, or by
movement of part of the cluster. In addition, four dog-specific
CLICs (#113, #115, #116, and #123; see Additional data file 1)
with a similar subfamily composition (belonging to the OR6
and/or OR9 families) might also have been created by a partial cluster duplication originating in CLIC #31. However,
these CLICs belonged to short local alignments, and therefore
were not integrated into CLIC #31. Family OR6 has greatly
expanded in the rat lineage too, in this case within a single
cluster assigned to CLIC #31 (Figure 3c).

reports

A single species CLIC may represent a cluster that was not
present in the inferred common ancestor, but was introduced
more recently into a particular lineage. Although larger
genomic clusters were usually assigned to multi-species
CLICs, singleton ORs and small clusters often appeared as
single species CLICs (Figure 2d).

3b). We performed a BLAST search of the mouse OR protein
sequences of this CLIC against the human repertoire, but the
matches were of low sequence similarity (around 50% identity), supporting the absence of any human orthologs. This
human-specific deletion of an OR cluster is intriguing
because in mouse the relevant OR cluster on chromosome 4
was tentatively associated with the capacity to smell isovaleric
acid [17,18], an odorant that many (but not all) humans can
detect [19].

conservation of the cluster configurations, and lead to the
inference that many of the OR clusters were present in the
evolutionary common mammalian ancestor(s). As a caveat,
we note that our analyses, based on large-scale genome alignments, are sensitive to cases of incompleteness of genome
assembly.

Conservation of synteny of OR genes
Conservation of synteny of OR genes. (a) All ORs from each species are ordered along the axis according to their genomic location from chromosome 1
to X (or by scaffold number in the case of the opossum), and by the internal megabase coordinates in each chromosome. Each point represents an
alignment between two ORs from different species in the UCSC alignment net, colored according to the degree of DNA sequence identity (x-axis for the
reference species, y-axis for the target species). Diagonals in both directions represent conservation of gene order, whereas reverse diagonals indicate a
reverse of gene order relative to the 'plus' DNA strand. Off-diagonal points generally indicate micro-rearrangements, but those that are associated with
low percentage identity possibly represent alignment errors. (b) Zoomed human versus mouse comparison, with chain numbers (by UCSC hg17 versus

Amadou and coworkers [26]). Chains #375 and #118 capture a genomic inversion. OR, olfactory receptor.

Cluster deletion is evident for CLIC #1, which contains one
conserved OR cluster in all mammals except human (Figure
3b). A human-specific cluster deletion appears to be the best
explanation, because otherwise there is a clear synteny relationship in this region for all five species examined (Figure

Another example of cluster duplication is CLIC #32, which
contains two clusters from each of the nonhuman species,
whereas in human there are three clusters, two of which
(chr14@19.5, chr15@19.8) are highly similar to each other
(Figure 3d). This CLIC appears to capture a recent event of
cluster duplication in the human lineage, as previously suggested, based on a similarity in the subfamily content [3].
Indeed, all members of the two human clusters showed at
least 90% mutual protein identity, which is a very high score.
In parallel, the best mouse hits for most members of the two
human clusters were found in a single mouse cluster
(chr14@45.4). These results further support evidence of cluster duplication in human lineage.

interactions

The definition of CLICs generates a common framework,
within which species-specific evolution of OR clusters can be
analyzed (Figure 3). A close examination of the CLICs reveals
events such as cluster duplication, cluster deletion, and cluster splitting. The relevant evolutionary scenarios include unitary events (for instance, a genomic deletion in a single
lineage) as well as complex events that occurred along more
than one lineage. Nevertheless, absence of a CLIC from a
genome may result from an assembly problem; this is particularly relevant to the opossum genome.

still belong to one CLIC (Figure 3d). This is consistent with
the notion that the two clusters were originally on the same
ancestral chromosome, as is indeed the case for human chromosomes 14 and 15 [20]. Chromosomal translocation was
suggested to be a possible mechanism for fragmentation of a
single genomic cluster into smaller clusters, whose ORs are
from a common phylogenetic subfamily [21].

ancestor genome. However, we cannot rule out the possibility
that a single species CLIC existed in the ancestral genome but

aThe CLICs are ordered according to genomic order in the human genome. For CLICs that do not contain human clusters, the human location that is
syntenic to the region of the mouse OR cluster was considered (according to UCSC mm6 versus hg17 alignment net [56]). Only multi-species CLICs
with at least five human genes are shown, in addition to CLIC #1, which is discussed in the text. The complete list of 251 CLICs appear in Additional

Aloni et al.

Among the 42 multispecies CLICs, 26 were common also with
opossum and were inferred to represent ancestral clusters in
the last common ancestor of eutherians and marsupials. Less
than one quarter of the opossum OR clusters (36 out of 163)
were integrated into multispecies CLICs, as compared with
74% of all eutherian clusters (212 out of 288). In order to
examine the likelihood of an ancestral origin of the remaining
opossum clusters, we examined the opossum clusters disregarding the previously employed CLIC definition constraints.
Most of the opossum-specific CLICs (96 out of 127) were not
found at all on the opossum-human or opossum-mouse alignment nets. These CLICs contained 232 ORs (out of a total
1,518 ORs in opossum), and ranged in size from 1 to 37 genes
(Additional data file 1). At least 54 ORs of this group belonged
to a unique expansion in the opossum genome, which exhibited low sequence similarity to eutherian genes (an average of
48% identity at the protein level). The other ORs belonged to
OR subfamilies shared with eutherians, which were probably
excluded from the alignment net because they were too divergent at the DNA level or because of assembly artifacts.
Indeed, two-thirds of these scaffolds were less than 100 kb
long. We found that 91% of the entire opossum genome is
included in human-opossum alignment chains larger than
100 kb [22]. This is in good agreement with our finding that
1,340 out of 1,518 ORs (88.2%) are included in multi-species
CLICs.
Each of the 31 remaining opossum-specific CLICs was
merged with a predefined multi-species CLIC, which contained the gene with the highest sequence similarity in the
human-mouse alignment net. No minimum sequence identity or chain length was required. As a result, the additional
opossum clusters joined 20 multispecies CLICs; 13 of the target CLICs were devoid of opossum cluster beforehand (dAdditional data file 1). Although this procedure may lead to the
inclusion of false positives, the finding still provides evidence
suggesting an early mammalian origin of 38 out of the 42
inferred ancestral clusters, and suggests that four CLICs (#14,
#17, #39, and #42) are eutherian specific. However, the latter
conclusion should be taken with caution, given the incomplete disposition of the opossum genome assembly.
For each of the 42 inferred ancestral clusters, an ancestral
gene count was estimated, using a simple statistic derived
from the cluster size distribution of the corresponding CLIC
(Table 3). We note that assessing the number of genes in
ancestral clusters is problematic, because contemporary clusters reflect an ongoing process of gene duplication and deletion, not necessarily at the same rate. With this caveat, it
appears that the mammalian ancestor had approximately
1070 OR genes. Of these, 38% were disposed in two large
clusters of more than 100 genes (CLIC #23 and CLIC #26),
59% in medium size clusters of 7-44 genes, and the remaining
3% being in small clusters of one to six genes. It is also possible, with appropriate caution, to reconstruct the internal
organization of the ancestral clusters (Figure 4 and

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/10/R88

Additional data file 4). Such reconstruction indicates signatures of lineage-specific genomic reorganization, including
tandem duplication of individual OR genes, inversions, insertions, and deletions.

Chicken-mammal conservation
The chicken OR repertoire was found to contain 554 genes, of
which 476 (86%) were pseudogenized and only 78 had intact
open reading frames [7,23]. The chicken OR repertoire was
highly restricted, with 75% of the genes belonging to a single
family (a newly defined family OR14; Olender T and coworkers, unpublished data). Only 8% of the chicken ORs were
assigned a genomic location, even though 90% of the total
chicken genomic sequence was contained within assembled
chromosomes [7]. The failure of the majority of the chicken
ORs to undergo whole-genome shotgun assembly probably
stems from their high mutual sequence similarity.
The CLIC-defining algorithm was applied to the chicken OR
gene repertoire. The cutoff of chain length was lowered to 50
kb, and no sequence similarity cutoff was used beyond the
maximal expectation value embedded in the alignment chain
definition. Only two chicken clusters (with a total of 13 OR
genes) could be joined to the previously defined mammalian
CLICs (Figure 3a and Additional data file 5). Most of the
remaining chicken ORs, including those missing a genomic
location, could not be aligned beyond the OR coding region.
Half of them were included in chains of 1,000-50,000 base
pairs (bp) long, and hence they had the potential to contain an
entire 1 kb OR coding region (Additional data file 6). This
finding is perhaps unsurprising, given that most of the
chicken ORs belong to chicken-specific expansion.
The largest chicken cluster, with 12 class I ORs (including
four pseudogenes), belonged to CLIC #23 (Additional data
file 5), and was included in an alignment chain that spanned
285 kb on chicken chromosome 1 and 2,500 kb on human
chromosome 11 (with 103 human ORs). This chain also contained the syntenic β-globin cluster, with four chicken β-globins as compared with five human genes [24,25]. The second
match between chicken and mammalian clusters was in CLIC
#16, which contained a single OR from chicken chromosome
1 (belonging to subfamily OR10AC) aligned to human
OR10AC1P on chromosome 7 (Additional data file 5). The
human genomic region, related to the relevant alignment
chain, contained six human OR genes (included in CLIC #16)
and five bitter taste receptor genes. Of these, only one OR
(OR1AC1P) and one taste receptor (TAS2R49) appeared in
the human-chicken alignment net, indicating their conserved
synteny. In addition, this chain included two conserved
ephrin receptors (EPHB6 and EPHA1).

Discussion

The identification of orthology relationships among OR genes
has been recognized previously as a complicated task

The CLIC analysis provides a framework for a further level of
analysis beyond evolutionary conservation, namely the study
of variability among repertoires. The ongoing process of 'birth
and death' of genes leads to large fluctuations in the number
of functional receptors [37]. As the diversity of the OR repertoire may serve as an indication for functional olfactory acuity
of an organism [4,38,39], comparing variability at the cluster
level (for instance, rearrangements within clusters and loss or
gain of complete clusters) would help to discern potential
functional differences among species. An example reported
here is the loss of a complete cluster from the human lineage.
A presumed syntenic mouse genomic cluster belonging to
CLIC #1 was associated with smelling isovaleric acid [17,18].
However, because humans are still capable of detecting this
odorant, it is possible that OR(s) from another cluster compensates for this loss.

deposited research

The CLIC framework was found to apply also to the OR repertoire of the more ancient opossum. Hence, the formation of
the OR cluster architecture appears to have taken place before

The question of a potential origin of OR clusters beyond the
mammalian lineage has been addressed here by broadening
the comparative analysis to the chicken OR repertoire.
Accordingly, only one nonsingleton cluster, which includes
class I receptors, has an evident common origin with a corresponding mammalian cluster. This cluster was previously
suggested to be the most ancient olfactory cluster [3]. The
inability to identify CLIC relationships for other clusters in
the chicken genome could be due either to considerable repertoire divergence after the mammalian-avian split or to massive OR gene loss in the avian lineage. The latter is supported
by a relatively poor diversity and massive pseudogenization of
the chicken OR repertoire [7,23]. We have also begun to analyze the OR repertoire of the frog Xenopous tropicalis [7],
which currently is too fragmented to allow CLIC analysis.
However, we were able to discern considerable diversity, with
practically all human-defined OR gene families amply represented (unpublished data). This result, which is in agreement
with previously published work [7], may indicate that a rich
OR repertoire existed before the amphibian-reptilian split,
providing further support to the chicken OR loss scenario.

reports

Another concept that we adopted to deal with the complexity
of the OR gene superfamily is the definition of an evolutionary common ancestor at the cluster level rather than at the
gene level. Common ancestry of similar clusters has previously been inferred only with regard to pairs of species human versus mouse [9,10] or human versus dog [11] - or to
specific clusters [34,35]. It has also been observed that the
number clusters is surprisingly similar among mammals,
despite considerable variation in the total repertoire size [4].
An important advance presented here is the definition of
multi-species sets of conserved clusters, providing one-toone mapping among clusters of different species. These newly
defined CLICs revealed evidence of an ancestral evolutionary
origin of the mammalian OR clusters, rather than independent cluster formation in each lineage. It suggests that the
uniform number of mammalian clusters stems from an
ancestral common architecture that remained practically
unchanged in contemporary species.

the split between marsupials and eutherians 185 million years
ago. Importantly, the analysis at the cluster level revealed a
conservation signal that could hardly be detected at the individual gene level, because of the relatively high (approximately 40%) DNA sequence divergence in human-opossum
pairs of OR coding regions (Additional data file 7). However,
in contrast to other species, ORs in the opossum formed
numerous additional clusters that could not be assigned to
the shared set of CLICs. This phenomenon could represent
lineage-specific expansion of the marsupial repertoire or,
alternatively, loss of ancestral clusters from the eutherian lineage. Finding out which of these alternative scenarios is correct could be aided by an outgroup genome such as that of the
monotreme platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus [36]. We
note that current fragmentation of the opossum genome
assembly could be an alternative reason for hampering
proper CLIC joining of opossum ORs.

reviews

In the present study we took a novel approach that introduced
the use of global synteny on top of local sequence similarity.
Based on whole-genome pairwise alignments among five
mammals, pairs of syntenic orthologs were identified with
high confidence, supported by the conservation of genomic
location. Applying the connected component algorithm to
syntenic ortholog pairs from all species captured the intricate
relationships within the OR gene superfamily, as manifested
in the definition of CLICs. This resulted is groups of ORs presumably derived from a specific genomic location in a presumed evolutionary ancestor. We note that our conclusions
are based on the assumption that very limited interaction/
swapping of sequences has occurred among genes and clusters, for instance by gene conversion.

comment

[6,26,27]. OR orthologs have been defined for several pairs of
genomes on the basis of amino acid sequence similarity
[4,8,10,28]. However, signals of high sequence similarity
among true orthologs are obscured in this large gene superfamily by extensive gene duplication as well as gene
conversion and sequence divergence. A recent multi-species
approach for ortholog identification increased the robustness
of inference, by seeking three-way dog-human-mouse mutual
best hits [14]. Naturally, such a strict requirement also
reduced the sensitivity of detection. Alternative algorithms
for large-scale orthology identification, such as COG [29],
INPARANOID [30], and OrthoMCL [31], entailed complex
many-to-many orthology relationships within a group of proteins but also relied solely on mutual coding sequence similarity. Enrichment by gene-related structural or functional
data has proven effective in orthology determination [32,33],
but it is impractical in the case of the OR genes because of the
paucity of relevant information.

The increase of repertoire size can occur via two main processes: expansion within clusters, or dispersion to new
genomic locations. The former appears to dominate the
increase of the rodent repertoire, as illustrated by a consistent
excess of rodent genes in mammalian CLICs. Extensive tandem gene duplication in rodents was pointed out previously
as a dominant factor in OR evolution [8,10,16]. The present
study further relates this process to the variation between
mouse and rat repertoire sizes, which appears to have arisen
mainly from a dramatic expansion of a single rat cluster
(CLIC #31). This may represent an enhanced recognition or
discrimination of the rat toward a specific set of odorants,
potentially related to a species-specific ecologic/behavioral
niche.
Cases of lineage-specific clusters have previously been
described for the human repertoire [40,41]. A similar phenomenon has been demonstrated here by several dog-specific
CLICs that represent an expansion of subfamily OR6C to
eight distant locations in the dog genome. Interestingly, the
same subfamily has been amplified independently via an
inter-chromosomal process in the dog genome, and via an
intra-chromosomal duplication within a single rat cluster.
We considered whether our analysis identifies evidence for a
single OR that seeded the evolution of a cluster. Such a scenario might appear as a CLIC composed of a single gene in
one lineage and more in others. We identified one case,
namely CLIC #3, which matches the suggested scenario, with
one OR in the mouse and two to four ORs in the other species.
However, this situation is indistinguishable from a speciesspecific deletion.
An important finding of the present analysis is that OR clusters represent an ancient genomic architecture of the mammalian genome. This conserved feature implies biologic
importance, potentially related to a common regulatory

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/10/R88

mechanism of gene expression control [42-45]. Further support for this notion derives from the observation that the primate-specific OR7E subfamily, composed chiefly of
nonfunctional pseudogenes, shows a much sparser cluster
architecture, with a considerable number of singletons. One
mechanism of cluster generation and propagation is related
to genomic sequence repeats [46]. It is noteworthy that
shared clustering appears despite the diversity of repeat elements in different mammalian genomes [47,48].
The correct description of evolutionary relationships among
mammalian OR clusters is important for an additional reason; it could provide a useful avenue to the identification of
regulatory elements. The framework of CLICs provides a natural set of orthologous sequences for the identification of
ANCORs (ancestral noncoding conserved regions [49])
within an individual OR cluster. Such elements are appropriate candidates for a regulatory role, such as transcription regulation or post-transcriptional modification. A great
challenge in the study of ORs is to elucidate the regulatory
mechanisms that mediate exclusive expression of a single
allele of one receptor per olfactory neuron. Exploring
ANCORs within CLICs may suggest putative key players in
this process.

Conclusion

The genomic architecture of mammalian OR gene clusters
has an ancient evolutionary origin, preceding the marsupialeutherian split. Species-specific evolution has further shaped
the different olfactory subgenomes, both via gain and loss of
complete clusters, and via expansion and contraction of existing clusters. The framework of CLICs enables one to pinpoint
genomic commonalities and differences among species, and
potentially relate them to olfactory capabilities. The same
approach may also be applicable for other gene superfamilies.

Materials and methods
OR genes and clusters
Human
The complete human OR repertoire with 851 genes and pseudogenes, including genomic coordinates mapped onto the
May 2004 (hg17) assembly, were extracted from the HORDE
database [13]. Subfamily OR7E (86 genes), representing a
primate-specific expansion [41], were eliminated from the
analysis.

Mouse and rat
A total of 1,296 mouse ORs were kindly provided by Zhang
and Firestein [18] (accession numbers AY072961AY074256). A total of 17,58 rat ORs [16] were kindly provided
by J Young and B Trask, University of Washington (accession
numbers are detailed in Additional data file 8). We assigned
their genomic locations on the mouse March 2005 assembly
(mm6) and rat June 2003 assembly (rn3) using BLAT [50].

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/10/R88

rounds of data-mining queries. The same criterion was used
to select 90 frog ORs and 12 chicken OR sequences for a fifth
round of TBLASTN search. Because the last two rounds did
not discover additional ORs, the search was discontinued.
TBLASTN search was conducting setting the parameter -b to
1,000.
All hits that were longer then 30 amino acids and showing at
least 30% identity were extracted from the genome and
expanded to contain 2,000 bp. These were then translated
into proteins and aligned, by CLUSTAL [52], to a multiple
alignment of human and mouse ORs [53]. Those that were
found to contain the seven-transmembrane domains, and
one-third of the amino-terminus and carboxyl-terminus typical lengths were considered automatically as intact ORs; otherwise they were translated via FASTY. The typical OR
amino- and carboxyl-termini lengths are based on human
and mouse OR repertoires.

Chicken
A total of 554 chicken ORs were used as described [7], with
their published coordinates on the chicken February 2004
assembly (galGal2). For the purposes of this study, genes that
were mapped to an undefined chromosomal location (the virtual chromosomes 'chrUn' and chromosomes with the suffix
'random') were filtered out (Table 1).
For each of the six repertoires (Table 1), sets of OR genes
located on the same chromosome with no more than 300 kb
distance between consecutive genes were identified as OR
clusters, including singleton clusters with a single gene.
Because the number of identified clusters decreases as a function of the maximal intergenic distance allowed, we selected a
distance criterion of 300 kb, at which the rate of this decrease
becomes more moderate (Additional data file 3). The genomic
coordinates of all analyzed ORs and their assignment to
clusters are available in the HORDE database [15] and in
Additional data file 8.

Data mining procedures of opossum ORs
The first 500 ORs were identified based on the UCSC humanopossum net alignment net (assembly hg17 versus
monDom1). A BLAT search [50] was performed using all 499
opossum ORs that were found to represent true OR
sequences after translation into proteins. All hit locations
were then extracted from the genome and subjected to further
protein translation procedures.
The first TBLASTN search [51] was performed using the following 24 OR sequences: cOR4Z2, cOR9S6, MOR177-3,
MOR220-1, MOR248-10, MOR263-4, MOR264-6, and an
additional 17 consensus sequences representing the 17 human
OR families. The second, third, and fourth included 30, 17,
and 65 opossum ORs, respectively. The criterion for choosing
a particular OR to serve as query was that it would represent
the OR subfamily that was not included in the previous

To classify an opossum sequence as an OR we required a
sequence identity of at least 40% over at least 100 amino acids
to any tetrapod OR. Sequences that shared more than 30%
sequence identity but less than 40% were searched by BLAST
against GPCRDB [54] and all known OR sequences. The score
of the best hit from each search was collected. The decision
(OR or non-OR) was based on the highest score.
Classification into OR families and subfamilies was performed as explained elsewhere [3,13].

OR genes in alignment chains
An automatic tool (GENETALIGN) was designed to mine and
present gene-related information from the UCSC alignment
nets [50]. It accepts a list of gene names and coordinates in
two aligned species and generates pairs of aligned genes. The
12 alignment nets, which correspond to all available pairwise
comparisons among the five mammalian genomes analyzed
here (Table 2), were downloaded from the UCSC web page
[55]. Pairwise sequence alignment files in AXT format [56]
were scanned for alignment blocks whose genomic coordinates overlap with any annotated OR coding sequence in the
reference species, and the exact corresponding segments
were extracted. Segments shorter than 100 bp in the reference species were filtered out, as were alignments to segments longer than 1,500 bp in the compared species, which
are much longer than the typical OR coding sequence. Two
alignments separated by no more than 500 bp in both species
were joined by adding the required gaps. As a result, a list was
constructed using GENETALIGN; for each gene in the reference species, this tool specifies the genomic segments to
which the gene is aligned, together with the alignment length
and percentage DNA sequence identity. The coordinates of
the aligned sequences in the target species were compared
with the OR coding sequences annotation of this species.
Alignments to genomic segments that were not annotated as
ORs, were split between two separated genomic locations, or

The reconstruction of an ancestral cluster
The reconstruction of an ancestral cluster. (a) Detailed comparison of gene content and order is shown for the four clusters included in CLIC #39 (see
Table 3), containing genes from the OR1 and OR3 families. A schematic ancestral configuration is shown at the bottom row, with inferred minimal number
of genes. Genes are presented as triangles colored by subfamily affiliation (bottom row; yellow for subfamily OR1G). Inferred chromosomal
rearrangements relative to the ancestor are specified for each species: circle = insertion, X = deletion, arrow = inversion, broken line with number of
genes = tandem duplication. A complex duplication in rodent genomes, involving subfamilies OR3A, OR1P, and OR1A, is marked with a rectangle. This
duplication was probably formed via several events, some of which occurred after the split between mouse and rat lineages. The same region had
experienced another independent event in the dog genome, in which three genes from subfamilies 1A and 1P were inverted as one unit. Tandem
duplication in one end of the rodent clusters forms a series of numerous adjacent highly similar genes from the same subfamily (OR1J). The human and
mouse orthologous clusters were studied and compared previously [27], and a complex orthology relationship among the genes was described. (b) A
phylogenetic tree of CLIC #39 ORs from which the ancestral cluster gene count can be inferred. The phylogenetic tree was generated with Mega version

To associate genes with alignment chains, alignment annotation files in NET format [56] were scanned for chains that

of at least 100 bp were selected. Then, genes associated with
a single chain were selected, and the chain number, length,
and type were added to the alignment description from the
previous step. This procedure was performed also for the
chicken versus human alignment net [55].
All analysis procedures were performed on whole-genome
alignments.

Definition of syntenic orthologs
Syntenic orthologs are defined as a pair of ORs from two different species located within the same alignment chain, which
is at least 100 kb, and sharing a minimum of 72% DNA
sequence identity over the OR coding region. The criterion of
100 kb for minimum chain length was selected to provide a
global conservation of genomic neighborhood and usually
represents previously defined synteny blocks [50]. The identity value corresponds to half of a standard deviation below
the mean sequence identity of all eutherian aligned pairs
(78%). Such a subset was defined for every pair of genomes
that was analyzed. For the chicken-human comparison, the
cutoff of chain length was lowered to 50 kb, and no sequence
similarity cutoff was used beyond the maximal expectation
value embedded in the alignment chain definition.

CLIC generation
CLICs are defined over a graph of OR genes (nodes), connected by two types of edges. One type connects pairs of syntenic orthologs, the other type represents immediate
neighborhood relations within an OR gene cluster. A CLIC is
a connected component of this graph (all the genes connected
to each other either directly or via other nodes in the group).
Therefore, all genes from one genomic cluster belong to the
same component, and all of their orthologs, together with
their complete clusters, are also included in this component.

An algorithm to divide a graph into its connected components
was constructed using the clustering functions in MATLAB
statistics toolbox. It was then applied to the set of 5,969 OR
genes from all species. The sequence identity parameter for
defining syntenic orthology, as well as the intergenic distance
parameter for defining genomic clusters, were aimed to minimize the inclusion of clusters from different chromosomes of
the same species in one CLIC.
For each multispecies CLIC, the mean cluster size was calculated, the clusters whose size diverged more than one standard deviation from the mean were excluded from the
following calculation, and the recalculated mean served as the
estimated consensus cluster size. This was performed to
eliminate the effect of species-specific expansion or deletion
on the estimated ancestral cluster size.

Additional data files

The following additional data are available with the online
version of this paper. Additional data file 1 is a table listing the
complete collection of the 251 CLICs defined in the study,
each with the number of genes from each species, and the corresponding cluster names. Additional data file 2 is a table of
genomic coordinates of non-OR genes shown in Figure 3.
Additional data file3 is a graph of the number of clusters as a
function of the maximal intergenic distance parameter. Additional data file 4 is a figure demonstrating the reconstruction
of two ancestral clusters. Additional data file 5 is a figure
demonstrating conservation of ORs and their genomic
regions in the chicken genome. Additional data file6 is a
graph describing the length of chicken-human alignment
chains containing ORs. Additional data file 7 is a graph of the
distributions of mutual sequence identity of aligned OR gene
pairs identified by GENETALIGN. Additional data file 8 is a
table of the genomic coordinates and cluster assignment for
all OR genes used in this study. Additional data file 9 contains
