Abstract
Background: In general, sugar porters function by proton-coupled symport or facilitative transport modes.
Symporters, coupled to electrochemical energy, transport nutrients against a substrate gradient. Facilitative carriers
transport sugars along a concentration gradient, thus transport is dependent upon extracellular nutrient levels. Across
bacteria, fungi, unicellular non-vertebrates and plants, proton-coupled hexose symport is a crucial process supplying
energy under conditions of nutrient flux. In mammals it has been assumed that evolution of whole body regulatory
mechanisms would eliminate this need. To determine whether any isoforms bearing this function might be conserved
in mammals, we investigated the relationship between the transporters of animals and the proton-coupled hexose
symporters found in other species.
Results: We took a comparative genomic approach and have performed the first comprehensive and statistically
supported phylogenetic analysis of all mammalian glucose transporter (GLUT) isoforms. Our data reveals the
mammalian GLUT proteins segregate into five distinct classes. This evolutionary ancestry gives insight to structure,
function and transport mechanisms within the groups. Combined with biological assays, we present novel evidence
that, in response to changing nutrient availability and environmental pH, proton-coupled, active glucose symport
function is maintained in mammalian cells.
Conclusions: The analyses show the ancestry, evolutionary conservation and biological importance of the GLUT
classes. These findings significantly extend our understanding of the evolution of mammalian glucose transport
systems. They also reveal that mammals may have conserved an adaptive response to nutrient demand that would
have important physiological implications to cell survival and growth.
Background
Sugars provide energy and structural components to all
living cells. Due to their hydrophilic nature, sugars/polyols must first traverse biological lipid bi-layer membranes
via carrier-mediated transport mechanisms. Transporter
proteins are classified based on phylogenetic and functional data. Within the major facilitator (MF) superfamily
the largest group is the sugar porter family [1]. Sugar porters are found in bacteria, archaea and eukarya and function by uniport or proton-coupled symport modes of
transport [2]. Uniport, or facilitative sugar carriers, transport a substrate along its concentration gradient, thus
transport is dependent upon extracellular nutrient levels.
Symporters, or secondary-active transporters, can move

a specific nutrient substrate against its concentration gradient in an energy requiring transport process. Energy is
sourced from an electrochemical gradient coupling
movement of nutrient substrate to translocation of ions.
Bacteria often grow in conditions of extreme environmental flux and therefore secondary-active, energydependent symport mechanisms are critical to nutrient
supply [3]. The mechanism of sugar accumulation in bacteria is exemplified by the action of the sugar porters of
Escherichia coli that symport xylose, glucose/galactose or
arabinose coupled to proton transfer [4]. For similar reasons proton-coupled sugar symport is also an important
process in algae, plants and unicellular eukaryotes [3]. A
notable exception to proton-coupled sugar symport in
bacteria is the glucose transporter of Zymonas mobilis
[5]. Z. mobilis possesses a facilitative diffusion transport
system. This species exists within a plant sap microenvironment associated with high sugar levels, therefore it is

likely that the selective pressure to maintain active sugar
transport is reduced [6].
Proton-coupled symport of glucose is not known to
occur in mammalian tissues. Following food ingestion,
endocrine controlled homeostatic processes regulate
clearance of blood glucose along its concentration gradient via the facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins to supply all tissues with fuel. Secondary-active
glucose transport does occur in mammals but is mediated by the sodium-coupled glucose co-transporter
(SGLT) family members that are distinct at the primary
and secondary structural level from the GLUT proteins
[7] and are not members of the MF superfamily [1].
Expression of SGLT proteins is primarily restricted to the
gut and kidney, where their role is energy-dependent
reabsorption of glucose from the lumen [8].
The GLUT transporter family comprises 13 members.
Based on sequence, functional and predicted structural
similarities the family has been divided into three classes
[9]. GLUT transporters exhibit tissue distribution, substrate specificity and transport kinetics that reflects their
physiological roles [10]. These however have not been
fully defined for all isoforms. The class 1 transporters
(GLUT1, 2, 3, and 4) were the first to be identified and
have been functionally well described as high affinity
facilitative glucose transporters (Additional file 1: Table
S1). Class II includes the GLUT5 transporter that has a
low affinity for glucose but facilitates the transport of
fructose [11]. Recently a novel process whereby another
class II transporter GLUT9 exchanges extracellular glucose for intracellular urate has been described [12]. In
addition GLUT class III includes by sequence similarity
the H+-myo-inositol transporter, HMIT [9]. Functionally
HMIT couples proton translocation to myo-inositol symport [13].
Significant structural features are conserved between
the mammalian glucose facilitators and proton-coupled
hexose symporters. GLUT proteins, like all the sugar porter family members, exhibit a predicted twelve transmembrane domain topology [2]. The so-called 'sugar
transport signatures' that signify substrate binding and
catalytic activity are also conserved across the sugar porter family [2,14]. The recently identified class III group of
GLUT proteins exhibit further features highlighting this
evolutionary relationship. The membrane topology of the
class I and class II GLUT proteins predicts an exofacial
loop between the first two helices. This domain contains
sites of N-linked glycosylation that are associated with
functional glucose transport [15]. The domain is not predicted in the class III GLUT structure. Rather, an exofacial loop with sites of N-linked glycosylation is predicted
between helices 9 and 10 (Figure 1). A similar membrane
topology is predicted for proton-coupled sugar symporters in plants [16].

Shown are the predicted topologies of the class I, II and III GLUT proteins [15], as well as the A. thaliana H+-myo-inositol transporter, AtINT4
[16]. Sites of N-linked glycosylation are indicated (Y).

Thus, across bacteria, fungi, unicellular non-vertebrates and plants the mechanism of proton-coupled
hexose symport is a crucial process supplying energy
under conditions of nutrient flux. By comparison, it has
been assumed that the development of whole body regulatory mechanisms in mammals would largely eliminate
this need. The precise physiological roles of a number of
the more recently identified GLUT molecules are still to
be defined [9]. Given the previous studies of sequence
similarities and comparable structural characteristics, we
questioned whether proton-coupled hexose symport was
the ancestral mechanism of sugar transport and whether
isoforms with this function have been conserved in mammals.
To address this question we took a comparative
genomic approach and have performed the first comprehensive and statistically supported phylogenetic analysis
of all the GLUT isoforms and their relatives in non-mammalian species. Our data reveals that the mammalian
GLUT proteins segregate into five distinct classes. This
evolutionary ancestry gives a clearer insight to the structure and functional relationships of the groups. Combined with biological assays we present evidence that in
response to changes in nutrient availability and environmental pH, proton-coupled, active glucose symport has
been maintained in mammalian cells. These findings significantly extend our understanding of the evolution of
mammalian glucose transport systems. They also reveal
that mammals have conserved an adaptive response to
nutrient demand that may have important physiological
implications to cell survival and growth.

Results and Discussion
The mammalian GLUT proteins are sugar porter members of the MF superfamily that spans all life forms. We
questioned whether proton-coupled glucose symport,
common to bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes and plants,
could have been maintained as multicellular animals
evolved and if not when and why this function was lost.
To do this a comparative phylogenomic approach was
employed. This strategy is particularly useful to identify
new members and novel functions in complex large families [17,18].
Previous evolutionary comparisons of the GLUT proteins have been performed prior to the identification of
the complete family and comprised limited sequence
similarity alignments. Maiden et al. [14] first determined
the sequence of the E. coli arabinose-H+ and xylose-H+
symporters and reported the seminal finding that both
were homologous to the mammalian GLUT1 facilitative
transporter. Later, Doege et al. [19], suggested that as
only one closely related Drosophila melanogaster GLUT1
homologue could be identified, the class I transporters
may be a specific development in mammals. Based on the
sequence similarities of GLUT6 and GLUT8 to bacterial
xylose and arabinose-proton symporters, Joost and Thorens [15], originally suggested these transporters represented the oldest GLUT isoforms. Our comprehensive
and statistically supported analyses now significantly
extend and clarify these comparisons. Sequences of all
known mammalian GLUT family members were subject
to systematic BLAST searches against the completed
genomes of bacteria, fungi, protists, plants, invertebrates
and vertebrates (Table 1). Quantitative protein Maximum
Likelihood (ML) determinations [20] were used to identify evolutionary relationships. Combined with functional, experimental data five key findings arise.
Comparative genomic analyses reveal five distinct
mammalian GLUT classes

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the class I and class II
mammalian GLUT proteins form distinct, well-supported clades. The class I (GLUT1, 2, 3, 4) and class II
(GLUT5, 7, 9, 11) proteins resolved as distinct, well-supported (respectively 100% and 99% bootstrap) clades (Figure 2a). Additionally, although support is not strong, class
I and class II resolve as sisters. In contrast, we show that
the mammalian proteins designated as class III GLUT
members (GLUT6, 8, 10, 12 and HMIT) do not form a
distinct clade but that the members are dispersed in the
evolutionary tree amongst non-mammalian sequences
(Figure 2a). GLUT6 and GLUT8 are sisters with strong
support (100% bootstrap). GLUT10 and GLUT12 form a
distinct clade with strong support (100% bootstrap).
HMIT sequences fall with good support (96% bootstrap)
within a larger but separate clade of sequences. Thus we

find the GLUT proteins designated as class III fall into
three separate groups and that there may be five functionally distinct mammalian GLUT classes (Figure 2b).
Comparative genomic analyses reveal archetypal
mammalian GLUT isoforms

Class I and class II GLUT proteins have no non-metazoan
relatives, suggesting these orthologues arose relatively
recently, after the divergence of multi-cellular animals
and are specific to that lineage (Figure 2a). It is noted
however, that without sequence information from the
unicellular ancestors of animals, this can only be supported by the lack of sampled Opisthokonts (Mycetazoa
and Fungi) within these clades. The class I clade contains
invertebrate (D. melanogaster) sequences branching at
the base with strong support (100% bootstrap) indicating
the existence of this class in invertebrates. The class II
clade contains only vertebrate sequences and may have
arisen after the divergence of this phylum. The clade containing GLUT6 and GLUT8 also shows invertebrate (D.
melanogaster) sequences branching at the base with 100%
bootstrap support, suggesting they may have arisen after
the divergence of the metazoans, although again this conclusion is limited by available sequence data of earlierbranching species.
In contrast, clades containing GLUT10, GLUT12 and
HMIT have sister groups that contain more distantly
related taxa (Figure 2a). The mammalian HMIT
sequences fall within a large but distinct clade comprised
of vertebrate, invertebrate, fungal and plant sequences
with good support (96% bootstrap). Many of the members of this clade have been functionally tested (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Table S1) and show conserved
function across all species as H+-myo-inositol symporters
[16,21]. Significantly, though support is only fair (78%
bootstrap), the closest relatives of mammalian GLUT10
and GLUT12 are functionally tested or predicted H+-glucose symporters of Viridiplantae species (Additional file
1: Table S1 and Figure S1). These include a functionally
tested active sugar transporter of Arabidopsis thaliana
that is thought to couple proton translocation to accumulation of glucose in the plant vacuole [22]. Sequences
from fungi and invertebrates did not resolve in this clade,
however the presence of sequences from mammals,
which diverged later, suggests gene loss in these lineages.
The tree suggests that more than one GLUT isoform
existed in ancestral eukaryotes before the divergence of
the three hypothetical supergroups (Opsthokonta,
Chromalveolata and Archeaplastida) for which genome
data is available. As the backbone of the tree is not well
supported it cannot be said which of GLUT10, GLUT12
or HMIT was the most ancestral, or which might have
been duplicated to give rise to the class I and class II
GLUT isoforms in metazoans. Overall, the tree did not

reject the theory that proton-coupled glucose symport
could be a function of mammalian GLUT genes.
Therefore, to further pursue our hypothesis that proton-coupled glucose symport could be conserved in
mammals, we then conducted a series of experiments
using the mammalian GLUT12 facilitative glucose trans-

porter, of which the closest non-animal relatives were
shown to be proton-coupled hexose symporters of Viridiplantae (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Figure S1). We
now demonstrate that in response to changes in nutrient
availability and environmental pH, proton-coupled,

active glucose symport function is maintained in mammalian cells.
Up-hill, pH dependent glucose transport is maintained in
mammalian cells

We have previously demonstrated GLUT12-mediated,
facilitative glucose transport by exogenous expression in
Xenopus laevis oocytes, a system that is useful to define
transporter function due to low endogenous glucose
transport levels [23]. We have also shown in a novel assay
using polarized epithelial cells and neutralizing antibodies, that in high glucose conditions GLUT12 is targeted to
the apical membrane of Madin Darby Canine Kidney
(MDCK) epithelial cells, where it mediates facilitative
glucose transport [24]. In this assay, cells are retrovirally
transfected with a GLUT12 cDNA containing a c-Myc
epitope tag in the fifth exofacial loop (GLUT12myc) and
glucose transport (as a function of glucose analogue
uptake) assayed at the apical surface. By comparing transport in the presence of either neutralizing Î±-c-Myc or
unrelated control Î±-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies, we
can specifically determine GLUT12-mediated glucose
transport [24]. To test whether under conditions where
intracellular glucose levels exceed those in the external
environment GLUT12 can also mediate up-hill glucose
transport, we have now employed this model for vectorial
analysis of glucose transport activity.
Transport of labelled glucose analogue was assayed at
the apical membrane of polarized MDCK cells retrovirally transfected with GLUT12myc. Transport was
assayed with or against glucose concentration gradients
at pH 7.4 or 5.0, in the presence of either neutralizing Î±-cMyc or control Î±-HA antibodies (Figure 3). At both neutral pH and in acidic conditions, GLUT12 facilitated glucose transport with a glucose gradient into MDCK cells
(Figure 3a). Facilitative transport was inhibited by
cytochalasin B, a specific inhibitor of glucose transport
proteins. Glucose gradients were then established by preincubation in high (25 mM) glucose and immediately
replacing the incubation media with low (5 mM) glucose,
so that the extracellular glucose concentration would be
lower than the intracellular concentration. At pH 7.4,
GLUT12 did not mediate transport against a glucose gradient (Figure 3b). At pH 5.0, GLUT12 mediated significant transport against a glucose gradient (Figure 3b).
GLUT12-mediated transport against a glucose gradient
into MDCK cells was blocked by cytochalasin B. We have
previously demonstrated that the subcellular distribution
of both endogenously expressed GLUT12 and
GLUT12myc are regulated in MDCK cells by chronic
(greater than 16 hours) exposure to changes in extracellular glucose levels [24]. We therefore confirmed that the
differences in glucose transport observed were not due to

Page 6 of 11

altered GLUT12 localization in response to changes in
pH or acute glucose flux (Figure 3c, d).
We have also tested the ability of the class I facilitator
GLUT3 to mediate uphill glucose transport. We, and others have previously shown that when expressed in MDCK
cells GLUT3, like GLUT12, is targeted to the apical membrane [24,25]. Therefore, glucose transport at the apical
membrane of MDCK cells stably expressing GLUT3 was
compared to that of non-transfected cells. In GLUT3
transfected cells, a significant increase in glucose transport rate (above that attributable to transport via endogenously expressed GLUT12) was measured under
conditions designed to create an inward but not outward
glucose gradient (Figure 3g, h). Under all experimental
conditions confocal immunofluorescence confirmed
GLUT3 localization to the apical cell surface (Figure 3i, j).
In addition, we have performed glucose transport assays
in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts where we demonstrate glucose
transport with, but not against, a glucose gradient (Additional file 1: Figure S2). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts express the
class I glucose transporter GLUT1 but do not express
GLUT12 [26]. The results suggest that GLUT12 but not
the class I facilitators GLUT1 or GLUT3 is able to transport glucose uphill, against its concentration gradient.
There are limitations to the experimental design used.
We cannot exclude that glucose loading to create an outward facing gradient could induce a trans-stimulation
effect. Trans-stimulation has been described as the effect
of intracellular glucose binding to the facilitative transporter molecule in the inward facing conformation, stimulating re-orientation to an outward facing conformer,
and increasing apparent transport. The phenomenon is
particularly evident in isolated membrane vesicle preparations [27,28] and has also been described in analysis of
an active transport mechanism in plants [29]. Additionally, the glucose phosphorylation rate in MDCK cells is
not known. MDCK cells are derived from the epithelium
of renal distal tubules [30] and high expression levels of
hexokinase have been reported in distal portions of the
nephron [31]. Thus, we could not exclude the possibility
that a reverse hexose gradient may not have been maintained under the experimental conditions used.
GLUT12 mediates proton-coupled, glucose symport

Therefore to further investigate whether the pH dependence of GLUT12-mediated, up-hill glucose transport
represents proton-coupled glucose symport, we used
flow cytometry to correlate H+-driven change in intracellular pH with transport against a glucose concentration
gradient. Cells loaded with the pH sensitive dye BCECF/
AM (the acetoxymethylester form of 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein) were incubated under
conditions used for glucose uptake assays. Intracellular
pH was calibrated (Additional file 1: Figure S3). No

presence of an inward facing electrochemical gradient
and results in intra-cellular acidification. The results support our interpretation that GLUT12 can mediate proton-coupled, glucose symport.
GLUT12 is not a myo-inositol transporter

accumulation. MDCK cells were preloaded with glucose to establish
outward facing glucose gradients. Accumulation of glucose tracer was
then measured in the presence or absence of an inward directed H+
gradient as indicated (pH extracellular = 5.0; pH intracellular = 7.4), (pH
extracellular = 5.0; pH intracellular = 5.0) (pH extracellular = 7.4; pH intracellular = 7.4). Triplicate accumulation time-points samples were
measured. Mean and SD were calculated. A representative experiment
is shown.

change in intracellular pH was recorded in conditions of
facilitative glucose transport (Figure 3e). In contrast, we
find a significant decrease in intracellular pH correlates
to conditions of up-hill glucose transport, suggesting
GLUT12-mediated active glucose transport occurs via a
mechanism of H+-coupled glucose symport. Consistent
with this finding, intracellular acidification was inhibited
when cytochalasin B was added to block glucose transport against a glucose gradient, thus linking glucose and
proton transport (Figure 3f).
We next performed experiments to determine whether
low extracellular pH energized uphill, GLUT12-mediated
glucose transport by means of an inward directed proton
gradient across the apical membrane. To do this polarized
MDCK cells were again preloaded with glucose. However
in these experiments cells were preloaded with glucose at
either neutral or acid pH and accumulation of glucose (as
a function of glucose analogue) measured. Intracellular
accumulation of glucose analogue against a glucose gradient only occurred when an inward directed H+ gradient
(pH extracellular = 5.0; pH intracellular = 7.4) was present (Figure 4). In contrast when the electrochemical gradient was disrupted (pH intracellular = pH extracellular),
no accumulation of glucose analogue was recorded at
either pH 5.0 or pH 7.4. The experimental design differentiates between the direct effects of external pH itself
upon glucose transport and the requirement for an electrochemical gradient [32]. In combination our experiments show that under conditions designed to create an
outward facing glucose gradient, glucose transport is pH
dependent, is inhibited by cytochalasin B, requires the

GLUT10, GLUT12 and HMIT of vertebrates and HMIT
of invertebrates and plants contain an extended insertion
at position 371-466 (relative to the human GLUT12 protein sequence) corresponding to the predicted exofacial
loop between helices 9 and 10 (Figure 1 and Figure 2b).
Although potential sites of N-linked glycosylation are
present, this insertion is truncated in GLUT6 and
GLUT8, further supporting their classification as a separate class (Figure 2b). Uldrey et al. [13] noted conserved
and potential functionally related motifs within the exofacial loop of HMIT. We find the sequence identity of the
insertion is conserved within HMIT of fungi, plants and
animals; notably several cysteine residues are conserved.
However, the identity of the insertion sequence is not
conserved between HMIT and vertebrate GLUT10 or
GLUT12. Lack of sequence conservation between the
predicted exofacial loops of GLUT12 and HMIT therefore suggests that myo-inositol is not a GLUT12 substrate
and their distinct positions in separate well-supported
clades supports the interpretation. To functionally test
this, we assayed for myo-inositol transport at the apical
surface of polarized MDCK cells. No significant myoinositol transport was detected. Assays were performed
both with or against a myo-inositol substrate gradient,
and at pH 5.0 and 7.4 (Figure 5). Control myo-inositol
transport assays were also performed (Additional file 1:
Figure S4) in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y that
express the Na+-myo-inositol transporter [33].

Figure 5 GLUT12 does not mediate myo-inositol transport. Myoinositol transport assays were performed as described in materials and
methods. No significant myo-inositol uptake was observed in MDCK
cells at either pH 7.4 or pH 5.0. Representative experiments are shown.
Bars represent mean myo-inositol uptake with data point range plotted (n = 3).

Conclusions
Our analyses support the hypothesis that proton-coupled
symport is the ancestral mechanism of sugar transport.
Close relatives of HMIT, GLUT10 and GLUT12 are present in extant eukaryotic lineages. GLUT classes I and II as
well as GLUT6 and GLUT8 appear to be specific to multicellular animals. HMIT, GLUT10 and GLUT12 retain
similarities to transporters of single-celled organisms and
plants that actively transport hexoses and may have
retained this function when hexoses are limiting or at
equilibrium. Our experiments suggest the class I isoforms
GLUT3 and GLUT1 may not exhibit this activity. However it is not known whether all isoforms outside of
HMIT, GLUT12 and GLUT10 would have lost the ability
to undergo proton-coupled hexose symport. As shown in
Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Table S1, symport activity
has been inferred for a number invertebrate transporters
closely related to the mammalian class II and GLUT6 and
GLUT8 transporters.
That mammals may have conserved an adaptive
response to nutrient demand could have important physiological implications to cell survival and growth.
GLUT12 facilitates glucose transport in nutrient excess;
in nutrient demand, GLUT12 could allow intracellular
accumulation of glucose above extracellular levels.
GLUT12 is expressed in epithelial breast and prostate
tumors that exhibit elevated glycolytic metabolism and
lactate production, resulting in an acidic environment
[34,35]. Glycolytic metabolism of glucose is thought to
initiate in response to hypoxic conditions, early in tumor
formation before a tumor vascular network has been laid
down and continues throughout tumor development. To
produce sufficient ATP via glycolysis rather than aerobic
metabolism, cancer cells require more glucose and overexpression of glucose transporter proteins is also frequently found [34,35]. GLUT12-mediated glucose symport could therefore be significant to both the initiation
and progression of tumorigenesis by providing energy for
cancerous growth, particularly where blood vessel networks and thus glucose supply are poor.
Methods
Evolutionary analyses

Genomes (Table 1) were subject to BLAST analysis with
human GLUTs 1-12 and HMIT sequences. Sequences
with an e-value of less than 105 were used in reciprocal
BLAST searches and did not identify any sequences other
than GLUTs 1-12 and HMIT. The sequences below the
cut-off were aligned by ClustalX [36]. Sequences that
compromised the inclusion set due to either large deletions or unalignable sections were removed due to the
limitations of phylogenetic analysis. The resulting matrix
contained 191 taxa, all having a BLAST scores over
0.0001 and 333 unambiguously aligned characters. This

matrix was subjected to neighbor-joining analysis by
WEIGHBOR with 4 rate categories [37]. Rates and invariable sites were calculated by PUZZLE [38]. Alignments
are available on request. Alignments were subject to maximum likelihood (ML) analysis by PhyML [20] with a
WAG substitution matrix and 9 rate categories. The Î±
value was 1.909 and number of invariable sites 0.011.
Bootstrap resampling was performed with PUZZLEBOOT [38]. 100 bootstrap trees were calculated by
PhyML. Parameters were as for ML analysis but with 4
gamma correction categories.
Materials and cell culture

Media was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA,
USA) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) from JRH Bioscience
(Lenexa, KS, USA). Where used, media was acidified with
HCl on the day of use. Rabbit polyclonal Î±-GLUT12 antibody has been described [39]. Other antibodies used
were obtained as follows: Î±-c-Myc (clone 9E10) and Î±hemagglutinin (HA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA); Î±-ZO-1 (Zonula Occludens - 1) (Zymed,
San Francisco, CA, USA); Î±-GLUT3 (Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA); Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA); Alexa-568-conjugated (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All other
reagents were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA)
unless otherwise stated. MDCK and 3T3-L1 cell lines
were maintained in 25 mM glucose Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM)/5% FBS. MDCK cells were
grown for 3-4 days in DMEM/10% FBS to a polarized
monolayer. SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in Roswell
Park Memorial Institute Medium (RPMI)/15% FBS. The
GLUT12myc and GLUT3 retroviral constructs and
MDCK retroviral transfection procedures have been previously described [24].
Glucose transport assays

Transport assays and the use of either neutralizing Î±-cMyc or control Î±-HA antibodies were performed as previously described [24]. Briefly, as GLUT12 is targeted to
the apical plasma membrane in high glucose conditions,
in assays with a glucose gradient, cells were equilibrated
for 30 minutes with equal volumes of 25 mM glucose
DMEM and 2Ã (glucose free) uptake solution (final extracellular concentration 12.5 mM glucose). Glucose transport assays were initiated by the addition of 2Ã uptake
solution (either pH 7.4 or 5.0) containing 25 mM cold 2D-deoxyglucose (to create an inward facing gradient with
a final total extracellular hexose concentration of 18.75
mM) and 1 Î¼Ci/ml 2-[1,2-3H(N)]deoxy-d-glucose (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA, USA). In assays against a glucose
gradient, cells were equilibrated in 25 mM glucose
DMEM for 30 minutes; immediately prior to glucose
transport assay extracellular equilibration media was

quickly replaced with 5 mM glucose DMEM. Glucose
transport assays were then initiated by the addition of 2Ã
uptake solution (either pH 7.4 or 5.0) containing 5 mM
cold 2-D-deoxyglucose (to create an outward facing
hexose gradient with a final total extracellular hexose
concentration of 5 mM) and 1 Î¼Ci/ml 2-[1,23H(N)]deoxy-d-glucose. To measure intracellular accumulation of glucose against a gradient, transport assays
were performed against a glucose gradient at specified
pH, with assays being terminated at one-minute intervals,
up to five minutes. SH-5YSY cells were grown to 90%
confluence in 6 well dishes. Assays of myo-inositol transport were performed as described [13,33]. For myo-inositol transport assays in MDCK monolayers, cells were
polarized in 12 well dishes and assayed as described
above with modifications: 200 Î¼M myo-inositol and 1
Î¼Ci/ml inositol, myo-[2-3H(N)] (Perkin Elmer) was used
in the 2Ã uptake solution.

Abbreviations
BCECF/AM: the acetoxymethylester form of 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified eagle medium; FBS: fetal bovine
serum; FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; GLUT: glucose transporter;
GLUT12myc: GLUT12 cDNA containing a c-Myc epitope tag in the fifth exofacial loop; HMIT: H+-myo-inositol transporter; HA: Î±-hemagglutinin; MDCK:
Madin Darby canine kidney; MF: major facilitator, ML: Maximum Likelihood;
RPMI: Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium; SGLT: Na+-coupled glucose
transporter; ZO-1: Zonula occludens - 1.

MDCK cells were polarized in 12 well dishes and equilibrated as for transport assays. When required, acidified
media was added immediately prior to flow cytometry.
Uptake buffer containing 1.5 Î¼M BCECF/AM was added
for 5 min. BCECF loaded cells were trypsinized, centrifuged and resuspended in PBS. Samples were analyzed at
488 and 568 nm with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) counting 10,000 events.
The signal was calibrated by incubating BCECF loaded
cells for 5 min with 10 Î¼M nigericin (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) in high K+ buffer (pH 6.0 - 8.0 in 0.25 increments) [40]. Data was analyzed with BD CellQuest Pro
software (BD Biosciences).
Immunofluorescence

Confocal, immunofluorescence detection and protein
localization were performed as described in WilsonO'Brien et al., 2008 [24]. A Bio-Rad MCR1024 confocal
microscope system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA),
mounted to a Leica DM112B inverted microscope (Leica,
Germany) was used to determine GLUT12 and GLUT3
protein localization in MDCK cells. A 60X APO/1.32 oil
immersion lens (Leica) was used. Excitation of FITC was
provided by the 488 nm of a Krypton/Argon laser with
the laser power set at 10% of maximum. Excitation of
AlexaFluor568 was provided by 568 nm of a Krypton/
Argon laser with the laser power set at 10% of maximum.
Fluorescence was collected using a 585-680 nm emission
filter. Images were collected using Bio-Rad Laser-Sharp
software (Bio-Rad). The resulting images were analysed
using Confocal Assistant ver. 4.02, and Adobe Photoshop
was used to generate all figures.

Experiments were performed at least 3 times (glucose
uptakes, n = 3; flow cytometry, n = 6, for each treatment).
Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA and unpaired ttests.
