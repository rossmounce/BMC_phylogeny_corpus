<p>An array-based SNP genotyping platform for Plasmodium falciparum is reported together with an analysis of SNP diversity in global
SNP genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum genome

Abstract
Background: The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum exhibits abundant genetic diversity, and
this diversity is key to its success as a pathogen. Previous efforts to study genetic diversity in P.
falciparum have begun to elucidate the demographic history of the species, as well as patterns of
population structure and patterns of linkage disequilibrium within its genome. Such studies will be
greatly enhanced by new genomic tools and recent large-scale efforts to map genomic variation. To
that end, we have developed a high throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping
platform for P. falciparum.
Results: Using an Affymetrix 3,000 SNP assay array, we found roughly half the assays (1,638)
yielded high quality, 100% accurate genotyping calls for both major and minor SNP alleles.
Genotype data from 76 global isolates confirm significant genetic differentiation among continental
populations and varying levels of SNP diversity and linkage disequilibrium according to geographic
location and local epidemiological factors. We further discovered that nonsynonymous and silent

(synonymous or noncoding) SNPs differ with respect to within-population diversity, interpopulation differentiation, and the degree to which allele frequencies are correlated between
populations.
Conclusions: The distinct population profile of nonsynonymous variants indicates that natural
selection has a significant influence on genomic diversity in P. falciparum, and that many of these
changes may reflect functional variants deserving of follow-up study. Our analysis demonstrates the
potential for new high-throughput genotyping technologies to enhance studies of population
structure, natural selection, and ultimately enable genome-wide association studies in P. falciparum
to find genes underlying key phenotypic traits.

Background

Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent species of
malaria and the primary cause of malaria-related mortality
across the globe. The success of P. falciparum as a pathogen
derives in part from its high levels of genetic diversity [1-4],
diversity that endows the parasite with the evolutionary agility to rapidly develop resistance to a series of drugs developed
for its control [5], to thwart the development of effective vaccines [6], and to efficiently evade immune responses [7-9].
Large-scale genotyping of P. falciparum will improve understanding of these capabilities, and will permit wide-ranging
investigation of the parasite's biology, including population
structure and history, outcrossing and recombination frequency and instances of natural selection, and inform effective intervention strategies. As a target for genotyping, P.
falciparum has the advantage that it is haploid during human
stages of its life cycle, making identification of haplotypes and
inference of outcrossing from patient isolates more straightforward than in primarily diploid parasites.
Prior multilocus analyses have revealed important aspects of
the parasite's biology even though these studies did not
encompass the entire genome. Microsatellite studies, the
largest using 342 loci, have revealed geographic differences in
genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) that are
correlated with the incidence of multiple infections, with
diversity highest in African populations and lowest in South
American populations [10], as well as evidence for multiple,
recent selective sweeps [11]. A recent study of 183 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 3 came to
similar conclusions, finding geographic variation in effective
recombination rate, frequency of out-crossing and strong
population structure at the continental scale [12].
Recent genome-wide surveys of genomic variation in P. falciparum have uncovered tens of thousands of new SNPs,
indels, and structural variants [2-4,13]. This resource opens
the door to comprehensive genotyping analyses, including
genome-wide scans for natural selection and genome-wide
association studies for genetic loci underlying phenotypes
like drug resistance and virulence. Inferences from genome
wide analyses of diversity are less subject to the inherent
biases associated with analyses of individual antigenic loci,

which may be targets of strong natural selection, and promise
to more accurately reflect overall patterns of genetic variation
in P. falciparum. The first step needed is to develop highthroughput genotyping technology that can take advantage of
the extensive new diversity data.
In this manuscript we report the development of a 3,000 SNP
Affymetrix genotyping array and initial biological observations resulting from its deployment with 76 globally distributed parasite isolates. We demonstrate the ability of this
platform to contend with the extremely high (approximately
81%) A/T composition of the P. falciparum genome, with
mixed parasite genotypes, and with human DNA contamination. Using SNP data collected from the array, we confirm
with greater resolution differences in the level of genomic
diversity between African, Asian, and American populations
of P. falciparum, document genetic differentiation of those
continental populations as well as the presence of structure
within non-African populations, and explore the important
roles of natural selection and recombination in sculpting
genetic variation within malaria populations. We anticipate
that a scaled-up genotyping array based on this now-proven
technology will usher in fundamental new insights into basic
malaria biology as well as novel disease intervention strategies.

Results
Array assessment
The genotyping array employs a standard Affymetrix 500 K
array design, utilizing a total of 56 probes arrayed in 14 quartets to interrogate each SNP. Mismatch probes were utilized
in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Dynamic Modeling (DM) calling algorithm for the A/T-rich P. falciparum
genome. We included 2,153 SNPs from chromosome 7 on the
array to assess patterns of LD near a known selective sweep
[11], as well as 847 SNPs selected from other genomic locations distributed across all 14 chromosomes. We hybridized a
total of 108 samples to the Affymetrix array to assess its performance. These samples included the 16 P. falciparum
strains we used for SNP ascertainment [3], in order to assess
genotyping accuracy as well as genotyping call rate. We
applied three SNP calling algorithms to the data: DM,

BRLMM (Bayesian Robust Linear Modeling using Mahalanobis Distance), and BRLMM-P. The BRLMM-P algorithm
yielded the highest call rate and concordance with known
genotypes. The average BRLMM-P call rate for the 16 strains
used for SNP ascertainment was 91% (2,732 assays out of
3,000), similar to what was observed for early generations of
Affymetrix human SNP arrays [14]. Overall concordance with
known genotype for all genotype calls was also 91%, indicating that the array is able to accommodate the extremely high
A/T composition of the P. falciparum genome. A number of
assays consistently yielded only the major (most common)
SNP allele, suggesting either that those assays were faulty or
that the genomic positions the assays targeted were incorrectly identified as polymorphic. Removal of these uninformative assays as well as assays that gave an incorrect
genotype call for one or more samples yielded a set of 1,638
assays that achieved perfect concordance with known genotypes for both the major and minor alleles in the 16 samples
used for SNP ascertainment. A histogram of DM, BRLMM,
and BRLMM-P call rates for this validated set of 1,638 SNPs
in the ascertainment sample set is illustrated in Additional
data file 1. Replicate hybridization data (not shown) for the
HB3 and 3D7 samples indicate that overall genotyping consistency is 99.9%. Results of experiments to test array performance in the presence of human DNA or DNA from mixed
malaria infections are included in Additional data files 2-4.

moDB 5.0 assembly as reference) of all 1,441 assays used in
downstream analyses are included in Additional data file 5,
along with genotype information for all 76 geographic or SNP
ascertainment samples. These genotyping data have also
been submitted to PlasmoDB [15].

Population samples

We assessed the effect of selective sweeps on our SNP diversity data by examining the known selective sweep for chloroquine resistance around pfcrt on chromosome 7. We assayed
the genotyped strains for resistance to chloroquine, and
divided the Asian and African samples into chloroquineresistant (CQR) and chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) groups.
Separately calculating the SNP π values for each group, we
found a clear signal of selection (permutation (see Materials
and methods); P < 0.01) in the region of reduced diversity
(located at approximately 460 kb) around pfcrt (Figure 1b),
as might be expected following a selective sweep.

We hybridized a global collection of parasite isolates to the
array to examine population structure, SNP diversity, and LD
in the P. falciparum genome. This collection is summarized
in Table 1, and includes 23 samples from Thailand, 20 samples from Senegal, 11 samples from Brazil, 8 samples from
Malawi, 2 samples from India, as well as single isolates from
a variety of other African, Asian/Pacific, and Central/South
American locales. As noted in Table 1, a small number of
patient isolate samples are suspected to be mixtures of genetically distinct strains rather than single lineages based on the
results of PCR-based assays of high frequency SNPs (data not
shown). Genotyping data from these strains were excluded
from all LD analyses, but included in diversity and divergence
analyses. We expect the genotyping data from mixed samples
to predominantly reflect the genotype of the strain present in
greatest abundance, based on experimental hybridizations
with formulated strain mixtures (Additional data file 3). We
also hybridized DNA from P. reichenowi, the species most
closely related to P. falciparum, in order to root allelic dimorphisms. All analyses were performed using a set of 1,441
assays (out of the 1,638 validated SNPs) that achieved a call
rate of at least 80% among all 76 geographic or SNP ascertainment samples. A total of 874 assays of this subset of 1,441
come from chromosome 7; 281 SNPs are intergenic, 48 are
intronic, 386 are synonymous coding, and 726 are nonsynonymous. Assayed genic SNPs occur in 180 genes on chromosome 7 and 487 genes from all 13 of the remaining
chromosomes. The genomic coordinates (using the 3D7 Plas-

Variation in SNP diversity
Overall SNP diversity at assayed loci varied by geographic
region. Diversity was quantified using a statistic we term 'SNP
π', defined as the average proportion of pairwise differences
at assayed SNP loci within a defined population. At the continental scale, we measured the following SNP π values across
all SNPs, with 95% confidence intervals indicated in parentheses: Africa = 0.234 (0.224-0.244); Asia = 0.227 (0.2190.236); Americas = 0.14 (0.130-0.147). This ranking agrees
with observations made using microsatellites [10], but differs
from estimates obtained using 183 SNPs from chromosome 3
(Americas > Africa > Papua New Guinea > South-East Asia)
[12]. At an intra-continental scale, we observed SNP π values
of 0.227 (0.217-0.236) for Senegal, 0.165 (0.154-0.175) for
Malawi, 0.187 (0.178-0.196) for Thailand, and 0.090 (0.0810.098) for Brazil. For all defined populations, SNP diversity is
higher for silent (synonymous or noncoding) SNPs than for
nonsynonymous SNPs (Figure 1a), consistent with a greater
proportion of nonsynonymous SNPs being subject to positive
or negative natural selection.

Phylogenetic analysis
We examined the relatedness of the parasite isolates, and
present a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree rooted with
P. reichenowi in Figure 2. This tree reflects strong bootstrap
support for a clade composed largely of Asian samples, as well
as a Brazilian clade, thereby offering strong evidence that P.
falciparum is not a sexually panmictic species. The Senegal
isolates (sample prefix = Sen or Thi) and Malawi isolates
(sample prefix = CF) cluster together, although the clade they
comprise does not exhibit strong bootstrap support. The HB3
and Santa Lucia samples (collected from Central America) are
allied with the Brazilian samples, but curiously they also cluster strongly with the Senegal sample SenP26.04. SenP26.04,
as well as other samples that do not cluster according to their
sampling location (TM-4C8-2, D6, Malayan Camp, T2/C6)
may represent strains with poor phylogenetic signal, cases of
recent migration, or instances of cross-contamination in cul-

ture. The longer terminal branches of the Senegal isolates relative to the Brazilian or Asian isolates reflect the greater
genomic diversity in that population, which is consistent with
the higher rates of outcrossing and prevalence of infection
observed in African populations.
SNP ascertainment bias can influence phylogenetic analyses
if a limited number of reference strains are used to identify
SNPs [16]. We performed SNP discovery from 16 strains of
diverse geographic origins to reduce the potential for phylogenetic distortion. As Figure 2 illustrates, the SNP discovery
strains (indicated by yellow diamonds) are distributed evenly
across the major geographic clades, suggesting that this analysis is most likely not biased by geographically restricted SNP
discovery. Our SNP set is also likely enriched for SNPs exhibiting high minor allele frequency (MAF), which are likely
more phylogenetically informative than low MAF SNPs. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses performed using the
high MAF versus low MAF subsets of the SNP data yielded
fundamentally congruent topologies (Additional data file 6),
though the low-MAF tree exhibits compacted branch lengths
and reduced bootstrap support.

The genomic reference strain 3D7 exhibits the longest branch
of any ingroup taxon in the phylogenetic tree, resulting from
the presence of 83 singleton SNPs in this lineage (142 if P.
reichenowi is excluded). This abundance of singletons
derives partially from bias in SNP ascertainment; 3D7 has
been more deeply sequenced (12-18× coverage [17]) than any
other strain, resulting in more variants unique to this strain
being included on the array. (In sequence data, 380 SNPs on
the array were singletons with the minor allele in 3D7, versus
146 singletons for HB3 and 53 singletons for Dd2, both of
which were sequenced to 8× coverage [3].) The bias in SNP
ascertainment may also contribute to the basal phylogenetic
position of 3D7, near the P. reichenowi outgroup; 3D7 singletons with a derived (non-P. reichenowi) allele contribute to
the long terminal branch length of 3D7, while 3D7 singletons
with the ancestral (P. reichenowi) allele artificially enhance
the evolutionary affinity of 3D7 and P. reichenowi.

Population structure
We further analyzed the SNP data with two other population
genetic analysis software packages, the programs Structure
(v2.2.2) and SmartPCA. Structure uses a Bayesian approach

our dataset the posterior probability asymptotes at 3 populations (Additional data file 7a), suggesting that continental
boundaries between Asian, African, and American populations give rise to most of the population structure we can

detect. Posterior probabilities of population membership for
each of the samples (Additional data file 7b) are generally
concordant with the phylogeny, and indicate that most samples sort unambiguously into expected groups according to

population not sampled by the present dataset and/or temporal turnover in allele frequencies since 3D7 was collected
almost 30 years ago.
We used SmartPCA [19] to perform a principal components
analysis of the dataset, leading to very similar conclusions:
southeast Asian, African and Brazilian samples form welldefined clusters, with the same few anomalous strains as in
the other analyses (Additional data file 8). The one Papua
New Guinea sample is on the edge of the southeast Asian cluster, and the Indian samples lie between the South-East Asian
and African clusters. Preliminary principal components analyses that included SNPs in the region of the pfcrt selective
sweep on chromosome 7 resulted in a heavy loading of signal
in that region (data not shown), so SNPs from that region
were excluded from the present analysis. Principal components analysis suggests two additional conclusions. First, it
provides evidence for structure within the Brazilian population, consistent with a previous report [20] (Additional data
file 8a); a larger sample size will be needed to confirm this
suggestion. Second, it shows only a weak signal for shared
ancestry between the two Central American parasites and the
Brazilian cluster (in the first principal component), and
strong signals of independent evolution (in the second and
third principal components). This result cannot determine
whether P. falciparum was introduced independently into
the two regions, but it does suggest that there has been little
gene flow between them.
Analysis of population divergence using the FST statistic corroborates genetic differentiation at the continental scale and
further finds significant genetic differentiation between the
two African populations (Senegal versus Malawi FST = 0.181).
All pairwise population comparisons are significant by bootstrapping at P < 10-4, but the magnitude of FST varies considerably among the comparisons. We found the greatest
differentiation between Asian and American samples (FST =
0.431), followed by Africa versus Americas (0.306), and
Africa versus Asia (FST = 0.236). The much greater genetic
differentiation between American and Asian P. falciparum
populations than American and African populations (bootstrapping; P < 10-4) supports a hypothesis of recent colonization of the Americas by African P. falciparum strains after the
arrival of Europeans.
For all population comparisons except Senegal versus Brazil,
we observe a greater FST for nonsynonymous SNPs relative to
silent SNPs (Figure 3a), suggesting that differential positive
or negative selection may play a significant role in population
differentiation. Alternatively, SNP ascertainment bias could
potentially be differentially influencing the frequency spectra
of nonsynonymous and silent SNPs and yielding an artifactual difference in FST. Binning SNPs by average derived allele
frequency (DAF) across Senegal and Thailand to control for
this effect indicates that nonsynonymous SNPs still exhibit

Volume 9, Issue 12, Article R171

Neafsey et al. R171.8

greater population structure than silent SNPs (Figure 3b),
especially among SNPs with intermediate average DAF across
those two populations. This observation holds true if SNPs
from the densely sampled chromosome 7 are excluded from
analysis (Additional data file 9), suggesting the phenomenon
of enhanced nonsynonymous divergence is a genome-wide
rather than localized effect.
The importance of selection in shaping P. falciparum variation can be further seen by comparing divergence between
populations with genetic diversity. Antigenic loci in P. falciparum are subject to diversifying selection, and often have
extremely high diversity. We can expect the intense pressure
for diversity to impede positive selection for other traits, and
that high divergence between populations will, therefore, be
uncommon near these loci. Indeed, we find that divergence
(FST) between the Senegal and Thailand populations is
inversely correlated with P. falciparum diversity (as measured worldwide) at the same locus (Pearson's ρ = -0.17); high
FST SNPs are, in fact, almost absent from high diversity
regions (Figure 4; Fishers exact test, P = 2 × 10-6). An additional factor, also related to selection, is probably operating
here as well: loci that have experienced population-specific
selective sweeps will have higher divergence with other populations as well as reduced diversity in that population, which
will be reflected in the global diversity. Differential intensity
of purifying selection between populations would be unlikely
to yield a similar negative regional association between diversity and divergence, as relaxed purifying selection in a population would be expected to simultaneously and uniformly
increase both divergence and diversity. Whatever the particular mechanism, the correlation illustrates the important role
selection has in shaping population divergence in P. falciparum.

Derived allele frequency spectra
Figure 5 illustrates the DAF spectra in Senegal and Thailand
for all nonsynonymous and silent (noncoding and synonymous) SNPs for which the ancestral genotype could be
inferred. SNPs were chosen for the array in part due to preliminary indications from comparative sequencing that they
were not singletons, so these frequency spectra are likely
enriched for higher-frequency variants and cannot be interpreted directly in comparison to neutral expectations. In both
populations, there is a slight excess of low frequency (0-10%)
nonsynonymous SNPs relative to silent SNPs (Fisher's exact
test; Senegal P = 0.03, Thailand P = 0.05). This may be indicative of purifying selection maintaining slightly deleterious
amino acid replacements at low population frequencies. The
nonsynonymous and silent DAF spectra for Thailand show an
abundance of high-frequency (90-99%) derived SNPs relative
to Senegal. An excess of high-frequency derived alleles is an
expected byproduct of genetic hitchhiking [21], whereby
selective sweeps are 'interrupted' by recombination and leave
partially linked alleles segregating at high frequencies instead
of fixing them in the population [22].

Alternatively, the excess of SNPs exhibiting high DAF in Thailand could result from hidden population structure in the
sample, where a derived allele is precluded from being classified as 'fixed' (100% frequency) by the inclusion in the sample

derived allele has not fixed. If this were the cause of the excess

of high frequency derived alleles, we would expect the same
few samples to exhibit an ancestral allele at multiple loci with
high DAF. We find evidence to support this hypothesis.
Though the Thailand samples T116, PR145, and TD257 are
not phylogenetically distinct from the other Thailand samples
(Figure 2) nor distinct by the FST metric (FST = 0.175, bootstrapping P = 0.69), these 3 strains (out of 23 in the population sample) exhibit an ancestral allele for approximately
two-thirds of high DAF SNPs in both the nonsynonymous and
silent data sets. Such a non-uniform distribution of ancestral
alleles is unexpected from a freely mixing population. We
conclude that hidden population structure, perhaps exacerbated by reduced outcrossing in Thailand P. falciparum populations, is responsible for the contrast in DAF spectra
between Senegal and Thailand.
Though hidden population structure and SNP ascertainment
bias may confound direct interpretation of DAF spectra in
Senegal and Thailand, the DAF correlation between these two
populations is more directly indicative of natural selection.
Nonsynonymous SNPs exhibit a significantly weaker DAF
correlation between Senegal and Thailand than silent SNPs
(r2 = 0.25 and 0.45, respectively; bootstrapping P < 10-4;
Additional data file 10). Both nonsynonymous and silent
derived allele frequencies are susceptible to bias from hidden
population structure or other departures from demographic
equilibrium, so the contrast between these two classes of
SNPs is most likely due to population-specific natural selection.

We can roughly estimate the proportion of nonsynonymous
SNPs subject to differential positive or negative selection as a
function of the disparity in derived allele frequency between
Senegal and Thailand. If nonsynonymous and silent SNPs are
subject to equal evolutionary pressures, demographic events,
and ascertainment biases, then similar proportions of these
two classes of SNPs should exhibit differences in allele frequency between the two populations that are above or below
a threshold value. Deviations from this expectation are measurable by a Fisher's exact test applied to a 2 × 2 contingency
table containing counts of the number of SNPs in each class
above or below the threshold frequency disparity. The solid
line in Figure 6 illustrates the statistical significance of the
excess of observed nonsynonymous SNPs segregating with
inter-population frequency disparities at least as divergent as
the threshold values listed on the horizontal axis. The dashed
line indicates the surplus of nonsynonymous SNPs above
each frequency difference threshold, and may give a rough
indication of the proportion of SNPs subject to selection in
each class. The most statistically significant deviation from
expectations occurs for SNPs with a disparity in population
frequencies of at least 70% (bootstrapping P = 6.34 × 10-4).
We find 55 nonsynonymous SNPs with frequency deviations
above this threshold compared to only 13 synonymous mutations, from an original set of 598 nonsynonymous SNPs and
598 (by coincidence) silent SNPs that were polymorphic in

Linkage disequilibrium
Analysis of LD using the full set of genotyped SNPs reveals
striking variation in the extent of LD across different populations. A greater extent of LD in Asian than in African populations has previously been reported [3,10,12], and our results
(Figure 7) confirm that the difference is indeed large. Both the
Senegal and the Malawi samples show essentially zero LD
(above an artifactual background caused by small sample
size) for markers separated by more than 1,000 base pairs.
Modest but statistically significant LD extends to approximately 20 kb in the parasites from Thailand and to approximately 100 kb in the Brazilian sample. One contributor to the
visible LD could be the known selective sweep on chromosome 7 (around the pfcrt gene), where our SNPs are concentrated. Removing that region (defined as extending from 300600 kb along the chromosome, and containing 219 SNPs) did
reduce r2, but only at very short distances and only by approximately 5%, suggesting that the selective sweep does not significantly bias allele frequencies otherwise analyzed.
Assuming there has been no recent large-scale admixture in
Thailand and Brazil, the longer LD can be attributed to their
smaller effective population size and the reduced outcrossing
in low-transmission locales.

The two non-African samples also showed a significant (bootstrapping; P < 10-4) amount of LD between unlinked markers,
as determined by calculating r2 between markers lying on different chromosomes. Correlation between alleles at unlinked
markers is evidence for population structure within the data
sample. Since accidental inclusion of closely related samples
can produce the same effect, we removed one sample from the
most closely related pair of Thai samples and redid the calculation; the change to measured LD was negligible. Population
structure has previously been reported within South America
[10] and within Brazil itself [20], but not previously for Thailand.

Discussion

The results we present here on malaria population biology are
important in that they confirm with significantly more data
previous observations about the distribution of diversity in
the P. falciparum parasite population, highlight the influence
of natural selection on P. falciparum genomic diversity and

divergence, and provide strong evidence that larger datasets
will prove very useful in learning more about the biology of
the parasite and the manifestation of disease. For example,
though previous multilocus genotyping efforts in this parasite
succeeded in documenting heterogeneous diversity levels and
genetic differentiation among populations, the scale of the
present analysis has enabled us to statistically distinguish the
pattern of differentiation at nonsynonymous SNPs potentially subject to natural selection and synonymous or silent
SNPs that are presumably closer to selective neutrality, but
otherwise subject to similar effects from demographic effects
and nearby selective sweeps. We observed higher FST values
for nonsynonymous SNPs than for silent SNPs in all population comparisons except Africa versus Americas (which
exhibited highly similar values for both classes), which suggests a role for natural selection in the ongoing genetic differentiation of malaria populations in disparate geographic
locales. Though a previous investigation observed a similar
contrast in divergence between ten nonsynonymous SNPs at
loci known to be associated with anti-malarial drug resistance
and ten silent SNPs at housekeeping or unknown loci [23], we
have demonstrated that nonsynonymous variation exhibits a
distinct evolutionary profile across the genome, and not only
at loci known to be subject to drug-mediated selection.
Both negative (purifying), and positive (directional/balancing) selection can increase population divergence if the efficacy of the selection differs geographically [24]. A recent
study of human SNP data found that nonsynonymous SNPs
were more likely than synonymous SNPs to exhibit extremes
of both low divergence (attributed by the authors to purifying
selection) and high divergence (attributed to positive selection) [25]. Our data show only half of this pattern, an overall
trend for nonsynonymous SNPs to have higher divergence
than silent ones. This pattern suggests that either localized
positive selection or strong differences in selective constraints play a substantial role in shaping population differentiation in P. falciparum (the failure to detect the clearest
signal of purifying selection, an excess of low-FST nonsynonymous SNPs, may simply result from small sample size).
Even if negative selection plays an important role in nonsynonymous SNP divergence among P. falciparum populations,
there are numerous potential population-specific environmental factors that could induce differentiation by positive
selection. For example, population differentiation at nonsynonymous SNPs could result in variation among human host
populations in HLA allelic composition, different Anopheles
mosquito vectors, and/or heterogeneous application of antimalarial therapeutics. Alternatively, some of the variant nonsynonymous SNPs may represent positively selected mutations that have arisen due to selection pressures that are
present in both populations, but which have been prevented
from spreading between the populations due to geographic
barriers to gene flow. Deeper probing of these questions with
expanded sample sets and denser SNP assays should illumi-

nate whether these observed patterns of divergence and polymorphism are due to negative, positive, or balancing selection
pressures.
Nonsynonymous SNPs that vary widely in frequency among
P. falciparum populations warrant deeper follow-up investigations, as many may represent functional variations with
important implications for public health or understanding of
basic malaria biology. Nonsynonymous SNPs that differ even
marginally in frequency among populations may be subject to
selection (Figure 6). It should be noted that while the SNPs
selected for inclusion in our pilot array are biased for a
number of reasons, they are not expected to be enriched for
variants subject to selection. Indeed, nonsynonymous SNPs
in highly polymorphic subtelomeric gene families are known
to be subject to strong immune selection, but are virtually
absent among the SNPs on our array due to difficulties in recognizing and genotyping SNPs that are in close physical proximity. In all, only 12 of our SNPs were in clearly identified
antigenic genes (as defined by Gene Ontology category).
The SNPs we profiled, consequently, may be expected to yield
a conservative estimate of the degree to which segregating
genetic variation in P. falciparum is subject to populationspecific positive or negative natural selection. This broad survey of genetic diversity in P. falciparum stands in contrast to
most previous analyses of variability in the parasite, many of
which focused on antigenic loci such as AMA-1 [26,27] or
MSP-1 [28] that are known to be subject to strong positive
selection. While these population genetic analyses of antigens
yield valuable information about the loci in question, the
influence of strong host-mediated selective pressure erases
typical patterns of genetic diversity and LD in the region of
these genes, making difficult any accurate inferences about
demographic history or population structure from the data.
The very short range of detectable LD on chromosome 7
makes it likely that the profile of diversity we have observed is
not dominated by one or more linked loci subject to strong
selection (such as pfcrt), but instead that it reflects many
independent, relatively unbiased local profiles of the interplay of natural selection and genetic drift.

Conclusion

Our observations of large disparities in SNP diversity levels
and LD magnitude, as well as significant selection-driven
genetic differentiation among geographic populations of P.
falciparum, underscore the extreme variability of the population biology and epidemiology of malaria [3,10,12]. Our data
confirm that the greatest levels of genetic diversity and outcrossing occur in African populations of P. falciparum, likely
as a result of greater incidence of infection (population size)
and simultaneous infection of single hosts by multiple parasite lines (which facilitates sexual outcrossing in the mosquito). Consideration of such population factors will be
important in interpreting observations of SNP diversity and

selecting appropriate locations for genome-wide association
studies, which require LD between SNP markers and causal
loci for success. For example, if resistance to an anti-malarial
drug arises in an Asian or American P. falciparum population, strong selection and low rates of outcrossing will likely
leave a strong signal in the SNP diversity within those populations detectable through haplotype-based tests [29].
In summary, we have demonstrated the effectiveness and
efficiency of the Affymetrix SNP genotyping array as a platform for high-throughput genotyping in the AT-rich P. falciparum genome, and have used a pilot version of this platform
to perform the most comprehensive genome-wide genotyping
analysis to date in this parasite. We are developing an
expanded version of this array that will use probes to survey
approximately 75,000 P. falciparum SNPs, as well as tiled
probes to detect known and novel polymorphisms in dozens
of other malaria genes of interest. We expect this high-density, genome-wide multilocus genotyping approach to have
broad utility for investigations of basic malaria biology as well
as for public health applications such as diagnostics and surveillance for drug resistance. Population genetic analyses that
exploit regional variation in diversity or LD across the
genome have already proven useful for re-identifying known
drug-resistance loci [3,30-32], and will become more powerful tools for identifying genetic loci underlying traits of interest as further SNPs are discovered and incorporated into
high-throughput genotyping platforms. Genome-wide association studies driven by such a tool will provide investigators
with another avenue to identify the genes behind important
disease phenotypes, and may help bridge some of the outstanding gaps in our knowledge of gene function and basic
biology of the parasite.

pended in TE (Tris EDTA) buffer for processing and hybridization. Genome-wide genotype data from the Affymetrix
array were generated with the human 500 K array protocol
but with a smaller hybridization volume of 125 μl owing to the
smaller surface area of the malaria array.
Haploid SNP calls were made using several algorithms available in the Affymetrix Power Tools (apt-1.8.5): DM, BRLMM,
and BRLMM-P. Default confidence thresholds were
employed for all algorithms (P = 0.05 for BRLMM-P, 0.50 for
BRLMM, 0.30 for DM). Genotype calls for 16 reference arrays
were then compared against known sequencing data for the
same strains [2-4]. SNPs that showed any discordance with
sequencing data and SNPs that did not have overlapping calls
for both alleles were discarded and only the remaining SNPs
were used for analysis. The BRLMM-P data set was used for
all analyses in this paper, as it exhibited the most perfectly
concordant SNPs (1,638) and a much higher call rate than the
other algorithms (Additional data file 1).

Parasite samples
Parasites were obtained from the Malaria Research and Reagent Resource Repository (MR4, ATCC, Manassas, Virginia)
or additional sources noted (Table 1). MR4 isolates were provided by the following depositors: WE Collins (MRA-362);
DE Kyle (MRA-159, MRA-176, MRA-202, MRA-204, MRA205, MRA-206, MRA-207, MRA-285); LH Miller and D
Baruch (MRA-330); X Su (MRA-818, MRA-821, MRA-822);
W Trager (MRA-733); D Walliker (MRA-151, MRA-152,
MRA-153, MRA-200); TE Wellems (MRA-155, MRA-156);
and Y Wu (MRA-201). Patient samples were obtained as part
of ongoing studies in Senegal and Malawi described elsewhere in accordance with human subject guidelines. Parasites were cultured by standard methods and nucleic acids
were obtained using Qiagen genomic-tips (100/G, Qiagen). P.
reichenowi DNA was the generous gift of John Barnwell.

Genotyping array and hybridization
A standard Affymetrix array design was utilized, with each
SNP interrogated by a set of fifty-six 25-mer nucleotide
probes arranged in fourteen probe quartets (one 'perfectmatch' and one 'mismatch' probe for each of the two alleles).
SNPs identified through comparative sequencing [2-4] were
selected for the inclusion on the Affymetrix array according to
several considerations. Virtually all SNPs discovered on chromosome 7 (n = 2,153) were included in order to assess decay
in LD as a function of distance from a known selective sweep
on chromosome 7 at the pfcrt locus [11]. The remaining 843
SNPs were chosen by attempting to achieve uniform assay
density over the remainder of the genome with SNPs that
were non-singletons and achieved a high 'designability' rating
using Affymetrix software. A list of validated SNP assays is
included in Additional data file 5.
DNA was isolated from culture-adapted parasites (see 'Parasite samples' below) using standard 100/G protocols (Catalog
number 13343, Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and resus-

Population genetic analyses
All population genetic analyses were conducted using SNPs
that yielded 100% accurate genotyping results for both the
major and minor assayed alleles, and which yielded calls in at
least 80% of the population samples hybridized to the array.
Measurements of population diversity were carried out using
the 'SNP π' statistic, which was calculated as the average
number of pairwise differences at assayed SNPs between all
members of a sample. Population divergence was measured
using the FST statistic, calculated with the method of Hudson,
Slatkin and Maddison [33]. Statistical significance of FST and
SNP π comparisons, as well as 95% confidence intervals for
both statistics, were calculated using nonparametric bootstrapping. We also employed Structure 2.2 software [18] to
examine parasite population structure. We conducted analyses twice for K values 2-5. Each analysis was allowed to run
100,000 iterations, with 50,000 burn-in cycles. An admixture model was used for all Structure analyses. Global nucle-

otide diversity (π) was calculated using the sequencing data in
[3]. For this analysis, high diversity was defined as π > 0.005.
The maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was conducted using PHYML software [34] on a BIONJ [35] starting
tree. An HKY85+Γ model of substitution was employed and
1,000 bootstrap replicates were performed. All model parameters were estimated from the data.
Population-specific DAF spectra are based on only those
SNPs that are not fixed in a given population to reduce spectrum distortion from SNPs that were born in another population following. Consequently, slightly different SNP sets are
used in each population. DAFs were estimated for 360 nonsynonymous and 399 silent SNPs in Senegal, and 397 nonsynonymous and 387 silent SNPs in Thailand.

(π CQS −π CQR )
(π CQS +π CQR )

(where π is the SNP π

value) for each window. Significance was estimated by permuting the bins and counting the fraction of cases that
yielded a value of this statistic higher than seen in the data
around pfcrt.

Linkage disequilibrium
LD was studied within each of the four populations with
enough samples: Thailand, Malawi, Senegal and Brazil. For
this analysis, two nominally Thai samples (T2/C6 and TM4C8-2) were dropped that clustered with other populations in
the phylogenetic analysis, and only parasites representing
single genomes were included in the analysis. Missing genotypes were not imputed. The widely used LD statistic r2 was
calculated within each population for all pairs of SNPs sharing the same chromosome; pairs were binned by distance and
averaged within each bin. The level of LD between unlinked
markers was estimated by calculating r2 between all pairs of
SNPs on different chromosomes. To determine the bias
caused by small sample size, the unlinked calculation was
repeated, with the change that for each pair of SNPs, the genotype for one was taken from one strain while the genotype
for the second was taken from another strain. This background value of r2 was calculated separately for the possible
pairs of different strains and then averaged. The statistical
significance of the observed LD between unlinked markers
was estimated by calculating r2 under bootstrap re-sampling
of unlinked markers; this provides an estimate of the statistical uncertainty on unlinked r2 and an overestimate of the
uncertainty on background LD. In 10,000 permutations, the
unlinked value was always much higher (>10 standard deviations) than the background value.

Modeling; LD: linkage disequilibrium; MAF: minor allele frequency; SNP: single nucleotide polymorphism.

Drug sensitivity
Chloroquine diphosphate-sensitivity assays were performed
as part of an ongoing screen of established P. falciparum
strains against antimalarial drugs in clinical use. Parasites
selected for the assays were derived from the same isolates
that furnished DNA for the genotyping studies. Parasites
were grown and sorbitol-synchronized to the ring stage by
standard methods, and 72-hour drug responsiveness was
measured using a DAPI DNA-staining assay in a 384-well
plate format as previously described [36]. Dose-response
curves were generated using nonlinear-regression fit with

Additional data files

The following additional data are available with the online
version of this paper. Additional data file 1 is a histogram of
SNP call rates. Additional data file 2 is discussion of array performance in the presence of human DNA and malaria DNA
from mixed (non-clonal) infections. Additional data file 3 is a
figure depicting array performance with mixed malaria genotypes. Additional data file 4 is a figure depicting array performance in the presence of human DNA. Concordance with
known genotype can be improved using more stringent confidence cutoff values with the BRLMM-P calling algorithm.
