Abstract
Background: The Euthyneura are considered to be the most successful and diverse group of
Gastropoda. Phylogenetically, they are riven with controversy. Previous morphology-based
phylogenetic studies have been greatly hampered by rampant parallelism in morphological
characters or by incomplete taxon sampling. Based on sequences of nuclear 18S rRNA and 28S
rRNA as well as mitochondrial 16S rRNA and COI DNA from 56 taxa, we reconstructed the
phylogeny of Euthyneura utilising Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The
evolution of colonization of freshwater and terrestrial habitats by pulmonate Euthyneura,
considered crucial in the evolution of this group of Gastropoda, is reconstructed with Bayesian
approaches.
Results: We found several well supported clades within Euthyneura, however, we could not
confirm the traditional classification, since Pulmonata are paraphyletic and Opistobranchia are
either polyphyletic or paraphyletic with several clades clearly distinguishable. Sacoglossa appear
separately from the rest of the Opisthobranchia as sister taxon to basal Pulmonata. Within
Pulmonata, Basommatophora are paraphyletic and Hygrophila and Eupulmonata form
monophyletic clades. Pyramidelloidea are placed within Euthyneura rendering the Euthyneura
paraphyletic.
Conclusion: Based on the current phylogeny, it can be proposed for the first time that invasion
of freshwater by Pulmonata is a unique evolutionary event and has taken place directly from the
marine environment via an aquatic pathway. The origin of colonisation of terrestrial habitats is
seeded in marginal zones and has probably occurred via estuaries or semi-terrestrial habitats such
as mangroves.

Background
Within the phylum Mollusca, Gastropoda represent the
largest and most diverse group in terms of species num-

bers, niche selection and life history strategies. They have
been traditionally classified into three main subclasses:
Prosobranchia, Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata [1-3].

Within Gastropoda, Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata
have been united as Euthyneura and have since Spengel
[4] been contrasted to the Streptoneura (= Prosobranchia). The latter, however, are commonly accepted as
being paraphyletic [5].
Although a plethora of morphological and anatomical
data on Gastropoda have accumulated over the last centuries, it was not until the 1980s that the development of
cladistic methodology allowed for analysing these data in
a phylogenetic framework e. g. [5-9]. Nevertheless,
euthyneuran gastropods have often been neglected in
these studies.
Several new studies based on morphological data have
indicated that Euthyneura is a taxon clearly distinct from
the remaining Gastropoda, belonging to a larger monophyletic group, the Heterobranchia. The latter also
include the paraphyletic Heterostropha [10]. Euthyneura
are characterised by several autapomorphies [11]. However, difficulties with respect to establishing a natural system of Euthyneura are well known [12] and can be
attributed to the large number of homoplasies and convergent evolution of character traits.
Recent phylogenetic studies have focussed on several subgroups of Euthyneura, producing partly conflicting
results.
Pulmonata have been both analysed morphologically
[6,13] and on the basis of molecular data [14,15]. They
have mostly been recovered monophyletic [6,8,11,13,16].
However, phylogenetic relationships of subgroups within
Pulmonata have not been conclusively resolved yet.
[11,17].
Opisthobranchia are often rendered paraphyletic in phylogenetic analyses regardless of morphological or molecular systematic approaches [11,18-22]. Moreover, positions
of enigmatic taxa within the phylogenetic system of
Opisthobranchia, such as the Sacoglossa, Acochlidiacea,
Umbraculoidea or Acteonoidea also remain unresolved
so far [21,22].
To date, no sound phylogenetic hypothesis for the
Euthyneura exists. Recent morphological analyses by
Dayrat and Tillier [11] yielded very poor resolution within
Euthyneura and demonstrated the need to explore new
datasets in order to critically analyse the phylogeny of this
controversial group of gastropods. Upcoming molecular
systematic studies have mostly utilised single genetic
markers comprising partial sequences only [17] or have
not included all major lineages particularly respective to
Pulmonata [19]. These studies only provided limited new
insights into the phylogeny of Euthyneura. However, a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/57

sound phylogenetic hypothesis of a taxon is the prerequisite to reconstruct evolutionary changes in the group of
interest.
To this end, we present an extensive phylogenetic analysis
of the relationships of Euthyneura by using a multi-gene
dataset including nuclear and mitochondrial genes. For
the first time a broad taxon sampling of all major
euthyneuran subgroups is considered. Based on the phylogenetic hypotheses proposed here, we discuss evolutionary trends within Euthyneura. In particular, we propose
new hypotheses how invasion of freshwater and terrestrial
habitats as major evolutionary events of the Gastropoda,
has occurred.

Results
Sequence alignment and statistical tests
In total we aligned sequences of 56 taxa (Table 1) for the
large taxon set and 34 taxa for the reduced taxon set. Due
to ambiguous homologisation of certain nucleotide positions in the alignments we excluded parts of high variability which were mainly due to inserts in certain taxa from
the alignments. The lengths of the obtained alignments
(after removal of ambiguous nucleotide positions) for the
different datasets (complete taxon number versus reduced
taxon number for combined analyses) are shown in Table
2.

Performance of the chi-square-test in PAUP yielded a
homogeneous base composition in the 28S-alignments (P
= 0.999). The 18S- (P = 0.001) and 16S- alignments (P =
0.007) showed heterogeneous base composition mainly
due to the sequences of Nudipleura (Bathydoris clavigera,
Dendronotus dalli, Pleurobranchus peroni, Tomthompsonia
antarctica) (for 18S) and Orbitestellidae (for 16S). The
COI-alignment showed heterogeneous base composition
when using all three codon positions (P = 0.000). However, we identified substitution saturation in the third
codon position (Iss 0.830 >Iss·c 0.771 for large taxon set; Iss
0.753 >Iss·c 0.737 for reduced taxon set) and subsequently
removed third codon positions from the alignments. The
P-value of the chi-square test then changed to 1.00 indicating homogeneous base composition for all taxa.
Additionally, we observed substitution saturation in the
16S-alignments (Iss 1.071 >Iss·c 0.784 for large taxon set;
Iss 1.02 >Iss·c 0.750 for reduced taxon set).
The relative rate test revealed that evolutionary rates are
different in the investigated taxa and genetic markers. This
is especially true for the two ribosomal genes 18S rRNA
and 28S rRNA, where the Nudipleura show extremely
high Z-Scores (e. g. 18S: Dendronotus dalli vs Orbitestella sp.
= 12.19; 28S: Dendronotus dalli vs Turbonilla sp. = 5.34).

Thecosomata and Gymnosomata not represented (Figs. 2

of the COI sequences exhibited varying degrees of substitution saturation we used all sequences in our combined
analyses of the large taxon set (Fig. 1) and the reduced
taxon set (Fig. 3) to avoid the loss of phylogenetic signal

at lower taxonomic levels (e. g. relationships within
superfamilies). In a previous study, Thollesson [18] demonstrated that 16S rRNA sequences provide useful information in recontruction of phylogenetic relationships
within Euthyneura. However, to accommodate substitution saturation and to test its influence on the phylogeny
inferred, we additionally performed combined analyses of
the reduced dataset excluding 16S-sequences and 3rd
codon positions of COI sequences (Fig. 2).

tively long. Additionally, terminal branches of Bathydoris
clavigera and especially Dendronotus dalli are extremely
long indicating high substitution rates in these taxa.
Therefore, this result should be considered with caution.

The second opisthobranch clade comprises the Cephalaspidea as sister to the Umbraculoidea plus Aplysiomorpha (Figs. 2 and 3). When Thecosomata and
Gymnosomata are included (Fig. 1), they represent the

immediate sister taxon to the Aplysiomorpha. The latter
three taxa are sister to Umbraculoidea. The Sacoglossa are
recovered closely related to the Pulmonata as sister to the
Siphonariidae (Figs. 1 and 3). However, support for this
sistergroup relationship is non existent in the analyses of
the reduced dataset. Nevertheless, inclusion of Sacoglossa
within Pulmonata is well supported in all analyses, rendering the Pulmonata paraphyletic. Inclusion of the enigmatic Acochlidiacea in the large taxon placed them within
Pulmonata (Fig. 1).
Within Pulmonata we recovered monophyly for Eupulmonata. Whereas the Bayesian statistical support for a
monophyletic Eupulmonata is rather low in the analysis
of the large taxon set (Fig. 1) possibly due to missing data
in these taxa (especially in Stylommatophora, see Table
1), the combined analyses of the reduced taxon set
showed a high posterior probability (Fig. 2) and additionally high bootstrap support for a monophyletic Eupulmonata (Fig. 3). Within Eupulmonata, Onchidioidea are a
well supported monophyletic clade whereas the Bayesian
posterior probability for a monophyletic Stylommatophora is low in the analysis of the large taxon set probably
due to the reasons mentioned above. Ellobioidea are
poorly supported and their monophyly cannot be recovered unequivocally. Basommatophora are paraphyletic.
Within Basommatophora, Siphonariidae and Hygrophila
are well supported monophyletic taxa.
Two clades can be distinguished within Hygrophila. The
first clade consists of Chilina spp. and Latia neritoides
whereas the second clade is comprised of higher limnic
Basommatophora. The relationships in this latter clade
differ in the different analyses. Within higher limnic Basommatophora only a close relationship of Bulinus tropicus
and Planorbis planorbis is consistent and well supported in
all analyses.
Reconstruction of character evolution
Based on the phylogenetic hypothesis for Euthyneura
deduced with a Bayesian analysis of the reduced data set
we reconstructed the ancestral character states and character evolution relating to habitat types in euthyneuran subgroups.

We calculated posterior probabilities for each of the four
habitat types for certain ancestral nodes within Pulmonata (Fig. 4). It can be seen from this analysis that colonisation of freshwater habitats occurred only once within
Pulmonata by Hygrophila. The ancestor of Hygrophila
probably already occurred in a freshwater habitat. Colonisation of terrestrial habitats in Eupulmonata has its seeds
in marginal zones such as estuaries or mangroves. The
ancestor of Eupulmonata, Amphiboloidea plus Pyramidelloidea and Hygrophila probably already lived in a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/57

marginal habitat as indicated by the high proportion of
posterior probabilities for this habitat type at the respective node (Fig. 4). Otina ovata within Eupulmonata and
Turbonilla sp. both inhabit marine environments.

Discussion
Euthyneura
With the current study we present a comprehensive
molecular phylogenetic analysis of Euthyneura including
representatives of all major subgroups. We used different
approaches to infer a phylogenetic hypothesis for this
taxon of Gastropoda. These approaches yielded for the
most part constant results respective to the deeper nodes
in the tree and indicated only minor differences at generic
or familial level.

The unification of Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata in the
group Euthyneura has been widely accepted since its original definition by Spengel [4]. Consequently, the monophyly of Euthyneura has mostly been accepted in recent
systematic and phylogenetic investigations [5,9,1113,15,23,24]. Although the defining character of
Euthyneura, euthyneury, is considered to be a result of
multiple convergence [16,17], several autapomorphic
characters supporting monophyly have been proposed for
Euthyneura [11,16,17].
Our results contradict a monophyletic Euthyneura, since
Pyramidelloidea are included within euthyneurans as sister group to the Amphiboloidea. This is in congruence
with Grande et al. [19] who found Pyramidelloidea
deeply nested within Pulmonata in their molecular phylogenetic analysis. Although not having included Pyramidelloidea in his molecular phylogenetic analysis of
Euthyneura, Thollesson [18] proposed a possible synapomorphy of Pyramidelloidea and Euthyneura in the presence of a gap in the helix G16 of the 16S rRNA gene, thus
supporting inclusion of Pyramidelloidea within
Euthyneura as proposed here. Studies considering additional pyramidelloid and other basal heterobranch taxa
currently undertaken in the group of the senior author
will hopefully shed more light on the position of the enigmatic
Pyramidelloidea
within
Heterobranchia
(Euthyneura plus Heterostropha sensu Ponder and Waren
[10]). Additionally, new character complexes, such as secondary structures of ribosomal genes, could provide further valuable phylogenetic information for the taxa in
question, as has been demonstrated recently by Lydeard et
al. [25].
Opisthobranchia
Although the separation between Opisthobranchia and
Pulmonata is rather distinct because of e. g. characters of
the nervous system, it has been difficult to propose sound
autapomorphies for a monophyletic Opisthobranchia

[12]. Although the subgroups of Opisthobranchia can be
clearly distinguished and appear to be monophyletic
[21,26-29], monophyly of the Opisthobranchia altogether could not be shown by most recent phylogenetic
analyses, regardless of whether they used morphological
or molecular data [18,19,21,22,30]. The Opisthobranchia
appear to be paraphyletic (cp. e. g. [7,18]) rather than a

natural grouping. Our data confirm this latter assumption
by rendering the Opisthobranchia either polyphyletic or
paraphyletic (depending on the analysis). Filtering our
MCMC trees of the Bayesian analysis of the reduced dataset (including all genes) under the constraint of a monophyletic Opisthobranchia revealed that out of 100.000
trees not one single tree supports a monophyletic

Page 10 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:57

Opisthobranchia. Application of the Approximately
Unbiased test [31] to both reduced datasets also rejected a
monophyletic Opisthobranchia at the 5% significance
level. In contrast, we can distinguish several clades within
Opisthobranchia clearly distinct from each other gradually leading to the pulmonate level of organisation.
One such clade comprises the Nudipleura and Acteonoidea which in our trees appears at the base of the
Euthyneura. Acteonoidea have traditionally been
regarded as the most primitive opisthobranchs or have
even been excluded from Opisthobranchia [22,27,32]
whereas Nudipleura are derived [21,22]. However, this
unexpected grouping of both taxa has recently continuously been revealed by molecular systematic studies.
[20,21,33]. Nevertheless, statistical support in our analyses is rather low and good synapomorphies for this sister
group relationship are still warranted. Moreover, we
observed deviant base composition and rate heterogeneity in Nudipleura which also could attribute to the basal
position of this taxon and possibly artificially groups
them with Acteonoidea.
A second well supported opisthobranch clade in the current analysis of the large taxon set comprises the Cephalaspidea, Umbraculoidea and Aplysiomorpha plus
Thecosomata and Gymnosomata (Pteropoda). This close
grouping of Cephalaspidea, Aplysiomorpha and Pteropoda has been suggested lately by several studies [17,33].
The position of Umbraculoidea within this clade,
although well supported in our current analyses, should
be considered with caution since only one umbraculoid
taxon has been included. Moreover, no morphological
synapomorphies are known to support a close relationship of Umbraculoidea and Aplysiomorpha/Pteropoda.
More umbraculoid taxa must be considered in future studies to clarify the phylogenetic position of this taxon.
The phylogenetic position of Sacoglossa within Opisthobranchia/Euthyneura has been a matter of debate [20-22].
Although morphologically well defined as a monophylum [26,27], different analyses assign Sacoglossa equivocally to different clades within the Euthyneura. Our data
suggest a close affinity to primitive Pulmonata. However,
Sacoglossa are definitely a taxon that needs to be paid
more attention to in future phylogenetic studies.
The same holds true for the Acochlidiacea, an enigmatic
taxon inhabiting interstitial marine habitats and even
freshwater systems, a feature unique within Opisthobranchia. Due to their very small size (often less than
1mm in length) hardly anything is known about their
morphology and life history. Recent morphological investigations utilising modern computer generated 3-D reconstructions [34,35] have shed some light on the anatomy of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/57

these enigmatic gastropods, however, more studies are
warranted. The phylogenetic position of the Acochlidiacea is still unclarified. Vonnemann et al. [21] found them
as a basal taxon within Opisthobranchia, while our results
imply a position within Pulmonata.
Pulmonata
The monophyly of Pulmonata is widely accepted on the
basis of morphological characters [6,7,11,13,16]. In contrast, our data suggest paraphyly of Pulmonata due to the
inclusion of Sacoglossa, Pyramidelloidea and possibly
Acochlidiacea. If our phylogenetic hypothesis is correct,
one must postulate that pulmonate autapomorphies
(such as acquisition of a pneumostome and pulmonary
vessels as well as the presence of a procerebrum and dorsal
bodies) have secondarily been reduced in Sacoglossa,
Acochlidiacea and Pyramidelloidea.

Paraphyly or even polyphyly of Pulmonata was recovered
by molecular systematic studies [14,19,36].
Within Pulmonata we can distinguish two monophyletic
clades: Eupulmonata and Hygrophila. The unification of
Siphonarioidea and Amphiboloidea in the Thalassophila
based on morphological data [13] could not be confirmed
by our data.
The Eupulmonata comprise a group of marine, semi-terrestrial and truly terrestrial gastropods showing a high
diversity with regards to species number and life history
characters. Monophyly of this taxon is strongly supported
by Wade and Mordan [15] and the present results, however no morphological apomorphy is known to date
[9,10]. Relationships within Eupulmonata have been disputed in the past. Monophyly of Stylommatophora is
undoubted [11,13-15,17,37] and can be supported by
several autapomorphies [11,13]. Our results also show a
monophyletic Stylommatophora. Haszprunar and Huber
[16] proposed a close relationship of Ellobiidae, Trimusculidae and Stylommatophora on the basis of apomorphic characters of the nervous system, whereas Dayrat and
Tillier [11,12] consider Stylommatophora and Systellommatophora (Onchidioidea and Veronicelloidea) to be
closely related. Neither of these two hypotheses are confirmed by our findings since we find a close relationship
between ellobioid taxa, Otinoidea, Onchidioidea and
Trimusculoidea. The phylogenetic status of the Ellobioidea cannot be conclusively clarified from our data since
they appear to be paraphyletic in the two analyses utilising all sequence data. Exclusion of 16S-sequences and 3rd
codon positions of COI-sequences, however, recovers
them monophyletic.
The Basommatophora sensu Nordsieck [13] and Bouchet
et al. [38] are paraphyletic in our analyses. No topology in

Page 11 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:57

our set of 100.000 MCMC trees of the Bayesian analysis of
the reduced dataset supports a monophyletic Basommatophora. Moreover, testing an alternative tree topology
with a constrained monophyletic Basommatophora with
the Approximately Unbiased test [31] rejected monophyly
of Basommatophora at the significance level of 5%. This
is not surprising since the monophyly of Basommatophora has already been disputed by Hubendick [39].
Within Basommatophora the Hygrophila are a well supported and defined group of pulmonates. Our results support earlier hypotheses of a common origin of these
freshwater taxa [12,13,17,40]. For the first time, however,
crucial taxa like Latia are included in a molecular study.
Within Hygrophila two clades can be distinguished; on
the one hand the Chilinoidea (sensu Boss [3], including
Chilinidae and Latiidae), and on the other the higher limnic Basommatophora. Chilina and Latia are sister-species,
a relationship that has already been mentioned earlier
[13,39,41]. Higher limnic Basommatophora can be
divided into four well distinguishable families [39] while
interfamilial relationships of these taxa vary in the current
analyses thus rendering them beyond the scope of this
study. These relationships are discussed in other publications [42,43].
Former taxonomic classifications of Pulmonata united a
group of primitive taxa (Ellobiidae, Otinidae, Amphibolidae, Siphonariidae, Chilinidae and Latiidae) in the
Archaeopulmonata [44]. Other authors followed this classification [6,3,45]. However, our results clearly indicate a
paraphyletic nature of these taxa and therefore we propose the disuse of the name Archaeopulmonata.
Colonisation of freshwater and terrestrial habitats
One key step in the evolution of Euthyneura was the invasion of freshwater and terrestrial habitats by Pulmonata
resulting in a multitude of taxa worldwide adapted to
these habitats. It is undisputed that the first pulmonate
gastropods were marine organisms [12,46]. Marine pulmonates can be found in truly marine submersed environments (such as Williamia) and, more frequently, in upper
littoral zones (Siphonaria, Myosotella, Trimusculus). Certain
taxa even occur in estuaries or mangroves (Onchidiidae,
certain Ellobiidae, Amphibolidae). Terrestrial pulmonates
inhabit a wide spectrum of habitats, ranging from caves to
lowlands to mountains and from boreal to tropical ecological zones. The same holds true for freshwater taxa,
which occur in different types of limnic environments
worldwide.

Our reconstruction of character evolution relating to habitat type (Fig. 4) shows that within Pulmonata the freshwater habitat has only been conquered once by the
Hygrophila. Calculation of posterior probabilities for the
different habitat types at specific nodes indicates that the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/57

ancestor of Hygrophila probably already lived in a freshwater habitat. Acknowledging that there are extremely few
onchidioidean species reported to live in brackish or
freshwater it would not change the picture that the major
radiation into freshwater happened only once leading to
the Hygrophila. The same is true for the few acochlidiaceans that are known from freshwater habitats. Freshwater members of both taxa were not included in our data
set, for the time being, we would also hypothesize a similar evolutionary pathway excluding a terrestrial step.
In non-pulmonates, the situation is different. 'Prosobranchs', such as the superfamily Cerithoidea, comprise
predominantly marine taxa. Nevertheless, freshwater was
invaded independently in several cerithoid lineages [47].
Even the evolution of life history traits such as viviparity
in the freshwater invaders was correlated with this evolutionary step [48].
The ancestor of Eupulmonata and Hygrophila, in contrast, appears to have lived in a marginal zone like
supralittoral zones, estuaries or mangroves. Therefore we
conclude, that colonisation of freshwater in Pulmonata
occurred via an aquatic pathway directly from the marine
realm and not via a terrestrial step.
The terrestrial habitats have most probably also been
invaded via marginal zones, as can be seen from the Bayesian reconstruction of ancestral character states in Eupulmonata. Involvement of freshwater systems in
colonisation of terrestrial habitats is less likely, since the
freshwater taxa (Hygrophila) are clearly separated from
Eupulmonata and the posterior probability for a freshwater habitat is basically non-existant at the base of the
Eupulmonata.
Terrestriality on the contrary is thought to have evolved
much more than 10 times independently (discussed in
Barker [49]). Barker [49] already emphasized that recent
ellobiid terrestriality was clearly derived from marine littoral ancestors and not secondarily from terrestrial ancestors.
Invasion of marine habitats by Otina ovata within Eupulmonata and Turbonilla sp. obviously is the result of a secondary colonisation originating in marginal zones.

Conclusion
Euthyneura are considered the crown group of Gastropoda. Within this taxon Gastropoda have reached their
peak in species richness and ecological diversity. This
obvious evolutionary success can probably be attributed
to several factors. Marine Opisthobranchia, e. g., have
evolved several clades specialised on less utilised food
resources such as sponges or cnidarians. A key innovation

Page 12 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:57

in the evolution of Pulmonata was the colonization of
freshwater and terrestrial habitats.
Previously published phylogenies [11,17,19] did not
allow an exact inference of possible pathways respective to
pulmonate distribution. Up to now, it was not clear
whether the invasion of freshwater happened directly
from the marine environment or via a terrestrial step.
Based on our phylogenetic hypothesis of Euthyneura and
especially Pulmonata we are now able to trace an evolutionary scenario regarding colonisation of different habitats by these Gastropoda.
Our study on the phylogeny of Euthyneura has clearly
shown, that traditional classification of these Gastropoda
needs to be reconsidered. We were able to present well
supported clades and reconstructed the evolutionary history of these clades regarding invasion of habitats and
occupation of ecological niches. This should serve as the
basis for future discussions on the evolution of this successful group of gastropod molluscs.

Methods
Taxon sampling and specimen collection
A total of 53 representative taxa of most major extant lineages of Euthyneura were included in the current phylogenetic study. Additionally, we included two basal
heterobranch species (Turbonilla sp. and Orbitestella sp.) as
well as the caenogastropod Littorina littorea. Specimens
were collected from different locations worldwide (for
details see Table 1). They were collected from the field by
hand, snorkelling or scuba diving, preserved in 80–100%
ethanol and stored cooled until further processing.

For some taxa (Stylommatophora, Amphibolidae, Ellobiidae, Opisthobranchia and Littorinidae) we obtained
published sequences from Genbank). Accession numbers
of all sequences used in the analyses are listed in Table 1.
DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from muscle tissue or entire
animals using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) or the protocol given in [43]. Voucher depositions are listed in Additional file 1. We amplified fragments of four genes, including 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, 16S
rDNA and COI. For details of primers used and PCR protocols see Additional file 2.

After the amplification products were purified from an
agarose gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit from
Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). The DNA was subjected to
cycle sequencing using the ABI Prism Big Dye terminator
kit (Perking-Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) or the CEQ DTCS
Quick Start Kit (Krefeld, Germany). DNA sequences were
obtained with an ABI 377 automated DNA sequencer at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/57

the Scientific Research Lab, Frankfurt/Main and by using
a CEQ 2000 Beckmann Coulter sequencer. All fragments
were sequenced in both directions using the same primer
sequences as used for the PCR. For 18S and 28S several
internal primers were used (Additional file 3).
Sequence alignment
Sequence alignments were performed with CLUSTAL W
implemented in the software package BioEdit Version
7.0.5 [50]. Default parameters were used but subsequent
manual correction was necessary and was performed with
BioEdit. Table 2 provides an overview on the number of
taxa and lengths of the sequence alignments used in the
analyses. Several base positions have been excluded from
the alignments of 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and 16S rRNA (for
details see Table 2) prior to reconstructing phylogeny due
to inserts in certain taxa or due to high variability within
the alignments (especially in the 28S- and 16S-fragment).
Statistical tests
We investigated base compositions by means of the software PAUP 4.0b10 [51]. To test the degree of substitution
saturation we used the test of Xia et al. [52], as implemented in the software package DAMBE [53]. A relative
rate test was performed with the software k2WuLi [54] in
order to test for rate heterogeneity in the sequences. In
order to examine whether there are significant differences
in incongruence length between the four datasets, a
homogeneity-partition test implemented in PAUP 4.0b10
[51] was performed. Alternative tree topologies were
tested for the reduced taxon sets using the Approximately
Unbiased (AU) test [31]. The likelihood at each nucleotide position was calculated for each alternative topology
(constrained monophyletic Opisthobranchia, constrained monophyletic Basommatophora) as well as the
topology under scrutiny using PAUP 4.0b10 [51]. Likelihoods were used to calculate p-values using CONSEL version 0.1 [55].
Phylogenetic analyses
Prior to phylogenetic analyses, we determined the optimal model of sequence evolution for each of the four partitions and each of the taxon sets using Modeltest 3.7 [56]
based on the Akaike information criterion (for details of
the models determined refer to Table 2).

We applied several different analyses to our data. First, we
used a concatenated alignment of all four partitions
including all taxa for which sequences were available
(large taxon sets). Missing sequences for certain taxa in
certain partitions were coded as missing data in the
respective alignments.
Secondly, we also followed a more conservative approach
by analysing a combined dataset of all four partitions with

Page 13 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:57

only those taxa for which sequences of all partitions were
available (reduced taxon set, 34 taxa). For all analyses
Bayesian inference methods were applied with Mr Bayes
3_03b [57], using separate models of evolution for each of
the four partions. The tree space was explored using four
chains of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (one
cold, three heated) for 1,000000 generations. Likelihoods
of the trees started at around -67470 and quickly converged upon a stable value of about -54600 after approximately 7,000 generations. Thus we computed a 50%
majority rule consensus tree with the first 1,000 trees (=
10,000 generations) ignored as burn-in. Posterior probabilities were calculated for each node in the tree. We consider a BPP value of 0.95 and higher to give good support
to a node.

Reconstruction of character evolution
We reconstructed character evolution regarding habitat
types with a Bayesian approach as implemented in the
BayesTraits software package [59]. The BayesMultiState
option allows to automatically find posterior distribution
of models of evolution using the reversible-jump MCMC
method. Ancestral character states were reconstructed for
selected nodes in the phylogeny resulting in respective
probabilities of all character states for that node. Data on
habitat types colonised by the investigated taxa were taken
from the literature. Information on coding for individual
taxa can be taken from Additional file 4. Rate deviation
was set to 8.0. A hyperprior approach was used with exponential prior seeded from a uniform on the intervall 0 to
30. Thus, acceptance rates between 20 and 30 % were
achieved, which are in the preferred range.
