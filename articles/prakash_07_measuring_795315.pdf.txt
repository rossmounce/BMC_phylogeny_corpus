Abstract

We present a method to assess a whole-genome multiple
sequence alignment, classifying it into well aligned and suspiciously aligned regions. Before carrying out any further analysis that relies on the alignment's correctness, such as those
listed above, the user should be aware of possible misalignment in those regions classified as suspicious. In addition,
efforts should be made to either realign the regions with suspicious alignments or increase the confidence in their current
alignments by other evidence.
Without any well established methodology for estimating the
quality of the whole-genome alignments, scientists have
either trusted the alignments completely or developed their
own filters. Such filters usually involve a conservation threshold (for example, a high phastCons conservation score [8,10])
and thus filter out most of the genomic sequence, limiting the
scope of their analysis to only the regions that have high

information

When such methods find surprisingly well conserved sites
across all aligned species, that portion of the alignment is
likely to be correct. Conversely, in regions where the
sequences are misaligned, these methods may fail to find conserved sites that exist. Even the designers of the alignment
algorithms and genome browsers would not claim that the

alignments are correct at all sites across entire genomes. How
can users decide which portions of the alignment are trustworthy and which portions less so, particularly in noncoding
regions?

interactions

With the rapid sequencing of so many related genomes, comparative genomics has emerged as one of the most important
areas of computational biology. The workhorse of comparative genomics is the multiple sequence alignment, particularly whole-genome multiple sequence alignments such as
those provided by the UCSC Genome Browser [1]. These
alignments are marvelous tools for anyone working in comparative genomics. More and more sophisticated analyses
rely implicitly on the correctness of these alignments. For
example, it is already standard practice to search for functional genomic elements (more precisely, those constrained
by purifying selection) by scanning a whole-genome alignment, looking for regions that are better conserved across the
species than expected [2-12].

Background

deposited research

Whole-genome alignments are invaluable for comparative genomics. Before doing any comparative
analysis on a region of interest, one must have confidence in that region's alignment. We provide
a methodology to measure the accuracy of arbitrary regions of these alignments, and apply it to the
UCSC Genome Browser's 17-vertebrate alignment. We identify 9.7% (21 Mbp) of the human
chromosome 1 alignment as suspiciously aligned. We present independent evidence that many of
these suspicious regions represent misalignments.

sequence similarity. Our work is the first that assigns alignment 'quality scores' to all portions of the whole-genome
alignments. Using these, we have a measure of the level of
trust in any region of the alignment, including those that have
low sequence similarity. Thus, any comparative analysis can
be carried out on much more of the genome than just those
regions with high sequence similarity. Also, for the first time,
we have a quantitative measure of how well a multiple alignment tool such as MULTIZ (the alignment tool used by the
UCSC Genome Browser) performs on a whole-genome scale.
We note in this regard that the UCSC whole-genome multiple
alignments are already annotated with phastCons conservation scores [9]. However, these scores serve a different purpose than our alignment quality scores: phastCons measures
how well conserved each column of aligned residues is, under
the assumption that the alignment is correct, that is, that
aligned residues are indeed orthologous. The same statement
applies to the measures 'binomial p-value' and 'parsimony pvalue' proposed by Margulies et al. [5] and GERP [3] and
Gumby [13] scores. In contrast, the purpose of our alignment
quality scores is to assess the likelihood that the alignment is
correct. So, for instance, a low phastCons score in an alignment segment that also has a poor alignment quality score
does not necessarily mean poor conservation across the species, since the alignment may well be incorrect in this region.
The same is true for the other four conservation scores mentioned above.
The statistics of local pairwise alignments [14,15] are well
understood and have been extended to local multiple alignments [16]. These statistics are based on a few well conserved
parts of the alignment, for example, protein domains, and
report the statistical significance of these parts only. This cannot be used for our task on whole-genome alignments,
because a whole-genome (or whole-chromosome) alignment
will nearly always contain some very strongly conserved
regions [2]. Thus, only these regions would be reported as statistically significant, with no information given about the
remainder of the alignment. Unfortunately, there has been no
methodology that measures the accuracy of every region of a
multiple sequence alignment separately. (Yu and Smith [17]
proposed a method based on hidden Markov models for
doing this in pairwise alignments.) Solving this problem is
critical in whole-genome alignments, because the search
space for good alignments is huge due to genome rearrangements. Thus, there is a high probability that some regions will
be misaligned even if most of the alignment is correct.
In previous work [16] we presented a tool, StatSigMA, to
assess whether a multiple sequence alignment is contaminated with one or more unrelated sequences. In this work, we
extend those ideas to the tool StatSigMA-w, which performs
this assessment for every region of a multiple sequence alignment, and show its application to whole-chromosome
alignments.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R124

There are different ways that alignments can be incorrect, in
the sense of not pairing all and only orthologous residues.
There can be orthologies that are not aligned (false negatives
of the alignment algorithm) and nonorthologies that are
aligned (false positives of the alignment algorithm). StatSigMA-w is designed to measure the latter. These false positives can be further classified as 'small' errors (for example,
one residue placed at the wrong end of a gap) or 'large' errors
(for example, a region of 100 residues of one sequence aligned
to regions of other sequences to which it is unrelated).
Because StatSigMA is designed to detect contamination of a
multiple sequence alignment by unrelated sequences, the
focus of this work is on the latter, 'large' errors.
The UCSC Genome Browser provides whole-genome alignments for vertebrates, insects, and yeast. Of these, we evaluate the quality of the 17-vertebrate MULTIZ [18] alignment
(to human genome assembly NCBI Build 36.1, UCSC hg18,
March 2006) using StatSigMA-w. The 17 vertebrates are
human, chimp, rhesus, rabbit, mouse, rat, dog, cow, armadillo, elephant, tenrec, opossum, chicken, frog, tetraodon,
fugu, and zebrafish.
In the Results section we focus on the alignment of human
chromosome 1 as a proof of concept. We identify 9.7% (21
Mbp) of this alignment as suspiciously aligned. We present
independent evidence to support our claim that the suspicious regions may be misaligned. Overall, our work confirms
that MULTIZ is doing an impressive job of aligning
sequences. However, there are instances when it fails and
these can be identified using StatSigMA-w.

Results and discussion
StatSigMA
The method used in this work extends our earlier tool StatSigMA [16], which assesses whether a multiple sequence
alignment is contaminated with one or more unrelated
sequences. There are several interesting problems in extending StatSigMA to assess the accuracy of all portions of a
whole-genome alignment. We summarize the methodology of
StatSigMA in this section and then describe its extension to
StatSigMA-w in the subsequent sections.
Given a multiple alignment and a phylogeny relating its
sequences, StatSigMA computes a p-value for each of several
null hypothesis cases. There is one null hypothesis case for
each branch k of the phylogeny. In the null hypothesis case k,
branch k exhibits 'unrelated behavior', that is, the subalignments corresponding to the two subtrees separated by the
removal of k are independent rather than homologous. The
assumption made is that, after rejecting all these cases, we
can infer that the multiple alignment shows all the sequences
are related. The algorithm followed by StatSigMA is outlined
below. These steps are described in detail elsewhere (A.P. and

We precompute this score for all tuples at the leaves of the
tree. The various probability terms in Equation 1 are computed using the dynamic programming algorithm of Felsenstein [21].

Appropriate phylogeny

Appropriate context
The context for a local alignment is defined as the genomic
sequences that were considered to create that alignment. For
example, we may take genomic sequences of length 1 Mbp
each from human and fugu, which may result in a local alignment of length 100 bp. Thus, the context for this 100 bp alignment is one million residues each for human and fugu.
Choosing the appropriate context is critical for the correct
evaluation of p-values. A statistically significant alignment in

information

Choosing the appropriate phylogeny is important for the
accurate computation of p-values. In the case of pairwise
alignments, without any information about the appropriate
scoring matrix, BLAST [22] computes the p-value using multiple scoring matrices, and then corrects for multiple hypotheses. Using similar ideas, we use multiple trees to cover the

interactions

Pr( β1 ,..., β i t1 , M )Pr( β i +1 ,..., β S t2 , M )

Using StatSigMA's score function and the algorithm to find
maximal scoring segments by Ruzzo and Tompa [19], we can
identify all maximal, positively scoring segments in the
whole-genome alignment. Each such segment can be a high
scoring slice of a MULTIZ block or can overlap multiple MULTIZ blocks. Thus, it is possible that neighboring columns of a
maximal scoring segment may contain different sets of species. For the rest of the paper, the word 'segments' refers to
these maximal positively scoring segments. The score sck,S of
segment S is simply the sum, over the columns of S, of the log
likelihood score of each column given by Equation 1. Here we
make the assumption that the scoring function precomputed
for branch k is accurate even when only a subset of species is
aligned, so that we can add scores of columns that contain different sets of species.

refereed research

The log likelihood scores in the first step take into account the
phylogeny. These scores are computed as follows. Suppose we
have S sequences in a multiple alignment related by a phylogenetic tree T (having branch lengths). Let γ1, γ2, ..., γS be the
residues observed at a particular column of the multiple
alignment. Suppose we want to test the hypothesis that there
is unrelated behavior on branch k. Suppose the removal of
branch k separates T into subtrees t1 (having residues β1, β2,
..., βi at the leaves) and t2 (having residues βi+1, βi+2, ..., βS at
the leaves). Let M be the evolutionary model. Then, analogous
to the Karlin-Altschul log likelihood score [14], the score for
observing this column of the multiple alignment is as follows:

The MULTIZ whole-genome alignment is built with human as
the reference species. This alignment consists of chains of
aligned blocks. The aligned blocks themselves may contain
only a subset of the species. For example, for some human
sequence, the aligned block may contain sequence from
chimp and not from fugu. Human, being the reference species, is present in every block. As in StatSigMA [16], the null
hypothesis case k refers to branch k of the phylogeny demonstrating unrelated behavior, and thus splitting the tree into
two subtrees, t1 and t2, whose corresponding subalignments
are independent. If a MULTIZ block does not contain any
sequence from t1 or does not contain any sequence from t2,
then that block is not considered for branch k.

deposited research

Analogous to a p-value, the discordance is between 0 and 1,
and the lower its value, the better the alignment (in the sense
of not being contaminated with unrelated sequences).

variations in the rate of evolution across the genome. We start
with the phylogeny estimated from four-way degenerate sites
(that is, third codon positions) in the ENCODE [23] regions
(Adam Siepel, personal communication), whose branch
lengths correspond to neutral evolution. (This phylogeny is
available on our worldwide web site [24].) We use three versions of this tree, one with the original branch lengths, one
with branch lengths multiplied by 100 (to account for regions
evolving faster than third codon positions), and one with
branch lengths multiplied by 0.01 (to account for regions
under purifying selection, for example, coding regions). Separate p-values are computed using each of the three trees, and
the final score at a site is the minimum of the three, corrected
for multiple hypotheses.

a context of length L may be insignificant had the context
length been 10L. (See Materials and methods for the exact
dependence of the p-value on L.) In theory, as a multiple
alignment tool proceeds to create an alignment, it can identify
the context that it is using to output the alignment. However,
it is unclear how to infer the original context from the completed alignment.
To solve this problem, we estimate the p-value of the score
sck,S of segment S using all possible contexts W and then maximize over W; see Materials and methods for details of the pvalue formulas. The reason for maximization over W is that,
if even one context has a p-value greater than the threshold at
which the null hypothesis is rejected, then the null hypothesis
should not be rejected.
In order to evaluate the p-value in all possible contexts efficiently, we exploit strongly conserved genomic anchors.
Throughout the genome, we expect to see very strongly conserved long segments (for example, certain coding exons). In
fact, these segments are so highly conserved that their alignments to the orthologous regions in other species are statistically significant even if we compute the p-value of the score of
this single segment in the context of the entire genome, that
is, without any support from synteny. Once we have identified
these anchors, for segments between anchors A and B, we
need to consider only contexts that lie between A and B. This
is because the p-values of the scores of the neighboring
anchors are an upper bound on the p-value with respect to
any context that contains them (see Materials and methods).
Once we have computed the p-value of a segment's score, we
can also treat that segment as an anchor for the later stages
(for the purposes of upper bounding the p-value of nearby
segments whose p-values are still to be computed). This gives
rise to a divide-and-conquer algorithm that simultaneously
defines appropriate contexts and estimates p-values for all
regions of any multiple alignment (see Materials and methods for details of the algorithm).

and M.T., Assessing the discordance of multiple sequence
alignments, unpublished work). Because such models reflect
an incomplete understanding of evolution, they may cause
the method described thus far to underestimate the statistical
significance of certain regions, for example, those containing
long insertions or deletions, or short low scoring alignments
flanked by high scoring alignments. The latter problem is
exacerbated by the fact that the extreme value distributon
used to compute the p-values does not hold for very small
contexts. Also, we are interested in studying longer regions
that are misaligned rather than misalignments of a few residues. With these motivations, we consider only those regions
that: are at least 50 bp in length; and have discordance at least
0.1 at all sites; with the same branch being the worst one, that
is, this branch corresponds to the maximum p-value at each
site. (This can result in overlapping regions corresponding to
different branches, in the case of a tie for greatest p-value.) To
eliminate regions that would be labeled insignificant due to
long insertions and deletions, we filter out regions that contain more than 50% gap columns for either of the two subsets
of species separated by the worst branch. The regions remaining are the ones that StatSigMA-w reports as having suspicious alignment. For the remainder of the paper, the term
'suspicious regions' refers to these remaining high discordance regions, and we denote the set of suspicious regions by
ℜ. The suspicious regions that are attributable to any branch
on the path from zebrafish (for example) to human are
denoted by ℜzebrafish; these are regions where zebrafish (and
possibly other species) appear misaligned to human.
The decisions incorporated in the definition of ℜ are purposely conservative. Any region labeled 'suspicious' has at
least 50 consecutive alignment columns for which a single
branch exhibits unrelated behavior. There are no long insertions or deletions with respect to this branch, so the label of
'suspicious' is not attributable solely to the manner in which
the evolution of gaps is modeled.

Suspicious regions in chromosome 1
Identifying suspicious regions of the alignment
The p-value of a single site for a branch k is the p-value of the
score of the segment that contains that site for the null hypothesis case k. After computing the p-value for every branch of
the phylogeny and for every segment, we identify the branch
(or branches, in case of a tie) having the greatest p-value for
each site: this maximum p-value is the 'discordance' of that
site. This method outputs the discordance of every aligned
site, and the worst branch(es) for that site. Finally, at each
site, the least discordance among the three trees (multiplied
by 3 for Bonferroni correction) is the final discordance value.
We take 0.1 as the threshold for identifying sites with high
discordance, as discussed in the next section.
The scoring function of Equation 1 is based on an evolutionary model, including evolution of gaps as single residue insertions or deletions, as described in earlier work [16] (and A.P.

In this section, we present the results obtained by analyzing
the MULTIZ 17-vertebrate alignment of chromosome 1 of the
human genome. Chromosome 1 is 247 Mbp long, nearly 8% of
the human genome. We took the MULTIZ alignment of this
chromosome with the other 16 vertebrates, and computed pvalues for all branches of the three phylogenies and for all
segments.
For four representative branches, Figure 1 plots the fraction
of sites in maximal scoring segments of length at least 50 bp
against the p-value of that segment's score. As can be seen,
the graphs are bimodal, that is, most columns either have pvalue greater than 0.1 or less than 10-4. The graphs show that
a threshold of 0.1 can be used to differentiate low p-value segment scores from high p-value segment scores, and this classification would hardly change if the threshold were instead
10-2 or 10-4.

As described in the previous paragraph, 16.9% of suspicious
regions in ℜzebrafish overlap annotated human exons. Of these,
770 regions in ℜzebrafish overlap the coding exons of 562
human genes. This suggests that the alignment is incorrectly
aligning a human coding sequence and a sequence from
zebrafish. To test this hypothesis, we took each human coding
sequence aligned to a region in ℜzebrafish, translated it using its
annotated reading frame to yield its amino acid sequence, and
used this as a BLASTX query against the aligned zebrafish
nucleotide sequence. BLASTX translates the zebrafish
nucleotide sequence in all six reading frames, aligns each of
them to the human amino acid sequence, and reports the best
E-value among all six pairwise alignments. Figure 4a plots the
distribution of these E-values for ℜzebrafish. To contrast this to
the distribution for well aligned sequences, we took those
parts of the alignment that include zebrafish, have discordance at most 10-10, and intersect some human coding exon.
The distribution of BLASTX E-values for these parts is also
plotted in Figure 4a. Finally, the distribution when the

The last column of Table 1 provides the number and percentage of residues in ℜ that have a phastCons score greater than
0.5. The UCSC phastCons [9] track measures the level of conservation of any site in an alignment, and a score greater than
0.5 means that the site is more likely to be in the conserved
state than the nonconserved state. Considering, for example,
the human residues aligned to zebrafish, it can be seen that
19% of the residues in ℜzebrafish have high phastCons scores. In
general, the high percentages for the nonmammals in the last
column are likely to correspond to regions where the
mammals are well conserved but the given nonmammal may
be misaligned. We did a separate test of phastCons on synthetic data, using the same parameter values that were used
to compute the conservation score for the 17-vertebrate MULTIZ alignment. If all but one sequence are identical, and the
remaining sequence is less than 50% identical to the others,
phastCons can still report a very high conservation score at
every site, including those where the last sequence is not iden-

Figure 3 presents a pie chart showing the distribution of
genomic locations of the suspicious regions in ℜzebrafish and
ℜmouse. These are based on the annotations of the aligned
human regions available on the UCSC Genome Browser. The
majority of the suspicious regions lie far from genes or in
introns. For zebrafish, a small percentage (16.9%) are aligned
to human exons. This is in contrast to the fact that nearly 35%
of the chromosome 1 alignments containing zebrafish lie in
human exons. Only 2.4% of ℜmouse regions are aligned to
human exons, in contrast to the fact that nearly 6% of the
chromosome 1 alignments containing mouse lie in human
exons. This is consistent with the intuition that misalignments will be rarer in exons than in noncoding regions. The
overlap of suspicious regions with coding sequences does
point out, however, that misalignments can be misleading,
especially if the alignment is being used to infer functional
annotation in one species from another.

deposited research

Table 1 provides a breakdown of the residues of human chromosome 1 in ℜ with respect to the other species. For example,
28.5% of the human residues aligned to zebrafish have a suspicious zebrafish alignment (that is, belong to ℜzebrafish). Considering the human alignments containing mouse,
approximately 3.3% have a suspicious alignment with mouse.
In general, the nonprimates each have 1-5 Mbp in suspicious
regions, and the percentage of residues in suspicious regions
increases (approximately) with increasing phylogenetic distance from humans. This suggests increasing difficulty of correct alignment as this distance increases. In total, ℜ contains
185,452 regions, varying in size from 50 bp to 3,121 bp, with
mean 115 bp. The total number of residues contained in ℜ is
more than 21 Mbp and accounts for 9.7% of the aligned
human chromosome 1.

Figure 2 provides an example of a MULTIZ alignment block
in ℜzebrafish. Lower case letters in this multiple alignment indicate disagreement with the human sequence. StatSigMA-w's
reported discordance is 1 at every site in this block, the branch
incident on zebrafish being responsible for this high value. In
contrast, the phastCons conservation score is 1 at every
human site in this block, despite the lack of conservation in
the zebrafish sequence. (Recall that a StatSigMA-w discordance of 1 suggests misalignment, whereas a phastCons score
of 1 indicates strong conservation.) This exemplifies the discussion in the previous paragraph that a high phastCons score
does not imply correct alignment. In this region, the high
phastCons score is due to very strong conservation not only
among the mammals, but including chicken as well.

In a more global sense, though, the MULTIZ coding alignments are better than Figure 4 suggests. When we repeat the
BLASTX experiment on the entire annotated human exon
rather than just the exon fragment aligned to the ℜzebrafish
region, the BLASTX E-value graph looks much more like the
low discordance graph of Figure 4a. This suggests that MULTIZ usually aligns a homologous zebrafish exon, but misaligns the fragments of these exons that are in ℜzebrafish.

To analyze these exonic regions using a different criterion, we
searched the aligned zebrafish sequence in all three forward
reading frames to compute the percentage of frameshifted
codons (because of many insertions and deletions in the
alignment). We used the reading frame that led to the least
percentage of frameshifted codons. Figure 5 plots the distribution of this percentage for the regions in ℜzebrafish. To contrast this to the distribution for well aligned sequences, we
took those parts of the alignment that include zebrafish, have
discordance at most 10-10, and intersect some human coding
exon. This distribution is also plotted in Figure 5. Like Figure
4, Figure 5 clearly shows that the two distributions are very
different, and the suspicious regions have much more dubious alignments than the low discordance regions.

reports

(based on where the low discordance and suspicious curves
cross in Figure 4a) that a BLASTX E-value at most 10-4 indicates a correct alignment, then of the 770 predicted zebrafish
suspicious regions aligned to a human exon, only 5.3% are in
fact correctly aligned (compared to 93% of the low discordance regions).

Results on simulated data
In order to measure further the sensitivity and specificity of
StatSigMA-w's predictions of suspicious regions, we also performed experiments on simulated data. Such experiments
have the advantage that we know exactly what is correctly
aligned and what is misaligned. The simulated data were provided by Mathieu Blanchette (personal communication).
They consist of a set of 25 correct multiple sequence
alignments, each of length approximately 100 Kb. Each alignment results from the concatenation of two data sets obtained
by simulation of evolution according to the procedure
described by Blanchette et al. [18] and summarized as follows. Each simulation begins with a random ancestral
sequence and lets it evolve along the branches of a given phylogeny until it produces sequences at the leaves. The phylogeny used is that for the nine mammals human, chimp,
baboon, mouse, rat, dog, cat, cow, and pig. By keeping track
of the mutations performed, it is straightforward to produce
the true alignment of orthologous residues and gaps. These
are the alignments from which our experiments began.
From each of these alignments we discarded all the gaps and
aligned the resulting sequences using TBA. (TBA is a generalization of MULTIZ in which there is no special reference
sequence. Both algorithms are described in the same paper
[18].) By comparing this TBA alignment to the true alignment, we determined exactly where TBA misaligned residues,
in the sense that such a residue in human is aligned to a nonorthologous residue in another species. Analogous to the

definition of a suspicious region, define a 'misalignment
region' as any contiguous set of 50 or more columns in the
TBA alignment in which a single species' residues are misaligned to human in every column. Regions with more than
50% gap characters in the misaligned species were ignored.
We next submitted the TBA alignment to StatSigMA-w, which
computed p-values and suspicious regions as described
above. Our goal was to assess the specificity (fraction of suspicious regions actually misaligned) and sensitivity (fraction
of misalignment regions reported as suspicious) for these
StatSigMA-w predictions. The results are given in the four
histograms of Figure 6. These histograms show averages over
the 25 simulated data sets. Because TBA rarely misaligned
chimp or baboon with human, histograms are given only for
the other six species.
Figure 6a,b presents specificity results, reporting information
about the distribution of suspicious regions. For each suspicious region reported by StatSigMA-w, we measured the percentage of columns of that region that are actually
misaligned. This percentage is shown on the horizontal axis.
In Figure 6a, the misalignment is required to be in the same
species as a species responsible for the suspicious region; that
is, if the suspicious region is attributable to branch k, then k
must lie on the path from the misaligned species to human. In
Figure 6b, the misalignment could be in any species. The reason for our interest in the latter is that it is sometimes the case
that a misalignment in pig (say) may cause StatSigMA-w to

report that cow appears suspiciously aligned, particularly if
the cow sequence is sufficiently diverged from human. In any
case, drawing attention to any misalignment by labeling it as
suspicious should be helpful to the alignment user.

It is possible that some of the regions that we report as suspiciously aligned may indeed be correctly aligned. The sequence
similarity may be too low to establish confidence in the
alignment, but it may still be correct. In such cases we need
additional evidence to trust the alignment and use it as the
basis for comparative sequence analyses.

information

The results shown in Figure 6 are quite encouraging. A very
large fraction of reported suspicious regions have at least 90%
of their columns misaligned and, conversely, for a very large
fraction of misalignment regions StatSigMA-w reports at
least 90% of their columns to have high p-values.

In this work, we analyzed the 17-vertebrate MULTIZ alignment of human chromosome 1. On the whole, MULTIZ is
doing a good job of aligning orthologous sequences. However,
9.7% of the alignment is identified as suspiciously aligned by
our method. We present independent evidence that many of
these suspicious regions represent misalignments. This evidence is for coding sequences, which should be the simplest
to align, and thus can be treated as a lower bound on the percentage of misalignments. Extrapolating to the entire
genome, 3.2 Gbp × 9.7% = 310 Mbp of the alignment may be
suspicious and should be reexamined.

interactions

Figure 6c,d presents analogous sensitivity results, reporting
information about the distribution of misalignment regions.
For each misalignment region, we measured the percentage
of columns of that region for which StatSigMA-w reports a pvalue at least 0.1. In Figure 6c, the high p-value must be for a
branch separating the misaligned species from human. In
Figure 6d, the high p-value can be for any branch.

As shown in Table 1, only a fraction of human chromosome 1
was actually aligned to other vertebrates. For example,
approximately 2% of human chromosome 1 is aligned to
zebrafish. While there are sequences in human for which it
will be very hard to find the correct orthologous zebrafish
sequence (in fact, orthologous zebrafish sequences may not
exist), an alignment tool other than MULTIZ may be able to
align sequences that MULTIZ could not. Using StatSigMA-w
we can take the alignment created by any tool and evaluate its
discordance. Thus, we can leverage the strengths of all tools
and significantly align as much of the human genome as
possible.
While this work deals with analyzing whole-genome alignments, StatSigMA-w can also be used to analyze any alignment to measure the confidence in various parts of the
alignment. This can be useful, for example, if we suspect there
are several domains in a protein multiple alignment, and the
high conservation of some is causing the whole alignment to
look good. Until now there was no method to measure
whether the individual domains (other than the well conserved ones) are significantly aligned or not. Using StatSigMA-w, we can assign a discordance value to all parts of the
alignment.
The StatSigMA-w track for the UCSC Genome Browser available on our web site [24] can be used as a quality measure of
the alignment at any locus of interest on human chromosome
1. Source code for StatSigMA-w is available on request from
the authors.

imizes the p-value over all values of r and corrects for
multiple hypotheses (multiplication by 2r+1).
Now to compute the p-value for segment S over all possible
contexts W containing S:

p − value( sc’k ,S k ) = max( p − value( sc’k ,S W , k )).
W

(3)

The reason for maximization in Equation 3 is that, if even one
context has a p-value greater than the threshold at which the
null hypothesis is rejected, then the null hypothesis should
not be rejected. The next section shows how to estimate the pvalues of Equation 3 without explicitly considering every possible context W.

Algorithm to limit contexts and estimate p-values
Since the MULTIZ alignments are human-referenced, the
genomic location of the human sequence contained in a segment uniquely identifies that segment. For purposes of notation, let (Si,start, Si,end) be the human coordinates that identify
segment Si.
The ideas outlined in the Results section give rise to the following divide-and-conquer algorithm that simultaneously
defines appropriate contexts and estimates p-values for all
regions of any multiple alignment.
Step 1. Consider all positively scoring segments in decreasing
order of their scores.
Step 2. For segment S, compute its p-value pS taking the entire
genome as the context and ignoring other segment scores.

Materials and methods
p-value of a segment in a given context
Let W be any genomic context that contains the segment S;
sck,1, sck,2, ..., sck,m are the scores (in decreasing order) of the
other segments in W with respect to branch k. As described
earlier [16] (and A.P. and M.T., Assessing the discordance of
multiple sequence alignments, unpublished work), the normalized segment scores for these segments are sc'k,i = λksck,i ln(Kk(|W| - Hk)2), where Kk, λk, and Hk are the Karlin-Altschul
parameters for the null hypothesis case k.
r

For any 0 ≤ r ≤ m, define totalk ,r = ∑ i =1 sc′

k ,i

− ln(r !) [15].

Then, for the null hypothesis case k, the p-value of sc'k,S in
context W is:
m

p − value( sc’k ,S W , k ) = min( p − value(totalk ,r + sc’k ,S W , k , r ) × 2r +1 ).
r =0

(2)
The formula to compute the p-value of totalk,r + sc'k,S given
context W is presented elsewhere (A.P. and M.T., Assessing
the discordance of multiple sequence alignments, unpublished work). Using ideas from Altschul [20], Equation 2 min-

Step 3. Repeat Step 2 for all the highest scoring segments S as
long as pS < 10-10.
Step 4. For segment S, identify its closest left segment SL and
right segment SR in the human genome for which p-values
have been computed. If the worst context of SL does not
include S, let L be the leftmost segment of the worst context
of SL, otherwise L = SL. Similarly, if the worst context of SR
does not include S, let R be the rightmost segment of the
worst context of SR, otherwise R = SR. Let the positively scoring segments between L and R (including L and R) be S1, S2,
..., Sm, occurring in this order in the alignment.
Step 5. Consider any segments Si and Sj (where i ≤ j), such that
S is between Si and Sj. Let the context between Si,end and Sj,start
be Wij. Using Equation 2, compute pi,j = p-value(sc'k,S | Wij, k).
Step 6. Repeat Step 5 for all possible i and j such that i ≤ j and
S is between Si and Sj. Let pLR be the maximum value of pi,j
over all such i and j.
Step 7. The estimated (Equation 3) p-value of segment S is
max(pLR, pS L , pS R ), where pS L and pS R are the already

A point to note here is that, if a segment has a p-value p for a
context W, then extending W to reach the nearest segment
boundaries can only increase the p-value. Thus, for identifying the context with the greatest p-value in Step 5, we need
only consider those contexts that lie on segment boundaries.
