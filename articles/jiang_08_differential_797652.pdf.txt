Abstract
Background: The filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii grows into a multicellular mycelium that is
distinct from the unicellular morphology of its closely related yeast species. It has been proposed
that genes important for cell cycle regulation play central roles for such phenotypic differences.
Because A. gossypii shares an almost identical set of cell cycle genes with the typical yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the differences might occur at the level of orthologous gene regulation.
Codon usage patterns were compared to identify orthologous genes with different gene regulation
between A. gossypii and nine closely related yeast species.
Results: Here we identified 3,151 orthologous genes between A. gossypii and nine yeast species.
Two groups of genes with significant differences in codon usage (gene translation efficiency) were
identified between A. gossypii and yeasts. 333 genes (Group I) and 552 genes (Group II) have
significantly higher translation efficiency in A. gossypii and yeasts, respectively. Functional enrichment
and pathway analysis show that Group I genes are significantly enriched with cell cycle functions
whereas Group II genes are biased toward metabolic functions.
Conclusion: Because translation efficiency of a gene is closely related to its functional importance,
the observed functional distributions of orthologous genes with different translation efficiency
might account for phenotypic differentiation between A. gossypii and yeast species. The results shed
light on the mechanisms for pseudohyphal growth in pathogenic yeast species.

Background
Filamentous and yeast-like growths are two ways for fungi
to propagate in nature. Under normal growth conditions,
filamentous fungi grow as multicellular mycelium but
yeasts form unicellular colonies. Most species in the clade
Saccharomycotina are yeasts. In some special environ-

ments, these species can switch to pseudohyphal growth
that is morphologically similar to filamentous growth,
but they can not form real hyphal filaments [1,2]. Ashbya
gossypii, however, is classified as a filamentous fungus
because it forms natural hyphal filaments for most of its
life cycle [3,4]. What the nature of the molecular differPage 1 of 9

ences between A. gossypii and yeasts is that led to such a
phenotypic divergence remains an open question. It has
been proposed that the divergence might result from a
modified cell cycle processes in A. gossypii [4-6]. However,
comparative genomics studies reveal that A. gossypii shares
an almost identical set of cell cycle genes with the typical
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5]. Although loss or gain of
genes among different species often play important roles
in phenotypic diversity [7], divergence of regulation in
orthologous genes can also contribute significantly to this
process [8]. The fact that A. gossypii and its closely related
yeasts share a very similar set of cell cycle genes prompts
us to investigate whether these genes have unique regulation patterns in A. gossypii.
Genetic codes exhibit significant usage bias. Selection for
gene translation efficiency is the most common Darwinian explanation for codon usage bias. Under this scenario,
codons corresponding to abundant tRNA would be preferentially used [9-12]. Natural selection biases such preferred codons so as to enhance accuracy and speed of
protein synthesis in highly expressed genes [13-15].
Therefore, differential translation efficiency reflects protein expression difference, which in return can indicate
differential functional requirements for these proteins
[14]. Therefore, divergence of translation efficiency could
reveal orthologous gene functional differentiation across
species [15]. By comparing codon usage patterns for
orthologous genes between A. gossypii and nine yeast species [2], we show in this study that in A. gossypii genes with
significantly higher translation efficiency are enriched in
cell cycle processes, whereas genes with significantly lower
translation efficiency are enriched in metabolic processes.
Both these findings could account for phenotypic differentiation between multicellular A. gossypii and unicellular
yeasts, and would shed light on the evolutionary processes that enable pseudohyphal growth in pathogenic
yeast species.

orthologous genes in the same species. The tAI values
from nine yeast species were used to calculate the likelihood of observing the tAI value for A. gossypii gene in each
orthologous gene group.
Based on statistical significance at the 95% confidence
level, we divided all orthologous genes into three categories. Group I: 333 genes showing significantly higher tAI
values in A. gossypii than in yeasts (Figure 1A), group II:
552 genes showing significantly lower tAI values in A. gossypii than in yeasts (Figure 1B) and group III: the rest of
2,266 genes that have no obviously different tAI values
between A. gossypii and yeasts (Additional file 2 for tAI values of genes in Group III). Under the assumption that
translation efficiency is a selected trait, genes in group I
would have higher expression and be translated more efficiently in A. gossypii than their orthologous genes in
yeasts, whereas genes in group II would show the opposite
pattern.
GO (Gene Ontology) functional enrichment analysis
Different tAI values for orthologous genes indicate the distinct functional importance of these genes in compared
species [15]. Using GO terms in S. cerevisiae as reference,
we characterized functional enrichment for Group I and
Group II genes, respectively [18]. As shown in Figure 2A
(See additional file 3 for the table list of these functional
categories), Group I genes display significant enrichment
in functions such as cell cycle regulation, mitosis and
cytoskeleton organization. Interestingly, these functions
have been hypothesized to be important for the unique
life style in A. gossypii [6]. In addition, Group I genes also
show enrichment of functions that are related with reproduction process, spore wall assembly and developmental
process. By contrast, Group II genes show functional
enrichment in amino acid and steroid biosynthesis (Figure 2B). Different from above two groups, Group III genes
do not show any functional enrichment (data not
shown).

Results
tRNA adaptation index (tAI)
Within a genome, codon usage, which matches tRNA pool
of the organism, is an important indicator for gene translational efficiency [16]. In order to detect the differences
in gene translational efficiency between A. gossypii and
yeasts, a gene matrix containing 3,151 orthologous gene
groups for A. gossypii and nine yeast species was constructed. Species-specific tRNA adaptation index (tAI), a
measurement that evaluates translation efficiency of coding sequences [17], was predicted for each gene based on
tRNA pool in that species. Because estimation of codon
usage can be affected by species-specific factors such as
genome-wide GC contents (Additional file 1), in order to
have cross species comparisons, we normalized the tAI
value of each gene by the median tAI value of all studied

KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
pathway analysis
In order to further see the impact of differences in gene
translational efficiency, we assigned all studied orthologous genes into identified pathways according to KEGG
annotation for S. cerevisiae [19]; 897 genes (75% of all
annotated genes in KEGG pathways) are included in our
orthologous matrix. Among them, 79 genes belong to
Group I and 219 genes belong to Group II. A Chi-square
test was used to estimate distribution bias for each pathway. With a cut-off P value of 0.01, six pathways show significant distribution bias (Table 1). Consistent with gene
ontology analysis, two of the three pathways enriched
with Group I genes (cell cycle pathway and ubiquitin
mediated proteolysis) are related to cell cycle regulation.

are significantly higher than those in yeasts); B) tAI values for orthologous genes in Group II (tAI values in A. gossypii are significantly lower than those in yeasts). The scale of tAI values is shown to the right of the figure. (Agos: Ashbya gossypii; Sces: Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Spar:Saccharomyces paradoxus; Smik:Saccharomyces mikatae; Sbay:Saccharomyces bayanus; Cgla:Candida
glabrata; Kpol:Kluyveromyces polysporus; Kwal:Kluyveromyces waltii, Sklu: Saccharomyces kluyveri; Klac:Kluyveromyces lactis).

As shown in Figure 3, cell cycle genes that belong to
Group I scatter at each phase of cell division, so the
enhanced translation efficiency, hence the increased
importance of these genes, would influence the whole cell
division process in A. gossypii. It is noteworthy that some
cell cycle genes also belong to Group II. Interestingly,
almost half of them are related with two protein complexes (condensin and mini-chromosome maintenance
complex, Figure 3). Group II genes are enriched in metabolic processes such as lysine biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. At 95%
confidence level another six biosynthesis pathways are
enriched with Group II genes (See additional file 4: Table
1 for the details of these pathways).
Comparative analysis with experimentally confirmed
genes in A. gossypii
The above observations are all based on functional annotations for genes in S. cerevisiae. In order to confirm that
genes with significantly higher tAI values in A. gossypii are
truly enriched in cell cycle pathway genes, we identified
all studied genes in A. gossypii according to NCBI database.
Twenty one genes in A. gossypii were confirmed to be
related with cell cycle processes (Table 2). Eight of them
have significantly higher tAI values in A. gossypii (Group I,
333 gene), the other 13 genes do not show significant differences of tAI values among species (Group III, 2,266

genes). Fisher's exact test indicates that these confirmed
cell cycle genes in A. gossypii are also enriched in Group I
(P = 0.003).

Discussion
Codon usage bias in A. gossypii
Among studied species, A. gossypii has the highest
genome-wide GC content (0.53), while the GC contents
in other species are from 0.35 to 0.46 (Additional file 1A).
Correlation coefficients of codon usage between A. gossypii
and other nine species show strongly positive relationship
with their GC contents, indicating that GC content might
intensively shape codon usage in A. gossypii. Relationships
of GC contents (estimated by GC3s: GC content at the
third site of each codon) and codon usage bias (measured
by Nc: effective number of codons which is a parameter
measuring overall gene codon bias) on further analysis in
all studies species show us that the higher GC3s is, the
stronger correlation between GC3s and Nc is (Additional
file 1B). For all studied orthologs in A. gossypii, GC3s is
strongly correlated with Nc, but not strongly associated
with tAI and CAI (codon adaptive index) (Additional file
1C), indicating that change of GC content might have a
larger impact on gene Nc than on tAI and CAI values. As
in Man and Piple [15], we obtained low correlations
between tAI and Nc, and between CAI and Nc (Additional
file 1C), which might be due to the dramatic change of GC

content, thus Nc values in A. gossypii. Nevertheless, both
correlations are still statistically significant, while tAI and
CAI show a very strong positive correlation in this species
(Additional file 1C). Because tAI values for orthologs
among studied species were normalized to remove the
impact caused by some factors at genome level including
GC content, it would still be an accurate indicator for
expression level, thus the importance of A. gossypii genes
during evolution.

Possible effect of protein size on gene translation
efficiency
Natural selection biases synonymous codon usage to
enhance accuracy and speed of protein synthesis in various organisms [11,12]. Differential gene translation efficiency reflects differences in functional requirements for
proteins among organisms [14,15]. However, as previously reported, the negative correlation between translation efficiency and gene length indicates that translation
efficiency could also be affected by protein size [14]. We

tested if the different gene translation efficiencies
observed between A. gossypii and yeast species could be
caused by protein size deviation in different species. At
first, we computed correlation coefficient of the tAI difference for each orthologs between A. gossypii and other nine
yeasts and their protein size differences. To do this, for
each orthologous gene, we calculated a protein size ratio,
defined as the protein size of orthologous gene in A. gossypii (average protein size was used if two or more genes
are in the same orthologous group) divided by the average
protein size of orthologous genes in nine yeast species.
Pearson correlation coefficient between tAI difference and
protein size difference doesn't show significant association between the two (r = 0.035, P-value > 0.05). In addition, Distributions of protein size ratio for genes in Group
I and II are shown in Figure 4. There are no significant differences in protein size between A. gossypii and yeast spe-

cies for both Group I and Group II genes, indicating that
our observations are not the results of protein size change
of orthologous genes during evolution.
Higher translation efficiency of cell cycle genes in A.
gossypii
Comparison of translation efficiencies for orthologous
genes should uncover regulation divergence, and thus the
differential functional importance of those genes in
diverged species [14,15]. Here by a comparative genomic
approach, we identified two groups of orthologous genes
showing differential translation efficiency between the filamentous fungus A. gossypii and its closely related yeast
species. Genes in Group I have significantly higher translation efficiency in A. gossypii than those in yeasts. Functional analysis indicates that these genes are significantly
enriched in cell cycle processes. Subsequent analysis of

known pathways and experimentally studied genes in A.
gossypii support such conclusion. Because enhanced translation efficiency indicates increased functional requirement for a gene, our results suggest that the roles of cell
cycle genes might be substantially different between A.
gossypii and yeasts. This suggestion is consistent with the
observation that cell cycle processes, such as polar growth
modes, cell cycle control and asynchronous nuclear division, are more complex in A. gossypii than those in yeast
species [4,6,20,21]. Further experimental investigations
for regulatory changes of cell cycle genes in A. gossypii
could provide more insights into this conclusion.
For most pathogenic yeasts, transition from yeast form to
filamentous form (pseudohyphal growth) is a key mark
for their pathogenicity [1,22]. It has been reported that
cell cycle genes play important roles in the morphological
transition [1,23]. Micro-array experiment also shows that
cell cycle genes are more up-regulated in S. cerevisiae filamentous form than are those in yeast form [1]. Our results
indicate that cell cycle genes possess higher translational
efficiency, and thus might be functionally more important, in filamentous fungus than those in yeast. Therefore,
understanding species difference between filamentous
fungus and yeasts could be helpful for illustrating mechanisms underlying filamentous growth of pathogenic
yeasts.
Higher translation efficiency for metabolic genes in yeasts
Genes in Group II have significantly lower translation efficiency in A. gossypii than those in yeasts. Functional

enrichment analysis indicates that these genes are
enriched for metabolic process, such as amino acid and
steroid biosynthesis. This functional distribution might
be associated with rapid cell growth in yeasts through fermentative life style. All yeast species studied can carry out
fermentative growth under anaerobic or aerobic conditions, but A. gossypii can only conduct aerobic respiration
[24]. The cell division rate is usually much faster for fermentative than for respiratory growth [25]. For eukaryotic
organisms, cell size is an important control at check
points for cell division [26,27]. In order to attain critical
size, cells need to synthesize cellular components much
more rapidly during fermentative than during respiratory
growth. Therefore the metabolic processes should be in
greater demand in yeasts than that in A. gossypii. The difference in metabolic rate could lead to differential translation efficiency for metabolic genes between A. gossypii and
yeasts.

Conclusion
Comparative studies revealed that more than 95% genes
in multicellular organism A. gossypii share orthologs with
unicellular organism S. cerevisiae [5]. It has been proposed
that different growth modes between these species were
controlled by a very similar gene set [4-6]. Our studies of
orthologous genes among A. gossypii and several yeast species show higher translation efficiency of cell cycle genes
in A. gossypii, which is consistent with more complicated
cell cycle processes in this multicellular organism. On the
other hand, our results are also consistent with the faster
growth of unicellular yeasts, which leads to greater

Kluyveromyces lactis). Saccharomyces kudriavzevii and Saccharomyces castellii were not used due to their low sequencing coverage. The protein, coding and genomic sequences
for recently sequenced K. polysporus are from Scannell et al
2007 [29]. Sequences for other species were downloaded
from Fungal Comparative Genomics database [30] and
National Center for Biotechnology Information [31].
Orthologous matrix
Using InParanoid [32] program, orthologs between every
two species were identified. According to the results from
InParanoid, we used MultiParanoid [33] to generate
orthologous matrix among all studied species. Each row
in the matrix corresponds to an orthlogous gene shared by
all studied species and each column to a species. Duplicated genes detected by InParanoid in one species were
classified into the same orthologous group. Only orthologous groups which contain at least one gene for each species were used in our study. As a result, an orthologous
matrix with 3,151 rows (genes) and 10 columns (species)
was generated.

Figure 4

genes. Protein size ratio for a gene was defined as the length
of this gene in A. gossypii divided by the average length of its
orthologous genes in nine yeast species. The solid and

for Group I and Group II genes, respectively. Both distributions center around 1, indicating that there are no protein
length differences between A. gossypii and studied yeast species for both Group I and Group II genes.

demands of gene products for metabolic processes. Emergence of multicellular organisms was one of the most profound developmental transitions in the history of life
[28]. Our results in this study, and further investigation
for the difference between A. gossypii and yeast species
might also be important for understanding this process.

Methods
Species and sequence data
According to the phylogenetic tree in Fitzpatrick et al.
(2006) [2], 12 genomes have been sequenced in the clade
Saccharomycotina. Among these species, only Ashbya gossypii is classified as filamentous fungus. For the remaining
11 yeast species, nine were used in our study (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, Saccharomyces bayanus, Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces

tRNA adaptation index (tAI)
First, we used tRNAscan-SE software (version 1.1) to predict copy numbers for all tRNA genes (tRNA gene pool) in
each genome [34]. The tRNA pools among closely related
species are conserved (See additional file 5 for the original
data used to perform this analysis) [15]. For species with
relatively low genome sequencing quality, we used tRNA
pools from their closely related species, a same approach
as in Ref 15: the predicted tRNA pool from S. cerevisiae was
used to replace the ones in S. byanus, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and the tRNA pool from K. lactis was used to replace
the ones in K. waltii and S. kluyveri.

Second, given coding sequence for a gene, we used a modified tAI.R program [15] to estimate its tAI value in each
species according to the tRNA pools (we kept all codons
for methionines expect the start codons). When an orthologous group contains more than one gene in a species, the
average tAI value of these genes was used for that species.
Finally, we normalized tAI value of each gene by median
tAI value for all studied genes in the same species. For each
orthologous group, we used the tAI values for nine yeast
species to construct a normal distribution model, which
was then used to estimate the probability of observing tAI
value for the A. gossypii gene. Under 95% confidence level,
we identified 333 (Group I) and 552 genes (Group II) for
which orthologs from A. gossypii have significantly higher
and lower tAI values than those from yeasts, respectively.
The rest 2,266 genes without significantly different tAI values between A. gossypii and yeasts were classified in Group
III.

Functional enrichment analysis
GO (Gene Ontology) annotations of S. cerevisiae genes
were used for our analysis. We identified functional
enrichment of genes in each group (group I, II and III) by
GO term finder [18]. The functional enrichments were
determined at P-value < 0.05. Pathway information for S.
cerevisiae was downloaded from KEGG database http://
www.genome.jp/kegg/. All studied orthologous genes in
S. cerevisiae were mapped onto these pathways. For each
pathway, a chi-square test was used to calculate the probability of gene number distribution among each group.

for each species. Y axis is the correlation of whole genomic codon usage
measured by RSCU (Relative Synonymous Codon Usage) between A. gossypii and other nine yeasts (Additional file 5). Figure B, using codonW
http://codonw.sourceforge.net/, we calculated values for GC3s and Nc
and obtained their correlation efficiencies in all studied species. X axis is
the GC contents for each species. Y axis is the correlation coefficients
between GC3s and Nc for each studied species. Figure C shows correlations among four indexes: tAI, GC3s, Nc and CAI in A. gossypii. All
ribosomal protein gene sequences in A. gossypii were used as reference set
for CAI calculation. Pearson correlation coefficients among these parameters were calculated. The lower triangle of table contains the Pearson's
correlation coefficients and the upper triangle of table contains P-values
