Abstract
Background: Leaf rust, which is caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix (Pucciniales), is a devastating disease that
affects coffee plants (Coffea arabica L.). Disadvantages that are associated with currently developed phytoprotection
approaches have recently led to the search for alternative strategies. These include genetic manipulations that
constitutively activate disease resistance signaling pathways. However, molecular actors of such pathways still
remain unknown in C. arabica. In this study, we have isolated and characterized the coffee NDR1 gene, whose
Arabidopsis ortholog is a well-known master regulator of the hypersensitive response that is dependent on coiledcoil type R-proteins.
Results: Two highly homologous cDNAs coding for putative NDR1 proteins were identified and cloned from leaves
of coffee plants. One of the candidate coding sequences was then expressed in the Arabidopsis knock-out null
mutant ndr1-1. Upon a challenge with a specific strain of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae (DC3000::AvrRpt2),
analysis of both macroscopic symptoms and in planta microbial growth showed that the coffee cDNA was able to
restore the resistance phenotype in the mutant genetic background. Thus, the cDNA was dubbed CaNDR1a
(standing for Coffea arabica Non-race specific Disease Resistance 1a). Finally, biochemical and microscopy data were
obtained that strongly suggest the mechanistic conservation of the NDR1-driven function within coffee and
Arabidopsis plants. Using a transient expression system, it was indeed shown that the CaNDR1a protein, like its
Arabidopsis counterpart, is localized to the plasma membrane, where it is possibly tethered by means of a GPI anchor.
Conclusions: Our data provide molecular and genetic evidence for the identification of a novel functional NDR1
homolog in plants. As a key regulator initiating hypersensitive signalling pathways, CaNDR1 gene(s) might be target
(s) of choice for manipulating the coffee innate immune system and achieving broad spectrum resistance to
pathogens. Given the potential conservation of NDR1-dependent defense mechanisms between Arabidopsis and
coffee plants, our work also suggests new ways to isolate the as-yet-unidentified R-gene(s) responsible for
resistance to H. vastatrix.

Background
The genus Coffea includes about 120 species of subtropical/tropical woody perennial trees and shrubs (family
Rubiaceae), of which at least two species are of worldwide agro-economic interest. Nearly 75% of world coffee
production originates from Coffea arabica L., while

about 20% comes from C. canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner (= C. robusta). Orange coffee leaf rust is considered
to be one of the major plagues affecting C. arabica [1].
The fungus responsible for the disease, Hemileia vastatrix Berkeley & Broome, is widely spread throughout coffee-growing countries and can cause severe defoliation,
resulting in substantial berry yield losses [1,2]. Furthermore, the two current approaches for restricting pathogen infection offer limited advantages. First, fungicide
application, although cost-effective, does not always
result in adequate disease control and, moreover, it has a

negative environmental impact. Second, even though several varieties of coffee that are resistant to H. vastatrix
have been used for introgression purposes [3,4], such
alternatives are time-consuming and do not provide durable resistance due to the rapid co-evolution of races of
the fungus that harbor new virulence genes [5]. Therefore, additional methods to control leaf rust in the fields
are required.
H. vastatrix is an obligate biotrophic parasite belonging
to the division Basidiomycetes, order Pucciniales [6].
Following urediospore germination on the abaxial leaf
surface, hyphae grow and penetrate intercellular spaces
of the mesophyll tissue through stomatal openings before
differentiating intra-cellular feeding structures, or haustoria. In susceptible coffee plants, the successful pathogen
can complete its dikaryotic cycle within three weeks following infection and reach the ultimate stage, which is
characterized by the formation of a sporulating sorus. In
resistant plants, hyphal invasion is rapidly sensed and
arrested within 2-3 days [7,8]. Based on quantitative and
Mendelian genetic studies [3,4], the occurrence of at least
nine dominant resistance (R) genes in Coffea spp., and a
similar number of fungal virulence genes, have been
inferred. It is thus commonly accepted that the outcome
of coffee/rust interactions, whether the plant resists
pathogen attack (incompatibility) or develops disease
(compatibility), relies on the gene-for-gene model [9],
which has been recently amended [10]. Once delivered
into coffee cells, H. vastatrix effector proteins, and the
intracellular perturbations that they trigger, are supposed
to be perceived by specific R-proteins. The recognition
step promotes the launching of signaling defense pathway(s) and subsequent resistance. Alternatively, virulent
rust races are believed to secrete effectors that escape or
even counteract the host surveillance system, which
allow for the highjacking of coffee cell metabolism and
tissue colonization [11].
During incompatible interactions with biotrophic pathogens, the plant resistance phenotype results from the onset
of a complex and multilayered-defense response, which is
the so-called hypersensitive response or HR [12,13].
Although little is still known about the molecular mechanisms that govern resistance to H. vastatrix, several studies
have advanced the case for the existence of a HR-like phenomenon in coffee plants. Resistant varieties that were
inoculated with avirulent fungal strains displayed a morphotype that exhibits many HR characteristics. These
include rapid host cell death, which is localized at the
infection site and that is associated with fungal hyphae collapse [7,8], callose encasement of haustoria and subsequent
cell wall lignification [8], early oxidative burst [14,15], and
the activation of typical defense-related genes [16-18].
In previous work, we performed a suppression subtractive hybridization-based screening in C. arabica that had

Page 2 of 17

been challenged with H. vastatrix and identified a series
of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) that were regulated
during compatible or incompatible interactions [16,19].
One of these ESTs shared a significant identity with the
coding sequence of the NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE
RESISTANCE 1 (NDR1) gene. Originally isolated in
Arabidopsis thaliana, NDR1 encodes a small plasma
membrane-resident protein, the deficiency of which was
found to abolish HR and confer susceptibility to some
fungal and bacterial pathogens carrying specific effector
genes [20-22]. Notably, it has been established that
NDR1-driven resistance is dependent on a specific subset
of R-proteins (such as RPM1, RPS2 and RPS5) that are
defined by the presence of a coiled-coil (CC) structure
within their N-terminal parts [23]. From a mechanistic
perspective, the best characterized example illustrating
NDR1 function is the pathosystem involving strain
DC3000::AvrRpt2 of the plant pathogenic bacterium
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst). In this model,
under resting conditions, AtNDR1 indirectly retains the
RPS2 protein on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane through its interaction with the RPM1-INTERACTING PROTEIN 4 (RIN4), thereby preventing HR
activation [24]. Upon infection with Pst, the bacterial
protease AvrRpt2 is secreted into the cytoplasm where it
can cleave RIN4, releasing RPS2 and initiating a disease
resistance signaling pathway [25].
In this study, we cloned two C. arabica candidate
cDNAs for NDR1 and analyzed the deduced primary
amino-acid sequences. Domain conservation and the
high degree of homology between the coffee proteins and
AtNDR1 led us to undertake a genetic complementation
approach. Using the Arabidopsis ndr1-1 null mutant, we
obtained genetic and molecular evidence that at least one
of our candidate genes is a functional NDR1 ortholog.
Both laser-confocal microscopy and biochemical analyses
further suggested that the protein is likely to be attached
to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor. Based on these data, the possibility that a
NDR1-contingent mechanism could be invoked in Rgene-mediated resistance to H. vastatrix is discussed.
The impact this result could have in the context of resistance improvement is also outlined.

Results
Cloning and analysis of a novel NDR1 sequence homolog
from Coffea arabica

In previous work [19], we used a subtractive hybridization approach to identify genes involved in defense/resistance of coffee plants (C. arabica L.) to the orange rust
fungus H. vastatrix. Of the 9 ESTs which were significantly up-regulated during HR, one displayed 43% identity with the canonical NDR1 coding sequence from
A. thaliana. In this study, we focused our efforts on the

Cacas et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:144
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/144

coffee candidate for NDR1 gene and isolated two distinct
full-length transcripts by nested RACE-PCR. The corresponding cDNAs were cloned as described in the ‘Methods’ section (CaNDR1a [GenBank:DQ335596], CaNDR1b
[GenBank:DQ335597]). Open reading frames differed
from one another by only 3 single nucleotide positions
with one of the substitutions being non-silent (F69L).
Both sequences were predicted to encode proteins that
were 214 amino acids long, which shared a calculated
molecular weight of 23.8 kDa and an isoelectric point of
9.58.
Searching for Arabidopsis relatives of our proteins, we
screened the GenBank database by means of the BLAST P
algorithm [26] and retrieved 15 non-redundant hits.
As expected, the best match appeared to be NDR1 with
42/61% identity/homology. Apart from an unknown
sequence, all identified homologs had been previously
described as members of the NDR1/HIN1-like (NHL) protein superfamily [27]. NHLs account for a vast class of
plant defense-associated proteins that, within their Nterminal halves, contain two highly conserved peptide patterns (motifs 2 and 3) and a less conserved one (motif 1)
[28]. Alignment of the proteins, along with the tobacco
HIN1 for comparison, revealed the position of the three
motifs within sequences (Figure 1; see also additional file 1
for full length sequence alignment). A phylogenetic analysis using solely the conserved region that is presented in
Figure 1, and which encompasses the three NHL motifs,
showed that CaNDR1a/b, NDR1, NHL38 and NHL16

formed a group that was distinct from other NHLs (Figure
2a,b). These data indicate that NDR1, NHL38 and NHL16
are the closest Arabidopsis relatives of CaNDR1a/b.
Ectopic expression of CaNDR1a in Arabidopsis ndr1-1 null
mutant restores specific resistance to Pseudomonas
syringae pv. tomato (DC3000::AvrRpt2)

From our in silico analysis, the question arises as to
whether the two identified coffee genes are functional
homologs of AtNDR1 or code for distinct NHL counterparts. To answer this question, a genetic complementation approach was undertaken. Given the high degree of
identity between the two predicted CaNDR1 amino-acid
sequences, we decided to study CaNDR1a and expressed
the corresponding ORF under the control of the
CaMV35S promoter in the Arabidopsis ndr1-1 null
mutant. Segregation analysis on a selective medium
allowed for the isolation of single-locus, homozygous
insertion lines (see additional file 2 for segregation
results). T3 lines were then screened by RT-qPCR for
high steady-state levels of transgene transcripts and three
of them were selected for further experiments. The
expression level of CaNDR1a in these lines, designated
T3-1, T3-2 and T3-3, was respectively 92-, 190-, and
714-fold higher than that of the endogenous AtNDR1
gene, when compared to WT Col-0 plants grown under
the exact same conditions.
Previous work has shown that the ndr1-1 null mutant
is incapable of HR activation in response to Pst strain

Figure 1 The two coffee candidates for NDR1 protein belong to the NHL family. Putative Arabidopsis orthologs of CaNDR1a/b proteins
were identified by means of the BLAST algorithm using as queries the two deduced coffee amino-acid sequences. The retrieved sequences
were aligned using version 2.0.10 of the Clustal X program [59] and the resulting alignment was then processed online at the BoxShade server
(http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). The conserved region containing the three NHL motifs is presented. The position of the
motifs is indicated with red lines and numbers. An asterik shows the position of the substituted amino-acid residue between the two coffee
proteins (F69L). The full length sequence alignment can be found in Additional file 1. Accession numbers of the genes coding for the

DC3000::AvrRpt2 carrying an AvrRpt2 cassette-containing plasmid [20,21]. Conversely, a high overexpression
level of AtNDR1 in the Col-0 genetic background was
found to confer enhanced disease resistance to strain
DC3000 [22]. The behavior of our overexpressor lines
was thus examined in response to the two isogenic bacterial strains (DC3000::AvrRpt2 and DC3000) by recording macroscopic symptoms and following in planta
bacterial growth over a four-day period. Although Coppinger et al. [22] had previously reported the occurrence
of HR-like lesions in non-inoculated Arabidopsis transgenic lines overexpressing AtNDR1, no such lesions
were observed in our non-inoculated T3 lines. Although
the three genotypes developed disease symptoms in
response to DC3000 (Figure 3a), T3-2 and T3-3 lines
were less susceptible than the ndr1-1 mutant plants, as
shown by the leaf bacterial contents at four days postinoculation (dpi) (Figure 3c). Upon a challenge with
DC3000::AvrRpt2, WT plants exhibited typical hypersensitive lesions located within the infiltrated area, whereas
ndr1-1 mutants showed disease-like symptoms characterized by tissue yellowing, which spread outside the
inoculated zone (Figure 3a). As expected, such striking
differences between the WT and ndr1-1 genotypes were
closely correlated with leaf bacterial amounts. For
instance, as early as 2 dpi, mutant leaves already showed
a 10-fold increase in the concentration of bacteria compared to WT leaves (Figure 3b). More importantly,
when inoculated with strain DC3000::AvrRpt2, all three
CaNDR1a-expressing lines presented a HR-like phenotype (Figure 3a) that was associated with bacterial levels
statistically comparable to that of WT plants (Figure
3b). Furthermore, expression of the coffee transgene in
the Arabidopsis mutant had no significant impact on
the RPS4-coordinated HR that had been previously
shown to be independent of AtNDR1 [23] (Additional
file 3). Altogether, these results provide genetic evidence
that CaNDR1a functionally and specifically complements the ndr1-1 mutant.
The mature CaNDR1a protein is C-terminally processed

The Arabidopsis NDR1 protein undergoes several posttranslational modifications, including multiple glycosylations and C-terminus processing. The latter cleavage
removes a small portion of the protein, thereby freeing an
amino-acid residue known as a ω-site (Figure 4) that was
proposed to be modified by covalent binding to a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchor [22]. In accordance
with the cognate role of AtNDR1 in disease resistance signalling [23], GPI anchoring is usually encountered in
eukaryotic plasma membrane-resident proteins and allows
for the cell surface-tethering phenomenon [29]. Although
there is no established consensus sequence of GPI-anchor
attachment sites, prediction algorithms are available

Page 5 of 17

online. Using the Big-Pi Plant Predictor [30,31], we identified two putative overlapping cleavage sites in the primary
amino-acid sequence of CaNDR1a (Figure 4), with residues S189 and G190 being strong ω-site candidates (with
P-values of 2.48 × 10 -6 and 2.76 × 10 -5 , respectively).
Furthermore, CaNDR1a and its Arabidopsis ortholog
share common structural features that are believed to be
necessary for GPI attachment by the transamidase complex in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes [31].
Directly downstream of the potential ω-residues is a
region predicted to encompass a short polar spacer, followed by a hydrophobic tail. An uncleavable signal peptide
(1-39) comprising a potential transmembrane domain (1632) was also predicted with a high probability of occurrence (P = 0.867) using SignalP-3.0 software [32,33]. As
previously suggested [22], this N-terminal signal sequence
might be required for the protein to enter the ER network
and travel through the secretory pathway.
Based on this in silico analysis, we decided to investigate
the possibility of C-terminus processing for CaNDR1a. To
this end, a doubly-tagged CaNDR1a version (HA-CaNDR1a-His) was created (Figure 5a) and transiently
expressed in tobacco leaves. We reasoned that, if the CaNDR1a protein is cleaved in tobacco cells, the loss of its Cterminus should be easily visualized upon immunoblotting
by the absence of a His-specific signal, whereas the proof
that the protein is synthesized would be provided by the
presence of a HA-specific signal.
Two to three days post-infiltration with an Agrobacterium strain, which was dedicated to the expression of the
HA-CaNDR1a-His construct, protein extracts prepared
from fresh tissues were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using either HA- or His-specific antisera as
described in the ‘Methods’ section. Immunoblot conditions
were tested using a N-terminally HA-tagged CaNDR1a
(HA-CaNDR1; Figure 5a) and C-terminally His-tagged
Bax Inhibitor 1 (BI1-His) versions as controls. Six independent experiments including independent Agrobacterium infiltrations and protein extractions were carried out.
Using anti-HA antibody, only one major band was detectable in lanes loaded with NDR1 samples (Figure 5b, lanes
3-6), whereas no specific signal was visualized in lanes
loaded with negative control samples (Figure 5b, lanes 1, 2
& 7). Although the nucleotide sequences of HA-CaNDR1a
and HA-CaNDR1a-His code for proteins with predicted
molecular weights averaging 25-26 kDa, the detected proteins migrated to approximately 45 kDa under denaturating conditions. Such an apparent discrepancy is not
surprising based on previous work. Coppinger and coworkers [22], indeed, showed that the native AtNDR1 protein
resolved by SDS-PAGE displays a mass of about 48 kDa
instead of the predicted 24.6 kDa. These authors further
demonstrated that the protein regains its theoretical size
when translated in vitro without the machinery dedicated

after inoculation. (b) and (c) Bacterial growth was monitored in planta by assaying leaf samples 0, 2, and 4 days post-inoculation. CaNDR1aexpressing lines (T3-1, T3-2 and T3-3), like the WT plants, are resistant to Pst DC3000::AvrRpt2, whereas ndr1-1 mutants are susceptible. Expressing
CaNDR1a in the ndr1-1 genetic background increased resistance to strain DC3000, as shown by significant reductions in leaf bacterial populations
in lines T3-2 and T3-3 at 4 dpi. A 2 × 105 cfu mL-1 inoculum was used for this experiment and the experiment was conducted twice. Means and
standard errors (4 biological replicates) are shown for a representative experiment. Different letters indicate a significant difference at 2 dpi
(Roman letters) or 4 dpi (Greek letters), as determined by ANOVA of square-root transformed data followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK)
test (a < 5%). No significant difference in leaf bacterial concentration was observed among Arabidopsis genotypes at T0.

Figure 4 Structural similarities between the Arabidopsis and coffee NDR1 proteins. Predicted structural domains and motifs of NDR1
proteins are represented. The overall structure of both proteins appears conserved; it is furthermore reminiscent of GPI-anchored proteins [29].
The C-terminus of NDR1 proteins exhibits putative cleavage sites, including the ω-site to which the glycolipid moiety of the anchor is attached.
Domains following the attachment site display the necessary features for proper transamidase activity, the enzyme complex involved in GPI
modifications of proteins and localized to the ER membrane. A putative uncleavable N-terminal signal peptide that might be implicated in ER
targetting is also present in both proteins. TMD indicates a predicted transmembrane domain. The size of each protein domain is indicated as
Arabic numbers. The number of predicted glycosylation sites (in the middle domain, shown in light grey) is also indicated above and below the
proteins. For convenience, the three conserved NHL motifs are shown as hatched regions I, II and III. Predictive models and methods used for
building this scheme are described in the ‘Methods’ section.

to glycosylation, indicating that the latter post-translational modification could account for the migration shift
of the mature proteins on polyacrylamide gels. Consistently, the CaNDR1a protein, like its Arabidopsis ortholog,
exhibits a significant number of putative glycosylation sites
(Figure 4). Hence, one can assume that our protein
extracts (Figure 5b, lanes 3-6) are likely to contain glycosylated forms of CaNDR1a, the migration behavior of which
is altered on polyacrylamide gels.
Finally, using the same set of samples and anti-His antibody, we were unable to detect HA-NDR1-His protein
(Figure 5b, lanes 4-6), whereas BI1-His protein (31 kDa)
was clearly identified (Figure 5b, lane 7). The latter data
indicate that CaNDR1a is C-terminally processed in
tobacco leaves, which strongly suggests that the protein is
modified by addition of a GPI moiety. Further experiments
are nevertheless needed to confirm this assumption.
CaNDR1a is localized to the plasma membrane

Indirect data support the association of the CaNDR1a
protein with membranes: (i) the potential post-translational modification by addition of a GPI-anchor; (ii) a
predicted transmembrane-spanning domain located
within the N-terminal signal peptide (Figure 4), and (iii)
the need of a detergent for the protein to be extracted
from tobacco leaf tissues when transiently expressed

(Additional file 4). Accordingly, the CaNDR1a protein
was predicted to be localized to the plasma membrane
(PM) using ChloroP1.1 and PSORTII software [34,35].
Therefore, in order to assess its subcellular localization, a
GFP6 translational fusion was created (Figure 6a), transformed into leaf epidermal tobacco cells using Agrobacterium tumefaciens as the vector, and imaged by confocal
microscopy (as described in the ‘Methods’ section). In
accordance with our working hypothesis, independent
experiments showed a consistent fluorescent pattern delineating cellular contours (Figure 6b, panel i). Such a pattern was also observed (Figure 6b, panel ii) with a PMresident protein fused to mCherry fluorophore [36]. In
addition, further experiments where both proteins were
simultaneously expressed in the same cells revealed a significant overlap between the GFP6 and mCherry signals
at the cell surface (Figure 6b, panels iv, v, vi). It is noteworthy that a few GFP6-CaNDR1a-expressing cells displayed not only cell surface labeling, but also internal
fluorescence resembling an ER-like reticulated network
with brighter dots that could represent Golgi structures
(Figure 6b, panel iii).
Because leaf epidermal tobacco cells possess a large central vacuole that presses the cytoplasmic compartment
against the PM and cell wall, it is difficult to conclude on
the subcellular localization of CaNDR1a based solely on

Cacas et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:144
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/144

these results show that the mature CaNDR1a protein is
targeted to PM in the tobacco heterologous system,
further suggesting a similar subcellular localization for
the protein in coffee cells.
Identification of a potential homologous RIN4 protein
from coffee plants

expressing HA- and HA-His-tagged CaNDR1a proteins in tobacco
leaves. (b) Detection of CaNDR1a-tagged proteins by
immunoblotting. The upper and lower panels show scanned films
corresponding to membranes blotted with anti-HA and anti-His
sera, respectively. For comparison, the same protein extracts were
resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred onto both
membranes. Ten micrograms of proteins were loaded in each lane.
Samples contained the main insoluble proteins that were extracted
using SDS as described in the ‘Methods’ section. Lanes 1 & 2,

protein and non-infiltrated leaves, respectively); lane 3, HA-positive

samples prepared from tissues expressing the doubly-tagged
CaNDR1a protein (3 independent experiments); and lane 7, HAnegative control, His-positive control (sample prepared from
Arabidopsis leaves constitutively expressing the C-terminally Histagged AtBI1 protein) [56].

our microscopy data. In order to unambigously ascertain
the localization of CaNDR1a, the N-terminally HAtagged version of CaNDR1a (Figure 5a) was transiently
expressed in tobacco leaves and purified PM fractions
were directly tested for the presence of the protein by
immunoblotting using HA-specific antisera. Immunoblotting of crude extracts (CE) prepared by directly boiling agroinfiltrated tissues in Laemmli buffer indicated
that HA-CaNDR1a proteins were succesfully expressed
in plant cells (Figure 7a). Most importantly, the tagged
version of CaNDR1a was significantly enriched in PM
fractions compared to microsomal ones, as also observed
for the endogenous PM-resident protein PMA2 (Figure
7b). In addition, while no signal was detected when 5, 10
and 15 μg proteins of the soluble fraction (100.000 × g
supernatant) was blotted, a HA-specific band, the intensity of which increased with the amount of total proteins
loaded, was clearly visualized (Figure 7c). Altogether,

The Arabidopsis NDR1 protein has been demonstrated to
physically interact with RIN4 both in a yeast heterologous system and in planta [24]. Searching for RIN4
sequence homologs in the HarvEST © Coffea database
resulted in the identification of a candidate contig from
Coffea canephora [GenBank: DV705409.1]. The deduced
protein sequence shares a high percentage of identity/
homology (36/53%) with the beginning of our query
sequence, AtRIN4. This region is also highly conserved
within the RIN4 family of proteins (Figure 8a). One of
the two cleavage sites that permit the hydrolysis of RIN4
upon delivery of the bacterial protease AvrRpt2 into
Arabidopsis cells [25,37,38] is also conserved in the coffee
protein (Figure 8a). In line with our previous data (Figures 5, 6 and 7), this in silico analysis points to potential
mechanistic conservation of the NDR1 function in Arabidopsis and coffee plants.

Discussion
The Arabidopsis ndr1 locus was identified in the late
1990’s using a forward genetic screen based on the loss
of resistance to the Pst strain DC3000::AvrRpt2 [20,21].
Since then, NDR1 homologous genes have been found by
sequence comparison in other plant species such as Brassica napus [39] and Vitis vinifera [40]. Many sequence
homologs (around 19 non-redundant hits within 11 plant
species) can also be retrieved from the GenBank database
by means of the BLAST P algorithm (data not shown).
However, to our knowledge, our data constitute a novel
report on the identification and characterization of a
functional NDR1 homolog, despite the plethora of orthologous candidates.
In this study, several lines of evidence indeed demonstrated that ectopic expression of CaNDR1a coding
sequence was able to rescue the phenotype of the Arabidopsis ndr1-1 null mutant. Upon infection with DC3000::
AvrRpt2, the three mutant lines expressing the coffee
transgene were found to develop hypersensitive cell
death symptoms that were absent in mutant plants (Figure 3a). This macroscopic study was further corroborated
by two independent in planta bacterial growth assays
showing that leaf populations of the bacterial pathogen in
our transgenic lines were low and comparable to those of
WT plants (Figure 3b). In addition, high overexpression
level of the coffee CaNDR1a gene in the Col-0 genetic
background was also found to confer enhanced disease
resistance to the DC3000 strain, as previously reported

when the AtNDR1 gene was overexpressed in A. thaliana
[22].
Importantly, NDR1-driven resistance in A. thaliana is
not restricted to bacterial pathogen attacks. Two reports
have demonstrated that the ndr1 mutation renders plants
susceptible to infection by the oomycete Hyaloperonospora
arabidopsidis [20] and the fungus Verticillium longisporum [41]. Therefore, given that (i) CaNDR1a is a functional homolog of the Arabidopsis NDR1 gene, and (ii)
transcripts of the former accumulate in coffee leaves
undergoing HR in response to the fungus H. vastatrix
[16,19], it would not be surprising if NDR1 proteins could
regulate the defense signaling pathway(s) leading to coffee
rust resistance. This hypothesis is currently under investigation in our laboratory using a functional approach.
Recently, we also showed that A. thaliana Col-0 plants
display a rapid non-host response to H. vastatrix. This

response is reminiscent of HR in that it prevents haustorium formation and hyphal spread in plant tissues [42].
This work raises the possibility of testing the role of NDR1
in response to the coffee leaf rust in the A. thaliana heterologous system.
As predicted by our bioinformatic analysis, imaging of
GFP6-tagged CaNDR1a protein by confocal microscopy
revealed a fluorescent pattern that was consistent with a
plasma membrane localization (Figure 6b, (i)). Colocalization experiments with a PM fluorescent protein marker
also supported this observation (Figure 6b, (iv-vi)).
Furthermore, the need of an anionic detergent like
sodium dodecyl-sulfate for the HA-tagged CaNDR1a
proteins to be extracted from tobacco leaves (Additional
file 4) indicated an association with membranes. Finally,
our biochemical approach based on the purification of
PM by two-phase PEG/dextran partitioning (Figure 7b,c)

Figure 7 The CaNDR1a protein is enriched in plasma membrane
fraction. The HA-CaNDR1a construct (see Figure 5a) was used for
carrying out two independent experiments that consisted of two
independent agroinfiltrations and plasma membrane (PM) preparations.
A representative experiment is presented in this figure. Agroinfiltration
and immunoblot conditions are described in the ‘Methods’ section. (a)
Detection of HA-CaNDR1a proteins in Agrobacterium-infiltrated leaf
tissues. Crude extract (CE) was prepared by directly incubating tissues at
95°C for 5 min in 1X Laemmli buffer [57]. (b) Detection of HA-CaNDR1a
proteins and endogenous PM-resident proteins PMA2 in microsomal
and PM fractions. PMA2 is a proton-ATPase pump previously shown to
be localized exclusively at the PM [61]. Membrane was probed using a
specific anti-PMA2 serum [58] in order to check for the purity of the PM
fraction. As expected, PMA2 proteins appeared to be significantly
enriched in the PM fraction versus the microsomal (μ) one, as also
observed for HA-CaNDR1a proteins upon stripping and reprobing of
the same blotting membrane with HA-specific antiserum (Middle
panel). Membranes were also stained with Ponceau S to show the
equal loading between both fractions, i.e. μ and PM (lower panel). (c)
HA-tagged CaNDR1a proteins are not detected in soluble fractions.
Distinct protein amounts of soluble (100.000 × g supernatant) and PM
fractions (5, 10 and 15 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted using a HA-specific antiserum.

clearly demonstrated the presence of HA-CaNDR1a proteins in tobacco PM fractions. Therefore, it is likely that
the mature CaNDR1a protein resides in the plasma
membrane of coffee cells.
No fluorescent labeling of the organelle corresponding
to a GFP6 spectrum was observed in chloroplasts,
although it had been reported previously for a tagged
version of AtNDR1 [27]. Instead, internal reticulated
labeling reminiscent of the ER network (Figure 6b, (iii))
was observed in a few cases and may correspond to
cells overloaded with the ectopic fluorescent proteins.
This observation is consistent with our results, suggesting that the CaNDR1a protein could be modified by
addition of a GPI moiety to its C-terminal part (Figure
5b). It has been well-described that proteins tethered to
the cell surface by means of a GPI anchor undergo this
sort of post-translational modification in the ER before

being sorted via the secretory pathway to their final destination, i.e., the plasma membrane.
Usually, GPI-anchored-proteins are also thought to
locate on the apoplasm side of the plasma membrane [43].
In A. thaliana, it has been clearly established that NDR1 is
attached to the plasma membrane through a C-terminal
GPI anchor [22]. It has also been inferred that the N-terminal portion of NDR1 lies within the cytoplasm because it
was found to interact with the cytosolic protein RIN4 in
planta [24]. Since the C-terminal anchor of AtNDR1 is
resistant to cleavage by phospholipase C, these data
further led to the hypothesis that the protein possesses a
transmembrane-spanning domain as a second anchor site.
This was recently corroborated by a modelling study [44]
and, in fact, the coffee protein, like its Arabidopsis relative,
was predicted to present a single transmembrane domain
(Figure 4), suggesting a similar, but atypical topology of
the two counterparts (Figure 8b).
Recently, a new mode of action of NDR1 was revealed
by Knepper et al. [44]. Based on structural homology with
mammalian integrins and the Arabidopsis late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein 14, known to be involved in
abiotic stress response [45], the aforementioned authors
investigated the possibility that AtNDR1 may control cell
integrity through PM-cell wall adhesions. Besides its wellcharacterized role as a key signaling component during
pathogen attack, a broader function for NDR1 is strongly
suggested by the data in mediating primary cellular functions in Arabidospsis through maintenance of PM-cell wall
connections [44]. From these unexpected results, the question arises as to whether or not CaNDR1a could perform a
similar function in C. arabica.
Interestingly, upon inoculation with DC3000::AvrRpt2,
successful activation of HR required NDR1-RIN4 physical
interaction. Further examination using an alanine-scanning mutagenesis strategy revealed that two amino acid
residues within the N-terminal part of NDR1 were necessary for the interaction [24]. Despite the apparent lack of
conservation of these two amino acid determinants within
the CaNDR1a end (Figure 8c), our results showing that
the coffee gene was able to restore RPS2-mediated resistance in the ndr1-1 mutant tend to prove that CaNDR1a
does interact with AtRIN4 in our transgenic lines. Thus,
this raises the possibility that mechanism(s) whereby
NDR1 proteins exert their function could be conserved in
Arabidopsis and coffee plants.
Consistent with this idea, searching for RIN4 sequence
homologs in the HarvEST© Coffea database resulted in
the identification of a candidate contig from Coffea canephora. The deduced protein shows, within its N-terminal
portion, a highly conserved region with the members of
the RIN4 family, as well as a putative conserved canonical
AvrRpt2 cleavage site (Figure 8a). Nonetheless, further
experiments are needed to answer the question as to

Figure 8 Putative mechanistic conservation of NDR1 function. (a) Alignment of RIN4 homologous sequences. The closest sequence
homologs of AtRIN4 [AGI:At3g25070] were aligned with the putative coffee RIN4 protein [harvEST:Coffea:UG5351] using ClustalX [59]. The
positions of the two AvrRpt2 cleavage sites [37,38] are highlighted in red. Accession numbers of the genes coding for the proteins presented in
the figure are as follows: Glycine max Gm [GenBank:ADJ67468]; Medicago truncatula Mt [GenBank:ACJ83941]; Populus trichocarpa Pt [GenBank:
XP_002301798]; Vitis vinifera, Vv [GenBank:CBI33050]. (b) Scheme showing how NDR1 is anchored to the plasma membrane. AtNDR1 indirectly
retains both R-proteins, RPS2 and RPM1, at the plasma membrane via its interaction with RIN4 [24,48]. (c) Comparison of the N-terminal portions
of the two orthologous NDR1 proteins from A. thaliana and C. arabica. Amino-acid residues necessary for the interaction with AtRIN4 are
highlighted in red. Intriguingly, these residues do not seem to be conserved in the coffee sequence.

whether or not CaNDR1a, like its Arabidopsis ortholog,
could serve as a PM anchor that indirectly recruits Rprotein(s) via its interaction with RIN4-like intermediates
(Figure 8b) [24,46]. Split-ubiquitin and yeast two-hybrid
systems, combined with bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), would be useful tools for tackling
this question. This might also be a faster and more
convenient strategy, as opposed to classical genetic
approaches, for the isolation of R-gene(s) conferring
resistance to H. vastatrix. To date, no coffee R-gene(s)
have been isolated despite the efforts of the coffee
research community [3,4]. The reproductive barriers
affecting genetic exchanges between diploid coffee species and the allopolyploid C. arabica have thus far prevented the successful isolation of the loci responsible for
resistance to H. vastatrix through a map-based cloning
strategy [4].

Conclusions
The functional and biochemical characterization of the
orthologous NDR1 protein from C. arabica that we
have carried out represents a crucial step towards the

elucidation of the molecular events underpinning resistance to coffee rust. It should help identify new players
in the coffee NDR1-dependent signaling pathway(s) in
the near future, and might thus be crucial for the engineering of transgenic coffee plants with broad spectrum
resistance to H. vastatrix races. The development of efficient techniques to transform and propagate coffee varieties renders these biotechnological approaches feasible
[47,48].

Methods
Plants and growth conditions

Tobacco plants (Nicotiana benthamiana) that were used
for transient expression experiments were grown in a
greenhouse, at 150 μmol/m2/s light radiance, with a 14/
10 h, 23/20°C light-dark cycle, and 60% relative
humidity.
Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia
(Col-0), ndr1-1 null mutants [20], and transgenic lines
expressing CaNDR1a were all grown in a growth chamber under short-day conditions (10 h photoperiod,
100 μmol/m2/s light fluency), at 22/20°C day/night with

Cacas et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:144
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/144

80% relative humidity. Pathogen challenge conditions are
described hereafter.
Isolation and cloning of CaNDR1a/b cDNA

As previously described [19], the 5’ end of the CaNDR1
cDNA that is referred to as DSS12 had already been
sequenced (Genbank:CO773976). 3’-RACE PCR was thus
conducted to determine the sequence of the full-length
cDNA. Total RNA (1 μg) isolated from C. arabica cv.
caturra leaves that had been challenged with H. vastatrix
for 18 hours were first reverse-transcribed using the Smart
CDS primer and a combination of the Omniscript RT
(Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and SMART PCR cDNA
synthesis kits (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA).
RACE assays were then performed using specific oligonucleotides designed in the 5’ non-coding region (3R-NDR1,
5’-CTACTTTGTTCACTGGTAGTCCCTC-3’; n3R-N
DR1, 5’-CATAATACTTCACCGGAGAACCACC-3’) and
the 5’PCR Smart primer (Clontech). The resulting 1-kb
PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-Teasy vector
(Promega, Charbonnières-les-bains, France) and finally
sequenced (Genome Express, Grenoble, France).
Constructs

To assess the complementation of the Arabidopsis null
mutant ndr1-1 [20], the open reading frame of CaNDR1a
was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA 1305.1
(Cambia, Brisbane, Australia) downstream of the strong
and constitutive 35S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic
virus. For this purpose, the iud gene was removed from
the vector by restriction digestion with BglII and BstEII
enzymes. The coding sequence of CaNDR1a was amplified
by PCR (DAP Goldstar DNA polymerase, Eurogentec,
Seraing, Belgium) using the corresponding pGEM-T clone
(GenBank:DQ335596) as a template and the following primers: CaNDR1-BglII 5’-TCAGATCTTATGGACAAAGGATGGGGC-3’, and CaNDR1-BstEII 5’-TAGGTCAC
CAAATTAATTCCCAGGAAA-3’. Digested PCR products were then ligated into the binary vector to get the
final construct.
To test the hypothesis that the C-terminal part of CaNDR1a is removed from the mature protein, single- and
double-tag constructs were created (Figure 5). CaNDR1a
was amplified by PCR using a high fidelity DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer’s instructions (PfuTurbo, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The following
primer couple was used for directly adding haemaglutinin
(HA) and poly-histidine (His) sequences to the 5’- and 3’ends of the PCR products, respectively: CaNDR1-Forward
4, 5’-CACC ATG TAT CCC TAC GAC GTA CCA GAT
TAT ATG TC AGA CCC CAG CAG CAG TGC-3’ and
CaNDR1-Reverse 3, 5’-CTA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG
GTG CAA CAG CAG AAC CAA GAA A-3’. The primers
used for obtaining the single HA-tagged version were

Page 12 of 17

CaNDR1-Forward 4 and CaNDR1-Reverse 2 (5’-CTA
CAA CAG CAG AAC CAA GA-3’). PCR fragments were
then subcloned into the pENTR-D/TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) and sequenced. To get directional cloning, the underlined nucleotide sequence was
added to the forward primers. Selected clones were
digested with Mlu-I restriction enzyme (R0198L, NEB,
OZYME, Saint Quentin Yvelines, France) before overnight
recombination with the binary vector pMDC32 [49] using
the LR Clonase II kit (Invitrogen).
The N-terminally GFP6-tagged version was produced to
examine the subcellular localization of CaNDR1a. PCR
products were amplified, subcloned, sequenced and
recombined with the binary vector pMDC43 [49] as
described above. Primers used for the initial PCR step
were as follows: CaNDR1-Forward 1, 5’-CACC ATG TCA
GAC CCC AGC AGC AGT-3’ and CaNDR1-Reverse 2.
The vector used for in planta expression of the plasma
membrane fluorescent marker (mCherry-tagged protein)
was purchased from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource
Center (ABRC) at Ohio State University (Stock # CD31008) [36].
Final binary constructs were all sequenced (Genome
Express) prior to transformation into Agrobacterium
tumefaciens by heat shock or electroporation methods.
Bacterial strain GV3101 was used for transformation of
Arabidopsis plants by floral dipping according to [50].
Strain LBA1119 was used for transient expression experiments in tobacco plants.
Pathogen challenge and growth curve assays

The Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst ) strain
DC3000 and the isogenic strains expressing the bacterial
effector proteins AvrRpt2 or AvrRps4 were provided by
Dr. Jane Glazebrook (University of Minnesota) [51]. For
pathogen challenges, bacteria were grown overnight at
28°C under mild shaking in liquid King B medium. Pst
DC3000 bacteria were selected with rifampicin (50 μg
mL-1); DC3000::AvrRpt2 and Pst DC3000::AvrRps4 with
rifampicin and tetracycline (10 μg mL-1). Bacteria were
collected by centrifugation and resuspended at 2 × 105
CFU mL-1 in physiological water (9 g NaCl/L) prior to
inoculation.
Progeny of Arabidopsis ndr1-1 T0 plants (ndr1-1::
CaNDR1a) were screened on half-strength Murashige
and Skoog medium supplemented with 30 μg mL -1
hygromycin. Transformation of individual resistant seedlings was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA as the
template and CaNDR1a-specific primers (CaNDR1-BglII
and CaNDR1-BstEII). Homozygous single locus insertion lines were then isolated by following segregation of
hygromycin-resistant plants in T2/T3 generations (Additional file 2). To assess ndr1-1 complementation, three
independent T3 lines displaying distinct expression

levels for CaNDR1a (designated T3-1, T3-2 and T3-3)
were challenged with Pst and in planta bacterial growth
was followed over a four-day period (0, 2 and 4 dpi).
Wild type (Columbia, Col-0) and ndr1-1 plants were
also inoculated for comparison. Negative controls were
infiltrated with physiological water. Half-leaves (6 to 7week-old plants) were hand-infiltrated with a 1-mL needleless syringe. Two independent experiments that gave
similar results were carried out. Each experiment comprised four replicates that were each performed by different individuals. In one replicate, each plant genotype
(5 plants/genotype) was infiltrated with water or suspensions of Pst DC3000, Pst DC3000::AvrRpt2 or Pst
DC3000::AvrRps4. Upon infiltration, plants were immediately placed in a tray covered with a plastic dome that
was removed at 24 hours post-inoculation. Bacterial
growth was monitored as follows. At each time point,
two leaves (per plant) were harvested and ground with a
mortar and pestle. The resulting mixture was serially
diluted in sterile physiological water and plated onto
solid King B medium supplemented with the appropriate
antibiotics. The bacterial population was scored two days
upon plating. Inoculation data were square-root transformed prior to ANOVA and subsequently subjected to
the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test.
When transformation failed to satisfy assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity, the non-parametric KruskalWallis test was used.
Hypersensitive and disease symptoms were also visually
assessed in an independent experiment using higher concentrations of bacterial suspension (2 × 107 CFU mL-1) for
infiltration. Samples from this experiment were also
harvested for RT-qPCR analysis.
RNA extraction, reverse transcription and real time
quantitative-polymerase chain reaction

Expression of AtNDR1 and CaNDR1a was measured as
previously described [15] with the specific primers (Additional file 5) that were previously used [42]. Each assay
was conducted in duplicate and included a negative control without template. The strong and constitutive actin
gene (At3g18780) was chosen as internal control for normalization. Specificity of amplification was estimated by
analyzing melting-temperature curves. Calculations for
gene expression quantification were carried out using the
comparative cycle-threshold method, as described previously [16].
Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression

Ten mL Agrobacterium cultures were grown overnight
under mild shaking at 30°C in regular Luria-Bertani medium containing 25 μg mL-1 rifampicin, and 50 μg mL-1
kanamycin when necessary. Bacteria were collected the
following day by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended

Page 13 of 17

in induction buffer (20 mM MES pH5.5, 10 mM MgSO4,
200 μM acetosyringone) so that OD600 nm of the solution
reaches 0.5-0.6. Upon incubation at room temperature
for 3 hours, the bacterial suspension was infiltrated onto
the abaxial side of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves (4 to 6week-old plants) using a needleless syringe. Samples for
western blot analysis and microscopy studies were harvested 2-3 dpi. Each experiment included a transformation control that was carried out by infiltrating a bacterial
clone containing a 35S::uidA intron construct [52]. Histochemical beta-glucuronidase (GUS) staining was
performed according to [53] using X-Gluc (5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-glucuronic acid) as substrate.
Protein colocalization by confocal microscopy

Subcellular localization of CaNDR1a was assessed by
means of a transient expression system as described in
the above sections. Overnight grown bacterial suspensions (GFP6-fused CaNDR1a and mCherry-fused marker) were individually induced and then mixed at 1:1
ratio before infiltration into tobacco leaves. Induction
buffer and individual bacterial suspensions were also
infiltrated as controls. Two to three days post infiltration, leaf disks (1.2 cm diameter) were punched from
the infiltrated area and directly observed with a LSM
510 Meta Zeiss upright laser scanning confocal microscope (Objective C-Apochromat 40X/1,2 water, 488 nm
laser and 505-530 band-pass filter to GFP, 543 nm laser
and 585-615 band-pass filter to mCherry). Spectral imaging was obtained with a 488 nm laser on the Meta
detector. After Lambda stack acquisition between 500
and 640 nm, the Linear Unmixing Function of confocal
microscope discriminates between the fluorescence of
GFP and mCherry in cells from reference spectra of
these molecules obtained on leaves from GFP or
mCherry plants (method of Emission Fingerprinting
from Zeiss). The autofluorescence of chlorophyll was
detected via a 650-nm long pass filter. The images were
coded green (GFP) or red (mCherry). The experiment
was repeated five times (each replicate included at least
two infiltrated leaves per plant and three independent
plants).
Plasma membrane purification

To unambigously determine the subcellular localization
of CaNDR1a proteins, the HA-tagged version of CaNDR1a was ectopically expressed in N. benthamiana
leaves under conditions described above. Plasma membrane was prepared from infiltrated leaves at 2 dpi and
purified by two-phase PEG/dextran partitioning, as previously described [54]. The purity of PM fractions was
checked by assessing the enrichment of the endogenous
PM-resident protein PMA2. Western blotting conditions
for PMA2 are described in the next section.

Protein extraction, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting

Protein samples were isolated by a two-step extraction
protocol. Briefly, frozen leaf tissues (1 g fresh weight) were
ground in ice-cold buffer 100 mM, pH 8.0, Tris buffer
(50 mL) containing 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid, 1 mM dithiothreitol and a protease inhibitor cocktail
(1 tablet for 100 mL of buffer, Complete Mini, Roche
Diagnostics, Meylan, France). Mixtures were centrifuged
for 40 min at 12,000 × g at 4°C. Protein concentration of
supernatants was determined according to [55] using BSA
as a standard. Overnight acetone precipitation was performed in order to concentrate samples. Upon western
blot analysis, these crude extracts comprising the main
soluble proteins appeared to contain neither of the two
HA-tagged CaNDR1 versions. Mono- and polytopic membrane proteins were then extracted by resuspending the
pellet in 400 μL of extraction buffer in the presence of 2%
(w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) (Additional file 4).
Mixtures were warmed in a water bath at 70°C for 15 min
and centrifuged for 25 min at 18,000 × g at room temperature. Pellets were discarded. Concentration of supernatant
proteins was determined using the bicinchoninic acid
assay (B-9643/C-2284, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-QuentinFallavier, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein samples were loaded onto 12.5% polyacrylamide gels to be separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were
transferred for immunoblot analysis by electroblotting
onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm, Hybond, GE
Healthcare, Saclay, France) using X Cell II™ Blot Modules
(Invitrogen). Successful transfer of proteins was checked
by staining with a Ponceau S solution. Membranes were
then incubated overnight at 4°C under mild shaking in a
Tris-buffered saline solution containing 4% (w/v) dry milk
(Cat. # 170-6404, Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France)
and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. They were probed with antiHA-HRP (Cat.# A00169, GenScript Corporation, Paris,
France) or anti-(His)5-HRP (Cat.# 34460, Qiagen) antibodies to detect epitope-tagged proteins. Both antibodies
were used at a 1:2000 dilution.
Protein samples used as positive controls for His blots
were prepared from Arabidopsis transgenic lines constitutively overexpressing a C-terminally His-tagged version of
AtBI1 [56]. Seeds were kindly provided by Dr. Eric Lam
(Biotechnology Center for Agriculture and the Environment, Rutgers University, USA). Proteins were extracted
as described by the authors [56]. Freshly harvested leaves
were directly ground in Laemmli buffer [57], warmed at
95°C for 5 min and centrifuged. The resulting supernatant
was resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted like other protein
samples. The expected size of epitope-tagged AtBI1 is
about 31 kDa.
Microsomal and plasma membrane samples were
resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes for immunoblotting under the exact same

Page 14 of 17

conditions as other protein samples. HA-CaNDR1a
detection was carried out as described above. When
membranes were probed with antibodies raised against
PMA2 (1:16.000 dilution) [58], a goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to HRP (Cat.# 656120, Invitrogen) was
used as secondary antibody at a 1:2000 dilution. To test
for the presence of HA-CaNDR1a, membranes probed
with the PMA2-specific antiserum were then stripped off
in the electrophoresis SDS-PAGE migration buffer in the
presence of b-mercaptoethanol (28 mM final concentration) at 50°C for 30 minutes. Membranes were then
blocked and reprobed with anti-HA-HRP antibodies.
Bioinformatic analysis

Searches for CaNDR1 sequence homologs in the GenBank database were performed by means of Basic Local
Alignment Search Tools, or BLAST [27], available online
at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Sequences were aligned using
the ClustalX algorithm (version 2.0.10) [59] and further
processed online at the BoxShade server (http://www.ch.
embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). The phylogenetic
tree was built using Phylowin freeware using the neighbor-joining method [60]. Putative GPI-anchor attachment sites were identified using the Big-Pi Plant
Predictor (http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/sat/gpi/plant_server.html) [30,31]. The occurence of signal peptides
and transmembrane domains within primary amino-acid
sequences was assessed using SignalP-3.0 (http://www.
cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) [32,33]; that of glycosylation
sites was predicted using NetNGlyc 1.0 (http://www.cbs.
dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/). The freeware Mwcalc was
used for calculations of the theoretical protein molecular
weight and isoelectric point (http://sourceforge.net/
search/?q=mwcalc). Subcellular localization of proteins
was predicted using the PSORTII program [34].
ChloroP1.1 [35] was also used for checking for the
absence of putative chloroplast-targeting sequences in
our proteins of interest. HarvEST © software that was
used to identify the coffee RIN4-like protein is available
online at http://harvest.ucr.edu/.

Additional file 3: Ectopic expression of CaNDR1a in Arabidopsis
ndr1-1 null mutant does not alter resistance to Pseudomonas
syringae pv. tomato (DC3000::AvrRps4). Inoculation experiments were
carried out as described in the ‘Methods’ section. A 2 × 10-5 cfu mL-1
inoculum was used for this experiment, and the experiment was
conducted twice. Bacterial growth was measured in planta over a fourday period. Means and standard errors (4 biological replicates) are shown
for a representative experiment. Putative differences among leaf bacterial
concentrations at T0 and 4 dpi were statistically assessed by ANOVA of
square-root transformed data followed by a SNK test (a < 0.05). Data
measured at 2 dpi were analyzed using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis
test. No significant differences in leaf bacterial concentration were
observed among the Arabidopsis genotypes.
