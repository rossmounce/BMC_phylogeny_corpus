Abstract
Background: Protein sequence motifs are by definition short fragments of conserved amino acids,
often associated with a specific function. Accordingly protein sequence profiles derived from
multiple sequence alignments provide an alternative description of functional motifs characterizing
families of related sequences. Such profiles conveniently reflect functional necessities by pointing
out proximity at conserved sequence positions as well as depicting distances at variable positions.
Discovering significant conservation characteristics within the variable positions of profiles mirrors
group-specific and, in particular, evolutionary features of the underlying sequences.
Results: We describe the tool PROfile analysis based on Mutual Information (PROMI) that enables
comparative analysis of user-classified protein sequences. PROMI is implemented as a web service
using Perl and R as well as other publicly available packages and tools on the server-side. On the
client-side platform-independence is achieved by generally applied internet delivery standards. As
one possible application analysis of the zinc finger C2H2-type protein domain is introduced to
illustrate the functionality of the tool.
Conclusion: The web service PROMI should assist researchers to detect evolutionary
correlations in protein profiles of defined biological sequences. It is available at http://promi.mpimpgolm.mpg.de where additional documentation can be found.

Background
Here we describe PROMI, a system to discover group-specific conservation characteristics in the amino acid distribution of profiles. For this we understand the sequences
forming a general profile to be associated with a userdefined biological classification label, where the number
of labels should be much smaller than the number of
rows in the profile. In detail relations between profile columns and the applied group affiliation of the sequences

forming the profile shall be investigated. The relations
will be apparent by constituting significant amino-acid
conservations, leading either to distinct amino acid consensus patterns in the analyzed groups or to knowledge
about affinity between the groups [1].
To tackle this aim the mutual information (MI) is used as
an interdependence measure of random variables Xi and Y
[2-5]. The interdependence between Xi (in our case

Schematic
Schematic multiple alignment with m fragments of length n belonging to k user defined groups. During the MI-profile-calculation
used vectors Xi and Y are marked in red, whereas Xi behaves like a sliding window from left to right (i = 1...n). X = (X1,..., Xi,...,
Xn) and Y are derived by applying the enlarged Prosite motif PDOC00028 as a search-pattern to user-defined groups of protein
sequences. By selecting fragments corresponding to the motiv a quasi multiple alignment was formed. In multitask the vector Y
is formed from the user-given group labels. Here, to get a general idea, the alignment is colored and arranged per group-label
of the vector Y. For demonstration conserved positions within the alignment (corresponding to the motif) are darkend. In case
of pairwise alignments, only 2 groups would be stated.

column of a profile X) and Y (here group affiliation) is
understood as the knowledge one gains about Y if Xi is
known and vice versa [6,7]. Small values imply small gain
of knowledge between the variables, whereas high values
point out a higher gain. The calculated MI-profile of the

significantly and thus a group-discrimination on the basis
of one profile-position is possible. Moreover the mean
value of each pairwise MI-profile leads to formation of an
elementary distance matrix D, where low MI-profilemean-values state that the molecular similarity between
groups of sequences is high opposed to higher MI-profilemean-values with a higher molecular distance in the

underlying groups. Further, by applying hierarchical clustering to D, a phylogenetic tree reflecting the distance
between its constituents can be constructed.
In the following we use "class" and "classification" synonymously with "group" and "group affiliation".

Implementation
PROMI is implemented in Perl as a web based service running on an apache web server and available for free use.
Depicted in Figure 5 the selecting of matches relating to
consensus sequences in PROSITE format [8] or given as a
regular expression is performed by using the EXPASY
ScanProsite tool [9], a Perl reference implementation for
dealing with PROSITE motifs. The chosen instances of the
motif were aligned using ScanProsite as well and the
organism-specific origin was assigned by splitting up the
NCBI none redundant protein database file [10] into species-specific "proteome" flatfiles. By upload of user-prepared sequences in FASTA format any other user-defined
classification, alternative to the classification by organism
identifier, can be applied. All calculations are implemented in the R environment [11]. To fulfil this, the
RSPerl [12] and RSvgDevice [13] packages were used to
embed R inside of Perl and to offer high order output in
svg-format rather than the default png-format (svg output
requires a plug-in for the web browser as provided by
Adobe [14]). The computation of the sequence logos is
done on the server-side by local utilisation of the Berkeley
weblogo software. The Bioperl [15] module Bio::SeqIO is
used to handle files of protein sequences.

Results and discussion
Sliding a window from column 1 to n of the profile, as can
be seen in Figure 1, leads to a MI-profile for the motif
where low MI-values correspond to positions with a high
degree of conservation among their constituent groups,
whereas high MI-values correspond to positions with
good discriminatory power in terms of the applied group
affiliation. For evaluation of significance a label permutation test giving a p-value for each mean and deviation is
performed. Therefore the MI-profile resulting from the
given (unshuffled) multiple alignment is compared
against histograms of 100 profiles derived by shuffling
each column of the underling multiple alignment. By
observing separation of shuffled and unshuffeld values in
both histograms (synonymous to a p-value near zero) a
positive supporting factor for significance is given.
Visualisation of mutual information profiles
Figure 2 shows a computed MI profile at the top and the
corresponding sequence logo aligned below. The profile is
derived by applying the PROSITE motif PDOC00028 with
the consensus pattern C-x(2,4)-C-x(3)-[LIVMFYWC]x(8)-H-x(3,5)-H for the Zinc finger C2H2-type domain on
several organism-specific "proteomes" using the tool
PROMI. To take the structurally important linker region in
zinc finger proteins of animals into consideration this pattern was enlarged at the N-and C-terminus by 7 amino
acids. Each bar within the MI-profile corresponds to a specific column of the multiple alignment showing the
obtained MI-value. As can be seen the MI-values differ

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/164

over the alignment and the cysteines and histidines at
positions 8, 13, 26, and 32 show the lowest MI-values
(0.0) since these amino acid positions have to be conserved among all sequences. The blue line indicates the
mean level, and two red lines correspond to the standard
deviation. The row under the bar plot indicates the gaps'
frequency according to the alignment (white/grey ratio
equals no gaps/gaps ratio). The histogram to the top right
explicitly shows the MI standard deviation of 100 shuffled
sample sets joined by the unshuffled standard deviation
value marked in red whereas the histogram below (bottom right) shows the same for the mean (in blue). Thus,
the histograms provide significance levels by showing the
separation of shuffled and unshuffled MI-values. All MIvalues larger or smaller than the marked red lines are
therefore obvious significant positions with organismspecific differences within the amino acid distributions. At
the bottom of Figure 2 the sequence logo derived by the
Berkeley weblogo tool [16] is depicted. Sequence logos
are computed using entropy, and thus reveal the predominant amino acids available at specific positions within
multiple alignments. Strong conservation between species
is illustrated particularly lucidly at positions 8, 13, 26, and
32, which show very low MI-values. In contrast high MIvalues point out positions with a high discrimination
between the species, as visualized for positions 21, 24 and
25. The increased MI-values in the region of positions 33–
38 coincides with the well described animal-specific
TGEKP motif [17]. However, each position within the
motif is valued differently – especially position 38 – suggesting a more differentiated view on this motif in a species-specific comparison.

MI-profiles can be constructed. The resulting MI-average
of each pair provides a distance matrix interpretable as a
species-specific distance measure (schematically given in
Figure 3), which is sensitive enough to reflect relations in
the underlying profiles. As can be seen in Figure 4, the
resulting phylogenetic tree for the C2H2-domain of comprised species Arabidopsis thaliana, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Oryza sativa, Rattus norvegicus and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae reveals the known phylogenetic relationship of
the zinc finger domains of the observed organisms on the
basis of group-and motif-specific differences. Of particular interest is the fact that S. cerevisiae is clustered with animals rather than with plants.
In case of k given groups (see Figure 1)

Seemingly a very naive and rough approach disregarding
protein steric structures as well as amino acid proximities
the method is coherent. MI as a distance measure satisfies
the four axioms of a metric: non-negativity, identity of
indiscernibles, symmetry and triangle inequality [18].

the inclusion of a user-prepared multiple alignment,
derived by BLAST and CLUSTAL is conveniently possible.
The number of selected instances per group can be balanced by limiting the fragments to a suitable number.
Regardless of the abovementioned issues, the proposed
method is a fast and convenient approach for the motifspecific analysis of hundreds of sequences derived by
homology of ortholog or paralog gene and protein
domain families.

Conclusion
As aforementioned the method we have outlined may not
only be applied in a species-specific context, but may also
be understood in terms of a phylogenetic identifier, gene
expression values or any other desired classification by the
user. Influence of potential negative thresholds, as for
example false positive matches using PROSITE motifs for
sequence search, or a possible bias because of highly differing amounts of matching sequence fragments per

Multiple alignment and mutual information
Given a motif, describing sequence fragments of length n,
the potential m matching sequence fragments with length
n can be arranged as a multiple alignment as seen in Figure 1. Thereby each of the n columns corresponds to one
position of the motif. Furthermore the m fragments
belong to k groups reflecting the user-applied classification (m >> k). By setting up this structure n m-dimensional
vectors Xi (with i = 1...n) are constituted, each consisting
of characters from the amino acid one letter code plus one
additional letter for gaps. All Xi combine as the matrix X =
(X1, X2,..., Xi,..., Xn) reflecting the profile. Additionally an
m-dimensional vector (Y) is formed from the classification consisting of a discrete set of group labels, where each
label corresponds per row to the group affiliation of a
sequence fragment in matrix X at the same row.

A convenient measure of correlation between two discrete
random variables such as in our case Xi and Y is the

The entropy H(Xi) is calculated using the number of
occurrences of each character x within the vector Xi of
length m. The same is used for H(Y). The joint entropy
H(Xi, Y) is derived by concatenating the characters x and
the group labels y and again calculating the likelihood of
all possible combinations. Furthermore each MI value is
multiplied by a factor giving the likelihood of gaps in each
column. This heuristic approach was adapted from the

formed up by calculating the mean over all columns of

This mean describes the distance of amino acid conservation between the groups of sequences. In the case of our
