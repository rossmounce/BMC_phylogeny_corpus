<p>Global analysis of four minisatellite subspecies
Genetic exchanges among House Mouseloci in House Mouse reveals unexpected long-range gene flow between populations and subspe-

Background: Four hypervariable minisatellite loci were scored on a panel of 116 individuals of
various geographical origins representing a large part of the diversity present in house mouse
subspecies. Internal structures of alleles were determined by minisatellite variant repeat mapping
PCR to produce maps of intermingled patterns of variant repeats along the repeat array. To
reconstruct the genealogy of these arrays of variable length, the specifically designed software
MS_Align was used to estimate molecular divergences, graphically represented as neighbor-joining
trees.

refereed research

Results: Given the high haplotypic diversity detected (mean He = 0.962), these minisatellite trees
proved to be highly informative for tracing past and present genetic exchanges. Examples of
identical or nearly identical alleles were found across subspecies and in geographically very distant
locations, together with poor lineage sorting among subspecies except for the X-chromosome
locus MMS30 in Mus mus musculus. Given the high mutation rate of mouse minisatellite loci, this
picture cannot be interpreted only with simple splitting events followed by retention of
polymorphism, but implies recurrent gene flow between already differentiated entities.

information

Conclusion: This strongly suggests that, at least for the chromosomal regions under scrutiny, wild
house mouse subspecies constitute a set of interrelated gene pools still connected through long
range gene flow or genetic exchanges occurring in the various contact zones existing nowadays or
that have existed in the past. Identifying genomic regions that do not follow this pattern will be a
challenging task for pinpointing genes important for speciation.

Background

To address the significance of molecular polymorphisms, one
option is to look at their distribution at population-, species-,
and genus-wide scales. Polymorphic genetic features, such as
variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) have long been
considered to be the most informative markers due to their
intrinsic high variability [1]. Minisatellites are particularly
informative, as shown by their early use in forensics and
paternity testing in humans [2]. Their very high level of variability made them ideal for DNA fingerprinting, linkage analysis, and population studies [3]. While semi-automated PCR
analysis of microsatellites has now largely replaced minisatellite-based systems, DNA typing of minisatellites still provides
a powerful and highly discriminating tool. Unlike microsatellites that are composed of short repeats of a few base pairs
(typically 1 to 6 bp), minisatellites are intermingled arrays of
usually GC-rich variant repeats ranging from 10 to over 100
bp depending on the locus, and with array lengths varying
from 100 bp to over 20 kilobases (kb). Intermingled patterns
of variant repeats along the array can be charted by minisatellite variant repeat mapping by PCR (MVR-PCR) to provide
exquisitely detailed information on internal allele structure.
This strategy has been used extensively at human hypervariable minisatellites, with germline mutation rates greater than
0.5% per gamete, to obtain crucial information needed to
understand repeat turnover processes at these VNTRs
(reviewed in [4,5]). Due to the unstable nature of minisatellites together with the frequently complex inter-allelic conversion-like germline mutation process, pedigree analysis can
be performed for only a limited number of generations before
it becomes impossible to trace back the original allele
structure.
In the mouse genome, the situation appears to be more favorable for pedigree and genealogy analysis. Systematic isolation has identified human-like minisatellite loci (for example,
GC-rich, highly polymorphic) [6]. However, none were found
to be hypermutable. Analyses of mouse semen DNA demonstrated that mutant alleles were rare, with mutation frequencies at or below 5 × 10-6 per sperm. However, these
frequencies are an underestimate since mutations involving
gain or loss of one to three repeats, likely to be the most common type of mutation, would have been lost during mutant
enrichment by DNA fractionation [7]. Also, female mutation
rates are not known. In contrast to human minisatellites,
mouse sperm mutants arise by simple intra-allelic duplication and deletion, similar to those observed in human blood
DNA [7,8]. This combination of high polymorphism, lower
mutation rate, and relatively simple intra-allelic turnover
mechanisms make mouse minisatellites potentially highly
informative for species-wide population studies. Nevertheless, reconstructing the genealogy of alleles is hampered by
the fact that aligning their sequences is difficult. Recently,
however, development of new algorithms specifically
designed to treat tandem repeat data has made analysis of
large MVR datasets possible (MS_Align; [9]). This allows

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/5/R80

quantification of molecular divergence between alleles and
renders these information-rich loci amenable to phylogenetic
analysis. This allows the unique properties of rapid simple
mutation and complex internal structure at minisatellites to
be exploited to provide far more informative systems compared to classic markers such as non-repetitive DNA or
microsatellites.
We therefore used MVR-PCR together with the MS_Align
algorithm to study for the first time the distribution of allelic
variants at four different minisatellite loci in the house mouse
(Mus musculus). This species has radiated outside its original
range within the last 0.5 million years, leaving at its periphery
three well recognized subspecies with recent ancestry (M. m.
domesticus, M. m. musculus, and M. m. castaneus) and populations of a more ancient descent at its center [10]. Its range
has more recently expanded outside Eurasia because of commensalism with man [11], allowing many recent secondary
contacts to occur, leading to a certain amount of re-admixture. The possibility of a gene re-entering a gene pool depends
strongly on the kind of selective pressures exerted on it during
its co-evolution from its original background. The occurrence
of progressive incompatibilities building up during the course
of allele divergence (so called Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities) may impede this phenomenon. At the opposite end
of the spectrum, facilitation may occur if some strong selective advantage is provided by the gene irrespective of the
recipient background. These contrasting possibilities will
shape the coalescence of individual chromosomal segments
when differentiated gene pools have co-existed for appreciable amounts of time, as in the house mouse. The question of
allele circulation throughout the species range is presently an
important focus for understanding the impact of selective
forces that shape complex eukaryotic genomes. However, for
a standard nuclear DNA sequence the intra-specific nucleotide divergence is generally small, resulting in very short and
poorly informative coalescent branches within subspecies. To
characterize allele circulation among house mouse subspecies, we report intra-specific coalescence analysis at four minisatellite loci, MMS24, 26, 80, and 30 [4], located on
chromosomes 7 (22 cM), 9 (68 cM and 79 cM), and X (43 cM),
respectively, on a panel of 116 individuals of various geographical origins.

Results
Array size and map structure
The entire data set is available at [12]. The geographical origin
of the mice used in this study is shown in Figure 1. The
number of different alleles and overall allelic diversity is provided in Table 1 for each of the four minisatellite loci analyzed. All loci proved to be highly variable in length and array
structure (He 0.90-0.99). Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 show examples of
MVR structures encountered. DOM, MUS, CAS stand for
domesticus, musculus and castaneus respectively, while CEN
designates the less well defined central populations. For each

Figures 6, 7, 8, 9 show the coalescence patterns observed at
each locus across a reduced panel of haplotypes. For the sake
of legibility, only the locales analyzed for at least three loci
have been included in the trees, but the results presented
below were qualitatively identical to what could be inferred
from the complete set of individuals. One striking feature is
the variable degree of subspecific coalescence observed,
which goes from almost complete resolution of the domesticus, musculus, and castaneus clades for sex chromosome

The MMS30 tree (Figure 8) offers the best subspecific resolution. When rooted by two European spretus alleles, starting
from the top node we first observe a not very solidly placed
subtree with two CAS/CEN alleles (a), and a reasonably wellsupported clade (Re = 0.66; see Materials and methods for a
description of Re) encompassing all the rest. This further
splits into two equally well-supported clades (Re = 0.73 (b)
and Re = 0.79 (c)). The uppermost one contains 24 out of 30
CAS/CEN alleles, while the bottommost constitutes a paraphyletic grouping of three independent DOM clades (with Re
= 0.86 (d), 0.79 (f), and 1.00 (h)), a small CAS/CEN clade of
four haplotypes (Re = 0.88 (g)), and a well defined MUS clade

small clades of almost pure subspecific composition could be
identified. These small clades were robust with respect to variations in penalty parameters used to align alleles (see Materials and methods); this robustness can be observed when
comparing for each locus a sub-optimal tree (given in supplementary Figure S3 at [12]) and the corresponding optimal
tree of Figures 6 to 9. Below, we list noticeable, well supported

a multiple alignment according to the unpublished method of
Rivals (MS_Alimul) of some representative MVR codes for
each subspecies. While all haplotypes were employed in the
pairwise estimation of genetic distance between haplotypes
performed with MS_Align, computations with MS_Alimul
were made for subsets of similar MVR maps, otherwise the
proposed alignment would require too many gaps. We also
included unaligned short and long alleles, as well as some of
the more divergent alleles encountered. We supply for each
locus the set of alleles whose MVR codes were identical as

The remainder of the tree shows a high level of interspersion.
Between clades (b) and (c), one notices a subtree containing
mostly domesticus but also two castaneus alleles,
CAS_THAI_Pathumtani_16108
and
CAS_THAI_Pathumtani_16144. These 'intruders' exhibit a
high level of similarity to domesticus alleles as testified by
their average distances to the set of alleles of each Mus musculus subspecies: 40 to DOM and 52 to CAS for allele 16108,
and 37 to DOM and 45 to CAS for allele 16144 (see
supplementary Table S2 at [12]). Indeed, they are included in
the multiple alignment of DOM alleles of Figure 2, where
their similarity to domesticus alleles and their dissimilarity to
other CAS/CEN haplotypes becomes apparent. Such
intruders, which exist at all loci and cannot be interpreted as
artifacts (since they are similar but nevertheless different
from alleles of another subspecies), highlight the capacity of
the alignment program to correctly handle complex cases.
(Examples of intruders at all loci but MMS30 are listed in
supplementary Table S2).
In all four trees, the nearest neighbors of M. spretus haplotypes are CAS/CEN haplotypes. Moreover, the MMS26 and
MMS30 trees agree on the split CAS/CEN-SPR against DOMMUS. It is interesting that MMS26, 30, and 80 have similar
variance accounted for (VAF) values (0.92, 0.93, 0.91 respectively) but different patterns of subspecific coalescence.

why these haplotypes are not located in the CAS/CEN part of
the tree with all other CAS/CEN haplotypes, and whether this
reflected homoplasy and the over-simplification of the evolutionary model used in the alignment algorithm, or instead
truly reflects alleles identical by descent. When looking at the
alignment in Figure 4 for locus MMS30, it is striking that
these intruder haplotypes differ considerably from the typical
CAS/CEN MVR codes, and resemble much more the DOM or

MUS haplotypes. Indeed, they share several sequence motifs
(all displayed in bold in Figure 4) either with the DOM codes
('G-G- [YK]-W- [YK]-K-K' just before the 3'-most 'o'-motif) or
with both the DOM and MUS codes ('K-K-Y(2,3)-K-G' at the
3' end, or 'G-Y-K-K-K-W-G' at the 5' end of DOM and at about
the tenth position in MUS codes), and none of these motifs
occur in the other CAS/CEN haplotypes. This supports clearly
the neighborhood of DOM and MUS in the tree, and gives evidence that these 'intruders' do actually carry DOM-like haplotypes. In addition, note that the nine-variant motif ('G-Y-YK-G-Y-K-Y-K') at the 5' end of MUS haplotypes is specific for
this subspecies.

Identical haplotypes shared among geographically or
taxonomically distant samples
Several identical or quasi-identical alleles are shared by geographically distant locations (Table S2 at [12]). For instance,
at locus MMS24, allele DOM_TUNI_Sfax_10247L (CTTCCCCCCCCTTCTTTCTTTTToTTCC)
is
identical
to
DOM_USA_Casitas_10712L,
while

(CTTCCCCCCCoTToTTTCTTTTTTTTCCT) differs from DOM_DANE_Odis_DDO
(CTTCCCCCCCoTTTTTTCTTTTTTTTCCT) by a single
mutation
(in

More
surprisingly,
CAS_CHIN_Gansu_16072L (CTTTCTTC) is just one T
shorter than DOM_MARO_Azrou_DMZ2 (CTTTCTTCT).
Even
more
unexpectedly,
DOM_BULG_Vlas_DBV,
DOM_TUNI_Monastir_22MO,
and
SPR_MARO_Azzemour_9852 share the same haplotype
(GYKKKGWGKoGGYWYKKoKKKYYYKG) at this locus of the
X chromosome. There are many other examples where
identical haplotypes are shared among geographically distant
subspecies, as shown at tree tips or in the complete data set
(Table S1 at [12]). Occasionally, some haplotypes may be
over-represented and geographically widespread. A striking
example
is
the
MMS30
haplotype
(GKKKKWGKKYKWKGWGHoGoKWKKKWKYY), which is
encountered 28 times in Taiwan and Madagascar, or the
MMS24 haplotype (TTTTTTCTTTTTCCoTTTCTTTCCCCCC),
which is encountered 10 times in India, Taiwan, and
Madagascar.

From the numbers of alleles and overall allelic diversities
given in Table 1, the locus with the smallest diversity is the Xlinked MMS30, which is consistent with the smaller effective
size of the X-chromosome compared to autosomes (a theoretical three-quarter ratio). Taking this into account, the diversity values in Table 1 are remarkably similar at each locus,
which may reflect a globally uniform mutation rate at mouse
minisatellites. This is consistent with the fact that the optimal
trees were obtained with similar mutation penalty parameters for all loci.

On purely theoretical grounds, such intermingling could be
due to incomplete lineage sorting leading to the preservation
of ancestral polymorphisms in the various subspecific groups.

Incomplete lineage sorting

However, even if several molecular lineages were to be kept
segregating for a long time inside the subspecies, they would
have acquired autapomorphic mutations that could allow
them to be distinguished easily, and would not yield close
molecular similarity, such as seen here for some mouse minisatellites. With the mutation rate estimated above, the probability of having two haplotypes remaining identical after
50,000 generations of divergence is less than 1%, while after
10,000 generations only, one expects, on average, 5 mutations per lineage. This necessarily means that exchanges of
alleles have occurred by migration, and that those migrations
are not restricted to within subspecies. On the other hand, it
is also possible to find little subclades of closely related
regionalized alleles that testify to local evolution of a probably
former foreign migrant haplotype, as exemplified in the

reports

In order to draw biological inference from the trees built from
our MVR analysis, we have to address the issue of evolutionary noise due to the variable nature of the VNTRs used, specifically homoplasy arising by convergent evolution of allele
structures. Thus, the validity of the emplacement of, say, a
small CAS/CEN subtree inside a DOM clade has to be
questioned as well as the reality of similar or identical alleles
shared by very distinct geographic samples. Several arguments suggest low levels of homoplasy in our data set. First,
there is a good tree arboricity as measured by the VAF, being
86% for the tree of MMS24 and above 90% for the three
others, and many clades are well supported with an Re index
above 0.8. Second, there is a paucity of long branches inside
various well-identified clades. In such clades, homoplasy on
complex structures is expected to yield spurious imperfect
matches between convergent alleles that would translate into
long branches. The latter is not observed in the examples provided above, where the structural complexity of long alleles
minimizes the likelihood of convergent evolution. This may
not be the case, however, for very small alleles like the spretus
ones, which are located toward the root of the tree. However,
for long haplotypes, which are predominant in our data set,
homoplasy may be discarded as the primary source of lack of
reciprocal monophyly.

instance, would allow a complete sorting of gene lineages. An
estimation of this can be inferred from the coalescence of
mitochondrial genes as reported in [14]. In this report, the
intra-subspecific coalescence depth (estimated as twice the
average intra-subspecific pairwise nucleotide divergence) is
smaller than the divergence time (as estimated by the net
divergence between taxa). These two values are 0.98% and
3.55%, respectively, for the DOM/MUS comparison, which
makes a ratio of 0.27, much smaller than 1. Therefore, there is
a clear monophyly of each mitochondrial lineage with a complete mitochondrial lineage sorting for these two subspecies
(this is less clear for the CAS/CEN mitochondrial haplotypes
[16]). For nuclear genes, the coalescence should be larger
than for mitochondria due to increased effective population
size, while the divergence time should be the same for all neutral genes. So the ratio of coalescence over divergence is
expected to be four-fold larger than for the mitochondrial
data set. Extrapolating from the mitochondrial divergences
computed by [14], this would give a ratio of 1.08 for the DOM/
MUS comparison and 1.75 and 2.35 for the DOM/CAS and
MUS/CAS comparisons, respectively. Thus, we are, in principle, at the limit where one could predict complete coalescence
of nuclear genes to eventually occur for domesticus and musculus, while incomplete lineage sorting is expected to occur
for haplotypes retained in the CAS (and even more so in the
CEN) coalescent. Note that if the coalescence of the mitochondrial genome has been reduced by selection as suggested
for species with large effective sizes [17], our mitochondrial
value would be an underestimate, and thus incomplete lineage sorting is even more likely for nuclear genes unless they
are also subjected to selection. This fits well with what we
observe in the trees since monophyly is never attained except
for musculus at MMS30 and probably corresponds to the fact
that musculus and domesticus subspecies are likely to have
experienced evolutionarily smaller effective sizes while
migrating out of the Indian subcontinent cradle than the
central populations that supposedly occupied their distribution range for a longer time [16,18].

Homoplasy versus migration

Bonhomme et al. R80.11

comment

MMS80 is one of the most unstable loci. Its mutation frequency has been directly estimated in the wild derived strain
DHA male germline at 5.10-6 per sperm, while no mutations
were detected in Balb/c sperm [7]. However, considering an
average haplotypic diversity inside subspecies for the three
autosomal loci of 0.83 (calculation not shown) one can get an
approximation of the evolutionary mutation rate μ from the
equilibrium relationship He = 4Neμ/(1 + 4Neμ) of circa 2.5 ×
10-5/generation for an effective size of Ne = 5.104. This last
value can itself be deduced from the inverse relationship
adapted for haploid genomes Ne = He/μ(1-He) using an average mitochondrial D-Loop nucleotide diversity inside subspecies of 0.5% (from [14]) and a D-Loop mutation rate of 10-7/
nucleotides/generation (from [15]). If Ne = 5.104 is an overestimate in the mouse, then the MMS mutation rate may be
even higher. One reason for this discrepancy with published
data may reside in the method for isolating mutant alleles by
size-enrichment small-pool PCR (SESP-PCR). This did not
permit the detection of length variations smaller than two or
three repeats, nor mutations that did not affect the size of the
array [7]. Nevertheless, the mutation rate of the mouse minisatellite loci studied here is higher than previously reported
by a factor of approximately 20.

in the past, when taxa were less diverged than they are now.
Indeed, before expansion with agriculture during the Neolithic, all subspecies were very likely restricted to a much
smaller region going from the Near East and the Fertile Crescent to the southern slopes of the Himalayas, Elbourz, and
Caucasus, and maybe around the Black and Caspian seas, but
they were not elsewhere (this is well documented for domesticus westward bound in, for example, [19] and the literature
cited therein, and the same should apply for musculus and
castaneus northward and eastward). So indeed, these subspecies were all rather close to each other and ready to form
local hybrid zones at each expansion/contraction cycle due to
Pleistocene glaciations.
Altogether, the general lack of monophyly of the three main
subspecific groups, together with the traces of recent and less
recent migration events among them, is most likely due to the
permeability of the various subspecies' genomes to foreign
alleles, at least for the loci considered here. Note that this is
less so for the X-linked locus MMS30, which has the best resolution of subspecies coalescences and shows a lesser amount
of exchange between subspecies. This is expected since sexchromosomes have been shown to accumulate interspecific
incompatibility genes at a higher rate than autosomes for several reasons, such as smaller effective population size, less
recombination, sexual selection, and arms races imposed by
segregation distortion and genome imprinting. This is in
agreement with the recently reported analysis of molecular
diversity of six X-linked and seven autosomal loci [20]. Nevertheless, we show that for the locus considered and its surrounding, the X chromosome inside domesticus exists under
at least three variant forms (see above) that are not
necessarily closer to each other than they are to the musculus
one; this may reflect past exchanges and introgression, even
for the X chromosome.
These results may appear to conflic with previously published
data concerning the identity and genetic borders of the various entities inside M. musculus. Most of the previous literature, however, concerns mitochondrial DNA, and it is true
that at the global scale and at first glance, the distribution of
matrilines fits rather well with taxonomy, and that the Latin
trinomens seem to correspond to three well-defined entities
(some authors have even considered them as full species
[14]). Nevertheless, there are some exceptions to this, with
evidence of mitochondrial DNA admixture even rather far
from hybrid zones. Moreover, reciprocal monophyly is not
completely granted either; the rooting of the so-called 'oriental' matrilines [16,21] that would characterize what we term
here CEN (for central) is clearly a complex and poorly
resolved matter. On the other hand, nuclear sequence data
are rarely available with the same configuration (that is, more
than ten individuals per subspecies). So most of the time
there are only one or two sequences per taxon, which is not
enough to detect the amounts of reticulation such as we have
seen. At last, these possibilities of genome wide gene

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/5/R80

exchanges are reflected by a growing number of single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data that show that except
for few specific regions [22,23], the three archetypal subspecific genomes are still largely compatible, as exemplified by
the mosaic constitution of laboratory strains themselves [2224]. Moreover, these SNP studies show that, when focusing
for instance on the comparison between wild-derived strains
of musculus and domesticus, three kinds of chromosomal
segments can be sketched: some where the two subspecies are
maximally divergent; some where intra- and intersubpecific
levels of SNPs are comparable and rather high; and some with
both low divergence and low polymorphism. Since we have no
reason to consider that these mostly non-coding SNPs have
highly variable mutation rates, the last two categories are
good candidates for encompassing a continuum of situations,
from retention of purely ancestral polymorphism to recent
exchanges, with all possible intermediate situations.

Divergence among subspecies
If one computes net average divergence among groups estimated by the mutational steps measured along the tree (tree
distance; not shown), one obtains the same picture at all loci,
with CAS being closest to CEN (5.6 steps on average over all 4
loci), while DOM and MUS are always invariably closer to
CEN than to CAS (alignment scores of 18.4 and 24.7 for DOM,
and 20.8 and 26.5 for MUS), the divergence between them
being 21.1. If one then considers the intra-group average
divergence, the CAS haplotypes show a tendency to be less
diversified (34.9 steps) than MUS (43.4), CEN (49.5), or
DOM (54.2). The castaneus alleles thus show the least diversity while the domesticus ones show the most. This is in good
concordance with the fact that castaneus is a peripheral subspecies most recently derived from the central populations.
The fact that domesticus displays greater diversity than the
central populations is somewhat surprising since the latter
populations are thought to have a longer history in the same
place than domesticus, castaneus or musculus. This may be
due to the fact that DOM MMS alleles tend to be longer than
the CEN alleles (30.5 repeats on average versus only 24.15 for
CEN), which will inflate the intra-group divergence even if the
coalescence time is indeed less.

Conclusion

Our murine VNTR study shows that these complex DNA
structures when handled in a meaningful way with adequate
alignment tools can reveal informative evolutionary data on
species-wide genetic flow. This may not be the case when
using simple non-repetitious sequences that may not possess
enough intrinsic variation as well as simpler tandem repeats
like microsatellites where mutation history is readily lost
through homoplasy. Therefore, minisatellite VNTRs comprise an invaluable tool to identify past and present
exchanges within the species range. Indeed, we show using
our panel of wild-caught and wild-derived mice that such is
the case: generalized non-reciprocal monophyly as well as

Alignment of MVR maps, distance, and penalties

information

To recover the relationships between alleles observed at a
locus, one needs to quantify the molecular divergence
between their MVR maps. For each locus separately, we considered the set of MVR maps of all haplotypes represented in
our sample. The alphabet of possible variants is defined by
the MVR-PCR experiments, such that MVR maps are
sequences written in locus specific alphabets. Simply counting the difference of length between alleles yields a poor estimate of allele divergence, as illustrated in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5
(two very different haplotypes may have the same length).
Obviously, one needs to consider not only the number of variants, but also the sequence of variants. Classic alignment
methods suitable for DNA sequences cannot be applied to
MVR maps. Indeed, these methods count only point mutations and disregard the main source of sequence divergence

interactions

MVR-PCR uses variant repeats within minisatellite loci to
generate internal maps of minisatellite alleles by a simple
PCR assay [26]. Prior to MVR mapping, mouse minisatellite
alleles were amplified to visible level using specific flanking
primers. Flanking primers were (nomenclature: -, 5' of the
array; +, 3' of the array; distance in kb from the repeated
array; F, forward; R, reverse): MMS30-0.02/F, 5'-CTGGGATAGATTCATGCACAGC-3'; MMS30+0.03/R, 5'-CCTGCCACATGGTTAGTTACCT-3'. Amplifying primers and PCR

We selected three autosomal (MMS24, 26 and 80) and one Xlinked (MMS30) minisatellite (Table 2). MMS26 and 80 are
both located in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 9, 4
Mb apart. All autosomal minisatellites were located in
intronic regions (Table 2). While distal from the promoter
region, it is possible that these intronic minisatellites may
contain enhancer regions that could potentially affect gene
expression. However, the wide range of size observed at these
minisatellites in M. musculus would suggest only a minimal,
if any, effect of these VNTRs on gene expression.

Description of the loci

We selected 116 samples from the Montpellier DNA collection
to represent the main subspecies of M. musculus and its central populations. Some individuals were not original wildcaught mice, but were the offspring of mice that were bred in
closed colonies of a single origin in our genetic repository in
Montpellier. Their geographical origin is shown on the map in
Figure 1 and incorporated in the individual designation of
haplotypes available in the first column of Table S1 in [12].
The number of individuals studied at each location may vary
slightly from one locus to another. Several individuals of the
closely related species M. spretus were taken as an outgroup.
Altogether, 92, 90, 82, and 87 wild or wild-derived mice were
scored for MMS24, 26, 30, and 80, respectively. Additionally,
laboratory strains' DNA (AKR, C57Bl6, DBA/2, C3H, Balb/c,
SWR and SJL) was used as standards and included in the
study. Routine laboratory strategies were taken to reduce to a
minimum any possibility of DNA contamination or mix ups
with such small batch processing during DNA extraction.

Animals and DNAs

conditions for MMS24, 26 and 80 have been previously
described [6]. MMS30 amplifications were carried out at
96°C for 30 s, 66°C for 30 s, 70°C for 3 minutes for 28 cycles
as described elsewhere [3]. PCR products were resolved by
electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gels. Two- and threestate MVR-PCR were developed at four independent mouse
minisatellite loci using the same methodology as previously
established [6,26]. MMS30 MVR-PCR reactions were carried
out at 96°C for 50 s, 56°C for 45 s, 70° for 3 minutes for 24
cycles. The 5' flanking primer was MMS30-0.02/F. Two-state
MVR specific 3' primers together with their final concentration per reaction were MMS30/TAG-CT (Y repeat: 5'tcatgcgtccatggtccggaATCTTCTGTATAGTGTGAACT-3',

are highlighted in bold and the TAG primer sequence is in

found elsewhere [6]. All subsequent MVR-PCR manipulations, including two-state and three-state MVR mapping, gel
electrophoresis and detection were carried out as previously
described [6,7]. Again, particular care was taken to avoid mixing up of the various samples. Each MMS locus was processed
in two phases and some DNA was typed at least twice. No discrepancy was observed.

comment

current and less recent secondary exchanges between subspecies are a reality. Interestingly, this is true even for the Xchromosome despite its demonstrated tendency to diverge
faster than autosomes. Indeed, sex-chromosomes are, by
nature, prone to accumulate incompatibility genes, which
supposedly render it less likely to cross subspecies borders
[25]. Our analysis reveals a complex history at the MMS30 Xlinked locus, with multiple origins for the castaneus and
domesticus haplotypes (Figure 8). Thus, these wild mice
genomes constitute a set of interrelated gene pools that are
still able to exchange genes from time to time, at least for the
four chromosomal locations and the sample of wild genomes
analyzed. Recent SNP studies also illustrate this point
[22,23], although SNPs do not allow as refined an analysis of
the coalescence of a particular point in the genome as MMS
do, this last technique potentially constituting an interesting
means of revealing past and present forces having shaped the
distribution of their flanking region species-wide. The overall
picture fits well with the supposed phylogeographic scenario
in which castaneus is a recent offshoot from the so-called central populations that would have occupied the species' ancestral range, while domesticus and musculus would have
diverged earlier when migrating out.

in VNTR, namely the tandem duplication or contraction
events. The tandem duplication of a variant copies a variant
and inserts the copy next to the template (for example,
G→GG), and the reciprocal event, the tandem contraction of
a variant, deletes one among two identical adjacent variants
(for example, GG→G). In VNTR evolution, tandem
duplication and contraction are considered to be much more
frequent than point mutations. Therefore, to compare MVR
maps we use the alignment program MS_Align [9], whose
mutational model comprises, beyond insertion, deletion, and
substitution, also tandem duplication and tandem
contraction of a variant. The difference between tandem
duplication and insertion is that, in an insertion, the inserted
variant is not required to be identical to its adjacent variants.
The propensity of the different mutations in the output alignments is controlled by the parameter penalties assigned to
each mutation by the user. In the scoring scheme, the penalties are denoted by M for a substitution, I for an insertion, D
for a deletion, A for a tandem duplication, and C for a tandem
contraction. Each penalty is independent of the variant
involved in the mutation event and our model is symmetrical,
that is, I = D and A = C. Note that once being introduced by a
duplication, a variant may later be changed into another by a
substitution (which altogether is like an insertion); thus,
duplication followed by a substitution may be preferred to an
insertion, depending on the penalties.
Now, given a scoring scheme that associates a penalty to each
type of mutation event, MS_Align computes an optimal alignment of minimum score between two MVR maps. An optimal
alignment is the sequence of mutations that transforms one
map into the other and whose sum of penalties is minimum.
The penalties sum of an alignment is called the alignment
score or the distance (since it is a metric distance in the mathematical sense). We compared in a pairwise fashion all MVR
maps of a set with MS_Align [9], and this yields a pairwise
distance matrix (with one distance per allele pair).
A present limitation of this approach is the undifferentiated
treatment of the null variant (a repeat unit that does not
prime during PCR due to the presence of an unknown
sequence variant), with all nulls being treated as identical.
Another limitation is the restriction of duplications and
contractions to operate on single variant, and not on blocks of
consecutive variants; that is, if the evolution of one allele has
involved a duplication of a block of several variants (for example, TCoT → TCoTCoT), then MS_Align will find the best
optimal alignment with single variant duplications, but without block duplication, and will thus overestimate the alignment score. Some alleles do indeed show evidence of these
larger-scale duplications, such as the reduplicated oTTT
motif in the MMS24 allele MUS_ARMN_Megri_MAM from
positions 11 to 18 (see the third multiple alignment for
MMS24 in Figure 2).

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/5/R80

Inference of locus coalescence
For a given locus, these comparisons yield a distance matrix
giving the alignment score between any pair of MVR maps.
The alignment score is a distance metric in the mathematical
sense. We use the distance matrix to reconstruct an evolutionary tree for the MVR maps using an improved neighborjoining algorithm called FastME [27]. To determine the
robustness of the obtained coalescence with respect to alignment parameters, we iterated this procedure for 40 different
combinations of penalties: A = C = 1, M = 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,
or 16, and I = D = 8, 10, 15, 20, or 25. The most influential criterion is the ratio between the amplification and substitution
penalties; thus, we set arbitrarily A = C = 1 and let M vary. For
VNTR loci, amplification or contraction of a single variant are
the most frequent events and are more probable than a
variant substitution; this is the rationale for the chosen penalties. As bootstrapping is not meaningful for this type of
data, we use an alternative to assess the confidence of each
tree and of each node in the tree. We computed two
mathematical criteria [28], the VAF and the rate of elementary well-designed quartets (Re). The VAF quantifies the adequacy of representing the distances between maps by a tree;
the Re of an internal edge measures the average level of confidence over all possible quadruplets of taxa linked by this
edge. The tree Re is an average of the edges' Re over all
internal edges; it gives a global confidence value for the whole
tree. This enables us to select the most reliable trees and to
see whether sub-optimal trees differ greatly from the optimal
(robustness). The optimal trees were obtained with penalties
M = 6, I = 20 for MMS24, M = 8, I = 20 for MMS26, M = 6, I
= 20 for MMS30, and M = 6, I = 8 for MMS80. Re is the value
reported on the trees. For each locus, the values of criteria of
each parameter combination are reported in Table S4 of the
supplementary material [12].
