Abstract
Background: The splicing of pre-mRNAs is conspicuously often variable and produces multiple
alternatively spliced (AS) isoforms that encode different messages from one gene locus. Computational
studies uncovered a class of highly similar isoforms, which were related to tandem 5'-splice sites (5'ss) and
3'-splice sites (3'ss), yet with very sparse anecdotal evidence in experimental studies. To compare the types
and levels of alternative tandem splice site exons occurring in different human organ systems and cell types,
and to study known sequence features involved in the recognition and distinction of neighboring splice
sites, we performed large-scale, stringent alignments of cDNA sequences and ESTs to the human and
mouse genomes, followed by experimental validation.
Results: We analyzed alternative 5'ss exons (A5Es) and alternative 3'ss exons (A3Es), derived from
transcript sequences that were aligned to assembled genome sequences to infer patterns of AS occurring
in several thousands of genes. Comparing the levels of overlapping (tandem) and non-overlapping
(competitive) A5Es and A3Es, a clear preference of isoforms was seen for tandem acceptors and donors,
with four nucleotides and three to six nucleotides long exon extensions, respectively. A subset of inferred
A5E tandem exons was selected and experimentally validated. With the focus on A5Es, we investigated
their transcript coverage, sequence conservation and base-paring to U1 snRNA, proximal and distal splice
site classification, candidate motifs for cis-regulatory activity, and compared A5Es with A3Es, constitutive
and pseudo-exons, in H. sapiens and M. musculus. The results reveal a small but authentic enriched set of
tandem splice site preference, with specific distances between proximal and distal 5'ss (3'ss), which showed
a marked dichotomy between the levels of in- and out-of-frame splicing for A5Es and A3Es, respectively,
identified a number of candidate NMD targets, and allowed a rough estimation of a number of undetected
tandem donors based on splice site information.
Conclusion: This comparative study distinguishes tandem 5'ss and 3'ss, with three to six nucleotides long
extensions, as having unusually high proportions of AS, experimentally validates tandem donors in a panel
of different human tissues, highlights the dichotomy in the types of AS occurring at tandem splice sites, and
elucidates that human alternative exons spliced at overlapping 5'ss posses features of typical splice variants
that could well be beneficial for the cell.

Background
As the central intermediate between transcription and
translation of eukaryotic genes, the splicing of precursors
to messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) in the nucleus is frequently variable and produces multiple alternatively
spliced (AS) mRNA isoforms. The recognition of authentic pre-mRNA splice sites out of many possible pseudosites, the precise excision of introns, and the ligation of
exons to produce a correct message are catalyzed by a large
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex known as the spliceosome, which is composed of several small RNPs and perhaps over two-hundred proteins [1]. Splice sites mark the
boundaries between exon and intron: a 5'-splice site (5'ss
or donor) at the terminus of the exon/beginning of the
intron and a 3'ss (acceptor) at the terminus of the intron/
beginning of the exon. In addition, introns contain a
branch point signal, typically 15 to 45 nucleotides
upstream of the 3'ss. During later stages of spliceosome
assembly, there are mediated interactions between the 5'ss
and 3'ss, as well as splicing factors that recognize them,
and a basic distinction is made between the pairing of
splice sites across the exon ('exon-definition') or the
intron ('intron-definition') [2]. In humans, with compact
exons (average length of about 120 nucleotides) and comparatively much larger introns, exon-definition is thought
to be the prevalent mode of RNA splicing. When a pair of
closely spaced 3'ss-5'ss signals is recognized, the exon is
roughly defined by interactions between U2 snRNP:3'ss,
U1 snRNP:5'ss as well as additional splicing factors,
including U2AF65:branch site and U2AF35:poly-(Y) site
interactions.
AS events are categorized according to their splice site
choice and one can distinguish four canonical types:
exon-skipping (SE), in which mRNA isoforms differ by
the inclusion/exclusion of an exon; alternative 5'ss exon
(A5E) or alternative 3'ss exon (A3E), in which isoforms
differ in the usage of a 5'ss or 3'ss, respectively; and retention-type intron (RI), in which isoforms differ by the presence/absence of an unspliced intron [3]. These types are
not necessarily mutually exclusive and more complex
types of AS events can be constructed from such canonical
types. Alternative splicing produces similar, yet different
messages from one gene locus, thus enabling the diversification of protein sequences and function [4]. In addition, AS holds the possibility to control gene expression at
the post-transcriptional level via the non-sense mediated
mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. To prevent aberrantly or
deliberately incorrectly spliced transcripts that prematurely terminate translation, NMD ensures that only correctly spliced mRNAs that contain the full (or nearly so)
message are subsequently utilized for protein synthesis.
Therefore, NMD scans newly synthesized mRNA for the
presence of one or more premature-termination codons

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/202

(PTCs), and, if detected, can selectively degrade defective
mRNAs [5].
Fostered by the abundant accumulation of complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences and expressed sequence tags
(ESTs), genome-wide computational studies of AS have
investigated its scope in metazoans and estimated that a
fraction of up to two-thirds of human genes are predicted
to encode or regulate protein synthesis via such pathways
[6-9]. The outcome of these approaches have shown SEs
as the most frequent AS event in mRNA isoforms in
human and other mammalian organ systems and cell
types, followed by A3Es and A5Es, in turn followed by RIs
[10]. Interestingly, the sequence information of SEs and
their flanking regions, and the phylogenetic conservation
of such information, is sufficient to discriminate constitutive exons from SEs and can be used in computational
models to start predicting AS events that have not yet been
uncovered by cDNA and EST analyses [11,12].
Compared with the skipping of about one hundred exon
nucleotides or the retention of several hundred intron
nucleotides, A3Es and A5Es are thought to create more
subtle changes, by affecting the choice of the 3'ss or 5'ss,
respectively. Here, splice site usage gives rise to two types
of exon segments – the 'core' common to both splice
forms and the 'extension' that is present in only the longer
isoform. Both types of AS events have been shown to play
decisive roles during development (e.g., sex determination and differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster [13] or
developmental stage-related changes in the human CFTR
gene [14]), but also in human disease (e.g. 5'ss mutations
in the tau gene [15]). A3Es and A5Es are thought to be regulated by splicing-regulatory elements in exons and
nearby exon-flanking regions, as well as trans-acting
antagonistic splicing factors, which bind them and affect
the choice of splice sites in a concentration dependent
manner [16,17]. Interestingly, computational studies
showed that for both A3Es and A5Es the distribution of
extensions, f(E), is markedly skewed toward short-range
splice forms [18]. In particular, alternative splice sites that
are separated by the three-nucleotide long motif NAG/
NAG/(where '/' marks an inferred splice site) make up a
predominant proportion of A3E events in a mammals,
extending to invertebrates and plants [19,20]. Yet additional support from experimental studies is still very
sparse, and the similarities and dissimilarities of overlapping against non-overlapping ("competitive") as well as
constitutive splice sites remain to be delineated.
Here, we describe an effort to compare and contrast A5E,
A3E, and constitutive splice sites of human exons derived
from transcript sequences, of different human organ systems and cell types, which were aligned to the assembled
human genome sequence. To study known sequence fea-

tures involved in the recognition and distinction of splice
sites, we performed large-scale but stringent alignments of
cDNAs and ESTs to the human and mouse genome. Subsequently, we experimentally validated a subset of computationally inferred patterns of overlapping AS patterns,
by RT-PCR and direct sequencing, analyzed implicated
sequence and transcript features, and compared A5Es with
constitutive and pseudo-exons, as well as A3Es, in H. sapiens and M. musculus. We found differences for sequence
conservation and base-pairing to U1 snRNA, proximal/
distal splice site utilization, occurrence of candidate
motifs, and transcript coverage in subsets of overlapping
5'ss.
Our results distinguish a small but authentic enriched set
of A5Es (A3Es), with specific distances between proximal
and distal 5'ss (3'ss), which show a marked dichotomy
between the levels of in- and out-of-frame tandem splice
site usage, identify a number of candidate NMD targets,
and allow the rough estimation of a number of unobserved tandem AS events based on splice site information.
The implications for the processing of human alternative
transcripts are discussed.

Results
Biased extensions of alternative 5'ss and 3'ss exons
Exon-skipping is the most prevalent AS type produced by
the human spliceosome, as well as by all other mammals
investigated to date, when averaged across different organ
systems and cell types that can exhibit tissue-enriched
splice forms [21,22]. Internal alternative exons that
involve exclusively either the 3'ss (A3Es) or the 5'ss (A5Es)
are also abundantly produced, while the simultaneous
alteration of 3'ss and 5'ss (producing exons that overlap
but match neither splice site) are markedly less frequent.
For A5Es the most distal splice site defines the exon core,
while proximal sites (if more than one alternative choice
is possible) are exon extensions only included in selected
mRNAs.

Out of a collection of ~37,400 transcript-inferred human
alternative exons maintained in the HOLLYWOOD database [23], AS events of about 10,300 A5Es and 9,200 A3Es
were filtered for exon splice variants of solely one proximal/one distal 5'ss, while being constitutively spliced at
the opposite site, and resulted to 5,275 A5Es and 4,497
A3Es; either exon set had no other inferred AS type,
respectively. Stringent alignment criteria were imposed on
all transcripts: 1) ESTs were required to overlap at least
one co-aligned cDNA; 2) the first and last aligned segments of ESTs were required to be at least 30 nucleotides
in length with 90% sequence identity; 3) the entire EST
sequence alignment was required to extend over at least
90% of the length of the EST with at least 90% sequence
identity; and 4) realignments of ESTs with two other algo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/202

rithms were required to agree in three out of all three independent alignments (see below, as well as Methods). The
resulting dataset of identical computational inferences of
three methods contained 1,868 (~18%) A5Es and 3,301
(~36%) A3Es.
We subdivided alternative exons into their core and extension, where the latter is the sequence between the distal
and proximal splice sites. The extension (E) included
lengths up to about 250 nucleotides, with quickly decreasing transcript coverage/utilization as E increases. Larger
extensions existed, albeit with barely more than a few
transcripts (data not shown). For the sake of simplicity,
we defined the boundary between A5E (A3E) overlapping
and non-overlapping splices at E > 6 (E > 18) nucleotides
and displayed the distribution f(E) for E = 1,2,...,18 nucleotides in a window across the boundary region. Noticeably, the obtained distribution f(E) for both A5Es and A3Es
was highly biased for extensions with overlapping splice
sites. Figure 1 shows (in the upper-left panel) that for
extensions at the 5'ss the bias is caused predominantly by
a peak at E = 4 nucleotides. It further shows for A5Es that
short extensions exhibit a small but persistent pattern
periodically occurring at E = 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 nucleotides, all multiples of three, and thus preserving the reading-frame. These patterns of AS for short extensions were
in accord, both qualitatively and in good approximation
quantitatively, in an independent, comparative analysis
for the mouse Mus musculus (Figure 1, lower-left panel).
Overall, the median sizes of inferred alternative exons
showed that SEs and A5Es tend to be shorter than CEs and
A3Es, while overlapping and skewed to larger sizes [see
Additional File 1, Figure S1].
Unexpectedly, Figure 1 was indicative that different splicealignment algorithms gave rise to quite different outcomes, particularly when faced with alignments involving
short extensions. Among several standard algorithms,
SIM4 displayed a strong tendency toward E = 4 nucleotides. We took a conservative approach to substantiate
the identified A5E events, by realigning all corresponding
transcripts to the same genomic sequence with two other
algorithms, EXALIN and BLAT (the latter lacks an explicit
splice site model). The results showed that for E = 4 the
proportion of A5E events derived from SIM4 (~28%) was
markedly higher than alignments derived from EXALIN or
BLAT – yet the bias for extensions was consistently shown
at E = 4 nucleotides, though with a lower proportion of
~9% [see Additional File 1, Table S1]. Manual inspection
of selected SIM4 alignments showed apparent sequence
inconsistencies, when compared to the secondary alignments [see Additional File 1]. In all, 1,868 of 5,275 A5Es
were taken for further analysis, where ~9% (171/1,868)
accounted for E = 4 nucleotides extensions.

Occurrence of extensions (E = 1,2,...,18 nucleotides) for A5Es (parts A, C) and A3Es (B, D), with human and
mouse exons in the top and bottom panels, respectively. Extensions were inferred from three different alignment algorithms (colored as blue, SIM4; red, BLAT; and green, EXALIN) of cDNAs/ESTs to genomic DNA. The distribution f(E) for A5Es
was markedly biased for extensions (E) with overlapping splice sites, with a peak at E = 4 nucleotides. Exon extensions exhibited relatively smaller but persistent periodic peaks at E = 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 nucleotides. f(E) for A3Es also displayed a bias for
overlapping splice sites, with a peak at E = 3 nucleotides and smaller peaks at 4–6 nucleotides. The program SIM4 predicted significantly more extensions at E = 4 nucleotides as compared to BLAT and EXALIN predictions of the same initial set of
cDNAs/ESTs, which was indicative of spurious alignments. A comparative analysis of alternative exons in M. musculus corroborated the above patterns.

In order to compare these findings with A3E events, we
obtained the distribution of short extensions and identified a similar, albeit distinctively different pattern (upperright panel). Figure 1 shows that f(E) exhibits a clear peak
at E = 3 nucleotides, with successively smaller peaks at E =
4, 5, and 6 nucleotides. Again, these AS patterns were corroborated in a comparative analysis for M. musculus (Figure 1, lower-right panel). The extension preference of
alternative 5'ss and 3'ss exons is in accord with previous
studies, where in particular E = 3 nucleotides for A3Es had
been examined and found to obey the pattern NAG/NAG/
[20,24,25].

GTAGTT at the proximal 5'ss that extends E8 (non-consensus nucleotides are underlined; exon extension
bolded). The distal and proximal 5'ss gave rise to three
and 17 mRNAs, respectively, which aligned to the primary
transcript structure of RAD9A. In addition to the tandem
donor pattern, Figure 2 shows the splice site strength,
quantified by the MAXENT score (see Methods), and the
conservation profile across exons and intron, quantified
by the PHASTCON score [28] computed across several
genomes (from P. troglodytes to T. rubripes). Local regions
of high levels of sequence conservation for exons compared with the intron are apparent.

Tandem donors and acceptors
Patterns of A5Es and A3E extensions with overlapping
splice sites are interesting in their own context, because
they are 1) occurring most abundantly; 2) possibly differently regulated than non-overlapping, i.e. competitive,
splice sites of alternative 5'ss and 3'ss exons [26,27]; and
3) predictive of different downstream effects of AS, resulting into preferred different modes of alternative splicing
at the 5'ss (out-of-frame splicing) and the 3'ss (in-frame
splicing). For overlapping 5'ss and 3'ss are mainly characterized by extensions of four and three nucleotides,
respectively, hereafter we denote by "A5E∆4" tandem
donors with E = 4 and similarly by "A3E∆3" tandem
acceptors with E = 3 nucleotides. We study for tandem
donors known sequence features involved in the recognition of the 5'ss, and compare them to the 3'ss of alternative and constitutive exons, including exons with pseudo
donors.

B. A tandem donor was detected for E9 (TTG/GTAG/GT
and TAG/GTAAGT) of the ACAD9 gene (ENSG00000177
646), which encodes a member of the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene family and plays a role in lipid catabolism.
The distal and proximal 5'ss gave rise to 13 and eight
mRNAs, respectively. Figure 2 shows for E9 consistently
elevated levels of sequence conservation.

Generally, the basic recognition and binding to 5'ss incorporates intronic (involving positions from 1 to 6) and
exonic nucleotides (positions from -3 to -1). The consensus motif for 5'ss of mammalian genes is known as CAG/
GTRAGT (at positions P-3P-2P-1/P1P2-P6), where the
purine (R) is either an adenine (A) or a guanine (G) base.
This nine nucleotide-long motif is highly degenerated
and, in fact, in the present data set of human exons only
proportions of ~0.9% (966/113,386) and ~1.3% (1,431/
113,386) of inferred constitutive exons exhibited exact
matches to the motifs CAG/GTAAGT or CAG/GTGAGT,
respectively. Figure 2 illustrates splice sites and utilization
of tandem donors for three selected human genes [see
Additional file 2 for a complete list of inferred tandem
donors]:
A. The gene RAD9A (Ensembl gene-identifier ENSG00000
172613) is a homolog conserved from yeast to human,
which encodes a cell cycle-check point control protein
that is required for cell-cycle arrest and DNA damage
repair. The primary transcript sequence of RAD9A exhibited two alternative, overlapping 5'ss at exon E8, identified as CAG/GCAG/GT at the distal 5'ss and CAG/

C. The arginine/serine-rich splicing factor 16 (ENSG0000
0104859) showed a tandem donor at E15 (AAA/GTCA/
GT and TCA/GTAAGA). Distal and proximal 5'ss choice
gave rise to nine and six mRNAs of SFRS16, respectively.
Figure 2 shows that the level of sequence conservation of
E15 steadily rises toward the 3'-terminus and extends well
across the exon-intron junction to I16, before it rapidly
decays, which was indicative of conservation due to splicing-regulatory function [29].
Experimental validation of tandem donors
Having obtained sufficient evidence from stringent transcript alignments, we pursued to validate the functional
utilization of tandem splice sites from independent lines
of evidence. To this end, we first searched publicly available literature (see Availability and requirements section
for Pubmed URL) for AS events involving short 5'ss extensions. Yet we found only a very limited number of
reported cases of splice variants with short extensions that
could be traced back to tandem acceptors. The human
Clasp gene (known synonyms are SFRS16, or SWAP2 for
the D. melanogaster homolog), for instance, encodes the
Clk4-associating arginine/serine-rich (SR)-related protein
that binds to the family of CDC2-like kinases [30,31]. The
5'ss of E15 of the Clasp/SFSR16 is an alternative tandem
donor, which gives rise to the splice forms ClaspS (with
the extension GTCA) and ClaspL (without). Both isoforms
differ by 246 nucleotides, where ClaspS carries a PTC due
to out-of-frame splicing and thereby omits a third RSdomain encoded by Clasp/SFSR16. Both isoforms were tissue-enriched in the mice brain and testis, and displayed
different intra-nuclear locations, possibly controlled by
the third RS-domain [30]. Another AS event involving tandem splice sites has been detected in the human growth

hormone (GH) gene cluster, whose expression is developmentally controlled. The gene GH-V differentially
expressed three isoforms in the placenta and testis, one of
which is due to a tandem donor splice site (/GTGG/GT) of
exon E4; the tandem site was not sequence-conserved in
the remaining four family members (GGGG/GT). The use
of the distal out-of-frame splice site caused a readingframe shift of E5 downstream, which, in turn, overread
the original termination codon and utilized a new
("delayed") termination codon further downstream.
Overall, the original splice variant and GH-V/∆4 shared
124/219 and differed by 95/219 amino acids.
Clearly, the detection of alternative tandem splice site
exons is hampered due to the high similarity of isoforms
and often only detectable by direct sequencing and protein sequence analysis. Consequently, an experimental
assay was used to explore the splicing patterns of computationally identified alternative tandem donors directly.
Table 1 list the names of a set of 14 genes with tandem
acceptors (~8% of total), which were manually selected
from known genes exhibiting a varying degree of transcript coverage (ranging from one to 35 transcripts for tan-

dem splice site usage) and tested in a battery of human
organ systems and cell types by RT-PCR primers targeted
to the flanking exons; panels of nine normal tissue samples (from the brain, colon, heart, kidney, small intestine,
spleen, thymus, ovary, and leukocytes) were assayed. The
products of these 45 RT-PCRs were used to verify the identity of these PCR products by sequencing (see Figure 2, as
well as Methods). For instance, Figure 3 shows for E15 of
SFRS16 schematically the gene structure, proximal and
distal sites of the tandem donor, and the sequence electropherogram interrogated in samples derived from the
human spleen and blood. Upstream of the E15 tandem
donor, both transcript sequences identically overlap and
thus cannot be distinguished in the electropherogram;
downstream, two nucleotide signals appear above the
base line, indicating the presence of two isoforms.
Table 1 lists the outcome for all 14 genes. In all, 50 % (7
of 14 total) of selected A5E∆4 splicing exons showed PCRproducts displaying E = 4 nucleotides for the sets of interrogated alternative exons, and the experimentally
observed splice ratio between minor and major form was
in agreement with the ratio suggested by EST data. Six of

Experimental validation of a tandem donor activated in E15 of the SFRS16 gene using RT-PCR and direct sequencing
Figure 3
Experimental validation of a tandem donor activated in E15 of the SFRS16 gene using RT-PCR and direct
sequencing. The top shows the gene structure of SFRS16; in the middle and bottom, E14-16 are schematically extracted and
the 3'-end core and full extension sequence of E15 for proximal (TCA/gtaaga) and distal (AAA/gtcagt) splicing are shown.
Prior to reaching the 5'ss of E15, both mRNA isoforms cannot be distinguished and consequently the electropherogram displays, for each position, one nucleotide signal peak above the base line. After the tandem donor site, two nucleotide signals
above the base line become visible, indicating the presence of two isoforms.

seven A5E∆4 splicing exons could be mapped to proteincoding gene sequences and all six CDS affecting alternative exons created a PTC. For human tissues samples were
tried to match EST-associated cDNA libraries, using a
larger battery of different organ systems and cell types
might validate additional A5E∆4 splicing exons and,
therefore, conducted experiments were rather delivering a
lower boundary of the presence of AS events involving
tandem donors.
Two distinct levels of A5E proximal and distal splicing
Studies of the inclusion and exclusion of skipped exons of
the human and mouse genomes have shown that SEs can
be broadly subdivided into two types: SEs that are
included in the majority of transcripts (termed 'majorform'), and those that are predominantly excluded
('minor-form'). Interestingly, such SEs posses different
splicing and phylogenetic properties [32]. Here, we examined whether this property is more generally related to
alternative exons, by analyzing the transcript coverage of
1,816 A5Es with one proximal/one distal 5'ss (no other

inferred types of AS). Figure 4A shows a scatter plot of the
distal against proximal 5'ss transcript coverage for both
tandem and competitive donors; the individual transcript
coverage of the distal (proximal) splice site is placed
above (on the right-hand side). The scatter plot shows that
the number of aligned transcripts ranges from a single
transcripts up to more than one hundred, with the average
centering on ~13, and is biased toward lower coverage
(median value of 2). We defined the ratio of proximal
over distal 5'ss usage (R) and computed R for human, as
well as mouse, A5Es. The inset of Figure 4A shows that the
histogram of the log(R) displays a bimodal distribution,
which is indicative of the presence of two types (or subpopulations) of alternative 5'ss exons – one, which is
characterized by the utilization of the proximal over the
distal 5'ss (type-I), and another by the utilization of the
distal over the proximal 5'ss (type-II). This is reminiscent
of the "major/minor form" definition of SEs, albeit here it
applies to both A5E proximal and distal splice sites. We
used the threshold of Rc = 2 to group all A5Es into type-I
and II, or a remaining type, based on the behavior of R

Figure 4
Scatter plot of the transcript coverage of competitive and tandem donors (A) and acceptors (B)
Scatter plot of the transcript coverage of competitive and tandem donors (A) and acceptors (B). Vertical and
horizontal axes refer to the coverage of distal and proximal splice sites; solid and dotted lines mark the transcript means;
A5E∆4 and A3E∆3 splicing exons are bolded, green and blue mark the ∆P and ∆D (major) splicing exons, respectively. The
inset shows the histogram of the log-ratio (R) of the coverage of the distal over the proximal 5'ss (3'ss); curves marked in black
show the smoothed distribution (splines, R package). In A) the coverage scatters mainly along the vertical or horizontal axis,
which is indicative of preferentially including or excluding the exon extension from the core sequence. The coverage pattern
was used to partition all A5Es into two main types, I and II, and a remaining type. The inset shows for the histogram of R a
bimodal shape, which is indicative of two subpopulations of A5Es with predominant proximal or distal splice site usage. In B)
the overlap between distal and proximal tandem acceptor coverage is comparatively broader, and consequently the histogram
of R exhibits a unimodal shape consistent with a single population of A3Es.

(see also Methods). Having two subpopulations of tandem donors, we denote by "P∆4" ("p∆4") the major
(minor) form proximal donor of type-I, and by "D∆4"
("d∆4") the major (minor) form distal donor of type-II.
Similarly, competitive proximal and distal 5'ss splice sites
are denoted as "P∆" ("p∆") for type-I and as "D∆" ("d∆")
for type-II, respectively (cf. Table 2).
Figure 4B shows the scatter plot of the distal against proximal 3'ss transcript coverage. Here, the points are comparatively larger scattered than in Figure 4A and display an
"arrow head" like structure. Using the same threshold as
above, we find no clear distinction between splice sites for
A3Es. Rather, the data are consistent with a single population of A3Es, and the inset shows the histogram of R as an
approximately unimodal shape with values of R in a similar range as observed for A5Es.

In all, tandem and competitive A5Es comprise a set of
1,641 out of 1,868 (~88 %), remaining ~12% that either
exceeded the threshold definition or were covered by a
single transcript. The density of P∆ and D∆ splicing exons
was ~59% (type-I) and ~41% (type-II), which was in
some contrast to P∆4 and D∆4 of type-I with ~26% (44/
171) and type-II with ~69% (118/171) exons, respectively
(P < 0.0001; Fisher's exact test). Scatter plots, populations,
and histograms were corroborated in a comparative analysis of the transcript coverage for A5Es in M. musculus
(data not shown).
Splice sites of A5Es score differently between type-I and
type-II
We computed the 5'ss score distribution to study the relationship between different types of transcript coverage
and sequence-complementarity of base pairing to U1
snRNA. To this end, we applied a maximum-entropy
(MAXENT), or Markov-random field, based model, which

has been shown to capture additional statistical significant dependencies of splicing signals than standard position-weight matrix representations [33,34], to score the
5'ss of all A5Es (see Methods). Figure 5A shows for all P∆
and P∆4 splicing exons of type-I the score distribution,
f(S), of the distal against proximal 5'ss. The score is large
(S > 0) when the splice site is 'close' to the consensus
sequence, and small (S < 0) when the splice site shows
marked deviations from the consensus. For type-I, we
found that the scores of most P∆ and P∆4 splicing exons
were positive, ranged up to S = 12 (units of bit), and clustered narrowly around a mean value of SP∆ ≈ SP∆4 = 7.5
(marked by horizontal lines in Figure 5A). In contrast,
scores of the corresponding d∆ and d∆4 (the minorforms) fluctuated more broadly, and mean values were
between ∆SP∆4 ≈ 4.5 and ∆SP∆ ≈ 8 weaker than the corresponding major-form splice site. Interestingly, this trend
was reversed for exons of type-II (D∆, D∆4), where for SD∆
and SD∆4 the score clustered between 7 to 8, yet for minorforms was again broadly distributed and clustered around
Sp∆ ≈ 4.6 and Sp∆4 ≈ -3.9, respectively. The different pattern
of narrow/broad scattering of A5E∆4 splice site strengths
in dependence of their type was corroborated in a comparative analysis of f(S) in M. musculus [see Additional File
1, Figure S2].
Observed patterns (/GTNN/GT) of proximal (P∆4) and
distal (D∆4) tandem splice sites occurred with markedly
different proportions (see Table 3). To what extent were
the observed P∆4 and D∆4 splicing exons different from
constitutive splicing exons (CEs) with pseudo donors hav-

ing a "genomic predisposition" for tandem splicing (but
were not observed)? We addressed this question by looking for constitutive 5'ss (/GT) that were flanked by
another GT dinucleotide at a distance of four nucleotides
either upstream (denoted as "dΨ4") or downstream of the
authentic 5'ss ("pΨ4"). We searched a set of ~63,000 CEs
(out of ~113,400) that exhibited proximal and/or distal
pseudo tandem donors. Assuming position-independent
nucleotide concentrations, the expected proportions
would be ~10% (dΨ4) and ~48% (pΨ4), where the latter
reflects the GT motif at positions P5 and P6 of the 5'ss consensus. We found that dΨ4 was lower than its expected
occurrence and was present only in ~4% of CEs (P <
0.001; z-test), whereas pΨ4 was similar, albeit still significantly different, to the expected occurrence and present in
~47% of CEs (P < 0.001; z-test); a substantial proportion
of ~5% (5,211) was comprised by GYNN/GYNNGY, but
was excluded from further analysis to avoid any ambiguity. The score distribution f(S) for the above sets showed
related differences. The mean scores of P∆4 and constitutive 5'ss (downstream of dΨ4), SP∆4 = 7.5 and S5'ss = 7.9,
were about equally large (P < 0.13, Mann-Whitney test),
yet SdΨ4 = -3.6 was significantly lower as compared with
Sd∆4 = 2.8 (P < 2.2e-16). Similarly, the mean scores of D∆4
and constitutive 5'ss (upstream of pΨ4), SD∆4 = 7.9 and
S5'ss = 8.7, were found to be similar, but still significantly
different (P < 0.003), whereas SpΨ4 = -10.2 was significantly lower than Sp∆4 = -3.9 (P < 1.9e-13). In words,
minor splice variants of tandem donors (p∆4, d∆4) scored
larger than pseudo variants (pΨ4, dΨ4), while lower than
5'ss of constitutive splicing exons, and were consequently

The coverage is shown for major-form distal (D∆4) and proximal (P∆4) tandem donors. Genes with inferred D∆4 splicing exons outnumber genes
with P∆4 splicing exons about 2.5-fold, which is reflected in their overall cDNA (about three-fold) and EST (about ten-fold) coverage. In addition to/
GT, the/GY motif is shown, if the presence/GC was statistically significant.

sufficiently different from pseudo splice sites, despite the
same genomic pattern.
Discriminating between major and minor A5E∆4 versus
constitutive splicing exons
We used the difference between the 5'ss score distribution
f(S) of major and minor A5E∆4 splicing exons of tandem
donors to test, based on the behavior of f(S) alone, how
accurate P∆4 can be distinguished from d∆4, and D∆4
from p∆4 splicing exons. To this end, for type-I we computed the cumulative distribution F(S(n)), with n =
1,2,...N, for the set {SP∆4}, by 1) rank-ordering all scores
S(n) from the smallest to the largest score; 2) calculating sN
= Σm = 1..NS(m); and 3) normalizing F(S(n)) = sn/sN. By construction, F(S(n)) is a monotonically increasing function
of S and takes on its largest value at F(S(N)) = 1. Similarly,
we computed G(S) = 1 - F(S) for the set {Sd∆4}, a monotonically decreasing function of S that takes on its largest
value at G(S(1)) = 1. The intersection of F(S*) and G(S*)
yields for each set the accuracy at which {SP∆4} and {Sd∆4}
can be distinguished, with smallest probability of error on
the classification of both sets [35,36].

Figure 5C shows for d∆4/P∆4 splicing exons the cumulative distributions F(S) and G(S) in the score range
between -20 and 15, together with F(S) and G(S) for constitutive dΨ4/5'ss splicing exons for comparison. On the
one hand, we find for P∆4 and constitutive 5'ss that F(S)
collapses to approximately one curve for S > 0, and that

constitutive 5'ss exhibit a long range of negative scores,
which was not seen for tandem donors. G(S) for d∆4
decays similarly to dΨ4, albeit overall shifted by about ten
units toward larger scores, and hence leads to a greater
overlap between the F(SP∆4) and G(Sd∆4) as compared
with F(S5'ss) and G(SdΨ4) for constitutive splicing exons.
Consequently, the accuracy A(S* = 3.5) > 95% at which
one can distinguish constitutive 5'ss from dΨ4 is larger
than A(7.3) = 78% for d∆4/P∆4. On the other hand, in
Figure 5D we find for D∆4/p∆4 and constitutive 5'ss/pΨ4
similar relationships for F(S) and G(S), with G(Sp∆4) overall shifted by about five units toward G(SpΨ4). Both distributions are wider gapped than observed in Figure 5C, and
thus the accuracy reached A(6) = 92% for alternative and
A(4.6) = 99% for constitutive splice sites, respectively.
Note that distinguishing the sets above by means of a 5'ss
score difference and the log-likelihood difference (LLD),
presented in [24], are closely related. This can most easily
be seen, by considering splice site scores derived from a
standard position specific weight-matrix (PSWM) model
with independent nucleotide frequencies: provided the
PSWM background model remains unchanged, the slice
site score difference is equal to the LLD. For the MAXENT
splice site model incorporates higher-order statistical
dependencies between nucleotides, this exact relationship
is replaced by correlated values.

For this data, the subsets of pΨ4 and dΨ4 splice sites hold
an upper limit on the overall number of human tandem
donors, where the pseudo splice site remained unobserved or unutilized. Using the threshold scores suggested
from discriminating P∆4 against d∆4 (S* = 7.3), as well as
D∆4 against p∆4 (S* = 6.0), one finds that 23 (~0.5%) of
the dΨ4 set and 530 (~1.0%) exons of the pΨ4 set exceed
these thresholds as putatively unobserved tandem donors.
Nucleotide conservation around major and minor A5E∆4
splice sites
Given existing differences between tandem donors and
constitutive splicing exons with either dΨ4 or pΨ4 splice
sites, we compared and contrasted the nucleotide conservation around splice sites (cf. Table 4). To this end, we
computed for each splice site position (Pi) the nucleotide
frequencies of proximal and distal tandem donors in typeI and type-II, and represented their information score I by
individual sequence logos [37] (see Methods). I is close to
zero in the absence of nucleotide conservation with
respect to the background, and increases with increasing
conservation up to around two bit per sequence position.

Figure 6 shows in part A) pictograms for constitutive 5'ss
and 3'ss, proximal (P∆4) and distal (D∆4) tandem
donors, as well as A3E∆3 splicing exons; in B) the information score difference (∆I) between P∆4 and D∆4 tandem donors to constitutive 5'ss, respectively; and in C) a
species comparison of splice site positions of human
A5E∆4 splicing exons that were sequence conserved at
positions P-4P-3 or P3P4 in exon of the orthologous mouse
gene. We compared base frequencies of d∆4/P∆4 to constitutive 5'ss/pseudo dΨ4 splice sites, as well as D∆4/p∆4
to 5'ss/pΨ4 splice sites (data not shown), in order to identify differences in the base composition between these
classes.
On the one hand, clear statistical differences were found
for d∆4/P∆4 splicing exons with, e.g., significantly lower

levels of C but higher levels of T at P-3 (P < 10-4, χ2-test)
compared to dΨ4/5'ss splicing exons. Together with P-2
and P-1, which show a significant enrichment of G and A
(P < 10-4, χ2-test) of d∆4/P∆4 over 5'ss/dΨ4 splicing
exons, respectively, P-2 possibly mismatches to U1snRNA
upon binding to P∆4, while P-3 and P-1 possibly support
splicing upon binding to d∆4 due to sequence-complementarity of base pairing with U1 snRNA. Other elevated
levels of d∆4/P∆4 splicing exons were found for T at P-12
(P < 10-4), A at P-6 (P < 0.05), G at both P-5 and P5 (P <
0.05), and C or T at P6 (P < 10-4, χ2-tests). On the other
hand, D∆4/p∆4 splicing exons showed a significant
decrease (increase) of A (T) (P < 0.02) worsening the
match with U1 snRNA for both D∆4 and p∆4, while an
increase of A at P8 (P < 0.01) and T at P10 (P < 0.02, χ2tests) improved the U1 snRNA sequence-complementarity of p∆4 over pΨ4. In all, several splice site positions
were differently depleted or elevated, often with the possibility to enhance the sequence-complementarity to U1
snRNA [38-41]. In particular, G at position P-1 has been
attributed as crucial for U1 but not U5 snRNA base pairing, creating stacking effects to G at P1 [42], and the association of P-1 and P+5 observed for A5E∆4 major-forms, as
well as A5Es and CEs but also for d∆4 splicing exons
(type-I), was pointed out in Carmel et al. [42]. Additionally, P-7 and P-6 of d∆4/P∆4 splicing exons showed elevated levels of A over dΨ4/5'ss and could promote U5
snRNA-dependent base pairing via uridines in the U5
invariant loop, suggested to compensate for weaker U1
snRNA affinity [42] (neither dΨ4/5'ss nor p∆4 splicing
exons showed elevated levels).
The different levels were in accord with the average information score that takes into account the levels of all nucleotides, at a given position, against a background level.
Figure 6B shows the difference ∆I between tandem and
constitutive 5'ss, which is positive (negative) for higher
(lower) scores of tandem against constitutive 5'ss. We
found that d∆4/P∆4 splicing exons carried overall more

Splice site signals and sequence conservation around splice sites
Splice site signals and sequence conservation around splice sites. A) Pictograms of 5'ss and 3'ss of constitutive, P∆4 and D∆4,
and A3E∆3 splicing exons. The height of a nucleotide represents the frequency of occurrence at a given position, represented
in the range of 14 nucleotides around the splice junctions. Above the constitutive 5'ss, the 3'-end of the U1 snRNA is indicated.
B) Information score difference (∆I) between P∆4 and D∆4, respectively, and constitutive splicing exons, as well as A3E∆3 and
constitutive splicing exons. For each position, ∆I > 0 (∆I < 0), indicates more (lack of) information of an alternative compared
to a constitutive splice site. C) Sequence conservation of human P∆4 and D∆4 splice sites and splice sites of exons of orthologous mouse genes, 'anchored' at major splice sites and with > 80% exon sequence identity.

information at P-12, P-6-P-2, and P-3, but as well at P-5,
whereas we found that D∆4/p∆4 carried less information
at P-2 and P-1, but more at P5 and P6. Interestingly, Figure
6B shows no marked fluctuations of ∆I between tandem
and constitutive 3'ss. Figure 6C supports the above positional constraints detected for type-I and type-II, by showing the conservation around major (P∆4, D∆4) splice sites
between human A5E∆4 splicing exons and mouse exons
of orthologous genes, 'anchored' at/GT or/GC splice sites,
respectively (the major site, but not the minor site, is conserved by construction). D∆4/p∆4 splicing exons only
conserved positions P5 and P6, whereas d∆4/P∆4 showed
two recognizable overlapping 5'ss (positions P-4-P-2 and
P1-P6) and U1 snRNA sequence-complement base pairing
with extension nucleotides [42].
Exon-flanking sequences show levels of conservation in
type-I, but lack of it in type-II tandem donors
Exon and flanking sequences of alternative conserved
exons, or ACEs, of orthologous human and mouse genes
exhibit significant levels of sequence conservation. This
has most clearly been demonstrated for ACEs that
undergo exon-skipping [10-12], and has also been shown
for comparatively smaller sets (and thus larger statistical
fluctuations) of A5Es and A3Es, including A3E∆3 tandem
acceptors [10,19]. Such conservation could imply the utilization of splicing regulatory signals that are common to
orthologous sets of genes.

We examined whether A5Es and their flanking regions
exhibited comparatively higher sequence conservation
when compared with constitutive exons. To this end, we
mapped the set of tandem and competitive A5E exons to
exons of orthologous mouse genes. Imposing a level of at
least 80% sequence identity and canonical splice sites, we
obtained matches for about 75% of P∆4 and 90% of D∆4
splice variants. For each species, we extracted the
sequences of exons and up to 200 nucleotides of their
flanking sequences downstream of the donor splice sites,
and assessed the conservation levels for exon and intron
regions (cf. Table 4 and Methods). We mapped as control
sets 536/653 A3E∆3 splicing exons (1); a randomly
selected subset of CEs with 4,145/4,910 and 4,082/4,910
up- (dΨ4) and downstream (pΨ4) pseudo splice sites,
respectively (2); and a randomly selected subset of 2,705/
4,910 SEs (3). Note that exons of orthologous mouse
genes can be constitutive or alternative and, if so, of the
same or a different AS type.
Figure 7A shows for P∆4 test and control sets the exon
conservation as a combined score, and the intron conservation in the range between one and 100 nucleotides.
Similarly, Figure 7B shows for D∆4 test and control sets
the exon and intron conservation. Test sets have smaller
overall sizes than the controls, and therefore possess

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/202

larger statistical fluctuations. We observe for both exons
and introns the highest level of conservation for the control set of human SEs, which exhibit a clear enrichment
over tandem donor A5Es and the remaining controls, in
accord with previous analyses [11,12,43]. On the one
hand, we found for intron flanking regions of P∆4 splicing exons a markedly higher level of conservation as compared with CEs, ranging up to 80 nucleotides (Figure 7A),
while we found for intron flanking regions of D∆4 splicing exons a conservation level similar to CEs (Figure 7B).
On the other hand, Figure 7A and 7B show no marked differences of exon conservation levels between sequences of
A5E∆4 and the control sets (except SEs), and for all investigated exon types the average conservation level was
found between 80% and 85%. Previous analyses used
datasets enriched by AS events that were specifically conserved between exons of orthologous human and mouse
genes (also being smaller sized [10]), and a follow-up
study incorporating such data did not distinguish
between P∆4 and D∆4 splicing exons [44].
Occurrence of splicing signals in exon-flanking sequences
The above analyses suggested a higher downstream intron

conservation of P∆4 as compared to D∆4 and constitutive
splicing exons, in conjunction with a different splice site
score between the major and minor splice variants. We
examined whether the occurrence of splicing-regulatory
elements could, to some extent, possibly explain the
observed differences (see Methods). To this end, we
searched for over-representations of known oligonucleotides (six to seven-mers) implicated in splicing regulation, which were enriched in A5E∆4 over constitutive
exon-flanking regions from one to 100 nucleotides. We
made use of four sets of previously computationally and/
or experimentally identified nucleic sequence elements:
FAS2-ESS (  ) and PESS elements (  ), IREs (  ), as well
as ESE elements (  ).
Figure 7C compares for P∆4 splicing exons the frequency
of occurrences of all four sets of sequence elements,
binned to non-overlapping 20 nucleotide windows and
separated for type-I and -II, against the control. Similarly,
Figure 7D shows for D∆4 splicing exons the frequency of
occurrences of all four sets of sequence elements. For
introns, we found for both P∆4 and D∆4 splicing exons a
generally higher frequency of sequence elements from sets
 and  , particularly from the start of the splice junction to about 40 nucleotides downstream, while elements
of set  are differentially enriched in P∆4 and suppressed
in D∆4 splicing exons. Sequence elements in exons (set
 ) were indicative of a general enrichment of ESEs in

P∆4 splicing exons, particularly from about 40 nucleotides upstream to the splice junction, which was not
found for D∆4 splicing exons (with a peak at about 60
nucleotides upstream the splice junction).
Exon E15 of the gene SFRS16, e.g., showed two purinerich motifs, GGGGGGC and GGTGGG, located at 65 and
87 nucleotides downstream of the 5'ss (contained in sets
 and  ), respectively. Additional hexamers were
located between the positions 117 and 123 nucleotides
(GGGAGG), while other sequence elements (set  )
occurred often closer to the E15 proximal donor of
SFRS16, between five and 30 nucleotides. Poly(G)-rich
sequence elements are binding sites for the family of
hnRNP splicing regulators [45] and have been implicated
in the control of 5'ss choice [46-48]. Interestingly, a phylogenetically conserved poly(G)-rich sequence element
has previously been reported as involved in the selection
of tandem/GTNNNN/GA splice sites in the splicing of the
human FGFR gene [49].
A5E∆4 splicing exons often produce NMD target
substrates
Inferred AS events of A5E∆4 and A3E∆3 splicing exons
showed a "splicing dichotomy" between the 5'ss and 3'ss
– while AS events of the latter result in subtle but perhaps
biologically significant in-frame variation of a single
amino-acid, tandem donors result in out-of-frame shifts
downstream of the tandem donor and could thus lead to
a truncated protein with different function or unproductive splicing, depending on the (coding) exon position.
Indeed, regulated unproductive splicing and translation
(RUST) has been proposed to be a mechanistic link
between AS and the NMD quality control pathway
[50,51]. What is the proportion of A5E∆4 splicing exons
in the present data that might be subjected to NMD? To
address this, we 1) 'standardized' the initially obtained
A5E annotation by matching it with REFSEQ-annotated
sequences; 2) identified REFSEQ sequences with complete
exon-intron structures and annotated start-stop codons of
protein coding sequence (CDS) regions; and 3) imposed
proximal and distal splice sites, and recalculated the
altered reading-frame and stop codon position downstream of A5E∆4 splicing exons, while neglecting possible
compensating AS events at this step [see Additional File 1,
Figure S3].

The detection of in-frame stop codons is schematically
sketched in Figure 8. In all, 153/171 (~90%) inferred
A5E∆4 splicing exons were confirmed by at least one REFSEQ sequence at the distal (72%), proximal (27%) or
either (1%) donor site, respectively. A large majority of
A5E∆4 splicing exons (~94%) was located in CDS regions,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/202

with only marginal proportions in the 5'-untranslated
region (5'-UTR) or 3'-UTR. During splicing, choice of the
out-of-frame tandem donor will create an mRNA isoform
with an in-frame stop codon that introduces a premature
termination codon (PTC) and shortens the C-terminus in
~97% of all considered cases. Tandem splicing of exon E8
of the human RAD9 gene at E8d∆4, e.g., truncates the
RAD9 domain by 52 amino acids (15% of total length).
While possibly still maintaining the domain functionality, the loss of four C-terminal phosphoserines could prevent the interaction with the (9-1-1) cell-cycle checkpoint
response complex [52]. In contexts of type-I and type-II,
we found more than twice (~69 %) NMD candidates produced by D∆4 splicing exons (where splicing of p∆4 produced PTCs), as compared with ~26 % P∆4 splicing exons
(where splicing of d∆4 produced PTCs). The reminder of
about 5 % of NMD candidates did not stem from type-I or
type-II.
In all, about three-quarters (78%) of PTCs were located
more than 50 nucleotides upstream of the last exon-exon
junction, and thus predicted to produce a marked proportion of NMD substrates [5]. Interestingly, a small number
of A5E∆4 splicing exons (~3%) was going to avoid the
truncation of the transcript due to the out-of-frame shift
but instead extended it. In close relation to premature termination codons (PTCs), we term these "delayed" termination codons (DTCs), where all detected DTCs were
produced from utilization of the minor donor (p∆4). For
instance, tandem splicing at the p∆4 donor of exon E13 of
the HNRPU gene (ENSG00000153187), which encodes
the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) U,
extended the CDS region by 27 amino acids. Due to the
frame shift and the occurrence of synonymous and nonsynonymous codons, the amino-acid sequence is changed
such that the complexity at the protein level (determined
by the tool SMART [53]) increases at the C-terminal end.

Discussion
Alternative splicing is essential for protein diversification
and has recently been suggested as mechanistically linked
to post-transcriptional gene regulation via nonsense
mediated mRNA decay (NMD) [54]. The consequences
for protein sequence and function alteration, as well as
triggering of the NMD pathway, have been demonstrated
for exon-skipping events in several studies [55-57]. While
there is further evidence for the functioning and regulation of the remaining types of alternative exons [44], our
understanding of their sequence evolution, produced AS
patterns, regulation, and functioning still remains relatively vague [58]. In this paper, we analyzed differences
and similarities between sets of A5Es, A3Es, and CEs, and
focused on a particular type of a pair of alternative donors
that are tandemly arrayed and overlapping.

REFSEQ transcript structure, whereas the red-colored version indicates the altered stop codon due to tandem donor splicing.
A5E∆4 splicing exons embedded within CDS regions are broken down into two categories, depending on the creation of a
premature (PTC) or delayed termination codon (DTC). PTCs can signal mRNAs as substrates for non-sense mediated decay.

Alternative 5'ss exons (A5Es) were computationally
inferred from a collection of stringently aligned cDNA and
EST sequences to the human genome, and their sequence
features were compared to known features involved in
RNA splicing. Spliced-alignments were obtained from the
three independent algorithms (SIM4, BLAT, and EXALIN).
EXALIN detected the smallest number of subtle AS patterns, which are characteristic of tandem donors (involving just a few nucleotides long extensions), most of which
were also identified by SIM4 and BLAT. For there is no
"true" method of inferring AS events, all analyses were
based on the subset defined by the intersection of the predictions of all three algorithms. While one cannot rule out

misalignments still arising from three methods in some
instances, rigor was taken to produce a confidenceenriched set. In addition, we pursued other independent
lines of evidence and experimentally validated a subset of
14 human genes with tandem donors across different tissues. The outcome confirmed about 50% A5E∆4 splicing
exons and provided evidence that a substantial fraction of
tandem donors detectable in public sequence repositories
are not explained by sequence alignment ambiguities. We
found that almost one tenth of all human A5Es with
exactly one shorter and one longer splice variant, and no
other inferred splice type (SE, A3E, or RI), were A5E∆4
splicing exons. Interestingly, Figure 1 also shows a small

but persistent pattern of higher frequencies at E = 6, 9, 12,
15 and 18 nucleotides, which is indicative that competitive splice sites had biased extensions that preserve the
reading-frame.
The central outcome of our study points to a splicing
dichotomy between human alternative 5'ss and 3'ss exons
in that they were markedly biased toward overlapping
splice sites, with A5Es biased for E = 4 nucleotides (tandem donors, A5E∆4), in contrast to A3Es biased for E = 3
nucleotides (tandem acceptors, A3E∆3). Both, A3E and
A5E biases in exon length variation have been previously
reported [20,24,25], but their pertinent features have
largely remained hidden. It is important to note that AS at
both the 5'ss and 3'ss gives rise to splicing variations with
very subtle changes to the encoded protein sequence, but
further downstream A5E∆4 and A3E∆3 splicing exons
lead to very different consequences. While A3E∆3 splicing
exons of the form of NAG/NAG/have been analyzed in
some detail, in part with several controversial interpretations [20,24], A5E∆4 splicing exons had not previously
been confirmed experimentally and only initially been
characterized [25].
In this context, pertinent questions are whether 1) such
frequently observed changes arise possibly by spliceosomal error, and 2) the eukaryotic cell has found a way to
neutralize or even benefit from downstream consequences that arise from such AS events. Provided their
biological authenticity, what is the nature of overlapping
splice site choice? Several models for splice site choice
have been proposed, including the competition between
antagonistic splicing factors (e.g., ASF/SF2 and hnRNP
A1) and U1 snRNP [59-61], a scanning mechanism [62],
or cis-acting motifs with different free-energy for binding
U1 snRNP and splice factors between competing sites
[26]. These models take into account the binding property
of the U1 snRNA and additional factors. Consequently,
we investigated known features involved in splice site
choice, as well as consequences to the post-transcriptional
regulation of A5E∆4-carrying genes, and compared A5E∆4
splicing exons with A3E∆3 and constitutive splicing exons
in the light of existing models for 5'ss selection.
Examined features showed differences that individually
came out subtle, yet taken in concert were indicative of a
spliceosomal distinction of overlapping 5'ss. We found
that overlapping tandem donors, but not acceptors, can
be distinguished into major-form (P∆4, type-I; D∆4, typeII) and minor-form (d∆4, type-I; p∆4, type-II) splicing
exons for both proximal and distal splice sites. This is further corroborated by splice site scores, which correlated
with their respective major/minor-form behavior. On the
one hand, splice sites deviated most from the consensus
for P∆4 splicing exons at positions P-4, P-3, and P3 (∆I > 0)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/202

as well as P4, P5 (∆I < 0), overlapping positions of U1
snRNA nucleotides implicated in 5'ss selection [26,46];
some of which have also been related to codon preference
[25]. Interestingly, more distant positions, such as P-12
also displayed statistically significant deviations from the
consensus. Because of its close proximity to the edge of
the U1 snRNA stem-loop it possibly contributes to U1
binding when d∆4 is spliced. On the other hand, D∆4
splicing exons showed different deviations from the consensus at P-2, P-1, P2 (∆I < 0) as well as P5, P6 (∆I < 0). Based
on other experiments on position-specific stabilizing and
advancing spliceosomal interactions with the 5'ss, these
differences between type-I and type-II are indicative that
P∆4 improves above D∆4 splicing compatibility with U1snRNA,
Previous computational studies showed the conservation
of sequences flanking ACEs at higher levels as compared
with sequences around species-specific or constitutively
spliced exons [12,63]. We observed higher levels of conservation around P∆4, but similar levels for D∆4 splicing
exons, when compared with constitutive exons (or the 5'ss
of A3E∆3 splicing exons). Interestingly, the higher level is
in accord with a larger number of detected splicing-regulatory (ESS) elements, often positioned in proximity to
A5E tandem donors. In contrast to typical AS events, however, tandem donors are hindered to place regulatory elements between alternative donors. Our data show an
elevation of ESE elements near d∆4, in conjunction with
an enrichment of ESS elements of flanking introns. This
could be interpreted in a model, in which tandem donors
restrictively exploit elements in proximal polarity (near
d∆4), to attract the U1 snRNP to this site of the tandem
donor, and/or in distal polarity to d∆4, to impair binding
to P∆4 [61].
For the majority of tandem donors was embedded in CDS
regions, the downstream effects of ∆4 splicing was predictive of producing PTCs. Splicing at p∆4 produced putative
NMD substrates in more than two-thirds of all cases,
whereas d∆4 splicing exons showed about one-quarter,
suggesting that p∆4 and d∆4 (the minor-forms) were
more likely to serve as the corresponding NMD candidates. Interestingly, a small set of A5E∆4-carrying genes
avoided PTCs, yet instead was inferred to use DTCs
(delayed termination codons) positioned downstream of
the original signal. Utilization of the E15 proximal tandem donor of the human SFRS16 gene, e.g., with significantly high levels of E15 flanking sequence conservation
well over 120 nucleotides in I16 (typical of RNA splicing
conservation across species [12]), produced a PTC that
apparently avoided NMD [64]. Using differentially binding antibodies, a previous study [30] showed that SFRS16
produced two detectable isoforms, which correspond to
E15 tandem splicing. In another example, a ∆ 4-type 5'ss

change from type-I (wild-type) to type-II splicing was
observed in E10 of human patients with a deficiency in
the adenosin deaminase (ADA) gene, where a P+1G>A
transition downstream of E10 activated splicing of a latent
proximal donor [65].
A survey of gene ontology (GO) functions of the categories "molecular function" and "biological process" for
genes with P∆4 and D∆4 splicing exons showed a significant enrichment in several proteins, while after corrections for multiple testing only the single GO-term "RNA
binding" (P < 0.005, t-test) was significantly enriched,
when compared between P∆4 and dΨ4, as well as D∆4
and pΨ4, splicing exons (see Methods).

Conclusion
This study substantially affirms the utilization of tandem
donors, thus supporting and complementing earlier findings of previously undetected AS events [25,44]. While
there exist examples of cryptic ∆ 4-type 5'ss in the literature [33,66], here we demonstrated that such splice variations are potentially enriched in authentic AS events, also
supported by experimental studies [30,67]. Critically, pertinent data are not yet at hand to make conclusive inference about the specific regulation of A5E∆4 splicing exons
(e.g. controlled expression of species-specific minor/
major isoforms), here transcript data acquisition and careful spliced-alignments have added to a higher confidence
of tandem donor (and acceptor) utilization, and deeper
insight will require different types of data, e.g., from minigenes in different organ systems and cell types, U1 snRNP
mutants, or variations of splicing factor dosages.
In one extreme view, incorporating a mechanistic and
dosage-dependent model [26,61], the selection of AS sites
depends on the properties of U1 and/or U6 snRNPs binding interrelated with antagonistic effects mediated by
splicing enhancing and suppressing factors. Thus it was
shown, e.g., that the choice of a tandem splice site of E10
of the FGFR gene can be determined by a higher sequencecompatibility of the E10 proximal splice site (p∆6) to U6
snRNA [49]. In addition, constraints set by secondary
mRNA structures [68,69] have been shown to influence
splice site choice. In the opposite extreme, suggested by
the reduced difference of splice site scores, tandem donors
could be the outcome of stochastic binding at overlapping
5'ss and lack implicit functional implications [24], which
is supported by type-I isoforms. Either view largely
requires the NMD pathway to control deliberatively or
aberrantly produced truncated messages.
Coming back to the question of whether there is a possible benefit of generating flawed mRNA isoforms, by deliberately or aberrantly produced AS variants with out-offrame shifts and PTCs (either due to A5E∆4 or other types

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/202

of AS), what could be their functional utilization on the
transcriptional or translational level? If such splice variants would be generally produced across organ systems
and cell types, in addition to their normal splice variants,
cells would have means of producing low levels of imperfect proteins. Depending on the efficiency of mRNA quality control, a fraction of which is subjected to the NMD
pathway during the first pioneer round of translation and
degraded, while a remaining fraction could still misfold
and – depending on the quality control of protein synthesis – form defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). Ubiquitin-tagged peptide fragments that originate from DRiPs
have recently been identified as a potent source of antigens for display by the MHC class I molecules on the cell
surface to cognate CD8+ T-cells, in agreement with a
recently suggested mechanism of "immune surveillance"
[70-72]. A motivating example is given by the human
Tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), which utilizes two
different reading-frames to produce the protein gp75 (recognized by IgG) and a truncated 24 amino-acids long peptide. The latter was shown to be the source of an antigenic
peptide specifically recognized by T-cells as a tumor rejection antigen [73]. It remains to be substantiated whether
such antigenic peptides are linked to AS events that produce variants with out-of-frame shifts, such as produced
by tandem donors.

Methods
Data set of alternative exons
Exons of human and mouse genes were extracted from the
HOLLYWOOD database [23]. For two different transcripts aligned to a genomic locus, alternative 5'ss exons
(A5Es) matched at their 3'ss, but exhibited exactly one
short and one long splice form resulting from variation at
the 5'ss. Alternative 3'ss exons (A3Es) matched at their
5'ss, but exhibited exactly one short and one long splice
form resulting from variation at the 3'ss. Constitutive
exons (CEs) were defined as exons of multi-exon genes
that have as of date no transcript-supported evidence for
undergoing any type of AS. In all AS events, A5Es, A3Es
and CEs are "internal exons", and each exons had to obey
the consensus splice sites/GT or/GC at the 5'ss and AG/at
the 3'ss. U12-type introns were excluded from this analysis, because of their low fraction (less than 1% of the
human introns).
Spliced-alignments
Manual inspection of A5Es with short extensions (E < 6
nucleotides), previously excluded in HOLLYWOOD,
revealed a substantial amount of putative alignment artifacts due to misaligned nucleotides close to exon-intron
junctions [see Additional File 1]. Alignments were derived
for ESTs by the SIM4 program [74], and were corroborated
in a recent performance study of spliced-alignment algorithms [75]. In particular, we found examples were SIM4

introduces shifts of EST nucleotides between genomic
donor and acceptor sites at genomic loci that encode short
varying alternative exon (cf. Figure 1). To decrease the
number of spurious alignments in the dataset of A5Es and
A3Es, we used the original ESTs and created new transcript-to-genomic alignments, by utilizing two different
algorithms: 1) BLAT [76], as stored in the UCSC database
(see Availability and requirements section for URL); and
2) EXALIN [75], with the parameter set (m, n, q, r, x) =
(25, 25, -25, -25, and -25). Manual inspection of control
samples in the alignment results confirmed a clearly
improved quality in the correct exon-intron boundary recognition. In all, about 35% of all initial A5E predictions
(~9 %) of A5E∆4 splicing exons could be confirmed by
both BLAT and EXALIN alignments. Subsequent analyses
were performed using the subset confirmed by three alignment methods.
Classification of major and minor tandem donors
The number of transcripts that aligned either to the distal
N(d) or proximal N(p) donor was used to classify A5Es.
To this end, one can 1) calculate the ratio R (0 < R ≤ 1) of
the lower over the higher transcript coverage as R = N(d)/
N(p), if N(d) <N(p), or 1/R if N(p) <N(d); 2) compute the
overall number of A5Es below a threshold value, R <T (0
< T < 1); and 3) define A5Es as "major" if the transcript
coverage was at least twice as large as the corresponding
"minor" splice site (T = 0.5). In this analysis, the threshold
for minimal coverage was taken as a single transcript.
Statistical analysis of splice site
The deviation of splice sites from the consensus was quantified by a maximum-entropy scoring model, implemented in MAXENTSCAN and publicly available [34].
The 5'ss model incorporates the last three (first six) nucleotides of the exon (intron), and the 3'ss model incorporates the last 20 (first three) nucleotides of the intron
(exon). Sequence logos and pictograms were computed
and displayed using the WEBLOGO tool with finite-sample size correction [37].

P-values of splice site frequencies where calculated as follows: 1) frequencies of occurrences at the considered at
P∆4 and pΨ4 splicing exons, as well as D∆4 and dΨ4
splicing exons, where compared by a 4 × 2 contingency
table and χ2-test; 2) statistically significant positions were
selected at P < 0.05; 3) at the same position, the nucleotide (maximally two nucleotides) with the largest difference of the frequency of occurrence between two types
(e.g., P∆4 and pΨ4) was subsequently tested against the
remaining nucleotides by 2 × 2 contingency table and χ2test, where P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/202

The information along a sequence was calculated as the
relative (or Kullback-Leibler) entropy, which estimates
the "distance" between an observed frequency distribution (p) to an expected frequency distribution (q), according to [77]

I=

∑p
k

k

p 
⋅ log 2  k 
 qk 

where k denotes the number of possible outcomes. The
summation over all relevant sequence positions gives the
total information score. The background distribution was
taken as (q1, q2, q3, q4) = {A,G,C,T} = (0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2).
Identification of non-sense codons
For each A5E∆4 splicing exon, the longest cDNA that
mapped to the corresponding gene with annotated CDS
start and end position was taken as a reference sequence.
In most cases such a reference was only available for either
the proximal or distal alternative splice form. Identification of mRNAs with the potential to trigger NMD was performed, by comparing the reading-frame after splicing at
each tandem donor. Tandem events led to a new readingfame, the first downstream non-sense codon of which was
detected and analyzed for PTCs occurring more than 50
nucleotides upstream of the last exon-exon junction to
elicit NMD [5,50].
Detection of sequence conservation
The core of A5E∆4 splicing exons was matched against
mouse genomic DNA (version mm03), using BLAST with
parameter values -a2 -gT -W10 -q-2 -r3 -e0.001. Significant
matches of similarity were filtered for canonical splice
sites and exon-flanking regions of 200 nucleotides were
extracted from the genomic sequence. Subsequently,
orthologous human and mouse intron regions were
aligned using the DNA BLOCK ALIGNER [78], with
parameter values -nomatchn -gap 0.02 -blockopen 0.2 umatch 0.05 -pff, which detects block of conserved
sequences located at possible different positions relative
to splice junction. The sequence position of detected
blocks of conservation was parsed and recorded with the
script DBA-PARSER (Holste, unpublished data) and plotted in a region of 100 nucleotides, with a moving-average
of ten nucleotides. Exon conservation was determined by
the score (Sort) from CLUSTALW alignments, self-alignment of the larger exons to yield the score Sid, and calculation of the normalized score Stot = Sort/Sid.
Experimental assay
1) RT-PCR amplification: For validation of splice variants,
nested PCR was performed using 100 ng cDNA templates
from the Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panels I and II
(BD Biosciences). Splice variants were enriched for EST
originating from different cDNA libraries and, for a given

Page 21 of 25

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:202

gene, suitable tissues were chosen according to the origin
of ESTs for the minor splice variant or the expression profile found in the Stanford SOURCE data base [79]. Primers were obtained from Metabion. Nested RT-PCR
reactions were set up with ReadyToGo PCR beads (Amersham) and 10 pmol primer in 25 µl total volume, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The thermocycle
protocol was 1 min 30 sec initial denaturation at 93°C,
followed by 25 cycles of 40 sec denaturation at 93°C, 40
sec annealing at 55°C, 1 min extension at 72°C, and a
final 4 min extension step at 72°C. In the second round
of nested PCR, 2 µl first-round product was amplified for
30 cycles. Ethanol-precipitated PCR products were directly
sequenced using target-specific forward and reverse primers; 2) Sanger sequencing: Reactions were set up with 200
ng template DNA, 10 pmol primer, and BigDye v3.1
(Applied Biosystems) in 10 µl final volume, according to
the supplier's instructions. The thermocycle protocol was
5 min initial denaturation at 95°C, followed by 29 cycles
of 30 s denaturation at 95°C, 10 s annealing at 55°C, 4
min extension at 60°C. After ethanol precipitation, automated sequence separation and detection was done on an
ABI 3730XL sequencer. Electropherograms were processed by PHRED [80]. After automated assembly (Staden
package, [81]), sequence variations were verified by manual inspection using GAP4 (Staden package).
Presence of splicing-regulatory elements
Searching for splicing regulatory elements in exon-flanking regions was performed by using the following data
sets (compiled in [82]): 176 predicted exonic splicing
silencers identified in Wang et al. [83], 753 predicted
intronic enhancers and/or silcencers identified in Yeo et
al. [29], and 1,013 putative exonic splicing silencers identified in Zhang et al. [84]. All elements were searched for
in a region of 100 nucleotides flanking proximal tandem
donors, and exact matches were counted in non-overlapping sequence windows of 20 nucleotides.
Gene ontology (GO) annotations
GO-terms for genes with A5E∆4 splicing exons (358 GO
terms), A5Es (1,414), and CEs (3,655) were obtained
from the Ensembl database (see Availability and requirments section for URL), corresponding to 129 and 1,283
genes with A5E∆4 splicing exons or A5Es, respectively,
and 8,664 genes of a control set. GO annotations for
A5E∆4 splicing exons of 129 of 166 genes (representing
the total set of 171 A5E∆4 splicing exons) were mapped,
and the most frequent category annotations "molecular
function" and "biological process" were selected; in
decreasing order: "ATP binding", "Zinc ion binding",
"Regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent", "Transferase activity", "Signal transduction", "Hydrolase activity", "RNA binding", "Protein binding", "Transcription
factor activity" and "DNA binding". In order to compare

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/202

the GO annotations of A5E∆4 genes against a control,
10,000 genes with at least one pseudo splice site, dΨ4 or
pΨ4 splicing exons (each comprising 129 genes) were
sampled and the frequency of occurrence of a certain GO
term was computed. The statistical significance (P-value)
was calculated analogous to [29], by assessing the frequency of occurrence that a certain GO-term was present
in the control more frequently than in the A5E∆4 gene set,
divided by 10,000. The outcome showed the following
categories as significant as the 0.005 percent level: "Signal
transduction (P∆4/d∆4 vs 5'ss/dΨ4, 0.07; D∆4/p∆4 vs
5'ss/pΨ4, 0.15), "RNA binding" (0.0004; 0.003), "GTP
binding" (0.02; 0.04), "Electron transport" (0.02; 0.03),
"Protein biosynthesis" (0.01; 0.03), "Signal transducer
activity" (0.04; 0.08). To correct for multiple testing, we
applied a (conservative) Bonferroni correction [85],
divided the P-value chosen by the number of performed
tests, and GO-terms occurring with Pc < 0.05/10 = 0.005
were considered as significant.
