Abstract

Ascorbate (vitamin C) is generally known for its detoxification of damaging reactive oxygen species during aerobic metabolism and under stress conditions [1]. Through the
modulation of levels of reactive oxygen species, ascorbate is
implicated in the control of cell expansion, cell division and

programmed cell death [2]. As a cofactor to numerous ironand copper-containing oxygenases, ascorbate is also involved
in the biosynthesis of essential molecules, such as the plant
hormones ethylene and gibberellic acid, cell-wall glycoproteins and antimicrobial agents [3,4]. The recent unraveling of
the ascorbate biosynthetic pathway in plants [5,6] has

interactions

Conclusions: All cytochromes b561 have probably evolved from a common ancestral protein
before the separation of plants and animals. Their phyletic distribution mirrors the use of ascorbate
as primary antioxidant, indicating their role in ascorbate homeostasis and antioxidative defense. In
plants, the differentiation into four cytochrome b561 isoforms probably occurred before the
separation between monocots and dicots.

refereed research

Results: Cytochromes b561 have been identified in a large number of phylogenetically distant
species, but are absent in fungi and prokaryotes. Most species contain three or four cytochrome
b561 paralogous proteins, and the encoding genes usually have four or five exons. At the protein
level, sequence similarities are rather low between cytochromes b561 within a single species (3445% identity), and among phylogenetically distant species (around 30% identity). However,
particular structural features characterizing this protein family are well conserved in members from
all species investigated. These features comprise six transmembrane helices, four strictly conserved
histidine residues, probably coordinating the two heme molecules, and putative ascorbate and
monodehydro-ascorbate (MDHA) substrate-binding sites. Analysis of plant cytochromes b561
shows a separation between those from monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species in a
phylogenetic tree.

deposited research

Background: As an antioxidant and cofactor to numerous metabolic enzymes, ascorbate has an
essential role in plants and animals. Cytochromes b561 constitute a class of intrinsic membrane
proteins involved in ascorbate regeneration. Despite their importance in ascorbate metabolism, no
evolutionary analysis has been presented so far on this newly described protein family.

resulted in a renewed interest in this molecule, and in the
recognition that much remains to be learned about its regulation and metabolism.
While our knowledge of ascorbate biosynthesis and catabolism is rapidly expanding, little is known about the mechanisms by which ascorbate is regenerated throughout the plant
cell. Cytochromes b561 constitute a newly identified class of
membrane proteins possibly implicated in replenishing
ascorbate pools in plant cells, essential to maintaining the
physiological functions of this important molecule [7].
Cytochromes b561 are intrinsic membrane proteins containing two heme molecules, and reducible by ascorbate [8,9].
They have been suggested to function as electron transporters, shuttling electrons across membranes from ascorbate to
an acceptor molecule. The one-electron oxidation product of
ascorbate, monodehydro-ascorbate (MDHA) has been
shown, at least in vitro, to function as an electron acceptor for
mammalian and plant cytochromes b561 [8,10,11]. The cytochrome b561-catalyzed reduction of MDHA results in the regeneration of the fully reduced ascorbate molecule.
The presence of cytochromes b561 in plants was first demonstrated on the basis of their biochemical properties. Ascorbate-reducible cytochromes with a wavelength maximum
near 561 nm and a typically high redox potential (E'0 around
+140 mV) were found in purified plasma membrane fractions
from various species [12,13]. The availability of the primary
sequence of the cytochrome b561 from bovine adrenal gland
chromaffin cells [14,15] has recently resulted in the identification of homologous sequences in plants [7,16]. Putative cytochrome b561-encoding genes have now been identified in
nearly all organisms for which considerable genomic sequence information is available, including invertebrates (insects, nematodes, platyhelminths, tunicates), vertebrates
(mammals, amphibians) and plants (both monocots, dicots
and gymnosperms) (this paper and [7,17]). The presence of
cytochromes b561 in a wide variety of species indicates the
general importance of this class of proteins in eukaryotic cell
physiology.
Members of the cytochrome b561 protein family are characterized by a number of structural features, likely to play an essential part in their function [7,17,18]. They are highly
hydrophobic proteins with six transmembrane helices, four
conserved His residues, possibly coordinating two heme molecules, and predicted substrate-binding sites for ascorbate
and monodehydro-ascorbate (MDHA). The occurrence of cytochromes b561 in species phylogenetically remote as nematodes and mammals, tunicates and insects, or amphibians
and plants, is intriguing. The strict conservation of essential
structural features suggests that the mode of action and physiological function of these proteins may be very similar. We
present here a further analysis of the similarities and differences between cytochromes b561 throughout the animal and

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/6/R38

plant kingdoms, at the level of genomic organization and protein structure. Also, we examine the phylogenetic relations
between all cytochrome b561 proteins identified so far, to allow hypotheses to be made on the evolution of these ubiquitous proteins.

Results
Analysis of cytochrome b561-encoding genes
Upon the completion of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome
project in December 2000, it became possible to identify all
genes encoding cytochromes b561 in a plant. Four putative
b561 genes were identified in A. thaliana: Artb561-1 to -4 (for
Arabidopsis thaliana cyt b561) [7]. Genomic sequences possibly encoding cytochromes b561 were also identified in
Oryza sativa and Craterostigma plantagineum. Most putative b561-encoding sequences from other plant species, however, are so far only represented by expressed sequence tags
(ESTs).
Genomic sequences for cytochromes b561 are also known for
a number of animal species, including Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Homo sapiens (human)
and Mus musculus (mouse). The genomes of human and
mouse each encode three cytochromes b561: one involved in
ascorbate regeneration inside chromaffin granules (Hosb5611, Mumb561-1), one present in the duodenum (Hosb561-2,
Mumb561-2) that may function as a ferric reductase in the
plasma membrane of duodenal mucosa, and a third that
seems to have a ubiquitous distribution in mammalian tissues, but whose physiological function is not known. This is
tentatively referred to as 'ubiquitous cytochrome b561'
(Hosb561-3, Mumb561-3) (H.A., unpublished work).
All the A. thaliana sequences have a similar organization,
with four exons of comparable lengths (Artb561-1 is shown in
Figure 1). The intron-exon structure of cytochrome b561
genes identified in O. sativa and C. plantagineum is similar
(Figure 1). Mammalian genes coding for the duodenal cytochrome b561 isoform also have a similar organisation as their
plant homologues, with four exons and three introns (Figure
1). Interestingly, however, genes encoding the two other
mammalian b561 cytochromes have five exons (Figure 1). Cytochrome b561 genes with a different intron-exon structure
within one species are also present in C. elegans. One of the
C. elegans cytochrome b561 proteins (F55H2.5) is encoded by
a gene (Caeb561-1) consisting of only two exons and one intron (Figure 1), while the two other genes in this nematode
(F39G3.4 and F39G3.5; Caeb561-2 and -3 respectively) each
have four exons. Similarly, two homologous genes have been
identified in the fruit fly D. melanogaster (CG1275 and
CG8776). The first has two different splicing variants, each
with four exons, and the second gene has either five or six exons, also depending on splicing.

The presence of five exons in the mammalian chromaffin
granule cytochrome b561 has been considered to support a
five transmembrane helix structure for these proteins [19].
However, the occurrence of cytochrome b561-encoding genes
with very different gene structures indicates that this one-helix-one-exon model is probably not valid for all members of
this protein family. Moreover, secondary-structure

prediction routines almost invariably indicate the presence of
six transmembrane helices for each of the identified putative
cytochrome b561 genes. The correlation between predicted
transmembrane structures and intron-exon structure is presented in Figure 2 for three different A. thaliana genes

Correlation between transmembrane helices and exon-intron structure in plant and human chromaffin cytochrome b561 proteins and genes. For each
protein-gene pair, the protein is shown in the top line with the transmembrane helices as gray bars, and the gene organization is shown below with exons

(Hosb561-1). This analysis indicates that individual transmembrane helices may be encoded by different exons. For example, the predicted transmembrane helices 4 in Artb561-2,
helix 6 from Artb561-4 and helix 4 in Hosb561-1 are each encoded by exons 3 and 4 (Figure 2). In rice, transmembrane
helix 5 is partially encoded by exon 2 and exon 3. A similar situation, in which single transmembrane helices are encoded
by more than one exon, was observed for the plasma membrane ATPase (BT002855) and an A. thaliana sodium channel (AY113938) (data not shown). The number of full
transmembrane helices encoded by individual exons also varies among the genes. In the different cytochrome b561-encoding genes in A. thaliana, the first exon respectively encodes
one, two or three helices (Figure 2).
Alternative splicing of cytochrome b561-encoding genes is
observed in D. melanogaster. Different transcripts are found
for each of the two putative genes (CG1275 and CG8776). The
first gene has two transcripts (Drmb561-1 and -2), each encoded by four exons. Drmb561-1 is only different from
Drmb561-2 in that it has 86 extra amino acids at the amino
terminus. This extra region (predicted to be cytoplasmic) is
absent in all other cytochrome b561 proteins identified thus
far. The second gene from D. melanogaster has three

different transcripts, encoded by five (Drmb561-3) or six
(Drmb561-4 and -5) exons. Again, the only difference is seen
at the amino terminus of the encoded proteins. Drmb561-5 is
nearly identical to Drmb561-3, with only a difference in 20
amino-terminal amino acids. The sequence of the Drmb561-4
protein corresponds to that of the other two proteins, except
for the lack of 80 amino acids at the amino terminus. At the
protein level, Drmb561-4 thus proves to be the shortest isoform, lacking the first transmembrane helix. All six helices
are present in the other two isoforms.

Comparison of putative cytochrome b561 proteins
The only cytochrome b561 protein that has so far been purified and sequenced, is the bovine chromaffin granule cytochrome b561 [14,15]. On the basis of sequence similarity to
this protein, a large number of putative cytochrome b561 protein sequences have been identified from EST sequences obtained from a large variety of species [7]. The similarity
between sequences from different organisms is usually not
high at the DNA level. However, at the protein level well-conserved features are apparent. In Figure 3 a selection of cytochrome b561 protein sequences from phylogenetically diverse
species is aligned. As reported by [17], and as apparent from
Figure 1, the conservation in the first and sixth

The outcome for the phylogenetic tree was essentially the
same when T-Coffee [21] or POA [22] software packages were
used, which are in some cases considered more reliable than
Clustal W [23]. Similarly, using only the central cytochrome
b561 'core domain' as defined by Ponting [24], instead of the
full sequence, the clustering of cytochrome b561 homologs is

refereed research

When all available cytochrome b561 protein sequences - including those derived from ESTs - are aligned with Clustal W
[20], and subsequently organized in a phylogenetic tree (Figure 4), two main clusters containing the plant and animal cytochromes b561 can be discriminated. However, the position
of the Artb561-3 orthologs in the plant cluster is not supported by high bootstrap values (less than 80%).

In addition to the conserved structural features mentioned
above, all cytochromes b561 show strict conservation of five
Gly, two Pro, one Lys and one Gln (green in Figure 3). A
number of aromatic residues are also well conserved (yellow
in Figure 3). These have been suggested to take part in the
electron transfer between the two heme molecules, possibly
by electron tunneling [17].

Phylogeny of cytochromes b561

Most of the plant cytochrome b561 sequences so far have been
obtained from dicotyledonous plants, but for Artb561-1 and 2 some orthologs from monocotyledons are available. These
form separate 'sub-clusters' within the clusters of Artb561-1
and -2 respectively, whereas an Artb561-1 ortholog from the
gymnosperm P. taeda is more distantly related with these
clusters. For Artb561-3 and -4 no orthologs have been identified in monocotyledonous plants so far. Within the animal
group, all known chromaffin granule cytochromes b561 from H. sapiens (human, Hosb561-1), M. musculus (mouse,
Mumb561-1), Sus scrofa (pig, Susb561), Bos taurus (bovine,
Botb561) and Ovis aries (sheep, Ovab561) are clustered together with the homolog from Xenopus laevis (African clawed
frog, Xelb561). The duodenal cytochromes b561 from humans, mouse and rat (Hosb561-2, Mumb561-2 and Ranb5612) form a separate group, as do the chromaffin granule cytochromes b561 and the third type of mammalian cytochrome
b561 ('ubiquitous' cytochrome b561 from humans and mouse,
Hosb561-3 and Mumb561-3). The position of the cytochrome
b561 protein from Ciona intestinalis (Ciib561; sea squirt, a tunicate) is uncertain, as the bootstrap value is below 80%. The
cytochrome b561 homologs identified in C. elegans and the
flatworm Dugesia japonica could not reliably be associated
with any of the clusters.

reports

The suggested ascorbate-binding site (ALLVYRVFR in the
mammalian chromaffin cytochrome b561 [18]) is almost perfectly conserved in all mammalian proteins, but the degree of
conservation is much lower in plants (Figure 3). The first
three or four amino acids of this consensus sequence are generally hydrophobic, and the Tyr is found in all proteins except
Artb561-4, in which it is replaced by His. The triplet codons
for Tyr and His differ by only one nucleotide, suggesting that
a single point mutation may be responsible for this substitution. The His at this position is found in all Artb561-4 orthologs from other plant species (data not shown), and
therefore seems a consistent substitution in this isoform of
plant cytochromes b561. The Arg from this motif is conservatively replaced by Lys in all available plant sequences. To the
best of our knowledge the sequence requirement for ascorbate and MDHA binding has not been experimentally confirmed, and so it is not possible to evaluate whether the
observed conservation is sufficient for the functional interaction with the ascorbate-MDHA redox couple.

A closer examination of the plant group reveals the clustering
of sequences from Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato,
Lyeb561), L. hirsutum (Lyhb561), Solanum tuberosum (potato, Sotb561), C. plantagineum (resurrection plant, Crpb561),
Beta vulgaris (beet, Bevb561-1), Populus tremula (poplar,
Potb561), Medicago truncatula (barrel medic, Metb561-1),
Oryza sativa (rice, Orsb561), Zea mays (maize, Zemb561),
Hordeum vulgare (barley, Hovb561-1), Sorghum bicolor
(sorghum, Sobb561), Triticum aestivum (wheat, Trab561-1)
and T. monococcum (Trmb561) with the Artb561-1 protein,
suggesting that these proteins are orthologs of Artb561-1 from
A. thaliana. The localization of a cytochrome b561 from Pinus
taeda (loblolly pine, Pitb561) within this cluster is not supported by a bootstrap value above 80% and should be interpreted with caution. Similarly, sequences from T. aestivum
(Trab561-2), H. vulgare (Hovb561-2), M. truncatula
(Metb561-2), Glycine max (soybean, Glmb561-2), Zinnia elegans (zinnia, Zieb561) and B. vulgaris (Bevb561-2) are clustered with Artb561-2. Orthologs of Artb561-3 have been
identified in Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (ice plant,
Mecb561-3), M. truncatula (Metb561-3) and Gossypium hirsutum (cotton, Gohb561), and Artb561-4 orthologs in M.
truncatula (Metb561-4) and B. vulgaris (Bevb561-4).

reviews

In addition to the conservation of the predicted transmembrane structures, four His residues suggested to bind the two
heme groups are strictly conserved in all cytochrome b561 homologs. Furthermore, predicted binding sites for MDHA and
ascorbate - as suggested by [18] - are conserved. A potential
MDHA-binding motif - xYSLHSWxGx - with x being a hydrophobic amino acid in most proteins, is highly conserved. In
the Anopheles gambiae (malaria mosquito) b561 protein,
Angb561, the Ser is conservatively replaced by Thr. The Tyr in
the consensus sequence is not conserved in the proteins from
C. elegans - Caeb561-1, -2 and -3 - nor in Artb561-3, but it is
present in all Artb561-3 orthologs identified in other plant
species (data not shown).

comment

transmembrane helix of the cytochromes b561 is limited to
the overall hydrophobicity. This observation suggests that
these helices may be primarily involved in protein folding and
stability, rather than in the catalytic activity.

At the gene level, conservation among cytochrome b561-encoding genes is not very high [7]. The genomic organization
usually comprises four or five exons in plants and mammals
(Figure 1). In addition to genes with four or five exons, invertebrates contain homologous genes with only two exons (C.
elegans F55H2.5), or with six exons (D. melanogaster).
Splice variants are observed for D. melanogaster CG1275 and
CG8776. This alternative splicing results in a cytochrome
b561 protein with an additional amino-terminal region
(Drmb561-1), and in a protein that lacks the first of the six

Discussion

deposited research

Comparison of cytochromes b561 from dicotyledonous species to their orthologs from monocotyledons reveals that Ks
and Ka values are generally both around 0.3 to 0.5. Knowing
that both clades diversified 130 million years ago [27], the
average rate of synonymous and nonsynonymous
substitutions is calculated to be around 3 × 10-9 substitutions
per position per year (Table 1). This is comparable to the synonymous evolution rate of other nuclear-encoded plant genes
(5-30 × 10-9 substitutions/position/year [28]). Among dicotyledons (using estimated divergence times for different families, derived from Figure 2 in [29]) the average synonymous
substitution rate is higher (12.63 ± 2.41 × 10-9 substitutions/
position/year), but the nonsynonymous rate is very similar
(2.38 ± 1.18 × 10-9 substitutions/position/year). For the resurrection plant (C. plantagineum), however, which has
adapted to life in an extremely dry environment, a particularly high nonsynonymous substitution rate was found as compared to the ortholog from potato (13.25 × 10-9 substitutions/
position/year), whereas the synonymous rate was the same as
for the orthologs in other dicots (Table 1).

The Gu99 likelihood ratio test in the DIVERGE software
package [31] was used to examine whether proteins from different branches in the phylogenetic tree have different functional constraints, and whether they may have functionally
diverged. The Theta ML value, indicative for the level of
functional divergence between proteins [31], is relatively low
(0.213) according to [32], when monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous Artb561-1 orthologs are compared. This
suggests that these orthologs are likely to have similar biochemical functions. The Gu99 likelihood assay also indicated
that a functional adaptation may have occurred at only five
amino acids between these orthologs, supporting their functional similarity. A similar analysis of Artb561-1 and -2 orthologs yielded a theta ML value of 0.533, and 22 residues
that may have functionally adapted. These numbers are still
rather low [32]. However, four of these residues (A, I, S and
P) are situated in the predicted ascorbate-binding site (AIISYKSLP in Artb561-1). A similar analysis for the mammalian
cyts b561 (chromaffin cyts b561 versus the cluster with the
other two mammalian cyts b561) resulted in a very low theta
ML of 0.031, and no residues likely to have an altered
function.

reports

To examine the selective pressure on cytochrome b561-encoding genes after various gene duplication events, a Li93
analysis was performed using the DAMBE software package
[25,26], based on pairwise comparisons. The amount of
synonymous substitutions (Ks in Table 1) is apparently saturated when comparing Artb561-3 to the three other paralogous genes from A. thaliana, indicating that Artb561-3 may
represent an early gene duplication event, and has accumulated a large number of 'silent' substitutions. Nonsynonymous substitutions (that is, codon alterations leading to
amino acid replacements, Ka in Table 1) for these genes range
from 0.49 to 0.75 (substitutions/position), which is much
lower than the Ks values. Artb561-2 and -4 have the lowest Ks
(0.47), suggesting that they originated from a more recent
gene duplication in A. thaliana. Comparable values are found
for the orthologs of Artb561-2 and -4 in B. vulgaris and M.
truncatula, indicating that this last gene duplication had occurred well before the radiation within the dicotyledons (data
not shown). In mouse, Ks values are equally high (and
probably saturated) for the genes encoding the three cytochrome b561 isoforms. Ka values are also comparable to those
of the different plant isoforms (Table 1).

Ks and Ka were also calculated for animal cytochrome b561
genes. Comparing the gene from the tunicate C. intestinalis
(Ciib561), which branched off the vertebrate lineage around
540 million years ago [30], with the chromaffin granule cytochrome b561 genes from vertebrates (X. laevis, H. sapiens
and M. musculus) gives a Ks of around 0.65 and a Ka of 0.8.
This is remarkably low, considering the large phyletic
distance between tunicates and vertebrates, and implies synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates of 1-1.5 ×
10-9 substitutions/position/year.

Ks, synonymous substitutions; Ka, nonsynonymous substitutions. The rate of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions (right-hand columns) is
expressed as 10-9 substitutions/position/year. The estimated divergence times between different branches used for these calculations are 130 × 106
years for monocots-dicots [27], 12 × 106 years for tomato-potato [44], 540 × 106 years for tunicate-vertebrates [30], and 100 × 106 years for
human-mouse [45]. Divergence times for different dicot families are estimated from Figure 2 in [29]: 90 million years for Fabales (M. truncatula),
Caryophyllales (B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum) and Malvales (G. hirsutum), 40 million years for Lamiales (C. plantagineum) and Solanales (S. tuberosum), and

proteins in a range of phylogenetically very distinct species
(Figure 3). It should be noted that the conservation of the putative ascorbate-binding sites is high in the mammalian proteins, but considerably less in the plant sequences (Figure 3).
Although an ascorbate-reducible cytochrome b561 has been
demonstrated in several plant species [12,35], this theoretically leaves open the possibility that other substrates may
function as electron donors to the plant cytohromes b561. The
Gu99 likelihood analysis indicates that four amino-acid
residues in the ascorbate-binding site may show functional
adaptation, supporting the possibility of different substratebinding site affinities among cytochromes b561 in A.
thaliana.

Plant and animal cytochromes b561 generally separate into
two clusters in a phylogenetic tree (Figure 4), indicating a diversification early in evolution. The pairwise similarity between each of the A. thaliana cytochromes b561 and the
animal homologs is comparable (data not shown), suggesting
that they diversified within an evolutionarily short time span
from a single ancestral protein, after the separation between
plants and animals. Cytochrome b561 proteins from invertebrates (insects, nematode and flatworm) are not tightly
linked to the plant or mammalian cluster (Figure 4).
Within the mammalian cluster of cytochromes b561, the three

Database searches used BLAST [40] on the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI [41]).
Multiple sequence alignments were made with Clustal W
[20], and confirmed with POA [22] and T-Coffee [21], which
have been reported to give more accurate alignments [23].
These data were converted into a cladogram using Treecon
software [42]. Distances were calculated with Poisson correction, and for tree topology, complete linkage clustering was
used. The Li93 analysis was performed with DAMBE [26], after aligning the genes pairwise with Clustal W and T-Coffee.
The maximum likelihood analysis (Gu99) was performed
with the DIVERGE software [31], using the phylogenetic tree
from Figure 4. DIVERGE calculates a theta ML value indicative of the level of functional divergence between proteins in
different clusters of the tree, and a posterior probability to
trace the amino-acid positions that are likely to be responsible for the functional divergence between proteins in both
clusters. Transmembrane structures were predicted with TMHMM [43].

Cyts b561 are possibly involved in the regeneration of ascorbate through transmembrane electron transport [8,10,11,18].
This functional conservation is supported by our likelihood
ratio test (Gu99 test). As ascorbate is present in different subcellular organelles in plants and animals, it is not surprising
to find members of the cytochrome b561 protein family in different organelles. In humans, the chromaffin tissue
cytochrome b561 is present in the membrane of a subcellular
secretory vesicle [8,10,38], whereas the duodenal cytochrome
b561 is a plasma membrane protein [39]. The subcellular localization of the third human isoform (Hosb561-3) is not yet
known. In A. thaliana and several other plant species, at least
one of the cytochrome b561 isoforms is present in the plasma

reports

The clusters containing the A. thaliana isoforms Artb561-1
and Artb561-2 also contain homologous sequences from both
dicotyledons and monocotyledons. In both cases, the proteins
from monocots and dicots form separate sub-clusters. This
observation suggests that the four different cytochromes b561
have evolved separately in dicots and monocots, and hence
that the diversification between these proteins had already
occurred in their common ancestor. Substitution rates in cytochrome b561 genes from monocots and dicots are comparable to those in other plant nuclear-encoded genes (Table 1).
The Artb561-1 ortholog in the drought-resistant resurrection
plant (Crpb561), seems to have a remarkably high rate of nonsynonymous substitution (13.25/position/year). Interestingly, the Artb561-2 and -4 proteins tend to group in the same
cluster (Figure 4), suggesting that they diversified more
recently in evolution, which is supported by our Li93 analysis
(Table 1).

membrane [7,12]. The subcellular localization of the other
isoforms remains to be determined. The association with different membranes raises the question on the subcellular localization of the ancestral cytochrome b561. The apparent
absence of a cytochrome b561 in the plasma membrane of algae [7] can be taken as an indication that the primitive form
of the protein was located in internal membranes.

reviews

In addition to conclusions on the evolutionary relationship
between cytochromes b561 in different species, the cladogram points to interesting relations between cytochrome b561
isoforms within a single species. The four paralogous proteins
from A. thaliana (Artb561-1, -2, -3 and -4) form separate clusters with their respective orthologs from other plant species
(Figure 4). It is thus likely that gene duplication events had
already occurred in algae or primitive plants. The
identification of a cytochrome b561 in the gymnosperm P.
taeda (Pitb561) supports this suggestion.

and 'ubiquitous') form separate, monophyletic groups. The
presence of a cytochrome b561-like protein in C. intestinalis
is interesting. Tunicates, the most primitive chordates, are
considered the direct ancestors of vertebrates [36],
suggesting that the protein from C. intestinalis might represent an ancestral form of the mammalian cytochromes b561.
Synonymous substitution rates for the cytochrome b561
genes from C. intestinalis and different vertebrates are rather
low (1-1.5 × 10-9/position/year, Table 1), as compared to other nuclear-encoded mammalian genes (for example, 4.61 ×
10-9/position/year [37]). Nonsynonymous substitution rates
are in the same range, indicating a good conservation at the
protein level.
