Abstract
Background: Recent advances in DNA sequencing and computation offer the opportunity for
reliable estimates of divergence times between organisms based on molecular data. Bayesian
estimations of divergence times that do not assume the molecular clock use time constraints at
multiple nodes, usually based on the fossil records, as major boundary conditions. However, the
fossil records of bony fishes may not adequately provide effective time constraints at multiple
nodes. We explored an alternative source of time constraints in teleostean phylogeny by evaluating
a biogeographic hypothesis concerning freshwater fishes from the family Cichlidae (Perciformes:
Labroidei).
Results: We added new mitogenomic sequence data from six cichlid species and conducted
phylogenetic analyses using a large mitogenomic data set. We found a reciprocal monophyly of
African and Neotropical cichlids and their sister group relationship to some Malagasy taxa
(Ptychochrominae sensu Sparks and Smith). All of these taxa clustered with a Malagasy + Indo/Sri
Lankan clade (Etroplinae sensu Sparks and Smith). The results of the phylogenetic analyses and
divergence time estimations between continental cichlid clades were much more congruent with
Gondwanaland origin and Cretaceous vicariant divergences than with Cenozoic transmarine
dispersal between major continents.
Conclusion: We propose to add the biogeographic assumption of cichlid divergences by
continental fragmentation as effective time constraints in dating teleostean divergence times. We
conducted divergence time estimations among teleosts by incorporating these additional time
constraints and achieved a considerable reduction in credibility intervals in the estimated
divergence times.

Background
Recent technical advances in the molecular estimation of
divergence times have provided molecular evolutionists
with promising tools to introduce reliable time scales to
molecular phylogenetic trees [1]. One of the most significant advances common to these new methods is the
departure from the molecular clock assumption, which in
many cases does not strictly hold. Another advance is the
use of time constraints at multiple nodes, rather than the
assignment of a discrete time value to a particular node,
for rate calibration. This is useful because of the various
uncertainties in divergence time estimations based on fossil evidence. In general, the occurrence of the earliest fossil
assignable to a particular branch can define the lower
boundary of divergence time for the node at which this
branch departed from its sister branch [2]. However,
when the corresponding fossil data are inadequate or
sparse, the lower time boundary based on such data could
considerably postdate the true divergence time, potentially leading to inaccurate or imprecise dating results
[2,3].
In general, fossils of bony fishes are not considered well
preserved. Of the 425 teleostean families, 181 families do
not have a fossil record. Of the remaining 244 that have
fossil records, 58 have only otoliths [4]. Thus, lower
boundary values of divergence times based on teleostean
fossil evidence could underestimate the true values [5-7].
Therefore, alternative methods that may provide effective
time constraints in dating teleostean divergences should
be explored, e.g., methods based on reasonable biogeographic assumptions. Because freshwater fishes do not
disperse easily through saltwater, their evolution may be
tightly linked to the geological history of the landmasses
on which they evolved [8,9]. Thus, evaluating the potential correlation of continental drift and lineage divergences in each of the freshwater fish groups that have
multicontinental distributions is important [10].
Cichlids (order Perciformes: family Cichlidae) are freshwater fishes that are mainly distributed in landmasses of
Gondwanaland origin (Africa, South and Central America, Madagascar, and Indo/Sri Lanka) [11]. They have
experienced an explosive radiation in the Great Lakes of
East Africa, and they constitute one of the best-known
model organisms for evolutionary biology [12]. Phylogenetic studies based on morphological and molecular evidence have consistently recognized the monophyletic
origin of the family, basal divergences of Malagasy and
Indo/Sri Lankan taxa, and the sister-group relationship of
African and South American clades [13-16]. These patterns of divergence among continental cichlid groups are
entirely consistent with the geological history of continental drift, the proposed Gondwanan origin of Cichlidae,
and subsequent vicariant divergences [5,6,13-18]. How-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/215

ever, only a few molecular studies [7,19] have attempted
to evaluate this hypothesis by dating cichlid divergences;
their different approaches led to opposite conclusions.
Genner et al. [7] supported vicariant cichlid divergences
during Cretaceous times (vicariant hypothesis), whereas
Vences et al. [19] suggested a Cenozoic transmarine dispersal (dispersal hypothesis). The latter conclusion is
more consistent with the Eocene occurrence of the oldest
cichlid fossils [20].
We used molecular data obtained from complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences to investigate these
hypotheses. Among the 54 fish taxa that we sampled, we
newly determined the sequence data for six cichlid species. The two alternate hypotheses for cichlids, vicariant
and dispersal ones, were evaluated by estimating the
divergence times of the taxa using Bayesian analyses that
incorporated extensive fossil-based time constraints for
various divergences. Despite the relative paucity of fish
fossil records, this set of time constraints allowed us to
estimate cichlid divergence times with high enough resolution to discriminate between the two alternative
hypotheses.

Methods
Taxonomic sampling
Cichlid samples were obtained from local animal dealers
in Japan. We combined these new mitogenomic data with
48 previously published sequences from the DDBJ/EMBL/
GenBank nucleotide sequence database. The 10 cichlid
taxa that we analyzed (Table 1) cover species from major
Gondwana-origin landmasses. In addition, we chose 31
other teleosts, nine basal actinopterygians, and two sarcopterygians. Two sharks were sampled as an outgroup to
root the tree. Additional file 1 contains a complete list of
the sampled taxa, along with the database accession numbers of their mitogenomic sequences.
DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing
Fish samples were excised from live or dead specimens of
each species and immediately preserved in 99.5% ethanol. Total genomic DNA was extracted from muscle, liver,
and/or fin clips using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen) or a
DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen), following manufacturer
protocols. The mtDNA of each species was amplified
using a long-PCR technique with LA-Taq (Takara). Seven
fish-versatile primers for long PCR (S-LA-16S-L, L250816S, L12321-Leu, H12293-Leu, H15149-CYB, H106512S, and S-LA-16S-H [21-26]) and the two cichlid-specific
primers cichlid-LA-16SH (5'-TTGCGCTACCTTTGCACGGTCAAAATACCG-3') and cichlid-LA-16SL (5'-CGGAGTAATCCAGGTCAGTTTCTATCTATG-3') were used in
various combinations to amplify regions covering the
entire mtDNA in one or two reactions. The long-PCR

*Nearly complete mtDNA sequences with the control region partially sequenced

products were used as templates for subsequent short
PCR.
Over 100 fish-versatile PCR primers [21-27] and 18 taxonspecific primers (Additional file 2) were used in various
combinations to amplify contiguous, overlapping segments of the entire mtDNA for each of the six new cichlid
species. The long PCR and subsequent short PCRs were
performed as described previously [21,28]. The short-PCR
reactions were performed using the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) and Ex Taq DNA
polymerase (Takara).
Double-stranded PCR products, treated with ExoSAP-IT
(USB) to inactivate remaining primers and dNTPs, were
directly used for the cycle sequencing reaction, using dyelabeled terminators (Applied Biosystems) with amplification primers and appropriate internal primers. Labeled
fragments were analyzed on Model 3100 and Model 377
DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence manipulation
The DNA sequences obtained were edited and analyzed
using EditView 1.0.1, AutoAssembler 2.1 (Applied Biosystems) and DNASIS 3.2 (Hitachi Software Engineering Co.
Ltd.). Individual gene sequences were identified and
aligned with their counterparts in 48 previously published
mitogenomes. Amino acid sequences were used to align
protein-coding genes, and standard secondary structure
models for vertebrate mitochondrial tRNAs [29] were
consulted for the alignment of tRNA genes. The 12S and
16S rRNA sequences were initially aligned using clustalX
v. 1.83 [30] with default gap penalties and subsequently
adjusted by eye using MacClade 4.08 [31].

The ND6 gene was excluded from the phylogenetic analyses because of its heterogeneous base composition and
consistently poor phylogenetic performance [22]. The
control region was also excluded because positional
homology was not confidently established among such

distantly-related species. The third codon positions of
protein genes were excluded because of their extremely
accelerated rates of change that may cause high levels of
homoplasy. After the exclusion of unalignable parts in the
loop regions of tRNA genes, as well as the 5' and/or 3' end
regions of protein genes, all gene sequences were concatenated to produce 10,034-bp sites (6962, 1402, and 1670
positions for protein-coding, tRNA, and rRNA genes,
respectively) for phylogenetic analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using partitioned
Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses. Partitioned
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed using
MrBayes 3.1.2 [32]. We set four partitions (first codon,
second codon, tRNA, and rRNA positions). The general
time-reversible model, with some sites assumed to be
invariable and variable sites assumed to follow a discrete
gamma distribution (GTR + I + Γ; [33]), was selected as
the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution by MrModeltest 2.2 http://www.abc.se/~nylander/[34]. The Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process was set so that four
chains (three heated and one cold) ran simultaneously.
We ran the program for 3,000,000 metropolis-coupled
MCMC generations on each analysis, with tree sampling
every 100 generations and burn-in after 10,000 trees.

Partitioned maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were performed with RAxML ver. 7.0.3 [35], a program implementing a novel, rapid-hill-climbing algorithm. For each
dataset, a rapid bootstrap analysis and search for the bestscoring ML tree were conducted in one single program
run, with the GTR + I + Γ nucleotide substitution model.
The rapid bootstrap analyses were conducted with 1000
replications, with four threads running in parallel.
Statistical evaluation of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses was done using TREE- PUZZLE 5.2 [36], using the twosided Kishino and Hasegawa (KH) [37] test, the Shimodaira and Hasegawa (SH) [38] test, and Bayes factors

[39,40]. We used the GTR + I + Γ model and its parameters
optimized by MrModeltest 2.2.
Divergence time estimation
For the divergence time estimation, multidistribute program [41] was used by assuming a topological relationship thus obtained, but without assuming the molecular
clock (i.e., by allowing heterogeneity in molecular evolutionary rate along branches). Upper and/or lower time
constraints at selected nodes were set for the Bayesian
MCMC processes to estimate divergence times (including
means and 95% credibility ranges) and relative rates at
ingroup nodes. We set the partitioning as described above
and first used PAML [42] to optimize the parameters of
model F84 and the gamma distribution for eight categories to account for site heterogeneity. Estbranches and
multidivtime programs were then used to estimate divergence times. We used 21 fossil-based time constraints
assignable to diverse teleostean lineages (Table 2).

Results and discussion
Mitochondrial genomes of cichlids
We determined complete or nearly complete mtDNA
nucleotide sequences for six new cichlids from Africa,
South America, Madagascar, and Indo/Sri Lanka (Table
1). The sizes of these genomes ranged from 16,457 to
16,556 bp, including approximately 800 bp in the control
region. Tylochromis polylepis alone appears to have a somewhat longer control region (approximately 1200 bp)
although the exact sequence of the region was unable to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/215

be determined because of the long poly-T sequences
within the region. We also analyzed the previously published mitogenomic sequences of four cichlid species
(Table 1). Oreochromis mossambicus (accession no.
AY597335) was not included because a congeneric taxon
(Oreochromis sp.) sequenced by Mabuchi et al. [43] had
already been sampled.
All 37 genes encoding two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 proteins were identified in these 10 cichlid mitogenomes,
basically in the same order and orientation found for
most other vertebrates. Transfer RNA genes could be
folded into secondary structures typical of vertebrate
mitochondrial tRNA [29]. The base composition of cichlid mitogenomes was skewed (data not shown) similarly
to those of other vertebrates [44].
Phylogenetic relationships
Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic relationships inferred
from the Bayesian analysis among the 52 bony fishes, estimated with two sharks as an outgroup. The tree topology
was identical to that obtained by the partitioned ML analysis (data not shown). These bony fish taxa included two
sarcopterygians (coelacanth and lungfish), nine basal
actinopterygians (polypterids, acipenseriforms, lepisosteids, and amiid), and 41 teleosts, including 10 cichlids. The phylogenetic relationships obtained for noncichlid taxa (Fig. 1) were largely consistent with those
from previous mitogenomic studies [28,43,45], except for

a difference in the sister group of holosteans (lepisosteids
and amiid).
Although Inoue et al. [28] suggested that the "Ancient Fish
Clade" unites acipenserids, lepisosteids, and amiid, our
phylogenetic analysis supports the neopterygian clade
(lepisosteids + amiid + teleosts), in agreement with an
analysis of nuclear DNA sequences [46] and morphological characters [47]. Relationships between the basal actinopterygians and teleosts were not stable against changes
in taxonomic representations and the genes used and varied between the two hypotheses (data not shown). We
tentatively assumed the neopterygian relationship for
subsequent analyses because this was consistent in both
morphological and molecular (based on mitochondrial
and nuclear sequences) analyses. However, we also conducted analyses to evaluate how our major conclusions in
dating depend on the two alternative phylogenetic relationships (Table 3).
In terms of the relationships among 20 percomorphs containing 14 labroids (two labrids, two pomacentrids, and
10 cichlids), we reconfirmed the polyphyly of Labroidei
[43] whereby labrids (designated Labroidei 1 in Fig. 1)
and cichlids + pomacentirids (Labroidei 2) appear in separate lineages of teleosts. The non-monophyly of the
labroid taxa was supported by a number of nodes with
100% posterior probability and 100% bootstrap values
(Fig. 1).
Among the 10 cichlid taxa that we used, four were from
Africa, two from South America, three from Madagascar,
and one from Indo/Sri Lanka. The tree (Fig. 1) supports
the monophyly of Cichlidae and two other continental
groups from Africa and South America. Four basal taxa
from Madagascar and Indo/Sri Lanka are not mono-

phyletic, and two (Paretroplus from Madagascar and Etroplus from Indo/Sri Lanka) corresponding to Etroplinae
sensu Sparks and Smith [16] form a sister group to all
other cichlids. The other two Malagasy taxa (Paratilapia
and Ptychochromoides), corresponding to Ptychochrominae sensu Sparks and Smith [16], form a sister group to the
African + Neotropical clade. These results are consistent
with previous molecular studies that used a few mitochondrial or nuclear gene sequences [14-16,48], as well as
morphological studies [13].
However, these previous studies did not fully evaluate the
statistical significance in rejecting alternative hypotheses
of cichlid relationships. We conducted KH and SH tests, as
well as a test using Bayes factor. Based on these tests, alternative hypotheses assuming the monophyly of Malagasy
+ Indo/Sri Lankan cichlids (constraint 1), Old World cichlids (constraint 2), and African + Indo/Sri Lankan cichlids
(constraint 3) are all very unlikely (Table 4). These results
provide statistical support for the paraphyletic assemblage
of the Malagasy + Indo/Sri Lankan taxa to the African +
Neotropical clade.
If Cichlidae originated in Cenozoic Africa and migrated
into South America, Madagascar, and India via saltwater
dispersal [19,49], Malagasy/Indo Sri Lankan and/or Neotropical taxa would probably be nested in the African
clade, and alternative relationships (e.g., those corresponding to constraints 2 and 3) would likely appear.
However, these relationships were not found, thus supporting the vicariant divergence scenario [13,14,18], at
least from a topological standpoint.
Timing of cichlid divergences
We conducted divergence time estimation among 54
bony fishes, including 10 cichlids (Fig. 2). Twenty-one

((((Oreochromis sp.,(Tropheus duboisi, Neolamprologus brichardi)), Tylochromis polylepis),((Etroplus maculatus, Paretroplus maculatus),(Ptychochromoides

Tylochromis polylepis), Etroplus maculatus),((Astronotus ocellatus, Hypselecara temporalis),(Ptychochromoides katria, Paratilapia polleni))), Paretroplus
maculatus).

time constraints based on extensive fossil evidence for
bony fishes (Table 2) were used. Following the advice of
Benton and Donoghue [2] to set fossil-based time constraints as hard lower boundaries and soft upper boundaries, we chose older values for upper boundaries. We
estimated the divergence between African + Neotropical
cichlids and Malagasy + Indo/Sri Lankan (ptychochrominae) cichlids to be approximately 96 MYA (78–115 MYA
at 95% credibility). The divergences of African vs. Neotropical cichlids and Malagasy vs. Indo/Sri Lankan cichlids within the Etroplinae were estimated to be
approximately 89 MYA (72–108 MYA) and 87 MYA (69–
106 MYA), respectively.
We then compared the estimated divergence times among
cichlids and the probable times of continental fragmentation based on geological evidence. The divergence time
between Malagasy and Indo/Sri Lankan taxa within Etroplinae (~87 MYA: 69–106 MYA) is very close to the time of
separation between Madagascar and India (85–95 MYA)
[50,51]. The divergence time estimated between African
and Neotropical clades (~89 MYA: 72–108 MYA) is also
close to the time of separation between African and South
American landmasses (~100 MYA) [50,51]. The divergence time between African + Neotropical cichlids and
Malagasy ptychochrominae cichlids (~96 MYA: 78–115
MYA) appears to be somewhat more recent than the time
generally accepted for the complete separation of the
Indo-Madagascar landmass from Gondwanaland (120–
130 MYA) [50,51]. However, some studies [52] have postulated an extended connection between India and Antarctica by approximately 112 MYA, which is within the
95% credibility range for the African/Neotropical vs. ptychochrominae cichlid divergence. Taken together, these
results are consistent with the vicariant divergence of continental cichlid groups during Cretaceous times and argue
against their Cenozoic dispersal.

Vences et al. [19] calibrated a molecular clock for cichlids
that assumed that the divergence time of the most basal
endemic lineages in East African Rift lakes (e.g., Tanganyika) corresponds to the geological estimate of the age of
the lakes. These estimated divergence times between continental cichlid clades were all in the Cenozoic (rather
than the Mesozoic, as we demonstrate in Fig. 2) and supported the hypothesis of long-distance Cenozoic transmarine dispersal of cichlids. This view of the Cenozoic (or
latest Cretaceous) origin and transmarine dispersal of
cichlids has also been supported by some biogeographers
[49] because it is consistent with cichlid fossil records,
which first occur in South America and Africa in the
Eocene [20,53]. However, the clock-based dating procedures of Vences et al. [19] present some problems. The
strict molecular clock may not hold for all cichlid lineages
[15], and the premise that the oldest endemic cichlid
divergence is synchronized with the formation of the lakes
may not be valid. Some lineages that had diverged outside
the lake may have immigrated in parallel [7]. In addition,
there is no definitive, geologically based time estimate for
the formation of the lakes.
More recently, Genner et al. [7] used two mitochondrial
(cytochrome b and 16S rRNA) and one nuclear (TMO4C4) gene fragments to estimate the divergence times
among cichlids. When the cichlid divergence by Gondwanan vicariance was assumed, the resultant divergence
times were more consistent with those estimated with
time constraints from previous paleontological and
molecular studies [2,54-57] than when the Cenozoic cichlid divergence was assumed based on fossil records.
Although we concur on the Gondwanan origin and vicariant divergence of cichlids, Genner et al. [7] evaluated this
biogeographic hypothesis somewhat indirectly, in that
the fitness of estimated times of cichlid divergences to
those obtained with time constraints from previous studies was qualitatively compared between alternative

Divergence times estimated from the partitioned Bayesian analysis
Divergence times estimated from the partitioned Bayesian analysis. A posterior distribution of divergence times
with 95% credibility intervals (shaded rectangles) was obtained using mitogenomic DNA sequences (10,034 sites). Two sharks
(Scyliorhinus canicula and Mustelus manazo) were used as an outgroup (not shown). The multidistribute program [41] was used
to estimate divergence times assuming the tree topology shown in Fig. 1. Letters indicate nodes at which maximum and/or
minimum time constraints were set (see Table 2 for details of the individual constraints). Paleogeographical maps at 148 MYA,
120 MYA, 95 MYA, and 85 MYA [50] are shown. Dark-gray areas on the maps represent those being fragmented within Gondwanaland at those times.

assumptions on cichlid biogeography. We evaluated cichlid divergence times more directly by using longer mitogenomic sequence data and dozens of non-cichlid taxa,
allowing us to set many time constraints purely from the
paleontological data and providing additional evidence
for an ancient cichlid divergence on Gondwanaland,
despite the general paucity of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic
paleontological record on bony fishes.
Gondwana fragmentation as time constraints
In Figure 3, minimum time constraints based on fossil
records (see Table 2) are plotted against molecular time
estimates of the corresponding divergences (values taken
from Fig. 2). In this figure, minimum age estimates of
Gondwanan fragmentations are also plotted against the
corresponding molecular time estimates of continental
cichlid groups. It should be noted here that the latter data
points reflecting Gondwanan fragmentation history
(closed triangles) are plotted well on the line of 1:1 relationship whereas most of the data points reflecting fossil
records (closed circles) are considerably below the line of
the 1:1 relationship. This pattern suggests that Gondwana
fragmentation history that is congruent with the cichlid
phylogeny can be effective time constraints better than
most of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic fossil records used
here.

Among the fossil data points, four data points in the Paleozoic show a fairly good 1:1 relationship, whereas other
points mostly in the Mesozoic are considerably below the
line of 1:1 relationship. This might mean that the Mesozoic fossils do not really represent the oldest fossil for the
corresponding lineages whereas this is not the case for
older Paleozoic lineages. This situation is somewhat reminiscent of the apparent relative paucity of Mesozoic fossil
evidence of tetrapods (mammals and birds) [58].
Several papers have noticed that molecular time estimations are consistently older than paleontological ones
[2,3,5-7,59]. Benton and Ayala [60] have pointed out four
pervasive biases that make molecular dates too old: i) too
old calibration dates based on previous molecular studies;
ii) undetected fast-evolving genes; iii) ancestral polymorphism that is maintained through long evolutionary
period; and iv) asymmetric distributions of estimated
times, with a constrained younger end but an unconstrained older end (this is caused because rates of evolution are constrained to be nonnegative, but the rates are
unbounded above zero).
The first factor is not the case for the present study,
because we did not use the calibration dates based on previous molecular studies, but used only those based on fossil records. The third factor would be the case when the
used genomic regions are under the long-term balancing

divergence times
Comparison of paleontological and molecular estimates of divergence times. Minimum estimates of divergence times deducible from fossil records (see Table 2) were
plotted as closed circles against molecularly estimated divergence times (mean values for the divergence times shown in
Fig. 2). Closed triangles show plots of the timing of continental breakups against the molecular time estimates of cichlid
divergences between the corresponding continents (data
taken from Fig. 2). The timings used for complete continental
breakups are 112 MYA for (Africa + South America) vs.
(Madagascar + Indo/Sri Lanka), 100 MYA for Africa vs. South
America, and 85 MYA for Madagascar vs. Indo/Sri Lanka [5052]. The solid line indicates a 1:1 relationship between paleontological and molecular time estimates.

selection, but no mitochondrial gene has been reported to
be under such selection. Regarding the second and fourth
factors, we believe that they are also not the case for this
study, because we used mitogenomic sequence data
excluding peculiarly rapid evolving region (e.g., the control region), and because each mitochondrial gene used
here was tested to perform well for dating vertebrate
(tetrapod) divergences [61]. According to Benton and
Ayala [60], for reliable dating "careful choice of genes may
be a more appropriate strategy (than the larger data strategy), with a focus on long and fast-evolving (yet alignable) sequences." Our present study based on nearly whole
mitogenomic sequence data fairly accommodates such
condition.
Improved dating of teleostean divergences
We then conducted the divergence time estimation using
the Gondwanan vicariance assumption regarding cichlids

Divergence times estimated from the partitioned Bayesian analysis using both paleontological time constraints (Table 2) and biogeographical assumptions for the divergences of continental cichlid groups. The added
time constraints on cichlid divergences are as follows: 112 MYA (lower) and 145 MYA (upper) for (Africa + South America) vs.
(Madagascar + Indo/Sri Lanka); 100 MYA (lower) and 120 MYA (upper) for Africa vs. South America; and 85 MYA (lower) and
95 MYA (upper) for Madagascar vs. Indo/Sri Lanka [50-52]. See Fig. 2 legend for other details.

as additional time constraints (Fig. 4). Compared to the
results shown in Figure 2 (without the additional time
constraints), the means of estimated divergence times at
various nodes are similar or somewhat larger (= 18 million years; see Table 3). However, the 95% credibility
ranges of the estimated times overlap well between the
two results, and the differences in mean values are not
large, compared to potential error ranges in other elements, such as stochastic errors in molecular evolution
and errors in dating fossils.
The addition of the cichlid constraints appears to shorten
the 95% credibility intervals of the time estimates, especially for divergences occurring within Acanthomorpha
100–200 MYA. For example, our Figure 2 and Yamanoue
et al. [55] estimated the divergence time of torafugu
(Tetraodontiformes) and medaka (Beloniformes) to be
approximately 159 (136–183) MYA and 184 (154–221)
MYA, respectively. The cichlid constraints considerably
narrowed the 95% credibility interval to 176 (163–191)
MYA (Table 3), and also increased the precision of time
estimates for other nodes. The use of ample molecular
data from mitogenomic sequences also helped to narrow
the credibility interval. For example, Kumazawa et al. [5]
used two mitochondrial genes (NADH dehydrogenase
subunit 2 and cytochrome b) and estimated the divergence between torafugu and zebrafish at 284 ± 28 (mean
± standard deviation) MYA, whereas our whole mitogenomic data set showed the divergence at 288 (268–307)
MYA (Table 3).

Conclusion
We estimated the divergence times of major cichlid lineages as part of the longer evolutionary history of teleostean fishes. Our results and those of a recent molecular
study based on both mitochondrial and nuclear data sets
[7] support a vicariant history of cichlid divergences,
while other researchers [19] have argued for the dispersal
hypothesis. We presented additional strong evidence for
the vicariant hypothesis and propose that the vicariant
assumption can be used to generate time constraints to
date other teleostean divergences in both deeper (100–
300 MYA) and shallower (< 100 MYA) time ranges.
This could be a significant contribution toward the reliable dating of teleostean divergence times in light of the
scarcity of teleostean fossil records in the Mesozoic and
later (see above) and the probable deviation of molecular
evolutionary rates of fishes from those of tetrapods [5,62],
for which molecular evolutionary rates are more reliably
studied using ampler fossil records. A further exploration
of biogeography-based time constraints for other groups
of freshwater fishes that could be reasonably incorporated
into the dating study (e.g. rainbowfishes [63]) would be
