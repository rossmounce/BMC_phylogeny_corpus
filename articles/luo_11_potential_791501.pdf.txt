Abstract
Background: A well-informed choice of genetic locus is central to the efficacy of DNA barcoding. Current DNA
barcoding in animals involves the use of the 5’ half of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene (CO1) to
diagnose and delimit species. However, there is no compelling a priori reason for the exclusive focus on this
region, and it has been shown that it performs poorly for certain animal groups. To explore alternative
mitochondrial barcoding regions, we compared the efficacy of the universal CO1 barcoding region with the other
mitochondrial protein-coding genes in eutherian mammals. Four criteria were used for this comparison: the
number of recovered species, sequence variability within and between species, resolution to taxonomic levels
above that of species, and the degree of mutational saturation.
Results: Based on 1,179 mitochondrial genomes of eutherians, we found that the universal CO1 barcoding region
is a good representative of mitochondrial genes as a whole because the high species-recovery rate (> 90%) was
similar to that of other mitochondrial genes, and there were no significant differences in intra- or interspecific
variability among genes. However, an overlap between intra- and interspecific variability was still problematic for all
mitochondrial genes. Our results also demonstrated that any choice of mitochondrial gene for DNA barcoding
failed to offer significant resolution at higher taxonomic levels.
Conclusions: We suggest that the CO1 barcoding region, the universal DNA barcode, is preferred among the
mitochondrial protein-coding genes as a molecular diagnostic at least for eutherian species identification.
Nevertheless, DNA barcoding with this marker may still be problematic for certain eutherian taxa and our approach
can be used to test potential barcoding loci for such groups.

Background
DNA barcoding is an identification approach that uses
short DNA sequences from a standardized region of the
genome as a molecular diagnostic in species identification. Despite being extremely controversial (e.g., [1-5]),
an increasing number of projects are attempting the
DNA barcoding of diverse eukaryotic species, especially
following the launch of the Consortium for the Barcode
of Life (CBOL) [6] in 2004. An ideal DNA barcode

should allow fast, reliable, automatable, and cost-effective species identification by users with little or no taxonomic experience [7-9]. Identifications are usually made
by comparing unknown sequences against known species DNA barcodes via distance-based tree construction
[7,10,11], alignment searching (e.g., BLAST; [12,13]), or
methods recently proposed such as the characteristic
attribute organization system (CAOS) [14], decision theory [15], and the back-propagation neural network (BPbased species identification) [16].
One of the issues central to the efficacy of DNA barcoding is the selection of a suitable barcode [17]. Interspecific variability in this region should be clearly
greater than intraspecific variability, the so-called “barcoding gap"; a threshold value for the magnitude of

interspecific variation being 10 times that of intraspecific
variation has been proposed as being diagnostic of species-level differences [7,11,17]. Additionally, given that
DNA barcoding aims to identify species efficiently, the
use of a single barcode marker is preferable (cf. the
multi-barcode approach applied in plants [18,19]).
A barcode from the mitochondrial (mt) genome
should represent the most effective single-locus marker
because of it smaller population size relative to the
nuclear genome, which increases the overall concordance between the gene tree and the underlying species
tree [20,21]. Accordingly, there has been considerable
attention on the use of the mt genome as the source of
a barcode locus in animals. The mt genomes of almost
all bilaterian animals contain 13 protein-coding genes
(PCGs) which encode proteins involved in the oxidative
phosphorylation machinery: cytochrome oxidase subunits 1, 2, and 3 (CO1 to CO3); cytochrome b subunit
(CytB), NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1, 2, 3, 4, 4L, 5,
and 6 (ND1 to ND6, ND4L), and ATPase subunits 6
and 8 (ATP6 and ATP8). The mt genome also contains
2 ribosomal RNA genes (16S and 12S) and 22 transfer
RNA genes. One confounding issue with the use of mt
genes in any form of molecular systematics or diagnostics is the widespread nuclear integration of mtDNA
resulting in nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes, or
NUMTs, which could introduce serious ambiguity into
DNA barcoding [22,23]. However, mtDNA still offers
several advantages compared with nuclear DNA: rapid
evolution, limited exposure to recombination, lack of
introns, and high copy number. These characteristics of
mtDNA are important for routine amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and use as a molecular
marker for lower-level questions [7,17,24].
Till now, the most widely used DNA barcode locus for
animal taxa is approximately 650 bp from the 5’ end of
CO1 comprising about 40% of the total gene. Although
CO1 has long been used in animal molecular systematics, initially there was no compelling a priori reason to
focus on this specific gene among the 13 mt PCGs for
DNA barcoding. Indeed, Hebert et al. [7] gave no comparison of the utility of CO1 with other mt genes. In
practice, CO1 has often been used to study relationships
of closely related species or even to study phylogeographic groupings within species because of its high
level of diversity (e.g., [25,26]). However, the CO1 fragment initially chosen for barcoding does have the advantage of being flanked by two highly conserved
“universal” primer sites for PCR [7,27,28], which has
been helpful for automating the collection of DNA barcodes from a diverse range of organisms.
There have been cases in which the universal CO1
DNA barcode has been highly successful in species
identification. For example, an identification rate of

Page 2 of 13

100% was achieved in a study of 260 species of North
American birds [11]. In contrast, a relatively low success
rate (< 70%) was achieved in identifying 449 species of
flies (Diptera), owing to an extensive overlap between
intra- and interspecific variability [29]. Variability
between benthic cnidarian species was found to be very
low, with 94.1% of species pairs showing a < 2% difference in their DNA sequences [30]. CO1 exhibits significant rate variation within plethodontid salamanders,
indicating that genetic distance does not provide a good
indication of the time since speciation in this group
[31]. Finally, Roe and Sperling [28] found that there was
no single optimally informative 600 bp region across the
CO1-CO2 region, and the universal DNA barcoding
region was no better than other regions across these
two genes.
Therefore, it is still necessary to search for alternative
DNA barcodes to avoid an exclusive reliance on CO1.
Given the increasing availability of complete mt genomes from a range of taxa, marker choice is no longer
constrained by the accessibility of universal primers
[31]. Among the mt genes, the 13 PCGs are potentially
better targets for DNA barcoding owing to lower levels
of insertions and deletions (indels), which can complicate the process of sequence alignment [7], than are
found in alignments of ribosomal RNA genes which
have also been proposed as species-level markers
[32,33]. Recently, there have been certain studies that
evaluated no more than 4 already proposed regions as
DNA barcodes for amphibians, primates, birds, and
other groups [33-37], but the majority of the mt PCGs
have never been evaluated for their barcoding utility.
Further, the evaluation of alternative barcode regions
has focused on groups where CO1 has already been
shown to underperform (e.g. [33,34]) rather than test if
any other gene may be superior. This stands in contrast
to the systematic investigations into phylogenetic performance (e.g., [31,38]) or adaptive evolution [39] of most
mt PCGs, and the approach of the fungal barcoding
protocol [40].
We here present a bioinformatics approach to evaluate
the efficacy of each of the 12 mt PCGs (ND6 was
excluded because of its situation on the opposing light
strand and the presence of many indels) along with the
universal CO1 barcoding region as potential DNA barcodes for eutherian mammals. For this major animal
group, there are a large number of mt genomes publicly
available, including multiple samples from many species,
and a well-defined taxonomic system. Our evaluation of
each gene profile includes the following: (1) the number
of barcode species recovered in the neighbour-joining
(NJ) tree, (2) sequence variability within and between
species, (3) resolution to higher taxonomic levels, and
(4) best-fit evolutionary model and DNA saturation.

Results
Similar numbers of recovered barcode species

Table 1 shows the summed numbers of species recovered as monophyletic groups (henceforth referred to as
“barcode species”) in NJ trees under the Kimura-TwoParameter (K2P) model [41]. Although numbers of
potential barcode species varied among the 14 NJ trees
(ranging from 52 for the whole genome to 62 for whole
CO1 and the CO1 barcoding region), species that were
not recovered represented only a small proportion of
the total species, with recovery rates ranging from
91.53% for ND1 to 96.15% for the genome. In each NJ
tree, there were almost always the same four species
that could not be recovered (Bos indicus, Bos taurus,
Chlorocebus pygerythrus, and Ursus arctos). Bos indicus
was recovered as a barcode species only in two trees
derived from profiles of the CO1 barcoding region and
ND4L respectively, and had only one representative
sequence in profiles of the ATP6, ATP8, and the whole
genome. Bos taurus, having more than 130 representative sequences in the 14 profiles, was always clustered
with Bos indicus and Bos javanicus (NC_012706) in the
14 NJ trees, which rendered it non-monophyletic; only a
subset of Bos taurus sequences formed a monophyletic
group. The two sequences of Chlorocebus pygerythrus
did not form a monophyletic group in any of the NJ
trees. The two sequences of Ursus arctos almost always
formed a paraphyletic group with respect to the monophyletic cluster of Ursus maritimus, although both of
them were recovered as barcode species in trees derived
from the ND4 and ATP8 profiles. Other unrecovered

species (Bubalus bubalis, Cervus nippon, and Elephas
maximus) were non-monophyletic in trees derived from
profiles of the CO1 barcoding region, ND1, ATP6, and
ATP8. The recovered barcode species ranged from Acinonyx jubatus represented by two sequences with no
other congeneric species to Canis lupus represented by
more than 250 sequences, to Balaenoptera acutorostrata
with 7 congeneric species as well. Tree files are available
on request.
Homogeneous intra- and interspecific variability

Average K2P distances for each species or genus were
here used to determine whether there were differences
in sequence variability among different genes. For
most species in the 13 gene profiles, average intraspecific distances were less than 3% (with certain exceptions including Ammotragus lervia, Chlorocebus
pygerythrus, and Galeopterus variegatus; Figure 1;
Additional file 1), resulting in similar mean distances
for each of the 13 genes (~1.5%; Figure 2). Average
intraspecific distances for Ursus arctos were often
greater than 2%. An ANOVA-Tukey test showed that
there was no significant difference in the average
intraspecific distances among the 13 different genes
(P = 0.998) or between any gene pair. Average interspecific distances were more than 3% within most genera, with some exceptions including the two genera of
Aotus and Eubalaena for which the K2P distances
were always less than 2.6% or even zero across the
13 gene profiles (Figure 1; Additional file 1). Although the
mean interspecific distances for the 13 genes differed

slightly from each other (ranging from ~7% to ~9%;
Figure 2), there was no significant difference in the
average interspecific distances among the 13 different
genes (P = 0.598) or between any gene pair. As average
intraspecific distances for Bos indicus and Bos taurus

were always less than 0.3%, interspecific distances for
any species pair of Bos indicus, Bos taurus, and Bos
javanicus were generally less than 2% in these gene
profiles, consistent with their non-monophyly in the
NJ species-recovery tests.

For the average K2P distances from the genome profile, mean intra- and interspecific distances were ~1.76%
and ~8.23%, respectively (Figure 2). Distance biases
found for different species or genera were similar to
those in separate gene profiles (Figure 1; Additional file 1).
There were no significant differences between the interor intraspecific distances from the genome profile and
those from any of the 13 gene profiles (all P > 0.99).
With the genus Ursus as an example, Figure 3 and
Additional file 2 show the uncorrected intra- and interspecific distances from sliding-window analyses based
on concatenated genome sequences (see Methods for
details). There are no values for ATP8, ND3, and ND4L
because the lengths of these genes were less than the
window size (600 bp). Variability of intra- and interspecific distances across different gene regions was relatively small, e.g. the extinct species U. spelaeus (red line
in Figure 3), whereas variability among different species
or species pairs was more obvious. Taking the CO1 barcoding region as an example, nucleotide diversities for
the four species ranged from ~0.002 (U. maritimus, purple) to ~0.02 (U. arctos, blue) (Figure 3). For the nucleotide diversity of U. arctos (blue line), clear variability
exists among different gene regions. However, if the universal CO1 barcoding region was taken as the benchmark, there are other regions (CO1, CO2, CO3, CytB,
ND1, ND5) at which U. arctos has similar patterns of
evolutionary distances.
Poor resolution at higher taxonomic levels

The summed numbers of cohesive groups at the genus
level are shown in Table 1. There were more than 20
but fewer than 26 cohesive groups in the 14 NJ trees,

which represented moderate proportions of the potentially cohesive ones (ranging from 61.76% from the CytB
profile to 71.43% from the CO2 profile).
With principal-coordinates (PCOORD) analysis (see
Methods for details), Figure 4 shows the grouping at the
super-ordinal level of the first two significant dimensions for 912 nucleotide and inferred amino acid
sequences of the ND2 profile. Although most sequences
of the super-order Laurasiatheria (green, up-pointing triangle marker) tended to separate from those of the
other three super-orders (Figure 4A, nucleotide
sequences; Figure 4B, amino acid sequences), some clustered with sequences belonging to Euarchontoglires
(grey, down-pointing triangle marker), Xenarthra (blue,
square marker), and Afrotheria (red, circle marker).
None of the super-orders represented by taxon
sequences fell into a completely distinct cluster. With
reference to the eigenvalues, clustering from the first
two dimensions (~28% and ~18% respectively in Figure
4C; ~31% and ~18% respectively in Figure 4D)
accounted for less than 50% of the total distance information. Resolution of the four super-orders with
sequences from the other 12 gene profiles was similar to
or worse than that from the ND2 profile which showed
the highest resolution (see Additional file 3).
Best-fit model and saturation for distant species

For the 13 gene profiles, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as implemented in ModelTest v.3.7 [42,43]
selected the general time-reversible (GTR) model with a
proportion of invariable sites (I) and heterogeneity of
substitution rates among sites (modelled using a gamma
distribution, Г) as their best-fit evolutionary models

(Figure 5). The ATP8 gene was distinct in having a
smaller proportion of invariable sites (0.0877) and less
heterogeneity of substitution rates among its 216 sites
(shape parameter = 0.6648). The GC% ranged from
34.3% in ATP8 to 49.6% in CytB.
A plot of %Ti values against pairwise K2P distances is
shown in Figure 6 for the CO1 barcoding region, with
those representing pairwise distances of zero excluded.
There is no obvious pattern in the %Ti values for nearzero pairwise distances, but as the nucleotide distances
increase above a value of 0.1, %Ti values decrease from
between 0.8 and 1.0 (for pairwise distances of ~0.1) to
between 0.8 and 0.5 (for pairwise distance of ~0.3), indicating saturation for comparisons between genetically
distant species. Other gene profiles (Additional file 4)

gave similar patterns to those found from the CO1 barcoding region, with the exception of ATP8. In the plot
for ATP8 (see Additional file 4A), very low %Ti (~30%)
disappeared when pairwise distances were larger than
0.2, whereas values tended to increase when distances
exceeded 0.7; having been corrected for multiple hits by
the K2P model, distances of some sequence pairs were
larger than 1.

Discussion
Our evaluation of the efficacy of mt genes for animal
barcoding has focused on the mt genomes of eutherians.
This group affords several advantages as a model group
for such an investigation. First, compared with insects
and other invertebrates, the taxonomic system of

eutherians is relatively clear and complete although certain problems still need to be resolved (e.g., [44]). Second, owing to the large number of complete mt
genomes available for this group, we were able to limit
our analysis to putatively orthologous genes [23], eliminating the ambiguity caused by any NUMTs that might
have entered our dataset had we used all the mt gene
sequences available on GenBank. Third, using whole mt
genomes we are able to simultaneously evaluate the utility of 12 PCGs as DNA barcodes (versus 4 in the nextlargest study [34]), while controlling for variation
between individuals because a single genome sequence

was used as the source for each of the 12 evaluated
genes. Fourth, although mtDNA recombination might
occur in certain animals [45,46], it is generally acknowledged that recombination in mtDNA is limited and
maternal inheritance is the norm in mammals. Thus, we
can reasonably expect that all of the mt genes share the
same underlying genealogy, and non-monophyly of species caused by incomplete lineage sorting will affect all
mt genes identically. Taking these various issues into
account, our investigation is essentially a test of the relative evolutionary information of different mt genes.
Finally, while most DNA barcoding studies have focused

on extant species within discrete geographical areas [14],
the mt genomes in this study have been sequenced from
a broad geographical range (Additional file 5). By investigating them we can test DNA barcoding loci on a
worldwide scale. Additionally, some of the analyzed mt
genomes were from extinct species (e.g., Ursus spelaeus;
Additional file 5). In spite of the small number of
included sequences, we are able to provide a preliminary
assessment of the resolution of DNA barcoding for
extinct species.
Universal CO1 barcoding region is representative of
mitochondrial genes

Results from the first two evaluations (i.e., similar recovery rates based on the NJ tree and homogeneous variability within and between species based on K2P
distances) indicate that the 5’ end of CO1, the standard
barcoding region for animals [47], is not only representative of the whole CO1 gene but also the 12 mt PCGs,
despite the fact that gene lengths ranged from 216 bp of
ATP8 to 1,866 bp of ND5. This finding is consistent
with the conclusion of Roe and Sperling [28] that subsections of CO1-CO2 region (~2.3 kb) have similar performance and that none is significantly better than the
others. Min and Hickey [48] showed that the CO1 barcoding region provides a quick preview of mt genome
composition. Our results from the comparisons between
the genome profile and the 13 individual gene regions
indicate that the CO1 barcoding region is also representative of the efficacy of the mt genome as a whole (the
12 PCGs together in our study). In practice, there is
some inconsistency in the specific position and length of
the 5’ end of CO1 used in different barcoding studies
[17], which often vary depending on available primers
and the ability to amplify specific taxa. With additional
results from the sliding-window analyses (Figure 3;
Additional file 2), we provide further insight into this by
demonstrating that any of the 600 bp fragments from
the 5’ end of CO1 had similar evolutionary patterns.
Thus, we suggest that standardization of the exact barcode fragment is necessary only to allow for the automation of barcode collection, not due to the inherent
superiority of any given subregion of CO1.
The high percentage (93.55%; Table 1) of recovered
barcode species and lower mean intraspecific distance
(~1.4%) derived from the profile of CO1 barcoding
region generally suggest that CO1 barcoding region is
an effective molecular marker in the identification of
eutherian species, including extinct species and those
distributed across broad geographical scales (e.g., Mammuthus primigenius and Ursus spelaeus; see Additional
file 5). For species not recovered in the NJ tree and
those with larger intraspecific distances, possible reasons
have been given by Nijman and Aliabadian [37].

Sequenced species of Bos might have undergone hybridization or introgression [49,50]; and our results support
the mitochondrial paraphyly of brown bears (Ursus arctos) with respect to polar bears (Ursus maritimus) as
demonstrated in previous studies [51,52].
Overlap between intra- and interspecific variability

For a DNA barcode to be effective, interspecific differences should be clearly, and preferably significantly,
greater than intraspecific differences [7,17]. On one
hand, with the clear gap between mean intra- and interspeicfic distances (Figure 2), our analyses of variability
within and among species generally confirm the potential of mt genes and the CO1 barcoding region specifically as suitable DNA barcode loci. On the other hand,
intraspecific distances of some species were much larger
than the mean intraspecific distance, while interspecific
distances of some congeneric species were much smaller
than the mean interspecific distance (Figure 1; Additional file 1). Examples include Ammotragus lervia,
Chlorocebus pygerythrus, and Galeopterus variegatus, for
which average intraspecific distances were very high
(greater than 3%). Conversely, interspecific distances for
two species of Aotus were less than 0.7%, extremely low
compared to other barcoding studies. Evolutionary patterns of the three Bos species (B. indicus, B. taurus, and
B. javanicus) reveal that there is no significant difference between intra- and interspecific distances across
the 12 PCGs, which is likely due to hybridization or
introgression as discussed above. Therefore, the problem of overlapping variability does exist in some taxa.
It is notable that the species for which intraspecific distances were larger than or overlapped with interspecific
distances (to congeneric species) tended not to be
recovered in NJ trees (e.g., Bos taurus, Chlorocebus
pygerythrus, and Ursus arctos). Thus, the problem of
overlapping more or less challenges the fundamental
basis of DNA barcoding; moreover, our results suggest
that none of the other mt genes escapes from this problem. Additionally, we did not find any obvious dependence of the average intraspecific distance on the
sample size for each species (Additional file 5; Additional file 6).
While comparing variability within and among species,
distances were calculated under the K2P model. When it
is used to measure pairwise sequence distances, the K2P
model differentiates transitions from transversions [41].
In sliding-window analyses, however, we measured pairwise distance with the average number of nucleotide
substitutions per site, as with the uncorrected pairwise
distance (p-distance) in PAUP* v4.0b10 [53]. This will
lead to some discrepancy between the two values; however, this did not influence our comparison among
genes in separate analyses.

Failure to resolve at high taxonomic levels and DNA
saturation

One of the major criticisms of DNA barcoding is the
species concept that it implements [54]. Considering
that most modern species concepts recognise the complex, dynamic relationships between organisms and
lineages [54], it seems necessary for DNA barcoding to
identify specimens within higher taxonomic groupings
while still focusing on species-level identifications. Certain studies have investigated barcoding in this context
(e.g., [7,35,55]). Our results show that, compared with
the high species-recovery rates of more than 91%, the
14 profiles gave poor resolution at the genus level, with
cohesive groups accounting for less than 72% of the
potentially cohesive ones. With PCOORD, which can
detect grouping of deep branches and has been used in
analyses of virus sequence variation [56], we also evaluated resolution to the level of super-order. The four
super-orders considered in our analysis represent the
major phylogenetic groupings of eutherians. However, in
contrast with other studies that achieved good resolution at the levels of phylum and order based on small
numbers of sequences [7], species cannot be confidently
assigned to the four eutherian super-orders even with
the large number of both nucleotide and amino acid
sequences included in this analysis (Figure 4; Additional
file 3). Thus, our results indicate that DNA barcoding
cannot offer good resolution at higher taxonomic levels
within eutherians. Accurate species identifications will
be dependent upon comprehensive barcode databases,
as sequences from unrepresented species cannot be reliably placed into higher taxonomic groups for which
sequences from other species are available.
The failure of mtDNA barcoding at higher taxonomic
levels is not entirely unexpected, given the likelihood
that the eutherian orders diversified over a relatively
short timeframe. In each gene profile, given that GTR +
I + Г was selected as the best-fit evolutionary model, it
is likely that the routinely used K2P model underestimates the number of multiple substitutions at each variable site [57]. In addition, we found that low %Ti values
disappeared as the nucleotide distance increased. Both
of these signify that phylogenetic information is lost for
distantly related species pairs, eventually resulting in a
misleading signal. We suggest that the low %Ti for
genetic distances near zero (Figure 6; Additional file 4)
can be attributed to the fact that, compared with transversions, transitions would be less obvious if the K2P
model did not correct for the multiple hits hidden
behind transversions for closely related sequence pairs.

Conclusions
With a large number of mt genomes available for
eutherians, our evaluation of the efficacy of DNA

Page 9 of 13

barcoding demonstrates that the 5’ end of CO1, the universal DNA barcode, is a good representative of the mt
PCGs. It suggests that any one of the 12 PCGs (other
than ND6, which was not considered in this study) can
be potentially used as a molecular diagnostic for species
identification. However, considering the criteria in the
CBOL’s data standards and guidelines for locus selection
[18]: universality, sequence quality and coverage, and
discrimination, the universal CO1 barcoding region
should be the first choice among these mt PCGs. Abundant sequence data from this region are already available
for a wide variety of animal species; CO1 sequences can
also be used in phylogenetic research together with
other genes, whereas short genes such as ATP8 would
be less useful because of the greater impact of saturation. Therefore, our conclusion is generally consistent
with that of previous studies in which alternative regions
(e.g., CO1, CytB, 16S) were compared [34,35,37]. Nevertheless, our results confirm that DNA barcoding still
faces the problem of overlap between intra- and interspecific variability for a portion of species in any group.
Our analyses also indicate that mtDNA barcoding cannot offer good resolution at higher taxonomic levels,
and thus the accuracy of species identifications is linked
to the completeness of the DNA barcode database
against which unknown sequences are compared.
We have considered 12 mt PCGs together with the
universal CO1 barcoding region as potential candidates
for DNA barcodes in this study. It is true that each gene
functions as a biological entity with different evolutionary pressures, yet a single short segment such as the 5’
end of CO1 may be sufficient for species identification
in eutherians. Thus, in the future, although we have
analyzed sequence variability of these genes with a 600
bp sliding window, explicit studies of short segments of
mt genes need to be done. Of course, DNA barcoding
does not need to be limited to mt genes. With the
growing availability of sequences from nuclear genes, it
is quite likely that some nuclear markers could be effective DNA barcodes, which should be tested for efficacy
by methods such as ours in the present study. Furthermore, similar studies can be done to understand the
behaviour of potential barcode loci in other large taxonomic groups; at the moment, however, the availability
of whole mt genomes from multiple conspecific specimens is limited in most animal groups.

Methods
Recovery of mitochondrial genomes and aligned proteincoding genes

A total of 1,179 complete or partial mt genomes were
obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) Nucleotide Database with resources
from GenBank, RefSeq, and others [58], holding almost

Luo et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:84
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/84

all currently available (as of September 16, 2009) genome sequences for eutherians except for modern
humans. Owing to the large number of mt genomes for
humans available, only two (NC_012920 and
NC_011137) from RefSeq [59] were used in this study.
Additionally, we downloaded another two for metatherians (Caenolestes fuliginosus NC_005828 and Dactylopsila trivirgata NC_008134) which were used as
outgroups in subsequent tree-based evaluation. Where
the same genome was obtained from multiple databases,
duplicates were culled such that only a single copy was
used in analyses.
We partitioned the genomes into 12 of the 13 PCGs;
the ND6 gene was excluded because of its situation on
the opposing light strand and the presence of many
indels. Gene sequences that were obviously shorter than
most homologous sequences or that contained large
ambiguous regions (continuous strings of N’s) were
removed from each gene profile before alignment.
Sequences were aligned based on the inferred aminoacid sequence using Muscle v3.6 [60] with default parameter settings; stop codons were removed from each
alignment. Details of genome and gene sequences are
shown in Additional file 5.
Aligned sequences that shared accession numbers (i.e.
derived from the same genome sequence) were concatenated in the alphabetic order of gene names, resulting
in 847 sequences plus two outgroups which we term the
“genome profile” for this study. Additionally, the canonical CO1 barcode fragment of 648 bp was obtained from
the 5’end of the CO1 profile, spanning positions 58 to
705 [47]. This region is termed the “CO1 barcoding
region” in this study and is analyzed alongside the 12
gene profiles and the genome profile. Sequence lengths
and the numbers of sequences of the 14 profiles are
shown in Table 1.
Tree-based efficacy of the mitochondrial gene candidates

Prior to tree construction, sequence names were formatted using accession numbers and organism names
(genus and species names), which were generally consistent with the nomenclature and taxonomy in the
Nucleotide Database for each mt genome (see Additional file 5 for taxonomic information). For all 14 profiles, PAUP* v4.0b10 [53] was used to perform
phylogenetic reconstruction using NJ method with the
K2P model [41], which model has routinely been used
in barcoding studies and was recommended by Barrett
and Hebert [55]. We define a species as a recovered
“barcode species” if conspecific sequences, defined by
their taxonomic assignment in the Nucleotide Database,
formed a monophyletic cluster. The number of recovered barcode species was summed for each NJ tree

Page 10 of 13

derived from each profile to give the proportion of total
species that was recovered by each mt gene or genome.
Evolutionary patterns of mitochondrial genes

To study the evolutionary patterns of nucleotide divergence, we compared variability within and between species across the 14 profiles. First, pairwise distances
under the K2P model were calculated by PAUP*
v4.0b10 [53] for conspecific sequences from ~60 species
in each profile (Table 1). As some of these species had
more than two representative sequences, the average of
the pairwise distances was estimated for each species.
Second, for any species that had sequences from multiple conspecific representatives as well as from congeneric species in the profile, we constructed a consensus
sequence for each species using Mesquite v2.6 [61].
Conspecific sequence variability was summarized by
IUPAC codes. Third, after pairwise interspecific K2P
distances for each set of congeneric sequences, among
which some were consensus sequences as described
above, were computed with PAUP* v4.0b10 [53], the
average interspecific distances were estimated for each
of ~35 genera in 14 profiles (Table 1). The “missdist =
infer” option in PAUP* v4.0b10 [53] was used to infer
distances at ambiguous sites by distributing them proportionally to unambiguous changes. Statistical significance of differences in the intra- or interspecific average
distances among different profiles respectively was estimated by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test
using PASW v18 [62].
To visualize genetic variability within and between
species, we performed sliding-window analyses with
DnaSP v5.10 [63,64]. We used the genus Ursus as a special case due to the intensive sequencing efforts on this
genus, with four of its five species represented by at
least two mt genome sequences for each species. Sloth
bear (Melursus ursinus) and sun bear (Helarctos
malayanus) are excluded, although some studies have
classified them into the genus Ursus [65]. For the sake
of convenience, we analysed all 19 of the concatenated
sequences available from the genome profile (Table 2).
Nucleotide diversity (i.e., average pairwise number of
nucleotide substitutions per site) (equation 10.5 of [66];
[64,67]) was used to estimate variability within the four
species except Ursus americanus; nucleotide divergence
(i.e., average number of nucleotide substitutions per site
between two sequences representing different species)
[64,68] was used to assess variability between the 10
species pairs. There was no K2P correction for distances
in DnaSP v5.10 [63,64]. Sliding-window analyses, which
are convenient for graphical visualization, were used
with a window size of 600 bp and a step size of 5 bp following Roe and Sperling [28].

Resolution at higher taxonomic levels

In addition to the species-level resolution with which
DNA barcoding is primarily concerned, we chose to
investigate their efficacy at higher taxonomic levels. For
the 14 NJ trees produced as above, we describe one
genus that had congeneric sequences representing different species (according to their taxonomic assignment in
the Nucleotide Database) as a “cohesive group”, if the
congeneric sequences formed a monophyletic cluster.
The number of cohesive groups was summed for each NJ
tree to finally give a proportion of total genera in Table 1.
We also studied eutherian relationships at the superordinal level, as comprehensive analyses revealed that
there are four subgroups of eutherians: Laurasiatheria,
Euarchontoglires, Xenarthra, and Afrotheria [39,69]
(Additional file 5). Similar to the multidimensional scaling (MDS) used by Hebert et al. [7], principal-coordinates (PCOORD) analysis, which makes it easier to
detect grouping of deep branches with a large data set,
was employed to find low-dimensional representations
of the distance matrix of objects from high-dimensional
space while preserving distances as much as possible
[70,71]. For the 13 gene profiles (the genome profile was
not included), we first used dnadist from the PHYLIP
v3.69 package [72] to calculate pairwise K2P distances,
because of the suitability of the matrix format from dnadist. After transforming the distance matrix into an
equivalent cross-product matrix, we used a program for
PCOORD (written in Python, provided by Dr. DG. Higgins’s laboratory) to plot sequence objects in the three
most significant dimensions, while preserving their pairwise distances. Associated eigenvalues were plotted as
well. Thus, patterns of grouping could be determined by
visual inspection. Similar analyses were done for amino
acids of the 13 gene profiles; Kimura’s distance between
two sequences of amino acids was computed using the
protdist program from the PHYLIP package.
Best-fit evolutionary model and DNA saturation

To understand further the evolutionary characteristics of
the 13 gene profiles, best-fit maximum-likelihood (ML)

Page 11 of 13

model of nucleotide evolution was selected for each
gene profile by comparing values of the BIC in ModelTest v.3.7 [42,43]. Here, 847 sequences in each profile,
sharing accession numbers among 13 profiles, were used
in order to maintain consistency in the sampled individuals. DNA saturation was also analyzed to examine
how saturation accumulates in relation to K2P distance
[28,73]. Since the transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio
can be regarded as an indirect measure of saturation
[28], we employed PAUP* v4.0b10 [53] to compute the
Ti/Tv ratio through pairwise sequence comparison.
Ratios of 358,281 sequence pairs were computed for 847
sequences in each profile. After converting the Ti/Tv
ratio to %Ti, we plotted %Ti values against pairwise K2P
distances to compare patterns of DNA saturation
among the 13 gene profiles. Low %Ti was defined as
being ≦50% (Ti/Tv ≦1) [28].
