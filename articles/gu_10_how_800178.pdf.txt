COMMENTARY

How do miRNAs mediate translational repression?
Commentary

Shuo Gu and Mark A Kay*

Abstract
Micro(mi)RNAs regulate gene expression by what are believed to be related but separate mechanistic processes. The
relative contribution that each process plays, their mechanistic overlap, and the degree by which they regulate
complex genetic networks is still being unraveled. One process by which miRNAs inhibit gene expression occurs
through translational repression. In recent years, there has been a plethora of studies published, which have resulted in
various molecular models of how miRNAs impair translation. At first evaluation, it appears that these models are quite
different and incompatible with one another. In this paper, we focus on possible explanations for the various
interpretations of these data sets, and provide a model that we believe is consistent with many of the observations
published to date.
Background
Since their discovery 16 years ago, the prominent role
that micro(mi)RNAs play as key post-transcriptional regulators of genetic networks is becoming more apparent.
Although significant progress has been made in understanding the biogenesis and biological function of miRNAs [1], the mechanism of how miRNAs inhibit a
particular mRNA is still unclear. Single-stranded mature
miRNAs associate with Argonaute (Ago) proteins to form
the core of a multicomponent gene regulatory complex
named the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).
Guided by the sequence complementarity between the
small RNA and the target mRNA, miRNA-RISC-mediated gene inhibition is commonly divided into three processes: (i) site-specific cleavage, (ii) enhanced mRNA
degradation and (iii) translational inhibition. The first
process is restricted to miRNAs with a perfect or nearperfect match to the target RNA; this is commonly
referred to as RNA interference (RNAi), and in mammals
it is carried out exclusively by Ago2. By contrast, the
other two processes are more commonly associated with
mismatched miRNA/target sequences, which is the most
likely scenario in mammals. The combination of these
two processes is commonly referred to as non-cleavage
repression, and can be carried out by any of the four
mammalian Ago proteins [2]. Interestingly, recent genetic
[3] and biochemical [4] studies have established that

plant miRNAs also induce translational repression on
their target mRNA, despite the near-perfect complementarity between the miRNA and target sequences, indicating that non-cleaving repression may be the default
conserved function of miRNAs in these two kingdoms. It
is not entirely clear if enhanced mRNA degradation and
translational inhibitory events are mutually exclusive or
perhaps more inter-related. Recent evidence suggests that
the two processes are fundamentally independent but
may overlap in some situations. Interestingly, in the presence of miRNAs, some target mRNAs can be exclusively
repressed by non-cleavage degradation or translational
inhibition, but most repression probably occurs by some
combination of the two processes (reviewed in [5]). Some
studies [6,7] using a combination of genome-wide
microarray and proteomic approaches demonstrated that
the majority of miRNA-induced gene repression can be
explained by a reduction in targeted mRNA levels. Nonetheless, because miRNA-mediated translational repression is well documented in numerous studies across
many species and two kingdoms, it is a functionally operative process. However, it is fair to say that the quantitative contribution of miRNA-mediated translational
repression in global post-transcriptional gene regulation
is not resolved.
We focus this commentary on the mechanism(s) of
how miRNAs inhibit mRNAs at the translational level.
This is of interest because there have been a number of
models based on fundamentally strong studies that nonetheless appear to be contradictory. As a result, datadriven examples suggest that the key regulatory blocks

occur at various steps along the translational process. The
rationale behind each model has been reviewed [5,8-11].
We point out the limitations of the various experimental
approaches, and provide a model for translational repression that takes into account the various disparate results.

Translational Repression: Why so many
mechanisms?
Translational inhibition is established when the decrease
in protein product is greater than the observed decrease
in mRNA. Broadly divided, translation can be separated
into three steps: ribosome initiation, elongation and termination. The primary method to establish the step at
which translation is blocked is by measuring the location
of an mRNA across a polysomal sucrose gradient. Early
evidence in C. elegans [12,13], and more recent studies in
mammalian cells [8,14-16] demonstrated that miRNArepressed mRNAs maintained the same mRNA distribution pattern across poly-ribosomes (the polysomal profile) compared with non-repressed mRNAs. These results
led to models of post-initiation inhibition of mRNA
translation, including cotranslation peptide degradation
[16], increased premature termination (ribosomal dropoff ) [15], and impaired elongation [14]. By contrast, other
groups observed that repressed mRNA specifically
shifted to the lighter portion of the sedimentation velocity gradient, indicating less efficient ribosomal loading
and thus miRNA-mediated repression at the translation
initiation step [17-21].
How could such straightforward experiments generate
such contrasting results? Although some of the differences may be due to relatively trivial variation in experimental procedures, other possibilities may be related to
experimental oversights. For example, miRNAs induce
target mRNA destruction in addition to translational
repression [1]. The relative contribution of each of these
inhibitory events will vary between targeted mRNAs. In
some of the studies, the integrity of 'repressed' mRNAs
was not carefully checked. Thus, the shifted reporter
mRNA signals found during gradient sedimentation
might represent partially degraded mRNAs, which dissociates with the translational machinery. In addition, miRNAs generally induce a smaller degree of repression
(around two to three times) compared with site-specific
RNAi-based cleavage. Whether all targeted mRNAs are
partially repressed or a smaller population is fully
repressed is an important distinction, which is still not
resolved. Once this is established, it will have significant
implications for the interpretation of a number of different mechanistic studies.
Another effort to distinguish initiation and post-initiation inhibition relied on testing whether internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES)-containing mRNAs were
resistant to miRNA-mediated repression [22]. Like the

Page 2 of 5

polysomal profile experiments, contradictory results
were reported by different groups. Some studies [15,23]
demonstrated that IRES-initiated translation was still
subject to miRNA-mediated repression, therefore excluding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-cap recognition as a potential target for miRNA function. Other
studies [17,24] concluded that miRNAs inhibit target
mRNA translation at the initiation step. It is important to
note that the IRES-initiated translation is generally much
less efficient than that of m7G-capped mRNAs (1000
times in some cases). This inefficiency may alter translational kinetics, which in turn would have an affect on
miRNA-mediated mRNA translational repression [25].
Finally, the host protein requirements for IRES mediated
translation initiation vary depending on the biological
origin of the IRES sequence. Thus, it is unclear if an
IRES-mRNA is a valid substitute to study 5' cap-mRNA
miRNA-mediated repressive states.
A third line of studies examined reconstituted cell-free
extracts derived from rabbit reticulocytes [26], Drosophila [27] and mammalian cell lines [21,28], which support miRNA-mediated translational inhibition. These
studies showed that the classic m7G 5' cap was required
for repression, suggesting that miRNA-mediated translational inhibition occurred at the initiation step. Furthermore, in the study of Mathonnet et al [21], miRNAmediated inhibition was alleviated by providing an excess
of the eIF4F complex (eIF4E plus eIF4G) in the cell
extracts, further suggesting the initiation step as the primary point of inhibition. However, the poor translational
efficiency of reporter mRNAs in cell extracts, and the
uncertainty about the effective concentration and bioavailability of other cellular factors that might be important in the process is an inherent weakness in such
studies. In addition, because multiple mechanisms are
operative, it is questionable how these reconstituted systems recapitulate the physiological events in vivo, given
the fact that certain in vitro systems require overexpression of protein factors involved in the miRNA pathway
[28].
Another set of important studies focused on novel
methods to study miRNA/target and mRNA/protein
interactions. For example, tethering Ago proteins, the
core of the miRNA effector complex (RISC), to a 3'
untranslated reading frame without an associated
miRNA still induced translational repression [29]. Therefore, it became relevant to further study how the Agos or
Ago-associated proteins interact with translational
machinery. Indeed, Kiriakidou et al. [30] reported that
mammalian Ago2 binds to the m7G-cap directly. This
supports the notion that Ago2 and eIF4E compete for
association with the target mRNA cap structure and thus
prevent effective translation initiation. This model is consistent with the results obtained from cell reconstitution

Gu and Kay Silence 2010, 1:11

studies, and has been widely cited as the key evidence to
support the idea that miRNAs block translational initiation. However, structural studies were not consistent with
the proposed interaction between the cap structure and
the Ago2 MC domain, previously believed to be directly
responsible for the interaction [31]. In addition, other
studies [2,9] provided an alternative explanation for the
role of the Ago MC domain, when it was shown that
Ago2 did not specifically bind to the 5' cap. Instead, the
mutation of two key amino acids in the MC domain,
which were intended to disrupt the cap-Ago2 binding
actually abolished the association of Ago2 and GW182, a
cellular factor known to be crucial for miRNA-mediated
repression (see below). Of note, a recent study proposed
an allosterically regulated 5' cap binding motif within the
Ago MID domain, which upon the association of the Ago
protein and guiding strand/target of RNA duplexes,
inhibits translation at the initiation step [32].
Other studies provide a direct role for eIF6, a protein
factor that prevents the association of ribosomal subunits
[19], as a key mediator in miRNA-mediated translational
repression. Based on the observations that eIF6 was coimmunoprecipitated with miRISC, and that knockdown
of eIF6 resulted in the alleviation of miRNA-mediated
repression in C. elegans, the authors concluded that miRNAs inhibit translation by preventing the joining of 60S
and 40S subunits to make an 80S ribosome. This model
was nicely supported by an acellular reconstitution study
[33] demonstrating that miRNA-repressed mRNAs were
enriched in 40S but not 60S ribosomes. However, these
results were not reproduced in Drosophila S2 cells [9]. In
addition, the involvement of eIF6 in ribosome biogenesis
[34,35] further weakens the original conclusion and indicates the effect of eIF6 on miRNA-mediated repression is
indirect.

The role of GW182 in miRNA-mediated Repression
Several recent studies indicate that GW182 family proteins interact directly with Agos, and are required for
miRNA-mediated gene silencing in C. elegans, Drosophila and mammalian cells [9,36]. As a P-body component, GW182 was originally linked to the miRNA
pathway by various genetic screening and biochemical
studies [9,36]. The observation that GW182 mediated
gene silencing in a pattern similar to that of miRNA,
when artificially tethered to an mRNA reporter without
any miRNA target sequences, clearly demonstrates that
GW182 can function independently from and perhaps
downstream of Agos [9]. GW182 was originally believed
to be responsible for miRNA-mediated non-cleavage degradation of target mRNA by specifically bridging RISC
and deadenylase CCR4-NOT, which caused deadenylation followed by uncapping of target mRNAs [9]. Recent
evidence suggested that miRNA-mediated translational

Page 3 of 5

repression also requires GW182 [9,20]. Therefore, the
interactions between GW182 and the translational
machinery seem to be moving towards providing a more
accurate depiction of the steps involved in translational
silencing. Indeed, recent studies by Fabian et al. [21] and
Zekri et al. [37], despite the discrepancies in details, both
identified poly-A binding protein (PABP) as the factor
specifically associated with GW182 in Drosophila and
mammalian cells. These findings suggest that GW182
may disrupt the association between eIF4G and PABP,
which is required for efficient translation initiation. However, the observation that mRNAs without poly-A tails
are still subject to miRNA-mediated translational repression [9,38] strongly suggests that there are additional
translational repression factors involved besides the
eIF4G-PABP association.
A recent report from Isawaki et al [39] provides more
clues as to why there may be multiple operative mechanisms to induce miRNA-mediated translational repression. Drosophila Ago1 and Ago2 were reported to
mediate target gene repression through distinct mechanisms. Whereas Ago1 elicits deadenylation and in turn
target mRNA degradation through GW182, Ago2
induces translational repression independent of GW182
by association with eIF4E, disrupting the eIF4E-eIF4G
interaction, which is essential for efficient translation.
Although these results may explain some of the discrepant results in the fly, it is still far from solving the issue in
mammals. Mammalian argonaute proteins (Ago1 to
Ago4) are structurally, phylogenetically and functionally
similar to Drosophila Ago1, but not Ago2.

Conclusion: Our model
How can we reconcile the multiple proposed mechanisms with the finding that GW182 plays a key role in
miRNA-mediated translational repression? It is possible
that the interaction between GW182 and one of the Agos
is the primary event leading to the activation of several
pathways. A model is presented in Figure 1. In this model,
Agos do not directly mediate repression, but rather function together with loaded miRNA guiding strands, which
function as an adaptor to dock GW182 to target mRNAs.
The N-terminal portion of GW182 specifically associates
with the Ago protein and mediates gene repression
through an interaction between its C-terminal and the
various downstream factors. The final type and level of
repression is a sum of the results from multiple pathways.
Which pathway(s) dominate for a specific mRNA will
depend on the specific Ago protein, and on cis (such as
components of mRNA-ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex) and trans factors. Supporting this idea, Kong et al.
[40] reported that the mechanism of miRNA-mediated
repression might depend on the promoter used for driving the target mRNA expression. These authors proposed

Figure 1 Model for miRNA-mediated repression. The interaction between GW182 and any of the Ago proteins is the first event of or occurs during
micro(mi)RNA-target interaction. Several different pathways downstream of GW182 are possible. The specific pathway is probably determined by the
composition of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and interaction with mRNA-ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex), microRNA-associated ribonucleoproteins (miRNPs), or cellular factors. (a) GW182 mediates deadenylation, followed by de-capping and mRNA degradation via NOT/CCR4/
CAF1 complexes; this is the primary non-cleaving degradation pathway and considered separate from the translational repression pathway. (b)
GW182 competes with eIF4G in association with poly-A binding protein (PABP), preventing the circularization required for efficient translation. (c) The
60S ribosome is prevented from joining with the 40S ribosome to form 80S ribosomes. Steps (b) and (c) represent initiation blocks. (d) Slowed or
stalled ribosomes along the mRNA, representing a translation elongation block. (e) Premature translation termination and (f) co-translation degradation.

that different promoters result in a distinct set of mRNPs
on reporter mRNA, which in turn determine the type of
translational repression mechanism. It will be of great
interest to identify these other factors and establish their
roles in regulating miRNA-mediated non-cleavage
repression.
Returning to the model in Figure 1, it is likely that
translational inhibition and enhanced mRNA degradation are uncoupled processes with the relative participation of each for a particular mRNA-miRNA defined by
the differences in the protein-RNA interactions. For
example, the relative degree of repression dictated by
degradation (Figure 1, process (a)) versus translational
inhibition (processes (b) to (f )) will be related to the proportion of specific complexes that form for a particular
population of mRNAs. Understanding the rate-limiting
processes in the formation of such complexes is likely to
be the key to a better understanding of post-transcriptional gene regulation.
Nevertheless, it is likely that even within the process of
translational inhibition, the mechanism is much more
finely regulated than originally anticipated. The fact that
there are many studies supporting translational inhibition

at each of the three defined levels of translational inhibition (initiation, elongation and termination) suggest that
during repression all three are coordinately stalled or
slowed (see Figure 1, processed (b) to (f )). This single
model is consistent with the finding that miRNA-mediated repressed mRNAs have the same average polysomal
distribution compared with those that are not repressed.
However, it is possible that a one or more process(es) (for
example, Figure 1, process (b) to (f )) predominate for specific mRNA-RISC complexes. Together, this model takes
into account the various differences reported by various
investigators.
A wider question is: why are there multiple processes
for miRNA-mediated gene silencing? Is there an advantage for some mRNAs to be slowed or stalled on polysomes so that their product levels can be quickly turned
up or down? Conceivably this might allow more precise
regulation compared with mRNA destruction. Multiple
approaches including elucidating the molecular events
will be contributory to our understanding of this complex
set of regulatory processes that seems to be required for
such precision in controlling gene expression.
