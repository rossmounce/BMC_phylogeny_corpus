Abstract
Background: Recent advances in the field of metabolic engineering have been expedited by the availability of
genome sequences and metabolic modelling approaches. The complete sequencing of the C. reinhardtii genome
has made this unicellular alga a good candidate for metabolic engineering studies; however, the annotation of the
relevant genes has not been validated and the much-needed metabolic ORFeome is currently unavailable. We
describe our efforts on the functional annotation of the ORF models released by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI),
prediction of their subcellular localizations, and experimental verification of their structural annotation at the
genome scale.
Results: We assigned enzymatic functions to the translated JGI ORF models of C. reinhardtii by reciprocal BLAST
searches of the putative proteome against the UniProt and AraCyc enzyme databases. The best match for each
translated ORF was identified and the EC numbers were transferred onto the ORF models. Enzymatic functional
assignment was extended to the paralogs of the ORFs by clustering ORFs using BLASTCLUST.
In total, we assigned 911 enzymatic functions, including 886 EC numbers, to 1,427 transcripts. We further
annotated the enzymatic ORFs by prediction of their subcellular localization. The majority of the ORFs are
predicted to be compartmentalized in the cytosol and chloroplast. We verified the structure of the metabolismrelated ORF models by reverse transcription-PCR of the functionally annotated ORFs. Following amplification and
cloning, we carried out 454FLX and Sanger sequencing of the ORFs. Based on alignment of the 454FLX reads to
the ORF predicted sequences, we obtained more than 90% coverage for more than 80% of the ORFs. In total,
1,087 ORF models were verified by 454 and Sanger sequencing methods. We obtained expression evidence for
98% of the metabolic ORFs in the algal cells grown under constant light in the presence of acetate.
Conclusions: We functionally annotated approximately 1,400 JGI predicted metabolic ORFs that can facilitate the
reconstruction and refinement of a genome-scale metabolic network. The unveiling of the metabolic potential of
this organism, along with structural verification of the relevant ORFs, facilitates the selection of metabolic
engineering targets with applications in bioenergy and biopharmaceuticals. The ORF clones are a resource for
downstream studies.

Background
Recent advances in sequencing genomes of prokaryotes
and eukaryotes [1] and the explosion of the development and use of genome-scale metabolic network
reconstructions [2] are expected to facilitate the selection of targets for metabolic engineering [3,4]] . The
unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has
been an attractive organism for exploration of metabolic
engineering hypotheses due to its capability to flexibly
regulate alternative biochemical pathways to produce
biofuels [6-9]. However, the optimal selection of the
enzymatic targets has been so far hindered by the lack
of a comprehensive knowledge of the encoded genes
that carry out the metabolic activities of the organism.
Although the released genome sequence of C. renihardtii by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) [10] provided the
needed resource to predict nearly 17,000 genes in this
organism, it alone does not reveal the underlying principles of metabolic network function, nor does it disclose
the functions of the predicted “parts-list” of the organism. To define genes and map their products to function, computational algorithms have been extensively
applied to annotate the accumulated genomic data from
many organisms including C. reinhartii[11,12]. Most of
these approaches are unable to predict the transcript
structures precisely and accurately in a uniform manner
due to 1) the incompleteness of the EST data, 2) the
lack of comparative genomic information, particularly in
less widely studied species, and 3) the complexity of the
rules governing transcription initiation, termination and
splicing events. Even for the well-studied nematode C.
elegans, for which a high quality genome sequence has
been available for over 10 years, inconsistencies still
remain in defining the ORF structures [13,14]]. Previous
large-scale studies on C. reinhardtii, have included
microarray [15,16]], proteomics [17], and, more recently,
RNAseq experiments [18] which have provided valuable
expression data based on earlier releases of JGI annotations. Currently, the JGI v4.0 predicted C. reinhardtii
ORFeome remains for the most part unverified; therefore, the functional annotation and experimental structural verification of the encoded ORFs are urgently
needed prior to use in functional studies including
metabolic engineering experiments.
We previously reported the functional annotation of
the gene products involved in central metabolism of C.
reinhardtii using JGI v3.0 gene models [19] in which we
improved the existing functional and structural annotations of the ORF models. In the re-evaluation of the
central metabolic ORFs, for which the ORFs are generally the best characterized in the proteome, we observed
that as much as 10% of the ORFs were annotated with
structuralerrors. The errors included incorrect 5’ or 3’

boundary annotations, which we identified through
RACE [19].
In this study, we computationally assigned enzyme
functions to the predicted and newly released JGI v4.0
protein-coding ORF models and targeted the enzymatic
ORFeome for structural verification. Our results, in
addition to structural verification, provide expression
evidence for the enzymatic gene products, predict their
subcellular localization, and identify the ORF models
that may need to be re-annotated.

Results and discussion
Functional annotation of JGI v4.0 transcripts

We used the new JGI “filtered transcript models”
released through the JGI portal (http://genome.jgi-psf.
org/Chlre4/Chlre4.home.html) for both functional
assignments and structural annotation verifications.
Enzymatic functional assignments to the C. reinhardtii
ORFs were made by associating Enzyme Commission
(EC) numbers through reciprocal BLAST searches
against the UniProt enzyme database [20] (http://www.
uniprot.org/, with over 100,000 protein entries) (Figure
1A) supplemented with AraCyc database entries [21] .
The best match for each translated ORF was identified
(with an e-value threshold of 10-3) and the EC number
from the UniProt best match (or enzyme annotation
from AraCyc) was transferred on to the JGI predicted
ORF. We extended the EC assignments to the respective
paralogs of the ORFs by clustering ORFs for the JGI filtered models. Altogether, we were able to assign 886 EC
numbers to 1,427 JGI ORFs (Figure 1B, Additional file
1). KEGG currently provides 603 enzymatic annotations
for the JGI v4.0 transcripts, of which there are 441
shared with our annotation. Theassignments given in
this study provide an additional 445 EC numbers not
present in KEGG. The list of the enzymatic JGI v4.0
gene models with their assigned EC numbers are provided in Additional file 1.
In order to provide additional functional information,
WoLF PSORT [22] was implemented to assign subcellular localizations to each translated JGI v4.0 enzymatic
ORF. WoLF PSORT is a high-performance localization
prediction algorithm evolved from PSORT [23] , PSORT
II [24] and iPSORT [25]; it combines localization features from these algorithms together with amino acid
composition in a weighted k-nearest neighbors framework. Based on the cross-validation results, WoLF
PSORT makes reliable predictions for nucleus, mitochondria, cytosol, plasma membrane, extracellular and
(in plants) chloroplast. For other subcellular compartments, the performance is not as good, but still informative [22] . Compared to other methods, WoLF PSORT
has been shown to have good performance for most

Figure 1 Functional annotation of C. reinhardtii JGI v4.0 translated ORFs. Enzymatic functions were assigned to the JGI v4.0 translated ORFs
by comparing the sequences with the UniProt and AraCyc enzyme databases. The computational pipeline (A) entailed transfer of enzyme
annotation to JGI ORFs identified through reciprocal BLAST, then establishing paralog groups to extend enzyme annotation to paralogs. Our
functional annotation identified 886 EC numbers, of which only ~50% are currently annotated by KEGG (B).

subcellular localizations [26]. Importantly, predictions
are not made on the basis of signal sequences that can
introduce vulnerability to errors in sequence and/or
annotations on the 5’ end of the gene [27]. Furthermore,
due to the unique phylogenetic position of C. reinhardtii
and a lack of extensive GO annotation, alternative methods such as MultiLoc2 [28], which use GO annotation
for refinement of predictions, would not be applicable
here.
The results (Additional file 2) are presented as the
number of nearest neighbors in different subcellular
compartments for each protein. The default value for
the total number of nearest neighbors (i.e., k) is 32.
Even though C. reinhardtii is in the plant lineage, it has
retained key animal genes [10] and is a unicellular
organism that shares ancestry at the branching point of
plants and animals. We therefore performed two WoLF
PSORT runs in which C. reinhardtii was considered
either as a plant or animal. Because C. reinhardtii is closer to plants than animals [10], predictions made when
considering it as a plant are likely to be more accurate.
However, because WoLF PSORT uses homology to
known proteins, and some C. reinhardtii proteins may
be closer to those in animals than plants [10], the predictions assuming an animal lineage provide alternative
assignments, particularly for cases where ambiguous
predictions are made for the proteins assuming plant
origins. To summarize the obtained results (Fig. 2), we
have binned the encoded proteins based on the assigned
probability values for each protein, such that, if more
than 50% of the nearest neighbors of the protein belong
to a given compartment, that protein is assigned to a

single compartment as its primary localization site. In
cases where different localization predictions made
based on animal and plant assumptions both meet an
85% cutoff, we took the higher confidence prediction as
the final localization assignment (Additional file 3).
Using this integration scheme, the largest compartment
is the chloroplast when C. reinhardtii is considered a
plant, and the second largest is the mitochondrion (Fig.
2C). These localization predictions agree with the fact
that these genes are all related to metabolism. To verify
the performance of our predictions, we manually
curated a number of experimentally derived C. reinhardtii subcellular protein localizations recently reported by
Weinkoop et al.[29]. Due to the limited number of localizations that could be transferred to v4.0 annotations
from this study, we were only able to evaluate 9 ORFs
in our set. Our predicted localizations of all 9 ORFs
agreed with the experimentally determined localizations.
Although the number is too small for adequate statistical analysis, it still shows the high quality of the
predictions.
Experimental verification of C. reinhardtii enzymatic
ORFeome

Our EC annotation of the JGI v4.0 transcript models
identified 1,427 predicted transcripts with putative enzymatic functions. To experimentally verify structural
annotation of the enzymatic ORFs, we carried out targeted transcriptome sequencing experiments after we
amplified the ORFs by reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR) (Figure 3A). The generated amplicons were
sequenced using the 454FLX platform before and after

Figure 2 Subcellular localization prediction of JGI v4.0 enzymes. Following enzyme classification assignments to JGI v4.0 translated ORFs,
subcellular localization of the proteins were predicted by WoLF PSORT [22] as plant (A) or animal (B) proteins. Based on the obtained probability
values, each protein was assigned a compartment when 50% or higher percentage of the nearest neighbors for the protein belonged to a given
compartment. When the 50% threshold is not reached, the protein, or its encoding ORF are assigned to “other” category to designate multiple
compartments or ambiguous predictions. In (C), the predictions made as animal and plant were consolidated into a single set by increasing the
threshold to 85%, then reporting the predicted assignment with the higher value. Abbreviations are: Chlo: chloroplast, Cyto: cytosol, Cysk:

sequences of the clones were further verified by conventional Sanger sequencing.
In order to perform the verification experiments, we

cloned, then sequenced by 454. (A) Amplification of representative metabolic ORFs are shown after electrophoresis (192 amplicons analyzed in

amplification, we carried out next generation sequencing
(using the 454FLX platform) of the amplicons. The
obtained 454 reads were then aligned to the JGI v4.0
ORF reference sequences to assess annotation accuracy.
The aligned ORFs were binned according to their percent coverage; i.e., based on the percentage of the entire
length of the ORF reference sequence that could be covered by the contigs assembled from the 454 reads.
For 78% of the JGI v4.0 ORF reference sequences, the
454 reads provided 95-100% coverage (Fig. 3B; Additional file 1), of this set approximately 92% had a coverage rate of 99-100%, demonstrating high verification
rates. Approximately 10% of the ORF models showed
coverage of 50-95%. The remaining 12% were covered
less than 50% and of this set, 7% of the ORF models
had less than 20% of their length verified by 454-reads.
As an alternative method of verifying the ORFs, we
end-sequenced the cloned PCR products by conventional high-throughput Sanger sequencing. From 1,427
JGI v4.0 ORFs tested, we were able to obtain 661 ORF
sequence tags (OSTs) that were aligned to the 5’ end of
the ORF models, and 631 OSTs that could be aligned to
the 3’ ends. Altogether, 42% (602) ORFs had OSTs that
verified both ends of the ORF models. We could assemble full-length contigs for 242 ORFs (Additional file 1).
Overall, we obtained expression evidence for 1,401 of
1,427 ORF models with assigned enzymatic functions
based on targeted transcriptome sequencing results and
sequencing of the clones, though clearly not all of these
ORF models can be considered verified. We consider an
ORF model to be verified if 98 to 100% of its reference
sequence could be covered by 454-reads, or if a fulllength contig generated from Sanger sequencing of an
obtained clone completely matched the reference
sequence. For 73% of the ORF models, the 454-reads
give confirmation at the 98-100% level. Sanger sequencing of the clones could verify an additional 36 ORF
models (for which we could assemble contigs using 3’
and 5’ end reads). These models can therefore be considered verified, though it should be noted that even
100% coverage of an ORF model does not exclude the
possibility of the presence of exons that were not annotated. The high coverage rates do, however, guarantee
that the annotated exons are expressed. Furthermore,
incomplete coverage by 454-reads does not necessarily
imply inaccurate annotation; in some cases, less than
100% coverage could be the result of low expression
level of the transcript and consequently low sequencing
depth. We note that due to the amplification of the
transcripts, the targeted transcriptome method that we
have used is expected to normalize the abundance of
the amplicons to a degree.
While end verification by Sanger sequencing can confidently verify the 5’ and 3’ ends, this method provides

Page 5 of 9

no information on the internal exon structure of long
ORFs (unless internal primer walking [30] is carried
out). We also find that the overall success rate of
sequencing clones using the Sanger method is significantly lower than the 454 sequencing of amplicons.
Cloning bottlenecks, failure to generate contigs due to
end reads not covering the internal segments, and random sequencing failures could be among the contributing factors. Direct sequencing of amplicons through 454
or other parallel sequencing methods clearly bypasses
these limitations.

Conclusions
A central challenge in the post-genomic era is the mapping of the genotype-phenotype relationship. For biochemical networks, the functional connections between
genotype and phenotype are deciphered through the use
of the available high-throughput experimental and computational platforms. Each technology can be used to
generate a vast amount of data particular to some
aspects of a given biochemical network. Ultimately the
gathered data could be used to manipulate the biochemical systems for biotechnological and medical purposes.
However, such efforts rest upon the availability of accurate structural and functional annotations, as well as the
availability of the biological resources, such as ORF
clones. In this study, we have carried out both computational functional annotation and direct experimental
verification of structural annotations of JGI v4.0 enzymatic ORFs, which include both metabolic and nonmetabolic enzymes. We carried out targeted amplification of the ORFs by RT-PCR and sequenced the products (before and after the cloning) to verify the ORF
structures. The approach of using targeted amplification
of ORFs offers several advantages over other highthroughput approaches that are not targeted; importantly, it establishes the cis-connectivity between the 5’
and 3’ ends of the ORF. Such cis-connectivity cannot be
established from whole transcriptome sequencing, tiling
array analysis or other high-throughput transcriptome
survey methodologies (e.g., [18,31-34]). In addition, the
generated amplicons can be cloned, as we have done so
here, to provide reagents for downstream large- or
small-scale experiments, which can be used to define
genotype to phenotype maps as well as accomplishing
bio-engineering tasks. With an ever-increasing number
of organisms whose genome sequences are becoming
available (e.g., the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum
[35], the algae Ostreococcus Sp. [36] and Volvox carteri
[37]), the need for structural and functional annotation
and their verification is clear. The approach and experiments carried out in this study can be readily extended
to other species to facilitate functional annotation and
structural verification of their gene models.

Methods

C. reinhardtii strain and growth condition

Enzyme annotation of JGI v4 Proteome

C. reinhardtii strain CC-503 was used for our experiments. C. reinhardtii cells were grown in Tris-acetatephosphate (TAP) medium containing 100 mg l-1 carbamicillin without agitation, at room temperature (22–25 °
C) and under continuous illumination with cool white
light at a photosynthetic photon flux of 60 μmol m-2 s-1.

We assigned Enzyme classification (EC) to the translated JGI v4.0 filtered ORF models (Chlre4_best_transcripts and Chlre4_best_proteins) using UniProt [20]
and AraCyc [21] enzyme protein sequences and their
EC annotations as the basis. The transfer of enzyme
annotations to ORF models involved two main steps:
(1) Carrying out and deciphering reciprocal best-hits, if
any, for each of the translated JGI ORF models to the
UniProt and AraCyc sequences, then transferring the
EC from the best-hits UniProt/AraCyc sequences to
the corresponding ORF models. This transfer was done
using BLASTP with an e-value threshold 0.001
[38,39]]; (2) Identification of paralogs, in the entire collection of translated JGI models, of already EC
assigned translated ORF models and then transferring
their EC annotations to their paralogs as well. This
transfer was done using BLASTCLUST (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/C_DOC/lxr/source/doc/
blast/blastclust.html) with a sequence identity cut-off
of 35% and length cut-off of 70%. BLASTCLUST can
cluster protein sequences (using BLAST) systematically
through pair wise alignments when statistically significant matches are found. Importantly, BLASTCLUST
uses “single-linkage” clustering, which allows linkage of
clusters through their “best matching” components.
This aspect of the algorithm allows for clustering of
sequences, which otherwise may lie below a set similarity threshold among themselves, but are linked
through a sequence that has an above threshold
similarity.
Subcellular localization predictions

WoLF PSORT [22] was used to assign subcellular localizations to each translated JGI v4.0 enzymatic ORFs.
The output for each ORF provides the number of
nearest neighbors in different subcellular compartments for each protein. The default value for total
number of nearest neighbors (i.e., k) is 32. For each
protein, the result can be transformed into a probability model:
P (c i ) =

N (c i )
m

∑ N (c )
i

i =1

where ci is the ith subcellular compartment; N(ci) is
the number of nearest neighbors the protein has for the
ith subcellular compartment, and m is the total number
of subcellular compartments predicted for the protein.
We carried out the localization assignments of C. reinhardtii ORFs considering it as a plant and animal.

RNA isolation and quality assessment

Total RNA was isolated from C. reinhardtii cells grown
in TAP medium and under constant light. Cells from
mid-log phase were collected by centrifugation at 2,000
rpm (650g) for 10 min. Total RNA was isolated using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The quality of the isolated
RNA was improved by digesting the remainder of the
cellular DNA using 0.08 U µl -1 RNase-free DNase I
enzyme (Ambion). The integrity and quality of the total
RNA was assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent)
using RNA pico 6000 kit and by following the manufacturer’s instruction. The fraction of RNA with RNA
Integrity Number (RIN) of more than 7.5 was used for
cDNA synthesis. The concentration of the RNA was
measured spectrophotometrically.
Structural verification of the JGI v4.0 transcripts: Reverse
transcription-PCR of the metabolic ORFs

The annotated metabolic ORFs were subjected to
reverse transcription followed by PCR to verify their
predicted sequences. Reverse transcription of RNA was
carried out using Superscript III reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions
using random N6 and dT(16) (Ambion) as universal primers. The reaction mixture contained 1.2 M betaine
(Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent premature terminations
owing to the high G+C content of the C. renhardtii
transcriptome. The synthesized cDNAs were used as
templates in PCR reactions. ORF-specific primers tailed
with Gateway compatible sequences were designed automatically using the OSP program [40] The forward primer starts from nucleotide A of the ATG start codon
and was flanked with the Gateway B1.1 sequence at its
5’ end. The reverse primer starts from the codon immediately before the termination codon and carried the
Gateway B2.1 sequence at its 5’ end. All primers had a
melting temperature (Tm) between 55 °C and 65 °C.
KOD hot start DNA polymerase (Novagen) catalyzed
the amplification of ~1,430 ORFs individually in separate 50 µl reaction mixtures containing 1.2 M betaine
and 0.25 µg/µl cDNA.
Gateway cloning of the metabolic ORFs, their
transformation and amplicon generation for sequencing

The generated amplicons were recombinationally cloned
into the pDONR223 Gateway vector to generate Entry

Ghamsari et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12(Suppl 1):S4
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/S1/S4

clones [41]. The recombinational cloning was performed
using BP clonase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The Entry clones were subsequently
transformed into chemically competent E. coli DH5a.
The positive transformants were selected and grown in
96-well format plates containing LB and 100 mg/l spectinomycin. Following growth in liquid media, the transformed bacteria were used as a source of template in
PCR reactions containing 1.2 M betaine and KOD hot
start DNA polymerase (Novagen) to amplify the clones.
Vector primers were used to generate the final DNA
templates for sequencing.
Generation of ORF sequence tags (OSTs) by Sanger
sequencing

PCR products were sequenced bi-directionally using
conventional automated cycle sequencing to generate
ORF sequence tags (OSTs) [42]. Sequencing was carried
out by Agencourt Bioscience Corp.
Forward and reverse sequences were vector-clipped
(using Cross_match, http://www.phrap.org/phredphrap/
general.html), then assembled. We used Phrap (http://
www.phrap.org/) to assemble the forward and reverse
sequences. Both assembled contigs and singlets were
aligned against the coding sequences (CDSs) of corresponding predicted transcripts from C. reinhardtii
assembly v4.0 (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Chlre4/Chlre4.
home.html) using MUSCLE [43,44]]. The alignment files
were then used to verify the CDSs of the predicted transcripts. An ORF model was considered verified if a contig could be assembled from both end reads and if the
contig verifies the predicted sequence.

libraries were then purified and used to set up emulsion
PCR reactions according to the manufacturer’s instruction (454 Life Sciences Corp., Roche). After the amplification step, the emulsions were chemically broken and
the beads carrying the amplified DNA library were
recovered and enriched. The sequencing was performed
on the Roche 454 Genome Sequencer Instrument with
the GS FLX Titanium Sequencing Kit XLR70. Approximately 800,000 DNA-carrying beads along with enzyme
and packing beads were loaded onto a PicoTitrePlate
device. The sequencing was operated and monitored for
~9 hrs during which 200 flow cycles were completed.
The generated data were processed using the GS FLX
data analysis software v2.3. The vector sequences and
Gateway tail sequences were trimmed from the raw
reads and the reads shorter than 20 nt were filtered out.
The trimmed and filtered reads were aligned against JGI
v4.0 reference sequences using the GS Reference Mapper application (gsMapper v2.3). A minimum overlap
length of 40 nt and minimum overlap identity of 90%
were used to align the reads against the JGI v4.0 reference sequences. An ORF model was called verified if
more than 98% of its entire length was covered by
(matched to) the assembled contigs from the 454 reads.

Additional material
Additional File 1: JGIv4.0 gene model names, their predicted
sequence, EC annotation, and verification status of their structural
annotation.
Additional File 2: Subcellular localization prediction of JGI v4.0
enzymes predicted by WoLF PSORT as plant or animal proteins.
Additional File 3: A consolidated set of high confidence subcellular
localization predictions made by WoLF PSORT. Subcellular
compartments predicted for JGI v4.0 as plant or animal at 0.85 or
higher ratio relative to other compartments were selected then
consolidated by reporting the prediction with the higher value.

ORF model verification by 454FLX sequencing

The generated ORF amplicons were sequenced using
the 454FLX Titanium sequencing system (454 Life
Sciences Corp., Roche). For targeted transcriptome
sequencing, the amplicons generated in RT-PCR reactions were pooled in equimolar ratios. For verification of
cloned ORFs, the PCR products of the entry clones
were pooled in equimolar quantities. The resulting
mixes were partially purified using Qiagen MinElute
PCR purification kit following the manufacturer’s
instruction. Five micrograms of DNA from each sample
was subjected to nebulization for 90 seconds under
nitrogen gas pressure of 30 psi(2.1 bar). After purification of the sheared DNA using the MinElute PCR purification kit, the DNA fragments were size-selected using
AMPure beads (Agencourt). DNA fragments with the
size range of 300-800 bp were end repaired and the
adaptors were ligated to the ends. After melting into
single stranded DNA molecules, the quality of the DNA
library was assessed on a BioAnalyzer RNA Pico 6000
LabChip (Agilent). The resulting single stranded DNA
