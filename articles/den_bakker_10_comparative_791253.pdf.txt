Abstract
Background: The bacterial genus Listeria contains pathogenic and non-pathogenic species, including the
pathogens L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii, both of which carry homologous virulence gene clusters such as the
prfA cluster and clusters of internalin genes. Initial evidence for multiple deletions of the prfA cluster during the
evolution of Listeria indicates that this genus provides an interesting model for studying the evolution of virulence
and also presents practical challenges with regard to definition of pathogenic strains.
Results: To better understand genome evolution and evolution of virulence characteristics in Listeria, we used a next
generation sequencing approach to generate draft genomes for seven strains representing Listeria species or clades
for which genome sequences were not available. Comparative analyses of these draft genomes and six publicly
available genomes, which together represent the main Listeria species, showed evidence for (i) a pangenome with
2,032 core and 2,918 accessory genes identified to date, (ii) a critical role of gene loss events in transition of Listeria
species from facultative pathogen to saprotroph, even though a consistent pattern of gene loss seemed to be
absent, and a number of isolates representing non-pathogenic species still carried some virulence associated genes,
and (iii) divergence of modern pathogenic and non-pathogenic Listeria species and strains, most likely circa 47
million years ago, from a pathogenic common ancestor that contained key virulence genes.
Conclusions: Genome evolution in Listeria involved limited gene loss and acquisition as supported by (i) a
relatively high coverage of the predicted pan-genome by the observed pan-genome, (ii) conserved genome size
(between 2.8 and 3.2 Mb), and (iii) a highly syntenic genome. Limited gene loss in Listeria did include loss of
virulence associated genes, likely associated with multiple transitions to a saprotrophic lifestyle. The genus Listeria
thus provides an example of a group of bacteria that appears to evolve through a loss of virulence rather than
acquisition of virulence characteristics. While Listeria includes a number of species-like clades, many of these
putative species include clades or strains with atypical virulence associated characteristics. This information will
allow for the development of genetic and genomic criteria for pathogenic strains, including development of assays
that specifically detect pathogenic Listeria strains.

Background
The eight recognized species within the genus Listeria
include L. monocytogenes, L. innocua, L. welshimeri,
L. seeligeri, L. ivanovii, L. grayi, L. marthii [1] and L.
rocourtiae [2], the latter two were described in 2009.
L. grayi is only distantly related to the other Listeria

species [1,3] and has been proposed to represent a different genus, Murraya [4]. L. monocytogenes and L.
ivanovii are pathogens of warm-blooded hosts. L monocytogenes causes a severe foodborne disease in humans
as well as invasive infections in a number of other
warm-blooded host species, particularly ruminants.
L. ivanovii predominantly causes infections in ruminants, but has also been associated with rare infections
in humans [5,6]; this species is considered to have a
narrower host range than L. monocytogenes [7].

Interestingly, each of these two pathogenic Listeria species is closely related to non-pathogenic species;
L. monocytogenes is closely related to L. innocua and
L. marthii [1], and L. ivanovii is closely related to L. seeligeri [3,8], which is non-pathogenic even though many
isolates contain a homologue of the main Listeria virulence gene cluster.
Genome sequencing efforts for Listeria have, so far,
largely focused on L. monocytogenes; as of August 15,
2010, 25 L. monocytogenes genome sequences are publicly accessible in standard sequence databases (GenBank; EMBL). Most of these L. monocytogenes genome
sequences represent strains classified into the two most
common L. monocytogenes phylogenetic lineages [9]
including lineage I (e.g. strains F2365, H7858 [10] )
and lineage II (e.g. strains EGD-e [11], 08-5578 and 085923 [12]). The other two L. monocytogenes phylogenetic
lineages (III and IV) are only represented by 3 genome
sequences (i.e., strains HCC23 [Genbank acc.
CP001175], FSL J2-071 [Genbank acc. ARN00000000],
and FSL J1-208 [Genbank acc. AARL00000000]). Publicly available genome sequences for other Listeria species include those for L. innocua CLIP11262 [11] and L.
welshimeri SLCC5334 [13] as well as recently released
the genome sequences for L. seeligeri SLCC3954 [14]
and L. grayii DSM 20601 (Genbank acc. ACCR00
000000). Knowledge of the genomic content of nonpathogenic relatives of pathogenic species is necessary
though to understand the evolution of virulence associated genes and to facilitate identification of putative
virulence genes [15].
The main Listeria virulence gene cluster (also known
as the prfA virulence cluster or the Listeria pathogenicity island [LiPI]) encodes a number of proteins that are
necessary for intracellular survival and motility [16,17].
Specific functions encoded in this cluster include hemolysin, two phospholipases and a metalloprotease
(encoded by hly, plcA, plcB, and mpl), which all contribute to escape from host cell vacuoles, an actin polymerizing protein (encoded by actA), and a global
regulator of virulence gene transcription (encoded by
prfA). Members of the internalin protein family, which
are cell wall anchored or secreted proteins that are characterized by the presence of leucine rich repeats, are
also associated with virulence in different Listeria
strains. While a considerable number of genes encoding
internalins have been reported in pathogenic and nonpathogenic Listeria [11,18,19], clear virulence related
functions have only been assigned to a few internalins,
including inlA and inlB, which encode proteins required
for invasion of different cells types, including human
intestinal epithelial cells [20], and inlC [21]. A number
of atypical Listeria strains and lineages have been
reported [22-24], including several putative evolutionary

Page 2 of 20

intermediates, which are characterized by unique virulence gene presence/absence patterns. For example,
while the non-pathogenic L. innocua is typically nonhemolytic and lacks the prfA cluster, a small number of
strains that contain the prfA cluster as well as inlA have
been reported [22,23]. Also, non-hemolytic L. seeligeri
strains that lack the prfA cluster have been reported
[24]; even though many L. seeligeri contain the prfA
cluster, isolates in this species are avirulent in typically
studied mammalian hosts [25].
Based on the observations outlined above, we propose
that the genus Listeria represents an outstanding model
system for studying the evolution of pathogenicity and
the transition between pathogenic and saprotrophic lifestyles using a comparative genomics approach. We thus
performed genome sequencing of (i) isolates representing Listeria species (except for L. grayi) for which no
genome sequences are publicly available and (ii) atypical
strains of Listeria species for which genome sequences
of typical strains were already available. While
L. marthii was included in our genome sequencing
efforts, L. rocourtiae was not as this new species was
described after completion of the work reported here.

Methods
Selection of isolates for genome sequencing

The isolates sequenced in this study (Table 1) were
selected to (i) cover the full phylogenetic diversity of the
genus Listeria (except for L. grayii) [9], and to (ii) represent atypical phenotypes (e.g., hemolytic L. innocua, nonhemolytic L. seeligeri) of some non-pathogenic species.
L. seeligeri FSL N1-067 was selected as a typical hemolytic
strain, while L. seeligeri FSL S4-171 represents an atypical
non-hemolytic strain of the same species. L. marthii FSL
S4-120 is the type strain of L. marthii and has recently
been shown to represent the most closely related species
to L. monocytogenes, however it is not pathogenic. L.
ivanovii subsp. londoniensis FSL F6-596 (ATCC 49954)
represents the type strain of this subspecies and represents
the second pathogenic species in Listeria. L. monocytogenes FSL F2-208 represents lineage IIIC, a distinct lineage
within L. monocytogenes that has not been sequenced
before. L. innocua FSL J1-023 was sequenced because this
strain represents a atypical hemolytic L. innocua isolate,
while FSL S4-378 was sequenced as an additional typical
non-hemolytic strain of L. innocua to further assess intraspecific genomic variation within L. innocua. Hemolytic
activity for all strains was previously tested [26].
Genome sequencing and assembly

Genomic DNA was isolated using the UltraClean Microbial DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad,
CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Listeria
genomes were sequenced using the SOLiD™ 3 system

here. The L. ivanovii strain sequenced here is the type strain of L. ivanovii subsp londoniensis (ATCC 49954). L. monocytogenes FSL R2-574, a duplicate of L.
monocytogenes F2365, was sequenced to assess the performance of the sequence and genome assembly methods.

Sizes of newly sequenced genomes were derived from the sum of the length of all contigs from the de novo assembly.
d
All L. monocytogenes strains were classified as pathogens based on their involvement in clinical cases and/or their virulence in mouse studies (i.e., EGD-e [86],
F2365 [87]) except for L. monocytogenes HCC23, which has been shown to be non-pathogenic [78]. The hemolytic L. innocua FSL J1-023 was considered nonpathogenic based on its avirulence in a mouse infection experiment [22]. All non-hemolytic strains were considered avirulent as they lack the prfA virulence
cluster. Avirulence for some strains was also supported by animal experiments (i.e., L. welshimeri [77]; L. innocua CLIP11262 [21]) or tissue culture data (i.e., L.
marthii [1]). The hemolytic L. seeligeri strain was considered avirulent as it shows low invasion efficiencies for Caco-2 cells (comparable to avirulent L. innocua; see
Figure 5) and as other hemolytic L. seeligeri strains have been shown to be avirulent in mouse infection experiments [77].

a

(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following manufacturer’s protocols. Mate-paired libraries with approximately 1.5 kb inserts were constructed from 20 μg of
genomic DNA, and deposited on one quarter of a flow
cell. Twenty-five base reads were obtained from each of
the F3 and R3 tags, with 27 million to 57 million reads
obtained for each of the genomes. After correcting
errors in colorspace reads using a modified version of
the spectral alignment tools from the EULER-USR package [27], de novo assembly was performed using the
SOLiD™ System de novo Accessory Tools (http://solidsoftwaretools.com/gf/project/denovo/), which employs
the Velvet assembly engine [28].
In order to identify likely misassemblies, scaffolds
were aligned using MUMmer [29] to the most closely
related reference genome available at the time of the
analysis: L. monocytogenes scaffolds were aligned to

L. monocytogenes F2365, L. innocua and L. marthii scaffolds were aligned to L. innocua Clip11262, and L. ivanovii and L. seeligeri scaffolds were aligned to L.
welshimeri SLCC5334. Scaffolds were broken at points
where non-contiguous regions of the reference genome
were juxtaposed, and then ordered such that they were
syntenic with the reference genome. All scaffolds were
then concatenated into a single pseudogenome, separated by the sequence NNNNNCACACACTTAATTAATTAAGTGTGTGN NNNN, which puts stop
codons in all six reading frames. Scaffolds that did not
match the reference genome were concatenated in arbitrary order at the end of the pseudogenome.
The genome sequences of the seven newly sequenced
strains have been deposited to GenBank as whole genome shotgun projects (see table 1 for accession
numbers).

Genome annotation and whole genome alignments

Concatenated pseudogenome sequences were run
through JCVI’s prokaryotic annotation pipeline (http://
www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/annotation-service/),
which includes gene finding with Glimmer, Blastextend-repraze (BER) searches to extend ORF finding
beyond premature stop codons, HMM searches against
Pfam [30] and TIGRFAM [31], TMHMM searches,
SignalP predictions, and automatic annotations from
AutoAnnotate. The manual annotation tool Manatee
(downloaded from http://manatee.sourceforge.net) was
used to manually review the output and aid in genome
annotation and gene identification. Whole genome
alignments were created in Mauve 2.3.0 [32] using the
Progressive Mauve algorithm.
Orthologue analyses

Initially, orthologues found in six publicly available complete Listeria genomes (see Table 1) were identified using
BLASTCLUST [33]. This analysis was limited to these six
complete genomes to avoid possible problems with
(sometimes incomplete) fragmented draft sequences such
as the genome sequences available in the Broad Institute
L. monocytogenes database (http://www.broadinstitute.
org/annotation/genome/listeria_group/MultiHome.html),
at the time of this analysis. Only ORFs having at least 225
nt (encoding 75 amino acids [aa]) were considered in this
analysis as smaller ORFs were not annotated consistently
among the genomes. A set of 3,668 unique ORFs, found
among these six complete genomes by requiring 75% aa
identity over at least 80%, was used to identify orthologues of these ORFs in the new genome assemblies (using
TBLASTN queries with a single member of each cluster
and requiring at least 65% aa identity). The 75% identity
threshold was selected empirically after running blastclust with a range of percent identity values: requiring
more than 75% identity resulted in too many orthologues
being split into multiple clusters, and allowing lower
values resulted in too many clusters containing paralogues. When an orthologue in a draft assembly was split
into two or more fragments, these were considered to be
a single match.
ORFs identified only in the seven newly sequenced
genomes by the JCVI automated sequence annotation
pipeline were split at any run of five or more ambiguous amino acids (’X’), which resulted from in-frame
strings of fifteen or more ‘N’ between contigs in the
assemblies. After splitting, all ORFs and ORF fragments with length less than 50 aa were removed from
the set. Amino acid sequences of the remaining ORFs
were screened against the nucleotide sequences of the
six previously available finished Listeria genomes using
TBLASTN with an identity threshold of 65%, and
those without any hits were identified. These novel

Page 4 of 20

Listeria ORFs were screened against all seven draft
genome assemblies in order to determine their distribution across the set of strains.
Core and pan genome analysis

The mixture model method of Snipen et al. [34] was
used to estimate the number of genes in (i) the core
genome (i.e., the set of genes found within every strain
within the genus Listeria [34,35]) and in (ii) the pangenome (i.e., the core genome plus the dispensable or
accessory genome, which is defined as the genes that
are found in some, but not all, strains including genes
that are unique to a single strain [34,35]). To compare
these estimates to another group of Gram-positive bacteria that includes closely related pathogens and nonpathogens, the same method was used to estimate the
core and pan-genome of the Bacillus cereus group, a
group that can be considered a single species from taxonomic point of view [36]. Only the chromosome
sequences of five B. anthracis, nine B. cereus, two B.
thuringiensis, and one B. weihenstephanensis strain were
used for this analysis.
Cumulative pan-genome size plots for Listeria were
calculated by selecting strains without replacement in
random order 500 times, and then calculating the mean
pan-genome size at each sampling point. Blast2GO [37]
was used to perform a functional annotation of the
genes found in the core and the pan-genome.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic trees of the Listeria isolates were constructed using sequences for 100 genes in the core genome of the species studied; these genes were randomly
selected form all genes that were previously shown to
have no evidence for either positive selection or recombination [38] as these two processes make it problematic
to infer the true organismal phylogeny. Phylogenetic
trees were inferred using neighbor joining, maximum
parsimony and minimum evolution phylogenetic reconstruction methods available in the MEGA package version 4.1 [39]. A Bayesian analysis was performed using
MrBayes 3.12 [40] and the GTR +I+G model of nucleotide evolution. A phylogenetic reconstruction using presence or absence data of genes in the pan genome was
performed using the maximum parsimony method in
PAUP* version 4.010b [41].
To infer the time to the most recent common ancestor of Listeria and to infer the approximate age of the
individual Listeria species, a Bayesian molecular clock
analysis was performed in BEAST version 1.5.2 [42]
based on the concatenated 100 core genes. One strain
from each species or lineage was included in the analysis. The molecular clock analysis was performed using a
GTR +I+G nucleotide substitution model, and a relaxed

den Bakker et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:688
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/688

clock model to account for variation in substitution
rates. Tracer version 1.4.1 was used to assess the proper
burn-in and sampling of the model parameters. We
used a mutation rate of 4.5 × 10-9 per site per year, as
suggested by Ochman et al. [43] to calibrate the tree.
Evolutionary analysis of internalins

As at least some internalins have been shown to be
important virulence factors in Listeria (see the Background section for more details) we decided to employ
a phylogenetic approach to infer the homology and evolution of genes in the internalin gene family. This was
specifically important because the JCVI automated
annotation pipeline annotated most internalin genes
inconsistently as either (i) internalin A, (ii) leucine-rich
repeat containing protein, or (iii) cell wall anchor
domain-containing protein. Amino acid sequences of
ORFs predicted to encode internalins or leucine-rich
repeat proteins were extracted from the annotated genomes; the newly sequenced genomes were aligned to
publicly available, well-annotated genomes (e.g., EGD-e
and F2365) to identify internalin genes that were missed
in the initial annotation. After alignment using the
EINSI strategy in the MAFFT alignment package [44],
internalin aa sequences were used for phylogenetic
reconstruction using a maximum parsimony heuristic
search in PAUP* 4.010b [41]. Gaps identified in internalin genes were either closed by PCR and Sanger sequencing or by reassembly of the raw SOLiD™ system reads
using improved versions of the de novo assembly tools.
Internalins found in L. monocytogenes CLIP80459 were
not included in this analysis because the majority of the
internalins (26 out of 28) in this strain are identical (at
the aa level) to those found in L. monocytogenes F2365.
Presence of virulence-associated genes

The presence, in the 13 genome sequences analyzed, of
78 putative virulence-associated genes previously
reported by Camejo et al. [45] was assessed using whole
genome alignments produced with Mauve 2.3.0. The
PVclust R package [46] was used to perform a cluster
analysis based on the presence/absence data for genes
that showed variable presence/absence.
Horizontal gene transfer and mobile elements

SIGI-HMM [47] was used to infer if genes in the genomes were acquired through horizontal gene transfer
(HGT); this program uses a codon usage based hidden
Markov model to infer if genes are of alien origin (i.e.,
have been introduced into the genome from a divergent
gene pool by HGT). Genes with more than 10% ambiguous sites were excluded from the analyses. The detection
sensitivity of SIGI-HMM was set to 0.95. Prophages and
prophage derived regions were identified using the

Page 5 of 20

online version of Prophinder [48]. The Prophinder algorithm searches for regions that are dense in phage-like
proteins, using a BLASTP search [33] against all phage
proteins in the ACLAME database [49]. Transposons
and plasmid related genes were identified with SIGIHMM and through examination of the initial genome
annotations for transposon- or plasmid-related genes.
Identification of Restriction and Modification and CRISPR
systems

Bacterial defense systems against mobile elements/foreign DNA implicated in the reduction of horizontal
gene transfer include (i) restriction-modification (R-M)
systems [50] and (ii) clustered, regularly interspaced,
short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) systems [51]. R-M
systems were identified by screening the initial annotation for genes involved in R-M systems. CRISPRfinder
[52] was used to find CRISPR regions. Because the
CRISPR regions consist of highly repetitive regions,
which may prove problematic for short read based de
novo assembly methods, the annotated genomes were
also searched for CRISPR associated genes (Cas genes).
When the presence of the actual CRISPR region was
ambiguous, the presence of Cas genes was considered
evidence for a functional CRISPR system.
Caco-2 invasion assays

The ability to invade human intestinal epithelial cells, a
phenotype associated with the presence of inlA, was
tested for selected strains; the L. marthii strain was not
tested as its invasiveness has previously been reported
[1]. The invasion assays with the human intestinal
epithelial cell line Caco-2 were performed as previously
described [53]. L. monocytogenes 10403S and isogenic
ΔinlA (FSL K4-006) strain were included as controls in
each invasion assay.
Confirmation absence virulence associated genes in nonpathogenic strains

To confirm the absence of critical virulence associated
genes (i.e. inlA, inlB, inlC and the prfA cluster) in genomes where these genes were not found, we resequenced the regions where these genes are found in
pathogenic strains. The absence of inlC in these nonpathogenic strains was further confirmed by PCR with
degenerate primers designed to amplify inlC in L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii. Primer sequences and additional information can be found in additional file 1.

Results
De novo assembly of short sequence reads yields high
quality draft genomes for selected Listeria species

The genomes of eight Listeria strains were sequenced,
using mate-paired libraries, on the SOLiD™ 3 System.

den Bakker et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:688
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/688

The previously sequenced L. monocytogenes strain F2365
(our strain ID FSL R2-574) was included in this set to
evaluate assembly of SOLiD™ system reads. Mapping of
FSL R2-574 SOLiD™ system reads to the F2365 reference genome resulted in 200× median unique coverage
depth (Figure 1), with unique coverage gaps only in
multicopy loci (e.g., rRNA genes). The corona_lite SNP
calling tool identified 21 putative SNPs and 4 ambiguities (see additional file 2 for more information); 19 of
these putative SNPs appeared to be legitimate based on
coverage depth. PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing confirmed that all 21 putative SNPs represent real
differences between the published genome sequence of
F2365 and our isolate of this strain (FSL R2-574). The
four ambiguities were found to be due to single base
pair insertions or deletions in FSL R2-574 relative to the
F2365 genome. Three additional mutational differences
(two adjacent SNPs and a single base pair insertion)
were found in FSL R2-574 during Sanger sequencingbased confirmation of the SNPs identified initially.
Examination of the original trace files for the F2365
genome indicated that 24 of these 28 overall differences
likely represent sequence errors in the original F2365
sequence (additional file 2). However, four SNPs (see
additional file 2) appear to represent real differences
between the F2365 and FSL R2-574 genomes, which
most likely arose during laboratory passage, as suggested
previously in both L. monocytogenes [54] and Bacillus
anthracis [55].
Most of the FSL R2-574 genome was encompassed in
eight large scaffolds with the largest scaffold over 1.4
Mb. Alignment of this assembly to the F2365 reference
genome indicated that 98.09% of the genome was covered with identity of 99.64%, and fewer than ten misassemblies (i.e., juxtaposition in scaffolds of noncontiguous regions of the genome) were observed,

Page 6 of 20

indicating a high quality draft genome for FSL R2-574,
according to the definition of Chain et al. [56].
Assembly of the SOLiD™ system reads resulted in 785 to
2,551 contigs per genome (Table 2); the sum of the contig
lengths ranged from 2.8 to 3.2 Mb, which is comparable to
genome sizes of previously sequenced Listeria genomes
(Table 1). When non-contiguous genomic regions were
found to be juxtaposed in the assembly, the scaffold was
broken and reordered to correspond with the reference
genome order. The number of potential misassemblies
due to illegitimate scaffolding of contigs ranged from 68
(L. seeligeri FSL S4-171) to 500 (L. monocytogenes FSL F2208) with a median of 152. Predicted ORF counts (based
on JCVI annotations and orthology analyses) ranged from
2,724 for L. marthii FSL S4-120 to 3,017 for L. seeligeri
FSL N1-067 (Table 2 and additional file 3).
The Listeria pan-genome is estimated to contain
approximately 6,500 genes, including about 2,000 core
genes

A total of 4,950 orthologous genes were found among
the 13 genome sequences analyzed here, including the 7
new genome sequences generated. Based on these data,
a mixture model approach [34] estimated the size of the
actual Listeria pan-genome as 6,494 genes, suggesting
that over 1,500 Listeria genes remain to be discovered
by further sequencing (Figure 2a). According to this
mixture model approach, the Listeria pan-genome best
fitted a model with four components including (i) a
component of 31% of the genes with a detection probability of 1.0 (the core-genome), (ii) a component of 7%
of the genes with a detection probability of 0.82, (iii) a
component of 10% of the genes with a detection probability of 0.33, and (iv) a component of 52% of the
genes with a detection probability of 0.06 (Figure 2b).

four-component model (17,783) versus that of the threecomponent model (18,393) indicates a better fit. A relatively large part of the estimated pan-genome (76.2%)
was covered by the actual pan-genome inferred from
the 13 Listeria genome sequences. In contrast, only 42%
of the estimated pan-genome was covered by the actual
pan-genome inferred from the 17 genome-sequences of
the B. cereus group.
The observed core genome shared by all 13 Listeria
strains comprises 2,032 genes (shown as genes found in
EGD-e and all other genomes in Figure 3), while the
estimated size of the core genome is 1,994 genes, indicating that the core genome as defined by this study will
change very little as more genomes are sequenced.
While the number of accessory genes observed so far is
2,918, the estimated total number of accessory genes for
the genus Listeria (except L. grayi) is 4,500. Only a small
proportion of ORFs in the different Listeria genomes was
predicted to be introduced by HGT (2.0 to 6.4%; see Table
3) and only one of these ORFs, a collagen binding protein
in L. monocytogenes FSL F2-208 is potentially associated
with virulence. The majority of the genes found in the
core genome are involved in metabolic processes (nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic
processes [17% of GO hits], cellular macromolecule metabolic processes (14% of GO hits) and protein metabolic
processes [10% of GO hits]) and transport (13% of GO
hits), which is congruent with the general notion that the
core genome contains genes that are essential for the survival of the organism. Genes involved in metabolic processes and transport also dominate the accessory genome
(nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic processes [21% of GO hits], cellular macromolecule
metabolic processes (20% of GO hits) and transport [13%
of GO hits]), which can be explained by the fact that species in Listeria have a primarily saprotrophic lifestyle and

genes in the accessory genome are putatively involved in
the metabolism of specific carbon sources. A large part of
the accessory genome (35% of the genes), however, cannot
be classified according to the Gene Ontology or is without
any significant Blast hits to proteins currently in Genbank.
Among these unclassified genes in the accessory genome
are hypothetical proteins, proteins involved in phage resistance and prophage associated genes.
L. seeligeri genome characteristics

A total of 3,017 and 2,820 ORFs were identified in L. seeligeri FSL N1-067 and FSL S4-171, respectively (Table 2);
these ORF counts are considerably higher than the 2,710
ORFs recently reported for L. seeligeri SLCC3954 [14]. In
addition to 88 L. seeligeri specific ORFs (i.e., ORFs only
found in both L. seeligeri FSL N1-067 and FSL S4-171),
which included three ORFs encoding specific internalinlike genes, we also identified strain specific ORFs (Table
3), including seven and three genes that encode putative
internalins (in FSL S4-171 and FSL N1-067, respectively).
Overall, 15 and 17 internalin genes were found in L. seeligeri FSL N1-067 and FSL S4-171, respectively (Table 3);
by comparison 16 internalin-like genes were reported for
L. seeligeri SLCC3954 [14]. The genomic region harboring
inlAB in other Listeria is completely absent from the
L. seeligeri genomes (see additional file 4). The inlGHE
region is absent from the FSL N1-067 genome; in FSL S4171 this region contains ABC-transporter encoding ORFs
(see additional file 5). Consistent with the absence of inlA,
L. seeligeri FSL N1-067 was non-invasive in the Caco-2
cell invasion assay, with invasion efficiencies similar to the
L. monocytogenes 10403S inlA null mutant (Figure 4).
The L. seeligeri FSL N1-067 prfA cluster (additional file
6) is very similar to the prfA cluster previously described
[3] for L. seeligeri with the exception that instead of a
duplication of plcB, two short open reading frames

strains without replacement in random order 500 times, and then calculating the mean pan-genome size at each sampling point (solid red line).
Error bars indicate one standard deviation from the mean. Estimated pan-genome size from mixture model analysis is indicated as a dotted cyan
line. (b) The graphical display of the mixture model represents the four components of the pan-genome as rectangles, including (i) a component of
31% of the genes with a detection probability of 1.0 (blue: the core-genome), (ii) a component representing 7% of the genes with a detection
probability of 0.82 (teal), (iii) a component of 10% of the genes with a detection probability of 0.33 (yellow), and (iv) a component of 52% of the
genes with a detection probability of 0.06 (rare genes: orange).

(encoding two proteins of 51 and 61 aa), with 62% and
41% similarity to parts of a L. seeligeri plcB sequence are
found (GenBank accession AAR97365). The non-hemolytic strain FS S4-171 is characterized by the absence of
the prfA cluster as also confirmed by PCR (additional
file 6); however, the two ORFs (ORFX and ORFI)
reported to be lost in the non-hemolytic isolates

analyzed by Volokhov et al. [24] are present in
the remains of the FSL S4-171 prfA cluster (additional
file 6).
Evidence for the presence of a plasmid was found for
the hemolytic L. seeligeri FSL N1-067; the initial annotation identified six ORFs that were annotated as two resolvases, a replication associated protein and a LtrC-like

Figure 3 Comparative genome content of 13 Listeria chromosomes and L. innocua plasmid pLI100. The outermost circle indicates the
source of each gene in the pan-genome with each gene represented by a constant width wedge. Starting at the top of the figure (0 Mb) and
moving clockwise, all EGD-e genes are arranged in chromosomal order. Continuing clockwise, all genes not present in EGD-e are grouped by
strain (as indicated by segment labels). Genes in the F2365 segment are present in F2365, but absent from EGD-e, and genes in the Clip81459
segment are present in Clip81459, but absent from F2365 and EGD-e, and so on. In this way, each gene is represented only once in the
diagram. Gene order in all segments except EGD-e is monotonically increasing, but discontinuous, since shared genes may be represented in
other segments. Internal circles indicate gene presence (solid color) or absence (unfilled) of each gene in each of the 13 strains examined. Circles
from outer to inner are in the same order as strains on the outer circle, starting with EGD-e, followed by F2365, etc. L. monocytogenes strains are

query to identify more plasmid-derived contigs in

plasmid related contigs that encoded 63 putative ORFs,

Figure 4 Invasion efficiencies in Caco-2 cells of Listeria strains.
The strains tested are shown on the x-axis and include L. seeligeri
FSL N1-067, L. innocua FSL S4-378 (non-hemolytic), L.
monocytogenes 10403S ΔinlA (FSL K4-006), L. innocua FSL J1-023
(hemolytic) and L. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis FSL F6-596 (ATCC
49954). Invasion efficiency (the number of recovered cells/number
of cells used for inoculation) was normalized to the invasion
efficiency obtained for L. monocytogenes 10403S, which was set as
100%, and was included as a control strain in each essay. Three
independent invasion assays were performed for each strain tested.

ORFs of ≥ 95%). These contigs totaled 60,916 bp, representing an estimate of the minimum plasmid size (use of
pLI100 as a query may not have identified non-homologous plasmid regions). Some of the predicted genes on
this plasmid are involved in cadmium, arsenic and multidrug resistance, consistent with previous reports of plasmid-associated cadmium and arsenic resistance genes in
L. monocytogenes [58]. Two different R-M systems were
found in the genome of L. seeligeri FSL N1-067; a MjaXIP
specific Type I system and an EcoPI specific Type III system. Only one Type I restriction modification system was
found in the non-hemolytic L. seeligeri strain FSL S4-171.
A CRISPR system was identified in FSL N1-067, but not
in FSL S4-171 (Table 3), suggesting differences in phage
resistance between the two strains.
L. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis genome characteristics

A total of 2,919 ORFs were identified in the L. ivanovii
subsp. londoniensis genome, which contains one prophage
and two monocin-like regions (Table 3). Presence of a
functional CRISPR system was inferred from the presence
of Cas genes. The L. ivanovii genome included 20 genes

den Bakker et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:688
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/688

that putatively encode internalins (Table 3); the inlAB
region (additional file 4) contains seven ORFs, including
five that encode internalins (i.e., one inlA and two inlB
homologues, one internalin A-like protein and an internalin with distant homology to lin2724, an internalin found
in L. innocua CLIP11262). Consistent with the presence of
an inlA homologue, L. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis FSL
F6-596 showed Caco-2 cell invasion efficiency comparable
to L. monocytogenes 10403S (Figure 4).
L. innocua genome characteristics

A total of 2,855 and 2,737 ORFs were identified in the
genome sequences for the non-hemolytic L. innocua
FSL S4-278 and the hemolytic L. innocua FSL J1-023.
Only three genes were exclusively found in all three L.
innocua genomes (i.e., the two genomes sequenced here
and CLIP11262); lin0464, which encodes a putative transcriptional regulator and lin1452 and lin2741, which
both encode hypothetical proteins. Noteworthy among
the strain specific ORFs (Table 3) are three ORFs
encoding genes involved in cobalt transport systems in
strain FSL J1-023. No prophage regions were identified
in the genome of the hemolytic L. innocua strain FSL
J1-023, while the non-hemolytic strains CLIP11262 and
FSL S4-378 contain five and four prophage regions,
respectively. The number of internalin genes in the L.
innocua genomes ranged from 17 to 20 (Table 3). The
inlAB region of the hemolytic L. innocua only contains
a homologue of inlA; inlB is absent as previously
reported [23]. Consistent with these findings, the hemolytic L. innocua FSL J1-023, which contains inlA, shows
average Caco-2 invasion efficiencies comparable to L.
monocytogenes 10403S (Figure 4), while the non-hemolytic L. innocua FSL S4-378 was non-invasive, with invasion efficiencies similar to those for the L.
monocytogenes 10403S inlA null mutant (Figure 4).
Modification and restriction systems were present in
all three L. innocua genomes (Table 3). L. innocua
CLIP11262 and FSL S4-378 harbor a type I R-M system,
while the hemolytic L. innocua FSL J1-023 has two type
II R-M systems, a Sau3AI specific system and an EcoRV
specific system (which is unique to this strain). CRISPR
systems are present in the genomes of CLIP11262 and
FSL S4-378, but were not found in FSL J1-023.

in L. marthii is a genomic island that encodes for part
of a lantibiotic biosynthesis gene cluster. We also identified 23 genes that were only found in the genomes of L.
marthii and the L. monocytogenes lineage IIIC strain
FSL F2-208; BLAST searches against GenBank revealed
that the eight of these genes were also found in other L.
monocytogenes lineage III and IV genomes (2 and 6
genes in FSL J2-072 and FSL J1-208, respectively).
While 19 internalin-like genes were found in the
L. marthii genome, the inlAB region did not contain
any internalin-like genes as confirmed by PCR and the
inlGHE region contained one ORF encoding an ABC
transporter and a homolog of inlC2 (additional file 5).
The L. marthii genome contains a type I R-M system
and a CRISPR system.
L. monocytogenes genome characteristics

A total of 2,910 ORFs were identified in L. monocytogenes lineage IIIC strain FSL F2-208 (Table 3), which is
similar to the number of ORFs identified in other
L. monocytogenes genomes. Only four genes were shared
between all L. monocytogenes genomes but not found
in the genomes of any of the other species;
LMOf2365_0100 (a MerR transcriptional regulator),
LMOf2365_0101 (an aldo/keto reductase family oxidoreductase), LMOf2365_0477 (a hypothetical protein) and
LMOf2365_0769 (a DNA binding protein). While the
number of prophages identified ranged from zero to
three (Table 3), all L. monocytogenes genomes contained
one monocin region, except HCC23, which seems to
lack a monocin region. The chromosome of L. monocytogenes FSL F2-208 contains a region with high similarity to a putative conjugative element CTn1 found in
Clostridium difficile [59]; this region contains one ORF
encoding a putative virulence factor, a collagen adhesion
protein. The number of internalin-like genes in the
L. monocytogenes genomes ranged from 18 to 28 (Table
3). The inlAB region is highly variable, however all genomes examined here contain ORFs with homology to
inlA and inlB (additional file 4). The inlGHE region is
completely absent from the HCC23 genome; in FSL F2208, this region seems to only contain an inlC2 homolog
(additional file 5). All L. monocytogenes genomes, with
the exception of the EGD-e genome, contain R-M systems (see Table 3).

L. marthii genome characteristics

A total of 2,724 ORFs were identified in the L. marthii
FSL S4-120 genome, including 74 ORFs exclusively
found in this strain (Table 3). Prophinder found no evidence for the presence of prophages, however one
monocin region was detected. Among the genomes
examined here, the L. marthii genome has the highest
percentage (6.4%) of ORFs that are introduced through
HGT (Table 3). One of the regions introduced by HGT

yielded similar topologies, placing L. seeligeri and

L. ivanovii in one well-supported clade (100% bootstrap,
100% posterior probability) and L. welshimeri basal to
another well supported clade containing L. innocua,
L. marthii and L. monocytogenes (see Figure 5, the left
tree shows the phylogeny resulting from the Bayesian
analysis). Within the L. innocua/L. marthii/L. monocytogenes clade, L. innocua is the most divergent species,
while L. marthii forms a sister group to L. monocytogenes. All phylogenetic relationships within this clade
are well supported (bootstrap support > 98%, 100% posterior probability). The maximum parsimony tree differs
from the other trees by its placement of L. welshimeri
within the L. seeligeri/L. ivanovii clade. While neighbor
joining, maximum likelihood, minimum evolution and
parsimony methods do not find any significant bootstrap
support for the placement of L. welshimeri in the phylogeny, the Bayesian analysis supports placement of
L. welshimeri as a basal taxon to the L. innocua/
L. marthii/L. monocytogenes clade with a highly significant posterior probability (100%).
A maximum parsimony phylogeny based on the presence and absence of orthologous genes yielded in a single
tree (4,805 steps, consistency index 0.608, rescaled consistency index 0.446; Figure 5, right tree) with topology similar to the tree based on Bayesian, minimum evolution,
maximum likelihood and neighbor joining phylogenetic
inference of the 100 gene sequence dataset. The only differences are the placement of L. monocytogenes FSL
F2-208 and L. innocua FSL J1-023. In the gene contentbased phylogeny, the hemolytic L. innocua FSL J1-023
strain is placed is outside of the clade containing the two
non-hemolytic L. innocua strains. L. monocytogenes FSL

F2-208 is placed in a well-supported (97% bootstrap support) clade together with L. marthii. This placement can
be mainly attributed to 23 genes that were only found in
the L. monocytogenes FSL F2-208 genome and the L.
marthii genome (see section ‘L. marthii genome characteristics’ for more information).
A molecular clock analysis of the 100-gene phylogeny,
calibrated with the mutation rate proposed by Ochman
et al. (Figure 6), places the time of most recent common
ancestor (MRCA) of Listeria (excluding L. grayi) at 47
million years ago (mya) with a 95% highest probability
density (HPD) of 58 mya to 39 mya. The time of divergence of L. welshimeri from the MRCA of L. innocua,
L. marthii and L. monocytogenes was estimated at 33
mya (95% HPD: 40-27 mya). L. innocua is estimated to
have diverged from the MRCA of L. monocytogenes and
L. marthii at 29 mya (95% HPD: 35-24 mya). L. marthii
and L. monocytogenes were estimated to have diverged
from each other around the same time as the divergence
of L. seeligeri and L. ivanovii (21 and 20 mya, respectively). Because the mutation rate proposed by Ochman
et al. [43] is based on the divergence of Escherichia coli
and Salmonella enterica, it may not be applicable to
other bacteria. We therefore used the sequence divergence of 16S rRNA between L. monocytogenes and
L. ivanovii to infer the putative age of the MRCA of Listeria. The divergence between L. monocytogenes and
L. ivanovii is 0.9 to 1.2% (calculated based on full length
16S rDNA data previously reported [1]), which would
translate to dating the MRCA at 45 to 60 mya, given
the universal 16S rRNA divergence rate of 1% per 50
million years proposed by Ochmann and Wilson [60].

Figure 6 Maximum clade credibility tree summarizing the results of the Bayesian molecular clock analysis of the 100 concatenated
core genome genes. The timeline indicates the age of the nodes when a mutation rate of 4.5 × 10-9 per year/site was used to calibrate the
tree. One strain from each species or lineage was included in the analysis; L. monocytogenes lineages I (F2365), II (EGD-e) and IIIC (FSL F2-208), L.
marthii (FSL S4-120), L. innocua (CLIP11262), L. welshimeri (SLCC5334), L. seeligeri (FSL N1-067), and L. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis (FSL F6-596).
Values above the branches indicate posterior probability values, blue horizontal bars on the nodes show the 95% highest probability density of
the inferred age of the nodes. The posterior probability of the individual trees and 95% highest probability density of the divergence time were
based on 9,000,000 post burn-in generations of a 10,000,000 generation run. The values on the time lines represent ages as million years before
present. Labels of pathogenic strains have been colored red.

While non-pathogenic Listeria have fewer virulence
associated genes, gene presence patterns for these genes
identify only internalin C as a gene that differentiates
pathogenic and non-pathogenic Listeria

Out of 78 putative virulence-associated genes previously
reported [45] (see additional file 7), 56 were found in all
13 genomes analyzed. Only 22 of these genes (not including the genes in the prfA cluster) were variable in their
presence between genomes (Table 4), including three
putative virulence-associated genes that were found solely
in the L. monocytogenes EGD-e genome. Using a hierarchical cluster analysis based on the presence or absence of
the 22 variable genes, the strains were subdivided into two
clusters, including (i) a cluster composed of L. ivanovii
subsp. londoniensis, all L. monocytogenes strains and the
hemolytic L. innocua strain and (ii) a cluster composed of
only non-pathogenic strains (the non-hemolytic L. innocua
strains, L. seeligeri, L. marthii and L. welshimeri).
Other than the prfA virulence cluster, the only gene
that is absent from strains in the non-pathogen cluster
but present in the first cluster is inlA, encoding internalin

A, a key determinant of host intestinal cell invasion. The
inlC gene, encoding internalin C, is the only gene that
differentiates pathogens (i.e., L. monocytogenes EGD-e, L.
monocytogenes F2365, L. monocytogenes FSL F2-208 and
L. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis) from non-pathogens (all
other strains). There is a significant (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
test) difference between pathogenic and non-pathogenic
strains in the number of variable virulence-associated
genes, with 10 to 22 genes present in pathogenic strains
and 5 to 12 genes present in non-pathogenic strains.
All Listeria strains contain multiple internalin-encoding
genes with 16 internalin genes present in both main
clades of the genus Listeria

A total of 252 putative internalin genes were identified
in the genomes examined here; the number of internalin
genes ranged from 9 internalins in L. welshimeri
SLCC5334 to 28 internalins in L. monocytogenes
CLIP81459 (Table 3). The number of internalin genes in
the non-pathogenic strains (Table 1) was significantly
lower as compared to the number in pathogenic strains

a

The genes listed here are based on 78 putative virulence associated genes reported by Camejo et al. [45]. Only 22 genes found to show variable presence
among the 13 genomes analyzed here are shown. The absence of the prfA-cluster, inlA, inlB and inlC was additionally confirmed by PCR and in some cases
sequencing (see additional file 1 for more information).

Lm = L. monocytogenes; Li hly-1 = L. innocua CLIP 11262 (hemolysis negative); Li hly-2 = L. innocua FSL S4-378 (hemolysis negative); Li hly+ = L. innocua FSL J1023 (hemolysis positive); Lma = L. marthii FSL S4-120; Lw = L. welshimeri SLCC5334; Liv = L. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis ATCC 49954; Ls hly+= L. seeligeri FSL N1067 (hemolysis positive); Ls hly-= L. seeligeri FSL S4-171 (hemolysis negative).

(p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test). Within the internalin gene
tree (additional file 8), three main clades can be recognized, including (i) a clade containing inlA, inlB, inlC,
inlF, internalin genes found in the inlGHE region and
related internalin genes, (ii) a clade containing inlI and
inlJ, and (iii) a clade of genes encoding mainly uncharacterized internalin-like proteins. None of these three
clades is supported by a significant posterior probability.
We also identified 16 clades (marked in red in additional file 8), all with a significant posterior probability
(>95%), that each contain genes from isolates of both
the L. monocytogenes/L. marthii/L. innocua clade (clade
A, Figure 5) as well as the L. seeligeri/L. ivanovii clade
(clade B, Figure 5), supporting a MRCA that contained
these internalin genes. Although some of these 16 internalin gene clades (e.g., the inlA clade) contained only a
single sequence for one of the two Listeria clades, the
internalin genes found in L. ivanovii and L. seeligeri (i.e.,
clade B) are generally highly divergent from their clade
A homologues (see additional file 8), which supports

presence of these genes in the MRCA as opposed to
introduction by horizontal gene transfer.

Discussion
High quality draft genomes can be obtained through de
novo assembly of short read sequences

The emergence and maturation of next generation
sequencing (NGS) technology, driven in large part by
efforts to develop approaches that allow for completion
of a human genome for $1,000 [61], has made possible
rapid, inexpensive, and high-throughput microbial
whole-genome analysis, which promises to improve
our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis, and our
ability to detect and control infectious diseases. Our
data show that NGS data facilitate de novo assembly
and analyses of bacterial genomes. Although these
draft genomes can have up to thousands of sequence
gaps, the quality of the assembly is sufficient for automated annotation, and subsequent comparative genomics analyses, particularly when studying a conserved

den Bakker et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:688
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/688

group of organisms such as the Listeria species examined here. Thus, NGS represents a feasible approach
for rapid and comprehensive pathogen identification,
subtyping, source tracking, and surveillance [62], and
has the potential to be developed, in the long term,
into routine diagnostic applications. The utility of draft
genomes for identification of candidate vaccine targets
has also been recently demonstrated [63].
The genus Listeria sensu stricto has a pan-genome
characterized by limited introduction of new genetic
material with 2,032 core and 2,918 accessory genes
identified to date

Our data show that the members of the genus Listeria
have a highly conserved genome with limited acquisition, from other gene pools, of homologous and nonhomologous genes, even though horizontal transfer of
homologous genes within and between Listeria species
has clearly been shown to occur [38,64]. Although the
pangenome of the genus Listeria is not closed, there
seems to be very limited on-going introduction of new
genetic material from external gene pools (i.e., other
genera). Data supporting this limited introduction of
new genetic material into the pangenome include (i) the
observation that the core and accessory genes identified
among the 13 genomes analyzed represent a large proportion (i.e., 76.2%) of the predicted pan-genome, (ii)
the similarity in size of observed core genome (2,032
genes) and predicted core genome (1,994 genes), suggesting limited gene loss and deletion, (iii) highly conserved estimated genome size (from 2.8 to 3.2 Mb), (iv)
a relatively small fraction (4% on average) of genes that
have atypical codon usage, and (v) a small number of
prophages and transposons. The fact that most of these
prophages have a codon usage pattern that is similar to
their host indicates that they have co-evolved with their
Listeria hosts [65]. A Listeria pan-genome characterized
by limited introduction of genetic material is also supported by the observation that pan-genome coverage for
the genus Listeria (except L. grayii) is higher than the
pan-genome coverage estimates for most bacterial species, which range from 30% (for Escherichia coli, based
on genomes of 22 strains) to 73% (for Francisella tularensis, based on genomes of 7 strains) [34]. A pan-genome coverage estimate performed for the Bacillus cereus
group, a group of closely related pathogenic and nonpathogenic Gram-positive species, revealed a coverage of
42%, indicating pan-genome coverage of Listeria, is also
high compared to Gram-positive organisms. The Bacillus cereus group, however, can be considered a single
species from a taxonomic perspective [36]. In the case
of Listeria this measure of shared gene content should
not be interpreted to mean that Listeria species are very

Page 15 of 20

closely related and may in fact comprise one species.
On the contrary, the Listeria species have diverged substantially in the primary sequence of their core genes
with an average pair-wise nucleotide identity of 84.8%,
compared to average pair-wise nucleotide identities
within species of 99.2% in F. tularensis [66] and 96.7%
in E. coli [67]. Phillipy et al. [68] predicted a closed pangenome for the species L. monocytogenes, which is congruent with our observations for the complete genus.
The mechanism behind the limited occurrence of gene
acquisition from outside gene pools in Listeria remains
to be determined. Although several strains harbor an
insertion of prophage A118 in the comK open reading
frame, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of
competence, comK is intact in L. marthii, L. innocua
FSL J1-023 and FSL S4-378, and L. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis, as well as the previously sequenced L. monocytogenes F2365 and HCC23 genomes. While most of
the competence related genes are present in all Listeria
genomes [69] and while evidence for homologous
recombination has been detected by multiple studies
[38,64,70], natural competence has not yet been report
for any Listeria strains [11]. Limited natural competence
may thus at least partially explain the low level of gene
acquisition from outside gene pools, particularly since
our data suggest that most listeriophages do are part of
the closed Listeria pangenome. In addition, limited gene
acquisition in the genus Listeria may also be facilitated
by the presence, in all genomes of the genus examined
so far, of well-developed defense system against foreign
DNA/mobile elements, including R-M systems [71] and/
or CRISPR systems [51]. Both systems have been shown
to limit or block horizontal gene transfer in Staphylococcus aureus [72,73]. This would explain why functional
transposable elements are virtually absent from Listeria,
and if present (as is the case for the conjugative elements reported here) contain a putative anti-restriction
gene, which protects them from the restriction modification system.
Despite the overall high conservation of genome content across different Listeria species, gene loss and deletion events, as well as introduction of genetic material
through horizontal gene transfer from other gene pools
occurs in this genus, often with phenotypic consequences. For example, the chromosomal region that
contains inlAB in L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii
appears to be hypervariable with evidence for deletion
events (e.g., in L. seeligeri) and horizontal introduction
of genetic material from other genera (e.g., the presence,
in the L. ivanovii inlAB region, of two ORFs with
relatively high similarity to Enterococcus genes and the
presence, in the inlAB region of L. marthii, of approximately 15 ORFs that were putatively introduced by

den Bakker et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:688
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/688

horizontal gene transfer), consistent with another report
[13] that also suggested putative horizontal gene transfer
events in this region.
While Listeria includes a number of species-like clades,
many of these putative species include subclades or
strains with atypical virulence-associated characteristics
and gene profiles

Generally, within the genus Listeria, only members of the
species L. monocytogenes are considered to be human
pathogens, while members of the species L. ivanovii are
considered to be animal pathogens [7]. Key genes that
clearly contribute to virulence, as supported by experimental evidence, include (i) genes located in the prfA
cluster, which are critical for intracellular survival and
cell to cell spread [17], (ii) inlA and inlB, which are critical for invasion of intestinal epithelial and hepatic cells,
respectively [74], and (iii) inlC, which encodes a protein
that is specifically required for cell-to-cell spread [21].
Strains representing L. monocytogenes lineages I, II, and
III as well as the L. ivanovii subsp. londoniensis strains
contained the full complement of these virulence genes
(i.e., prfA cluster, inlAB, inlC), consistent with the experimentally verified virulence of these organisms [75,76].
Our full genome analyses suggest that the evolution from
a Listeria ancestor that contained all three virulence loci
yielded species and strains that have lost one or more of
these key virulence genes. L. welshimeri, the majority of
L. innocua strains, and non-hemolytic L. seeligeri strains
lack all three of these virulence loci, consistent with their
observed avirulence [22,77].
Other strains are lacking only a subset of the key virulence genes found in most L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii. Hemolytic L. seeligeri carries the prfA cluster, but
lacks inlAB and inlC, consistent with its avirulence in
mammalian tissue culture and animal models [77].
Interestingly, some strains (represented by the hemolytic
L. innocua strain characterized here) contain the prfA
cluster as well as inlA and have the ability to invade
human intestinal epithelial cells, while lacking inlC and
showing avirulence in a mouse model [22]. Similarly, at
least one L. monocytogenes strain (HCC23, representing
lineage IIIA) contains the prfA cluster as well as inlAB,
while lacking inlC and showing avirulence in mouse
infection experiments [78]. These strains represent a
particular challenge for virulence classification, as they
would typically be classified as virulent with standard
assays (as they are hemolytic and positive for some key
virulence genes). Overall, our data, along with previously
reported virulence characterizations of isolates representing different Listeria species as well as atypical
strains (e.g., hemolytic L. innocua) [22-24], clearly indicate the need for a well-designed molecular approach to
define pathogenic strains within the genus Listeria.

Page 16 of 20

While we hypothesize that use of multiple marker
genes, e.g., genes in the prfA cluster, inlA (including
identification of virulence attenuating premature stop
codons [53]), inlB, and inlC is needed to identify virulent strains, further tissue culture and animal studies are
needed to confirm appropriate marker genes. In addition, further comparative genomics studies of phenotypically variable Listeria will be needed to identify and
validate diagnostic targets and markers.
The genus Listeria represents two main clades that
diverged from a common ancestor that contained the
prfA cluster and a number of internalin genes, most likely
47 million years ago

The use of 100 core genes that have been previously
shown to show no evidence for positive selection nor
homologous recombination resulted in a robust phylogeny dividing Listeria (except L. grayi) into two main
clades; (i) a clade consisting of L. monocytogenes, L.
marthii, L. innocua and L. welshimeri, and (ii) a clade
consisting of L. ivanovii and L. seeligeri. The existence
of two main clades has been shown in several previous
studies [3,8,23], however the placement of L. welshimeri
has always been ambiguous. While some studies placed
L. welshimeri basal in the L. seeligeri/L. ivanovii clade
[3], others [8,23], like the majority of the phylogenetic
reconstruction methods used here, place L. welshimeri
basal in the L. monocytogenes/L. marthii/L. innocua
clade. A likely explanation for this ambiguous phylogenetic placement is the “long branch attraction effect”
[79] as L. welshimeri is placed on a long branch and
seems to have branched off of the MRCA of the L.
monocytogenes/L. marthii/L. innocua clade relatively
early during the evolutionary of Listeria sensu stricto.
As likelihood-based methods are less prone to long
branch attraction [79], placement, by these methods, of
L. welshimeri in the L. monocytogenes/L. marthii/L.
innocua clade suggests that this placement is correct.
Our data also seem to support a hypothesis that the
most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Listeria possessed not only the prfA virulence cluster as indicated
before [3], but also many internalins including A, B and
C, which are essential for host invasion [20] and cell-tocell spread [21]. While a few studies [19] have previously explored the evolution of internalin multigene
family, including one study [19] that proposed presence
of inlB in the MRCA of Listeria (except L. grayii), our
analysis allowed for identification of 16 internalin genes
that, like inlB, were likely present in the MRCA of Listeria sensu stricto.
Based on a Bayesian molecular clock analysis that used
100 genes of the Listeria core genome places, we propose that the MRCA of the genus Listeria (except
L. grayii) can be dated to about 40 to 60 mya, similar to

den Bakker et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:688
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/688

the date has been inferred for the most recent ancestor
of S. enterica and S. bongori [80]. A plausible hypothesis
for emergence of these pathogens during this time period is that a major mammalian radiation during this
same epoch [81] provided strains of Listeria and Salmonella that were able to colonize mammalian hosts with
a selective advantage over less adapted or environmental
strains.
Loss of virulence associated genes is a recurrent
evolutionary pattern in Listeria

While a number of studies have reported that gene
loss and genome reduction are general patterns in the
evolutionary transition from facultative pathogenic lifestyles to obligate pathogenic lifestyles in bacteria [82],
our data suggest that gene loss events in multiple
genomic regions and lineages coincided with multiple
evolutionary transitions of Listeria from a facultative
pathogenic lifestyle to an obligate saprotrophic lifestyle.
The switch from a facultative pathogen to obligate
saprotrophic clades seems to have occurred at least
four times during the evolutionary history of Listeria
sensu stricto, including (i) during the speciation event
leading to L. seeligeri, which coincided with the loss of
the inlAB operon and inlC, but not the prfA cluster,
(ii) the speciation event leading to L. welshimeri, which
coincided with loss of the prfA cluster, the inlAB
operon and inlC, (iii) the speciation event leading to L.
innocua, which coincided with the loss of inlB and
inlC and (iv) the speciation event leading to L. marthii,
which coincided with the loss of the prfA cluster, the
inlAB operon and inlC. Secondary losses of additional
virulence-associated genes occurred in the non-hemolytic L. seeligeri, which lost the prfA cluster, and nonhemolytic L. innocua strains, which lost the prfA cluster as well as inlA.
Despite the observation that loss of virulence genes
appears to be a key event in the evolution of Listeria
species, several apparently avirulent Listeria strains
(hemolytic L. seeligeri strains and hemolytic L. innocua
strains) have strongly conserved, and in most cases
functional, homologues of key L. monocytogenes virulence genes in their genomes. For example, previous studies [83] demonstrated some functionality of different L.
seeligeri virulence factors and our data suggest that the
homologue of internalin A in the hemolytic L. innocua
strain supports the ability to invade human intestinal
epithelial cells (even though future experiments with an
isogenic inlA mutant will be required to confirm this).
One hypothesis is that the virulence genes in Listeria
play a role in the survival of and defense against predation by protists, however this hypothesis is not supported by a recent study that demonstrates that L.

monocytogenes does not survive ingestion by the amoeba
Acanthamoeba polyphaga [84].

Conclusions
In order to gain an improved understanding of genome
evolution in members of the genus Listeria, with a particular attention to the evolution of virulence, we generated draft genomes for seven Listeria strains focusing on
species for which genome sequences were not previously
available and atypical strains of species for which genome sequences were available (i.e., L. monocytogenes
lineage IIIC and hemolytic L. innocua). Analysis of 13
genome sequences representing six Listeria species
(including the 7 genome sequences obtained here and 6
previously reported genome sequences) suggests that (i)
the genus Listeria possesses an open pan-genome with
limited ongoing introduction of new genetic material,
(ii) modern pathogenic and non-pathogenic Listeria species originated, approx. 40-60 mya, from a common
ancestor that contained the prfA cluster and at least 16
internalin genes, and (iii) gene loss events played a key
role in the evolution of Listeria. While diversification
over this time period yielded a number of species-like
clades in the genus Listeria, many of these putative species include clades or strains with atypical virulence
characteristics and gene profiles. This information will
be critical for the development of genetic and genomic
criteria for pathogenic strains, including development of
assays that specifically target pathogenic Listeria strains
regardless of species classification.
