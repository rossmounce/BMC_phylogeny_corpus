Abstract
Background: Although bivalves are among the most-studied marine organisms because of their
ecological role and economic importance, very little information is available on the genome
sequences of oyster species. This report documents three large-scale cDNA sequencing projects
for the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas initiated to provide a large number of expressed sequence
tags that were subsequently compiled in a publicly accessible database. This resource allowed for
the identification of a large number of transcripts and provides valuable information for ongoing

investigations of tissue-specific and stimulus-dependant gene expression patterns. These data are
crucial for constructing comprehensive DNA microarrays, identifying single nucleotide
polymorphisms and microsatellites in coding regions, and for identifying genes when the entire
genome sequence of C. gigas becomes available.
Description: In the present paper, we report the production of 40,845 high-quality ESTs that
identify 29,745 unique transcribed sequences consisting of 7,940 contigs and 21,805 singletons. All
of these new sequences, together with existing public sequence data, have been compiled into a
publicly-available
Website
http://public-contigbrowser.sigenae.org:9090/Crassostrea_gigas/
index.html. Approximately 43% of the unique ESTs had significant matches against the SwissProt
database and 27% were annotated using Gene Ontology terms. In addition, we identified a total of
208 in silico microsatellites from the ESTs, with 173 having sufficient flanking sequence for primer
design. We also identified a total of 7,530 putative in silico, single-nucleotide polymorphisms using
existing and newly-generated EST resources for the Pacific oyster.
Conclusion: A publicly-available database has been populated with 29,745 unique sequences for
the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. The database provides many tools to search cleaned and
assembled ESTs. The user may input and submit several filters, such as protein or nucleotide hits,
to select and download relevant elements. This database constitutes one of the most developed
genomic resources accessible among Lophotrochozoans, an orphan clade of bilateral animals.
These data will accelerate the development of both genomics and genetics in a commerciallyimportant species with the highest annual, commercial production of any aquatic organism.

Background
Genome research on the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas,
has been facilitated by the recent development of speciesspecific tools such as linkage maps [1,2], large-insert
libraries [3], a public clearing-house [4], and gene expression profiles [5-7]. Several factors motivate further development of genomic resources for C. gigas: (I) Because this
species has the highest annual production of any aquatic
organism, C. gigas has been the subject of a great deal of
research to elucidate the molecular basis underlying the
physiological and genetic mechanisms of economicallyrelevant traits. (II) The Pacific oyster's phylogenic position
in the Lophotrochozoa, an understudied clade of bilaterian animals, makes molecular data on C. gigas highly relevant for studies of genome evolution. (III) Oysters play
an important role as sentinels in estuarine and coastal
marine habitats where increasing human activities exacerbate the impacts of disease and stress in exploited populations. (IV) C. gigas can be an invasive species when
introduced into new habitats [8]. As a result, the Pacific
oyster is becoming an attractive model species for
genome-related research activities focusing on comparative immunology [e.g. [9-11]], disease ecology [e.g. [1214]], stress response to pollutants and parasites [e.g. [15]],
developmental and reproductive physiology [e.g. [16,17]]
and evolutionary genetics [e.g. [18-20]].
The genomic strategies currently employed for the identification of novel and previously-characterized genes
affecting phenotypes of interest in the Pacific oyster

include the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL),
and high-throughput studies of gene expression [21]. QTL
mapping of genetic variation affecting, for example, resistance to summer mortality [22] or hybrid vigor [6] requires
a large number of mapped molecular markers and testing
for associations between marker genotypes and phenotypes to identify chromosomal regions harbouring genes
that directly affect the trait of interest. Recently developed
BAC libraries and fingerprinting [3] (P. Gaffney, Pers.
Com.), have facilitated fine mapping of such regions, and
ultimately specification of marker position on the genetic
linkage map, allowing gene-assisted selection. Functional
genomic approaches are also required for gene-expression
profiling experiments such as macroarrays [17], microarrays [7], SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression), MPSS
(Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing) [6], or technologies addressing single genes, such RT-qPCR (real-time
quantitative PCR). These techniques have potential applications in ecological monitoring [23], evaluating oyster
broodstock for selective breeding and understanding of
gene regulation involved, for example, in the molecular
pathways associated with responses to stress or pathogens.
In the present paper, we report the generation and analysis of 47,889 ESTs by sequencing clones from the Network
of Excellence "Marine Genomics Europe" (MGE) normalized gonad cDNA library (partially published in [24]),
and two other projects: I) the Genoscope project (CEA
Evry, France) and II) the European Aquafirst project

(Table 1). The objective of the Genoscope project (EST
sequencing from Crassostrea gigas) was to substantially
expand genomic information on oysters by sequencing
ESTs from: (I) a normalized "hemocyte" cDNA library
constructed with mRNA from bacteria-challenged and
unchallenged hemocytes, and (II) ESTs from an "all developmental stages and Central Nervous System (CNS)" normalized cDNA library derived from mRNA extracted from
all embryonic and larval stages, as well as from adult visceral ganglia. The European "Aquafirst" project that uses
genetic and functional genomic approaches to develop
summer mortality resistance markers in oysters, produced
ESTs by suppression subtractive hybridization between
Resistant and Sensitive oyster lines in six different tissues
[25]. To maximize the utility of these collections, ESTs
from all of these efforts, together with those in public
databases (e.g. [26]), have been assembled in a unique
public database: the GigasDatabase http://public-contig
browser.sigenae.org:9090/Crassostrea_gigas/index.html
containing 29,745 unique sequences.
This resource is highly valuable for identifying important
gene networks controlling physiological processes, it facilitates the development of molecular markers for the construction of a reference genetic map, and it allows largescale, expression-profiling experiments using microarrays.
These tools will be useful to advance our knowledge of the
genetic and physiological bases of development, reproduction, immunology, and associated processes that are
important for oyster aquaculture. Finally, this work will

be very useful for the annotation phase of the entire oyster
genome, the principal objective of an international community of oyster biologists [27] that will provide a critical
point of comparison for understanding the early diversification of animals and their genome, as has been recently
proposed for the gastropod snail Lottia gigantea http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/Lotgi1/Lotgi1.home.html.

Construction and content
1. Biological samples
1.1. Resistant and Sensitive oysters for the subtractive libraries
Resistant (R) and Susceptible (S) oyster families were produced, through divergent selection for high or low survival of summer mortality, as fully described previously
[25]. After completing rearing of oysters through larval
development in the IFREMER hatchery in La Tremblade
(France, July 2004), we transferred juvenile oysters to the
nursery of Bouin (Vendée, France) until March 2005,
when the oysters were deployed in the field at Fort Espagnol (South Brittany, France). We collected samples of
gonad, muscle, digestive gland, hemocytes, mantle-edge,
and gills from 12 R and 12 S oysters on two dates (May 25
and June 6, 2005) and individual tissues from each line
were pooled at each sampling date.
1.2. Biological material for the "all developmental stages and central
nervous system" cDNA library
Mature, wild oysters, collected on the Atlantic coast of
Brittany (France), were spawned and reared in captivity as
described in [28]. From this pool, we sampled various

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:341

developmental stages, which we identified microscopically: oocytes before fertilization, 4-cell and 8-cell
embryos (1 and 2 hours post-fertilization [hpf], respectively), morula (3 hpf), blastula (5 hpf), gastrula (7 hpf),
trochophore larvae (16 hpf) and D-larvae (2 days post-fertilization [dpf]), early veliger larvae (7 dpf), later veliger
larvae (14 dpf), pediveliger larvae (18 dpf), and spat after
metamorphosis (27 dpf). We extracted total mRNA from
one million oysters from each developmental stage from
oocyte to trochophore, and 250,000 from later stages, and
from the visceral ganglia microscopically dissected from
10 wild, adult oysters
1.3. Biological material for "hemocytes" cDNA library
We sampled hemocytes from six adult oysters exposed to
each of 24 experimental conditions (total n = 144), all
combinations of four kinds of bacterial challenge, two
times post-challenge, and oysters collected from three
geographic origins: Atlantic coast (La Tremblade), Normandie (Bay des Veys) and Mediterranean Sea (Thau
lagoon). We performed the bacterial challenges by
immersing oysters in seawater containing (I) live, non-virulent Micrococcus luteus and Vibrio tasmaniensis (2.5 × 108
bacteria/L for each strain), (II) live, virulent Vibrio splendidus (5 × 108 bacteria/L), (III) a mix of heat-killed, virulent Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio aesturianaus (2.5 × 108
bacteria/L for each strain) and (IV) unchallenged oysters.
For each condition, we collected hemolymph at 22 and 24
h post challenge from the pericardial cavity through the
adductor muscle. We isolated hemocytes separately from
these samples (24 experimental conditions) by centrifugation at 700 g for 10 min (4 C) and discarded the plasma.
Hemocytes were further subjected to several experimental
procedures (see below).
2. RNA preparation
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL)
at a concentration of 1 ml/30 mg of tissue. For SSH experiments and hemocyte samples, we isolated polyadenylated RNA using the Quickprep micro mRNA
purification kit (Amersham). We measured RNA concentration with a spectrophotometer at 260 nm using the
conversion factor 1 OD = 40 μg/ml RNA, and RNA quality
was determined using a Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent).
3. cDNA library construction and sequencing of the clones
3.1. Construction of subtractive libraries
The mRNA from each pool of tissue RNA (6 tissues in
total) was used as the template for SSH following the PCRselect cDNA subtraction kit procedure (Clontech).
Hybridization and subtraction steps were carried out in
both directions, i.e. for forward subtraction the Resistant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/341

(R) sample (tester) was subtracted from the Susceptible
(S) sample (driver) and vice versa for reverse subtraction.
The PCR products from both subtractions were cloned
into pCR 2.1® TOPO plasmid using TOP10 One Shot ®
competent cells for transformation (Invitrogen).
3.2. Construction of "all Developmental stages and central nervous
system" cDNA library
Total RNA (0.3 μg) from a pool of various developmental
stages and visceral ganglia was used for ds cDNA synthesis
and amplification using the SMART approach. Recovered
cDNA was equalized using the Duplex-Specific nuclease
(DSN)-based normalization method [29]. Efficiency of
normalization was measured by real-time PCR. A severe
decrease (shift of 11 amplification cycles) in actin relative
copy number was measured in the normalized cDNA
sample, when compared to the non normalized sample.
Resulting, normalized cDNA was then amplified, directionally cloned into pAL17.3 plasmid (Evrogen, Moscow), and was used to transform the XL1-Blue E. coli strain
(Stratagene) to generate a cDNA library of 5 × 105 independent clones.
3.3 Construction of oyster "hemocytes" cDNA library
The cDNA library was built by GATC Biotech AG (Germany). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA, composed of equimolar
concentrations from oyster hemocytes from each of the 24
experimental conditions, was used for ds cDNA synthesis.
The normalization method consisted of denaturation and
controlled, incomplete reassociation of double-stranded
cDNA, followed by selective cloning of the cDNA corresponding to the single-stranded, normalized fraction. Efficiency of normalization was measured by nonradioactive, Reverse Northern blot analysis of normalized
and non-normalized cDNA. Briefly, an array containing
96 randomly-selected clones derived from the non-normalized cDNA library was hybridized with normalized
and non-normalized cDNA. Comparison of homogenization of hybridization signals from the normalized probe
to the non-normalized probe indicated the efficiency of
normalization (data not shown). Normalized cDNA was
then amplified, directionally cloned into pBluescriptIISK(+) plasmid (Stratagene), and was used to transform E.
coli XL1-BlueMRF' (Stratagene) to generate a normalized
cDNA library of 8.3 × 104 independent clones.
3.4. Sequencing
For subtracted libraries and the normalized cDNA gonad
library [24], the clones were sequenced at the Max Planck
Institute platform (Berlin, Germany) using an ABI 3730
automatic capillary sequencer, the ABI Big Dye Terminator sequencing kit and universal primer. For the two other

Page 4 of 15

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:341

normalized cDNA libraries, sequencing was performed at
the Genoscope facility (CEA Evry, France) as described
above.
4. Database, sequence processing and contig assembly
The data files produced were processed by SIGENAE; documentation of procedures is available on the SIGENAE
website http://www.sigenae.org/index.php?id=9. The
resource data flow has been compiled in the GigasDatabase
http://public-contigbrowser.sigenae.org:9090/
Crassostrea_gigas/download, as shown in Figure 1.

The sequences were first cleaned up from vector and adaptator sequences. Repeats and contaminants were removed
by comparison with several sequence databases such as
Univec, Yeast and E. coli genomes. The PolyA site was
identified by its relative position to the vector multiplecloning site. In the 30 bases preceding the polyA site, we
searched for putative polyadenylation signals (AATAAA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/341

and ATTAAA) [30]. Valid sequences, that had a PHRED
score over 20 on at least 100 bp, were submitted to the
EMBL-EBI Nucleotide Sequence database http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/. Because of the large number of
sequences, we used a two-step process to assemble these
sequences into contigs. The first step built clusters of
sequences sharing at least 75 bp with an identity rate of
96% using MegaBlast [31]. The second step constructed
coherent contigs from the previous clusters using CAP3
[32], at the recommended stringency of 40 bp overlap
with 90% sequence identity. Once the contigs were built
and their annotation completed, all data were loaded in a
locally-adapted Ensembl database.
To obtain as much information as possible concerning the
contigs, we performed similarity searches with BlastX
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi using a variety of
databases: UniProt/SwissProt, UniProt/TrEMBL, ProDom
(protein domains), UniGene Human Clusters, UniGene
taxon specific Clusters, TIGR Taxon Specific Clusters,
Ensembl specific transcripts (cDNA), and other Sigenae
Contigs. We then loaded the annotations into the GigasDatabase. We identified putative open-reading frames
(ORFs) by choosing the longest possible translation into
amino acid sequence, using Emboss sixpack http://
bioweb2.pasteur.fr/docs/EMBOSS/sixpack.html.
Sequences with ORFs smaller than 100 codons (300 bp)
were removed from the dataset.
5. Gene ontology annotation
To link ESTs with BlastX hits with putative function, we
annotated all of them according to gene ontology (GO)
terms by using the program KAAS (KEGG Automatic
Annotation Server: http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/),
which provides functional annotation of genes by Blast
comparisons (single best hit) against the manually
curated KEGG Genes database [33]. The top level consists
of the following categories: metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing,
and cellular processes. The second level divides these
functional categories into finer sub-categories [34]. The
distribution of genes in each of the main ontology categories was examined, and the percentages of unique
sequence in each of the assigned GO terms were computed.

resources of the GigasDatabase includes cleaning processes,
batch statistics, assembling sequences into contigs, annotation of the contigs, visualization of the contigs, and summary
statistics concerning each library.

6. in silico mining of microsatellites and SNPs
We searched a set of 56,327 unique sequences for microsatellite
markers
using
SRR
finder
(http://
www.maizemap.org/bioinformatics/SSRFINDER/
SSR_Finder_Download.html; [35]) with a minimum
repeat of 4. This provided a table of raw data which was
then exported to MS Excel® to calculate the number of di-

, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide repeats, their respective lengths,
and starting positions. Putative SNPs were detected using
the Pupasuite v1.0 (http://pupasuite.bioinfo.cipf.es/,
[36]). The 56,327 ESTs were assembled in 7,940 contigs
wherein putative SNPs were identified and characterized
to calculate the percentage of each type of mutation (ts/tv,
synonymous/non-synonymous).

Utility and discussion
1. Generation of ESTs
To augment the 1894 recently-published sequences from
the normalized cDNA libraries produced by the "Marine
Genomic Europe" program [24], we sequenced a novel
part of the gonad library. In addition, we also constructed
two new, directionally-cloned, normalized oyster cDNA
libraries: one including all developmental stages from
embryos to larvae and visceral ganglia, and one from bacteria-challenged and unchallenged hemocytes. Singlepass sequencing produced sequences from the 5' regions
of mRNA from each library, resulting in 12,162
sequences, 13,191 sequences, and 14,472 sequences,
respectively (Table 1).

Finally, to increase the number of genes characterized that
are related to summer mortality [13,14,17], we constructed libraries from six different tissues (digestive
gland, mantle-edge, hemocytes, gonad, muscle, and gills)
using Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH)
between selectively-bred Resistant (R) and Sensitive (S)
oyster lines [25], by subtracting in both directions (R-S
and S-R). These SSH libraries produced of a total of 8,064
sequences, with approximately 1,000 sequences per
library (Table 1). All 47,889 sequences were subjected to
pre-processing to eliminate poor-quality sequences and
remove cloning-vector sequences. After removing clones
with very short inserts or no inserts, and those with poor
sequence quality, we obtained a total of 40,845 (85.3%)
high-quality ESTs with an average length of 413 bp (Table
1). All EST sequences have been deposited in GenBank
with the accession numbers [AM857416-AM869575] for
gonad library, [CU998430–CU999999; FP000001–
FP012228] for hemocyte library, [CU983906–

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/341

CU998429] for developmental stages and visceral ganglia
library, and [CU681473–CU681818; CU682012–
CU683068–CU683823;
CU683828–
CU682338;
CU683864; CU684729–CU686587; FP89705–FP89949]
for the SSH libraries.
2. Contig assembly of the ESTs
The GigasDatabase http://public-contigbrowser.sige
nae.org:9090/Crassostrea_gigas/index.html has been
used for sequence processing, contig assembly, annotation, and project data hosting. All sequences, including
public EST and mRNA sequences, as well as other data
and results, can be accessed through the database. After
assembly of the 40,845 new, valid ESTs and the 9,548
published sequences from GenBank into contigs, the
database consists of 7,940 contigs and 21,805 singletons
(Table 2). Thus, the GigasDatabase now contains 29,745
unique sequences from C. gigas with an average length of
798 bp (Table 2). As the NCBI actually contains 1325
sequences of C. gigas in the "nucleotide section", the
release of these newly-generated ESTs will consequently
improve the knowledge of sequences for this species.

Of the 7,940 contigs, 4,208 contained 2 ESTs (53%),
1,588 contained 3 ESTs (20%), 794 contained 4 ESTs
(10%), 397 contained 5 ESTs (5%), and relatively few
sequences contained more than 6 ESTs (11%) (Table 3).
These results indicate that most of the clusters were small,
reflecting a high efficiency in normalization of the cDNA
libraries.
A graphical user interface permits the visualization of the
data with different views, such as "ContigView" which
gives a graphical overview of the contig structure and similarity annotations. Each sequence or similarity feature is
represented as a line. The color of the line gives an indication of the type of sequence and all lines are described on
the left of each panel (Figure 2).
3. Putative identities of ESTs
To determine the putative identities of the assembled contig and singleton sequences, we performed BlastX similar-

ity searches on several protein databases. Of the 29,745
unique sequences, 12,790 (43%) had significant matches
(E-value < 10-6) in the non-redundant protein database.
This might be considered as low and due to ESTs within 3'
untranslated regions (UTR) that can not be matched to
protein sequences, and to the relatively short sequences
(about 360 bp) obtained from the SSH libraries. Efforts
should be made to generate complete cDNA sequences in
C. gigas to provide a greater level of assessment of this
organism's gene contents and similarities to various other
species in the evolutionary spectrum. The complete list of
these annotated sequences is reported in Additional File 1.
All annotation data have been organized in the userfriendly GigasDatabase using "BioMart", which provides
several tools to search cleaned and assembled ESTs. The
user may input and submit several filters, such as contig
names, EST names, protein hits, nucleotide hits, tissues of
expression, as well as keywords, to the server using the
web interface, as presented in Figure 3. Once the filters
have been selected, it is also possible to select elements for
the output files by checking the corresponding boxes in
the output data blocks, as shown in Figure 4.
4. Gene ontology annotation
More-detailed, functional annotation was performed with
BlastX using KAAS (KEGG Automatic Annotation Server:
http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/). GO categories were
successfully assigned to 7,733 (26%) unique ESTs. This
low percentage of GO assignment has also been reported
previously in C. gigas [24] and is probably linked to a high
level of amino-acid sequence divergence between marine
bivalves and the reference taxa currently used in genomics
(such as Drosophila (FlyBase) and Caenorhabditis (WormBase)), and also to the relatively small average length of
the ORFs. Table 4 shows the percentage distribution of
gene ontology terms among the 7,733 annotated ESTs.
The largest number of annotated sequences was found for
a final GO term "Metabolism," which represents 42% of
the annotated ESTs among all GO categories. Within this
category, the higher GO terms were Amino Acid, Carbohy-

drate and Lipid Metabolism, with 8, 7.6 and 6.3% of the
annotated ESTs, respectively. For "Genetic Information
Processing", 4.3 and 4.8% of the annotated ESTs were
associated with translation and folding, and sorting degradation respectively. Many ESTs (10.7%) were linked to
signal transduction, in the "Environmental Information
Processing" category. Finally, Cell Communication
(7.0%), Endocrine System (7.9%), and Immune System
(4.9%) were the most abundant "Cellular Processes" subterms.
Among these different subcategories of GO, several ESTs
potentially connected to physiological functions of the
oyster linked with our subset of interest have been discovered (Table 5). For example, for TGFβ signaling regulating
a variety of important processes, two new ligands, activin/
myostatin and inhibin-like (Table 5), were identified that
complete the already-large panel of ligands in C. gigas
[11,37,38]. Indeed, the identification of new, potential
members of the TGFβ superfamily contributes to the TGFβ
signaling pathway being recognized as one of the bestcharacterized systems at the molecular level within lophotrochozoans.
Concerning the allocation of energy to reproduction,
which may play a crucial role in the ability of oysters to
survive summer mortality [13,17], relevant genes potentially involved in the signaling pathway linking reproduction to energy balance have been retrieved, such as ESTs
encoding PI3-kinase catalytic subunit beta enzyme (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase beta, Table 5), leptin receptor,
adiponectin-like (ovary-specific c1q-like factor, c1q-like
adipose specific protein, Table 5) and a neuropeptide Y
ligand (Table 5). Such signaling molecules were recently
identified in vertebrates and have important regulatory
effects on reproduction [39,40]. For example, leptin and
adiponectin were reported to promote fecundity and the
growth of germinal cells by increasing the utilization of
oxidizable sources. At the opposite, neuropeptide Y inhibits reproduction when energy storage is deficient [41,42].
Finally, concerning the innate immunity of C. gigas, new
immune-system components have been identified,
including signal-transduction elements, LPS binding proteins, antimicrobial peptides, and various protease inhibitors. In particular, a new component of the NF-κB
pathway [43], a Toll receptor-like protein, has been
sequenced. The most significant feature of the NF-κB
pathway is the central role of the NF-κB family in transcriptional activator proteins, ubiquitously expressed and
involved in wide variety of biological processes, including
inflammation, cell proliferation and differentiation in
mammals, as well as development in insects [44].

Further functional studies will be necessary, however, to
demonstrate the involvement of these annotated ESTs in
the different physiological processes of C. gigas. Indeed,
this work encourages the use of functional studies, such as
RNA interference [45], to ascertain the functions of these
genes.
5. in silico markers
We identified a total of 208 in silico microsatellites among
the 29,745 unique EST sequences. Most microsatellites
were dinucleotide repeats (158) followed by trinucleotides (22) (Table 6 and Additional File 2 for more
details). Of the 208 EST-containing microsatellites, only
25 (12%) have significant matches with available ESTs in
the NCBI non redundant database whereas 173 (83.2%)
have sufficient flanking sequences for primer design.
From these, we have recently developed 18 microsatellite
markers [22] and have successfully used them for genetic

linkage mapping and QTL analysis. Many potentially-useful microsatellites, identified in silico, still need to be
developed to become useful polymorphic markers for
comparative mapping, marker-assisted selection, and evolutionary studies [46]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) have recently become the marker type of choice
for linkage and QTL analysis [47]. In most cases, SNPs
have relied upon genomic sequencing, BAC end sequencing, or targeted SNP detection. We identified a total of
7,530 putative SNPs, including 1,344 non-synonymous
and 5,097 synonymous mutations, and 1,089 indels
(Table 7). These SNPs represent an average of 1 SNP per
75 base pairs, slightly lower than the previously-reported
frequency of one SNP every 60 base pairs in coding
regions [19,48], but higher than in C. virginica, with one
SNP for every 170 base pairs [49]. These SNPs will also be
useful for linkage mapping and population-level studies,
and a few to detect selective effects in coding regions of

genes regulated by environmental factors. To provide
some assessment of the SNPs, the putative SNPs were categorized based upon contig sizes. As mentioned in a previous report [49], the larger the number of sequences
involved in a contig, the more likely the SNP can be
checked as to whether the putative SNPs represent
sequence errors or real SNPs. As shown in Table 8, 2,077
putative SNPs were identified from contigs with only two
sequences; 1,358 putative SNPs were identified from contigs with three sequences; 1,044 putative SNPs were identified from contigs with four sequences, and 3,051
putative SNPs were identified from contigs with five or
more sequences (Table 8). Consequently, validation and
polymorphism analyses must be performed before these
putative SNPs can be used because a large proportion of

SNPs were identified from contigs with just a few
sequences and may be sequencing errors.

Conclusion
In the present paper, we report the production and the
sequencing of clones from 9 cDNA libraries derived from
different C. gigas tissues, and from oysters sampled under
different conditions, obtaining 40,845 high-quality ESTs
that identify 29,745 unique transcribed sequences. Putative annotation was assigned to 43% of the sequences
showing similarity to known genes, mostly from other
species, in one or more of the databases used for automatic annotation. The high percentage of C. gigas ESTs
(57%) with no hits in the protein database implies that
there is an enormous potential for discovery of new genes

genomic resources for oysters. Indeed, Crassostrea gigas,
which belongs to the Lophotrochozoans, a large but
understudied clade of bilaterian animals, represents a rare
non-model species for which the genomic resources available will be very important. Several research teams are
now using this important sequence information to examine oyster gene-expression profiles under various experimental and environmental conditions.
