Abstract
Background: The dystroglycan (DG) complex is a major non-integrin cell adhesion system whose
multiple biological roles involve, among others, skeletal muscle stability, embryonic development
and synapse maturation. DG is composed of two subunits: α-DG, extracellular and highly
glycosylated, and the transmembrane β-DG, linking the cytoskeleton to the surrounding basement
membrane in a wide variety of tissues. A single copy of the DG gene (DAG1) has been identified so
far in humans and other mammals, encoding for a precursor protein which is post-translationally
cleaved to liberate the two DG subunits. Similarly, D. rerio (zebrafish) seems to have a single copy
of DAG1, whose removal was shown to cause a severe dystrophic phenotype in adult animals,
although it is known that during evolution, due to a whole genome duplication (WGD) event, many
teleost fish acquired multiple copies of several genes (paralogues).
Results: Data mining of pufferfish (T. nigroviridis and T. rubripes) and other teleost fish (O. latipes
and G. aculeatus) available nucleotide sequences revealed the presence of two functional paralogous
DG sequences. RT-PCR analysis proved that both the DG sequences are transcribed in T.
nigroviridis. One of the two DG sequences harbours an additional mini-intronic sequence, 137 bp
long, interrupting the uncomplicated exon-intron-exon pattern displayed by DAG1 in mammals and
D. rerio. A similar scenario emerged also in D. labrax (sea bass), from whose genome we have cloned
and sequenced a new DG sequence that also harbours a shorter additional intronic sequence of
116 bp. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of DG protein products in all the species
analysed including two teleost Antarctic species (T. bernacchii and C. hamatus).
Conclusion: Our evolutionary analysis has shown that the whole-genome duplication event in the
Class Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish) involved also DAG1. We unravelled new important molecular
genetic details about fish orthologous DGs, which might help to increase the current knowledge
on DG expression, maturation and targeting and on its physiopathological role in higher organisms.

Background
Dystroglycan (DG) is a cell surface adhesion complex,
originally isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle, representing the pivotal element of a multimeric complex defined
as dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). In mammals
DAG1 possesses an uncomplicated exon-intron-exon
structure, and its transcription and translation generates a
precursor protein that is post-translationally cleaved into
two noncovalently associated subunits: the highly glycosylated extracellular α-DG and the transmembrane β-DG
[1]. The DG subunits are believed to establish a molecular
bridge linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton
[2]. In skeletal muscle and in a wide variety of tissues αDG binds extracellular matrix molecules, such as laminins, agrins and perlecan, and interacts non covalently
with β-DG, that binds dystrophin via its cytoplasmic tail
[3]. Several cDNA sequences, which in most cases correspond to a highly conserved protein product 895 aa long,
have been reported in different organisms such as human,
mouse, dog, amphibia and fish DGs. The degree of
sequence identity among mammals is remarkably high (>
90%), while the recently identified cDNA sequences of X.
laevis and D. rerio (zebrafish) confirm that a very high
degree of similarity is found also in lower vertebrate species [4,5].
DG is believed to have an increasingly important role in
human health, being involved in pathological processes
ranging from cancer progression to infective diseases [6].
In particular, in human skeletal muscle DG, as well as several proteins belonging to the DGC (like dystrophin and
sarcoglycans), is involved in severe forms of muscular diseases [7]. On the other hand, until now there are no
reports about muscular diseases directly generated by
DAG1 mutations (primary dystroglycanopathies), not
surprisingly since the DG knockout experiment in mice
causes an early arrest of the embryonic development (at
day 6.5), due to the disruption of the Reichert's membrane [8]. However, in particular muscular diseases,
known as congenital dystrophies (Muscle-Eye-Brain disease, MEB; Fukuyama Congenital Muscular Dystrophy,
FCMD; Walker-Warburg Syndrome, WWS), mutations in
different genes encoding for glycosyltransferases are
regarded to generate an abnormal glycosylation of α-DG
[9-11]. This alteration of the glycosylation pattern of αDG compromises its binding to extracellular matrix molecules and it is thought to be the reason for the progressive
muscle fibre degeneration; this kind of human congenital
disorders have been defined as "secondary dystroglycanopathies" [12].
In the last years, a large body of knowledge originated
from comparative biochemical and physiological studies
about dystroglycan and the dystrophin glycoprotein complex in D. rerio [5,13-15], which showed that DG indeed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/34

plays a crucial role for adult skeletal muscle stability [5].
With the aim of carrying out an expanded genetic and biochemical comparative analysis, we examined DAG1 from
several fish species; besides D. labrax (sea bass) and D.
rerio (zebrafish), we also analysed pufferfish characterized
by compact genomes (T. nigroviridis and T. rubripes), other
teleosts such as O. latipes (medaka) and G. aculeatus (stickleback), and Antarctic species (T. bernacchii and C. hamatus). So far it was generically assumed that all vertebrate
species would share only one copy of DAG1, even if a
whole genome duplication (WGD) event, involving a
large number of genes, has been described in Actinopterygii [16].
Although a DG gene duplication event has not been identified in D. rerio [5], our computer mining of genomic
data available for pufferfish indicates that two different
DG sequences are present. Accordingly, via the analysis of
DNAs (and cDNAs) from T. nigroviridis, we identified two
functional paralogous DG sequences, hereinafter defined
as DAG1a and DAG1b. Moreover, for the first time we
have cloned and sequenced DAG1 in sea bass (D. labrax),
showing that it contains an additional mini-intronic
sequence of about 150 bp, which is properly spliced out
upon transcription.

Results
Analysis of DAG1a and DAG1b sequences
Two paralogous genomic DNA sequences, for T. rubripes
and T. nigroviridis respectively, were found at the Ensembl
database http://www.ensembl.org already catalogued as
DAG1 under the GenBank accession numbers reported in
Table 1. In the same databank other DG sequences were
also found for O. latipes and G. aculeatus. Using the program ClustalW, we have obtained a multiple alignment of
the newly identified fish DG sequences together with
those from human and mouse (Fig. 1). In addition, we
have reported (Table 2) the reciprocal scores originating
from the ClustalW alignment in Fig. 1, from which it can
be seen that the similarity is higher between the orthologues of DAG1a or DAG1b proteins that between paralogous DG proteins within the same species (Table 2).

The T. rubripes DAG1a is 5674 bp long, starting from the
putative transcription start site up to the stop codon, and
consists of three exons separated by two introns. The same
structure is present in T. nigrovoridis DAG1a, although
the 5' region has not yet been clearly annotated in the
Ensembl database. The 5' region of G. aculeatus DAG1a
gene is still partially defined as well, even if we have been
able to recognize the typical "exon2-mini-intron-exon3"
structure. This arrangement is also present in O. latipes
DAG1a, although a peculiar feature of this gene is its very
long second intron spanning ≈ 22 kb (Table 1). DAG1b
paralogous genes from pufferfish (T. nigrovoridis and T.

rubripes), from G. aculeatus and O. latipes contain two
exons, of 310–360 and ~ 2300 bp respectively, separated
by only one intron (800–1000 bp) which is much shorter
than the one typically present in human (19977 bp) or
zebrafish (14512 bp) gene sequences (see Table 1).
Cloning of the D. labrax DG gene
The gene fishing experiment that allowed the cloning of
the D. labrax (sea bass) DAG1 was performed using a
primer pair, FISH_ext_s and FISH_ext_as (Table 3), specifically designed in order to closely match two highly conserved regions identified by aligning the DAG1 sequences
from D. rerio and T. rubripes (see Fig. 1). The PCR reaction,
performed using genomic DNA extracted from D. labrax
skeletal muscle as template, produced a fragment of ~
2000 bp, displaying a longer size than the one expected
from the D. rerio and T. rubripes DG sequences. Indeeed,
cloning and sequencing of this fragment revealed the presence of an additional 116 bp mini-intron. The nucleotides
at the splice site of the exon/mini-intron boundary conformed to the GT-AG rule. The newly identified DG
sequence from D. labrax is 1990 bp long; it encodes for a
624 amino acids sequence (deposited under the accession
number DQ149510), spanning a portion of the α-DG Nterminal region and protruding through almost the entire
β-DG region. The amino acid alignment between this
sequence and that of DG from D. rerio shows a 76.9%
identity in a 631 residues overlap (Fig. 1). Based on the
alignment score with other vertebrate sequences, our new
DG sequence from D. labrax is likely to correspond to the
DAG1a family of sequences (see Table 2).
Paralogous pufferfish DAG genes are correctly spliced
PCR analysis suggested that the mini-intron sequence of
137 bp would be properly spliced in T. nigroviridis, since
shorter bands emerged from the analysis of cDNA samples with respect of genomic DNAs (Fig. 2). This hypoth-

esis was strongly supported by the evidence of a
conservation of several typical intron consensus
sequences, such as the donor, the acceptor splice site, the
branching site and the typical pyrimidin rich-region too
(data not shown). A PCR experiment carried out using a
primer pair flanking the mini-intron region (see Table 3),
produced two fragments displaying a different size when
genomic DNA or retro-transcribed cDNA were respectively used as template. The two DNA fragments differ for
the presence of the mini-intron sequence, confirming the
splicing-out of the mini-intron sequence within the RNA.
RT-PCR demonstrated that both DAG1a and DAG1b genes
are transcribed and are likely to be expressed. In D. rerio
the amplified fragment shows the expected size confirming the presence of a single DAG1 in zebrafish and the
actin control experiment demonstrated that the cDNA
was totally free from any possible genomic DNA contamination (Fig. 2).
Western blot analysis of β-DG
To evaluate the expression of DG in the species analysed,
skeletal muscle total protein extracts, partially purified
upon a WGL-enrichment protocol (as described in Methods), were tested via Western blot, and the presence of βDG was revealed using the commercially available monoclonal antibody anti-β-DG 43DAG. This antibody is able
to recognize the last portion (15 aa) of the C-terminal
cytodomain of β-DG, harbouring the dystrophin binding
site [17] (see Fig. 1). The identified band of ≈ 43 kDa
clearly corresponds to β-DG and confirms its expression
in all the samples analysed (Fig. 3). A small mobility shift
was recorded that could depend on slight differences in
the levels of glycosylation of the β subunit. In T. nigroviridis two bands for β-DG were detected while an additional ≈ 30 kDa band was identified in C. hamatus (Fig. 3).
It is noteworthy that in mammals a proteolytic fragment
of the same size was related to a series of severe patholo-

stage, we could not assess whether such fragment would
originate from some proteolytic events or whether it
would be an alternative expression product of a putative
paralogous copy of DAG1 in this species.

Discussion
During recent years, the biological role of dystroglycan
(DG) in higher vertebrates has been in part elucidated.
The DG adhesion complex, composed of two subunits (α
and β), is a pivotal member of a large transmembraneous
group of glycoproteins associated with the cytoskeleton
representing, together with integrins, the major molecular
bridge involved in the formation and stabilization of contacts at the cell/extracellular matrix interface during
embryogenesis and in a wide variety of adult tissues
[8,17]. In mice, the concerted action of DG and laminin is
believed to trigger the initial phase of embryogenesis,

when the first contacts between cells and basement membranes are established. In fact, DAG1 knockout mice
exhibit gross developmental abnormalities beginning
around 6.5 days of gestation, while in contrast heterozygous mice are viable and fertile [8]. However, the role of
DG during embryogenesis remains controversial.
Although no mutations have been identified so far in
human populations, thus confirming the DG crucial primary role during peri-implantation in mammals, knockout experiments in zebrafish showed that early development remained unaffected by the absence of DG while a
severe dystrophic phenotype emerged during adulthood
[5].
The comparison of DAG1 among different vertebrate species, including several fish species and even antarctic ones,
which typically underwent the evolutionary process of
cold-adaptation, could be useful to understand how the

The primers used to amplify the gene sequences from D. rerio and T. nigroviridis were designed using the sequences available in the database. The
degenerate primers FISH_ext_s and FISH_ext_as, which allowed the fishing of the newly identified D. labrax sequence, were chosen exploiting two
regions displaying very high homology within the aligned DG sequences from D. rerio and T. rubripes (see also Fig. 1).

The major piece of data collected so far on the structure
and function of DAG1 in zebrafish is the work published
by Parsons and colleagues, which shows that the inactivation of the DG gene by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides causes severe muscular dystrophy in the adult stage
[5]. Genome analysis reveals that only one copy of DAG1
is present in D. rerio, displaying the typical uncomplicated
exon/intron mammalian structure [26]. On the other
hand, the analysis of available genomic sequence drafts
from T. rubripes, T. nigroviridis, O. latipes and G. aculeatus,
reveals the presence of two ORFs encoding DG, that we
here name as DAG1a and DAG1b, based on their alignment scores with respect to other mammalian DGs and in
particular to human DG (see Fig. 1, Table 1 and 2).

selection pressure influenced the actual organization of
DAG1 in fish and the whole genome duplication process.
In fact, several lines of evidence suggest that a wholegenome duplication (WGD) event occurred within the teleost lineage after separation from the tetrapod lineage,
and that only a subset of duplicates have been retained in
modern teleost genomes [16]. The analysis of genomic
sequences obtained from zebrafish and pufferfish provided further evidence for WGD during the evolution of
ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) [16,20]. It was estimated
that WGD should have taken place about 350 Myr ago,
after the separation of ray-finned and lobe-finned fish, but
before the origination of teleost fish [21]. While several
duplicated genes were subsequently lost, many others
were maintained during evolution. Preserved genes might
have underwent small changes and adopted slightly different functions and this might have further protected the
gene from being lost [22,23]. These assumptions are of
primary importance when searching for possible orthologous versions of mammalian genes in fish genomes
[24,25].

Surprisingly, the gene copy that we propose to define
DAG1a, displays a novel intronic sequence at the level of
the region corresponding to the second exon. The intron
is very short in size: 137 bp in T. rubripes and T. nigroviridis,
116 bp in G. aculeatus and D. labrax and only 86 bp in O.
latipes (see Table 1) in close similarity with the shortest
sizes of introns already identified in other species [27].
The gain of this "mini-intron" did not produce any
frameshift affecting the resulting protein sequence, as also
demonstrated by our Western blot results (see below).
Accordingly, experiments performed with specific primer
pairs designed for both DAG1a and DAG1b, reveals that in
pufferfish both the DAG1 copies are transcribed and
therefore likely to be functional and expressed (Fig. 2).
This result was somehow anticipated by the high conservation of both paralogous DAG1 sequences and by the
absence of nonsense mutations or any other major genetic
alteration that would imply a drift towards a pseudogene
status. In fact, pseudogenes are known to constantly drift
until they are either deleted or become unrecognizable
[28]. However, further analysis will be needed to investigate in detail such intron gaining event [29].
As already reported for several other genes, it is likely that
DAG1 underwent duplication as part of the whole
genome duplication (WGD) event that took place during
the Actinopterygii speciation process [16,25] (black arrow
in Fig. 4) and subsequently a sporadic gain of a miniintronic sequence took place either before the separation
between Ostariophysi and Acanthopterygii (green arrow
in Fig. 4) or afterwards (red arrow).
In D. labrax (sea bass), the result of our homologous cloning strategy for DG fishing was a gene fragment of ≈ 2000
bp (data not shown), including a sequence corresponding
to a 116 bp mini-intron which, based on the alignment
score, can be assigned to the family of DAG1a sequences
(Table 3). The expression of DG was preliminary tested by
Western blot using a monoclonal antibody directed versus
the C-terminal tail of the β-DG subunit, since this region

further experiments employing new designed degenerate
primers will be required in order to clone the DG
sequences from antarctic species.

is highly conserved in all the vertebrates [30]. In fact, positive signals of 43 kDa were detected in all the samples
analysed, including antarctic species [13-15]. Up to now,
any attempt at homologous cloning of DG sequences
from antarctic species exploiting the same primers
employed for D. labrax DG were unsuccessful. Therefore,

The secondary structure of the α-DG N-terminal region of
T. rubripes, predicted from the gene sequence (both
DAG1a and DAG1b) exploiting SSpro software http://
www.igb.uci.edu/tools/scratch[31,32] (data not shown),
suggests a significant similarity with the α-helical and βstrand elements detected in the crystal structure of mouse
α-DG N-terminal domain that was recently solved [33].
This region is composed by two autonomous domains: an
Ig-like one, and the second one resembling ribosomal
RNA-binding protein S6. Moreover, additional predictions performed using NetOGlyc software, confirm the
presence of a mucin-like domain also in the central region
of teleost α-DGs. It is noteworthy that the β-DG binding
epitope, spanning the amino acid positions 550–565 of
the C-terminal domain of α-DG, is highly conserved also
in fish [34]. In contrast, its counterpart, the putative α-DG
binding epitope spanning the amino acidic positions
691–719 in β-DG, displays a much lower degree of identity with the mammalian one, with few exceptions, such
as the conservation of Phe692 and Phe718, which have
been shown to play a crucial role in the α/β subunits interface formation (Fig. 1) [35]. Another region highly conserved is the C-terminal domain of β-DG which contains
the dystrophin binding site [17,30,36].

built using the taxonomical information available at the NCBI
database. Origin of fish pictures: the images have been downloaded from freely available web resources and extensively
readapted. The black arrow represent the whole genome
duplication (WGD) event, involving also the DG gene, that
took place during the Actinopterygii speciation. The two
additional arrows (green and red) mark hypothetical timings
of the mini-intron gaining event.

Our analysis clearly shows that the WGD event that took
place in Actinopterygii involved also DAG1. During evolution, WGD events are expected to have had a high
impact on speciation. To fully understand this impact
means to unravel all the genetic and molecular details
underlying the speciation process, and the knowledge of
which genes were retained in duplicate and how the
duplication modified their evolutionary fitness is crucial
to that aim. Generally, the functional consequences of
WGD in fish have been mitigated both by partial gene loss
and acquisition of new useful functions [37]. Indeed, in
some cases the presence of two functional copies of an
important gene like DG, could have represented an
improvement of their fitness. The morpholino oligosdriven disruption of DG in zebrafish results in the emergence of a severe dystrophic phenotype in adults that
could not be alleviated or compensated by a paralogue
isoform of DG [5].
The importance of fish model systems for the study of
Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other human muscular diseases is clearly emerging, as highlighted by the work
carried out in Kunkel's lab [38]. Due to the important role
played by DG in human congenital muscular disorders,
comparative genetic and biochemical analyses could be

particularly relevant in the race for fully elucidating its
function or misfunction in severe diseases, eventually
leading to innovative therapeutical strategies related to
DG. For example, the DG's high affinity towards the proteoglycan agrin has been one of the factors leading to the
design of miniaturized agrin, rescuing the dy/dy dystrophic phenotype in mice [39,40].
A comprehensive understanding of the biological implications of DAG1 duplication in some teleost fish species
may have unexpected repercussions on the view of "secondary dystroglycanopathies", since recently paralogue
isoforms of glycosyltransferases thought to act specifically
on DG (LARGE and POMT among others) were also identified and characterized [41,42]. It is intriguing to hypothesize that in the future "evolution-inspired" gene therapy
approaches, implying the introduction (or reintroduction) of a second DAG1 copy or isoform, will be used to
alleviate the symptoms of dystrophy in human skeletal
muscle.

DAG1 from D. rerio and T. rubripes. For T. nigroviridis we
designed two primer pairs specific for DAG1a and DAG1b,
respectively (Table 3). The specific primers ACT_s and
ACT_as for actin genes of all the species where designed
with an optimum GC concentration and an annealing
temperature of 55°C. In order to distinguish the amplified product from genomic DNA and from cDNA, ACT
primers were designed into contiguous exons. The newly
identified DG sequence of D. labrax has been deposited in
Gene Bank and assigned the accession number
DQ149510.
Sequence analysis
The multiple alignment of all the DG protein sequences
under analysis has been obtained using ClustalW [43].
Based on their respective primary structure, a secondary
structure prediction of the N-terminal region of the
DAG1a and DAG1b products from T. rubripes was
obtained using the program SSpro [31,32]. The propensity of an amino acidic stretch to be O-glycosylated was
analysed using the NetOGlyc software [44].

Methods
Nucleic acids extraction and cDNA production
Genomic DNA was obtained by Sodium acetate/Chloroform extraction from tissues previously homogenised in a
solubilization buffer and digested with Proteinase K
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The Abs260 and Abs260/Abs280 ratios
were used to determine DNA concentration and purity,
respectively.

Total RNA was extracted from tissues using the RNeasy
Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) specific for fibrous tissue.
Using this protocol we observed a massive contamination
with genomic DNA co-eluting with RNA. To avoid such
contamination, a further step was added by loading the
aqueous phase on an RNeasy column (Qiagen, Germany)
and before elution the membrane was treated with DNase
I. First strand cDNA was then synthesized using the
Enhanced Avian RT-PCR kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and
used as a template for further PCR experiments.
PCR analysis and gene cloning
All the PCR reactions (50 μl volume) were performed in a
GeneAmp PCR System 2400 temperature cycler (Perkin
Elmer) using 10 ng of cDNA as template, and 2.5 U of
AccuTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma). As positive control we
used, for each species, specific primers that amplify the
actin gene (Table 3). PCR products were cloned into the
pCR II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) using a TOPO TA Cloning® kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmidic
DNAs containing the cloned inserts were purified and
submitted to automated sequencing. All the primers used
in this analysis are reported in Table 3. The primers
FISH_ext_s and FISH_ext_as were designed on two highly
conserved regions identified aligning the sequences of

Total protein extracts and WGL-enriched fraction
preparation from tissues
Total protein extracts were obtained from skeletal muscle
biopsies in the form of freshly frozen samples collected
from all the species under analysis and stored at -80°C
until used. Tissue samples were homogenized in a solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1
mM DTT, 1% SDS) and centrifuged to obtain a clean
upper phase that was successively incubated with Wheat
germ lectin (WGL) Sephorose 6 MB (Amersham, Sweden)
to obtain DGC [45]. Western blot analysis of tissue samples were performed as described elsewhere [45].

Authors' contributions
EP did all the experimental work including the collection,
storage and homogenization of the fish tissue samples
and also gave a major contribution to the writing of the
manuscript and assembly of the final version of figures
and tables. DC carried out some of the PCR experiments
dealing with the identification of two expressed sequence
in cDNA and readapted the fish pictures. MO carried out
extensive sequence alignment analysis. RT carried out the
Western blot analysis. AG and BG contributed to edit the
manuscript. AB conceived the project, supervised the
experiments and wrote the manuscript together with EP.
