Abstract
Background: The endemic Hawaiian mints represent a major island radiation that likely originated from hybridization
between two North American polyploid lineages. In contrast with the extensive morphological and ecological diversity
among taxa, ribosomal DNA sequence variation has been found to be remarkably low. In the past few years, expressed
sequence tag (EST) projects on plant species have generated a vast amount of publicly available sequence data that can
be mined for simple sequence repeats (SSRs). However, these EST projects have largely focused on crop or otherwise
economically important plants, and so far only few studies have been published on the use of intragenic SSRs in natural
plant populations. We constructed an EST library from developing fleshy nutlets of Stenogyne rugosa principally to identify
genetic markers for the Hawaiian endemic mints.
Results: The Stenogyne fruit EST library consisted of 628 unique transcripts derived from 942 high quality ESTs, with
68% of unigenes matching Arabidopsis genes. Relative frequencies of Gene Ontology functional categories were broadly
representative of the Arabidopsis proteome. Many unigenes were identified as putative homologs of genes that are active
during plant reproductive development. A comparison between unigenes from Stenogyne and tomato (both asterid
angiosperms) revealed many homologs that may be relevant for fruit development. Among the 628 unigenes, a total of
44 potentially useful microsatellite loci were predicted. Several of these were successfully tested for cross-transferability
to other Hawaiian mint species, and at least five of these demonstrated interesting patterns of polymorphism across a
large sample of Hawaiian mints as well as close North American relatives in the genus Stachys.
Conclusion: Analysis of this relatively small EST library illustrated a broad GO functional representation. Many unigenes
could be annotated to involvement in reproductive development. Furthermore, first tests of microsatellite primer pairs
have proven promising for the use of Stenogyne rugosa EST SSRs for evolutionary and phylogeographic studies of the
Hawaiian endemic mints and their close relatives. Given that allelic repeat length variation in developmental genes of
other organisms has been linked with morphological evolution, these SSRs may also prove useful for analyses of
phenotypic differences among Hawaiian mints.

Background
It has frequently been noted that many island plant lineages show little genetic sequence divergence compared
with their continental relatives [e.g., [1,2]]. This phenomenon can be associated with recent radiations and/or
extensive gene flow, and in the case of young plant lineages, as in the Hawaiian Islands, it is often contrasted with
considerable morphological and ecological diversity. An
example is the native Hawaiian mints (Lamiaceae), which
represent a major island radiation that likely originated
from polyploid ancestors in North American Stachys (Fig.
1) [3]. Stachys is a large (ca. 300 species) and widespread
genus belonging to the subfamily Lamioideae. Based on
sequence variation in the rapidly-evolving nuclear ribosomal 5S non-transcribed spacer (5S-NTS), the Hawaiian
mints are most closely related to temperate North American Stachys, whereas with chloroplast (cpDNA) sequence
data, they group with a largely Mesoamerican Stachys lineage (see Fig. 1). This phylogenetic incongruence between
nuclear and organellar DNA data probably indicates a
reticulate ancestry for the Hawaiian mints. Their closest
relatives appear to be bird-pollinated Stachys chamissonis
and insect-pollinated S. quercetorum.
The Hawaiian mints comprise a total of 58 species in three
genera. Dry-fruited Haplostachys and fleshy-fruited Phyllostegia and Stenogyne exhibit broad morphological and
ecological variation. The sole extant member of Haplostachys (a genus of 5 species total), H. haplostachya, has
fragrant white flowers typical of insect-pollination and is
found in the xerophytic shrubland of Hawai'i. The flowers

an interlineage reticulation event [3], shows the different

Stachys species with respect to one another and the Hawaiian

of Phyllostegia resemble those of Haplostachys. The 32 species of Hawaiian Phyllostegia are herbs, lianas or subshrubs
and are mainly found in mesic to wet forest habitats. In
Stenogyne the flowers are axillary and the tubular corollas,
displaying a range of sizes and colors, usually have a
reduced lower lip, suggestive of bird-pollination. The 21
species of Stenogyne are mainly perennial vines found in
lower elevation, mesic-wet forests to higher elevation,
subalpine woodland. In contrast to this extensive morphological and ecological diversity among the Hawaiian
taxa, DNA sequence variation has been found to be
remarkably low, resulting in a lack of phylogenetic resolution among accessions of Phyllostegia and Stenogyne [4]. It
is apparent that faster evolving markers are necessary to
study the presumed hybrid origin and adaptive evolutionary aspects, such as development of fleshy fruits, of the
Hawaiian endemic mints.
In the search for suitable molecular markers to elucidate
recent radiations, non-coding regions of chloroplast and
nuclear gene sequences and sometimes variation within
DNA fragment data, e.g., from restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP), random amplified polymorphic
DNA (RAPD), and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), have been used in a diverse array of plants.
Genomic microsatellites or simple sequence repeats
(SSRs) have only had limited use for studies of natural
plant populations, since they have to be developed each
time in different plant species, which can be time consuming and expensive. However, among the advantages of
microsatellite markers are their high reproducibility,
multiallelic nature, codominant inheritance, relative
abundance, that they usually have good genome coverage,
and that only a small amount of DNA template is required
[5].
In the past few years, expressed sequence tag (EST)
projects have generated a vast amount of publicly available sequence data from plant species. These data are not
only useful for gene discovery and comparative genomic
investigation of transcriptomes and certain developmental processes, but they can also be mined for SSRs (typically referred to as EST or intragenic SSRs). These EST SSRs
are useful as molecular markers in plant genetic and evolutionary studies because (i) they represent transcribed
genes, (ii) a putative function can often be deduced by a
homology search, and (iii) since they are derived from
transcripts, they are useful for assaying functional diversity in natural populations [6]. Another important feature
of EST-SSR markers is their expected higher levels of transferability to related species than genomic SSR markers.
Several studies have now demonstrated not only high
rates of infra-generic transferability but also transferability
to other closely related genera [see [6]], which is also very
promising for comparative mapping and genomic investi-

gations of natural populations. However, EST projects
have largely focused on crop or otherwise economically
important plants, although EST data from other plants are
emerging [7-9]. One example is the Floral Genome Project
[10], which as part of a comparative genomic investigation of the floral transcriptome, has constructed a large set
of ESTs from phylogenetically basal angiosperms specifically selected to bridge the evolutionary gaps between
model plants [11].

(a)

We constructed an EST library from developing fleshy
fruits (nutlets) of Stenogyne rugosa (Fig. 2). Fleshy fruits are
rare in the mint family and are only found in few other
genera within the entire subfamily Lamioideae (Fig. 1).
However, studies of fruit pericarp structure have shown
that the fleshy nutlets of the Hawaiian mints are not anatomically homologous to other fleshy-fruited genera in
the subfamily [12]. It is possible that fixation of this novel
feature after the colonization of the Hawaiian Islands
along with sorting out of floral morphotypes ensuring
greater pollinator specialization has had a major adaptive
impact on the evolution of the Hawaiian mint lineage [4].
By constructing a Hawaiian mint fruit EST library we primarily wished to search for and develop genetic markers
for our Hawaiian endemic mint research. Furthermore, we
wished to enable comparative reproductive transcriptome
studies, e.g., with unigene sets from the Floral Genome
Project and tomato (also an asterid angiosperm) [13]. In
this paper we describe the EST library and show how a relatively small fruit EST data set can cover a broad functional representation of the general angiosperm
transcriptome. Furthermore, we discuss several potential
uses of this database, in particular as related to our search
for genetic markers.

Results
EST library characterization
Average insert size in our cDNA library was 1500 bp. Random 5' sequencing of cDNAs from developing fruits generated a total of 1273 ESTs, resulting in 942 sequences
(74%) passing quality check (see Table 1). Assembling the
EST sequences into contigs gave a total of 628 unique gene
sequences (unigenes), consisting of 352 singletons (56%)
and 276 assemblies, most of which (92%) contained two
ESTs per contig. The unigenes had an average length of
480 base pairs. Each unigene was given a numeric identifier (260504-261131). The EST data is available through
the Plant Genome Network (PGN) website [14] as well as
GenBank.
Annotation and functional classification of unigenes
Using BLASTX to annotate the Stenogyne unigene
sequences, 68% of unigenes matched Arabidopsis genes
with an expectation value of 1e-10 or better. To get a better

overview of the annotated unigenes, we used the Gene
Ontology (GO) annotation [15] search on the TAIR website [16] to classify the unigenes into functional category.

site) within the Biological Processes and Molecular Function GO categories showed overall consistency in terms of
representation within the functional classes (Fig. 4). Some
of the unigenes could be identified as putative homologs
of genes that are active during plant reproductive development (Table 2).
Comparison with a tomato unigene set
The Stenogyne fruit EST library was compared with tomato
unigene sets to identify genes essential for development,
fruit development in particular. First, Stenogyne and
tomato unigenes (downloaded from the Solanaceae
Genomics Network; [13,17]) were annotated by bestmatched hits (BLASTX e-value < 1e-10) to the Arabidopsis
genome giving a total of 3276 and 12648 hits, respectively. Among these, 1745 hits were shared between Stenogyne and tomato. Using the GO Slim functional
classification scheme [15,18], 121 loci were identified
within Developmental Processes. As a result, many genes
shared between the Stenogyne and tomato unigene sets
may be relevant for fruit/embryo/seed development.
Microsatellite discovery and preliminary results
A total of 42 unigenes (7%), comprising ca. 5% of the
total EST sequences, contained 44 potentially useful microsatellite loci. Two of the unigenes contained two micro-

satellite loci each. Trinucleotide repeats were the most
abundant (>50%) followed by tetra- (16%), penta(16%), and dinucleotide (11%) repeats (see Table 3).
Sequences for nine SSRs could be annotated to transcription factor or other nucleotide binding activity. Seven
SSRs could be annotated to developmental processes
(including the flowering time gene FCA).
Of the 35 SSR primer sets initially evaluated with homologous genomic DNA from Stenogyne rugosa, 30 primers
gave clear PCR bands within the approximate range of
expected product size. These were further tested for crosstransferability to other Hawaiian mints using the species
Stenogyne calaminthoides, Phyllostegia warshaueri, and Haplostachys haplostachya. Amplification gave positive results
for 24 primer pairs in all four taxa (see Table 4), and five
primer pairs were further tested for variation among a
total of 88 individual accessions, including 84 Hawaiian
mint accessions and four North American relatives in the
genus Stachys. Results from these five SSR loci are presented in Table 5 and Fig. 5. Two of the five loci proved to
be highly variable, with a total number of alleles of 12 and
25, respectively, whereas the three remaining loci showed
relative homogeneity among 1, 2 or 3 alleles, with some
rare alleles also present (Fig. 5).

Discussion
The Hawaiian endemic mints represent one of the largest
plant lineages in the archipelago, exhibiting extensive vegetative, habit and reproductive diversity. Targeting single
genes and comparing DNA sequences of already developed phylogenetic markers have proven very limited for
understanding the molecular basis for this fascinating
morphological radiation. Recent efforts have demonstrated that expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing can
be used as an efficient and relatively economical approach
for large-scale gene discovery and comparative genomics
research. Great potential for addressing many questions in
evolutionary biology will be afforded as more data from

non-model organisms emerge and are mined for functional information. We constructed a fruit EST library
from an Hawaiian endemic mint as a further step toward
understanding the molecular basis for the radiative evolution of the Hawaiian mint lineage and to provide
resources for comparative genomics investigations of
plant reproductive development.
EST library annotation
A relatively high frequency (68%) of Arabidopsis genes
were identified with our small fruit EST library. Also, analysis of GO annotations for the Stenogyne unigenes showed

a fairly consistent sampling of functional classes as
defined for the Arabidopsis proteome (Fig. 3). As similarly
discovered by the Floral Genome Project [11], this suggests that a limited EST data set can provide a broad functional representation relative to the entire Arabidopsis
transcriptome. For example, within the GO categories Biological Processes and Molecular Function, relatively even
representation of the different functional classes is evident
between the Stenogyne unigene set and the inferred Arabidopsis proteome (Fig. 4). In Biological Processes, the three
most represented functional classes for the two transcriptomes are 'other physiological processes', 'other metabolic

possible reason for this result is that many, perhaps rare,
unidentified transcripts from the entire Arabidopsis proteome are not discovered using an EST library approach.

Concerning our 'positive' unigene identifications, it
should be borne in mind that BLAST-based annotation of
short EST unigenes can be misleading if best BLAST hits

are more representative of domain homologies rather
than homology to particular orthologs. However, at least
among the five loci for which we analyzed microsatellite
variation in depth, the four with putative counterparts in
Arabidopsis could be annotated to specific orthologs in the
Arabidopsis genome (see below).
Reproductive developmental genes
Some of the unigenes from our EST library could be identified as putative homologs of Arabidopsis genes that are

active during plant reproductive development (Table 2).
Among these are ABNORMAL FLORAL ORGANS (AFO),
ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA CENTRORADIALIS (ATC),
FCA, GIGANTEA (GI), and LUMINIDEPENDENS (LD).
AFO, which has also been named FILAMENTOUS
FLOWER (FIL) or YABBY1, belongs to a small family of
genes encoding transcription factors. The primary function of the YABBY gene family members is to specify abaxial cell fates in lateral organs produced by apical and

sets, e.g., in developing tomato fruits [20], developing
reproductive tissues of a variety of basal angiosperms [11],

FCA, GI, and LD are flowering time genes. Flowering time
control is a complex process and molecular genetic analyses in Arabidopsis have identified many genes, as well as a
variety of environmental factors, that regulate the transition to flowering [e.g., [21]]. Interestingly, although FCA,
GI, and LD are genes that promote flowering, EST
homologs are found expressed in developing tomato
fruits [20]. ATC belongs to a small gene family that also
includes TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1), a key gene in regulating flowering time and maintaining the inflorescence
meristem [e.g., [22-24]]. If ATC acts similarly to TFL1 it
would be a flowering inhibitor. Whereas TFL1 is expressed
in both the inflorescence meristem and during the vegetative phase, ATC was found to be expressed in the
hypocotyl of young Arabidopsis plants [25]. Although
overexpression experiments with ATC showed a phenotype similarly to constitutively expressed TFL1, it was suggested that ATC and TFL1 may have different roles in
endogenous development. The Antirrhinum homolog
CENTRORADIALIS (CEN), which is the closest BLASTP
hit to our Stenogyne uniprotein in the GenBank nonredundant database, is only involved in inflorescence
meristem maintenance [26], while the SELF-PRUNING
(SP) homolog of tomato has no effect on the architecture
or timing of the inflorescence. Instead, overexpression of
SP results in an extended vegetative phase of sympodial
shoots and in the replacement of flowers by leaves in the
inflorescence [27]. If our Stenogyne ATC/TFL1 homolog is
a flowering time repressor, it is surprising to find it
expressed in developing fruit tissue. Indeed, no homolog
of this gene family has been found in any tomato EST
library [28]. Generally, flowering repressor genes are
expected to be expressed during the vegetative phase of
the plant. However, analyses of expression profiles of
transcription factor genes during silique development in
Arabidopsis revealed substantial expression of two flowering supressor genes, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 1 &
2 (MAF1 and MAF2) [29]. It is not known what function
flowering supressor genes have during silique development, but it was suggested that they may be required to
prevent precocious flowering at the embryo stage. Full
length sequencing and in situ hybridization analysis of

Stenogyne ATC homolog transcripts, as well as overexpression of the gene in Arabidopsis, would be helpful for establishing whether or not it has a flowering time function.
Another potential use for our EST resources is for further
research on single or low-copy genes. Perhaps these genes
could serve as markers for phylogenetic studies. AFO,
FCA, and ATC/TFL1 each belong to small gene families,
whereas GI and LD are single-copy genes. For example, the
GI homolog in our EST library contains three introns, and
preliminary studies with GI intron sequence variation
have shown promising nucleotide and indel (insertion/
deletion) variation among a small number of Stenogyne
and Phyllostegia species (unpublished data). Further studies of GI intron sequence variation not only among
Hawaiian mints but also among other lamioid mint genera may demonstrate utility of the locus for phylogeny
reconstruction.
Comparative fruit development studies
A comparison between Stenogyne and tomato unigenes
revealed many homologs that may be relevant for fruit
development. When annotating loci identified within
Developmental Processes using the GO functional classification scheme [15], several finer-scale GO terms were
identified that are important in fruit development as well
as reproductive development in general. Among the
homologs shared by Stenogyne and tomato that may be
particularly relevant for fruit development (annotated
below by Arabidopsis homolog) are ARABIDOPSIS
DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN (ADL1; AT5G42080), CBLINTERACTING
PROTEIN
KINASE

(CIPK3;
AT2G26980),
CHAPERONIN-60ALPHA
(CPN60A;

protein; AT4G28520), CYTOCHROME P450 78A9
(CYP78A9; AT3G61880), and DEFECTIVE KERNEL 1
(DEK1; AT1G55350). Further analysis and comparative
mapping of these and other important genes could aid in
future fruit development studies. Particularly interesting
in the case of the Hawaiian mints would be to compare
the fruit transcriptomes of fleshy-fruited Stenogyne and
dry-fruited Haplostachys.

EST microsatellite markers
The overall frequencies of SSRs in expressed regions vary
significantly in different studies depending on the minimum length of the repeat motif and the criteria used to
identify the SSRs [6]. In a number of plant EST data sets,
SSRs greater than 18 bp are present in ca. 2â7% of EST
sequences [30]. In our data set repeats greater than 18 bp
were present in 1% of the ESTs. When all of our SSRs are
considered, they represented ca. 5% of ESTs, or 7% of the
unigenes. The bias toward discovery of triplet SSRs in our
EST set concurs with many previous studies [31,32] in
matching the expectation of non-interruption of reading
frames. Hexanucleotide repeats also preserve reading
frames, but we did not discover any of these among our
Stenogyne ESTs. Dinucleotide repeats are more common
than tetra- or pentanucleotides in Arabidopsis, accounting
for 28%, 14%, and 3% of total repeats, respectively [32].
In comparison, Stenogyne di- and pentanucleotides are
under- and overrepresented, respectively, but this could
be attributed to our small EST sample size.

Our first preliminary tests of microsatellite primer pairs
have proven promising for the use of Stenogyne rugosa EST
SSRs among the Hawaiian endemic mints and their close
relatives. At least 24 primer pairs gave positive amplification among four Hawaiian mint taxa, Stenogyne rugosa, S.
calaminthoides, Phyllostegia warshaueri and Haplostachys
haplostachya, and at least five of these also worked for close
relatives in the genus Stachys. These findings corroborate
other studies that suggest EST SSR markers have great
potential for genetic mapping and evolutionary research
among closely related taxa, and also that they can be
cross-transferable between genera. With regard to the latter point, it should be noted that previous studies based
on ribosomal DNA sequence data demonstrated very little
variation among the Hawaiian mints, and a close relationship to taxa in the genus Stachys [3,4]. Therefore, it was
expected that primers developed from Stenogyne rugosa
EST sequences would be transferable to these close relatives and that amplicons would likely represent orthologous genes (also see below). The five SSR markers we
tested for variation among a large sample of Hawaiian
mints and a small number of Stachys accessions showed
different patterns of allelic polymorphism (Fig. 5). To
illustrate both potential and challenges with our EST SSRs,
we discuss these repeat patterns and provide preliminary
interpretations in detail below.
One of the five unigenes containing SSRs (260708)
received no significant match from BLAST searches. Consequently, we cannot exclude the possibility that the
entire sequence is UTR, or even intron or other non-coding DNA. However, this SSR marker showed the largest
number of alleles and variation among individuals for the
five loci examined, as well as a high PIC score (Table 5).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/16

The broad distribution of allelic lengths suggests that this
locus is not under particularly strong selection pressure
for an optimal length. The repeat is a triplet motif, and if
it occurs within a protein-coding sequence, it would stand
for either arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys) or glutamine (Glu).
Among plants studied in detail, the most common codon
repeats are those for Lys in Arabidopsis or Arg in sugarcane
[31], both of which are hydrophilic and positively
charged amino acids. The allele frequencies at this locus
show an interesting pattern (Fig. 5a) resembling a normal
distribution around an optimum at ca. 212 bp, with five
alleles (of 25 total) together receiving a frequency of ca.
70%. The two tails of the frequency distribution (i.e., alleles of <209 bp and >246 bp, respectively) represent
Hawaiian mint accessions occurring only on the island of
Hawai'i, the geologically youngest island of the Hawaiian
island chain. If representing a functional locus, it is possible that these low-frequency alleles are slightly deleterious
alleles fixed because of founder effect and drift in the ecologically open environments of the volcanically active
youngest island. Since we have no information on the
genomic location of the repeat, nor of its annotation, we
cannot exclude either that the polymorphic pattern represents amplification of paralogous loci in these polyploid
(likely octoploid) organisms. However, the singly-modal
allele distribution does follow an almost perfect trinucleotide repeat pattern, which suggests that this variation
probably occurs among homeologous loci.
For the four remaining markers it was possible to annotate
the unigenes and locate the corresponding SSR sequences
in the Arabidopsis genome. Best hits from BLAST searches
of the 261064 unigene identified it as a major intrinsic
family protein (an aquaporin, Table 3) and comparisons
with the Arabidopsis best hit located the tetranucleotide
repeat to the 3'-UTR. Investigation of other proteins with
high BLAST scores gave very poor alignment of the primers and no fragments of similar lengths to the observed
SSR fragment patterns. Although this does not exclude the
possibility of primers annealing to potential gene duplicates in the studied plants' genomes, our results are consistent with the alleles representing only one gene in
Arabidopsis, not having derived from paralogous loci. Similarly to the previous SSR marker, 260708, the allele frequency distribution suggests relatively moderate selection
around an optimum, although with only one tail representing repeat expansions (Fig. 5b). The last four alleles
(from 251 bp and up) occur in accessions of one species
(Stenogyne bifida) found only on the islands of the Maui
Nui complex. It has been observed in several systems that
SSRs in 3'-UTRs can lead to transcription slippage and
therefore SSR expansions [see [31]], and it is possible that
this mechanism could explain the pattern seen here.

The tetranucleotide repeats in markers 261039 and
260715 were found in the 3'-UTRs of single Arabidopsis
genes. The fact that three of the five repeat loci examined
here were found in 3'-UTRs follows the general observation that UTRs harbor more SSRs than protein coding
regions [32].

Interestingly, the last three loci discussed (261039,
260715, and 260553) show the presence of rare alleles
that have presumably 'escaped' from strong purifying
selection. It is possible that these presumably deleterious
alleles have been fixed by chance in colonizing polyploids.

Unigene 261039 was annotated as a putative homolog of
the axial regulator AFO (see above). One of our SSR primers was in the next-to-last exon, i.e., the primers span an
intron, which explains the difference in the expected and
the observed fragment lengths (see Table 4 and 5). Since
AFO is a member of a small gene family, other closely
related proteins were found with BLAST searches. However, these gave only very poor matches to our SSR primers, and no potential fragments of similar lengths to the
observed SSR fragment pattern. Therefore, again we propose that the alleles represent variation among homeologs. The average number of alleles per individual was
2.9 with 93% of individuals sharing all three alleles, suggesting the action of strong purifying selection on each.
This pattern suggests that the three peaks (Fig. 5c) could
have been derived from two different ancestral polyploid
genomes, one with two copies, the other with a single one.

It is clear from the limited examples presented here that
although SSR markers in transcribed regions may exhibit
useful variability, their different evolutionary histories
(selection pressures, genic locations, etc.) can lead to
markedly different patterns of polymorphism. As a consequence, when all five loci combined are analyzed hierarchically with parsimony or non-hierarchically as with
PCA analyses, only little or no significant structure is
found (results not shown). These results corroborate previous evidence for poor phylogenetic hierarchy in this
island radiation [4], further suggesting that the Hawaiian
mints could perhaps be best considered a metapopulation
with only little (emerging) phylogenetic structure among
taxa. Conceivably, genomic-derived SSRs representing a
higher proportion of non-transcribed and presumably
neutral regions might show more variable and more easily
interpretable data. However, the advantage of high crosstransferability with EST derived SSRs, and in many cases
the greater stability of scoring [33], makes these markers
highly suitable for our Hawaiian mint research. It is possible that a larger number of EST SSR markers would outperform the disadvantages of different gene histories, but
this may require deeper EST sampling to discover more
SSR loci.

As in the three cases above, no primer match could be
found for other proteins closely related to SSR marker
260715, which was annotated as a protein kinase family
protein. Like marker 261039, there is evidence for strong
purifying selection, with two major alleles following a
tetranucleotide pattern (Fig. 5d). Likely explanations are
that the two alleles derived from ancestral homologs or
perhaps represent fixed heterozygosity, assuming they do
not derive from gene duplication.
In the fifth marker we examined in detail, 260553, the
repeat was found in the 5' end of gene, i.e., directly at the
translation start site (i.e., in the N-terminus of protein). As
in the above cases, no primer match was found to other
proteins closely related to this putative eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A homolog. As expected, the
observed allele frequency pattern suggests strong purifying selection, with over 80% of accessions harboring only
one allele (Fig. 5e). Consequently, on average we find a
lower number of alleles per individual in this locus than
in the above examples. However, an interesting finding is
that there are more and longer alleles per individual on
Kaua'i, the oldest island in the Hawaiian chain (results
not shown), which suggests that repeat expansion has
been more tolerated than contraction over time. This triplet repeat encodes a glycine, a small, aliphatic residue
that may be able to fit more easily into an N-terminal protein structure.

Finally, it is well known that tandem repeats are associated with a number of diseases and phenotypic conditions, and that allelic repeat length variation in proteincoding sequences has been linked with morphological
evolution [e.g., [31,34]]. For example, considerable variation in tandem repeats within developmental regulatory
genes among different breeds of dog was associated with
significant differences in limb and skull morphology [35].
Some of our SSRs, not discussed here, are found in unigenes identified as putative homologs of genes that are
active during plant reproductive development, e.g., FCA,
ARGONAUTE, CRU3, and CHAPERONIN-60ALPHA (see
Table 3). Further studies of these microsatellites and others annotated to transcription factor or other developmental processes may prove useful for analyses of
phenotypic and ecological differences among the Hawaiian mints.

Conclusion
The Hawaiian endemic mints are a conspicuous example
of an island radiation within which morphological and
ecological diversity outweighs known genetic diversity.
The Arabidopsis-annotated unigenes assembled from our

Hawaiian mint EST library were broadly distributed in
terms of GO Biological Processes and Molecular Function
categories when compared with the Arabidopsis transcriptome. Many genes were annotated to reproductive development, and several to flowering time function. A
comparison of Hawaiian mint and tomato ESTs suggests
that the new library may be useful for comparative fruit
developmental research. Particularly, further studies of
the SSR resources described here will permit more
detailed genetic research on the Hawaiian mints, and possibly, the role that particular repeat sequences may play in
their morphological or ecological evolution.

Methods
Tissue collection and library construction
Developing fruits from Stenogyne rugosa were collected in
the field and stored by instant freezing in liquid nitrogen
for later RNA extraction and EST library construction.

Total RNA was extracted using a phenol â chloroform protocol: two grams of frozen material were ground to a fine
powder in liquid nitrogen before 5 mL of RNA extraction
buffer (100 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.8, 10 mM EDTA, 2 % SDS)
and 5 mL phenol were added. The thawed mixture was
transferred to a polypropylene Oakridge tube and centrifuged at 7000 rpm and 4Â°C for 15 min. The upper phase
was extracted twice, once using an equal volume of phenol and a second time using an equal volume of chloroform, both times centrifuging at 7000 rpm and 4Â°C for 15
min. The upper phase was transferred to a new tube and
1/10 volume of 3 M NaOAc (pH 6â7) and three volumes
of 100% EtOH were added, mixed, and stored at -20Â°C
over night to allow nucleic acids to precipitate. Nucleic
acids were pelleted by centrifugation at 7000 rpm and
4Â°C for 10 min. The pellet was dissolved in 2 mL of
DEPC-treated ddH2O. To precipitate total RNA, 0.7 mL of
8 M LiCl was added and the mixture was stored at 4Â°C for
4 hrs. The mixture was then centrifuged at 7000 rpm and
4Â°C for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in 300 Î¼L of
DEPC-treated ddH2O. For final precipitation of RNA, 30
Î¼L 3 M NaOAc (pH 6â7) and 900 Î¼L 100% EtOH was
added and the mixture stored at 4Â°C for one hour before
centrifugation at 10000 rpm and 4Â°C for 10 min. The pellet was then dissolved in ddH2O.
The concentration of total RNA was measured using a BioRad Fluorometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA)
and RiboGreen Dye (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, California, USA), and mRNA was extracted from 0.4 mg of total
RNA using the Poly (A) Purist mRNA purification Kit
(Ambion Inc., Austin, Texas, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of mRNA was
measured as above.

cDNA was synthesized from 5 Î¼g of mRNA and a cDNA
library generated using the ZAP-cDNA Gigapack III Gold
Cloning Kit (Stratagene Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA) following
the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA library was
constructed using SOLR as host, with pBluescript as vector
and cloning sites EcoRI/XhoI.
Sequencing and unigene building
Random 5' sequencing of cDNAs was done at the University of Florida ICBR Core Facility using ET Terminator
(Amersham Inc, Schaumburg, IL, USA). Sequence quality
screening and assembling of ESTs into unique gene
sequences (unigenes) was done as described in [11]. See
also Table 1 for more details.
Functional characterization
A first annotation of the unigene sequences was done
using BLAST in the GenBank NR database, and in the
complete coding sequences from Arabidopsis [36]. As a further annotation and classification of the unigenes, we
used the Gene Ontology (GO) system [15]. All Arabidopsis
hits with an expectation value of 1e-10 or better were submitted to the GO annotation search tool at the TAIR website [16,37], and relative frequencies of gene counts
assigned to the different GO functional classes were displayed as pie charts using Microsoft Excel. Comparison of
frequencies with Arabidopsis within the Biological Processes and Molecular Function GO categories was done
using the whole Arabidopsis genome annotation tool on
the TAIR website.

Comparison of the Stenogyne fruit EST library with the
tomato unigene set (downloaded from the Solanaceae
Genomics Network; [13,17]) was performed with a first
annotation by best-matched hits (BLASTX e-value < 1e10) to the Arabidopsis genome and using Nick's Venn
Selector Tool [38]. The GO Slim functional classification
scheme [15,18] was used to identify loci within Developmental Processes, and the GO annotation search tool at
the TAIR website [16] was used to produce a list of finerscale GO terms.
Identification and testing of microsatellite loci
Each of the unigenes was analyzed for long microsatellite
repeats using the free online tool SSR Primer [39], which
integrates SPUTNIK [40], an SSR repeat finder, with
Primer3 [41], a PCR primer prediction program. For testing of the SSR loci, DNA from individual accessions was
extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen Inc.,
Valencia, California, USA). Using homologous genomic
DNA from Stenogyne rugosa PCR amplifications were optimized by testing different PCR reagents and annealing
temperatures. The following protocol proved successful:
10 Î¼L reaction volume using the AmpliTaq Gold DNA
Polymerase kit (Applied Biosystems Foster City, Califor-

nia, USA), 0.2 mmol/L of a dNTP blend, 1 Î¼mol/L of each
primer, and 1 Î¼L DNA and a PCR touch-down protocol
with the following profile: 1) initial denaturation 95Â°C
10 min, 2) 10 cycles of 95Â°C 1 min, 60Â°C 1 min, decreasing annealing temperature 1Â°C/cycle, 72Â°C 1 min 30 sec,
3) 35 cycles of 95Â°C 1 min, 50Â°C 1 min, 72Â°C 1 min 30
sec, and 4) a final extension 72Â°C 10 min. Analysis of SSR
variation was done using flourescently labeled forward
primers, size standard ROX500, and an ABI3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
After a close investigation of the 44 primer pairs and their
possible location in intron/exon junctions (using the SGN
Intron Finder tool [42]), a set of 35 primers was selected
for a first evaluation with homologous genomic DNA
from Stenogyne rugosa (see Table 4 for primer sequences).
For a preliminary test of cross-transferability to other
Hawaiian mints, 30 of these primer sets were tested for the
species Stenogyne calaminthoides, Phyllostegia warshaueri,
and Haplostachys haplostachya. Furthermore, five of these
primer pairs were tested for variation among a total of 88
individual accessions, including 84 Hawaiian accessions
and four North American relatives in the genus Stachys.

The amplification profile for each of the five loci was
scored using the ABI PRISMÂ® GeneMapperÂ® Software v3.7
(Applied Biosystems). The polymorphic information content (PIC) was calculated using the Polymorphism Information Content Calculator [43]. Frequency distributions
of alleles in each locus were calculated using the software
SPSS v. 13.0 (SPSS Inc.). To investigate the genomic locations of the five microsatellites, including determination
of potential for paralogous PCR amplification, comparisons with the Arabidopsis proteome were performed at the
TAIR website [37]. Each EST sequence was translated
using six-frame translation [44], and both DNA and protein sequences were compared to the corresponding best
hits in Arabidopsis, respectively (see Table 3 for best hits),
using CLUSTALW [45]. If this approach did not provide a
location for the EST SSR, the EST SSR primer sequences
(Table 4) were aligned to various portions of the best hits
in Arabidopsis (i.e., 5' UTR, exons, introns, or 3' UTR)
using CLUSTALW. If the primers could be aligned equally
well in several locations along Arabidopsis sequences, the
locations that would give a product of expected size based
on particular Stenogyne unigenes were regarded as most
parsimonious. This procedure was repeated for next best
BLAST hits (especially if unigenes were annotated to gene
families) until paralogy could or could not be excluded.
